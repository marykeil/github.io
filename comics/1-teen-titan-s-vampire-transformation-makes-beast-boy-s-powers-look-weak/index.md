Warning: Potential spoilers for Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2!Teen Titan Miss Martian undergoes a supernatural transformation, morphing into a vampiric creature that goes head-to-head with Beast Boy&#39;s renowned shape-shifting abilities. This unexpected development prompts an intriguing question that resonates through Titan Tower: if put to the test, would Miss Martian or Beast Boy claim the title of the Titans&#39; ultimate shape-shifting member?




In the gripping pages of Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2 penned by Jeff Parker and illustrated by the dynamic duo of Michele Bandini and Trevor Hairsine, the DC Universe finds itself in the clutches of a menacing new vampire threat—the Draug. As the stakes escalate, Miss Martian joins Santa Claus and other heroes in the fight against these vampiric creatures.



          

During this issue, M&#39;gann M&#39;orzz takes on the grotesque form of a Draug in a move that underscores her extraordinary shape-shifting prowess.

Batman / Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2 finds Miss Martian partnering with Black Canary and Green Arrow in DC&#39;s fight against the deadly Draug. Executing a strategic ploy, Miss Martian assumes the form of a vampire, infiltrating the Draug&#39;s lair before setting off a flashbang. This daring tactic disorients the bloodthirsty vampires and serves as a beacon. As anticipated, the creatures give relentless chase, with Miss Martian deftly leading them into the waiting clutches of her allies, Dinah and Oliver. Together, the trio of heroes faces off against the horde of vampires, seamlessly combining their strengths and working in tandem to eliminate the vampires ensnared in their well-executed trap.

In the realm of visually appealing creatures, the Draug certainly don&#39;t make the cut. Hence, the vampiric monsters&#39; lack of aesthetic charm makes Miss Martian&#39;s decision to transform into one of them all the more noteworthy, marking it as one of her most grotesque shape-shifting feats to date. What&#39;s particularly remarkable is M&#39;gann&#39;s seamless adaptation, as she effortlessly takes on the form of these repulsive beings despite lacking any prior experience or information about them. This underlines the sheer mastery of her shape-shifting abilities, demonstrating a level of prowess that adds an intriguing layer to her already formidable skill set.






 Miss Martian vs. Beast Boy: Who’s the Ultimate Shape-Shifter? 


          

In the annals of Beast Boy&#39;s shape-shifting journey, he once grappled with a limitation that confined him to transforming into only animals within his awareness. However, the narrative took a turn when subsequent stories revealed his connection to The Red, an interstellar force that binds all animal life across the DC multiverse. This breakthrough expanded Beast Boy&#39;s repertoire to include extinct creatures and extraterrestrial fauna. Despite these evolved capabilities, the recent Beast World events unveiled a chink in his morphological armor. In Titans: Beast World #1, Beast Boy struggles immensely during his transformation into a member of the alien &#39;Star Conqueror&#39; species.

In stark contrast, M&#39;gann&#39;s adeptness in shape-shifting consistently shines through with finesse, control, and ease, especially when replicating sentient species from extraterrestrial realms such as the Draug and humans. While she hasn&#39;t encountered the magnitude of a transformation that Beast Boy underwent in the expansive Beast World, her previous success in mimicking various alien species suggests that tackling a transformation akin to the Star Conqueror might have been a smoother endeavor for her than it was for Garfield. The ultimate test of supremacy between the two shape-shifters lies in M&#39;gann attempting the same &#34;Starro&#34; transformation that Beast Boy ventured into, which would settle who is the most powerful Teen Titan shape-shifter.
