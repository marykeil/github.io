## Literature Review

In what just might be the best comic book fight scene of 2023, Wonder Woman&#39;s toughest fight arrives in the form of one Justice League icon.




The toughest opponent that Wonder Woman has ever faced arrives in the form of her own Justice League ally, Big Barda — and their battle may be DC&#39;s best fight scene of 2023. Big Barda vs. Wonder Woman has always been a hotly anticipated dream match for readers. Barda once fought a future version of Wonder Woman, but now she finally gets her hands on the true Diana Prince.




Big Barda vs. Wonder Woman makes up one of DC&#39;s best Justice League fights ever, as seen in Birds of Prey #4 by Kelly Thompson, Leonardo Romero, Jordie Bellaire, and Clayton Cowles. Wonder Woman has faced plenty of challenging opponents in her heyday, and several heroes and villains would call Diana the toughest fight of their lives.

          

However, Big Barda rises to the challenge the best she can in a thrilling battle as she distracts Diana while the rest of her team continues their mission on Themyscira. The never-before-seen fight is filled with unpredictable action from start to finish, but when the dust settles, Wonder Woman walks away with her head held high. Still, Big Barda has nothing to be ashamed of in defeat.

                  &#34;It&#39;s an Ancient Thing&#34;: DC&#39;s Ragnarok Begins Thanks to Wonder Woman and the Amazons   Wonder Woman and her legion of Amazons just inadvertently caused a DC apocalypse, on par with that of the Norse Ragnarok, as featured in the Marvel U.   





 Big Barda vs. Wonder Woman Is a Battle for the Ages 
          

Before the events of the series, the Amazons were kind enough to let Black Canary&#39;s sister, Cynthia &#34;Sin&#34; Lance into Themyscira. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to them, Sin is part of a deadly prophecy that could bring about the end of the world, and Black Canary and the Birds of Prey have decided to infiltrate Paradise Island to save Sin from her fate. One option is to talk to Wonder Woman about the consequences of holding Sin on the island, but given the stakes, Black Canary doesn&#39;t want to risk receiving a &#34;no&#34; — not when refusing to hand over Sin cannot be an option.



The Birds of Prey continue their battle on Themyscira in Birds of Prey #5, also available now from DC Comics.







Thus, the Birds of Prey map out a whole contingency plan not only for Sin&#39;s retrieval but for Wonder Woman herself. Barda lands the first punch on Diana and begins to dominate for the next couple of pages, going as far as to try to break Wonder Woman&#39;s back, Bane style. Barda continues to have the high ground until she calls Diana &#34;princess&#34; one too many times. This sparks a second wind in Wonder Woman, who delivers a massive punch to Barda&#39;s face. The fight continues to go back and forth, even with the rest of the Birds getting involved, until Diana wraps her Lasso of Truth around Barda, who resists for as long as she can until she is ultimately defeated.



 Big Barda Deserves to Be the Next Wonder Woman 
          

Fans have often debated if Big Barda should be next in line to replace Diana as Wonder Woman, and this fight scene has become the best piece of evidence in favor of that argument yet. Few characters have taken Wonder Woman to the limit like Big Barda has, and even fewer have defeated her in one-on-one combat. The fact that Big Barda achieved the former against Wonder Woman is an achievement in itself; thus, she shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of her eventual defeat. In one moment, Big Barda elevates herself up the DC ladder with an impressive performance in her fight against Wonder Woman.




Birds of Prey #4 is available now from DC Comics.
