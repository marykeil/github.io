## Literature Review

Apocalypse is as influential as he is powerful, and his impact can be felt throughout the entirety of X-Men canon. Here are the 10 ways that&#39;s true! 




En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse is perhaps the most powerful foe the X-Men have ever faced, though his influence on the wider Marvel Universe stretches far beyond a mere ‘villain-of-the-week’. In fact, despite decades of comics depicting him as such, it’s difficult to even call Apocalypse a villain when considering everything he’s done throughout his extensive history. However, he can’t be accurately called a hero, either, as the evil he’s unleashed upon the world cannot be ignored.
For both good and bad, Apocalypse has had a number of lasting impacts on the Marvel Universe. From effectively creating characters who would go on to make their own impacts on the world at large, to having a direct hand in the alteration of mutantkind’s place in history, here are the 10 ways Apocalypse changed X-Men lore forever.

 10  The Age Of Apocalypse Saw En Sabah Nur Conquer The World 
First: X-Men: Alpha #1 by Scott Lobdell, Mark Waid, Roger Cruz, and Steve Epting


 







After Legion went back in time to kill Magneto, only to accidentally kill his father, Charles Xavier, Apocalypse saw the alterations made to the timestream as an opportunity to launch an attack on humanity, and claim the world for mutant superiority under his rule. Thus, the Age of Apocalypse was born, and to this day it remains one of the most entertaining and overall badass X-Men storylines to date. While it’s easy to write it off as a mere ‘What If?’, the Age of Apocalypse actually had some detrimental impacts on Earth-616, despite existing in a branched reality.
When the Age of Apocalypse was undone by Bishop, a few variants from that timeline crossed over into Earth-616, including X-Man (Nate Grey) and Dark Beast. X-Man would later be regarded as a mutant savior who would have his own Age of X-Man after creating a pocket dimension ‘utopia’ for all mutantkind. Dark Beast would also have a lasting impact on Earth-616, as he was directly responsible for the infamous Mutant Massacre. All of this because Apocalypse took over the world in an entirely different reality.





 9  Apocalypse Saved The World From Daemons In The Ancient Past 
X-Men Vol. 5 #12 by Jonathan Hickman and Leinil Francis Yu


 







With the Dawn of X came a number of changes to the established X-Men lore, and one of the most interesting was the origin of Apocalypse. Nothing that was established in Apocalypse&#39;s official origin story - Rise of Apocalypse - was undone, but there is a piece added to Apocalypse’s personal history that puts his entire life from a different perspective: he saved the world from a horde of daemons. These daemons were crossing over from a realm called Amenth through a rift on the living island Okkara, and they threatened to conquer the world. So, Apocalypse and his family made the impossible choice of severing the island in two at the breach, creating Arrako, which fell into Amenth, and Krakoa, which remained on Earth.
Apocalypse’s family fell into Amenth with Arrako while he remained on Krakoa. Long before there were any superheroes, it was Apocalypse who saved the world, and he sacrificed his family to do so.





 8  Apocalypse’s Existence Created Marvel Comics’ First Kang: Rama-Tut 
Rise of Apocalypse #1-4 by Terry Kavanagh and Adam Pollina


 







Pharaoh Rama-Tut was the first version of Nathaniel Richards aka Kang the Conqueror introduced in Marvel Comics canon (in Fantastic Four #19, to be precise), and Rise of Apocalypse confirms that the only reason he exists at all is because of En Sabah Nur. Rama-Tut traveled to the past and conquered Egypt as Pharaoh in order to get his hands on Apocalypse before En Sabah Nur became the mutant villain Rama-Tut knew him as.
Rama-Tut wanted to mold Apocalypse into his perfect servant, and use him to truly conquer the timestream. While his plan ultimately failed, Apocalypse was the catalyst that created Rama-Tut in the first place, making him in some ways responsible for everything the villain would do as one of the Fantastic Four’s original foes, and Marvel Comics’ very first ‘Kang’.





 7  Apocalypse Created The Most Sadistic X-Men Villain There Is: Mister Sinister 
The Further Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix #3 by Peter Milligan and John Paul Leon
        

Nathaniel Essex aka Mister Sinister is perhaps the most sadistic villain in the history of X-Men canon. Not only is he a mad scientist without a conscience who conducts cruel and torturous experiments on mutants on a regular basis, but he’s also been directly responsible for a number of atrocious acts throughout his history. While Dark Beast may have been the catalyst, it was Mister Sinister who ordered the executions of practically the entire Morlock society during the Mutant Massacre. Then, years later, it was Mister Sinister who threw the entire Marvel Universe into chaos during the Sins of Sinister event - and those are just two of the plethora of examples.
Apocalypse is directly responsible for every evil thing Mister Sinister has ever done, as it was En Sabah Nur who turned this human scientist into a mutate with the drive and intelligence to commit the most heinous atrocities one could imagine.





 6  Apocalypse Actually Created Dracula (Yes, Really) 
X-Men: Apocalypse vs Dracula #1 by Frank Tieri and Clayton Henry
        

During the mid 1400s, the Four Horsemen of Apocalypse led an army called the Riders of the Dark that was so devastating in battle, that many didn’t even believe they existed, that the Dark Riders were just a myth told among the ranks of soldiers. However, when Vlad the Impaler saw the Riders first hand, he learned that they weren’t a myth, and that he would have to defeat them if he wanted to expand his empire. This conflict led to Vlad and Apocalypse engaging in single combat, where Apocalypse defeated the Impaler. This defeat led to Vlad becoming the Lord of the Vampires, Dracula.
The horrors Dracula wrought upon the world are well charted throughout Marvel canon - especially in Blade comics - and behind all of them, there stands Apocalypse as the one who created Dracula in the first place.





 5  Apocalypse Founded The Global Protection Society That Would Become SHIELD 
S.H.I.E.L.D. #1 by Jonathan Hickman and Dustin Weaver
        

The original name for this society was the Brotherhood of the Shield, and Apocalypse was one of its founding members alongside Pharaoh Imhotep and the Moon Knight of that era. The first threat they came together to fight was the Brood, as the alien species was rapidly infecting people and spreading across the globe. From that point forward, every incarnation of the secret society worked to prevent the end of the world, whatever form that took.
Eventually, this Brotherhood would become the SHIELD fans know and love today, and it all started with the world-saving heroism of a few like-minded power-houses of an ancient era, including and especially Apocalypse.





 4  Apocalypse Gave Life To One Of The Most Popular Mutant Antiheroes: Cable 
Uncanny X-Men #241 by Chris Claremont and Marc Salvestri &amp; Cable #6-8 by Fabian Nicieza Nathan
        

Summers aka Cable is the son of Cyclops and the clone of Jean Grey, Madelyne Pryor, who was infected with Apocalypse’s techno-organic virus and was sent to the future for a cure. While he wasn’t fully cured, Cable did find a way to live with his condition, and actually used being a cyborg to his advantage by integrating a number of advanced, futuristic tech into his physical body. The reason Apocalypse infected this child is two-fold. The first reason is Apocalypse wanted to see if Nathan would survive, which would mean Cable would be worthy of being Apocalypse’s adopted son. The second reason is Apocalypse wanted to create the paradox that would ensure his own survival, as Cable would later go back in time and infect Nur with the techno-organic virus, which allowed him to fully merge with Celestial technology.
Not only did Apocalypse have a direct hand in the creation of Cable, but an indirect one as well, since it was Mister Sinister who orchestrated the circumstances surrounding Nathan’s birth, and Sinister only did that because he wanted to create a mutant strong enough to kill Apocalypse. No matter how one looks at this incredibly convoluted backstory, Apocalypse is right there at the center, which - in this case - is a good thing, since it gave fans one of the most popular mutant antiheroes in X-Men lore.





 3  Apocalypse Permanently Altered A Founding Member of the X-Men: Angel 
X-Factor #17 by Louise Simonson and Walter Simonson
        

Warren Worthington III aka Angel was a founding member of the X-Men, debuting alongside the other original five in X-Men #1. But, when those original members shifted over to X-Factor, Angel’s life would quickly be thrown into turmoil. In X-Factor #15, Angel is supposedly killed, but in X-Factor #17, it’s revealed (though not yet fully) that Angel wasn’t killed, but was instead corrupted by Apocalypse, and twisted into En Sabah Nur’s Horseman of Death. It was at this point that Angel became Archangel, complete with a set of synthetic wings far superior to his original mutation, as well as blue skin reminiscent of Apocalypse’s own sinister pigment.
Not only did Apocalypse reduce a founding X-Men member to a villainous slave, but the impact this time in Warren’s life had on his psyche was permanent, even after he was saved by the X-Men, as he was forever altered by Apocalypse.





 2  Apocalypse Restored Wolverine’s Adamantium Skeleton, Becoming X-Men’s Meta Savior 
Wolverine Vol 2. #145 by Erik Larsen and Leinil Francis Yu
        

“Fatal Attractions” is the infamous storyline in which Wolverine had his adamantium skeleton ripped from his body by Magneto in an admittedly badass display. However, what remained was a Wolverine without adamantium claws, but instead his original bone claws. It was at this point that it was also revealed that the adamantium within Wolverine’s body held back the full extent of his natural mutation, and that he was destined to evolve (or, more accurately, devolve) into a feral beast (who apparently didn’t need a nose). This series of events in Wolverine’s personal lore is looked back as one of the worst, and it wouldn’t truly end until Wolverine Vol. 2 #145, when Apocalypse gave Wolverine his adamantium back.
While the storyline that surrounded Apocalypse doing this for Wolverine is one that can be easily forgotten, the real impact here is a meta one, as Apocalypse effectively undid the worst thing to happen to Wolverine in his Marvel Comics history, becoming the hero ‘90s X-Men fans needed.





 1  Apocalypse Established The First Mutant Homeworld Of Arakko 
X of Swords: Destruction #1 by Jonathan Hickman, Tini Howard, and Pepe Larraz
        

Apocalypse was the man responsible for splitting Krakoa and Arakko in the ancient past when he and his family were fighting the invading daemons of Amenth, and this epic climax to the X of Swords event saw En Sabah Nur rectifying that situation. At the end of the tournament, an agreement was reached that one mutant from Krakoa must remain in this dark dimension and one mutant from Arakko must go to Krakoa. Apocalypse chose himself to stay, and decided that the mutant to take his place would be the entirety of Arakko itself, including all the mutants who resided on the living mutant island.
Once on Earth, it was decided that Arakko would be re-established on Mars, where the mutants who lived there could have their very own planet on which to populate and expand, rather than just a mere island on a world already hostile towards mutants. With one act of selflessness that branched from another act of heroism from his own ancient past, Apocalypse helped establish the first mutant homeworld, making this perhaps the most impactful of the 10 ways Apocalypse changed X-Men lore forever.
