  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Green Lantern #8 introduces major changes to the Green Lantern Corps and the status quo, including the United Planets taking control and Earth being quarantined.
Writer Jeremy Adams aims to unravel the mystery surrounding the Emotional Spectrum, while also making the storyline accessible to readers who may not be familiar with 20 years of Green Lantern mythology.
Sinestro continues to be a significant antagonist, with themes of fear and order explored in contrast to Hal Jordan&rsquo;s more nuanced approach, while also giving depth to Sinestro&rsquo;s character.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Jeremy Adams and Ron Marz sit down with Screen Rant to reveal what the future holds for Hal Jordan and the rest of the DCU’s Green Lanterns.</p>
<p>Things are changing rapidly in Green Lantern’s corner of the DC Universe. The United Planets has assumed control of the Green Lantern Corps and quarantined Earth. Hal Jordan has resigned from the organization he sacrificed his life for. And worst of all, Green Lantern Kilowog is dead after an explosive confrontation with the Sinestro Corps. Needless to say, the writers at DC have a lot to answer for.</p>
<p>The latest DC run of Green Lantern launched with numerous mysteries, but now that Green Lantern has discovered something is going wrong with the Emotional Spectrum, he’s about to embark on a journey that will bring answers to light. Screen Rant fortunately got the chance to ask writer Jeremy Adams and Ron Marz to shed some light of their own on the epic adventures ahead of the Green Lantern Corps.</p>
<p>Screen Rant: Jeremy, your run started with a big mystery regarding Hal and the Green Lantern Corps. Now you’re unraveling this huge change in the Corps’ status quo. How’s that been?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: Good (laughs). You know, it&rsquo;s funny, I came off The Flash and I was doing like, two books a month so that the plot would get out faster. And going back to one book a month was hard, especially when we stopped for Knight Terrors for a couple months. Setting the groundwork for who I thought Hal was, or at least how I was going to write Hal, and then set up the emotional stakes and his character development, and then really get into what&rsquo;s happening out there, you know?
It&rsquo;s funny because Xermanico is such an incredible artist. He just turns in amazing, amazing pages, and we really were trying to keep Hal on Earth. But the minute we&rsquo;d done something where he was not on Earth&hellip; It makes me second guess every moment that I had Hal on Earth, because the art is so unreal that I&rsquo;m just like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before we move into Green Lantern #8, the previous issue featured a big flashback story where we finally see all of Earth&rsquo;s Green Lanterns. There are so many Lanterns that exist right now, but there&rsquo;s very little room to give them all chance to shine. Do either of you feel it&rsquo;s challenging to give every Lantern their due?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: I mean I do, but that&rsquo;s that&rsquo;s one of the great things about I think our positioning the backups is. Giving a touchstone and being able to check in with everybody as we build towards something in the fall.</p>
<p>Ron Marz: Yeah, I think the design of this is really well done because ultimately you don&rsquo;t want to feel like you&rsquo;re writing a team book. If I&rsquo;m not putting words in Jeremy&rsquo;s mouth, because obviously there are so damn many Earth Green Lanterns. It&rsquo;s tough to get everybody their due certainly in every issue, and it does become like writing a team book, which, you know, I&rsquo;ve done and you have your checklist. You got to get three pages for this guy and three pages for that guy. You know, it becomes it becomes a math problem. But I think I think the way this is being set up was really clever in that
you&rsquo;re gonna get enough of your character bits with the other Lanterns
that it makes it feel like everybody&rsquo;s getting their due. And it&rsquo;s not just the sea of people in green uniform standing behind you.</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: And it&rsquo;s also great because it&rsquo;s like, if and when they show up in the main series, you already have like an on ramp to be like &ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s been going on.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I have some idea of where their mental spaces are.&rdquo; I think, especially in issue #10, things start to really, really, really, really push forward quickly. But like Ron said, Ron is doing Kyle, I&rsquo;m doing a backup with Guy Gardner drawn by Kevin Maguire. It&rsquo;s great because people always ask about Kyle.
They&rsquo;ve been asking about Kyle since he&rsquo;s been gone
(laughs). Since I&rsquo;ve been on Wally, that was like three years ago, fans were like &ldquo;I know you&rsquo;re writing a Flash book, so can Kyle show up?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m like &ldquo;I have no control!&rdquo;. But it&rsquo;s really cool to have Ron writes something that just feels like &ldquo;Oh, Kyle hasn&rsquo;t left. This is him exactly. Him and his voice&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s great.</p>
<p>Jeremy really set you up for my next question, Ron: You&rsquo;re obviously penning Kyle Rayner in Green Lantern #8. He really seems to be searching for his own voice in your backup. What are your thoughts on Kyle as he exists right now?</p>
<p>Ron Marz: I think you get to pick your flavor with Green Lanterns. And I think most often it&rsquo;s the one that you found at the right age. And I think the right age for most people is like well, what&rsquo;s the golden age of science fiction? 12. So I think
for a certain generation, Kyle is their Green Lantern
. For a generation that&rsquo;s a little older, it&rsquo;s Hal. And then for a generation that&rsquo;s a little younger&hellip; it&rsquo;s Hal with everybody who discovered John Stewart in the animated series sort of sandwiched in there, as well. So it&rsquo;s just fun to come back and play with the toys again. Jeremy actually asked me the other day, &ldquo;How was it to find his voice?&rdquo; And, you know, it was easy. It was just right there, even though I haven&rsquo;t written the character in a few years now. But some things you just know how to do it.
So it was fun to come back, and it was fun to be writing him in a place of &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really know what&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo; He&rsquo;s a little bit lost right now, and that made sense to me. That made sense as a reader to be involved in his story, and also as a writer. You know, he&rsquo;s not the confident one. He&rsquo;s not the fearless test pilot. He&rsquo;s not the ex-military guy. And he&rsquo;s frankly not the jackass that Guy Gardner is. So it&rsquo;s a matter of, &lsquo;What lane does he fit in?&rsquo; Both in a meta sort of way, like &ldquo;Which character slot does Kyle fit in in this in this franchise?&rdquo;, but also just as a character who, for a long time, was the Green Lantern. And now we&rsquo;re back to this space police force and a lot of other Green Lanterns. So I think that this sense of, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my place? Where do I fit in?&rdquo; seemed like a natural growth of where he is right now.</p>
<p>Jeremy, back to the mystery. Your story is digging into the Emotional Spectrum, something that hasn&rsquo;t been experimented with in a while. It&rsquo;s a huge, colorful part of the mythos. What did you want to do by including it in your story?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: You know, after Geoff Thorne&rsquo;s run, there was a lot of threads that I could pick up that sparked some ideas in me. You know, I&rsquo;m friendly with Geoff Johns, so I curse his name for filling every corner of the Green Lantern universe with mythology. So I&rsquo;m trying to find a way that it can be wieldy for some Cro-Magnon man like me. Because there&rsquo;s a lot of mythology. There&rsquo;s a lot just built up over the last 15-20 years of Green Lantern that is really hard to hold on to. So in the in the way of self-preservation, my idea was to strip some of this away so that I can understand it.
But I think it it lends itself to an interesting mystery, because there are Central Power Batteries, there&rsquo;s all these other corps out there. And what happens when something&rsquo;s happening those Central Power Batteries? What happens to the Emotional Spectrum? What is the Emotional Spectrum? And what&rsquo;s the United Planets&rsquo; part in this? And how does that affect people like say, Kyle, who has been the last Green Lantern and also the ultimate White Lantern? It&rsquo;s really just playing on the stuff that&rsquo;s come before and trying to also to make it
accessible to people that haven&rsquo;t read 20 years of Green Lantern
, which is another trick that is a needle to thread. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m doing it but&hellip; (laughs).</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk bout Sinestro because he&rsquo;s a huge part of each of your stories. What gives him the staying power as the Green Lantern antagonist?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: My thing is that I love that the
philosophy between Hal and Sinestro is really a thin line
. Sinestro is using fear to instill order, especially in the newer incarnations, especially with new Corps guard ruining running things. And he&rsquo;s going &ldquo;Listen, it&rsquo;s lawless out there. And this is the way forward in a lawless land. You have to be the ultimate authority&rdquo; and Hal&rsquo;s a little more like &ldquo;Well, you know, not so much.&rdquo; You can see both sides of their philosophy but they also come in direct conflict. I think there&rsquo;s a lot of mutual respect between the two.</p>
<p>Ron Marz: There is an unfortunate attraction to fascism for a segment of people and
frankly, Sinestro is a fascist
. He&rsquo;s willing to he&rsquo;s willing to sacrifice your freedom for his order. He&rsquo;s definitely the bad guy. But I think the best villains are always the ones that you can go. &ldquo;Well, maybe he kind of has a point.&rdquo;. I think the villains that appeal to us the most is if maybe we don&rsquo;t agree with them, but you can see from their point of view. He is completely convinced that what he&rsquo;s doing is right and won&rsquo;t even consider the possibility that he&rsquo;s taking things too far.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s circle back to Earth&rsquo;s Green Lanterns. As Jeremy said, the backups feature Lanterns that haven&rsquo;t gotten the spotlight recently. So Ron, in addition to Kyle, your backup also features Far Sector&rsquo;s Jo Muellin. What was your thinking for this sort of dynamic between them?</p>
<p>Ron Marz: My thinking was the editor said &ldquo;Hey, could you put Jo in that story?&rdquo; Which was kind of cool, because I hadn&rsquo;t written the character before. And it&rsquo;s a bit of a story that leads to the next story. And that&rsquo;s what this job is in a lot of ways. You&rsquo;re playing with sort of communal toys. And sometimes you have to play with your toys in a way that leads into the next person playing with their toys. And frankly, that&rsquo;s part of the fun with the job. You&rsquo;re in a shared universe and it&rsquo;s like a giant chessboard. Everybody&rsquo;s moving pieces around and you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re playing nice with all the pieces. Frankly, there are creators who are really good and fun to work with. Jeremy has been great on this. And then there are creators who just don&rsquo;t play well with others. In this case, it was we need Kyle to sort of be figuring out where he&rsquo;s at. And then
Jo shows up at the end and that leads us to the next story
. Other than that, there wasn&rsquo;t a whole lot of direction. But you have some framework that you&rsquo;re gonna work within and then they let me sort of do whatever I wanted.</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: I mean, even when we were talking initially, you came back with something that is a very fully formed story within a few pages. I mean, was refreshing. It makes me just go &ldquo;What am I doing?&rdquo;. Like, the best type of compliment a writer can give another writer is jealousy.</p>
<p>Ron Marz: Oh, totally. Those are the ones where somebody puts a book out and they go &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t I think of that? Yeah. That&rsquo;s a really good idea.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jeremy, with your story, I have to bring this up for every fan of Green Lantern: The Animated Series out there. You brought Razer to the DCU. And I think everybody who watched that show appreciated that. He&rsquo;s working with Hal now. How important was a for you to bring Razer back and pick up his story?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: Well, you know, my first credit on television was Green Lantern: The Animated Series and I had done two episodes it was weird because I know that they had done like a Green Lantern: The Animated Series book, but not in the main continuity. But I just thought &ldquo;Gosh, these are just really wonderful characters&rdquo;, Aya and Razer and their interactions with Hal and Kilowog. And the the idea that those stories could have happened. Because nobody&rsquo;s tracking every minute of every day on these characters. I do like having that kind of synergy between properties. I would say I&rsquo;m willing to do whatever I can to get people to come read comic books. And I know there&rsquo;s
people that love Green Lantern: The Animated Series that have never read a comic
.</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: So, I know people who were excited that Razer&rsquo;s back and are like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna go read this book.&rdquo;. And that&rsquo;s part of the job too. I want people to come read comics. I think comics are awesome. I don&rsquo;t want them to die. I actually I actually think they&rsquo;re really fun and and so I will pull out anything I can out to get people to pull it. But Razer as a character is really interesting and sad and dynamic. Just having a character that nobody else has their grip on so that you don&rsquo;t have to deal with any requirements that come with any other character. That&rsquo;s why you you make characters a lot of times because you&rsquo;re just like &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no villain that we haven&rsquo;t used in the Who&rsquo;s Who&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many people use the same D-list villains and no one&rsquo;s told us and five people use it in one month. You&rsquo;re like &ldquo;Wait, what just happened?&rdquo; So having something that&rsquo;s really out of the blue that you can just use and not be told &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; is great.</p>
<p>Ron Marz: The sense of &ldquo;I can get away with more.&rdquo; is is hugely attractive. You know, you want to use the Joker. Suddenly, everybody&rsquo;s looking over your shoulder. You want to use the Rainbow Raider? Nobody&rsquo;s that interested.</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: And what&rsquo;s funny is like, then something happens. Like Tom King uses Kite Man in a way that then becomes a character where people are looking over your shoulder. Like it&rsquo;s such that&rsquo;s a that&rsquo;s a weird thing, too. If you make a character so popular that suddenly people have a vested interest in what you&rsquo;re doing with them.</p>
<p>Green Lantern is picking up steam as Hal starts to investigate this huge mystery. Anything you want to tease fans about what&rsquo;s next for Hal, the rest of the Lanterns, Sinestro, anything?</p>
<p>Jeremy Adams: We&rsquo;re gonna be rolling out a lot of answers in the next few issues and then diving into a lot more with Carol and Hal. We&rsquo;re going to be in the summer quicker than we want. And we&rsquo;re going to tie in with some
really cool stuff happening in the DC Universe at large and lead into big stuff happening in the fall
. But I just want to keep unveiling. I can&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re letting me write in comics, so I&rsquo;m just scrambling to put as much as I can before they realize &ldquo;This guy needs to go&rdquo;! (laughs)</p>
