## Literature Review

Iron Man is one of the most technologically advanced characters in comic books, which is why it&#39;s surprising Miles can take him down with one punch.




One of the things that comic book fans love seeing the most is superhero fights. It&#39;s always fun to see which hero can beat which in a straight fight, but the match-up of Iron Man against Miles Morales would not go in Tony Stark&#39;s favor, as many might texpect. In fact, one brutal encounter with Cletus Kasady proved that Miles Morales could take Tony Stark down with one punch.




Carnage Reigns Alpha – by Alex Paknadel, Cody Ziglar, Julius Ohta, Erick Arciniega, and Cory Petit – features Miles&#39; surprising effectiveness against Iron Man tech. When Cletus Kasady returns to New York City and goes on a rampage wearing one of Iron Man&#39;s suits, he quickly attracts the attention of Miles.



          

The fight seems to be entirely in Cletus&#39; favor at first, as he easily knocks Miles around with little issue. However, when Miles unleashes a venom blast directly into Cletus&#39; chest, stopping the out-of-control villain cold. This proves that Miles could take on Iron Man if necessary, as Miles&#39; venom blast completely shut Cletus down.

 Iron Man Armor Is Completely Disabled By Miles&#39; Venom Blast 


          

Iron Man&#39;s most dangerous suit was the fusion of the Extremis virus and symbiote in the Extrembiote armor. This armor was essentially alive, though wasn&#39;t sentient like most symbiotes. It granted Iron Man an absurd amount of power, and he even managed to use it to go up against Knull, the King in Black, a literal God. This was by far one of Iron Man&#39;s most impressive suits of armor, but it didn&#39;t stay with the hero long. The armor was eventually stolen by Cletus Kasady, who used it after the Carnage symbiote abandoned him. This suit made Cletus practically unstoppable – until he met Miles Morales.

Miles Morales&#39; venom blast has shown to be absurdly powerful. His venom blast has taken down a giant-sized Ant-Man, managed to fend off the venom symbiote, and now it&#39;s proven that it could take down Iron Man. The venom blast almost immediately caused the arc reactor inside Cletus Kassady&#39;s Extrembiote suit to overload and explode. While Tony could easily build suits that wouldn&#39;t be vulnerable to venom blast, it is surprising to realize most of his current suits would be vulnerable. As it turns out, that is exactly the case, giving Miles Morales a significant advantage over the famed Avenger.






 Carnage Admits Miles Truly Damaged Him 


          

Tony Stark and Miles Morales have proven to be decent friends over the years, teaming up several times to fight major threats. The two have even stopped to get burgers together after a major fight. There&#39;s no real reason to assume the two heroes would ever seriously fight instead of just talking things out. But if there ever was a reason for the two to go up against each other, unless Iron Man specifically had a suit built to handle it, there&#39;s no reason to think that Miles Morales wouldn&#39;t be able to take down Iron Man with a single punch.
