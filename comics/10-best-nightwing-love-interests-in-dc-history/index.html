  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Nightwing has had a complicated romantic history, with this list chronicling his love interests from his first crush through the present day.
Nightwing&rsquo;s romantic partners have ranged from criminals like Liu and Shawn Tsang to fellow superheroes like Helena Bertinelli, Starfire, and Batgirl.
Despite his many love interests, Nightwing&rsquo;s most enduring and fitting romance is with Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Nightwing&rsquo;s love life has been at the center of his character development over the years; this list ranks his best love interests, past to present.</p>
<p>Over the years, Nightwing has proved to be one of DC Comics&rsquo; leading men not only when it comes to superheroics, but also in the realm of romantic plotlines. Having had a higher number of love interests than many of his DC peers, Nightwing has keep readers guessing as to who he might ultimately settle down and find happiness with.
Widely considered one of DC&rsquo;s most attractive characters, Nightwing has been romantically involved with a number of women over his long history in the comics, engaging in romantic pairings with significant others ranging from civilians, to fellow superheroes. Fans have witnessed Dick Grayson&rsquo;s growth as a hero and an individual throughout his long tenure as a central figure in DC&rsquo;s vast mythos. That includes his romantic history, from his notable firsts – from his first crush, to his first heartbreak, and more – up through the present day love triangles he must find a way to navigate. Below are the Top 10 love interests in Nightwing&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>10 Nightwing Quotes That Prove He&rsquo;s Already Earned His Own Movie
Nightwing&rsquo;s bona fides as a DC hero are as extensive as Batman&rsquo;s; James Gunn&rsquo;s upcoming slate of DC films should put him front &amp; center.</p>
<p>9  Raya Vestri
Dick Grayson&rsquo;s First Crush</p>
<p>Raya Vestri was a childhood friend of Dick Grayson, from the circus where he grew up. The pair had mutual crushes on one another, but before they could act on such feelings, Dick Grayson was adopted by Batman. This took Dick away from the circus, and from Raya, who he would not see again for years. Eventually, the two would reunite in 2011&rsquo;s Nightwing #1. The pair started up their old fling once again, only for it to be revealed Raya was working with Saiko, a Court of Owls assassin, who was also a former childhood friend of Dicks – with both seeking revenge on Dick for abandoning them.
Raya first appeared in Nightwing (Vol. 3) #1 – written by Kyle Higgins, with Eddy Barrows, J.P. Mayer, Rod Reis, and Carlos M. Mangual.</p>
<p>8  Liu
A Big Moment For Young Nightwing</p>
<p>Dick Grayson&rsquo;s first physical romance was with a woman named Liu. Liu and her boss, Eddie Hwang, were criminals in charge of the 21 Tigers gang. At the time, Dick was away from Wayne Manor, trying to find what he wanted to do in the world. This led him to the shelter Eddie ran as a front. Dick was able to easily sniff out that the two were criminals, but he wasn&rsquo;t able to resist sleeping with Liu, which was a first for him. Eventually, Dick and Batman captured and arrested Eddie and Liu, who were only using Dick to get a way into Wayne Enterprises. Once again, another of Dick Grayson&rsquo;s earliest romances turned out to be rooted in deceit.
This lost year of Dick&rsquo;s life was first seen in 2007&rsquo;s Nightwing (Vol. 2) #133 – written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Jamal Igle, Keith Champagne, Edgar Dolgado, and Jared K. Fletcher.</p>
<p>Nightwing Can Never Rule Out Huntress
Helena first appeared in Huntress #1 – written by Joey Cavalieri, with art Joe Staton, Dick Giordano, Bruce D. Patterson, Nansi Hoolahan, and Albert DeGuzman.</p>
<p>One of the stranger love interests Nightwing has had was Helena Bertinelli, an off and on again member of the Bat-Family. While in the main continuity, Nightwing and Helena only slept together once, there have been alternate futures that show the pair living together happily for years. This alternate true love for Dick was shown in New 52&rsquo;s Future&rsquo;s End storyline, which showed a ton of possible futures for different characters. While the two certainly have some romantic chemistry, it&rsquo;s unlikely a full relationship between them would ever work in the main continuity, due to Helena&rsquo;s willingness to use lethal force, something Nightwing has never agreed with.</p>
<p>7  Shawn Tsang
Nightwing Has A Thing For Criminals</p>
<p>Shawn Tsang first appeared in Nightwing&rsquo;s life in Nightwing (Vol. 4) #10 by Tim Seeley, Marcus To, Chris Sotomayor, and Carlos M. Mangual.</p>
<p>Shawn was formerly a criminal known as the Defacer, who used graffiti and other art skills to get what she wanted. She was captured and sent to prison by Batman and Dick, while he was still Robin; eventually, she got out of prison and founded a support group for former supervillains. When she was accused of murder, Dick worked to clear her name, with the two growing closer over time. This relationship wasn&rsquo;t meant to last, however. Both characters admitted they loved each other, but Shawn stated that while Nightwing brought out the best in her, he also brought out the worst. As a result, she couldn&rsquo;t be around him.</p>
<p>6  Sonia Zucco
Dick Grayson&rsquo;s Most Controversial Affair</p>
<p>One of the more complicated loves that Nightwing has ever had was Sonia Zucco. Sonia Zucco was the daughter of Tony Zucco, the killer of Nightwing&rsquo;s parents, which naturally made this pairing very complicated. Sonia was nothing like her father, and wanted to distance herself from his legacy, building her own life under the Sonia Branch, and becoming the head of Gotham City&rsquo;s bank. The relationship started off well, but after Sonia confessed her true name to Dick, he simply couldn&rsquo;t see past it, and the relationship fell apart. It&rsquo;s not unreasonable, since despite his attraction to Sonia, overlooking her connection to the man who killed his parents is certainly a big ask.
Sonia debuted in Nightwing (Vol. 3) #10 – written by Kyle Higgins, with art by Eddy Barrows, Geraldo Borges, Eber Ferreira, Ruy Jose, Rod Reis, and Carlos M. Mangual.</p>
<p>Nightwing&rsquo;s Sex Symbol Status Reaches New Heights as DC Reveals His Official Animal Form
Nightwing&rsquo;s animal form is revealed as Titans: Beast World begins, but beyond the transformation, DC promises &ldquo;a lot of pain to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5  Cheyenne Fremont
Nightwing&rsquo;s Heroic Beaus Are His Most Beloved</p>
<p>Cheyenne first appeared in Nightwing #118 by Bruce Jones, Joe Dodd, BIT, Javier Rodriguez, and Pat Brosseau.</p>
<p>While Nightwing mostly dates civilians, his most famous love interests are usually fellow superheroes. Cheyenne Fremont was the female Nightwing in Bludhaven for a while. Cheyenne was a powerful telekinetic, and was nearly killed by Jason Todd during his villain era, with her being rescued by Nightwing, which turned out to be what kick-started their relationship. She had a short-lived career as a vigilante before deciding to leave Bludhaven and Dick Grayson behind. This relationship might have had the potential to be one of Nightwing&rsquo;s strongest love interests, but her hesitance to engage in superheroics wouldn&rsquo;t make her a good match in the long run.</p>
<p>4  Bridget Clancy
Another Missed Connection For Nightwing</p>
<p>When Nightwing first moved to Bludhaven, he lived in a community apartment block, where he&rsquo;d often cross paths with his landlord, Bridget Clancey. While there was an undeniable attraction between the two, they never really got together. They were absolutely interested in one another, but Nightwing&rsquo;s relationship with Batgirl started up again, meaning the two couldn&rsquo;t be anything more than friends. Bridget was then electrocuted trying to change a light bulb, and vanished for the majority of Nightwing comics, eventually reappearing only to leave again to attend med school. As a result, this was one of the biggest &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; relationships in Dick Grayson&rsquo;s history.
Bridget Clancy, who first appeared in Nightwing (Vol. 2) #2 – written by Chuck Dixon, with art Scott McDaniel, Karl Story, Roberta Tewes, and John Costanza.</p>
<p>3  Bea Bennett
A Flame That Is Still Flickering</p>
<p>Beatrice Bennett is the only person on this list who wasn&rsquo;t technically a love interest of Dick Grayson. Instead, she was a love interest of Ric Grayson, Dick&rsquo;s one-time alter ego, while he suffered from amnesia. All things considered, Bea and &ldquo;Ric&rdquo; surprisingly sweet and loving relationship. However, after Dick regained his memories and went back to his old life, he broke Bea&rsquo;s heart and cut their relationship short. The biggest tragedy of Bea&rsquo;s relationship with Dick is the fact she never got to have a relationship with Dick. She only ever knew him as Ric Grayson, whether or not she would&rsquo;ve been a good love interest for Dick himself is still unknown.
Bea first appeared in Nightwing (Vol. 4) #50 – written by Benjamin Percy, with art by Travis Moore, Chris Moneyham, Klaus Janson, Tamra Bonvillain, Nick Filardi, John Kalisz, and Carlos M. Mangual.</p>
<p>2  Starfire
A Titantic Power Couple</p>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the most famous relationships Nightwing has ever been in is with the Tamaran Princess, Starfire, also known as Koriand&rsquo;r. Dick and Koriand&rsquo;r met while Dick was still Robin and a member of the Teen Titans. Koriand&rsquo;r first learned English by sharing a kiss with Dick, which clearly left a mark on the young boy. The two were inseparable from that point and dated for years. Starfire functioned as a perfect love interest for Dick outside of his life under Batman. Starfire was a true example of Dick becoming his own man and finding his own world, but as long as he keeps drifting back into Batman&rsquo;s world, they&rsquo;ll never truly work out.
Nightwing and Starfire first met in New Teen Titans #1 – written by Marv Wolfman, with art by George Perez, Romeo Tanghal, Adrienne Roy, and Ben Oda.</p>
<p>1  Barbara Gordon
Dick&rsquo;s Most Enduring Romance</p>
<p>Dick first met Barbara Gordon in Detective Comics #359 – written by Gardner Fox, with art by Carmine Infantino, Sid Greene, Gaspar Saladino, and Julius Schwartz.</p>
<p>The most famous pairing for Nightwing is without a doubt Batgirl. It&rsquo;s not necessarily any healthier for Dick than Starfire, but as long as Nightwing continues to stay in the world of Batman, there&rsquo;s no better pair for him than Barbara Gordon. Babs has been Batgirl for almost as long as Dick has been Robin, she&rsquo;s seen nearly everything he has, and she&rsquo;s dealt with the same villains as Dick. She fully understands his trauma inside and out. This is why there&rsquo;s really no one better in Nightwing&rsquo;s love life than Barbara Gordon for where he currently is in comics.</p>
