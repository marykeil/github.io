  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Suicide Squad: KTJL, has an impressive roster of DC characters, with many actors reprising their roles from previous games.</p>
<p>The latest title in Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkhamverse, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, has an impressive roster of DC characters. While some such as Batman or Harley Quinn have appeared in the previous Batman: Arkham games, there are several who are being introduced to the Arkhamverse for the first time, like the remaining Justice League members. Rocksteady&rsquo;s character work and storytelling throughout the series has been a large part of why the Batman: Arkham games have been so successful, and the acting talent present has played a large part in this.
Actors such as Kevin Conroy, for example, reprized his role as Batman in 2008&rsquo;s Batman: Arkham Asylum over a decade after he first played the Dark Knight in Batman: The Animated Series. Although Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has taken a different gameplay approach to the previous titles, this character work is still very present in cutscenes and banter between Task Force X throughout missions and open-world exploration.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Release Date, Characters, &amp; Gameplay
After several delays, Suicide Squad: KTJL will return to the Arkhamverse as Task Force X takes on mind-controlled members of the Justice League.</p>
<p>1  Tara Strong Plays Dr. Harleen Quinzel/Harley Quinn
Strong Has Played Harley Quinn Since Batman: Arkham City</p>
<p>Prolific voice actor, Tara Strong reprises her role as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Strong first assumed the role of the villain in Batman: Arkham City, taking over from Harley Quinn&rsquo;s original actor, Arleen Sorkin. Strong has played the character in various video games and DC projects ever since.</p>
<p>2  Nuufolau Joel &ldquo;Samoa Joe&rdquo; Seanoa Plays Nanaue/King Shark
The Professional Wrestler Has Voiced Several Game Characters</p>
<p>Nanaue (a.k.a. King Shark) is portrayed by Nuufolau Joel Seanoa - who is also known by his professional wrestler name &ldquo;Samoa Joe&rdquo; - in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Outside of his main wrestling career, Seanoa has played Juggernaut in games such as Dota 2 and Dota Underlords, Beast in Telltale&rsquo;s Game of Thrones. He was also the physical performance of Sweet Tooth in the Twisted Metal series, with Will Arnett - who has been prominent in several promotional clips for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League - dubbing over him.</p>
<p>3  Bumper Robinson Plays Floyd Lawton/Deadshot
Robinson Has A Long History Of Playing DC Characters</p>
<p>One of the DC universe&rsquo;s best assassins, Deadshot, is portrayed in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League by Bumper Robinson. Robinson&rsquo;s no stranger to the DC universe, having played several roles in Static Shock, Hotspot in Teen Titans, Black Lightning in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold TV series, and Cyborg in the Justice League: Doom animated film and the LEGO DC games.
This version of Deadshot is not the version seen in previous Batman: Arkham games, as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League deems that version an &ldquo;impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4  Daniel Lapaine Plays George Harkness/Captain Boomerang
Lapaine Plays The Classic Flash Villain</p>
<p>The final playable member of Task Force X and long-time foe of The Flash, Captain Boomerang, is played by Australian actor, Daniel Lapaine. Lapaine has appeared primarily in TV and film with roles in Black Mirror, A Spy Among Friends, Catastrophe, and Zero Dark Thirty. In the gaming space, Lapaine has lent his voice to racing games such as Dirt 3 and Forza Horizon 3.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - Every Confirmed Character
Suicide Squad: KTJL is set to have an impressive roster of DC characters, with several characters also returning from Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkhamverse.</p>
<p>5  Debra Wilson Plays Amanda Waller
Wilson Has Portrayed The A.R.G.U.S. Boss In Other Stories</p>
<p>Debra Wilson is another prominent video game actress, who many may know from her role as Cere Junda in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and its sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, in which she also provided her likeness for the character. Wilson has also portrayed Amanda Waller on several occassions before Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, playing the ruthless A.R.G.U.S. boss in Telltale&rsquo;s second Batman game, Batman: The Enemy Within, and in the animated series My Adventures with Superman.</p>
<p>6  Krizia Bajos Plays Tianna Cortez
Cortez Is One Of The Friendlier A.R.G.U.S. Agents In Suicide Squad: KTJL</p>
<p>Krizia Bajos&rsquo; Tianna Cortez is one of the main A.R.G.U.S. agents who players can interact with in the Hall of Justice. Unlike most of the other agents, Cortez is slightly more playful and friendly toward Task Force X, even asking them to record videos for her fiancé and asking after Harley and whether she has any loved ones or not.</p>
<p>7  Duane R. Shepard Sr. Plays Aaron Cash
Cash Has Appeared In All Four Of Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkhamverse Games</p>
<p>Duane R. Shepard Sr. reprises his role as Aaron Cash in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, having played the character in all four of Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkhamverse games. When players were first introduced to the Arkhamverse&rsquo;s Aaron Cash, he was one of the most senior and respected security guards at Arkham Asylum. Over the course of the series, Cash moved on to become a Medical Personnel Guard at Arkham City, and then appeared as a GCPD Officer in Batman: Arkham Knight, with it being implied that he had stepped up to fill the shoes of James Gordon as Commissioner at the end of that game. In Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Cash has found another job, and is working with A.R.G.U.S. in the Hall of Justice in Metropolis.</p>
<p>8  Darcy Rose Byrnes Plays Ivy
Suicide Squad: KTJL Introduces A New Version Of The Character</p>
<p>Although Poison Ivy sacrificed herself to save Gotham from Scarecrow&rsquo;s fear toxin in Batman: Arkham Knight, she does return in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, now portrayed by The Young and the Restless and Big Shot&rsquo;s Darcy Rose Byrnes. This version of the character is still a child, having been reincarnated with no memories of her past life, and only goes by &ldquo;Ivy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>9  David Bateson Plays Lex Luthor
Superman&rsquo;s Arch-Nemesis Assists Task Force X</p>
<p>Task Force X interacts with Superman&rsquo;s arch-nemesis Lex Luthor across multiple universes in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and the tech billionaire is portrayed by David Bateson. Bateson is most well known to gamers for his performance as Agent 47 in the Hitman series.</p>
<p>10  Rick Pasqualone Plays Gizmo
The Teen Titans Villain Creates Task Force X&rsquo;s Vehicles</p>
<p>The Mafia series&rsquo; Rick Pasqualone plays Gizmo, a prominent member of Task Force X&rsquo;s &ldquo;Support Squad&rdquo; in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Gizmo is a brilliant inventor and weapons manufacturer who creates vehicles such as hover-cars for the team throughout the game, allowing them to quickly soar high above Metropolis.</p>
<p>11  Nolan North Plays Both Superman And Penguin
North Returns To The Arkhamverse</p>
<p>Nolan North returns to Arkhamverse as Penguin, having played the character since Batman: Arkham City, but also plays this universe&rsquo;s version of Superman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. This isn&rsquo;t the first time North has portrayed the Man of Steel, as he played him in the Young Justice series, and in many of the LEGO DC films.
The name of Penguin&rsquo;s gun-running front in the Arkhamverse, North Refrigeration, is likely a nod to Nolan North.</p>
<p>12  Kevin Conroy Plays Bruce Wayne/Batman
Conroy Portrayed The Dark Knight Across Different Media Since 1992</p>
<p>The most prominent voice in Arkhamverse is that of Kevin Conroy&rsquo;s Batman. Conroy portrayed the Dark Knight in all three of Rocksteady&rsquo;s previous Batman titles, and played the character for several decades in different media after his critically acclaimed portrayal in 1992&rsquo;s Batman: The Animated Series, with many considering him to be the definitive voice of the character. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is Conroy&rsquo;s final performance as he passed away in November 2022, and the game pays tribute to the actor.</p>
<p>Does Batman Really Die In Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League?
As Suicide Squad: KTJL enters early access for those who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game, the Dark Knight&rsquo;s fate has been revealed.</p>
<p>13  Scott Porter Plays Barry Allen/The Flash
Porter Has A History Of Playing Other DC Characters</p>
<p>Scott Porter plays the &ldquo;fastest man alive&rdquo;, one of the most dangerous adversaries in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Porter is another well known actor in the gaming space, with roles such as Heimdall in God of War: Ragnarök, but he has also played several DC characters over his career such as Aquaman in the LEGO DC games, and Robin in the Injustice games. Porter has also appeared previously in the Arkhamverse as the voice of Dick Grayson, a.k.a. Nightwing in Batman: Arkham Knight.</p>
<p>14  Zehra Fazal Plays Diana Prince/Wonder Woman
Wonder Woman Helps Fight Her Brainwashed Allies</p>
<p>Zehra Fazal confirmed she plays the role of Wonder Woman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League on X just weeks before the game&rsquo;s release. Fazal has appeared in several AAA games throughout her career, portraying Amara the Siren in Borderlands 3 and Jane Foster in Marvel’s Avengers. Fazal has also played many characters across the DC universe, such as Talia al Ghul in Catwoman: Hunted and Batman: Death in the Family, and Livewire in My Adventures with Superman. Wonder Woman is the only member of the Justice League who hasn&rsquo;t fallen under Brainiac&rsquo;s mind control and fights alongside Task Force X against her former allies at times.</p>
<p>15  Jason Issacs Plays Brainiac
The Harry Potter Alum Is Task Force X&rsquo;s Primary Enemy</p>
<p>Jason Issacs plays the main villain of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Brainiac. Brainiac is responsible for the destruction of Metropolis as he is on a mission to rebuild the advanced civilization he has lost. Issacs is most well known for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter movies, but has also voiced many DC characters throughout his career, such as Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul in Batman: Under the Red Hood, Superman in Superman: Red Son, and Alfred in Batman Unburied.</p>
<p>Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League Roadmap May Have Just Spoiled The Ending
Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&rsquo;s post-launch roadmap has been revealed and may have provided the biggest clue as to how the game&rsquo;s story ends.</p>
<p>16  Wally Wingert Plays Edward Nigma/The Riddler
Wingert Reprises His Arkhamverse Role</p>
<p>Riddler challenges and trophies return in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Over several games, these have become a staple of the Arkhamverse, and therefore, Wally Wingert returns as The Riddler to taunt players as they partake in his tasks across the city, and despair as they succeed in solving them.</p>
<p>17  James Horan Plays Jack Ryder
The Journalist Narrates A Museum Exhibition</p>
<p>James Horan reprises his Arkhamverse role of the journalist Jack Ryder. Although he doesn&rsquo;t appear in person, Ryder narrates &ldquo;The Batman Experience&rdquo;, a museum exhibition that recaps the events of Rocksteady&rsquo;s previous Batman titles while bridging the gap between Batman: Arkham Knight and Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.
The actors for Lois Lane, Hack, Rick Flag, Toyman and Green Lantern had yet to be revealed as of the time of writing. Once they are, these actors will be added to the list.</p>
