# The Boys  Staggering Success Proves Another R-Rated Franchise Is Going to Waste


## SUMMARY 



  Leaving Megalopolis is a zombie superhero story, where corrupted superhumans have been quarantined within a single city. The series follows the normal people trying to escape.   It has many similarities to The Walking Dead and The Boys, and could be the next big pop culture sensation.   But Leaving Megalopolis isn&#39;t just Walking Dead with superheroes or The Boys with zombies - it has a lot to say, and vast potential that still needs to be explored.

## Literature Review

What if The Boys and Walking Dead had a baby? Leaving Megalopolis is a zombie superhero story that takes the best from each franchise.




As The Boys moves from strength to strength with the announcement of a new spin-off set in Mexico, fans may be wishing there was another R-rated superhero franchise that could offer the same scope and ambition. Indeed, the most ambitious might even wish for a cross between The Boys and the zombie horror of The Walking Dead. A story that it turns out already exists, and has been unjustly forgotten.




Leaving Megalopolis is the brainchild of Gail Simone and Jim Calafiore, who famously worked on the cult favorite Secret Six series for DC. The premise is simple - after being exposed to an alien monster, the heroes of Megalopolis become zombie-like killers, hunting down the civilians they previously swore to protect.

          

Like The Walking Dead or The Boys, this core premise is explored in several different ways throughout the original comic series and its sequel, Surviving Megalopolis, with a focus on human drama and a critical eye on the traditions of the zombie and superhero genres.



Leaving Megalopolis follows police officer Mina in a city full of superheroes who are overwhelmed by the need to kill.








 In a World Where The Boys Reigns Supreme, Leaving Megalopolis Is Being Wasted 
Zombie Horror Meets Superhero Satire
         

A crowdfunded comic series that raised three times its initial funding goal, Leaving Megalopolis follows police officer Mina in a city overrun by superheroes who are overwhelmed by the need to kill. However, three factors make this initial idea particularly satisfying. First, this isn&#39;t a global disaster. The superheroes of the city were infected by one specific Lovecraftian horror, and the National Guard have so far managed to keep them contained to Megalopolis. Second, the heroes aren&#39;t mindless zombies, keeping their former pecking order and sense of &#39;territory&#39; within the city. Finally, once the heroes kill someone, their need to do so subsides for a short time.

These &#39;rules&#39; stop Leaving Megalopolis being just about &#39;super-zombies,&#39; and instead make it about the survivors&#39; attempts to escape the city limits while being hunted in a larger foodchain. Superheroes encroaching on each other&#39;s territories can create in-fighting, while a single death can temporarily ward off an otherwise unbeatable threat. In short, it&#39;s the kind of fictional universe where a lot of different stories can be told, revealing vast, untapped potential that the two current volumes and bonus materials haven&#39;t come close to exhausting.






 Leaving Megalopolis Combines The Boys &amp; Walking Dead 
The Best of Both Series Combined
         

Calling Leaving Megalopolis a fusion of The Boys and Walking Dead isn&#39;t to call it derivative, but rather to point out the ideas it&#39;s interested in exploring. Like Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson&#39;s The Boys - where superheroes are amoral celebrities - Leaving Megalopolis contrasts fallen heroes against the paragons of virtue seen in classic comics. But like Walking Dead, Leaving Megalopolis isn&#39;t really about those heroes - it&#39;s about the normal people trying to survive them.

Like Walking Dead, there are groups of survivors who have turned into monsters due to their experiences, a lone authority figure acting way above their former responsibilities, and a close-knit group of sympathetic characters rocked by tragic deaths and unexpected betrayals - as well, of course, as The Boys&#39; evil Superman who has gone from celebrated hero to deadly threat. These surface similarities show that while Leaving Megalopolis currently only stretches to around a dozen issues, it has the bones to run as long as The Boys (72 issues) or The Walking Dead (193 issues, plus specials) and the same potential for adaptation.






Some heroes take joy in their new murderous preoccupation, with buckets of gore.




However, despite these similarities, Leaving Megalopolis has its own perspective and ideas to impart. The major difference from The Boys is that Leaving Megalopolis is more sympathetic to traditional superhero stories. Where The Boys genuinely loathes the very idea of superheroes, Leaving Megalopolis treats them as an admirable ideal that it&#39;s hard for real people to live up to - especially in an emergency situation.



 Leaving Megalopolis Has Its Own Homelander 
Overlord Is a Smart &#39;Evil Superman&#39; Who Explores a Different Idea
         

This idea of truly fallen heroes is perfectly embodied in Overlord - the series&#39; corrupted Superman, who is the main threat in the first volume of the story. While The Boys&#39; Homelander was a sociopathic bully who was used to things going his way, Overlord is a true hero - someone who has been tried and tested again and again, and remained on the side of the angels. Seeing him become a predator is therefore more horror-oriented than Homelander&#39;s crimes, and there&#39;s the constant specter that if he could just be brought out of his murderous haze, he might save the day one more time.






The Boys and Walking Dead have become cultural juggernauts, and broadly for all the attributes that make Leaving Megalopolis so compelling.




Other heroes like the speedster Fleet take more joy in their new murderous preoccupations, focusing in on the horror of being hunted by someone with so much power. Of course, with that power imbalance comes buckets of gore, and Leaving Megalopolis is as fond of blood-soaked death as Walking Dead or The Boys, without the latter&#39;s more nihilistic attitude to suffering. It&#39;s also not shy of direct parody, and the series has some pretty clear stand-ins for major superheroes like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman.



 Leaving Megalopolis Needs a Revival 
The Crowdfunded Series Can Live Again - On TV or in Comics
          




Leaving Megalopolis has a strong premise, things to say, and yet is rarely acknowledged as possessing large-scale potential. This is partly because of a few missteps - the comic&#39;s name simply isn&#39;t as evocative as it needs to be to sell the concept, and a major twist in the first volume creates distance between the reader and some key characters that is only closed on a second reading. Indeed, this is an area where the series could have afforded to be more like The Walking Dead, expanding its group of survivors with a slower-burn approach to their relationships and exploits.

However, that&#39;s easily fixed. The sequel Surviving Megalopolis sets up a twist that can be used to take the story in this direction, while the world also creates the opportunity to follow different groups or individuals in the city. A bonus story from the crowdfunding campaign shows this potential, following a Robin-esque former kid sidekick who doesn&#39;t actually have powers, and therefore escaped the infection.




The Boys and Walking Dead have become cultural juggernauts, and broadly for all the attributes that make Leaving Megalopolis so compelling. Simone and Calafiore&#39;s creator notes reveal a huge, fleshed-out world full of corrupted heroes who still need to have their day. In a world where 1990&#39;s Good Omens novel can become a beloved Amazon series in 2019, there&#39;s no reason for Leaving Megalopolis to be forgotten, and publishers and broadcasters looking for the next The Boys or Walking Dead have an obvious port of call in this dystopian superhero horror story.
