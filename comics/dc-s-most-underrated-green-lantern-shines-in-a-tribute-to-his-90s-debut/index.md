A fan-favorite Green Lantern is back in a spectacular cover that pays homage to his wild and epic career. Hal Jordan and John Stewart may be anchoring the Green Lantern corner of the DC Universe, but a new variant lifts Kyle Rayner up to tribute the torchbearer&#39;s amazing history.




As the new year comes into view, DC Comics has provided looks at its upcoming releases. In February, the publisher will release Green Lantern #8 by Jeremy Adams, Ron Marz, Xermanico, and Dave Eaglesham. The issue comes with a variant cover by Evan &#34;Doc&#34; Shaner, which shows the beloved &#39;90s Green Lantern Kyle Rayner standing tall and proud against a backdrop of his past exploits. Moments such as Kyle gaining his Power Ring and his official debut as Green Lantern are seen behind him, but Kyle faces the future with a grin on his face as he wields his ring confidently.



          



  Green Lantern #8   Release Date: 2/13/24   Writer: Jeremy Adams and Ron Marz   Artist: Xermanico and Dale Eaglesham   Cover Artist: Steve Beach   Variant Cover Artists: Evan &#34;Doc&#34; Shaner, Al Barrionuevo, Tiago Da Silva, and Ramon Perez   Plot:After the revelations of what happened on Korugar, Hal discovers the United Planets are consolidating power in the universe by nefarious means, but before he can stop them, representatives of the United Planets Corps have arrived to arrest Hal for unlawful use of emotional spectrum energy in a quarantined zone!  





 New Green Lantern Cover is the Perfect Tribute to Kyle Rayner 
          

The Green Lantern Corps is filled with numerous great heroes from all across the DC Universe. But for a time, the only one wielding the Emerald Light of Willpower was Kyle Rayner. Kyle didn&#39;t get his position for being the most worthy as he was selected at a time of great crisis. However, when the Guardian of the Universe Ganthet chose Kyle, the young man rose to the occasion and became one of the greatest Lanterns to ever ring-sling. Not only was he an excellent Green Lantern, but his skills helped him gain even greater power when he ascended to such powerful roles like Ion and the White Lantern.

The current Green Lantern books have been smaller, intimate explorations of arguably the two most popular light-wielders, John Stewart and Hal Jordan. While both series have done well at giving the two a chance to shine, some fans feel like Earth&#39;s other Lanterns are being left out. This variant, and Steve Beach&#39;s standard cover for Green Lantern #9, give Kyle the face time he&#39;s been sorely lacking for the past several months. Shaner&#39;s artwork in particular does a wonderful job of showing off Rayner&#39;s amazing origin and reminds readers of how far he&#39;s come. While it&#39;s been some time since Kyle&#39;s gotten his due, this cover serves as an amazing tribute.






 The Most Underrated Green Lantern Gets the Respect He Deserves 


          

Green Lantern is a franchise that is packed to the brim with characters. In addition to the thousands of aliens in the Corps, there are nearly a dozen Earth-based Lanterns, and they don&#39;t always get a chance to be front and center like some of the more pushed ones. For fans of Kyle who feel like the character is being forgotten about by DC Comics, Shaner&#39;s cover affirms that nothing could be further from the truth. This variant is a wonderful tribute to the Green Lantern of the &#39;90s and a real treat for fans who have been missing Kyle Rayner.

Green Lantern #8 will be available from DC Comics on February 13th, 2024.
