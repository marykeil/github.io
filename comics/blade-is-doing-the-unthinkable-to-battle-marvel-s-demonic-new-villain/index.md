## Literature Review

Blade&#39;s current ongoing has introduced the Adana, a powerful new demon, and it appears only a team-up with famed vampire Dracula will bring her down. 




Warning: Spoilers for Blade #5!




The unlikely duo of Blade and Dracula must join forces to dispose of a common enemy. It would be an understatement to say that the vampire hunter and the king of vampires have a tumultuous relationship. However, when one demon shrouds the world in darkness, dooming everyone involved, they must put their differences aside.

Blade #5 – by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, KJ Diaz, and VC&#39;s Joe Sabino – unveil the one man in the Marvel Universe who may be able to help the Daywalker defeat the Adana once and for all: Dracula. Anyone remotely familiar with their history knows that Blade coming to Dracula for help was a humbling moment for the vampire hunter, and the issue makes a point to illustrate that.



          

However, the unholy alliance between the two may prove to be a critical one. Given the unbeatable nature of the Adana, Blade and Dracula together may truly be the only force the universe has to offer to defeat her for good.




                  Marvel Is Rewriting Blade Lore in a Way That Could Hugely Improve the MCU   In a preview for Blade #6, the vampire hunter enters into a new relationship with his greatest enemy and the MCU should take note.   


 It Wasn&#39;t Easy For Blade To Ask Dracula For Help 


          

Throughout the early issues of the latest Blade ongoing series, the vampire hunter has been in opposition to a force known as the Adana, one he feels responsible to defeat after inadvertently killing the one warrior capable of killing her. He went into Blade #5 holding the universe&#39;s last hope in defeating The Adana, Lucifer&#39;s sword, but the sword fell into Adana&#39;s hands during their final battle, allowing her to use the blade to unlock the final key to her plan: turning people worldwide into monsters. Blade would have one more confrontation with the Adana before the issue&#39;s over, where she gave him the sword back just to toy with him.




Following this terrible defeat, the final pages of Blade #5 featured Blade speaking to someone off-panel &#34;without pride.&#34; Humbling himself, he sung this person&#39;s praises, and emphasized what the Adana has done to the world, explaining why she needs to be stopped. Blade then asked this person to teach him everything he knows. The final page revealed that the person Blade was addressing to be Dracula, with the issue ending as Blade bent a knee, presenting Lucifer&#39;s sword as a peace offering. This suggests Dracula&#39;s help is essential to winning this war against the Adana – even if in the long-term, he remains a threat himself.



 Dracula Could Make Blade More Powerful Than Ever 


          

Blade and Dracula have previously teamed up – like when Blade was the Sheriff of Vampire Town – but naturally, it has always been a reluctant allyship. Blade #6 is set to delve further into the extent of their new dynamic, but the final page of Blade #5 goes a long way to establish the potential these two have together. Better understanding who he is, and what it means to be a vampire, could help Blade defeat the Adana. At the same time, understanding the Adana&#39;s mission statement helps readers understand why Dracula is willing to help. As she says this issue, &#34;When everyone is a monster, there are monsters no more.&#34;
