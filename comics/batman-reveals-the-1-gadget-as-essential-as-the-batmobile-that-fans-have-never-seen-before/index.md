Batman is one of the most well-trained fighters on the planet. He has spent years traveling the world and learning from anyone who would teach him how to bring down the criminals that he fights night after night. Batman is an absolute expert on human biology and psychology. Strangely, this extends to aliens - Batman is as capable going up against a Thanagarian or Scyllan as he is any human martial artist. Batman: Off-World reveals this is due to day after day of sparring with one of the galaxy&#39;s most effective training machines.

Batman didn&#39;t get himself kidnapped by just any aliens - he&#39;s now a prisoner of Captain Synn and the War Storm. Synn runs a group of interstellar mercenaries who are forced to fight in his name. They get their skills by using Punch Bots - the technology that Batman is here to use. Many tools, vehicles and machines help Batman in his mission to protect Gotham from any and all harm, but it turns out Punch Bot was one of the most essential gadgets to his story, as it&#39;s the reason he&#39;s now able to take down non-human combatants with such ease.

When Batman was first abducted, he tried to fight off the crew captain. He landed an electrified punch using a hidden gadget, then was beaten unconscious in three punches. Off-World has set up Captain Synn as the final test of Batman&#39;s new fighting abilities, however he&#39;s unwilling to join the crew&#39;s revolt until he&#39;s learned everything he can from the Punch Bot, showing just how essential its capabilities are to his mission. This story provides a fascinating look into exactly how Batman went from just being a regular vigilante who fights crime to being the legendary Dark Knight who can take on threats from beyond the stars - all thanks to a machine that fans only just learned about.
