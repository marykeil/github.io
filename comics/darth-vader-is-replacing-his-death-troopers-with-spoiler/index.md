Summary

  The Darth Vader comic series reveals the Dark Lord&#39;s intention to replace his Death Troopers with superior agents he can fully control.   Vader plans to corrupt Rebellion cyborg warriors and reprogram their mechanical components to ensure their compliance.   The new soldiers will be more deadly and dangerous than Death Troopers, and they will be under Vader&#39;s complete command, incapable of betrayal.  







Darth Vader is finally replacing his Death Troopers with a collection of surprising new soldiers in the Star Wars canon. As seen in the current and canonical Darth Vader comic series, the Dark Lord of the Sith was betrayed by his carefully chosen Death Troopers who revealed their true loyalty was to Emperor Palpatine himself. As such, Vader is now looking to ensure that a betrayal never happens again.

As seen in the new Star Wars: Revelations #1, the short story &#34;Tool of the Empire&#34; by Greg Pak and Salvador Larroca reveals Darth Vader&#39;s intentions to replace his Death Troopers with far superior agents under his command. As such, it looks as though the Dark Lord has found cyborg warriors of the Rebellion whom he intends to corrupt, turning them into warriors who will have no choice but to serve him in the future of the Star Wars timeline.

          




Thanks to the confirmation that these new soldiers are far more deadly than Vader&#39;s old troopers with plenty of effective upgrades and augmentations, the issue goes on to reveal that the Sith Lord intends to reprogram their mechanical components and ensure their compliance.

 Darth Vader&#39;s Looking For Something Better Than Death Troopers 
Vader Needs Soldiers Outside The Empire
          

As seen in the recent Darth Vader#40 from Greg Pak and Raffaele Ienco, the Dark Lord of the Sith attempted to move against his master, only to have his own Death Troopers turn against him, even though they&#39;d been carefully chosen and trained by Vader himself. As such, Vader was given a stark reminder form his master that much of the power he wields comes from Palpatine himself, making it that much harder for said power to be used against him (including Vader&#39;s immense hatred toward the Emperor).




To that end, corrupting Rebellion cyborg warriors is a dark stroke of genius. Not only as they believe to be even more deadly and dangerous that the Death Troopers were, but they will also have to follow Vader&#39;s orders without question, assuming the Sith Lord does reprogram them as he intends in this new preview. Furthermore, they&#39;ll also be a power from outside the typical Imperial system, ensuring that Vader&#39;s new soldiers will be under his command (and his alone).



 Vader&#39;s New Agents Will Be Just Like Him 
The Rebellion&#39;s Cyborgs Will Be Turned Into Imperial Weapons
          

A dark symmetry between Darth Vader and his imminent new soldier has already been made in this new issue. Essentially, these Rebel cyborgs are going to be turned into living weapons and tools of their enemies, even though they&#39;ve already suffered and endured so much as cyborgs who have lost parts of themselves in battle (not unlike the cyborg that is Vader himself). To that end, it&#39;s evident that future issues of Darth Vader in 2024 should prove to be quite exciting and intense.




Star Wars Revelations #1 (2023) is available now from Marvel Comics.
