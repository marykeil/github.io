## Literature Review

Black Adam just unleashed the most scorching (and humorous) insult on one Justice League member, who is sure to be left with a bruised ego.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Green Arrow #7!Black Adam has honed in on Green Arrow, delivering a blistering four-word roast that undeniably scorched the archer&#39;s ego. Adam&#39;s insult proves that if there&#39;s a Justice League member he&#39;ll never respect, it&#39;s Oliver Queen. This verbal smackdown is destined to be recorded in the books as one of Black Adam&#39;s best one-liners, contributing to the thoroughly entertaining and antagonistic character dynamics between these two iconic heroes.




Joshua Williamson, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Trevor Hairsine kick off Green Arrow #7 with Oliver finally returning to Earth-0 after being lost in time and space. Anticipating a warm welcome or at least some acknowledgment of his return from his fellow heroes, Oliver is shocked to discover that the Justice League has disbanded during his absence.

          

This prompts Green Arrow to embark on a quest to track down the other heroes, unraveling the mystery behind the dissolution of the premier hero team. This pursuit eventually leads Oliver to Black Adam, the once world leader, villain, dictator, and most recently, former Justice League member, who responds with, &#34;Who are you again?&#34;

Black Adam&#39;s curt four-letter sentence goes beyond a mere question; it serves as a biting burn delivered in the characteristic cold and direct manner that defines him. Although Green Arrow and Black Adam haven&#39;t shared many one-on-one interactions in the comics, their paths intersected when Black Adam joined the Justice League in the Infinite Frontier storyline. The two superheroes also fought alongside the rest of the Justice League during the Dark Crisis. Hence, Black Adam&#39;s dismissive question, &#34;Who are you again?&#34; reflects the minimal regard he holds for Green Arrow, emphasizing that despite their time as teammates in the Justice League, Oliver failed to leave a lasting impression on him.

The comedic aspect of this moment is heightened by the fact that Oliver&#39;s son, Connor Hawke, is observing these interactions and bears witness to his father receiving a significant blow to his ego from Black Adam&#39;s blunt remark. Beyond the humor, this scene also underscores that, even in Black Adam&#39;s transformation into a hero, he retains a cold-blooded edge, especially evident in his sharp one-liners and insults. It&#39;s refreshing to witness significant character growth for Black Adam without a complete overhaul of his recognizable traits, showcasing a nuanced evolution within the character. Despite the limited page time in Green Arrow #7, Williamson demonstrates his understanding and skill in depicting this iconic character.
