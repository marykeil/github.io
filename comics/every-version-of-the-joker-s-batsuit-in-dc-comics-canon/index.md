## Literature Review

The Joker is easily recognizable for his famous purple and green attire, but there have been several times when he&#39;s worn his very own Batsuit.




The Joker is one of the most visually striking characters to have ever appeared in comics. His immediately recognizable appearance is one of the things that originally helped him stand out from other comic villains at the time. While early-career Batman was mostly facing gangsters or mad scientists, Joker hit the scene in a clean purple suit, rocking neon green hair, and pale white skin.
Joker&#39;s unique appearance, as much as his personality, or his villainous pursuits, has allowed him to stand the test of time. Batman and the Joker have been fighting each other for decades at this point and are often portrayed as being equally obsessed with one another. Writers have delved into the idea of Batman being transformed into the Joker for one reason or another, and they&#39;ve also explored the idea of the Joker being Batman in different ways. This is usually just to antagonize Batman, but there have been instances where, for one reason or another, Joker has gotten his very own Batsuit.

The Joker is one of the scariest villains in the DC Universe and these 15 quotes of his prove just how disturbing the cackling clown really is.












 








 7  Joker&#39;s Store-Bought Batsuit 
Joker: Year of the Villain #1 (John Carpenter, Anthony Burch, Philip Tan, Marc Deering, Danny Miki, Jonathan Glapion, Tan, Jay David Ramos)
        

When Bane took over Gotham City, during the City of Bane event, the villains of Gotham City were allowed to run rampant. Naturally, Joker found a great deal of fun in the chaos, rampaging across Gotham City with a sidekick he&#39;d picked up. Joker&#39;s antics most notably included buying store-bought Batman and Robin costumes, forcing his sidekick to act as a twisted version Robin, to his nightmarish Batman, as he attacked regular citizens who were now &#34;criminals&#34; under Bane&#39;s rule. Since this suit was purchased from a regular costume store, it didn&#39;t provide Joker with anything useful, or help him in any way; it was purely a gag at the Caped Crusader&#39;s expense.





 6  Joker&#39;s Homemade Batsuit 
Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing #5 (Matthew Rosenberg, Carmine Di Giandomenico, Romulo Fajardo Jr, Tom Napolitano)
        

During the events of The Joker: The Man Who Stopped Laughing, the appearance of two Jokers simultaneously led to a full-on war between the respective Clown Princes of Crime. The conflict was initially an uneven one, as one Joker maintained full control of his goons, and respect of the Gotham&#39;s gangs, while the other Joker had practically no resources and no allies. This led the second Joker to have to rely a lot more on trickery and chaos to win – which, in turn, resulted in more of the city&#39;s civilian population being caught in the middle of the turf war.
While trying to track down information on what the opposing Joker was planning, the second version of Joker ended up donning a homemade Batsuit and attacking the Mad Hatter. He proceeded to beat the other villain with a baseball bat, until he was given the information he wanted. This new Batsuit that Joker designed seemed to provide him with a few advantages, as it was homemade and appeared to come with its very own utility belt. Although readers never witnessed any gadgets from the belt in action, it was certainly there, which was an improvement over his previous, store-bought costume.





 5  The Smiling Bat Suit 
The Outsiders #3 (Jackson Lanzing &amp; Collin Kelly, Robert Carey, Valentina Taddeo, Tom Napolitano)
        

Readers were recently introduced to the idea of Dimension Batman, which connects the subconscious of all Batmen across the Multiverse, giving them a space to train and trade ideas about crimefighting. Naturally, this allowed for the depiction of aa huge variety of Batmen; the stand-out was the heroic Joker known as the Smiling Bat. This version of Batman appears to be the Joker, who decided to take on the cowl at some point in his life. Considering all the other Batmen are friendly towards him, it&#39;s likely he was never a villain. While readers don&#39;t get to see the Smiling Bat in combat, he could very well possess a combination of Joker and Batman&#39;s gadgets, which would make him remarkably dangerous.





 4  Joker&#39;s Deadly Duo Suit 
Batman and The Joker: The Deadly Duo #5 (Marc Silvestri, Arif Prianto, Troy Peteri)


 







Despite being perennial enemies for decades, Batman and the Joker have teamed up at times. This was the case in the Deadly Duo storyline, where Batman and Joker were forced to work together to defeat an enemy that was manipulating them both. Batman reluctantly gave the Joker a Batsuit which seemed to grant Joker enhanced durability, allowing him to fight off a horde of superpowered zombies fairly easily. Further, Joker&#39;s new Batsuit had a secret weapon, weaponizing Joker in an unexpected way. Considering this suit was made by Batman, it was one of the most advanced suits Joker has ever worn, though it had little of the Clown Prince&#39;s personal flare.





 3  The Batman Who Laughs&#39; Original Suit 
Dark Nights: The Batman Who Laughs #1 (James Tynion IV, Riley Rossmo, Ivan Plascencia, Tom Napolitano)
        

One of the darkest worlds that DC ever explored was the world of the Batman Who Laughs. In this world, the Joker was dying of a terminal disease. Wanting to finally push Batman over the edge, he ceased holding back, fulfilling his true villainous potential by embarking on a murder spree, in which he took the life of James Gordon, along with slaughtering many innocent people. This eventually pushed Batman to break his famous &#34;no kill&#34; rule, and murder the Joker – but as he died, Joker released a toxin that infected Batman, slowly rewiring Bruce&#39;s brain to be more like the Joker.
By the time Batman realized what the Joker had done to him, it was too late to reverse the process. He no longer wanted to stop the transformation, and as a result, fully embraced his new Joker persona, becoming the Batman Who Laughs. This newly Jokerized version of Bruce created a new Batsuit, one more apropos of his current state, with a sleek green cape and Bat symbol. After donning his new attire, the Batman Who Laughs proceeded to go on a rampage, striking out against the heroes of the DC Universe, his former friends and allies, leading to widespread destruction and heartache.

 2  The Batman Who Laughs&#39; Final Suit 
Dark Nights: Metal #2 (Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, Jonathan Glapion, FCO Plascencia, and Steve Wands)


 







Dark Nights: Metal featured multiple terrifying versions of Batman. The most famous, and by far most popular, was none other than the Batman Who Laughs. This version of the Batman Who Laughs had already slaughtered his planet, reaching his full potential. He wore a brand new Batsuit, along with an Nth metal helmet that allows him to see through the Dark Multiverse. This version of the Batman Who Laughs also had Nth metal batarangs at his disposal, which could infect people with the same toxin that created him. This new Batsuit gave the Batman Who Laughs an undeniable sense of style, in addition to being one of the Multiverse&#39;s most fearsome Joker variants.





 1  The Joker&#39;s War Suit 
Batman #99 (James Tynion IV, with art by Jorge Jimenez, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles)


 







The greatest Batsuit that the Joker has ever worn was first seen in the massive Joker War event, which began when the Joker successfully managed to steal the fortune of Bruce Wayne. This allowed the Joker to unleash chaos on the city of Gotham, unlike anything he had ever achieved before. Joker equipped his thugs with the absolute finest Wayne Tech that he had access to. While his henchmen were flying Batwings and driving Batmobiles, sowing destruction through Gotham, Joker saved the best for himself. Joker donned the &#34;Bright Knight Suit,&#34; transforming it accordingly to fit his signature sense of style.
This suit granted Joker access to night vision, while also featuring a beacon on his chest, as well as including a knife, and explosive batarangs. He was also able to use the suit&#39;s tech as an EMP generator, to knock out radios, leading to more fear and uncertainty as communication lines were further disrupted. The suit afforded Joker the opportunity to be his peak destructive self, with little the populace of Gotham could do to stop him. This was by far the most powerful and dangerous Batsuit that Jokerhas ever worn, even allowing him to take Batman on in single combat.
