## Literature Review

Star Wars is seemingly exploring the Old Republic era in the established canon, albeit using one of the most surprising methods with Luke Skywalker.





Summary

  Luke experiences a vision of the past and is thrown into what looks to be a &#34;living&#34; memory of the Old Republic era.   The Sith are in a position of great power in this era, indicating it may be the time of the Sith Empire.   This exploration of the Old Republic era is exciting and suggests Luke has traveled farther back in time than the High Republic.  







Star Wars may finally be exploring Knights of the Old Republic in the most surprising way. As seen in Marvel&#39;s current and canonical Star Wars comics, Luke Skywalker is trying to purify an ancient Sith Lord&#39;s red kyber crystal. However, it seems Luke is getting far more than he bargained for with an exciting journey to what looks to be the Old Republic era.

As seen in the new Star Wars #42 from Charles Soule and Steven Cummings, Luke receives help from a woman named Gretta and her aunt who belong to the nearly-extinct Fallanassi, a group of Force adepts gifted in the art of kyber purification, healing living crystals after they&#39;d been corrupted and bled by dark sider users. Having connected with this red kyber once before, Luke&#39;s first genuine attempt to heal the dark kyber once again puts the Jedi face-to-face with the spirit of the Sith warlord who presumably corrupted the kyber thousands of years prior in the Star Wars timeline.

          




Judging by the ancient Sith Eternal symbol carried by Sith assassins, Luke is finally going to learn more about this early Sith Lord and all his guests whom he briefly met in a previous vision as seen in Star Wars #35 when he first tried accessing the crystal. Seeing as how all the characters present appear to be Sith Lords apart from Luke, it does look as though Luke has found himself during the Old Republic era, a canonical yet rarely visited period ever since Disney&#39;s continuity purge.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Luke Has Entered A Living Memory Of The Past 
An Age Where The Sith Are In Positions Of Great Power
          

Rather than physically traveling back in time through a Force nexus like the World Between Worlds, it seems as though healing this crystal requires Luke to experience a key vision through all the presumed pain this Sith lord poured into his kyber to make it bleed. However, this Sith can indeed see and interact with Luke, so much so that the young Jedi is promptly thrown into his dungeons for being a Jedi. To that end, it seems as though Luke&#39;s spirit has entered a &#34;living&#34; memory of the past.




It&#39;s also worth noting that this new villain (who&#39;s only been referred to by Marvel as a &#34;Rogue Sith&#34;) seems confused that Luke is clean and not wearing rags, the implication being that the Jedi are incredibly diminished in his time. Clearly, the Sith are in a position of great power and numbers in this period, so it&#39;s clearly an age that precedes Darth Bane&#39;s Rule of Two.



 Is Star Wars Finally Exploring The Old Republic&#39;s Sith Empire? 
KOTOR Has Been Canon, But Hardly Referenced
          

It&#39;s not yet known who this Rogue Sith is or how he might differ from typical Sith Lords. However, Luke is definitely in over his head now that he&#39;s his prisoner, even if it is just his spirit interacting with the past spirit of this Sith contained within his own corrupted kyber. With future issues set to continue Luke&#39;s explorations into the dark side and their history, perhaps it will be revealed that this is indeed the time of the Old Republic&#39;s Sith Empire.




Lucasfilm is currently focused on the more recent High Republic Era when it comes to exploring the past in comics and novels. However, the presence of these ancient Sith is quite exciting. It teases that Luke Skywalker has traveled much farther back in time than the High Republic, seeing as how the Sith did not have a major presence during that period as they do here in this new Star Wars issue. As such, an opportunity to further explore the canonical Old Republic could be very exciting.

Star Wars #42 is available now from Marvel Comics.
