 ComiXology&#39;s Newest Graphic Novel Combines Psychological Thrills with Technological Elements 
         

The exclusive preview above features a quick debriefing of the situation Frank finds himself in. It also introduces some of the stakes involved in this mission. If that wasn&#39;t enough to entice readers, it also includes a look at Pandora, the AI Frank has a history with and is hesitant to work with. It&#39;s clear that this situation is fraught with a lot of sensitive variables. It also has a lot of reservations from the story&#39;s protagonist, which are very understandable given his position and history with AI. This techno-thriller is poised to pit humans and AI against one another at highly dangerous levels if they can&#39;t manage to work together effectively. Check out the synopsis here:


In BOXED, former FBI counterintelligence agent Frank Savage is a RAID (Rapid Response, Artificial Intelligence Division) Special Agent who is called in when an AI is suspected of having evolved or deviated from its programming. If he determines there&#39;s any threat, he shuts down and &#39;boxes&#39; the AI - storing it in a vast, electromagnetically shielded underground cavern where it can&#39;t be reactivated or tampered with externally.
When Hippocrates, the C.D.C.&#39;s (Center for Disease Control) AI in charge of pandemic response, goes rogue and starts a lockdown over a non-existent pandemic, agent Savage is tasked with stopping it. He is forced to team with Pandora, a counter-intelligence AI he boxed years ago...but not before she seduced him.







 Boxed is Rooted in Personal Experience &amp; Ongoing AI Developments 
          

Regarding inspiration for this ComiXology series, Mark Sable says, &#34;Much of BOXED is inspired by my work with military and intelligence agencies as a futurist for the Atlantic Council. Artificial Intelligence software is shaking up our times, from Chat GPT to Midjourney to Open AI, these entities are becoming more immersed in our everyday reality not only replacing what humans can do, but blurring the line between human and machine intelligence and the capabilities are not to be underestimated.&#34;

On Jeremy Haun&#39;s work, Sable also adds, &#34;Jeremy has drawn covers for my books Godkillers, Miskatonic and Where Starships Go to Die, but this is the first time we&#39;ve worked together on interiors since Two-Face: Year One over a decade ago. Jeremy&#39;s work on BOXED is incredibly detailed and really stands out.&#34;




Boxed will be available on December 12 on ComiXology.

 Boxed (2023)                  Writer: Mark Sable   Artist: Jeremy Haun   Colorist: Nick Filardi   Letterer: Thomas Mauer
