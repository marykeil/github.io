# Green Lantern s New Villains Are the Sick Opposite of a New Lantern Corps


## SUMMARY 



  Green Lantern Corps faces a new threat called the Radiant Dead, who are unlike any foe they have faced before, even worse than the Black Lanterns.   The Radiant Dead can feast on any form of life, but they prefer to consume the energies of Lanterns, making them a truly insidious and existential threat to the Green Lantern Corps.   The Radiant Dead are a cosmic menace with multiversal reach, capable of using the Lanterns&#39; own power against them, taking the worst aspects of the Corps&#39; most despicable foes to terrifying extremes.

## Literature Review

The Green Lantern Corps&#39; new villains the Radiant Dead are a far more extreme version of the Black Lanterns.




Warning: contains spoilers for Green Lantern War Journal #3!Green Lantern’s new villains are the dark and twisted opposite of a new Lantern corps. The Green Lantern Corps has faced down the likes of the Sinestro Corps and the Black Lanterns, but a new threat, known as the Radiant Dead, has emerged. Readers have seen tantalizing hints of the Dead’s power, but in Green Lantern War Journal #3, they learn the horrifying truth. This stunning revelation makes the Radiant Dead unlike any foe faced before, even worse than the Black Lanterns.




Green Lantern War Journal #3 is written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and drawn by Montos. Varron, a former Green Lantern, has been corrupted by the Radiant Dead. He infects Stewart as well, and reveals the truth about the Radiant Dead: they can feast on any form of life…but they prefer Lanterns.

          

The Radiant Dead consumes and thrives on the energies of Lanterns, and as Stewart tries to fight back, Varron tells him the more he resists, the quicker he will succumb to its evil.


 The Radiant Dead Are an Existental Threat to the Green Lantern Corps 
          

The saga of the Green Lantern Corps has taken some unexpected turns in the past year, and the arrival of the Radiant Dead is but the latest. After the Guardians turned majority control of the Corps over to the United Planets, many long-time Lanterns such as Hal Jordan and John Stewart were left disenfranchised. In their place, the UP appointed the arrogant Varron to the Corps and assigned him Sector 2814. After a failed attempt at confiscating Stewart’s power, Varron falls under the spell of the Radiant Dead, becoming the vanguard of an invasion.




As one of the universe’s primary peace-keeping forces, the Green Lantern Corps have run afoul of some of the cosmos’ worst, such as the Sinestro Corps, the Manhunters, the Controllers and the Black Lanterns, to name a few. The Radiant Dead, originating from outside our universe, bear a passing resemblance to the Black Lanterns. The Black Lanterns were a terrifying sight, but they were not interested in consuming the light of other Lanterns. The Radiant Dead, on the other hand, feed on this light, meaning the more the Lanterns try to resist, the more they fall under the Dead’s influence. This makes the Radiant Dead a truly insidious foe.

Green Lantern War Journal #3 situates the Radiant Dead as a truly cosmic menace, one capable of threatening the entire multiverse. John Stewart learns this from Shepherd and a variant of Kyle Rayner, who impresses upon him how dire a threat the Radiant Dead are. For all of their power, the Black Lanterns did not have the multiversal reach of the Radiant Dead, nor could they use the Lanterns&#39; own power against them. The ante for Green Lantern has been upped by the Radiant Dead, who take the worst aspects of the Corps’ most despicable foes to terrifying extremes.
