## Literature Review

There are more than a few symbiotes running around Marvel continuity, with Eddie Brock&#39;s Anti-Venom getting a fanart treatment that truly terrifies.




The Spider-Man-adjacent hero known as Anti-Venom is a version of Marvel’s Lethal Protector that is the opposite of the original character in more ways than just his now iconic white and black design. And now, in a new piece of fanart, Anti-Venom’s rarely showcased scare factor is put front and center, showing off just how terrifying the Anti-Venom iteration of the Venom symbiote can be when backed against the wall.




Recently shared on Instagram by the popular and prolific digital artist named Kode Abdo, or as he’s more commonly and professionally known, Bosslogic (@bosslogic), this talent consistently uploads remixed designs and original artwork featuring characters from across the pop culture spectrum, including but not limited to the realm of comics.


 

Posting images of other characters hailing from both Marvel and DC Comics, like the Inhumans’ Medusa, Iron Fist, Blade, Reverse Flash, Deathstroke, Batman Beyond’s Terry McGinnis, and more, Bosslogic can always be counted on to produce some truly stunning fanart, with this scary Anti-Venom piece continuing in that creative tradition.

                  Anti-Venom Art Makes Venom&#39;s Opposite a Contender for Scariest Symbiote   Anti-Venom is featured on the variant cover of an upcoming Venom comic issue, and the masterful depiction of this character is absolutely horrifying.    





 Venom&#39;s Other Half Emerges From The Shadows In New Marvel Fanart 
          

Introduced in 2008’s The Amazing Spider-Man #569, Anti-Venom was created by Spider-Man alums Dan Slott and John Romita Jr. and immediately became a game-changing new addition to the Marvel Universe. Making his debut when the original host of Venom, Eddie Brock, was diagnosed with cancer only to have his exposure to the villain Mr. Negative cure him and then subsequently alter the traces of the symbiote in his body, Anti-Venom has the same basic abilities as Venom, just with the added power to rid others of toxins, poisons, drugs, disease, and more, solidifying him as a heroic force for good.

Set against a darkened background, Bosslogic draws Eddie’s Anti-Venom in a fit of rage as he screams out to the void with fiery red eyes as bits of his symbiote creep and crawl all over his white-colored body. Tinting Anti-Venom’s spider-logo emblazoned chest area with a crimson hue that seems to also be spreading from inside his snarling fanged mouth, Bosslogic adds tendrils of black symbiote goo whipping every which way around Eddie, giving a horror-like vibe to the image that reminds fans of just how formidable and frightening Anti-Venom can be when the situation calls for it.






 Anti-Venom Terrifies In Fanart Showing Off His Dark Side 
          

Unfortunately, Eddie Brock’s version of the character isn’t as prevalent in comics as he once was, with the mantle passing onto Flash Thompson, a transition from Agent Venom to Agent Anti-Venom that occurred during the “Venom Inc.” storyline. Furthermore and more recently, the character of Andi Benton became a new being called Silence by using samples of Flash&#39;s anti-symbiote combined with the remnants of Scream to create something entirely new. Regardless of its appearances in comics, Anti-Venom deserves more recognition in all its various forms, with Bosslogic nailing a horrifying side of a character who, fortunately for the bad guys, isn’t seen all that often.
