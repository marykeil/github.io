## Literature Review

After the swift sell out of ARAH #302, Skybound is releasing a second printing, with a new cover paying homage to a classic Snake Eyes moment.




G.I. Joe recently broke franchise records with the release of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #301, continuing Larry Hama’s legendary run on the series, which began in 1982. Now, the franchise hits another milestone, as publisher Skybound Entertainment announced that issue #302 has sold out at the retailer level, and as a result, they will be releasing a second printing of the issue – with an all-new variant cover.




Announced via Skybound’s website, the new variant cover for the issue&#39;s second printing comes courtesy of artist Danny Earls and colorist Jão Canola. It depicts Snake Eyes getting the jump on two Cobra troopers, repelling down the outside of a building and catching them unaware.



          

In addition to being a brilliant piece of art in its own right, the new cover also acts as a noticeable homage to what is perhaps the most famous G.I. Joe cover of all time: the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #302 cover by Ed Hannigan and Klaus Jansen. This was the infamous “Silent Interlude” issue, which prominently featured stand-out character Snake Eyes.

Controversial at the time, G.I. Joe:A Real American Hero #21 has since gone on to be widely regarded as one of the greatest Joe comics. Infamously featuring not a single line of dialogue, “Silent Interlude” told a simple story, featuring Snake Eyes invading Cobra HQ to rescue a captured Scarlett. Written and drawn by Larry Hama – with finishes by Steve Leialoha – the issue shows the longtime G.I. Joe creator’s mastery of the comic book page. Without dialogue, the thrilling issue is focused on the images of Snake Eyes infiltrating Cobra HQ, stealthily taking out Cobra troopers and red ninjas, as he attempts to rescue Scarlett.

The issue is also notable in that it is the first comic book appearance by Storm Shadow, Cobra’s resident ninja enforcer. This was actually the first issue that hinted at Snake Eyes’ mysterious past, revealing that he had the same red tattoo as Storm Shadow, one that readers would later learn signified both characters once belonged to the Arashikage ninja clan. Storm Shadow was believed to have killed the Hard Master, which saw the ninja ejected from the clan and forced to work in the service of Cobra Commander. Storm Shadow would go on to be one of the franchise&#39;s most complex characters, and has been a major focus of Hama’s run ever since.

G.I. Joe has recently been relaunched as a part of Skybound’s Energon Universe continuity, with the release of Duke #1. While excitement for this new era has been palpable, especially for longtime fans, it’s thrilling that the classic series is continuing as well, with Hama once more at the helm.. Larry Hama is the godfather of all things G.I. Joe, and the relaunch of his run under the original series numbering should satisfy old school fans while adding new ones to the fold. Now that the continuation of Larry Hama’s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero is an undisputed success, hopefully the series continues on for a long time.
