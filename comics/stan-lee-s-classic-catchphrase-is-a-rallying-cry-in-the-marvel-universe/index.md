## Literature Review

A classic catchphrase often associated with the legendary Stan Lee makes an appearance in Ms. Marvel&#39;s latest comic, rallying people to help her.




Warning: Spoilers for Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #4!Even in death, Stan Lee rallies the Marvel Universe into victory with a stellar homage. Before he passed away in 2018, Lee was notorious for making cameos in different Marvel projects. Not only did he act in frequent big screen appearances, but he&#39;s often been depicted in the comics with illustrated cameos of sorts, even after his passing.




Stan Lee&#39;s posthumous trend of comic cameos continues in Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #4 by Iman Vellani, Sabir Pirzada, Carlos Gomez, Adam Gorham, Erick Arciniega, VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna, Tom Muller, and Jay Bowen. Unlike most of his cameos, this one is not so much a visual featuring another appearance from Stan Lee. Instead, the issue features a cameo from his signature catchphrase, as Ms. Marvel&#39;s best friend Bruno shouts, &#34;Excelsior!&#34;

          

&#34;Excelsior&#34; is legitimately the state motto of New York, but particularly gained popularity as one of the iconic catchphrases of Stan Lee that he would say in speeches and interviews. This phrase has now gone on to inspire a rallying cry within the Marvel Universe to help Ms. Marvel save the day.





 Stan Lee&#39;s Catchphrase Saves Ms. Marvel 
          

Going into the series, Ms. Marvel has learned she possesses a hidden mutant gene that she wasn&#39;t aware of before she died for the first time. As a mutant-Inhuman hybrid, Ms. Marvel soon joins the X-Men and starts sporting a costume to proudly reflect the change to the world. Unfortunately for Ms. Marvel, proudly displaying her mutanthood quickly makes her a target of not only the anti-mutant public, but Orchis, the group that helped create the widespread disdain for mutants in the public.

The worst of her problems arrive in this issue as she struggles to face off with one of Orchis&#39; Stark Sentinels. Her best friend, Bruno (previously speculated to be a mutant, but no longer seems to be the case) tries to rally the students of Empire State University to help her. When they start to question why he would want to help a mutant, he gives a speech that includes reminding them of their state motto, &#34;Excelsior.&#34; His words finally get through to the students, who help create an advanced plasma generator that helps Ms. Marvel defeat the Stark Sentinel.






 Stan Lee&#39;s Impact on the Marvel Universe is Still Felt 
          

Stan Lee&#39;s impact on the Marvel brand is undeniable, and it&#39;s moments like this that showcase just how much impact he holds in the actual Marvel Universe as well. His catchphrase is repurposed within the Marvel Universe as a rallying cry that not only unites the troops to help a local hero, but to help get them to see a more accepting perspective instead of parroting prejudice. The comic creator&#39;s words manage to help swing the pendulum in a superhero&#39;s favor. This proves to be one of the most impactful in-canon moments that Stan Lee has had for a cameo in either the comics or the movies.



Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #4 is available now from Marvel Comics.
