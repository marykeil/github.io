 10  Deadeye is Amanda Waller&#39;s Heroic Nephew 
Created by Chuck Brown and Alitha Martinez
        

Deadeye is a former A.R.G.U.S. agent with powerful psychic abilities. He’s also a blood relative to Amanda Waller, much to his displeasure. Deadeye’s psychic powers allow him to project his consciousness to the Astral Plane, making him one of the best trackers around. While he begrudgingly takes orders from his aunt Amanda, Deadeye is far more principled than her. He recently teamed up with several Justice League heroes to stop the powerful Doctor Hate from destroying the Kingdom, a nexus point of all elemental realms. It’s even been hinted that Deadeye may become a member of a new ‘network’ of heroes.





 9  Nitida Adds to the Blue Beetle Legacy 
Created by Josh Trujillo and Adrian Gutiérrez
        

Blue Beetle might be the most notable scarab user in the DC Universe, but he’s certainly not alone. After Jaime Reyes’ big move to Palmera City, he began discovering other people bonded to scarabs, one of which was Roma, aka Nitida, the Green Beetle. Like Jaime and Khaji Da, Nitida can use her scarab to transform her body and create an entire bevy of weapons. However, things have gotten complicated for her and Blue Beetle with the debut of the Blood Scarab, who nearly killed Ted Kord. Still, Nitida has yet to back down from a fight and has Jaime’s back in their battles.





 8  Circuit Breaker Uses the Speed Force&#39;s Natural Opposite for Good 
Created by A.L. Kaplan
        

The events of Lazarus Planet introduced several new heroes and villains to the DC Universe. Performer Jules Jourdain was one such person after contact with Lazarus Resin gave him a connection to the Still Force. Like Flash’s enemy the Turtle, Jules’ powers are based on entropy. But unlike villains who have used the Still Force for evil, Circuit Breaker has shown that it can be used for good. Jules has recently revealed himself to the Flash Family during the “Beast World” crossover, and despite his non-traditional powers, Circuit Breaker has found a place among the Scarlet Speedsters.





 7  Marilyn Moonlight is a Heroic Figure From Metropolis&#39; Past 
Created by Joshua Williamson and Jamal Campbell
        

Superman has been discovering a lot about Metropolis’ hidden past ever since he started working with Lex Luthor. One secret that’s come up is the existence of the Marilyn Moonlight, a legendary figure from Metropolis’ past. Much of Moonlight’s past is shrouded in mystery, but Superman’s discovered just how much of an asset she can be. Marilyn can manipulate light energy, most notably moonlight, and use them to create solid objects at will. She can also project light-based energy, which proved useful to Superman and recharged him after he’d been drained by the Parasite. Though much of her history with Metropolis is an enigma, Moonlight seems to make for a fine ally.





 6  The Vigil Keeps the DC Universe Safe From Dangerous Tech 
Created by Ram V and Lalit Kumar Sharma
        

The Vigil is the latest hero group to emerge in the DC Universe, and they’re out to change the world for the better by whatever means necessary. The Vigil is a group of metahumans who target dangerous technology from falling into the wrong hands. Unlike the Justice League or the Titans, the team operates in the shadows, with few people aware of their existence. Thanks to Dodge’s enhanced swiftness, Saya’s shape-shifting, and Arclight’s electrokinesis, the team has stopped numerous advanced technology from making the world a much worse place.

Beast Girl was forced out of her home but found a new one with the Doom Patrol and quickly adapted to the dynamic. She helped her new allies take down powerful threats such as Degenerate, another newbie Doom Patrol member and the forces of Metagen. While Kareli isn’t the most powerful member of her team, Beast Girl’s spirit and determination make her a perfect fit for the World’s Strangest Heroes.

Created by Alyssa Wong and Haining
        

Xanthe Zhou, also known as the Envoy, is a spirit envoy for undead souls in the afterlife. Xanthe is a powerful magic-wielder and is able to keep up with the likes of John Constantine. After an unfortunate incident saw Batgirl become trapped in the Spirit World, the Envoy went all out trying to get her back to the Living Realm. They fought demons and a powerful entity known as Wan Yujing. Xanthe is a skilled fighter, but what makes them a true hero is the compassion and patience they show to all troubled souls in the Spirit World.





 3  The Boom Changed the Flash Legacy For Good 
Created by Geoff Johns and Todd Nauck


 







Stargirl discovered dozens of lost heroes in The Lost Children miniseries, but the most perplexing sidekick she discovered was Judy Garrick, aka the Boom. Judy is the forgotten daughter of the Golden Age Flash Jay Garrick and served as his sidekick before she was plucked out of the timeline. However, a heartwarming reunion with her father put Judy back where she belonged in history. Since returning to the DC Universe, Judy and her parents have struggled with their new dynamic. However, no matter what problems they face, the Boom is ready to pick up where she left off and be there at the Flash’s side.

Created by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Montos
        

Caolán Shepherd is a Green Lantern from an alternate universe where the Corps was nearly extinguished by the Radiant Dead, an undead army that consumes the Emerald Light. Shepherd and an all-powerful John Stewart defended their universe, but the Radiant Dead got away. Caolán was sent to the Prime DC Universe to help its version of John destroy the Radiant Dead once and for all. Shepherd is an amazing warrior who’s one of the few Lanterns to fight the Radiant Dead and live to tell the tale. While he’s a little rough around the edges, Caolán believes in John and remains steadfast in his mission.





 1  Trinity is Going to Change Wonder Woman&#39;s World 
Created by Tom King and Daniel Sampere


 







Trinity is, or will be, Wonder Woman’s daughter in the coming days. The latest Wonder Woman run introduced Elizabeth Marston Prince in a story set in the future. Like her mother, Trinity wields the Lasso of Truth, but she also wields the Lasso of Lies, along with a third, as-of-yet unnamed Lasso. Though she’s yet to debut in the modern-day DCU, future stories show her becoming close friends with Superman Jon Kent and the future Batman Damian Wayne. Trinity can be a bit headstrong and dive headfirst into situations, but she has a strong desire to be just as good a Wonder Woman as her mother was.
As the new year begins, these 10 heroes are undoubtedly going to shape the DC Universe&#39;s history for the better.
