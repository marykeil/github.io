# Why DC s Justice Lords Are the Best  Evil Justice League 


## SUMMARY 



  The Justice Lords are not simply evil opposites of the Justice League, but rather they were corrupted by their own choices.   Unlike the Crime Syndicate, the Justice Lords hold the same beliefs and act similarly to the Justice League until they kill Lex Luthor, making them a true cautionary tale.   The Justice Lords are the greatest evil version of the Justice League because they are, in fact, the Justice League themselves.

## Literature Review

The Justice League have faced many evil versions of themselves over the years but only one team is their true evil opposites.




Many versions of the Justice League throughout the Multiverse are heroes, but some of them are villains. Only one evil version of the Justice League has truly been labeled as the team&#39;s worst variant by Superman: the Justice Lords.




The reason why Superman considers the Justice Lords the League&#39;s true opposites is revealed in Justice League Beyond 2.0 #17 by Christos Gage, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Saida Temofonte. In this story, Superman tells the history of the Justice Lords to Terry McGinnis, and one of the major points that Superman makes is that the Justice Lords aren&#39;t simply evil opposites of the Justice League.

          

They once were exactly like the Justice League of DC&#39;s main continuity and the DC Animated Universe continuity — until one choice led them down a different path that changed everything. The Justice Lords aren&#39;t evil opposites of the League: they were simply corrupted by their own choices.

                  Superman Names the Justice League Hero He Thinks Could Still Turn Evil   The Justice League is occasionally home to some of DC&#39;s darker heroes, but Jon Kent&#39;s Superman knows how dark one of them could really be.   





 Superman Admits that the Justice Lords Aren&#39;t Evil - Just Corrupted 
          

The Justice Lords come from a world that is very similar to the DCAU Justice League&#39;s world. The two have almost the exact same history — with one major point of convergence when Lex Luthor gets away with murdering the Flash. In a rage, Superman attacks Lex Luthor and kills him for his crimes. But this event doesn&#39;t turn the Justice League pure evil, as the morality involved is a bit more complicated than that. Instead of the Justice League becoming irredeemable killers, they become corrupted. They still want the same thing: to save the world and stop crime. After the death of Lex, however, they are more aggressive about achieving that goal. This results in cruel outcomes — like lobotomizing their rogues to neutralize them.

While teams like the Crime Syndicate are true evil versions of the Justice League, they&#39;re missing one vital thing that the Justice Lords have. The Lords aren&#39;t just &#34;evil&#34; versions of the Justice League: they are corrupted versions, which makes them much more sinister. Teams like the Crime Syndicate are polar opposites of the Justice League, which means the Justice League never were or never could be like those characters. Ultraman, for example, has a reversed version of Superman&#39;s biology: he can use Kryptonite for energy and is weakened by sunlight. While these difference make a great evil Justice League, there&#39;s no real threat of the Justice League ever becoming the Crime Syndicate.






 The Justice League Could Turn Evil at Any Moment 
          

This isn&#39;t the case for the Justice Lords; they hold all the same beliefs as the Justice League and even act identically to them right up until they kill Luthor. This makes them far more dangerous, since they act as a true cautionary tale. They&#39;re what the Justice League would truly be if they ever went evil. The Justice League is meant to be a paragon of virtue in the DC Universe, but Justice League members are people — and people are flawed. One human mistake sent this version of the Justice League down a dark path that turned them into the Justice Lords. They are truly the greatest evil version of the Justice League — because they are, in fact, the Justice League.
