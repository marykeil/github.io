## Literature Review

Thor is fully aware of the day he is going to die and how it will happen, but that won&#39;t stop him from being the hero he is destined to be. 




Warning: Spoilers for The Avengers #7!If any Marvel hero refuses to be bound by his own destiny, it is Thor. As an elder god from Asgard, Thor is very much immortal, hence the title of his new series, Immortal Thor. As such, he has a better perspective on death and destiny than most mortals in the Marvel Universe, even if Thor has opted to ignore his own destined death.




Thor&#39;s ignorance of - or at least his refusal to acknowledge - his own destiny is prevalent in The Avengers #7 by Jed MacKay, C.F. Villa, Federico Blee, VC&#39;s Cory Petit, and Tom Brevoort. The issue sees Thor stare death in the face, something he has anticipated for as long as a millennium leading up to this moment, and yet, he remains in denial of his destiny.

          

Thor&#39;s death is inevitable, he always knew this, but he still refuses to accept it.

 Thor Refuses to Accept His Inevitable Death 
          




The Avengers #7 positions the title characters at the end of the world as they know it. The Black Presbyter is unraveling reality before their eyes just by existing. When all the Earth&#39;s population is destroyed except for the heroes in the middle of the chaos, it&#39;s apparent that all hope is lost. One after another, each Avenger&#39;s life is lost in the battle, and Thor is the first to go. The narration points out that Thor is the only Avenger who always knew he would live to see the end of the world, and his own death that comes with it. &#34;He has had a long time to come to peace with this knowledge. He never did.&#34;



 Thor&#39;s Approach to Death Is a Testament to What Kind of Hero He Is 
          

In retrospect, it&#39;s bittersweet. Not only is his destiny locked in stone, but he&#39;s aware of that destiny and that there&#39;s no way he can stop it, both in regard to his inevitable death and the fact that when the end of the world comes, there is nothing he can do to save it. He just never accepted what is to come, in denial of his own fate. Canonically, Thor has been alive for thousands of years and will continue to live for over a thousand years more, but age and wisdom do not come with clarity. He will forever be stunted by this endless loop and naivety that he can somehow stop what is unstoppable.




At the same time, Thor&#39;s naivety is almost admirable. Thor is not a stupid character, and refusing to accept an inevitable fate does not necessarily mean that he refuses to believe it can&#39;t be prevented. Alternatively, it could also mean that he refuses to remain idle as the world burns, even if he knows he can&#39;t put out the fire. He knows that there&#39;s nothing he can do to stop it, but at the same time, he refuses to do nothing as it happens. It speaks to the kind of hero Thor is and the kind of hero he continues to be in the face of his own immortality.



The Avengers #7 is available now from Marvel.
