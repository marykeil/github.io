What&#39;s impeccable about Doom finally gaining the title of Sorcerer Supreme is that this will see the end of his decades-long campaign to land the role. One of his most notable efforts was in Roger Stern’s and Mike Mignola’s 1989 story Doctor Strange &amp; Doctor Doom: Triumph &amp; Torment, which saw him actually fight Doctor Strange in order to become the Master of the Mystic Arts. Doom eventually lost to Strange, but this saw the beginning of an effort to take the title for himself. In fact, when Stephen Strange met his fate in The Death of Doctor Strange event, Doom arrived at the Sanctum Sanctorum in Strange #1 to battle Clea, only for him to realize that she is even scarier than he anticipated given her ties to the Dark Dimension. Now, years of attempts to become Sorcerer Supreme are coming to an end as he will finally get his wish, and it only means dark days ahead for the Marvel Universe.
