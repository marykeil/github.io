## Literature Review

If Black Cat ever got the Venom symbiote, it could be a nightmare for Spider-Man, and now a new cosplay brings this to life. 




A new piece of Black Cat cosplay reinvents her as a terrifying host for the Venom symbiote. Black Cat and Venom began life as Spider-Man villains, but over the years both have drifted to the side of good, becoming morally ambiguous anti-heroes. Now, acclaimed cosplayer Gracie the Cosplay Lass has brought the two characters together, creating an awesome shoot in which Felicia Hardy becomes the next Venom.




Photographer Nycosplay shared the image in a post on Reddit. The shoot, consisting of three photos snapped at this year’s New York Comic Con, shows Gracie, as Black Cat, mashed up with Venom. Gracie perfectly mixes the look of each character, adding flourishes of her own, such as sharp white spikes sticking out of Black Cat’s arms.


 

Based on Black Cat’s facial expressions, she and the Venom symbiote are working together well–which could be a nightmare for Spider-Man.


 Black Cat and Venom Had Dark Beginnings 
          

Black Cat and Venom, as mentioned earlier, began their careers as Spider-Man villains. Black Cat debuted in the late 1970s and quickly became one of the most intriguing members of the Wall-Crawler’s supporting cast, even becoming lovers at one point. On the other hand, Venom initially sought to kill Spider-Man over a perceived slight. Venom only targeted Spider-Man and he actively avoided killing innocent people. Venom’s popularity ultimately fueled a slide to the heroic side. Black Cat and Venom have gone from Spider-Man foes to uneasy friends.





 

Both Black Cat and Venom never set out to become villains, and their conflicted moralities make them compelling characters. Eddie Brock was a crusading journalist, who thought he had the scoop of the century, one proven false thanks to Spider-Man. Likewise, Black Cat sought to help her father, undergoing extensive physical conditioning and ultimately an experiment that gave her “bad luck” powers. Black Cat’s journey brought her into conflict with Spider-Man. Like Venom, Black Cat refuses to kill innocent people, and it is this that keeps her on Spider-Man’s good side. Just as Black Cat has found a heroic side, so has Venom.

And now Gracie the Cosplay Lass has brought these two anti-heroes together in an amazing new photo shoot. Gracie is known for her amazing cosplays, and this one keeps the tradition going. Gracie has skillfully combined the best parts of each character’s costume to create an awesome, but terrifying, cosplay. The flourishes Gracie has chosen, such as the spikes and the symbiote’s oozy appearance, add another layer to the cosplay. Venom and Black Cat have crossed paths in the comics before, but Gracie the Cosplay Lass’ epic new shoot posits a nightmare situation for Spider-Man, in which Felicia Hardy gets the symbiote.
