## Literature Review

This character is a staple of the Justice League both in the DCEU and in DC Comics, but he finally declares the one team he prefers to work with.





Summary

  Cyborg prefers being a Titan over being a member of the Justice League, viewing his kinship with the Titans as more than just friendship.   Cyborg believes that the Titans are all on equal footing and there is no need for him to try to fit in, unlike with the Justice League.   The distinction between the Titans and the Justice League is that the Titans are seen as actual friends outside their missions, while the Justice League are more like co-workers.  







One member of the Justice League actually prefers being a part of the Titans. Largely thanks to his time in the DCEU, some audiences may more closely associate Cyborg with being a member of the Justice League. However, in DC Comics canon, he seems much more content with being a Titan.

Cyborg expresses how he differentiates the two in Cyborg #5 by Morgan Hampton, Tom Raney, Travis Mercer, Michael Atiyeh, and Rob Leigh. Cyborg has proven to be a prominent teammate of both the Justice League and the Titans, having joined both times at different stages in his life. However, he thinks both teams have enough differences to illustrate why he prefers one over the other.

          

He claims that there&#39;s not &#34;trying to fit in&#34; with the Titans and that they&#39;re &#34;all on equal footing.&#34; This is a huge claim for one of the DCEU&#39;s most prominent Justice Leage members.




                  Cyborg&#39;s Extreme Inhuman Form Reveals His Heartbreaking Worst Fear   Cyborg faces his ultimate fear when the Titans are hit by Insomnia’s Nightmare Wave and Vic Stone’s humanity is taken away from him for good.   


 Cyborg Would Rather Be a Titan than a Justice League Member 
          

Going into Cyborg #5, the city of Detroit, Michigan is being attacked by a bevy of supervillains all at once, including Gizmo, Mammoth, See-More, Atlas (a Teen Titans villain who was just introduced into official DC canon), Billy Numerous, and Jinx. Local superhero Cyborg is nowhere to be found, until the page cuts to Titans Tower, where Cyborg appears through a portal to ask his friends for help.

That&#39;s exactly why he opts to get the Titans&#39; help and why Cyborg prefers being a Titan: he views his kinship with the Titans as more than a simple friendship. He says the difference between being in the Titans and being in the Justice League is that one team — the Titans — is &#34;more than family, if that&#39;s even possible.&#34; The issue itself shows the fan-favorite team going to bat and to battle for the classic Titans member Cyborg, who has been a staple of the team long before he was ever a Justice League member. There is no other team that Cyborg would rather run into battle with than the Titans, because they are the one super-team who make him feel like his complete and best self.






 The Real Difference Between Titans and Justice League 
          

This isn&#39;t the first time that such a distinction has been made between the two DC teams. A past team-up between the Justice League and Titans exposed how the latter view each other as actual friends outside their missions, whereas the former are no different from actual co-workers. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that one team is better than the other, but it does explain why someone may feel closer to one than the other. As someone with experience on both teams, it is understandable why Cyborg may feel closer to the friends he&#39;s made in the Titans than he does with the Justice League.



Cyborg #5 is available now from DC Comics.
