# Thanos Is Responsible For The Birth of Marvel s Deadliest Symbiote


## SUMMARY 



  Thanos&#39; search for the Infinity Stones inadvertantly led to the creation of the Carnage symbiote.   In Venom #20, the Maker theorizes that the Venom symbiote reproduced in response to Thanos&#39; threat, giving birth to Carnage.   Carnage evolved into a cosmic threat on the level of Thanos, over time becoming by far the Marvel Universe&#39;s most dangerous symbiote.

## Literature Review

Thanos is one of the most dangerous aliens in Marvel, and because of him, Earth has to deal with the most deadly serial killer ever known.




There are few beings who can inspire as much fear in the Marvel Universe as Thanos, but one who might come close is Carnage. Carnage is a deranged serial killer who has haunted Earth for a long time, and while on the surface these two characters seem to have nothing in common, one major event makes Thanos directly responsible for Carnage&#39;s birth.




Venom #20 – by Donny Cates, Iban Coello, Ze Carlos, Rain Beredo, and Clayton Cowles – revealed the shared connection between Carnage and Thanos, two major Marvel villains who been significant threats to the universe at different points. During a conversation with the Council of Reeds, the Maker posits the idea that symbiotes do not reproduce randomly.



          

He suggests that they reproduce in response to major cosmic events, which require them to bolster their numbers in order to survive. The Maker specifically points to Thanos searching for the Infinity Stones, which prompted the Venom symbiote reproduced and created the Carnage symbiote, which had drastic consequences for everyone on Earth.

                  Carnage Can Still Be Redeemed, &amp; Marvel&#39;s Darkest Future Proved It   There are few villains in Marvel as sadistic or monstrous as Cletus Kasady, but despite all of that one dark future proves Carnage can be saved.   





 Thanos Prompted The Genesis Of Carnage 


          

One of the Marvel Universe&#39;s most pivotal moments was Thanos using the Infinity Gauntlet to try and wipe out all life in the universe, a cataclysmic situation, which required Marvel&#39;s major characters to come together to stop the villain from completing his genocidal plan. Though Thanos was eventually defeated, this story had long-lasting consequences, one of the most surprising of which Venom #20 revealed to be the creation of the Carnage symbiote. When the Venom symbiote sensed Thanos&#39; threat, it reproduced in order to ensure the symbiote race&#39;s survival. Venom&#39;s offspring, of course, would go on to surpass its progenitor in terms of evil and brutality at every turn.

This reproduction would lead to Cletus Kasady gaining the Carnage symbiote, which became a deadly problem for the Marvel Universe. Though their early appearances saw the Carnage-Kasady connection as an out-of-control, rampaging monster, over time the character has evolved into a cosmic threat on the level of Thanos. The Mad Titan gathered the Infinity Stones to wipe out life in the universe, while Carnage sought to revive the King in Black, seeking to achieve the same end. Though their methods and their motivations differ, the danger to the entire Marvel Universe posed by both is equivalent – and as Venom #20 reveals, Thanos is in a way, responsible for Carnage&#39;s existence.






 Thanos Created Marvel&#39;s Most Dangerous Symbiote 
          

Over time, the details of Marvel&#39;s grand narrative tapestry have a tendency to weave together; major events tend to reverberate out and have consequences, often in unexpected ways, such as Thanos&#39; quest for the Infinity Stones directly leading to the genesis of Carnage, who has proved time and again to be the Marvel Universe&#39;s most dangerous symbiote. As this connection to the &#34;Infinity Saga&#34; in Venom #20 proves, the legacy of Thanos&#39; actions during that storyline is still being defined, with Carnage unexpectedly being the deadliest implication of that classic arc. While a Thanos and Carnage remains a dream match-up for Marvel fans for now, this connection makes the possibility all the more tangible.



Venom #20 was released in 2018. It is available now from Marvel Comics!
