## Literature Review

Fans may have wondered if Shazam can truly beat Black Adam in a fight and now thanks to an upgrade, the Earth’s Mightiest Mortal has an honest answer.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Shazam #7!A key piece of evidence sheds new light on whether Shazam or Black Adam is stronger. For the first time in years, the Big Red Cheese and his polar opposite are getting into an all-out brawl. But one line offers a new twist on who the stronger Champion really is.




In Shazam #7 by Mark Waid and Goran Sudžuka, a crew of alien dinosaurs crosses Black Adam by invading Khandaq&#39;s airspace. They only further anger the fallen Champion by launching a missile that unleashes a flood of paperwork in Kahndaq.

          

Black Adam seeks out revenge on the dinosaurs and tracks them down, but unfortunately for him, Shazam is around and he doesn&#39;t give his foe a chance to harm the alien T. Rexes. Before really getting into the fight, the Captain notes that it&#39;s possible Black Adam is stronger than him. Billy specifically notes that up until now, he still doesn&#39;t know who would win in a fight between him and Black Adam.


 Even Shazam isn&#39;t Sure if He&#39;s Stronger Than Black Adam 
          




After escaping the Rock of Eternity, Billy Batson came home and resumed his life as the Champion of Shazam. However, things didn&#39;t go as expected as Billy found himself being targeted by the six legendary figures he draws his powers from. Zeus, Hercules, and other figures exerted their influence over Billy&#39;s Captain form, desperate to turn him into a servant that would remind Earth&#39;s mortals of the gods&#39; power. Thankfully, Billy was able to resolve the situation peacefully. He even managed to strike a deal with Solomon and now the Mightiest Mortal is wiser than ever.

In his mortal form, Billy Batson would almost certainly say he&#39;s stronger than Black Adam. After all, he&#39;s young and extremely confident in himself. But while in the Captain&#39;s body, Billy is more insightful and honest with himself. Shazam&#39;s increase in wisdom has also boosted his self-awareness, and in his heart-of-hearts, he knows that Black Adam is his ultimate rival. They both possess the same strengths endowed by the Wizard and neither has ever truly been able to triumph over the other. While some may want a firm answer, the Captain can&#39;t honestly say who&#39;s stronger because neither he nor Black Adam has proven it yet.






 The World May Never Know Who&#39;s Stronger Between Black Adam and Shazam 
          

Both Shazam and Black Adam have numerous accomplishments to their name. Billy once helped Superman lift up a book with infinite pages while Black Adam has taken on entire armies of superheroes solo. Over the years they&#39;ve been pretty evenly matched in their fights, no doubt because of their power sources both drawing from the gods. At the very least, it&#39;s nice to know that Shazam can admit his uncertainty. Such wisdom is far more useful in a fight than misguided confidence. Hopefully, a future battle can once and for all settle whether Shazam or Black Adam is stronger.

Shazam #7 is on sale now from DC Comics.
