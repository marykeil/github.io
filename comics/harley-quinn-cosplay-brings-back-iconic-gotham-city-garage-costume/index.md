## Literature Review

Harley Quinn enthusiasts rejoice as a dedicated cosplayer pays homage to the past with a stunning revival of the Gotham City Garage costume.




A Harley Quinn cosplayer has resurrected the iconic Gotham City Garage costume, paying homage to the character&#39;s rebellious roots. The Gotham City Garage series brought a gritty and unique twist to the world of DC Comics, reimagining beloved characters in a post-apocalyptic biker setting. Now, a cosplayer has brilliantly captured the essence of Harley Quinn&#39;s edgy portrayal from this series, blending the chaos and style that define the character.




Harley Quinn’s Gotham City Garage look was brought to life by a brilliant cosplayer named Amanda, who goes by the handle pixiequinncosplay on Instagram. Amanda worked for DC from 2017-2020, and during that time, she contributed to DC Direct’s line of statues called Gotham City Garage, which were the inspiration for the comic series of the same name.


 

Once the Gotham City Garage became a comic book series, Amanda got to model the Harley Quinn look at San Diego Comic-Con. Her stunning cosplay is exceptionally unique, considering that it is based on canon material that she helped create and later promoted.
