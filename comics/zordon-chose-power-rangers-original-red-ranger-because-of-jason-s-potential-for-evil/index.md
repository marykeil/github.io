# Zordon Chose Power Rangers  Original Red Ranger Because of Jason s Potential for Evil


## SUMMARY 



  Zordon chose Jason as the Power Rangers&#39; leader because he saw the error of his ways and has been working to make amends.   Jason and Rita Repulsa have similar backgrounds, with Jason transforming from a schoolyard bully and Rita turning evil due to her father&#39;s influence.   A true Power Rangers leader recognizes their own flaws and works hard to become a better person, just like Jason did.

## Literature Review

The BOOM! Studios Power Rangers comic books finally answer fans&#39; burning question about why Jason in particular was chosen to lead the team.




The Power Rangers comics from publisher BOOM! Studios finally answer the burning question as to why Jason was chosen to lead the Rangers. Few would argue why Jason was the Red Ranger, but there has been debate about why he was the leader. While some would say no one in Ranger history was more qualified to lead a team than Jason, others think someone like Zack should&#39;ve been the team leader.




The debate is put to rest when Zordon explains the shocking reason why he chose Jason to be the Power Rangers&#39; leader in Go Go Power Rangers #4 by Ryan Parrott, Dan Mora, Raul Angulo, and Ed Dukeshire. Ironically enough, possibly even directly responding to the ongoing debates about Zack&#39;s leadership potential, it&#39;s the Black Ranger who first poses the question to Zordon.

          

In an answer that neither readers nor Zack saw coming, Zordon chose Jason because Jason is similar to Rita Repulsa. However, Zordon&#39;s further explanation makes perfect sense and highlights how leaders can be made and tested under scrutiny.

 The Red Power Ranger&#39;s Leadership Role Stems from Rita Repulsa 
          

While Go Go Power Rangers largely depicts the Mighty Morphin team&#39;s earliest adventures before Tommy joined the team, it also provides flashbacks to who they were before becoming Power Rangers. For Jason, he was a schoolyard bully in his childhood before realizing this wasn&#39;t the path to go down, explaining his hate for bullies as a teenager. Rita Repulsa, meanwhile, was a good-natured child under her kind-hearted mother before the influence of her father, Master Vile, instilled evil into her, helping her commit to a life of villainy. Jason dissuaded himself from becoming a bigger bully when he got older, while Rita leaned further into it.

As the team&#39;s second-in-command, Zack has led the team toward a string of successes while Jason was nowhere to be found. It compels Zack to wonder why he wasn&#39;t appointed leader in the first place. Zordon explains the connection between Jason and Rita, saying that, unlike Rita, Jason &#34;saw the error of his ways and has been working to make amends ever since.&#34; Meanwhile, every member of the team has the potential to be a leader. Each member is vulnerable alone, but they bring the best out of each other and inspire each other to be their best whenever they&#39;re together.






 A True Power Rangers Leader is Tested by Correcting Internal Mistakes 
          

A person recognizing a poor quality within themselves and working hard to become a better person exemplifies a natural leader. This is actually a lesson from the original iteration of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. When Tommy breaks free of Rita&#39;s mind control, he works hard to atone for his sins, even when he wasn&#39;t in full control of his actions. Hard work pays off as Tommy is eventually rewarded by becoming the new leader after becoming the White Ranger. The same logic should apply to Jason and should explain why the Red Ranger makes sense as the leader of the Power Rangers.

Go Go Power Rangers #4 is available now from BOOM! Studios.
