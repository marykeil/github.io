# Invincible vs the Hulk Invincible s Creators Agreed 1 Power Settles the Winner


## SUMMARY 



  Invincible&#39;s ability to fly gives him a crucial advantage over the Hulk in a fight.   The Hulk&#39;s inability to fly leaves him vulnerable to attacks that Invincible can easily evade.   While fans may have differing opinions, from a creator&#39;s perspective, Invincible would defeat the Hulk due to his gift of flight.

## Literature Review

Invincible and the Hulk have each fought some of the most intense battles in comics. But how do they stack up against each other? The creators speak.




While Mark Grayson aka Invincible has proven himself to be one of the more powerful superheroes in comics, his true abilities can only be measured by holding them up against a known quotient of power, like the Hulk. Naturally, fans will have differing opinions on which hero is the strongest, but a creator&#39;s insights into characters often give them a unique perspective that sets them apart.




In a video discussion posted to Skybound Entertainment&#39;s YouTube channel, the Invincible creative team of Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker, and Ryan Ottley sit down to discuss how Invincible stacks up against a number of other heroes and villains, including the Hulk. At the time of the discussion, Ottley was working on the Hulk series for Marvel Comics.


 

While fans might intuitively consider the two characters&#39; strength, durability, or resilience as the primary determinant of who is the most powerful, the creators focus their analysis on a completely different metric - one that most fans are likely to consider irrelevant with regard to what makes Invincible and the Hulk so powerful.


 Invincible&#39;s One Power That Will Absolutely Crush The Hulk 
          




Even with the track record that Invincible and the Hulk have established as being among the Earth&#39;s mightiest heroes, the debate about who would win a fight between them ends almost as soon as it begins. Ottley demurs at first before giving Hulk a lukewarm endorsement as the winner. However, Kirkman and Walker immediately pounce on Ottley&#39;s answer as erroneous. Under Kirkman and Walker&#39;s analysis, there&#39;s no question that Invincible would win because he can fly, and the Hulk can&#39;t.

While it is true that the Hulk&#39;s main strengths shine as a ground-based combatant, he has still fought and sometimes defeated more than a few flying superheroes, including the Silver Surfer, Iron Man, Thor, and Captain Marvel. However, Kirkman and Walker are unconvinced by this argument. Indeed, despite the Hulk&#39;s ability to become exponentially stronger as he gets angrier (something likely to happen during a fight), as well as his resilience, regenerative abilities, and the fact that he&#39;s impervious to most injuries, Kirkman and Walker nevertheless believe his inability to fly will be his downfall against Invincible.






 The Amazing Disadvantage Of A Non-Flying Hulk 
          

Ottley pushes back against Kirkman and Walker&#39;s criticism of the Hulk&#39;s inability to fly by pointing to the Green Goliath from the 2021 Hulk series he was working on at the time with Donny Cates and Frank Martin. That iteration of the Hulk can fly, albeit via a jetpack attached to his back. When Kirkman and Walker observe that Invincible wouldn&#39;t have much of a problem separating the jetpack from the Hulk, Ottley responds that when removed, the jetpack will organically reappear. Indeed, the Hulk in Ottley&#39;s comic is - in essence - a ship, piloted by Bruce Banner&#39;s psyche, and powered by the Hulk&#39;s bottomless anger. So removal of the jetpack would immediately spawn a new one, which, depending on how angry the &#34;Hulk Engine&#34; is at the time, can happen within seconds.




Again, Kirkman and Walker are not convinced. Their point is not without reason. In not being able to fly, the Hulk does experience a number of tactical disadvantages that Invincible could exploit. For instance, while the Hulk can jump long distances, he won&#39;t be able to pinpoint his landings or movements in the air like Invincible can. Additionally, flight gives Invincible the ability to escape some of the Hulk&#39;s most devastating attacks, including the Hulk&#39;s &#34;smash&#34; and &#34;hand clap.&#34; Throughout the conversation, Ottley begins to realize the disadvantages of the Hulk&#39;s lack of flight. Clearly, the inclusion of Hulk&#39;s flying ability in his own comic is an obvious recognition by Ottley of its importance and the character&#39;s lack of it. On deeper consideration, Ottley agrees that Invincible would defeat the Hulk in a fight. While some fans may beg to differ, from a creator&#39;s perspective, thanks to his gift of flight, Invincible is the Hulk&#39;s master.
