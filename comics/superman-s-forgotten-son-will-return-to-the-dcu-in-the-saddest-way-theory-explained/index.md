## Literature Review

Superman&#39;s family has been growing since DC&#39;s Rebirth era, but his pre-New 52 son might just be returning to the DCU in a truly tragic way.





Summary

  Superman&#39;s long-forgotten child, Lor-Zod, may be returning in a sad way as General Zod sees a glimpse of who Lor-Zod once was before DC&#39;s continuity resets.   Lor-Zod disobeys Zod and believes his father is growing soft, leading to a heated confrontation between them.   While Lor-Zod is currently a villain, there is a possibility for him to become a hero again, just like his adoptive father, Superman.  







Superman first and long forgotten child may be making his return in a truly sad way. Chris Kent debuted long before the New 52 reboot, and before he was adopted by Lois and Clark, he was known as Lor-Zod, the child of Superman&#39;s nemesis. Now, as General Zod moves forward with his plans on New Krypton, a heated exchange with his own son — a newer version of Lor — gives him a flash of whom Lor-Zod once was and whom he might become again.

Readers can see a glimmer of Lor-Zod&#39;s past in Kneel Before Zod #1 by Joe Casey and Dan McDaid. After Lor-Zod disobeys Zod&#39;s orders and begins exploring a forbidden sector of the planet, the two have a heated confrontation. Lor-Zod believes that his father is growing soft and isn&#39;t as brutal as their people need him to be.

          




This leads to the two trading blows, and while Zod easily overpowers his wayward son, there is a single moment where Zod sees Superman in place of Lor-Zod. While Zod is able to easily shake this off, there could be major implications for him seeing this that relate to DC&#39;s more recent continuity resets.

                  General Zod&#39;s New Empire Exposes the 1 Enemy He Hates More Than Superman   General Zod is one of Superman&#39;s most dangerous enemies, but it&#39;s not actually the Man of Steel who drives the Kryptonian warrior.   


 Lor-Zod Still Exists, but the Memory of Chris Kent Might Also Be Returning 
          

When Lor-Zod first appeared in comic books, he was trapped in the Phantom Zone with his parents, Ursa and Zod. Eventually, Lor-Zod escaped and was adopted by Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Lor-Zod was then renamed to Chris Kent, Superman&#39;s forgotten son. Chris Kent was Superman and Lois&#39; first child, and his adoption was an important moment in their history. Chris came from abusive parents and found a loving home. He discovered that someone isn&#39;t defined by their biological family, and under Clark and Lois, he became a true hero, sacrificing himself to save Earth when Zod escaped the Phantom Zone. Now, with reality once again reset, it seems Lor-Zod has ended up as a villain just like his father — but there may still be good in him.




After the events of Infinite Frontier, DC announced that everything is once again canon — a sweeping statement that leaves a lot of room for conflicting events. It&#39;s possible that Zod remembers fragments of the history wherein Lor-Zod sided with Superman, and that&#39;s why he sees a flash of Superman in his son. Lor-Zod may live on, but Chris Kent is sadly only a memory in the DCU. Another interpretation, however, is that while Lor-Zod is evil now, the core lesson of his character hasn&#39;t been lost. Chris Kent&#39;s original character showed that someone&#39;s biological family doesn&#39;t define who they&#39;ll become. While Lor-Zod is a villain now, Chris Kent was a hero in Superman&#39;s family, and Lor might become a hero again given enough time.

The original first step to Lor-Zod becoming a hero was him getting away from Zod and finding himself in the world. This was originally achieved with Lor-Zod escaping the Phantom Zone and being separated from his father, but in Kneel Before Zod, he&#39;s exiled from New Krypton to prove his strength by Zod. While DC has already announced the Sinister Sons comic, Lor-Zod doesn&#39;t have to stay sinister. He may be starting from a different place, but he could still end up in the same place as the pre-New 52 Chris Kent. If Lor-Zod is given the time and the choices, he may very well prove himself a hero again, just like his once-adoptive father, Superman.
