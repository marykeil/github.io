## Literature Review

Cosplayer Christian Perera has brought Hawkman to amazing life, proving the Thanagarian should be as R-rated as Wolverine. 




An epic new Hawkman cosplay proves the character should have been as R-rated as Wolverine. Mainstream audiences met Hawkman in 2022’s Black Adam movie, but the character’s comic history is rich, stretching back to the Golden Age. More modern interpretations of the character lean on his brutal background on the planet Thanagar. Now, cosplayer Christian Perera has brought Hawkman to amazing life, showing the Thanagarian can be just as savage as Wolverine.




Christian Perera unveiled the cosplay in a post on Instagram. The outfit is inspired by the one Hawkman wore in Black Adam. The cosplay features a number of epic flourishes and details, including the wings and the armor. Hawkman is facing the viewer, daring them to cross him.

 Hawkman Is One of DC&#39;s Most Savage (and Convoluted) Heroes 
          

One of the founding members of the Justice Society of America, Hawkman has a long and convoluted history at DC Comics. There have been multiple incarnations of Hawkman (and Hawkgirl) and generations of creators have struggled to sort them all out. In some versions, he is an archaeologist, and in others, an intergalactic law enforcement official. DC has made several attempts to straighten out the character’s history to varying degrees of success. Modern versions of Hawkman lean into the character’s background as a cop, stressing his sometimes volatile nature. During the New 52 era, he headlined a book titled The Savage Hawkman.




In DC’s new continuity, Hawkman’s constant reincarnations over time are punishment for a lifetime of violence and conquest, and to escape, he must save as many lives as he took. While Hawkman’s most recent comic book version has begun to make peace with his past, the character still has a reputation for violence. Christian Perera’s cosplay perfectly captures these aspects of the character, from the outfit to the look on his face. Perera’s amazing cosplay brings Hawkman to life.

                  Black Adam vs Hawkman Settled DC&#39;s Most Brutal Hero Forever   When the Savage Hawkman met Black Adam above Louisiana, the two entered into a fight that settled DC&#39;s most brutal hero forever.   



 DC Needs to Let Hawkman Cut Loose 
          

Perera’s cosplay also shows the potential for Hawkman to be in the same league as Wolverine. At Marvel, Wolverine has a history of brutality and flying off the handle, with often lethal results. While the current incarnation of Hawkman tempers his violent urges, he still struggles with them and on occasion they get the better of him–just like Wolverine. Over the years, Wolverine has starred in R-rated comics and even movies, and these have done well. There is no reason to doubt that in the proper creative hands, Hawkman too could soar to new heights–if only DC would let him be as savage as Wolverine, as this cosplay proves.
