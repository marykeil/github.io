Summary

  John Constantine&#39;s ultimate form is revealed in Batman Beyond: Neo-Gothic #5. He becomes a sick, twisted, and powerful being after death.   Constantine now refers to himself as the embodiment of the Green, feeling no pain and surpassing death. He is encased in a shadowy black casing.   Despite his dark nature, Constantine still holds heroic qualities and goes out of his way to protect children, showing his true character even in his new form.  







DC Comics has now confirmed the final form of John Constantine after his death. After unveiling Constantine&#39;s protégé — Batman Beyond&#39;s sidekick Kyle — Batman Beyond: Neo-Gothic reveals how Constantine would die. But as should be expected for the master magician, death is not the end for John Constantine.

John Constantine&#39;s ultimate form is revealed to Terry McGinnis and his ally Kyle in Batman Beyond: Neo-Gothic #5 by Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, Max Dunbar, Rain Beredo, and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou. His final form turns the Hellblazer into something sick, twisted, and otherworldly in appearance — but most of all, utterly powerful.



          

Constantine refers to himself as the embodiment of The Green itself. He no longer feels pain, and he has become something beyond death. His body is encased in a shadowy black casing, leaving remnants of his decrepit head behind what remains of a tattered trench coat. Terry and Kyle also learn that Constantine has the missing children they&#39;ve been searching for — not to hurt them, but to save them from the crisis coming to Neo-Gotham.





 Constantine Is a God in His Final Form 
          

At the start of the series, Batman Beyond seeks Kyle the Catboi&#39;s help to find out why children are going missing in Neo-Gotham — and then to find them. Eventually, Batman learns that he&#39;s been tricked for a grift. When he thought he asked Kyle for his help, it was actually Kyle who was using Terry to find a way to get revenge on Constantine, who betrayed him moments after his death by forcing all of his curses onto Kyle. Kyle&#39;s scheming pays off as he and Batman go down an underground garden to find the Green, which encompasses all metaphysical plant life. It&#39;s there that they discover Constantine.

What&#39;s almost endearing about Constantine&#39;s new God state is that even in this new state, he&#39;s clearly still Constantine at his core. As much as Constantine is always a selfish man at heart, something that the series constantly criticizes him for at every turn, there are always heroic qualities he holds that mean he ultimately has a heart of gold. Constantine is never one to hurt a child, and that&#39;s where he usually draws the line. This continues to be the case here, as even when he is known for being dastardly in this series, he goes out of his way to protect children.






 At His Core, Constantine Is Still Constantine 
          

John Constantine is both free and dead at the same time with no traces of fear or pain — just an all-powerful hovering black mass. If Constantine&#39;s &#34;death&#34; in the previous issue brought the character full circle, then this new form confirms that his story is destined to be never-ending. Depending on how readers view John Constantine&#39;s character, that notion is either wholly endearing or an incredibly bittersweet fate.
