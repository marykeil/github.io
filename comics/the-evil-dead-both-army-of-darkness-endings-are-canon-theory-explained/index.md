## Literature Review

A new theory based on an Evil Dead comic suggests that both the theatrical ending and the alternate ending of Army of Darkness are canon.




Warning: Spoilers for Army of Darkness Forever #3!The theatrical ending and the alternate ending of Army of Darkness couldn&#39;t be more different, but both might be canon to the Evil Dead universe. Theatrically, fans will recall the Evil Dead trilogy closing out with Ash returning from medieval times to the present, killing one last Deadite at S-Mart before grabbing a smooch from the girl. An alternate cut, though, ends with Ash returning too deep into the future.




Previously, it was safe to assume that the theatrical ending was the canon one, but Army of Darkness Forever #3 by Tony Fleecs, Justin Greenwood, Brad Simpson, Troy Peteri, Joe Rybandt, Marshall Hoyt suggests that each of these endings might both be canon. Army of Darkness Forever focuses on three congruent storylines acting alongside each other.

          

The story constantly flashes forward and backward between the medieval times that Ash left behind, which is still occupied by evil, the 1993 that Ash (who turns out to be his evil doppelgänger, Evil Ash) returned to, and then the apocalyptic future from the alternate ending. The latest issue reveals how both endings can exist in the same universe.

This series establishes that the Ash who returns to the present in the theatrical cut is actually Evil Ash, putting a much darker spin on the theatrical ending. Throughout the series, Evil Ash is seen talking in the mirror to himself — or, rather, the Middle Ages-era army captain seen in the second sequel — as they try to wait things out for a bigger plan. However, the longer he remains among humanity working a mundane job at S-Mart, the more frustrated and impatient Evil Ash becomes with lying low. He&#39;s ready to just take the world by storm with a bloody riot, but the other Ash talks him out of it.

The Evil Ash&#39;s reflection emphasizes that Evil Ash isn&#39;t looking at the bigger picture. A violent massacre isn&#39;t going to get them what they want like in the medieval times, and there isn&#39;t just a kingdom to conquer. Instead, this Ash wants them to think bigger in the scope of world domination. They make a point to suggest that to take their evil worldwide, they must take advantage of this world&#39;s technology. This could very well set up the reveal that the apocalyptic future of 2093 that the real Ash falls into was created by Evil Ash in the past.

Up until this moment, it would be safe to assume that these storylines depicting the movie&#39;s different endings could be from different timelines or universes, but this issue makes it clear that they&#39;re the same universe. The implication that Evil Ash is the one who brings doom and peril to the planet adds an entirely new, eerie layer to the original dystopian ending. Ash does not just sleep through the end of the world, but he sleeps through his evil counterpart causing the end of the world. As Ash tries to get back what&#39;s left of the Necronomicon, Army of Darkness Forever links two completely different endings to the Evil Dead trilogy into one story.
