# These Unexpected Heroes Served Superman s Most Terrifying Villain a Humiliating Defeat


## SUMMARY 



  Doomsday may be terrifying, but his humiliating defeat at the hands of multiple Kryptonians proves that he&#39;s not as scary as he seems.   Superman considers Doomsday his scariest villain because Doomsday physically overpowered him and beat him to death.   Doomsday&#39;s defeat by a group of Kryptonians shows that he is only truly scary when facing opponents who can&#39;t stand against him.

## Literature Review

Superman has fought many terrifying villains over the years, and Doomsday is the scariest — but he also suffered the most humiliating defeat.




Superman has gone up against monsters that have eaten the sun and the literal god of tyranny, but the scariest villain Superman has ever faced is undoubtedly Doomsday. Despite how terrifying Doomsday is, he was once served an absolutely humiliating defeat that shows maybe he isn&#39;t that scary after all.




Superman is capable of moving faster than sight, has super strength, can fly, and is borderline invulnerable. With such strong abilities, it&#39;s difficult to scare the Man of Steel, but one villain manages to do it. Superman officially names Doomsday as his scariest villain, and it makes sense why Clark would think that. Clark is nearly invulnerable, and he&#39;s stronger than almost anyone else in the universe, but Doomsday is the one villain who managed to not only physically overpower Clark but essentially beat him to death — a type of trauma that Clark had never dealt with before. Despite Doomsday&#39;s strength, one humiliating defeat proves the monster may not be that scary after all.


 Doomsday Is Overwhelmed By Kryptonians 
          

Doomsday&#39;s humiliating defeat takes place in Action Comics #871 by Geoff Johns, Pete Woods, Brad Anderson, and Rob Leigh. This issue is part of the New Krypton storyline, in which the city of Kandor returns to normal size — along with thousands of Kryptonians now living on Earth. Not everyone is happy with this turn of events, and the US government unleashes Doomsday on the Kryptonians to get rid of them. Considering how absurdly dangerous Doomsday is to Superman and his hatred of all things Kryptonian, this is a disastrous choice. But what follows isn&#39;t a tragedy — just total humiliation for Doomsday.




Superman gets his revenge on Doomsday when Doomsday attacks the Kryptonians of Kandor, leading to his ultimate defeat in a matter of minutes. There&#39;s no denying that Doomsday is powerful; he can defeat the Man of Steel in one-on-one combat, which almost no one else has done. But that was Doomsday against one Kryptonian, and when Doomsday faces off against Superman, Supergirl, and about twenty other Kryptonians, he&#39;s instantly and utterly overwhelmed and quickly beaten to death. This shows that, while Doomsday is scary, he&#39;s only scary against people who can&#39;t stand against him. It&#39;s important to note that while Doomsday did beat Superman to death, Superman also beat Doomsday — and he was alone when he did it.



 Doomsday Is Easily Defeated by These Kryptonian Heroes 
          

Doomsday is a horrifying monster, but when he goes up against someone with equal power, he technically loses (even if he brings Superman down with him). But with the New Krypton story, it&#39;s been proven that when Doomsday goes up against multiple people of his power level, it&#39;s no contest at all. Doomsday is not some unstoppable being, as shown when Superman and his Kryptonian friends hand Doomsday his most humiliating defeat yet.
