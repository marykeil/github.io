## Literature Review

Green Arrow is known within DC Comics lore for his iconic trick arrows, but some of these arrows are less iconic and much more bizarre.




Every superhero has their gimmick that makes them stand apart from one another and Green Arrow&#39;s gimmick is that of trick arrows. Like Batman and his utility belt full of gadgets, Oliver Queen uses a variety of trick arrows to different effects to get the job done while he&#39;s out fighting crime. These tools have ranged from classics like his Boxing Glove Arrow to Kryptonite Arrows and even Atomic Warhead Arrows. They&#39;ve helped him taked down plenty of villains, and even the occasional hero turned bad.
However, Green Arrow has existed in comics for decades at this point, and with all the arrows he&#39;s fired over the years, some of them have been truly bizarre. These are the top 10 strangest arrows that Green Arrow has ever used.
            
 
 Green Arrow&#39;s Most Iconic Weapon Just Got a Vicious Upgrade 
Green Arrow’s iconic Boxing Glove Arrow might be a little ridiculous, but its latest adjustment makes it a true force to be reckoned with.












 








 9  The Sun Arrow Literally Creates a Sun 
Adventure Comics #259
        

One of the most baffling arrows that Green Arrow ever used was the &#34;Sun Arrow.&#34; Green Arrow would fire it into the air, and it would expand into a yellow sphere and become illuminated. This trick arrow didn&#39;t have many uses, considering Green Arrow only ever used it once in Adventure Comics #259 by Lee Elias. It&#39;s difficult to imagine who Green Arrow could beat with this trick arrow, which is probably why it was only used once.





 8  Fountain-Pen Arrow Makes Following Bad Guys Easy 
Adventure Comics #129
        

Sometimes when chasing down criminals, it&#39;s easier to just follow them back to their hidden base. When that situation comes up, Oliver has his handy Fountain-Pen Arrow. It&#39;s quite literally just a fountain pen attached to an arrow shaft. He can fire it, so it loops into the back of a car, then draws a line of ink as the car full of criminals makes its escape. While this might seem bizarre, one can&#39;t deny its usefulness, and it was actually a pretty common staple of his quiver back in the day. The Fountain-Pen Arrow first appeared in Adventure Comics #129 by George Papp.





 7  Mirror Arrow Lets Oliver Spy On His Foes 
World&#39;s Finest Comics #70
        

One of the key parts of capturing criminals is first finding evidence. A major way to get evidence is through surveillance, which Green Arrow achieved by strapping several mirrors and a helicopter rotor to an arrow. He would then fire it in a general direction, and thanks to the mirrors, he&#39;d be able to see at angles he couldn&#39;t normally see from. The mirrors also doubled as things Oliver could ricochet arrows off of. This ridiculous trick arrow was first seen in World’s Finest Comics #70 by George Papp.





 6  Hypnotic Arrow Puts Oliver Under Its Sway 
Adventure Comics #251


 







Green Arrow has tons of weird arrows that he&#39;s used over the years, but one of the stranger ones actually came from the future. It turns out that Green Arrow has fans from the year 3,000 AD, and wanting to help their hero, they sent him a one-of-a-kind Hypnotic Arrow. When fired this arrow releases a dazzling display of light that hypnotizes anyone who sees it. Unfortunately, in a rare example of clumsiness, Oliver drops the arrow. This resulted in both he and Speedy being hypnotized while a pair of criminals robbed them. This arrow was first and only seen in Adventure Comics #251 by Jack Kirby and Roz Kirby.





 5  Anti-Gravity Arrow Helps Oliver Soar Through the Air 
Adventure Comics #251
        

Here&#39;s another arrow that was sent from the future to Green Arrow by his adoring fans. This arrow completely defied gravity, allowing anyone or anything attached to it to soar through the air. While this doesn&#39;t seem terribly useful, considering there didn&#39;t seem to be any weight restriction, the possibilities for it were endless. Unfortunately, Green Arrow didn&#39;t get to use this arrow himself. The criminal Cougar Cain stole this from Green Arrow and went on a crime spree with it, along with a few others. The crime spree of Cougar Cain was documented way back in Adventure Comics #251 by Jack Kirby and Roz Kirby.





 4  Invisibility Arrow Makes Its User Disappear 
Adventure Comics #251
        

This is one of the more bizarre arrows that Green Arrow had simply because of the fact it&#39;s never really explained how it works at all. It was the final arrow sent to Green Arrow from future fans and was used by Cougar Cain in his crime spree, as seen in Adventure Comics #251 by Jack Kirby and Roz Kirby. This arrow appears to hover above the user, turning them and any nearby allies completely invisible. It&#39;s not exactly clear how the arrow does this, or why it turns the person and their clothing invisible, but not their guns.





 3  Baby Rattle Arrow Calms Down Infants in a Pinch 
Adventure Comics #265


 







Green Arrow helps his city just as Batman does, not just through fighting crime but also by donating to charities and trying to make the lives of the citizens better. This was best seen in Adventure Comics #265 by Robert Bernstein and Lee Elias. Green Arrow opens a camp for underprivileged children, and in trying to thank him, they make him a bunch of arrows. The arrows are all pretty much useless, but thanks to Green Arrow&#39;s quick thinking, he&#39;s able to find some use for them. The baby rattle arrow was created to shoot at babies in case they were in a scary situation, to calm them down. Green Arrow instead uses it to frighten a criminal who is deathly afraid of rattlesnakes, showing that even the most useless arrow will always be useful in the hands of Oliver Queen.





 2  Aqua-Lung Arrow Helps Oliver Explore the Deep Ocean 
World&#39;s Finest #97
        

Sometimes a vigilante just has to go into the deep ocean to fight a giant mechanical octopus. It doesn&#39;t happen often, but it did happen to Green Arrow in World&#39;s Finest #97 by Ed Herron, Jack Kirby, and Roz Kirby. This comic saw Green Arrow pull out the baffling Aqua Lung Arrow, which was essentially an oxygen mask stuffed onto the end of an arrow, for some reason. Even Speedy seems to be having trouble believing that Oliver has done this, judging by his expression in the one panel where this arrow appeared. Ultimately, the duo were able to defeat the giant mechanical octopus and then the Aqua Lung Arrow was never used again.





 1  Mind-Reading Arrow Isn&#39;t Quite What It Seems 
Adventure Comics #215


 







This is easily the most ridiculous trick arrow that Green Arrow has. According to Green Arrow himself, once he fires this arrow off, it can read the mind of everyone it passes over, before returning to Oliver and printing out their thoughts for him to read. Unfortunately, this isn&#39;t actually true. This arrow was seen way back in Adventure Comics #215 by George Papp. This story saw Green Lantern dealing with a criminal known as the Gagster. The Gagster was lured to a show where Oliver was showing off this fantastical arrow, and of course, he tried to steal it. This is when Oliver revealed that the arrow was a fake, it couldn&#39;t read minds, and it only had a tracker in it that allowed Oliver to track the Gagster down. Still, for one moment, both readers and the Gagster believed that Oliver truly had an arrow that could read minds, which makes it the most ridiculous trick arrow that Green Arrow has ever had.
