Enter the all-ape JUNGLE L(ee-ee)gue. Can this team of hero-eek anthropoids be the salv-ape-tion we need, or will Mallah’s team of maniacal monkeys bring forth the ape-pocalypse? Get ready to go bananas as we honor DC’s storied history with mankind’s closest relatives in this ape-ic adventure! It’s gonna be orangu-tastic, so heat up a capuchin-o, prepare a batch of chocolate chimp cookies, and get ready to r(ee-ee)d the one comic b(oo-oo)k this year that’s guaranteed to make you go…APE!   






Set for release on March 19, 2024, this amusing nod to Crisis on Infinite Earths sparks laughter and raises questions about the extent to which other elements of the classic narrative will be woven into the fabric of this eagerly anticipated March-bound special.


 Superman and Supergirl’s Crisis on Infinite Earths Cover Gets a Monkey-Inspired Twist 


          

Crisis on Infinite Earths is one of DC&#39;s most iconic and transformative storylines, bringing together the publisher&#39;s greatest heroes—Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and more—in an effort to thwart the Anti-Monitor&#39;s systematic destruction of alternate Earths. Among the memorable moments is George Perez&#39;s iconic cover for Crisis on Infinite Earths #7, depicting Superman cradling Supergirl&#39;s lifeless body after she falls in battle. Bernard Chang injects a dose of dark humor into this poignant scene in DC&#39;s Ape-ril Special #1 by creating a cover that humorously replaces Superman with Monkey Prince and Supergirl&#39;s fallen form with a limp banana peel.




DC&#39;s Ape-ril Special #1 promises an exhilarating departure from the norm with its one-shot anthology featuring an all-ape superhero team known as the Jungle League. With characters like Beppo the Super-Monkey, Monkey Prince, and Detective Chimp, this unconventional league is tasked with thwarting the nefarious plans of Monsieur Mallah and his new Legion of Doom. The narrative unfolds in a manner unlike anything DC has ventured into before, presenting a superhero team like none other. While this unique premise guarantees a distinct and memorable reading experience, the story is poised to be an unforgettable and enjoyable one-off, showcasing DC&#39;s vast and imaginative storytelling.

The upcoming release of DC&#39;s Ape-ril Special has piqued considerable curiosity among fans, particularly in anticipation of whether the storyline will share any thematic or narrative elements with the iconic Crisis on Infinite Earths beyond Chang&#39;s clever homage to Perez&#39;s emotional cover. The prospect of uncovering subtle nods, thematic parallels, or unexpected connections between the two stories adds an extra layer of intrigue to the comic special. Exploring potential intersections between the classic Crisis storyline and the all-ape superhero ensemble promises an engaging and nostalgic journey for readers that goes beyond the tribute to DC&#39;s most iconic Superman and Supergirl featured cover.
