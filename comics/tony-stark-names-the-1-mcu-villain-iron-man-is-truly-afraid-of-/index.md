## Literature Review

Iron Man has faced some of the worst villains Marvel has, but there is one surprise MCU foe that truly scares him.




Warning: contains spoilers for The Invincible Iron Man #12!Tony Stark has named the one MCU villain that Iron Man is truly afraid of. Over the past 60 years, Iron Man has faced nearly every villain the Marvel Universe has to offer, ranging from Doctor Doom to Korvac, and walked away triumphant each time. Yet as seen in The Invincible Iron Man #12, there is one shocking villain, who has also made waves in the MCU, that Iron Man is intimidated by.




Iron Man spills the beans in “Patron Saint,” appearing in The Invincible Iron Man #12, written by Gerry Duggan and drawn by IG Guara. While Riri Williams squares off with Emma Frost, Tony Star and the Kingpin are in a laboratory at a branch of the Hellfire Club. Tensions between Tony and Fisk are at an all-time high, and as the Kingpin’s ire grows, Tony begins to panic.

          

Tony says he has fought some of the worst villains, such as Thanos and Obadiah Stane, as well as Captain America–and none were more intimidating than the Kingpin.


 Kingpin Is an Unlikely Ally to the X-Men 
          




War makes for strange bedfellows, and Kingpin and Iron Man working together is proof. Both Fisk and Iron Man have become allies of mutantkind in the wake of Orchis’ attack on this year’s Hellfire Gala. This horrific event ended with numerous mutants exiled from Earth and many more killed or taken into custody. Iron Man and the Kingpin have joined a new incarnation of the Hellfire Club, and while they may have a common enemy, the two are still on opposite sides of the law. As seen in this issue, Iron Man is legitimately afraid of Kingpin.


 

Despite his lack of superpowers, the Kingpin is one of the scariest villains in both the Marvel Universe and the MCU, and Iron Man is right to be afraid. During his reign of terror, the Kingpin has ruined numerous lives, both superpowered and not. Daredevil learned the hard way what happens when Kingpin is crossed, and Fisk would have no qualms about doing the same to Iron Man. However, there are more pressing issues at hand, namely turning back Orchis, and this has created a truce between the two. When the threat of Orchis is banished, sparks will fly between Iron Man and Kingpin.

 Should Iron Man Fear the Kingpin? 
          

While Iron Man and the Kingpin’s paths have rarely crossed, it seems as if Marvel is seeding a potential future conflict between the two, and it is a surprise they have not fought sooner. Both are highly successful in business, having established corporate empires through dubious means: Kingpin in racketeering and Iron Man in munitions. Yet Fisk never had the epiphany Tony Stark did, becoming one of the most dangerous men in the Marvel Universe, and one of the few MCU villains that actually scares Iron Man.
