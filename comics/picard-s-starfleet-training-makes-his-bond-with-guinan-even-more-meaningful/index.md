## Literature Review

Events in Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy reveal how Picard gained the skills needed for him to be able to seek Guinan&#39;s counsel in The Next Generation.




One of the most celebrated relationships in Star Trek is between Jean-Luc Picard and Guinan, and while Paramount&#39;s Picard TV show revealed how Guinan first learned of Picard, a prequel comic from Picard&#39;s Academy days now shows why he would later be able to connect with her in Star Trek: The Next Generation. The revelation Picard makes in this prequel comic shares similarities with what the overall series is about - Picard learning how to become a great captain.




In Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy #3 - by writer Sam Maggs, artist Ornella Greco, colorist Charlie Kirchoff, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry - Picard suffers a humiliating defeat during a group practice session for an upcoming exam. Luckily, Picard&#39;s classmates Doq and Marty help the future captain open up about his insecurities.

          

Doq and Marty first convince Picard to express his fears before they share their own with him. The unofficial counseling session clearly has a positive effect on the young Picard. He later reflects on how helpful it was, remarking on the irony that he always thought that sharing one&#39;s fears was a weakness.


 Sharing His Fears With Guinan Helped Picard Save Data 
          




This experience can easily be marked as a precursor to his meaningful future relationship with Guinan aboard the Enterprise-D. Picard seeks Guinan&#39;s counsel on many occasions, many of which help Picard make important decisions. The first and most notable instance in The Next Generation episode &#34;The Measure of a Man&#34; is especially relevant, since Picard confesses a fear to Guinan much like he does with Doq and Marty in Picard&#39;s Academy. In &#34;The Measure of a Man,&#34; Picard&#39;s fear is losing a case that would allow the Federation to treat Data like property. Upon hearing what Picard&#39;s fear, Guinan is able to help Picard use that realization to understand the implications of losing the case, which the captain leverages to identify his winning strategy. Guinan&#39;s most consequential advice to Picard, however, is undoubtedly given during her counsel on the Nexus, which helps divert the destruction of the Enterprise-D in the movie Star Trek: Generations.



 Picard Learning To Rely On Others Makes Him A Great Captain 
          




Similar to learning the importance of seeking counsel in Picard&#39;s Academy, the events in the prequel comic have proven to be most beneficial for the eponymous future captain in other ways. As showcased in The Next Generation, Picard is renowned for his ability to effectively delegate and to seriously consider the suggestions from his crew, a form of guidance he actively seeks. However, Picard&#39;s Academy clearly indicates that Picard didn&#39;t always espouse this mentality. He was originally a loner who thought that relying on others was a weakness. Luckily, Picard&#39;s Academy has already shown him learning the importance of camaraderie, a skill that will help him become the amazing captain everyone knows him to be.

Now, IDW&#39;s series is effectively demonstrating how Picard&#39;s days at Starfleet Academy provided him with the necessary knowledge and experience to help him emotionally connect with Guinan as captain, a relationship that will become one of the most important bonds in not only all of Star Trek, but fiction.
