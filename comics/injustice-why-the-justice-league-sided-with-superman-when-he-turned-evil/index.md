# Injustice Why the Justice League Sided with Superman When He Turned Evil


## SUMMARY 



  Superman&#39;s success in the Injustice Universe was largely due to the support of his Justice League allies, who each had their own unique reasons for joining him.   Wonder Woman&#39;s character in the Injustice Universe was drastically changed after her discovery that Steve Trevor was a Nazi agent, leading her to embrace Superman&#39;s dark methods.   The Flash initially supported Superman but eventually had a crisis of conscience and decided to betray him, realizing that Superman&#39;s brutality needed to be stopped.

## Literature Review

In the Injustice Universe, a cruel version of Superman took over the world — something he only accomplished by having the Justice League on his side.




Superman may be the core villain of the Injustice Universe, but he would never have accomplished world domination without his Justice League allies at his side. Though not every League member decided to side with Superman, many embraced his cruel methods with their own unique reasonings.




One of the darkest universes that DC has ever explored is the universe of Injustice, which was inspired by the Injustice: Gods Among Us video game and then spanned multiple comic-book series. In this universe, Superman lost Lois Lane along with his entire city of Metropolis. This loss pushed Superman over the edge, and he took over the world in response. But the Man of Steel couldn&#39;t have taken over the world alone. With so many powerful members of the Justice League, surely others would have stood against him. Surprisingly, the majority of the League didn&#39;t reject Superman, and they each had a unique reason why.


 Wonder Woman&#39;s Dark Injustice Origin 
          

Superman never would have succeeded in the Injustice world without Wonder Woman. Wonder Woman was his right hand and was the one continually pushing Superman further and further down the path of darkness. This version of Wonder Woman was wildly out of character, because, unlike her DCU counterpart, she was brutally cruel and bloodthirsty. DC tried to address this by changing her backstory: instead of meeting Steve Trevor and coming to the land of man with good intentions, Wonder Woman discovered that Steve was a Nazi agent. He had been manipulating Wonder Woman, and, especially after she killed him, this greatly changed her character and outlook on life, leading her to join with Superman&#39;s Regime.






 Cyborg Lost All of the Titans 
          

Cyborg is traditionally a member of the Teen Titans, and, while he has been in the Justice League, his true home will always been with the Titans. But when Metropolis was destroyed by the Joker in the Injustice Universe, the Titans happened to be in town that day. Unfortunately, almost all of them were killed instantly in the blast. This made Cyborg far more sympathetic to Superman&#39;s ideas of taking over the world. Superman lost his city and his family, and Cyborg lost his family in the exact same disaster, meaning, when the time came, Cyborg happily sided with Superman.



 Aquaman Prioritized Atlantis&#39; Interests 
          




While Aquaman has been a regular member of the Justice League, Aquaman is also the king of Atlantis, and sometimes he has to pick which role he must prioritize. When Superman began to take over the world, Aquaman wanted to show his strength and to demonstrate that the oceans only answer to Arthur — even if Superman ruled the land. Arthur tried to show this by having the armies of Atlantis arrive at every single beach on Earth, but he never expected Superman to respond how he did.

Seeing Arthur&#39;s display of strength, Superman showed his own by lifting Atlantis out of the ocean and dropping it in the Sahara desert. After this, Aquaman was seen at a meeting with Batman, seemingly planning to attack Superman&#39;s Regime. But Aquaman apparently decided against this, because he doesn&#39;t appear in the comic much after, and in the video game Aquaman is firmly on Superman&#39;s side.



 The Flash&#39;s Conflicting Feelings about Superman 
          




Out of everyone who joined Superman&#39;s Regime, the Flash had the most doubts. The Flash promised Superman he&#39;d be there for him to help and support him after the death of Lois, but as Superman&#39;s methods became increasingly brutal, the Flash had a continual crisis of conscience. It started out small when he saw Superman and Wonder Woman gravely injure a young man who tried to stand up to them. Then the Flash witnessed Superman completely obliterate the invading Parademons.

From there, Superman only kept getting more and more brutal until the Flash defected to Batman&#39;s side to help bring down Superman. It took a long time, and it took things like the Regime intentionally orchestrating Alfred&#39;s death to hurt Batman, but the Flash did eventually betray the Man of Steel — because he knew Superman had to be stopped.



 Shazam Naively Admired Superman 
          




Shazam was one of the members of Superman&#39;s Regime who expressed his doubts the most. Given the nature of his powers, Shazam still had the innocence of a young boy, and he truly wanted to do what was right. At the beginning, he believed Superman was right because there is no hero more righteous and pure than Superman. Shazam ended up following Superman&#39;s lead and helping him enforce his will on the world because he truly thought that, at the end of the day, what they were doing was for the greater good.

Unfortunately, this turned out to be the wrong choice. In &#34;Year Five,&#34; when Shazam finally decided to turn against Superman, it was too late: Superman brutally killed Shazam for his betrayal.



 Green Lantern Pitied Superman 
          

Green Lantern was present when Metropolis was destroyed and was one of the first people who tried to prevent Superman from killing the Joker. Hal Jordan had a front-row seat to all of the Injustice action and found it hard not to empathize with Superman after seeing the tragedy up close. While Hal Jordan did express some discomfort with Superman&#39;s ideas — such as building a super-powered army — Hal ended up going along with them anyway.




This reached a breaking point when the other Green Lanterns decided to stand against Superman, leading to Hal losing his Green Lantern powers. With nowhere else to turn, Hal Jordan became a Yellow Lantern. This event pretty much sealed Hal&#39;s fate as a &#34;servant&#34; in Superman&#39;s Regime.



 Hawkgirl&#39;s Muddled Injustice Backstory 
          

Hawkgirl is an extremely strange case among the Justice League members who sided with Superman&#39;s Regime. Throughout the first three years of the timeline, she was on Superman&#39;s side and dutifully carried out his will. The biggest role she had in Injustice was being kidnapped by Batman so that he could replace with Martian Manhunter, who then served as a spy on Superman&#39;s team. After &#34;Year Three,&#34; Hawkgirl rarely appeared, and she didn&#39;t have much of a role in the story.




In the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, it&#39;s stated that Hawkgirl was on Superman&#39;s Justice League purely because she was brainwashed into joining. The game&#39;s ending explicitly explains that she eventually broke out of Superman&#39;s brainwashing. But this plot point was never touched on in the comics, nor was it ever mentioned who was responsible for brainwashing her.



 Damian Wayne Believed Superman Was Right 
          

While Damian Wayne isn&#39;t technically a Justice League member in the main DCU, he would eventually join the League in this universe. Robin Damian Wayne&#39;s origin had him as a borderline villain who had absolutely no issue with using lethal force. Over time, he was pulled out of the darkness and saved by his father and the good influence of the Bat-Family. But in the Injustice Universe, seeing Superman kill the Joker prevented this series of events from happening. Damian fully believed that criminals deserved to die, and, seeing Superman&#39;s actions follow that logic, it was impossible to prevent Damian from joining Superman&#39;s Regime and betraying Batman.




The Injustice Universe is truly one of DC&#39;s darkest alternate Earths, as some of the most iconic superheroes of all time embrace cruelty and fascism. Superman may have earned the respect of some Justice Leage members in this universe, but their complicated reasons for joining him prove that each case is unique — and thus that Injustice Superman isn&#39;t in the right, despite his famous roster of allies.



The Injustice comic books are available now in various formats from DC Comics, both digitally and in print.
