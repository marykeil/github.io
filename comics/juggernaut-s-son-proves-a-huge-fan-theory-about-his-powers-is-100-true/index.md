## Literature Review

With the last few issues of X-Men comics, one question/theory has been raised in regard to his powers, something which his son, J2, already confirmed.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for X-Men #28 J2, the son of the Juggernaut within Marvel Comics’ MC2 universe, inherited his father’s powers and used them to become a superhero, along with the children of other major superheroes and antiheroes. While J2’s storyline is interesting enough as is, the latest chapter of X-Men lore over in the prime reality of Earth-616 just made it so much more interesting, as J2’s mere existence proves that one huge fan theory about the Juggernaut’s powers is 100% true.




Zane Yama aka J2 made his debut in What If? #105, which would eventually spin off into a new established corner of the Marvel Comics multiverse (the previously mentioned MC2, designated Earth-982). It was at this point that Zane would get his own comic series - J2 by Tom DeFalco and Ron Lim - and J2&#39;s connection with his father the Juggernaut would be fully explored.

          

Every X-Men fan knows that Cain Marko became the Juggernaut after he found the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak and agreed to be Cyttorak’s avatar on Earth. He wasn’t born with this power, and he didn’t get it through weird experimentation or a million-to-one accident. Otherworldly magic is what gave the Juggernaut his powers, which has led one modern supervillain (and fans) to ask: could those powers be transferred through non-magical means? Well, if J2’s existence is to be considered, then the answer is yes - which could prove detrimental to the entire Marvel Universe.





 J2 Proves Dr. Stasis’ Plan For Stealing Juggernaut’s Powers WOULD Work 
         

In X-Men #28 by Gerry Duggan and Joshua Cassara, the Juggernaut is in custody within an Orchis facility following the anti-mutant organization’s detrimental attack on mutantkind. Dr. Stasis - a clone of Mister Sinister - is a leader within Orchis, as well as the organization’s lead scientist.

In the previous issue, Stasis said that he wanted to do a blood transfusion on the Juggernaut to see if Cain Marko’s mystical powers could be transferred to someone else (presumably himself) through biological means. But, before Dr. Stasis (or fans) could find out if that was even possible, the Juggernaut escaped. However, thanks to the existence of J2, fans already got their answer - even if Stasis is still momentarily in the dark.



 The Marvel Universe Became A Much Deadlier Place Because of Juggernaut’s Son 
          




Dr. Stasis wanted to use the Juggernaut’s DNA to copy his powers and utilize them for Orchis. While Orchis is currently just an anti-mutant organization, it won’t stop until the entire world is under its control (something that’s been shown many times throughout Marvel’s countless Sentinel-run future timelines). This means that, if Stasis was able to copy the Juggernaut’s powers, then it would be to the detriment of the entire world. But, with the Juggernaut having already escaped, Dr. Stasis can’t run the tests he needs to in order to ascertain whether copying the Juggernaut’s powers is even possible through non-magical means. However, J2 proved that it is, which means that if Dr. Stasis gets his hands on the Juggernaut’s DNA again, fans already know that he’ll be successful in transferring that power, just as they’ve theorized since Dr. Stasis revealed his plan in X-Men #27.

What began as just a theory that seemed destined to go unanswered has become a terrifying reality for all the enemies of Dr. Stasis and Orchis, as the Juggernaut’s son - by simply existing - proves Cain Marko’s powers can be transferred through blood and DNA.




X-Men #28 by Marvel Comics is available now.
