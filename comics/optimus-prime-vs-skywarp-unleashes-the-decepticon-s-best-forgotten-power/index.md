## Literature Review

As Optimus Prime battles Skywarp, he gets a nasty surprise when the Decepticon hands out a devastating blow thanks to a little known power.




Warning: contains spoilers for Transformers #3!Transformers&#39; new Energon Universe continuity just made use of a Decepticon’s underutilized power, giving none other than Optimus Prime a run for his money. The latest issue of Skybound’s Transformers series sees Skywarp make use of a power many fans forgot the Decepticon even had, and the results are devastating.




Transformers #3 continues the story where creators Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten left off in the previous issue, as the Autobots race to beat the Decepticons before they can trash the small town they’ve awoken in. Frustrated at their lack of progress in repairing their brethren, the group&#39;s leader Starscream sends his Seeker brother Skywarp out to find useful materials.



          

Meanwhile, several of the human characters are attacked by the Decepticon Laserbeak, which kicks off another epic showdown between the Autobots and Decepticons. As the Robots in Disguise clash with each other and the humans alike, Skywarp finds himself facing off against Optimus Prime. Although outmatched in a straight fight, the Seeker has an ace up his sleeve: Skywarp is the only Transformer who has the power to teleport.

Skywarp&#39;s Forgotten Power Is a Game-Changer


          

In a moment that Daniel Warren Johnson depicts beautifully, Skywarp uses his teleportation to gain the upper hand on Optimus. Skywarp teleports his hand behind Optimus, using the element of surprise to grab the Autobot leader and smash him face-first into the ground.

As one of the three Seekers, Skywarp completes the trifecta with his Sky Brothers Starscream and Thundercracker. Thundercracker was almost resurrected in the first issue, until Optimus Prime destroyed the Teletraan I supercomputer which repaired the dormant Transformers. The Autobots still have their hands full with the Decepticons revived thus far, with Optimus barely surviving his encounters with Starscream in the first issue and Skywarp here in the third. If and when Megatron makes his grand debut in the Energon Universe, fans can expect a showdown of epic proportions… perhaps even a fight to the death.

By utilizing Skywarp&#39;s power in a creative way, the Energon Universe era of Transformers continues to establish its connection to the past while also blazing a path forward for the franchise’s future. It will be exciting to see what the creators have in store for fans in the coming issues, and how they will continue to build off of the classic G1 era in creating this new continuity. With the first issue breaking sales records for Hasbro in recent years, the franchise looks to be the talk of the industry for the foreseeable future. It’s definitely never been a better time to be a Transformers fan.

Transformers #3 is available now from Skybound Entertainment.
