## Literature Review

The Flash’s new powers are keying him into the strangest, unseen parts of the DC Universe. Discover the six new layers of DC’s reality.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for The Flash #3!Thanks to the Flash&#39;s new power, fans are getting a peak at the secret layers of reality that make up the DC Universe. Wally West&#39;s new glitching ability has added a wild card factor into his life, and now it&#39;s opening his eyes to the hidden world all around him.




In The Flash #3 by Si Spurrier and Mike Deodato, Jr., Max Mercury arrives to help Flash with his new dimensional shift powers. Wally shows Max one level, a psychic ecosystem that Flash calls the &#39;Blobsphere&#39;. Afterward, the two go a little deeper and discover the &#39;spooky layer&#39;, a realm of lingering dead.

          

Flash&#39;s old nemesis the Folded Man drags Wally and Max down to a layer that embodies natural law similar to the Green and the Red. Another appears to be a creepy realm that speedsters cannot escape from. The Folded Man hangs out on the lowest level, a stark white void. But Wally goes one rung lower to a serene, quiet layer he calls the Gallery of Moments.


 The Flash Has Charted the DCU&#39;s Most Mysterious Realms Ever 
          




For months now, the Flash has been dealing with his new glitching powers ever since an upgraded Mirror Master caused Wally to crash through an atomic mirror. Ever since then, the Fastest Man Alive has been experiencing shifts into other dimensions that reveal hidden horrors all around him on different planes of existence. At the same time, aberrations within the Speed Force began popping up, sending out signals to every speedster in the DC Universe. To make matters worse, Gorilla Grodd began conducting strange experiments and wound up bringing a horrific, extradimesional creature known as the Uncoiled to the DC Universe.

It&#39;s not just that Flash is discovering these new planes, he&#39;s discovering how one layer of reality impacts another. While in the blobsphere, Wally realizes that things are exploding because of speedsters running on the topmost layer of reality. Flash also encounters things called mathshrooms that can change the laws of nature simply by inhaling them. All the layers that Wally encounters are all in the same physical space, just at different angles. But Flash is finding out that small actions can have big consequences. Since Wally&#39;s the only speedster who can glitch between layers, he&#39;s got a serious weight on his shoulders as he explores these new realms.






 Only Flash Can Keep Every Layer of Reality Safe 


          

Wally West is the only speedster who can easily access these dimensions, and for all the oddities and horrors that lurk within them, it&#39;s in Flash&#39;s nature to protect. He&#39;s got a lot to learn about how the blobsphere, the spooky realm, the Gallery of Moments and every other layer connect, and how they impact the realm he lives in (and vice versa). Thankfully, Wally is a quick learner and he&#39;s already come a long way in the short time he&#39;s had these powers. As long as Flash discovers how these new layers of reality work, then he should have no problem keeping them all safe.

The Flash #3 is on sale now.
