## Literature Review

The Hulkbuster armor was made specifically to take out the behemoth that is the Incredible Hulk, with a new cosplay giving Punisher his very own set!




In Marvel Comics, The Punisher is an elite anti-hero with a specific set of battle-tested skills he uses to take out even the most powerful and deadly of threats, with his penchant for fighting crime in brutally efficient ways making him one of the most dangerous characters around. And when donning his own Hulkbuster armor in an inspired new cosplay design, Frank Castle is given the tools to take on the Green Goliath himself, The Hulk.




Shared on social media via Instagram by Brent H (@bearded_tattooed_guy_in_ga), this cosplay account specializes in dreaming up and then creating larger-than-life costumes that are spot-on representations of some of the most oversized heroes in all of comics.


 

Dressing as the Spider-Man villain known as The Rhino, the X-Men villain called Juggernaut, and even a fully armored Batman from Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice fame, Brent excels when bringing to life heroes and villains that need far more attention and care in their real-world transition, with this new Hulkbuster cosplay design being no exception.

                  Giant Hulkbuster Cosplay Unleashes Iron Man&#39;s Most Intimidating Armor   This colossal Hulkbuster cosplay breathes life into Iron Man&#39;s most formidable armor, fortified in a way not even the Hulk could smash.   





 Punisher Gets His Own Set of Hulkbuster Armor in New Cosplay Clips 

 

A set of armor made by Tony Stark, the billionaire playboy of the Marvel Universe, it’s a well-known fact that Iron Man always has another crime-fighting suit waiting in the wings for the next epic battle, with the Hulkbuster being hands down one of the most overpowered designs, and for good reason. Memorably introduced into the live-action space during the events of the MCU’s Avengers: Age of Ultron, the Hulkbuster armor debuted in comics in 1994’s Iron Man #304, where its Hulk-level strength and behemoth size allowed Iron Man to survive for far longer in a fight that would have still most likely ended in his defeat.

A cosplay brought to fans’ attention in two short clips taken at the recent Dreamhack convention in Atlanta, Brent’s dedication to creating a life-sized Hulkbuster cosplay is immediately apparent as his design perfectly marries the armor’s gigantic proportions with Punisher’s blacked-out skull-branded look. Seen walking around the convention space in the first video and dancing around showing off the suit’s range of motion in the next, it’s the suit’s towering height, slightly battle-worn armored plates, gauntlets, large helmet, and its clever use of Punisher’s iconic and controversial logo on its chest, head, and shoulders that makes this homemade costume sing, something made even more epic considering this specific Punisher x Hulkbuster cosplay look hasn’t been seen before in Marvel Comics.






 New Marvel Cosplay Gives The Punisher Hulk-Defeating Power 
          

So while Punisher has donned his own set of Iron Man armor before when he took on the role of War Machine in 2017’s The Punisher #218, by Matthew Rosenberg and Guiu Vilanova, this is the first time fans get to see him wearing a heavy-duty suit that could take out the Hulk with ease. The Punisher isn’t a character who shies away from a fight, especially when armed to the teeth with weapons that would put most Marvel heroes to shame, and now, with Frank getting his own Hulkbuster armor thanks to Brent H (@bearded_tattooed_guy_in_ga), he gets one of the best looks this character has ever had.
