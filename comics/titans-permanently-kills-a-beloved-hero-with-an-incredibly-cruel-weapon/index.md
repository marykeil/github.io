## Literature Review

One hero has left the ranks of the Titans forever. However, their death was neither gentle nor quick, dying in the most gruesome way possible.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans: Beast World #4!




DC has made the questionable decision to officially eliminate one of its core Titans members—Beast Boy. However, the true tragedy lies not in his death but in the brutal manner in which it unfolded. Garfield&#39;s demise was anything but peaceful or swift; instead, it unfolded as a torrent of agony and gore, orchestrated by an unimaginably cruel weapon and even crueler bearer.

Titans: Beast World #4, by Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer, delves deeper into the chaos of DC&#39;s latest crisis event, Beast World. The narrative unfolds as heroes, villains, and civilians alike undergo a transformation into violent, uncontrollable animal hybrids courtesy of Beast Boy&#39;s Garro spores.

          

In his Garro form, Garfield emerges as a colossal menace, posing a substantial threat to Earth as he steadily approaches the blue planet. To counter this imminent danger, Amanda Waller takes matters into her own hands and, with the help of Lex Luthor, deploys her secret weapon—Chester Runk—to bring about an end to Beast Boy once and for all.





 Titans: Beast World #4 Officially Kills Off Beast Boy 


          

At the outset of Titans: Beast World #4, Amanda Waller initiates a sinister plan by abducting Chester Runk, who is the human equivalent of a black hole due to his ability to access the Void—a pocket dimension within him. Teaming up with Lex Luthor, Waller transports Chester into the colossal body of Garfield. This strategic maneuver essentially planted a destructive bomb within Garfield&#39;s head. Faced with panic and the dire effects of the space vacuum, Chester activates his black hole ability, leading to a gruesome and fatal outcome. As he tears Beast Boy apart from the inside out, the two succumb to the devastating consequences.

Heroes, including Superman and Raven, were prepared to guard Garfield against those who might seek him harm. However, they were not expecting the threat to come from within Garfield himself. They could only bear witness, with a sense of horror, as their friend— and in Raven&#39;s case, her lover— was mercilessly torn apart from the inside out. Adding to the gravity of the situation, the telepathic power of Garro enabled the entire Earth to share in the moment he collapsed within himself, subjecting everyone to his excruciating pain and confusion. This heart-wrenching demise etches itself as one of the most merciless deaths suffered by a hero in the history of DC.






 Is Beast Boy Actually Dead? There’s Still Time for a Twist 


          

In this issue, Beast Boy&#39;s demise is unequivocally declared and vividly illustrated, offering scant room for optimism regarding Garfield&#39;s survival. The comic graphically depicts his body being torn apart from the inside out, and a considerable black hole now occupies the space where his brain and eye once existed. The narrative also explicitly states that &#34;Chester Runk and what was left of Beast Boy died together.&#34; Despite these grim details, a faint glimmer of hope emerges as Garfield&#39;s body has not entirely been engulfed by the void yet. With a part of Beast Boy still intact, it is more than possible that the hero will make a remarkable comeback.

Titans: Beast World #4 is available now from DC Comics.
