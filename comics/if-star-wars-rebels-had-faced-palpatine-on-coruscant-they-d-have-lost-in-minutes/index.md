# If Star Wars  Rebels Had Faced Palpatine on Coruscant, They d Have Lost in Minutes


## SUMMARY 



  The recent failure of the Scourge to attack Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant proves that if the Rebels had done so, they would have lost in minutes.   Palpatine has detonation defenses surrounding his palace and the city of Coruscant, which would decimate any invading Rebel forces.   Palpatine&#39;s ability to use Force lightning and his willingness to sacrifice civilian lives make him an even more formidable opponent on Coruscant than on the Death Star.

## Literature Review

Emperor Palpatine was beaten by Star Wars&#39; Rebels aboard the second Death Star, but if the Rebels tried attacking him on Coruscant, he would have won.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars: Darth Vader #40 Star Wars’ Rebels famously defeated the Empire with the destruction of the second Death Star, and the deaths of both Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine ensured that defeat would stick (at least, long enough for the New Republic to get off the ground). However, if the Rebels decided to attack Palpatine on Coruscant instead of the Death Star in an effort to end the Empire’s reign, they would have lost in minutes - and the recent failure of the Scourge to do just that proves it.




In the current state of Star Wars canon within the Marvel Comics ongoing series (which is set between the events of Episode V and Episode VI), a new enemy has reared its ugly head, and has proven to be a threat to both the Empire and the Rebellion: the Scourge. The Scourge is a viral AI hivemind that can assimilate droids and cyborgs through touch.

          

Now, both sides of the war are starting to take notice of this new threat, and implement security measures to keep it from spreading. However, during Star Wars’ most recent adventure, the Scourge managed to break through Coruscant’s defenses (with the help of Darth Vader). While one would assume the result would be catastrophic given the number of droids and cyborgs on Coruscant, the opposite ended up being the case - which is arguably even scarier.





 Emperor Palpatine Has Detonation Defenses Surrounding His Palace 
         

In Star Wars: Darth Vader #40 by Greg Pak and Raffaele Ienco, Darth Vader launches an assault on the Emperor’s Palace, as he’s sick of Palpatine toying with his life - and the Scourge promptly hitches a ride. While Vader was unaware of this at first, he quickly learns that the droids he programmed to help him in this fight succumbed to Scourge infection, and started fighting their own war in the middle of Vader’s conflict with Palpatine.

As the Scourge continued to spread through the palace and make its way to the streets of Coruscant, Palpatine initiated his detonation defenses around the palace and within the surrounding city-scape, a defensive strategy called Protocol 23. This maneuver proved successful in stopping further Scourge infection, though seemingly at the cost of a great number of the lives of Coruscant&#39;s citizens - something Palpatine doesn’t genuinely care about in the slightest.






 Emperor Palpatine’s Detonation Defenses Would Decimate Rebel Forces 
          

The level of explosive chaos that ensued with the proverbial flip of a switch was enough to extinguish an entire droid army cultivated by the Scourge, one that consisted of droids who were already embedded within Coruscant society. This means that any kind of invading force wouldn’t stand a chance against these defenses, thereby eliminating any chance of success the Rebellion would have if they invaded the Empire Capitol. Plus, Palpatine has already proved that he doesn’t care about civilian casualties, meaning he wouldn’t hesitate to launch this defense again.

Not only would these defenses mean swift and total obliteration of invading Rebel forces, but Palpatine also showed in this issue that he can take out a small ground-force army with his Force lightning alone, meaning even if the Rebels somehow made it into the palace, they’d be taken out by the Emperor himself in mere moments. All-in-all, it’s a good thing the Rebels attacked Emperor Palpatine on the second Death Star, because if the Star Wars heroes did so on Coruscant, they’d have lost in minutes.
