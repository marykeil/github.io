Summary

  In Batman #140, the Arkhamverse&#39;s Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is officially introduced into DC&#39;s comics, confirming the villain&#39;s existence and significance in the game series&#39; reality.   The Zur-En-Arrh persona, originally introduced in 1958 as an alien hero, was retconned by Grant Morrison to be an emergency persona created by Bruce Wayne to combat mental attacks.   This revelation means that the Zur-En-Arrh costume, which is wearable in Batman: Arkham Knight, is not just a fun comic reference but an actual villain who exists in the game&#39;s storyline, hidden in plain sight.  





As Batman faces a multiversal army of his worst selves, DC officially brings a hidden Batman: Arkham Knight villain into official canon. The 2015 game closed out the Arkhamverse game series, and saw Batman battle Scarecrow, Riddler, and a corrupted Jason Todd to save Arkham. At the end of the game, Bruce Wayne fakes his own death, embracing the myth of the Batman as his sole identity. Now, DC&#39;s comics are revisiting this Batman and showing what happened next.




In a preview of Chip Zdarsky, Jorge JimÃ©nez, Tomeu Morey and Clayton Cowles&#39; Batman #140, Bruce Wayne is displaced from his own body by the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, who has decided to finally kill Joker. As he fights to return, he meets an army of other Zur-En-Arrhs from different Batman franchises.

         

Batman&#39;s recent multiversal journey spread the Zur-En-Arrh consciousness to pretty much every version of Batman, from Michael Keaton&#39;s Dark Knight to Adam West&#39;s Caped Crusader. However, this preview also depicts the Arkhamverse&#39;s Zur-En-Arrh, who states that once DC&#39;s mainstream Bruce Wayne has been erased, this new army will return to their own realities to &#34;solve crime&#34; in their typically brutal way.

A truly bizarre piece of Batman lore, Zur-En-Arrh was originally introduced in 1958 as an alien hero. However, Grant Morrison&#39;s 2006 Batman run retconned the character, revealing him to be an emergency persona Bruce Wayne had created which could keep fighting even when he was under mental attack - a sensible precaution considering how many of Gotham&#39;s villains deal in brainwashing of one kind or another. Since then, Zur-En-Arrh has only grown stronger, since the persona recognizes Bruce Wayne&#39;s sky-high levels of stress as a form of psychological attack.



Zur-En-Arrh&#39;s name comes from a corruption of the phrase &#39;Zorro in Arkham.&#39; The quote comes from Thomas Wayne - moments before his murder - as he explained to a young Bruce that any real-life vigilante would be considered insane in the real world. This concept defines Zur-En-Arrh, who is Bruce&#39;s idea of Batman without any human restraint.







In a recent adventure in the multiverse, DC&#39;s main Batman met many other versions from film, TV, games, and comics, including the Arkham Knight version. Arkham Knight&#39;s Batman said he regrets his decisions in the final game, mourning giving up his civilian life and advising Batman to kill Joker the next time they meet. In Batman #135, fans saw the new versions of Zur-En-Arrh unite, with a figure in the background who might have been the Arkhamverse&#39;s corrupted Batman.

Now, Batman #140 confirms this is in fact the Zur-En-Arrh of the Arkhamverse, with the same design and costume details (including the stitching on the hastily-made costume.) This is particularly thrilling for game fans, as it makes Zur-En-Arrh fully canon in the game series&#39; reality. The Zur-En-Arrh suit is actually wearable in Batman: Arkham Knight, with the description &#34;Back-up personality. Use with caution.&#34; For years, it seemed like this was just one of the game&#39;s many Easter Eggs referencing the comics. However, as the Arkhamverse&#39;s Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is officially unleashed, it&#39;s now canon that the villain exists and is a significant threat post-Arkham Knight.




This means that the next time Batman: Arkham Knight players use the costume in the game, it&#39;s not just a fun comic reference, but an actual villain who exists in the continuity of the game&#39;s story, essentially hidden in plain sight. While this was almost surely not the intent of including the costume, it does match many other choices in the game, which hides a lot of secrets and references throughout, like Calendar Man being hidden in the crowd during Bruce Wayne&#39;s &#39;death.&#39; Batman: Arkham Knight&#39;s version of Zur-En-Arrh is now canon in the Arkhamverse, redefining the game skin as a hidden villain whose time has come.

Batman #140 is coming December 5 from DC Comics.
