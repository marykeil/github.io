# Two Ridiculous Sonic Foes Step Up to Take Eggman s Place (&amp; Fail Miserably)


## SUMMARY 



  Cubot and Orbot, who usually serve as comic relief, play a major role in Sonic the Hedgehog: Winter Jam from IDW Publishing.   The two silly Badniks&#39; desire to do less work influences their efforts to defeat Sonic and his friends.   The Winter Jam plan, stolen from Dr. Eggman, is a horrible idea, but Cubot and Orbot&#39;s failure saves him from embarrassment.

## Literature Review

The last two Badniks that fans would ever expect to be the center of anything in IDW&#39;s Sonic the Hedgehog series are the main villains in Winter Jam.




Warning: Spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog: Winter JamGiven Cubot and Orbot&#39;s main purpose is mostly to serve as comic relief, no Sonic the Hedgehog fan would ever guess that they&#39;d play a major role in the franchise outside the Sonic Boom TV show. And yet, that&#39;s exactly what these pathetic Badniks in a recent Sonic one-shot from IDW Publishing.




Cubot and Orbot take matters into their own robotic hands to defeat Sonic and his friends in the Sonic the Hedgehog: Winter Jam one-shot by writer Iasmin Omar Ata, artist Min Ho Kim, colorist Reggie Graham and letterer Shawn Lee. Of course, their efforts are influenced more so by their desire to do less work than to actually win against Sonic. Because Dr. Eggman has been spending so much time watching footage to come up with a new scheme to defeat them, Cubot and Orbot are required to wait on him hand and foot more so than usual.

          

So, the two of them steal one of Dr. Eggman&#39;s untested plans, aptly named Winter Jam, to do what their master won&#39;t.


 Cubot &amp; Orbot&#39;s Loss is Dr. Eggman&#39;s Fault 
          




Aside from the irony that putting Winter Jam into action actually gives them even more work to do, the plan in and of itself is horrible. Of course, Cubot and Orbot are already predestined to fail, but it is undoubtedly one of Dr. Eggman&#39;s worst ideas ever, since Winter Jam consists of harmless competitions and can result in gifting Sonic a Chaos Emerald should he win. So, Cubot and Orbot have a very slim chance of winning before they even begin. Although the goofiness of Eggman&#39;s Winter Jam serendipitously matches both of their ridiculous personalities, it does scream &#34;Dr. Eggman.&#34; All of Dr. Eggman&#39;s schemes are theatrical. Regardless, Cubot and Orbot&#39;s actions in this one-shot save Dr. Eggman the embarrassment of initiating Winter Jam himself, since the final scene greatly implies that the footage he is studying at the beginning of the one-shot is for Winter Jam, and he quickly deletes the footage in a rage.



 Sonic&#39;s Silly Winter Jam Special Fits Cubot &amp; Orbot&#39;s Personalities Perfectly 
          




Fans of Cubot and Orbot&#39;s shenanigans and the Sonic Boom series would undoubtedly be quite pleased with Winter Jam for obvious reasons. The two robots haven&#39;t gotten as much face time in the comics as they do in Sonic Boom just because the latter is more of a comedy than an action/adventure. In addition, Sonic and Dr. Eggman aren&#39;t really enemies in Sonic Boom, at least not in the traditional sense. In fact, most of the conflict between them is over amusing trivial matters, so it&#39;s only natural that Sonic Boom&#39;s shift in tone would give Cubot and Orbot more screen time. They are both goofy characters, so they would natural shine more in a goofier setting like they do in Winter Jam.

Although some readers might not be pleased with Winter Jam&#39;s sillier tone, they should be glad that the story takes place in an extra one-shot issue that doesn&#39;t even replace the regular monthly Sonic the Hedgehog comic. Of course, Sonic the Hedgehog&#39;s main series will be on hiatus for the next few months to make way for the upcoming Fang the Hunter miniseries. Given that Fang the Hunter is exploring the likelihood of the potentially lore-shattering eighth emerald, fans who appreciate the more serious tone of the main Sonic the Hedgehog series likely won&#39;t get a repeat of Cubot and Orbot&#39;s ridiculousness.






Sonic the Hedgehog: Winter Jam is available now from IDW Publishing.
