## Literature Review

“Beast World” is causing everyone in the DC Universe to fight back against the monstrous Beast Boy, including one of Wonder Woman’s greatest enemies.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #4!A surprising Wonder Woman antagonist is taking a more heroic stance during the DC Universe&#39;s latest calamity. Beloved Titan Beast Boy is turning everything upside down with his spores and changing the world into a planet of animals. But one of Diana&#39;s oldest antagonists is stepping up to help in whatever way they can.




In a preview for Titans: Beast World #4 by Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer, Amanda Waller&#39;s leading soldier Peacemaker comes to the assistance of Flash associate Chester P. Runk, aka Chunk. Peacemaker tranquilizes Runk and collects him, remarking that Waller has plans for the metahuman.

         

Meanwhile in Ivy Town, the small community is being overrun with hybrids created by Beast Boy&#39;s spores. While bird-like people attack the town&#39;s citizens, a police officer encourages a woman to run to safety. However, this woman is actually Doris Zeul, aka Giganta. Refusing to run, Giganta starts to enlarge and runs into the fray to save the panicked community.

Beast Boy pushed himself well past his limits when the Earth was invaded by a rampaging alien known as the Necrostar. But after Gar Logan was mind-wiped by Amanda Waller&#39;s mysterious asset Doctor Hate, the iconic hero was stuck in his Star Conqueror form. Now &#39;Garro&#39; as he&#39;s known is attacking Earth and sending out numerous spores across the DC Universe that are turning the most powerful people into animal-human hybrids. Meanwhile, Waller is taking advantage of the chaos to secure higher power for herself. Meanwhile, the Titans are doing their best to save the world and their friend.

The Garro spores are attacking everyone, so sides like good and evil largely don&#39;t apply as they normally do. That said, it&#39;s not such a surprise that Giganta is being a bit more proactive than other members of Wonder Woman&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery. After all, she did briefly date the Atom Ryan Choi in the pre-Flashpoint continuity. Perhaps her time being romantically involved with a superhero helped inspire her to do better. While it&#39;s a noble thing, stepping up at this moment could be the worst decision Giganta could make. If the spores are seeking out powerful hosts, then Giganta may have just put a super-sized target on her back.






 Wonder Woman&#39;s Nemesis Picked the Worst Time to Play Hero 
          

While the Earth is in an all-hands-on-deck situation, Giganta running headfirst into the danger is a shortsighted decision. She has no clue that the spores are seeking out the most powerful hosts possible and that her powers make her a prime candidate for possession. Her attempts to save Ivy Town could actually backfire and put it in far more danger if a spore makes its way down her gullet. The world&#39;s forces are already stretched thin combating Garro and the thousands of other spores. Even Wonder Woman might not be able to take the time to stop Giganta from turning into the biggest hybrid threat in the DC Universe.

Titans: Beast World #4 is on sale from DC Comics on January 9th.
