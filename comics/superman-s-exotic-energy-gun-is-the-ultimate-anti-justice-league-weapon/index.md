# Superman s Exotic Energy Gun Is the Ultimate Anti-Justice League Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  Lord Superman of the Justice Lords used an exotic energy gun to eliminate the powers of the entire Justice League, proving its effectiveness as an anti-Justice League weapon.   This weapon was stolen from Lex Luthor&#39;s lab and has the power to eliminate superpowers, including magic.   While used for evil purposes, the main Superman could potentially use this gun to eliminate his weakness to magic, offering him a fighting chance against magic-users.

## Literature Review

On a good day, Superman could probably solo the Justice League, though his anti-Justice League ray gun means he can beat them whenever he wants. 




While guns aren’t really Superman’s style, one evil variant of the Man of Steel had no moral qualms about using it against all the other members of the Justice League, thereby proving its usefulness on behalf of every Superman in the multiverse. Plus, based on the origin of this weapon, it’s fair to say that every Superman in the multiverse should have access to this perfect anti-Justice League weapon.




The evil Superman in question is Lord Superman of the Justice Lords, a villainous version of the classic superhero team in a universe where they took over the planet and ruled as humanity’s lords, effectively becoming the new gods of Earth. While this wouldn’t have been a problem for the Justice League in any other reality, the Justice Lords have had their sights set on other realities for some time now across a number of storylines, and the one who truly had the desire to conquer was Lord Superman.

          

Lord Superman proved to more or less be another classic ‘evil Superman’ character who uses his god-tier powers to crush his opponents and take whatever he wants. In this case, one of the opponents he crushed was Lex Luthor, and he didn’t do so purely because Luthor was a consistent thorn in Superman’s side. Lord Superman also raids Luthor’s lab, taking what he wanted from the iconic supervillain’s laboratory, and utilizing that weaponry in his own conquests. And one such weapon he stole was the aforementioned exotic energy gun, a weapon with the power to eliminate ‘exotic energies’ (ie, superpowers of any kind) - including magic.





 Superman Stole This Anti-Justice League Weapon From Lex Luthor 
         

In Justice League Beyond 2.0 #23 by Christos Gage and Dexter Soy, Lord Superman is plotting a scheme to launch a justifiable war against an entirely different reality. He needs the backing of his people, and that will only happen if there’s a suitable ‘villain’ they deem worth flying across the multiverse to fight. Lord Superman finds such a villain in an alternate universe’s Justice League, and tries to use the death of his reality’s Wonder Woman to spark a war with them, hoping to frame this Justice League for her murder.

However, when he announced his ‘evil plan’, he was recorded, and that recording was played for the Justice League of this world. So, they come together to stop this evil Superman, challenging him with their sheer numbers and near incalculable combined power. But, before they got the chance to strike, Superman whipped out the gun he stole from the murdered Luthor’s lab, and blasted every member of the Justice League with it at once, eliminating all their powers with a single shot.






 DC’s Main Superman Can Use This Gun To Eliminate A Huge Weakness 
          

While Lord Superman used this weapon for evil against the Justice League, the main version of Superman could conceivably use the exotic energy gun to de-power those with magic. Magic is one of Superman’s greatest weaknesses alongside kryptonite, and while there’s no way to keep him safe from kryptonite attacks as of now, this exotic energy gun could give him a fighting chance against magic-users, thereby eliminating a huge weakness Superman has had since the dawn of his publication history.

Obviously, Superman would have to steal this weapon from Lex Luthor in order to use it (and that’s assuming his Lex even made one), so it’s too early to tell if this proposed solution to his magic weakness would even work practically. However, what has been tested is Lord Superman’s usage of the weapon against the Justice League, proving that Superman’s exotic energy gun is the ultimate anti-Justice League weapon.
