## Literature Review

My Hero Academia finally reveals how previous One for All users fell, and their deaths at All for One&#39;s hands are each uniquely horrifying.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia Chapter #408My Hero Academia has made it clear that One for All&#39;s previous users had rather short lives with unpleasant ends, but chapter #408 goes the extra mile by showing exactly how some of them died. The brutality they suffered at the hands of All for One is disturbing in many cases, and it&#39;s a wonder that the power of One for All has managed to last for as long as it has.




Chapter #408 heavily features All for One recounting events from his past, including his encounters with the inheritors of One for All over the years. While the images are left as effectively background panels, there&#39;s still a heavy amount of detail in these scenes, revealing how each of the previous One for All users perished. Visible on the right is the Second User, as seen in a previous flashback; on the left, readers can spot the Third and Fifth users, with the latter narrowly avoiding having One for All stolen.

          

Most disturbing is the panel featuring the Sixth User, who has been completely cut in half at the waist, and desperately reaches out for Nana Shimura with a smile on his face.


 All for One Shows No Mercy 
          




While Midoriya was able to receive One for All from All Might over time and got slowly coached in how it works, it&#39;s clear from these flashbacks that most users passed on One for All in a dire situation, to whomever happened to be in physical proximity at the time of their deaths. Almost none of the previous users were chosen to be the heir like Midoriya was; they simply had the responsibility of One for All thrust upon them. All for One&#39;s desire for the Quirk overrides all his other goals, and so when he encounters the current holder, he shows them absolutely no mercy.

All for One also makes it clear in this chapter that he didn&#39;t stop with killing the users themselves; he mentions going out and eliminating every woman and child who had ever associated with the Second User, now known to be named Kudo, to ensure that his bloodline was thoroughly ended. It&#39;s certainly a shocking level of cruelty on display, but perfectly in character for the extremely self-centered All for One. He, of course, was equally thorough in destroying Nana Shimura&#39;s family, as evidenced by everything he did to create Tomura Shigaraki out of Tenko Shimura.




While for Midoriya, One for All was a blessing that let him achieve his dreams, it seems like the Quirk has really been more of a curse for those who inherit it, ensuring they&#39;ll never be able to live a normal life again, and that they&#39;ll eventually fall in horrific ways. It was only through great courage that the ability was able to be passed on for as long as it has, and its users had to rise to the occasion once they inherited it, or risk losing everything that those who came before them had fought for. The cruelty of All for One clearly knows no bounds in My Hero Academia, and it will be interesting to see if these bloody manga deaths make it into the anime uncensored.
