## Literature Review

General Zod is one of Superman&#39;s most dangerous enemies, but it&#39;s not actually the Man of Steel who drives the Kryptonian warrior.




Some might assume that General Zod sees Superman as his biggest enemy due to their fighting over the years, but that&#39;s not actually true. While Zod dislikes Superman, his hatred for Superman is due to Superman&#39;s father, Jor-El, whose defeat of Zod haunts him to this very day. Now, fans have found out how deep that hatred goes.




After the recent United Planets treaty, Zod was given a planet to rule over. Now, in Kneel Before Zod #1, Zod has begun working to create more Kryptonians through cloning and is also training the locals of his planet into a military force. One of the major things that is driving Zod to do this is his unresolved rivalry with Jor-El, Superman&#39;s father.



          

In the issue, Zod is shown arguing against a hallucination of Jor-El, who mocks Zod for no longer having any real direction, for being a soldier without a war. Zod dismisses this, but it quickly becomes apparent that he truly believes he&#39;s talking to his old enemy. Even as he rebuilds a world in his image, Zod is being dragged down by his obsessive hatred to the point that even his grip on reality is slipping. The issue comes from Joe Casey, Dan McDaid, David Baron, and Troy Peteri.




                  &#34;Kneel Before Zod&#34;: Superman&#39;s New Take on General Zod Is Inspired by SnyderVerse&#39;s Michael Shannon   Joe Casey revealed recently that Michael Shannon&#39;s role as General Zod was an influence for his and Dan McDaid&#39;s upcoming series Kneel Before Zod.   


 Zod Argues With The Phantom Of Jor-El 
Superman&#39;s &#39;Nemesis&#39; Is Still More Obsessed with His Father
         

One of the parts of Krypton&#39;s history that&#39;s oft-forgotten is the fact that Jor-El and Dru-Zod were originally on good terms. Jor-El was one of the heads of the science guild and General Zod was one of the major heads of the military guild. Jor-El himself stated that they had been friends for the majority of their lives. Zod even ended up saving Jor-El&#39;s life during a failed assassination attempt to seize control of the House of El. But this friendship only made their later rivalry more potent, and eventually Zod grew to hate the House of El so much that even after surviving Krypton&#39;s destruction and outliving his enemy, he felt compelled to attack Superman again and again in an attempt to continue the rivalry with his father.






          



While General Zod is one of Superman&#39;s most famous villains, the Man of Steel is simply standing in for his father in Zod&#39;s mind. Zod is so dangerous because he can never defeat the one man who truly beat him, locking him in the Phantom Zone and leaving him powerless as Krypton was destroyed. While even Lex Luthor has recently come to see Superman as an ally, Zod can never truly reconcile with the Man of Steel for long, as there&#39;s nothing Kal-El can do to answer Zod&#39;s need to &#39;beat&#39; his father.

As New Kandor rises and Zod stands on the precipice of the victory he&#39;s always claimed to want, he is still obsessed with Jor-El, as all his doubts and flaws express themselves through the image of a man he can never forgive. General Zod is fighting hard to become a creator, but as this preview shows, his biggest hurdle is his hatred for Superman&#39;s father - a flaw which may bring his entire empire crumbling to the ground, leaving him a destroyer once again.
