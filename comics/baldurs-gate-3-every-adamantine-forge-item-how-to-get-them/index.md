## Literature Review

The Adamantine Forge provides some of the best pieces of equipment in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3. Here’s how to unlock each of the weapons and armor.





Once you have beat Grym in Baldur’s Gate 3, you will have unlocked access to the Adamantine Forge, a special location allowing you to forge limited items. The Adamantine Forge items are rare pieces of gear that can offer a significant bump to builds and are some of the best equipment you can obtain early in the game. These items are so good, in fact, that you will likely continue to use some of them through Act 2 and into Act 3.




  


 Adamantine Forge Moulds &amp; Mithral Ore Locations In Baldur’s Gate 3 
How Every Adamantine Forge Item Works
         

The big issue with the Adamantine Forge items is that they are extremely limited. Per run, you can only forge two of the six items available in the forge. To make these pieces of gear, you will need to collect special items called Moulds. For instance, you will need to have the Longsword Mould in your inventory to forge the Adamantine Longsword. These Moulds are scattered across various locations in the Grymforge. In addition to Moulds, you will need one Mithral Ore per piece of equipment you want to forge in Baldur’s Gate 3.




                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How To Get Nyrulna (Best Legendary Weapon)   One of the best Legendary weapons in Baldur’s Gate 3, Nyrulna, can easily be obtained if you follow some steps once you arrive in Act 3.   

The scarcity of Mithral Ore limits each run to two items from the Adamantine Forge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Mithral Ore can be found in two Mithral Veins inside the Grymforge map. These Mithral Veins are represented by a large stone with blue accents. The first is on a path to the left of the stairs you take down toward the Adamantine Forge, across a river of lava. Its coordinates are approximately X: -557, Y: 278. All you need to do is break the Vein in Baldur’s Gate 3 and collect the Mithral Ore from the floor.



Before crossing the river, you will be ambushed by a party of Magma Mephits. Be wary, as they are capable of throwing your characters into the lava.







The second Mithral Ore is located near the Underdark - Ancient Forge teleport point. From there, you will have to head south, down a hidden path, and get across some lava to gain access to it. The second Mithral Ore’s coordinates are approximately X: -645, Y: 260. With Mithral Ores and Moulds in hand, you can head to the Adamantine Forge in Baldur’s Gate 3, beat Grym if you haven’t already, and forge the special items.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: How To Solve The Necrotic Laboratory Puzzle   A projected mind in the Necrotic Laboratory area of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 creates a fragmented puzzle that you must solve to open a path leading forward.   

The table below lists all the Adamantine Forge items, the necessary Moulds to forge them (and where to find them), and the effects and skills each piece of gear provides:

The items that can be created with the Adamantine Forge are not as good as some pieces of Legendary equipment in the game, but most Legendaries can only be unlocked in Act 3. Depending on your gameplay style, the Adamantine Forge items will be your best friends throughout the campaign. The Adamantine Splint Armour, for instance, is one of the best pieces of equipment for Paladins, while the Scimitar can serve Rogues. Choose your items carefully, as the prizes in the Adamantine Forge in Baldur’s Gate 3 are very limited.
