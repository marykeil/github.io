# Superman s Biggest Hero Threat Isn t Batman, It s Green Arrow


## SUMMARY 



  In an issue of Adventure Comics from 1959, Green Arrow unknowingly created a massive Kryptonite arsenal by crafting his arrow-tips out material from a mysterious green rock he found, potentially making him a serious threat to Superman.   In the story, &#34;The Case of the Vanishing Arrows,&#34; Superman destroyed Green Arrow&#39;s arrows to protect himself from the dangerous Kryptonite tips.   This makes it that it is Green Arrow could be a formidable opponent for Superman, despite their seeming power disparity.

## Literature Review

Fans have debated for years whether Batman could beat Superman or not, but it turns out Superman&#39;s biggest threat is actually Green Arrow.




Whether Batman could take down Superman in an all-out fight is a question that has fueled speculation as long as the two characters have been at the top of the DC hero game – but as it turns out, the fight fans should be forecasting is Superman vs. Green Arrow. 




Adventure Comics #266 – by Robert Bernstein and Lee Elias – followed Green Arrow and his faithful sidekick Speedy as they patrolled Star City. Green Arrow was in the midst of a usual day take down criminals using his famously ridiculous trick arrows, but in this case, something strange happened.



          

Every time Green Arrow took down a criminal, when he went to retrieve his arrows, they seemed to move on their own before exploding. Naturally, this concerned Green Arrow, but it wasn&#39;t until the end of the comic that he discovered the reason why: Superman was obliterating Green Arrow&#39;s arrows from one of Star City&#39;s many skyscrapers.

 Oliver Queen Invented Anti-Superman Weaponry Without Realizing It 


          

Adventure Comics #266 is notable for featuring one of the more bizarre stories centered around Kryptonite. Oliver Queen is infamous for two things: his trick arrows, and copying Batman. Green Arrow is similar to Batman because DC was trying to cash in on the success of Batman, leading to early Oliver having many parallels to Bruce, with things like the Arrowmobile and Arrowcave. This is exemplified in Adventure Comics #266; after getting a letter from Batman, congratulating them on solving a crime, Speedy noticed Batman signed the letter with a unique symbol. Oliver then decided he needs an iconic symbol as well, but what he picked wound up putting him in the path of Superman.



Adventure Comics #266 was released in November, 1959. &#34;The Case of the Vanishing Arrows&#34; was one of three stories featured in the issue.







Superman revealed at the end of Adventure Comics #266 that he had been destroying Oliver&#39;s trick arrows because, in Oliver&#39;s quest to find a unique symbol, he&#39;d begun using green arrowheads for his arrows. These were created out of a strange rock that Oliver found, which Superman identified as Kryptonite. This meant that every single arrow in Oliver&#39;s arsenal at the time could have taken down Superman, even the absurd Glue Arrow or the equally ridiculous Iron-Lung arrow. While Oliver Queen&#39;s use of Kryptonite was inadvertent, Superman&#39;s cautious and immediate response makes it clear that he recognizes the potential danger Queen&#39;s Kryptonite-arrows could have posed.



 Superman Destroyed Oliver&#39;s Arrows To Protect Himself 


          

Despite the fact that Oliver wasn&#39;t aware of what he was doing, or the potential implications, he did accidentally assemble the biggest Kryptonite arsenal on the planet for a moment there. Superman&#39;s reasoning for destroying the arrows in the manner he did might come across as a bit questionable, in retrospect – but ultimately, Oliver understood, and the issue needed to have its plot. Still, the fact Superman had to hide from a distance and take Oliver&#39;s arrows out goes to show that it is not Batman that the Man of Steel needs to be prepared for, it is Green Arrow.
