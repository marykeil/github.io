  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The debut of &ldquo;Screen Rant: Captain&rsquo;s Log&rdquo; brings Star Trek fans exclusive news, reveals, previews, and insights from the storytellers at IDW Publishing.
IDW&rsquo;s Star Trek series has earned high praise and is just getting started, with unexpected storylines and crossover events.
The Star Trek team at IDW is working with intention, telling cohesive and &ldquo;badass&rdquo; stories in the finite sandbox between Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Nemesis.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Screen Rant is going behind the scenes of IDW&rsquo;s Star Trek to bring fans exclusive news and teases from the minds shaping Trek&rsquo;s acclaimed new chapter.</p>
<p>Screen Rant is proud to present readers the debut of Captain&rsquo;s Log, the first in an ongoing series bringing fans of Star Trek exclusive news, reveals, previews, and insights straight from the storytellers crafting the next chapter of Trek at IDW Publishing. And with the team&rsquo;s historic series already earning some of the comics industry&rsquo;s highest accolades (and changing the Trek canon forever), the promise to fans is clear: they are just getting started.</p>
<p>When the relaunch of IDW&rsquo;s flagship Star Trek (2022) brought Captain Benjamin Sisko back from his mysterious trip to the Prophets at Deep Space Nine&rsquo;s ending, no fan could have predicted the coming &ldquo;God War,&rdquo; the shocking Klingon uprising in Day of Blood, or Worf&rsquo;s unlawful commandeering of the USS Defiant (uniting his own crew of Trek favorites). To find out what&rsquo;s next from the universe-shaking minds at IDW, Screen Rant has the inside scoop from Trek group editor Heather Antos. Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of DS9, The Next Generation, Picard, or Lower Decks, there is something unforgettable on the way.</p>
<p>1:59         Captain Kirk&rsquo;s First Act on Becoming Admiral Changed Star Trek Lore Forever  A Star Trek comic depicted the mission that led James Kirk to accept a promotion; more critically, it revealed the first thing he did as an Admiral.</p>
<p>Screen Rant: I am honored to be joined by the highly distinguished &lsquo;captain&rsquo; of this Captain&rsquo;s Log, and Star Trek group editor at IDW Publishing, Heather Antos. Heather, thank you for joining me!</p>
<p>Heather Antos: Thanks for having me!</p>
<p>SR: And thank you for giving fans a deeper look into the new and ever-changing, maybe more-changing-than-ever world of Star Trek.</p>
<p>HA: You know, it&rsquo;s been a wild&hellip; what, year and a half since this new line started? Yeah.</p>
<p>SR: Now that the shocking Day of Blood event is in the rearview mirror, I have to know: how hard was it to resist that initial pitch when it was made? Not only was it the event that was built-to in this first year of comics, but it was built-to by two equally astounding series, in the main Star Trek and Star Trek: Defiant.</p>
<p>HA: It was always the goal actually, from the beginning when I first reached out to Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly to join this—no pun intended—trek with me to develop a new Star Trek line. It was always with the intention of, &lsquo;Okay, in the first year we end up with this huge crossover event between the two series and just see: can we do this? Can we stick this landing? Will it go over well? Will Paramount approve a title called &lsquo;Day of Blood&rsquo;?&rsquo;
You know, for a franchise that is about ideals and the best that humans can be, we&rsquo;re going to have a very violent Klingon coup. Will they even let us do that?
Will they let us have a cover from Daniel Warren Johnson with a decapitated Klingon head on it?
So it&rsquo;s been a dream come true to do these books, and to have the partnership and collaboration of Paramount, and to have them be received so well by the fandom. To get two Eisner nominations in our first year. It&rsquo;s been surreal.</p>
<p>Readers can begin this new era with
Star Trek #1
from Kelly, Lanzing, and Rosanas, which launched a parallel series with
Star Trek: Defiant #1
by Christopher Cantwell and Angel Unzueta.</p>
<p>Star Trek&rsquo;s Epic &ldquo;Day of Blood&rdquo; Was Only The Beginning</p>
<p>SR: When you come out of the gate with something that bold, and something that is received that well, what are the conversations like for what comes next?</p>
<p>HA: Oh, y&rsquo;all ain&rsquo;t ready for what comes next. I think that&rsquo;s been the really cool thing about working with Jackson, Collin, and Chris Cantwell. Jackson, Collin and I have been working together for going on five years now. We collaborated previously when I was at Valiant on a book called The Harbinger. These two are the most through-and-through Trekkies I&rsquo;ve ever met, ever, in my life. I&rsquo;ve seen—please don&rsquo;t kill mel Jackson, but I&rsquo;ve seen the pictures of him in a Borg costume when he was like 10 years old, you know?
It&rsquo;s just been so great to be working with such professional writers, that
we all want the same thing: we just want the most cohesive, badass Star Trek story ever told.
And when you&rsquo;re given this gap in time that we have, between Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Nemesis, there is this very finite sandbox that we&rsquo;re allowed to play in. I love that when when working with licensed IP. Here&rsquo;s your sandbox, here are the restrictions. What&rsquo;s the coolest story you can tell in that time span?
It means that we have a finite end in mind. And we&rsquo;ve had a finite end in mind from the very beginning. At any point, since the inception of this line, we have known exactly where it starts, exactly where it builds to, and exactly where we have to put the toys back in the box. That means that everything is being done with intention, there&rsquo;s nothing that&rsquo;s happenstance in any of these stories. It is all being done very, very intentionally, which has been very cool.</p>
<p>We all want the same thing: we just want the most cohesive, badass Star Trek story ever told&hellip; Here&rsquo;s your sandbox, here are the restrictions. What&rsquo;s the coolest story you can tell in that time span?</p>
<p>Star Trek Comics Are Being Allowed To &ldquo;Boldly Go&rdquo; Wherever The Story Leads</p>
<p>SR: The idea of &lsquo;fan service&rsquo; has a negative connotation sometimes, but when I&rsquo;ve told Trek fan friends of mine about this new story, just listing the crew members behind Sisko and Worf is something fans never dared to dream of. So to hear you say bigger things are coming, I can&rsquo;t even imagine if people could be sitting down more. Where can you go from here, when you&rsquo;ve already gone farther than expected?</p>
<p>HA: We could go beyond the human mind&rsquo;s wildest imagination&hellip; and that is all I&rsquo;ll tease with that. There&rsquo;s some pretty surreal stuff we&rsquo;re currently doing in the current arc that&rsquo;s post-&ldquo;Glass and Bone,&rdquo; after the Tzenkethi arc, with a new art team on the main Star Trek book that is, it is weird, and surreal.
Everything that we send to Paramount, I&rsquo;m just constantly waiting for them to be like, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s too far you guys. Absolutely not, you can&rsquo;t do that. Are you kidding me? Like, absolutely not, we&rsquo;re not gonna let you touch that. We don&rsquo;t want to set that precedent,&rsquo; right? IPs usually can be very cautious of letting comic books set precedents, or show the first, last, biggest, baddest, any of those. And
Paramount is just so supportive of everything we&rsquo;re doing with these comics
, that we&rsquo;re really getting to just—again, no pun intended, go boldly with the stories we&rsquo;re telling. I think the fact that they&rsquo;re being received as well as they are is what is allowing Paramount to get to have that trust in us, that maybe we do know what we&rsquo;re doing [laughs].</p>
<p>SR: You mentioned it there, that on the list of things inherent to Star Trek—even if they don&rsquo;t fit the &lsquo;ambitious, brighter tomorrow&rsquo; image—is body horror. We&rsquo;ve been teased that some is on the way for Star Trek: Defiant.</p>
<p>HA: Oh, you&rsquo;re not ready. The next arc of Defiant is very much inspired by the [Star Trek: The Next Generation] episode &ldquo;Conspiracy,&rdquo; which I think we&rsquo;re all&hellip; it&rsquo;s one of those episodes that left me wanting more. I feel like there were a lot of loops that weren&rsquo;t closed, and we&rsquo;re hoping to close some of those gaps with this story. Y&rsquo;all are in for a wild ride the next five months.
Ángel Unzueta is coming back to draw this arc, and his uncanny ability to detail realism in graphic, graphic detail with this body horror has definitely made us have to make some creative choices on how we show certain elements. This arc is definitely not for the faint of heart, but it does fulfill one of my goals. When I got to take over Star Trek, one of my goals was, &lsquo;I want to do a Star Trek story that is Event Horizon meets Star Trek,&rsquo; and I really feel like this arc satisfies that dream of mine.</p>
<p>Giving Trek&rsquo;s &lsquo;Space Dinosaurs&rsquo; The Story They Deserve</p>
<p>SR: I&rsquo;m going to need time to grapple with that. One of the most exciting expansions of Star Trek lore, for even casual fans (or just casual observers) has to be the introduction of Lanzing and Kelly&rsquo;s Tzenkethi. I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any going back, so how do we get more of these characters? How do we get more stories? Later arcs, a standalone comic? Why don&rsquo;t I already have Tzenkethi merchandise for my kids?</p>
<p>HA: Space dinosaurs, I know, right? The Tzenkethi is a really cool thing, because it&rsquo;s one of those species that they just really didn&rsquo;t have the budget for on television. So it was like, what is it in Star Wars? The Bothans, right? We hear all about them, but we never actually get to see them in action. Why not give them an entire arc with one of the best creature designers in comics, Marcus To, to really show them at their biggest, baddest, and scariest? Along with some Romulans, because why not?
It&rsquo;s been a really cool arc, to get to explore this pre-warp culture that somehow still has figured out warp technology in their own way. And it&rsquo;s been really cool to get to design them, and really dive into what their culture is like. I would love to do more stories with them.
Like anything else in comics, if you want to see more, please pick up and support the issues.
It makes it easier to convince my bosses if I can say, &lsquo;Well, all of these issues sold out, so clearly they want more!&rsquo; But yes, getting Tzenkethi action figures would be really really cool.</p>
<p>One of my goals was, &lsquo;I want to do a Star Trek story that is Event Horizon meets Star Trek,&rsquo; and I really feel like this arc satisfies that dream of mine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sons of Star Trek&rsquo; Will Bring Legacy Characters Into The Spotlight</p>
<p>SR: Spinning out of Day of Blood specifically, there is Sons of Star Trek. Both Worf&rsquo;s son Alexander and Jake Sisko have had huge personal arcs, so how will that story be continuing? And how is Q Junior going to screw everything up?</p>
<p>HA: Well, Q Junior screws everything up with a snap [laughs]. I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that. But no, one of the things I think is really cool about what we&rsquo;re doing between Star Trek, Defiant, and Day of Blood is we&rsquo;re really building our own comic book universe, so to speak. We&rsquo;re really building this world and this time of characters whose stories are affecting each other in the universe around them. And that&rsquo;s what I love about comic books, right? How intertwined everything is and interconnected.
Yes, you can pick up just one book and enjoy it. And you can pick up this other book and enjoy it. But if you&rsquo;re reading the whole line, you can see that interconnectivity. So often in comic book stories, we&rsquo;re so focused on the A-listers, we&rsquo;re so focused on the main cast, that we forget about how these events are impacting the quote-unquote normal people.
You know, Jake Sisko is not a Federation officer. He&rsquo;s not a member of Starfleet. He&rsquo;s not an innocent bystander in any of this, but he just happens to be the kid of one of the greatest members of Starfleet, let alone Emissary of the Prophets, right? Like, what pressure that must be on him, you know? Then Alexander, oh my God, who his father is, how do you live up to that? Do you even want to live up to that? And who are you, when you don&rsquo;t know your culture, when your father&rsquo;s stuck in between worlds? And then Nog, the first Ferengi of Starfleet, right?</p>
<p>This next generation of Starfleet or Starfleet-adjacent people, there&rsquo;s so much left to be explored by that, who are impacted by the choices that their parents make. We&rsquo;re all impacted by the generations that come before us. And we all have to deal with that in some way, shape or form. And sometimes even the best of intentions can lead to some some some failed plans. I will say, Q Junior comes in with the best of intentions [laughs], but I don&rsquo;t think he gets the results he wanted right off the go. But it&rsquo;s really fun to get to play around with characters that you don&rsquo;t get to see so often. Morgan Hampton, who is the writer new to the Star Trek universe, has been doing some really great character work with this team.
I know it&rsquo;s been teased, that we are going to get to see some of these characters in an alternate universe. And because of that, we do get to see some other faces that are Star Trek legacy characters that I&rsquo;m really, really excited for folks to get to see in comics.
And yes, that includes another first time appearance in quote-unquote, live action comic book form.
And that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
<p>SR: We also finally get to discuss Star Trek: Celebrations. Tell me everything: how did this start, who is the creative team you&rsquo;ve assembled, everything to do with this special issue?</p>
<p>HA: Oh, god. Yeah. I don&rsquo;t know how there has never been a Star Trek Pride issue, ever. It was kind of shocking to me that they had just never done one! Because what is Star Trek, if not the idea of celebrating the best of us, right? The best of humanity, and coming together. There&rsquo;s a really great quote from Gene Roddenberry that that&rsquo;s the future he wants to see: a future where we are all not just tolerating one another, but celebrating one another.
That is the intention behind Celebrations, and where we get the title from. It&rsquo;s wanting to celebrate the badasses of the Star Trek universe, whether that&rsquo;s Culber and Stamets, whether that&rsquo;s Mariner, whether that&rsquo;s Seven and Raffi&hellip; there&rsquo;s so many characters that we&rsquo;re going to get to see explored here by some incredible, incredible writers.&quot;</p>
<p>Star Trek: Celebrations
will arrive in comic book shops on May 29th, 2024.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to reveal too much because I do know we&rsquo;re gonna have some plans for some some big reveals on that. But we do have Steve Orlando, Maggs Visaggio, some of the writers and fall there&rsquo;s some secret names that I&rsquo;m really really excited. We have a wonderful cover from Paulina Ganucheau, and I am so excited about this book, and I think it&rsquo;s going to mean a lot to a lot of people.
It&rsquo;s so funny, because when we were getting the pitches from all the writers, I always tell them to send two or three ideas, just in case they don&rsquo;t like one, right? And there&rsquo;s a couple writers that were like, &lsquo;Oh my god, your Sulu pitch is the best pitch I&rsquo;ve ever read. But then your Culber and Stamets one is super incredible!&rsquo; Because there&rsquo;s only so much space in this comic, we could only allow one story per character set. And whittling down the Lower Decks stories, you know, everyone loves Mariner. Getting to, &lsquo;Okay, this is the story that that we get to tell&rsquo; was so, so hard. I hope we can get to post the pictures that didn&rsquo;t make it, or save them for a future issue, because there&rsquo;s some really good stuff that&rsquo;s just super, super fun.</p>
<p>SR: Next, can you tell us the origin of J.J. Lendl&rsquo;s stained glass connecting covers for Star Trek #19-24, and if it is just because you had a 20 by 50 window or picture frame that needed to become a work of art?</p>
<p>HA: Yeah, I just bought a new house last year and I was really thinking about how I can spruce it up [laughs]. A lot of what this year of Star Trek has been about is dealing with the gods. And in this next arc of Star Trek&hellip; let&rsquo;s just say we&rsquo;re bringing the gods to the party in this book. There&rsquo;s a lot of religious allegory that&rsquo;s going on. J.J. is actually the one who came up with the stained glass concepts. He&rsquo;s just so brilliant, so talented, the way his mind thinks in design is just beyond anyone else I&rsquo;ve ever worked with, how quickly he comes up with these ideas.
I just asked him if he wanted to do a set of connecting variants for this upcoming arc called Blue roadmap for Star Trek, it&rsquo;s going to be six issues, we&rsquo;re visiting the gods and finally confronting them basically. All of this has been building to this moment where Sisko gets to go and have a chat, if you will, with the Prophets. And J.J. just took it and ran. He came back literally the next day with, &lsquo;What do you think about this?&quot; This incredible stained glass sketch that, basically, we could have printed as final because it was so good. I mean, you&rsquo;ve seen it yourself, it&rsquo;s beautiful, an absolutely beautiful set of covers. All J.J. Lendl, I take no credit.&quot;</p>
<p>SR: Finally, with the 30th anniversary of Star Trek: Voyager on the horizon, I have to ask: have conversations happened? I know the fans will be wondering, especially after the &ldquo;lost episode,&rdquo; Dog of War.</p>
<p>HA: I mean Andrew, you know the deal! If nothing&rsquo;s been announced, I can&rsquo;t talk about it.</p>
<p>SR: Well until next time, since that&rsquo;s more than enough to look forward to for now!</p>
<p>Until the next installment of Screen Rant: Captain&rsquo;s Log, be sure to follow our coverage of all Star Trek comics coming regularly from IDW Publishing.</p>
