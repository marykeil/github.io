Summary

  The best way to defeat Superman is by calling for help from another version of Superman, as shown in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #21.   Boy Thunder, now known as Thunderman, utilizes this strategy when he picks a fight with Superman and summons the Superman from the Kingdom Come reality to come to his aid.   This method has been effective in other storylines, such as in Injustice, where Batman brings Superman from Earth Prime to successfully defeat the mad version of Superman.  







Taking on Superman is one of the most dangerous things any villain in the DCU can do, so, naturally, methods to defeat him are highly sought after. While some have turned to Kryptonite and others to magic, it&#39;s only Superman&#39;s former sidekick who came up with the best way to beat the Man of Steel.

The ultimate secret to defeating Superman is revealed in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #20 by Mark Waid and Dan Mora, and it&#39;s a surprisingly simple solution. When Superman&#39;s former sidekick Boy Thunder — now known as Thunderman — picks a fight with the Man of Steel, Superman is able to hold his own, easily overwhelming Thunderman. Instead of giving up and admitting defeat, he simply calls out for help, which summons his Earth&#39;s version of Superman.



          




If someone wants to take down Superman and his absurd array of powers, there&#39;s no easier solution than simply getting another Superman. Kingdom Come&#39;s version of Superman immediately comes to Thunderman&#39;s rescue, punching the main Superman square in the jaw.

                  Sorry Red Hood - Superman&#39;s Sidekick Is the Hero Destined to Kill Joker   There are many people in the DC Universe who would love to kill the Joker, but the first in line is actually Superman&#39;s short-lived sidekick.   


 Boy Thunder Defeats Superman — With Superman 
          

In previous issues of World&#39;s Finest, Boy Thunder was pulled away into the world of Kingdom Come. It&#39;s here that Boy Thunder starts over as a new hero, Thunderman, and will eventually become the villainous Magog. When the Superman from Prime Earth finally finds his former sidekick again, instead of being overjoyed, the boy is furious about Superman failing to save him from being pulled into this dimension. As the fight breaks out between them, Thunderman summons the Superman of Kingdom Come to defend him. While this is a simple solution to taking Superman down, it&#39;s also one that&#39;s been tried and true.




There have been a few times when the main Superman and DC&#39;s other heroes must face an evil version of Superman. Ultraman, for example, has been defeated by Superman several times in the past. But the best example of Thunderman&#39;s plan working takes place in the world of Injustice. In Injustice, Superman goes mad after the death of Lois Lane and takes over the world. It&#39;s up to Batman and his resistance to fight back, but ultimately they were never able to defeat Superman alone. Batman&#39;s plan to defeat Superman in Injustice was to simply bring Superman from Earth Prime over to do it for him. The plan worked wonderfully, and after five years of fighting Superman without making any real progress, Batman was able to end the war in minutes by turning to another Superman.



 Superman Has Always Been His Own Weakness 
          




Superman has fought many twisted doppelgängers from other universes, but they&#39;re usually reversed in some way. Bizarro and Ultraman, for example, are close to Superman, but ultimately not quite the same. These small differences usually allow Superman to overcome and win the fight, but Boy Thunder has found a way around this. Instead of using a twisted doppelgänger, he&#39;s simply sending another Superman after Superman, which is a fight he&#39;s historically had trouble winning.
