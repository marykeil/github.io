# Storm s New Asgardian Look Proves She s Always Been a True Goddess


## SUMMARY 



  Storm has proven her worthiness to hold Mjolnir and has taken on the role of Thor, with a new Thor-inspired costume design.   Storm has always been referred to as a goddess and has had previous encounters with divine powers, including wielding her own Asgardian hammer.   The Marvel Universe explores the idea that gods are created through worship, suggesting that Storm&#39;s divinity is validated by her followers and supporters.

## Literature Review

Thor may be the God of Thunder, but the X-Men have a goddess of their own, and she’s proven once and for all that she’s just as worthy of being Thor.




Contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #4!In Thor’s latest adventure, Storm has proven that she’s worthy of holding Mjolnir and, as a result, the X-Men’s own goddess has been given an awesome design worthy of her status. It’s not the first time that Storm’s flirted with this specific version of divinity, but it’s concrete proof that she’s more than fit for the title of Thor. This is only the latest in a long line of proofs that Storm is the goddess she’s proclaimed to be.




In The Immortal Thor #4 (written by Al Ewing, penciled and inked by MartÍn Cóccolo, colored by Matthew Wilson and lettered by VC’s Joe Sabino) Storm holds Mjolnir and claims the power of Thor, proving her worthiness beyond all doubt and getting a great Thor design to go along with it. In the issue, Thor recruits Storm, alongside a bevy of other worthy heroes, playing hot potato with Mjolnir to power each of them up. As a Thor, Storm now has a new version of her Stormcaster costume, with the same headgear and rough design as the classic costume, but with the addition of golden accents and her latest haircut.

          

Storm becoming the God of Thunder isn’t even that huge a leap for the character, who has always styled herself as a goddess.





 Storm is More than Worthy Enough to be a Goddess 


          

Since her very first appearance all the way back in 1975’s Giant-Size X-Men #1 (written by Len Wein, penciled by Dave Cockrum, inked by Cockrum and Peter Iro, colored by Glynis Oliver and lettered by John Costanza) Storm has been described as a &#34;goddess,&#34; the role she took on as a young woman as the protector of her ancestral tribe from Kenya. Professor X insisted in Giant-Size X-Men #1 that Storm was only a mutant, but that paternalistic statement didn’t really cover the extent of her potential divinity.

In 1985&#39;s X-Men Annual #9 (written by Chris Claremont, penciled by Art Adams, inked by Adams, Al Gordan and Mike Mignola, colored by Petra Scotese and lettered by Tom Orzechowski) Storm gets her own Asgardian hammer, Stormcaster. However, Ororo rejects it after realizing Loki has gifted it to her for evil. Decades later in 2011, X-Men: To Serve and Protect #3’s story &#34;Storm Front&#34; (written by Marc Guggenheim, penciled by Eric Koda, inked by Danny Miki, colored by Sonia Oback and lettered by Dave Sharpe) sees Stormcaster return. Thor and Storm simultaneously use Mjolnir to destroy the false hammer. However, until now it was never clear whether Storm was actually worthy of wielding Mjolnir by herself.






 Where Does Divinity Come From in the Marvel Universe? 


          

A classic question in both fiction and philosophy is whether gods are created through worship. Loki: Agent of Asgard #17 (written by Al Ewing, illustrated by Lee Garbett, colored by Antonia Fabela and lettered by Clayton Cowles) Loki broaches the question of whether Those Who Sit Above in Shadow, the self-described Gods of the Asgardian Gods, were created because the Asgardians believed them into existence much like humanity potentially believed the Asgardians to life. If Storm has worshipers and followers, then the line between humanity and divinity theoretically blurs, even before mentioning how the X-Men’s own goddess is worthy of the title of Thor.



The Immortal Thor #4 is available now from Marvel Comics.
