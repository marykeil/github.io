## Literature Review

The Thanos-Copter has a more significant chapter in the history of memes than it does in Marvel Comics, and now, Thanos found its perfect replacement!




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Thanos #2 Thanos’ infamous Thanos-Copter has been the focus of seemingly unending ridicule in recent years, especially in the form of increasingly hilarious memes that have been circulating the internet ever since Thanos became a household name. And now, after all the memes, Thanos finally replaces the Thanos-Copter with something that is somehow even wilder.




The Thanos-Copter made its first appearance in Spidey Super Stories #39 by Nick Sullivan, Michael Siporin, Jim Salicrup, and Win Mortimer. Upon its debut, fans may have found it comical that someone like Thanos - who has always been an Avengers-level threat since his first appearance in Iron Man #55 - would fly a helicopter that seemed to be little more than a giant advertisement for himself, as if he got a cut of the potential toy sales or something. However, it wouldn’t be until Thanos was made the ultimate ‘big bad’ of the MCU that the Thanos-Copter memes started flooding the internet.

The idea that a cosmic villain powerful enough to solo the MCU’s entire hero roster - Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc. - once flew around in a toyetic helicopter was too hilarious to ignore. The MCU even got in on the joke by including a Thanos-Copter cameo in season 1 of Loki. Despite barely appearing in the comics at all, the Thanos-Copter took on a life of its own as a wildly popular meme template/subject. One would think that after all that ridicule online, Thanos would take the hint and start using vehicles that were a bit less silly. One would be wrong.

                  &#34;The Big Stick&#34;: The Ultimate Anti-Thanos Weapon Is Finally Unleashed by the Illuminati   The Illuminati have come face-to-face with Thanos right after his recent return to Marvel canon, and they&#39;re about to unleash their ultimate weapon.    


 Thanos Got An Even Sillier Vehicle Than The Thanos-Copter: A ‘Thanos-Convertible’ 
          




In Thanos #2 by Christopher Cantwell and Luca Pizzari, Thanos has effectively kidnapped the entire city of Fresno, California, as he quite literally uprooted the city and marooned it in space, and only he has the power to return it to Earth. Thanos did this in an effort to find one person, a human containing the essence of the one and only entity Thanos ever loved: Mistress Death.

Unfortunately for Thanos, the Illuminati hitched a ride on the space-bound city as Thanos ‘kidnapped’ it, and are fighting Thanos with everything they have throughout this entire issue. However, everything they had obviously wasn’t enough, as Thanos defeats every member before making his escape from the immediate battle-area in an all-new vehicle of his own design: a ‘Thanos-Convertible’.



 Thanos Looks Way Funnier Driving His New Convertible Than The Thanos-Copter 
          




Thanos’ head and shoulders protrude through the roof of this otherwise ordinary truck, with the rest of his body perfectly postured for safe driving, and even his hands are positioned at 10 and 2 on the steering wheel. He looks like a Flintstone-esque cartoon character, and the visual is only half the reason why seeing Thanos drive this car is so hilarious. This is a guy who - in this storyline - ripped an entire city from the Earth and positioned it in space in order to hunt for the human embodiment of Mistress Death, and here he is driving a regular truck that’s obviously way too small for him, and he’s doing it like it’s the most natural thing in the world. At least the Thanos-Copter was proportioned correctly, as it was very clearly made for Thanos specifically, but Thanos driving this homemade convertible is just absurd in the funniest way possible.

The ‘Thanos-Convertible’ may not have the same level of branding as the Thanos-Copter (or even Thanos’ more official Thanosmobile), and it certainly doesn’t hold the same level of infamy in the realm of perpetually-circulating memes, but that doesn’t detract from how unarguably silly this new vehicle really is, making it Thanos’ perfect replacement for the Thanos-Copter.




Thanos #2 by Marvel Comics is available now.
