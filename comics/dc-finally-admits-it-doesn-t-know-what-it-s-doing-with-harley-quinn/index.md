# DC Finally Admits It Doesn t Know What It s Doing with Harley Quinn


## SUMMARY 



  Harley Quinn questions her purpose in the DC Universe, feeling uncertain about her ultimate role.   The lack of consistency in Harley&#39;s characterization compared to other DC characters is acknowledged.   DC needs to define and establish what Harley Quinn truly represents and stands for in order to bring clarity to the character.

## Literature Review

Harley Quinn might be outrageously popular, but sheâ€™s taking a pause to ask herself what is is that truly defines her in the DC Universe.




Warning! Preview pages for Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder #6 ahead!A candid aside from Harley Quinn reveals her thoughts on her place in the DC Universe. For the last several years, Harley&#39;s been on a wild journey that&#39;s seen her become one of the biggest comic book icons around. But even she&#39;s confused about what her ultimate purpose is.




In a preview for Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder #6&#39;s story &#34;Harleys All the Way Down&#34; by Bruno Redondo, a giant dodo covered in explosives is running amok in Gotham. The Bat-Family is on the scene handling it, but Batgirl asks the question everyone&#39;s mind: &#34;What&#39;s Harley doing here?&#34;.

         

Harley contemplates the question and hops out of the story to address it. She&#39;s just as confused by her presence in the story and talks about her role in the grand scheme of things. She notes that unlike her, other heroes such as Batman, Flash and even Aquaman all have core concepts that stay consistent through various mediums and adaptations.


 Harley Quinn Has No Clue What Her &#39;Thing&#39; Is in the DC Universe 
          




Once upon a time, Harley Quinn was relegated to the role of the Joker&#39;s sidekick. However, after years by the Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s side, Harley struck out on her own and went on a journey of exploration to discover what it was she wanted out of life. In that time, she&#39;s been a member of the Suicide Squad, a gang leader, and an independent force of chaos. However, despite her proclivity for mischief, Harley&#39;s also been an ally to the Bat-Family and even worked alongside various Justice League members. As her popularity increased, there has never been a place where Harley Quinn hasn&#39;t fit in.

Despite her current prominence, Harley is right on the money in that there&#39;s a lack of consistency in her characterization compared to other DC characters. Some adaptations portray her as a villain while others go for a more misunderstood prankster who&#39;s trying to be good. Part of this imbalance in Harley is due to her long journey of growth and development. She first became popular when she was still more villainous. Now she&#39;s more on the side of the angels (even if she is a bit chaotic). But she&#39;s portrayed so differently through different adaptations and other stories that it&#39;s hard to pin down what makes Harley &#39;Harley&#39;.






 DC Needs to Figure Out What Harley Quinn&#39;s Deal Is 
          

It&#39;s not that Harley Quinn isn&#39;t a good character or that she serves no purpose in the DCU. She&#39;s just had a bit more trouble defining what she does and stands for. Her popularity has put her all over the map, but there hasn&#39;t been enough work done to establish what the core of Harley Quinn stands for. Hopefully, by having her pop out of the story to address this issue head-on, it will give readers some insight into Harley Quinn and what she&#39;s all about.

Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder #6 will be available from DC Comics on December 19th.
