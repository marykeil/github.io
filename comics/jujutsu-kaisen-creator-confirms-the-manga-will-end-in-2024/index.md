## Literature Review

Gege Akutami has confirmed during the latest Jump Festa that Jujutsu Kaisen will most likely end in 2024.




The creator of Jujutsu Kaisen, Gege Akutami, has revealed during Jump Festa that the manga is almost at its conclusion and will most likely end in 2024. The series is at its climax, with the main villain Sukuna fully awakening, and the death of major characters.




During the Jujutsu Kaisen panel in Jump Festa 2024, the voice actor of Megumi Fushiguro, Yuma Uchida, read a message from Gege Akutami to the audience and viewers from around the world.


 

The message, shared on X by many news accounts including Shonen Jump News (@WSJ_manga), said that this year might be the last time that Jujutsu Kaisen will make an appearance at Jump Festa, as he predicts that it will end in 2024.

The panel was hosted by the voice actors of Sukuna, Megumi Fushiguro, and Gojo Satoru, who revealed the new cover of Volume 25, featuring Sukuna. They also announced that the manga passed 90 million copies sold, making it one of the most successful manga of all time, as it&#39;s bound to pass the 100 million mark. Finally, a teaser video (shared on X by @DbsContents) of upcoming chapters was shown to viewers, with the voice actors giving life to the fight between Gojo and Sukuna, reading their lines from the manga. There was a lot of good news, but it was soured by the author&#39;s message that the series would be ending very soon.





 

It makes sense, however, that Jujutsu Kaisen will be ending in 2024, given how everything built up to this final arc. The showdown between the main characters and the final villains has always been the ending point for most shonen series. Although a new villain could be introduced, like in the case of Black Clover, to extend the story, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for Jujutsu Kaisen as Sukuna has been built as the main boss from the very beginning.

          

It is important to note that many manga authors have stated in the past that they will finish the series by a certain point, but end up taking longer than promised, like in the case of Kohei Horikoshi&#39;s My Hero Academia and Eiichiro Oda&#39;s One Piece. Jujutsu Kaisen fans would surely like to experience it for as long as possible, but a good ending is also very important to establish the legacy of a series.
