# Omni-Man s Original Codename Was a Huge Clue to Invincible s Big Twist (But Also a Legal Nightmare)


## SUMMARY 



  Omni-Man was originally named Supra-Man, but Image Comics had to change the name due to concerns about infringing on DC Comics&#39; Superman trademark.   Invincible was originally codenamed Bulletproof, but Image Comics asked for a name change to avoid confusion with another comic. The name was then given to another character, Zandale Randolph.   The original codenames for Omni-Man and Invincible provided clues to their true natures, with &#39;Supra-Man&#39; hinting at Omni-Man&#39;s disdain for humanity.

## Literature Review

Invincible&#39;s creators have revealed that Omni-Man and Invincible were conceived with different names and costumes - but legal fears led to changes.




While the Viltrumite warrior Omni-Man is now an icon following Invincible&#39;s amazing success, the dark take on Superman actually started out with a different codename and design. However, the initial concept for what would become Omni-Man had to be changed due to fears of infringing on DC Comics&#39; most famous trademark.




Recently, Image Comics released Invincible Undeluxe (from Robert Kirkman and Corey Walker) - a black and white version of the original series&#39; first issue, including creator notes and concept art. A play on the ongoing Walking Dead Deluxe - which adds color to the original black and white horror comic courtesy of Dave McCaig - Invincible Undeluxe has a lot to offer fans, including the original names and designs of Invincible and Omni-Man.



          

Alongside some concept art sketches, Kirkman explains that Omni-Man was originally named &#39;Supra-Man&#39; with the nickname &#39;the Man of Stuff.&#39; The character&#39;s codename, nickname and costume are clearly meant to evoke DC&#39;s Man of Steel, aka Superman. Sadly, the comparison was a little too direct. Kirkman notes:





Image made us change it, fearing that DC might not enjoy us using a name that when pronounced out loud is almost impossible to distinguish from their beloved trademark character.


 : Even The Boys&#39; Producers Admit &#34;Omni-Man Would Trash Homelander&#34; (According to Invincible&#39;s Creator)


 Omni-Man Was Originally Called Supra-Man 
Image Changed His Codename, Fearing Legal Issues with DC&#39;s Superman
          

While the reference to Superman is still clear with the Omni-Man name, one benefit of the original codename was lost in the change. In its earliest and most stunning twist, Invincible reveals that rather than being a benevolent protector, Omni-Man is actually an alien invader who plans to conquer Earth for his home planet, the fascistic Viltrum. Omni-Man goes on to murder many of Earth&#39;s superheroes, and becomes a major antagonist to his son Mark Grayson, aka Invincible. With &#39;Supra&#39; meaning &#39;above/beyond,&#39; his original codename was a veiled clue to his true nature - someone who sees himself as above humanity, and inherently superior to the entire species (who he describes as household pets when compared to Viltrumites.)






 Invincible Also Began Life with a Different Codename 
Mark Grayson&#39;s Original Codename Went to Another Hero
          

The issue also reveals that Invincible himself was originally imagined with the codename &#39;Bulletproof.&#39; Image also asked that this name be changed, as it was also publishing Bulletproof Monk and didn&#39;t want any confusion. Unlike &#39;Supra-Man,&#39; the name wasn&#39;t forgotten, and was instead given to Zandale Randolph, who eventually ended up wearing the Invincible costume while Mark was out of action - a bizarre echo of the original change where Bulletproof again &#39;became&#39; Invincible.

In Invincible Undeluxe, Kirkman says &#34;Thank God for small miracles,&#34; acknowledging that the franchise has found immense success with his second choice of codenames for its most iconic characters. However, it&#39;s fascinating for fans to see how Invincible and Omni-Man started life - and to know that Nolan&#39;s dark side was originally meant to be foreshadowed by a pitch-perfect clue.
