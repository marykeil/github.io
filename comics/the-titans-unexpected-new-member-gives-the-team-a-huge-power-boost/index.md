## Literature Review

Despite already having an all-star line-up of heroes, the Titans just added a strong new member who will dramatically raise the team&#39;s power level.





Summary

  Titans #5 introduces Swamp Thing as a surprise new member of the team, significantly boosting the team&#39;s power and making them even more powerful.   Levi Kamei, the new Swamp Thing, is a relatively new hero in the DC Universe and serves as the guardian and voice of Earth&#39;s plant life.   The Titans invite Swamp Thing to join them as part of their initiative to make the world a better place, solidifying their mission to actively fix the planet&#39;s problems rather than just fighting villains.  







The Titans have taken an expanded role within the DC Universe, replacing the Justice League as Earth&#39;s premier superhero team. The roster — including Nightwing, Starfire, Donna Troy, Cyborg, Beast Boy, Raven, and the Flash — already includes a number of heavy hitters. Even with these heroes, the Titans&#39; surprise new member Swamp Thing marks a powerful step-up for the group.

Titans #5 by Tom Taylor and Nicola Scott picks up amid the Titans&#39; reforestation effort in Borneo, led by Beast Boy. After facing down the Demolition Team, Gar nearly loses his cool, saying that he just wants a way to fix the situation. Raven then brings Beast Boy and company to the New York apartment of Levi Kamei, DC&#39;s new Swamp Thing, to fold him into the effort.

          




After successfully restoring the Borneo wildlife, the Titans officially offer Swamp Thing a part-time spot on the team — massively boosting the team&#39;s power by adding a single new member.

 Swamp Thing Just Became a Titan 
          

Levi Kamei is a relatively new hero in the DC Universe, first appearing during DC&#39;s Infinite Frontier era. Kamei was created by Ram V, who described the character as the first Indian lead in DC Comics, and Mike Perkins. After having rituals performed upon himself as a young child, Levi was eventually chosen to be the Swamp Thing and the Avatar of the Green after the apparent death of Alec Holland. Now, after accepting his role as the guardian and voice of Earth&#39;s plant life, Kamei continues to serve as the Swamp Thing.




The Titans ask Swamp Thing to join their team as a part of their initiative to make the world a better place. Rather than simply fighting bad guys, the group wants to take a more active hand in fixing the planet&#39;s problems, hence their massive reforestation effort following a devastating incident in Titans #2. As Beast Boy tells Kamei, &#34;It would make a lot of sense for the planet to have a representative on our team.&#34; It&#39;s a touching moment, as Swamp Thing accepts the part-time role to lesson both his burdens and his loneliness — a nice change of pace for an often tragic and isolated character.



 Swamp Thing Makes the Titans Even More Powerful 
          

The Titans already had an all-star line-up, with several Justice League-level heroes stepping up to take the League&#39;s place following the Dark Crisis event. Still, Swamp Thing&#39;s inclusion will provide a massive power-up for the group, even in his part-time capacity. Swamp Thing&#39;s functional immortality and practical invulnerability often rank him among the most powerful heroes in the DC universe. Through his connection to the Green and ability to manipulate plant life across the world in a number of ways, Levi is instantly one of the team&#39;s strongest members. With Beast World just around the corner, the Titans may need a hero as mighty as Swamp Thing.






Titans #5 is available now from DC Comics.
