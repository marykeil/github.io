## Literature Review

The original Mighty Morphin team was long considered the first Power Rangers squad, but the expanding lore of the comic books has revealed otherwise.




The original Mighy Morphin team is considered by many to be the first Power Rangers squad assembled by Zordon, but the expanding lore of Boom! Studios Rangers comic books revealed otherwise. As Boom! continues to expand franchise lore, one significant change has clarified that earlier Ranger squads pre-dated the classic 1990s team.




Boom! Studios&#39; ongoing Power Rangers series has effectively expanded the franchise in the comic book medium, telling epic, sprawling stories that the TV series couldn&#39;t.

          

Notably, Boom! has expanded the history of the Rangers to include multiple teams – particularly the Omega Rangers, the Solar Rangers, and Zordon&#39;s first batch of teenagers with attitude in 1969 – that predate the first season of Power Rangers. The new addition of old teams goes a long way toward expanding the franchise as a whole; in fact, it is one of the critical elements needed to ensure Power Rangers continues to thrive in the long-term.


 Boom! Studios Revealed The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Predecessors 
         




The first time Boom! Studios comics established there were Ranger teams before the iconic 1990s incarnation occurred in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #20. In 1969, when the Psycho Green Ranger tried to free Rita Repulsa from her moon prison, Zordon assembled five teenage heroes teens, led by Grace Sterling – who the issue reveals pre-dates Lauren Shiba and Amelia Jones, chronologically, as the first female Red Ranger. On short notice with no training, they sprung into action – much like Jason&#39;s team in the &#34;Day of the Dumpster&#34; pilot episode – but it was far less successful, as three of Grace&#39;s Rangers were killed before they defeated Psycho Green.



Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #20 was written by Kyle Higgins, with art by Daniele Di Nicuolo, Walter Baiamonte, and Ed Dukeshire.




Across subsequent issues, franchise lore would expand further. During the &#34;Beyond the Grid&#34; storyline, it was revealed that thousands of years ago, Morphin Master Praetor created the original Solar Rangers, before murdering them when they didn&#39;t live up to his expectations. Even before that, Power Rangers Unlimited: The Death Ranger #1 showcased the original Omega Rangers, who were active centuries ago, on the home planet of the Morphin Masters. The one-shot also gave the origin story for Spa&#39;ark, the Gold Omega Ranger, who would become the Death Ranger.






Power Rangers Unlimited: The Death Ranger #1 was written by Paul Allor, with art by Kath Lobo, Anna Kekovsky Chandra Fabi Marques, Sara Antonellini, and Sharon Marino.






 The Power Rangers Franchise Thrives On New Lore 
          

Expanding the lore with surprising details of the universe&#39;s history helps advance the ongoing storylines of the comics, but it also does so much more than that. Expanding the lore in mediums outside the TV shows progresses the entire franchise, with the lore of the comics and the TV series&#39; feeding into one another. For instance, the origin story of Heckyl gaining his Dark Ranger powers was told in the comics. before he actually debuted in costume in last year&#39;s Cosmic Fury. During the same season, there was a massive spotlight on the Morphin Masters, just a few years after the comics revealed their origin story.




BOOM! Studios&#39; comics have proven to be a tool that informs readers of the larger legacy behind the Power Rangers teams, while also offering a new context to storylines that affect the universe&#39;s past, present, and future. In that sense, the comics produced for the franchise are able to complement the TV shows significantly. Fans can enjoy the show without the comics, but engaging with the franchises in all mediums enhances the audience&#39;s experience. The more that BOOM! Studios continues to expand on the lore within the Power Rangers universe, the more it helps offer longevity to the franchise as a whole.
