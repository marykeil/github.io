## Literature Review

Green Lanternâ€™s been pulling off several tricks with his new ring, but his latest feat gives him a power that puts him on par with Superman. 




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #5!Watch out Superman, because Green Lantern&#39;s new Power Ring is giving him a surprising Kryptonian power. Hal Jordan may not be a part of the Green Lantern Corps any longer, but he&#39;s still got a ring and is still in the superhero biz. And as the Emerald Knight continues to push his abilities, he&#39;s found a way to unlock a classic Superman power.




In Green Lantern #5 by Jeremy Adams and Xermanico, Hal Jordan&#39;s nemesis Sinestro has returned, and he&#39;s taken control of Ferris Air&#39;s drones. As the villain uses them to bomb various cities, Green Lantern springs into action to stop him.

          

Unfortunately, one of Carol Ferris&#39; new drones has a cloaking device that bends light to hide itself from sight. With that in mind, Green Lantern uses his new Power Ring to filter various lights from his vision. Hal&#39;s ring easily helps him find the drone, allowing him to destroy it, which sends Sinestro into a fit of rage.


 Green Lantern&#39;s Ring Gives Him &#39;X-Ray&#39; Vision 
          




Hal Jordan quit his beloved Green Lantern Corps after the United Planets assumed control of the organization. While Jordan no longer serves the Corps, he was able to fashion a brand-new ring from his own willpower. However, it lacks the artificial intelligence his previous ring possessed and it doesn&#39;t allow for interstellar travel. However, Hal&#39;s new Power Ring has a few tricks of its own. During Green Lantern&#39;s first flight with his ring, he discovered he could refract the light differently and give his constructs a more lifelike appearance.

Green Lantern has been wondering what else his ring could do and it looks like he&#39;s found an extension of his new Power Ring&#39;s light-based abilities. Up until now, if something was out of sight or able to hide in plain sight, Hal was simply out of luck. Now that his ring can filter out various lights, he has a much better chance against enemies that can cloak themselves. Usually, when it comes to finding threats that are capable of hiding from the naked eye, it&#39;s Superman who can figure out where things are. If Green Lantern can figure out how to master &#39;x-ray&#39; vision, could he wind up becoming even more powerful than Superman?






 Green Lantern is Becoming a Superman-Level Rival 
          

It&#39;s hard to match the raw power of the Man of Steel, but Hal&#39;s new ring seems to be helping him get there. He&#39;s already improved on what the standard Power Rings are capable of, and his latest hack is giving him vision comparable to Superman. It&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility that Hal might be able to go even further and find ways of creating stronger constructs or even gain enhanced strength. While it may take him a while to get on the same level as Superman, Hal is breaking all the rules when it comes to his new ring. Now that Green Lantern has accessed one Kryptonian power, it could be just a matter of time before he gains another.

Green Lantern #5 is on sale now from DC Comics.
