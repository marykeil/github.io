# Why PREY s Yautja Are Deadlier Than the Modern Day Species - Predator Theory Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Advanced technology makes the Predators worse hunters, as it lessens their skills and instincts.   In Predator vs Wolverine, Logan notes, &#34;The fancier the tech, the cockier you get, and the more detached you are from the musk and bloodbeat of the thing you want dead.&#34;   As stories like Prey move away from the modern day, Predators actually get deadlier because they have to rely on their instincts, not tech.

## Literature Review

As the Predator franchise begins exploring older versions of the Yautja, it&#39;s beginning to seem like they were originally far deadlier hunters.




Warning: contains spoilers for Predator vs Wolverine #4!The Predator franchise is teasing that the Yautja species may actually have become weaker over time, with the alien killer seen in Prey among the franchise&#39;s deadliest ever. It&#39;s an intriguing idea that stresses some of the major themes of the franchise and corresponds with the ideas set up in the movies.




In Benjamin Percy and Ken Lashley&#39;s Predator vs. Wolverine #4, Logan undertakes his final battle against the Yautja that&#39;s been hunting him for a century. In their last bout, the Yautja lost its helmet, which was revealed to have been used in Weapon X&#39;s experiments on Wolverine. However, the lost gear also gave Logan a way to draw his foe back out into the open.

         

Using the helmet to lure the Predator to the Canadian wilderness, Wolverine notes that he could have gained an advantage by sabotaging it, rather than letting the Predator reclaim its armor. However, he also explains why he didn&#39;t - the better their technology, the worse that Yautja become as hunters. As Logan notes, &#34;over and over again, technology has been the yautja&#39;s failing.&#34;




                  2023 Changed Predator Lore Forever, Transforming the Original Trilogy&#39;s Meaning   2023 revealed why the Predators were really on Earth in the original movies, and made their treatment of humans far more psychologically disturbing.   


 Advanced Technology Makes the Predators Worse Hunters 
The Yautja Are Deadlier Without the Crutch of Advanced Weaponry
         

​​​​Predator vs Wolverine follows a century-long battle between Wolverine and a deadly Yautja who considers him the ultimate prey - partly because of the unbreakable adamantium coating his bones. The two have clashed again and again, with Logan often winning not because he&#39;s the better hunter, but because he figures out a way to turn the Predator&#39;s hi-tech equipment against it. Wolverine has attacked the Predator with its own glaive, blinded its heat vision by creating an underwater cloud of his own blood, and eventually wins by creating a mud-covered decoy that the Yautja assumes is a way to trick its tech. All the way, the Yautja&#39;s tech makes it more powerful but also creates a host of weaknesses that Wolverine is able to exploit, just as Predator&#39;s heroes always have, going back to Dutch covering himself in mud.




Not only does Logan start using the Yautja&#39;s tech to his advantage, but he notes that being able to rely on sci-fi weaponry actually lessens the Predator&#39;s own skills and instincts. Wolverine works out that the Predator has become so reliant on tech that it&#39;s started to prioritize the input of its gadgets over its own instincts. He explains:


The fancier the tech, the cockier you get, and the more detached you are from the musk and bloodbeat of the thing you want dead.




 The Ultimate Predator Would Be a Yautja Without Sci-Fi Technology 
The Predators&#39; Ethos Has Been Corrupted Over Time - Which Makes Older Stories Even More Exciting
         

This idea is perfectly represented in Prey, which is set in 1719 and follows a Predator with less advanced technology. This Predator is particularly ruthless, savvy, and vicious in a way that certainly makes it seem deadlier than the plasmacaster-wielding grunts seen in movies like Alien vs Predator. Ultimately, this Predator is only taken down when its advanced tech is turned against it by Naru, raising the question of how a human could beat a Yautja without technological advantages to turn against it. The franchise seems to support the idea that the more stripped-down and unsophisticated a Predator is technologically, the deadlier it becomes.




While Predators have their own code of honor, the franchise ultimately criticizes them as a parody of big-game hunters. They come far, far better equipped than their prey and are usually righteously defeated by victims who are fighting for their lives while the Yautja fight for sport. Because of this, the Predators&#39; technology will always ultimately be their Achilles Hell, as it&#39;s the thematic symbol of their arrogance and unfair advantage. However, with stories like Prey traveling back in time and depicting Predators who are less technologically overwhelming - and Marvel exploring the lore in various comic series - it&#39;s possible that fans will get to see a pure Predator at some point in the future - one whose skills and instincts haven&#39;t been blunted by a reliance on tech.
