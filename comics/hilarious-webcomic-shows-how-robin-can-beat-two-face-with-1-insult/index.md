# Hilarious Webcomic Shows How Robin Can Beat Two-Face with 1 Insult


## SUMMARY 



  Robin defeats Two-Face with a low blow insult, showing that a joke can be more powerful than weapons.   The webcomic received positive reception for its absurd and hilarious concept of defeating a dangerous villain with a cruel remark.   In canon, Two-Face would likely respond with violence, but the comic strip presents a fun and unexpected twist on the characters.

## Literature Review

In a humorous Batman comic by artist Raul Higuera, Robin defeats Two-Face, but not with advanced tech or weapons. Just a cold, hard insult.




Instead of weapons or martial arts skills, all Robin needs to defeat Two-Face is a devastating insult. Over the years, several Boys Wonder have gone up against the terrifying, bifurcated villain to varying degrees of success. But one humorous webcomic reveals all that&#39;s really needed is a joke that aims below the belt.




On X, artist Raul Higuera posted a comic with the message &#34;That&#39;s low Batman&#34;. The comic sees Batman&#39;s classic nemesis Two-Face, who has captured the Dark Knight in an electric chair and is about to kill him. But before Harvey Dent can act, Batman calls for Robin to remember what he learned about Two-Face.


 

The Boy Wonder springs into action and starts bobbing and weaving around the villain saying that fighting an ugly foe like Two-Face is tough because &#34;They got nothing to lose&#34;. Two-Face puts a pause on the fight and starts crying as Robin looks on awkwardly while Batman apologizes for having to do that.


 Robin&#39;s Harshest Insult Stops Two-Face in His Tracks 
          




When it comes to Batman&#39;s rogues, few are as devious as Harvey Dent&#39;s worst half. Though Harvey&#39;s persona, a former district attorney, has a strong sense of judgment, he&#39;s often shut down by his more violent and unhinged split personality Two-Face. The villain is one of the biggest players in Gotham City&#39;s criminal underground and he&#39;s proven to be challenging to the Bat-Family. Two-Face has had numerous encounters with Batman and his allies, especially Dick Grayson, whom Dent almost murdered in the past. While Batman may desire to save his friend from his worst self, Two-Face could be too far gone to truly help.

Higuera&#39;s comic was received quite well on X, gathering several thousand likes and several hundred accounts reposting it. While it&#39;s an absurd idea that Two-Face would end a fight over being insulted, seeing it in action is hilarious. Not only does Robin deliver the cruel remark perfectly, but he learned that move from Batman, implying the Dark Knight has similarly brought Two-Face down by mocking his looks. It&#39;s a bit cruel and not exactly the behavior one would expect from a superhero. But the fact that it manages to defeat one of the most dangerous crime bosses in Gotham is a hilarious and frankly inspired idea.






 Could Robin Defeat Two-Face in Canon with an Insult? 
          

While Higuera&#39;s comic is a fun idea, the canon Two-Face would more than likely respond to an insult like that with a shot to the face. But comic strips like this are fun because they play with characters in fun ways. Rather than Batman teaching Robin a cool move that Two-Face doesn&#39;t see coming, he just delivers a cruel remark. It&#39;s unexpected but darkly humorous. Sure, the Boy Wonder isn&#39;t likely to say something like that to Dent&#39;s face (either of them). But seeing Robin defeat Two-Face with something as unpredictable as a harsh insult is pretty damn funny.
