## Literature Review

Super-Man and Bat-man, two heroes from the Justice League of China, are calling it quits after Kenan Kong chooses to join the Super-Family.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1059!A beloved Justice League friendship has just broken up. For months, Kenan Kong, the Super-Man of China, has become a permanent member of the new and improved Super-Family. However, a new story reveals the reason for Kenan&#39;s placement on the team and the close friendship he was forced to sacrifice.




In Action Comics #1059&#39;s story &#34;Secret Identity Part Two&#34; by Gene Luen Yang and Viktor Bogdanovic, Kenan recovers from the psychic attack brought on by learning Superman&#39;s secret identity. Super-Man pieces together that a recent reporter&#39;s death must have been caused by a similar attack. At the same time, Super-Man&#39;s ally Baixi, aka Bat-Man from the Justice League of China arrives to aid his friend.

          

Super-Man tries to explain the reporter&#39;s death to Bat-Man, but realizes he can&#39;t without putting Bat-Man at risk. To keep Baixi safe, Kenan obstructs Bat-Man&#39;s investigation and sides with the Super-Family. While his plan works, Super-Man&#39;s partnership with Bat-Man is left destroyed.


 The Justice League of China&#39;s Super-Man and Bat-Man Friendship is Over 
          




Kenan Kong was once nothing more than an average bully until he was recruited by China&#39;s Ministry of Self-Reliance to become the nation&#39;s new hero, Super-Man. As Super-Man, he was placed on a team with other government-backed heroes Bat-Man and Wonder-Woman to create the Justice League of China. While the team operated as an official arm of the Chinese government, the heroes eventually broke out on their own and became a private entity, free from any influence. Though Kenan was hard-headed, he eventually grew into a leader who gained the respect of his friends, including Bat-Man.

No one was more critical of Kenan on the Justice League of China than Baixi. To be fair, when they first met, Kenan was a fool at best and a jerk at worst. But as Kenan mastered his powers, he softened and developed a powerful bond with his League comrades. Unfortunately, that growth is the same reason that Super-Ma isn&#39;t being completely honest with Bat-Man. Kenan knows that Baixi is just as dedicated to solving mysteries as Batman and won&#39;t stop digging until he discovers that Clark Kent is Superman (the knowledge of which will kill Baixi). Sadly, the only way Super-Man could protect his friend was by betraying him for the Super-Family.






 Super-Man Joining the Super-Family Was a Sacrifice 
          

It&#39;s sad to see Super-Man and Bat-Man become enemies, as their developing friendship was one of the best parts of Kenan&#39;s previous title, New Super-Man. But turning against his friend and keeping him at a distance is the only way Kenan can keep Baixi safe for now. It&#39;s not a permanent solution, because if Bat-Man is anything like his inspiration, he&#39;ll keep digging until he finds answers. While it isn&#39;t what Super-Man wanted to do, he sacrificed his relationship with his Justice League ally to keep him alive.

Action Comics #1059 is on sale now from DC Comics.
