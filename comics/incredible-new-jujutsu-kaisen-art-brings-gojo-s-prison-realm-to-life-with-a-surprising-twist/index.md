# Incredible New Jujutsu Kaisen Art Brings Gojo s Prison Realm to Life With a Surprising Twist


## SUMMARY 



  Cosplayer and streamer @ChuRuuna created a fan art cake based on the infamous Prison Realm from Jujutsu Kaisen, capturing its unique cube-like shape and worn texture.   The artist added a special touch by replacing the cube&#39;s red eyes with Gojo&#39;s blue pupils, giving the impression that he is trapped inside the cake.   Kenjaku&#39;s plan to trap Gojo in the Prison Realm required years of work and preparation, but he could have easily lured him with ChuRuuna&#39;s cake due to Gojo&#39;s love for sweets.

## Literature Review

 A unique piece of fan art from ChuRuuna on X reinvents Gojo&#39;s prison realm from Jujutsu Kaisen in a fun – and delicious – way.




Evil sorcerer Kenjaku made waves in season 2 of Jujutsu Kaisen when he sealed Satoru Gojo away into a prison realm after ambushing him in Geto&#39;s body. Now, a fan of the series has put a delicious twist on one of the most dramatic moments in Jujutsu Kaisen.




In a new piece of fan art shared on her X (formerly Twitter) account, cosplayer and streamer @ChuRuuna recreated the infamous Prison Realm as a cake. Just like its depiction in the manga, ChuRuuna perfectly recreates its cube-like shape, with the texture of the frosting adding a more worn look than its depiction in the manga or anime. That unique look makes it seem even more suitable for its purpose within the series.


 

ChuRuuna covered the cake interior with a matte gray frosting. With a special touch, the artist replaced the cube&#39;s red eyes with Gojo&#39;s piercing blue pupils – as if he&#39;s literally trapped inside the cake looking out at whoever is about to eat it. It&#39;s an amazing piece of food fan art that looks as delicious as it does ominous.





 Kenjaku Spent Years Trying To Eliminate Gojo

Kenjaku&#39;s original plan to trap Gojo in the Prison Realm involved years of hard work, preparation, and planning. Kenjaku believed all the work was necessary to avoid alerting Gojo&#39;s Six Eyes ability. With Six Eyes, it&#39;s impossible to physically surprise Gojo unless he&#39;s distracted. The problem was that once the Prison Realm cube was activated, it needed about a minute to fully seal its victim. To overcome this, Kenjaku came up with a cruel plan.

Kenjaku&#39;s cursed technique allows him to take over any body by implanting his brain in them. Years before, Gojo was forced to kill his best friend Suguru Geto after he went rogue. After possessing Geto&#39;s corpse, Kenjaku waited for the perfect opportunity. Years later, after the chaos of the Shibuya Incident, Kenjaku sprung his trap. As expected, Gojo recognized the Prison Realm beginning to activate and began to turn away. Just then, Kenjaku appeared before him as Geto, causing a single moment of hesitation. That single moment however lasted a whole minute in Gojo&#39;s head, as he relived the events seen in the &#34;Gojo&#39;s Past&#34; arc, and it was all that the Prison Realm needed to seal Gojo away.




          

Kenjaku could have saved years&#39; worth of trouble if he just knew of Gojo&#39;s culinary tastes. A habitual sweet tooth, Gojo&#39; was always on the lookout for interesting sweets and cakes to try out. In &#34;Summer of Ashes, Autumn of Dust&#34;, a Jujutsu Kaisen light novel by Gege Akutami and Ballad Kitaguni, Gojo is observed by Yuji and Megumi spending a whole day eating various cakes, pancakes, and sweets as he walked around Tokyo.

With this understanding of Gojo&#39;s sweet tooth, Kenjaku would have had such an easier time using ChuRuuna&#39;s cake as a lure. Its unique design as the Prison Realm would immediately draw his attention, as would the fact that it looks tasty. That would be all the time necessary for the cube&#39;s seal to activate before he figures out that it&#39;s a sweet trap. However, considering Gojo&#39;s personality in Jujutsu Kaisen, while he might be upset at having gotten tricked by a cake, if it was good - he&#39;d be satisfied that at least his last meal before detention was sweet.
