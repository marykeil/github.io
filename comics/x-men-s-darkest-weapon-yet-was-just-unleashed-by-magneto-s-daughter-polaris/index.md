## Literature Review

Polaris travels to Knowhere in Fall of the House of X #1 to recruit Broo and his legion of Brood, hoping to unleash them on an unsuspecting Orchis.   




Warning: contains spoilers for Fall of the House of X #1The powerful X-Men hero Polaris, daughter of the iconic Magneto, is becoming a major player in the mutant&#39;s final battle against the forces of Orchis, as she brings the terror of the alien Brood to Earth. Traveling to Knowhere in Fall of the House of X #1, Polaris recruits Broo and his legions of Brood to stand with mutantkind, in their escalating war against their many enemies.




Polaris has been missing since the disastrous Hellfire Gala, stuck in a deep depression after the tragic death of her father Magneto on Arakko, and it turns out she has been secretly crafting some major plans while in hiding.



Magneto died at the hands of Uranos in X-Men: Red #7 but will be returning to life in the upcoming Resurrection of Magneto limited series




          

Fall of the House of X #1, from writer Gerry Duggan with artists Lucas Werneck and Bryan Valenza, sees the X-Men gathering their forces to prepare for their final showdown with Orchis, and the ending reveals that Polaris has traveled to Knowhere, in an epic new costume, to recruit the darkest weapon in the X-Men&#39;s armory.





 Polaris And The Brood Are Coming To Destroy Orchis 
          

The Brood has a dark, violent history with the X-Men, and their ally Captain Marvel, operating as Marvel&#39;s version of the Xenomorph from the beloved film Alien. A ruthless species of parasitic bug-like creatures, 99% of the Brood are mindless drones with a single goal: expansion through conquest. It wasn&#39;t until the mutant Brood alien Broo took control of his people during the mutant&#39;s Krakoan Era that their galactic threat subsided. Even so, recent actions by Nightmare caused Broo to lose control of many of the Brood, threatening the galaxy once again.

While the X-Men leader Cyclops wanted to genocide the Brood his wife Jean refused, and instead gave Broo and his people the celestial head known as Knowhere to live within. Lorna Dane knows how powerful the Brood could be as an ally for the X-Men&#39;s cause, and also believes in the legacy her close friend Jean left behind when protecting the Brood from Cyclops. Upon searching for Lorna, Kate finds her seemingly missing, lamenting that the X-Men needed her, unaware that she is secretly bringing them the perfect weapon against Orchis. Arriving at Knowhere, Polaris informs Broo that Jean is dead, before asking if he and his Brood are ready to go to war. Using her incredible magnetic abilities, Polaris begins to drag Knowhere through space back to Earth.






 Lorna Is Powerfully Honoring Her Father&#39;s Legacy 
          

Polaris&#39; new heroic costume is a beautiful homage to her late father - confirmed by the designer of her new look Lucas Werneck - while also giving her a much-needed update to her image. However, Lorna is not only honoring Magneto through her new costume but also through the impressive magnetic feat she is attempting. Time and time again Magneto has pushed himself to the very limits of his abilities to save mutantkind from death and destruction, and now Polaris is taking up the same cause to protect her family and friends.

While Magneto is soon to be resurrected in Resurrection of Magneto, it is clear he would be incredibly proud of his daughter if he could see this powerful feat. The X-Men are going to need all the help they can get to defeat Orchis and the Stark Sentinels, and Polaris&#39;s secret mission to recruit the Brood could be the turning point in the war that prevents the extinction of the mutant race.




Fall of the House of X #1 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
