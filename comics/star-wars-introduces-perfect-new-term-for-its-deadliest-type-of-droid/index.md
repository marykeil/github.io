# Star Wars Introduces Perfect New Term for Its Deadliest Type of Droid


## SUMMARY 



  In the Star Wars crossover &#34;Dark Droids&#34; Triple Zero receives the official designation as a &#34;homicide droid&#34; which is fitting considering his gruesome history and love of killing.   Triple Zero, an evil counterpart to the protocol droid C-3PO, specializes in torture and maiming rather than communication like Threepio. He was created by the Empire and turned on his own creators.   Triple Zero considers BT-1, another deadly droid, to be his only friend due to their shared affinity for mass murder. Their bond is strangely touching in its own horrific way.

## Literature Review

Star Wars&#39; new Dark Droids crossover has introduced a darkly perfect new term for the deadliest type of droid in the established canon.





Summary

  In the Star Wars crossover &#34;Dark Droids&#34; Triple Zero receives the official designation as a &#34;homicide droid&#34; which is fitting considering his gruesome history and love of killing.   Triple Zero, an evil counterpart to the protocol droid C-3PO, specializes in torture and maiming rather than communication like Threepio. He was created by the Empire and turned on his own creators.   Triple Zero considers BT-1, another deadly droid, to be his only friend due to their shared affinity for mass murder. Their bond is strangely touching in its own horrific way.  







One of Star Wars&#39; deadliest droids just received the perfect designation. As seen in the new Dark Droids crossover, none other than 0-0-0 and BT-1 have agreed to ally themselves with R2-D2 in the tie-in series D-Squad, hoping to take on the sentient AI virus known as the Scourge who&#39;s corrupting all of droid-kind (and soon organics). Now, Triple Zero has received a new name that he absolutely loves in the established Star Wars timeline.

As seen in Star Wars: Dark Droids: D-Squad by Marc Guggenheim and Salva Espín, Artoo is assembling his very own &#34;Droid Avengers&#34; known as D-Squad to save C-3PO who&#39;s been corrupted by The Scourge. Having run into IG-88 and 4-LOM who were after the bounty on Triple Zero in D-Squad #3, IG-88 refers to his target as a &#34;homicide droid&#34;. Hilariously, Triple Zero couldn&#39;t agree with the new name more.

Considering his incredibly bloody history in the Star Wars canon and his love of murdering all forms of life, the name is rather fitting. Likewise, the same name could be attributed to his dark counterpart BT-1, though he already has his own unique designation as a &#34;blastomech&#34; (rather than being an astromech like Artoo).

 Triple Zero Is The Dark Opposite Of Threepio 
Fluent In Multiple Forms Of Torture
          

Essentially, Triple Zero is C-3PO&#39;s evil twin. Firstly, he&#39;s an incredibly dangerous droid despite being the same model as Threepio who&#39;s a protocol droid and fluent in over six million forms of communication. Instead, Triple Zero&#39;s proficiencies are in maiming and multiple forms of torture. To that end, &#34;homicide&#34; is a far better name as opposed to &#34;protocol&#34;, having been created by the Empire&#39;s Tarkin Initiative to be one of its most lethal agents before he turned on and killed his own creators.




It&#39;s also worth noting that Triple Zero was once in the service of Darth Vader along with Beetee, just as Threepio once served his creator Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy of films. Having been deliberately deployed for his deadly skills, it makes sense that he&#39;d receive a more official designation. After all, he&#39;s decidedly NOT a protocol droid.



 Triple Zero Officially Only Has One Friend 
BT-1 and 0-0-0 Are Friends For A Dark Reason
          

Beyond the new term &#34;homicide droid&#34;, Triple Zero later on confirms that BT-1 is his only friend in the darkest way possible. Believing that their shared affinity and acts of mass murder have bonded them together more than any other droids could be, it seems Triple Zero believes he and BeeTee are more than friends. While incredibly horrific, it is sort of sweet in its own horrific way for the deadly Star Wars droid duo.
