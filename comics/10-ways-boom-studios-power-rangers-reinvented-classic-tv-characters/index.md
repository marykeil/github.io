## Literature Review

BOOM! Studios Power Rangers has not only recontextualized classic characters from the show, but in many cases, reinvented them completely.




In the nearly eight years since BOOM! Studios first gained the publishing rights to the Power Rangers franchise, the company has managed to tell increasingly mature stories featuring classic Rangers characters – and in the process, has completely reinvented many of them. In doing so, BOOM! has managed to turn one-dimensional or underutilized characters and add layers to them.
Noting the franchise&#39;s one-dimensional origin isn&#39;t a knock on the show&#39;s creators or its writers. At the end of the day, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and its host of sequels and spin-offs were designed as children&#39;s shows, and thus the stories needed to cater to young viewers. There were exceptions to the rule occasionally, like Lightspeed Rescue&#39;s Titanium Power Ranger and his dark origin story, but most characters – heroes and villains - fall under one-note tropes. Since BOOM! Studios&#39; series mostly cater to an older audience, particularly long-time fans who grew up watching the shows, this has given the comics more room to recontextualize classic characters through darker, more adult-oriented stories.
            
 
 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Reveals Alpha-5&#39;s Final Fate (&amp; It&#39;s Depressing) 
After not being seen for several seasons, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers fan-favorite&#39;s fate is finally revealed, and it is devastating.












 








 10  Lord Zedd Becomes A Power Ranger 
A Villain Gains Hero Powers For A Mighty Upgrade
        

Lord Zedd sported one of the most terrifying designs to appear in any children&#39;s show, and for a time was a perennial threat to the Rangers. More recently, Rita Repulsa grew weary of Lord Zedd, and with a new name and power upgrade, she beat him within an inch of his life, to the point he needed to be rescued by the Rangers. His best shot at redemption turned out to be by becoming a Power Ranger himself. In Power Rangers #16, Zedd planted a device in Zordon&#39;s Command Center to drain Zordon of his power, using it to create his own Morpher, which he unveiled in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #108, before a rematch with Rita.





 9  Kimberly Becomes A Badass 
The Pink Ranger Leads An All-Star Squad
        

Kimberly Hart has arguably gone through the most impressive glow-up of any Ranger during the BOOM! Studios era. For starters, an older future version of herself became an unwilling right-hand-woman of Lord Drakkon – an evil version of Tommy Oliver – during Shattered Grid. Once she broke his mind control, she led her own team of Rangers called the Solar Rangers, and subsequently helped the resistance take Drakkon down for good. In his place, she became the leader of a new world at peace. Meanwhile, the present-day Kimberly has had some stellar moments of her own, such as becoming the Shazam of her world.





 8  Classic Rangers Become The Solar Rangers 
A New Team is Born After Shattered Grid


 







The Solar Rangers team took shape in the direct aftermath of Shattered Grid, during the Beyond the Grid arc. The team comprised Andros from In Space, Mike from Lost Galaxy, Cam from Ninja Storm, Tanya in her Zeo Ranger form, Heckyl from Dino Charge – who makes his in-canon debut as the Dark Ranger during this arc – and, of course, Kimberly from Mighty Morphin. The team would prove to be temporary, as the Rangers eventually returned their powers before going back to their respective universes. However, the fact that a team with such beloved fan favorites came together at all, forming a dream team for longtime fans of the show who followed multiple seasons, was a major milestone in the comic series.





 7  Trini Takes Center Stage 
Dates Jason, Then Becomes A Red Ranger


 







Trini was always showcased as one of the more efficient members of the team on the show, proving to know as much about the team&#39;s communicators as Billy. The comics merely gave her a bigger spotlight, slowly moving her into more prominent positions. Trini&#39;s rise through the ranks really began during the Go Go Power Rangers series, during which she formed a romantic relationship with Jason. This would lead to the two swapping powers in issue #13. Trini temporarily became the Red Ranger for the next few issues, but would soon become a permanent Red Ranger within a couple years. When Jason retired from the Omega team, he appointed Trini as his Red Ranger replacement.





 6  Finster Becomes A Main Villain 
One Arc Gives Him A Spotlight Without Rita
        

Early in BOOM! Studios&#39; Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series, Rita Repulsa disappeared, and not even her henchmen knew of her whereabouts. With nothing but time on his hands, Finster used it wisely by practicing his monster crafting skills. He created monsters that could perfectly disguise themselves as humans, instilling memories in them to the point the monsters themselves didn&#39;t know they weren&#39;t human. When they transformed at random in the middle of cities, chaos ensued. Finster was previously merely a background character, used by Rita to create her monsters, but this arc proved just how dangerous he could be on his own, by giving the Rangers something they couldn&#39;t prepare for.





 5  Rita Repulsa Becomes Mistress Vile 
A Bigger Threat Than Ever Before
        

Later in Mighty Morphin&#39; Power Rangers, Rita would return from another unexpected hiatus, having been away slowly plotting out the Darkest Hour. After killing her father, Master Vile, she assumed the role of Mistress Vile, and with both new motivation and a power boost from Dark Specter, she became stronger than ever. In her first appearance back, she returned to the moon, wiping out both the Power Rangers and her former cohorts, including Zedd, before kidnapping the Green Ranger, Matt. She also successfully brought Dark Specter back into power. Not bad for a villain who the Rangers used to beat every week.





 4  Scorpina Fulfills HerPotential 
No Longer A Wasted Villain


 







Scorpina is often remembered as, hands down, the most underused character in franchise history. Despite being hyped as Rita Repulsa&#39;s most ruthless right-hand woman, she only appears in a handful of episodes, and even fewer where she&#39;s a focal point. She leaves an impression, but ultimately doesn&#39;t live up to her full potential until the comics. BOOM! Studios has frequently woven Scorpina into storylines, most prominently in one of the best fights of the series with Tommy Oliver. A feud with Lord Drakkon, an alliance with Kimberly Hart in the World of the Coinless, and even becoming a Power Ranger has morphed Scorpina into a redeemed anti-hero, and a much more prominent figure in the franchise.





 3  Bulk &amp; Skull Are No Longer A Joke 
They Become Rangers Ready To Save The World
        

Bulk and Skull were known to be frequent comic relief, but in the world of the Shattered Grid, the duo moved into far more serious roles. Bulk was one of the key leaders working alongside Zack, Trini, and Kimberly to free the world from Drakkon&#39;s control. Ironically enough, when the stakes become even higher during the Darkest Hour, Bulk assumed the role of Red Ranger on the Drakkon Rangers, designed to defeat Dark Specter. Skull, meanwhile, was undercover for the resistance as one of Drakkon&#39;s Red Ranger Sentries, once he took over the world. Drakkon killed him once his deception is revealed, but Bulk brought him back to life in time for the Darkest Hour.





 2  Dark Specter Becomes The Thanos Of The Rangers Universe 
Exactly the Big Bad The Franchise Needs
        

Dark Specter originally appeared during Power Rangers in Space as its main antagonist, but the comics have rebranded him as an even bigger threat than he was before. Now, he&#39;s materialized as the master puppeteer who has been pulling the strings of every major scheme since the franchise&#39;s very beginning. Even worse, his latest scheme brings him back among the living by having him return in Zordon&#39;s body. With the help of Mistress Vile, and his new vessel, Dark Specter has plunged the entire multiverse into its Darkest Hour for a plot that will loom over the Rangers for the next year, and beyond.





 1  Rebranding Tommy Oliver As Lord Drakkon 
Helped Revive The Franchise At A Pivotal Moment
        

The conception and creation of Lord Drakkon went a long way to pump new life into the Power Rangers franchise. The idea behind this form of Tommy Oliver is simple, asking what would&#39;ve happened if Rita Repulsa&#39;s Green Ranger was never redeemed. This was one significant move that made it easier for old fans to get back into the franchise. Fans were instantly enamored with Lord Drakkon and the character never lost their interest, considering he still plays an active role in the current BOOM! Studios ongoing storylines with his own Rangers. After the Power Rangers comic series put a whole new spin on everyone&#39;s favorite Ranger, Lord Drakkon has remained here to stay.
