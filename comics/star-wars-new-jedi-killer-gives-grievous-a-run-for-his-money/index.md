## Literature Review

The Nihil are evolving during the High Republic era, and their newest leader would make General Grevious jealous in this early Star Wars era.





Summary

  General Viess, a brutal military commander, returns in Star Wars: The High Republic to ally with the Nihil&#39;s leader Marchion Ro.   Viess betrays and hands over an entire world over to the Nihil, while also offering to turn them into a formidable military force.   Viess owns her own collection of lightsabers from Jedi she&#39;s slain, one that would likely make General Grievous jealous.   Viess becomes the Nihil&#39;s new Minister of Protection while also seeking revenge on her old rival Jedi Master Porter Engle.  







One of Star Wars&#39; newest High Republic villains has just given General Grievous a run for his money. As seen during the High Republic Era, General Viess was briefly featured in Star Wars: The High Republic- The Blade miniseries as a particularly brutal military commander. However, she&#39;s now made a surprising return in the aftermath of the Nihil marauders&#39; attack on Starlight Beacon, one that shows the full extent of her dark and murderous legacy.

Choosing to leave retirement, General Viess hopes to forge an alliance with the Nihil&#39;s leader Marchion Ro in the new Shadows of Starlight #4 from Charles Soule, David Messina, and Jethro Morales. To that end, Viess betrays and hands over a world that had been resisting the Nihil&#39;s galactic takeover within the &#34;Occlusion Zone&#34;, an entire region of Republic space the marauders have walled off for themselves using their Stormwall technology. Recognizing Ro&#39;s power and potential to win, Viess wishes to turn his marauders into a true military force. As such, Viess&#39; &#34;credentials&#34; would make the prequel trilogy&#39;s General Grevious quite jealous.




          

Having killed several Jedi throughout her career, Viess carries their lightsabers as trophies just like General Grievous does centuries later during the Clone Wars as he led the Separatists&#39; droid armies for Count Dooku. As such, it looks as though Grirvous&#39; role in the Star Wars timeline was a case of history repeating itself (as Star Wars canon often does).


 General Viess&#39; Star Wars History Explained 
From Jedi-Killer To Nihil General
          

Originally, General Viess led a force of mercenaries for hire decades before Starlight&#39;s fall as seen in The Blade. To that end, one conflict in particular brought her face to face with none other than the legendary Jedi warrior Porter Engle, also known as &#34;The Blade of Bardotta&#34;. Although Viess escaped Porter, the Jedi promised he&#39;d never forget her name. However, Porter would later become a humble cook as seen in more present chapters of the High Republic. Likewise, Viess herself has been retired for some time...until she heard about the Nihil.




As seen in this new issue, Viess has offered her services to help Marchion Ro maintain his new rule and sector of the galaxy in defiance of both the Republic and Jedi Order who&#39;ve since come to fear all that the Nihil are capable of. Sensing that Marchion has the potential to go all the way and emerge victorious, Viess has become the Nihil&#39;s new Minister of Protection, training and reforming the Nihil from a band of marauders into a legitimate military force. Likewise, she&#39;s also become a key asset given her experience hunting down and killing Jedi, many of whom became trapped within the Occlusion Zone after Starlight&#39;s Fall.



 Will General Viess Finally Get Revenge On Porter Engle? 
The Legendary Jedi Is Trapped In The Occlusion Zone
          

One such trapped Jedi just so happens to be Porter Engle himself which was confirmed both in this issue and in the High Republic novel Eye of Darkness (which also takes place in Starlight&#39;s aftermath). With Viess&#39; forces having already located Porter, it seems to be only a matter of time before the old rivals finally reunite for a rematch in the High Republic era. As such, it should be very exciting to see what happens when General Grievous&#39; spiritual predecessor finally gets her chance for revenge in Star Wars&#39; future.
