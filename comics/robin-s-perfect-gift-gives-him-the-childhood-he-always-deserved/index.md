## Literature Review

Batman and Robin are the most iconic duo in comic books, but recently Robin has gotten an even better mentor — and with him, a heartwarming gift.





Summary

  Damian Wayne, the son of Batman, never had a normal childhood due to growing up in the League of Assassins.   In Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #4, Santa Claus gives Damian the gift of a true childhood memory by letting him help deliver presents.   Damian&#39;s upbringing was filled with training and preparing him to conquer the world, making it a miracle that he even knows who Santa Claus is.  







All the Robins had fairly difficult childhoods, but the only one who wasn&#39;t ever allowed to be a true kid is Damian Wayne. Damian grew up in the League of Assassins, which wasn&#39;t the best place for a child to grow up — to put it lightly. But now Santa Claus has given Damian Wayne the best gift he could&#39;ve gotten: a precious childhood memory.

Damian Wayne spent most of his childhood under the thumbs of Talia and Ra&#39;s al Ghul, who were the leaders of the League of Assassins. Damian was meant to be the next Alexander the Great, someone who would conquer the entire world. Because of this, his childhood was mostly spent training and killing, and he never really had a normal childhood.

          

Whimsical things like Santa Claus just weren&#39;t something he ever had. But thankfully, that&#39;s remedied in Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #4 by Jeff Parker, Danny Kim, and Stephen Segovia. As a gift, Santa Claus gives Damian Wayne a true childhood memory by letting him help deliver presents on Christmas Eve.




                  Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 Is a Genuine Superhero Holiday Classic (Review)   Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 is jam-packed with festive fun, beautiful art, and an entertaining story sure to become a traditional read.   


 Santa Offers Robin the Chance to Deliver Christmas Presents 
          

All the Robins had difficult childhoods, with Dick Grayson losing his parents at a young age, Jason Todd having to survive on the streets, Tim Drake having tragedy strike later in his teen years, and Stephanie Brown growing up with a D-list criminal for a father. But those Robins did have childhoods at some point. Dick, for example, grew up in the circus with his parents, where he knew a loving community and learned to be a performer. Damian Wayne is the only one who didn&#39;t have a childhood from the very start, which is why Santa&#39;s gift is so perfect.




Damian&#39;s life in the League of Assassins revolved entirely around training and preparing him to conquer the world. This left its mark on Damian, with even the Krampus claiming Damian as a naughty child. Damian often feels guilty about the things he did during his childhood, even going on a year-long quest to make amends for all the harm he caused. While Damian&#39;s life has certainly gotten better since he began living with his father, there&#39;s no denying that his childhood with Talia wasn&#39;t exactly full of happy, cherished memories. It&#39;s honestly a miracle that Damian even knows who Santa Claus is considering his upbringing.



 Damian Wayne Finally Gets a Cherished Childhood Memory 
          

Christmas, with all its whimsical trappings, is one of the easiest ways to make good and long-lasting memories, but Damian Wayne never got that, and not just because of religious beliefs. Damian&#39;s childhood was filled with death and training, so he could eventually rule the world. Ra&#39;s al Ghul and Talia al Ghul weren&#39;t waiting by the Christmas tree to give young Damian Wayne any gifts. He only got to train and improve, year after year, until he was worthy of meeting his father. Once he did, his life improved, but his formative years as a child were behind him. It&#39;s only now that Santa Claus has given Robin the greatest gift of a true childhood memory.
