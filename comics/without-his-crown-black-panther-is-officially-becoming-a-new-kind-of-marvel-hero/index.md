## Literature Review

After giving up the Wakandan throne, Marvel&#39;s Black Panther is finally on the right path to becoming the street-level hero he&#39;s destined to be. 




Warning: Spoilers for Black Panther #7!He&#39;s protected a fabled kingdom, and even been to space, but Black Panther is finally on course to properly save the streets of Birnin T&#39;Chaka. After being exiled from Wakanda, T&#39;Challa moved to a city called Birnin T&#39;Chaka. Even without his crown, T&#39;Challa doesn&#39;t stop being a superhero, as he officially becomes the Marvel equivalent of Batman.




Black Panther #7 – by Eve L. Ewing, Mack Chater, Chris Allen, Craig Yeung, Jesus Aburtov, and Joe Sabino – finds T&#39;Challa struggling to properly transition into fighting street-level justice. In the issue, he learns a valuable lesson, which comes when T&#39;Challa is at a crossroads, questioning if he&#39;s taking the right approach to street justice, trying to figure out how he could do better.



          

With some helpful guidance from a new friend and confidante that he&#39;s made during this series, lawyer N&#39;Yobi Umaru, Black Panther learns the secret to being a true street-level hero. N&#39;Yobi tells him that far more than just stalking the city at night, he must embrace the city during the day.


 Black Panther Must Indulge In His City Before He Can Protect It 


          




Since the start of this new Black Panther series, the hero has been investigating a a gang war happening across the city of Birnin T&#39;Chaka, with the elusive mob boss Baba Nkisuat at the center of it all. However, in a shocking twist, Nkisu is killed after summoning the dark spirit of Kivu&#39;ma. Despite the head of the Nkisu crime family being laid to rest, T&#39;Challa considers himself a failure for not being able to deliver him into the justice system – nor does he fully understand the circumstances behind his murder. He starts to ponder out loud if he is taking the right approach to combating street-level crime.

That is when N&#39;Yobi suddenly starts asking T&#39;Challa what his favorite bookstore in the city is, or his favorite chip spot, etc. When T&#39;Challa can&#39;t answer any of these questions after living in Birnin T&#39;Chaka for weeks, N&#39;Yobi explains that he can&#39;t just reign over the city 24/7 as the Panther. He needs to observe, learn, and understand the city better before he can actually come close to protecting it. Under his undercover persona of Ize Mbaya, a dishwasher, he starts embarking on the luxuries the city has to offer in order to truly understand it, and become its proper protector.






 Black Panther Learns The Key To Street-Level Heroism 
          

When readers think about the idea of street-level heroism, N&#39;Yobi&#39;s assertion makes perfect sense. Peter Parker and Bruce Wayne have both been seen using their spare time to enjoy the lavish things of their respective cities. It&#39;s why Batman and Spider-Man are among the best street-level heroes in comics history. T&#39;Challa, for all of his experience in heroism, is more out of his element when it comes to facing street crime, and he just suffered his most significant setback since moving to Birnin T&#39;Chaka by failing to navigate the city. Now that he&#39;s learned his lesson, Black Panther will come back better than ever in his pursuit of street justice.
