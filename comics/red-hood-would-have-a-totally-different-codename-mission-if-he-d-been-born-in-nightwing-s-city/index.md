# Red Hood Would Have a Totally Different Codename &amp; Mission If He d Been Born in Nightwing s City


## SUMMARY 



  Jason Todd&#39;s life could&#39;ve been completely different if he had grown up in Bludhaven instead of Gotham City.   Bea became Captain Blud by stealing a superyacht and impressing the previous captain; rather than become an oprhan on the streets of Gotham, growing up in Bludhaven could have set Jason on a different path, potentially leading to a life as a pirate king.   Nightwing recognizes the similarities between Jason and Bea, and acknowledges that Jason could&#39;ve had a stable family and a sense of community if he had grown up in Bludhaven.

## Literature Review

A recent issue of Nightwing delved into how the character Bea became Bludhaven, with her backstory reminding Dick Grayson of Jason Todd.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Nightwing #109!DC just admitted that if Red Hood had been born in Nightwing&#39;s city of Bludhaven instead of Gotham City, his life would&#39;ve been different in a major way. Even if he had been destined for a life of adventure, instead of a brutal vigilante, Jason Todd could&#39;ve been a pirate king.




Nightwing #109 – by Tom Taylor, Stephen Byrne, Adriano Lucas, and Wes Abbott – revealed the surprising detail that could&#39;ve made all the difference in young Jason Todd&#39;s life.



          

This issue recounts how Bea Bennet became Captain Blud; when Bea was a young girl, she ended up stealing a superyacht and taking it out to sail. She was eventually stopped and captured by the man who&#39;d adopt her and later passed on his role as Captain Blud to her. Upon hearing the story, Nightwing remarks how it reminds him of Jason Todd, and if Jason had grown up in Bludhaven instead of Gotham, this might very well have been something he&#39;d do.

                  “Welcome to the Hill”: Red Hood Returns to His Old Neighborhood in New Solo Series   Red Hood has bounced all over the DC Universe as both a hero and a villain, and now he&#39;s finally getting his own slice of Gotham in a new solo series.   





 Jason Todd Could Have Been Captain Blud In Another Life 


          

Jason Todd had one of the more difficult lives of all the Robins. While characters like Dick Grayson came to live with Bruce Wayne because of the murder of their own parents, Jason&#39;s situation was a bit more complicated. Jason never really had any parents to speak of. He was abandoned by his biological mother early on, his father ended up in prison, and his stepmother was addicted to drugs and unable to care for him. Jason was alone almost from the very start. It was his fateful attempt to steal the tires off the Batmobile that changed his life – for better or worse.

However, as Nightwing #109 theorizes, if Jason had lived just one city over, everything would&#39;ve been different. Bea Bennet got the attention of Captain Blud by stealing a superyacht when she was just 14 years old. Jason Todd wasn&#39;t much older when he tried to steal the tires off the Batmobile, and with Jason&#39;s firey personality and desire to go on adventures, it&#39;s not absurd to think he&#39;d steal a superyacht given the chance. If Jason had grown up in Bludhaven, it&#39;s possible he could&#39;ve become Captain Blud, which would&#39;ve completely changed his life and the trajectory of the DC Universe.






 Dick Admits Bea Reminds Him Of Jason Todd 


          

Jason Todd from Bludhaven never would&#39;ve become Red Hood, never would&#39;ve met the Joker, and would&#39;ve had a stable family. Bea Bennett seems to love her crew members and Jason could&#39;ve used that same sense of community. Jason&#39;s life was irreversibly changed when he became Batman&#39;s Robin. If Red Hood had been born in Bludhaven instead of Gotham City, literally just one city over, everything would&#39;ve changed. Instead of being the black sheep of the Bat-Family who often spends all his time alone, Red Hood could&#39;ve been sailing the high seas with a community behind him to support him as the infamous Captain Blud, and Nightwing knows it.
