# 1 Subtle Detail Reveals How Spider-Man Inspired His Greatest Enemy


## SUMMARY 



  Norman Osborn, known as the Green Goblin, now tries to be a hero and draws inspiration from his former nemesis, Spider-Man.   In Red Goblin #4, Osborn&#39;s use of Spider-Man&#39;s iconic hand gesture reveals his admiration for the web-slinger, and more critically, his former enemy&#39;s influence on his attempts at heroism.   Osborn&#39;s familiarity with Spider-Man&#39;s motions and their long history of battling each other makes it natural for him to recognize and emulate Spider-Man&#39;s gestures now that he is striving to be a Marvel hero.

## Literature Review

Green Goblin is best known as Spider-Man&#39;s greatest foe, but as Red Goblin #4 revealed, the reformed Norman Osborn sees Spidey as his role model.




There are few rivalries in comic books that have been as long-lasting or as intense as Spider-Man and the Green Goblin – but now that Norman Osborn is trying to be a hero, it seems that Spidey is his biggest role model. During a major fight against the symbiote Rascal, one subtle movement reveals how Spider-Man inspires Norman.




Red Goblin #4 – by Alex Paknadel, Jan Bazaldua, David Curiel, and Joe Caramagna – contains a small, but significant detail that makes it clear who Norman Osborn takes his heroic inspiration from. When Norman Osborn is attacked by the symbiote Rascal, a simple hand gesture emphasizes the importance of his former nemesis Spidey to the reformed villain&#39;s attempts at heroism.



          

Pushed out of a building and falling to his certain death, Norman makes the iconic hand gesture recognizable as how Spider-Man deploys his signature webbing, though Norman uses it to summon his golden glider, in order to stop his fall.

                  Norman Osborn&#39;s Gold Goblin Officially Joins Spider-Man As A Hero   Marvel Comics has officially revealed Norman Osborn as the Gold Goblin, as the longtime Spider-Man foe becomes a hero to save the web-slinger&#39;s life.   





 Norman Use Signature Spider-Man Move To Summon His Golden Glider 


          

Whenever Spider-Man uses his webs, he has the iconic hand motion, consisting of pushing his middle finger and his ring finger against the palm of his hand. The reason he does this is because of the web-shooters he has that have a large pressure plate on his palm. This pressure plate requires super strength to activate, which prevents him from doing it by mistake. This iconic motion is used by Spider-Man likely hundreds of times a day when he goes out to fight crime, and it&#39;s a motion that someone like Norman Osborn would be very familiar with. Spider-Man and Green Goblin have been fighting for decades, it&#39;s unavoidable Norman would recognize this motion.

Norman has likely spent more time fighting Spider-Man than just about any other villain in the Marvel universe. Green Goblin has been one of Spider-Man&#39;s biggest rivals, and is involved in some of his most iconic moments, such as the death of Gwen Stacy. If there&#39;s any villain on the planet who&#39;d have recognized Spider-Man&#39;s motions during his heroics, it&#39;d be Norman Osborn. Now that Norman is trying to turn over a new leaf and become a hero, it&#39;s likely that he&#39;s taking his inspiration from Spider-Man. Not wanting to be the monster he was in the past, Norman is now using the very motion that was once used to bring him down.






 Norman Osborn Battles The Rascal Symbiote 


          

Plenty of former villains have gone on to try and make amends and become heroes. Norman Osborn is one of the worst villains to have ever been in comics. Both his regular persona and his Green Goblin persona hurt a lot of people. Norman Osborn still isn&#39;t a very good person, but because of the influence of Spider-Man, and a few other events in his life, while he might not be a good person, he is trying to be a good hero. While he might falter and even fail at times, this former Green Goblin is using his old rival as a reminder of how to be a hero.



Red Goblin #4 was released in May 2023. It is available now from Marvel Comics.
