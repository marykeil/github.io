# The Boys  Subtlest Comic Reference Exposes Compound V s Surprising Inspiration


## SUMMARY 



  Compound V in The Boys is seemingly inspired by Asterix the Gaul, a French comic from the &#39;60s, where a character gains superhuman strength from a potion.   The origin story of The Boys&#39; Female mirrors that of Asterix, with her accidentally consuming a synthetic version of Compound V.   The connection is further solidified by the fact that the scientist who created the synthetic Compound V shares a name with the co-creator of Asterix, Albert Uderzo.

## Literature Review

With 1 subtle reference buried within the origin story of the Boys&#39; most brutal member, the true inspiration behind Compound V is seemingly revealed. 




Within The Boys canon, Compound V is the substance that gives regular humans superpowers, with the most common being super strength and near invulnerability (something that can even be achieved temporarily with the right cocktail). Given the fact that The Boys is a pretty consistent parody of Marvel and DC, one would assume that Compound V was more or less a parody of Marvel’s super soldier serum or DC’s venom. However, it seems as though Compound V was actually inspired by a much more obscure comic, and one subtle reference confirms it.




This ‘inspiration-in-question’ is presumably Asterix the Gaul, a French comic published in the ‘60s. It followed the adventures of Asterix in the year 50 BC. As a baby, Asterix fell into a potion that grants him superhuman strength, a power he exhibited for the rest of his life (so long as he regularly consumed doses of the potion, anyway).

         

In fact, it was because of his super strength that a Centurion spy infiltrates Gaul to uncover the secret of Asterix’s powers. This Centurion wanted to overthrow Julius Caesar, and he needed Asterix’s powers to do that, and he would soon learn that the answers he sought were to be found in this mystical strength potion.


 The Female From The Boys Has The Same Origin As Asterix The Gaul 
          




In The Boys #38 by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, readers are told the full backstory of The Boys&#39; Female (aka Kimiko from the live-action series, who remains unnamed in the comics). When she was a baby, her mother brought her to her office job that was just down the hall from a scientific research laboratory dedicated to making a perfect synthetic copy of Compound V in an effort to compete with Vought-American.

The Female’s mother wasn’t paying attention to her, so she crawled into the lab and climbed into a bucket filled with the residuals of this experimental substance - and consumed all of it. From that point forward, the Female was a supe, boasting super strength and a healing factor, at which point she was recruited by Butcher and the Boys, as he wanted to use her strength to take down Vought and their champion supe, Homelander.



 The Boys’ Female Is A Reflection Of Asterix The Gaul (&amp; That’s Not The Only Connection) 
          




The Female has virtually the same origin as Asterix the Gaul, with Compound V (or the exact-copy substitute) being a stand-in for Asterix’s strength potion. And her recruitment by Butcher and the Boys mirrors the Centurion’s efforts to use Asterix’s powers to overthrow Caesar. But there’s also another connection that gives this theory a bit stronger legs to stand on than parallel plot points that could have otherwise been argued as total coincidences: the name of the scientist who created the synthetic Compound V, Dr. Uderzo. This scientist shares a name with the co-creator of Asterix the Gaul, Albert Uderzo.

This is a subtle reference, to be sure, but one that gives credibility to the idea that Asterix the Gaul inspired The Boys’ Compound V. The similarities in the origin story of Asterix and the Female are a bit too close for coincidence, as are the narrative parallels between Butcher and the Centurion. But the thing that puts it over the top is the name of The Boys’ scientist being the same as the co-creator of Asterix the Gaul, as that cements the reference, and all but confirms this surprising inspiration for Compound V.
