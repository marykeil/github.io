## Literature Review

Green Arrow’s team gets bigger as some of his closest associates return. But have they turned against him and allied themselves with Amanda Waller?




The next family reunion for Green Arrow may just be his deadliest. Oliver Queen fought like hell to reunite with his family and he&#39;s getting exactly what he wanted. Several long-absent heroes finally make their return to Team Arrow, but only to surprise the Emerald Archer with an unexpected betrayal.




2024 is finally here and fans are already getting a peek at what lies ahead in the DC Universe thanks to the latest batch of solicitations. It&#39;s going to be an exciting month as the all-ape Jungle League debuts. But Green Arrow has much more tense developments in his corner of the world. Green Arrow #10 sees a few unexpected faces finally join the title. Red Arrow, Arrowette, Speedy, and Red Canary finally make their first appearance in the series. But according to the solicited text, they&#39;re all serving as &#34;agents of Waller&#34;. Sean Izaakse&#39;s cover shows the heroes looming over Oliver Queen and his son Connor Hawke after they&#39;ve suffered a serious attack.



          



  Green Arrow #10   Release Date: 3/26/24   Writer: Joshua Williamson   Artist: Sean Izaakse   Cover Artist: Sean Izaakse   Variant Cover Artist: Jorge Fornes   Roy Harper is missing. Green Arrow and Connor Hawke investigate what happened to him and what Amanda Waller has done to the rest of the Arrow family…which makes it difficult when they are attacked by surprise agents of Waller! Red Arrow, Red Canary, Arrowette, and Speedy!  





 Green Arrow is About to Be Betrayed by His Allies 
          

Green Arrow has been on an epic adventure across time and space. After being manipulated by his old rival Merlyn, Oliver did his best to keep his distance from his family, believing it would help avoid a disaster of epic proportions. However, Green Arrow realized he&#39;d been tricked and finally made his way back to his home. But upon returning to his proper time, Oliver discovered just how much had changed since he&#39;d been gone. Not only was the Justice League officially disbanded and replaced by the Titans, but his ally Roy Harper had gone missing, taken hostage by Amanda Waller.

One of the best parts of the current Green Arrow run is seeing Team Arrow united for the first time in years. However, the book has noticeably been missing certain allies, namely the four women pictures on Izaakse&#39;s cover for Green Arrow #10. But the question remains, why are some of Oliver&#39;s closest companions like Red Arrow or Speedy working for Amanda Waller? The solicitation for the previous issue implies that Queen may be making a side deal with Waller to go against DC&#39;s heroes. Does the reappearance of these heroes mean Waller is double-crossing Oliver? And will Green Arrow be able to stop whatever Waller&#39;s done to them?






 Will Waller Shatter Green Arrow&#39;s Family Permanently? 
          

For whatever reason, Waller is dead-set on keeping Green Arrow&#39;s family apart. Nothing plays into her plans more than taking heroes who have worked alongside Oliver and Team Arrow and turning them against each other. Whether they&#39;re brainwashed or under some other form of coercion, Oliver has come too far to let his family be destroyed. Green Arrow has already made his way back after being stranded in time and space, so helping his allies break free from Amanda Waller&#39;s control should be a piece of cake.

Green Arrow #10 is available from DC Comics on March 26th.
