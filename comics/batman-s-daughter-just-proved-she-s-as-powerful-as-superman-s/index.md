## Literature Review

Batman and Superman have had one of the greatest friendships in comic book history, but their daughters don&#39;t seem to get along nearly as well.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Action Comics #1060!




Batman and Superman are likely the greatest friends in comic books, Despite this, it appears not all of their children get along. While Jon Kent and Damian Wayne are close friends, it seems Otho-Ra and Janan al Ghul are going to be bitter enemies, which is all the more concerning since Janan has demonstrated the power to bring Otho-Ra down.

Action Comics #1060 contains a pivotal interaction between the two second-generation heroes. Recently, Superman and the Super-Family have been dealing with the Blue Earth movement, which wants to turn Earth against Kryptonians. As Superman struggles to maintain his public image and figure out who&#39;s responsible, he comes to the shocking realization that it&#39;s Batman&#39;s daughter from another planet.



          

Before he can act on this information though, Janan kidnaps Otho-Ra, seeking to turn Otho-Ra to her side. While Otho isn&#39;t easily swayed, she lashes out at Janan with her powers, which Janan surprisingly deflects, before disabling Otho-Ra with her powers. This reveals the surprising extent of what Janan also known as Sister Shadow, can do.





 Janan Reveals Herself As Sister Shadow 


          





Action Comics #1060 is written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, and features a number of talented artists, including Eddy Barrows, Fico Ossio, Eber Ferreira, Joe Prado, Jonas Trindade, Matt Herms, Christopher Sotomayor, and Dave Sharpe.




On one of the many planets in the Dark Multiverse, Batman decides to take the role of Ra&#39;s al Ghul, leading the League of Shadows to become the Empire of Shadows. Bruce and his Empire conquer not just his Earth, but countless other Earths in the Dark Multiverse. It&#39;s only when the Empire of Shadows turns its eye to the Positive Multiverse that the Empire is dealt its first real defeat. Superman and the Authority manage to prevent the Empire of Shadows from invading, also destroying their means to travel between worlds. This greatly weakens the Empire, and Bruce&#39;s daughter Janan al Ghul swore revenge, especially after the rebellion Superman inspired killed most of her family.




Batman&#39;s daughter makes a good nemesis for Superman and his family for many reasons. One of the age-old comic fan arguments is whether Batman could defeat Superman, and now Janan al-Ghul and Otho-Ra are here to take that argument to the next level. After Superman destroyed the primary way to travel between worlds that the Empire was using, Janan found another option. She manages to travel through Hell itself to reach other worlds, eventually making her way to Earth 0. This shows that Janan has a great deal of mastery over magic to be able to travel through Hell freely. This mastery over magic returns when she easily seems to overpower Otho-Ra despite Otho having Kryptonian-level strength.



 Sister Shadow And Otho-Ra Could Be DC&#39;s Next Heavyweights 


          

Superman and his family have fought dozens of threats over the years, including evil versions of Batman. Janan is something different; she grew up under an evil version of Batman and seems to have learned everything he knows. She has already fought and killed countless Gods, as she states herself in Action Comics #160. Going up against Kryptonians is usually a very dangerous proposition, but Janan has so far been able to manipulate and out-think the Super-Family at every step. While her goal is to turn Otho-Ra to her side, failing that, it seems Batman&#39;s daughter will have no problem destroying her, as well as Superman and the rest of his family.
