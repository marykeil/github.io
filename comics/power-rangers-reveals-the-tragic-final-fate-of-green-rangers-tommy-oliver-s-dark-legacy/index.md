# Power Rangers Reveals the Tragic Final Fate of Green Rangers (Tommy Oliver s Dark Legacy)


## SUMMARY 



  Green Rangers have become extinct in the future depicted in Ranger Academy, potentially due to the lasting stigma of the dark origins of the first Green Ranger, Tommy Oliver.   Students and teachers at Ranger Academy speak about Red, Blue, and Pink Rangers, but Green and Orange Rangers are treated as if they never existed.   The legacy of Tommy as a Green Ranger may be lost and forgotten over time, and the future of a new Green Power Ranger, Sage, could be put at risk due to the fear and distrust surrounding the role.

## Literature Review

Ranger Academy depicts Rangers-in-training in the the 26th century; as the latest issue revealed, the legacy of Green Rangers has not endured.




Warning: Spoilers for Ranger Academy #4!The final fate of Tommy Oliver and the legacy of Green Power Rangers is revealed in the distant future of Ranger Academy. Tommy is often viewed as the franchise&#39;s ultimate hero, with his legacy beginning during his time as a Green Ranger on the original 1990s Mighty Morphin squad. Unfortunately, it looks like Green Rangers have become extinct in the future of Rangerhood.




Ranger Academy #4 – by Maria Ingrande Mora, Jo Mi-Gyeong, Fabiana Mascolo, and Ed Dukeshire – reveals the scarcity of Green Rangers several centuries in the future. The series follows a school for a school for Rangers-in-training, founded by Zordon, where future Rangers work toward eventually earning their own colors – but those colors won&#39;t be green, or even orange.

          

Up until this point, students and teachers have spoken glowingly about Red Rangers, Blue Rangers, and Pink Rangers, but in this issue, students speak of Green and Orange as if they never existed. In fact, it&#39;s suggested that certain colors like Green may be cursed, potentially tying into Tommy&#39;s dark origins in receiving his Green Ranger powers.


 Green Rangers Have Faded From History In The Future Of &#34;Ranger Academy&#34; 
          




This issue concerns the central students of the Ranger Academy cast embarking on their first trial, the planet Chromia. The students must reach Prism Peak before the Zeo Chamber closes for another year, simultaneously delaying their graduation to Rangerhood for one more term. The goal after completing the Morphin Trial is for the students to receive their Spectracite, which connects them to the Morphin Grid, and allows them to morph. During their journey, Theo thinks now is the right time to tell a ghost story of sorts, suggesting that there are secret Ranger colors that teachers won&#39;t tell their students about, because they&#39;re &#34;cursed.&#34;

Lindy balks at the insinuation, telling Theo, &#34;Just because people say there used to be Green or Orange Power Rangers or whatever doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true.&#34; Perhaps what is most interesting about the idea that students had never heard of Green Rangers is that Sage is teased in Rangers Academy #4 to become a Green Ranger herself, once she taps into the Green Spectrum of the Morphin Grid. However, she doesn&#39;t tell anyone she&#39;s able to morph, because she doesn&#39;t want her friend to feel bad, after Lindy reveals she wasn&#39;t able to morph herself. Thus, the narrative that Green Rangers don&#39;t exist continues.






 Rita Repulsa Cursed Green Rangers Forever 


          

Orange Rangers are so rare in the franchise that it&#39;s hard to understand why they might be cursed, but with Green Rangers, the franchise&#39;s first Green Ranger was created by Rita Repulsa. Instead of being directly tied to the Morphin Grid, Tommy got his powers from Rita&#39;s chaos magic. Along with the circumstances of his powers, the fact that the first Green Ranger was originally evil may make teachers think twice before talking about Green. Not talking about Green Rangers also suggests that Tommy&#39;s contributions as one of the Power Rangers - especially a Green Ranger - may be completely lost and forgotten over time.

At the same time, this could create a whole new slew of problems for Sage, now that she&#39;s destined to be the next Green Power Ranger. If the evil origins of the first Green Ranger come to light, and her friends find out that she lied about morphing in the Sanctuary of the Bandorian Monks, they could grow to distrust her. Or worse, if teachers are so fearful of repeating history with another evil Green Ranger, Sage&#39;s time at Ranger Academy may be put in jeopardy. As Ranger Academy #4 shows, both Tommy&#39;s legacy as a Green Ranger and Sage&#39;s future as one of the Power Rangers have been compromised.
