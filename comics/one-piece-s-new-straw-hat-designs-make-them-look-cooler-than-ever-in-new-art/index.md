## Literature Review

One Piece fans are already getting inspiration from the new art style and outfits that will be featured in the upcoming Egghead Arc in the anime.




New One Piece fan art shows the Straw Hat Pirates in their newest outfits for the Egghead Arc. With the Wano Country Arc ending after four years, the anime is all set to catch up with the manga&#39;s current storyline, which is also the first in the Final Saga. The anime has already shown a teaser of the new art style it will adopt, and fans are already inspired by it.




The artwork was shared on X by @_noK__1 and shows the infamous Straw Hat crew in their latest character designs as they march forward with smiles on their faces.


 

Since joining X in 2022, the account has continued to post incredible One Piece art and has amassed over twenty thousand followers on the site. It&#39;s not hard to see why, since the art does an excellent job of staying true to creator Eiichiro Oda&#39;s designs while also incorporating a unique style into the mix. Based on the number of posts featuring Zoro, it&#39;s evident the green-haired swordsman is a favorite subject of the artist.

After the events of Wano, the Straw Hats resume their journey, arriving at a winter island where they find Jewelry Bonney in her child form. They are greeted with the sight of aliens and robots and two of Dr. Vegapunk&#39;s satellites, who take them to his laboratory on the island. The crew learns that the technology on the island is based on the past, and that the Void Century is most likely a result of a war between the Great Kingdom and the 20 nations which would later become the World Government.

As the latest story arc in the long-running series, the Egghead Arc brings with it many stunning revelations about the world&#39;s past. The Straw Hats&#39; designs reflect the island&#39;s futuristic nature and contain some cyberpunk elements like colorful headphones and mechanical boots. While the arc is among the darkest to date, the art by @_noK__1 uses brighter colors and highlights that show One Piece&#39;s legacy of adventure. The picture shows Luffy, in his signature color, smiling in excitement while the rest of his crew members continue walking. Only Sanji is sidetracked as he watches Nami with hearts in his eyes.






 The Egghead Arc Will Use A Different Art Style From Wano 

 

At the same time, the teaser for the first episode of the Egghead arc of One Piece anime shows that the production has changed the art and animation style compared to Wano. This will contribute to giving each arc a unique style and feel, something that only One Piece can afford to do. Eiichiro Oda&#39;s announcement about One Piece&#39;s final saga is bittersweet for fans, as they get ready to see Luffy achieve his dream of becoming the Pirate King. However, the story is long from over, as the current arc has only just begun to unravel many of the series&#39; biggest mysteries. The artwork posted by @_noK__1 commemorates the upcoming adaptation of the Egghead Arc and pays tribute to the Straw Hat Pirates&#39;s new cool outfits and style.
