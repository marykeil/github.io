## Literature Review

A superhero&#39;s mission statement should always be to help people — never to hurt. As such, Superman wants his costume to serve that ideology.





Summary

  Superman believes superhero costumes should be made to help people, not hurt them.   Superman demands modifications to an armored suit made by Lex Luthor to ensure it protects, not harms.   Every superhero should strive to be a protector and healer, not stoop to the level of villains.  







Every superhero costume should have one specific feature in mind — at least according to Superman. The Man of Steel has had a wide assortment of costumes in the past, and each of his suits serves a specific and timely story purpose. But in each story, Superman wears his unique costumes with one specific mission statement in mind.

After using an updated suit made by the offense-minded Lex Luthor, the Last Son of Krypton makes it clear that all superhero costumes should be made to help people — not hurt them — in Superman #9 by Joshua Williamson and Bruno Redondo.

          

More recently, Superman has formed a reluctant alliance with Lex Luthor as he protects the imprisoned megalomaniac from his old enemies within the Secret Order of Mad Scientists. To protect his latest Kryptonian investment, Luthor has a suit of armor made specifically for Superman, but Superman demands an update — one that he likely thinks should be incorporated in the ideal super-suit of any hero.




                  Heartwarming New Superman Lore Confirms What Fans Have Always Known   A new piece of Superman&#39;s backstory reveals that Clark Kent has always been kind and giving, even in a moment when it&#39;s okay to be a little selfish.   


 Superman Believes a Superhero&#39;s Suit Should Never Be Used to Hurt Others 
          

In the previous issue of Superman, an encounter with a Doomsday-level threat known as the Chained leaves the Man of Steel severely wounded. As Superman recovers from his battle wounds, he learns that the mad scientists Dr. Pharm and Mister Graft are about to strike their next target: the ghostly Marilyn Moonlight. Due to Kryptonite poisoning, Superman is still not strong enough to push himself into a fight alone, but of course he insists on it. As such, Luthor&#39;s assistant Mercy Graves offers Superman a suit of armor made by Luthor specifically for Superman. Clark accepts, but won&#39;t put it on without the proper modifications being enforced first.




Superman leaps into the battle, and in the thick of it, Lex Luthor tells Superman over an intercom speaker to activate the E.M.P. built into the suit. Luthor says the shock will &#34;shut him down.&#34; It&#39;s not clear if he means to shut Graft&#39;s suit down or actually shut the man down — to a permanent end — but Superman says removing the E.M.P. is one of the updates he insisted on. &#34;This suit should protect me. Not hurt others.&#34; Luthor thinks the decision is &#34;shameful,&#34; basically turning the &#34;tank&#34; that he built into an &#34;ambulance.&#34; Luthor thinks a conversation between the two of them on matters like this is overdue, emphasizing the differences in their ideologies.



 Superman&#39;s Iconic Costume Serves His Protective Ideology 
          

At their core, every superhero exists to be a protector and a healer. Fighting villains comes with the territory, but a hero doesn&#39;t need to stoop down to a villain&#39;s level to horribly harm — or worse, kill — their adversaries. Superman approaches a battle like this with such a viewpoint, and he likely holds his peers within the superhero community to the same standard. Some may say that the standard that he holds other heroes to may be unrealistic, too high, or maybe even arrogant. But by maintaining a concrete rule like — even when it&#39;s about something as seemingly decorative as a costume — Superman inhabits the role of protector that every hero should hope to be.
