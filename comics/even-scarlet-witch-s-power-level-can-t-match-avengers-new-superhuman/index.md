## Literature Review

Scarlet Witch is one of the most powerful magic users in the Marvel Universe, but she may have met an unexpected match with the newest superhero team.





Summary

  Scarlet Witch faces a new group, the Twilight Court, and is at a disadvantage in Avengers #8.   Mordred, the Witch from the Twilight Court, can unravel Scarlet Witch&#39;s magic despite her power.   Scarlet Witch could overpower Mordred if she figures out how her powers are being unraveled.  







Although Scarlet Witch is a magical powerhouse, a preview for Avengers #8 reveals she&#39;s still at a disadvantage. The upcoming issue features a face-off against Marvel&#39;s new superhero group, the Twilight Court. The latest Tribulation Event the Avengers are facing could prove more troublesome than their usual foes, thanks in part to the Court&#39;s own witch.

The Twilight Court debuted in December 2022, within Timeless #1, which has the creative team of Jed MacKay, Greg Land, Patrick Zircher, Salvador Larroca, Jay Leisten, Frank D&#39;Armata, and Ariana Maher. Members of this supposed hero team include Artur the King, Bedivere the Engineer, Bercilak the Construct, Galehaut the God, Lancelot the Star, Mordred the Witch, and Parsifal the Icon.

          

Each member of the Twilight Court was created by Myrrdin, who faced Kang while trying to attain the Missing Moment. Now, the Avengers will be facing off against this new group and their leader in an effort to save Kang from being executed.





 Scarlet Witch vs. Mordred is Marvel&#39;s Latest Magic Throwdown 
         

Scarlet Witch is generally known for being a magical powerhouse. She is among the most powerful magic users in the Marvel universe. It is certainly arguable that she is more powerful than Doctor Strange and other Marvel sorcerers and witches. However, Avengers #8 could have her bested by Mordred, the Witch, based on the latest preview. As the Twilight Court demands Kang, Scarlet Witch prepares her powers to deliver an onslaught. Yet she is quickly thwarted by Mordred&#39;s abilities. While Vision is able to interfere, the two of them may not be enough to manage all seven members of the Court at one time.

Mordred readily concedes that Scarlet Witch&#39;s &#34;power far outstrips&#34; hers but clarifies that she has the ability to &#34;unravel your mighty magics, as I can anything else. It is what I was engineered for.&#34; Vision is prepared to assist Scarlet Witch and help with her plan to buy time, but being able to affect Wanda&#39;s magic so readily is nothing to scoff at. The Twilight Court hasn&#39;t been around long, as this is only the team&#39;s third appearance in Marvel Comics following their debut and the previous issue of this series. This means that their broader potential and power levels are not currently known.






 Scarlet Witch Can Overpower Mordred, But Only If Her Powers Will Work 
          

Wanda Maximoff has a high chance of getting the upper hand on Mordred, if she can figure out how the unraveling is happening. Tackling this battle strategically to maximize her and Vision&#39;s power will likely be what grants the pair victory. With so much on the line involving Kang, however, there&#39;s a good chance this battle could stretch on a bit longer yet. Wanda has gone up against other magic users before and tends to come out on top. If she can crack Mordred&#39;s abilities or incapacitate the witch, there&#39;s a good chance Scarlet Witch will win out on sheer power given the chance to hit her necessary potential in this conflict.

Avengers #8 will be available December 6 from Marvel Comics.
