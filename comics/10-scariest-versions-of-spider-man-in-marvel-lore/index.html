  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Traditionally known as Marvel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,&rdquo; over the years the Multiverse has allowed for versions of Spider-Man that are not just less-than-friendly, but are in fact terrifying.
From Ghost-Spider, to Man-Spider, to Spiders-Man, there are some truly wild version of the Webslinger scattered throughout Marvel&rsquo;s Multiverse.
While even some of the scarier Spider-Men remain heroic, some have become villains, turning away from the values instilled in Earth-616 Peter Parker early in his superhero career.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Spider-Man-Horror-Scary-Header.jpg" alt="iamge" srcset="https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Spider-Man-Horror-Scary-Header.jpg?size=small, https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Spider-Man-Horror-Scary-Header.jpg?size=medium 1.5x, https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Spider-Man-Horror-Scary-Header.jpg?size=large 2x" sizes="auto" data-title="iamge" style="background: url(/images/loading.min.svg) no-repeat center;" onload="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}this.dataset.lazyloaded='';" onerror="this.title=this.dataset.title;for(const i of ['style', 'data-title','onerror','onload']){this.removeAttribute(i);}"/></p>
<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Spider-Man has tried to build his reputation as being the archetypal friendly neighborhood hero, but not all versions of him are so friendly.</p>
<p>There are plenty of dark heroes in comic books – those who, despite being protagonists rely on fear to enable them to take down criminals;
Marvel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&rdquo; has tried his best never to be one of those characters. While the public might be a little scared of Spider-Man, he has tried to present himself as a community-forward hero.
That said, not all versions of Spider-Man from throughout the multiverse are always so friendly. The Marvel Multiverse features countless variations between all heroes across a vast tapestry of alternate universes. Some are just as heroic as others, some are outright villains, and some are legitimately terrifying. Considering how popular Spider-Man is, he&rsquo;s seen the most variations out of any other hero and there have been plenty of terrifying versions of the Webslinger, from sadistic serial killer to zombie cannibal. These are the Top 10 most horrifying versions of the friendly Spider-Man in the multiverse – at least, so far.</p>
<p>10  Pestilence Parker
Spider-Man Is One Of Apocalypse&rsquo;s Four Horsemen</p>
<p>One of the major things that longtime villain Apocalypse loves to do is find worthy heroes and transform them into his Horsemen of Apocalypse. This has resulted in characters like Archangel and Wolverine famously being used as villains while under Apocalypse&rsquo;s control, in the process becoming far more brutal than normal. This habit seems to be a multiversal constant, as when Cable and Deadpool were exploring the multiverse, they encountered a world where Peter had been corrupted by Apocalypse, becoming his Horseman of Pestilence. This version of Peter had four arms and enjoyed capturing and sucking the marrow out of his victim&rsquo;s bones.
This terrifying version of Peter was first seen in Cable &amp; Deadpool #15 by Fabian Nicieza, Patrick Zircher, M3th, Gotham, and Cory Petit.</p>
<p>9  Ghost-Spider
A Former Villain Tries To Find Redemption</p>
<p>This haunting version of Spider-Man was first seen in Amazing Spider-Man Annual #38 by John Layman, Lee Garbett, Mark Pennington, Fabio D&rsquo;Auria, and Clayton Cowles.</p>
<p>Not every Spider-Man has gone through the same events that 616 Peter Parker did. In one universe, when Uncle Ben was attacked, he ended up surviving, but became bitter and jaded. Because of this, he helped the Peter of his world hone his powers, and together the two began kidnapping Spider-Men from across the multiverse to be absorbed. This allowed this Spider-Man, known as the Amazing Spider, to become stronger. Eventually, the Amazing Spider was seemingly killed when he tried to absorb the powers of 616 Spider-Man. While his soul was trapped in hell, he eventually returned as Ghost-Spider. Now fully capable of using the powers of Ghost Rider, he has since sought redemption.</p>
<p>8  Man-Spider
Peter Becomes More Spider Than Man</p>
<p>A common trope of Spider-Man is the idea that he&rsquo;s more man than spider, but a few writers have played with the idea of him being the inverse. In this storyline, Spider-Man was injected with a drug that increases user performance, but also saps their intelligence. The drug had an unintended side effect where it hyper-accelerated his spider side, turning Peter into a monstrous spider that only sought to devour people. This was by far one of Spider-Man&rsquo;s scariest forms to date, and has consistently shown up as a horror version of Spider-Man over the years, even appearing in Spider-Man: The Animated Series.
Peter&rsquo;s horrific transformation was featured in Savage Spider-Man #1 by Joe Kelly, Gerardo Sandoval, Victor Nava, Chris Sotomayor, and Travis Lanham.</p>
<p>7  Peter Parker – Patient Zero
Spider-Man Started The End Of The World</p>
<p>There are tons of universes that don&rsquo;t survive the apocalyptic scenarios they go up against. In one universe, the Punisher accidentally unleashed a virus on the world that turned people into low-intelligence cannibals. Not quite zombies, these monstrous versions of Marvel characters were not smart enough to do anything more than use basic tools and tribe-building. Spider-Man was the first person to be infected. He brought the virus to national attention when he attacked the Rhino, and ate him on live television. This infected Spider-Man would later go on to rule Manhattan as the world fell apart around him, completely freed of his notions of responsibility in this continuity.
This version of Peter Parker was explored in Marvel Universe vs The Punisher #1 by Jonathan Maberry, Goran Parlov, Lee Loughridge, and Cory Petit.</p>
<p>6  Poison Parker
Spider-Man Is Consumed By A Symbiote</p>
<p>What If? Spider-Man: The Other is by the creative team of Peter David, Khoi Pham, Sandu Florea, Marte Gracia, and Joe Carmagna.</p>
<p>Peter Parker has been on the edge of death several times and managed to come back. After an especially life-threatening battle with Morlun, it didn&rsquo;t seem like that would be the case, with Spider-Man perhaps closer to truly dying than ever before. With Peter on the verge of death, he was approached by a spirit guide and agreed to be reborn, more spider than ever. What If? Spider-Man: The Other asked the question of &ldquo;What if Spider-Man refused to be reborn?&rdquo; Instead of being brought back as a human, Peter simply stayed in his cocoon, eventually being infected by the symbiote. His will broken, Peter was reborn as Poison.</p>
<p>5  Peter Darkhold
A Less-Than-Responsible, Less-Than-Great Hero</p>
<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be any surprise that Spider-Man has issues with responsibility. This personality flaw was taken to a horrifying extreme in The Darkhold: Spider-Man. In this story, readers witnessed a twisted vision, where the world had begun collapsing from an event called the Unraveling. Every single thing in the world, people and buildings, had begun falling apart. Spider-Man tries his best to prevent this by holding everything together with his webbings, but since his webs dissolve after three hours, he constantly had to do it again. This eventually drove Peter insane, and he captured Reed Richards, using him as a physical web to hold everyone together, forever.
The Darkhold: Spider-Man is written by Alex Paknadel, with art by Dio Neves, Jim Charalampidis, and Clayton Cowles.</p>
<p>4  Zombie Spider-Man
Peter Parker Becomes Marvel&rsquo;s Most Iconic Zombie</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Marvel Zombies&rdquo; universe, the Earth was infected by a virus called the Gospel of Hunger. This virus transformed the infected into zombies; though they could still think and talk normally, their priorities were shifted to desiring human flesh over anything else. The hunger was so great it drove Spider-Man to consume both Aunt May and Mary Jane shortly after he was infected. Spider-Man would then travel throughout the universe, consuming everyone with the other infected superheroes, eventually even breaking out of his universe and invading other ones, making him a massive threat. Eventually, his sense of responsibility drove him to turn on the other zombies – but not before inflicting a terrifying amount of damage.
First appearing in Ultimate Fantastic Four #22 by Mark Millar, Greg Land, Matt Ryan, Justin Ponsor, and Chris Eliopoulos, the idea of a zombified Marvel universe would be further explored in the infamous Marvel Zombies series.</p>
<p>3  Spiders-Man
A Version Of Peter That Is All Spider, No Man</p>
<p>Everyone knows the story of how Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive spider and gained superpowers. The story of Spiders-Man was a bit more gruesome. Instead of being bitten by one radioactive spider, Peter fell into a vat of them and was consumed. His story didn&rsquo;t end there, though; the spiders became a hive with Peter&rsquo;s conscience shared among them. Deciding to take the identity of the man they consumed, the spiders wore a suit and fought crime as Spiders-Man. While this version of Spider-Man was entirely heroic, it is also completely horrific – and this idea would later be taken in a horrifying direction with another version.</p>
<p>2  The Thousand
Spider-Man Confronts His True Opposite</p>
<p>The Thousand first appeared in Tangled Web: The Thousand #1 by Garth Ennis, John McCrea, James Hodgkins, Steve Buccellato, Richard Starkings, and Wes Abbott.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, one of the most horrifying villains that Spider-Man has ever faced, the Thousand used to be a human known as Carl King. He was a bully in Peter&rsquo;s school and actually witnessed Peter being bitten by a radioactive spider. Wanting the same powers that Peter got, Carl tracked down the dead body of the radioactive spider and ate it. Instead of gaining his powers though, Carl&rsquo;s body began breaking down, becoming a hive of spiders on its own. Carl realized that not only could he consume other people to increase his own power, he could puppeteer their skin with his army of spiders, using them as drones in his hunt for Spider-Man.</p>
<p>1  Patton Parnel
A Serial Killer Version Of Spider-Man</p>
<p>The darkest version of Spider-Man that readers have seen so far is without a doubt Patton Parnel, a character specifically designed to be a sociopathic version of Peter Parker who made every dark choice that Peter didn&rsquo;t. Patton used his powers to act on his every dark impulse and eventually transformed into a literal spider monster. He consumed his own father and very nearly killed his girlfriend. If Patton hadn&rsquo;t been stopped by Morlun, he would&rsquo;ve gone on to become the worst serial killer his world had ever seen. This is why Patton Parnel is creepiest version of Spider-Man in the multiverse.
Patton Parnel first appeared in Edge of Spider-Verse #4 by Clay McLeod Chapman, Elia Bonetti, Veronica Gandini, and Clayton Cowles.</p>
