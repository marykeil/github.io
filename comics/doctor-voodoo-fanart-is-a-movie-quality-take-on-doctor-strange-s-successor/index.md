## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Voodoo&#39;s fan art by BossLogic showcases the character&#39;s menacing transformation and traditional uniform, hinting at his potential inclusion in the MCU.   Doctor Voodoo, originally known as Brother Voodoo, is a powerful magic user who briefly held the title of Sorcerer Supreme after Doctor Strange.

## Literature Review

Should Doctor Voodoo appear in a future Doctor Strange film, artist BossLogic has pointed the way for the MCU in an epic new piece of fanart.




A new piece of Doctor Voodoo fan art provides a movie quality take on Doctor Strange’s successor. Doctor Voodoo is one of Marvel’s premiere magic users, and was even the Sorcerer Supreme at one point. Rumors swirled that Doctor Voodoo would be in the previous Doctor Strange movie, but that failed to materialize. Now, acclaimed artist BossLogic has created an epic new Doctor Voodoo piece that points the way should he join the MCU.




BossLogic unveiled the piece in a post on Instagram, prefacing the piece by saying “one day….” The piece captures Doctor Voodoo in a moment of transformation. Against a smoky background, Doctor Voodoo looks menacingly at the reader. His face seems to be changing, taking on a more skeletal appearance. His eyes glow with ominous blue energy.

For 50 years, Doctor Voodoo has inhabited some of the darkest corners of the magical side of the Marvel Universe. First appearing in Strange Tales #169, Doctor Voodoo (then known as “Brother Voodoo”) was Jericho Drumm. After his brother falls victim to dark forces, Jericho begins studying the mystical arts, eventually fighting alongside Doctor Strange. Many years later, when Doctor Strange used his powers in a way unbecoming of a Sorcerer Supreme, Voodoo took over the title. Although his run was brief, he proved to be a worthy successor to Doctor Strange. Now, Doctor Voodoo is headmaster of Strange Academy, helping teach the next generation of magic users.

Doctor Voodoo’s rise in prominence in the Marvel Universe helped fuel rumors that he would make the leap to live-action and join the MCU in a future Doctor Strange movie, yet this has not happened. BossLogic’s new piece of art makes a strong case for Doctor Voodoo’s inclusion into the MCU. If the MCU chose to bring him in for a later movie, it could help bolster his profile as well as dispel the many myths and misconceptions that surround Voodoo. BossLogic’s Doctor Voodoo art captures the spirit of the character, showing him as the dangerous sorcerer he is.

Doctor Voodoo’s arrival in the MCU would also shake up Doctor Strange’s world. He once held the title of Sorcerer Supreme, but disappearing after Thanos’ snap, it went to Wong. Doctor Strange would return, but Wong still holds the title. Should a third Doctor Strange film be made, Strange must get his title back, and Doctor Voodoo could be introduced as a contender. Going this route would show audiences that Doctor Voodoo is not only a powerful magician in his own right, but can also go toe-to-toe with Doctor Strange, and even succeed him.
