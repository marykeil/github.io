# Star Wars Just Made a Powerful Battlefront II Ability Official Canon


## SUMMARY 



  Star Wars Battlefront II&#39;s Lando Calrissian character has a powerful ability called Sharp Shot, which has now been made official canon in the Star Wars universe.   Lando&#39;s Sharp Shot ability is showcased in the latest issue of Star Wars #41, where he displays impressive marksmanship and takes down enemies effortlessly.   The comic may also be referencing a glitch from the Battlefront game, where Lando&#39;s Power Blast ability had no cooldown, allowing him to defeat enemies with a single shot, similar to what he does in the issue.

## Literature Review

Lando Calrissian has one very powerful ability in Star Wars: Battlefront II that he never outwardly had in the official Star Wars canon - until now. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars #41 Star Wars Battlefront II is easily the most iconic of the Battlefront games, and is considered by many to be just as important to the wider Star Wars lore as any movie/TV/novel/comic book additions. While the nature of Battlefront all but prevents it from being a true canonical inclusion (despite the campaign actually being considered canon), the established lore did take one major step in that direction during Star Wars’ most recent adventure, as the series just made a powerful Battlefront II ability official.




Star Wars Battlefront II is a single and multiplayer game that offers a campaign with a storyline set between Episode VI and Episode VII, though it is more widely regarded as an online action/shooter game. Aside from the canonical campaign, there are a plethora of missions and objectives that players can enjoy that aren’t technically ‘Star Wars official’. But more than that, there are also a number of iconic characters gamers can play as, including one in particular: Lando Calrissian.

          

In Star Wars Battlefront II, Lando’s Sharp Shot causes damage at 200 from a range of 40 meters, making him a particularly deadly character to play as, with some players even calling Lando’s Sharp Shot an over-powered ability. And now, Lando’s Sharp Shot has been brought into the official Star Wars canon, as his shooting skills are put on full display during the latest chapter of Dark Droids.




                  Star Wars Finally Explains How &amp; Why Droids Feel Pain (&amp; It Actually Makes Sense)   Although the majority of Star Wars&#39; droids have been considered mindless, programmed machines, comics from Marvel have confirmed they can feel pain.   


 Lando Calrissian’s Sharp Shot Battlefront II Ability Is Brought Into Star Wars Canon 
         

In Star Wars #41 by Charles Soule and Madibek Musabekov, Luke, Leia, Chewie, and Lando are battling an army of droids that have been infected with the Scourge. The Scourge is a viral AI hivemind hellbent on assimilating the entire galaxy, and it’s just learned how to possess living organics as well as mechanical droids. This puts the Star Wars heroes in much greater danger than before. Thankfully, however, they have Lando with them, who is one-shotting enemies left and right.

Not only is Lando displaying impressive marksmanship right before readers&#39; eyes, but the comic draws even more attention to his skills with a quick exchange between Lando and Leia, where Leia asks Lando when he became such a good shot. Then, the issue doubles-down on this attention, as Lando later tells a droid he’s trying to threaten into doing his bidding, “I’m a very good shot”.






 Star Wars May Be Referencing An Iconic Battlefront Glitch As Well As Sharp Shot 
          

Star Wars established that Lando Calrissian is a great shot in the main series canon, just as he is with Sharp Shot in Battlefront II, which is significant given that Lando never really displayed this ability in Star Wars up until this point. However, when taking a look at the panels in which Lando was actually displaying his sharp-shooter skills, it seems like Sharp Shot wasn’t the only aspect of his Battlefront shooting ability being referenced. Before the January 2017 update, there was a glitch in Star Wars Battlefront that made Lando’s Power Blast ability endless, no cooldown required. This allowed Lando to down enemies with a single shot - even vehicles - which is exactly what he was doing to the Scourge droids in this issue.

Regardless of exactly what aspect of Lando Calrissian’s sharp-shooting abilities are being referenced, the fact of the matter is Lando never displayed this skill besides in Battlefront or Battlefront II, but now, Star Wars just made it official canon.




Star Wars #41 by Marvel Comics is available now.
