# Thor Confirms Who the Real Goddess of Thunder is (Even If She Isn t an Actual Goddess)


## SUMMARY 



  In a recent issue of Immortal Thor, the God of Thunder acknowledges Storm as the Goddess of Thunder, giving her a major compliment, considering she is not actually a deity in the strictest sense.   Thor respects Storm as an equal, and honors her by elevating her to his status.   Storm&#39;s role as a pivotal character in the X-franchise is emphasized by Thor&#39;s need for her in the newly reformed Thor Corps.

## Literature Review

Immortal Thor #3 finds the God of Thunder, the All-Father, soliciting help to fight his greatest threat ever, including from the Goddess of Thunder.




Warning: Spoilers for The Immortal Thor #3!




X-Men&#39;s Storm may not be an actual deity by Marvel Universe Standards, but Thor certainly thinks highly of her enough to dub her the Goddess of Thunder. Wielding Omega-level weather control powers – similar, though not exactly the same as those of Asgard&#39;s All-Father – Storm is one of Thor&#39;s first choices to join his new iteration of the Thor Corps, based on her immense strength and battle prowess.

The Immortal Thor #3 – written by Al Ewing, with art by Martín Cóccolo – concludes with Thor summoning Storm, in order to recruit her. When Thor must face perhaps the biggest challenge of his life, he declares that he needs the help of the Goddess of Thunder, and the final page reveals that so-called goddess to, in fact, be X-Men&#39;s Storm.

          




In the middle of her own affairs on the mutant planet Arakko, Storm isn&#39;t thrilled to have been abruptly called to Thor, though she should at least be honored by his acknowledgement of her status as one of Marvel&#39;s most powerful beings.

Even though Storm is not officially a deity, Thor respects her as if she were a god. As Thor prepares to combat his biggest challenge yet, the God of the Super-Storm, Toranos, he receives some unexpected guidance from his meddlesome but often well-meaning brother. Loki locks Thor into a test, one that allows Thor not only the opportunity to forge a new weapon, but also the opportunity for clarity about his situation. He realizes that to take on Toranos, he is going to need allies. The first one that comes to his mind is Storm; when he brings her into the conversation, Thor acknowledges her as &#34;The Goddess of Thunder.&#34;




This isn&#39;t the first time Thor has admitted Storm is the superior weather-wielder, and ultimately, the more powerful superhero. It&#39;s not too hard to see why Thor would feel so inclined to praise Storm as such time and time again, outside what she&#39;s shown to be capable of when it comes to manipulating thunder. Her biggest claim to being a goddess may be in how she has proven to be worthy of lifting Mjolnir. Obviously, not everyone who has lifted Mjolnir is a god, but being capable of lifting a god-like object that is as coveted and rare to grasp as Mjolnir makes for a strong argument for god-like potential.

The bigger picture is that with this declaration of his need for Storm, it would appear that the stage has been set for Thor to forming his Thor Corps. As previously teased in past solicits for future issues, the Thor Corps is expected to feature Thor, Storm, Beta Ray Bill, Jane Foster, and Loki. Thor wants Storm not only because he views her as a God-level master of thunder, but since most of the team seems to master weather manipulators in their own right, Thor may want to fight fire with fire. To combat an even more powerful cosmic being, Thor must band together a super-team of storm masters.
