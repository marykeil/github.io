## SUMMARY 



  Godspeed&#39;s transformation into a horrifying wasp-like creature makes him one of the most terrifying villains The Flash has ever faced.   Godspeed&#39;s abilities, such as being in two places at once, have always made him terrifying, but his transformation into a literal monster takes it to a whole new level.   Godspeed becoming a superfast serial killer wasp is nightmare fuel and unlikely to be forgotten by Barry Allen or Flash fans anytime soon.

## Literature Review

The Flash is used to fighting terrifying villains such as telepathic gorillas and speedster serial killers, but one villain just got a major upgrade.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City!




One of the Flash&#39;s biggest villains, Godspeed, has just undergone a truly terrifying transformation. The Flash has one of the most varied rogues&#39; galleries of anyone in comic books. On one hand, he has fairly light-hearted criminals such as the Rogues, and on the other hand, he has truly terrifying villains like Reverse Flash and Gorilla Grodd. With his latest upgrade, Godspeed definitely proves that he belongs in this latter category.

As DC&#39;s Beast World storyline goes into full swing, the Beast spores have begun raining down all over the planet. These spores have been unleashed by Garro, the monstrous form of Beast Boy, and have the effect of turning people into beasts themselves. The resuts are often horrifying.



          



In a preview for Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City by Si Spurrier, Scott Koblish, Hi-Fi and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou, Barry Allen is rushing to save Central City from being torn apart. He sees the villain Godspeed has been transformed into a horrifying wasp-like creature that is in the process of capturing a civilian to eat. Godspeed was always a major threat, but now that he&#39;s a literal monster, he&#39;s more terrifying than ever.




                  The Flash: GODSPEED Was Always Planned To Be Killed   Godspeed might have been a fan-favorite, but from the beginning, it was his destiny to die at the hands of his brother&#39;s murderer.   


 Godspeed Shows Off His Terrifying New Form 
         

The Flash often has to face off against villains who are just as fast as him. Godspeed is one of the worst villains the Flash has ever faced off against, partly because he used to be Flash&#39;s partner. August Heart was Barry Allen&#39;s partner in the police department and helped him solve plenty of crimes and save many lives. During one encounter, he ended up being struck by lightning and gained super speed. From then on, he tried to be Barry Allen&#39;s partner, both as a cop and as the Flash. Eventually, August&#39;s motivations would become darker, and he&#39;d become a brutal vigilante who killed anyone in his way.




Godspeed has always been terrifying due to his abilities, such as being able to be in two places at once. Now that he&#39;s transformed into a literal monster, he&#39;s more terrifying than ever before. Most people already dislike wasps, and Godspeed is now a superfast serial killer wasp. It&#39;s quite literally one of the most terrifying things a villain can become in comic books. Being transformed into a beast has made Godspeed more dangerous than ever, and hopefully, the Flash Family will be able to bring him down before it&#39;s too late.



 Godspeed Is Truly Nightmare Fuel Now 


          



The Flash has faced off against a super-speed gorilla that eats people&#39;s brains, and he&#39;s faced off against a deranged speedster who killed his mother. But none of those are as terrifying as the idea of one of his worst villains and former friends being turned into a super-speed wasp. Out of all the Beast World transformations that readers have seen so far, Godspeed transforming into a wasp is truly nightmare fuel that it&#39;s unlikely Barry Allen will be able to forget anytime soon.




The Beast spores have thrown the entire world into disarray. Black Adam has become a lightning-empowered lion in Khandaq, Batman has been transformed into a literal lone wolf, and now the Flash has to deal with a wasp version of one of his worst enemies. DC promised readers interesting and terrifying new transformations from this event and, so far, the publisher hasn&#39;t failed to deliver, and it&#39;s unlikely fans or the Flash will forget this nightmarish new version of Godspeed anytime soon. Hopefully, the Flash Family will be able to quickly swat this dangerous new form of Godspeed.



Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City will be available December 19 from DC Comics!
