# Sorry, But Colossus  Codename Makes No Sense


## SUMMARY 



  Colossus&#39; current codename fails to highlight his most important qualities, including his Russian heritage, and doesn&#39;t fully embody his power of nearly-invulnerable organic steel skin.   A name change for Piotr Rasputin could be the perfect way to usher in Colossus&#39; new era and acknowledge his major character development.   Exchanging the name Colossus for something more appropriate, which suits him better than his current moniker, would be an appropriate development for the character after suffering greatly as Colossus during recent storylines.

## Literature Review

Colossus is one of Marvel&#39;s most recognizable mutants, but his codename is ill-fitting considering his background, powers, and what he&#39;s capable of. 




Colossus is one of the X-Men’s heaviest hitters, but his codename doesn’t do his character justice. While some mutant names are more literal interpretations than others – Iceman isn’t getting any points for being inventive – Piotr Rasputin&#39;s mutant moniker does little to highlight what he’s capable of. Given all he’s been through in recent storylines, a name change could be the perfect way to usher in his new era.




Many of the X-Men&#39;s codenames have been chosen by someone other than themselves, with Professor X having a hand in several renamings. The name ‘Colossus’ does evoke ideas of something large and strong, and technically, Piotr fits the bill. However, he’s hardly the largest mutant around, and his primary ability is generating nearly-invulnerable organic steel skin.

         

With that in mind, it’s hard to consider Colossus as the best choice of codename. It fails to showcase the most important qualities of one of the most recognizable mutants around. There are plenty of things about Piotr worth highlighting, and none appear in his current superhero identity.


 Marvel Missed the Mark With Colossus’ Name 
          






X-Patrol #1 was written by Karl Kessel, with art by Barbara Randal Kesel, Roger Cruz, and Tom Vincent. It was published in 1996.




When considering Piotr Rasputin, two things come to mind immediately: he’s Russian, which is a well-known fact that has played a major role in his life, and he frequently sports obvious metal skin over his whole body. The latter makes him one of the X-Men’s most prized fighters, and he’s frequently pitted against other powerhouses like The Thing, The Hulk, and others. Neither of these are embodied (or even included) with the name Colossus. Instead, the Colossus of Rhodes statue is prized for being the tallest in the ancient world, and it was crafted to honor the Greek god, Helios. None of those qualities lead back to Piotr Rasputin.

Amalgam Comics, a fusion of the Marvel and DC Universes, offered a slightly different take on Colossus. X-Patrol #1 combined him with Ferro Lad, and together they became “Ferro Man.” At the very least, the name touches upon the fact that Piotr has metal skin. A similar play upon the idea of steel or metal would highlight his most recognizable strength, which even his brief stint as ‘Juggernaut’ managed to do to a higher degree. Exchanging the Green ‘Colossus’ for something rooted in his Russian background would be more appropriate, too, as it’s a country rich in folklore and mythical beasts and heroes. Any one of them would suit Piotr better than his current moniker.






 A Name Change for Colossus Could Acknowledge Major Events 


          

Piotr has long been considered one of the most honorable X-Men. He’s willing to sacrifice his life for the greater good or to protect those he cares about, and he doesn’t back down from a fight when he’s needed. However, his reputation has been tarnished after years of manipulation by his brother, Mikhail. That influence is over, but he’s still left to pick up the pieces of the life he once had. Shedding his old name could be the next step for Colossus. After all he and the X-Men have endured, Piotr deserves a chance to grow – and wear a name that fits his abilities and deeds.
