## Literature Review

Superman may strongly value life, but Lex Luthor has done the unthinkable and sentenced Lois to death, pushing Clark enough to finally kill his enemy.




Warning! Preview pages ahead for Superman: Lost #9!Lex Luthor has done a lot of horrible things in his life, but his latest act has finally pushed Superman to his breaking point. Clark has been distant ever since he came back to Earth, but his greatest enemy has lit a fire under Superman by threatening Lois Lane, and it&#39;s causing him to cross a major line.




In a preview for Superman: Lost #9 by Christopher Priest, Carlo Pagulayan, Jason Paz, Dan Jurgens, and Brett Breeding, Lois Lane is investigating a story. But the cancer Lex Luthor gave her is making her considerably weaker by the second.

         

Earlier in the day, Lex Luthor is incognito in a coffee shop, waiting for Superman to attack. The Man of Steel suddenly comes in and sends Lex Luthor through a brick wall. All Lex can see while he collides through brick and mortar is Superman&#39;s symbol as Clark throws a defenseless Lex straight into the front of an oncoming bus.


 Superman is Going to Kill Lex Luthor For Giving Lois Lane Cancer 
          




After a mission with the Justice League went sideways, Superman was lost for nearly twenty years (though he was relatively gone for about a day). Since coming home, Clark has struggled to overcome his travels through space, particularly his inability to save a planet from dying. After failing to help Clark readapt to life on Earth, Lois reached out to Lex Luthor to see if he could do something to help Lois snap out of it. Unfortunately, Lex&#39;s plan involved giving Lois an aggressive form of cancer. Not wanting to give Lex the satisfaction, she hid her symptoms from Clark. However, Clark pieced things together after discovering her calls with Lex.

Superman is generally firm in his stance that it&#39;s not his place to kill, even someone as despicable or evil as Lex Luthor. However, Lois Lane is the most important person in Clark&#39;s life, and other out-of-continuity stories have seen him kill people for hurting Lois (such as Injustice). It should also be noted that the caption preceding Superman and Lex&#39;s fight, &#34;Quand Viendra l&#39;Instant&#34;, a musical number from the opera Les Troyens, translates to &#34;When the moment comes&#34;. This could be an acknowledgment that Lex has finally done something that is making Superman break his moral code and kill Lex Luthor.






 Harming Lois Lane Brings Out Superman&#39;s Worst Side 
          

It&#39;s not that Lex Luthor has never imperiled Lois&#39; life before. But this time, he&#39;s condemned Lois to death and Superman can&#39;t do a thing about it. Clark may have snapped out of his funk, but he&#39;s seeing red and wants nothing more than to hurt the man who is taking Superman&#39;s wife away from him. Other stories have shown that when Superman loses Lois, it&#39;s not unusual to act in ways he ordinarily wouldn&#39;t. Now that it&#39;s only a matter of time before Lois perishes and Superman has nothing to lose, he&#39;s about to get his pound of flesh directly from Lex Luthor.

Superman: Lost #9 is on sale December 12th from DC Comics.
