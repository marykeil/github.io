## Literature Review

As the Beast World event reaches Gotham, Red Hood and Batman find themselves stuck as wolves - proving they&#39;re more alike than either want to admit.

As DC&#39;s Beast World event kicks into high gear and works its way into Gotham, Batman and several family members undergo transformations of their own, yet only two share the same form. The Dark Knight and Red Hood both become monstrous werewolves, highlighting their similarities at a time when they seem so far apart, further marking Jason as Batman&#39;s most natural successor among his many proteges.

Titans: Beast World Tour - Gotham #1 – an anthology issue featuring stories by several different writers and artists –introduces Beast Boy&#39;s infectious spores to Gotham City, triggering animalistic changes for several familiar faces. While Nightwing is slated to take on the appearance of a fox, and Damian Wayne will have the form of a cat, both Bruce Wayne and Jason Todd get more ferocious animal identities.






          

The core feelings of anger and rage the two share, for once, will manifest in the same way: by turning them into bloodthirsty werewolves, ready to cause a whole host of problems for their superhero peers.


 Beast World Shows the DC Universe Who They Are 


          

Beast World, DC Comics latest crossover event, is the culmination of iconic Titan Beast Boy&#39;s trauma and self-doubt, with this pushing him to new heights of power. As he attempts to take on the form of the Necrostar, he instead causes an ever-expanding series of animal transformations similar to how Starro spreads the hive-mind. That means Beast Boy isn&#39;t the only one undergoing changes, and what&#39;s more, those affected have little to no control over what happens to them. While some of the ensuing transformations aren&#39;t surprising, and powerful villains become equally powerful half-animal monsters, not everything is so predictable.






Titans: Beast World Tour - Gotham #1 features art from Miguel Mendonca, Kelley Jones, Daniel Hillyard, P.J. Holden, and Ivan Shavrin.




Batman&#39;s Beast World form seems like one of the easiest to predict, given the creature he&#39;s modeled himself after. Yet instead of shifting to something close to his namesake, he winds up as an out-of-control werewolf entity – and he isn&#39;t the only one. Red Hood winds up in a similar situation, meaning whatever within Batman the transformation brought forth is also found in Jason Todd. The change is a clear reminder that the two are incredibly similar, no matter how many conflicts they find with each other. It also sets them up as some of the most formidable and dangerous transformations in Beast World – especially if they work together.



 Red Hood Has Always Been Batman&#39;s Challenger 
          




When examining Batman and the Bat-Family, there are others who are more openly like Bruce. Cassandra Cain shares many of the same values and morals, Tim Drake rivals and surpasses Batman&#39;s detective skills, Damian Wayne lives and breathes his father&#39;s legacy, and Nightwing has already proved he&#39;s capable of wearing the cowl. Jason Todd, by contrast, has frequently found himself at odds with Bruce because the two are so similar at their core. While Bruce operates by suppressing and channeling his rage into a strict, unmovable code and tactics, Jason is propelled forward by his - using it to lash out against any threat, real or perceived.

Beast World stripes away Batman&#39;s carefully curated control. Without it, he is left only with the fury and drive he shares with Jason. It puts the two on equal ground. DC is prone to pointing out their differences, and the characters themselves get hung up on what divides them. Yet even since his Red Hood and the Lost Days era, Jason has always been incredibly similar to Bruce, especially in his methodical, pain-driven approach. Beast World presents a unique chance to lift the veil and see who they are beneath it. By lifting their masks and replacing them with fur and fangs, it&#39;s clear that Red Hood is Batman&#39;s closest parallel and successor.




Titans: Beast World Tour - Gotham #1 will be available on 12/12/2023 from DC Comics!
