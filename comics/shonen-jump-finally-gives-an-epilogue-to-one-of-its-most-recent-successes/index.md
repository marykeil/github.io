## Literature Review

Mashle’s Mash Burnedead may have turned in his school cape for a pastry chef smock, but he’s still fighting magic in new and unpredictable ways.




Warning: SPOILERS for Mashle: Magic and Muscles special one-shot




Just in time for the highly anticipated second season of the hit anime Mashle: Magic and Muscles, Shōnen Jump dropped a special one-shot chapter. This special release adds to the Mashle lore and teases potential new stories in the future. It&#39;s a nice bit of fan service that shows there are still stories to tell in the Mashle universe that do not necessarily need to include Mash, Lance, Finn, and the other students and teachers at the Easton Magic Academy.

Hajime Komoto&#39;s Mashle: Magic and Muscles tells the story of Mash Burnedead, a magic-less person living in a world where those who cannot use magic are ostracized and condemned. After being caught, Mash makes a deal to avoid a lifetime of being pursued by the government. According to the terms of the agreement, Mash must become a Divine Visionary - a position that has always been awarded to the most outstanding magic-using student at Easton.


 




Despite all the odds being against him, Mash becomes a student at Easton, where he meets and befriends a motley crew of classmates. Using his superhuman strength, muscles, and willpower, Mash is not only able to excel at school but also helps and inspires his friends. After 162 chapters, Mashle ended, but not as fans expected. Mash was indeed chosen as the year&#39;s Divine Visionary, but he turned down the position. Instead, he used the fame that came from saving the world to advocate for a world where the magic-less enjoy the same status as magic users, and are given the right to live in peace without being discriminated against.



The second season of Mashle: Magic and Muscles is currently airing on Crunchyroll.





 Mash Comes Back And Proves He Changed The World For The Better 
          




The new one-shot manga takes place in the aftermath of Mash&#39;s forfeiture of the Divine Visionary position - which instead goes to his good friend Lance. Thanks to Mash, the world seems more tolerant of the magic-less population. Mash&#39;s success did not just improve the status and treatment of the magic-less, it also proved that a reliance on magic is not the only route to success. Mash&#39;s success showed one can survive, and even thrive, without putting all their hope into their magic abilities. In a world where status and power have traditionally been based on one&#39;s ability to use magic, Mash&#39;s success was an existential threat to the system.

In the new one-shot manga, this plays out as the story of a young magic user from a prominent family of magic users. While the kid has the bloodline to one day become a Divine Visionary - he&#39;s just not that good at magic. Accordingly, his tutor decides to inspire him by taking him to Easton to observe the elite of the magic world. Unfortunately, Mash is still around and provides an equally appealing reason why magic is overrated. Naturally, this ends up inspiring the kid to live life on his own terms and not let others dictate his decisions, just like Mash.






 There&#39;s Many More Mashle Stories To Be Told 
         

With little more to be said in the tale of Mash&#39;s rise from outcast to savior of the world, the new one-shot manga is a great way to add interesting content to the Mashle mythology without retelling the story. We see Mash and his friends from a new perspective that expands their tale after the end of their adventure. It also creates the possibility for a continuation of the franchise if creator Hajime Komoto and Shōnen Jump decide to bring back the Mashle universe through the stories of new characters.
