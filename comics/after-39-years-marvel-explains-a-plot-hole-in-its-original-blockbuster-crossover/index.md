## Literature Review

After 39 long years, Marvel has finally explained one of the biggest plot holes from the original Secret Wars crossover.




Warning: contains spoilers for Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars: Battleworld #1!




After 39 years, Marvel has explained a plot hole in its original blockbuster crossover. Marvel ushered in the modern comics’ crossover in 1984 with the publication of Secret Wars, gathering the publisher’s heroes and villains and pitting them against each other. A tie-in toy line was released, featuring characters from the series, and a few who were not. Now, in Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars: Battleworld #1, a character excluded from the original event finally gets his due.

Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars: Battleworld #1 is written by Tom DeFalco and drawn by Pat Olliffe. Set during the original Secret Wars, the Beyonders decide to toy with Spider-Man by hurling him through different dimensions, with only the Human Torch for backup. The two run afoul of the Absorbing Man, who is a handful on his own.

          




To spice the conflict up further, the Beyonders pull the Hobgoblin to Battleworld, and he teams up with the Absorbing Man to kill Spider-Man and the Torch.


 Secret Wars Shaped Modern Comics 
          

The first Secret Wars, written by Jim Shooter and drawn by Mike Zeck, helped change the landscape of American superhero comics. The 12-issue maxi-series was unlike anything that had come before. While Marvel’s icons regularly crossed over into each other’s titles, Secret Wars was far grander in scope. Mattel released a line of toys to go with the series and many of Secret Wars&#39; biggest players, such as Spider-Man, Wolverine and Doctor Doom, received action figures. A few Marvel characters who did not appear in the series also received toys–including the Hobgoblin. While the toy was undeniably cool, Hobgoblin had no role in the series, making his presence there a curiosity. 





 

The Hobgoblin had a good reason for not participating in the first Secret Wars event: he was dead. Spider-Man notes this when the Hobgoblin appears, raising questions over how he is able to be on Battleworld. The possibility that he is merely an illusion created by the Beyonders, or this could be Hobgoblin from another time frame. There have been many Hobgoblins over the years, ranging from Ned Leeds to Phil Urich, meaning the new entrant into Battleworld could be any one of them. Regardless of who it is, the Hobgoblin aims to kill Spider-Man, and with the Absorbing Man in the mix, becomes even deadlier.



 Hobgoblin Finally Has A Role in Secret Wars 
          




Marvel Super Heroes: Secret Wars: Battleworld finally gives the Hobgoblin his due. Hobgoblin’s addition to the story is but one of many shout-outs to the Secret Wars toy line scattered throughout the book. Rather than make this a simple exercise in nostalgia, however, DeFalco and Olliffe instead use Hobgoblin to enhance the story, raising the stakes and avoiding a simple retread of the original story. Hobgoblin’s inclusion into Secret Wars 39 years later addresses one of the biggest plot holes of that event.
