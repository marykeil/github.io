Even Batman struggles to take down Wonder Woman, but Cassandra&#39;s approach of outsmarting and overwhelming her from a distance proves effective.  







While Batman has won more times than not against Wonder Woman, the methods he&#39;s used have never been ideal plans for such a strong fighter. Now, one Bat-Family member has taken on Wonder Woman with the perfect plan. Batgirl Cassandra Cain has finally shown Batman how it should be done.

As of Birds of Prey #4 by Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero, the Birds are on the island of Themyscira to rescue Dinah&#39;s sister Sin from an evil being that wants to take over her body. Knowing the Amazons are being manipulated by this being, they opt to sneak in and save Sin, knocking out any Amazons they come across. The biggest problem with this plan is Wonder Woman; while the Birds hoped she wouldn&#39;t be alerted, she appears in this issue, ready to defend her home.

          




The Birds of Prey try to defeat Wonder Woman, which leads to a fantastic fight between Wonder Woman and Batgirl Cassandra Cain. Unable to fight Wonder Woman directly, Batgirl tries to overwhelm Diana with speed and gadgets.

 Batgirl Cassandra Cain Overwhelms Wonder Woman with Gadgetry and Stealth 
          

Batman is known to have a contingency plan for anything; he&#39;s someone who can beat anyone, including the god-like members of the Justice League, given enough prep time. Batman&#39;s plans have led to him defeating the notoriously hard-to-beat Wonder Woman several times, most notably during the events of Tower of Babel and Batman: Endgame. But one of the major problems with this repeated defeat has always been Batman&#39;s methods, which should not work on Wonder Woman due to her power set. This is why Batgirl&#39;s method is so much smarter in this knock-out fight between two iconic DC women.




Batman often tries to defeat Wonder Woman through trickery — like trapping Diana in a lie to avoid outright fighting her. But Diana, a hero associated with the truth, has the ability to see through all lies. Wonder Woman once even ignored the Black Mercy visions, a feat never shown by anyone else. This is why Batman&#39;s methods should always fail, and why Cassandra&#39;s attempt to defeat Wonder Woman through sheer overwhelming stimulation works better. Cassandra — also known as one of DC&#39;s most powerful hand-to-hand combatants — knows Wonder Woman is a powerhouse and cannot be fought directly, so she uses her stealth training and array of gadgets to disorient Diana without directly entering combat with her.

With no real physical weakness, Wonder Woman is one of the most powerful fighters in the DC Universe. The fight in this issue is unique in that it shows how another powerful DC woman, Cassandra Cain, might feasibly take down Diana — something even Batman struggles to do. Bat-Family member Batgirl shows that if someone wants to bring Diana down, the answer is to avoid direct contact and simply try to outsmart and overwhelm Wonder Woman from a distance, which is a lesson Batman should really learn.
