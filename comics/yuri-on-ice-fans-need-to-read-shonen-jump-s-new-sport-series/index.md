## Literature Review

The hit anime, Yuri on Ice, was a sports story focused on figure skating. Now, Shonen Jump has a new figure skating manga series: Two on Ice. 




A new figure skating manga from Shonen Jump is bringing back tones of Yuri on Ice. Two on Ice follows two skaters as they work hard at their chosen sport. The main character has great admiration for one of the top competitors in figure skating, while showing what each is independently capable of.




Two on Ice is a manga series by Elck Itsumo. It began in September 2023 and up to now has released five chapters. It is a sports romance manga that follows Hayuma Minekoshi and Kisama Saotome.

          

The series focusses on, Kisama, a skating prodigy in women&#39;s skating who rose above her competitors before suddenly disappearing. Hayuma imitated Kisama&#39;s movements from the TV and replicated some of her abilities without having any formal training.

Yuri on Ice was a hit anime produced by MAPPA and created by Sayo Yamamoto and Mitsurō Kubo. It aired from October to December in 2016. The series - highly acclaimed by a few popular Olympic figure skaters - followed Yuri Katsuki as he trained under Victor Nikiforov, a champion figure skater. Inspired by his mentor&#39;s past achievements and striving to do his best, the two eventually fall in love and continue their skating journeys together. While these stories are very different in many regards, they share a few important thematic similarities that make Two on Ice a fun, new Shonen Jump manga for fans of the hit figure skating anime.




Hayuma&#39;s admiration for Kisama is a parallel between the series, in that one skater is idolizing another due to their high skillset. Additionally, it is a series that explores some of the personal hardships that can influence a skater&#39;s journey, the way Yuri on Ice did. However, Two on Ice sets itself apart from Yuri on Ice by making the main skaters peers who can compete at the same level by joining together as a pair. Its focus on pair skating, while allowing for independent development and struggles, makes it a highly promising sports manga. Hayuma is limited by his lack of training, but he still has time to rise above his shortcomings and has the potential to excel in independent competition.

Contrarily, Kisama is limited by her age if she remains in individual competition due to the strain independent skills take on the female body. However, by competing in pairs, she&#39;d have more longevity to do what she loves as an equal. Hayuma and Kisama could be ideal partners, elevating each other and rising to the top of pairs skating. They could be held back by Hayuma&#39;s skills and Kisama&#39;s desire to not hold her prospective partner back from reaching his full potential. This could result in a beautiful partnership of equals portrayed through a figure skating lens. While different enough to be its own unique story, Two on Ice should be a Shonen Jump series Yuri on Ice fans give a chance based on its similar themes.
