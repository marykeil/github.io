## Literature Review

As Kitty Pryde sacrifices her humanity to fight the X-Men&#39;s final battle, fans see extreme new limits to her powers that have been hidden until now.




Warning: contains spoilers for Rise of the Powers of X #1!As the X-Men struggle to save life on Earth from the god of all AI, Kate &#39;Kitty&#39; Pryde has sacrificed her humanity to fight back - unlocking wild new powers in the process. To beat back the rise of the machines and the death of all biological life, Kate has consumed a Death Seed - a deadly artifact which has unlocked the full potential of her powers.




Fans see the transformation in Rise of the Powers of X, which is set ten years in the future - after the X-Men lost their definitive final battle against Orchis. By this time, almost all mutants are dead, with just a few cells of X-Men fighters still battling to stop an AI takeover. As the final team of Synch, Kamala Khan&#39;s Captain Krakoa, Wolverine, an AI copy of Tony Stark, and Kate Pryde assemble, the X-Men&#39;s resident &#39;little sister&#39; is anything but - Kate is a hulking warrior now codenamed Shadowtiger, with the issue revealing this is because she consumed a Celestial Death Seed.

          

Post-Death Seed, Kate&#39;s powers have become far more extreme. Not only can she now use her phasing powers at range - meaning she no longer needs to be touching someone/thing to make it intangible - but she can also &#34;fold space&#34; to effect translocation. In Marvel lore, translocation is the most dependable method of teleportation - impossible to interrupt or guard against, but difficult to achieve with technology as it&#39;s reliant on Reed Richards-level genius to pull off.

 Kate Pryde&#39;s Shadowtiger Unlocks Her Full Powers - Including Teleportation 
The X-Men&#39;s &#39;Kid Sister&#39; Goes Dark
         

Since the beginning of the Krakoan Age in 2019, the X-Men have been battling against one singular fate - the rise of AI, as represented by the powerful Sentinel Nimrod. As Rise of the Powers of X #1 begins, that fate has come to pass, and Nimrod is hours away from summoning the robot god known as the Dominion to Earth - where it will raze the planet of all biological life. The X-Men&#39;s plan to fight back is simple - kill Mister Sinister. Sinister has been imprisoned by Orchis, but the X-Men believe killing him will set off a series of failsafes left behind by the mad scientist. To do it, Kate throws Wolverine while opening a series of teleportation points, allowing him to emerge in Sinister&#39;s cell.




Kate&#39;s new powers are incredible, as her ability to turn intangible has been upgraded to precise control over different layers of reality. However, to master her powers to this extreme she&#39;s had to become &#39;Shadowtiger&#39; - a version of Kate Pryde who has been upgraded by Celestial evolutionary technology and turned into the caretaker of evolution. The comic makes it clear that little of the original Kate&#39;s mercy or compassion remain, and that&#39;s no wonder, given some of the horrific villains the Death Seed has created in the past.



 The Death Seed Has Created Some of X-Men&#39;s Scariest Villains 
Throughout X-Men History, the Death Seed Has Turned Heroes into Monsters
         

Way back at the beginning of time, the cosmic race known as the Celestials made it their business to safeguard life, hoping to create a huge variety of new beings who could act as an army against their enemies. After seeding planets with life, Celestials appoint a caretaker - someone who will ensure that evolution unfolds as planned, and that strength triumphs over weakness. The Celestials upgrade their caretakers to match the world&#39;s mightiest superhumans, but also leave behind a Death Seed - technology which can be used to empower the next in line, should their chosen caretaker fall.




On Earth, the Celestials&#39; chosen caretaker is the ancient mutant Apocalypse, and he&#39;s used the Death Seed many times to transform willing and unwilling superhumans into his successors, renaming each of them &#39;Death&#39; while they&#39;re in the role. Heroes like Wolverine, Archangel, Gambit, Psylocke and even the Sentry have been enhanced by the Death Seed, taking on powerful new forms while also developing a fanatical obsession with &#39;pruning&#39; humanity for the betterment of evolution.

Now, Kate Pryde has joined that list, as the Shadowtiger demonstrates the huge power upgrade the Death Seed can grant, but also the role any Death must play in violently protecting the progress of biological life. Kate couldn&#39;t have chosen a better weapon to combat Orchis&#39; AI villains, nor one that would take a bigger toll on her soul.



 Kate Pryde&#39;s Ultimate Form Embraces Her Inner Darkness 
Shadowtiger Is a Warning of What Kate Could Become
         




Over the course of the Krakoan Era, Kate has gone from being the X-Men&#39;s conscience to their renegade. When mutantkind settled on the living island of Krakoa, Kate was the one person unable to use its teleportation gates to enter the mutant utopia. The experience awoke a sense of rebellion in Kate, which only grew once her supposed ally Sebastian Shaw tried to murder her. Kate took a seat on Krakoa&#39;s ruling council and took the name Red Queen, maturing as a character after decades of being seen as the X-Men&#39;s junior member.

However, following 2023&#39;s Hellfire Gala massacre, Kate&#39;s maturity changed to corruption. After seeing her friends murdered in front of her, Kate killed several Orchis agents, using her powers without mercy. She then retrieved the swords given to her by her demonic mentor Ogun and became Shadowkat - hunting Orchis across the planet and becoming the wild card of the mutant rebellion. With the time jump of Rise of the Powers of X, it&#39;s clear that Shadowtiger represents the dark endpoint of Kate&#39;s choices. Speaking to AIPT, writer Kieron Gillen says:





In terms of specifically Kate - I wanted name X-Men in the dark future. Kate is a veteran of Dark Futures (sheâ€™s the original, in a real way) so showing someone who we know well and we know in a certain way in this OTHER way here says a lot. That Kate has been leaning grimmer across the Krakoan age made me think it was an interesting extension too.


Rise of the Powers of X sees the heroes trying to find a way to travel back in time and prevent their loss to Orchis, offering fans hope that this dark future can be overwritten. In that context, Shadowtiger is a dark warning about who Kate will become if the X-Men&#39;s final battle goes the wrong way. The Shadowtiger form completes Kate&#39;s transformation into a monster - a transformation motivated by heroism and trauma, but one which demands she sacrifice her humanity to become a better killer.



 There&#39;s Still Time for Kate Pryde to Avoid Her Fate 
Kate Has Grown Over the Past 5 Years, And She Can Keep That Progress Without a Downer Ending
          




The fact that Rise of the Powers of X shows the end result of Kate Pryde&#39;s obsession with vengeance in such a major way raises hopes that she can still avoid this fate, especially if the Orchis vs X-Men war can be rewritten. Kate&#39;s journey has been one of the most fascinating character arcs of the last few years of X-Men comics, but while it&#39;s fun to see who she&#39;d become if she sacrificed everything for more power, that isn&#39;t the end fans want for such a beloved character.

Shadowtiger reveals depths of Kate&#39;s powers that fans never suspected, with the confirmation that teleportation could be on the cards as she continues to experiment with her powers in future stories. However, on a personal level, this is a truly dark ending for Kate&#39;s story. Hopefully, the closing months of X-Men&#39;s Krakoan Era can give Kate Pryde back her hope, and she can avoid following the trail blazed by Apocalypse - that of mutant survival at any cost, and with no regard for morality.




Rise of the Powers of X #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
