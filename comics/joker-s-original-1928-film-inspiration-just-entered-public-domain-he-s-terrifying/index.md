## Literature Review

As 1928&#39;s The Man Who Laughs enters public domain, comic fans just gained ownership of the movie character who inspired Batman&#39;s nemesis the Joker.




As 2024 dawns, a range of classic pop culture just entered the public domain, including the character who inspired Batman&#39;s nemesis the Joker. While fans are currently celebrating 1928&#39;s Steamboat Willie entering public domain and making it possible to create new works with at least an early version of Mickey Mouse, another treasure from the same year also made the leap - the German Expressionist film The Man Who Laughs, and its eerie protagonist Gwynplaine.




While The Man Who Laughs is a well-regarded film (based on Victor Hugo&#39;s 1869 movie of the same name), the most lasting element of its legacy is inspiring DC Comics&#39; Joker. Created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane and Jerry Robinson, many elements of Joker&#39;s creation are contested, but each agreed the idea began with an image of Gwynplaine from the movie.

          

DC has never been shy about honoring The Man Who Laughs - for example, Ed Brubaker and Doug Mahnke&#39;s Batman: The Man Who Laughs (the canonical first meeting between the two) homages the film&#39;s title, while an evil version of Batman who acts like the Joker is known as &#39;the Batman Who Laughs.&#39; Other references have peppered Batman stories since Joker&#39;s first appearance in 1940&#39;s Batman #1.






In The Man Who Laughs, Gwynplaine is played by Conrad Veidt, who is also known for his roles in the iconic The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Casablanca.




                  2023 Upgraded Joker Like Never Before - Across ALL DC Media   The Joker is a character who has made an appearance in almost every single Batman property, and DC gave him a multimedia upgrade this year.   


 You Officially Own Gwynplaine - What Can You Do With Joker&#39;s Inspiration? 
Joker Fans Can Use His Inspiration in Their Own For-Profit Works
          

As a work enters public domain, copyright restrictions on its use are lifted, and the intellectual property is considered open to public use, available to anyone (in America, this occurs 95 years after the publication of the original work, but this varies elsewhere in the world). That generally means creators are free to use the work, its characters, and its ideas in their own fiction without seeking any kind of permission, even in cases where they want to use those elements for profit. In short, The Man Who Laugh&#39;s Gwynplaine just joined the list of characters like Sherlock Holmes and Dracula who can be used by anyone. The intent behind the law is theoretically that all works eventually default to public ownership after their creators have had ample opportunity to profit from them, though there can be complications.




The main complication creators encounter is that this lifting of restrictions often applies to a specific work, but may not apply to later works or trademarks which put a unique spin on it. For example, the classic literary character Frankenstein is public domain, but anyone using elements specific to Universal&#39;s take on the character - the green skin, flat head, and neck bolts - could still find themselves dragged to court, as the movies which introduced those features aren&#39;t yet in the public domain and are seen as having added their own protected elements. Thankfully, The Man Who Laughs doesn&#39;t have this level of iterative legacy, making its move into the public domain more cut and dry.



 Joker&#39;s Inspiration Is No Supervillain 
Gwynplaine Would Be Terrified of the Characters He Inspired
          

While the Joker may be one of the most despicable and unsettling villains in pop culture - having skinned one of his own henchmen, poisoned a cub scout troop, and murdered the second Robin Jason Todd in DC canon - his cinematic inspiration is far more of a misunderstood hero. The son of an exiled nobleman, Gwynplaine is disfigured as a child by a sadistic surgeon, with The Man Who Laughs essentially following his quest to live happily with his childhood sweetheart. Gwynplaine may appear terrifying thanks to the film&#39;s terrific makeup, but he&#39;s a tragic figure who&#39;s a million miles away from the Joker. At least, that&#39;s true in the original movie - now that fans are free to create their own stories starring Joker&#39;s inspiration, there&#39;s no telling who Gwynplaine might become.




Interestingly, Gwynplaine didn&#39;t only inspire the Joker in DC lore - the French supervillain known as Man Who Laughs (aka Norman Rotrig) hews even closer to Gwynplaine&#39;s story, including a carved grin forced on him by his artist father. A little-seen presence in Batman comics, it&#39;s possible that DC may want to do more with the character now that the original The Man Who Laughs has entered the public domain - and it&#39;s just as possible that Joker may finally meet his inspiration face-to-face (in the same way that Batman has worked with Sherlock Holmes on multiple occasions.)
