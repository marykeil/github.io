## Literature Review

Takahashi Yoichi, the man behind the Captain Tsubasa series, will be ending his career on the legendary soccer franchise after 43 years of work.




The author of Captain Tsubasa, Takahashi Yoichi, has announced his retirement as an artist. The immediate consequence of this will be the conclusion of his two ongoing manga, which will end this April. Yoichi cited health reasons for his decision to retire but also gave fans some assurance about the series&#39; future by laying the groundwork for one more arc.




Captain Tsubasa has been a landmark of the anime and manga landscape, and one of the fathers of the sports genre. After more than 40 years of existence for the franchise in the form of one manga or anime or another, it is perhaps not surprising that Takahashi will be stepping down starting in April, considering how demanding the job of a mangaka is.


 

Early revelations of the retirement came from a post on the X account Manga Mogura RE. However, drafts for a final &#34;World Cup&#34; arc will allow other creators to follow up on the story following the author&#39;s retirement.

 Captain Tsubasa&#39;s Final Two Manga Will Conclude in April 
         

Besides the announced retirement, the post also noted that Takahashi&#39;s two current Captain Tsubasa manga, Captain Tsubasa - Rising Sun and Captain Tsubasa - Memories, will conclude in April, in issue #20 of the Captain Tsubasa Magazine, which will also be the final issue of the magazine. Takahashi does say he is considering writing a draft for the &#34;World Cup&#34; arc that would have followed, so even if he steps back from his franchise, it is still possible for him to lay out his final vision.

Purported translations of Takahashi&#39;s message in Captain Tsubasa Magazine&#39;s issue #19 posted online by the X account Captain Tsubasa Perfect Shots (@CTsubasaShots) claim that his physical condition is beginning to degrade his work. The message also remarked that the industry&#39;s move towards digital art is making it difficult to adapt. Even though he envisioned a &#34;Next Dream&#34; arc, the author admitted putting all his vision on paper could take decades more, which he might not have. Hence, while he is still in relatively good condition, Takahashi chose to end his manga rather than try to force it forward amid slowing output.





 

Captain Tsubasa first went into print in 1981. It follows the soccer career of Japanese prodigy Tsubasa Oozora through the original 7-year run, the various one-shot stories, and the Rising Sun series that began in 2013. The Captain Tsubasa anime played a significant role in popularizing anime worldwide at an early stage, due to being broadcast in many Western countries. While Takahashi&#39;s retirement is a surprising way of starting 2024, it is unlikely that Tsubasa as a sports and manga icon will disappear any time soon. Hopefully, Takahashi will take on a similar role as Akira Toriyama overseeing the new Dragon Ball DAIMA, and he will still be involved in future Captain Tsubasa projects.
