## SUMMARY

The retcon to Nightcrawler&#39;s origin adds depth to his and his mothers&#39; histories, incorporating trans and queer representation directly into their storyline, after years of having it obliquely hinted at by various creators, including legendary X-scribe Chris Claremont, who originated the idea.   This important revelation in X-Men history makes the comics more meaningful to marginalized people and sets the stage for future stories for Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Destiny.

## Literature Review

One of Marvel’s most mysterious family trees is rooted in Nightcrawler’s lineage. Destiny and Mystique’s true connection to him took decades to arrive




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for X-Men Blue: Origins #1!Nightcrawler&#39;s origin undergone its most significant retcon yet, finally introducing a plot development that has been fought for over the course of decades. After several unsatisfactory attempts at the story behind Kurt Wagner&#39;s birth, Marvel has confirmed the truth: Mystique and Destiny are Nightcrawler&#39;s biological parents. The definitive answer is new, but its roots stretch all the way back to Chris Claremont&#39;s tenure as X-Men franchise&#39;s principal architect.




X-Men Blue: Origins #1 – written by Si Spurrier, with art by Wilton Santos – makes Nightcrawler&#39;s parentage canon, many years after it was first suggested. In a touching expression of their love, Mystique used her mutant gift to impregnate her wife Destiny, and even mimicked Destiny&#39;s baby bump, so that they could share the feeling of carrying their son into the world.

         

Due to the pain of not being able to raise Kurt, Irene and Raven had their memories altered to help them cope. In a sense, both Nightcrawler and his bio-mothers have been waiting just as long as X-Men fans have for the truth to come to light.

                  Nightcrawler&#39;s New Origin Reveals a Heartbreaking Secret About His Mother, Mystique   A preview for X-Men Blue: Origins reveals a heartbreaking truth about Nightcrawler&#39;s birth, that his mother Raven did have genuine love for him.   





 After 40 Years, Nightcrawler&#39;s Origin Is Finally Realized 
Chris Claremont&#39;s Groundbreaking Idea Was Way Ahead Of Its Time
          

After the huge success of the Giant Size X-Men relaunch, writer Chris Claremont, in collaboration with artists such as John Byrne and Jim Lee, spent sixteen years making the X-Men into the iconic franchise it&#39;s known as today. However, not all of Claremont&#39;s hopes for these characters made it to the page. In particular, frequent antagonists Mystique and Destiny were continually coded as a lesbian couple, despite Claremont never being able to confirm this within the text. Raven and Irene&#39;s status as romantic partners was canonized years later, well into the Krakoan era, and now the era&#39;s closing chapters have broadened their relationship further, giving them the child they were long denied.

Chris Claremont introduced a mysterious familial connection between Nightcrawler and Mystique when the two first met in 1981&#39;s Uncanny X-Men #142. His intended origin was that Raven fathered Kurt with Irene, meaning the idea has been in the air at Marvel Comics for over forty years. Other historic Marvel creators, such as Scott Lobdell and John Byrne, have both attested to Claremont pushing for this reveal at the height of his power in the X-Office. Even after his tenure, Claremont implied that his intended origin could be retconned in current continuity as recently as his contribution to Marvel Comics Presents #5 in 2019.






 Mystique And Destiny Are Finally Who They&#39;re Meant To Be 
Trans and Queer Representation Are Finally Integral to Nightcrawler&#39;s Origin
          

More important than any one creator&#39;s vision being canonized, this retcon to Kurt Wagner&#39;s origin adds so much to his as well as his mothers&#39; histories and opens up so much potential for future stories. Now, Marvel&#39;s most iconic queer couple have also added a rich aspect of trans/non-binary life to their love story in a beautiful way. More than forty long years since it was dreamt up, this vital part of X-Men history makes these comics more meaningful to marginalized people, which has always been at the heart of mutantkind&#39;s success. Now fans can eagerly await what comes next for Nightcrawler, Destiny, and Mystique, now that Marvel has actualized their backstory in a definitive way.

X-Men Blue: Origins #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
