## Literature Review

Spider-Gwen has teamed up with her own Marvel universe variants in a group cosplay showing how fun a Spider-Woman/Ghost Spider collective could be.




A Spider-Gwen cosplay has brought together many of the heroine&#39;s variants from across the multiverse. Known by many names, including Spider-Woman, Gwen has quickly become a fan-favorite since her 2015 debut. The Spider-Verse has shown the wide range of spider heroes in Marvel&#39;s comic universe, and a group of Gwens would be an impressive gathering.




On Instagram, Bianca Bella (@biancabellacosplay) shared photos of several Spider-Gwen cosplayers altogether. This cosplay gathering features various Gwen suits inspired by Marvel Comics, as well as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023). No matter if she goes by Ghost Spider, Spider-Gwen, or Spider-Woman, Gwen Stacy has managed to steal the show.


 

Collectively, this team-up mirrors one of Marvel&#39;s newest comics while also pushing for the multiversal crossover fans would love to see come off the page. It isn&#39;t unheard of for a Marvel hero to interact with variants of themselves. However, a Gwen Stacy team-up has yet to be seen outside comics.

Bianca Bella has done several Spider-Gwen cosplays with varying suit designs, including a blend with Carnage. This team-up cosplay featuring Spider-Gwen and her fellow heroines captures the potential of Marvel&#39;s universe when it comes to variants. It also highlights the popularity the character has garnered in this role in a rather short amount of time. Unlike her counterpart, Peter Parker, Gwen has had a limited time to show off her super skills. Spending most of her early comic history primarily as a love interest for Spider-Man, she has finally proven herself as a multi-faceted character who can save the day on her own.


 



 Spider-Gwen&#39;s Ultimate Team-Up Would Bring the Spider-Women Together 

 




This group of astounding Spider-Gwen cosplayers have successfully shown a sample of what a Ghost Spider team-up could look like. This concept has been explored recently in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Gwen: Gwenverse (2022), which saw the heroine meeting up with variants of herself. This series featured her alternate selves who underwent different life changes, taking up the mantles of Thor, Wolverine, and other Marvel heroes. With so much potential thanks to the existence of variants in Marvel&#39;s comic universe, it&#39;s no wonder fans are able to produce such creative and fun team-up cosplay opportunities.

Comic series featuring Spider-Gwen are available from Marvel Comics.
