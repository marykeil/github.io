# It s Time for Galactus  Venom Form to Return (Fulfilling a Broken Promise from the  90s)


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel should follow up on Galactus-Venom, a combination of the two iconic villains that it teased back in 1992.   Venom, as well as Galactus, have become more heroic characters over the years, evolving away from their antagonistic origins. Combining the two would be a great way to further their respective journies while fulfilling the promise of Galactus-Venom.   Galactus-Venom could be the only one capable of stopping the dangerous and powerful god-level Carnage, making his resurrection crucial for the sake of salvation.

## Literature Review

Marvel once teased Galactus-Venom in the early 1990s; decades later, they have the perfect opportunity to make this iconic pairing a reality.




An issue of Web of Spider-Man from the 1990s once teased a version of Galactus that had bonded with the Venom symbiote – while this turned out to be a trick, conjured by perennial Spidey villain mysterio to startle the Webslinger, the apparition of Galactus-Venom provides a tantalizing prospect for Marvel fans, one the company should follow up on.




Web of Spider-Man #90 – written by Howard Mackie, with art by Alex Saviuk – features an array of holographic representations of Spider-Man baddies, but the stand-out is Galactus-Venom, a towering version of Galactus, one of Marvel&#39;s earliest and most enduring cosmic threats.

          

The appearance of such a great synthesis of two iconic character concepts is more than a tease; it is akin to a promise, as though Marvel is saying, &#34;we are aware this is awesome, but now is not the time to explore it.&#34; Over thirty years later, Marvel should fulfill that promise – and a recent ongoing storyline could prove the perfect way to do it.


 Galactus Is Due To Become A Major Player Once More 
         




Marvel&#39;s concentrated effort to introduce new, increasingly more powerful cosmic characters comes at a time when Galactus is dead, having been killed by Thor. If and when the character makes his return, it will be to a drastically different Marvel cosmology – one more crowded with dangerous deities and god-level enemies than ever before. Accordingly, he will need to be brought back in a unique, interesting way, with some measure of distinction from his previous incarnations. Similarly, Venom has lately been supplanted by Carnage as the foremost symbiote in the Marvel Universe. The key to both characters&#39; return to prominence is Galactus-Venom, first glimpsed in Web of Spider-Man #90.

Venom&#39;s shift from villain, to anti-hero, to full-on hero has only continued to accelerate in recent years – and prior to the death of Earth-616 Galactus, the character had ceased to be a purely villainous character as well, having been given a more heroic turn. While the original Galactus-Venom hologram projected by Mysterio in Web of Spider-Man #90 appeared as a threat to Spider-Man, and was obviously being used to villainous ends, the current state of both individual characters offers an exciting alternative. Marvel could potentially introduce Galactus-Venom as a hero, in a further evolution of their respective separate redemption arcs.






 Galactus-Venom Could Be The Only One Who Can Stop God-Carnage 
          

The last several years have seen Carnage – Venom&#39;s truly unhinged offspring – on a quest through the Multiverse, seeking to become a god. Recent events have only brought Carnage closer to achieving cosmic power. Already one of the most dangerous beings in the Marvel Universe, his ascension to deity-level would result in unimaginable devastation and trauma. A cosmic character on the level of Galactus, the World-Eater, would be needed to combat god-Carnage – while Venom would be the perfect foil for Carnage&#39;s ambitions. Resurrecting Galactus and giving him an off-shoot of the Venom symbiote could be Marvel&#39;s best hope of salvation.
