## Literature Review

The Far Side&#39;s Gary Larson has a truly unique sense of humor - with each of these 15 comics embodying one of his funniest obsessions.




Gary Larson&#39;s The Far Side has more than earned its place as the ultimate newspaper gag strip. From comics parodying iconic movies to strips detailing the unseen lives of insects and fish, there&#39;s a Larson comic for every subject and occasion. However, there&#39;s a difference between the average Far Side entry and those which perfectly capture the soul of the franchise.
Here, then, are 15 comics which perfectly capture Gary Larson&#39;s favorite settings, recurring characters, and inimitable sense of humor. From cows to cavemen, science to slapstick, these are the comics that any Far Side fan would immediately identify as the result of Larson&#39;s trademark humor - as well as some of his best of all time. Stick around to the end of the article for our reader poll on which of these comics is really the funniest.









 








 15  &#34;Car!&#34; 
It Isn&#39;t The Far Side Without Larson&#39;s Cows

        

While Gary Larson long avoided specific recurring characters, he does have archetypal subjects who come back again and again - none more recognizable to Far Side fans than the humble cow. This comic combines Larson&#39;s bovine muse with his favorite concept - animals secretly acting like humans. There&#39;s even a hint of The Far Side&#39;s barely perceptible air of menace - after all, why are the cows having secret meetings they don&#39;t want humans to see? Larson explained his obsession with cows to The New York Times, saying he uses the animals so often because:
I&#39;ve always thought the word cow was funny, and cows are sort of tragic figures. Cows blur the line between tragedy and humor.





 14  Roy Dooms the Earth 
First Contact Is Classic Far Side Fodder

        

While they can&#39;t compare to Larson&#39;s cows, aliens often appear in The Far Side, usually as agents of planetary destruction. The Far Side is special because its best jokes leave space for the reader to complete the joke - many other newspaper comics wouldn&#39;t be able to help explaining why Roy felt the need to grab an alien&#39;s head, but Larson completes the joke in the reader&#39;s head rather than on the page.





 13  Witch Babysitter 
Larson Stands by This Controversial Comic

        

While The Far Side is seen as family fare, it has a morbid streak a mile wide, and plays with the idea of harm coming to children and/or animals surprisingly often. These are the strips that generated most controversy, with Larson admitting that he can understand the hate resulting from some of his darkest work. However, in The Pre-History of The Far Side he names this strip &#34;one of my personal favorites,&#34; explaining that it&#39;s so patently ludicrous he fails to see how someone could take genuine offense. Larson also notes the detail that makes him love this strip&#39;s humor even today - &#34;they&#39;re especially upset that the witch ate both their kids - as if to suggest one would have been pretty bad, but both is really unacceptable.&#34;





 12  Pinocchio Gets His Wish 
Far Side Has a Major Grudge Against the Little Wooden Boy


 







Pinocchio may seem like an unusual target for Gary Larson to fixate on, but the little wooden boy gets brutalized more often than any other figure in The Far Side history. The idea of a puppet suddenly turning into flesh and blood is tailor-made for Larson&#39;s humor - it&#39;s a set-up that introduces a change in the situation&#39;s &#39;rules&#39; that everyone instantly recognizes, allowing Larson the space to build on that juxtaposition rather than needing to create it. Scratched by cats, savaged by beavers, and attacked by woodpeckers, it&#39;s Pinocchio&#39;s safari that nails Larson&#39;s repeated gag the best. However, of the many times Gary Larson took on Disney, drowning Jiminy Cricket is undoubtedly the darkest.

 11  Cro-Magnon vs Neanderthal 
Far Side&#39;s Cavepeople Are as Ubiquitous as Its Cows

        

Larson often credits his readers with some knowledge of the natural world, and this Neanderthal/Cro-Magnon rivalry is an example of his respect for his fans&#39; intelligence. Larson&#39;s minimalist faces are worth a thousand words - from the Cro-Magnon&#39;s smarmy smile to Theena&#39;s glee to Thak&#39;s intense concentration - while a cave painting in the place of wall art is a painfully smart detail that doesn&#39;t feel the need to draw attention. Next to cows, cavepeople are The Far Side&#39;s biggest recurring stars, and this strip makes it clear why.





 10  His Collie, Shep 
Larson Pushes the Boundaries of What a Single Image Can Do

        

Again, Larson tells a story that begins on the page and ends in the reader&#39;s head, however the defining detail here is setting the story within the boundaries of Farmer MacDougal&#39;s binoculars. A less talented cartoonist could tell the same joke with a similar image of Shep chatting with the wolves, but by witnessing this moment through the eyes of an unseen character, suddenly the &#39;story&#39; takes on a whole new layer of characterization, and the actual image becomes an integral moment in MacDougal&#39;s realization. Typically using only a single panel, The Far Side is a masterclass in using different elements to expand the information on offer - Larson loads the foreground and background with extra context wherever possible, or in this case makes even the perspective part of the joke.





 9  Thagomizer 
Larson&#39;s Made-Up Term Is Now Scientific Reality

        

Because of the insight and appreciation for nature that infuses his work, Larson is beloved by scientists the world over - to the point he&#39;s had multiple species of insect named in his honor. Larson paid his science-loving readers back for their support by accidentally gifting them a new term, with the spikes on a stegosaurus&#39; tail now officially known as the &#39;Thagomizer&#39; because of this comic. A large fandom among scientists plus the lack of an existing term for the feature led to the term being adopted, although of course the conceptual joke at the heart of the comic is what really makes it something fans would want to reference.





 8  &#34;Does Someone Have a Hammer?&#34; 
Larson&#39;s Slapstick Shouldn&#39;t Be Ignored

        

Easily the least famous comic on this list, this scene from an unfortunate dinner showcases an aspect of Larson&#39;s humor that can&#39;t be ignored - pure slapstick. While Larson is the master of the surreal situation and amusing animal gag, The Far Side also indulges in Tom and Jerry-style slapstick violence that warps the human (or animal) body past all limits. However, the woman with her head trapped in her glass is the best of the bunch - both because of how outright funny the visual is and the calm, collected, almost certainly unearned confidence of the helpful diner who has apparently seen this situation several times before.

 7  &#34;You&#39;ve Met Someone Else?&#34; 
Far Side Made the Desert Island Comic Famous


 







Gary Larson didn&#39;t invent the cartoon desert island, but the concept has nevertheless become synonymous with his comics. All Larson&#39;s Far Side comics take place in a microcosmic universe; a single moment in a single location that tells the whole story. The desert island boils that truth down to its essence, trapping the characters in the one place where they&#39;ll ever really &#39;exist.&#39;
While it&#39;s too hard to choose Larson&#39;s best desert island comic, &#39;You&#39;ve Met Someone Else?&#39; is up there - not just because the aggrieved man has somehow failed to notice his partner straying, but because of the genius detail that he never actually bothered to learn the name of the one other man on the island.





 6  The Cartoon Symbol for Glass 
The Far Side Has No Respect for the Fourth Wall


 







The Far Side plays with its own form and &#39;rules&#39; constantly, always using a single panel to explore the unseen past or future of a situation. However, Larson takes this further with multiple comics that break the fourth wall. In the first strip, above, Larson even makes himself the villain of the piece, as two explorers find themselves thwarted by &#34;the international cartoon symbol for glass.&#34; While the strip where a boss reads his employee&#39;s thought balloon may be funnier, Larson&#39;s fondness for jungle explorers wandering into trouble makes this initial strip the most faithful to his recurring themes.





 5  Professor Schnabel&#39;s Cleaning Lady 
This Famous Far Side Comic Deserves the Hype

        

One of The Far Side&#39;s most famous comics, the misadventures of Professor Schnabel&#39;s cleaning lady utilizes several Larsonisms - from the name of the unseen professor to the inclusion of dinosaurs as humans&#39; natural predators, to the presence of his trademark beehive-haired woman. The comic also showcases Larson&#39;s perfect sense of framing - a nonplussed T-Rex, angry diplodocus and disinterested pteradon make it clear that the human star is totally surrounded. The comic also brings in The Far Side&#39;s dark side, making it clear that this comic can only end in a grisly death.

 4  &#34;So, Professor Jenkins!&#34; 
Gary Larson Imagined Some Truly Evil Ducks


 







A return to the Far Side desert island may seem like cheating, but the focus of this entry is actually Larson&#39;s preoccupation with evil ducks. Ducks star in some of the hands-down best Far Side comics - and &#39;Anatidaephobia&#39; is a legitimate classic - however the combination of a mean-spirited mallard, a down-on-his-luck scientist, and two characters marooned on a desert island means poor Professor Jenkins is the obvious choice here.





 3  Missile Prank 
Larson&#39;s Best Comics Barely Need Words

        

Larson has plenty of comics which show scientists playing pranks on each other, but this one reigns supreme because of its mastery of physical comedy, as well as the pairing of twin &#39;bangs&#39; which are likely to play out at very different scales. If there&#39;s a criticism to be made of this near-perfect single-panel comic, it&#39;s that readers could probably have been trusted to get the gag without the giant word &#39;MISSILE&#39; printed across the weapon in question.





 2  &#34;Anyone See What Happened?&#34; 
Larson&#39;s Chickens Are Perpetual Victims


 







Chickens tend to do badly in The Far Side, but only as a reflection of their often disappointing lot in real life. Inherently undignified, Larson likes to put the humble chickens in loser situations, though like any of his animals, there are strips where they win out over humanity. One rare &#39;draw&#39; sees a sheriff step into the middle of a cowboy vs chicken shootout, asking if anyone saw what happened. The gag shows Larson&#39;s deep understanding of his own skill at telling a story - he couldn&#39;t have made it any clearer what just happened, which makes the sheriff&#39;s confusion even funnier than the surreal &#39;fight.&#39;





 1  The Penguin 
Larson&#39;s Purest Comic Is a Masterclass

        

Perhaps the perfect Far Side comic, this strip is an obvious, immediate gag that only gets more satisfying with time. Drawing on a classic pratfall laugh, the comic also has fun with the visual idea of a penguin somehow missing a banana skin laid out on a vast expanse of snow. Larson frames the moment perfectly - with distance making it more feel more ludicrous - and gets the most out of his minimal art style, as the penguin&#39;s vaguely furrowed brow invites the reader to imagine its reaction.
Fascinated with animals and characterized by a surreal whimsy and a dark preoccupation with unseen consequences, The Far Side&#39;s best comics remain as funny today as when they were created - precisely because they so perfectly communicate Gary Larson&#39;s unique sense of humor.
