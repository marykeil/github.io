DC unveils the return of one of Green Arrow&#39;s most murderous adversaries, a character who has long held a cryptic vendetta against the Arrow-Family.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Green Arrow #7!




Amanda Waller isn&#39;t the sole threat looming over Green Arrow and his family as another infamous DC villain makes their foreboding return. The true extent of this villain&#39;s threat level remains uncertain, considering the Arrow family is still unaware of their resurgence. But it&#39;s only merely a matter of time until this villain reveals themselves; the only lingering uncertainty is the level of bloodshed that will accompany their return announcement.

Green Arrow #7, by Joshua Williamson, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Trevor Hairsine, kicks off with Green Arrow&#39;s return to Earth-0 after being lost in time and space. However, Oliver Queen is not the only familiar face making a comeback; the issue unveils the return of the notorious and murderous Onomatopoeia. 



          




Known for his deranged penchant for targeting non-powered vigilante superheroes, Onomatopoeia earned his name by mimicking surrounding noises, from gunshots to explosions and even the chilling sounds of dripping blood. As one of Green Arrow&#39;s most unhinged adversaries, the return of Onomatopoeia promises a thrilling and explosive resurgence that will no doubt come with a BANG!

For devoted fans of Green Arrow and his son, Connor Hawke, the resurgence of the sound-making villain is bound to evoke memories of the trio&#39;s tumultuous history. Connor holds a significant place in Onomatopoeia&#39;s list of targets, having been shot by the deranged villain. Oliver managed to save Connor. However, the threat persisted as Onomatopoeia returned to the hospital where Connor was being operated on, aiming to finish the job. Queen and Black Canary thwarted the attack, but the elusive villain managed to escape. Now, with the ominous return of Onomatopoeia, it seems that the haunting specter of unfinished business and impending danger hangs once again over Green Arrow and his son.




Onomatopoeia&#39;s reappearance introduces a captivating element to Green Arrow&#39;s storyline, particularly as Amanda Waller has been firmly established as the central antagonist in Oliver&#39;s narrative. With Waller recently capturing Roy Harper and Oliver expressing his belief that there&#39;s more to her agenda, saying, &#34;She&#39;s always hated us, but there&#39;s something more going on here,&#34; the plot thickens. The arrival of Onomatopoeia raises intriguing questions about his role in the narrative, inviting speculation about potential connections to Waller or whether he operates independently. The series is quickly becoming more complex and intriguing as the story progresses. Hence, it&#39;s no wonder that the Green Arrow series got extended.
