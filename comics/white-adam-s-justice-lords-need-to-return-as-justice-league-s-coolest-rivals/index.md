# White Adam s Justice Lords Need to Return as Justice League s Coolest Rivals


## SUMMARY 



  The Justice Lords, an alternate version of the Justice League, could still pose a threat to the DC Universe; or the reformed version, under White Adam, could be a cooler heroic alternative to the traditional League, who are currently disbanded.   While White Adam has taken over control and the threat of Lord Superman is seemingly gone, there is potential for the Justice Lords to return as either heroes or antagonists.   Lord Superman and Jax-Ur are shown plotting their escape from the Phantom Zone, in the last appearance of the Justice Lords&#39; universe, leaving the possibility open for them to attack the world again in the future.

## Literature Review

White Adam&#39;s Justice Lords, from Justice League Beyond 2.0, are overdue for a return, as they&#39;re one of DC&#39;s coolest alternates to the League. 




The DC Multiverse is vast, and full of countless variations on classic characters – and lately, it seems that DC has been eager to explore that Multiverse more than ever before. One universe that deserves more of a spotlight is the one where the Justice League turned into the Justice Lords.




Justice League Beyond 2.0 #24 – by Christos Gage, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Saida Temofonte – concluded the original Justice Lords story, when, after Justice Lord Superman goes on a rampage, the Justice League teams up with White Adam to bring him down.

          

With Lord Superman defeated and banished to the Phantom Zone, where he teamed up with Jax-Ur, White Adam became leader of the Justice Lords team, promising to help the world move on from the chaos and destruction that Lord Superman had caused. This is the last time readers have visited this universe, but there&#39;s no reason it can&#39;t make a return.

                  Why DC&#39;s Justice Lords Are the Best &#39;Evil Justice League&#39;   The Justice League have faced many evil versions of themselves over the years but only one team is their true evil opposites.   





 The Justice Lords Could Still Pose A Threat To The DCU 
         

The Justice Lords are one of the most dangerous alternate versions of the Justice League. Evil Justice Leagues aren&#39;t unheard of in the Multiverse; for example, the Crime Syndicate are a major evil version of the League. The key difference between the two is that the Crime Syndicate are the Justice League&#39;s opposites. They are everything the Justice League is not. This isn&#39;t true of the Justice Lords. The Lords were originally just like the League, before one misstep corrupted them. After Lex Luthor killed the Flash, Superman responded by killing Lex Luthor. This set the Justice Lords down a dark path where they took control of their Earth by force.

Since White Adam took over control of the Justice Lords, readers haven&#39;t seen that universe again. While the threat of Lord Superman seems to be gone, this doesn&#39;t need to be the end of the story. Recently, DC has seemingly committed to exploring their Multiverse like never before. Jon Kent ended up in the Injustice universe and tried to change events there. Meanwhile, Batman and Superman are currently in the Kingdom Come Universe and fighting against Gog and Magog. There&#39;s no reason why the Justice Lords couldn&#39;t return – either as heroes, under White Adam&#39;s vigilant direction, or perhaps as antagonists once more.






 Lord Superman Plots His Return With Jax-Ur 
          

While the threat of Lord Superman seems to be over, the comic leaves the door open by showing Superman and Jax-Ur plotting their escape from the Phantom Zone. Alternate versions of Jax-Ur have managed to escape in the past, so the idea that they might escape and attack the world again is far from unreasonable. DC has been exploring the multiverse more than ever and there are tons of stories left to tell. Lord Superman and Jax-Ur have not yet had the opportunity to make their return, but there&#39;s no reason why the Justice League can&#39;t end up in another battle against Lord Superman one day.
