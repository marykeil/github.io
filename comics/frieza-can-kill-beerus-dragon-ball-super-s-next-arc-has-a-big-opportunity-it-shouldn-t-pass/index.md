## Literature Review

After unlocking Black Frieza, the beloved Dragon Ball villain can shake up the Dragon Ball Super story by ending the God of Destruction Beerus.




Frieza has achieved a monstrous new level of strength that might be enough to kill Beerus, changing Dragon Ball Super forever. New power-ups have raised the stakes recently in the manga with Gohan&#39;s Beast Transformation and Orange Piccolo. However, before Dragon Ball Super&#39;s manga adapted the Super Hero movie story, Black Frieza made a grand entrance and easily defeated Goku and Vegeta. If Frieza learns of Beerus&#39;s secret weakness he could kill the God of Destruction and sow chaos across the universe like never before.




Despite Goku and Vegeta attaining and showing off impressive new forms in the Dragon Ball Super manga, Frieza easily defeated them both with a single blow at the end of the Granolah arc. As the former main antagonist of DBZ continues to grow his power level and influence across the universe, his next evil plot continues to be a mystery. Still, by killing Beerus, Frieza would quickly upset the balance of the Dragon Ball universe.

          

Not many Dragon Ball characters know that the secret to easily killing Beerus is to destroy the (much weaker) Supreme Kai, as their lives are connected. While Goku and Vegeta wouldn&#39;t resort to such a tactic to overcome the Destroyer God, Frieza of course would not mind at all. From what audiences know of the Galactic Emperor, if Frieza learned this information, he&#39;d likely use his new powers and wits to topple the God of Destruction, who&#39;d had Frieza under his thumb for years.





 Frieza Loves Chaos, And Killing Beerus Would Cause A Lot Of It 
          

When Beerus was introduced in Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, it was revealed that Frieza destroyed Goku and Vegeta&#39;s homeworld on Beerus&#39;s orders. It&#39;s unclear how long Frieza and his father, King Cold, had been directly working under the Destroyer God. From what fans know of Frieza, he does not like to take orders from anyone other than himself. Still, the large gap between Frieza and Beerus&#39;s power kept Frieza in line. Now that Frieza has found a way to get even stronger with his Black Frieza form, his quest for total domination of the universe would require the eventual removal of Beerus, something Dragon Ball Super&#39;s next arcs would greatly benefit from.

                  &#34;Not The Senzu Bean The Film Was&#34; - Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Super Hero Manga Review   The Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero manga&#39;s adaptation fails to hit the dynamic and emotional beats of the film or flesh out the story meaningfully.   




Before the universe&#39;s God of Destruction met Goku, Frieza seemed to be the perfect candidate to take Beerus&#39;s job if he was ever to retire. Frieza was tasked with destroying Planet Vegeta, so it&#39;s likely that many other planets were destroyed under the lazy Destroyer God&#39;s orders long before the events of Dragon Ball played out. However, after learning that the Gods of Destruction can be replaced and even surpassed in strength during the Tournament of Power, Frieza&#39;s secret evil plan may lead to toppling the Gods themselves. Such a development would dramatically shake up the Dragon Ball Super storyline, and that&#39;s exactly what the manga needs after the long and criticized adaptation of the Super Hero movie.



 Beerus&#39;s Presence Means Frieza Will Never Rule Completely 
          

At this point in Dragon Ball Super&#39;s story, it&#39;s unclear what Frieza hopes to accomplish with his newfound power. The space tyrant may be aiming to one day become Universe 7&#39;s new God of Destruction or perhaps Frieza&#39;s true goal may be something even more disruptive, like a multiversal civil war. Still, with Frieza&#39;s dramatic power-up and surprising sparing of Goku and Vegeta, Dragon Ball Super has clearly something exciting in mind for Frieza&#39;s character in future arcs. By removing Beerus from the equation, Frieza would easily become one of the series most feared villains once again.
