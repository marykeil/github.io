## Literature Review

Best friends forever, Snoopy and Woodstock have warmed the hearts of Peanuts fans for decades thanks to their loyal and loving friendship.





The two are forever associated with one another. Their friendship would become one of the most enduring in popular culture and also be one of the most profitable, inspiring merchandise that included figurines, stuffed animals, mugs, and basically anything else that could fit an image of Snoopy and Woodstock. Here are the most heartwarming comics that perfectly sum up their friendship.









 








 10  Woodstock&#39;s First Appearance Arrives in &#34;Rough Flight&#34; 
        

Best friends, Snoopy and Woodstock frequently go to one another. It may be for advice or for some good companionship but in the case of this strip, it&#39;s for some reprieve after a long, rough journey. In the strip, Woodstock frantically flaps his wings and collapses onto Snoopy, falling asleep almost immediately. Snoopy can tell his buddy has had a rough trip and needs the rest, refusing to wake his pal up even if Snoopy isn&#39;t left in the most comfortable posltion to sleep.
It is established in Peanuts lore that Woodstock is not a very good flyer. In this strip, Woodstock has possibly been dealing with some flying difficulties and can not wait to get back on solid ground. It&#39;s heartwarming to see Woodstock come to Snoopy when he feels exhausted and to see Snoopy&#39;s reaction of sympathy and understanding.





 9  &#34;It&#39;s Just The Way He Tells It&#34; 
        

With Snoopy holding the distinction of being the only one to understand what Woodstock says, he has a front row seat to all Woodstock&#39;s stories. As this strip shows, Snoopy enjoys that position, as can be seen when he gets teared up by Woodstock&#39;s tale. Snoopy attributes the story getting an emotional response from him to Woodstock&#39;s exceptional storytelling abilities.
Since the audience as well as the Peanuts gang relies on Snoopy to translate everything Woodstock says, the strip makes it seem like everyone is missing out on not being able to hear what Woodstock has to say. Snoopy&#39;s reactions will have to be enough for now. In the meantime, it is clear that Snoopy will always be appreciative of Woodstock and his gift for telling a story.





 8  &#34;Worms&#34; 
        

Snoopy shows some sympathy for his tiny feathered friend in this strip, showing how much Snoopy cares for Woodstock. The strip also shows that Woodstock knows he can come running to Snoopy whenever he has a problem or is upset; a sign of true friendship.
Although worms are usually the prey of birds, in this strip, poor Woodstock is experiencing the opposite, getting picked on by some worms. It&#39;s in Woodstock&#39;s gentle nature to not instantly nosh on the mean spirited worms. On the bright side, Woodstock has a great friend to vent to when he&#39;s had a long day dealing with bullies.





 7  &#34;Beak Lotion&#34; 
        

A top-notch friend never wants to see their buddy go through any pain. As evidenced by this Peanuts strip, Snoopy is one such friend. In the strip, Snoopy looks out for his pal, Woodstock and doesn&#39;t want him to experience any painful beak burn. Consequently, Snoopy reminds his friend to put on some beak lotion.
Snoopy is not always the most sensitive companion, often making fun of people or being a bit detached from his own owner, Charlie Brown. One time when Charlie Brown was in the hospital, Snoopy didn&#39;t even care until he found out he wouldn&#39;t be getting any dinner. However, it seems to be different with Woodstock, whom Snoopy goes out of his way to help and care for, acting as a sort of big brother to the feathered character. This strip illustrates this perfectly.





 6  &#34;What Kind of Bird Are You?&#34; 
        

Longtime Peanuts fans knows its no secret that Snoopy has a bit of short fuse. For example, Snoopy once threw his dog bowl at Charlie Brown just because he made a lame joke when giving Snoopy his food. In this strip, Snoopy looks like he is losing his temper with Woodstock, trying to guess what kind of bird he is.
At his wits&#39; end, Snoopy gives up and claims that Woodstock is a duck, earning the bird&#39;s indignation and ire. However, unlike his relationship with Charlie Brown, Snoopy extends an olive branch and calms Woodstock down. Seeing Woodstock and Snoopy hug out their differences is always a sight to see and noteworthy coming from the hot headed pup.





 5  &#34;Tree&#34; 
        

A lazy dog, at odds with his Beagle breed, Snoopy enjoys his rest and relaxation as often as possible. For all the Peanuts gang, if Snoopy isn&#39;t in the mood to do something, he will not do it. Yet, Woodstock is an exception to this rule. Snoopy will do what it takes to make his friend happy.
In this strip, that means acting like a tree so that Woodstock has a comfortable place to put his nest and sleep. Acting like a tree would not be Snoopy&#39;s first choice of how to spend a day, or his mother&#39;s, but he does it for his buddy. By the looks of this strip, it&#39;s clear that Snoopy spoils Woodstock just a bit but seeing the two pals be there for each other is a heartwarming sight worth seeing.





 4  &#34;Mating Dance&#34; 
        

Snoopy tries to give Woodstock some pointers for a girl he likes in this Peanuts strip. Snoopy&#39;s method of wooing is dancing, but upon seeing Woodstock&#39;s version, he tries to let his friend down easy by suggesting a simple call to the girl of interest. Woodstock has his talents, but dancing is not one of them.
It&#39;s adorable to see Snoopy trying to give his friend dating advice and Woodstock eagerly listening and taking notes. Optimistic, Snoopy is up to the challenge to get Woodstock ready for the girl who has captured his heart, even if the first move seems like it will not be successful.





 3  &#34;Snoopy&#39;s Secretary&#34; 
        

A best friend and a confidant, Woodstock is also apparently Snoopy&#39;s secretary as seen in this strip. When snow interferes with Woodstock&#39;s dictation duties, Snoopy snaps and yells for the snow to stop. He adamantly aims to protect his secretary, knowing how good Woodstock is.
Likewise, Snoopy hates seeing his feathered friend get snowed on, and is willing to put up a fuss for hs buddy. The trajectory the pair took is interesting because Snoopy used to be quite rude to Woodstock, akin to bully/friend Lucy, calling him a &#34;stupid bird&#34; and looking down on him for his crummy flying skills. Yet, they would become the best of friends and Woodstock would be Snoopy&#39;s sidekick...and occasional secretary, of course.





 2  &#34;Learning To Dance&#34; 
        

Snoopy is a dance extraordinaire, renowned for his happy dance, even if it is to the chagrin of Lucy. Given that tidbit of information, who better to get dance lessons from than Snoopy? That&#39;s exactly what Woodstock does when he is getting ready to host a party. The problem is, Woodstock waits until 10 minutes before he has to leave for the party to learn. Hopefully Woodstock is a quick study.
It&#39;s touching to see Woodstock turn to Snoopy any time he needs help or advice. It&#39;s even more heartwarming to see the typically loafing Snoopy put a lot of effort into helping his friend. It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess if Woodstock impresses anyone at his party with his dancing, but at least he and his best friend have a blast in the meantime.





 1  &#34;Punch In The Noise&#34; 
        

In the strip, Snoopy comforts a worried Woodstock about the upcoming threat of Thanksgiving. Snoopy assures him that if worse comes to worst, he will punch whoever threatens him in the nose. It&#39;s sweet how Snoopy does not hesitate to defend his friend from any threat. Unfortunately, Charlie Brown ends up getting the short end of the stick once again but still, Snoopy&#39;s care for his friend is heartwarming.
Leave it to Charlie Brown to be at the wrong place in the wrong time. Regardless, Snoopy wraps Woodstock up in a big hug and gives him words of assurance and encouragement, determined not to let anyone harm his friend. The devotion that Snoopy and Woodstock show to each other is endearing to no end, making the long-standing popularity of the Peanuts duo a no-brainer.
