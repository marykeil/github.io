## Literature Review

Ghost Rider&#39;s Hellcycle is his primary ride, but now Robbie Reyes has proven he can make one out of literally anything.




Warning: contains spoilers for &#34;Homeland Security,&#34; appearing in Marvel Voices: Avengers #1!




Ghost Rider just proved that he can replace his trademark Hellcycle with literally anything. On his Hellcycle Ghost Rider travels the highways and byways of America, confronting evil wherever he may find it. It is his preferred mode of transportation, but in the story “Homeland Security,” appearing in Marvel Voices: Avengers #1, Robbie Reyes transforms an ordinary piece of office furniture into a blazing ride.

“Homeland Security,” written by Jason Concepcion and drawn by Moises Hidalgo, appears in Marvel Voices: Avengers #1. Robbie Reyes is out to avenge a friend who was fleeced by a demonic corporation. Attacking their corporate headquarters, Ghost Rider is temporarily separated from his ride. After being attacked and laid out by one of the demons, Ghost Rider then jumps into a regular office chair–and converts it into his new ride. The chair gets a complete, Ghost Rider-inspired makeover, complete with bones and flaming wheels.

          




He completes his mission, bringing justice to the corporation’s victims.


 Ghost Rider Has Had Many Rides 
          

Although Ghost Rider is most commonly associated with motorcycles, others have used different vehicles. There was at least one Ghost Rider active in the West in the 1800s, who rode a horse. This Ghost Rider, who appeared before Johnny Blaze’s debut, was not the first Rider to use animals: the prehistoric Ghost Rider rides a giant mammoth. Robbie Reyes, the Ghost Rider featured in Marvel Voices: Avengers, rides a ghostly, flaming muscle car. The vehicle Ghost Rider uses depends on the time and place, and is not limited to just motorcycles.

Robbie Reyes is more than a regular Ghost Rider, and it should come as no surprise he was able to turn a standard issue office chair into one of his sweetest rides. During Jason Aaron’s tenure on the Avengers, Robbie joined the team. As he struggled to find his place among Earth’s Mightiest Heroes, Robbie learned he was the “All-Rider,” a multiversal Ghost Rider with powers far exceeding Johnny Blaze or Danny Ketch. One of Reyes’ abilities is he can convert any vehicle into a flaming ride. While an office chair may not seem like it would qualify as a vehicle, it has wheels.






 What Can Ghost Rider Make a Ride Out of Next? 
          

And if it has wheels, clearly Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider can convert it into something usable in combat. The image of a Ghost Rider-tinged office chair made of bone with flaming wheels may seem ridiculous, but Concepcion and Hidalgo sell it perfectly. The office chair was merely a means to get Robbie back to his muscle car. Using the chair as his ride also shows just how clever Robbie is. Ghost Rider knows he has this ability, and uses it to replace his Hellcyle with literally anything.
