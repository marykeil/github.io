## Literature Review

DC has announced two titles — one starring a young Diana and another starring Jaime Reyes — in its massively popular Young Adult graphic novel line.




Blue Beetle and Wonder Woman will star in new YA graphic novels from DC. Following his debut in the DCEU, Jaime Reyes is returning in an original graphic novel. Wonder Woman&#39;s return to graphic novels will be centered on her younger self and a mystery in Themyscira.




This upcoming project will mark Jaime Reyes&#39; first-ever YA graphic novel. He debuted as the Blue Beetle in Infinite Crisis #5, which was released in 2006 - two issues after his first comic appearance. Taking on the mantle worn by Dan Garret and Ted Kord, Jaime has become the primary Blue Beetle in DC Comics.



          

Contrarily, Wonder Woman&#39;s legacy spans DC&#39;s previous youth graphic novel lines. She has starred in Wonder Woman: Warbringer, Diana: Princess of the Amazons, and Diana and Nubia: Princesses of the Amazons. Her Amazon sister, Nubia, also had her own YA graphic novel, Nubia: Real One.

 DC&#39;s Massively Popular Young Adult Line Expands with Two New Titles 


          



Jaime Reyes&#39; newest adventure is This Land is Our Land, which has the creative team of Julio Anta, Jacoby Salcedo, and Francesco Segala. This graphic novel will be released in early October. Wonder Woman: The Adventures of Young Diana has the creative team of Jordie Bellaire and Paulina Ganucheau. This graphic novel may be familiar to DC readers who read Wonder Woman #770 - 779, Wonder Woman #785-796, and Wonder Woman 80th Anniversary 100-Page Super Spectacular. It was the second story in those issues, now being compiled for release in early August.

Diana, in her youth, will seek the truth as she discovers that the history of Themyscira is being hidden. Missing texts lead her on a search for answers she may not like to learn. Her sheltered life has led her to lack knowledge about many things in the world, but she will begin to carve her beloved identity as a seeker of truth and justice in this graphic novel. DC&#39;s youth offerings have increased significantly in recent years. These two upcoming stories will continue the company&#39;s trend of introducing classic characters to young readers with original stories that showcase heroes&#39; and villains&#39; key powers and origins with modern stories.






Blue Beetle starred in a major feature film, Blue Beetle, making his DCEU debut in 2023.

This Land is Our Land, Blue Beetle&#39;s YA graphic novel debut, will tackle contemporary issues well-known to the Latinx community. Immigration and perceptions of border life and issues will be addressed, framing current events in a DC context. Contrary to the recent film, which takes place in Palmera City, Jaime will be operating in his hometown of El Paso, Texas, in a retelling of his origin story. Julio Anta, Jacoby Salcedo, and Francesco Segala previously worked together on Frontera, a supernatural graphic novel involving a young immigrant. Anta also worked on Poison Ivy and DC&#39;s Legion of Bloom. This Blue Beetle-focused reunion brings together a team that has proven synergy, making it a project worth anticipating.
