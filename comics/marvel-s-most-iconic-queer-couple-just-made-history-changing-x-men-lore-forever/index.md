## Literature Review

The monumental X-Men Blue: Origins has finally revealed that Destiny and Mystique are Nightcrawler&#39;s biological parents, changing X-Men lore forever.




Marvel&#39;s most iconic queer couple - the antiheroic X-Men Mystique and Destiny - just made history, taking center stage in one of the most impressive and thoughtful retcons in comic history. Finally, after years of fan theories and controversial origins, X-Men Blue: Origins establishes that Raven and Irene are the biological parents of the beloved hero Nightcrawler, retconning away the much-derided &#34;Draco&#34; plotline and giving Mystique and her wife Destiny incredible new depth.




Mystique and Destiny quickly became central figures in the X-Men&#39;s beloved Krakoan Age, and have had several iconic moments like Raven finally being allowed to call Irene her wife, and the canon reveal that the sapphic mutants were the inspiration for Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s Sherlock Holmes and Irene Adler.



          

X-Men Blue: Origins - from writer Si Spurrier, artists Wilton Santos and Marcus To, with special thanks to Charlie Jane Anders and Steve Foxe - is a beautiful story of queer love, betrayal, and sacrifice that gives Nightcrawler a much more compelling birth story and deepens the complex lore around Destiny and Mystique&#39;s long lives.


 Nightcrawler Was Conceived Out Of Love, As A Tool Of Fate 
          




The retcon that Mystique and Destiny are Kurt&#39;s biological parents is historic for so many different reasons, that all deserve attention and even more development. Firstly, X-Men Blue: Origins establishes that the powerful Mystique could be an Omega-level mutant, showing that Raven can manipulate her genetics to successfully conceive a child with Irene. Secondly, the retcon does away with the fraught and controversial origin of Azazel as Nightcrawler&#39;s demonic father. Thirdly, the reveal that Xavier - consensually - changed Destiny and Mystique&#39;s memories, making Raven think she was a cold-blooded baby murderer, now allows Mystique the space to heal and grow, moving beyond her traumatic past.

While the Krakoan Age of the X-Men has been filled with overt queerness, like the beautiful relationship blossoming between Rachel Summers and Betsy Braddock, it is still monumental that Marvel now has a canon story about two queer women conceiving a baby out of love. Sadly, it is also revealed that Destiny manipulated Mystique into having Kurt so that Nightcrawler could be used as a tragic &#34;tool of fate&#34; to thwart his &#34;father&#34; Azazel&#39;s plans for universal domination. Still, Kurt was loved by both his mothers even if Destiny was forced to sacrifice him, and now that the secret is revealed there is an opportunity for redemption for Irene and Raven.






 Mystique And Destiny&#39;s Future Remains Cloudy And Unknown 
          

Mystique and Destiny&#39;s love is centuries long, and the two fierce women have been separated and reunited many times over the years. Currently, Irene is trapped in the White Hot Room with many of Krakoa&#39;s exiled mutants and was recently stabbed by Mother Righteous in Immortal X-Men #17, so her fate is unknown. Undoubtedly, Destiny will somehow survive or be resurrected, but her eventual reunion with Mystique - and her secret son Nightcrawler - will certainly be as tense as it is joyous, as they both now know how Irene sacrificed Kurt to save the future.

Destiny and Mystique have always been a powerfully unique couple who have paved their own way, and this major retcon continues to deepen the lore of their complex and tragic relationship, laying bare how the many threads of fate have influenced much of their dire but loving journey. X-Men&#39;s most iconic queer couple are finally getting the attention and care they deserve in the modern era, and hopefully, the monumental reveal of Nightcrawler&#39;s true parentage will allow for even more nuanced and fascinating stories about this incredible family in the years to come.
