## Literature Review

In a continuation of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero continuity, it appears that the team may have too many members using the Snake Eyes codename.

G.I. Joe might have a bit of a Snake Eyes problem on its hands. The classic G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series looked like it had finally come to an end in 2022 with the release of its 300th issue, but new publisher Skybound Entertainment decided to keep the classic series going in addition to the new Energon Universe reboot. G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #301 came out last November, continuing the story that writer Larry Hama started more than 40 years ago.

Coming from the creative team of Larry Hama, Chris Mooneyham, Francesco Segala and Pat Brosseau, G.I. Joe: ARAH #301 picks up from the cliffhanger ending of the previous issue, as the Joe team continues their assault on Cobra Island while Serpentor Khan plots to unleash a deadly virus.

          

Issue #300 featured the resurrection of the original Snake Eyes, who was killed off years ago in issue #213 when he sacrificed his life to save G.I. Joe headquarters. In the years since, both Sean Collins and Dawn Moreno have taken up the mantle in his stead. Now that the original is back, however, the franchise is going to have to decide who will be the definite Snake Eyes in the classic continuity.





 The Original Snake Eyes Returns 


          

Ever since showing up in the 1982 series of action figures, Snake Eyes has continued to be one of the most popular characters in the G.I. Joe franchise. His shocking death in G.I. Joe: ARAH #213 was the subject of some controversy among fans, especially when other characters donned his ninja garb and took his codename. First was Sean Collins, the adopted son of Snake Eyes&#39; old war buddy Wade Collins, who trained with the Arishikage Clan of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow. Collins is accepted into the elite G.I. Joe team after a tour in Afghanistan, where he takes on the codename, “Throwdown.” After Snake Eyes sacrifices himself, fellow Joe Stalker offers Collins the chance to assume the Snake Eyes codename so that Cobra won’t learn of the original commando’s demise.




Another character would Dawn Moreno would take up the Snake Eyes mantle in G.I. Joe: ARAH, although her history is a bit more convoluted. Dawn first appears in issue #226, where she is seen trying out for the lacrosse team at the Cobra High School in Springfield, IL. Cobra Commander takes a liking to her, and Dawn finds herself moving up the ranks of Cobra in spite of her young age. Dawn eventually inherits the original Snake Eyes’ memories during a brainwave scanner accident, after which she escapes from Cobra. She reappears later on, making her first full appearance as the new Snake Eyes in issue #244, sporting a snazzy new outfit inspired by the original.



 Who Will Be G.I. Joe’s New Snake Eyes? 
         

Now that the original Snake Eyes has been resurrected by Doctor Mindbender and Serpentor Khan, the question must be asked: who will take up the mantle and become the Joe team’s definitive Snake Eyes? Since the original is back, it makes sense he would be the one to take ownership of his original codename. Sean Collins could always return to his original codename Throwdown, or perhaps even take on the codename of “Kamakura” in a nod to the now out-of-continuity Devil’s Due comics. And as for Dawn Moreno, she could always keep her costume and take on a new codename, perhaps even “Lady Snake Eyes.” Of course, with Larry Hama at the helm, anything is possible, so fans will have to keep reading G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero to find out who will be the one true Snake Eyes.
