## Literature Review

Sophie Campbell is a writer/artist for IDW Publishing&#39;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Screen Rant spoke with her about the end of her 50 issue arc! 




Right now, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fans are on the Road to 150, the end of a fifty-issue stretch of TMNT continuity written by acclaimed writer/artist Sophie Campbell. The storyline Campbell will be bringing to a close in issue #150 is one that began in issue #101, which followed the immensely impactful City at War storyline - aka the death of Master Splinter - as well as the fallout of the mutagen bomb that infected a number of New York City residents, turning them into mutanimals. The world of TMNT was in shambles when Sophie Campbell took the helm, allowing her to rebuild the series from the ashes of what came before - and she did not disappoint.




Sophie Campbell’s TMNT run has pushed the boundaries of what fans expect from a TMNT story, while also staying true to even the most obscure corners of TMNT lore. Indeed, one of Campbell’s coolest accomplishments has to be introducing the TMNT character Armaggon, one who was originally a forgettable ‘Saturday Morning’ villain that became perhaps the greatest threat the Turtles ever have or ever will face. In fact, in a preview for the upcoming issue in the Road to 150 - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #146 by Sophie Campbell and Vincenzo Federici - the true nature of Armaggon is teased, and it seems this ultimate threat is something of a magical virus, though its true nature still remains a mystery.

Screen Rant had the chance to speak with Sophie Campbell about the Road to 150, including what fans should expect throughout, what the creative process was like when crafting these characters and storylines, and what her whole experience shaping the world of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was like.




                  &#34;I&#39;m Still Amazed at Some of the Things They Let Me Get Away With&#34;: TMNT Ends Its Current Era with Shocking New Take on a 90s Villain   Writer Sophie Campbell&#39;s prestigious run on IDW&#39;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ongoing will conclude with Issue #150; the road there begins now.   



 Sophie Campbell Describes Her Proudest Accomplishments Throughout Her TMNT Journey 
          

Right off the top, with &#39;The Road to #150&#39; now officially underway, how does it feel to be coming to the end of your own personal TMNT journey?


My journey with TMNT will never end!!! But yeah this is the end of my 50-issue run on the ongoing series, and it hasn&#39;t quite sunken in yet, it doesn&#39;t quite feel real yet. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have tons of thoughts and feelings about it once the #150 script is finished and especially once I&#39;m looking at the final PDF proof of the issue and it all sinks in, but right now I&#39;ll be honest I don&#39;t really know how I feel about it. Ask me again in two or three months, haha. But like I said, my journey won&#39;t totally be over yet, I have more TMNT stuff in the works for after my run on the ongoing is over!





Does one thing stand out to you as your proudest contribution to TMNT lore (specifically, or collectively)?


Probably introducing Venus to the comic, her new origin, and the different forms she&#39;s gone through to arrive at her current state. It&#39;s been really awesome to finally bring her back and revamp her for the comic.


Knowing future creators are going to follow, what impact do you hope your contributions will have on the future of TMNT?


My dream is that Raphael&#39;s pet protoceratops Pepperoni will make her way into all TMNT media.


Can you speak to some of the inspirations from past stories (TMNT or otherwise) that helped you craft this journey?


My main inspiration for all things TMNT are the Mirage comics, both the old issues and the later period stuff, Volume 4 in particular. Another big inspiration is the 1985 TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness tabletop role-playing game from Palladium Books, written by Erick Wujcik, and the game&#39;s After the Bomb spin-off. That&#39;s what got me into TMNT and comics when I was little and I still go back to it for inspiration all these years later.





What is your process like when it comes to adapting pre-existing characters from TMNT lore into the modern canon? (Specifically Armaggon and Venus.)


I don&#39;t have a set process that applies to every character, really, it&#39;s mostly what I&#39;m feeling in the moment and what most strikes me about each character. I think about what the character&#39;s core concept is and the main one or two things about their original designs that seem to stick out the most to me, as well as the narrative role they&#39;re going to have in the story. Sometimes the character will start as a sketch, like I&#39;ll have a random idea that sounds cool and I&#39;ll do a doodle of it before actually writing anything down and that makes the whole concept click into place.
For Venus, the idea for her went through a couple different iterations, and it really opened things up when we were discussing her behind the scenes and we kept going back to how we already had so many mutant turtle characters and do we really need yet another one? What would Venus bring to the table that we don&#39;t have already? And at one point I said something like &#34;well what if she isn&#39;t a turtle, then?&#34; and that really blew the doors open with her, and that fit into the Jasper Barlow story I was working on, it all seemed to click together perfectly.
Armaggon also went through a few different versions. At first he was going to be much more down-to-earth, he was going to be a regular cyborg mutant from the future much like the original Archie TMNT version, more like a combination of Terminator and Cable, but for various reasons he got scrapped from the story and it took a different direction. In that case, I looked at the original character and boiled him down to &#34;time-traveling shark from the future with yellow cybernetic parts&#34; and that&#39;s what I based the storyline and design on. A couple years later when we were going to do another time travel storyline, I wanted to bring the Armaggon idea back again, but this time I felt another &#34;regular&#34; villain wouldn&#39;t be super interesting so I started doing doodles of Armaggon as a more shark-like character and he ended up being just a giant eldritch shark that flies through space/air, rather than having legs or whatever, and those exploratory sketches became the basis of the idea.







 Sophie Campbell Touches On What Fans Can Expect From TMNT’s Road To 150 
          

Without giving anything away, what can you tell us about this horrible future Donatello is trying so hard to avert (that we haven’t already seen)?


I&#39;m not sure I can tell you anything that wouldn&#39;t give things away, haha. Donatello isn&#39;t trying to prevent a particular future, per se, but he thinks if he doesn&#39;t do SOMETHING then the Turtles won&#39;t have a future at all.


Donatello has become a bit ruthless and flippant with the fallout of time travel, in the name of saving the world. Now fans know that includes Armaggon... are we witnessing Donnie&#39;s descent into villainy?


No, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever want to go that far with him. There actually was an idea we had at one point where Don becomes sort of a dark sorcerer villain, corrupted by magic and so forth, but it never came together.





TMNT obviously lends itself to multiverse stories, but there&#39;s a growing discussion around the creation of a full-blown Turtle-Verse. Considering your story, and where it might be headed, what do you think of the idea?


I know multiverse stuff is hot right now but I&#39;ve personally never had strong feelings about it. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don&#39;t. For me part of the appeal of a particular story and characters is the tone and setting unique to that thing, and when it starts crossing over with other stories/franchises/whatever, you kind of have to abandon some of that tone so the characters can co-exist. Some things fit well together, others don&#39;t.




 Sophie Campbell Will Be Back To Tell More TMNT Stories 
          

What has it been like collaborating with Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz? Any lessons or memories you&#39;ll be most fondly remembering?





I love both Kevin and Tom, they are both amazing! I think all the best memories I have with them are things I can&#39;t share publicly. It&#39;s been a dream come true to work with Kevin, my 10-year-old self would go crazy if she knew.


&#39;The Road to #150&#39; is an achievement in itself, but do you have any plans to return to TMNT in the future? Any stories/characters/other areas left unexplored that could draw you back?


Like I mentioned in the earlier question, yep, I will definitely be back! I&#39;m not done with those characters and I really want to do some spin-off stories focused on Alopex or Venus, and I still want to figure out a way to introduce other favorites to the IDW comics. We&#39;ll see!


Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #150 by IDW Publishing will be available early 2024.
