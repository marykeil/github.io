## Literature Review

While Lucy may be a thorn in Schroeder&#39;s side, her affection for the budding musician leads to some of the best Peanuts strips of all time.




It&#39;s a major recurring joke in Peanuts that Lucy is head over heels for the child musical genius Schroeder, while he tends to consider her affection an irritating distraction from his art. Making his debut in 1951, Schroeder left quite the impression on one of Peanuts&#39; main characters and, as a result, the franchise as a whole.
Schroeder fits right in with the bunch, having his own unique and idiosyncratic characteristics to match his friends. His devotion to his music and his tight friendship with Charlie Brown have led to many great jokes, but Schroeder is at his best as a double-act with Lucy. The pair have had some hilarious and iconic strips over the years, creating classics for all to enjoy.









 








 10  Schroeder Forgets Beethoven&#39;s Birthday 
Schroeder Celebrating Beethoven&#39;s Birthday Is a Beloved Running Joke

        

As Beethoven&#39;s number one fan, Schroeder constantly champions the famous composer and pianist to his friends. Schroeder is such a fan of Beethoven that he attributes accomplishments to the man behind Symphony No. 9 that he never actually did - such as thinking that Beethoven was the first President of the United States. It&#39;s therefore particularly embarassing when his foil Lucy remembers the great man&#39;s birthday and Schroeder doesn&#39;t. As ever, Lucy demonstrates the perfect gift for repeating another character&#39;s crushing inner monologue out loud.





 9  &#34;Wouldn&#39;t That Be Romantic?&#34; 
Lucy&#39;s Insensitivity Is Truly Legendary

        

Lucy foresees a long future with Schroeder despite him showing no enthusiasm for her romantic fantasies. In this strip, Lucy spins a wild tale about Schroeder and her getting married and then him becoming a famous pianist until he breaks both his arms and can no longer play piano. Schroeder isn&#39;t exactly thrilled with her ideas for the future, but as is typical for Lucy, she fails to recognize why someone is upset, and instead blames him for not being romantic enough.





 8  Lucy and Schroeder Play Baseball 
America&#39;s Pastime Never Goes Well for the Peanuts Gang

        

Lucy is terrible at baseball - but then again, so are most of the Peanuts gang. However, this strip at least offers an explanation for her lack of skill, as she&#39;s shown being distracted by her crush, Schroeder. As ever, Lucy doesn&#39;t pay attention to the details of what everyone else is saying, and is just happy to be hanging out with her pianist beau. Ultimately, however, this mismatch is Charlie Brown&#39;s fault - a careless mistake for the dedicated but perpetually disheartened manager.

 7  &#34;Nutcracker Suite&#34; 
Even Just Talking Music, There&#39;s No Way for Schroeder to Win
        

Decades before Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&#39;s &#39;Love Kernels&#39; song perfectly captured the experience of manufacturing &#39;loving&#39; moments with someone who&#39;s just not that into you, Peanuts was already on the scene. Schroeder looks up to his hero Beethoven and aspires to be just like him. This desire to be a carbon copy of his role model extends to his love life, where Schroeder wants to be a lifelong bachelor just like Beethoven. Obviously, this is not what Lucy would ever want to hear. Thankfully for fans, mishearing &#39;Nutcracker Suite&#39; as a term of endearment gives Lucy the reassurance she needs to keep bugging Schroeder in future comics.





 6  &#34;ART! ART! ART!&#34; 
Schroeder Finally Loses His Cool

        

A true artist, Schroeder puts his craft above any financial gain. Of course, that doesn&#39;t quite fit into Lucy&#39;s vision of their future together, but seeing the temperamental musician explode - and even invoke Peanuts&#39; iconic &#39;blockhead&#39; insult - doesn&#39;t dissuade her. In another perfectly observed portrait of puppy love from Charles M. Schulz, there&#39;s nothing Schroeder can do that Lucy won&#39;t spin as part of her infatuation.





 5  The Dryer 
Lucy Tries to Help Schroeder... And Things Go Terribly
        

In many ways, Lucy is Charlie Brown&#39;s opposite in the Peanuts universe - each is constantly getting things wrong, but while this fills Charlie with anxiety, Lucy barely seems to notice. Her confidence and self-absorption usually see her through to the next adventure, and stop her mishaps getting her down. Sadly, her attitude doesn&#39;t protect Schroeder from the consequences.
Lucy always means well when it comes to Schroeder. She tries to go above and beyond for him, doing little favors or trying to give him words of wisdom. Unfortunately for her and Schroeder, her good intentions always end up backfiring. Evidenced by this strip, Lucy has taken it upon herself to give Schroeder&#39;s prized toy piano a good cleaning... in the washing machine. She assures him that the washing machine did nothing bad to the instrument. The dryer, on the other hand, is a different story. It&#39;s a perfect example of why Schroeder considers his commitment to music and Lucy&#39;s affections incompatible.

 4  &#34;I Never Said I Liked You&#34; 
Sometimes, Even Lucy Deserves Some Sympathy

        

Despite its surprisingly reflective and philosophical cast, Peanuts does a great job capturing the anxieties and injustices of childhood. One such sorrow is having an unrequited crush. Usually, Lucy manages to block out the fact that Schroeder doesn&#39;t return her affections, but here he&#39;s blunt enough that even she can&#39;t ignore his lack of interest. It&#39;s rare that readers are asked to feel bad for the brash and sometimes abrasive Lucy, but the desire to run home and slam doors is a childhood reaction with which most people can sympathize.





 3  &#34;Irresistible&#34; 
Lucy&#39;s Puppy Love Is Impervious to Reality

        

Lucy has trouble taking a hint, whether it be about her crabbiness or, in this case, bugging Schroeder to no end. However, in this strip she goes one step further and creates a fantasy world where Schroeder is the one who won&#39;t leave her alone. While she doesn&#39;t go quite as far as Snoopy creating multiple alter egos, Lucy is still a Peanuts kid, which means her imagination can easily trump real life.





 2  Schroeder Finally Gives Lucy a Kiss 
Schulz Had a Surprising Habit of Finally Paying Off Long-Running Jokes
        

In this strip, Lucy finally gets what she&#39;s always wanted, as her respect for Beethoven wins her Schroeder&#39;s affection. In a tragic twist of fate, however, she ends up believing that it was actually Snoopy who kissed her on the cheek. Lucy is utterly disgusted by dog germs in several Peanuts comics, and so runs off before Schroeder can explain. While Peanuts loves a joke about thwarted expectations, it does sometimes give its characters a break - for example the wild strip where Charlie Brown finally gets to kick the football.





 1  &#34;Pay Attention to Me!&#34; 
Lucy Breaks the Fourth Wall

        

Lucy&#39;s aggressive style often means she gets her way, but here she breaks the rules of reality itself to grab Schroeder&#39;s attention. Schroeder&#39;s playing is represented by a floating score, and Lucy rips it out of the air and brings it down on her beau&#39;s head to finally get him to look up from the piano. Other characters have also interacted with Schroeder&#39;s music, for example Woodstock using it as a trampoline, but Lucy takes it the furthest.
Most of the Peanuts characters have something they want that they&#39;ll never get, representing the myriad disappointments that are so oversized in childhood. In the case of Schroeder, Lucy never quite gets to experience the adoration she doles out, but Peanuts readers at least get a lot of laughs from her attempts.
