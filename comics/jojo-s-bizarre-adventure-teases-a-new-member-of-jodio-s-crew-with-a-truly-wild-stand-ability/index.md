# JoJo s Bizarre Adventure Teases a New Member of Jodio s Crew With a Truly Wild Stand Ability


## SUMMARY 



  Paco discovers that their enemy&#39;s bag of cat heads was actually filled with potatoes, revealing that their attacker was trying to avoid combat by intimidating them.   The ability to recruit enemies into allies is a classic aspect of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, with previous characters like Bucciarati and Foo Fighters starting as enemies turned allies.   The new enemy&#39;s Stand ability, which allows them to blend into the background and manipulate illusions, offers unique and valuable stealth and scouting abilities that could benefit the Jodio crew.

## Literature Review

A new character with one of the wildest Stand abilities in the series may become Jodio&#39;s next companion, opening the door for some truly crazy scenes.




Warning: Spoilers for Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: The JojoLands, Chapter 11The latest chapter of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure&#39;s ninth part, The JojoLands, has ended with a surprising change towards their latest enemy, as Paco decides they should attempt to recruit their attacker, a mysterious figure with an incredible Stand ability. Recruiting enemies into allies is a Jojo staple, dating back to the original Speedwagon in part 1, but this enemy&#39;s Stand could open the door for some amazing scenes moving forward.




In chapter 10 and 11 of The JojoLands, Jodio and his crew came under attack by an unknown assailant. However, before attacking them, this assailant attempted to intimidate the crew by showing them a bag full of cat heads--presumably, the heads of the Stand-wielding cats seen in previous chapters. When intimidation failed, he resorted to attacking with a knife, using his Stand ability to conceal himself in plain sight by altering Jodio and friends&#39; depth perception, allowing him to blend into the background and become completely beyond notice.

          

However, the man&#39;s illusions apparently extended beyond disguising himself, as Paco discovered.


 Turning Enemies into Allies is Classic Jojo 
          




Paco peeks back into the bag of &#34;cat heads,&#34; only to discover that they were actually potatoes, made to look like cat heads by the attacker using his Stand. Paco realizes that their enemy had been attempting to avoid combat, and that it might be possible to reason with him. Of course, by the time Paco makes that realization, the attacker and Jodio are embroiled in a life-or-death fight underwater, so they have no way to signal to Jodio that this could be resolved without further violence.

As noted above, recruiting enemies is a fundamental part of Jojo, particularly early on. Many classic characters, like Golden Wind&#39;s Bucciarati and Stone Ocean&#39;s Foo Fighters, began as enemies that the series&#39; Jojo had to win over, and it seems likely that this character may be the next in line. While the abilities of some of these characters are nothing to sneeze at, this new enemy&#39;s Stand offers some truly unbelievable abilities, having already merged his hand with a cloud behind him and blended into the interior of a convertible. The ability is incredibly useful, but not offensively powerful--perfect for an ally.




The Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure manga has already had a lot of fun with this Stand ability, which leads to some surreal imagery that&#39;s a perfect fit for the series. Keeping this character around as an ally, rather than defeating him or killing him off, will allow this surreal element to remain a part of the story moving forward. It&#39;s an ability unlike any that a Jojo ally has had before, and could prove incredibly valuable for stealth and scouting, both activities that the shady Jodio crew could take full advantage of.

While this new character&#39;s name (and the name of their Stand) remain a mystery for now, that will hopefully all change in the next chapter, provided Paco has an opportunity to intervene in their fight. Jodio could definitely use another ally at this point, and it would be the first major character introduced since the first chapters of the story laid out the main cast. Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure remains as bizarre and creative as ever, and that will only become more true if this illusion-wielding enemy joins the heroes.
