# Dream Finally Explains the Core of His Power in Sandman Lore - Why Even He Has Limits


## SUMMARY 



  Dream&#39;s abilities are governed by cosmic rules that both give him power and restrict him from interfering outside of his realm.   Breaking these rules could disrupt the natural order and have major ripple effects, potentially causing unintended consequences.   Following these rules actually makes Dream more powerful and maintains a truce between him and the other Endless beings.

## Literature Review

In an explanation that could only exist in The Sandman, Dream&#39;s magic is a feat of circular logic that gives him unlimited power with limited use.




Warning: Spoilers for The Sandman Universe: Nightmare Country - The Glass House #6!In the labyrinthine lore of The Sandman, Dream&#39;s magic can seem to fluctuate between an all-powerful god and a delicate wisp of imagination. However, in the latest issue of The Sandman Universe: Nightmare Country - The Glass House, Dream explains what actually governs his abilities, and why it&#39;s so important that he follows rules he&#39;s technically free to ignore.




The Corinthian is once again loose, but not to cause mass murder - he&#39;s tracking down something that&#39;s impersonating him. As the metaphysical chase unfolds, Lucien - the Dreaming&#39;s head librarian - sees the Corinthian appear in the story of the immortal witch Thessaly&#39;s life and goes to warn his boss, Dream. Now that Dream knows where the Corinthian is, he can fix the situation with a wave of his hand. However, Dream reveals that he doesn&#39;t feel able to simply drop to Earth and grab his nightmare creation back.



          

There are cosmic rules at play that both give Dream his power and bind him from interfering in a way that&#39;s explicitly outside of his domain of the Dreaming. He has the power to break those rules, but the consequences would echo throughout every universe. The issue comes from James Tynion IV, Lisandro Estherren, Patricio Delpeche, and Simon Bowland.

 Dream Benefits from the Rules Too Much to Break Them 
The Endless Only Work Because They Observe Certain Limitations


          

The Endless may be individuals, but they are also literal embodiments of cosmic processes. Dream&#39;s creations are meant to inspire, comfort, and even terrify, but only within their own realm - dreams do not belong in the waking world. Dream implies he can choose to break this rule, but that doing so undermines the natural order and could have major ripple effects. At the same time, sticking to certain rules maintains a truce between Dream and the rest of the Endless. If he oversteps his bounds, then Death, Despair, Desire, Destruction, Delirium, and Destiny have license to do the same. So while Dream can do just about anything, he restrains himself to prevent accidental consequences and to keep his omnipotent siblings in a similar check.




However, it&#39;s not just that breaking the rules would have unintended consequences - it&#39;s that maintaining them actually makes Dream more powerful. Dreams and stories operate according to certain narrative rules - if those rules lose their meaning, then dreams and stories stop making sense and Dream&#39;s domain is undermined. It&#39;s a paradox of Dream&#39;s power: he is mighty enough to do anything he wants, but then risks sacrificing what makes him so powerful. This is a continuation of the core theme of the original Sandman comics, where Dream has to essentially die in order to change his nature - he exists within a vital system, and any deviation exacts a huge toll.

The Endless can do anything, but they stick to certain rules because it&#39;s better for them individually - and the system they embody - in the long run. However, since they have personalities and minds of their own, they&#39;re also constantly looking for loopholes and opportunities to get their way, seeking to create unique circumstances where they can act freely. Ultimately, this is a system designed to allow multiple omnipotent beings to serve vital functions at the same time, while also existing as &#39;people&#39; who can make exceptions and do deals when truly needed. It&#39;s a mind-boggling thought experiment that can confuse mere mortals, which is why the power is best left in the hands of gods like the Sandman.
