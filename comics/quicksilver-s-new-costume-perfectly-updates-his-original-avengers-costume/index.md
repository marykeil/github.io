## Literature Review

Quicksilver has undergone plenty of changes over the years, both in his personal life and in his wardrobe. His newest look puts a spin on his roots.




Quicksilver is one of the fastest heroes in the Marvel Universe – and often over the years, his look has been as sleek as his movements. He has hit every mark between villain and hero, invited ruin upon the world, and nearly pulled himself apart as he tried to put it together again. His life is riddled with major changes, but his newest costume takes him back to his roots – while still leaving room to grow.




Speaking with AIPT for X-Men Monday, writer Steve Orlando touched on some details of the upcoming Scarlet Witch &amp; Quicksilver series, including a glimpse at Pietro&#39;s new look. Artist Lorenzo Tammeta&#39;s design is a throwback with a twist, harkening back to Quicksilver&#39;s earliest days as part of Magneto&#39;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants and Cap&#39;s Kooky Quartet in the Avengers.

          

Tammetta&#39;s design features Pietro&#39;s iconic lightning stripe across the chest, and signature green color. Te look also highlights the physical similarities between Quicksilver and his twin sister Scarlet Witch, offering the perfect reminder that the two are always connected, regardless of their personal growth or fashion choices.


 Quicksilver&#39;s New Look Returns Him To His Roots 
          




Dating back to his introduction as part of Magneto&#39;s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Quicksilver has undertaken an epic personal journey of redemption. He has raced his way from antagonist to hero over the years. Despite the occasional regression in his behavior, Pietro has always managed to claw his way back to being a better person. This has meant going through several teams – and costumes – over the years. For years, he traded his original green suit for a similarly-styled blue costume. All New X-Factor ushered in a brief stint in Serval-branded yellow, and Quicksilver: No Surrender put him in purple.

Each is just a glimpse at a storied, ever-changing character arc. Still, at his core, Quicksilver remains the same man, with a mouth as fast as his feet, and an absolutely fierce commitment to the people he loves. It is only appropriate that Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver&#39;s 60th-anniversary special puts the characters in outfits that celebrate their turbulent beginnings. Their new series will be a look at how far Quicksilver has come and a reminder of what he&#39;s always able to go back to. The design respects all the qualities that make Quicksilver who he is, right down to the features he shares with Wanda.






 Quicksilver&#39;s Sartorial Past Influences His Future 
          

A return to the past isn&#39;t always a good thing, especially when it includes revisiting fractured familial relationships. Quicksilver is still carrying around old grievances with his father figure, Magneto, which will apparently create a rift between the siblings in Scarlet Witch &amp; Quicksilver, as Pietro holds on to anger towards Magneto for years. It is possible that looking like his old self could signal an eventual willingness to overcome the things he still carries from his past, or it may just partner with Pietro&#39;s stubborn streak as he digs in his heels. Regardless, Quicksilver&#39;s new design is a callback to his most timeless look, with the modern updates he&#39;s earned.
