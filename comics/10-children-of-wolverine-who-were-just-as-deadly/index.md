# 10 Children of Wolverine Who Were Just As Deadly


## SUMMARY 


 Wolverine&#39;s many children have inherited his deadly skills, with some of them even proving to be just as deadly, if not deadlier. 
 The combination of powers from their father with iconic heroes or villains make them formidable threats, or heroes in their own right. 
 Born in different realities, children like Wild Thing, Raze, and Rien show how Wolverine&#39;s powers can be upgraded beyond belief.

## Literature Review

Wolverine has many sons and daughters in the Marvel multiverse, but only a few of Logan&#39;s children can truly claim to be as deadly as their father.




The world famous Wolverine may be famous as a loner, a drifter, and a man better off without romance, but the many children of Logan prove his deadly skills are too good to limit to just one generation. Especially when Wolverine&#39;s children turn out to be just as deadly, if not even deadlier than the X-Man.
Across the Marvel multiverse of alternate timelines and realities, Wolverine has fathered dozens of children with both heroes and villains. Some of those Logan children have risen to become heroes, X-Men, Avengers, and world famous themselves. But only a select few of Wolverine&#39;s sons and daughters have done the impossible, and combined the abilities of their father and mother to prove Logan&#39;s healing, claws, and metal skeleton still have room for improvement.

 10  Torrent (AKA Kendall Logan) 
Earth-9811
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Storm   Healing factor, flight, weather manipulation   What If...? #114 (1998)   Jay Faerber, Gregg Schigiel    
Jean Grey may be known as Wolverine&#39;s most famous case of &#39;unrecquited love,&#39; but true Marvel fans knows that the romance between Wolverine and Storm is too powerful to actually come true (at least not in the main Marvel reality). Proving what kind of mutant child could be produced from two X-Men heavyweights, Kendall Logan, also known as Torrent, unleashed the powers of her mother and father in the alternate reality Earth-9811.
Blessed with both her mother Storm&#39;s weather manipulation powers, combined with the heightened senses and healing factor of her father, Torrent has also unlocked an entirely new mutation: a psychic bond with Earth itself. The double serving of powers Torrent possesses from both superpowered parents makes her a formidable threat.





 9  Wolverine, Jr. (AKA Raze Darkhölme) 
Earth-13729
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Mystique   The powers of Wolverine, shape-shifting   All-New X-Men #17 (2013)   Brian Michael Bendis, Arthur Adams    
Proving that powers like Wolverine&#39;s are enough to corrupt anybody, the Earth-13729 reality is home to Raze, Wolverine&#39;s son with Mystique. Possessing the powers of his heightened-human father and his shape-shifting mother, Raze is a true wild card. And apparently, rumored to have even more impressive and limitless shape-shifting skills than his mother, Raven.
Raze uses his powers for bad, though, as he becomes affiliated with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with Charles Xavier II, his half-brother. Raze becomes a mastermind of a massive plan to get rid of all humans in order to create a mutant paradise filled with all the persecuted mutants from the multiverse. Mystique and Destiny may be a fan-favorite X-Men couple, but the pairing of Wolverine with Mystique created an extremely terrifying villain.





 8  Wild Thing (AKA Rina Logan) 
Earth-982
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Elektra   The powers of Wolverine, psychic claws   J2 #5 (1998)   Tom DeFalco, Ron Lim    
Rina Logan isn&#39;t the most iconic demonstration of a female Wolverine, but she did arrive long before X-23 ever existed. Bearing the codename &#39;Wild Thing&#39; when debuting as a hero in Earth-982, Rina is as close as it gets to her father&#39;s abilities. And exhibiting gymnastic, acrobatic, and combat proficiency in fights against alternate versions of multiple Marvel icons, she does her father proud. Not to mention her mother, the deadly assassin Elektra.
The only real difference between Rina and her father is the upper limits of her super strength, and the absence of Logan&#39;s iconic bone claws. Not to be outdone, Rina instead relies upon a set of psychic claws, focused to not only solid slicers, but strong enough to cut through most material. How she learned to unlock the power is due to her godmother, Psylocke. But how did she create them in the first place? Mainly because it was the &#39;90s, and the &#34;MC2&#34; Universe didn&#39;t ask for much more.





 7  Ultimate Wolverine (AKA James Hudson, Jr.) 
Earth-1610


 







  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Magda Lensherr   The powers of Wolverine, organic steel-laced skeleton   Ultimate Comics: X #1 (2010)   Jeph Loeb, Arthur Adams    
In the Ultimate Marvel reality that shaped the MCU, James Hudson is Wolverine&#39;s son with the Witch aka Magda Lensherr, the ex-wife of Magneto and mother to Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. In the Earth-1610 timeline, JImmy initially thought that he was adopted by Wolverine, only to find out that he was actually his biological son. Similar in many ways to Wolverine, Jimmy has a wild and reckless personality as well as regenerative healing and retractable bone claws that are even more powerful than his dad&#39;s.
Unlike his father, Jimmy was born with the natural ability to coat his claws as well as his whole skeleton and teeth in a strong metallic covering that can cut through steel. Jimmy also acquired control over poison physiology after the Earth Poison invasion. As a result, he is able to protect himself against poison while also enhancing and receiving new abilities like the ability to shape-shift his claws and wall-crawling.





 6  Sabreclaw (AKA Hudson Logan) 
Earth-982
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Unknown   Healing factor, heightened senses, super strength   J2 #8 (1999)   Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz    
Wolverine&#39;s kid Sabreclaw is the half-brother of Rina in Earth-982. The mother of Sabreclaw is unknown, but what readers do know is that this child of Wolverine is a villain who seems to take more after Sabretooth than his own father, which is even reflected in his name (although the most obvious explanation for his Creed-esque qualities is seemingly ruled out).
Sabreclaw/Hudson Logan does have some things in common with his father; namely his inherited powers and his preferred fighting style of street-type brawling bolstered by a skilled background in martial arts. Sabreclaw used these powers against the Avengers when he was part of the villainous group the Revengers. However, he would end up switching to the good side at a later point, using his deadly powers for benevolence instead.





 5  X-23 (AKA Kirika Yashida) 
Earth-295
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Mariko Yashida   The powers of Wolverine, adamantium-laced skeleton   X-Men: Age of Apocalypse #12 (2005)   C.B. Cebulski, Chris Bachalo    
Don&#39;t let the codename from another reality fool oyu: Kirika Yashida is absolutely not a &#39;version&#39; of Laura Kinney, the X-23 of the main Marvel reality. This version hailing from Earth-295 is Wolverine&#39;s daughter with Mariko Yashida, born without Logan having any knowledge of her existence. But in the world of mutant heroes, her name and deployment of bone claws made the source of her powers fairly obvious. After gaining help from Magneto, Kirika&#39;s bone claws and skeleton became bonded with adamantium, just like her father.





 4  Daken (AKA Akihiro) 
Earth-616


 







  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Itsu   The powers of Wolverine, pheramone control   Wolverine: Origins #5 (2006)   Daniel Way, Steve Dillon    
Wolverine&#39;s son with Itsu in the Earth-616 timeline, Daken, also known as Akihiro was not raised by either of his parents. This is because his mother Itsu was killed by the Winter Soldier and Daken was stolen by Romulus. The villain Romulus raised Daken to be a cold-blooded killer, which he used to dismantle his father&#39;s heroic legacy.
Daken masqueraded as Wolverine in the Dark Avengers and tried to lead a criminal empire. He was aided by his exceptional powers, some of which were gained from his father, like the trademark bone claws. Other powers are all his own such as his ability to manipulate emotions through pheromone control, an ability that allows him to mask his own scent so powerfully that even Wolverine can&#39;t track him down. In addition to having physical prowess, Daken is also incredibly manipulative and intelligent, shown in his manipulations of the uber-brainy Norman Osborn and Reed Richards.





 3  Wolverine (AKA Laura Kinney) 
Earth-616


 







  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Dr. Sarah Kinney   The powers of Wolverine   NYX #3 (2004)   Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost    
Created by &#39;The Facility&#39; in the Earth-616 timeline, the X-Force member Laura Kinney was created when geneticist Sarah Kinney used her own genetic material along with Wolverine&#39;s to create a supreme assassin. Laura Kinney first sought out Wolverine to kill him as she wanted to put an end to all the human weapon experiments. However, Wolverine opted to help her instead, and she became enrolled at Xavier Institute and would become a highly regarded hero.
Since Laura has been genetically engineered from the DNA of her father, her first origin story implied Laura was a direct clone. More recently, the science has been fully unlocked, revealing Laura is a true genetic daughter of Wolverine, making Laura&#39;s official claiming of the Wolverine mantle an entirely different form of &#39;keeping it in the family.&#39;





 2  Scout (AKA GAbby Kinney) 
Earth-616
        

  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Dr. Sarah Kinney   The powers of Wolverine   NYX #3 (2004)   Craig Kyle, Christopher Yost    
The mutant clone of Laura, Scout aka Gabby Kinney may seem innocent, but she&#39;s one tough cookie. Trained to be a lethal weapon, much like her genetic template and sister, Laura, Scout has the deadly qualities of Wolverine mixed with an insensitivity to pain. A fan-favorite member of Wolverine&#39;s family, Gabby also has body armor and an armored mask along with her natural powers and fight training which makes her a heavy hitter. Having a strong moral compass and a reservoir of empathy, Honey Badg--make that &#39;Scout&#39; is now almost exclusively using her powers for good.





 1  Rien (AKA &#39;Queen of Nothing&#39;) 
Earth-TRN758


 







  Mother   Powers/Mutations   First Appearance   Created by    Sylvie D&#39;Arqueness   The powers of Wolverine, sorcery, magical bone claws   Marvel Comics Presents #1 (2019)   Charles Soule, Paulo Siqueira    
Wolverine&#39;s sorceress daughter, &#39;Riene Du Rien&#39; is among the most recent and most overpowered children of Wolverine, born to the sorceress Sylvie D&#39;Arqueness, which explains where she got her magical abilities. Having mutant heritage along with sorcery capabilities and portal creation, Rien is a fighter capable of slaying powerful demons.
Rien was conceived purposely so the Clan D&#39;Arqueness could have a member who possessed the magical abilities of the clan along with Logan&#39;s healing factor. They hoped to use the powerful Marvel magic user Rien against a demon known as the Truth, which turned out to be a successful plan as Rien did just that. In turn, she got her freedom and was finally able to form a close relationship with her father.
