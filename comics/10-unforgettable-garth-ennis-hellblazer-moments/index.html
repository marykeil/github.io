  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>John Constantine is one of DC&rsquo;s darkest, most complex heroes; many of his most stand-out moments come from Garth Ennis&rsquo; run on &ldquo;Hellblazer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Constantine, protagonist of the long-running DC series, Hellblazer, is one of the company&rsquo;s grittiest characters. With his extended Hellblazer run – which lasted from 1991 to 1994 – prolific comic book creator Garth Ennis&rsquo; played a major role in raising the character to iconic status, crafting some of the series&rsquo; most iconic storylines, and most intense moments.
All entries on this list are written by Garth Ennis, with artistic contributions by Will Simpson, Steve Dillion, Mark Pennington, Tom Ziuko, and Gaspar.</p>
<p>The DC Universe is full of supernatural beings, and few characters have had as many interactions with them as John Constantine. However, the supernatural isn&rsquo;t the only drama in John&rsquo;s life, which ranges from a heart-shattering breakup to a bout with cancer. John has gone through plenty of difficult times that have nothing to do with the supernatural. This is one of the things Garth Ennis did so perfectly during his tenure on Hellblazer, blending John&rsquo;s natural life with his supernatural adventures, from John dealing with demons to dealing with a broken heart. Below are the Top 10 most absolutely unforgettable moments in Garth Ennis&rsquo; run on Hellblazer.</p>
<p>John Constantine&rsquo;s Final Form Just Turned Him into a DC God
The fate of DC&rsquo;s most infamous sorcerer is revealed: at the end of the universe, John Constantine has become a god among men in the DC Universe.</p>
<p>10  John Constantine Is Diagnosed With Cancer
John Faces Danger From Within</p>
<p>Garth Ennis&rsquo; run on Hellblazer started in Hellblazer #41 where, after waking up and immediately becoming physically sick, John rushed to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. It was a shocking, and sobering, moment for Constantine, who always assumed that his death would come spectacularly. John Constantine always assumed how he&rsquo;d die would be failing to trick one last demon, failing to escape the clutches of hell one last time – he never considered something so ordinary as cancer. This moment was the entire driving force for Ennis&rsquo; run on Hellblazer, as John set out to find a cure for his lung cancer.</p>
<p>9  Constantine Defeats The Devil
John Meets The First Of The Fallen &amp; Makes A Lifelong Enemy</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s most significant antagonist was without a doubt the First of the Fallen. This rivalry began in Hellblazer #42. In an attempt to cure his cancer, Constantine met up with an old friend named Brendan Finn, who was a skilled magician. Unfortunately, in a tragicomic twist, it was revealed Brendan was suffering from liver cancer, and only agreed to meet with John hoping that he&rsquo;d be able to cure him. With little other recourse, the two proceeded to drink the night away; as Brendan started to fade, the Devil appeared to collect Brendan&rsquo;s soul. It was here that Constantine tricked the First of the Fallen, making an enemy for life.</p>
<p>8  John Shows He Truly Does Care
Despite His Reputation, Constantine Tries To Make Amends</p>
<p>By Hellblazer #44, John had mostly accepted the fact that he was going to be killed by his cancer. He managed to save Brendan Finn&rsquo;s soul, but neither of them could stop their cancer from progressing. To make some final amends, John traveled, visiting each of his few friends and family, saying his last goodbyes. This included his sister Cheryl, and his niece Gemma, his best mate Chas Chandler, and his newest friend Matt, another fellow cancer patient. This showed that while John is infamous for using and sacrificing his friends for the greater good, he did legitimately care about the people in his life.</p>
<p>7  John Pulls The Greatest Trick Ever
Constantine Proves He&rsquo;s DC&rsquo;s Greatest Con Man</p>
<p>John&rsquo;s battle with cancer finally concluded in Hellblazer #45. In this story, John was out of options, the cancer having ravaged his body. With nothing left to lose, he came up with a brilliant, simple trick. John contacted the Second of the Fallen and traded his soul; he then contacted the Third of the Fallen and did the same. When John&rsquo;s time came, the First of the Fallen arrived to collect his soul. It was then that John revealed his grand plan. By selling his soul to the other two Fallen, he&rsquo;d forced the demons into a bind. They couldn&rsquo;t all claim his soul; with no other choice, the Fallen cured John&rsquo;s cancer.</p>
<p>6  The Death Of Matt
John Beat His Cancer; His Friend Wasn&rsquo;t So Lucky</p>
<p>Hellblazer #46 focused on John&rsquo;s new friend Matt, a patient that John met in a cancer ward he considered staying in. Matt had a strong personality, and got along instantly with John, telling all manner of raunchy jokes, and generally reassuring John that the end of his life didn&rsquo;t necessarily have to be so bad. When John tricked the Fallen into curing his cancer, it was a major win in Constantine&rsquo;s life, but not everyone could be so lucky as to trick a group of devils. While Constantine&rsquo;s cancer was fully healed, Matt&rsquo;s was not, and Matt ended up dying in front of John.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s Upcoming New Series Reveals A Major Sandman Plot Was a Lie
John Constantine is one of the most prolific liars in comics, and it seems one lie he told many years ago is finally coming back to haunt him.</p>
<p>5  Constantine Orchestrated The Fall Of Gabriel
Not Even Angels Can Avoid John&rsquo;s Influence</p>
<p>After John tricked the First of the Fallen into helping cure his cancer, he knew the devil wouldn&rsquo;t just give up. John had done something no mortal had ever done before. He had humiliated the devil. John knew that the First would come for him eventually. To prepare for that inevitability, John manipulated the fall of the Archangel Gabriel, as seen in Hellblazer #66. John set it up so that Gabriel would unknowingly fall in love with the succubus Ellie, and sleep with her. By losing his virginity to a demon, the Archangel Gabriel was cast out of heaven. Now a fallen angel, whose heart was in John&rsquo;s possession, Gabriel had no choice but to fight for John.</p>
<p>4  John Is Dumped By His True Love, Kit Ryan
While John Steals Gabriel&rsquo;s Heart, Kit Breaks His</p>
<p>John Constantine was with many women over the years, but he never loved any of them the same way he loved Kit Ryan. Kit was a friend of both John and Brendan&rsquo;s, and would eventually end up dating both of them. With Kit at his side, John stated he was happier than he&rsquo;d ever been, that he felt better than ever before. However, when John&rsquo;s antics resulted in Kit being threatened in her home by men with knives, she decided that was too much. Kit immediately broke up with John, leaving London in Hellblazer #67. This sent Constantine into a spiraling depression, and John even became homeless because of it.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s Writers at DC Comics Keep Meeting Him in Real Life
John Constantine from Hellblazer has reportedly been seen in real life by several writers from DC Comics, including his creator, Alan Moore.</p>
<p>3  John Kills The King Of The Vampires
John Gets A Taste Of His Old Self Back</p>
<p>After John became homeless, he wandered around London with no real goal or motivation in life. When Kit dumped John, it put him in a dark place, such as he hadn&rsquo;t been since the Newcastle Incident. He spent all his time getting drunk, as seen in Hellblazer #69. He eventually met a young man trying to get himself out of homelessness through prostitution, and the two decided to stick together. This partnership was cut short when the King of Vampires, someone John had snubbed before, returned to enact revenge. The King of Vampires would&rsquo;ve killed John if not for John&rsquo;s immunity to vampires, due to his demon blood, which allowed John to turn the tables and kill the King.</p>
<p>2  The First Of The Fallen Breaks The Deadlock
John&rsquo;s Greatest Bluff Is Called</p>
<p>Part of John&rsquo;s original con to force the Fallen into curing his cancer relied on the demons not wanting to fight one another, due to them being equally powerful. In Hellblazer #79, the First of the Fallen made a shocking revelation about the nature of his relationship with his demonic brethren. While their power was equal, their weaknesses were not. This allowed the First of the Fallen to break the deadlock, destroying the Second and Third of the Fallen. As a result, John&rsquo;s soul was his to claim. The First of the Fallen then traveled to Earth and began killing John&rsquo;s friends, one by one, until he finally went after John, looking to finally end their feud.</p>
<p>1  John Defeats The First Of The Fallen Once More
The First Is Outsmarted Once Again</p>
<p>The final confrontation between John Constantine and the First of the Fallen in Garth Ennis&rsquo; run was seen in Hellblazer #83. The First of the Fallen had gone on a rampage through John&rsquo;s personal life, slaughtering the majority of his friends, and even killing Archangel Gabriel, after stealing his heart from John. It seemed like all hope was lost, before John revealed his final trick. The devil that had been helping the First all along wasn&rsquo;t a vengeful Astra, but Ellie. With the First&rsquo;s guard down, Ellie stabbed him with a dagger capable of killing celestial beings. As he died, the First wondered what would happen to him as he faded from reality, and John Constantine escaped the devil once more.</p>
