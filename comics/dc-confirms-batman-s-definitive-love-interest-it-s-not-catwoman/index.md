# DC Confirms Batman s Definitive Love Interest (&amp; It s Not Catwoman)


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s true love is not a person but the ideal of Gotham City, which he is committed to saving.   Batman&#39;s difficulty in maintaining relationships is due to his unwavering devotion to Gotham, which takes precedence over everything else.   Batman&#39;s extreme actions, such as willingly enduring brutalization by alien mercenaries, demonstrate his single-minded dedication to protecting Gotham at any cost.

## Literature Review

DC confirms Batman&#39;s one true love is an ideal, not a person, and factoring this in makes Bruce Wayne&#39;s many failed romances make much more sense.




Warning: Spoilers for Batman: Off-World (2023) #1 ahead! Many have contended for Batman&#39;s heart - Selina Kyle, Talia al Ghul, and Vicki Vale, to name a few - but now DC reveals why all of these romances have failed to stick. Batman&#39;s one, true, definitive love isn&#39;t a person but an ideal: the ideal of Gotham City, the place he has sworn to save.




Jason Aaron, Doug Mahnke, Jaime Mendoza, and David Baron&#39;s Batman: Off-World (2023) #1 shows Batman imprisoned by alien mercenaries and having made a tentative alliance with Ione, a captive Tamaranian. Ione comments on Batman&#39;s irregular behavior, deducing that he has been captured on purpose, guessing that &#34;[A] man does something that deliriously stupid, can&#39;t be but one explanation. He&#39;s in love.&#34;

          

When Ione asks about Batman&#39;s lover, however, the panel immediately cuts away to the rainy and crumbling Gotham skyline, implying that the city of Gotham itself is his motivation for this crazy scheme.

 No Person Can Come Between Batman&#39;s Love of Gotham City 
          




Batman&#39;s seeming inability to keep a relationship isn&#39;t new; most infamously, his perpetual bachelorhood and close partnership with Robin was interpreted by psychiatrist Fredric Wertham to be a predatory influence in his 1954 screed against comic books, The Seduction of the Innocent. Many women have made their way into Batman&#39;s life since then, with Catwoman usually ending up as his most consistent lover. The two were even engaged to be married in Tom King, Mikel JanÃ­n, and June Chung&#39;s Batman (2016) #50, before Catwoman broke off the wedding for fear of Bruce Wayne not being able to function as Batman if he were to be satisfied with his life.

When Gotham City is held to be Batman&#39;s one true love, his difficulty in maintaining relationships becomes more easily understood. The aforementioned wedding was called off because it had the risk of affecting Batman&#39;s work in Gotham. Similarly, the &#34;Gotham War&#34; debacle caused a major schism in Batman and Catwoman&#39;s relationship, with Batman unable to come to terms with Catwoman&#39;s thieves&#39; guild due to it running the risk of unleashing a wave of even more dangerously skilled criminals into Gotham. Gotham even takes precedence over justice, with Batman&#39;s &#34;Zur-En-Arrh&#34; persona pushing him to take on increasingly violent methods in his crusade against crime.






 Batman Will Do Almost Anything In Gotham&#39;s Name 
          

The entirety of Batman: Off-World (2023) #1 is kicked off by Batman spending $532 million on a journey into space with no prospect of return. He does this with the full intention of being brutalized again and again by violent alien mercenaries until he has learned their styles and weaknesses enough to counter them should he ever face extraterrestrial threats in Gotham again. This is single-minded devotion that no individual person can possibly compete with, showing that Gotham is - and remains - the definitive love in Batman&#39;s life.
