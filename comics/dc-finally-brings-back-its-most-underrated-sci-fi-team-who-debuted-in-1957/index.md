Warning: contains spoilers for Outsiders #2!




DC is finally bringing back its most underrated sci-fi team, one that has been around since 1957. In DC’s new Outsiders book, the latest incarnation of the team is on a mission to chart the secret history of the world, and in a preview for issue two, they meet up with one of DC’s oldest teams, one that can trace its roots back to Jack Kirby and the Silver Age of Comics.

In Outsiders #2, written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Robert Carey, the team meets the Challengers of the Unknown. A mysterious phenomenon, encountered by team leader Batwoman years ago, has manifested itself in the South Pacific. She leads the team on an investigation.

         

As they approach the site, a voice announces they are now prey to the beasts that live in the area, but not to fear…for they are under the protection of the Challengers of the Unknown.





 The Challengers of the Unknown Were Created by a Comic Book Icon 
          

The Challengers of the Unknown have a long and storied history at DC Comics. Co-created by Jack Kirby, the Challengers of the Unknown debuted just as comics’ Silver Age was kicking off. A team of experts in their respective fields, the four who would become the Challengers survived what should have been a lethal accident. Feeling they were on borrowed time, the four men banded together as the Challengers of the Unknown. There have been different incarnations of the team throughout their 60&#43; years of existence, including a version at the dawn of the New 52. The Challengers have been absent from the DC Universe for some time now.

The Challengers of the Unknown are cult favorites, and despite a lack of appearances, their influence is great. Jack Kirby created the Challengers shortly before he collaborated with Stan Lee on laying the foundation for the Marvel Universe. Some fans have commented on the similarities between the Challengers and the Fantastic Four, who would appear in 1961. Both teams have four members and in each story they face a high-concept menace, mostly of a sci-fi nature. Both features showcased a sense of exploration and high adventure–the only difference is the Fantastic Four had powers. The Challengers of the Unknown receded into obscurity whereas the Fantastic Four became icons.






 What Role Will the Challengers of the Unknown Play? 
          

Now the time has come for the Challengers of the Unknown to make their grand return. Fans do not meet individual members of the Challengers in the preview, giving them a sense of mystery. The Challengers are quite confident in their ability to protect the Outsiders from harm. The Outsiders are dedicated to studying the secret history of the DC Universe, and the Challengers have been a part of it for some time, giving them a unique perspective. The Challengers of the Unknown are one of DC’s most underrated sci-fi teams, whose missions overlap perfectly with the Outsiders.

Outsiders #2 is on sale December 12 from DC Comics!
