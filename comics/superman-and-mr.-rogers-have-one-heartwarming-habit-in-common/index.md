## Literature Review

Both Superman and Fred Rogers have gone to heroic lengths to respond with kindness and empathy to the people who have reached out to them.




Warning: Spoilers for Superman (2023) #9 ahead!It is easy to forget that, for all of Superman&#39;s power, his best stories showcase the man&#39;s strength of heart over that of his muscles. Case in point, an encounter with a child&#39;s letter highlights the similarities between Superman and another paragon of empathy: Fred Rogers.




Joshua Williamson, Bruno Redondo, and Adriano Lucas&#39;s Superman (2023) #9 opens with Lois Lane sitting with an unconscious Superman, reading him a get-well letter sent to him from a boy named Jamie. The panel quickly cuts away to reveal sack after sack of such letters, all filled to the brim, as Lois begins to read another.



          

When Superman recovers, one of the first things he says to Lois is, &#34;Remind me to write Jamie back and tell him I remember him and his brother. I need to write him a birthday card...&#34;

                  Superman&#39;s Latest Twist Was a Moral Evolution - &amp; Now a Priest Explains Why   Jon Kent just faced off with the Injustice universe&#39;s Clark Kent, and now a priest explains how the moment evolved the idea of &#39;Superman.&#39;    





 Superman&#39;s Strength Is Measured By The Letters He Receives 
          

Fred Rogers, the children&#39;s entertainer and host of Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood for 33 years, is an inspiration to many for his incredible empathy. A lifelong advocate for public television and of children&#39;s emotional intelligence, his legacy lives on in children&#39;s shows such as Daniel Tiger&#39;s Neighborhood, and films about his life such as A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood (in which he was portrayed by Tom Hanks to wide acclaim). Famously, Fred Rogers is purported to have responded to every letter he received from the many children who watched his show, taking the time to send a thoughtful, personal message to every single one.

It hardly stands as a coincidence that when comics want to emphasize Superman&#39;s empathy, they turn to his response to the many letters he receives. Back in 2003&#39;s Action Comics #808 by Joe Kelly, Pascual Ferry, Cam Smith, and Guy Major, Natasha Irons ends up explaining to a would-be assassin that Superman reads and keeps every letter sent his way - from the ones thanking him for saving them to the ones demanding why he didn&#39;t show during their time of need. Just like Fred Rogers, Superman holds himself accountable to every letter written to him.






 Little Acts Of Empathy Make Heroes 
          

Superman&#39;s response to Jamie in Superman #9 is a reminder of his extreme empathy. Letter writing is less and less common in our digitally-dominated communication landscape, but that only serves to highlight how intimate and personal the act of sending letters can be - and Superman and Fred Rogers respect that vulnerability by taking the time and energy to respond in kind. It&#39;s a deeply personal, heartwarming act, and one that reminds readers that Superman&#39;s greatest strength will always be his empathy and compassion.

Superman (2023) #9 is available now from DC Comics.
