## Literature Review

DC&#39;s version of the Fantastic Four just got a major upgrade in power, putting them in the same category as the Justice League.




Warning: contains spoilers for Outsiders #2!




Move over Justice League–DC has just elevated its version of the Fantastic Four to virtual godhood. The Justice League is the publisher’s premiere super team, full of some of its heaviest hitters. There are other teams in the DC Universe, but none can rival the Justice League in sheer power. That is, until now. In Outsiders #2, fans are reintroduced to a classic DC team, and learn they have received a massive power upgrade.

Outsiders #2 is written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Robert Carey. The newest incarnation of the Outsiders has met the Challengers of the Unknown out in international waters. The Challengers take the Outsiders on a tour of the mobile version of Challengers Mountain. The team is brought to Mountain’s information center, which is currently tracking thousands of extra dimensional threats.



          




Finally, one of the Challenger’s scientists exclaims that the computer figured out how to kill the Monitor.


 The Challengers of the Unknown Are More Than DC&#39;s Version of the Fantastic Four 
          

The Monitor is one of the most powerful characters in the DC Universe, and the fact that the Challengers of the Unknown can kill him is a serious step-up for one of the publisher’s oldest teams. Co-created by Jack Kirby at the dawn of comics’ Silver Age, there have been many incarnations of the team, which get a passing nod in this issue. While the roster may change, one thing remains the same: they will handle threats few others will touch. Working under the radar of most of the publisher’s heroes, the Challengers play a vital role in the DC Universe.


 




The Challengers of the Unknown also bear a striking resemblance to the Fantastic Four, and indeed, the Challengers appeared roughly two years before Marvel’s First Family debuted. In addition to both being co-created by Jack Kirby, both teams consist of four members (although the Challengers now have more) who fight a variety of science-fiction-oriented threats. The Challengers of the Unknown lack the superpowers and family dynamic of the Fantastic Four, but it is not a stretch to see the team as a “dry-run” for Mister Fantastic, the Human Torch and the rest.

 Could the Challengers Also Defeat the Justice League? 
          

And now the awe-inspiring true power of the Challengers of the Unknown has been revealed. The Challengers have always used advanced technology in their missions, but the level they are working at now is above and beyond anything previously seen. An organization that can not only scan the entire multiverse but even go as far as to kill one of its most powerful beings is not one to be trifled with. It would appear this new incarnation of the Challengers of the Unknown is preoccupied with the multiverse, for reasons unknown. Their new power upgrade elevates them beyond being DC’s Fantastic Four, and putting them way ahead of the Justice League.
