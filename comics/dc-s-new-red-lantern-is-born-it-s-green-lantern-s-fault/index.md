## Literature Review

Green Lanternâ€™s greatest enemy returns and thanks to Hal Jordan, his oldest nemesis has just gotten a power-up that makes him stronger than ever.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #5!Thanks to Green Lantern, the DC Universe has a much more dangerous Red Lantern to deal with. Hal Jordan has dealt with his fair share of evil ring-slingers in the past. But thanks to the Emerald Knight&#39;s latest actions, one of his most bitter enemies is becoming more powerful than ever.




In Green Lantern #5 by Jeremy Adams and Xermanico, Hal Jordan&#39;s former mentor and oldest enemy Sinestro has taken control of Ferris Air&#39;s drones and is using them to bomb various cities. Green Lantern heads out to stop Sinestro&#39;s plan when he realizes that Sinestro is attempting to instill fear worldwide to recharge his Power Ring.

          

Green Lantern stops the drones and tracks down Sinestro in his base. Sinestro reveals that the Emotional Spectrum isn&#39;t working like it&#39;s supposed to and that he can&#39;t channel fear like he used to. However, Jordan&#39;s actions have angered Sinestro considerably, to the point that the villain can now channel the Red Light of Rage.


 Green Lantern Has Turned Sinestro Into a Red Lantern 


          




After he was booted from the Green Lantern Corps, Sinestro found a new light to master, one that embodied his central ideology. Rather than willpower, Sinestro believed in the power of fear, thinking it was the only way order could be established in a lawless universe. Sinestro harnessed the Yellow Light of Fear and used it to create his own rival to the Green Lanterns, the Sinestro Corps. However, Sinestro has experimented with other lights in the Emotional Spectrum, such as the Ultraviolet Light. But the greatest enemy of the Green Lanterns has almost always been the biggest champion of the Yellow Light.

It&#39;s not that Sinestro believes in the power of fear any less. He just appears to be having trouble accessing the Yellow Light, which is why Sinestro tried to kickstart his ring by generating panic with his drone attack. But while Sinestro seems unable to manipulate fear, Hal&#39;s interference has helped his enemy tap into the light generally wielded by Red Lanterns. This is a bit odd as Sinestro doesn&#39;t have a Red Lantern Power Ring, yet his intense hatred of Hal has unlocked the Red Light&#39;s power. While Sinestro has always preferred the Yellow Light, he&#39;s finally putting his hatred to good use by becoming a Red Lantern.






 Sinestro is Reaching His Full Potential With His New Power Source 


          

Sinestro may believe in fear, but he&#39;s always been a suitable Red Lantern candidate. The man has so much hate and contempt in his heart it&#39;s more surprising that he hasn&#39;t been recruited into the Red Lanterns before. But now, Hal Jordan has inadvertently helped Sinestro access a new source of power that&#39;s going to make Hal&#39;s life a living hell. Sinestro was destructive enough when he wielded fear. Now the villain has the Red Light, one of the most devastating forces in the Emotional Spectrum. Sinestro has been wanting to prove how much stronger he is than Hal Jordan for years. Now Hal may have just given Sinestro everything he needs to do so.

Green Lantern #5 is on sale now from DC Comics.
