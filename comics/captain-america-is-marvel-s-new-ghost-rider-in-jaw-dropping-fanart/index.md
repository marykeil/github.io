## Literature Review

Captain America undergoes a stunning transformation, trading his shield for hellfire as Marvel&#39;s newest Ghost Rider in a legendary fanart.




Captain America takes a thrilling departure from his patriotic persona and emerges as Marvel&#39;s newest Ghost Rider in a jaw-dropping digital fanart revelation. The iconic shield-wielding hero trades in his stars and stripes for the ethereal flames synonymous with the supernatural anti-hero, resulting in an electrifying fusion that fans won&#39;t want to miss.




Digital artist Kode Abdo unveiled an awe-inspiring masterpiece on Instagram that seamlessly fuses two iconic Marvel characters, Captain America and Ghost Rider. Abdo&#39;s creative prowess is on full display as he expertly incorporates distinctive elements from both heroes, resulting in a visually stunning and wholly original artwork.


 

Abdo&#39;s attention to detail, unadulterated skill, and artistic finesse make this rendition arguably the coolest and most badass Captain America fanart to date. Fan reception of this piece has been overwhelmingly positive, with the post garnering dozens of comments singing Kode&#39;s praise and nearing 7,000 likes as of December 14, 2023.


 Digital Artist Kode Abdo Reimagines Steve Roger&#39;s as the Next Ghost Rider 


          




In Kode&#39;s Marvel character mash-up, the iconic Captain America suit from the character&#39;s debut in the &#39;40s takes center stage, signaling that this particular iteration is none other than the legendary Steve Rogers. However, the conventional Captain America elements take a thrilling turn as Abdo seamlessly blends the superhero with the Spirit of Vengeance. Steve Rogers dons the classic suit, but with a macabre twistâ€”his skeletal form, engulfed in blue hellfire, emerges beneath the familiar attire, a nod to the haunting aesthetics of Ghost Rider. Abdo&#39;s artistic ingenuity boldly paints a story in which Steve Rogers has become one with the Spirit of Vengence.

The hypothetical narrative of Steve Rogers assuming the role of Ghost Rider introduces a genuinely compelling crossover concept for Marvel to possibly explore. Within the canon, the Ghost Rider legacy has witnessed various characters embracing the supernatural mantle, meaning Steve&#39;s transformation into the Spirit of Vengence would be a credible storyline. Fans would undoubtedly be eager to witness what they affectionately term &#34;Captain Ghost&#34; as a canonical addition. Kode&#39;s inventive creation has captivated fans and found its place as screensavers for some, a testament to the widespread appeal and resonance of this unique fusion within the Marvel community that would undoubtedly be welcome in canon.

 Captain America Takes on Rarest Ghost Rider Form 
          

One of the remarkable things about this fanart is that Steve adopts one of the rarest Ghost Rider forms in the Marvel universe. Among those who have assumed the Ghost Rider mantle, Danny Ketch stands out for his distinctive azure flame, a signature attribute that became synonymous with his portrayal. In the &#39;90s, Ketch&#39;s Ghost Rider was intricately linked to an angel named Zadkiel, the Angel of Vengeance, offering an origin story for Danny Ketch&#39;s blue flames. Consequently, if Abdo&#39;s creation were to become part of the official Marvel canon, Captain America would stand as the second Ghost Rider to embody the rare and visually striking blue flame form.
