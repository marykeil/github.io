  The new Star-Lord&#39;s look surprises the aliens he helps, as he&#39;s revealed to be Howard the Duck, who joins the Guardians as part of an anthology celebrating his 50th anniversary.

An unexpected Marvel hero is using the Star-Lord handle as the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Between dealing with intergalactic threats like Ego and the High Evolutionary, the Guardians always find time to help the little people. In a new Marvel issue, however, one of the aliens they&#39;ve helped notes that Star-Lord looks very different from what she expected.




The new Star-Lord&#39;s excuse is that the camera adds ten pounds, and a foot of height. It also removes the feathers? That&#39;s right, the newest member of the Guardians of the Galaxy is a character MCU fans may remember from the post-credits scene of the first Guardians movie, Howard the Duck. As part of the character&#39;s 50th anniversary, Marvel is releasing an anthology of &#34;What If...?&#34; alternate universe stories featuring Howard joining the Guardians, being recruited to the X-Men, and as the American president.



          



Referencing the noise Howard makes, these are actually &#34;Waugh If...?&#34; stories, digging into the character&#39;s long history.

 Howard the Duck Was a Pioneer in Mainstream Satirical Comics 
          




 Character  Howard the Duck   Created by  Steve Gerber &amp; Val Mayerik   First Appearance  December 1973, Adventure Into Fear #19, &#34;The Enchanter&#39;s Apprentice&#34;   Powers  Martial Art Quak-Fu, Iron Duck armor, sharp tongue   



Howard the Duck was introduced in 1973&#39;s Adventure Into Fear #19, a straightforward horror anthology comic where readers also encountered demons, monsters, and Morbius the Living Vampire. In a story about an evil wizard collapsing realities, Korrek the Barbarian and Man-Thing fight to stop him and are greeted by someone from a more cartoony reality: the wisecracking Howard the Duck. Howard would continue to appear in side stories of Man-Thing&#39;s own series, going up against parody monsters like Garko the Man-Frog and Hellcow. He graduated to his own comic with Howard the Duck #1 in 1976, still being written by Steve Gerber, but illustrated by a variety of artists.

Because he was trapped in our reality, the slogan for his comic was &#34;Trapped in a world he never made!&#34;; hence, the subtitle on this special, &#34;Trapped in an Anniversary Celebration he wants no part of!&#34; Howard&#39;s stories parodied other Marvel characters and themes, with his appearance being contrasted against more realistic comic art. As creator Steve Gerber said in a 1977 interview, &#34;If Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote...If Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt.&#34; He often broke the fourth wall, with winks to the audience about this silly comic book universe, but was a participant in it just the same. Howard the Duck usually appears in other stories as an Easter egg for eagle-eyed fans; celebrating the many What Ifs of his silly career, like wielding the Infinity Gauntlet or becoming the Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;s new Star-Lord is an appropriate celebration of the character.




Howard the Duck #1 is available November 29 from Marvel Comics.

 Howard the Duck #1 (2023)                  Writers: Chip Zdarsky, Daniel Kibblesmith, Merritt K, and others   Artists: Chip Zdarsky, Joe Quinones, Will Robson, Annie Wu, and others   Colorists: Stacey Lee, Ian Herring, Pete Pantazis, and others   Letterer: VC&#39;s Travis Lanham   Cover Artists: Ed McGuinness &amp; Laura Martin (with Gil Kane &amp; Ernie Chan), Ron Lim &amp; Israel Silva, Joe Quinones &amp; Stacey Lee, Annie Wu, and Skottie Young
