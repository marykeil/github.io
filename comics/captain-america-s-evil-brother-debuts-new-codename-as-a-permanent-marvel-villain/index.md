## Literature Review

Uncanny Avengers #5 ends with the Unity Squad &#34;defeating&#34; evil Hydra Cap, revealing Grant escaped imprisonment and is Marvel&#39;s newest Flag-Smasher. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Uncanny Avengers #5While the new Unity Squad formed by Captain America succeeded in defeating Evil Hydra Cap in Uncanny Avengers #5, the Nazi leader has come out relatively unscathed, debuting himself to the world as Marvel’s newest Flag-Smasher. More dedicated to Orchis’ anti-mutant cause than ever and going by the name Grant Rogers, his freedom reinforces how twisted Marvel’s America has become, and the rising threat of Orchis across the world.




Captain America&#39;s impressive Unity Squad - made up of himself, Deadpool, Quicksilver, Penance, Psylocke, Rogue, and Black Widow - was able to stop Grant from detonating a nuclear bomb at Empire State University, while giving the evil version of Cap a much-deserved beatdown.

          

While the heroes were able to stop Hydra Cap&#39;s terrorist plot in Uncanny Avengers #5, from writer Gerry Duggan and artists Javier Garrón and Morry Hollowell, they were unable to stop the failure of a corrupt American justice system, which allowed Grant Rogers to go free after committing horrific crimes.


 Grant Rogers Is Marvel&#39;s New Anti-Mutant Flag-Smasher 
          




Marvel&#39;s America, and pretty much the entire world, is being subtly controlled by the forces of Orchis, who have used their Narrative Petal to push deep pro-Orchis and anti-mutant propaganda into an unsuspecting public. Dr. Stasis reported that they hold sway within the judiciary system, clearly evident by Grant - or &#34;Stevil&#34; to the Unity Squad - going free and being allowed to speak to his gathered fans. Grant&#39;s speech reaffirmed his dark anti-mutant sentiments, showing his dream that all mutants will die in terrible concentration camps, as well as the support his Nazi &#34;Secret Empire&#34; still has.

Now, Grant is calling himself the new &#34;Flag-Smasher,&#34; and is in an even better position to poison people to his anti-mutant &#34;pro-human&#34; perspective, since he is unmasked and exonerated. The original Flag-Smasher, Karl Morgenthau, became disillusioned with the world&#39;s governments after his father&#39;s death at a Latverian embassy, creating the terrorist organization U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. to fight nationalism across the world. Grant Rogers has a similar anti-nationalist stance after deciding America has not done enough to protect humanity from mutantkind and created the last iteration of U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. and Flag-Smasher - secretly an LMD - during his tenure as leader of the Secret Empire.






 Captain America&#39;s Unity Squad Won The Battle, Not The War 
          

Captain America&#39;s mutant-filled Unity Squad fulfilled their purpose, taking down the mysterious &#34;Captain Krakoa,&#34; helping Ben Urich release his story covering the truth of the Hellfire Gala, and putting a stop to one of Orchis&#39; many plans. However, by defeating and unmasking Grant Rogers, the Unity Squad may have won the battle but could have lost the war against Orchis. Now, Grant is more visible than ever, and could even reinstate U.L.T.I.M.A.T.U.M. as a center of operations for his evil machinations. Orchis may have an influential new public figurehead that will inspire even more humanity to reject mutantkind, contributing to the ongoing Fall of X by creating increasing instability and fear-mongering among humans.

Captain America&#39;s twisted twin is the most terrifying Flag-Smasher Marvel has ever had, a truly power-hungry and deranged Nazi who is not only an effective leader but a new voice for the anti-mutant sentiment already infecting the world. While Captain America&#39;s dark mirror may have been used by Orchis as a pawn against the X-Men, he is now a terrifying threat to the entire world and a permanent new supervillain that the heroes of Marvel will need to defeat if the world is ever to be truly safe again.




Uncanny Avengers #5 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
