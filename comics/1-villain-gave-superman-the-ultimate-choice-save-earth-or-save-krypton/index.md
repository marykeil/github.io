## Literature Review

Superman is a man of two worlds: he came from the planet Krypton. but he grew up on Earth. One villain once forced him to choose between his homes.




Superman has always been pulled between two worlds: his adopted home of Earth and Krypton, the planet he and his culture come from. Superman has tried over the years to balance these two heritages and find where he truly belongs, but one villain, Brainiac, tries to force the issue by making Superman choose between saving Earth or the last remnants of Krypton.




Superman must make this choice in Action Comics #7 by Grant Morrison, Rags Morales, Rick Bryant, Brad Anderson, and Patrick Brosseau. During DC&#39;s New 52 era, a lot of characters were re-imagined, and that includes Superman and his history. Clark finds himself completely unaware of his Kryptonian heritage, which he only learned after coming into contact with one of Brainiac&#39;s drones.



          

The drone has shrunk Metropolis, and Superman is faced with a choice when he arrives at the ship: either save the city of Metropolis and lose the last city of Krypton, Kandor, forever, or let Metropolis be taken and be given Kandor back.

 Brainiac Forces Superman to Choose Between Planets 


          

While Superman was born on Krypton, he grew up on Earth. He&#39;s always had a stronger connection to Earth than anywhere else in the universe, but he&#39;s never been able to shake his connection to Krypton either. Krypton was his entire culture and was home to people who could relate to him on a level that the people of Earth never could. As much as Superman wants to be part of humanity, he&#39;s always been a bit of an outsider, and that&#39;s why this choice is so devastating for him, especially since this is Superman&#39;s first time hearing about Krypton. But Superman still makes the only choice that he ever could: he saves both cities.

When faced with the impossible choice of either saving his found home or his original home, Superman does the unthinkable and saves both Metropolis and Kandor. Instead of giving in to Brainiac, who is trying to force him to pick between nature or nurture, Superman overpowers the drone and prevents Metropolis from being shrunk and added to Brainiac&#39;s collection. While Kandor remains shrunk, the drone does mention that it might be possible to undo it in the future. This solution perfectly encapsulates who Superman is as a hero: while he&#39;s a man of two worlds, he loves both equally, and when forced to pick between Earth or Krypton, he will always pick both.






 Superman Saves Both Planets in the End 
          

A core part of Superman&#39;s character is that he&#39;s an outsider to humanity. Despite how much Clark Kent truly wants to be part of the human race, he never will be, because he simply isn&#39;t human. This always makes him an outsider and has fed into his desire to be reunited with Krypton and learn about the culture and people he lost. But just because he&#39;s an outsider to humanity doesn&#39;t make him love it any less or make his connection to it any less real. When faced with his home planet and his birth planet, Superman will always find a way to save both — because he&#39;s a man of both worlds.
