## Literature Review

Batman and Superman are two of the most popular characters in comic books, and now they&#39;re going to prove they&#39;re the strongest characters too.

Batman and Superman have overcome ridiculous odds and difficult battles over the years, but their most difficult battle yet is going to be fighting the entire Justice League. There&#39;s no doubt that Batman and Superman are the most popular characters on the Justice League roster. But now the pair are going to have to prove that they&#39;re not just the most popular, they&#39;re also the strongest.

The battle between the Justice League and Batman and Superman will take place in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, Tamra Bonvillain, and Steve Wands. After being transported to the world of Kingdom Come, the two heroes are completely out of their depth.



          

Surprised by how different the world is, they quickly find out that this planet is being ruled by a being named Gog. To capture Batman and Superman and prevent his rule from being challenged, Gog has sent his Earth&#39;s version of the Justice League after them. The two heroes will now need to deal with the likes of Wonder Woman and Etrigan if they want to escape this dark Earth.




                  Every Hero Who&#39;s Dead in Iconic Kingdom Come Continuity, Confirmed by DC   Kingdom Come saw a lot of death play out over the course of its epic story, with DC finally confirming nearly every hero who died by the end of it.   


 Batman and Superman Prepare to Take On the Justice League 
         

It&#39;s no secret that Batman has contingency plans for every member of the Justice League. It&#39;s one of the things that makes Batman so dangerous and, in the past, his plans have been used to take down the League one by one. Batman has even been shown capable of building androids that can handle the entire Justice League, such as with Failsafe. Likewise, Superman is one of the outright most powerful members of the Justice League in terms of sheer strength. This means that if push came to shove, Superman could likely take on several League members at once and come out the victor. But in this situation, Batman doesn&#39;t have access to his contingency plans and Superman can&#39;t fight the Justice League one member at a time, meaning they&#39;ll need to team up to survive.




With Batman&#39;s brilliance and Superman&#39;s raw strength, the two might just be able to beat the League on their own. Currently, it seems that Batman and Superman are going to try their best to retreat, but with the entire planet under the sway of Gog, if they want any hope of winning, they will eventually need to get past Gog&#39;s Justice League. Batman will most likely need to direct Superman to take down certain League members in a certain order. With Superman&#39;s vast array of powers, he could likely recreate most of Batman&#39;s contingency plans. Batman and Superman have been through a lot, but Kingdom Come is going to be Batman and Superman&#39;s most dangerous challenge yet.



 Superman and Batman Are On Their Own Against Every DC Hero 
          

There have been plenty of evil versions of heroes that Batman and Superman have had to fight, but rarely have they had to fight an entire Justice League roster worth of heroes. While they have gone up against things like the Crime Syndicate, that&#39;s usually a fairly small team. The actual Justice League&#39;s full roster can have upwards of 20 members at a time, and for Batman and Superman to prove they&#39;re the strongest members of the Justice League, they&#39;re going to have to beat every single hero.






Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 is on sale December 19 from DC Comics!
