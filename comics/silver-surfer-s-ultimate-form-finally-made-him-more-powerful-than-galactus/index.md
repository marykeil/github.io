# Silver Surfer s Ultimate Form Finally Made Him More Powerful Than Galactus


## SUMMARY 



  Timeslip was a &#39;90s initiative to reimagine Marvel characters, including Silver Surfer and Galactus.   In this reality, Silver Surfer assembles a weapon to kill Galactus, but then discovers he must replace his former master.   The guilt destroys Silver Surfer, turning him into an inhuman force of destruction who splits planets in two with his new, blade-like board.

## Literature Review

When Silver Surfer finally found a way to kill Galactus, he had to become something even worse to keep the universe from collapsing.




The Silver Surfer is one of Marvel&#39;s most tragic heroes - a heroic adventurer who sold his soul to protect his world, becoming the herald of the planet-devouring force of nature known as Galactus. However, it turns out that things could have gone far, far worse for Norrin Radd.




In the late &#39;90s, Marvel asked a question - what would its most iconic heroes look like if the most popular artists of the day had co-created them with Stan Lee? The answer was Timeslip - an initiative where acclaimed artists reimagined major characters from first principles. Everyone from Doctor Doom and the Fantastic Four to X-Men&#39;s Colossus to the master assassin Elektra was reimagined - often with a new story to go with their transformed design.



          

In the case of Silver Surfer, Bone&#39;s Jeff Smith became the alien hero&#39;s &#39;co-creator,&#39; giving Norrin Radd a startling new look to go with a dark new purpose in the universe.

Jeff Smith&#39;s Silver Surfer starts life in the same way - volunteering to serve Galactus in order to save his home planet, then continuing as his herald only to later rebel. However, this Norrin Radd is far more crafty. Rather than rebelling against Galactus for love of Earth, he plays the long game, gathering materials from each planet his master devours. Eventually, Silver Surfer has created a weapon capable of destroying Galactus - only to learn the cosmic predator is a vital force in the universal order.

Knowing the universe needs a Galactus, Silver Surfer absorbs his master&#39;s ship and replaces him, with his iconic board becoming a blade-like craft that slices worlds in two. Worse, Silver Surfer&#39;s consciousness eventually collapses under the weight of his guilt, and the Power Cosmic transforms him into an emaciated, inhuman form, leaving him sailing through the spaceways as a pure force of destruction. While Galactus needed complex machinery to destroy worlds and could be persuaded to spare certain planets, the Silver Surfer&#39;s final form simply destroys whatever it encounters in a single apocalyptic moment.

The Timeslip initiative also took on Silver Surfer&#39;s master Galactus, with Scott McDaniel (Nightwing, Green Arrow) turning Galan of Taa into a squid-like B Movie monstrosity, with the tagline &#34;The Thing That Ate the World!&#34; In McDaniel&#39;s version, Galactus is too inhuman to take on a herald, and simply scours the Earth with nothing to stop it. It&#39;s interesting to see characters who are particularly defined by a flickering ember of humanity become fully monstrous, however the Silver Surfer is a far more chilling figure, as his new form makes it clear quite how much he has lost. The glowing projection of his face turns the Surfer and his deadly ship into a single entity, while it&#39;s immediately apparent from his appearance exactly how he destroys planet after planet.






Timeslip&#39;s Galactus and Silver Surfer could never exist in Marvel&#39;s mainstream reality...

In many cases, Timeslip was just a fun new take on existing characters, but for Silver Surfer and Galactus, it turned out to predict the future. When the two were reimagined in Marvel&#39;s 2000s-era Ultimate Universe, Galactus became a cloud of squid-like ships that were truly terrifying in their humanity, while the Silver Surfer was no longer a single being, but an army of morphing, angel-like creatures who came to Earth to pacify humanity via an underground cult.

Ultimately, Marvel Comics&#39; characters are defined by longevity - while different creative teams may fashion an &#39;ending&#39; for a particular run, Marvel&#39;s heroes and villains eventually revert to a status quo that allows for more stories to be told. That approach means that Timeslip&#39;s Galactus and Silver Surfer could never quite exist in Marvel&#39;s mainstream reality, and yet there&#39;s something undeniably compelling about taking the publisher&#39;s conflicted, technically-humanoid forces of destruction and making them truly alien.
