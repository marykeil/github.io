## Literature Review

DC has revealed Batman: Dark Age, a spin-off of Superman: Space Age that digs into the beloved hero and examines how he’s been shaped by culture.




A new story is taking a look at Batman to explore the hero&#39;s place in contemporary culture. A glimpse into the new year&#39;s offerings has revealed Batman: Dark Age, a successor to last year&#39;s Superman: Space Age. Like the previous story, this new tale integrates historical events to create a contemplative new story for a comic book icon.




DC Comics has released details on Batman: Dark Age, a new six-issue miniseries by Mark Russell and Mike Allred. The book spins out of Russell and Allred&#39;s Superman: Space Age and instead follows Batman in an origin story set against the backdrop of real-world historical events. Batman: Dark Age won&#39;t just follow the Dark Knight alongside actual cultural milestones, but many other iconic characters that have fought with him and against him. The first issue comes with a standard cover by series&#39; artist Mike Allred, with variant covers provided by Yanick Paquette and Frank Quietly.



          



  Batman: Dark Age #1   Release Date: 3/26/24   Writer: Mark Russel   Artist: Mike Allred   Cover Artist: Mike Allred   Variant Cover Artists: Yanick Paquette and Frank Quitely   Plot: Meet Bruce Wayne, Gotham’s favorite delinquent son. In an origin story like no other, witness the boy become a dark knight shaped by a city in turmoil as it marches towards its prophesied doom. Set against the backdrop of actual historical events, Gotham comes alive, filled with the iconic characters who’ve loved and hated Batman over the years like you’ve never seen them before. Spinning out of the Eisner-nominated Superman: Space Age, Mark Russell and Mike Allred return to give audiences a look at Batman as a figure in American history fighting for justice in a world gone mad.  





 Batman: Dark Age Examines the Hero&#39;s Place in History 


          

The previous series Superman: Space Age was an out-of-continuity story that followed Clark Kent from the &#39;60s through the &#39;80s. The story explored Superman and his desire to save a world that became increasingly darker and more devoid of hope. Even as Clark began finding new heroes and building the Justice League, he lived under the threats of the mysterious Pariah, who warned of the dark days that lay ahead for humanity. The period piece used numerous events from real-world history to tell its story including the Space Race, the assassination of President Kennedy, and the Cold War, all of which shaped and informed Clark&#39;s growth and development as Superman.

Batman was a main character in the Superman: Space Age, but this book will give him a greater focus than the last series. While Space Age covered several decades of world history, there&#39;s plenty of ground left to cover and no limit to the number of historical events that could influence this particular take on Batman. Russell and Allred&#39;s previous Eisner-nominated series was a thoughtful book that really dug into the Man of Steel and showcased how culture shaped him over the years. Dark Age looks like it will do the same thing for Batman and give readers a much more unique and pensive examination of what makes the Dark Knight tick.






 What Batman: Dark Age Will Do Differently Than Other Stories 


          

In the near century the character has been around, Batman has been the subject of numerous stories that get to the core of what defines him. If Batman: Dark Age is anything like its sister series, it will also dig deep into the character while telling a parallel story about the growth of America and world culture. Together, the story will potentially craft a poignant, if not a bit meta, thought piece that shows how a character like Batman grew into the changing, but ever-present symbol he is today.

Batman: Dark Age #1 will be available from DC Comics on March 26th, 2024.
