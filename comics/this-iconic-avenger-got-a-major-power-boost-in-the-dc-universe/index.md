## Literature Review

The Scarlet Witch is one of the most powerful characters in the Marvel Universe, and as it turns out, she is even stronger in DC&#39;s Universe.




Scarlet Witch is without a doubt one of the most powerful magic users ever seen in comic books, and it seems that she is so powerful that it doesn&#39;t even matter what comic line she&#39;s in. When she&#39;s in her home universe of Marvel, she&#39;s gifted with absurdly powerful reality-bending powers, and during a brief spell when she found herself in the DC Universe, she was somehow even more powerful.




JLA/Avengers #2 – by Kurt Busiek, George Perez, Tom Smith, and Comicraft – continued the major crossover event between DC and Marvel Comics two most renowned teams, during which readers witnessed the full extent of Scarlet Witch&#39;s potential. As the Justice League and Avengers began to battle one another, Scarlet Witch managed to tap into the chaos magic of the DC Universe, and as a result, was filled with more power than she&#39;d ever felt before.



          

Considering just how powerful Scarlet Witch is in her home dimension, her statement that DC&#39;s magic is even &#34;more wild and powerful&#34; was a major testament to just how much of a power boost she received.

                  8 Scarlet Witch Powers Still Missing From The MCU   Although Scarlet Witch has displayed a wide variety of magical powers in the MCU, she still hasn&#39;t developed several abilities from the comics.   





 DC Universe Magic Elevated Scarlet Witch To An Entirely New Power Level 


          

Scarlet Witch is a focal point of magic in the Marvel Universe and can tap many different powers. While she draws her strength primarily from Cthon, she can also draw magic from several other beings, making Wanda ridiculously versatile. These rules seem to hold true for when she&#39;s in another universe. Though she could not initially cast hexes like she usually does, she quickly figured out DC&#39;s magic and managed to tap into that instead. In JLA/Avengers #2, Wanda stated that DC&#39;s version of chaos magic is far more &#34;wild and powerful&#34; than anything she&#39;s felt before, and considering she&#39;s capable of rewriting reality in the Marvel Universe, that speaks volumes.

The DC Universe generally seems to be filled with more powerful beings and artifacts than the Marvel Universe, a fact Superman comments on while battling Thor. As powerful as Wanda is in the Marvel Universe, DC&#39;s magic elevates her to the next level. Wanda gains the ability to sense artifacts of great power, regardless of their origin, and she&#39;s able to teleport her allies anywhere on the planet. She uses this power to outmaneuver the Justice League, and she is pivotal in collecting the artifacts needed to win the contest at the heart of JLA/Avengers. Even after returning to the Marvel Universe, she states she misses the power of DC.






 Wanda Is One Of The Most Powerful Magic Users In Any Universe She Is In 


          

Transposing a character into an entirely different fictional universe can have varied results, for better or worse. Flash found himself completely powerless in the Marvel Universe due to the lack of a speed force. Darkseid found the Infinity Gems useless, due to them being outside their universe of origin. The Scarlet Witch, an already absurdly powerful sorceress, found herself more powerful than she&#39;d ever been before. While it&#39;s unclear exactly what would happen to Wanda if she continued using DC&#39;s chaos magic, as she stated she felt her soul and mind were being corrupted, there&#39;s no denying that no matter what universe Scarlet Witch is in, she&#39;s going to be among the most powerful magic users there.



JLA/Avengers #2 is available now from DC and Marvel Comics!
