## Literature Review

As the X-Men&#39;s villains turn their attention to Marvel&#39;s other heroes, Reed Richards pays a high price for being the smartest man on Earth.




Warning: spoilers for Rise of the Powers of X #1!As Rise of the Powers of X follows the X-Men in their final battle against the AI god known as the Dominion, the story reveals the horrifying final fate of Reed Richards. The anti-mutant extremists of Orchis have been targeting mutantkind for the last few years, but they always intended to attack Marvel&#39;s other superhumans once the X-Men were dealt with. That includes the World&#39;s Smartest Man, as the former Mister Fantastic suffers a fate worse than death.






Reed has suffered centuries of torture - all of it alongside his daughter.




Rise of the Powers of X #1 is set ten years after the X-Men lost their war against Orchis, jumping forward in time to depict the arrival of the Dominion - a godlike artificial intelligence which will massacre all biological life. However, the mutants aren&#39;t the only ones fighting to survive. The human members of Orchis - now supplanted by the robots they once considered allies - have their own anti-Dominion measures in place, and the villainous Doctor Stasis reveals his ace in the hole: a &#39;Supreme Intelligence&#39; supercomputer in which he has trapped the minds of Tony Stark, Adam Brashear, Bruce Banner, Shuri, Reed Richards and - most tragically of all - Reed&#39;s daughter, Valeria Richards.



          




Not only have these heroes been trapped by Stasis, but he has hidden them within the Vault - a technological bunker in which time passes at a far faster rate. While it&#39;s been a decade out in the real world, within the Vault Reed has suffered centuries of torture - all of it alongside his daughter.

 Reed Richards Becomes a New Supreme Intelligence 
Mister Fantastic Has His Mind Combined with Marvel&#39;s 5 Smartest Heroes
         

The Supreme Intelligence is a piece of Kree technology created when the minds of multiple beings are assimilated into an alien supercomputer. In Marvel lore, the Supreme Intelligence - or Supremor - was devised by the Kree as part of their plan to create a Cosmic Cube, but gained individual sentience and instead took over, becoming the ruler of their planet-spanning society. The Kree Supreme Intelligence is made up of thousands of scientists, philosophers, diplomats and generals, with their wisdom combined into the singular Supreme Intelligence. However, the Supreme Intelligence is ultimately a form of technology, and there have been others in Marvel history - each created by trapping genius individuals in this immortal prison.




It seems that in the days following Orchis&#39; defeat of the X-Men, Stasis captured the world&#39;s greatest geniuses and created his own Supreme Intelligence using their minds. This would have been easy after the fall of the X-Men, given the resources Orchis had at their disposal as well as the public support they had drummed up by vilifying mutants. Stasis then hid his super-computer away, tasking it with coming up with a plan to kill the Dominion that he had realized his robot allies were summoning to Earth. In the issue, Reed&#39;s genius doesn&#39;t let Stasis down, as the Supreme Intelligence devises an anti-matter bomb that poisons the Dominion&#39;s mind, leaving it weak enough for Stasis to steal its power.



While Tony Stark is shown within the new Supreme Intelligence, a friendly AI copy of Iron Man is fighting alongside the X-Men to defeat the Dominion, having been downloaded into his Mark Nil armor.






 This Isn&#39;t the First Time Reed Has Died to Feed a Supreme Intelligence 
Mister Fantastic Seems Destined to Have His Genius Stolen
         




Disturbingly, Reed Richards has been consumed by a Supreme Intelligence before - or at least versions of him have. After meeting the multiversal group known as the Council of Reeds - alternate reality versions of Reed Richards who left their own realities behind to &#39;solve everything&#39; - the original Reed came into conflict with a handful of the group who ended up stranded on Earth. These other Reeds tried to sacrifice the planet in order to regain their former power, but were defeated when Ronan the Accuser fed them to a new Supreme Intelligence, believing his people needed Reed&#39;s genius to lead them (in Jonathan Hickman and Barry Kitson&#39;s FF #11).

Hickman and Sean Chen&#39;s Dark Reign: Fantastic Four also saw the Fantastic Four visit a reality where Reed has become the Supreme Intelligence. Similarly, the Skrull Empire cloned and killed hundreds of Reeds prior to Secret Invasion, forcing Mister Fantastic to figure out a way to permanently mask their shapeshifting from Earth technology (as seen in Brian Michael Bendis and Billy Tan&#39;s New Avengers #44.) It&#39;s worth noting that two of these stories were written by the architect of the X-Men&#39;s modern Krakoan Era, Jonathan Hickman.




When comics repeat deaths for different versions of the same character, it begins to hint that their end isn&#39;t a coincidence, but rather their multiversal fate. It&#39;s certainly an ironic death for Reed, as his genius condemns him to a living death - too useful to actually destroy, too dangerous to ever free. And while it&#39;s possible the X-Men will later rewrite the timeline to prevent the events of Rise of the Powers of X, this future still took place in the Marvel Universe fans know and love, and Reed still experienced centuries of torment.



It&#39;s possible to read the Supreme Intelligence as a comment on creators being forced to endure inhumane working conditions, and the way that competing with &#39;AI art&#39; could make that far worse.






 Reed Richards&#39; Fate Is a Bold Statement About AI Art 
Marvel&#39;s AI Villains Make a Statement About Machine Learning&#39;s Place in the Industry
         




However, Reed&#39;s fate isn&#39;t just a statement about how valuable his mind is. Rise of the Powers of X has made it very clear that one of the themes it&#39;s exploring is &#39;AI art&#39; - the growing trend of machine learning technology which allows the generation of new images. The subject is a hot button issue in comics, where there&#39;s immense concern that publishers will use machine learning to replace real creators. Indeed, while gazing at Reed, Stasis comments:


A.I. can&#39;t have ideas, not really. All they do is iterate what has been done before.


More explicitly, in an interview with AIPT, writer Kieron Gillen says:


This was already in Jon&#39;s planning with Dominions - they&#39;re literally machines that are formed of the intelligence they&#39;ve consumed, a clear analogy of how [machine learning] models are made. Certainly when I&#39;m writing them, I&#39;m using language that evokes current language in AI. I did think there was an outside shot that Disney sacks all of us when the Krakoan age is over, and Tom&#39;s new team is just a bunch of ChatGPT scripts. AI did win after all.





While the Supreme Intelligence isn&#39;t presented as the same type of AI as Orchis&#39; machine overlords, it does follow the same logic of absorbing real people, then using their genius to create something against their will. It&#39;s also possible to read Stasis&#39; Supreme Intelligence as a comment on a parallel issue - real creators being forced to endure inhumane working conditions, and the way that competing with machine learning technology could make that far worse. While much debate about generative machine learning is about comic creators being outright replaced, there&#39;s also concern that in order to compete with algorithmically generated content, creators will be forced to take worse deals and sacrifice existing rights - all in an industry that&#39;s already famous for giving writers and artists a raw deal.

Marvel&#39;s greatest genius being turned into an unwilling cog in Doctor Stasis&#39; machine is a potent metaphor for everything creators fear about the increased use of machine learning in art, as well as a chilling vision of Orchis&#39; supreme victory over the X-Men. Of course, it&#39;s also a fittingly ironic end for Reed Richards - imprisoned and tortured by villains who see his world-class genius as a resource they can&#39;t afford to waste.




Rise of the Powers of X #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
