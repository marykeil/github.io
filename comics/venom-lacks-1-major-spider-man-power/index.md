# Venom Lacks 1 Major Spider-Man Power


## SUMMARY 



  Venom&#39;s original bond with Spider-Man gave him many of Spidey&#39;s abilities, except for his crucial Spider-Sense.   Venom&#39;s lack of Spider-Sense leaves him vulnerable to sneak attacks, as shown when Black Cat was able to follow and strike him without detection in Venom Annual (2018) #1,   Despite Venom&#39;s strength and other powers, the absence of Spider-Sense is a major weakness in his defense, making him susceptible to being caught off guard.

## Literature Review

The Venom symbiote absorbed a ton of powers from its time bonded with Spider-Man, but it lacks one of the Webslinger&#39;s most useful abilities.




The Venom symbiote&#39;s original bond with Spider-Man resulted in subsequent incarnations of the character retaining a lot of the Webslinger&#39;s most iconic abilities – but to his detriment, he did not retain Spider-Man&#39;s most useful abilitiy, his Spider-Sense. Arguably the most iconic and most powerful ability in Spider-Man&#39;s arsenal is the one ability that the symbiote was completely unable to copy. This has left Venom having a rather glaring weakness.




Venom Annual (2018) #1 contained the story &#34;Round Two&#34; – written by David Michiline, with art by Ron Lim, Scott Hanna, and Rachelle Rosenberg – first exposed this critical weakness. When Black Cat wanted to get revenge on Venom, she tailed him through the city; Black Cat herself admitted this was only possible due to Venom lacking Spider-Sense. This not only allowed Black Cat to follow Venom, but also to sneak up on him and hit him when he wasn&#39;t looking.



          

For all the powers that Venom has, for how dangerous he can be, the fact anyone can sneak up hit him is a major glaring weakness in his arsenal.

                  Venom&#39;s Resurrection Powers are The Most Underrated Ability in Marvel   The symbiotes of the Marvel Universe have a ton of unique abilities, but few fans know that symbiotes can technically resurrect people.   





 Black Cat Is Able To Sneak Up On Venom 


          

Following the Venom symbiote initial bonding with Spider-Man, it remembered a lot of his abilities. Peter Parker is without a doubt the most influential host the Venom symbiote has ever had. While Eddie Brock has become synonymous with the symbiote, he has been the beneficiary of abilities inherited from Spidey. It is because it first bonded with Peter that the symbiote is capable of doing half the stuff it does. It&#39;s because of Peter, the symbiote can shoot out webbing and stick to walls, all classic abilities that other Venom hosts have used in the past. However, the one major ability that the symbiote simply couldn&#39;t copy was Peter&#39;s Spider-Sense.

Without Spider-Sense, Venom has a huge gap in his defenses. Interestingly, the Venom symbiote, of course, remembers Peter&#39;s Spider-Sense, as it is immune to Peter&#39;s Spider-Sense; however, this didn&#39;t grant Venom the sense itself. This only let Venom sneak up on Spider-Man specifically. Venom can&#39;t prevent people from sneaking up on him in the same way. As readers discovered in Venom Annual #1, Black Cat was fully capable of sneaking up on Venom, and landing a strike on him before he can react. Considering symbiotes have pre-defined weaknesses such as fire and sound, it&#39;s a problem that anyone could sneak up on Venom at any time.






 Venom Has A Huge Gap In His Defenses 


          

Venom is an immensely dangerous character. He&#39;s strong enough to fight Juggernaut, surprisingly fast, and has good ranged options with his webbings, one of the key powers that he did inherit from Spider-Man. Despite all of this, Venom has the huge glaring weakness of constantly needing to be aware of his surroundings, lacking the extra sense that has saved Peter Parker from countless threats. Spider-Man is able to react to things almost instantly, and it&#39;s saved him more times than anyone can count. Venom doesn&#39;t have this luxury though, for all the powers the symbiote absorbed from Spider-Man, the iconic Spider-Sense just isn&#39;t something that Venom managed to get.
