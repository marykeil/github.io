Warning: contains spoilers for Star Trek #15!




Star Trek’s Harry Kim admits that serving on Voyager nearly destroyed his Starfleet career. Harry Kim, Voyager’s former Operations Officer, has returned to the franchise spotlight in IDW’s flagship Star Trek comic. Now a Starfleet operative working on the Tzenkethi homeworld, Harry Kim has at last found himself, but in issue 15, he reveals why he took this bold new assignment, and it all goes back to his time on Voyager.

Star Trek #15 is written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Marcus To. Harry and his best friend Tom Paris have a heart-to-heart talk. Tom is curious about Harry’s new outlook, and Harry informs him that serving on Voyager was part of the reason. On board the ship, Harry encountered some of the biggest threats the galaxy had to offer, and serving on other ships later felt like he was “playing in the minor leagues.”

          




Seeking to reenter the “majors,” he took the job as a Starfleet operative.


 Harry Kim Has Come a Long Way...Literally and Figuratively 
          

Played by actor Garrett Wang, Harry Kim was Voyager’s perpetual ensign, never once receiving a promotion during his time on board. This made Harry something of a punchline in Star Trek fandom. Recently, however, Harry has shown a more badass side to himself. Sisko and the crew of the Theseus have been tasked by Starfleet to investigate an uprising on the Tzenkethi’s home world. Starfleet learned of the uprising thanks to Harry, who was stationed on the planet in a hidden base, and assigned Sisko to work with him. It was a reunion of sorts with Tom Paris, who Harry had not seen in a while.



Harry Kim was nearly written off Voyager after its fourth season







Harry Kim’s time on Voyager nearly ruined him with the rest of Starfleet. After seven years roaming the Delta Quadrant, facing down the likes of the Borg, the Hirogen and Species 8472, an assignment on another ship would seem calm. Harry expresses surprise that he survived the ordeal, but it was indispensable to his growth as an officer. Harry saw sights that would chill the blood of most Starfleet officers, and it showed him there was a bigger galaxy out there. He felt he was being wasted on other ships, and thus sought to become a Starfleet operative.

                  Star Trek Finds a New Way to Continue Voyager&#39;s Mockery of Harry Kim   Throughout Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s seven seasons, Harry Kim was an eternal ensign, and now a new Star Trek comic continues this mockery.   



 Harry Kim&#39;s Time Has Come at Last 
          




Now, as a crisis looms on the Tzenkethi homeworld, Harry is finally getting to show what he is made of. Harry tells Tom, who is clearly taken aback by his friend’s transformation, that he is no longer “the green kid” that Quark nearly hustled. That scene, in Star Trek: Voyager’s first episode, showed just how naive Harry was, but all of that is now gone, as he is playing a critical role in Starfleet’s operations with the Tzenkethi. Harry’s time on Voyager nearly ruined him on Starfleet, but it also gave him the drive to better himself.

Star Trek #15 is on sale now from IDW Publishing!
