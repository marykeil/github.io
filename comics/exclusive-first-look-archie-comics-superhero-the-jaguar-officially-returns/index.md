## Literature Review

Archie Comics is bringing back its Silver Age superhero, The Jaguar, as a new character takes up the mantle in an upcoming one-shot for early 2024.




Screen Rant is excited to share an exclusive first look at The Jaguar #1 from Archie Comics, as well as quotes from the creative team. This one-shot comic will serve as a followup to the titular heroine&#39;s 2012 debut and continue the legacy of the Jaguar. The mantle has been passed down for a new generation to continue enjoying the hero, who debuted in the Silver Age of comics.




The Jaguar #1 has the creative team of Keryl Brown Ahmed, Tango, Ellie Wright, and Jack Morelli. The heroic mantle is now being worn by Ivette Velez, a zoologist whose newest adventure will take her to Peru. She debuted in the 2012 comic series, New Crusaders, in a story created by Ian Flynn and Ben Bates. The original character, whose alter ego is Ralph Hardy, was introduced in 1961, in the pages of Adventures of the Jaguar #1.



          

 This story from Robert Bernstein and John Rosenberger, featured Ralph Hardy - an archaeologist and zoologist - finding a magical totem in Peru. It granted him animalistic powers and senses. Now, his successor, Ivette, will follow in his footsteps with a similar origin story.

In The Jaguar #1, Ivette &#34;will investigate a mysterious predator killing off wild cats, but she soon finds herself in its sights instead.&#34; This one-shot issue from Archie Comics will not only bring the character back for long-term fans, but will also serve as a perfect introduction for a new generation of comic readers. The blend of past and modern comic storytelling is very evident in the inks and covers shared above, as well as in the Jaguar&#39;s costume design. The overall look is a beautiful revitalization, giving the character new life and a distinct identity. Red and yellow tones have been maintained, as well as the yellow-jaguar-spot accents on the mask and collar. The suit is also broken up with black sections, giving it a more modern look than the original almost full-red suit.

Archie Comics has gradually been bringing back some of its older characters, particularly superheroes. Bob Phantom returned in 2022 with writer James III, as part of the Mighty Crusaders revival. Darkling returned to the Archie Horror label in November 2023 with writer Sarah Kuhn. The publisher has also been revisiting Sabrina the Teenage Witch&#39;s many facets and bringing back Madam Satan, calling back to its older comic titles and characters in fun new ways. The Jaguar will be the latest to be added back to the Archie Comics fold for today&#39;s comic audience. With a wealth of history, it&#39;s intriguing to see the recent and future slate of offerings from the publisher.






 The Jaguar&#39;s Creative Team Shares Behind-the-Scenes Details of Upcoming Series 


          

Keryl Brown Ahmed, writer of The Jaguar says:


&#34;I hoped setting the story in ancient Peruvian ruins would make it visually compelling, and Tango delivered big time! I absolutely love the feel of the comic and particularly the visual nods to Moche culture, like the enormous mural Tango created on page 6. I might need to frame that panel and put it on my wall! Tango&#39;s ability to draw such layered, dynamic action really makes the story jump off the page in a way that&#39;s sure to resonate with readers.&#34;


Tango, the series&#39; artist, adds:


&#34;It&#39;s always a challenge with legacy characters because you want to pay homage to the core of what made the character enduring and build from that foundation. For me that meant leaning more heavily on the hallmarks of great classic superhero visual storytelling -- a strong focus on silhouettes, shadows, and composition.&#34;





The Jaguar #1 will be available February 21, 2024 from Archie Comics.
