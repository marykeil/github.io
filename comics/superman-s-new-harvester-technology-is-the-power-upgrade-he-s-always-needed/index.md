## Literature Review

The game has changed for Superman thanks to Steel’s latest invention: A machine that speeds up Clark’s recovery time by hitting him with solar energy.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1059!Thanks to a few allies, Superman finally has the asset that will make him virtually unstoppable. The Man of Steel is mighty, but even he can&#39;t avoid being depowered by crafty villains. However, that may be a thing of the past thanks to John Henry Irons, aka Steel&#39;s latest invention.




In Action Comics #1059 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows and Eber Ferreira, a newly empowered Blue Earth is patrolling Metropolis, violently apprehending criminals. However, Superman arrives wearing his new set of armor and, with the help help of Superman&#39;s family, drives off the fascist protectors.

          

After the battle, Superman returns to Steelworks where he&#39;s testing out Steel&#39;s new Harvester technology. John and his niece Natasha Irons have created a series of orbital satellites that store solar energy to reenergize Superman when his powers aren&#39;t working correctly. While Clark doesn&#39;t have time for a full recharge, he has enough power to assist with the cleanup caused by his fight with Blue Earth.


 Steel&#39;s New Harvester Technology Can Recharge Supeman&#39;s Strength 


          




Superman has faced tough odds before but Blue Earth and its leader Norah Stone have been proving challenging. Stone&#39;s Blue Earth is a terrorist group that has violently opposed the influx of aliens Superman liberated from Warworld. Clark interviewed Stone to explain her side of the story, only for Norah to use a magic relic to steal Superman&#39;s power. Norah transferred the relic to her assistant Dorian, who not only stole Superman&#39;s strength but his image as well. Clark was able to beat his doppelganger, but he was left weak and seriously injured from the fight.

Unfortunately, Superman losing his powers isn&#39;t exactly an uncommon occurrence. Magic has always been a thorn in the Man of Tomorrow&#39;s side, as are the various forms of kryptonite that rob him of strength and speed. Not to mention Superman can burn himself out if he uses some of his more powerful moves like his rarely-seen solar flare ability. While the DC Universe has no short supply of Kryptonians to help safeguard the world, it&#39;s not wise for Clark to spend much time without his powers. Thankfully, John and Natasha have created a fantastic means of helping Superman regain his full strength much faster than before.






 Superman&#39;s Cooldown Period is Shorter Than Ever 


          

Steel has always come through for Superman with his inventions, but this newest one has to be the best helping hand Clark&#39;s hand in a while. No matter how Superman loses his powers, whether it&#39;s caused by a villain or his own actions, Clark has a way of minimizing his recovery time so he can get back into fighting shape. Granted it&#39;s not an instant fix and the Harvester does take awhile to recharge Clark. But rather than waiting for an indeterminate amount of time, Superman can regenerate his powers at a much faster rate than he naturally could.

Action Comics #1059 is on sale now from DC Comics.
