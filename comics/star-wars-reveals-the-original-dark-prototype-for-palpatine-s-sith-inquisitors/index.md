# Star Wars Reveals The Original Dark Prototype for Palpatine s Sith Inquisitors


## SUMMARY 



  Star Wars reveals the dark prototype for Palpatine&#39;s Inquisitors: Jedi who were corrupted and used by the Nihil.   The Nihil, like the Empire, recruited fallen Jedi who held actual power and played a significant role in their evil efforts.   The fallen Jedi of the High Republic era were a precursor to Palpatine&#39;s Inquisitors, with the same level of authority and skill in the dark side of the Force.

## Literature Review

Emperor Palpatine corrupted many Jedi and turned them into his Inquisitors, but another Star Wars villain did the exact same thing centuries before. 




Warning: SPOILERS for Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures - After the Fall #1 When Emperor Palpatine toppled the Jedi Order to more easily mold the Republic into the Galactic Empire, he didn’t just have every Jedi/Force-sensitive person in the Star Wars galaxy killed. Just like with the Republic itself, Palpatine also molded a number of especially vulnerable Jedi/Force-sensitives into unrecognizably corrupt versions of themselves: the Inquisitors. And now, it’s revealed that Palpatine wasn’t the first villain to have this idea, as Star Wars just revealed the dark prototype for Emperor Palpatine’s Inquisitors.




The Inquisitors made their Star Wars debut in the animated series Star Wars: Rebels. They were dark side users who worked directly under Darth Vader and carried out the bidding of the Emperor. A precise number of Inquisitors was never given, and still remains a mystery to this day. However, what isn’t a mystery is where at least some of them were recruited from, as that question was answered in the live-action Star Wars series, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

          

Reva Sevander aka the Third Sister was a Youngling who survived Darth Vader’s attack on the Jedi Temple during Order 66. That experience filled her with hatred and a thirst for vengeance, which made her strong in the dark side. But beyond that, her previously established aptitude in the Force as a Jedi Youngling made Reva (and many others like her) a perfect candidate for Palpatine’s own squadron of Force-sensitive soldiers. And during the age of the High Republic, the Nihil had the exact same idea.





 Star Wars’ Nihil Used Jedi Just Like Emperor Palpatine 
         

In Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures - After the Fall #1 by Daniel José Older, Harvey Tolibao and Nick Brokenshire, the Jedi are still reeling one year after the destruction of Starlight Beacon by the hands of the Nihil. The Nihil were a collective of marauders and anarchists who managed to organize into an actual threat to the Republic. The Nihil destroyed Starlight Beacon - which was a space station based in the outer rim meant to include often forgotten systems - and then claimed a large portion of galactic space.

This attack on the Republic resulted in an immense loss of life, both civilian and Jedi alike. However, not every Jedi who was presumed dead actually was, as at least one was taken in by the Nihil and used not just as a soldier, but as a warlord.






 Fallen Jedi Held Actual Power With The Nihil, Just LIke With The Empire 
          

The Imperial Inquisitors may have seemed weak or unimportant when compared to the likes of Darth Vader or the Emperor, but in the grand hierarchy of the Galactic Empire, there are few people who held their level of power. Not only were they incredibly skilled in the dark side of the Force - skilled enough to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Ahsoka Tano and Darth Maul - but they also had the authority of a high ranking officer. There were far more people beneath them in the Imperial hierarchy than there were above them, and the same can be said for the Jedi that was recruited by the Nihil in this High Republic Adventures issue. The fallen Jedi, named Lula, ran her own Nihil outpost on a populated moon within Republic-controlled space, meaning she was a significant aspect of Nihil expansion.




Lula wasn’t just a brainwashed Jedi used in combat like a droid would be, she played a vital role in the Nihil’s evil efforts to conquer the galaxy. In other words, she and other fallen Jedi of the High Republic era were something of a dark prototype for Emperor Palpatine’s Inquisitors in Star Wars canon.

Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures - After the Fall #1 by Dark Horse Comics is available now.
