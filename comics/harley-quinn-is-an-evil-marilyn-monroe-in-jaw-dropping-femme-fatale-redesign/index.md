## Literature Review

Beautiful new cover artwork by Jenny Frison has given Harley Quinn a Marilyn Monroe-inspired femme fatale look, and it&#39;s absolutely breathtaking.




This Harley Quinn redesign has turned her into a jaw-dropping femme fatale, inspired by Marilyn Monroe. When it comes to DC&#39;s redesigns, Harley Quinn continues to reign supreme, with some of the best new looks of any hero or villain. Now, she has received her most stunning look yet, in an incredible artistic homage to Hollywood legend Marilyn Monroe.




As previewed by League of Comic Geeks, The final issue of the anthology series Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder – featuring stories by Tini Howard, Babs Tarr, Bruno Redondo, Deniz Camp and Fábio Veras – will come bearing a stellar piece of cover art by Jenny Frison, depicting Quinn wearing an inspired evening look.



          

Similar in style to Marilyn Monroe in her iconic film The Seven-Year Itch, Harley&#39;s status as a femme fatale is encapsulated in this stunning piece of artwork. She&#39;s gorgeous, yet can be incredibly deadly when she wants to be – and Frison&#39;s cover is a perfect visual representation of that.

 Will Harley Quinn&#39;s New Look Make an Appearance in Black &#43; White &#43; Redder? 


          




Whether in fan art, cosplays, or official DC material, Harley Quinn&#39;s wardrobe has infinitely expanded since she was created thirty-one years ago, with recent inspired costumes exploring her as an 80s Scream Queen, a mermaid alongside the Gotham Sirens, and more. Jenny Frison&#39;s cover for Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder #6 is yet another extension of that trend. Harley&#39;s Marilyn-inspired look comprises a tastefully revealing black dress, with a killer makeup job that shows off the black, white and red aesthetic of the anthology series in perfect fashion. It&#39;s all tied together with a gorgeous feather boa around her shoulders, framing her eye-catching new design.

While Quinn&#39;s new look is full, front and center for the final issue of Black &#43; White &#43; Redder, that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that it will be featured in its pages. After all, it&#39;s currently just artwork for the comic&#39;s cover, and epic new cover designs are often simply just that: designs. However, when looking at what stories lie ahead for Quinn in this final issue, there is one that catches the eye, as a story with the potential to bring her femme fatale look to life; the story crafted by Tini Howard and Babs Tarr will feature Harley Quinn going &#34;for a night on the town with the Gotham City Sirens.&#34;






 Additional Stories Promise Harley Anthology Will End with a Bang 
          

This implied girls&#39; night with Poison Ivy and Catwoman could lend itself to the women getting all dressed up for a night of fun and mayhem, so it&#39;s entirely possible for this Marilyn-inspired look to make an official appearance. When taking a glimpse at additional tales that will be featured in the upcoming final issue, there&#39;s more to the comic than Harley&#39;s killer new look. It also looks like she&#39;ll be providing fans with some of her best stories to close out her six-issue limited series. Bruno Redondo&#39;s take on the character will feature Harley going &#34;on a dimension-breaking journey of self-reflection&#34; akin to her nightmare during this summer&#39;s Knight Terrors event.

It seems Harley&#39;s best adventures lie just ahead of her, as Harley Quinn: Black &#43; White &#43; Redder #6 promises to continue the trend of making the character one of DC&#39;s standout protagonists. Not only do the final three stories of her anthology have potential to be her most exciting yet, but the way they&#39;re all tied together by a gorgeous piece of cover art makes this a must-own for Harley fans. This femme fatale cover is undoubtedly Harley Quinn&#39;s most inspired yet as it pins her as a Marilyn Monroe fan that wants to put her own evil spin on what made the actress so famous.
