## Literature Review

Batman has saved Gotham City countless times, but in the city&#39;s latest dire moment of need, it&#39;s not Batman who rises up, but Two-Face.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Batman: City of Madness #2!




Batman has saved Gotham City countless times, and as the Gotham Below begins to unleash its horrors on Gotham City in Batman: City of Madness, the Caped Crusader is doing everything he can to save the people he cares about. However, the key to saving Gotham City might not lie with Batman, but instead with the iconic villain Two-Face. As unlikely as it might sound, it seems that Two-Face is the hero Gotham needs in this story.

Batman: City of Madness #2 – by Christian Ward and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou – establishes Two-Face&#39;s surprising role in saving Gotham City. As Batman rushes to try and solve the mystery of the Batman Below, Two-Face has actually been putting together the mystery far faster.



          

As the first issue of the series revealed, everyone who lives in Gotham has a counterpart in the Gotham Below. Two-Face has been in contact with the Two-Face Below through his dreams. Because of this, he has intimate knowledge of what the Batman Below is planning, and he is desperately trying to get this information to Batman so that he can stop things before it&#39;s too late.




                  &#34;Gotham Below Is Getting Stronger&#34;: The Demonic Batman Below Finally Has His Own Robin - &amp; It&#39;s Destroying Gotham   Every Batman needs a Robin, including the terrifying and unleashed Batman Below. But this dark Robin might spell the end for Gotham City.   


 Two-Face Explores The Gotham Below 


          



Two-Face used to be Gotham City&#39;s District Attorney, and did a lot to make sure the criminals Batman brought in actually faced prison, instead of being able to walk on technicalities. This made him a huge asset to the war on crime, but when his face was splashed with acid during a court case, Two-Face&#39;s mental state quickly spiraled out of control. Two-Face became one of Batman&#39;s worst villains, entirely dominated by the idea of fate and duality. He used a coin to decide his villainous actions. He was literally a man divided in two, and this is what makes him the perfect hero to deal with the Gotham Below.




The Gotham Below is a dark reflection of Gotham City. Every single person who lives in Gotham City has an alternate who lives in the Gotham Below, and they&#39;re often twisted beyond recognition. The Two-Face Below seems relatively sane in comparison to creatures like the Batman Below, with the only difference being his face is divided horizontally instead of vertically. Two-Face is the perfect hero for this story, because of the dualistic nature of the character. Just as Gotham is divided between the Gotham Below and the Gotham Above, Two-Face is a man divided between his good personality of Harvey Dent and the villainous Two-Face personality.



 &#34;City Of Madness&#34; Two-Face Admits He Wants To Get Better 


          

In City of Madness so far, Batman has been trying his best to piece together what is going on, but he&#39;s one step behind Two-Face. With Two-Face in direct contact with the Two-Face Below, he&#39;s already fully aware of the Gotham Below, and was the first to try and warn Batman that the Batman Below had kidnapped a child, intending to make it a twisted version of Robin. While some may question why Two-Face would even care to save Gotham, the Two-Face Below explains it perfectly. While Two-Face may not be the hero Gotham wants, he certainly is the hero Gotham needs right now, even more so than Batman.
