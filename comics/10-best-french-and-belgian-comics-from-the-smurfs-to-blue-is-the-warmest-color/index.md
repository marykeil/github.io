## Literature Review

Known as the &#39;the Ninth Art,&#39; Franco-Belgian comics have major variety, from the fun of The Smurfs to the tragic romance of Blue Is the Warmest Color




France and Belgium have provided fans with some of the best comics available on the market, whether it&#39;s the playful cartoon fun of The Smurfs, the tragic romance of Blue Is the Warmest Color, or the existential horror of Sandcastle. While American comics may be dominated by superheroes, these graphic novels do things differently, leading to beloved franchises which have conquered Europe and inspired some surprising major movies.
Dubbed &#34;Bandes Dessinées&#34; (or BD for short) in France and Belgium, comics from these two countries have major cultural significance. BD comics are described as the &#34;Ninth Art,&#34; and embraced with far more cultural legitimacy than comic fans from other cultures might expect. Heroes such as the Smurfs and Tintin have a major cultural imprint, and were even added to Belgium&#39;s passports in 2022. These characters have stood the test of time for their iconic designs and incredible stories that have touched the hearts of people worldwide: here are the ten best Bandes Dessinées that international readers can enjoy.









 








 10  Bécassine Features One of the First Female Protagonists in French Comics 
1905-1962
        

Kicking things off is a heroine who has become one of France&#39;s most beloved characters in all of fiction. Created by Jacqueline Rivière and Joseph Pinchon in 1905, Bécassine follows the adventures of its titular character, a housemaid from Brittany, as she navigates life on the peninsula. While she began as a foolish joke character, Bécassine later appeared in more complex narratives, with the stories shifting to treat her as a good-natured protagonist. Visitors to France will spot Bécassine merchandise everywhere, as the character has become a cultural icon bigger than any single story.





 9  Sandcastle Is an Existentialist Nightmare (Adapted into M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s Old) 
2013
        

This graphic novel by Frederik Peeters and French filmmaker Pierre Oscar Lévy is a sci-fi concept that doubles as a pretty intense horror story. It follows a family and a small group of tourists as they travel to a mysterious beach for a day in the sun. However, they quickly realize that things are not quite right as they begin aging at a rapid rate and have no way to leave the beach. If that sounds familiar, it&#39;s because the comic was adapted into M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s Old.
This harrowing tale is loaded with themes that have kept readers engaged since it first hit shelves in 2013. Its dark exploration of existential concepts such as aging and the human experience is masterfully handled, and its upsetting conclusion makes it an absolute must-read for fans of the horror genre.
M. Night Shyamalan&#39;s movie adaptation Old changes the original comic&#39;s ending, giving the surviving characters a chance at happiness and explaining the &#39;magic&#39; of the beach. The comic is a lot less hopeful, and includes a disturbing supernatural fable that enhances its message. 






 8  Cubitus Gave Belgium Its Own Iconic Animal Hero 
1968-Present
        

Long before Garfield ate his first lasagna but not too long after Snoopy made his first appearance in Peanuts, Dupa, Michel Rodrigue and Pierre Aucaigne&#39;s Cubitus introduced France and Belgium to an adorable anthropomorphic dog. The series follows the titular character in a simple gag-a-day comic where the talking dog seeks out food or spars with his feline nemesis Sénéchal. However, its simplicity is its greatest strength. Cubitus is a precious character. His good-hearted nature and infectious smile have made him an icon, and guaranteed that his strip continues to be published to this day.





 7  Spirou &amp; Fantasio is the Longest Running Franco-Belgian Comic 
1938-Present
        

Robert Velter&#39;s Spirou &amp; Fantasio is an interesting case. It&#39;s the oldest Franco-Belgian comic that still runs today, and its success has allowed its influence to spread for nearly a century, but has also seen the comic take several forms. Originally a gag comic starring the young bellhop Spirou, the later writer and artist Joseph Gillain developed it into more of a serial adventure/mystery comic, and included Spirou&#39;s co-star Fantasio, as well as Marsupilami - a monkey-like sidekick who went on to become an icon in its own right, appearing in animation, film, video games, and even having an asteroid named in its honor.
The humorous series follows investigators Spirou and Fantasio as they search for the next big story while evading danger. The endearing characters are what make this comic stand out among the rest. Spirou &amp; Fantasio is also an important milestone for Bandes Dessinées, as it wasn&#39;t just a success but also a giant leap forward in establishing France and Belgium as major players in the world of comics.





 6  Blue is the Warmest Color Is a Heartbreaking LGBTQ Romance 
2010

        

Jul Maroh&#39;s LGBTQ love story Blue is the Warmest Color has become one of the most recognizable modern graphic novels - not least because Abdellatif Kechiche&#39;s 2013 film adaptation won Canne&#39;s Prized Film Award the Palme d&#39;Or. The story follows the blossoming romance between two women, Emma and Clémentine, as they navigate their secret relationship in the social climate of 1990s France.
There are adorable moments throughout the story that make it a must-read for romance fans, but it&#39;s the societal themes that make it one of the most engaging stories out there. It&#39;s a heartbreaking display of the barriers society puts up against LGBTQ couples because of their sexuality. While the climax doesn&#39;t go easy on the reader, this graphic novel is one of the most crucial reads of the 21st century.





 5  Gaston is the Perfect Spin-Off to Spirou &amp; Fantasio 
1957-Present
        

Spirou &amp; Fantasio has been around so long and is so successful, another of the best and longest-lived Bandes Dessinées is actually a spin-off. Gaston, created by André Franquin, Jidéhem and Delaf in the 1950s, focuses on an accident-prone office worker and his misadventures in modern life. What stands out about Gaston Lagaffe is what he brings to the Spirou &amp; Fantasio franchise. While he doesn&#39;t go on grand adventures around the world, his comedy derives from the average workspace as he tries his best to do a good job, only to fail because of his clumsiness. This has made the character incredibly relatable and cherished by fans, especially as his office-based shenanigans have only become more relevant to modern life.





 4  The Smurfs Are Worldwide Cultural Icons 
1958-Present


 







When Belgian artist Peyo created his first strip featuring The Smurfs, it&#39;s unlikely he knew just how popular they would become. This beloved comic instantly became a phenomenon when it first debuted in Belgium because of its colorful characters and creative setting. It was so popular in fact that it quickly expanded to countries around the world. This franchise has stood the test of time for its ingenious use of fantasy as fans everywhere read through the adventures of Papa Smurf and his family as they evade the evil Gargamel. Very few people don&#39;t know who these adorable blue creatures are, and they will continue to be relevant for years to come as the comic continues to this day.





 3  Astérix Reigns as France&#39;s Biggest Comic Franchise 
1959-Present
        

While not as popular in the US, Astérix is iconic throughout Europe as one of France&#39;s most abiding artistic exports. Created by René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo, it follows a band of fighters from Gaul as they stave off the Roman Empire during the Gallic Wars of 50 BC, granted super-strength with the aid of magic potions. It&#39;s an ingenious work of historical fiction that introduces younger readers to important figures and events in French history while also providing exciting action and genuine humor to boot. The franchise has become an important part of French culture with countless films and even an amusement park. It&#39;s still going strong today with new issues continuing to be released.
Astérix is so iconic, even the ultra-violent comic series The Boys includes references to it, with a scientist behind the creation of the strength potion-like Compound V name-checked as Doctor Uderzo. 






 2  Persepolis is an Eye-Opening Autobiography of the Islamic Revolution 
2000-2003


 







Marjane Satrapi&#39;s Persepolis has been lauded as a modern masterpiece, and for good reason. This ground-level account of the Iranian Revolution is a heartbreaking true story, as Satrapi shares her life story. From her childhood during the war to her life in France after leaving home for her safety, this story has become a major reference point for those seeking to defend comics as a legitimate art form. While it would unfortunately be met with controversy in America - including being pulled from the curriculum in Pennsylvania - this hasn&#39;t stopped Persepolis from standing the test of time. It stands out as one of the best French comics to ever be published, and an exemplar of the Ninth Art.
A film adaptation directed by Marjane Satrapi was made in 2007 and nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars 






 1  The Adventures of Tintin is the Quintessential Franco-Belgian Comic 
1929-1976


 







Rounding things out is a comic that has become a household name across Europe and the wider world. Belgian creator Hergé&#39;s series follows a reporter&#39;s travels to solve mysteries with his friend Captain Haddock and his dog Snowy. Cherished the world over, Tintin&#39;s adventures ultimately set the stage for adventure stories with its nailbiting suspense and gripping action. Above all though, the characters have made it an absolute delight, with everyone from detectives Thomson and Thompson to genius Processor Calculus adding to the fun. Appearing across television, movies, theater and videogames, The Adventures of Tintin perfectly marries comedy to the mystery genre, with beautifully drawn and meticulously researched adventures.
Tintin is undoubtedly the best comic from France and Belgium, but it&#39;s in amazing company, as the huge range of stories from The Smurfs to Blue is the Warmest Color shows a masterful understanding of exactly what comics can do.
