Summary

  The Outsiders, a team that handles mysteries outside the Justice League&#39;s jurisdiction, find themselves trapped in Batman&#39;s mind.   Being in Batman&#39;s mind is dangerous, as it is filled with his past trauma and darkness that shaped him into a hero.   The Outsiders must confront Batman&#39;s fears and find out why they were led to this twisted version of Wayne Manor to escape.  







The Outsiders explore corners of the DC Universe outside what the Justice League can handle, and the newest iteration of this team has been focusing on the DCU&#39;s dark mysteries. One such mystery has just taken Kate Kane and Luke Fox into the mind of Batman. While neither of them knows why they&#39;re there, they know it&#39;s not somewhere they want to be.

The Outsiders have been a recurring team in the DC Universe, and they usually go after crimes or mysteries that fall outside the Justice League&#39;s usual jurisdiction — as they do in a new preview for Outsiders #3 by Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly and Robert Carey.



          

When one of the Outsiders sees a series of numbers in their dream, they realize they&#39;re coordinates. Following those coordinates, Batwoman and Batwing end up transported into a twisted version of Wayne Manor. Worryingly, the numbers translate to the date September 21st, which is the day that Batman&#39;s parents died — a fact Kate immediately recognizes, causing her to realize just how much danger they seem to be in. Check out the full preview below.




                  OUTSIDERS #1 Launches A New Grand Fantasy, Exactly When The DC Universe Needed It   Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Robert Carey come together for Outsiders #1, an amazing new series that digs deep into DC Universe history.   


 Batwoman and Batwing Find Themselves in Batman&#39;s Memory 
         

The night Batman&#39;s parents died was, of course, the worst night of his life and changed the way he approached the world around him. Naturally, this moment lives in Bruce&#39;s memory and drives him in everything he does, especially as a Gotham vigilante. That&#39;s why Batman&#39;s mind is often depicted as grim place and isn&#39;t somewhere that someone would want to be for any real amount of time — even other &#34;grim&#34; superheroes. Batwoman immediately recognizes this and tries to get out with Batwing, only for them to be immediately separated. It&#39;s unclear exactly how or why they got here, but Kate knows the horrors that they&#39;re likely to face in the rest of the issue.




Being trapped in Batman&#39;s mind is an incredibly dangerous place to be. Bruce has gone through many dangerous moments in his life, and he&#39;s survived all of them, but the memories and scars are left behind. Kate and Luke may have to face every fear and every dangerous moment that Bruce has gone through until they manage to escape. But the bigger problem isn&#39;t just their escape, but finding out why they were led here in the first place. They were given specific coordinates that lured them to a twisted version of Wayne Manor, and finding the answers to that will likely be a lot harder than anything else the Outsiders have faced.



 The Outsiders Will Explore More Dark Corners of the DC Universe 


          

Batman is one of DC&#39;s greatest heroes, but that heroism comes from a place of great darkness. While it&#39;s unclear exactly where Kate and Luke are — if they&#39;re in some alternate realm or literally inside Bruce&#39;s mind — what is clear is that this place is full of darkness. If Kate and Luke want to escape, they will need to face the very trauma and darkness that turned Batman into the hero that he is. As his cousin, Batwoman is already intimately familiar with Batman&#39;s trauma, and that might be the key to the Outsiders solving this mystery and escaping alive.
