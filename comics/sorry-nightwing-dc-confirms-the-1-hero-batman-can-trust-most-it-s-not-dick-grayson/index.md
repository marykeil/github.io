## Literature Review

Batman has a ton of allies that he can call on in times of need, but the one hero he trusts more than anyone is someone fans might not expect.





Summary

  Batman is in danger, and the only person he can rely on is Catwoman, as he fights against the Orgham family and the Azmer demon inside him.   The rest of the Bat-Family is too busy or disconnected to rescue Batman, highlighting Catwoman&#39;s unwavering dedication to him.

DC has finally confirmed that the only person Batman can turn to when he&#39;s in danger isn&#39;t Nightwing — it&#39;s Catwoman. In Detective Comics, Batman is fighting against the Orgham family and slowly losing his mind to the Azmer demon they&#39;ve placed inside of him. Eventually broken down and captured by the Orghams, Batman must trust Catwoman to save him.

The shocking hero who will always be there for Batman is revealed in Detective Comics #1077 by Ram V, Jason Shawn Alexander, Dave Stewart, and Ariana Maher. Batman is currently captured by the Orgham family and scheduled for public execution. While normally that wouldn&#39;t pose much of a problem for Batman, the Azmer demon currently ravaging his mind prevents him from escaping his prison. With no other hope and no one else on the way to save him, it&#39;s up to Catwoman to assemble a team and rescue Batman before it&#39;s too late.



          




The rest of the Bat-Family are either too busy or simply too disconnected from Batman to try and mount a rescue, showing that no matter what they go through, Catwoman will always be there for Batman.

 : &#39;He Won&#39;t Snap and Start Killing People&#39;: DC Promises Bruce Isn&#39;t Becoming an &#39;Evil Batman&#39; - He&#39;s Something Worse


 Catwoman Comforts Batman in His Darkest Moment 
          

Catwoman and Batman&#39;s relationship has been rocky at the best of times. Their relationship has always been a bit strained due to Batman&#39;s paranoia and inability to fully trust other people. This was only exacerbated when Selina left Bruce at the altar, believing that if Bruce was happy, he wouldn&#39;t be able to continue being Batman. While their relationship has continued to be off-and-on since then, one thing that&#39;s been clear is their devotion to one another. While Selina and Bruce haven&#39;t managed to really work out their relationship in a healthy way, not even the events of Gotham War could shatter their relationship.




With Batman cut off from the rest of the Bat-Family due to the manipulations of Zur-En-Arrh, Bruce finds himself almost entirely alone during his battle against the Orgham family. Cut off from his technology and his allies, Batman is eventually overwhelmed and captured. The Orgham Family plans to publicly execute Batman, which will not only kill Bruce but completely erase his legacy from the minds of the Gotham City citizens. This is why, even after Catwoman&#39;s most brutal insult to Batman, she&#39;s still the one to come to save him. No matter what comes between them or how much they disagree or argue, they will always be there for one another.



 Catwoman Makes Batman a Promise to Save Him 
          

Batman is in the most dangerous position he&#39;s ever been in: he&#39;s cut off from friends and family, his mind is being destroyed, and his very legacy is being threatened. In such a dangerous position, some might assume that would be Nightwing the one to save him, but he simply isn&#39;t available. The only hero that has and always will be there for Batman is Catwoman. Regardless of the issues they&#39;ve had in the past, as Batman continues to sink into darkness, it&#39;s Catwoman who promises to be there — to never let him truly fall.
