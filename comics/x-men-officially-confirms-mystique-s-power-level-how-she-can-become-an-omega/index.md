# X-Men Officially Confirms Mystique s Power Level - &amp; How She Can Become an Omega


## SUMMARY 



  Mystique&#39;s powers are revealed to be just short of an Omega-level mutant, and she has the potential to surpass her last limitation and become a god.   Mystique is Nightcrawler&#39;s father, not Azazel, and her control over her cellular and genetic structure is instinctive.   Mystique&#39;s abilities include rewriting the genomic instructions of every cell in her body, and the only barrier to her true Omega status is her inability to mimic other mutants&#39; X-Genes.

## Literature Review

As the full, jaw-dropping extent of Mystique&#39;s mutant gift is revealed, Marvel hints at the last barrier she needs to surpass to become truly godlike.




Warning: Spoilers for X-Men Blue: Origins (2023) #1 ahead!




Mystique has always been a force to be reckoned with among (and against) the X-Men, but a retcon decades in the making reveals the full extent of her powers to be just short of an Omega-level mutant. Even more incredible, however, is the fact that Mystique holds the potential to surpass her last limitation (the ability to mimic someone else&#39;s X-Gene) and become a god, surpassing the rest of mutantkind.

Si Spurrier, Marcos To, Wilton Santos, and Ceci De La Cruz&#39;s X-Men Blue: Origins (2023) #1 is a powerhouse of an issue that details Nightcrawler&#39;s long-awaited heart-to-heart with Mystique after the fall of Krakoa. After Nightcrawler gives Mystique the Hopesword to try and restore her shattered psyche, Mystique delivers a jaw-dropping revelation: she is Nightcrawler&#39;s father, not Azazel, having shifted into a male form to conceive Nightcrawler with Destiny.

          




The comic then cuts away to a write-up from Doctor Nemesis, emphasizing how Mystique&#39;s control over her entire cellular and genetic structure is completely instinctive. The only thing holding her back from true &#34;Omega&#34; status is her inability to copy other X-Genes - or, rather, her inability to display this power so far.

                  X-Men Confirms a Disgusting Fan Theory About Mystique&#39;s Powers   For years, fans have debated the extent of Mystique&#39;s powers, and now a disgusting theory about her has been confirmed.    


 Mystique Has Only One Barrier Between Her And Mutant Godhood 
          

While Mystique&#39;s shapeshifting abilities have made her a powerful figure throughout X-Men history, it seems that writer Chris Claremont always intended her to have this godlike control over her physiology. It was also always his intention to have Mystique be Nightcrawler&#39;s father. Although Azazel was ultimately penned as Nighcrawler&#39;s father instead, this retcon restores Claremont&#39;s original vision for Nightcrawler and Mystique&#39;s relationship, with Azazel&#39;s genetic structure instead becoming the basis for Mystique&#39;s gametes.




Doctor Nemesis&#39;s write-up expands even further on Mystique&#39;s abilities, describing her as being capable of &#34;rewriting the genomic instructions in every single cellular nucleus of her body. All at once. And all without conscious thought.&#34; He says that the one barrier keeping her from true Omega status is &#34;that she has thus far appeared incapable of mimicking the X-Gene of other mutants, nor of manipulating her own.&#34; That does not necessarily mean that such capability is beyond her, however - only that Mystique has so far lacked the interest in decoding the science of her own genetics. Should she team up with a geneticist such as Mr. Sinister, it is entirely possible that Mystique could host every single mutant power at once.



 Mystique May Be The Most Powerful Mutant To Ever Live 
          




Nightcrawler already compares Mystique to godhood upon hearing this revelation, and the comparison is not unfounded. As she is now, Mystique is implied to be capable of self-sexual reproduction/spontaneous generation, an act already associated with divinity. Her genetic mastery also implies immortality, being able to reset the age of her cells. Pushing even further, transcending her limitation would allow her to copy X-Genes of titanic figures such as Genesis, Apocalypse, and beyond, effectively granting her every possible superpower. The X-Men have confirmed Mystique&#39;s power level to be just short of divine, and so far it appears that Mystique&#39;s mere lack of interest in developing her powers further is the only thing holding her back from true godhood.
