## Literature Review

With the Justice League currently restructuring, its heroes are all leveling up — meaning the hierarchy within the League is about to change.





Summary

  The Justice League&#39;s staple members are experiencing massive power shifts, putting them on a more even playing field with Superman.   The Flash can access reality from every angle and potentially break the natural laws of the universe.   Batman&#39;s upgrades include a superpowered cyborg hand and defeating an android enemy even Superman couldn&#39;t defeat.  







As the World’s Greatest Super-heroes, the Justice League are far and away some of the most powerful characters in the DC Universe. With juggernauts like Superman and Wonder Woman filling their ranks, it’s no wonder that they’re considered Earth’s primary super team. But with many of its staple members undergoing massive status quo shifts, it seems that the hierarchy of power within the Justice League is about to change.

Since the Dawn of DC began, the Justice League itself has been on a long hiatus as the heroes of the Titans step up to fill their mentors’ shoes as the world’s first line of defense. In the meantime, Superman, Batman, and the others have been rethinking what the League should represent, especially after their disappearance during Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths.

          




But as they’ve planned and prepared, the individual members of the Justice League have slowly been leveling up, paving the way for some massive power shifts once the team is finally restructured. From Green Lantern to Batman, the staple heroes of the Justice League are more powerful than they’ve ever been – and these upgrades couldn’t come at a better time.



&#34;Dawn of DC&#34; is an interconnected storytelling initiative that crossed much of DC Comics&#39; publishing line in 2023.




                  The Justice League Will Finally Return in DC Lore to Fight... Superman? - Theory Explained   A dark connection between Superman and his nemesis Brainiac is revealed, hinting that the Justice League may reunite to stop a mind-controlled Clark.   


 DC’s Greatest Justice League Heroes Are Redefining Their Strengths 
          




Over in The Flash #3 by Si Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., and Trish Mulvihill, it’s been confirmed that the Flash has been undergoing a seismic shift in his access to the Speed Force, as the Fastest Man Alive can now access reality from every possible angle — and even potentially break the natural laws of the universe. Meanwhile, a battle between Hal Jordan and Sinestro in Green Lantern #6 by Jeremy Adams, Xermanico, and Scott Godlewski confirms that the wielders of the Emotional Spectrum are capable of generating Kryptonite-like radiation on top of all the other unique abilities that Jordan has been discovering with his new ring.

But the Flash and Green Lantern aren’t the only Leaguers stepping up their game, as current stories in both Wonder Woman by Tom King, Daniel Sampere, and Tomeu Morey and Batman by Chip Zdarsky, Jorge Jimenez, and Mike Hawthorne hint that two of the members of DC’s Trinity are similarly leveling up their game. In Wonder Woman #3, Diana faces down a strike team designed specifically to take down the Man of Steel himself while hardly breaking a sweat. Likewise, Batman&#39;s ongoing series has shown Bruce stepping up his scope by venturing through the multiverse, gaining a superpowered cyborg hand, and defeating Failsafe – an android enemy even the Superman couldn’t defeat.






 A Justice League Upgrade Is Desperately Needed 
          

Overall, it’s clear that the feats and challenges of the World’s Greatest Heroes are ever-growing. It&#39;s possible that the Justice League will be reforming to tackle a Brainiac-controlled-Superman, so that they all seem to be getting closer to the Man of Steel’s power level couldn’t be better. After all, Superman has always been the Justice League’s primary powerhouse, but each of his fellow Leaguers has been quietly experiencing massive power shifts, putting them all on a more even playing field with the Last Son of Krypton. These seemingly small changes also give them a better chance at defeating the Man of Steel should he go rogue.

The Justice League has long been the DCU&#39;s most powerful team, but the power levels of its individual members have varied. With startling status quo shifts happening for the Flash, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Batman, it’s clear that the eventual reunification of the League will shake the multiverse. And if their reunion really does pit them against Superman, then the Justice League will stand a better chance than ever before.




Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, and Green Lantern are all available from DC Comics.
