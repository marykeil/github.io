## SUMMARY 



  Wonder Woman&#39;s future daughter, Elizabeth Prince, takes on the mantle of Wonder Robin and proves to be the strongest Robin ever.

## Literature Review

No Boy Wonder can match the raw power of the DC Universe’s latest hero, Wonder Robin, Wonder Woman’s daughter’s first superhero identity.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Wonder Woman #3!Step aside, Robin, there&#39;s a new Boy, or rather, Girl Wonder in town. A look into the years ahead shows Elizabeth Prince, Wonder Woman&#39;s future daughter, taking on an unexpected mantle. Lizzie&#39;s debut as Damian Wayne&#39;s sidekick is putting an impressive and powerful spin on the Robin legacy.




In Wonder Woman #3&#39;s backup story &#34;World&#39;s Finest&#34; by Tom King and Belen Ortega, Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter has been left in the care of Superman Jon Kent and Robin Damian Wayne. Jon ditches Damian to go save people from a crumbling dam. Damian also decides to go on patrol and brings Lizzie, dressing her up in a Robin costume and calling her &#39;Wonder Robin&#39;.

          

The two find Killer Croc in the sewers and Damian quickly finds himself overwhelmed. Wonder Robin comes in with a kick to Croc&#39;s stomach that sends him flying into a wall. Damian is impressed and later notes to Jon that Lizzie kicked Croc so hard that he had to be taken to Doctor Mid-Nite.


 Wonder Woman&#39;s Daughter is the Strongest Robin Ever 
          




Earlier this year, news of Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter sent shock waves through the comic community. Trinity, aka Elizabeth Marston Prince (or Lizzie), was introduced in a story in Wonder Woman #800. Set in the future, Trinity, along with Jon and Damian ventured to a prison that was holding the secret king of America, the Sovereign. During the story, the elder heroes discussed a moment from Elizabeth&#39;s childhood where Damian took her out to fight Killer Croc when she was only five. Though the three bickered a bit, they formed a bond that was as strong as the one shared by the original DC Trinity.

The Robins have always been pretty capable fighters. Whether it was Dick Grayson&#39;s acrobatics or Tim Drake&#39;s keen insights, each Batman sidekick brought something unique to the table. Lizzie, however, is the most powerful youngster to ever wear the yellow &#39;R&#39;. Granted, she&#39;s not the first superpowered Robin, as there was a brief period where Damian had otherworldly abilities shortly after being revived. But Elizabeth is an Amazon and her powers are an innate part of her. Not to mention, she&#39;s the youngest Robin to ever go on patrol and, on her first mission, took down one of the most dangerous villains in Batman&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery.






 Wonder Robin Raises the Bar for Future Robins 
          

While Wonder Robin might not be a permanent addition, seeing Lizzie in action shows off the advantage a Robin with powers has. Most Gotham-based villains, even the strongest ones, aren&#39;t a match for some of the DC Universe&#39;s strongest races such as Amazons. While Batman has trained numerous crime fighters to become fantastic martial artists, all of them fail in comparison to a girl who has Amazonian blood in her veins. Lizzie&#39;s time as a Robin might have been brief, but few Boy or Girl Wonders, if any, will ever match her power level.

Wonder Woman #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
