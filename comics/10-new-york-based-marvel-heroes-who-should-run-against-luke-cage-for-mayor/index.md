# 10 New York Based Marvel Heroes Who Should Run Against Luke Cage For Mayor


## SUMMARY 



  Luke Cage&#39;s tenure as mayor or New York City, following Kingpin Wilson Fisk&#39;s time in office, has been controversial, with the hero not living up to his potential as the city&#39;s leader. With another election coming up, this could prompt one or more of the city&#39;s other heroes to enter the race.   New York is in many ways the epicenter of hero activity in the Marvel Universe – but Fisk&#39;s laws making superhero activity illegal have majorly impacted the city&#39;s vigilante population. Luke Cage has not moved to undo these laws, as many expected he would, meaning another hero might have to step up to challenge him in the mayoral election.   Heroes like Captain America, She-Hulk, and even Mayor Cage&#39;s wife Jessica Jones could potentially be the ones to unseat the incumbent candidate.

## Literature Review

As Mayor Luke Cage prepares for NYC&#39;s next election, there are some heroes who could give him a a run for his money in a campaign for the job.




As New York City Mayor Luke Cage prepares for an upcoming election, there are a slew of potential superhero candidates to challenge him for his position. New York is, in many ways, the center of the Marvel Universe – and the city&#39;s mayor has often had an important role to play in various Marvel storylines. Before Luke Cage&#39;s tenure in office, Mayor Wilson Fisk passed a controversial law, making it illegal to be a superhero in New York, resulting in an era of increasing difficulty being a superhero protecting New York City, even after he was booted out of office at the end of the arc.




Following Fisk&#39;s outster from office, as his his opponent at the time, Luke Cage ultimately found himself in office. Since then, Mayor Cage has struggled to navigate enforcing Kingpin&#39;s laws, which remain on the books, and maintaining friendships with other superheroes. He leads the city in an era citizen morale toward heroes is at an all-time low. Now, it&#39;s time for him to earn the seat given to him, by winning the job in the upcoming election. As of yet, no firm candidate opposing him for the role has emerged. Considering everything surrounding the stakes of this election, there are some heroes in NYC who may be worthy of being a candidate.

                  Luke Cage Fails As New York&#39;s Mayor Because He&#39;s a Politician, Not a Hero   Luke Cage pretends to be a politician instead of the hero he was always meant to be - and he is judged for it by the God of Celestials.   


 Spider-Woman 
A New Path To Heroism For Jessica Drew
         




Spider-Woman enters the upcoming &#34;Gang War&#34; event at an interesting stage in her life. The character is returning from the dead after an extended absence, and will receive her own rebooted series as part of the new era of her superhero career. With so much change is coming for the Jessica Drew character, now would be the perfect time to offer something completely different for this new Spider-Woman series. One thing that would be an incredibly different direction to take her in would be to have her to venture into politics. Similar to Luke Cage&#39;s pivot into politics, Jessica Drew running for mayor would be a radical new role for the character in the Marvel Universe. It would also provide Marvel a great opportunity to install a female character in this critical position of power.



 J. Jonah Jameson 
The Mayor&#39;s Office Offers A Chance At Redemption
          




J. Jonah Jameson is one of the few members of this list who actually has some political experience already. Granted, he was a much different man at the time. When he was the mayor of New York City for a brief run, he was drenched in his classic Spider-Man hatred to the point that he instituted his anti-Spidey squadron, Spider-Slayers, all over the city. In more recent times, Jonah has learned a great deal of humility, ensuring that a second opportunity to lead New York as mayor would be very different. Jameson has seen the error of his earlier ways, in the process becoming one of Spider-Man&#39;s closest allies. Another chance at being mayor gives Jonah the opportunity to right his wrongs. Even more interestingly, it would give Peter Parker a vital political ally.



 Misty Knighy 
Serving the People In Different Ways
         




Like Jessica Drew, Misty Knight would be a great candidate for the first Marvel superhero to be elected Mayor of New York. Unlike Drew, however, Misty Knight offers a tantalizing connection to Mayor Luke Cage, making for an even more dramatic election cycle. In addition to having teamed up with Cage on multiple occasions, Knight was once romantically linked to the current mayor&#39;s best friend and Hero for Hire partner, Iron Fist. More importantly, what distinguishes Knight from most people on this list is that she&#39;s served the city of New York in two public service capacities. Misty Knight was previously both a superhero and as a cop. In a city divided on the issue of superheroes, Knight could prove to be a unifier.



 Steve Rogers 
Marvel&#39;s Most Persuasive Speaker
         

Steve Rogers is a natural politician without even trying. He recently reminded readers how giving speeches is one of his greatest abilities. At a time when relations between humans and mutants are worse than they&#39;ve been in years, one speech was able to win over an entire crowd, shifting their perspectives from anti-mutant hysteria to a more tolerant position. From this example, it follows that Rogers likely he has one of the best chances of any Marvel superhero to do the same for New York City, which is currently plagued by anti-superhero sentiment. Repairing that relationship is the next mayor&#39;s most crucial task, and Captain America may be the most capable of doing it.






A Captain American variant previously ran for President of the United States in the Ultimate Marvel Universe.






 Jessica Jones 
The Current Mayor&#39;s Wife Could Improve On His Work
          

While Jessica Jones lacks Misty Knight&#39;s civil service history as a police officer, she offers an amplified version of the personal connection: Jones is Mayor Cage&#39;s wife. Jessica Jones has been lying low in the Marvel Universe for the most part, since starring in last year&#39;s The Variants series, but now may be the perfect time for her to return. A political feud pitting husband and wife against each other is one that writes itself. More importantly, Jessica Jones can also hold her own in this political climate. Similar to Misty Knight&#39;s situation, Jessica&#39;s past as a superhero could come to her advantage in winning over the pro-hero voters. Meanwhile, the fact that she put her time as Jewel behind her a long time ago could also be enough to win over some anti-hero voters.




                  Jessica Jones Dated a Major MCU Hero Before Luke Cage   Jessica Jones and Luke Cage might be considered a power couple in the Marvel Universe, but she could&#39;ve had another famous Avenger for a husband.   



 Daredevil 
Experience And Moral Conviction Give Matt Murdoch An Edge
          

Even in a world that presumes that Matt Murdock is dead, Daredevil will likely never stop fighting the Kingpin. Leaning into his new identity as Father Matthew might be a good way for him to fight the Kingpin&#39;s laws. The world has been altered since he returned from Hell, as not everyone remembers who Matt used to be. Whether the world remembers or not, Murdoch was in fact deputy mayor under Wilson Fisk, giving him political experience that could be to his advantage, were he to take office. More immediately, he is currently a priest, which would appeal to many voters in New York City.






As established in 2023&#39;s Daredevil #3, Ben Ulrich never met Matt in the current Marvel canon, a major departure from their longtime relationship.






 She-Hulk 
Going From Law Into Politics Is A Natural Evolution
         

Jennifer Walters has always proven to be someone who everyone – both heroes and average citizens – can depend on. For many people, She-Hulk is the first person who they call on for help, especially for superheroes. It wasn&#39;t that long ago that readers saw the title character of The Invincible Iron Man immediately call the sensational lawyer when his friend Rhodey gets arrested. In that regard, She-Hulk is a hero&#39;s hero and can build upon that as part of a potential political campaign. After spending so many years as a lawyer, Jen taking a step into politics would be a major way to elevate her up the Marvel ladder in a new, exciting way.




                  She-Hulk&#39;s Secret Origin Redefines Her Maximum Strength   The Defenders Beyond miniseries redefines She-Hulk&#39;s strength, making it not only integral to her character, but to the entire Marvel multiverse.   



 Reed Richards 
&#34;The One Man Smart Enough To Save NYC&#34; Would Be Quite The Slogan
          

Reed Richards becoming the mayor of New York would bring the ramifications of &#34;Devil&#39;s Reign&#34; full circle. When Kingpin essentially banned superheroes from New York City, the Fantastic Four were among those who were imprisoned at the time. Reed coming back to win Wilson Fisk&#39;s old mayor seat would be major payback, if not closure. Most importantly, Reed Richards is smart enough to figure out how to undo Kingpin&#39;s laws from the inside. Mayor Cage recently told Spider-Man in Amazing Spider-Man #36 how hard it is to try to undo those same laws, especially when it risks &#34;overwhelming public sentiment.&#34; Given how smart Reed is, though, he&#39;s likely to find a loophole or technicality small enough to bypass it.






 The Wasp 
&#34;A Woman Who Can Do Everything&#34; Would Look Great On Campaign Posters
          

Janet van Dyne is someone who has worn many hats over the years. She&#39;s been a superhero, designer, socialite, a secret agent, Avenger, and most recently, a private investigator. She has successfully established herself in the Marvel Universe as practically an everywoman; or rather, a woman who can achieve any and everything that she sets her mind to. For the woman who has done everything, the one thing that she has yet to attempt is venturing into politics. There is no better time than the present, and if history is any indicator, she could already a shoo-in to win before officially running.



 Peter Paker 
&#34;Your Friendly Neighborhood Mayor&#34;
          




In The Amazing Spider-Man #36, Spidey confronts Mayor Cage on his approach to politics, specifically why he hasn&#39;t undone Kingpin&#39;s laws yet, noting that he only wants to meet with heroes in the shadows, instead of trying to improve citizen-hero relations. Although Mayor Cage&#39;s answers sound plausible, Spidey didn&#39;t seem very satisfied with what he heard, and he may need to do something about it himself. Granted, as Peter Parker, he may be the least qualified candidate on this list, but he could lean into that aspect of himself for his campaign. The hometown everyman makes for the perfect underdog story, one that voters can get behind and offers a perfect antithesis to Luke Cage.
