## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s 1990s Starfleet Academy comic was years ahead of its time, and now here is every arc from the book, ranked.




In 1996, Marvel Comics broke the Star Trek comics mold by releasing Starfleet Academy. The series, which followed the adventures of Deep Space Nine’s Nog as a cadet at Starfleet Academy, was the first Trek comic not to be based on an existing television show. Outside of Nog, the cast of Starfleet Academy were all new characters, some with deep ties to the franchise. This made the book a risky proposition, but writer Chris Cooper and his artistic collaborators spun gold from the premise. Now, here is every story and arc from Marvel’s Starfleet Academy, ranked.









 








 9  “The Return of Charlie X” 
From Starfleet Academy #8


 







Starfleet Academy’s ties to the larger Star Trek franchise were on full display in “The Return of Charlie X,” a sequel to an Original Series episode. The cadets meet Charlie X, whose powers are now out of control, thanks to the Thasians (the race that raised Charlie) leaving him behind. In this issue, Cooper and artist John Royal craft more than a mere sequel, instead giving fans a poignant story of a lonely boy trying to do right by the universe, only to fail miserably. Charlie grew as a character between the Original Series and this issue, making this a satisfying Star Trek story.

 Star Trek&#39;s Harry Kim Admits Serving on Voyager Basically Destroyed His Career 
Star Trek&#39;s Harry Kim has made a shocking revelation: that his time serving on Voyager in the Delta Quadrant nearly ruined his career.








 8  “Cadet Challenge”/“Between Love and Hate” 
From Starfleet Academy #18-19


 







Almost two years into Starfleet Academy’s epic run, Marvel lost the Star Trek license, and the book ended on a high note, bringing full circle some of the series’ long-running plot lines. The Klingons’ First Cadre (more on them later) seek revenge against Nog and his friends over the death of one of their own. As if that was not enough, a virus gets loose on the Klingon ship, mutating the crew and giving the book a body horror flair. While Starfleet Academy could have easily run several more years, it was not meant to be, but Cooper and artist Chris Renaud send the Omega Squadron off in style.





 7  “Liberty” 
From Starfleet Academy #2


 







Starfleet Academy’s second issue does not let up on the excitement nor the character development. The cadets of Omega Squadron get some downtime, but trouble still seems to find them. The women cadets get into a bar brawl while Nog makes inroads with Decker, who was initially resistant to having a Ferengi in Omega Squadron. Surprisingly, the two bond over old Earth comic books, of which Decker is a fan. The story also gives a shout-out to “Little Green Men,” a classic episode of Deep Space Nine. The story reveals that Nog, during his jaunt to the 20th century depicted in that episode, brought back a little souvenir: Marvel Comics #1–the first Marvel comic ever.
            
 
 Every Star Trek Movie Comic Book Adaptation, Ranked 
Comic book adaptations of Star Trek movies used to be the rage, and here is every single one of them, ranked worst to best.








 6  “Prime Directive” 
From Starfleet Academy #1


 







Marvel kicked Starfleet Academy off in a grand fashion, throwing readers head first into an undercover operation being carried out by some officers as well as cadets. It set the tone for the adventures that followed. Starfleet Academy had been briefly glimpsed on television, and this story gives readers their best look yet at the venerable institution. Writer Chris Cooper perfectly balances action with exposition as he and artist Chris Renaud unveil Starfleet Academy’s large cast. They also seed mysteries that play out throughout the book’s run, such as the identity of the Vulcan cadet T’Priell–more on her later.





 5  “Passages”/”Hide and Seek” 
From Starfleet Academy #6-7


 







This two-issue arc of Starfleet Academy was heavy hitting and rich on character development. In a previous issue, Kamilah Goldstein, a member of Omega Squadron, is killed and now her former teammates must pick up the pieces. The arc starts on a down note, but picks up with the introduction of Edam Astrun, a Betazoid cadet. Joining Starfleet to anger his parents, and suffering from a rare disease that affected his natural telepathic abilities, Astrun brought some much-needed conflict to Starfleet Academy. He would go on to become an integral member of Omega Squadron, and ultimately find himself.





 4  “War and Peace”/”Love and Death” 
From Starfleet Academy #4-5


 







This arc of Marvel’s Starfleet Academy title introduced the Klingon equivalent of the Omega Squadron: the First Cadre. Set at a time of renewed hostilities between the Federation and the Klingons, this arc further develops Pava, the Andorian member of Omega Squadron’s story, by revealing her love affair with Kovold of the First Cadre. At turns heart-breaking and action packed, this two-part story also saw Omega Squadron suffer its first loss in Kamilah Goldstein. As noted earlier, the First Cadre would return later in the book’s run, giving Pava and Kovold closure.





 3  Telepathy War Tie-in Issues 
From Starfleet Academy #9-12


 







The Telepathy War was a crossover running through most of Marvel’s Star Trek comics. Building on the escalating tensions between the Federation and the Dominion, the Telepathy War saw the fascist empire attempt to kill every telepath in the Alpha Quadrant. The Founders (the leaders of the Dominion) saw telepaths as a stumbling block to their plans of conquest, and set their sights on Betazoids, Vulcans and others. The cadets of Omega Squadron uncovered this massive conspiracy, and even journeyed to the forbidden planet of Talos IV–the Dominion’s first target. This arc leans into the rich tapestry that was being woven on television.





 2  “Loyalty Test” 
From Starfleet Academy #3


 







From time to time, Starfleet Academy acknowledged events happening on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and “Loyalty Test” did this to brilliant effect. In the Deep Space Nine episodes “Homefront” and “Paradise Lost,” a rogue admiral, in response to the threat of the Dominion, attempted a military coup on Earth, using the cadets of Red Squadron as his goon squad. “Loyalty Test” shows Red Squadron as they engage in acts of sabotage, opposed every step of the way by Omega Squadron. At the story’s end, writer Chris Cooper teased the return of Red Squadron, but it was sadly never followed up on.





 1  “T’Priell Revealed” 
From Starfleet Academy #14-17


 







Starfleet Academy seeded several mysteries throughout its 19-issue run, one of which was the identity of the Vulcan cadet T’Priell, who seemed to also have ties to the Romulans. With the book coming down the home stretch, fans learned the truth, and it gave a callout to the rejoining ceremony at the end of Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. “T’Priell Revealed” showed the depths of cruelty the Romulans can sink to, but also offers hope for not only the cadet’s future, but that of the Romulan and Vulcan people. The arc is tense and loaded with character development, making it the best arc of Starfleet Academy.
Over the years, various creators have tried to get a show set at Starfleet Academy off the ground, with no success. Finally, after years of trying, a Starfleet Academy show will premiere in 2025 on Paramount &#43;. No details have been revealed about the show. Clearly, Marvel was ahead of the Star Trek curve with Starfleet Academy.
