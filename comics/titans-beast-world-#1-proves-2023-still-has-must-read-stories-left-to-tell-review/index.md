## Literature Review

DC Comicsâ€™ last event for 2023 begins in earnest with Titans: Beast World #1, a nail-biting calamity with action and surprisingly touching moments.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #1!The Titans crossover event &#34;Beast World&#34; has kicked off with an action-packed and surprisingly emotional debut issue. Titans: Beast World #1 begins DC Comics&#39; last event of 2023. But as the year winds down, this issue proves that things are just getting started for the DC Universe&#39;s large collection of heroes.




In Titans: Beast World #1 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, the supposedly reformed Brother Eternity reveals his true colors and frees a deadly alien called the Necrostar from its prison on Saturn&#39;s moon. All hell breaks loose as the Necrostar&#39;s spores approach Earth and the only way to stop it is by Beast Boy becoming a Starro the Conqueror-like alien.



          

Beast Boy, now Garro, manages to defeat the Necrostar. But just when it looks like the day is saved, the mysterious Doctor Hate arrives and wipes Beast Boy&#39;s mind, turning him into an out-of-control monster. Gar&#39;s spores also spread throughout the Earth, transforming people into odd animal hybrids.


 Titans: Beast World #1 is an Amazing Start to DC&#39;s Newest Event 
          




Titans: Beast World #1 builds off of Taylor&#39;s recent run on Titans. Nightwing and his closest allies were asked by the Justice League to take their place as the leading superhero team of the DC Universe. It&#39;s only been a short time since they took the reins, but their new era was filled with excitement. Not only did their teammate Wally West travel back in time to prevent his own murder, but their old enemy Brother Blood (now Eternity) reemerged working with the former Titan Garth. But unknown to them, Eternity was secretly a Tamaranean impostor intent on extinguishing the human race.

While Titans: Beast World #1 picks up from the plot elements established in Titans, it&#39;s a very approachable comic for casual readers. Tom Taylor crafts a compelling story filled with action, but makes sure to balance with compelling emotional scenes between Beast Boy and Raven. And it can&#39;t be stressed enough how impressive Ivan Reis&#39; art is here. Not only do the battles with the Necrostar feel exciting and engaging, but the book&#39;s moments of body horror, like Beast Boy&#39;s transformation into Garro, are as disturbing as they are delightful to look at. The book serves to set up the larger &#34;Beast World&#34; story and its various tie-in books, but it&#39;s a solid read all on its own.






 Titans: Beast World #1 Sets Up Powerful Finish for 2023
