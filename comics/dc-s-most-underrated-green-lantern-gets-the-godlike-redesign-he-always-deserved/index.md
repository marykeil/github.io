Summary

  Kyle Rayner, the most underrated Green Lantern, returns with a God-like redesign, bringing his journey full-circle.   A multiversal version of Kyle emerges as he communicates with John through an ominous voice, indicating a different universe origin.   Kyle&#39;s tragedy of apparent blindness is repurposed as he becomes a powerful blind prophet, solidifying his status as the most powerful Green Lantern.  







The most underrated man to hold a Green Lantern just returned with the perfect God-like redesign that brings his journey thus far full circle. The Green Lantern in question is none other than Kyle Rayner, best remembered for replacing Hal Jordan as Earth&#39;s primary Green Lantern after the &#34;Emerald Twilight&#34; arc. Even after ascending to the most powerful White Lantern, his role in DC has greatly diminished, making him a truly underrated character.

Kyle Rayner eases his way back into the forefront of the DC Universe in Green Lantern: War Journal #3 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Montos, Adriano Lucas, and Dave Sharpe. In making his shocking return, Kyle&#39;s comeback also gifts him with a brand-new redesign that not only asserts him as a God-like being, but one that brings his journey full-circle.

          




This version of Kyle is dressed in all green from head to toe, including green harem pants, a green blindfold completely covering his eyes, and a green cape that is reminiscent of the original Green Lantern, Alan Scott. Kyle tells John, &#34;I&#39;m not the Rayner you know, but believe me ... we&#39;ve been through a lot together,&#34; which seems to suggest that, like Lantern Shepherd, this Kyle Rayner may be from a different universe.

                  DC Just Set Up Its 90s Green Lantern Kyle Rayner for a Major Comeback   Green Lantern Kyle Rayner has been missing in action for a while now, but DC is dropping hints he may set to return.   


 Green Lantern Kyle Rayner is Back - With a Multiverse Twist 
          

In this issue, John&#39;s battle with Varron corrupts his powers, and now he is on the verge of becoming one of the Radiant Dead: a twisted, undead version of the Green Lantern Corps. As he&#39;s slowly dying, he starts hearing an ominous voice in his head that he can only describe to himself as a &#34;familiar voice.&#34; Given the familiarity of the lettering style for this &#34;voice,&#34; readers know this is the same omnipotent voice that Lantern Shepherd was speaking to in the first issue: Kyle Rayner from another universe. In the main universe, of course, Kyle served as Earth&#39;s sole Green Lantern through much of the 1990s — when he wasn&#39;t working as an artist in his civilian life.




This multiversal version of Kyle Rayner was previously seen in Dark Crisis: Worlds Without a Justice League - Green Lantern #1 by Johnson, Fernando Blanco, Jordie Bellaire, Troy Peteri, where he was the leader of &#34;Sector John Stewart.&#34; This God-like and blindfolded look brings Kyle&#39;s journey full circle in a way that accounts for the necessity of his eyesight as an artist. A lot remains to be seen and understood about this version of Kyle, but regardless if this is the same Kyle Rayner that fans are familiar with or not, it&#39;s hard to ignore the tragedy of his apparent blindness (if the blindfold is anything to go by).



 Green Lantern Kyle Rayner&#39;s Journey Comes Full Circle 
          

Kyle has always been someone whose strengths lie in his visuals, not just as a Green Lantern but as an artist at heart. In any universe, an artist losing the eyesight they need to express themselves is a great tragedy, but for this Kyle Rayner, he&#39;s repurposed his tragedy to become an all-powerful blind prophet. ​​​​​​​Furthermore, for someone who, for years, has been the most underrated Green Lantern, this Kyle Rayner has rebranded himself to be undeniably the most powerful Green Lantern of his world.
