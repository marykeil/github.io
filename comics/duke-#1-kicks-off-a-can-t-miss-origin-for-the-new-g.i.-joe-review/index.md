## Literature Review

A new era begins for G.I. Joe as the first issue of the Duke miniseries reveals the origins of the Real American Heroes in the Energon Universe.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Duke #1The Energon Universe era of G.I. Joe is officially here, as Duke #1 kicks off the new continuity in a can’t-miss origin of everyone’s favorite Real American Heroes. Tied in more closely than ever with the Transformers, Skybound’s first G.I. Joe title effectively reboots the continuity in exciting and intriguing ways, charting a new direction for the franchise while also honoring what has come before.




Coming from the creative team of Joshua Williamson, Tom Reilly, Jordie Bellaire and Rus Wooten, Duke #1 picks up right after the title character’s debut appearance in Transformers #2, which saw Conrad “Duke” Hauser barely surviving a harrowing encounter with the Decepticon Starscream.

 Duke #1                 Release Date:  December 27, 2023    Writer:  Joshua Williamson    Artist:  Tom Reilly    Colorist:  Jordie Bellaire    Letterer:  Rus Wooten   CODENAME G.I. JOE STARTS HERE. Conrad Hauser has made first contact with an alien being and lived to tell the tale. But no one, not even Colonel Hawk, believes the story of the jet fighter converting into a colossal alien robot that nearly killed the man known as Duke. Now, one of the US Army&#39;s most decorated soldiers is on the hunt for answers, drawn into a conflict that no amount of training could ever prepare him for. A war that only a real American hero has any chance of surviving… Superstar writer JOSHUA WILLIAMSON (Superman, Batman) and artist TOM REILLY (The Thing, Ant-Man) kick off the first of four action-packed miniseries that will introduce the best and worst humanity has to offer in the Energon Universe.   



Taking place in a world where the G.I. Joe and Cobra organizations don’t exist just yet, Duke goes AWOL to uncover the truth about these transforming alien robots who have suddenly appeared on Earth.





 Duke #1 Kicks Off New G.I. Joe Era With Action &amp; Intrigue 
          

The opening scene of the issue sees Duke being dressed down by Col. Hawk, as the title character struggles to cope with recent events. Duke wants to know the truth about his encounter with the transforming fighter jet, but the official line of the U.S. government is that no such beings actually exist. Frustrated with the lack of answers, Duke decides to continue the search on his own. The story then jumps forward six months later to find an obsessed Duke seeking out like-minded individuals in his quest. He meets Dr. Adele Burkhardt at one such gathering of conspiracy theorists, who informs Duke that various factions are using the alien resource Energon to create devastating weapons of war.



Dr. Adele Burkhardt first appeared in 1982’s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #1 from Marvel Comics.







This sends Duke on a mission to infiltrate M.A.R.S. Industries, which should be familiar to long-time G.I. Joe fans as the weapons manufacturing company owned by Destro, who makes his Energon Universe debut here in a brief cameo. Duke successfully sneaks in to get a peak at the weaponry M.A.R.S. is manufacturing with Energon, but winds up getting caught by Mercer, here portrayed as a guard in Destro’s employ. Duke takes a beating, but Destro orders him to be released, instead setting Duke up for a massacre of the conspiracy theorists, including Dr. Burkhardt. Duke gets away once more, but now finds himself on the run from the U.S. military itself, including future Joes Stalker and Rock ’n Roll.



 Duke Goes AWOL to Uncover the Truth About Transformers 


          

The issue serves as a great introduction to the franchise for fans both new and old, as the creators reframe all the elements of classic G.I. Joe in a completely new context. It’s exciting to see the world being built from the ground up in such a way, tying in rather seamlessly with sister Hasbro property Transformers. Williamson’s script is clear and direct, defining the characters through action as they move through the plot at a breathless pace. Most successful of all is the title character, as this is a Duke that fans haven’t seen before. Letting his hair grow well past Army regulation standards, Duke is a man possessed here in his self-titled miniseries.




Frustrated by the lack of answers from the top brass, the future Joe leader sets out on his own to uncover the truth, and Williamson keeps things interesting with new reveals in every scene and clever Easter eggs hidden in plain sight. Eagle-eyed fans will recognize allusions to franchise villains Dr. Mindbender and Zartan, and the issue features a bevy of surprise guest stars who will go on to become major players in the G.I. Joe franchise. Quite a few characters make their Energon Universe debut, and the twist that sees Stalker and Rock ’n Roll assigned to hunt down the AWOL Duke is a nicely-done cliffhanger. It not only raises the stakes immeasurably, but also ensures that expecting the unexpected will be a continuing theme in this new shared continuity.

                  Cobra Commander Just Brought a Classic G.I. Joe Villain into New Continuity   Cobra Commander&#39;s quest to obtain Energon will bring him into conflict with many characters, including this one classic G.I. Joe villain.   






 Surprise Guest Stars Make Duke #1 A Must-Read 
         

All of this is buoyed by Tom Reilly’s artwork, recalling the clean renderings of Alex Toth in his compositions. The storytelling keeps Williamson’s script moving at a nice clip, with a knock-down, drag-out fight between Duke and Mercer at the end being a standout scene in portraying Reilly’s abilities at laying out exciting pages. Reilly also excels at the quieter character moments: Reilly’s Duke is haunted from the moment we see him, and the stakes of what will happen if Energon falls into the wrong hands can be seen in every line of Dr. Burkhardt’s face. Jordie Bellaire brings things home with her moody colors, accentuating certain beats and moments by limiting the palate to a single color for maximum impact. With these artists at the helm, the world of G.I. Joe has rarely looked better.




If there is anything to criticize in Duke #1, it’s that the story does suffer somewhat from having to pick up on threads established previously in Transformers. It is possible to pick up Duke without having to read the other Energon Universe series, but that also means that a good chunk of the opening scene is taken up with a recreation of the scene from Transformers #2 that introduces Duke. The scene does have the added benefit of getting to see Tom Reilly draw an awesome-looking Starscream, but it takes up three pages of valuable real estate in a 30-page story, and is basically just rehashing a moment we’ve already seen without adding any new context or pertinent story information.

This interconnectivity is what makes Skybound’s new publishing initiative exciting, but it could also quickly derail the Energon Universe if the creators aren’t careful. Fortunately, the comics themselves have been of a very high quality so far, and Duke #1 continues to set the bar very high for what might be comics’ most exciting imprint at the moment. With the Cobra Commander series set to debut in a few weeks, it will be interesting to see how this corner of the Energon Universe continues to build and expand, but one thing’s for sure: the first issue of Duke proves that the G.I. Joe franchise is in good hands.






Duke #1 is available now from Skybound Entertainment
