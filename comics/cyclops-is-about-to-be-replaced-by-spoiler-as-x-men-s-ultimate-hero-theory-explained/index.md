## Literature Review

The hero Cypher, missing since Krakoa kidnapped him in Immortal X-Men #13, could prove crucial to the X-Men&#39;s defeat of the coming Enigma Dominion. 




The unassuming but incredibly brilliant X-Men hero Cypher has played a major role in the mutant&#39;s beloved Krakoan Era, and while he has been missing for weeks, it appears that his unique set of abilities could prove crucial in Krakoa&#39;s battle against the coming Enigma Dominion. While many of the X-Men believe Orchis is their main enemy at present, the reality is that the Crown Above All Things is their true enemy, and Doug Ramsey may be key to defeating the dark cosmic entity.




Cypher&#39;s power of omnilingualism - the ability to understand, decipher, and communicate with any language human, alien, or machine - was a major part of the founding of Krakoa, as Doug acted as the main source of communication between the living island and the Quiet Council.

          

In the dramatic Immortal X-Men #18, as the Quiet Council began to crumble and the end of Krakoa loomed, Krakoa suddenly kidnapped Cypher and dragged him into the island&#39;s innards, shocking Doug and the entire Council.


 Cypher Can Communicate With Anything That Uses Language 
         

When Cypher was first introduced in New Mutants he had no idea he was a mutant, thinking he was just a close friend to Kate Pryde who shared her nerdy passion for computers and language. However, in The New Mutants (1982) #21, the alien Warlock crashed into the Xavier Institute, and when none of the New Mutants could understand the frantic techno-organic creature, they revealed to Doug his mutant ability and brought him in to help. Doug was immediately able to communicate with Warlock, beginning a lifelong friendship with the alien and a career with the X-Men as Cypher.




Since then Doug&#39;s powers have only grown, showing that the powerful young mutant could communicate with and decipher anything even remotely considered a &#34;language,&#34; from computer coding to various alien languages, to the incredible ability to translate body language. Cypher&#39;s ability was integral in Xavier, Magneto, and Moira&#39;s plan to found the nation of Krakoa, and Doug used his relationship with Warlock and Krakoa to forge a unique connection between the three, becoming an intrinsic part of the living island as its Voice, and helping steer the nation from the shadows.

Krakoa has grown incredibly fond of Doug and knows how important the mutant can and will be, so it is obvious that the island&#39;s kidnapping of the young man in Immortal X-Men #18 was done to protect him. King Sinister, the Enigma Dominion, or The Crown Above All Things has used various forms of language - spoken, written, telepathic - to communicate in the past, so Cypher&#39;s omnilingualism could make him undeniably important in a direct confrontation with Enigma. Plus, as a potential Easter Egg, &#34;Enigma&#34; could be an allusion to the complex cipher used by Nazi Germany in WWII, and it would be brilliant if &#34;Cypher&#34; was able to decode the &#34;cipher&#34; of Enigma.






 Doug Is Connected To An Advanced AI That Could Threaten Dominion 
         

One of the Krakoan Era&#39;s biggest unanswered questions happened in Giant-Size X-Men: Storm, from Krakoan architect Jonathan Hickman and artist Russel Dauterman, when a team of X-Men entered the World to cure Storm of a virus. Storm was infected with the virus during a confrontation with Orchis and the Children of the Vault, and the techno-organic illness would have killed her within a month. Monet St. Croix, Storm, Cypher, Fantomex, and an A.I.M. scientist named Ned infiltrated the World to find a cure for Storm, a machine capable of decoupling biological and technological entities. The machine was able to separate Storm from the virus, and then Ned used a containment system to prevent the artificial intelligence from &#34;reaching evolutionary critical mass.&#34;




As the X-Men are leaving, Cypher speaks directly with the machine... and the machine speaks back to him, telling Doug that it will see him again in the future, which seemingly doesn&#39;t cause fear or alarm for Cypher. There is zero guarantee that this machine within the World will come into play again in the X-Men&#39;s plans to defeat Enigma, but Hickman&#39;s original plans for Krakoa always involved Dominions and complex sentient AI, so it would make sense that Doug&#39;s connection to this machine could be brought up again.

While the Enigma Dominion is, at this point, a black hole singularity acting with the elevated omnipotence of vast amounts of data gathered from the four Sinister clones&#39; attempts at ascension, it is at its core an evolved form of the biological scientist Nathaniel Essex. There is a chance that the machine from the World, an advanced sentient AI, could escape its containment and collaborate with Cypher to help him defeat Enigma, like somehow seperating some key parts of Dominion like it did with Storm and her virus.






 Cypher Is Confirmed To Be A Part Of Xavier&#39;s Newest Squad 
         

Immortal X-Men #18 saw Charles Xavier discovering parts of the dark truth behind Dominion, that each of the Sinister clones had tried, &#34;succeeded,&#34; and ultimately failed to ascend to Dominion, allowing King Sinister to activate. Fall of the House of X #1 sees Xavier drawing Rasputin IV away from the X-Men&#39;s rescue of Cyclops, clearly thinking that whatever his plan is is more crucial for the survival of mutantkind. Logan Lubera&#39;s variant cover for Rise of the Powers of X #2 reveals Xavier&#39;s crew, who are &#34;Floating between dimensions, hiding from a Dominion who wishes to crush them,&#34; and Cypher is one of the main members of this new reality-bending team.

Rise of the Powers of X takes place 10 years after the X-Men have lost their war against Orchis, and therefore Enigma, meaning there is a high likelihood that Xavier and his crew left time and space before the final fall, to avoid the fate of the rest of mutantkind. The solicit for RoPoX #2 goes on to hint that Xavier has a specific plan for destroying Enigma, and, from Lubera&#39;s cover, Cypher will play a crucial role in this plan. As a mutant capable of speaking with any known language, and knowing that Enigma does communicate through various forms of language, Cypher may be able to decipher and understand the Dominion&#39;s plans, thoughts, or even weaknesses in a way no one else could.




          

Jonathan Hickman&#39;s original outline of Dominion revealed that the only things a Dominion feels truly threatened by is Galactus or the Phoenix Force. Jean Grey was just stabbed and killed - again - by Mother Righteous in the White Hot Room, and will need to come back to life before she can help her fellow mutants in their fight against Enigma. There is a chance that Xavier and Cypher&#39;s plan to take on Enigma will fail - maybe even intentionally - but could delay or distract the Dominion&#39;s plans long enough for Jean Grey in X-Men Forever to resurrect herself, and use the power of the Phoenix to defeat Enigma once and for all.

Regardless of what role he plays, or if he utilizes his deep connection to the AI Warlock or the machine found in the World, it is clear that Cypher is going to be a major hero in the X-Men&#39;s secret battle against the Dominion. While Cyclops will surely continue to be an integral hero in the X-Men&#39;s war against Orchis back on Earth, Cypher&#39;s unique linguistic mutant ability, connection to advanced AIs, and history with Krakoa make him the ultimate hero in a final fight against The Crown Above All.
