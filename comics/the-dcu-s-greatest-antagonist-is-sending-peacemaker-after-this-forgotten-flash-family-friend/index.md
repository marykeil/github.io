Warning! Contains Spoilers For Titans Beast World #4!




Amanda Waller is one of the current top antagonist in the DC Universe, and as part of her latest plans to take down the superhero community, she&#39;s just kidnapping an old Flash family friend. While it&#39;s unclear what Amanda wants Chester Runk for, what is clear is that with Chester&#39;s powers under Waller&#39;s command, she could easily end the world if she wanted.

Preview pages from Titans: Beast World #4 – by Tom Taylor, Lucas Meyer, Romulo Fajardo Jr, and Wes Abbott – revealed Waller&#39;s mysterious plans for Chester Runk, and it is safe to suggest that nothing good will come of this, for Runk, or anybody in the DCU. The pages depict Chester being chased by two transformed individuals, before being &#34;saved&#34; by Peacemaker. Unfortunately, one of the individuals was Chester&#39;s son, who Peacemaker had just killed.

         




In a fury, Chester begins to unleash his powers before Peacemaker subdues him, offhandedly remarking that he feels bad for Chester, but now he&#39;s glad that Waller has &#34;such [messed] up plans&#34; for this oft-forgotten Flash family friend.

                  Titans: Beast World #1 Proves 2023 Still Has Must-Read Stories Left to Tell (Review)   DC Comics’ last event for 2023 begins in earnest with Titans: Beast World #1, a nail-biting calamity with action and surprisingly touching moments.   


 Who Is Chester Runk &amp; What Does Amanda Waller Want With Him? 


          

Chester Runk is a very important part of Flash&#39;s history, but not everyone is immediately familiar with him. Like many other people in Flash&#39;s life, Runk started out as one of Flash&#39;s rogues. He was a brilliant man, a child prodigy, and a gifted inventor. One day, while testing an invention that would allow him to teleport, the machine imploded, fusing itself into Chester and creating a black hole inside of him. Chester now had to consume massive amounts of dense materials to keep himself from exploding. This eventually escalated to him absorbing people entirely. However, after a few confrontations with Flash, he was able to redeem himself and turn his life around.






Chester P. Runk first appeared in The Flash (Vol. 2) #9, from 1988. He was created by Mike Baron and Jackson Guice.




Amanda Waller has been planning to go against the superheroes of the DC Universe for a while now. She orchestrated the events of Beast World, resulting in the death of Beast Boy. She&#39;s been planning this attack for years, and so far, everything has worked out in her favor. It&#39;s unclear how she intends to get to her exact end game, but her goal is a world without superheroes. Notably, the black hole inside Chester isn&#39;t just an all-consuming vortex – it is a gateway to another universe. Waller may intend to weaponize this, so she can exile all superheroes from this world, leaving her in charge of Earth.



 Amanda Waller Is DC&#39;s Most Urgent Threat Right Now 
          




The heroes of the DC Universe currently have their hands full protecting the world from the terrifying terrifying threat of Garro, a crisis Amanda Waller unleashed with great intention. With the heroes distracted, Waller has been able to continue moving forward in her plans completely unobstructed. With this much chaos on the streets, no one will notice Chester Runk has been captured, just as Nightwing lamented his inability to search for Damian among all this chaos. Whatever Waller has planned for the future, she has almost all the pieces to do it, and not even the Flash will be fast enough to stop her.

Titans: Beast World #4 will be available January 9th from DC Comics!
