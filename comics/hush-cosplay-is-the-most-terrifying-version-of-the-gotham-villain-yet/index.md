# Hush Cosplay Is the Most Terrifying Version of the Gotham Villain Yet


## SUMMARY 



  Hush, a criminal mastermind and iconic Batman villain, needs a live-action debut in the DCEU as soon as possible.   Brad Johnson&#39;s cosplay as Hush perfectly captures the terrifying nature of the character with a mummified look, dirtied coat, and psychotic expression.   Hush deserves more respect as a staple villain of Batman lore and now has a cosplay design worthy of that respect, making it time to bring him into the DCEU proper.

## Literature Review

Hush is a comparatively recent villain in Batman&#39;s oversized rogues gallery, with a new set of cosplay images honing in on his terrifying nature.




Batman has a lot of iconic villains in his ever-growing gallery of rogues, with Hush being a criminal mastermind that has hit The Dark Knight where it hurts more times than he cares to admit. And in an utterly terrifying set of DC Comics cosplay images, Hush steps into the real world in a way that proves he needs a live-action debut in the DCEU as soon as possible.A collection of posts recently shared on Instagram by Brad Johnson (@bradman.cosplay), this account usually specializes in cosplaying as the Caped Crusader himself, but clearly has a handle on other Batman-related characters if this Hush design is of any indication.





 

Having also dressed as the hulking mastermind known as Bane from The Dark Knight Rises, Knightmare Batman from Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, the Arkham video game trilogy’s version of The Dark Knight, Star Wars’ Darth Maul, and even Marvel’s Wolverine, Brad excels when bringing gritty and realistic takes on iconic fictional characters to life, and shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.

                  &#34;Freaking Real Life Action Figure&#34;: Batman Cosplay Nails the 1 Detail No Movie Ever Has   Batman&#39;s film look usually does a good job of adapting his character for the big screen, with one detail making its live-action debut in cosplay form!   


 Hush&#39;s Dangerous and Deadly Nature Comes To Life in New DC Cosplay 

 




A character introduced in the seminal Batman story titled Batman: Hush, by Jeff Loeb and Jim Lee, Tommy Elliott was one of Bruce Wayne’s closest friends pre-Crime Alley tragedy and inexplicably followed in Bruce’s footsteps by orchestrating the deaths of his own parents. Eventually returning to Gotham to make Bruce’s life a living hell both in and out of his Batman costume, Hush and his bandage-wrapped head, long trench coat, and dual pistols have, along with his plans to make Bruce believe that a then-still-dead Jason Todd had returned from the grave, been a consistent thorn in Batman’s side ever since his debut.

A set of images photographed by @pixelens._, the first post is a close-up of Brad as he brandishes a large hunting knife (with Batman’s reflection in it, no less), nailing Hush’s disgusting mummified look perfectly and honing in on the terrifying nature of his character. Giving a wider view of Brad in the next two posts as he assaults a hapless Gothamite and stands ready for another bout of violence, his Hush not only looks the part as a comic-accurate version of the villain but with a dirtied coat, sculpted bodysuit drawing parallels to Batman’s own outfit, and, of course, a psychotic look that only Tommy Elliott can provide, Brad succeeds in bringing a character to life whose only true representation on screen came from the now canceled Batwoman television show.






 New Cosplay Shows What Hush Should Look Like In the DCEU 

 

So although Hush does still pop up in Batman comics from time to time, it’s been a while since he’s really stuck it to Gotham’s protector and his extended Bat-Family, with the idea of him making the transition into the live-action space now a plausible reality after seeing what Brad Johnson (@bradman.cosplay) and @pixelens._ have come up with here. Hush deserves more respect as a staple villain of Batman lore, and now that he finally has a cosplay design worthy of that respect, it’s time to bring him into the DCEU proper.
