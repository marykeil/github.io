  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Each of the Avengers was a solo hero first, and many of them aren&rsquo;t great team players. Spider-Man neglected his responsibilities, while U.S. Agent mistreated his allies.
Others have turned on their fellow heroes in big ways - Captain Marvel and Iron Man&rsquo;s
Civil War
crimes were truly despicable.
Then there are those who simply never belonged on the team, like Hulk and the Irredeemable Ant-Man.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While the Avengers may be Earth&rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them nice people - here are the 15 biggest jerks to join the team.</p>
<p>While the Avengers may be Earth&rsquo;s Mightiest Heroes, that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make them nice people. Each of the heroes on the Avengers roster started out as a solo crime-fighter, and many aren&rsquo;t actually cut out for a team-based way of life. There are those who never stop needling their fellow heroes, those who endanger their teammates through arrogance, and even those who have violently betrayed the Avengers.
In this list, Screen Rant will name the 15 biggest jerks to ever be included on the team under the original Avengers charter. Their placement will be decided solely on how they treated their fellow teammates, rather than prior history or the influence of outside forces - hence why former villains like Sandman and the Red Hulk don&rsquo;t appear. Teams like the Young Avengers, Dark Avengers and U.S.Avengers also won&rsquo;t be considered, but chartered spin-off teams like the Secret Avengers and Uncanny Avengers will.</p>
<p>15  Wolverine
Logan Is One of the Most Contentious Avengers Ever</p>
<p>Wolverine&rsquo;s catchphrase says it all - &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the best there is at what I do, but what I do isn&rsquo;t very nice.&rdquo; Wolvie was officially welcomed onto the team in Brian Michael Bendis and David Finch&rsquo;s New Avengers #6, after Tony Stark convinced Steve Rogers that their new Avengers roster needed a killer.
This would eventually prove to cause major issues with the team structure - after the Avengers found out about Wolverine missions with X-Force, Wasp and Captain America tore him to pieces, though Thor insisted he&rsquo;d done nothing wrong. Later, in Avengers vs X-Men, Captain America had him (literally) kicked out of the team&rsquo;s quinjet due to his intention to murder Hope Summers.
I won&rsquo;t serve with him. He&rsquo;s a killer and never should have been an Avenger.
– The Wasp (Uncanny Avengers vol. 1 #9)</p>
<p>However, as far as this list is concerned, none of this counts towards Wolverine&rsquo;s jerk status - his membership of X-Force wasn&rsquo;t connected to his Avengers service, and he only attempted to kill Hope due to a prior agreement between the two, when she feared her powers would destroy the planet. Instead, he appears on this list because of his consistent habit of antagonizing other members of the team. Logan took every opportunity to prod his teammates, to the point where even the mild-mannered Spider-Man threw him out a window after he repeatedly hit on his wife Mary Jane Watson (including after Spider-Man was presumed dead.)</p>
<p>14  Spider-Man
Spider-Man Is a Terrible Team Player</p>
<p>&hellip;Not that Spider-Man was a great teammate either. While Spidey is nowhere near as cruel as Wolverine, he is among Marvel&rsquo;s worst team players. Spider-Man&rsquo;s nervous joking got on his teammates&rsquo; nerves, and he constantly ignored them and dropped out of contact - Amazing Spider-Man Annual #2 (Jed Mackay, Karla Pacheco, Juan Ferreyra, Eleonora Carlini) even revealed Spider-Man set Captain America&rsquo;s vital Avengers briefings to go to his spam folder.
As an Avenger, Spider-Man was just plain inconsiderate, to the point that even when he was possessed by the uber-arrogant Doctor Octopus for months, most heroes believed he was just going through a particularly obnoxious phase. In Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King&rsquo;s Ransom #1 (Nick Spencer, Roge Antonio), Wolverine lays out why the other Avengers don&rsquo;t trust Spider-Man, explaining that he&rsquo;s simply never there for his teammates.</p>
<p>13  Captain Marvel
Carol Danvers Has an Authoritarian Streak a Mile Wide</p>
<p>Whether leading Alpha Flight or the Avengers, Captain Marvel is a major power in the Marvel Universe, and she has a bad habit of using that fact to trample over her teammates. The most egregious example is Civil War II, where Carol imposed a fascistic new policy of imprisoning people based on precognitive visions, and even killed Tony Stark when he opposed her (thankfully, this being comics, he got better.) She was also on the Pro-Registration side during the original Civil War, and took down former allies like Julia Carpenter&rsquo;s Arachne with a vengeance.
This thing between me and you? It is not forgotten, and it&rsquo;ll never be forgiven.
– Arachne (Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #13)</p>
<p>However, Carol also has a long history of breaking the team&rsquo;s most important rules - and especially killing their enemies. Carol allowed Puppet Master to kill himself, and stabbed the Master of the World to death during the &lsquo;Kang Dynasty&rsquo; arc so his weaponry could be used against Kang. While she currently leads the team in Marvel canon, Carol&rsquo;s authoritarianism and preference for lethal tactics have always been out of step with what the team is meant to embody.</p>
<p>12  Moondragon
Moondragon Considered the Avengers Beneath Her</p>
<p>A powerful psychic with a tangled history involving the Mad Titan Thanos, Moondragon was raised in isolation on Titan, and came to Earth with little in the way of people skills. Moondragon considered herself a higher lifeform than other humans - akin to a god - and often used her powers to force them to live as she thought best.
Who the heck does she think she is? &hellip; And I proposed her for membership! So much for my record of infallibility.
– Iron Man (Avengers vol. 1 #151)</p>
<p>Moondragon leaves the Avengers in issue #151 (Gerry Conway, Jim Shooter, Steve Englehart, and George Perez), where her parting speech is peppered with thought balloons from her teammates expressing their relief that the team snob is moving to another planet. Love eventually softened Moondragon&rsquo;s attitude, and she has found a more lasting home alongside her partner Phyla-Vel and the Guardians of the Galaxy.
: Marvel&rsquo;s Real Most Powerful Team Make the Avengers Look Like Ants</p>
<p>11  Hawkeye
Hawkeye Took His Hatred of Authority Out on Captain America</p>
<p>While today he&rsquo;s seen as a member in good standing thanks to the MCU, Clint Barton was introduced as a major thorn in Steve Rogers&rsquo; side. Possessing an inate hatred of authority, Hawkeye constantly disrespected Captain America, nicknaming the Man Out of Time &ldquo;Methuselah&rdquo; and insinuating to the press that the Super Soldier was no longer fit to lead - seen best in Mark Waid and Barry Kitson&rsquo;s Avengers: Four. Captain America hit back with some incredibly harsh training, and today the two respect each other - however, Hawkeye has quit the team out of anger so many times, it&rsquo;s become a running joke.</p>
<p>10  Namor
Marvel&rsquo;s Most Arrogant Hero Is a Major Avengers Ally&hellip; and Villain</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s essentially Namor&rsquo;s purpose in life to be a huge jerk, as the ruler of Atlantis sees himself as the embodiment of his nation and loathes taking orders from others. While Namor is a little more deferential to Captain America due to their service together in World War II, he&rsquo;s insulted pretty much every hero in existence, and has fought against the Avengers as often as he&rsquo;s fought alongside them.</p>
<p>9  U.S. Agent (aka John Walker)
John Walker Has Never Been Accepted by the Avengers</p>
<p>John Walker was always intended as a jerk, and only joined the Avengers&rsquo; West Coast team in the first place because the government insisted on his oversight (John Byrne&rsquo;s West Coast Avengers #44.) While Walker is willing to sacrifice himself to help others, he&rsquo;s also a zealot whose jingoistic perspective has often brought him to blows with the Avengers. With his own perspective on the greater good, U.S. Agent has worked for both Doctor Doom and the Kingpin, though he&rsquo;s also enjoyed short stints with the Avengers, usually ending with a fight or a string of insults, and has engaged in truly vicious fights with everyone from Hawkeye to Spider-Woman.
He&rsquo;s the worst of us. Authoritarians like John Walker don&rsquo;t understand that all they are is fear. Fear of criminals, fear of a changing world, fear of losing power&hellip;
– Daredevil (Daredevil vol. 7 #5)</p>
<p>8  Hulk
Hulk Is More an Avengers Villain Than a True Member</p>
<p>Technically a founding member of the Avengers, Hulk was so anti-social that he ditched the team in their second ever issue (from Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.) Hulk never felt the other heroes trusted him, and was prone to lashing out. While they&rsquo;ve called on him in emergencies, Hulk is generally treated as a pariah, even when he&rsquo;s in the right.
Fans of the Green Goliath got some payback in Immortal Hulk #47 (Al Ewing and Joe Bennett), where the Devil Hulk persona asked the Avengers which part of their job was hardest - patting themselves on the back afterwards, or getting the boot polish off their tongues.
: Which Marvel Hero Was The Worst Leader of The Avengers?</p>
<p>7  Quicksilver
Frustration &amp; Arrogance Have Defined Pietro&rsquo;s Avengers Career</p>
<p>Quicksilver has always been one of the Avengers&rsquo; biggest jerks, but at least he has an excuse. Not only has Pietro Maximoff been the subject of racism and prejudice for most of his life, but his powers also mean that he experiences everyone&rsquo;s else&rsquo;s behavior in slow motion. In X-Factor #87 (Peter David, Joe Quesada), he explains that his entire life is like being stuck behind someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to use an ATM.
However, this constant frustration can&rsquo;t justify some of Pietro&rsquo;s darker moments. He&rsquo;s betrayed the Avengers multiple times - framing them for treason, and even coercing Scarlet Witch into changing all of reality in House of M. He was a jerk to Captain America when he first joined the team, and was openly prejudiced against synthetic life when Vision and Scarlet Witch got together (one of the occasions where Moondragon stepped in to literally change his mind.)</p>
<p>6  Irredeemable Ant-Man (Eric O&rsquo;Grady)
From Villain to&hellip; Villain?</p>
<p>A former criminal who ended up with the Ant-Man armor, Eric O&rsquo;Grady mainly used his powers as a peeping Tom before being recruited for Captain America&rsquo;s Secret Avengers team. Eric even dug up the body of former Ant-Man Scott Lang to steal his equipment, and spied on fellow heroes like Captain Marvel. Eric O&rsquo;Grady technically died saving a child in Secret Avengers #23 (Rick Remender, Gabriel Hardman), but was succeeded by a robotic double with all his memories.
In a smart twist on the usual heroic sacrifice, his synthetic replacement decided that his heroic death hadn&rsquo;t actually been worth it, betraying the Avengers and returning to a life of villainy, now using the codename &lsquo;Black Ant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5  Iron Man
Tony Stark&rsquo;s Arrogance Is Unparalleled</p>
<p>For as much as he&rsquo;s done for the Avengers, Iron Man&rsquo;s long tenure on the team means he&rsquo;s also done some truly terrible things to them. The obvious example is Civil War, where Iron Man locked many of his allies up in the Negative Zone. However, he also plotted behind their backs with the Illuminati and betrayed them as a pawn of Kang the Conqueror.
I want to know what the hell made you think this was your job to do? Who made you the moral compass of us? How could you lay down with the people you&rsquo;ve laid down with? Tell me, &ldquo;Director Stark,&rdquo; tell me, was it worth it? Was it worth it?
– Captain America (Civil War: The Confession #1)</p>
<p>Tony stole She-Hulk&rsquo;s powers, beat up Stingray, exiled Hulk into space, toyed with Daredevil by restoring his sight, and even bulled the Avengers&rsquo; beloved butler Jarvis. All those extreme examples are built on top of Tony&rsquo;s constant sarcastic commentary, and a general attitude that as the &ldquo;ultimate futurist&rdquo; he knows better than anyone else.</p>
<p>4  Ares
The God of War Was No Hero</p>
<p>The literal God of War, Ares was recruited onto the Mighty Avengers post-Civil War (in Brian Michael Bendis and Frank Cho&rsquo;s Mighty Avengers #1), when Tony needed new heroes to replace those he&rsquo;d ostracized. Ares was an arrogant misogynist who regarded humans with disdain, and often went off-mission to satisfy his own desires - even beating Wonder Man unconscious so he&rsquo;d be free to try and kill his half-brother Hercules. When Norman Osborn came to power, Ares immediately betrayed Tony&rsquo;s team and joined the Dark Avengers, seeing little difference between the groups from his godly perspective.</p>
<p>3  Swordsman
A Traitor in the Avengers&rsquo; Midst</p>
<p>Explicitly joining the team in order to betray them, Swordsman was a criminal who used his past with Hawkeye to con his way onto the team. While Swordsman later had a change of heart and was heroically killed by Kang, the vast majority of his time with the team was just a long con to help cover up his criminal activities.</p>
<p>2  Doctor Druid
The Avengers&rsquo; Worst Leader Ever</p>
<p>One of few Avengers to become an outright villain, Doctor Druid was a magic user who joined the team in Avengers #278 (Roger Stern, John Buscema). Utterly arrogant, he constantly undermined team-leader Monica Rambeau and was disliked by the team, but eventually used his powers to force them to accept him as their new leader.
She-Hulk was so traumatized by the experience that - once Druid was out of the picture - she quit the team, leading them to essentially disband. Druid sought redemption later in life, but has generally been depicted as a self-serving villain in modern stories.</p>
<p>1  Hank Pym
Abuse, Betrayal and Jealousy</p>
<p>Marvel&rsquo;s most famous &lsquo;jerk hero,&rsquo; Hank Pym will never escape the panel in The Avengers #213 (James Shooter, Bob Hall) where he struck his wife and teammate Janet Van Dyne, aka the Wasp. This character-defining moment was actually a real-world accident - Hank was meant to have accidentally hit Jan while not looking, but the art depicts deliberate violence, and Marvel ran out of time to fix it (as per Jim Shooter&rsquo;s article &lsquo;Hank Pym was Not a Wife-Beater&rsquo; at JimShooter.com.)
The Dimensional Wave Inducer is a powerful device, Hank. It&rsquo;s big science. And I don&rsquo;t trust you with big science.
– Reed Richards (The Mighty Avengers vol. 1 #25)</p>
<p>However, whatever the origin, the original Ant-Man&rsquo;s attack on his wife has been written as domestic violence ever since - and there are certainly many scenes of verbal abuse preceding the actual blow. Hank also built a robot to attack the Avengers (hoping to play hero when it arrived), and has long seen the other Avengers as competition rather than friends and allies, constantly fighting to outshine them. One of his most uncomfortable acts was taking on Janet&rsquo;s codename after she was killed in Secret Invasion, despite other Avengers pointing out it was in deeply poor taste.
In more recent stories, Hank Pym has been retconned as having bipolar disorder, and several of his darkest deeds were explained away as the acts of a Skrull imposter. However, even given this context, Hank has long been established as a self-important abuser who has always seen the other Avengers not as friends or true allies, but as competition for the spotlight he believes he deserves.</p>
