## Literature Review

Marvel Comics&#39; Predator will launch its third series in three years, continuing the adventures of Theta Berwick as she hunts down Yautja.




Marvel Comics&#39; Predator series is continuing with a third launch, featuring a Super Predator and Yautja-killer Theta Berwick. A third iteration of the series is coming soon. Theta will be taking the fight to the Predators with a new goal in mind.




The latest Predator comic series from Marvel have all centered on one primary heroine: Theta Berwick. There have been two complete series, with the next coming in 2024. The first, Predator (2022), introduced Theta, whose parents were killed by a Yautja, which she maimed. The arc followed her as she sought the monster with three mandibles to get revenge. The next series, Predator (2023), introduced the heroine to a group of humans captured by the Predators for training.

          

Now, Predator: The Last Hunt (2024) will expand further on the story with Theta still in the role of heroine. With only a partial rescue possible in her last face-off with the Yautja, she is ready to take on more with the aim of saving more humans. Each series has increased the threat level and this third series will likely be no exception. This Yautja hunter already has thirty-two kills under her belt and she&#39;s ready to tally up a few more.

Ed Brisson has led the current vision for Marvel&#39;s latest Predator comics, working with Kev Walker, Netho Diaz, and many more creative minds. Brisson will return for the third series, this time partnering with Francesco Manna. Each series has presented new Yautja for Theta to face, with new mask designs and details. In the covers for the upcoming four-issue miniseries, fans can see a peek at the new &#34;Super Predator.&#34; Covers for Predator: The Last Hunt #1 are being illustrated by Cory Smith, Francesco Manna, Paco Medina, Sergio DÃ¡vila, and one more artist who has yet to be announced.


For years, Theta has hunted and killed Predators in her search for the one that killed her parents. Now she&#39;s on a mission to free the human captives from the Predators&#39; game preserve. But when a Super Predator is on the loose, even a seasoned hunter like Theta can become prey...

 Predator: The Last Hunt Continues Latest Marvel/Fox Comic Approach 
          

The acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney has resulted in several new Marvel Comic series, including Predator and Alien. These series have been tackled using a multi-series approach. An arc or two covers one series, which is then elaborated on in another. The latest Alien series just began this November, which is now the fourth Marvel has published since the acquisition was finalized. This has helped to keep arcs continued in a smaller series, but does result in a somewhat bizarre approach since there are now four different Alien #1 issues for each since they started in 2021. While this is strange and could be confusing, the self-contained episodic series approach has resulted in a very linear and easy-to-follow story arc progressions. Soon, the newest Predator will enter the ring, bringing the next big &#34;Super Predator&#34; threat.




Predator: The Last Hunt #1 will be available from Marvel Comics on February 21.
