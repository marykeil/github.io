# DC Officially Admits Michael Keaton s Batsuit Has an Unforgivable Flaw


## SUMMARY 



  Batman #140 calls out the flaw in Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman &#39;89 Batsuit for its stiff neck, which limited head movement.   The Batsuit&#39;s lack of mobility puts Batman at a major disadvantage in combat, as shown when Bruce easily kicks the &#39;89 Zur-En-Arrh in the back of the head.   This comic serves as a reminder that Batman&#39;s costume design should prioritize mobility and reduce limitations to maximize his abilities.

## Literature Review

As Batman takes on an army of twisted variants, he points out the greatest disadvantage found in Michael Keatonâ€™s Batsuit from the 1989 film.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #140!Out of all the Batsuits in the DC Universe, one has a flaw that has been officially called out. In his mind, Bruce Wayne faces an army of Batmen, putting him up against twisted variants of notable Dark Knights. But only Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman from the &#39;89 film series has a flaw that the Prime Batman can&#39;t abide by.




In Batman #140 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jimenez, Bruce is trapped in his own mind as the Batman of Zur-En-Arr fights the Joker. Bruce is forced to fight an army of Zur-En-Arrhs, all modeled after Dark Knights from across the multiverse.

          

Bruce manages to turn the tables on the Zur-En-Arrh variants and takes them out one by one. After defeating a sinister Batman &#39;66, Bruce fights one similar to Michael Keaton in Batman. While this Zur-En-Arrh has decent weapons, Bruce boasts that the one advantage he has is being able to turn his head before delivering a powerful kick to his foe.


 Batman &#39;89&#39;s Batsuit is Called Out For Its Stiff Neck 
          




Across numerous adaptations of DC properties, there have been hundreds of Batsuits worn by various iterations of the Dark Knight. But one of the more hotly-debated costumes was the one created for the 1989 film Batman. This Batsuit&#39;s cowl was made with rubber, which prevented Batman&#39;s actor Michael Keaton from moving his head, forcing him to turn his body to see on either side of him. Keaton wasn&#39;t the only Batman actor plagued by this problem as it was a trend that lasted through to The Dark Knight when Christian Bale&#39;s Bruce got a new Batsuit that enabled head movement.

Fans have all had their say about how inefficient a Batsuit that can&#39;t move its neck is. But for the first time in DC canon, this flaw is being called out, and by the Prime Bruce Wayne no less. In this comic alone, Bruce faces off against a lot of different Zur-En-Arrhs based on different Batman from the multiverse. But the only costume he directly insults is the one that originated in Tim Burton&#39;s Batman. While it&#39;s meant as a fun, meta jab at the maligned Batsuit, Bruce raises a good point. A costume that prevents a Batman from turning his head is always going to put him at a major disadvantage.






 Batsuits Need as Much Mobility as Possible 
          

The 1989 Batsuit was limited in design based on what was available at the time. While the costume made for a good movie, in combat, it&#39;s woefully outclassed by a costume that allows greater mobility. Bruce is easily able to kick the &#39;89 Zur-En-Arrh in the back of the head because he can&#39;t look back fast enough. While it&#39;s not meant as a serious slam towards a decades-old Batsuit, it does work as a good reminder that Batman needs to reduce as many limitations as possible when it comes to costume design. Fortunately, the DC Universe&#39;s Batman has all the mobility he needs for his head.

Batman #140 is on sale now from DC Comics.
