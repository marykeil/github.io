# 2023 Upgraded Joker Like Never Before - Across ALL DC Media


## SUMMARY 



  In 2023, DC gave the Joker a multiversal-level upgrade, bringing him back stronger than ever.   The Joker&#39;s true origin was revealed as a by-product of a man named Darwin Halliday, who revived every dead Joker and empowered them.   The presence of Darwin Halliday in alternate universes causes dead Jokers to return, living Jokers to become more violent, and some Jokers to gain powers, potentially posing a threat to multiple Earths.

## Literature Review

The Joker is a character who has made an appearance in almost every single Batman property, and DC gave him a multimedia upgrade this year.




The Joker is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable villains in comic book history, and one of DC&#39;s most iconic characters. As such, he has appeared in almost every piece of Batman media ever made, and in 2023 DC gave The Joker a multiversal-level upgrade. No matter what universe Joker was in, whether he was dead or alive, he&#39;s now back and stronger than ever.




One of the most shocking reveals of 2023 for DC was the reveal of the Joker&#39;s true origin, from Batman #135 – by Chip Zdarsky, Mike Hawthorne, Jorge Jimenez, Mikel Janin, Adriano Di Benedetto, Tomeu Morey, Romulo Fajardo, and Clayton Cowles. This radical change to the character established Joker as a by-product of a man named Darwin Halliday.



          

Halliday is a man who was meant to be the Joker but never became him. This led to him becoming obsessed with the Joker, and when he went on a tear across the multiverse, he not only revived every Joker who has ever been killed, but he begins creating more Jokers and empowering them.

                  Joker Is Gotham&#39;s Most Tragic Villain (Because His Madness CAN Be Cured)   The Joker may be one of Gotham&#39;s worst criminals, but his status as such is made all the more tragic considering he absolutely can be &#34;cured.&#34;   





 The Joker Is Alive In Every Universe Halliday Visits 


          

The Joker has appeared in almost every alternate universe that DC has bothered to explore. Sometimes the Joker is killed off quickly, as in the Injustice universe. Sometimes the Joker is a major player in these alternate universes, and sometimes he doesn&#39;t even exist there at all. This all changed with Batman #135, where Darwin Halliday went on a rampage across the Multiverse. Every universe he visited was affected in different ways. If there was no Joker, one would appear; if there was a Joker, but he was dead, he&#39;d revive, and if there was a living Joker, he&#39;d become significantly more violent and even gain unexpected new powers.

It was shown that Darwin&#39;s presence causes any dead Joker to return and any living Joker to become significantly more violent – but there&#39;s an even more disturbing effect Darwin has as well. It&#39;s stated and shown that some Jokers even begin exhibiting powers. For example, when Batman Beyond&#39;s Joker attacks the Batcave, he seems to do it with heat vision, blowing a hole in the Batcave with nothing but his red glowing eyes. The Joker has always been one of the most dangerous villains that DC has to offer, so the idea of Joker gaining superpowers across the Multiverse could spell the end of multiple Earths.






 This Year Elevated Joker Like Never Before 


          

DC is no stranger to playing around with their characters and adding in new things. That said, Joker by far had the biggest power upgrade in 2023. Every single Joker who&#39;s ever died in a universe that Darwin visited has been instantly revived. This is awful news for places like Kingdom Come or Injustice. Universes where the Joker was already alive now seem to be displaying powers, as seen in Batman Beyond and the Tim Burton Batman universe. This is the biggest power upgrade DC has ever given a character, since it&#39;s a multiversal one that affects nearly every version of The Joker that has ever existed.



Batman #135 is available now from DC Comics!
