## Literature Review

Carnage is one of Marvel&#39;s most dangerous symbiotes, and Cletus Kasady took this to the next level by using Tony Stark&#39;s company as a host.




When the Carnage symbiote abandoned its original host, Cletus Kasady, the terrifying human killer replaced it with a new form created from the building that houses Tony Stark&#39;s company. The Marvel Universe is full of terrifying villains and Cletus Kasady is one of the most terrifying villains in the Marvel Universe. Even without the Carnage symbiote, Cletus has still managed to be a major threat to Marvel&#39;s heroes. When Cletus decided to prove that he didn&#39;t need Carnage to make a name for himself, he used the Extrembiote to fuse himself with Tony Stark&#39;s building.




During the events of Carnage #13 by Alex Paknadel, Fran Galan, Erick Arciniega, and Joe Sabino, Cletus is recovering from a wound inflicted on him by Miles Morales. Wanting to fix the wound and become even stronger, Cletus goes to Stark Industries and forces the scientists there to fuse him with a giant suit of armor.



          



Cletus is then able to fuse himself with the entire building through the use of his Extrembiote, which allows him to then take over all of New York. This causes massive chaos and even allows Carnage to tap into every Stark Industries product around the city, which enables him to control the civilians, driving everyone insane for his amusement.

                  &#34;The Helhound&#34;: Carnage&#39;s New Sidekick Is Already One of Marvel&#39;s Most Powerful Symbiotes   Carnage #5 introduced the killer symbiote&#39;s new sidekick, Spike â€“ who quickly and quietly climbed the ranks of Marvel&#39;s most powerful symbiotes ever.   





 Cletus Kasady Gets A Major Upgrade From Stark Tech 


          



When people talk about Carnage, they typically think of the symbiote as being inseparable from Cletus Kasady. This has been a point in the comics before, that Cletus and Carnage fused so perfectly that they&#39;re nearly inseparable. But they have had their disagreements in the past. When Carnage left to become a god, Cletus was left alone with the Extrembiote, the fusion of Iron Man&#39;s armor and one of the King in Black&#39;s symbiote dragons. This mindless symbiote was piloted by Cletus&#39; codex, which essentially functioned as his conscience and soul. This paved the way for Cletus&#39; attempt to make a name for himself separate from Carnage, and it had deadly consequences for New York.

By fusing with Tony Stark&#39;s building, Cletus gains access to every piece of technology in New York that Tony&#39;s company has made. He is then able to use a symbiote frequency to drive anyone who hears it insane; and with direct access to everyone&#39;s cell phone, it goes very, very badly, very quickly. Cletus proves his point that he doesn&#39;t need the Carnage symbiote. Cletus transforms into essentially a kaiju and goes on a rampage throughout New York, which is amplified by the mob he&#39;s driven insane to function as his army. All of this chaos is entirely because of Cletus&#39; feeling that Carnage has overshadowed him.






 Carnage Reigns Over New York City 


          



Cletus Kasady has gone on several rampages across the Marvel Universe, particularly after the Maximum Carnage event. But every time Cletus has gone on a rampage, he&#39;s done it with the help of the Carnage symbiote. This eventually cemented in the minds of both the Marvel Universe and readers that Cletus isn&#39;t dangerous without the Carnage symbiote. Using the Extrembiote and Tony Stark&#39;s tech, Cletus Kasady proved once and for all that he is one of the most dangerous villains in the Marvel Universe, even without the Carnage symbiote.
