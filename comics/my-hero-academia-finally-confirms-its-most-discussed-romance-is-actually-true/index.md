Summary

  Ochako&#39;s long-awaited confession of love for Deku not only pleases fans, but also brings a fresh approach to the expected romance.   Ochako&#39;s strategy to address Toga&#39;s obsession with their shared love for Deku proves effective in reining her back in.   The most impactful element of Ochako&#39;s confession is not her love for Deku, but her appreciation for Toga&#39;s unique smile, fulfilling the villain&#39;s desire for acceptance.  







It feels like years since My Hero Academia last addressed the potential romance between Deku and Ochako Uraraka. Yet, the series just confirmed that at least Ochako is officially in love with Deku, which she expresses in a powerful display that is sure to please My Hero Academia fans who&#39;ve been waiting for Deku and Ochako&#39;s romance to truly blossom. Apart from happening right when it should, how Ochako does so masterfully keeps the expected confession surprisingly fresh.

In chapter #394 of My Hero Academia by Kohei Horikoshi, Ochako continues her efforts to connect with a rampaging Himiko Toga whose endless clones have been creating a massive problem for Japan&#39;s heroes.

          

As Ochako basically tells her life story to Himiko, she eventually gets to the part of her life where she fell in love with Deku before reaching where she is right now on her life&#39;s journey at the specific moment.





 My Hero Academia&#39;s Uraraka Confirms She Loves Deku 
          

Before this latest development, My Hero Academia had conspicuously moved away from the romance between Deku and Ochako, which had once been a major plot line in the story. The cute interactions between the two not only ceased to exist, but a few scenes teased the romance without truly delivering. A more recent example occurred in My Hero Academia when Ochako confessed to Deku that she was trying not to view Toga as a victim. Another transpired when Ochako announced Deku&#39;s greatest qualities via a loudspeaker to help appeal to a mob that wanted to sacrifice him.

This latest development is the perfect follow-up to Ochako and Toga&#39;s infamous interaction on the heels of the Paranormal Liberation War. When Toga first proclaimed her admiration for Ochako, the villain said that what connected them was the fact they both loved Deku. However, Toga later appeared to have moved on from her obsession with Ochako, which recently became problematic for hero-kind when Himiko skyrocketed to the top as one of the most threatening villains in the final war. The pressure this put on Ochako to appeal to Toga couldn&#39;t have been greater. To rein her back in, it made sense that Ochako would have to address the very thing that Toga saw connected the two of them: their shared love for Deku.






 Uraraka Also Makes a Major Confession to Toga 
          

In a shocking twist, Ochako may have finally confessed her feelings for Deku, but the confession wasn&#39;t presented as the scene&#39;s most important element. Not only did Ochako sandwich the long-awaited words between two other thoughts, but they aren&#39;t what enable Ochako to reach Toga on an emotional level. It&#39;s the fact that Ochako says she thinks Himiko&#39;s smile is special and cute. How other people, including Toga&#39;s parents, negatively viewed her smile was revealed to be one of the villain&#39;s most traumatic memories when the series first showed her flashback many chapters ago.

All Toga ever wanted was for other people to accept her (and her smile). In fact, that was one of the main reasons why she joined the League of Villains, and now Ochako has finally given Toga what she always wanted outside the League of Villains. It&#39;s appropriate that My Hero Academia chose to place the most weight on Toga&#39;s deepest insecurities while allowing Ochako to do so herself without relying on Deku.
