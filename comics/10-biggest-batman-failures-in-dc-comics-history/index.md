 10  Batman Couldn&#39;t Stop the Joker Killing Sarah Essen 
Detective Comics #741, Devin Grayson, Greg Rucka, Dale Eaglesham, Damion Scott
        

Whenever the Joker is running free, innocent people always pay the price. At the end of “No Man’s Land”, the Clown Prince of Crime kidnaps several orphans to put a cap on the awful year Gotham had just experienced. The Bat-Family searched high and low for the villain, but the person to find him was Sarah Essen, Commissioner Gordon’s wife. Joker managed to disarm Sarah by throwing an infant at her and shooting her after she caught it. After realizing what the Joker has done, Batman doesn’t even bother interfering with Gordon, giving him a chance to end the Joker’s life.





 9  The Justice League Almost Died Because of Batman&#39;s Failsafes 
JLA: Tower of Babel, Mark Waid, Howard Porter, Steve Scott
        

The Dark Knight always thinks ahead and that’s something that usually makes him a great hero. However, in the “Tower of Babel” story arc of JLA, Batman came under fire for his tendency to be prepared. Bruce’s plans to take down his allies in the Justice League were compromised and used by Ra’s al Ghul to attack the League. The team survived, but the people that Batman trusted were put through hell because of Batman’s contingencies. The Justice League was so hurt they even attempted to officially vote Bruce off the team, though he left before he could be kicked out.





 8  Batman&#39;s Brother Eye Satellite Was Hijacked by Maxwell Lord 
The Omac Project, Greg Rucka, Jesus Saiz, Cliff Richards, Bob Wiacek
        

Batman’s paranoia was at an all-time high after Identity Crisis when he discovered he’d been mind-wiped by his Justice League comrades. Bruce constructed a satellite called Brother Eye to keep watch on the rest of the superhero community. Unfortunately, this satellite fit right into the evil Maxwell Lord’s plans to eradicate DC’s metahuman population. Lord hijacked the satellite and used it to enact a plan with Lord’s O.M.A.C.s to take out the various heroes of the world. While Wonder Woman managed to stop Lord, Batman’s tech aided in Lord’s destructive rampage.





 7  Put the Worst Person in Charge of Protecting Gotham 
Batman #498, Doug Moench, Jim Aparo
        

Batman helped Jean-Paul Valley break free from the conditioning he underwent while serving under the Order of St. Dumas. But when Bane broke Bruce’s back and put him out of commission, Batman requested that Valley fill in for him. However, in Batman’s desire to have someone looking after Gotham, Bruce was blinded to Azrazel’s flaws. Valley was still suffering from the Order’s manipulation, and the stress of being Batman was too much for Jean-Paul to take. Bruce’s decision to have Jean-Paul fill in for him gave Gotham its most unhinged and violent Batman.





 6  Batman Still Hasn&#39;t Found a Way to Fix Two-Face 
Batman: The Long Halloween, Jeph Loeb, Tim Sale
        

Harvey Dent was once a trusted ally of Batman’s. Stories like The Long Halloween showed how closely the two worked together and how effective a team they made. However, after Harvey Dent’s transformation into the villain Two-Face, Batman has failed to help his friend reclaim his old life. Sure, Batman has helped Harvey get mental health services and plastic surgery. But without fail, Dent’s insidious alter ego always manages to return and keep Harvey trapped in the darkness. Despite his constant failure to do so, Batman continues to try and bring his friend back to the side of the angels.





 5  Barbara Gordon Was Paralyzed for Years 
Batman: The Killing Joke, Alan Moore, Brian Bolland


 







In the lauded story Batman: The Killing Joke, Batman is tracking the Joker down, fearing what evil plan the criminal has in mind. Joker goes above and beyond his previous criminal acts and comes knocking on Barbara Gordon’s door. He shot Barbara, stripped her and took pictures to torment her father in a bid to drive him mad. The attack left Barbara paralyzed, and while she was able to become the superhero broker Oracle, Barbara was angry at the events of The Killing Joke for years and the attack was a stark reminder that Batman’s inability to handle the Joker had very real consequences for his allies.





 4  Batman&#39;s Youngest Child Died in Front of Him 
Batman Incorporated #8, Grant Morrison, Chris Burnham


 







Batman’s life was changed forever the day he met his son, Damian Wayne. Their relationship had a lot of ups and downs, but Bruce tried his best with Damian. However, Damian’s mother Talia wasn’t keen on her son choosing to follow in his father’s footsteps. Using her resources in Leviathan (including a hulking clone of Damian known as the Heretic), Talia had Damian killed, with Batman powerless to save his son. The death tore Batman up inside and he went through hell to resurrect his Damian. But the fact that the young Robin died on his watch was a harsh moment for Bruce.





 3  Bane Got the Drop on Batman and Killed Alfred 
Batman #77, Tom King, Mikel Janin, Tony S. Daniel
        

It wasn’t enough for Bane to break Batman’s back. During “City of Bane”, the villain masterminded a plan that drove Batman from Gotham. To ensure his compliance, Bane held Bruce’s longtime companion Alfred hostage. With no other option, Batman stayed away. However, Damian refused to let Bane win and he tried rescuing Alfred on his own. But Damian’s rescue was unsuccessful and resulted in Bane snapping Alfred’s neck. When Batman got back to the city, he was beside himself with grief over Alfred’s death, blaming himself for not trying harder to save his father figure.





 2  Batman Set Stephanie Brown Up for Failure 
Batman #633, Bill Willingham, Kinsun Loh
        

Out of all the Robins, the one that Batman treated most questionably was arguably Stephanie Brown. Tim Drake retired from the role and Stephanie Brown volunteered to take his place. Batman agreed, but he set much higher standards for Stephanie compared to previous Robins. Bruce fired Stephanie after she disobeyed him once, leading her to try and take out Black Mask to prove herself to Batman. Stephanie wound up being tortured and seemingly dying from her injuries (though that was just a cover). Bruce can treat the Robins poorly on occasion, but he never really gave Stephanie a fair shot in the first place.





 1  Jason Todd&#39;s Death Still Haunts Batman 
Batman #428, Jim Starlin, Jim Aparo


 







Of all the losses Batman has faced in his career, none have shaken him as much as the death of the second Robin, Jason Todd. Seen in the seminal “Death in the Family” story arc, Batman helped Jason track down his mother, Sheila Haywood. However, in the story&#39;s most iconic moment, Joker beats Jason viciously with a crowbar and leaves him to die in an exploding warehouse. Bruce was so disturbed by the event, that he nearly swore off having a Robin ever again. Jason did manage to come back to life, but even to this day, Batman looks back on this event with serious regret.
He may be one of the greatest forces for good in the DC Universe, but Batman is always going to have these 10 failures hanging over his head.
