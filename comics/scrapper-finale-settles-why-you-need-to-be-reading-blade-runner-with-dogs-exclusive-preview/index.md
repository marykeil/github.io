## Literature Review

Screen Rant has an exclusive preview of Scrapper #6, the conclusion to Image Comics&#39; hit series that brings dogs to the forefront of sci-fi heroism. 




Screen Rant is excited to share a preview of the finale of Scrapper from Image Comics. Scrapper #6 will conclude the fan-favorite series, which has begun to garner its own cult following. The cyberpunk-influenced canine-centered quest for justice is nearing its end - at least for now, based on its creators&#39; hopes for the future.




Scrapper began releasing in July 2023 and spans six issues. It has the creative team of Cliff Bleszinski, Alex de Campi, Ryan Kelly, and Jordie Bellaire. The series follows its titular character, Scrapper, who is a badass dog fighting against SMITE, an evil organization that has engaged in animal experimentation. He has super abilities and a stunning zoological supporting cast as his allies.



          

Bleszinski is best known for his work in the video game industry, involving Gears of War and Fortnite. His foray into comics has created an impressive partnership. Alex de Campi has worked on several comics, including Parasocial, No Mercy, Lady Zorro, and Dracula Motherf*cker! Ryan Kelly&#39;s comic work includes Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, The Books of Magic, Godzilla, and Coffin Hill, among others. Jordie Bellaire&#39;s comic credits include Batman, Wonder Woman, Comeback, and Injection.




                  X-Files Meets Ex Machina in Exclusive Preview of New Sci-Fi Series BOXED   Screen Rant has an exclusive preview of Boxed, an original graphic novel from Amazon&#39;s ComiXology originals line of digital comic content.    


 Scrapper Finale Preview Reveals More of SMITE&#39;s Villainy 
         

The preview for the sixth issue of Image Comics&#39; hit series, Scrapper, shows the leader of SMITE (Special Monopoly for Industrial Tech &amp; Engineering). As though readers need any more reason to hate the organization, he can be seen punting Captain Midnight in the pages above. This results in Scrapper leaping to attack the villain. The heroic canine&#39;s actions will likely result in a surprising twist of events based on his reaction following an intense tackle towards his foe. This might have something to do with the lack of hypnosis after the use of Captain Midnight&#39;s special abilities.




SMITE has been the primary villainous focus of the series thus far, as the organization has experimented on numerous animals. While some of the results have been intriguing, such as the power-ups, the methods and overall experimentation are generally horrific. This story has blended aspects of Blade Runner with Disney&#39;s Bolt, with an adult audience in mind and the results have been stellar. The finale will definitely be worth catching after the build-up to its climactic final battle. The technological elements and mature aspects have created a unique story that comic readers need to experience.



 Image Comics&#39; Canine Caper is A Must-Read Series 
          

Scrapper has combined the best elements of child and adulthood, merging sci-fi action with animal protagonists. This story could be described as Paw Patrol meets Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and it is one that has quickly become a highlight in 2023 comic releases. At SDCC 2023, Cliff Bleszinski mentioned wanting this series to expand beyond comics into animation, video games, and merchandise. With the finale close at hand, fans can still hope to see more of Scrapper should these goals become an eventual reality. Scrapper&#39;s initial journey is coming to an end, but more adventures would certainly be welcome.




Scrapper #6 will be released on December 13 from Image Comics.
