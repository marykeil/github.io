## Literature Review

A spinoff of the hit manga Kajiu No. 8 offers an alternative look at Third Division’s Kaiju Hunters ahead of the series&#39; anime debut.




Warning: contains SPOILERS for Kaiju No. 8: B-Side Chapter #1With its fresh take on the giant monster apocalypse, Shōnen Jump&#39;s Kaiju No. 8 distinguishes itself from the typical giant monster manga by showcasing the human struggle against these destructive creatures from a ground-level perspective. A spin-off series titled Kaiju No. 8: B-Side aims to deepen the narrative by revealing untold details about the characters, their origins, and the intricate dynamics of their relationships that drive the main storyline&#39;s intensity.




Naoya Matsumoto&#39;s Kaiji No. 8 takes place in a world where vicious Kaiju are a constant threat to humanity. In response, each nation has established its own means of dealing with the Kaiju problem. In Japan, the government created the Defense Force and tasked it with protecting the nation against all Kaiju threats.


 

The new spin-off, Kaiju No 8 B-Side, which dropped just ahead of the Spring 2024 premiere of the Kaiju No. 8 anime adaptation, takes a step back from the main character Kafka Hibino&#39;s perspective. Instead, it focuses on other characters in the Defense Force, especially Soshiro Hoshina, the Vice-Captain of the Defense Force&#39;s Third Division and Kafka&#39;s superior officer.

The main Kaiju No. 8 story focuses on Kafka Hibino, who, as a child, made a pact with his childhood friend Mina Ashiro to join the Defence Force. However, while Mina made good on her promise, Kafka lacked the physical and mental skills and settled for a job in the &#34;cleanup crew&#34; that clears disaster sites after a Kaiju battle. This all changed on the day that Kafka mysteriously turned into a Kaiju hybrid, and decided to use this dangerous power to finally achieve his dream.

Kaiju No. 8&#39;s strength is its balancing of the ongoing war between the human race and the Kaiju with Kafka&#39;s development as a key weapon of humanity against the beasts. It&#39;s an engaging story of war from the perspective of a person who - in essence - has insight on both sides of the combatants. In Kaiju No. 8, readers encounter many interesting characters, but they often get lost in the shuffle of the intense action that&#39;s at the core of the story. Kaiju No. 8 B-Side solves this issue by giving secondary and supporting characters a stage to tell their own background story leading up to the events currently happening in Kaiju No. 8.






 The Spin-Off Will Give Kaiju No. 8 Side Characters Their Spotlight 
         

Kaiju No. 8 B-Side chapter #1 focuses on how Hoshina came to occupy his position as the Vice-Captain of the Defense Force&#39;s Third Division and Kafka&#39;s superior officer. In telling his story, the chapter reveals how Hoshino came to know Mina, and how he developed a soft spot for Kafka&#39;s lack of abilities because he was also dismissed for his decision to rely on swords, rather than firearms, in fights against Kaiju.

Kaiju No. 8 stands on its own as a must-read manga, especially for fans of the kaiju genre. However, based on the first issue, Kaiju No. 8 B-Side will make Kaiju No. 8 a deeper and richer story by adding important background information and context to the main story and to its compelling side characters. This new Shonen Jump series is the perfect manga to read ahead of the anticipated debut of the Kaiju No. 8 anime.




Kaiju No. 8 is available from Viz Media and MANGA Plus.
