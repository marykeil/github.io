## Literature Review

Marvel has released a first look at one of the two interconnected books bringing the Fall of X, and the entire Krakoan era of the X-Men, to a close.




Contains Spoilers for Rise of the House of X #1 and X-Force #46!As the X-Men’s epic Krakoan Era heads towards its inevitable conclusion, Marvel has released a first look at the book where the present-day X-Men, including Cyclops and Colossus, will face down the threat of Orchis for potentially the final time. This is a story that&#39;s been years in the making, and it’s one of two interconnected series that promise to close out one of the best X-Men eras ever with a bang.




The Krakoan Era of the X-Men began with two 2019 miniseries, House of X and Powers of X (written by Jonathan Hickman, illustrated by Pepe Larraz [HoX] and R.B. Silva [PoX], colored by Marte Gracia and David Curiel and lettered by Clayton Cowles). It was through these two interlocking series that Marvel established the mutant nation of Krakoa.

          

Now, the Krakoan Era is nearing its end after almost five years. The current X-Books, falling under the banner of Fall of X, follow mutantkind’s struggle to survive after the anti-mutant hate group Orchis all but destroys Krakoa and makes pariahs out of mutants during the X-Men&#39;s 2023 Hellfire Gala with a series of coordinated false flags and tragedies. Now, Marvel has released the first look at Fall of the House of X #1 (written by Gerry Duggan and illustrated by Luca Werneck and colored by Bryan Valenza), the beginning of one of the two miniseries bowing out the Krakoan Era.





 The Krakoan Era Ends Here 
         

Like the original House of X, Fall of the House of X is centered around the present-day X-Men’s story as they begin their final battle against Orchis. Meanwhile, Fall’s sister series, Rise of the Powers of X (written by Keiron Gillen, penciled by R.B. Silva and colored by David Curiel) will focus on the dark futures that threaten to make any present-day victories irrelevant.

One of the key figures in the preview for Fall #1 is Cyclops. Gerry Duggan’s 2021 X-Men series has seen Cyclops lead the most recent incarnation of the X-Men before he’s captured by Orchis after the 2023 Hellfire Gala. For some time, the series has teased the trial of Cyclops seen in Fall’s preview, which Orchis hopes will prove to be a decisive propaganda victory for them. Meanwhile, Firestar, the X-Men’s mole within Orchis, has been in communication with Scott, but hasn’t found a way to break him out yet. Now it seems she won’t have the chance before his trial.






 Colossus is Poised For a Heroic Return 
          

Throughout the Krakoan Era, Colossus has had a rough time of it. Throughout Benjamin Percy’s X-Force (2019), Colossus has been under the control of his brother, Mikhail Rasputin, via the power of mutant writer Chronicler. Now, with Colossus killing Mikhail in the recently released X-Force (2019) #46 (written by Percy, illustrated by Robert Gill, colored by GURU-eFX and lettered by VC’s Joe Caramagna) Piotr is finally free. What remains to be seen, however, is whether Colossus can find some kind of redemption as the trial of Cyclops kicks off the X-Men’s heroic last stand in Fall of the House of X #1.



Fall of the House of X #1 will be available January 3, 2024 from Marvel Comics
