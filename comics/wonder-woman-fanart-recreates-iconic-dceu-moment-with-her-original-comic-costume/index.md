## Literature Review

Renowned artist Kerry Callen has wowed fans by transforming one of Wonder Woman&#39;s most iconic cinematic scenes into a timeless comic-style cartoon.




MAD contributor and freelance illustrator, Kerry Callen, has transformed one of Wonder Woman&#39;s most iconic moments from the DCEU into a whimsically nostalgic piece, paying homage to the Amazon Princess&#39;s first solo movie. This rendition is so clever and beautifully executed that it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Callen started a new fanart trend.




Sharing his creative work on Instagram, Kerry Callen presented a commissioned Wonder Woman piece inspired by a scene from the 2017 Wonder Woman movie. The unique twist in this rendition lies in Callen&#39;s classic comic art style. The focus is on Diana from the waist up as she deflects bullets with her renowned shield, closely mirroring the scene from the movie.

In Callen&#39;s reimagined Wonder Woman piece, he captures the essence of Diana&#39;s iconic No Man&#39;s Land Battle from the first Wonder Woman movie. The scene unfolds when Steve Trevor warns Diana that crossing No Man&#39;s Land is an impossible feat. Taking this as a personal challenge, Diana decides to lead the charge into enemy territory, successfully doing what a whole army had failed to do. This cinematic moment becomes a visual masterpiece as Diana, with her shield braced, defiantly deflects the onslaught of enemy firepower with unparalleled grace. Callen masterfully recreates this powerful moment, paying homage to the film&#39;s impactful scene in his classic comic art style.

Callen&#39;s Wonder Woman art piece is a true gem for the fandom, offering a glimpse into the classic Golden Era comic art style that is unlikely to make a resurgence in modern-day comic continuity. The comic book medium is known for its constant evolution, particularly in the realm of artistic styles. However, thanks to Callen&#39;s creativity, fans get to savor both the freshness and nostalgia of their favorite characters depicted in a unique and timeless fashion. The comments on the post speak volumes about fans&#39; appreciation, with expressions like &#34;Beautiful!! I love the Golden Age look! 🙌🏻😍&#34; and &#34;Absolutely love this&#34; resonating within the community.






 Artist Kerry Callen Could Start the Next Greatest Fanart Trend 
         

What sets Callen&#39;s piece apart is its stunning uniqueness—it&#39;s a completely new and original creation that cleverly incorporates one of the oldest comic-style renditions of Wonder Woman. Despite being crafted in 2024, the nostalgic comic art style employed by Callen transports viewers back to 1941 when Diana made her debut, showcasing a timeless quality. This innovative concept, executed with excellence, holds the potential to spark a new viral art trend. Other artists could adopt a similar approach, taking scenes from contemporary media and reinterpreting the characters in their original comic-style form. With any luck, this trend could lead to more iconic Wonder Woman scenes receiving artistic throwbacks.
