## Literature Review

Superman&#39;s new armor, sword and shield aren&#39;t just good in a fight - they replace his missing powers in some truly surprising ways.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Action Comics #1059!Superman has an unbelievable number of superpowers that he&#39;s relied on over the years to help him fight crime and take down supervillains. But now that Superman&#39;s powers have been drained and stolen by a new group of villains, he has to rely on a tried and true method of combat: a new sword and shield. While it&#39;s unusual to see the Man of Steel using weapons to combat his villains, these choices perfectly recreate his power set.




Superman&#39;s new choice of weaponry is shown off in Action Comics #1059 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, Eber Ferreira, Matt Herms, and Dave Sharpe. After Superman had his powers drained and weakened, he needed something to help him stand up against his new enemies while his powers returned, and Steel came through with a solution.



          

The Man of Steel has turned to genius inventor and hero John Henry Irons, who provided a new armored costume, which readers get to see in action as Superman fights off two members of Blue Earth. The shield proves extremely useful as Superman is able to deflect heat vision with it, and the sword allows him to help civilians by cutting them out of the wreckage - something he&#39;d usually use his heat vision to accomplish. While a sword and shield may look unusual, Steel knew what he was doing, and Superman is using the equipment to replicate his most vital powers, both offensively and to save innocents.

 Superman Shows Off His Brand New Armor 
Superman&#39;s Sword Isn&#39;t Just Offensive
         

Recently, the Blue Earth group have been working to turn the world against Superman and all other alien life. Their latest plan seems set to succeed, as they take his powers and use them to strike fear into the heart of Metropolis. However, having Superman&#39;s powers isn&#39;t the same as having his instincts or sense of purpose. What seem like purely offensive abilities in anyone else&#39;s hands can be used to save lives when wielded by the Man of Steel.

The same is true of Superman&#39;s new armor, sword, and shield - what on the face of it is clearly combat gear takes on a new meaning as he shields innocents and uses his sword not just to attack, but to free those hurt in the fight. It&#39;s a testament to who Superman is that if a sword is placed in his hand, he immediately uses it to save lives, fulfilling the same purpose as his &#39;scary&#39; heat vision, as Blue Earth would like people to see it.

Even with a Sword, Superman Manages to Be the Embodiment of Peace and Hope
          

Putting characters in new situations is a great way to keep heroes like Superman fresh, even after they&#39;ve been on over 80 years worth of adventures. Superman has been to outer space, different dimensions, and fought just about everything under the sun. Now he&#39;s being taken in a new direction where, for the time being at least, Superman has become a literal Man of Steel as he uses both sword and shield to defend Metropolis.

Action Comics #1059 is on sale November 28 from DC Comics!
