# Thor &amp; Storm Confirm Their Seemingly Similar Powers Are Totally Different


## SUMMARY 



  Thor and Storm have similar powers, but different ways of controlling them. Thor commands thunder and lightning as a king, while Storm treats the weather as an equal.   Thor asserts dominance over lightning, while Storm works in unison with the weather instead of forcing it to her will.   The distinction between Thor and Storm&#39;s approach to thunder may seem subtle, but it significantly affects their relationship with the weather, and their relationship with each other, as two of Marvel&#39;s most powerful heroes, with a similar power set.

## Literature Review

Both Thor, of the Avengers, and Storm, of the X-Men, control thunder and lightning, but that doesn&#39;t mean they control it in the same way. 




Warning: Spoilers for The Immortal Thor #4!Despite having similar powers, Storm and Thor have different means of controlling them. At face value, it&#39;s easy to assume that Storm and Thor have essentially the same powers. Storm controls the weather (with an emphasis on lightning manipulation) while Thor is a self-proclaimed God of Thunder. As it turns out, their powers are similar, indeed, but nonetheless different.




The Immortal Thor #4 –by Al Ewing, Martin Coccolo, Matthew Wilson, and VC&#39;s Joe Sabino – placed a great emphasis on unpacking the differences between the weather powers of two iconic Marvel characters, Avenger Thor and long-time X-Men member Storm, as the God of Thunder seeks to recruit the goddess.

          

It is at this moment that it is established how there is a significant distinction between the two. Thor commands thunder as a king, while Storm flows into the thunder as an equal. The distinction is subtle enough that it may not be easily noticed, but it&#39;s significant enough to affect their respective relationships to thunder.

                  Loki Isn&#39;t the Enemy Thor Deserves, But The Enemy He Needs   Loki seeks to help the God of Thunder in Immortal Thor #3–but also noting that if they must help by being Thor&#39;s enemy, they will.   





 Thor Commands Thunder as a King, Storm as an Equal 


          



At the start of Immortal Thor #4, Thor is trying to recruit people for the team he needs to oppose his new enemy, Toranos. While Loki speaks to Beta Ray Bill on his brother&#39;s behalf, Thor summons Storm from Arakko while she&#39;s in the middle of what she deems to be more pressing matters. Storm is the first person who springs to his mind when he first comes up with the conception of the team – a team that would later be conceptualized as the Thor Corps – in the previous issue. However, Storm makes it clear from the start of their conversation that she is in no mood to talk.

As Thor is trying to bring Storm onto his side for the biggest fight of his life, the subject of thunder and how they use it comes into focus. She demands Thor send her back without hearing him out, summoning thunder to strike him where he stands. Rather than ask her, Thor asks the lightning to stop hitting him, and the lightning obliges, to Storm&#39;s chagrin. Thor urges Storm not to make the lightning choose between them, like a child choosing between parents as they fight. It is at this moment that Storm points out the biggest distinction in how the heroes approach lightning and thunder.






 A Subtle, But Significant Distinction 
          

Thor asserts his dominance over the lightning, as both God of Thunder and All-Father, so much so that he can successfully demand lightning stop hitting him. He speaks to the lightning as if it is a child he just put in timeout. He manipulates thunder at his own will. Storm, however, looks to weather as an equal, and vice versa, allowing herself to flow into the thunder she commands, being more so in unison with the weather than above it in a hierarchy, instead of forcing it to her will. Thunder loves both Storm and Thor equally, but its relationship with both heroes is not the same.

The Immortal Thor #4 is on sale from Marvel now.
