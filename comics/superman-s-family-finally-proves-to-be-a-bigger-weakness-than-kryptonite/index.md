# Superman s Family Finally Proves to Be a Bigger Weakness than Kryptonite


## SUMMARY 



  As depicted in Action Comics #1060, Superman&#39;s unwavering concern for his family makes him act impulsively, leading him to endanger not only himself but also those around him.   His desire to protect his family at times clouds the Man of Steel&#39;s judgment, preventing him from thinking clearly.   Superman is willing put the entire DC Universe at risk to save his loved ones, possibly making them a greater weakness for him than Kryptonite.

## Literature Review

One of the most iconic families in the DC Universe is actually a weakness for Superman. Yes, a bigger weakness than Kryptonite. 




Warning: Spoilers for Action Comics #1060!The family of Superman might have just been proven to be a bigger weakness for the Man of Steel than Kryptonite. It&#39;s easy to call out Superman&#39;s more physical weaknesses, such as Kryptonite rock, or even magic (which actually has a loophole.) However, it is the Last Son of Krypton&#39;s connection to his family that may turn out to be his undoing in the end.




Action Comics #1060 – by the creative team of Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, Fico Ossio, Eber Ferreira, Joe Prado, Jonas Trindade, Matt Herms, Christopher Sotomayor, and Dave Sharpe – suggests that rather than a strength, family could be the Man of Steel&#39;s ultimate weakness.

          

Supes&#39; limitless concern for his family forces him to act blindly, putting the rest of the world in certain turmoil. The issue highlights how Superman completely tosses out any sense of clear judgment when his family is at stake; this could be considered a worse weakness than Kryptonite because it doesn&#39;t just endanger himself. Rather, it endangers those around him.


 Superman&#39;s Desire To Protect His Family Stops Him From Thinking Clearly 
          




Action Comics #1059 featured the entire Superman family springing into action, when the Blue Earth Movement trio attack Metropolis. This includes Super-Twins Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra, the latter of whom is unexpectedly kidnapped by Sister Shadow, who is using the Blue Earth Movement as step one in a grander scheme for herself. She traps Osul in Earth-Al-Ghul, an alternate universe overrun by the League of Assassins. Sister Shadow is one of the key figureheads of this world, where she is Janan al Ghul, the daughter of Talia al Ghul and Batman. With no one else to turn to for help, Superman seeks guidance from John Constantine.

Their investigation takes them to the Cathedral of Saint Lazarus, where Constantine advises Superman not to touch anything under any circumstances as soon as they arrive. All of a sudden, a mysterious hourglass starts echoing the voice of Superman&#39;s missing daughter. Constantine tries to assure Superman that this is a trick, but Superman doesn&#39;t listen. Instead, he touches the hourglasses, and immediately, and blows everything around them to smithereens. While Constantine is out of the picture (likely knocked out under the rubble), the remnants of the destructions emerges to be Bloodwynd and Etrigan, who Superman unknowingly releases from their confined prison.






 Superman Put The Entire DC Universe In Danger To Save His Family 
          

Lucky for Superman, they appear to be indebted to the Man of Steel, ready to return the favor by getting him to Earth al Ghul, but it can&#39;t be overlooked that Superman just unleashed two demons upon the world because he ignored clear warning signs, all too anxious to save his family. Superman&#39;s weakness is almost a double-edged sword. On one hand, it&#39;s a noble quality to spring into action at the first sign of distress. But as we see here, it also forces him to disregard his faculties. Superman fails to play things smart when his family&#39;s at stake, and it could come back to bite him.
