# How and When Marvel Introduced the  Multiverse  Concept into Official Lore


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s Multiverse was introduced in 1976&#39;s What If #1, with a story that asked &#34;What If Spider-Man Joined The Fantasitc Four?&#34;   Marvel&#39;s iconic What If...? series established the Multiverse, but it also laid a successful blueprint for telling Multiverse stories, one that the company has stuck to consistently throughout the years.   The introduction of the Multiverse in Marvel Comics has been integral to the company&#39;s success, influencing each of its major franchises, being central to crossover events, and more recently, taking a pivotal role in the MCU.

## Literature Review

The Multiverse is essential to Marvel storytelling on the page and on screen – and it all started with the company asking, &#34;What If...?&#34; 




Marvel has come to define the popular conception of a &#34;Multiverse,&#34; comprised of infinite variations of its ficitonal reality, differing from one another in ways ranging from the minute to the extreme – recently, in MCU offerings like Loki and Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, but prior to that, going back decades with its comic book explorations of alternate continuities.




While Marvel&#39;s Multiverse has an interesting pre-history, its true birth in Marvel Comics lore came with the debut of the company&#39;s iconic What If...? anthology series. What If...? #1 – written by Roy Thomas, with art by Jim Craig – set the tone for decades worth of stories to come by asking, &#34;What If Spider-Man Joined The Fantastic Four?&#34;



          

In addition to exploring the alternate possibilities of Marvel&#39;s roster of legendary characters, What If...? #1 also set a precedent, with its downbeat ending establishing that the title was a place to tell stories that deviated from the traditional narrative beats of a superhero book.

Rather than arrive at what it means to tell a multiverse story through trial and error, Marvel&#39;s efforts precede from it, by distilling the multiverse down to its essence: &#34;What if?&#34; questions.








 &#34;What If?&#34; Is The Question At The Core Of Every Multiverse Story 
         

&#34;What If Spider-Man Joined The Fantastic Four?&#34; is a relatively straightforward story – but it begins with an introduction that would ultimately change Marvel Comics forever. In a preface not unlike a Rod Serling Twilight Zone narration, cosmic character Uatu the Watcher explains to the reader that there are, in fact, countless realities, rather than just one; further, he explains, these realities hinge on possibilities, whether actualized or not. Rather than arrive at what it means to tell a multiverse story through trial and error, Marvel&#39;s efforts precede from it, by distilling the multiverse down to its essence: &#34;What if?&#34; questions.

In What If...? #1, Spider-Man joining the Fantastic Four leads to a cascade of consequences that result in Sue Storm leaving the team to become Namor&#39;s undersea bride. Spider-Man&#39;s adventures with the Four are largely fun, &#39;70s comic book fare, but with the ending, writer Roy Thomas takes the opportunity to conclude the issue in a way the average main continuity stories of the time would not have – by showing the dramatic repercussions of the heroes&#39; decisions, and leaving them with a drastically altered status quo. In this way, &#34;What If Spider-Man Joined The Fantastic Four?&#34; firmly established the kind of stories What If...? would tell during its run.






 The Multiverse Has Been Integral To Marvel&#39;s Mainstream Success 


          

By introducing the idea of the Multiverse, with its infinite storytelling possibilities, What If...? #1 gave Marvel Comics a narrative mechanism that would come to be integral to the company&#39;s fictional world, and its brand identity, over the course of the next several decades. In addition to being the engine of the long-running &#34;What If...?&#34; series, the Multiverse has played a major role for all of Marvel&#39;s major franchises. It has resulted in beloved series like Exiles, and crossover events like 2015&#39;s Secret Wars, which ended the original run of Marvel&#39;s alternate continuity Ultimate imprint, bringing key elements of it into the main continuity.

More recently, the Multiverse has been at the heart of cinematic adventures including the Spider-Verse animated films, and the latest Doctor Strange film, along with the Disney&#43; series Loki, and an animated adaptation of What If...?, putting an MCU spin on the classic comic. All of this traces back to 1976&#39;s What If...? #1 – which, in addition to establishing that the continuity familiar to Marvel readers at the time existed with a much larger Multiverse, also laid a successful blueprint for how Marvel would tell Multiverse stories moving forward, which in the long-term has proved critical to their crossover into mainstream popularity.
