## Literature Review

The Joker may be one of Gotham&#39;s worst criminals, but his status as such is made all the more tragic considering he absolutely can be &#34;cured.&#34;




The Joker is more than just a threat to Gotham City: he&#39;s also a true tragic figure. It was proved — in a 1990s crossover issue, no less — that the Joker, if given the proper medical treatment, can be cured of his madness once and for all.




The Joker&#39;s cure is detailed in the Marvel and DC crossover Spider-Man and Batman #1 by J.M. DeMatteis, Mark Bagley, Scott Hanna, Mark Farmer, Electric Crayon, and Richard Starkings. A doctor from the Marvel Universe known as Dr. Briar proves that she can cure people using a biotechnical chip that she inserts in the patient&#39;s brain. Dr. Briar first demonstrates this procedure using the serial killer Cletus Kasady before moving over to Gotham and proposing the same treatment for the Joker.

          

This technology-based procedure completely removes the patient&#39;s homicidal urges and reduces them to little more than a scared child — and it is used successfully on the Joker. While people have some reservations about her methods, it turns out that Dr. Briar is completely right and manages to cure the Joker entirely.




                  Joker&#39;s Biggest Secret Is That He&#39;s Perfectly Sane   The Joker is often considered one of the most unhinged characters in comic books, but it turns out Joker&#39;s biggest secret is that he&#39;s sane.   


 The Joker Can Be &#34;Cured&#34; Using Technology from the Marvel Universe 


          

Dr. Briar&#39;s experiment ends up being a complete success, and the Joker is rendered entirely harmless by her biotechnical chip. After the procedure, the Joker has absolutely no interest in harming others and is actually pretty cowardly overall. When Cletus manages to break his own chip, the Joker is legitimately terrified and begs Batman to keep him safe from Cletus. Dr. Briar&#39;s experiment may not have fully worked on Cletus, but that&#39;s due to Cletus&#39; blood connection to an alien symbiote. There&#39;s no reason to think that the Joker would eventually break his conditioning as well, and past examples prove it.




The Joker has been cured of his insanity a few times in DC history. One of the most famous examples is when Martian Manhunter uses his telepathy to rearrange the Joker&#39;s mind, essentially &#34;fixing&#34; his insanity. This sane version of the Joker immediately expresses regret for his actions and questions why he would even hurt so many people to begin with. The only reason he returns to insanity is because Martian Manhunter has to physically hold his mind together, a burden too great for even a Justice League member. When Manhunter stops, the Joker&#39;s mind falls apart once again.



 The Joker Can Be Made Completely Harmless 
          

The Joker is one of DC&#39;s worst serial killers, but stories like this promise that he&#39;s not completely irredeemable, and he certainly isn&#39;t incurable. Several examples have shown that the Joker&#39;s insanity can be fixed — it&#39;s just a matter of finding a feasible way to do it. The Marvel crossover featuring Dr. Briar shows, once and for all, that curing the Joker is absolutely possible under the right circumstances.
