## Literature Review

The Sentry, one of Marvel&#39;s most powerful heroes, is set to return in a brand new series--but there is one dark catch.




Warning: contains potential spoilers for The Sentry #1!




Marvel has officially named a new Sentry, but there is one dark catch. A Marvel analogue to Superman, the Sentry is one of the most powerful heroes on Earth. The Sentry has been missing in action since the King in Black crossover event. Now, in a preview for The Sentry #1, a new version of the titular hero arises, and she promises to be the first of many.

The Sentry #1 will be written by Jason Loo and drawn by Luigi Zagaria. The preview opens with Misty Knight and Jessica Jones investigating an apartment building’s destruction. Knight’s scans reveal the energy signature of what destroyed the building is a match for the Sentry, but he has been missing since Knull’s attack on Earth. Nearly everyone in the building is accounted for in some fashion except for two.

         




The scene shifts to a young woman named Mallory, one of the missing persons, who discovers that she somehow now has the powers of the Sentry.

The Sentry is not only one of Marvel’s most powerful characters, but also one of their most fascinating. Bob Reynolds became the Sentry at the dawn of the Marvel Universe, sharing adventures with the Fantastic Four and Spider-Man, among others. However, when his dark side nearly destroyed Earth, Bob’s memories were altered, and all traces of his time as the Sentry were erased. Years later, Sentry’s memories returned, but he still saw himself as a threat, and once again took himself off the board. However, he could not stay away for long, and joined the Avengers, famously ripping Carnage in half during a jailbreak.





 

The Sentry had a rough go of it from there, ultimately falling prey to the manipulations of Norman Osborn before meeting his end at the hands of Knull, seeking revenge for Carnage’s death. Yet the preview for The Sentry #1 makes it clear that something happened to Bob Reynolds, something that has caused the energies that powered him to jump to someone else. While the preview leaves Bob’s final fate up in the air for the moment, it will play out in future issues.

For now, however, there is a new Sentry—and she will not be the last, as Marvel has revealed that others will receive his powers as well. On his own, the Sentry is more than a handful, able to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Thor and the Hulk. Now, Misty Knight, Jessica Jones and the rest must contend with a dozen Sentries flying around. These newcomers do not have Bob’s experiences with the powers, making them very dangerous, and in need of guidance. Conversely, they may lack the traits that made Bob so dangerous. Whatever the case, Mallory Gibbs is the new Sentry–one of Marvel’s most powerful (and darkest) heroes.

The Sentry #1 is on sale December 6 from Marvel Comics!
