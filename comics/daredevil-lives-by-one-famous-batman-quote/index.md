## Literature Review

Daredevil is one of the greatest street-level heroes that Marvel has to offer, and part of that might just be because he follows one Batman rule.




Daredevil&#39;s bizarre scheme to save his secret identity was trying to reveal that Mike Murdock — his fake twin brother — was actually the Man Without Fear, not Matt. This resulted in a video-recorded confession wherein &#34;Mike Murdock&#34; confesses to being Daredevil. He travels around the city to prove it, and in the process reveals that Daredevil lives by one iconic Batman line.




Daredevil&#39;s secret identity has been a major issue for the character over the years. One of Matt&#39;s most absurd ideas to save his identity is featured in the story &#34;The Last Will and Testament Mike Murdock&#34; from Daredevil #1.5 by Karl and Kurt Kesel, Tom Palmer, Grace Allison, and Joe Caramagna. During this story, Daredevil quotes from the Caped Crusader himself, claiming that &#34;criminals are a suspicious and cowardly lot!&#34;

          

The story as a whole features Matt and Foggy coming across an old video that Matt had videotaped in the persona of Mike Murdock, Matt&#39;s fake twin brother, in order to throw off suspicion of Matt being Daredevil by having Mike admit to it on camera as he swings throughout New York City in full Daredevil garb. As he talks to the camera, though, he ends up admitting the one Batman rule that Daredevil truly seems to live by.




                  Daredevil Shows Why Batman Can&#39;t Save Gotham with Money   Daredevil once saved his city by donating millions, but despite Bruce Wayne&#39;s wealth, this same strategy would never work for Batman in Gotham.   


 Like Batman, Daredevil Thinks Criminals Are Superstitious and Cowardly 
          

Batman is a symbol of fear that almost all criminals in Gotham are afraid of. Batman knows that just being a regular man who stands up to crime isn&#39;t enough — he has to become a symbol that strikes fear into the hearts of criminals. The iconic Batman line, of course, is &#34;criminals are a superstitious, cowardly lot.&#34; That&#39;s the entire reason that Batman created his terrifying identity. If criminals are too scared to go out at night, they&#39;re much less likely to commit crimes. This is a rule that Batman has always held himself to, and surprisingly, it seems that Daredevil holds himself to this very same rule.




Daredevil strikes fear into the criminals of New York unlike any other hero in the Marvel Universe. Characters like Spider-Man try very hard to maintain a friendly, helpful image, but Daredevil doesn&#39;t. Even Ben Urich admits that the relationship Daredevil has with the criminals of New York is unlike any other hero. When Matt Murdock&#39;s identity leaked, criminals by and large did nothing with it, and Ben Urich states that the reason for this is fear. As lighthearted as Matt can be at times, criminals legitimately do fear Daredevil and don&#39;t want to cross him in any serious way. This shows that not only does Daredevil live by this iconic Batman rule, but it actually works, too.



 Daredevil Shares Batman&#39;s Most Important Belief 
          

Batman and Daredevil come from very different backgrounds. Bruce Wayne grew up as a rich kid who suffered great tragedy — but always had every resource he needed at his fingertips. Matt Murdock grew up poor, suffered a major disability, and managed to pull himself through it and become extremely successful. On paper, the two don&#39;t really have much in common at all, but their approach to fighting crime shows that they both truly understand that criminals are a &#34;superstitious, cowardly lot.&#34; This is why Batman and Daredevil are the two greatest vigilantes in their respective worlds.




Daredevil #1.5 is available now from Marvel Comics!
