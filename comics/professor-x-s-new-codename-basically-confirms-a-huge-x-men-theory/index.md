# Professor X s New Codename Basically Confirms a Huge X-Men Theory


## SUMMARY 



  Dialogue during Doctor Doom&#39;s encounter with the X-Men hints that Charles Xavier, the X-Men&#39;s leader, is poised to increase his powers in an unprecedented way.   Xavier&#39;s potential transformation into a Dominion, a being with god-like power and intelligence, could be the catalyst for profound changes in mutantkind – for better or worse.   The X-Men&#39;s loss of Krakoa, their unifying force and homeland, creates a need for a new leader; if Xavier becomes a Dominion he could take them places they never imagined...whether they want to go or not.

## Literature Review

Doctor Doom&#39;s speech about Charles Xavier in X-Men #29 suggests the mutant leader&#39;s time in exile will also be a time of transformation.




Contains spoilers for X-Men #29!!




The X-Men&#39;s most recent encounter with Doctor Doom lends credence to the idea that one of their leader, Professor Charles Xavier, is set to level-up his powers in a way never previously imaginable. Doom refers to Xavier as &#34;The Last Krakoan&#34; – driving home both the idea that the current era of mutantkind is at a close, and that its end will bring about profound change for Charles.



A Dominion is the highest level of intelligence in the Marvel Universe, as established by Jonathan Hickman in 2019&#39;s House of X. A Dominion possess power at the level of a god, along with seemingly immeasurable intelligence, and exist across (and outside) time and space.




X-Men #29 – written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Joshua Cassara, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles – features Xavier&#39;s team heading to Latveria, seeking one of the few remaining pockets of mutants. They&#39;re confronted by Doctor Doom and his Legion of Mutants, resulting in a brief scuffle. Afterward, Doom invites the X-Men back to his palace, engaging in a brief, if pointed, discussion about mutantkind&#39;s future.




          

Doom&#39;s words add further fuel to speculation that the Krakoan era&#39;s conclusion, as it plays out in the upcoming Fall of the House of X and Rise of the Powers of X storylines, will also result in a previously-unimaginable level of power for Professor X.

                  &#34;Doom&#39;s X-Men&#34;: Doctor Doom&#39;s New Costume &amp; Powers Turn Him into the Evil Professor Xavier (With His Own X-Men)   As Doctor Doom assembles his own team of X-Men, he also debuts a new costume that lends him the psychic powers of Professor X.   


 Doom Knew Xavier Wasn&#39;t Ready for Krakoa 


          

During their encounter in X-Men #29, Doom alludes to the fact that Xavier will either be his own end, or come out of the current situation as something entirely different. Although he&#39;s vague with the group, the comment leans into the theory that Charles Xavier is slated to become the God-like Dominion. Earlier in the issue, there&#39;s a flashback glimpse into the moment Xavier, Magneto, and Moira geared up to reveal Krakoa to the world. Doom interrupted Charles in the process, telling him that he was not &#34;that crown&#34; he wore. Though the comment could be interpreted as some of Doom&#39;s usual bravado, the catastrophic failure of Krakoa lends it weight.




As it turned out, Doom&#39;s words were prophetic; Krakoa&#39;s leader was, indeed, not ready. Still, Xavier is now effectively&#34;the Last Krakoan,&#34; as Doom declares him. He left Krakoa at the urging of the piece of Sinister still inside him – the very thing that links him to potentially becoming the next Dominion. It has already been established a Dominion is controlling Orchis, and further, that the Dominion is a Sinister. At the same time, Charles&#39; narrative is pushing him to a point that will either result in his permanent death, or an incredible rebirth. This is the very thing Doom confirms in his conversation with the X-Men in X-Men #29.



Charles&#39; inner monologue in Immortal X-Men #16 – by Kieron Gillen, Lucas Werneck, and David Curiel – also touches upon the idea of becoming stronger after one version of a person dies.






 Xavier&#39;s Ascension Changes Everything 
          




Mutantkind is scattered, and more lives may be lost before the current crisis is over, but they&#39;ve proved more than capable of surviving that and more. They are at their best when they&#39;re united, and with Krakoa gone, they need a new unifying force. To put that power into the hands of the man who led and shaped the trajectory of mutant life for most of his own would have an immeasurable impact on their future. If Doom&#39;s words are taken at their grandest potential, the X-Men will soon see their &#34;Last Krakoan&#34; ascend to god-hood, as Charles Xavier becomes a Dominion.

X-Men #29 is available now from Marvel Comics.
