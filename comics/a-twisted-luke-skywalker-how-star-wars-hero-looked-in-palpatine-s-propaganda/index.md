# A Twisted Luke Skywalker - How Star Wars  Hero Looked In Palpatine s Propaganda


## SUMMARY 



  Order 66 and Palpatine&#39;s propaganda reshaped the public&#39;s perception of the Jedi, turning them into boogeymen.   The Empire imagines Luke Skywalker as an ancient and powerful Jedi knight, drawing on the imagery and history of the High Republic.   This portrayal of Luke reinforces the Empire&#39;s narrative of the Jedi as terrifying figures of control, rather than the underdogs fighting against unjust power.

## Literature Review

Luke Skywalker becomes a terrifying presence as Star Wars reveals how Palpatine&#39;s propaganda transformed how the galaxy imagined Jedi.





Summary

  Order 66 and Palpatine&#39;s propaganda reshaped the public&#39;s perception of the Jedi, turning them into boogeymen.   The Empire imagines Luke Skywalker as an ancient and powerful Jedi knight, drawing on the imagery and history of the High Republic.   This portrayal of Luke reinforces the Empire&#39;s narrative of the Jedi as terrifying figures of control, rather than the underdogs fighting against unjust power.  







While Luke Skywalker would become a hero to the galaxy by defeating Palpatine&#39;s Empire, the Star Wars hero spent much of his Original Trilogy life as little more than a myth. With the Empire having spent decades erasing all memory of the Jedi - and turning them into boogeymen through relentless propaganda - the general image of Luke was far more imposing than the actual Tatooine farmboy fighting to save the galaxy.

In Star Wars: Revelations #1&#39;s &#39;A Trick of the Mind&#39; - from Charles Soule, Andrea Di Vito, Rachelle Rosenberg and Travis Lanham - fans get to see how the Empire&#39;s citizens imagined Luke after years of Palpatine&#39;s influence. In an Imperial trial prosecuting the bounty hunter Dengar for drunken misbehavior, his lawyer Salli Georgio hits on an unexpected tactic. Georgio claims that Dengar was under the influence of the infamous Jedi mind trick, painting a picture of an insidious version of Luke who forced Dengar to go for a reckless joyride.



          




While the tactic is unsuccessful - since the Empire&#39;s legal position is that Jedi no longer exist - it does give fans a look at how Luke Skywalker is imagined in the general Imperial consciousness.



The imagery draws on the Jedi&#39;s appearance during the High Republic - the height of their power.

 Luke Skywalker As Seen Through the Eyes of the Empire 
Order 66 Changed How the Jedi Were Imagined


          

While Palpatine&#39;s Order 66 began with the purging of as many Jedi as possible, it didn&#39;t end there. Palpatine&#39;s edict restructured society, erasing records of the Jedi and banning all study of the Order and even of the Force itself. Branding the Jedi traitors, Palpatine accused them of plotting against the Republic and engineering chaos across the galaxy, sullying their reputation for decades. It was only once Luke defeated Palpatine, helped rebuild the Republic, and founded his own Jedi school that the Jedi got to claw back public opinion.






 Palpatine Demonized the Imagery of the High Republic 
The Empire Imagined Luke Skywalker as an Ancient Jedi Knight


          

However, in this comic set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Luke is still a figure who few have met in person, and even fewer are actually allowed to talk about. While Advocate Georgio paints him as an evil figure, it&#39;s interesting to see that the image draws on the Jedi&#39;s appearance during the High Republic, when they were at the height of their power - an image which would likely have been more firmly imprinted on public consciousness.

While the figure is recognizably Luke - he wields his current yellow lightsaber and has his cybernetic arm - this version feels far more officious and inhuman. Luke is presented as an inherently powerful force rather than an underdog against the Empire, and shows no sign of the central truth of the Rebellion - normal people working to resist the Empire&#39;s unjust power. This serves Advocate Georgio&#39;s narrative of the Jedi as terrifying figures of control, as &#39;Luke&#39; declares, &#34;I will use you... however I please.&#34; It&#39;s particularly fascinating to see that this &#39;evil&#39; version of Luke draws on actual Jedi imagery and history. Of course, it wouldn&#39;t make sense to try and depict Luke as a black-clad, Sith-like villain, since figures like the Inquisitors and Darth Vader were ostensibly heroic pillars of order under the Empire.




While the galaxy would eventually come to know the true Luke Skywalker as a hero in later Star Wars canon, it&#39;s fascinating to see how the Empire painted him as a villain, and how it co-opted the Jedi of the past to do it.
