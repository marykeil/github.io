## Literature Review

OUT is the best example of delinquent trope done right, and it is criminally underrated.




Despite how niche the genre may seem, delinquent manga has long been popular in the community, and one of the best titles available, OUT, is still criminally underrated. There is something intrinsically fun and charming about a main character who refuses to follow the rules of society and lives life how they see fit, and OUT plays with that trope using a compelling and thought-provoking plot.




These types of characters are so popular that they are incorporated into different genres, such as Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventures&#39; Jotaro and YuYu Hakusho&#39;s Yusuke. Their popularity stems from the cultural legacy of the &#34;Bancho&#34;, delinquent school gangs that were widespread in Japan between the 1950s and the 1970s. 

          

No other manga, however, embodies the freedom and rebelliousness of a delinquent more than the cast of OUT. Written by Tatsuya Iguchi and drawn by Mizuta Makoto, the manga has been serialized since 2012, in the Young Champion magazine, a publisher dedicated to seinen manga. Unfortunately, it has not been translated yet in English, which is part of the reasons why this manga is still underrated in the West.

 OUT Deserves More Recognition 
Created by Tatsuya Iguchi &amp; Makoto Mizuta
          

OUT has a unique and interesting plot: Iguchi Tatsuya, the protagonist, has just been released from juvenile detention for his criminal activities in Tokyo. Haunted by a traumatic method of mental torture used on him during his days in jail, Tatsuya vows to stop being a delinquent and moves to the Kanto region, far from Tokyo and his former comrades. He is placed on parole and will be immediately sent back to juvie if he returns to his old ways. Despite having a new job, new home, and new motivations, Tatsuya&#39;s violent tendencies will always be part of him, and it doesn&#39;t take him long to be roped into crime.

OUT perfectly demonstrates the interesting life of delinquents, while not shying away from the negative aspects associated with the lifestyle. The brotherhood formed between people who have been rejected by society and the sense of belonging they receive is a common theme in the series, but the true destruction brought about by delinquency is also highlighted. Tatsuya was a big-shot gang member in Tokyo, and he formed a friendship with Abe Kaname, the vice head of a Kanto gang called Kilihito. With Kaname getting beat up really badly by a rival gang, Iguchi steps in to avenge him and thrusts himself into the midst of Kilihito, although he refuses to join upon an invitation due to his circumstances. Thus, he starts his journey to avoid being sent back to juvenile detention and manage his involvement with the city&#39;s ruthless gangs.






OUT does not have an official English translation yet.




         

From the intense fights, the intricate plot to the interesting characters, it&#39;s the gorgeous art that&#39;s truly the backbone of the story. OUT is one of the manga with the best art, with very realistic landscapes and characters, all while having its own unique and recognizable art style. There are many delinquent series out there, such as Tokyo Revengers, Banana Fish, Beelzebub, and many more. However, OUT stands out in such a saturated genre, solidifying itself as a must-read for any fan of delinquent manga.
