## Literature Review

As X-Men&#39;s 2019-2024 &#39;Krakoan Era&#39; comes to a close, X-Force&#39;s final mission sees them hunt down a founding member with lethal intent.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for X-Force #47!The X-Men have come a long way since Charles Xavier&#39;s first five teen trainees hit the scene, but some of their journeys have been less than heroic. Hank McCoy, aka the Beast, has dabbled with depravity in the past, but the Krakoan Age has seen him plumb the depths of just how despicable Beast can be. X-Force was the apparatus through which McCoy committed atrocities in the name of state security for the fledgling nation of Krakoa, but in the end Beast has become their ultimate target.




In solicitation information for Marvel&#39;s X-Force #48, Marvel confirms the series will wrap up by seeing X-Force&#39;s members - including Wolverine, Colossus, Omega Red and Sage - going after their former leader. The Krakoan Era is ending as Marvel closes the 2019-2024 chapter in the X-Men&#39;s lives, and Beast&#39;s crimes are some of the last threads that need to be tied up.

 X-Force #48                Release Date:  January 24, 2024   Writer:  Benjamin Percy   Artists:  Robert Gill   Cover Artist:  Daniel Acuña   TARGET: BEAST begins here! He was their mission commander. Now he is their mission. At last, X-FORCE takes the fight to HENRY McCOY, A.K.A. BEAST - and he will answer for his crimes!   



The upcoming &#39;Target: Beast&#39; arc will see X-Force through to its issue 50 finale, as the hero-turned-villain contends with being tracked and killed by the lethal heroes he manipulated, betrayed, and tried to kill.





 As Krakoa Falls, Beast is X-Force&#39;s Final Target 
X-Force #48-50 Completes the Story of the Founding X-Man&#39;s Fall from Grace
          

For decades, X-Force has served as a dark counterpoint to the main X-Men teams. In different iterations, X-Force has ranged from a group of militant pro-mutant freedom fighters to a death squad doing work that&#39;s too dirty for the X-Men. In the Krakoan Era, X-Force was adapted into a state security apparatus, and series writer Benjamin Percy specifically cited the CIA as a point of reference. Taking the lead role for this new organization was Beast, given carte blanche access to Krakoa&#39;s vast resources via a willfully ignorant Charles Xavier.

In his epic downward spiral, Director McCoy abused his role to enable his second-in-command&#39;s alcohol abuse, torture Wolverine, commit genocide against another nation, and build his own space station to use as a private Guantánamo Bay. The latitude that Beast was given and the unwillingness of the Krakoan government to apprehend him is perhaps the greatest stain on the legacy of this mutant nation.




Now, Krakoa has fallen, and mutantkind&#39;s era of sovereignty has deteriorated once more into a grim battle for survival. X-Force has attempted to build a remote refuge for mutants in the arctic, but Beast has his eye on the operation. Either X-Force wants to gather the few scattered mutants on Earth in a safe place, or they want to join the final fight against Orchis. However, they cannot effectively do either until they take care of Beast once and for all - especially since they know he has major plans to outlast Orchis and become a threat to Earth as the &#34;God of All Mutants.&#34;



 The FALL OF X Is Beast&#39;s Final Indictment 
The Krakoan Era Can&#39;t End Until Beast&#39;s Crimes Are Punished


          

The majority of Beast&#39;s decisions while leading X-Force are indefensibly evil, but there may have been a gray area of forgiveness granted to him by his fellow mutants if he had actually been effective in protecting Krakoa. The attack on the third Hellfire Gala, the mass exile of mutantkind, and Cyclops on trial as a proxy for the mutant nation are all the worst possible outcomes for someone whose goal was protecting mutantkind. The FALL of X damns McCoy most of all because not only is he despicable, but also objectively a failure. Killing Beast isn&#39;t just about punishing his sins, but a vital chapter as Marvel closes the book on Krakoa. Beast is the final thorn in X-Force&#39;s side, and now they&#39;re on a mission to eliminate this founding member of the X-Men for the betterment of all mutants.




X-Force #48 will be available from Marvel Comics starting January 24, 2024.
