## Literature Review

Sukuna has been trapped within Yuji for most of Jujutsu Kaisen, but the manga shows how scary he can be when in a different form.




As it entered what appeared to be its endgame, Jujutsu Kaisen revealed a new form for Sukuna, which is utterly terrifying. While the manga has had various major antagonists including the body-hopping sorcerer Kenjaku, Sukuna has always been presented as the ultimate villain of the story. And now mangaka Gege Akutami is demonstrating the reason for this.




In chapter 212, Sukuna took control of Itadori’s body in order to transfer himself into Megumi’s body. But chapter 213 reveals the horrific ramifications of this transfer. Since Megumi’s spirit was broken by seeing his sister possessed by another ancient sorcerer, Sukuna has complete control over him, unlike with Itadori. In addition, since Megumi has a cursed technique, Sukuna can use this technique for himself in Jujutsu Kaisen, which he does by summoning a giant version of Nue.

          

While all of this represents a terrifying powerup for Sukuna, the most horrifying aspect of his new vessel is revealed at the end of the chapter. After Hana tries to purge him from Megumi’s body, he pretends that her ploy has worked only to get close to her and transform his head into a giant mouth to attempt to eat her. This panel is one of the scariest panels in the entire series and shows the full potential of Sukuna’s new form.





 Sukuna&#39;s New Form Proves He is Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Scariest Villain 
          

When trapped in Itadori’s body, Sukuna was still extremely powerful, but his actions were limited. He couldn’t take control of Yuji at will, and even the binding vow Sukuna made that enabled him to control Yuji’s body in Jujutsu Kaisen came with restrictions. However, whenever he did take full control, he showed why he is considered one of the most powerful characters in the series. When he took control of Yuji in the Shibuya Incident arc, he was destroyed other powerful curses like Jogo with ease and even defeated Megumi’s ultimate summon, the Mahoraga.

Given Sukuna was already this powerful when imprisoned in Yuji, now that he is even stronger, he may be the most powerful enemy in the series. If he can transform his entire body like he did in the last panel, then he could also have powers like Mahito, one of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s best villains. On top of this, in Megumi&#39;s body he also can use the Ten Shadows Cursed Technique. Despite this, perhaps the most terrifying implication of his new body is that to defeat him, Yuji and his allies will likely have to kill Megumi.






 Sukuna Possessing Megumi Bodes Poorly for Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Heroes 
          

In recent chapters, Sukuna has been forced to adopt his original form from the Heian era, leaving the state of Megumi&#39;s body unclear. The king of curses could just be letting Megumi&#39;s Ten Shadows technique lie dormant to recharge it for later in the fight. If he could bring back Mahoraga to fight the sorcerers now battling him, it would make things much harder for Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s protagonists. However, Megumi&#39;s body and soul could also be potentially destroyed forever, consumed by this new form.

Jujutsu Kaisen is no stranger to killing some of its most popular characters, so Megumi’s potential death is a very strong possibility. But in order to defeat Sukuna’s new, more powerful form and prevent him from enacting his evil plans, it is a worthy sacrifice. No matter how the heroes defeat Sukuna, his new form is a sign that the manga’s end game will likely be the most brutal and wildest arc of Jujutsu Kaisen so far.
