## Literature Review

One Piece has just revealed the existence of a new, unknown former member of the Seven Warlords who may end up playing a major role in the series.




Warning: Contains spoilers for chapter #1100 of One Piece. One Piece has just teased that there may still be another mysterious former member of the Seven Warlords that the series has yet to reveal. Despite the focus shifting onto the Emperors since the Straw Hats&#39; entry into the New World, this mysterious Warlord may end up playing a crucial role in the finale of the series and the race towards Laugh Tale.




Chapter #1100 of One Piece reveals that Kuma was offered a position among the Seven Warlords due to Ace defeating one of them a few days prior to Kuma and Bonney&#39;s arrival at Egghead in the flashback. Kuma goes on to join the Warlords approximately six months later as the seventh member, which is evident from the reactions of the other six featured in the chapter.

          

While the chapter doesn&#39;t leave any clues as to who the former Warlord that Ace defeated could be, it may be possible to narrow down the list of candidates based on the timeline of the flashback and all that the series has divulged regarding Ace&#39;s adventures.

                  One Piece&#39;s Warlords Of The Sea Share A Hidden Clue That Explains Their Role   One Piece&#39;s original Seven Warlords all share one subtle but important connection, which implies their relationship with the World Government.   





 The Man Marked by Flames May Be the Warlord Ace Defeated 
This character was first mentioned by Eustass Kid in chapter #1056.
          

The identity of the mysterious &#34;man marked by flames&#34;, or &#34;man with a burn scar&#34; in Viz&#39;s official translation, has perplexed readers since the first mention of his existence during the closing chapters of the Wano Arc. While fans have speculated that the man marked by flames could be Saul, or even Luffy&#39;s father Dragon, chapter #1100 brings in the possibility of him being the unnamed Warlord Ace defeated. Moreover, considering the very fiery nature of Ace&#39;s devil fruit, it would be all too fitting that the man marked by flames&#39; scars originated from his battle against Ace.

The events of the flashback take place approximately four years ago, which is when Vegapunk is said to have switched labs. Hence, Ace&#39;s battle against the mysterious Warlord likely took place in the New World as Ace would have been around Wano four years ago, based on Yamato&#39;s encounter with him. Hence, it would make sense for Eutass Kid to go looking for the man marked by flames following Wano in the New World, rather than the Grand Line, where a majority of the Warlords seem to be based.




                  Every One Piece Theory About The Man Marked By Flames Explained   One Piece&#39;s most mysterious character, the &#39;Man Marked By Flames&#39; has caused a lot of theories since his introduction. These are the most compelling.   

Overall, while the man marked by flames and the former warlord hinted at in the latest chapter have but the faintest connection, there does not seem to be any other apparent reason for Oda to disclose this information this late into the story, when the Seven Warlords have long become irrelevant, especially after the World Government disbanded the organization and branded its members as criminals again.

It must be a pleasant surprise for fans to see Ace posthumously play a role, albeit minor, in the story. Luffy&#39;s brother was one of the most popular characters in the series, and his death remains the most tragic moment in One Piece. While the introduction of yet another mystery may be frustrating at this point, One Piece is infamous for its subtle foreshadowing, so it is likely only a matter of time until the series reveals the true identity of the mysterious Warlord defeated by Ace and the role they will play in the Final Saga of One Piece.
