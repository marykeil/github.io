Warning! MAJOR spoilers for Invincible ahead!The story of Invincible is one that’s filled with superhero action, moments of character development, and a disturbing amount of violence. Mark Grayson and his fellow superheroes survive an unbelievable amount of punishment over the course of Invincible&#39;s 144 issues, some even bringing them to death&#39;s door.

 10  Invincible Shattering His Arm

Invincible nearly lost his life after he was infected by the Scourge Virus, the plague that wiped out much of the Viltrum Empire. He survived, but not without consequences. Mark’s powers were completely gone in the immediate aftermath of his recovery. They did, however, slowly come back, though not at the same time. Mark got his enhanced strength back before his enhanced durability, leading to Mark nearly destroying his arm when he punches Allen during an intense confrontation between Allen, Dinosaurus, and Oliver. Thankfully, with 11 surgeries, Mark’s arm is fixed so it can heal properly.





 9  Bulletproof Surviving an Explosion

When Robot decided to take over the world in a mad plan to keep it safe, he didn’t make a lot of friends. However, Bulletproof was on board with Robot’s decision and actually helped him round up and detain heroes who were a threat to Robot’s order. But Bulletproof didn’t expect the Immortal to smuggle in a bomb, which he activated right next to Bulletproof. The hero is left heavily scarred and in serious pain but turned down the opportunity to fix it when Robot offers, saying his new appearance matches who he is inside.





 8  Donald Being Decapitated

Robot’s decision to take over the world was swift and he hit several major players and locations hard. Not only did he attack his allies, he also turned on the Pentagon. Cecil Stedman’s assistant Donald Ferguson tried to hold things down with D.A. Sinclair’s Re-Animen, but Robot’s drones were built with explosives from Dinosaurus’ bombs that annihilated Las Vegas. Robot triggers it and levels the Pentagon killing everyone in the building, except for the cyborg Donald, whose head manages to escape the fray. Donald doesn’t get a lot of credit, but he’s one of the few people to survive an encounter with Robot.





 7  Allen Being Blown Up

Allen the Alien might not be a Viltrumite, but he was bred to be one of the most resilient beings in the universe. Not only has he survived several head-on assaults from several Viltrumites, but he managed to live through a bomb that leveled an entire building. Allen’s authority on the Coalition of Planets’ High Council was challenged by Elia, a member who thought Allen wasn’t fit for the job. She sacrificed her life to kill him, but all she managed to do was temporarily impair Allen. Thanks to his unbelievable healing factor, he was back on the job in mere days.





 6  Levy Angstrom Nearly Being Murdered by Invincible

Few people made Invincible as mad as his most personal enemy, Angstrom Levy. During Levy’s first act of revenge on Mark, he threatened the life of Mark’s mother and half-brother. Levy and Mark start a fight that ends with them in a wasteland dimension. Furious at Levy for threatening his family, Mark viciously beats Angstrom to a pulp. Mark left, presuming he’d killed his enemy. But Angstrom clung to life and escaped to another dimension to heal. Though he lived, Levy was left disfigured, deepening his hatred for Mark Grayson.





 5  Robot Tearing Atom Eve’s Leg Off

Robot hurt a lot of his allies when he kicked off his plans for worldwide control, Eve suffered one of the most visceral injuries. Robot attacked Atom Eve and Invincible in their home using his latest upgraded armor. The two were also at a major disadvantage due to Eve’s pregnancy, which prevented her from using her powers. Robot traps Eve’s leg in a shackle to prevent her from escaping and after only a few moments, he yanks it with enough force to rip her leg off completely. Eve regained her leg thanks to her powers, but it was still an incredibly horrifying experience for her.





 4  Thragg Punching Oliver’s Jaw Off 
Invincible #75, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley
        

Oliver, Invincible’s half-brother, always wanted to lend a hand to his older sibling. But the poor boy was woefully outmatched when he went face-to-face with the leader of the Viltrumite Empire, Thragg. Oliver fought Thragg alongside his father, brother, and the Coalition of Planets’ Thaddeus. After Thragg effortlessly knocks Invincible out of the way, Oliver steps in, only for Thragg to dismember him and punch Oliver’s jaw almost all the way off. Oliver received prompt medical attention and his jaw was replaced by a cybernetic substitute. But the injury showed that even kids weren’t safe from devastating injuries in Invincible.





 3  Conquest Disemboweling Invincible

Out of all the Viltrumites Mark fought through Invincible, one of the most terrifying and lethal is the warrior known as Conquest. Invincible fought Conquest twice and both times were absolutely blood-soaked. The second time Mark fought Conquest was in space, and the evil Viltrumite was insistent on making sure he put down Mark for good. Conquest and Mark fought all across a planet’s surface, where the Viltrumite warrior managed to disembowel Mark. Invincible pushed through the pain and made sure to end his enemy’s life, but it took Mark a considerable amount of time to recover from that injury.





 2  Invincible and Atom Eve&#39;s Near Murder 
Invincible #132, Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker
        

After Thragg was exiled from the Viltrum Empire, he sired a legion of Viltrumite/Thraxan offspring to help wage war against his foes. Thragg, along with two of his most devoted children, tracked Mark, Eve, and their daughter Terra down and violently attacked them. Oliver gave his life to protect Mark and his family, but it was in vain as Thragg’s daughter punched Eve’s face in while Thragg ripped Invincible in half. The two were left to die and very well would have had Eve’s powers not kicked in and fully restored her and Invincible to full health.





 1  Invincible’s Fight on the Sun 
Invincible #140, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley


 







Out of all the fights in Invincible, Mark’s final battle with Thragg was its most brutal. Mark leads his battle with Thragg away from everyone and fights him one-on-one on the surface of the Sun. While Thragg and Mark’s enhanced durability protects them for a bit, the extreme heat begins to burn both of them. But with melted flesh and exposed musculature, Mark keeps it up until his nemesis burns to a crisp. While Mark&#39;s charred body has to be rescued by Allen, Invincible&#39;s healing ability brings him back to normal over time.
There are a lot of horrific injuries throughout Invincible, but these stand out as some of the series&#39; most disturbing.
