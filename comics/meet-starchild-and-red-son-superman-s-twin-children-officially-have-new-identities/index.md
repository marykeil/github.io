Summary

  Superman&#39;s twin children, known as the Super-Twins, now have their own superhero identities as Starchild and Red Son.   The twins&#39; new names come from their own family&#39;s mythos, the House of Ra, allowing them to have identities independent of Superman.   The future of Starchild and Red Son is bright, with their first major steps to becoming true heroes and the potential for their own superhero costumes.  







Superman&#39;s newest two children, known until now as &#34;the Super-Twins,&#34; have finally gotten individual identities of their own: Starchild and Red Son. Getting out of the shadow of a mentor can be difficult for superheroes and sidekicks, especially when that shadow is from someone as large as Superman, but these twins from Warworld have earned their own spotlights.

After Norah Stone of &#34;Earth al Ghul&#34; kidnaps Otho-Ra, she intends to eventually steal the young Phaelosian&#39;s body, as explored in Action Comics Annual 2023 #1 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Max Raynor, Matt Herms, and Dave Sharpe. But Superman snaps his daughter out of her violent trance by reminding Otho-Ra of the story of the House of Ra. This story involves the great hero Starchild, who uses her shield to protect the people close to her — including her brother &#34;Red Son.&#34;

          




This story manages to snap Otho out of it, and she realizes what&#39;s happening. Later in the story, in a moment of bravery, Superman&#39;s son and Otho&#39;s brother Osul-Ra embodies the spirit of the other hero in the House of Ra, the Red Son. Now Superman&#39;s twin children have perfect new heroic identities.

                  Superman&#39;s Family Gets Major DC Change With New Children   The Superman-Family is growing by two on the pages of DC Comics, as Kal-El and Lois Lane reveal they&#39;ve adopted a pair of children as their own.   


 Superman&#39;s Twins Starchild and Red Son Earn New Hero Names 
          

Every hero who branches out from their mentor eventually needs to make a name of their own. Former Robins like Jason Todd and Dick Grayson, for example, are now better known as Red Hood and Nightwing since they broke away from Batman and created identities of their own. Nightwing even borrowed his name from Superman&#39;s family. Now Otho and Osul&#39;s hero names come from their own family, the House of Ra. This gives them identities completely unique to themselves and not spun-off from Superman&#39;s personal history — an especially important nuance given the twins&#39; history as Phaelosians, a lost race of Kryptonian who were enslaved on Warworld before Superman&#39;s rescue.




Iit&#39;s easy for Superman to overshadow anyone who works with him, especially when they tend to go by derivative names like &#34;Superboy&#34; or &#34;Supergirl.&#34; But DC seems to be avoiding this problem by allowing Osul-Ra and Otho-Ra their very own identities that pull from their own mythos instead of Superman&#39;s. According to a recent Action Comics story, every Kryptonian family had an important house fable. For the House of El, it was the story of Nightwing and Flamebird. It seems Phaelosians are no different, and the House of Ra has the house fable of Starchild and the Red Son, from which the Super-Twins pull their new names.



 What&#39;s Next for Superman&#39;s Twins Starchild and Red Son? 


          

The future of Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra is still unclear, especially considering both their youth and the beginning of a new run by a new creative team on the Action Comics title. But they&#39;ve finally taken their first major steps to becoming true heroes. Not only do they help to hold off a hostile invasion, but they gain unique identities while doing so. It&#39;s unlikely that Osul-Ra and Otho-Ra are going anywhere anytime soon, especially if Superman has any say in it, which leaves the future for the two open and bright. While it might be a long while before they get their own superhero costumes without the famous S-shield, they&#39;ve still taken a major first step by becoming Starchild and Red Son.
