## Literature Review

As the heroes of the DC Universe transform into animal versions of themselves thanks to Beast World, their truest base instincts are revealed.





Summary

  Red Hood&#39;s new beast form reveals his innate killer instincts.   The infected characters in the story are reduced to their base instincts, making Red Hood a ruthless predator.   Red Hood&#39;s moral complexity is showcased through his struggle with his primal desires and his inability to give up killing.  







Red Hood&#39;s moral complexity has been a staple of his character since his return from the dead as the killer villain he once was. Over the years, Red Hood has tried to move on from his lethal ways, but his new beast form shows that he may never truly be able to give up killing.

Red Hood&#39;s innate killer instinct is proven in the Titans: Beast World Tour - Gotham #1 story &#34;Scavengers&#34; by Gretchen Felker-Martin, Ivan Shavrin, and Lucas Gattoni. In this story, Gotham has been inundated by Beast Boy&#39;s beast spores, which transform anyone they infect into animal-like monsters. Red Hood — much like Batman — has been transformed into a wolf, and he immediately begins targeting those he sees as criminals.

          

It appears that the infected characters are reduced to their base instincts while under the effects. While characters like Batman want to protect Gotham even in their beast form, Red Hood begins hunting down and murdering criminals. No matter how much Jason tries to give up his lethal ways, his base instincts prove that he will always be a killer deep down.




                  Red Hood Trusts 1 Hero to Help Him Kill Joker (&amp; They&#39;re Not in the Bat-Family)   Red Hood hasn&#39;t always been on the best of terms with the Bat-Family, which is why it&#39;s not too surprising he has another hero he trusts to help him.   


 Red Hood&#39;s Beast World Form Confirms He Will Always Be a Killer 
          

Out of all the Bat-Family members, Jason Todd had one of the most difficult childhoods — and so one of the most nuanced views of the world. Jason&#39;s mother experienced addiction, and his father was sent to prison. He was left homeless and forced to survive on his own. Despite this, he was a bright and cheerful kid when he was adopted by Bruce Wayne. Jason had a hard life but still managed to be hopeful and believed that being Robin made him magic. When Jason Todd was killed by the Joker, he came back to life as the brutal vigilante Red Hood. The bright, cheerful kid was gone, and Jason sought to deal out lethal justice. His newly revealed primal desires imply that this might never change.




The characters in Beast World who transform into beasts seem driven by their most basic primal instincts. When Batman transforms into a wolf, he is solely focused on protecting humans and protecting his &#34;master,&#34; Gotham, as seen in another story from this one-shot. When Jason transforms, he prowls the streets of Gotham, brutally mauling a criminal to death and musing over whether the deaths he&#39;s caused actually matter or are even justified. Despite wondering about this, he still doesn&#39;t seem to stop killing. Throughout the story, he kills a criminal, almost kills a cop, and may have killed a transformed Ratcatcher. Jason&#39;s primal desires seem to still be to hunt down those he views as criminals.



 Red Hood Targets Criminals - Does That Make Him a Villain? 
          

Red Hood is one of the more morally complex characters in the Bat-Family. He believes that crime should be stopped, — but that simply locking criminals up isn&#39;t always the best solution. Because of this, he&#39;s used plenty of lethal force over the years, and while he&#39;s tried to give it up in the past, his primal desires imply that he&#39;ll never be able to do so. This is perfectly backed up by how Jason has recently returned to using lethal force, as he hunted down and tried to kill the Joker. No matter what Jason Todd says, Red Hood will always return to being a killer, whether he likes it or not.
