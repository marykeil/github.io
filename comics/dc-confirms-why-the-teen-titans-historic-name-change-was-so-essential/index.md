## Literature Review

While the Titans deal with gross transformations, intergalactic issues, and adult drama, the original Teen Titans are busy acting like kids.





Summary

  The Teen Titans are still struggling to work as a team, and their immaturity gets in the way of their success.   A rejected Teen Titan, Haywire, takes advantage of the team&#39;s internal conflicts and takes them down.   The Titans: Beast World event will showcase the growth of the Titans as they take on Justice League-level threats.  







DC&#39;s iconic team the Teen Titans have been around for decades, but their name change to the Titans marked their true growth as heroes. A new story focusing on their early years as a team reveals just why that change was so essential. Despite impressive abilities and superpowers, the original iteration of this team is just a bunch of kids.

Many times, Batman has voiced disapproval of how the Teen Titans tries to handle things on their own, and World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5 by Mark Waid and Emanuela Lupacchino proves him right. While the Justice League is occasionally less than super friends, they succeed when they put their differences aside and fight as a team. The Teen Titans haven&#39;t quite learned that lesson yet, and their chaos gets in the way

          




Wonder Girl is excited to be off of Themyscira, but Aqualad doesn&#39;t feel comfortable on solid land, all while their romance falls apart. Bumblebee doesn&#39;t have an adult mentor guiding her, while Speedy desperately wants attention from Green Arrow. Robin is torn between wanting to lead a team and not disobeying Batman. And Kid Flash just wants everyone to be friends. They will only earn the name &#34;Titans&#34; when they grow out of this childish phase.

                  The Titans&#39; Unexpected New Member Gives the Team a Huge Power Boost   Despite already having an all-star line-up of heroes, the Titans just added a strong new member who will dramatically raise the team&#39;s power level.   


 DC&#39;s Iconic Team Puts the &#34;Teen&#34; in Teen Titans 
The childish team is not acting like the &#34;world&#39;s finest&#34;
          

When a rejected Teen Titan, Haywire, goes after the team with his own squad, the Terror Titans, he knows all the right buttons to push. Half of Haywire&#39;s work has already been done for him, as the main group is coming apart at the seams. There&#39;s been friction since the first issue, seeing as the teens all know each other&#39;s identities — except for Robin&#39;s. They turn that lack of trust against him. Speedy is still hurt from Aqualad&#39;s comments at Wally&#39;s house, and so Roy is trying to prove himself more than usual. Donna is mad that Garth won&#39;t open up to her, and she chooses to ignore anything he says, even in the middle of an intense battle — and that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.




Haywire turns one of the Teen Titans&#39; favorite tools against them, taking down the team while bystanders film it for social media. He leaves them broken in the street, stating his mission this time was humiliation. That said, when the Titans don&#39;t have &#34;Teen&#34; in the title, the comic is free to tell more adult stories featuring superheroes who are still young, but at least have their drivers&#39; licenses. While the Titans still have their disagreements, they&#39;re far less childish when expressing themselves. They have years of experience beyond their mentors&#39; shadows and know how to operate as individual superheroes and as a team.



 DC&#39;s Titans Series Loses the Teen 
The Titans have finally grown up enough to lead the DCU
          

In the Titans: Beast World event, the Titans will even be taking on threats that are usually Justice League-level. That the same characters can be experienced by readers across their entire career is one of the DCU&#39;s greatest strengths. That&#39;s why both Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns are beloved books — because it&#39;s exciting to read about a young Batman figuring things out as well as an old Batman at the end of his life. Both Titans and World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans show off these interesting young heroes, with the &#34;Teen&#34; letting readers know how childish they can expect the Teen Titans team to be.






World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5 is available now from DC Comics.
