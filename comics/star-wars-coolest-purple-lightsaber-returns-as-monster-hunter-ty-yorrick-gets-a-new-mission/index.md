## Literature Review

Star Wars&#39; monster hunter, Ty Yorrick, will return in a new series this Spring from Dark Horse Comics. The series continues High Republic era stories.




Ty Yorrick, a purple lightsaber wielder in the Star Wars universe, is set to return in a new comic series in 2024. The monster hunter from the High Republic era has been seen before, notably in a four-issue series back in 2021. Now, the former Jedi padawan turned mercenary will have a thrilling adventure ahead of her.




Tylera &#34;Ty&#34; Yorrick made her debut in the Star Wars novel, The High Republic: The Rising Storm by Cavan Scott. She would later go on to star prominently in The High Republic Adventures - The Monster of Temple Peak. She also made an appearance in The High Republic Adventures - The Nameless Terror, from early 2023.

          

Having left the order as a padawan, Ty has paved her own way as a mercenary, hunting monsters throughout the galaxy. StarWars.com has announced that she will be the star of Star Wars: The High Republic - Saber for Hire, a four-issue miniseries that will be published by Dark Horse Comics. It has the creative team of Cavan Scott and Rachael Stott.

                  Star Wars Delivers A Shocking Jedi Death To Launch High Republic&#39;s New Era   Star Wars and Dark Horse have taken Free Comic Book Day by storm, featuring a shocking Jedi death to kick off Phase 3 of The High Republic era.   





 Ty Yorrick Returns with Her New Apprentice 
          

Ty Yorrick&#39;s apprentice, Drewen, is a Segredo, who first appeared in The High Republic - The Monster of Temple Peak. Drewen greatly admires Yorrick&#39;s abilities and followed her after her departure from Blarrum. Segredo can turn invisible, with the potential to be very useful allies. Yorrick allowed Drewen to accompany her as her &#39;Padawan&#39; following the conclusion of The Nameless Terror, so his potential has not yet been realized. This could be changing very soon, with him set to play a more prominent role in this upcoming miniseries.


Written by Cavan Scott with art by Rachael Stott, Saber for Hire finds Ty facing new challenges behind the Nihil Stormwall. Though she&#39;s busy and earning credits, life is getting complicated; Ty has taken on an apprentice, and a storm is brewing that will see her clashing with old enemies, as well as friends.







 Former Jedi Ty Yorrick Will Be Integral to Current High Republic Conflicts 
          

Series writer, Cavan Scott says:


I am really excited to be teaming up with Rachael Stott once again for more Ty Yorrick adventures. Saber for Hire takes place in The High Republic&#39;s dramatic third phase when the anarchic Nihil have annexed a vast area of Republic space. Former Jedi-turned-monster-hunter Ty and her apprentice Drewen are trapped behind enemy lines and having the time of their lives hunting beasts and making a small fortune. Well, Ty is having the time of her life. Drewen is feeling sidelined and wants more from their partnership. As Ty faces a nightmare from her past, Drewen steps out on his own. What could go wrong, right?


According to Michael Siglain, the creative director of Lucasfilm Publishing, Ty will be &#34;the key to the larger battle between the marauding Nihil and the monstrous Nameless - she just doesn&#39;t know it yet.&#34;




The Nameless have been posed as the Jedi&#39;s most dangerous threat yet, as they isolate Force-sensitive organisms from the Force and devour fear. Many Jedi have fallen to this species&#39; threat, and it has been one of their most mysterious foes to date. Given its ferocity and being the epitome of a monster to the Jedi, it would make sense for a monster hunter like Ty Yorrick to be integral in bringing its demise. However, she will have her hands full with the Nihil, as well as with the partner drama presented by her new apprentice&#39;s desire to do more.

Star Wars: The High Republic - Saber for Hire #1 will be available April 10 from Dark Horse Comics.
