## Literature Review

The X-Men have a habit of turning foe to friend, but their fight against Orchis has pushed them into their strangest recruiting drive ever.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for X-Men #9 and Dark X-Men #5More so than maybe any other Marvel Comics team, the X-Men are well-known for their tendency to turn enemies into allies. From fan-favorite members like Rogue to arch-foes like Magneto, the Merry Mutants have swelled their roster with countless formerly-evil-mutants over the years. And with the Fall of X coming to a dramatic climax, it seems the X-Men are in the midst of their biggest recruitment drive ever.




Dark X-Men #5 by Steve Foxe, Jonas Scharf, Frank Martin, and Clayton Cowles finds the appropriately named assemblage of troubled mutants disbanding following Madelyne Pryor’s confrontation with an alternate universe variant of her Goblin Queen persona. Among these mutants is the fan-favortie Gambit, who returns to his wife Rogue and the other remaining X-Men in the abandoned Morlock tunnels.

          

When asked where Pryor’s allegiances lie, Remy says, “Can’t believe I’m sayin’ dis…but the day we need to call in the cavalry? I think she’ll be dere for us wit’ Hell’s bells on.” And although the Goblin Queen might not be the most traditional X-Men ally that fans would expect the mutants to call upon, she’s far from the most unorthodox alliance they’ve recently made.




                  This Enduring Non-Mutant X-Men Character Could Be a Pivotal Ally In the Fall of X (Or the Team&#39;s Final Undoing)   One forgotten X-Men ally-turned-enemy-turned-hero could prove to be pivotal to saving the team from Orchis – or could author their final destruction.   


 The X-Men Are Bringing Together Their Strangest Army 
          

X-Men #29 by Gerry Duggan, Joshua Cassara, Marte Gracia, and Clayton Cowles features the team making a tentative peace with some mutants under the thrall of Doctor Doom himself, confirming the might of Latveria will join the fight against the forces of Orchis when the time comes. Normally, this isn’t the sort of partnership that the X-Men would be able to forge as Doctor Doom plays by his own rules. Likewise, Maddie Pryor hasn’t always been on the best terms with her X-tended family, so the fact that what remains of the Uncanny X-Men can now count on the aid of two of the Marvel Universe’s major – and arguably villainous – players says a lot about just how desperate they are to take down Orchis.




Major threats like the Sentinels, Apocalypse, and even Onslaught have forced the X-Men to unite with some of their most dangerous foes before, but never quite to this scale. Considering the forces of Limbo and Latveria against Orchis, in addition to the more traditionally heroic X-Men allies like Captain America, Iron Man, and the rest of the Uncanny Avengers, and the X-Men are building their strangest roster ever – a veritable army of mutants, heroes, and villains ready to strike at Orchis when they least expect it. And with the sham trial of Cyclops soon approaching, it’s clear that the Merry Mutants feel they have nothing left to lose in their battle for survival.



 The X-Men Can’t Afford To Turn Away Help 
          

Thanks to their shared struggle of survival, the X-Men are no strangers to mending fences with their greatest opponents like Magneto or Apocalypse. But considering their history with Doctor Doom and the Goblin Queen, their current fight against extinction has the House of Ideas’ iconic mutant team backed into a corner with their strangest bedfellows ever. If Marvel Comics’ X-Men have any hope of withstanding the Fall of X, it’s clear that they need all the help they can get – and they obviously know it.






Dark X-Men #5 and X-Men #29 are on sale now from Marvel Comics.
