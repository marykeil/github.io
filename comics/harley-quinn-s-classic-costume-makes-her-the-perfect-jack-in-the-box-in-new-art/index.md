The iconic outfit, which was ditched when Harley split with the Joker, still captures her wild and unpredictable essence.

## Literature Review

She may have switched up her look, but Harley Quinn’s classic harlequin outfit makes a comeback in an impressive variant cover by Elizabeth Torque.




It may have fallen out of favor, but Harley Quinn&#39;s classic costume returns in a delightful new cover. Since Harley ditched the Joker, she&#39;s had a variety of new looks that have helped her define her identity. But as one variant cover shows, the original costume still has something going for it.




2024 is officially here and DC fans already have a peek at what&#39;s ahead thanks to the newest batch of solicitations. In Harley Quinn&#39;s corner of the DC Universe, things seem to be getting back to normal after her recent multiversal escapades have finally settled with Harley Quinn #38. The issue comes with a variant cover by Elizabeth Torque, that sees Harley performing at a circus. After her clown assistants crank it enough, Harley springs out of a jack-in-the-box dressed in Harley Quinn&#39;s classic jester costume. She has an unsettling smile on her face as she wields her trusty oversized mallet, potentially ready to use it on the viewer.

 Harley Quinn&#39;s Classic Outfit Returns (And Still Looks Good) 
          

When Harley Quinn first hit the comic book scene, she wore the outfit that many fans still see as her defining look: A black and red jester costume, playing up the &#39;harlequin&#39; of her criminal name. It was a costume she stuck with for years, at least until she officially split with the Joker. To go along with her independence, she ditched the jester suit and traded it in for a variety of costumes. From a derby girl getup to more streamlined looks, Harley has kept what works (namely the color scheme) and gotten rid of everything else. While her old costume occasionally reappears, it&#39;s pretty much been retired.

While there&#39;s no doubt that Harley Quinn is in a much better place now than she was when she was working with the Joker, it&#39;s a shame that her outfit isn&#39;t seen as much these days. It&#39;s a timeless look that goes along with Harley&#39;s name and shows off her playful and chaotic spirit. As Torque&#39;s variant shows, Harley can wear the costume and still be seen as independent as the Joker is nowhere in sight. Harley still pulls off the look extremely well and the cover demonstrates that a return could very much work for her.






 Harley Quinn Should Bring Back Her Classic Look 
          

Lots of DC icons switch up their appearance, but none more than Harley Quinn. While different appearances work for someone as impulsive as Harley, there&#39;s something to be said for her classic outfit. It&#39;s a look that has stayed popular years after she officially took it out of her rotation and it&#39;s one that captures her wild and unpredictable spirit. She doesn&#39;t need to make it her permanent look as Harley&#39;s a character that does well when she has a lot of options. But as this cover shows, Harley Quinn&#39;s classic outfit is just too good to keep it hidden away.

Harley Quinn #38 is available from DC Comics on March 26th.
