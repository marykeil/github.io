## Literature Review

The Titans have an incredible line-up of capable, powerful members, yet one among their ranks has the ability to throw whole planets out of alignment.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Titans: Beast World #1!!




DC&#39;s Titans&#39; roster is packed with powerhouses and expert fighters – but as the world prepares to face down the Necrostar, one member reveals that Cyborg could be a much bigger threat than anyone imagined. As he helps Beast Boy save the planet, he reveals that his boom tubes are capable of causing catastrophic, global damage, making everyone incredibly lucky that he focuses his efforts on being a hero instead.

Titans: Beast World #1 – by Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, and Brad Anderson – throws the DC Universe into tumult once more, as Brother Eternity successfully frees the Necrostar from its prison, unleashing a threat so devastating that even the ultra-powerful Tamaraneans couldn&#39;t contain it on their own. The issue finds Beast Boy and Cyborg teaming up to try and contain the dreaded Necrostar before it wipes out Earth.

          




In the process, Cyborg reveals the tremendous, bone-chilling extent of his power: that size tear can destroy planets in a matter of moments by pulling them out of alignment.

                  Cyborg Admits His Justice League Membership was a Mistake   Cyborg was a member of the Justice League at the dawn of the New 52, but now he admits it was a mistake and the Teen Titans are a better fit.   


 Cyborg Ranks Among The Most Powerful Titans 
Victor&#39;s Boom Tubes Make Him A Global Threat
          

In Titans: Beast World #1, upon realizing the imminent danger of the Necrostar, Beast Boy hatches a plan to turn into Starro, perhaps the only being the Necrostar fears, and enlists Cyborg&#39;s help to execute his scheme. Vic&#39;s job is to open up a giant boom tube to transport the Necrostar to another galaxy. Although he has returned to the Titans, Cyborg has previously been a full-fledged member of the Justice League, and is a well-respected hero. The advanced technology lacing through his body grants him incredible abilities. Creating &#34;boom tubes&#34; is only one unique aspect of his powers – but perhaps could be the most dangerous.




Cyborg&#39;s boom tubes serve as dimensional portals, and are usually used to create travel points. In the case of the Necrostar, it&#39;s meant to be a way to effectively banish the creature to another galaxy. However, Cyborg&#39;s comments in Beast World #1 makes it obvious that boom tubes can be far more dangerous than fans might have previously realized. Opening the portal, he says that they have only a few seconds before it causes so much damage that multiple planets are affected. There are very few beings capable of generating the kind of power it would take to cause mass destruction in mere seconds, but Cyborg can do so easily.



 Cyborg Remains One Of DC&#39;s Best Heroes 
The DCU Should Be Thankful Victor&#39;s Not A Villain
          

Fortunately for everyone else inhabiting the DC Universe, Vic is incredibly motivated to stay both good and human. One of Cyborg&#39;s greatest fears is losing his humanity to the technology that makes up so much of his body, and to combat this, he consistently aligns himself with friends and teammates who have the world&#39;s best interest at heart. Regardless of how powerful he is, the decisions he makes keep him from being a threat. That&#39;s the same predicament that others, like Superman, often find themselves in. Cyborg possesses devastating levels of power, but his choices continue to keep him on the side of heroes, as one of DC&#39;s most powerful Titans.
