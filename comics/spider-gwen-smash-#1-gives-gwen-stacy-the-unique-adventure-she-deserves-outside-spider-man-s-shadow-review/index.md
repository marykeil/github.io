## Literature Review

Spider-Gwen: Smash spins a web that only Gwen Stacy can handle: her band is on tour with Dazzler, but a secret supervillain is a harsh music critic.




Warning! Spoilers for Spider-Gwen: Smash #1 ahead!Gwen Stacy&#39;s Spider-Gwen is headlining her own Marvel limited series that places her front and center in her own universe, and not as a sidekick to Peter or Miles. In Spider-Gwen: Smash #1, from the creative team of Melissa Flores, Enid Balám, Fer Sifuentes-Sujo, and Elisabetta D&#39;amico, Gwen has had her share of multiverse experiences, but she&#39;s sticking to her own world for now. Earth-65 has plenty of problems for Ghost Spider to solve.




Spider-Gwen: Smash features many faces that are familiar to both longtime webheads and newer MCU fans, and uses them to build out Stacy&#39;s New York. Her band, the Mary Janes, is getting a big shot at stardom, provided Gwen can stay at the drum kit instead of swinging into action. They&#39;ll be opening a short U.S. tour for Dazzler and the Uncut Gems, who have an ulterior motive for recruiting this band in particular.



          

Mutant Dazzler has a supervillain-level stalker, going so far as to unleash a Hulk at one of her concerts. While she makes it clear that she also likes the Mary Janes&#39; music, she really needed their drummer for her other skills.

                  Spider-Gwen Battles an All-New Doctor Octopus in Giant-Size Special   Marvel celebrates the anniversary of its Giant Size comic issues with a Spider-Gwen adventure that sees her facing off against a new Doctor Octopus.   





 Gwen Stacy Gets a Story Made for Her 


          

Spider-Gwen: Smash isn&#39;t an origin story, or adapting a Peter Parker Spider-Man story for her world. This is a series that could only be done with Gwen. While Spider-heroes of all stripes struggle with balancing their heroics and real lives, the similarities end there. This Gwen never even mentions Peter, focusing on her circle of friends, her band, and her family. She does get introduced to people whose multiversal variants she knows, a fun way for the creative team to flesh out the cast without bogging the reader down with remembering brand-new characters. This includes the obvious, like Dazzler, a mutant pop star with the exact same look and power set as her Earth-616 self; but also the more subtle, like Dazzler&#39;s brunette tour manager Natasha, who isn&#39;t immediately recognizable as the Black Widow, but clearly has skills beyond organizing roadies.




Created in 1965 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Gwen Stacy was meant to be Spider-Man&#39;s central love interest. She was a college student interested in science, and liked Peter for his intellect as much as his quips. However, Mary Jane Watson&#39;s personality had an edge that made her the fan-favorite girlfriend, and Gwen was just thought of as &#34;nice.&#34; Since Gerry Conway, John Romita, Sr, and Roy Thomas decided to kill her in 1973, Gwen Stacy has almost become better known for her death than for who she was as a person. Believing killing her to be a mistake, Marvel brought Gwen back in a variety of ways over the next 30 years: she was a clone, she secretly gave birth to Norman Osborn&#39;s twins, she was an alien sent to judge humanity. This Spider-Woman (aka Ghost Spider, aka Spider-Gwen) version of her premiered less than ten years ago, in the pages of 2014&#39;s Edge of Spider-verse, but fans were instantly hooked and demanded more.



 &#34;Gwen and the Holograms&#34; Bursts with Girl Power 
          




Comics in the modern age are full of interesting female characters, but there&#39;s still room for Gwen and her friends. The art from Enid Balám, Fer Sifuentes-Sujo, and Elisabetta D&#39;amico is angular and colorful, feeling like an intentional throwback to a 1990s style where pop groups and &#34;girl power&#34; were the rage. It&#39;s appropriate for this story that merges a musical tour with super heroics, owing to series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Jem and the Holograms. Like the leads of those shows, Gwen is a young woman who&#39;s still figuring out how to live her normal life, while dealing with the fantastic as her alter ego. The dialogue is fun and funny, establishing unforgettable characters like wannabe supervillain &#34;Pink Velvet&#34; in less than a dozen panels. Spider-Gwen: Smash is a welcome addition to the Spider-Gwen canon, and can be enjoyed by longtime fans and new readers who like the Spider-Verse films.
