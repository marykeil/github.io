# Thor Names the 1 Marvel Villain Who s Actually Worthy of Mjolnir


## SUMMARY 



  More characters in the Marvel Universe are worthy of lifting Mjolnir than initially thought, including villains like Toranos.   Thor assembled a team of Mjolnir-worthy warriors called the Thor Corp to battle Toranos, an elder god.   Thor manipulated the enchantment on Mjolnir to allow him to choose who he deemed worthy, leading Toranos to wield the hammer temporarily as part of Thor&#39;s larger plan to defeat him.

## Literature Review

While other Marvel Comics characters have proven themselves worthy of Mjolnir in the past, Thor names the one villain who can also lift the hammer. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #5 There are very few people in the Marvel Universe who are worthy of lifting Mjolnir other than Thor, though not as few as one might think. The initial understanding of Thor’s relationship with Mjolnir is that no one can lift the hammer but him, though that misconception has been cleared up time and again (including in the MCU, when Captain America, Jane Foster, and Hela were able to wield Mjolnir). And now, one more name can be added to that seemingly ever-growing list, and this time, it’s a villain.




Throughout Marvel Comics, many characters have proven themselves worthy of lifting Mjolnir and temporarily gaining the power of Thor, including those many fans wouldn’t expect. While it’s always a shock when previously unknown characters wield the hammer, it’s arguably even more so when it’s someone fans have known for years. And Thor had just assembled a team of them called the Thor Corp.

          

One of the more notable legacy Thor characters who became worthy was the aforementioned Jane Foster, but she’s far from the only one. Loki also proved to be worthy, as did Ororo Munroe aka Storm. In fact, these three - along with Beta Ray Bill - joined Thor in his battle against a villain the likes of which Thor had never faced before, and one who would prove by the end of the battle that they, too, were worthy of Mjolnir: Toranos.




                  Thor Names the 5 Qualities That Make Someone Worthy of Mjolnir (Why Captain America Could Lift It in Endgame)   Thor clearly spells out what makes someone worthy of his hammer Mjolnir, which perfectly explains how the MCU&#39;s Captain America could lift it.   


 Marvel Comics’ Thor Just Confirmed Toranos is Worthy of Lifting Mjolnir 
          

In Immortal Thor #5 by Al Ewing and Martin Coccolo, Thor and his team of Mjolnir-worthy warriors are in the heat of battle against the elder God of the Superstorm, Toranos. This issue reveals Toranos’ origin story, how he was one of the first elder gods of Earth created by the Demiurge Primordial (aka the Godcreator). Toranos was the ‘First Thunderer’, and he was back to reclaim his position as such, which meant Thor needed to go.

Given his status as an elder god, Toranos was far too much for Thor to handle alone - and even too much for his team to handle collectively. When Loki launched Mjolnir at Toranos with a mighty hurl - following a few instances of Toranos feeling the sting of Mjolnir’s impact - Toranos finally had enough, and snatched the hammer from the air. Toranos took hold of Mjolnir and channeled the power of Thor through his own body, confirming in a horrifying instant that he was worthy.






 Thor’s Toranos Redefines What It Means To Be Worthy 
         

Toranos being worthy of Mjolnir is one of the more unique instances of someone other than Thor lifting the hammer, as he wasn’t worthy by his own merits, but because Thor deemed him so. The entire situation - while initially terrifying - was all a part of Thor’s plan. Thor altered the enchantment on Mjolnir, allowing him to choose who he deemed worthy. Then, when Toranos took the bait and wielded Mjolnir, he was literally filled with the power of Thor, which meant Thor’s understanding of his position as a god and how that impacts the lives of mortals flowed through Toranos as well. In a sneak attack akin to Ghost Rider’s Penance Stare, Thor floods Toranos with thousands of years worth of empathy, forcing him to feel the pain he and his superstorms inflicted on others. This pain was too much for Toranos to handle, and so he fled, dropping Mjolnir during his escape.




Toranos was worthy of Mjolnir, but only because Thor wanted him to be, as it was all a part of a larger plan to defeat Toranos once and for all. However, despite the ‘how’ or ‘why’ of it all, the fact remains that Marvel Comics’ Thor mythos just added one more warrior who is worthy of Mjolnir, and this time, that warrior is a villain.

Immortal Thor #5 by Marvel Comics is available now.
