Screen Rant is excited to share an exclusive preview for Deadweights #1, a new series from Ahoy Comics. Focused on two henchmen wanting a second chance at a normal life, the story continues the publisher&#39;s satirical superhero-genre tales. This series is set to subvert expectations of what villain life is like and answer the question of if villains can truly have normal lives.




Deadweights will be a six-issue series from the creative team of Tyrone Finch and Sebastián Píriz. Finch is known for his work on Swine and Station 19. Píriz previously worked on We Ride Titans and Exorcists Never Die. This new partnership presents readers with a comedic story full of action.

          

The first issue will have a main cover by Píriz and an incentive cover by Richard Pace. The incentive will extend across all six issues as Pace&#39;s art will form a linked image when put together. They will be centered on a &#34;mug shot&#34; theme, fitting the theme of villainy and criminal activity.

 Ahoy Comics&#39; Newest Superhero-  Title Centers on Villainous Henchmen 
Deadweights #1 Is On Sale April 10
         

Ahoy Comics is known for championing comic series that put twists on the superhero genre. This includes the Wrong Earth and its various one-shot issues expanding its world, as well as Penultiman, My Bad, and Second Coming. Deadweights will present the latest satirical superhero title focusing on villain life, sudden career changes, and the difficulties of adjusting to a new life. Non-traditional protagonists are where the publisher and the comic creators it partners with shine. Deadweights should be no exception, as it challenges what happens to henchmen when they attempt to live mundane lives. The synopsis for Deadweights is as follows:


Count Dingo and the Marauders are a team of misunderstood evil mutants bent on world dominatino, whose diabolical plans range from robbing local credit unions to unleashing a biological disaster that will rid the planet of all non-mutants. After Jerry &#39;Cannonbulk&#39; Patton and Clarence &#39;Bounder&#39; Barrett make a mistake that leads to another defeat at the hands of the mutant superhero team The Paladins, the two &#39;deadweights&#39; are unceremoniously dumped from the team. Realizing that they are not cut out for world conquest, Jerry and Clarence don pants and try to pursue ordinary lives - but going straight is not as easy as it seems. DEADWEIGHTS takes a hard look at what happens after the fight when the villains are tired of being villains, and the heroes aren&#39;t as heroic as they want you to think.







 Deadweights Uses Humor to Address Dreams, Friendship, and Villains&#39; Quality of Life 
          

Series writer Tyrone Finch provided further insight about the comic&#39;s themes:


At its core, Deadweights is about friendship. It&#39;s the story of two people who have been relentlessly beaten, battered, tossed off of bridges and forced to live in hideouts with no electricity or plumbing. But somehow, the two of them have never given up on each other or their dreams. When you look past their costumes, battles and vows to subjugate the human race; they&#39;re just a couple of guys looking to find a place for themselves in this crazy, mixed-up world.


Sebastián Píriz, the series artist, adds, &#34;Jerry and Clarence are two guys you can&#39;t help to feel bad for. The more you know them, the more you&#39;ll root for them - but that&#39;s the moment where Tyrone sends a curve ball to remind us that, just like in real life, things rarely are so simple as we&#39;d like.&#34;




AHOY Comics Senior Editor, Sarah Litt, says, &#34;I love the idea of DEADWEIGHTS. No one really looks at the aftermath of the fight, only the fight itself. I think DEADWEIGHTS is what happens when the villains figure out that maybe that life doesn&#39;t pay off after all.&#34;

Deadweights #1 will be available on April 10 from Ahoy Comics.
