## Literature Review

Morty has survived a lot of Rick&#39;s dangerous adventures, with a Rick &amp; Morty comic revealing he technically almost never lives through them at all.




Spoilers for Rick and Morty #9!In Rick and Morty lore, Morty has been on more adventures with Rick than he can count, with each new escapade hiding death and danger around every corner, whether on their own Earth or one of the many multiversal versions of it. And now, in a Rick and Morty comic, it’s revealed exactly how Morty keeps surviving even the most harrowing of events, with the reasoning being that he technically doesn’t thanks to one important Rick-sanctioned solution.




A show and comic that more often than not “resets” continuity after each arc — meaning that most of what happens is put back to “normal” after everything is said and done — Rick and Morty as a series does adhere to certain important events from time to time, but cherry-picks said events as needed.

          

And when trying to save Morty’s love interest, Noelle, from “…some plane of the dead” after a scuffle with a multiversal god named Nunzumel and a soul-sucking angel of death named Vultureperson, it’s revealed that Morty can’t simply die again to go rescue her, as according to Rick, Morty’s “99 video game-like lives” are running dangerously low and shouldn’t be wasted.

 Rick Gave Morty 99 Lives To Allow Him To Survive Their Adventures 
          

Confirming that Morty doesn’t survive most of his adventures in Rick and Morty #9, by Alex Firer and Fred C. Stresing, this reveal comes at a time when Rick has decided to use “ghost science” on Morty to hopefully allow him to travel to the land of the dead to convince its ruler to bring Noelle back in one piece. Smothering Morty in some protoplasmic goo that essentially turns him into a ghost-like being, Morty asks Rick why he can’t just be killed again, with Rick blatantly telling him, “You die too much!” only to then wonder aloud how many lives Morty has remaining, a count that clearly isn’t as high as it should be.




Considering all the ridiculous and unbelievable situations Morty has gotten into with his grandpa in the past, Rick giving Morty 99 lives makes complete sense, as it’s not only a necessity in Rick and Morty’s line of work but ensures that Morty will survive long enough to hopefully save the day or, more likely, quite literally die trying. To make matters worse, Morty even lists off a few of his completely unnecessary deaths, like losing twelve lives to a “really hard jump” he tried to do, to say nothing about the countless other times this series has given Morty a close call or heavily insinuated his demise otherwise.

So while it’s unclear as to how many do-overs are left in Morty’s 99 life buffer, it’s almost certain there isn’t enough for him to continue to recklessly throw them away while on missions, especially if dying is something that can be avoided entirely. Regardless, it’s exciting to finally have a definitive answer as to why Morty has “survived” so many problematic and deadly events over the years, making Rick and Morty’s 99 life explanation an intriguing wrinkle in this franchise’s ever-expanding lore that fans absolutely need to know about.






Rick and Morty #9 is now available from Oni Press.
