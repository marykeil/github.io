Summary

  Wolverine&#39;s healing factor not only heals him, but also allows the creation of gruesome distractions in combat, giving him an edge against the Predator.   The conflict between Wolverine and the Predator in Predator vs. Wolverine #3 showcases the titular hero&#39;s tactical fighting style.   Wolverine&#39;s healing factor makes him virtually indestructible and adaptable to different situations.  







Best known for his fierce fighting style and healing factor, a new preview features Wolverine showing how his abilities can be tactically used in combat. Predator vs. Wolverine #3 continues the X-Men member&#39;s fight against the Yautja. While it&#39;s base purpose is to heal him, the Marvel hero&#39;s healing factor also allows him to create impressive, yet grotesque, distractions.

Wolverine&#39;s healing factor has been a defining aspect of his character design for decades. It has brought him back from the brink of death countless times. This power is often compared to Deadpool&#39;s, as well as Venom now that the symbiote has received impressive upgrades. Nonetheless, Wolverine is often setting the bar on a healing factor&#39;s broader potential.

          

Now, Wolverine has found himself up against a superior foe: the Predator. Known as the Yautja, this alien species is one of the galaxy&#39;s fiercest fighters. As a hunting society, these killers are known to confront humans for hunting sports and training exercises. With the 20th Century Fox and Walt Disney Company mergers, Marvel is getting to pit two of its best fighters against each other, expanding on Wolverine&#39;s healing factor along the way.





  : Predator&#39;s Ultimate Yautja-Killer Is Finally Going Up Against a Super PredatorPredator vs. Wolverine Brings About A New Battle Tactic for the Mutant 
         

Predator vs. Wolverine #3 continues the conflict begun by this 2023 series in which the titular characters are facing off with one another. The issues have established three different encounters the two have had over time, but one of the latest conflicts has shown Wolverine&#39;s cunning. To be one of the best fighters on the X-Men, it stands to reason that Logan would need to be tactical about how he fights several of his foes. In a preview of the upcoming issue featuring these violent altercations, his healing factor allows him to provide a smokescreen of sorts. This lets him get away from a tight situation, which could give him an upper hand in the overall battle.

After falling off a cliff while tactically retreating, Wolverine is pinned underwater by several large rocks. This puts him in a vulnerable position against the Predator who has followed him into the water below. Instead of being at his opponent&#39;s mercy, however, Logan uses his wounds to his advantage, cutting himself so blood leaks around him, becoming a bloodscreen that masks him from the Predator&#39;s heat vision. This gives him enough time to get free and finish retreating to regroup with a new plan of attack.






 Wolverine&#39;s Healing Factor is Adaptable to Different Situations 
          

Wolverine&#39;s healing factor allows him to regenerate bones, tissue, organs, and basically any part of his body that gets damaged. This has allowed him to be largely indestructible and incredibly versatile in numerous missions and situations. He can go up against the hardest hitters and most violent enemies with limited fear in most cases. Already Marvel has shown that Venom can regroup from a pile of mushy remains, which means Wolverine should theoretically be capable of the same. However, the X-Men hero has had his powers longer and is capable of using his wounds and healing ability to his advantage tactically, giving him defense against what could be one of his deadliest foes yet. It&#39;s likely Wolverine could keep developing new methods of using his healing factor to his advantage in the future given this brief glimpse into his latest tussle with the Predator.




Predator vs. Wolverine #3 will be available on November 29 from Marvel Comics.
