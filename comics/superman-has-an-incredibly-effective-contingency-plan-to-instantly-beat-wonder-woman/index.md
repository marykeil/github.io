Wonder Woman is one of the most dangerous people in the Justice League, exhibiting few – if any – weaknesses. Unlike characters like Superman, who have predefined vulnerabilities, Diana is nearly unstoppable, which is why Batman has struggled to bring her down in the past. However, Superman revealed that he has one power that can instantly take Diana out of a fight, at least for a short duration.

Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 – by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, Tamra Bonvillain, and Steve Wands – finds Batman and Superman trapped in DC&#39;s Kingdom Come alternate reality, facing off against a mind-controlled Justice League. For a time, it seems as though the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel are completely outmatched, especially considering Diana Prince is on the other side of the conflict.

          




Characters like Batman have always struggled to bring down Wonder Woman in a way that makes sense, but Superman has the answer. Superman who manages to bring her down with quick use of his freezing breath. This freezes Diana solid and instantly takes her out of the fight.

                  &#34;Heir to the Kingdom&#34;: Batman &amp; Superman Travel to the Kingdom Come Universe in Official Prequel   Kingdom Come, the iconic classic four-issue miniseries from 1996 returns to DC&#39;s forefront as main canon Batman and Superman meet their counterparts.   


 Superman Ices Wonder Woman Out 


          

Batman is infamously able to take down anyone given enough prep time. He&#39;s perfectly capable of taking down speedsters like the Flash or heavy hitters like Superman, but the times he&#39;s taken down Wonder Woman have never fully made sense. Batman&#39;s contingency plans to defeat Wonder Woman shouldn&#39;t actually work, due to her power set. Batman&#39;s plans usually involve trapping Diana in some form of lie, either with robotics, or magic. But Diana has the power to see through all lies, even once pulling herself out of the Black Mercy, a feat no other character has done. However, in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22, Superman displayed an ability that effectively neutralized Wonder Woman.






DC&#39;s Kingdom Come continuity first appeared in 1996, in a four-issue miniseries written by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, with art by Alex Ross.




Wonder Woman&#39;s powers are nearly on par with Superman, with none of the discernible weaknesses. Superman can be taken down by magic, Kryptonite, and red sunlight, but Wonder Woman doesn&#39;t have any such obvious vulnerabilities. She has the power to shatter mountains, and she can&#39;t easily be brought down, so the only real option is to contain her. That&#39;s where Superman&#39;s freezing breath comes in. Using it in World&#39;s Finest #22, he was able to completely freeze Diana in place, instantly taking her out of the fight. While this may not have contained her for long, it kept her immobilized long enough to improve Superman and Batman&#39;s chances of survival.



 Wonder Woman Can Be Slowed Down, But Not Stopped 


          




There are tons of heavy hitters in the Justice League, but almost all of them have predefined weaknesses that can be easily exploited. Superman can be taken down with Kryptonite. Martian Manhunter can be taken down with fire. Wonder Woman has no real weaknesses.Batman&#39;s contingency plans for fighting Wonder Woman should not work, and only have in various stories for plot reasons. As witnessed in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22, Superman found a perfectly viable option. Using his frost breath, the Man of Steel was able to take Wonder Woman out of a fight and contain her for a good while.
