# Disney Chose Its 100th Anniversary to Officially Confirm a Dark Lion King Fan Theory Is 100% True


## SUMMARY 



  2023 was Disney&#39;s 100th Anniversary, and the House of Mouse verified a dark fan theory.   Disney has confirmed that the hyenas in The Lion King survived by eating each other, with Whoopi Goldberg&#39;s Shenzi called out as a cannibal.   It&#39;s an incredibly dark reveal, but it explains how an army of hyenas survived despite being banned from the Pride Lands.

## Literature Review

2023 was Disney&#39;s 100th anniversary, and while it wasn&#39;t a great year for new movies, Lion King fans did get a wild fan theory confirmed.




2023 was Disney&#39;s 100th Anniversary, and while the year was marred by some major box office disappointments, the House of Mouse did make one bold choice that fans are still talking about - confirming a beloved Lion King character is an out-and-out cannibal. It&#39;s an idea that&#39;s been batted around in fan circles for decades, and yet one that no-one ever expected Disney to actually confirm.




Disney&#39;s 100th Anniversary saw the release of several titles in its Disney Villains comic line, published by Dynamite Comics. One of these was Disney Villains: Scar (from Chuck Brown and Trevor Fraley), which follows the 1994 movie villain as he recruits his hyena army and plots to kill off Mufasa and Simba. Spying on the hyenas while considering how to bend them to his will, Scar learns that - cut off from the prey animals of the Pride Lands - the hyenas have turned to cannibalism to survive.

         

Unlike some of Disney&#39;s darkest concepts, this isn&#39;t simply hinted at or implied. When Whoopi Goldberg&#39;s movie character Shenzi is selected as the latest hyena to be sacrificed to keep the pack fed, their leader - the Queen of the Bone Eaters - makes it clear the hyenas will kill and eat her, and that she&#39;s taken part in similar attacks before, declaring:





Don&#39;t embarrass yourself, Shenzi. You&#39;ve eaten your fill at feasts just like these. Now it&#39;s your turn to be the feast.

 Lion King&#39;s Hyenas Survived by Eating Each Other 
Being Banned from the Pride Lands Left Them with No Option
          

While it was a surprising move for Disney to confirm a beloved children&#39;s character is a cannibal, it does make sense for the wider Lion King story. In the original movie, the hyenas are banned from hunting in the Pride Lands due to their reckless slaughter of prey animals, and yet once Scar takes power, there are enough of them left to form an army that even intimidates the lions. Dark as Disney Villains: Scar&#39;s solution is, it does at least explain how the hyenas survived during the periods where they couldn&#39;t sneak into Mufasa&#39;s domain to feed. It also adds a poetic note to Scar&#39;s eventual death, savaged by his own hyena enforcers - he knew exactly what he was dealing with from the start, but arrogantly assumed he could keep ahead of their hunger.






 2023 Was a Great Year for Disney Comics 
Disney Villains Might Be Dark, But It Told Some Great Stories
         

2023 also saw the release of Disney Villains: Maleficent (Soo Lee) and Disney Villains: Hades (Elliott Kalan and Alessandro Ranaldi.) The latter essentially set up an entire cinematic universe spinning out of Hercules, introducing an army of new heroes and villains pulled from Greek myth - though it did risk its own controversy by effectively removing the 1998 animated Hercules TV series from Disney canon. A fun romp, Hades had the energy of a straight-to-video movie sequel (which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing), but Maleficent was easily the year&#39;s must-read Disney comic.

While 2014&#39;s Maleficent movie (starring Angelina Jolie) already did a well-received job of humanizing the &#39;evil&#39; witch, Disney Villains: Maleficent accomplishes the same feat without softening her animated movie story. The series follows Maleficent during the years that Sleeping Beauty was locked away, and sees her caught up in a series of encounters that lead up to a duel with her heroic counterpart, the Wizard. Without rewriting Maleficent as a hero, the series subtly explores her moral perspective, as she steadfastly refuses to allow anyone to cross her and get away with it.




While 2023&#39;s Disney movies may have disappointed, its comics proved to be underrated gems, with Disney Villains: Scar coming from nowhere to offer up one of the darkest pop culture moments of the year - and making it impossible to watch The Lion King the same way ever again. Roll on 2024, and the upcoming Disney Villains: Cruella De Vil (coming January 10 from Dynamite Comics.)
