## Literature Review

Daredevil has been in plenty of intense fights, but one particular brawl from an older comic took things to an absolutely absurd level.




There are few characters in comics who have been in as many brutal fights as Daredevil has. Be it on TV or in the pages of a comic, Matt Murdock has gone through some legitimately rough battles. But one particular brawl stands out from the rest by not only giving a dark twist to Daredevil&#39;s blindness, but also elevating one of his most famous MCU fights to the next level. While Daredevil is certainly used to fighting criminals, this fight was something he&#39;d never expected.




One of the roughest fights Daredevil has been in takes place in 2013&#39;s Daredevil #24 by Mark Waid, Chris Samnee, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Carmagna. At this point, Daredevil has been dealing with a ton of things lately, and now some villain has unleashed a group of criminals who have the exact same powers as him.



          

But instead of using these to commit crimes, they&#39;re driven insane and just go rabid throughout the city. When Daredevil finally brings them down, a large box arrives at his office. When the package is opened, it contains a pack of rabid dogs who also have his powers. This leads to a rough battle between Daredevil and a group of rabid dogs with superpowers.

                  Matthew Murdock Is the Most Important Half of Daredevil&#39;s Identity   Daredevil admits that his vigilantism is useless if he is not also able to address the wrongs in the legal system as lawyer Matt Murdock.   





 Daredevil Faces Off Against Super-Powered Dogs 


          

Daredevil has some of the best powers of Marvel&#39;s street-level heroes. His radar powers allow him to &#34;see&#34; 360 degrees around his body and enable him to quickly respond to any threat with almost supernatural speed and accuracy. These powers took him years to master so that he wasn&#39;t overwhelmed by all the things he could sense and hear. While Daredevil was eventually able to overcome this weakness, other people may not be so lucky. When random people are subjected to Daredevil&#39;s power, they often quickly go mad and practically turn feral. This is especially true of animals, which Daredevil found out the hard way.

The Netflix Daredevil series is famous for its gritty, extended fight scenes, and his dog pack fight takes this tradition even further with Daredevil facing off against several rabid dogs, completely unarmed. These dogs have been driven insane due to being put through experiments meant to replicate Daredevil&#39;s powers. Not only is this a ridiculously dangerous situation for Daredevil to deal with, but it&#39;s also a hint at the culprit behind it. Daredevil is blind, and his nemesis Bullseye knows this; the dogs are a sick mockery of seeing-eye dogs that Bullseye sends to specifically mess with Daredevil. It&#39;s a twisted joke only Bullseye would find funny.






 Matt Manages To Safely Defeat The Rabid Dogs 


          



One benefit of Daredevil&#39;s training is that he is aware of his weaknesses, and knows the effects that loud noises will have on his senses. He&#39;s able to leap past the dogs and pull a fire alarm, overwhelming and incapacitating them. Matt has been in a huge number of fights over the years, and it&#39;s something his TV show was absolutely renowned and praised for. And one of the worst fights he&#39;s gotten through is without a doubt facing off against a pack of vicious rabid dogs who have the same powers as him as a sick joke from Bullseye. As always, Daredevil manages to get through to the other end and, even more impressively, he manages to do it without really hurting the dogs. No matter what fights Daredevil has to go through, he will always prove that he&#39;s one of Marvel&#39;s greatest heroes.
