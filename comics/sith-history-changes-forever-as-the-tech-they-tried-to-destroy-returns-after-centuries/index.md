## Literature Review

Dark Droids was the peak of the Disney era Star Wars canon so far, introducing a major new villain with lore-changing ties to Sith history.




Marvel&#39;s &#34;Dark Droids&#34; crossover event changed the history of Star Wars in radical ways, recontextualizing the role of the ancient Sith in the galaxy, and providing the franchise with a thrilling new villain. The Scourge, a viral artifical intelligence, nearly succeeded in bending all life in the galaxy to its will. As the series revealed, this was not the first time the Scourge attempted to conquer the galaxy – and it very likely won&#39;t be the last.






The Scourge proved to be a catastrophic threat to galactic civilization, as well as one of the most exciting new creations in the Star Wars Expanded Universe since the start of the Disney era; it can be argued that the new enemy introduced in Dark Droids rivals even the best the late Legends continuity had to offer.




Star Wars: Dark Droids #5 – written by Charles Soule, with art by Luke Ross, color by Alex Sinclair, and lettering by Travis Lanham – concludes Marvel&#39;s major Star Wars crossover, an event series unlike anything the franchise has produced before. The series introduced novel concepts, including its primary villain, as well as the &#34;Second Revelation,&#34; a group of sentient droids fiercely determined to protect their agency from the makers and the threat of the Scourge alike.



          

At the same time, Dark Droids tied these exciting new elements of Star Wars mythology into its classic antagonists, the Sith, rooting the Scourge in the deepest depths of the galaxy&#39;s ancient past.





 &#34;Star Wars&#34; Grandiose New Villain The Scourge Was Born Of Dark Side Technology 
         

The lead up to Dark Droids revealed that an ancient Dark Side cult once attempted to artificially replicate the Force, giving rise to an AI known as the &#34;Spark Eternal.&#34; Star Wars has always been captivating in large part due to the way mysticism and technology coexist within the franchise. The Force is a metaphysical energy, and the galaxy&#39;s Force-wielders are practitioners of a mystical art. The majority of beings in the Star Wars galaxy rely on advanced technology, including the artificial lifeforms known as droids. The galactic-level threat known as the Scourge was born when the Spark Eternal merged with another ancient Sith AI.

The Scourge proved to be a catastrophic threat to galactic civilization, as well as one of the most exciting new creations in the Star Wars Expanded Universe since the start of the Disney era; it can be argued that the new enemy introduced in Dark Droids rivals even the best the late Legends continuity had to offer. The Scourge&#39;s viral consciousness spread among droids all across the galaxy, turning them against their makers. As Dark Droids progressed, it became evident the new villain&#39;s ambitions were even greater, as it sought to gain entry &#34;into the meat,&#34; in order to ultimately possess all lifeforms in the galaxy, biological and mechanical.






 The Scourge Surpassed The Sith As The Greatest Threat To The Galaxy 
          

In Dark Droids #5, the Scourge did find its way to spread to biological beings, briefly taking control of Luke Skywalker and declaring itself &#34;the new Force&#34;, before this truly unimaginable threat was averted by the combined efforts of humanoid and droid heroes. In this sense, the Scourge fulfilled the original purpose of the Spark Eternal – to find a technological alternative to the Force. In its own malformed way, the Scourge flowed through all it possessed, and bound them together. The long-term impact of Dark Droids may, in fact, be the idea that, rather than being the ultimate threat to the Star Wars galaxy, the Sith were merely its creators.

As the franchise has emphasized time and again, the Dark Side of the Force is part of a natural equilibrium between good and evil. Rather than twisting something pure to their own sinister ends, the Sith tap into something that already exists within the natural cosmic order. The Scourge was a truly revolutionary creation, which sought to completely supplant the existing Force, in a way the Sith couldn&#39;t fathom. By weaving this threat into the fabric of Star Wars history, Dark Droids added a layer of complexity to the franchise&#39;s tale of cyclical conflict that it should, and almost certainly will, return to.
