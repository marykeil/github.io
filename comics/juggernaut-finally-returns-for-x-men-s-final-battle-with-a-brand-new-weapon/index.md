## Literature Review

As the X-Men&#39;s final battle begins, the Juggernaut finally returns to the front lines of the war for mutantkind, now toting a major new weapon.




Warning: contains spoilers for The Fall of the House of X #1!As the X-Men&#39;s final battle begins, the Juggernaut finally returns to the front lines of the war for mutantkind, now toting a major new weapon. In recent months, Juggernaut has been imprisoned by the anti-mutant extremists Orchis after falling to the Super-Sentinel Nimrod during 2023&#39;s Hellfire Gala. Now, the Unstoppable Juggernaut is looking to make up for lost time.




In Fall of the House of X #1, the X-Men&#39;s fightback against Orchis begins. As the mutant-hating group subjects Cyclops to a show trial ahead of his execution, the X-Men&#39;s many allies and splinter teams head into action, coordinated by Kate Pryde&#39;s Shadowkat. Recently freed from imprisonment, Juggernaut is revealed to be based at Charles Xavier&#39;s School for Gifted Children in Westchester, now wielding a gigantic gun stolen from Cable&#39;s armory.

          

While the Juggernaut is one of Marvel&#39;s strongest characters, his new gun is undoubtedly a major upgrade. The recent Children of the Vault miniseries revealed that Cable keeps a cache of exotic weapons under the X-Men&#39;s school. Weapons seen in his collection include planet-destroying Kree Nega-Bombs, singularity-firing black hole guns, and a device for killing the godlike Celestials. Cable&#39;s armory represents the deadliest armaments that the time-traveling soldier could steal from the past, present and future, and there&#39;s reason to believe Juggernaut&#39;s powers will make them even more unbeatable.

                  10 Best Juggernaut Fights in Marvel History (Ranked by Power Level)   The Juggernaut has been in countless fights throughout his Marvel Comics history, but only a few show his true power. Here are the 10 best, ranked.    


 Juggernaut Is Packing One of Marvel&#39;s Most Powerful Guns 
Juggernaut&#39;s Powers Make His New Weapon Even Deadlier
         

At 2023&#39;s Hellfire Gala, Juggernaut had the honor of being voted onto the X-Men by his fellow mutants (as well as fans, thanks to a real-life poll.) Unfortunately, the joy only lasted for a second. Juggernaut&#39;s team were killed by Nimrod, who then beat Cain Marko almost to death. Juggernaut woke up in the Henry Gyrich Re-Education Center, where he was chained to Cyclops so that if he tried to escape, he&#39;d subject his ally to a gruesome death by pulling him through a tiny hole in the wall &#34;the size of a baseball.&#34; Worse, Orchis planned to drain Juggernaut of his blood, hoping that his powers of unstoppable momentum could be stolen. Thankfully, the X-Men recently broke Juggernaut out and will have the benefit of his Hulk-level power for their final battle.




Juggernaut&#39;s powers make him literally unstoppable once he&#39;s achieved sufficient momentum, however there are many ways to harness their potential. Juggernaut&#39;s powers are magic, making the boundaries of what he can do notoriously blurry. In past stories, it&#39;s been shown that past Juggernauts have used their powers to upgrade weapons - for example, Cain&#39;s predecessor carried a sword capable of cutting even the Juggernaut&#39;s mystic armor. This has also been seen to carry over to other mutants&#39; powers - Juggernaut&#39;s powers have combined with those of Magik and Jean Grey in the past, allowing them to turn him into a devastating missile.

Since Juggernaut gains his gun near the end of the issue, fans have yet to see exactly what it does, but his powers and the source of the weapon suggest it could end up being one of the most powerful firearms ever to appear in a Marvel comic. Of course, it&#39;ll need to be - Orchis&#39; weapons are legion, including Nimrod (who easily beat Juggernaut in combat) and the new Stark Sentinels, each of which is essentially Iron Man x 100. Hopefully after his membership in the X-Men was cruelly snatched away by Orchis, Juggernaut is about to get some major payback, as Marvel brings its multi-year Krakoan Era to a close.




The Fall of the House of X #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
