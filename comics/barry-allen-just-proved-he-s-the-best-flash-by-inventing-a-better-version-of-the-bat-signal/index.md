## Literature Review

Wally West may be the fastest Flash, but Barry Allen’s latest feat proves there’s more to being the Scarlet Speedster than superhuman swiftness.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World: Central City #1!Barry Allen has finally proven that one doesn&#39;t need to be the fastest speedster to be the best Flash. The world is spiraling out of control as &#34;Beast World&#34; rages on and the heroes need coordination now more than ever. A new feat of Barry&#39;s unites his family and shows off his amazing ingenuity.




Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City #1&#39;s overarching story by Si Spurrier and Scott Koblish, the Earth is inundated with animal hybrids, all changed by Beast Boy&#39;s spores. Flash tries to stay out of it, but can&#39;t when he discovers his old nemesis Godspeed has just become a massive wasp-like creature.

          

Flash decides to assemble the family by using the Cosmic Treadmill at the Flash Museum like a giant &#34;Flash Phone&#34; as Thunderheart describes it. All across the world, every hero connected to the Speed Force hears Barry&#39;s rallying cry, causing them all to gather at Iron Heights Penitentiary to stop the newly transformed Godspeed.


 Barry Allen&#39;s Ingenuity Makes Him a Better Flash Than Wally 
          




Barry Allen might have led the Flash Family for years, but Wally West has stepped up to become the de facto Flash of the DC Universe. After getting his family back and clearing his name from the Sanctuary incident in Heroes in Crisis, Wally&#39;s exploits have been the focal point of the Flash corner of the DC Universe. Throughout the Infinite Frontier and Dawn of DC eras of DC Comics, Wally&#39;s shown just why he&#39;s the Fastest Man Alive. In his series, he&#39;s performed outrageous feats such as outrunning an eternal hallway and gaining new moves that allow him to step outside of reality.

While Barry is undoubtedly one of the fastest beings in the DC Universe, Wally became the faster Flash a long time ago. Wally studied and refined his skills, pushing his abilities to heights that even Barry couldn&#39;t reach. While Barry seems to have accepted that fact, his latest trick shows that there&#39;s more to being the Flash than just speed. Barry needed to think fast and come up with a way to unify his family in seconds to stop Godspeed, and his creation of the Flash Phone was an inspired way of achieving that goal. Sure, he can&#39;t run as fast as Wally, but Barry&#39;s cleverness is far more valuable than speed.






 Speed Alone Doesn&#39;t Make a Great Flash 
          

Nearly everyone in the Flash Family can reach incredible speeds. But not everyone&#39;s as skilled at thinking on their feet or putting a plan into action. While there&#39;s no denying that Wally has done some amazing work thanks to his superhuman swiftness, the situation Barry encountered needed a more thoughtful solution. Thanks to his on-the-spot thinking, Barry got his family together quickly and helped mitigate the damage caused by Godspeed. Wally may be the faster speedster, but Barry&#39;s creativity may have earned him the right to call himself the best Flash.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
