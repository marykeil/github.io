# Why Iron Man Doesn t Use Adamantium in His Armor (Because He Discovered Its Weakness)


## SUMMARY 



  Adamantium, one of the strongest materials in the Marvel Universe, is not invincible and can be destroyed by Antarctic Vibranium.   Even the most well-designed adamantium armor would be no match for the effects of Antarctic Vibranium, which can destabilize metal molecules.   Antarctic Vibranium, while difficult to acquire, has the potential to destroy entire cities if weaponized, making it a dangerous material to be used against adamantium.

## Literature Review

Adamantium seems like a natural choice for armor, but Tony Stark knows too much about its biggest weakness to ever rely on it as Iron Man.




Adamantium is one of the strongest materials in the Marvel Universe, but Iron Man discovered the secret to its destruction. The coveted material frequently gives the likes of Wolverine an edge in battle, and it stands up well against even the might of the Hulk, but it isn’t invincible. Tony Stark will never wear an adamantium suit because he knows Antarctic Vibranium obliterates it without contest.




In 2006&#39;s Iron Man #12 - written by Daniel and Charles Knauf, with art by Patrick Zirche - Iron Man’s Argonaut suits are out of control and causing destruction everywhere. There are five in total, each designed for a specific purpose and made with varying materials to support that. One of the suits, which Tony dubs the “Battle Argonaut,” is made with adamantium. It is, as expected, incredibly powerful.



          

Yet, strong as it may be, Tony holds the key to its destruction already. Antarctic Vibranium, the material used to build the “Subterranean” Argonaut suit, renders adamantium all but useless. It rips apart the Battle Argonaut suit, proving once and for all that Iron Man will never be caught wearing adamantium armor.


 Iron Man Knows How to Destroy One of the Strongest Metals 

Adamantium can stand up to nearly anything, and it has been put to the test through decades of Marvel’s most grueling battles. Wolverine and his family are still standing, after all, and shredding their way through any number of enemies. Within the adamantium family, there are different levels of strength, with True Adamantium ranking as the strongest. Unfortunately, even at peak strength, it is no match for Antarctic Vibranium. That type of vibranium is, essentially, the “kryptonite” for all things adamantium, and even the most well-designed armor wouldn’t stand a chance against it.




As Iron Man #12 shows, Antarctic Vibranium completely dismantles the adamantium suit just by being in its vicinity. Since vibranium is a component of the adamantium alloy, it’s little surprise that the effect is so strong, but Antarctic Vibranium affects all metals. It works by emitting vibrations to destabilize molecules, sometimes to the point that metal becomes liquid. The Battle Argonaut isn’t even pure adamantium. It only has a coating, but that is enough to render it vulnerable. If Iron Man flew around in an adamantium suit and just one villain got their hands on Antarctic Vibranium, he’d be left completely helpless or worse.



 Adamantium’s Biggest Weakness is Difficult to Acquire 
          



Wakandan Vibranium absorbs various forms of energy, but the Antarctic variation is the opposite. Instead of absorption, it emits vibration.







Although adamantium does have an incredibly effective weakness, Antarctic Vibranium isn’t something purchased at the corner store. While it isn’t a total secret, few people know what Tony knows, let alone have access to the material. Antarctic Vibranium comes from the Savage Land, an aptly named tropical region of Antarctica where few successfully venture. Should it become widely used or weaponized, its effect on adamantium would be the least of anyone&#39;s worries. It could potentially destroy entire cities with minimal effort. Still, even the small chance of someone else discovering and using Antarctic Vibranium will prevent Iron Man from ever using adamantium to create his armor.
