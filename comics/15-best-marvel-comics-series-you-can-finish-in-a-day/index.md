## Literature Review

With more than 80 years of classic stories to draw from, here are 15 great Marvel Comics storylines that you can finish in just one day.




For the last 10 to 20 years, Marvel Comics has been a dominant force in popular culture. With an 80-year history and an entire cinematic universe to its name, Marvel is certainly not short of stories to keep readers entertained for hours. Fans looking to expand beyond the screen and branch out into the world of comics to find a single, standalone story to read in one sitting may be a daunting prospect, but they do exist… if you know where to look.
While chief competitor DC Comics has traditionally had more standalone, “evergreen” stories that can be collected into a single trade paperback, for a long time Marvel has stuck to the traditional model of the never-ending story of monthly comic books. The publisher has stepped up its game over the last few decades, though, with several memorable comics that can be collected on their own. Narrowing it down to a list of 15 is no easy feat, but here is a selection of Marvel stories that can be read in a single day.









 








 15  House of X/Powers of X 
Two Concurrent Miniseries Reinvent the X-Men


 







The “Krakoa” era of X-Men kicked off with the publication of these two 2019 miniseries, which launched the franchise into a bold new age that has shaped the X-titles ever since. Jonathan Hickman’s dense and intricate approach to storytelling is evident on every page, and artistic collaborators Jorge Jimenez and Pepe Larraz bring an energy and verve to the visuals as only two superstar talents can. With these two intertwining miniseries, the X-Men are set on a course that is still felt to this day, as all subsequent X-titles have followed the template and overall direction that Hickman, Jimenez and Larraz establish here.





 14  Secret Wars (2015) 
The Marvel Universe Comes to an End
        

In what may be the largest crossover in Marvel history, Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribic’s update of Secret Wars feels like the closing of one chapter and the beginning of another for the Marvel Universe. The story sees the various Earths in the larger Marvel multiverse collapse into a single Earth known as Battleworld. In an epic nine-issue series that sees the death and rebirth of the mainline 616 universe, perhaps the most significant event of the 2015 Secret Wars is the end of the Ultimate line, which allows Spider-Man Miles Morales to leave that universe and become a part of the main Marvel continuity for the first time.





 13  &#34;Black Panther: Panther’s Rage&#34; 
T&#39;Challa Meets Killmonger in One of Wakanda&#39;s Seminal Stories
        

While Black Panther first appeared in the pages of Fantastic Four, the character didn’t truly come into his own as a solo hero until this 1972 storyline. Coming from writer Don McGregor and artists Rich Buckler, Gil Kane and Billy Graham, the multipart “Panther’s Rage” that ran in Jungle Action #6-18 is an epic in every sense of the word, telling the story of a king who loses his kingdom and must fight to reclaim the throne. For the first time, Wakanda is fleshed out in a way that made the sovereign nation feel like a living, breathing place, and T’Challa and his supporting cast are given greater depth than ever before. Perhaps most significant of all is the introduction of Killmonger, the Panther’s most personal and longest-lasting villain, who would later be the featured antagonist in the 2018 film.





 12  Marvel: 1602 
Neil Gaiman Takes the Marvel Universe Back to the Elizabethan Age


 







Neil Gaiman’s debut Marvel work is one of the writer’s very best efforts in comics, a beautiful celebration of Marvel’s classic characters in a completely new context. Working with artist Andy Kubert, Gaiman&#39;s eight-issue miniseries from 2003 refashions the Marvel Universe for the Elizabethan age. Doctor Strange is reimagined as the court physician of Elizabeth I, while mutants are known as the “witchbreed” and subjected to the Spanish Inquisition. It all results in a story that captures the essential magic of the Marvel Universe, stripping away the trappings of continuity to make the characters fresh and new once again.





 11  Spider-Man: Blue 
Spider-Man &amp; Gwen Stacy&#39;s Love is Given the Spotlight It Deserves
        

The team of Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale created some of the most iconic superhero stories of all time, and Spider-Man: Blue from 2002-03 just might be the crown jewel of their Marvel work. Retelling the story of how Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy fell in love, Loeb and Sale distill all the angst and heartbreak of the classic Spider-Man comics into six issues. Parker struggles to balance his life as Spider-Man with his love life, more often than not succumbing to the old Parker luck as a result. It gives Sale the excuse to draw most of Spider-Man’s colorful rogues&#39; gallery, and the emotional gut punch at the end remains a powerfully moving moment to this day.





 10  &#34;The Punisher: Welcome Back, Frank&#34; 
The Punisher Brings His War Into a New Millennium
        

While it wasn’t the first Punisher story that Garth Ennis wrote, “Welcome Back, Frank” was easily the most important. Teaming with his Preacher artist Steve Dillon, Ennis returns Frank Castle to his former glory, taking a back-to-basics approach that successfully brings the character into the new millennium. Ennis would continue to write the character for much of the &#39;00s, setting the tone for the Punisher for nearly everyone who has tackled him since. It all starts here, though, where Frank Castle comes back from his supposed death and wages war on the Gnucci crime family. Equally hilarious and horrifying, “Welcome Back, Frank” is one of the best Punisher stories of all time.





 9  Inhumans 
Marvel&#39;s Forgotten Super-Family Get the Spotlight They Deserve
        

Paul Jenkins and Jae Lee’s Marvel Knights Inhumans series from 1998 took one of Marvel’s least-known properties and turned them into major characters. This Eisner Award-winning twelve-issue series takes the Inhumans and refashions the property with political intrigue, Game of Thrones-style power-plays and commentary on the class system. Black Bolt and his Royal family struggle to hold the domed city of Attilan together as his brother Maximus stirs dissent while the city faces threats from the outside world in a plot filled with complexity and nuance. Inhumans brought the titular royal family into the spotlight, and has yet to be matched in the years since.





 8  &#34;Moon Knight: From the Dead&#34; 
Marc Spector&#39;s Personalities Take on a New Role


 







Warren Ellis and Declan Shalvey’s six-issue run on Moon Knight in 2013 was another near-complete revamp, taking the Fist of Khonshu and reworking him for the 2010s. Ellis and Shalvey take the basic concept of Marc Spector’s various personalities and refashion them into something more tactical. Perhaps most memorable is the “Mr. Knight” persona, which sees Moon Knight trade in his tights for a sharp-looking white suit as he provides assistance to law enforcement on cases with a supernatural bent. Each issue tells its own standalone story, as Moon Knight takes on ghosts, a bizarre sleep experiment and a graveyard of mushrooms, resulting in one of the character’s best runs in comics.





 7  Alias 
Jessica Jones Embraces the Dark Side of the Marvel Universe
        

As the debut title in Marvel’s “Adults” Only MAX line, Alias hit the comics industry like a bomb when it launched in 2001. Brian Bendis and Michael Gaydos crafted a 28-issue run chronicling the adventures of Jessica Jones, a former superhero who gives up the tights to work as a private investigator. With the freedom to tell a gritty private eye story free from the constrictions of the Comics Code, Alias explores the seedier side of the Marvel Universe. In Jessica Jones, Bendis and Gaydos created a character to stand alongside the top Marvel heroes, and she’s been a major player ever since.





 6  &#34;Wolverine: Enemy of the State&#34; 
Wolverine Slices and Dices His Way Through the Marvel Universe
        

Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr.’s 2004 run on Wolverine #20-31 made up the epic “Enemy of the State” storyline, which sees Logan brainwashed by a coalition of different villainous organizations in the Marvel Universe, including the Hand and Hydra. Wolverine proceeds to wreak havoc at the behest of his new masters, with the creators treating the Marvel Universe as the ultimate playground. The second half sees Logan return to his senses, where he works with SHIELD to gain revenge on the Gorgon, the uber-villain who orchestrated his kidnapping in the first place. Millar’s knack for characterization and big-budget action was never better, and Romita’s art renders every bone-breaking fight with impeccable detail.





 5  Marvel Boy 
Is Noh-Varr a Hero or Villain?
        

Although it wasn’t Grant Morrison’s first Marvel work, 2000&#39;s Marvel Boy was certainly the first to leave a mark. Morrison’s Marvel Knights series with J.G. Jones takes the Marvel superhero concept all the way back to the days of Bill Everett’s Namor and Carl Burgos’ Human Torch, as the main hero of Marvel Boy is an outcast just as likely to destroy the world as he is to save it. As the sole survivor of a Kree military spaceship after it is shot down, young ensign Noh-Varr decides to gain revenge by waging war on humanity itself. Morrison’s penchant for mind-bending ideas is as sharp as ever, and Jones’ impeccable renderings perfectly capture the cultural zeitgeist of the new millennium.





 4  &#34;Fantastic Four: The Galactus Trilogy&#34; 
Lee and Kirby&#39;s Three-Issue Epic Redefines Marvel Storytelling


 







Fantastic Four #48-50 is perhaps the crowning achievement of Marvel’s Silver Age, one of the defining stories of Marvel’s First Family that has rarely been matched since. At this point in 1966, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby are firing on all cylinders, and the landmark first appearance of the Silver Surfer and Galactus feels like the apotheosis of their genre-defining collaboration. In an era when multipart stories were a rarity, having the arrival of Galactus spread out over three issues makes this story feel like a true epic. Yet what makes the story sing where others have failed is Lee and Kirby’s devotion to the small human moments, such as Alicia Masters convincing the Silver Surfer to turn against his master and fight for humanity at the story’s end.





 3  Marvels 
Alex Ross and Kurt Busiek Make Superheroes Feel Real
        

Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross’ 1994 chronicle of the birth of the Marvel Universe is still one of the best series Marvel has ever produced, a love letter to superheroes from two of the most prominent creators in the field. Marvels acts as Alex Ross’ coming out party, instantly pushing the artist’s position in the industry into the stratosphere. Ross’ fully painted renderings of all the classic Marvel superheroes make the characters feel real in a way they never had before, and placing the action from the ground view of everyday photojournalist Phil Sheldon only serves to add to the reality of the images. The story crafted by Kurt Busiek is equally up to the task, telling the major events of the “Marvels” in real time in a story that spans from 1939 to 1974.





 2  &#34;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#34; 
Bucky Returns to Life in a Story That Breaks All the Rules
        

It was one of the most sacred rules in comic books: no matter what, Captain America’s sidekick Bucky stays dead. It’s to the testament of writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve Epting that they not only brought Bucky back, but managed to tell what just might be the definitive Captain America story. The larger “Winter Soldier” storyline that ran in 2005 through Captain America (Vol. 5) #1-12 manages the impossible by taking a back-to-basics approach to Cap while also turning his world upside down completely. The reinvention of Bucky as a brainwashed Soviet assassin with a metal arm is a stroke of genius, setting the stage for Bucky/the Winter Soldier to become on of Marvel’s biggest characters on both the page and screen.





 1  &#34;Daredevil: Born Again&#34; 
Daredevil&#39;s Most Torturous Tale Resonates Decades Later
        

Daredevil #227-231 is perhaps still the best contained story arc that Marvel has ever produced, a landmark work featuring two masters of the medium at the height of their craft. Frank Miller and Dave Mazzucchelli&#39;s 1986 story takes Matt Murdock and puts the character through the ringer, tearing everything away to reveal the true hero underneath. Mazzucchelli’s work reaches new heights in collaboration with Miller’s scripts, resulting in the ultimate in hard-boiled character dynamics and superhero action. Much like Miller and Mazzuchelli’s later work on Batman: Year One, “Born Again” is a story that cast a long shadow for its title character for years thereafter, and the argument could be made that this classic Marvel Comics story still hasn’t been matched almost 40 years later.
