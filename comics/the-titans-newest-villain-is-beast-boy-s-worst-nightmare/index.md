## Literature Review

More information about the Titansâ€™ villain Apex Ava comes out as her secret origin is revealed, showing the similarities she shares with Beast Boy.




Warning! Preview Pages ahead for Nightwing #110!&#34;Beast World&#34; has already turned the Titans&#39; world upside down with its thousands of animal hybrids, and now a villain is copying Beast Boy&#39;s style. Fans have already been introduced to the strange new villain Apex Ava, but a preview is revealing her dark connection to Gar Logan and how she mirrors the animal-loving hero.




In a preview for Nightwing #110 by Tom Taylor and Sami Basri, a young woman by the name of Apex Ava is brought to Arkham Tower. Ava is a hunter who tattoos herself for every animal she&#39;s killed. Ava is also dying from Sakutia, the same disease that once plagued Beast Boy.

         

Ava is left alone in her room just as one of Beast Boy&#39;s &#39;Garro&#39; spores arrives and attempts to infect her. However, Ava kills the spore and consumes it. The spore reinvigorates Ava, whose eyes glow green after eating the parasite. She escapes her confinement in Arkham Tower, but not before killing the orderlies that processed her.


 The Titans&#39; New Villain is a Reverse-Beast Boy 
          




Things have been out of control ever since Beast Boy pushed himself to become a Star Conqueror to stop the Necrostar. After Doctor Hate mind-wiped him, &#39;Garro&#39; began unleashing wave after wave of spores on the Earth, transforming thousands of innocent people into hybrid creatures. Amid the chaos, Damian Wayne investigated the Gotham Zoo and discovered a menagerie of animal-human hybrids hiding there. While skulking around Robin encountered Apex Ava, the mysterious villain in charge of Gotham&#39;s infected. Before the Boy Wonder knew what hit him, Ava shoved a spore down his mouth, turning Damian into a cat hybrid.

There&#39;s much of Apex Ava fans don&#39;t know such as her power set or her ultimate plan. However, this preview gives fans a huge piece of her backstory, namely that she suffered from Sakutia, just as Gar Logan once did. This ailment combined with her eating a Garro spore explains Ava&#39;s green-hued skin and potentially how she came to control a legion of animal-human hybrids. However, aside from the disease and green skin, Ava differs from Beast Boy in one huge way: She&#39;s an elite hunter who stalks and kills animals for fun. If she has any of Gar&#39;s shape-shifting powers, Apex Ava will go down in DC history as Beast Boy&#39;s twisted opposite.






 Apex Ava is the Darkest Beast Boy Opposite Imaginable 
          

No one champions animal rights harder than Beast Boy, who recently led his team in the effort to repair the Borneo rainforest. But Apex Ava has no such fondness. She sees animals as nothing more than trophies for her to kill and collect. She&#39;s enough of a threat right now, but what if her exposure to the Garro spore has also given Ava the power to shape-shift like Gar? The world is enough of a mess right now thanks to all the destructive hybrids running around. The last thing the Titans need is a dark counterpart to Beast Boy on the hunt against the animal kingdom.

Nightwing #110 is on sale from DC Comics on January 16th.
