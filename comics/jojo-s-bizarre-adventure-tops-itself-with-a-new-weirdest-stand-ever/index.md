## Literature Review

Chapter 10 of The JojoLands has introduced a Stand user with what might be the most absurd ability yet in the series, and he&#39;s just an underling.





Summary

  Chapter 10 of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure part 9 introduces a ridiculously unique Stand ability that allows the user to merge into the background.   The ability breaks the fourth wall by acknowledging the framing of the manga panels, creating artistic opportunities for the mangaka.   Although the Stand is stealthy, it lacks offensive capabilities, leading the user to fight with a knife.  







The latest part of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, The Jojolands, has been off to a wild start, and that trend has only continued into chapter 10, which introduces one of the most ridiculous Stand abilities ever. The new enemy Stand user (who has yet to identify himself) wields a Stand which allows him to merge into the background from his target&#39;s perspective, opening the door for some truly bizarre and amazing manga panels.

Previously in The JojoLands, new protagonist Jodio Joestar was attacked by a man who looked almost identical to his companion, Paco, but his disguise started to crumble (literally) as a confrontation began. The man attacked Jodio with a knife, dangerously nicking his throat near major arteries. In Chapter 10, Paco gets into an up-close fight with the strange assailant, whose face begins to blend in with the background.

          




As the fight continues, Paco grabs the man&#39;s arm holding the knife, but finds that it becomes incorporeal as the man merges his arm with the clouds in the background behind him, allowing him to attack with it once more.

                  JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Part 9 Passes a Horrific New Milestone For the Series   Chapter 6 of the JoJoLands has brought a Jojo staple to the new series for the first time, and it proves that Araki is as horrifying as ever.   


 Jojo&#39;s Fourth Wall-Bending Stand is One of The Series&#39; Weirdest 
          

From an in-universe perspective, such an ability seems almost ludicrous on its face, as it requires knowledge the user shouldn&#39;t have (namely, the framing of the manga panel). It leans on the fourth wall, almost acknowledging that the story is just that, but it opens new artistic opportunities as well, which mangaka Hirohiko Araki didn&#39;t hesitate to seize upon. Mixing subject and background, Araki creates some very unique looking panels, most notably the one where the man attacks Jodio&#39;s sibling, Dragona Joestar, which sees the attacker blending in with clouds, buildings, and a flock of birds.




Weird Stand abilities are hardly new for Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, but few Stand abilities before this have so cleverly played with the fourth wall. It&#39;s clear that this particular Stand ability, while almost unparalleled for stealth, doesn&#39;t afford much in the way of offensive capabilities, hence the user fighting with a knife directly. It seems to make use of sand particles in some way to aid in the disguise process, although exactly what role the sand constantly flaking off the opponent has isn&#39;t yet known. Some fans suspect the sand may be a hint that the user is a Rock Human, a type of being introduced in part 8, Jojolion.

This new background-based Stand joins the ranks of many other bizarre abilities, such as a radio tower that imprisons exactly one person within it, a Stand which required its user to die before activating, and one that brings fictional characters to life. Of course, these incredibly strange powers are exactly what fans of Jojo are looking for, and they&#39;ve become the most iconic element of the franchise. It will be interesting to see how this enemy Stand user continues to employ his ability in the next chapter of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, and what other creative tricks that may lead to.
