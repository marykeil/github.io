## Literature Review

Razer&#39;s debut in Green Lantern comics not only validates the character&#39;s massive popularity, it seems to keep his animated backstory largely intact.




Warning: Spoilers for Green Lantern (2023) #7 ahead!




Green Lantern readers were delighted when fan-favorite animated character Razer made his long-awaited debut in comic book canon. His appearance is much more than a simple homage, however, as a few key lines reveal that his history from the animated series seems to have been left more or less intact.

The bulk of Green Lantern (2023) #7 consists of a flashback in which Hal Jordan tells Razer why he is in exile on Earth after Kilowog&#39;s apparent death after the Yellow Lantern Battery on Korugar exploded. Although Razer offers comfort, he reveals that the Blue Lantern Battery on Odym has also been destroyed and that he has come to ask Jordan for help.

          

This confirms that Razer&#39;s status as a Blue Lantern in the animated series has been preserved and that his entry into the mainline canon is not a full reboot for the character.






Green Lantern (2023) #7 is by the team of Jeremy Adams, Amancay Nahuelpan, and Romulo Fajardo, Jr.




                  DC&#39;s Most Underrated Green Lantern Shines in a Tribute to His &#39;90s Debut   Beloved Green Lantern Kyle Rayner finally gets his chance to shine on an amazing new variant cover that pays tribute to the heroâ€™s beginnings.   


 Razer&#39;s Return Fully Embraces His Animated History 
          

Initially debuting as a Red Lantern antagonist in Green Lantern: The Animated Series (2011), Razer and his anti-hero edge quickly became one of the show&#39;s breakout stars. Although the first season ended in a cliffhanger that teased a Blue Lantern redemption for the character, the show was unfortunately canceled and Razer&#39;s fate was left up in the air. Nine years later, Young Justice: Phantoms took fans by surprise when Razer returned in episode 19, &#34;Encounter Upon the Razor&#39;s Edge!&#34; Here the show was able to elaborate on his Blue Lantern training since his last appearance. Despite this, Razer&#39;s debut in DC Comics canon was not until Green Lantern (2023) #6, in which he suddenly arrives on Earth and greets Jordan as an old friend.




While Razer&#39;s lore is established in DC&#39;s animated series, it is not until Razer reveals that he has come to speak about the Blue Lantern Battery in the comics that his history is acknowledged. His first appearance has him in unfamiliar civilian clothes; while he appears to be wearing something resembling a Lantern uniform beneath his tunic, the sigil is completely blank. Revealing that Razer has come from Odym implies that he is indeed a Blue Lantern. This means that rather than introducing him into the comics as a blank slate to set up the narrative arc of his animated counterpart, DC has instead canonized major elements of his animated history.



 Razer Joins The Ranks Of Canonized Animated Characters 
          

There is a lot still to discover about the comic book version of Razer, though the way he has been introduced sets up certain expectations: given how integral the character of Aya was to his redemption arc in Green Lantern: The Animated Series, Razer&#39;s presence as a Blue Lantern in the comics implies Aya&#39;s existence in the timeline as well, which is an exciting tidbit for readers to look forward to. However Razer&#39;s history is explored in the comics, his inclusion is a major nod to fans of the Green Lantern animated series and a triumph that has been over a decade in the making.
