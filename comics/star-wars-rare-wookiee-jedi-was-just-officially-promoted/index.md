Summary

  Burryaga, one of the High Republic&#39;s most popular characters, is officially becoming a Jedi Knight.   Burry and Bell Zettifar, who both lost their masters to the Nihil, have a deep bond as friends and allies.   The High Republic Phase III is focusing on the increased promotion of Padawans to Knights in the wake of the Nihil&#39;s destruction.  







One of the High Republic&#39;s most popular characters has finally become a Jedi Knight in the Star Wars canon. One of the few Wookiees in the Star Wars timeline who joined the Jedi Order, Burryaga has been a beloved and ongoing character across multiple novels and comics since the High Republic&#39;s very first phase of stories. Now, The High Republic Phase III is finally making the Wookiee a full-fledged Jedi Knight.

As seen in the new preview for Star Wars The High Republic: Shadows of Starlight #3 by Charles Soule and Jethro Morales, Burryaha is joined by Bell Zettifar, another popular Jedi apprentice. Having returned to Coruscant in the wake of the Nihil marauders&#39; destruction of Starlight Beacon and subsequently claiming a vast region of space, it&#39;s all hands on deck at the Jedi Council has enacted the Guardian protocols, resulting in the increased promotion of Padawans to Knights. The preview pages and synopsis can be viewed below:

         





BELL ZETTIFAR: JEDI KNIGHT! Many JEDI KNIGHTS were lost in the fall of STARLIGHT BEACON, and many lost their way after the disaster. BELL ZETTIFAR did not. With his trusty charhound EMBER at his side, Bell will battle to rid the galaxy of the villainous NIHIL...and they won&#39;t be alone. Learn who survived the FALL OF STARLIGHT!


Having officially been knighted by the Jedi Council, a new chapter has begun for both Burry and Bell during the time of crisis for the High Republic Era.

 Burryaga- The History of The High Republic&#39;s Wookiee Jedi Explained 
From Padawan To Jedi Knight
          

The apprentice of Jedi Master Nib Assek, Burryaga Agaburry and his master were present during the Great Hyperspace Disaster. Burryaga was also the one who first realized that there were still innocent lives on board the fragments of a destroyed starship as they came out of hyperspace, requiring the Jedi Order to mobilize and save them. Assek and Burry also fended off the Nihil during one of The Halcyon&#39;s very first voyages, and they were also at the Republic Fair on Valo during the major Nihil attack and its massive death toll.




Most recently, Burryaga was on board Starlight Beacon when the Nihil marauders destroyed the station, resulting in the death of his master. Although Burryaga was proclaimed dead on board Starlight as well, he was later found by Bell before they were both recalled to Coruscant as seen in this new preview. Having since become a Jedi Knight, it does seem as though Burryaga&#39;s story is just getting started.



 What&#39;s Next For Burryaga During The High Republic? 
Joining Forces With Bell Zettifar
          

Having both lost their masters thanks to the Nihil, Bell and Burryaga share a deep bond as friends and allies, one that will hopefully be explored in the High Republic stories that are still to come. To that end, it will be very interesting to see what kind of work Bell has in mind while the Jedi recall is still in place. One can imagine that whatever Bell has planned, Burryaga will be right alongside him both in this new issue and beyond in the High Republic timeline.
