## Literature Review

In a new retelling of Poison Ivy&#39;s origin story, her ex-girlfriend the Gardener is making a return to play a major role in Pam&#39;s turn to villainy.




The Gardener, best known as the ex-girlfriend of the Gotham villain Poison Ivy, is making a grand return to the DC Universe in a brand-new origin story. Poison Ivy&#39;s relationship with Harley Quinn has become one of the most well-known romances in DC&#39;s history. However, Harley wasn&#39;t Ivy&#39;s first girlfriend — and her most important ex will be returning to Pam&#39;s life very soon.




The forthcoming Poison Ivy #20 by G. Willow Wilson and Marcio Takara will continue a deep dive into Poison Ivy&#39;s origins at the hands of her mentor and personal version of the Joker, Dr. Jason Woodrue. However, while she&#39;s navigating one of the most difficult points in her life, new student Bella Garten &#34;arrives on the scene and threatens to steal away the few nice things left in Pam&#39;s life.&#34; Check out DC&#39;s full solicitation:

 POISON IVY #20 (2022)                 Release Date:  March 5th, 2024    Writers:  G. Willow Wilson    Artists:  Marcio Takara    Cover Artist:  Jessica Fong    Variant Covers:  David Nakayama, Yanick Paquette, Tula Lotay, Sozomaika   ORIGIN OF SPECIES CONTINUES! Pamela Isley’s world is spiraling out of control thanks to the influence of her professor, Dr. Jason Woodrue. But just as things seem to be at their worst, a promising new classmate arrives on the scene and threatens to steal away the few nice things left in Pam’s life. Meet Bella Garten, a.k.a.…THE GARDENER.   






Dubbed the Gardener — her official villain name — Garten will have a major role in the upcoming arc, seeing as she plays a major part of who Ivy eventually will become — for better or for worse.

                  The Next DCeased?: DC’s Next “Zombie” Threat Has a Surprising Gotham Origin   DC is no stranger to the undead, but the newest wave is different, and they&#39;re all converging on Gotham to find their creator: Poison Ivy.    


 The Gardener&#39;s New Origin Hints at a Major Character Shift for Poison Ivy&#39;s Ex 
          

Introduced in Batman #107 by James Tynion IV, Jorge Jiménez, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles, Bella Garten was not only a major player during the Fear State event, she was also revealed to have played a huge part in Poison Ivy&#39;s life. They both share a common origin, as they gained their abilities from their student/teacher connection to Dr. Woodrue — at which point their relationship also began. They both even have powers rooted in plantlife, with Garten&#39;s being tied to hybridization of plants and animals. However, based on this issue&#39;s synopsis, the Gardener could undergo a major character shift and completely betray Ivy.




By stating that Garten could &#34;steal away the few nice things left,&#34; DC hints that she could be a toxic force that pushes Ivy further into her hatred of humanity. It&#39;s been well-established that the Gardener broke up with Ivy because she thought her partner was too extreme. Now, it seems like Ivy will be the one doing the breaking up — if the two even manage to begin dating in the first place. That said, this new origin for both her and the Gardener will supply newcomers with the basic knowledge needed to understand Ivy&#39;s former partner, especially following her appearance in 2022&#39;s Harley Quinn: Legion of Bats, which introduced fans of the hit Harley Quinn animated series to Bella Garten.



 Poison Ivy #20 Will Be a Perfect Jumping On Point for New Fans 
         

This new issue in the mainline DC canon could re-introduce new fans to a fascinating and underutilized character in Poison Ivy&#39;s history. This new glimpse at Ivy&#39;s past and her interactions with Bella Garten will be available to read in March 2024 when Poison Ivy #20 hits comic stands. The upcoming Origin of Species arc in Poison Ivy&#39;s celebrated solo series is clearly being established as a new beginning for Ivy. Now, with a new origin for her ex-girlfriend the Gardener on the horizon, the future for Poison Ivy is looking bright as her character is given a gripping refresh for the modern age.




Poison Ivy #20 is available March 5th, 2024, from DC Comics!
