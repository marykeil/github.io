 Black Solstice Takes A Viral Meme And Runs With It 


          

Readers may recall that in 2020, it became a meme on social media when it was suggested that black people around the world would receive superpowers beginning on December 21, 2020. That didn&#39;t happen, but this is the core concept behind the Oscar-winning writing duo&#39;s latest project. In the world of this graphic novel, every single black person on the planet gained a superpower on the last winter solstice. Those superpowers only lasted one day before quickly disappearing â€“ fast-forward to just under one year later, precisely three days before the next winter solstice, with citizens eagerly look forward to seeing if it happens again.




The preview opens with a newspaper headline asking, &#34;The Prophet &amp; Whore: Where Are They Now?&#34; The news story anticipates non-black businesses publicly increasing their support of black people and their businesses to ensure their safety as the next winter solstice draws near. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers playing basketball hypothesize what the criteria could be for getting superpowers, besides being black. They also reminisce about the year prior and all the powers different people got, ranging from the spectacular to just plain weird. In just a select few opening pages, Black Solstice does a great deal of work toward building its world.



 The World Building of Black Solstice 
         

The opening pages of Black Solstice introduce the prior year&#39;s events, and offers a tantalizing prelude to what may come next. These pages establish the various powers that citizens received, as well as how non-black people are reacting to the prospect of black empowerment once more on the horizon, as well as hinting at how astrologists and the like are studying the situation. There&#39;s also a subtle beginning to the question of how and why these powers manifested. With their new Dark Horse Comics series, Oscar-winning artists Travon Free and Desmond Roe will explore all the possibilities inherent in what began as a social media joke, conceptualized it into the fascinating story of Black Solstice.




Black Solstice goes on sale December 20, 2023 from Dark Horse Comics.
