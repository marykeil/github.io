## Literature Review

There&#39;s lots of gods traipsing around the Rick and Morty universe, with a comic adventure telling fans exactly how they work and where they came from.




Spoilers for Rick and Morty #9!In the Rick and Morty show and comic universe, there are more than a few omnipotent beings ruling space, time, the multiverse, and beyond who give shape and form to a series that’s all about cosmic stakes and scientific leaps in logic. And now, Rick and Morty has officially explained how gods work in their continuity, settling an important lore question with a satisfying answer fans need to know about.




Already confirming that Rick is one of the most unique Sanchezs ever thanks to him being the number one god-killer in the multiverse, the entire reasoning behind why gods exist and how their omnipotence is governed is an explanation that makes total sense once revealed.

          

And while it’s shown that when gods are killed they’re sent to a place called “Anti Hala” — a sort of opposite Valhalla where rebirth is possible — this is only a small part of the bigger picture, as each god-worshipping human follower essentially births these deities based on their lack of knowledge about the world around them, directly influencing these supreme beings and how they tick.

 Humanity&#39;s Thoughts of the Unknown Birthed Rick and Morty&#39;s Deities 
          

Explained in Rick and Morty #9 by Alex Firer and Fred C. Stresing, this new god-related information is revealed on a splash page depicting various gods and the humans who have brought them to life. Telling readers, “When man did not know who rose the sun… when man did not know who grew the food… when man did not know what made the beasts… they said it was the gods,” the narration continues to say, “For in every ancient impulse… every need… every pain… the gods were there.” Next revealing that “…mortals grew resentful of the gods’ them-given power,” it’s here where it’s confirmed who gives these entities their power: humans.

Like Neil Gaiman’s American Gods lore that states gods are created and sustained depending on what people obsess over and worship, Rick and Morty similarly putting humans at the center of these literal god complexes ensures that they can also destroy what they’ve created, bringing Anti Hala into the conversation and this concept full-circle. And with gods like this comic arc’s antagonist, Nunzumel, the soul-devouring angel of death, Vultureperson, the featured deities in these images like the vegetable or finger nail-god, and more constantly popping up, it’s easier than ever to understand how omnipotence personified came to be, and where it could be heading in future stories.

So though there are gods in the Rick and Morty multiverse, they only exist in certain realities and under certain human-assigned conditions, and like the literal booger god created by a random eighth grader, as seen in this issue, they can only exist with the help of humanity. Whether it be in the animated or comic space, Rick and Morty will undoubtedly continue to introduce, kill off, and rebirth more gods than either titular protagonist can keep track of, with the laws of how their omnipotence functions across the multiverse now definitively laid out for fans to pour over and discuss.



Rick and Morty #9 is now available from Oni Press.
