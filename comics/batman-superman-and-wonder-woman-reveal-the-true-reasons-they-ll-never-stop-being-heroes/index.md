## Literature Review

Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman share the reasons why they will never stop being heroes, offering a rare glimpse into their individual psyches.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #4!While the reasons behind Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman becoming heroes are widely known, the mystery of why these Justice League members persist in their heroism has remained undisclosed—until now. In the 2023 Batman holiday special, DC unveils the true reasons why Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, and Diana Prince will never stop being heroes, providing readers with a rare glimpse into their individual psyches.




In the last installment of Jeff Parker, Stephen Segovia, and Danny Kim’s Batman / Santa Claus: Silent Knight limited holiday special, Robin asks Santa why he continues to go out and deliver presents, noting that the tradition of gift-giving would persist even if Santa stopped going out himself.

          

But instead of Santa answering Damian’s question, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman offer their own explanations for why Santa continues to deliver gifts. However, the Trinity&#39;s responses inadvertently delve into their own reasons for continuing to be heroes, even though the &#34;tradition&#34; of protecting people would carry on without them through the actions of other heroes.

Instead of Santa answering Robin&#39;s question, Batman steps in, responding, &#34;Because he&#39;s driven. He can never stop seeing the child who needed the gift.&#34; Batman&#39;s response subtly alludes to the tragedy of his parents&#39; death—the very motivation that led Bruce to become Batman. However, Batman&#39;s answer also unveils the depth of his personal struggle, revealing that he continues his nightly crusade against crime because he can&#39;t erase the haunting image of a child standing in an alley surrounded by the blood of his own parents. This unshakeable memory propels Batman&#39;s commitment to prevent any other children from enduring a fate similar to his own.

Although distinct, Wonder Woman and Clark&#39;s responses prove equally illuminating about their individual motivations. Diana shares, &#34;He can&#39;t stop because he seeks out the good. That&#39;s hope.&#34; Meanwhile, Superman offers, &#34;For yourself. You do it for you. Because nothing feels better than giving.&#34; Both responses delve into the profound depths of Diana&#39;s and Clark&#39;s motivations for persisting as heroes, offering insights into the core of their characters. Diana&#39;s commitment to heroism stems from a desire to witness the flourishing of goodness in the world, while Clark&#39;s superheroic endeavors are fueled by the intrinsic joy he derives from helping others.
