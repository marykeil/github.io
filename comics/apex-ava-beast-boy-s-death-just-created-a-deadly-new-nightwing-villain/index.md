Summary

  Nightwing will face a new villain named Apex Ava following Beast Boy&#39;s death, which will have significant consequences for the DC Universe.   Apex Ava&#39;s first appearance will be in Nightwing #109, with her full debut in Nightwing #110.   The relationship between Beast Boy and Apex Ava, including their shared green skin and affinity for animals, suggests a possible connection and motive for revenge or answers regarding Gar&#39;s death.  







Nightwing is due to get a brand-new villain while grieving his Titans teammate Beast Boy. DC Comics&#39; latest event, &#34;Beast World&#34; has officially kicked off with the death of Beast Boy. Granted, it&#39;s an unconventional death, so there&#39;s always room for a return, but this death will have massive ramifications for the DC Universe, including introducing an entirely new villain.

In a post on X, Nightwing writer Tom Taylor has confirmed that a new supervillain named Apex Ava will be debuting soon in the series spinning out of Beast Boy&#39;s death. Taylor promises that readers can expect their first look at Apex Ava in Nightwing #109, which is currently slated for a release on December 19. Sami Basri&#39;s character designs can be viewed below.


 




While there remains much to be revealed about who or what Apex Ava is or what will be fueling her villainy, much can be speculated based on the nature of Beast Boy&#39;s death and how the &#34;Beast World&#34; event is currently transpiring.


 How Does Apex Ava Factor into Beast Boy&#39;s Death? 
          

The &#34;Beast World&#34; event kicks into high gear during Titans: Beast World #1 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, where Brother Eternity lets Necrostar loose on the world, intending to destroy humanity. Beast Boy&#39;s best attempt to combat Necrostar is to model his latest transformation after Starro, which succeeds, but things go haywire when Doctor Hate suddenly wipes out Beast Boy&#39;s memory completely. Raven can no longer feel Beast Boy&#39;s mind, suggesting a death of sorts as this new nightmarish form of Beast Boy called Garro uses its powers to turn countless people on the planet into animal forms of their former selves.




Coming out of the aftermath will be Apex Ava, first appearing in Nightwing #109 for a small appearance before making her first full appearance in Nightwing #110. These character designs portray someone with tattoos of different animals across her body, which features a fur tarp across her back and a trifecta of knives hidden in her shorts. Beyond that, Taylor doesn&#39;t offer much additional information on what role Ava will play moving forward. When someone under Taylor&#39;s initial post replies asked if Ava is related to Beast Boy, Taylor simply replied, &#34;All will be revealed. In Nightwing #110.&#34;



 Are Beast Boy and Apex Ava  ? 
          

It looks like readers will need to wait until Nightwing #110 hits stores for more information about the character, but the question posed by the fan under Tom Taylor&#39;s first post makes a great point to ask. After all, both Beast Boy and Apex Ava can have green skin and a liking for animals. Don&#39;t be surprised if Ava shares Gar&#39;s shapeshifting abilities as well. The two may very well be revealed to be related. If this is directly related to Beast Boy&#39;s death, then perhaps her supervillain motivation is an attempt to get revenge, or at least get answers for Gar&#39;s death. Beast Boy doesn&#39;t currently have any siblings, but a twist revolving around Apex Ava could change his history forever.
