# Luke Skywalker s Latest Feat Makes His Force Connection Even More Legendary


## SUMMARY 



  The final issue of Marvel&#39;s Dark Droids crossover finds Luke Skywalker possessed by the Scourge, a viral artificial intelligence, becoming a living conduit between machine intelligence and the Force.   The Scourge needed someone with Luke&#39;s power to access, as it seeks to become the Force itself, once more indicating that Luke is the most powerful Force user in the galaxy.   Despite Luke&#39;s valiant efforts, he is not the hero of the story, as another character ultimately defeats the Scourge and saves the galaxy.

## Literature Review

The climax of Marvel&#39;s Star Wars: Dark Droids crossover series provided further proof that Luke Skywalker is the franchise&#39;s most powerful character.




Spoilers: Star Wars: Dark Droids #5Luke Skywalker is Star Wars&#39; greatest hero, and as traditionally presented in the Expanded Universe, one of the most powerful Jedi in history. The climax of Marvel&#39;s Dark Droids crossover event included a moment that makes Skywalker&#39;s strength in the Force even more legendary – while very nearly turning him into the galaxy&#39;s greatest villain, one that would destroy the Force itself.




Star Wars: Dark Droids #5 – written by Charles Soule, with art by Luke Ross, color by Alex Sinclair, and lettering by Travis Lanham – was the final issue of the crossover epic, which extended across the majority of Marvel&#39;s Star Wars titles, including Darth Vader and Doctor Aphra.

          

In his series, Vader&#39;s power struggle with the franchise&#39;s new villain, the viral artificial intelligence known as the Scourge, proved to be perhaps the crossover&#39;s most thrilling plot thread. However, the story&#39;s biggest moment came when Luke Skywalker was possessed by the Scourge, leading it to declare: &#34;I will be the new Force.&#34;


 The Scourge Needed A Force User Of Luke Skywalker&#39;s Power To Access The Force 
         




The Scourge&#39;s origins date back to the ancient galaxy, as a dark side cult called the Ascendent sought to artificially replicate the Force. The cult was eventually wiped out by the Sith for their herasy, but not before creating an AI known as the &#34;Spark Eternal.&#34; Thousands of years later, in the Original Trilogy era, the Spark would merge with another ancient AI, one of the Sith&#39;s creation, resulting in something new: the Scourge. Set between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, following the loss of his hand at Bespin, and the revelation of his connection to Darth Vader, Dark Droids finds Luke Skywalker at his most vulnerable, which proves pivotal to the story.

Ultimately, the Dark and Light Side users of the Force prove equally unable to defeat the Scourge. Rather than continue to fight against it, Darth Vader makes the shocking decision to join with it, in order to attempt to overthrow the Emperor. Luke Skywalker fights valiantly against overwhelming, seemingly insurmountable odds in Dark Droids #5, but at the story&#39;s climax, he is not the hero. Instead, he finds himself in a role unlike any before in the galaxy, as he is infected by the Scourge, becoming a living conduit between the Force and this artificial antagonist, which seeks to supplant it.






 Luke&#39;s Power Would Have Made The Scourge Truly Unstoppable 


          



After the Scourge declares, &#34;I will be the new Force,&#34; its main body is destroyed by sentient droid Ajax Sigma, wielding a sword that is able to trap the Scourge&#39;s consciousness, liberating the droid and organic beings alike under its thrall. &#34;No, you won&#39;t,&#34; Ajax declares, in one of the most triumphant moments for any droid in Star Wars history. Though it is against his will, Luke Skywalker&#39;s role as the Scourge&#39;s conduit for the Force, however briefly, is yet further proof that he is the greatest Force-user the galaxy has ever known, with a Force-connection unlike anyone, Jedi or Sith, that preceded him.

Much of Dark Droids was focused on the Scourge&#39;s attempts to gain control over organic beings, and to not only access, but become the Force itself. As soon as the Scourge encountered Luke Skywalker, it realized Luke was the being that it needed to overcome its weakness and become a truly insurmountable, near-omnipotent entity, &#34;the new Force.&#34; The Luke depicted in post-Return of the Jedi Legends-era continuity may have been able to overcome this threat himself, but pre-ROTJ was not, and this proved to be the crux of the story. While reserving the final act of heroism for someone else, Dark Droids once more confirmed Luke Skywalker is Star Wars&#39; most powerful character.
