# 10 Villains Who Know Batman s Secret Identity


## SUMMARY 


 Batman&#39;s secret identity isn&#39;t as secret as he thinks it is – many of his villains know that he is Bruce Wayne. 
 Some villains, like Hush and Two-Face, have personal connections to Bruce Wayne, making their knowledge of his secret identity even more dangerous. 
 Even Lex Luthor and Joker know Batman&#39;s true identity, but it doesn&#39;t really matter to them, as their focus is on Batman, not Bruce Wayne.

## Literature Review

Batman&#39;s is as vigilant about protecting his secret identity as he is about anything, but somehow, his worst villains keep finding out.




One of the most important elements of functioning as a superhero is for the hero to protect their secret identity – and Batman takes protecting him extremely seriously. That said, over his long history, a number of the Caped Crusaders&#39; villains have discovered who the man behind the mask really is, though some have done more with it than others.
A secret identity allows a hero&#39;s loved ones and allies to be able to live their lives without fear of retribution from the criminals the hero puts away, which is why it&#39;s all the more alarming that Batman&#39;s secret identity isn&#39;t actually all that secret. It turns out that plenty of villains, including some of his most dangerous antagonists, know exactly who Batman is, having learned it through some means or another during the hero&#39;s many years crusading against crime in Gotham City. With that in mind, below are the Top 10 villains who know that Batman is Bruce Wayne.
            
 
 The 25 Greatest Batman Villains Of All Time 
The owner of the greatest rogues&#39; gallery in comics, The Dark Knight has dealt with a rough crowd over the years. Here are the best Batman villains.












 








 10  Hush 
Bruce Wayne&#39;s Childhood Friend


 







One of the most dangerous enemies to ever learn of Batman&#39;s identity was Hush. The character first appeared in 2002&#39;s Batman #609, part of the Batman: Hush storyline, which featured Hush using Batman&#39;s villains to dismantle his life, a goal made easier by the fact Hush was told Batman&#39;s secret identity by a newly revived Jason Todd, who was also out for revenge. Hush was a major villain for Batman, and a lot of his power stemmed from the fact he didn&#39;t just know that Batman was Bruce Wayne, but he actually knew who Bruce Wayne was, on a completely personal level. This was a new dynamic, distinct from other Batman villains.
Batman #609 was written by Jeph Loeb, with art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Alex Sinclair, and Richard Starkings. 






 9  The Riddler 
Of Course He Figured It Out Eventually


 







The Riddler is an iconic Batman foil, one of the smartest rogues that Batman regularly battles against. One of the major things that holds Riddler back is his OCD, which requires him to leave clues and prevents him from fully focusing on things, but when Riddler used a Lazarus pit to cure a brain tumor, it also cured his OCD. This granted the Riddler the pure moment of clarity he needed to deduce once and for all that Batman is Bruce Wayne. This shocking revelation was recapped for readers in the finale of Batman: Hush. Riddler never really acted on the information he had, but the knowledge permanently altered his dynamic with Batman.





 8  Two-Face 
The Most Recent Gotham Villain To Learn Bruce&#39;s Secret

        

Two-Face is one of Batman&#39;s oldest villains and Bruce Wayne&#39;s former personal friend. Before he became a supervillain, Dent used to be Gotham City&#39;s District Attorney, helping put away many criminals. After his face was splashed with acid, Harvey lost his mind and became a recurring Batman villain. His relationship with the Caped Crusader was taken to a new level in Detective Comics #1068, where Two-Face finally learned Batman&#39;s secret identity. This was a major moment in their history, because Batman had originally intended to tell Harvey Dent his identity early in his career. Harvey becoming Two-Face prevented this, but Harvey would eventually go on to learn the secret anyway.
Detective Comics #1068 was written by Ram V, with art by Ivan Reis, and Rafael Albuquerque. It was released in 2023. 






 7  Bane 
He Couldn&#39;t Have Broken The Bat Without Targeting Bruce Wayne

        

Bane was the very first villain to seriously use the knowledge of Batman&#39;s secret identity to hurt him. First introduced in Batman: Vengeance of Bane, the vi;;ain would later re-appear in the iconic Knightfall story. After deducing Batman&#39;s identity, Bane ambushed and broke Batman in the Batcave. Ever since then, Bane has been an extremely dangerous enemy for Batman; not only is he Batman&#39;s physical superior, but he&#39;s also highly intelligent, and was one of the first to figure out who Batman truly was. No DC villain has used Bruce Wayne&#39;s identity against him to the extent Bane was able to, before or since.
Batman: Vengeance of Bane was written by Chuck Dixon, with art by Graham Nolan, Eduardo Barreto, Adrienne Roy, and Bill Oakley. It was published in 1992. 






 6  Ra&#39;s al Ghul 
Bruce Wayne Has A Lot To Learn From Ra&#39;s

        


Batman #335 was written by Marv Wolfman, with art by Irv Novick, Frank McLaughlin, Adrienne Roy, and Ben Oda. It was published in 1981. 

Ra&#39;s al Ghul commands the entire League of Assassins, a syndicate of highly trained assassins that spans the entire globe. Naturally, because of this, Ra&#39;s has easy access to tons of clandestine information. Before he even encountered Batman, Ra&#39;s learned his true identity in Batman #335. Some interpretations of the character have had Ra&#39;s al Ghul be Batman&#39;s teacher, such as in Chip Zdarsky&#39;s The Knight story. While this isn&#39;t usually the case between them, it goes to show that no matter what interpretation of the character, Ra&#39;s always knows who Batman truly is. Ra&#39;s has always wanted Batman to be his successor, and no secret identity would stop Ra&#39;s from trying to force Bruce into the role.





 5  Amanda Waller 
The Most Dangerous Person To Know Bruce&#39;s Secret

        

It&#39;s never been shown exactly how Amanda Waller uncovered that Batman is Bruce Wayne, but considering she&#39;s one of the highest-ranked government officials in the DC Universe, and runs a multitude of shadowy operations, it&#39;s not surprising. Amanda Waller is so familiar with Batman and his security that she once easily broke into the Batcave while Batman was gone, in order to retrieve some files she wanted, as readers witnessed in Batman (2016) #13. Amanda Waller is one of DC&#39;s best villains and part of this is the fact she never seems to lose. Regardless of whoever she&#39;s up against, she always has a plan or an ace up her sleeve.
Batman (Vol. 3) #13 was written by Tom King, with art by Mikel Janin, June Chung, and Clayton Cowles. It was released in 2017. 






 4  Hugo Strange 
Chronologically The First To Lift Batman&#39;s Mask

        

Hugo Strange was one of the first villains Batman ever went up against, first appearing in the 1940s. Over the years, Hugo consistently reappeared to do battle with Batman, but their relationship was forever changed in Detective Comics #471. In this story, Batman was bitten by a poisonous snake; seconds before the poison reached his heart, Batman took an antidote offered by Hugo Strange. While the antidote did cure Batman, it also knocked him unconscious just long enough for Hugo Strange to unmask him, revealing his true identity. This made Hugo Strange one of the first Batman villains to learn his identity, which became a significant problem for Batman in the future.
Detective Comics #471 was written by Steve Englehart, with art by Marshall Rogers, Terry Austin, and John Workman. It was released in 1977. 






 3  Lex Luthor 
Not Only Gotham&#39;s Villains Have Figured Out Batman = Bruce Wayne

        


Justice League (Vol. 2) #31 was written by by Geoff Johns, with art by Doug Mahnke, Keith Champagne, Christian Alamy, Rod Reis, and Dezi Sienty. It was published in 2014. 

Every comic fan is aware of the rivalry between Superman and Lex Luthor, but Lex has also had an on-and-off rivalry with Bruce Wayne. After the tragedy of No Man&#39;s Land, where Gotham was devastated by an earthquake, Batman was unable to prevent Lex Luthor from buying up all the destroyed land. This allowed Lex to get a foothold in Gotham, which Bruce has never been able to undo. This only became worse when Lex Luthor learned Batman&#39;s secret identity in Justice League #31. After Nightwing&#39;s identity was revealed in Forever Evil, Lex was able to quickly deduce who Batman was, and was even quicker to prove it.





 2  Joe Chill 
The Progenitor Of All Bruce Wayne&#39;s Issues


 







Joe Chill shot and killed Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents in a dark alleyway – since then, Joe Chill disappeared from Batman&#39;s life, and has almost never interacted with modern-day Batman. However, during the events of Justice League: Darkseid War – Batman #1, Batman became the God of Knowledge, granting him omniscience. With this newfound power, Batman immediately appeared before Joe Chill. In a fit of rage, Batman unmasked in front of Chill, so the man would understand that his petty robbery is what created Batman. While Batman did use his powers to remove the knowledge from Joe Chill, for just a moment, Joe Chill truly understood the weight of the shots he fired that night.
2015&#39;s Justice League: Darkseid War – Batman #1 was written by Peter J. Tomasi, with art by Fernando Pasarin, Matt Ryan, Gabe Eltaeb, and Dave Sharpe. 






 1  The Joker 
        

Batman (Vol. 3) #89 was written by James Tynion IV, with art by Carlo Pagulayan, Guillem March, Danny Miki, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. It was released in 2016. 

Given how chaotic and destructive the Joker is, most fans might assume it&#39;d be an apocalyptic scenario if he ever found out who Bruce Wayne truly is. This doesn&#39;t appear to be the case though. It has been made clear repeatedly that Joker knows Batman&#39;s true identity, but simply doesn&#39;t care. The Joker is interested in Batman, not Bruce Wayne. This has been touched on several times in Batman: Endgame, Batman: Death of the Family, and most recently in Batman #89. The only thing Joker wants to do is endlessly fight with Batman, so who is under the mask doesn&#39;t truly matter to Joker in the slightest.
