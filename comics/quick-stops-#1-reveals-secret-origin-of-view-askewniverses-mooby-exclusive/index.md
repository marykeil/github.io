## Literature Review

Screen Rant is excited to share an exclusive preview of Quick Stops Volume 2 #1, which reveals the secret origin of Mooby the Golden Calf.




Warning! Preview pages ahead for Quick Stops Volume 2 #1!The View Askewniverse has used his image through numerous movies and comics, but a new story is finally revealing the origin of Mooby the Golden Calf. In an exclusive preview, Screen Rant has a look at Quick Stops Volume 2 #1, which tells the story of Nancy Goldruff and her connection to the iconic mascot.




In a preview for Quick Stops Volume 2 #1 by Kevin Smith and Ahmed Raafat, a young woman named Kayla Kareem stops by the home of Nancy Goldruff, a former kindergarten teacher who created Mooby. As the host of the biggest Mooby podcast, Kareem has come to find out the truth behind Mooby&#39;s creation.

         

Goldruff tells a story about an incident in 1989 when she was still teaching. Goldruff discovers a young boy named K.P. is being bullied by an eighth grader who has told the rest of the school to call K.P. &#39;moobies&#39;. Goldruff comforts K.P., aware that the incident is going to haunt him for his entire life.


 View Askewniverse&#39;s Mooby Was Inspired by an Insult 
          




Mooby was first seen in Kevin Smith&#39;s Dogma and was a tongue-in-cheek reference to the biblical story of the golden calf. Mooby is a mascot for the in-universe fast food chain Mooby&#39;s, a restaurant that also served as the setting for Clerks II. The character is meant to be an amalgamation of characters such as Ronald McDonald, Barney the Dinosaur and Mickey Mouse. In the View Askewniverse, Mooby is outrageously popular and has been the star of films and television specials and has two theme parks on the Eastern and Western coasts of the United States.

Quick Stops was co-created by View Askewniverse creator Kevin Smith to shed light on his world and the history of his characters. Among other things, the series&#39; previous volume revealed the origins of mischievous stoners Jay and Silent Bob&#39; superhero alter egos, Bluntman and Chronic. Dogma does briefly touch on Mooby&#39;s origin in a scene where the angel Bartleby mentions that Goldruff created Mooby before being bought by a conglomerate. But Quick Stops is delving more into her history and revealing that there are still plenty of stories to be told in the View Askewniverse.






 Quick Stops Answers Questions About Kevin Smith&#39;s World 
          

Even the most devoted Kevin Smith fans may not have put too much thought into where Mooby the Golden Calf came from. But many View Askewniverse films focused on the humor and absurdity that came with everyday life. The idea that such a prominent character like Mooby can have his origins traced back to a schoolyard insult fits the style and tone of Kevin Smith&#39;s movies. While Smith doesn&#39;t focus as much on his connected universe as he once did, his return to the world in Quick Stops Volume 2 #1 hints that there are still worthy stories hiding in the View Askewniverse.

Quick Stops Volume 2 #1 is on sale December 13th from Dark Horse Comics.
