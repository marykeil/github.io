# Fantastic Four This Early Multiverse Story Is the Perfect Way to Bring Marvel s First Family Into the MCU (Without Doing an Origin Story)


## SUMMARY 



  The Fantastic Four could be introduced into the MCU through this early reality-hopping story, providing a seamless way for them to join as fully-realized heroes without the need for an origin story.   Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four were pioneers of the company&#39;s early Multiverse stories, with their early adventures paving the way for the expansive storytelling that defines Marvel today.   Adapting Fantastic Four (Volume 1) #161-163 would not only open new storytelling vectors for the MCU by exploring other dimensions, but it would also build upon Reed Richards&#39; cameo in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness.

## Literature Review

A 1970s Fantastic Four arc, featuring one of Marvel&#39;s earliest multiverse adventures, would be a seamless way to bring the team into the MCU.




Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four are known as &#34;Marvel&#39;s First Family&#34; – and appropriately, they were the earliest to explore the Multiverse and deal with threats from alternate realities. The Four&#39;s entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been long overdue, and with the Multiverse taking central stage in the company&#39;s on-screen ongoing narrative, one of the team&#39;s earliest reality-hopping story could prove to be the perfect way to bring them into the MCU.




Fantastic Four (Vol. 1) #161 – written by Roy Thomas, with art by Rich Buckler – was release in 1975. A follow-up to a story from a decade earlier, which featured the Human Torch visiting a parallel dimension, this issue revisited the world from that issue, but added another wrinkle: the parallel dimension was under attack by Earth, but not the Fantastic Four&#39;s Earth. Rather, it was an Earth from an alternate timeline.



          

With a few tweaks, this story could be adapted to suit the team&#39;s introduction into the MCU. What&#39;s more, it would enable them to join the Cinematic Universe as fully-realized heroes, dispensing with the need for an origin story.

 The Fantastic Four Were Marvel&#39;s Multiversal Pioneers 
         




The concept of the Multiverse that has come to define Marvel storytelling in many ways, on the page and on screen, was formally introduced in 1976&#39;s What If...? #1, which featured the story, &#34;What If Spider-Man Joined The Fantastic Four?&#34; Just over a year earlier, the Four went on Marvel&#39;s earliest Multiversal adventure, in a three-issue arc which tied together several earlier solo adventures the Human Torch and Thing had taken through spacetime. The idea of a &#34;Multiverse&#34; doesn&#39;t appear in the story, given that the Fantastic Four only deal with a single alternate timeline – however, it shows the idea was percolating at Marvel, as What If...? would debut just over a year-and-a-half later.



Writer of Fantastic Four (Vol. 1) #161-163, Roy Thomas, also wrote What If...? #1, where he was responsible for explicitly introducing the Multiverse to Marvel readers.




Adapting this story for the Fantastic Four MCU movie would accomplish several things. Exploring other dimensions, and the potential threats contained therein, would bring a new storytelling vector to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has already done great things narratively with high-concept ideas, including time travel, and the Multiverse itself. More critically, it would offer a mechanism through which the Four could seamlessly integrate into the MCU. The movie could find the team helping protect a parallel dimension from a threat by a different Earth than their own. The climax could trap them on that alternate Earth – and in patented Marvel fashion, a mid-or-post-credits scene could reveal that Earth to be the MCU.






The Thing&#39;s 1979 time travel adventure from Marvel Two-In-One #50 was later retconned in 1983&#39;s Marvel Two-In-One #100 as another example of the team&#39;s early brushes with alternate continuities.






 Adapting This FF Story Would Build On Reed Richards&#39; &#34;Strange&#34; Cameo 
          

Bringing the Fantastic Four into the MCU from an alternate timeline would build upon Mr. Fantastic&#39;s appearance in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, while explaining their absence from the MCU up to this point – without having to retell their origin story on screen once more. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has already made it clear that versions of the Fantastic Four exist within its Multiverse; Fantastic Four (Vol. 1) #161-163 provides a blueprint for bringing the team into the MCU in a meaningful way, one that would allow them to make an immediate impact, while also nodding to the rich history of the team, something Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four deserves as the company&#39;s &#34;First Family.&#34;
