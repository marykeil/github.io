## Literature Review

Daredevil is one of Marvel&#39;s most powerful street-level heroes, but he has a weakness that is so common it&#39;s surprising he can function at all.




Because of his unique extrasensory powers, Daredevil is able to take on almost any street-level threat that comes his way, which is surprising considering how common Daredevil&#39;s biggest weakness is. This weakness is so bad that Daredevil himself admits it cuts his power&#39;s effectiveness by 95 percent.




Matt ends up revealing his biggest weakness during a fight with the villain Ikari in 2013&#39;s Daredevil #25 by Mark Waid, Chris Samnee, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Caramagna. Ikari possesses the same powers as Daredevil, who quickly finds himself outmatched as he is not used to fighting people with his exact same abilities. To even the playing field, he lures Ikari into a sporting goods store.



          

This location is filled with tons of shapes and objects, which Daredevil hopes will overwhelm Ikari&#39;s senses. When that plan fails, Daredevil activates the sprinkler system. The sound of the water muffles his hearing and the falling water blocks his echolocation, making it extremely debilitating.

 Daredevil Revealed His Greatest Weakness In Order to Trap His Foe 


          

When Matt Murdock lost his sight as a young boy saving an old blind man from being hit by a car, his other senses became significantly stronger. Thanks to the radioactive isotope that took his vision, his hearing and sense of smell vastly increased. Not only that, but Matt also gained a form of echolocation that allows him to &#34;see&#34; 360 degrees around him at all times. These tremendous powers led to Matt becoming a superhero, but they also have weaknesses that villains have tried to exploit in the past.

The surprisingly simple weakness to Daredevil&#39;s power was revealed to be rain by Daredevil himself. After luring Ikari into the sporting goods store and setting off the sprinkler system, Daredevil admits that heavy rain reduces his powers by as much as 95 percent. He reflects that his sense of smell is negated and his hearing is nullified, leaving only his radar senses. Even that, he says, is &#34;practically useless in the rain.&#34; Since Ikari has the same powers, Matt is hoping he&#39;d share the same weakness. Unfortunately, he&#39;s underestimated Ikari&#39;s abilities. It turns out, Ikari is not actually blind, and is able to mercilessly beat Daredevil into submission.






 Daredevil Is Severely Debilitated By Rain 


          

Daredevil&#39;s powers make him an almost untouchable fighter, capable of seeing 360 degrees around him and responding to any threat with superhuman reflexes. This is why he&#39;s one of Marvel&#39;s strongest street-level heroes, which is a miracle considering just how common his biggest weakness is. Any form of heavy rain or sprinkler systems would be enough to completely throw Daredevil off his game. While enemies have tried in the past to defeat Daredevil using overpowering noise or other attacks on his senses, it&#39;s a good thing no villain has ever thought of using Daredevil&#39;s biggest weakness: a sprinkler system.



Daredevil #25 is available now from Marvel Comics!
