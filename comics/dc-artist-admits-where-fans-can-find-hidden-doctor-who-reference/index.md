## Literature Review

DC artist Bruno Redondo pulls back the curtain and reveals the stealthy Doctor Who homage hidden within the panels of the fan-loved Injustice series.




Acclaimed DC artist Bruno Redondo peels back the layers of the Injustice comic series, unveiling a hidden Doctor Who gem. The brilliance of this reference lies in its subtlety which will undoubtedly leave fans both cheering at the nod to the Doctor Who series and surprised by what they might have initially overlooked.




In a candid revelation on X (formerly known as Twitter), Redondo confirmed a Doctor Who Easter egg embedded within the pages of Injustice: Gods Among Us Year Three Vol. 1 #1. Collaborating with Tom Taylor and Mike Miller on this particular comic, Redondo artfully rendered the Tower of Fate to mirror a scene in Doctor Who, where the TARDIS hurtles through the Time Vortex. 


 

This homage showcases Redondo&#39;s cleverness and love for the DC and Doctor Who fandoms. Whether fans stumbled upon the reference independently or are just now discovering it, they are bound to appreciate this ingenious nod to the beloved British sci-fi series.

In his post, Redondo shared side-by-side comparisons of the Tower of Fate panel in Injustice and the specific frame from Doctor Who&#39;s opening sequence that served as its blueprint. He also expressed his astonishment at the surprisingly low number of fans who caught the reference. With a touch of humility, the artist openly admitted that, perhaps, he had erred on the side of subtlety with this particular homage. However, now that he has shed light on the reference, the comic&#39;s understated tribute to the TARDIS is poised to elicit appreciation from devoted Whovians.

Redondo&#39;s ability to seamlessly intertwine the worlds of DC Comics and the time-traveling adventures of the Doctor underscores the depth of thought and effort he invests in every panel, a testament to his dedication to the craft. What truly sets Redondo apart is his unwavering commitment to infuse even the less spotlighted panels, such as the featured Tower of Fate, with nuanced details, showcasing a level of craftsmanship that resonates with fans. This talented artist&#39;s work assures enthusiasts that their cherished narratives are in the hands of a true storyteller who is able to weave visuals that go beyond the first glance.
