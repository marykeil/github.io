Ushering in a new epoch of African dark fantasy on the ancient continent of Alkebulan, the mythic cycle of cosmic destiny and unrelenting warfare pits man against god...and blade against blade! Steady your mind and spirit for a glorious new comics milestone revealing the fabled origin and battle-tested fury of ...AKOGUN: BRUTALIZER OF GODS.







 Akogun Creators Re-EnvisionTraditional Storytelling with an African Lens 
         

Oni Press President and Publisher, Hunter Gorinson says, &#34;Every generation of so, a new opportunity presents itself to shatter, and then slowly rebuild, the foundations of the mythic genre tropes that we hold dear and, in doing so, to make them stronger than ever before. What Murewa and Dotun are creating with AKOGUN is one of those rare, special moments. For the first time, two Nigerian creators are recasting the distinctly Westernized mode of no-holds-barred barbarian-driven sword and sorcery storytelling through a distinctly African lens - capturing an entirely new pantheon of gods and monsters in the process.&#34;

Series writer Murewa Ayodele adds:


According to Yoruba mythology, we were all made by a drunk god, and during one of his drunken stupor, he also made horrific monsters. The first of the gods to visit this new, twisted world was the erratic god of war. When we discovered this little bit of our culture&#39;s mythology, we knew we wanted to tell a gritty fantastical story set in this primordial African world - a world of barbarous violence, monstrous creatures, and gods who give in to primal, destructive urges.
AKOGUN: BRUTALIZER OF GODS is the story of a young warrior who happened to have found a little happiness in this dangerous world of ours. But when the gods took that happiness from him, they find out what a man who has nothing else to lose is truly capable of. Dotun and I are having loads of fun telling this adrenaline-filled tale. And with Dotun&#39;s phenomenal artwork, the emotions from the pages drag you in. We are positive everyone who picks up the book is going to have fun with it too.





The artist of Akogun: Brutalizer of Gods, Dotun Akande says, &#34;I can&#39;t wait for fans of the medium to have this book in their hands. It&#39;s dark fantasy from dark fantasy lovers. It is African folklore like never seen or heard before. Murewa, a true cartographer, has mapped out an exciting journey full of twists and character. It&#39;s been a joy co-directing and giving life to it. So, grab your pitchforks and torches. You&#39;ll need it for this monster of a tale.&#34;

Akogun: Brutalizer of Gods #1 will be available on April 3 from Oni Press.
