## Literature Review

One of the major moments in Matt Murdock&#39;s history was him dealing with his secret identity being leaked, and how he eventually confirmed it in court.




In order to combat an evil organization, Matt Murdock had to prove he was Daredevil in court. A major moment for Matt was when his secret identity was leaked to the press – this resulted in his life being turned upside down for years as people hounded him over his secret identity, eventually leading to the moment that he had to legally embrace being the Man Without Fear.




Daredevil (Vol. 3) #35 – written by Mark Waid, with art by Chris Samnee, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Caramagna – found Matt Murdock forced to prove he was Daredevil once and for all, after yeats of fighting hard to keep his identity secret.



          



In the issue, a white supremacist group known as the Sons of the Serpent tried to force Matt to represent one of their members in court, by blackmailing him with hard evidence of his identity. In order to get out from under this, Matt simply decided to undo years of work and confirm his role as Daredevil in court.

                  Daredevil is So Scary He Doesn&#39;t Even Need a Secret Identity   A secret identity is a crucial part of the job for most superheroes, but Daredevil has proven he&#39;s so scary he doesn&#39;t need to hide from anyone.   





 Matt Murdock Refused To Be Blackmailed 


          

While some characters – such as Captain America and Iron Man – can forgo having a secret identity, other characters, including Daredevil and Spider-Man, have always come out worse when theirs is discovered. Spider-Man&#39;s life was famously destroyed when he revealed his identity, and Matt Murdock almost suffered the same fate when his was revealed. Matt was able to mostly bully through any accusations due to the fact he is legally, and very obviously, blind. His life was hell for a while, but he was able to get through it, until one situation forced him to finally prove who he was.

Matt had to legally reveal his secret identity as Daredevil in order to thwart the Sons of the Serpent, a racist white supremacist group who wanted to force him to represent one of their members. Naturally, Matt wanted absolutely nothing to do with this, but Sons of the Serpent had extremely detailed files on his life. Not just as Matt Murdock, but as Daredevil as well. The Sons of the Serpent threatened to release all of this data if Matt didn&#39;t meet their demands. Instead, Matt decided to take their power away from them. Rather than live in fear of their blackmail, Matt admitted in a court of law that he is Daredevil.




          

Matt had to reveal his secret identity to remove the power the Sons of the Serpent had over him, especially because they were threatening his life-long best friend Foggy Nelson. Rather than try to bully his way through this situation as he had in the past, Matt figured too many people who couldn&#39;t be fooled truly knew who he was, meaning the only option was to embrace it, revealing his identity to the world once and for all. This allowed Matt Murdock to get out from under the Sons blackmail, and also allowed him to start over as Daredevil in a different city.



Daredevil (Vol. 3) #35 was published in 2014. It is available now from Marvel Comics.
