## Literature Review

In most Peanuts comic strips, Snoopy is usually calm and collected, but the normally laid-back beagle does not always maintain his cool demeanor.




Snoopy is one likable pup who is almost always laid back and cool about the Peanuts world around him. Yet, there are still times when the beagle loses his cool, either by getting angry, panicked, scared, or offended. As many times as Snoopy has not been the nicest dog to Charlie Brown, he has surprisingly lost his cool with a number of the Peanuts gang.
Lucy, who offends everyone, is not all that surprising to be one on Snoopy&#39;s bad side occasionally. However, even pals like Woodstock aren&#39;t safe from Snoopy&#39;s temper once it is out of the bag. As much as Snoopy sticks up for Woodstock, that sassiness sometimes unfolds on his closest friend. And those aren&#39;t the only times that Snoopy has behaved the opposite of how Joe Cool would act.
            
 
 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Snoopy 
Snoopy has become a cultural icon over the years, thanks to his adventures in Charles Schulz&#39;s Peanuts. Here are ten of his funniest outings.












 








 10  Icicles Make Snoopy&#39;s Cool Facade Melt 
Published in 1960
        

Snoopy isn&#39;t typically an anxious dog. However, he has his triggers that make him absolutely terrified. One of his biggest fears is icicles hanging over his doghouse.
Snoopy&#39;s usually cool demeanor melts away when he is confronted by the icicles hanging over his abode. He becomes very frightened to the point that he refuses to come out of his doghouse. His fear gets the better of him as he contemplates staying cooped up in his doghouse forever. Fortunately for Snoopy, those icicles won&#39;t last through the end of winter.





 9  Linus&#39; Joke Gets Under Snoopy&#39;s Skin 
Published in 1973
        

Linus has not had the smoothest relationship with Snoopy due to the pup constantly trying to take away his beloved blanket. Yet, he finds it within himself to put their occasional tiffs aside to joke around with Snoopy, or try to at least.
After Linus makes a lame joke when he sees Snoopy with a fishing pole, he laughs hysterically. Snoopy, on the other hand, is not amused. In fact, he gets very annoyed by the joke. Usually, things can roll right off of Snoopy, insults or lame jokes alike. However, for whatever reason, Snoopy is not having Linus&#39; &#34;fishing for compliments&#34; joke.





 8  Rejection Slip Shock Has A Bad Effect On Snoopy 
Published in 1969
        

Snoopy is the epitome of jack of all trades, master of none. He slaps a &#34;World-Famous&#34; qualifier in front of many of his personas, such as his World-Famous Attorney persona and his World-Famous Tennis Player persona. However, he rarely lives up to the name.
As his World-Famous Author persona, Snoopy has gotten too many rejection letters to count about his work. In this strip, yet another rejection slip is too much for Snoopy to handle, and he loses it. He is in a state of shock, unable to do anything or speak. It isn&#39;t until Lucy&#39;s psychiatric help that he snaps back to normal.





 7  Lucy Freaks Out Over Snoopy&#39;s Kiss 
Published in 1958
        

Lucy is not the most subtle or diplomatic. She rarely thinks before talking, which can often result in someone getting insulted or getting their feelings hurt. In this strip, she tries to get a kiss from Schroeder, but gets more than she bargained for when Snoopy kisses her instead.
Lucy, as expected, runs away in horror, screaming about Snoopy&#39;s dog germs and disease. Snoopy, very understandably, gets incredibly insulted by Lucy. He even says that it is the most insulted he has ever been, which says a lot given he&#39;s been called &#34;stupid beagle&#34; multiple times.





 6  Snoopy Goes After Linus 
Published in 1964
        

As bad as the Peanuts gang&#39;s baseball team is, Linus still cares deeply abut his bat. That&#39;s why when he sees his bat all messed up from what look like teeth marks, he loses his temper with poor Snoopy. To make matters worse, Lucy comes clean that the marks on the bat are not teeth marks but instead from herself hitting rocks.
Understandably, Snoopy is very angry about being called guilty when, in reality, he is anything but. As a result, Snoopy comes after Linus, looking like he wants to bite Linus instead of his bat.





 5  Don&#39;t Call Snoopy &#34;Banana Nose&#34; 
Published in 1973
        

Friends, even pals as close as Woodstock and Snoopy, can have their disagreements. There is especially likely to be some tension if money or property is somehow involved, much like this case between the two best friends.
When Woodstock sends Snoopy a bill for stuff Snoopy broke at New Years (what a party animal!), the bird lobbies the insult of &#34;Banana Nose&#34; at Snoopy. Highly offended, Snoopy makes his feelings known by smashing the bill in Woodstock&#39;s face. As deep as a bond as the two have, it doesn&#39;t stop Snoopy&#39;s temper from rearing its head from time to time.





 4  Snoopy And Woodstock Duke It Out Over A Mustache 
Published in 1976
        

Snoopy and Woodstock have an unbreakable bond. They are immensely loyal to each other and are always willing to go to bat for their friend. That doesn&#39;t mean that they are immune to arguments every now and then.
After Snoopy lends Woodstock his disguise mustache so that he can avoid getting eaten on Thanksgiving, the sassy beagle demands he get it back. Woodstock is not too keen on returning the mustache, causing the two to argue until they snap the mustache in two. Snoopy, who is usually very calm and understanding with his pal, is extremely mad at Woodstock. Now, they each only have half of a mustache, which doesn&#39;t amount to much of a disguise.





 3  The Flying Ace Battles The Red Baron 
Published in 1966

        

Fans of Snoopy are well aware that the imaginative beagle has a staunch rivalry with the Red Baron. The wartime villain may be imaginary, but that doesn&#39;t make Snoopy despise him any less. With a hatred towards the Red Baron as strong as Snoopy holds, it makes sense that it could rile Snoopy up so much that he loses his cool.
When he is enmeshed in an (imaginary) battle with the Red Baron, he is on high alert, as shown in this strip. Consequently, when he gets hit with an innocent snowball by one of the Peanuts kids, Snoopy attributes the sneak attack to his nemesis.





 2  Snoopy Is Not Happy With Lucy&#39;s Psychiatry Services 
Published in 1968
        

Lucy sees many clients at her psychiatry booth, but that does not mean that all customers leave satisfied. Some, like Snoopy, leave downright irate. When Lucy withholds Snoopy&#39;s supper because he has not paid her for her psychiatry services, he is extremely annoyed.
Snoopy brainstorms some courses of action that he could take, like alerting the AMA to revoke Lucy&#39;s nonexistent license. As a result, he becomes so frustrated that he kicks Lucy&#39;s booth, making both of them furious. It&#39;s not too often that Snoopy is seen to be so angry, but for the few times that it does happen, it usually involves his food.





 1  Charlie Brown Dares to Feed Snoopy Cat Food 
Published in 1968
        

Snoopy has a list of his dislikes: the Red Baron, lack of supper, coconut candy, and most importantly, cats or anything related to cats. Cat food can even drive Snoopy up the wall. In this strip, when Snoopy is furious that Charlie Brown dare give him cat food, he throws his supper dish over the hedge.
Realizing his dire mistake, Snoopy panics and comes to Charlie for some emotional support. It is rare to see Snoopy break his cool facade. However, in this strip, he not only breaks his typically happy demeanor because of anger but also because of panic and worry. The emotional roller coaster that Snoopy goes on guarantees that the Peanuts beagle will not soon forget this mistake.
