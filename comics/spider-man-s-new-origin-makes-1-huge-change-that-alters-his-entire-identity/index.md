Warning: Contains spoilers for Ultimate Spider-Man (2024) #1 




Over the years, Peter Parker has questioned whether fate or happenstance placed him in the path of the radioactive spider that made him the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Now, as a new Ultimate Marvel universe begins, readers are treated to a radically altered version of the Spider-Man origin story. This world presents a daring, fresh take on Spider-Man, introducing a version of Peter that chooses to be bitten.

Ultimate Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #1 –  by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checchetto, Matthew Wilson, and Cory Petit – begins Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate imprint in earnest, after kicking it off with Ultimate Invasion. This new take on the Webslinger presents a world in which an adult Peter Parker, married to Mary Jane Watson with two children, has not yet become Spider-Man.

          




The issue opens with a flashback, in which a hologram of Tony Stark presents Peter with the information that he was supposed to be bitten by a radioactive spider 20 years prior. Tony then leaves Peter with the spider and a suit. One night later, Peter allows the radioactive spider to bite him.

                  The New Ultimates: Marvel&#39;s Heroes Assemble in New Ultimate Universe Team   Marvel Comics has set the stage for its all new Ultimate Universe continuity, and that storyline will get a new chapter on Free Comic Book Day 2024!    


 The New Ultimate Peter Parker Chooses To Be Spider-Man, In A Shocking Turn 
          

With the four-issue miniseries Ultimate Invasion, and follow-up one-shot Ultimate Universe, writer Jonathan Hickman launched Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate universe (Earth-6160). Like Marvel&#39;s original Ultimate universe (Earth-1610), this parallel world has a new history and continuity where Marvel can present alternate, modern versions of its characters. Earth-6160 was created by the Maker – Earth-1610&#39;s evil Reed Richards – after he escaped from Marvel&#39;s primary world, Earth-616. HThe Maker prevented the origins of certain heroes and villains, thus positioning himself as a ruler of the new world. At the conclusion of Ultimate Invasion, a fight with Howard Stark&#39;s Iron Man, Kang, and other rebels left the Maker sealed off from the rest of the world.




Now, Tony Stark and a team of fellow heroes seek to empower those whose rise the Maker prevented, starting with an adult Peter Parker. Stark sends a hologram to Peter from six months in the future, informing him that he is meant to have &#34;amazing powers&#34; and be one of the Earth&#39;s biggest superheroes. Tony tells Peter about the heroic deeds Spider-Man would accomplish that have been kept from him: &#34;These people stole your future. These people robbed you of your destiny. The question is... do you want it back?&#34; In a major twist on the Spider-Man formula, Peter accepts the spider bite, gaining his powers and donning his costume.



 Spider-Man&#39;s New Origin Recontextualizes His Entire Character 
          

Ultimate Spider-Man #1 presents readers with a Peter Parker they have never seen before. He is happily married with two children and a steady job. As such, the spider presents an interesting dilemma. On the one hand, Tony&#39;s message confirms his belief that his life is missing something; on the other, becoming Spider-Man will affect more people than himself. It is a mid-life crisis of superheroic proportions. This makes the final pages all the more satisfying and intriguing. Rather than being a victim of fate, Peter actively chooses to get bitten, taking on the great power himself — and the great responsibility that comes with it.




This updated origin has fascinating ramifications for Spider-Man as a character. Though Tony&#39;s message is certainly a call to action, Peter is no longer the same victim of fate he has been. This makes his origin arguably more heroic, but it could also make his career more tragic. Peter Parker is considered one of the guiltiest superheroes of all time, and now he&#39;s actively chosen a life of danger. How will he react if a loved one gets hurt knowing that he brought this on himself? Ultimate Peter has chosen to become Spider-Man on his own; now, he must hope the dreaded Parker luck doesn&#39;t make him regret this decision.

Ultimate Spider-Man #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
