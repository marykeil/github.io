## Literature Review

Revenge manhwa offer readers the unique satisfaction of seeing the most despicable characters get what they deserve and these series do it best.




Be it petty or violent, revenge stories have always been popular and these manhwa execute the revenge trope to perfection. With a knack for creating some of the most disliked antagonists in popular media, revenge manhwa offer readers the unique satisfaction of seeing these despicable characters finally get what they deserve. In fact, it is this catharsis that has led to the popularity of the trope and the stories that make use of it.
More importantly, revenge stories usually give rise to more complex, morally gray characters that in turn add depth to the plot overall. While readers may not always be able to rationalize a character&#39;s actions in pursuit of revenge, as long as there is a justifiable motive, readers can unwittingly find themselves relating to even the most manipulative characters, even living vicariously through them in a way, which is why many other manhwa have begun to also make use of the trope.
