# Batwoman Admits She No Longer Sees Batman as a Hero - &amp; Won t Work with Him


## SUMMARY

She is joining a new team called the Outsiders, led by Luke Fox, dedicated to the discovery and cataloging of unknown history and knowledge.   Batwoman&#39;s decision to leave the Bat-Family is motivated by her desire to do good in the world without enabling Batman&#39;s destructive behaviors.

## Literature Review

Batwoman may be Batman’s family, but after the events of “Gotham War”, Kate Kane is swearing off working with the Dark Knight and moving on.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Outsiders #1!After everything Batman has done, Batwoman is swearing off the hero for good. The Dark Knight pushed his closest allies away during the dramatic events of &#34;Gotham War&#34;. Now his blood relative is calling it quits and leaving the Bat-Family for bigger and better opportunities in the DC Universe.




In Outsiders #1 by Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelley, and Robert Carrey, Batwoman, aka Kate Kane, is in Gotham and still reeling from the events of &#34;Gotham War&#34;. After being approached by Luke Fox, Kate unloads on him, saying she&#39;s tired of watching the city fall apart year after year and is sick of traditional superheroism.

          

Luke agrees with Kate and tells her that he&#39;s putting together a new version of the Outsiders, reinventing them as a team dedicated to the discovery and cataloging of unknown history and knowledge. After a brief moment of consideration, Batwoman agrees but only on one condition: That this new endeavor has nothing to do with Batman.


 Batwoman is Breaking Off Her Association with Batman 
          




Batwoman is Batman&#39;s cousin, but before she knew of her relative&#39;s biggest secret, she was inspired to become a hero by Bruce Wayne&#39;s alter ego. After being forced to leave the United States Military Academy, Kate went home to Gotham where she became directionless and reckless. However, a chance encounter with Batman inspired Kate to become a vigilante as well. With her father&#39;s help, Kate became Batwoman and created an independent operation. Though she and Batman didn&#39;t officially work together in the beginning, repeated missions together eventually earned Batwoman a place in the Bat-Family alongside other Gotham heroes.

Unfortunately, it looks like Batman&#39;s recent actions have really changed how Batwoman perceives him. The recent &#34;Gotham War&#34; crossover saw Batman become more unhinged than ever. Granted, he was being spurred on by his sinister alter ego, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, but Bruce really hurt his family. Not only did Batman push his allies away, he nearly exposed Nightwing and the two Robins identities on purpose. And that&#39;s not even getting into Bruce reconditioning Red Hood to feel intense fear to forcefully retire Jason from crime-fighting. Batman violated much of the Bat-Family&#39;s trust, and while some members like Nightwing want to try and help Bruce, Kate has simply had enough.






 Batwoman is Leaving the Bat-Family for the Outsiders 
          

While Batwoman wasn&#39;t a part of the Bat-Family as long as Nightwing or Robin, she&#39;s been a valuable ally. But Kate just can&#39;t sit by and watch Batman self-destruct anymore, especially when he winds up harming the city he and Kate are fighting so hard to protect. Batman may have inspired Batwoman to become a hero, but right now he&#39;s far from the crusader that Kate idolized so long ago. Batwoman wants to do good in the world, but as long as she&#39;s part of the Bat-Family, she&#39;s only enabling Bruce&#39;s worst behaviors. Hopefully, Batwoman finds the meaning she&#39;s no longer able to find working with Batman.

Outsiders #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
