## Literature Review

Superman may be strong, but this Titan hero just pulled off a strength feat that the Last Son of Krypton could only dream of matching one day.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans: Beast World #4!In DC&#39;s most recent crisis event, Beast World, the part-time Titan Swamp Thing is called to help avert further mass casualties, accomplishing a feat that not even Superman and his family of supers could have achieved. This demonstration of unparalleled and unique power highlights what an extraordinary addition Levi Kamei makes to the Titans.




Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer’s Titans: Beast World #4 continues to follow the events of DC’s animal-themed crisis event. Where heroes, villains, and civilians alike get transformed against their will via Beast Boy’s Garro spores into violent, uncontrollable animal hybrids.

          

Among the victims is Giganta, a classic Wonder Woman villain, who gets transformed into a colossal bear, unleashing havoc upon Ivy Town. Swamp Thing emerges as one of the heroes who responds to the quickly worsening situation. It&#39;s here in Ivy Town that he demonstrates an unparalleled feat of strength by single-handedly preventing dozens of skyscrapers from collapsing, something that no other hero could have accomplished.


 Swamp Thing Single-Handedly Prevents Dozens of Skyscrapers From Collapsing 


          




In the brief period it took the Titans to respond to Ivy Town, Giganta, in her giant bear form, has already triggered a mass casualty event, inflicting irreparable damage to the city. Determined to prevent further loss of life, Nightwing issues directives, including one tasking Swamp Thing with reinforcing buildings on the verge of collapse. This particular order would be insurmountable for any hero except Levi. Harnessing the power of The Green, Swamp Thing fortifies dozens of skyscrapers with plant life, preventing their collapse. This unparalleled feat of strength underscores his exceptional and unique skill set, showcasing the invaluable contributions he brings to the Titans.

Levi&#39;s unique abilities prove indispensable in a crisis like this, surpassing the capabilities of even Superman. While the Man of Steel might have been able to support one building temporarily, maintaining its stability after stepping away would have posed a challenge. Creative solutions, such as using his ice breath to reinforce the structures, could have been time-consuming and carried the risk of making foundations more brittle. Levi&#39;s seamless execution in reinforcing multiple skyscrapers demonstrates that no other hero could have accomplished this feat as efficiently and effectively as him. It also speaks towards his immense strength to be able to hold up multiple skyscrapers on his own.






 Swamp Thing is a Great Addition to the Titans 
          

Swamp Thing&#39;s unexpected entry into the Titans proves to be a brilliant move by Tom Taylor. The decision not only introduces a fresh character into the well-established team but also brings a hero with an exceptionally unique skill set, setting him apart not only among the Titans but within the broader DC Universe. Initially, there was uncertainty about how Levi would fit into the team dynamic and whether he would be a sporadically appearing, throwaway character. However, this exceptional issue dispels those doubts, indicating that Swamp Thing is poised to receive ample page-time, a deserving spotlight for such an iconic character.
