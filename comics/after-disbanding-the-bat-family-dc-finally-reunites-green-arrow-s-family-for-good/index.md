## Literature Review

As the DC Universe&#39;s Bat-Family begins to crumble, Green Arrow and his family are now doing better than ever before after being reunited.





Summary

  Green Arrow has finally reunited with his family, including Black Canary, Connor Hawke, and Lian Harper, showing his progress as a better family man.   In contrast, Batman has isolated himself and disbanded the Bat-Family, spiraling further into darkness.   The differences in how Green Arrow and Batman treat their families highlight their opposite paths, with Green Arrow thriving while Batman continues to push his loved ones away.  







As Batman rejects his family and moves out on his own, Green Arrow&#39;s family is doing better than ever. With Batman now completely alone after the events of Gotham War, it&#39;s Oliver who&#39;s found his family and is doing everything in his power to bring them back together. While Batman and Green Arrow have often copied one another, they couldn&#39;t be on more opposite paths right now.

After the events of Dark Crisis, Ollie has been lost in space and time. Every time he got closer to being reunited with his family, he was instantly teleported elsewhere. Eventually, Ollie overcame this, and he has literally crossed both space and time to return to his family, as seen in Green Arrow #6 by Joshua Williamson, Sean Izaakse, and Phil Hester. i



          

Ollie is finally reunited with his beloved Black Canary — as well as Connor Hawke and Lian Harper. With a few exceptions — like Roy Harper, as explored in the &#34;epilogue&#34; of this issue — the Arrow Family has finally been made whole. The same cannot be said for Batman and his family. In a darker place than ever before, Batman has isolated himself and disbanded the Bat-Family.




                  Green Arrow&#39;s Family Unites In Amazing Art For New Series   The cover of Green Arrow #1 by Sean Izaakse and colored by Romulo Fajardo Jr brings Oliver Queen and his cast of allies and antagonists together.   


 Green Arrow&#39;s Family Is Reunited At Last 
          

Green Arrow hasn&#39;t always been the best family man. He abandoned his son Connor — and then pretended he wasn&#39;t even aware that he had a son when Connor later tracked him down. He also cheated on the love of his life, Dinah Lance. All of these things haven&#39;t exactly made Ollie the best family man, but there&#39;s no denying the fact that he truly does love his family and everyone in it, especially as that family grew to include the likes of Roy Harper, Roy&#39;s daughter Lian, and even former Speedy Mia Dearden. Over the years, Oliver has dealt with his self-hatred and worked on being a better man, and the fact he&#39;s reunited his family against all odds shows that he&#39;s made real progress.




Unfortunately, Ollie&#39;s sometimes-rival, Batman, seems to be doing the exact opposite. Due to the machinations of Zur-En-Arrh, Batman has turned his back on his family as of Batman/Catwoman: The Gotham War - Scorched Earth #1 by Chip Zdarsky, Tini Howard, Nikola Čižmešija, Mike Hawthorne, Wade Von Grawbadger, Mark Morales, Romulo Fajardo Jr., and Clayton Cowles. Unlike Green Arrow, Batman has completely forsaken his family and is spiraling because of it. It&#39;s thrilling to see Ollie and the &#34;Arrow Family&#34; finally enjoying the reunion that fans have been calling for since Green Arrow&#39;s continuity was &#34;rebooted&#34; for the New 52. Their joy is in stark contrast with the state of the fan-favorite Bat-Family, who are more divided than ever.



 Batman Officially Disbands the Bat-Family 
          




Batman and Green Arrow have been rivals for years and have copied each other quite a bit. But it seems the one area where they couldn&#39;t be more different is in how they treat their families. It&#39;s likely those differences will only become more clear as Green Arrow continues to rescue his family members and as Batman continues to spiral alone. Now as Green Arrow is finally reunited with his family and doing better than ever, Batman is isolated from his family, having pushed them away and falling further and further into darkness.
