## Literature Review

No fan who has been following IDW&#39;s Sonic the Hedgehog since the Metal Virus Saga would think this character actually saves the day in issue #66.




Warning: Spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog #66Although a pathetic villainous duo, it&#39;s still shocking that the ridiculously lame Rough and Tumble lost against Cream&#39;s mother Vanilla the Rabbit in the latest issue of IDW&#39;s Sonic the Hedgehog. This is especially unexpected when looking back at Vanilla&#39;s previous contributions to the series, or lack thereof, and since it was implied that the day would be saved by the Chaotix after recently reuniting with Knuckles.




After Rough and Tumble come to disrupt Cream&#39;s dinner preparations, her mother, Vanilla, arrives home at the last minute. Vanilla proceeds to completely intimidate the villainous duo into submission in Sonic #66&#39;s short story &#34;Dinner at Cream&#39;s Part 2&#34; by writer Evan Stanley, artist Adam Bryce Thomas, colorist Valentina Pinto and letterer Shawn Lee.

          

During Vanilla&#39;s act of intimidation, the Chaotix arrive and attempt to warn Vanilla about Rough and Tumble. But Vanilla clearly has the situation under control and doesn&#39;t require their services.


 Vanilla&#39;s Unexpected Victory Redeems Her Most Embarrassing Failure 
         




Before now, Vanilla has hardly received much face time in the series, and the moments in which she has appeared haven&#39;t been much to talk about. Her worst claim to fame occurs during the Metal Virus Saga in issue #18, and she comes across as a horrible mother at one moment in particular. Vanilla first understandably convinces Cream to not fight outside their home with her guardian and reformed Badnik Gemerl against the invading Zombots. However, she fails to follow Cream onto the battlefield when Cream rushes out to confront Gemerl who is fighting Sonic. Any good mother would charge after their children if they ever ran into danger and Vanilla doesn&#39;t. On top of it all, Vanilla has to be carried away by her daughter when Sonic comes and saves them after the Zombots eventually overtake their home. Vanilla&#39;s heroic actions in Sonic #66 are definitely more than a few steps up from her earlier embarrassing blunder during the Metal Virus Saga.



 The Winner of Sonic&#39;s New Battle Subverts Expectations 
          




Moreover, Rough and Tumble&#39;s attack in the present day even ends up being too much for Gemerl, who has proven himself in many of Sonic&#39;s best boss battles. This underscores Vanilla&#39;s unexpected achievement even more. Similarly, parts 1 and 2 of both &#34;Dinner At Cream&#39;s&#34; and the corresponding &#34;Relic Robbing Rumble&#34; short stories had been hinting for the past two issues that the Chaotix would come to save the day at the end. The fact that they don&#39;t because of Vanilla clearly subverts expectations even further while accentuating Vanilla&#39;s victory once again on a whole other level.

While fans would undoubtedly have wanted to see Vanilla&#39;s daughter Cream shine more than she does during this short story as well, at least her mother&#39;s past actions have been superseded here by her latest exploits in IDW&#39;s Sonic the Hedgehog.



Sonic the Hedgehog #66 is available from IDW Publishing.
