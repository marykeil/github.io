## Literature Review

While Mary Jane&#39;s new partner Paul may be incredibly unpopular with readers, he provides support for MJ in ways that Spider-Man never could.




Warning: Spoilers for Jackpot (2024) #1 ahead!Spider-Man loving Mary Jane may be a multiversal constant, but that doesn&#39;t mean she has to love him back. While the two remain excellent friends, Mary Jane&#39;s recent Jackpot one-shot as part of the Marvel &#34;Gang War&#34; event shows how she&#39;s moved on from Peter Parker - and how her hero career is flourishing as a result.




Celeste Bronfman, Joey Vazquez, and Edgar Delgado&#39;s Jackpot (2024) #1 sees Mary Jane suiting up as Jackpot once more to help quell the Gang War raging throughout New York City. Paul is behind her 100 percent, acting as her &#34;man in the chair&#34; while sparks fly in Jackpot&#39;s furious duel with Electro.

          

The pair work in perfect sync with each other: Paul monitors and guides Mary Jane through her headset while Mary Jane handles the crisis on the ground. Together, they&#39;re able to keep Electro&#39;s damage to a minimum.

                  New Spider-Man Proves Marvel Will Never Reverse Controversial &#39;One More Day&#39;   Marvel’s new Ultimate Spider-Man book spotlights Mary Jane and Peter Parker’s new family in spite of &#34;One More Day,&#34; but not on Earth-616.   





 MJ&#39;s Superhero Career Shows Her Dynamic With Spider-Man Was Flawed 
          

While Mary Jane has long been a positive influence on Spider-Man&#39;s life, the same cannot be said for Spider-Man&#39;s effect on hers. Their relationship has been held hostage for the sake of drama far too often, whether in the form of a supervillain threat or Spider-Man&#39;s superhero responsibilities leading him to neglect Mary Jane&#39;s wants and needs. This does not devalue their love for each other, but it does emphasize that their relationship has rarely been on equal terms: too often, Mary Jane has been written solely to prop up Spider-Man while getting little in return.

By contrast, Jackpot (2024) #1 takes great care to show how Paul and Mary Jane work to support each other. A subtle theme throughout the book is how Mary Jane has grappled with feelings of powerlessness in the past: the loss of her adopted children, certainly, but this can also be extrapolated to her having to rely on Spider-Man for the majority of her publication history. This issue shows how she and Paul rely on each other, whether it be through grief counseling or unhesitatingly working as a team to clear civilians out of the streets as the Gang War erupts. Paul gives Mary Jane the support and validation she never had with Spider-Man, making a return to the old status quo highly unlikely.






 Mary Jane Shines As Jackpot - Without Spider-Man 
          

Fans of Mary Jane and Spider-Man are not left destitute: in the rebooted Ultimate Universe, Spider-Man and Mary Jane are still together with children of their own. Back home in Earth-616, however, Mary Jane is living her best life as Jackpot, coming out of Spider-Man&#39;s shadow to reclaim her sense of power and agency - something that she could not do without Paul. Like it or leave it, but the end of Mary Jane and Spider-Man&#39;s romance has helped Mary Jane flourish like never before.
