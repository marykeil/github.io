Ultimate Spider-Man featured cover art that tried to be &ldquo;new&rdquo; and &ldquo;cutting-edge&rdquo; but ended up looking weird.
The early 2000s lingo used in Ultimate Spider-Man, like &ldquo;wigged out&rdquo; and &ldquo;busted,&rdquo; helped modernize the story but doesn&rsquo;t hold up well today - and those were just some of the ways the Ultimate Universe brought Spider-Man into the new millennium.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Ultimate Universe was created to modernize Marvel characters and storylines, &amp; Ultimate Spider-Man was the flagship. Here&rsquo;s the 10 best moments!</p>
<p>Spider-Man is one of the most iconic heroes in Marvel Comics, whose history stretches all the way back to the 1960s, and has had wildly influential storylines throughout every decade since then - which means, by 2000, the character was long overdue for a reboot with Ultimate Spider-Man.
The Ultimate Universe was originally an initiative to modernize Marvel Comics, taking legendary heroes, villains, and their storylines and revamping them in the modern day. Of course, ‘modern day’ at the time was the year 2000, meaning Marvel wasn’t just making its characters more up to date, it was bringing them into the new millennium. And when it came to its flagship title, Ultimate Spider-Man, Marvel didn’t waste any time at all. Here are the 10 ways Spider-Man lore was changed to fit into the early 2000s era!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Parker, You Are Not Getting Any Younger&rdquo;: Meet Spider-Man&rsquo;s Children, as Ultimate Spider-Man Rewrites Peter Parker&rsquo;s Entire Life
In a new preview for Ultimate Spider-Man #1, fans are given the best look yet at how the new Ultimate Universe is rewriting Peter Parker&rsquo;s whole life.</p>
<p>10  Ultimate Spider-Man Streamlined His Origin (&amp; Included 2 Major Villains)
Ultimate Spider-Man #1 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>In Marvel’s Earth-616 continuity, Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was a freak accident, the nature of which didn’t really play any major roles in his life beyond that point. However, in the Ultimate Universe, the spider was created deliberately, and by a company that would play a major role in Spider-Man’s life moving forward: Osborn Industries. Norman Osborn was the one who created Spider-Man in the Ultimate Universe, and the scientific brilliance of Otto Octavius helped him do it.
Not only were these two well-known Spider-Man villains responsible for creating him, but the very creation of Spider-Man himself led to Osborn and Octavius becoming supervillains. When Parker didn’t die after being bitten, they ran controlled experiments on themselves, resulting in Norman Osborn transforming into the Green Goblin, and Otto Octavius becoming Doc Ock. This was an interesting way to tie Spider-Man’s two most notable arch-rivals to his origin, making them that much more impactful as his story unfolds.</p>
<p>9  Ultimate Spider-Man Featured Truly Bizarre ‘Cutting-Edge’ Cover Art
Ultimate Spider-Man #2 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>Not only was Spider-Man’s character and storyline updated to fit the modern era of the early 2000s, but so was the entire aesthetic of his book. One of the more bizarre attempts to be ‘new’ and ‘cutting-edge’ was splattered on the cover of Ultimate Spider-Man #2. The cover art was a photograph of a parked car on a New York street, with an illustrated Spider-Man kneeling on it in a way that’s decidedly unnatural and even questionably proportional.
Computer-generated illustrations were just becoming popular, and the Ultimate Universe took advantage of the trend in a number of different titles. But this was something else entirely, a cover that was trying to look cool and modern, but ended up just looking weird.</p>
<p>8  “Wigged Out”, “Not a Party”, “Busted” - Ultimate Spider-Man Had Lots of Early 2000s Lingo
Ultimate Spider-Man #1-3 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>When re-reading the Ultimate Spider-Man comic - especially the first few issues - the early 2000s lingo really stands out. Obviously, everything the characters were saying (and how they were saying it) was totally era appropriate, though ironically, in trying to make a more modern Spider-Man, Marvel Comics just put out more stories destined to be blatantly dated just like the originals were.
For example, when Peter Parker was bitten by the spider and passed out, he explained his symptoms away by telling his teacher that he “wigged out” over getting bitten. Later, Aunt May is fussing at Peter for slacking off in school (when he was coming into his own as Spider-Man), and Peter responds by saying, “school’s not a party”. Then, in another situation, one of Peter’s high school classmates yells, “busted!” unironically. These phrases were commonplace in the early 2000s, and were integral to the modernization of Spider-Man lore - too bad they don’t hold up so well today.</p>
<p>7  Ultimate Spider-Man Gave Him The Best Costume Origin in Marvel History
Ultimate Spider-Man #3 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>Maybe aside from the MCU, which did a great job of showing Spider-Man with a believable first-gen suit before he got his iconic one courtesy of Tony Stark, Ultimate Spider-Man gave him the best costume origin in Marvel history. In practically every other Spider-Man story - including the first two film franchises as well as the original comic - Peter Parker simply makes his own costume. While it’s true that Peter makes a comment about how he can sew anything because of his spider-powers in Amazing Fantasy #15, it just seems like this high schooler got really good at sewing in the name of vigilante justice, and is just an odd extra power that’s never really used again.
In Ultimate Spider-Man, Peter starts wrestling for money in a suit not too dissimilar from his normal first-gen costumes shown in any given Spider-Man origin. Until, the promoter had a costume professionally made for Spider-Man to better market him as a money-making attraction - and that’s the very suit that became his iconic Spider-Man costume.</p>
<p>6  Ultimate Spider-Man Does A Way Better Job At Portraying Peter’s Teenage Angst
Ultimate Spider-Man #4 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>If there’s one thing early 2000s teens perfected, it was angst. That much was obvious in the flood of pop punk, scene culture, and basically all of Tumblr, and Spider-Man was not immune. Peter Parker in the Ultimate Universe was a punk kid whose ‘parents’ didn’t understand him. He’d storm out of the house in a huff during a fight with his aunt and uncle, he was bullied in high school and had regular revenge fantasies, and he’d blow off his girlfriend to lay in bed alone with his emotions that he was positive were ‘too much for her’.
The original Peter Parker was a good boy with a bright future, while Ultimate Peter Parker was so wrapped up in his own feelings that readers could feel it emanating from the pages of the comic itself. Which is why Ultimate Peter was so much more relatable, and perfect for the more modern era.</p>
<p>5  Ultimate Spider-Man Made Uncle Ben’s Death Way More Emotional
Ultimate Spider-Man #5 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>Uncle Ben’s death is an inevitability for Spider-Man, no matter the iteration, but Ultimate Spider-Man really drove home the tragedy of his murder - both in terms of the buildup and the lasting impact. Originally, Uncle Ben died in the very issue he was introduced in, which happened quickly and without much character development beforehand. His death was a plot device, plain and simple. It was heart-wrenching for Spider-Man, but completely trivial for the reader.
In the Ultimate Universe, however, Uncle Ben is alive for the first five issues of the comic, allowing readers to build a relationship with him while showing the dynamic of Peter’s family. On the night Ben died, he and Peter got into a fight, making the fact that he was gone that much more heartbreaking. Then, for many issues following his death, Peter and May were still spending nights crying in each other’s arms, and very clearly mourning the loss of Uncle Ben. The new millennium called for more emotionally driven storytelling, and Ultimate Spider-Man did not disappoint.</p>
<p>4  Spider-Man’s Arch Enemy The Green Goblin Got An Ultimate Upgrade
Ultimate Spider-Man #6 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that the Green Goblin is Spider-Man’s arch enemy, something that’s been proven true in the original Earth-616 continuity. Goblin tormented Spider-Man on a personal level, killed Gwen Stacy, and even orchestrated the Clone Saga (which was arguably more of a crime against the reader than Spider-Man). So, it only makes sense that Green Goblin would get an ultimate upgrade in the Ultimate Universe - and in more ways than one.
Not only was Norman Osborn directly responsible for creating Spider-Man (which led to him becoming Green Goblin to begin with), but that meant Norman knew Peter was Spider-Man from the start, and hated him for making a mockery of his scientific research. Their relationship was much more clearly defined in Ultimate Spider-Man, which was simply better storytelling. However, the real upgrade the Green Goblin saw was a physical one, as he was massively muscular with the ability to shoot fireballs from his hands - an ultimate upgrade, indeed.</p>
<p>3  Ultimate Spider-Man Brought Peter’s Job At The Daily Bugle Into The 21st Century
Ultimate Spider-Man #8 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>News outlets are always hiring photographers - including stringers, especially in big cities like New York - meaning that it’s in no way an out-of-date profession, but the way Peter Parker does it is not a very sustainable way to make a living. Peter sells pictures of Spider-Man specifically, and he does so as an amateur photographer with no training or accolades - not to mention he’s a high school student. Plus, he can only sell the photos at a high price to Jameson when Spider-Man does something newsworthy, otherwise Jameson wouldn’t need to buy a new photo of Spider-Man to add to any specific story, he could just pull one from the archives and slap it on an article that essentially amounts to ‘clickbait’.
Peter can’t make a good living just selling pictures of Spider-Man to a newspaper, especially at the turn of the millennium. But, he can make good money by effectively running the Daily Bugle’s website. The internet was still considered very new in the early 2000s to the general public, and businesses were just starting to join the ‘dot com’ boom, which meant many of them didn’t have employees trained to really do anything involving the internet. Teenagers, however, practically grew up alongside the internet at that time, so someone as inherently intelligent as Peter was able to grasp it easily. Ultimate Spider-Man made Peter the Daily Bugle’s web guy (pun probably intended), which made his career with the newspaper much more believable.</p>
<p>2  Ultimate Spider-Man Made Jameson’s Harsh Reporting Much More Justified
Ultimate Spider-Man #9 &amp; #10 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>When Spider-Man gets wind of the Kingpin in the Ultimate Universe, he immediately tries to take him down. However, Peter’s just a high school kid, he knows nothing about dismantling a criminal enterprise like the one established by Wilson Fisk. So, Spider-Man ends up in a warehouse with some mobsters, talking to them casually about where he can find the Kingpin moments before an FBI raid. Spider-Man gets out of there, of course, but not before he’s seen by the agents, which is information that eventually makes its way to the media. And so, the ‘Spider-Man: Menace’ headline was born, and honestly, that’s totally fair given the circumstances - the source was the FBI, after all.
Then, the very mobster Spider-Man was talking to shows up dead a few days later, wearing Spider-Man’s mask, to boot. Kingpin killed him after beating Spider-Man in a fight, taking his mask before throwing him out of a skyscraper window, and then putting that mask on his goon’s head while he crushed the life out of him. All of this isn’t looking so good for Spidey, nor should it, making Jameson’s ‘harsh’ reporting of him much more justified.</p>
<p>1  The Daily Bugle’s ‘No Smoking’ Sign Is Ignored By Jameson In Ultimate Spider-Man
Ultimate Spider-Man #9 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley</p>
<p>While today smoking indoors is something that’s almost never okay, especially in a place of business like a newspaper, that wasn’t the case not too long ago. The first smoking ban in the United States was in California in 1995, with most other states following suit through 2007. That means J. Jonah Jameson totally ignoring the ‘no smoking’ sign in his office is something that would absolutely happen in 2000-2001, especially since New York didn’t officially ban smoking indoors until 2003 (though smoking had been banned in federal buildings since 1997).
This instance is less of a Spider-Man-specific example in terms of his character, and more of a moment that truly showed the world of the early 2000s in a totally honest and authentic way, making this one of the 10 Ultimate Spider-Man moments that helped Marvel websling into the new millennium.</p>
