## Literature Review

Hip Hop Family Tree and X-Men: Grand Design creator Ed Piskor has just launched his latest comics project, a daily strip released via Instagram.




Hip Hop Family Tree’s Ed Piskor has just launched his latest comics project, Switchblade Shorties, and this time he’s bringing it directly to his readers every day. A new installment of the Switchblade Shorties comic strip is scheduled to be released daily in 2024, as Piskor chronicles the adventures of &#34;the last of the latchkey kids who must solve the world&#39;s problems without adult interference.&#34;




Written and drawn by Ed Piskor, Switchblade Shorties launched January 1 directly to Instagram, with new installments scheduled to be released daily, specially formatted to be read directly on the platform. Check out the first installment below:


 

Speaking on the Cartoonist Kayfabe Youtube channel that he co-hosts with fellow cartoonist Jim Rugg, Piskor describes wanting to bring back the daily comic strip, and formatting it specifically for Instagram: “I have these comics laid out in a landscape fashion, with Instagram on my mind…So that each strip will be six, scroll-able images.”

 Ed Piskor&#39;s Switchblade Shorties Brings the Daily Comic Strip into the Instagram Era 

 

Originally appearing as the backup strip Latchkey Kidz in Piskor’s Red Room, the strip was retitled Switchblade Shorties when officially launched online as its own strip. The opening installment acts as an introduction for each character, as readers are introduced to pre-teens “Sodapop” Tanner, Pinky Winslow, Sheena Belvedere, “Charly Horse” Kinison and Foster Lambert. Together they make up a group of misfits in Pittsburgh who join together to search for a missing kid, Petey Wheatcakes. Operating as a kind of foul-mouthed, irreverent Our Gang, the girls will encounter all manner of weirdness as they search for their missing friend.

After gaining traction with his self-published hacker comic Wizzywig, Ed Piskor found his biggest mainstream success with Hip Hop Family Tree, his oral history of rap and hip hop in comic book form. Piskor later turned his attention to Marvel when he launched X-Men: Grand Design, the cartoonist’s reimagining of X-Men history into one single chronology. Piskor’s most recent work was the controversial Red Room, an outlaw horror comic that broke all boundaries due to its violent and provocative content. Piskor has achieved even more attention thanks to Cartoonist Kayfabe, where he and co-host Jim Rugg use their expertise to break down classic comics.






 Switchblade Shorties Follows the “Last of the Latchkey Kids” 

 

With Switchblade Shorties, Ed Piskor enters a new phase in his comics-making career, continuing to experiment and test boundaries as the comics medium continues to evolve and change. By releasing it directly to his readers for free via daily Instagram posts, Ed Piskor continues to innovate while honing his craft, ensuring that Switchblade Shorties will be a comic strip that fans of Hip Hop Family Tree and other comics won’t want to miss.
