## Literature Review

The beloved X-Men: TAS is getting a series reboot, with Marvel releasing an X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic from the creators of X-Men &#39;92: House of XCII.




As X-Men fans eagerly await the debut of the new X-Men &#39;97 animated series in 2024, they can prepare for the upcoming continuation of the beloved 90&#39;s TV show by reading its official prelude comic, which debuts this March. From the creators of the brilliant alternate reality X-Men &#39;92: House of XCII comic series, the X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic will tie directly into the upcoming animated series, and was created in partnership with its showrunners.




X-Men: The Animated Series ran from 1992 until 1997 - hence why the new series is titled X-Men &#39;97 - and was beloved by countless Marvel fans, acting as many people&#39;s first major introduction to the X-Men franchise, meaning the new series and comic will be true nostalgia fuel.

          

Marvel&#39;s announcement of the X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic, from writer Steve Foxe and artist Salva Espín with close collaboration from series creator Beau DeMayo, reveals the limited series will prepare fans for the debut of the new Disney&#43; series, with &#34;startling revelations&#34; that lead right into the show.


 The Creators Of X-Men &#39;92: House of XCII Are Perfect For This Comic 
          




The creative team behind the X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic, Foxe and Espín, previously partnered on the X-Men &#39;92: House of XCII series, which saw the X-Men&#39;s Krakoan Era happening in a universe inspired by X-Men: The Animated Series and 90&#39;s X-Men comics. The entire series perfectly encapsulated the spirit of the 90s, making Foxe and Espín the ideal creators for this new prelude comic, since the creators of X-Men &#39;97 have worked hard to make the reboot of the series feel just like X-Men: The Animated Series. 90s nostalgia is at an all-time high, and the X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic sounds like the perfect way to start getting into the 90s spirit!

The original X-Men: The Animated Series was an iconic series that, while focused on original storytelling, also adapted many famous stories from the X-Men comics, most notably the beloved Dark Phoenix Saga. The series ended on something of a cliffhanger, and now X-Men &#39;97 will pick up right where the series left off, with Charles Xavier injured by Henry Peter Gyrich and heading for Shi&#39;ar space with Lilandra Neremani, leaving the X-Men wondering what is next for them. It seems like X-Men &#39;97 will see Magneto step up in Xavier&#39;s absence to help lead the Xavier School, just like the former villain did in X-Men comics, while Mister Sinister&#39;s evil machinations continue.






 Todd Nauck&#39;s Cover Is A Beautiful Homage To The Animated Series 
          

The talented Todd Nauck is the cover artist for the X-Men &#39;97 prelude comic - with colors by Rachelle Rosenberg - and his cover for X-Men &#39;97 #1 is a beautiful homage to one X-Men: The Animated Series&#39; most well-known promotional art. X-Men: The Animated Series is such an important, beloved, and iconic part of so many X-Men fan&#39;s childhoods, and Nauck&#39;s art stunningly captures the energy and excitement of its original art. The prelude comic will serve to fill fans in on what has happened to memorable characters like Jubilee, Wolverine, and Storm, all characters featured on Nauck&#39;s cover for the first issue.

The upcoming X-Men &#39;97 animated series is one of the most hotly anticipated things Marvel has ever produced, and fans new and old will surely be tuning in to see what happened after the beloved X-Men: The Animated Series ended. Marvel&#39;s new prelude comic for X-Men &#39;97 will prepare fans for what everyone&#39;s favorite 90&#39;s X-Men have been up to, as they eagerly await the debut of the rebooted series.




X-Men &#39;97 from Marvel Comics debuts on March 27th, 2024.
