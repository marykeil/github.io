## Literature Review

Moon Knight does not seem to enjoy the best reputation in the Marvel Universe, but his recent death calls this into question. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1!




Moon Knight’s recent death clears up a common misconception fans have about him. In Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1, the surviving members of the Midnight Mission are left to pick up the pieces in the wake of Marc Spector’s death. As they try to start where their friend left off, one of the biggest misconceptions about Moon Knight is thoroughly dispelled.

Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1 is written by Jed MacKay and drawn by Alessandro Cappuccio. Reese, Marc’s vampiric assistant, is relating to Doctor Sterman on the days following Moon Knight’s death. Reese, along with Tigra, 8-Ball and Hunter’s Moon decide to sit Shiva for Marc–meaning they cannot leave the body for seven days. Reese then reveals to Doctor Sterman that while the Mission members were sitting, other heroes, such as Captain America and Hawkeye, picked up the slack, protecting the territory and making Moon Knight proud.

          




Once the Shiva period is over, Reese leads the Midnight Mission in continuing Marc’s work.


 Moon Knight&#39;s Death Took Him to a Whole Another Level 
          

Two years ago, MacKay and Cappuccio took Moon Knight to the next level, launching a new book that gave Marc Spector a new role in the Marvel Universe. After parting ways with Khonshu, Moon Knight opens the Midnight Mission. Moon Knight has acquired a new cadre of associates, including the aforementioned Reese, as well as Hunter’s Moon, another Fist of Khonshu. However, all good things had to end, and Marc Spector was seemingly killed by the Black Spectre. As seen in Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1, a number of Marvel heroes came to Spector’s funeral, which makes for an interesting revelation about him.

A common misconception that fans have about Moon Knight is that other heroes tend not to like him, and indeed there is a good deal of precedent for this. Moon Knight’s current mission spins out of a disastrous fight with the Avengers, a conflict which led to his parting with Khonshu. Tigra, who has become one of Moon Knight’s closest allies, is assigned by the Avengers to monitor him. Furthermore, MacKay and Cappuccio have revealed Doctor Strange has a strong dislike for Moon Knight as well. Moon Knight also seems to do little to counter this image, and almost seems to revel in it.




                  Moon Knight Made a Huge Mistake with Khonshu - One It Should Never Repeat   Moon Knight vs Khonshu was a genius face-off, but Marvel made a major mistake by retconning the outcome - a mistake it could easily make again.   



 Moon Knight is Respected and Admired After All 
          

However, the days following Marc Spector’s passing reveals that Moon Knight’s fellow heroes do respect him. Not only did several turn up for his funeral, including Doctor Strange, but others fought to keep the Midnight Mission safe while Marc’s former associates honored his memory. Those stepping up for Moon Knight included Hawkeye and Captain America, two honorable heroes who would not ally themselves with just anybody. These heroes, who often seem at odds with Moon Knight, come together to keep his dream alive. Far from being a pariah among other Marvel heroes, Moon Knight is actually respected and admired.
