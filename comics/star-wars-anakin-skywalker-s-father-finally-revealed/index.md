## Literature Review

The mystery of Anakin Skywalker&#39;s father has finally been solved, with Star Wars seemingly confirming a major fan theory. SPOILERS ahead.




The mystery of Anakin Skywalker’s birth has finally been solved, confirming Sheev Palpatine&#39;s true role in his mother&#39;s pregnancy, and changing the Star Wars mythology behind the corruption of Darth Vader forever.




The revelation is offered in the pages of Marvel&#39;s canonical Darth Vader #25, proving one long-held fan theory mostly true in its claims that Anakin Skywalker was designed, or engineered (not conceived naturally). It may seem strange that Anakin&#39;s parentage didn&#39;t become the driving mystery of the Star Wars prequels, when Qui-Gon Jinn sensed the greatest “vergence of the Force” he had ever encountered, and asked the obvious question: &#34;Who is this boy’s father?&#34; Assuming such a connection to the Force could only be explained through genetics (Luke would later refer to the “mighty Skywalker blood” in Ben Solo, too), Qui-Gon didn&#39;t get the answer he was looking for.

          

According to Shmi Skywalker, “There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can&#39;t explain what happened.” Even in the world of Star Wars, a cosmic variation on a &#34;virgin birth&#34; is a major development, and Qui-Gon knew to bring the boy back to the cradle of the Jedi. The boy, he believed, whom the Jedi had been waiting for. Not because he was created without a father, but because his &#39;father&#39; was the Force itself. Apparently, he wasn&#39;t entirely wrong.





 Qui-Gon Believed The Force Created Anakin in Shmi Skywalker 
          

This step in the mystery of Anakin’s birth is sure to be controversial, even difficult for some Star Wars fans, since it relies upon the intervention of Midi-chlorians. But whether the Force is an ‘energy field’ connecting all life forms, or the effect of microscopic beings connecting all life forms, the result is the same. And Qui-Gon judged that the only way Anakin Skywalker could possess his concentration of Midi-chlorians was if they created him themselves, inside Shmi Skywalker’s womb. Making Anakin the Chosen One, prophesied to one day emerge to bring balance to the Force.

That was Qui-Gon’s theory, at least, and it was left as the only explanation in the Star Wars movies (before the mystery was largely sidelined). Theories and potential explanations arose in expanded universe novels, even linking Anakin’s conception to the Sith Lords, instead of the Midi-chlorians alone. UBut now that the truth has been shown, it appears Qui-Gon was just as deceived as the rest of the Jedi Council. The Midi-chlorians may have been the tool used to create Anakin Skywalker, but it wasn’t their idea. Anakin Skywalker was created by manipulating the Dark Side of the Force, as many suspected, but the identity of his ‘father’ guarantees no fan will ever see the Star Wars saga the same way again.






 Emperor Palpatine is Revealed To Be Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Real &#39;Father&#39;

Yes, Star Wars fans, Darth Vader #25 confirms Anakin Skywalker was the result of Dark Side/Midi-chlorian manipulation inside of Shmi Skywalker’s womb, performed personally by Emperor Palpatine. And for those who might wonder how Anakin could ever learn such an Earth-shattering truth, without suspicion of it being further manipulation by his Sith Master, the circumstances of the story help explain.

Writer Charles Soule and artist Giuseppe Camuncoli&#39;s Vader series makes multiple exciting changes to the Star Wars canon, also explaining that Darth Vader built his castle to save Padmé. But upon succeeding in his mission to tear a hole between the realm of life, and that of the living Force, Vader (shown in his true Force form as a roiling figure of dark energy) re-lives the most pivotal moments of his life. Starting from the beginning, beholding his pregnant mother... with Palpatine’s arms encircling her, hands curled in Sith sorcery, forming the swirl of energy inside of her that would one day emerge as Anakin.






 Darth Plagueis &amp; Palpatine Created The Sith &#39;Chosen One&#39; After All 
Originally teased in Star Wars: Darth Plageuis (2012) by James Luceno

          

From the moment Chancellor Palpatine told Anakin about the tale of Darth Plagueis the Wise and his mastery over life and death, fans have theorized that George Lucas was hinting at something more than fairy tales. The story of the Sith Lord who learned to manipulate Midi-chlorians to create life, and the Apprentice who killed him in his sleep, they speculate, had to be more than it seemed. While Anakin heard he could keep his wife alive through the Dark Side, some viewers heard Sidious confirming he had killed his master after learning that same power over life itself.

The knowing looks at Anakin are all the evidence needed, and the full story laid out in the Darth Plagueis novel by James Luceno added fuel to the fire. Some details were left vague, but the story suggests Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious reached out through the Force to try to create a child they could use as an ultimate weapon. But the Midi-chlorians, sensing their attempt, foiled their plans... creating a child that would bring about the end of the Sith, instead. Of course, that was before Disney bought Lucasfilm and wiped Plagueis from canon, along with all other novels (until they can be worked back into the new Star Wars canon).




          

The same attempt to bring the story of Darth Plagueis back into canon could be at work here, even if the comic shows Palpatine playing a far more personal role in the manipulation of Midi-chlorians to create Anakin. In fact, the passage from Darth Plagueis in which Count Dooku informs Palpatine of Qui-Gon&#39;s discovery reads completely different in this new context:


&#34;Qui-Gon returned from Tatooine with a former slave boy. According to the boy&#39;s mother, the boy had no father... Perhaps conceived by the Force. As Qui-Gon believes.&#34;
Palpatine&#39;s head snapped back... &#34;Does this have something to do with the prophecy you spoke of?&#34;
&#34;Everything. Qui-Gon believes that the boy-Anakin is his name-stands at the center of a vergence in the Force, and believes further that his finding him was the will of the Force. Blood tests were apparently performed, and the boy&#39;s concentration of midi-chlorians is unprecedented.&#34;
&#34;What is known about this Anakin?&#34;
&#34;Very little, except for the fact that he was born into slavery nine years ago and was, until recently, along with his mother, the property of Gardulla the Hutt, then a Toydarian junk dealer.&#34; Dooku smirked. &#34;Also that he won the Boonta Eve Classic Podrace.&#34;
Palpatine had stopped listening.
Nine years old... Conceived by the Force... Is it possible...





          

Until now, it was still just rumor and fan theory that suggested Darth Sidious had been the closest thing to a father Anakin Skywalker had, making Palpatine and Vader a father and son. Now this canonical comic has seemingly confirmed he did the job personally (perhaps the only attempt that worked?), but what this means for the bloodline which followed, and Palpatine&#39;s connection to Luke, Leia, or Ben Solo is for each fan to consider.

Darth Vader #25 is available from Marvel Comics.
