# 1 Sinister Joker Plan Turned Batman s Greatest Fear Against Him


## SUMMARY 



  The Joker&#39;s plot to infect Gotham City with Joker Venom-infected bats was a brilliant, twisted plan that would have turned Batman into a symbol of destruction, rather than home.   Joker Venom is a deadly poison that can kill victims within seconds and leave them with a rictus smile, yet the Joker has never revisited the idea of infecting bats with this venom.   If the Joker decides to revisit his old plan, it could pose one of the most dangerous situations Batman has ever faced, with the potential to unleash chaos and leave no safe place in Gotham City.

## Literature Review

The Joker has had many diabolical plans over the years, but one dark plan deserved a lot more credit than it was given.




Batman villain the Joker is infamous for constantly coming up with new ideas to try and hurt Batman or kill the citizens of Gotham City. Sometimes these ideas range from the truly absurd to the frighteningly sadistic, but one of the Joker&#39;s lesser known ideas was when he tried to turn Batman&#39;s greatest fear into a source of terror for all of Gotham City.




The DC/Marvel crossover Spider-Man and Batman – by J.M. DeMatteis, Mark Bagley, Scott Hanna, Mark Farmer, and Richward Starkings – featured one of Joker&#39;s most nefarious plots.

When Batman hunted down the Joker in this comic, he found him on the verge of unleashing his grand scheme.



          

Joker planned to release Joker Venom-infected bats into the Gotham sky, where they would infect more bats, before eventually spreading the disease to people. Considering the sheer number of bats in Gotham City, it was an extremely brilliant plan, one that would have turned Batman from a symbol of fear for Gotham&#39;s villains to a signifier of destruction for its populace.

                  &#34;You Get the Joke!&#34;: Joker Is Only Evil Because a Marvel Villain Corrupted Him   The Joker was finally cured of his insanity, meaning he was ready to lead a normal life — until one Marvel villain decided to corrupt him for good.   





 Batman Battles The Joker Over Gotham City 


          





The Spider-Man and Batman crossover one-shot was released in 1995.




Joker Venom is one of the most dangerous poisons that comic books have ever seen. It can famously kill its victims in a few seconds, turn them into a smiling corpse, to signify the Joker was the killer. Over the years, the Joker has done a few variations on his famous Joker Venom, such as the iconic laughing fish incident, where Joker poisoned all the fish in Gotham harbor so that they looked like him. In Spider-Man and Batman, the Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s attempt to do this to bats was a brilliant twist on this idea, and it&#39;s surprising that the Joker has never revised the idea in all these years.




Over the years, Joker has gotten his own Batsuit, his own Batarangs, and even his own Robins. It&#39;s no surprise that eventually he&#39;d find a way to turn even bats against Batman. However, what is surprising is the fact this idea was only used once, in what can be considered a throwaway moment during a crossover comic. Gotham City, and the Batcave, by extension, are practically infested with bats. Infecting them with a Joker-virus would very quickly cause rampant chaos and leave no safe place in the city – all things the Joker would love. Still, for one reason or another, this idea hasn&#39;t been revisited.



 Batman Defeated Joker And His Infected Bats 


          

Over the years, Batman and the Joker&#39;s antagonism has always escalated. The Joker has only sought out worse and worse ways to hurt the Dark Knight. Joker killed Robin, stole Bruce Wayne&#39;s fortune, infected all of Gotham with a Joker virus, and so much more. Eventually, the Joker might just return to old ideas, as he has in the past, such revisiting the idea of poisoning Gotham&#39;s bat population. If the Joker ever decides to revisit this old idea, it could very well be one of the most dangerous situations Batman has ever found himself in. Joker himself admits that Batman was only 30 seconds away from his virus being unleashed on Gotham once and for all
