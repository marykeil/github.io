## Literature Review

By working through his trauma in therapy, Miles has not only regained his Spider-Man powers, he&#39;s evolved them beyond what even Peter Parker can do.




Warning! Preview pages for Giant-Size Spider-Man #1 ahead!Miles Morales has had a wild year, and it looks like his 2024 is already off to an interesting start. Miles has been in therapy, trying to regain control of his Spider-Sense, but his work there has actually evolved his powers. Now, Spider-Man has X-ray vision.




In a preview for Giant-Size Spider-Man #1 by Cody Ziglar, Iban Coello, Guru-eFX and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna, Misty Knight recruits Miles for a mission investigating some new goons, led by a villain named Black Obsidian. Miles makes for a perfect spy, as he can turn invisible, a power Peter Parker never had. Building off his therapy sessions to control his powers and senses, he&#39;s gained another ability Peter missed out on.

          

If he concentrates hard enough, he can almost &#34;see&#34; the danger he senses. It&#39;s not perfect: the skeletal shapes he sees through the wall look nothing like humans. But as Miles focuses on developing his skills, he could perfect this before he knows it.


 Miles&#39;s New Spidey Sense Can See Through Walls 
         




Spider-Man has a hard time in every universe, but Miles Morales is really coming back from the brink. His secret identity was discovered by the villain Rabble, who then destroyed the Morales family&#39;s home. The mental anguish caused Miles to lose his grip on his Spider-Senses, as he was both unable to sense danger and on constant high alert when nothing was wrong. He&#39;s been hunted by the Cape Killers because of New York City&#39;s current law against heroes, and discovered that vampires are real and attacking people on his turf. He&#39;s had panic attacks while trying to balance school, family, and the City That Never Sleeps. Throughout all of that, he&#39;s done the one thing that so many superheroes struggle to do, but all of them need to - go to therapy.

Miles&#39;s work with Doc Sasquatch and his protégé, Keisha Kwan, has been life-changing for the teen. They&#39;ve taught him to ground himself during dangerous situations by focusing on his breathing and his normal human senses. This has allowed him to not just regain his lost abilities, but take them even further. His Venom Blast became a Venom Saber, a manifestation of his powers that he mentally forms into a sword. His Spider-Senses have returned with a vengeance, giving him the ability to see through walls and get a clearer picture of what kind of dangers he&#39;s dealing with.






 Miles Morales Is Developing New Spider-Man Powers Left and Right 
          

Miles has been growing by leaps and bounds in his control of his powers. His panic attacks are far less frequent, and he&#39;s been rolling with the punches pretty well during Marvel&#39;s Gang War, dealing with both mafia criminals and Cape Killers. He&#39;s even gone so far in his therapy that he can talk about other things than superhero abilities, like his friendships and his feelings. In a time when everyone is mad at Peter Parker for his many faults, Miles Morales is becoming the go-to Spider-Man in the Marvel Universe. There&#39;s no telling what new power Spider-Man will evolve next when Miles Morales makes sure to take care of himself first.
