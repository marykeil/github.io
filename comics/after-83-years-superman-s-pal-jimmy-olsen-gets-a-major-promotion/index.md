## Literature Review

After Superman is seriously injured, Lois Lane has to step aside from her duties at the Daily Planet, handing control over to Clarkâ€™s longtime pal.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Superman #9!Jimmy Olsen isn&#39;t just Superman&#39;s pal, he&#39;s now a head honcho at the Daily Planet. A crisis has come to Metropolis after the Man of Steel&#39;s most recent battle, and Lois Lane can&#39;t attend to her journalistic duties, leaving her to place the most unexpected person in charge of running the iconic paper.




In Superman #9 by Joshua Williamson and Bruno Redondo, Superman has been critically injured after his most recent battle with the Chained. With Superman in intensive care, Lois reads him letters from his biggest fans, all of them wishing him a speedy recovery from his life-threatening injury.



          

Unfortunately, Lois has to lie to Jimmy Olsen about where she and Clark are and tell him that she&#39;s on vacation. Jimmy reminds her that as Editor-in-Chief, the Planet needs Lois&#39; approval for tomorrow&#39;s paper. But to Jimmy&#39;s surprise, Lois hands the reins of the paper over to him (something that even surprises Lois).


 Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen is Now In Charge of the Daily Planet 
          




Metropolis&#39; most well-known newspaper has been through some dramatic changes in the last few months. Perry White, the long-serving Editor-in-Chief, took medical leave from his position after he suffered a psychic attack brought on by learning Superman&#39;s secret identity. Stepping up to replace him was the most seasoned reporter of the Daily Planet&#39;s staff, Lois Lane. Lois took her position seriously, cracking the whip to keep the paper running as well as it ever did. However, the villains Dr. Pharm and Mister Graft began dredging up the secret past of Metropolis, making running the newspaper much more of a headache than Lois ever thought it&#39;d be.

Not only is Jimmy Olsen one of the best photographers around, he&#39;s also a fantastic investigator and has assisted Superman and Lois with some truly complex cases. Sure, many may see him as Superman&#39;s goofy friend who just can&#39;t help but get himself in outrageous predicaments (lest anyone be reminded of his Turtle Man days). However, despite Lois&#39; misgivings about her decision, Jimmy is a fantastic journalist and someone who values the integrity of the paper. While his new position may just be temporary, this could be a test to see if Jimmy is ready for bigger responsibilities.






 Will Jimmy Olsen&#39;s New Job Become Permanent? 
          

Despite suspending his campaign, Perry White&#39;s given no indication he&#39;s heading back to run the Daily Planet again. And Lois has seemingly had her fill of being Editor-in-Chief given all the stresses that have come with it in times of crisis. While Lois only put Jimmy in charge while Clark was recuperating, this is a chance for him to rise to the occasion. Jimmy&#39;s wanted to move on to bigger and better things for a while now and now&#39;s his chance to show he can run the business he values so much. If Jimmy plays his cards right, Superman&#39;s pal could be in charge of the Daily Planet from now on.

Superman #9 is on sale now from DC Comics.
