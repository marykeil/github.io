## Literature Review

One of the DC Universe&#39;s most powerful villains, Darkseid has played a role in several major stories. Here are the Lord of Apokolips&#39; biggest moments.




As one of the most formidable opponents for any hero in the DC Universe, Darkseid&#39;s impact over the course of its history is undeniable. Darkseid first made his debut back in 1970 as one of Jack Kirby&#39;s key creations. More than 50 years later, the king of Apokolips continues to endure the test of time as one of DC&#39;s most dangerous antagonists. From the moment he first appeared on-panel (more on that later), there were teases for big plans on the horizon for the character. Since then, he&#39;s been portrayed as the Big Bad of the DC Universe, practically the final boss in the majority of DC&#39;s major events.
In being depicted as such a major threat to the DC Universe, Darkseid has also managed to affect the course of the universe&#39;s wider lore and history in substantial ways. If Darkseid never existed, many of DC&#39;s heroes and most pivotal moments would either never have happened or have been substantially different. The following appearances are some of the most important moments in the history of the character and, by proxy, some of the most significant events in DC&#39;s history overall.









 








 10  Darkseid&#39;s First Appearance 
Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen Vol. 1 #134 (1970)
        

The debut of Darkseid takes place on the final page of Superman&#39;s Pal Jimmy Olsen #134 by Jack Kirby and Vince Colletta. Darkseid is featured on one panel in which he speaks on an intercom to his underling, Morgan Edge, all while alluding to future plans of his. It doesn&#39;t reveal much about Darkseid or his plans, but as a first impression, he is immediately established as an intimidating, looming presence in the background of the DC Universe that he continues to be. In one panel and one bubble of dialogue from him, the New God is immediately positioned as a top-tier villain.





 9  Anti-Life Introduced 
Forever People #5 (1971)
        

The Anti-Life Equation defines the bulk of Darkseid&#39;s mission statement, with most of his motivations and desires being driven by his need for it. Anti-Life is first introduced in Forever People #5 by Jack Kirby, Vince Colletta, and John Costanza. Forever People as a series in general is essential to the early character building of Darkseid, not only by giving readers his first full appearance outside of the aforementioned cameo, but by introducing many of the ideas that would forever be associated with him. Forever People introduces ideas like the Mother Boxes and, of course, the Anti-Life Equation, which Beautiful Dreamer describes as giving anyone who holds it &#34;absolute control over you.&#34;

 8  Suli Dies 
New Gods Vol. 3 #8 (1989)
        

Suli ranks among one of the most important influences on Darkseid&#39;s life, if not arguably the most important. Introduced in New Gods #8 by Mark Evanier, Paris Cullins, Will Blyberg, Gene D&#39;Angelo, Bob Pinaha, Jonathan Peterson, and Mike Carlin, Suli is a scientist on Apokolips. She and Darkseid fall in love, and if it&#39;s hard to believe how someone like Darkseid is capable of love, her death is the reason why his heart is cold now. His love for her even briefly has him reconsider his ambitions of ruling over the galaxy. Unfortunately, after the birth of their child Kalibak, Darkseid&#39;s mother Heggra has Suli poisoned under the impression she makes her son weak. With Suli&#39;s death, Darkseid&#39;s heart is instantly filled with anger, hate, and bitterness in a way that he still hasn&#39;t recovered from.





 7  Yuga Khan Returns 
New Gods Vol. 3 #17 (1990)


 







Speaking of Darkseid&#39;s family lineage, his father is an even more domineering presence over his life. In fact, Yuga Khan may be one of the few people in the universe whom Darkseid is actually afraid of. There was once a time when Yuga Khan was considered the most feared and the most powerful New God on Apokolips until he was one day trapped behind the Source Wall. As a testament to his power, he finally does return from it eventually in New Gods #17 by Mark Evanier, Paris Cullins, Will Blyberg, Gene D&#39;Angelo, Bob Pinaha, Jonathan Peterson, and Mike Carlin. Not approving of his son ruling in his absence, he disposes of Darkseid with ease to reclaim what he believes is his. Darkseid never gets his comeuppance either, as Yuga Khan&#39;s stubbornness leads to him being trapped behind the Source Wall again. Back in power, Darkseid&#39;s quest for power is motivated largely by the knowledge that he needs to be stronger than at least one other man who embarrassed him.





 6  Darkseid Swaps Orion for Mister Miracle 
New Gods Vol. 1 #7 (1972)
        

Mister Miracle is originally the biological son of the Highfather on New Genesis, while Orion is one of Darkseid&#39;s sons on Apokolips. As part of a peace treaty between the two planets made when the boys are children, Highfather and Darkseid agree to swap and raise their respective children. Orion discovering his true parentage proves to be a thorn in his side and one that continues to define him as a character. Much of his upbringing unknowingly prepares Orion for keeping the bottled up rage within him under wraps, but just knowing he has Darkseid in his blood is enough to make it boil every time they meet.





 5  Meeting Lex Luthor 
Action Comics Annual Vol. 1 #13 (2011)
        

Action Comics Annual #13 by Phil Cornell, Marco Rudy, Val Staples, and John J. Hill depicts a previously unseen, secret adventure of Lex Luthor set long before Clark Kent even became Superman. A young Lex Luthor is kidnapped by a mysterious alien that he&#39;d come to know as Darkseid. For six weeks, he is embarrassed on an emotional and psychological level that puts into perspective his hatred for Superman, and aliens in general. Lex&#39;s first encounter with an alien makes him feel small, not only knowing how dangerous this one otherworldly foe could be, but how superior they can be over humanity. It&#39;s no wonder he&#39;s so wary of aliens once the Man of Steel surfaces in Metropolis.





 4  Meeting Superman 
Superman Vol. 2 #3 (1987)


 







Speaking of hating Superman, the Man of Steel may arguably be Darkseid&#39;s most definitive adversary and vice versa. The first of what would prove to be many face-offs between the two began in Superman Vol. 2 #3 by John Byrne, Terry Austin, Tom Ziuko, John Constanza, and Andrew Helfer. They then have their first official fight with each other in Action Comics #586 by John Byrne, Dick Giordano, Tom Ziuko, John Costanza, and Andrew Helfer. If there were ever two enemies who were destined to duke it out forever, it would be these two contrasting forces of pure power.





 3  Joining the Justice League 
Justice League Odyssey (2018) &amp; DCeased: War of the Undead Gods #7 (2023)
        

Despite his brutal history with Superman alone (never mind the rest of the DC Universe), Darkseid has joined the Justice League on not one, but two occasions. The first comes in Justice League Odyssey, the 25-part series by Joshua Williamson and Stjepan Šejić pairing Darkseid with Starfire, Cyborg, Azrael, and Jessica Cruz&#39;s Green Lantern in perhaps the most unlikely Justice League team ever. They join forces to investigate a mysterious Ghost Sector in space, although the alliance is short-lived when Darkseid inevitably betrays them. Elsewhere in the multiverse, during DCeased: War of the Undead Gods by Tom Taylor, Trevor Hairsine, and Lucas Meyer, Superman and the Yellow Lantern Darkseid let bygones be bygones to join forces when the world needs them on the same page.





 2  Darkseid is Killed and Reborn 
Justice League Vol. 2 #44 (2015) &amp; #50 (2016)
        

The Darkseid War arc sees the death of Darkseid at the hands of the Black Racer in Justice League Vol. 2 #44 by Geoff Johns, Jason Fabok, and Brad Anderson. Given all the evil he is capable of, the evil he has committed, and will forever continue to commit, one would think Darkseid&#39;s death would be a good thing for the entire universe, but no. The rest of the arc goes to show just what killing him would mean for the universe, as it all falls in line with the Anti-Monitor&#39;s bigger plans, as well as corrupting all of DC&#39;s heroes to boot. It ultimately resolves when Darkseid&#39;s daughter, Grail, uses an ancient ritual to bring him back to life, albeit as a baby. The entire arc serves to kickstart a new Rebirth for DC, and Darkseid, in more ways than one.





 1  Darkseid Meets His Final Crisis 
Final Crisis #7 (2009)


 







Out of all the evil plans he has hatched, the Final Crisis event by Grant Morrison, J.G. Jones, Carlos Pacheco, and Doug Mahnke is the closest that Darkseid comes to conquering the universe for himself. It gets bad enough that when the entirety of the universe is at stake with the heroes&#39; backs against the wall, Batman must break his one rule to set the stage for Darkseid&#39;s defeat: use a gun. Darkseid seemingly kills Batman in the same breath (though it&#39;s revealed he has instead sent him back in time as an actual ticking time bomb). But after being mortally wounded by one Radion bullet, the rest of the heroes successfully finish the job to end Darkseid&#39;s reign of terror.
