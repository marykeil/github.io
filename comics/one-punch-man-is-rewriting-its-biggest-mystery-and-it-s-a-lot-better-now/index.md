# One-Punch Man Is Rewriting Its Biggest Mystery (And It s A Lot Better Now)


## SUMMARY 



  Blast&#39;s revelation about his former partner and the Ninja Village ties the current arc to the overarching God storyline, providing a clearer connection to the story.   The involvement of Blast and his past battles with his partner add depth to the Ninja Village arc, expanding on the leader&#39;s character and showcasing the corrupting influence of God.   These changes create opportunities for further development of the God storyline and Blast as a character, making the One-Punch Man manga&#39;s new take on the arc intriguing.

## Literature Review

Major changes in One-Punch Man&#39;s latest arc have radically improved the mysteries surrounding both the Ninja Village and the being called God.




Warning: Spoilers for One-Punch Man Ch. #196 (JP)/#194 (EN)Chapter #196 of One-Punch Man has revealed a lot of new information, courtesy of the #1 hero, Blast, and this information represents a major change from the webcomic--but one that&#39;s indisputably for the best. Blast&#39;s information ties the current Ninja Village arc to the overarching God storyline in a way the webcomic never did, bringing these elements together to form a clearer story.




In chapter #196, Blast explains to Saitama and Flashy Flash that he once had a partner--a ninja by the name of Empty Void. Empty Void had been helping Blast to hunt for the cubes which are related to God, but betrayed him and formed a pact with God, monsterizing and reaching far greater power levels than he had before.

          

He founded the Ninja Village, and began training young assassins such as Flashy Flash and Speed-o&#39;-Sound Sonic, to do his bidding. Blast and Empty Void battled it out 15 years ago, ending with the Ninja Village founder badly injured and forced into recovering in hiding ever since.


 Blast&#39;s Involvement Changes The Ninja Village Arc Radically 
          




Originally, neither Blast nor the God plot were involved in the webcomic version of the Ninja Village arc. Blast actually appeared much earlier in the manga than he did in the webcomic, which set the stage for his involvement in the plot here. Not only does this help to actually tie-in what&#39;s going on with the Ninja Village to the greater story arc, but it also finally reveals some aspects of Blast&#39;s past, what he has been up to and how long he&#39;s been at it. The Hero Association itself is only a few years old, so for Blast to have been battling his former partner 15 years ago, they must have been on the trail of God for quite a long time by now.

This also expands on the Ninja Village&#39;s leader quite significantly. In the webcomic, he had no connection with Blast at all, other than their fight. Making the Ninja Village&#39;s leader into Blast&#39;s former partner is an interesting twist, as it suggests that even the powerful people that Blast has come to rely upon can be corrupted by God&#39;s influence. It explains why Blast is so invested in collecting these cubes as well, as if even a powerful and presumably righteous person like his partner could fall, then anyone can, and the chances for that to happen must be minimized. It also gives Blast a reason to be personally involved in this, rather than it simply being another mission against God.




How these changes will ripple out through the rest of the story arc will be interesting to see; the webcomic&#39;s original ending for the Ninja Village&#39;s leader is hilarious, but not necessarily narratively satisfying. Further development of the God storyline is definitely important here, and finding out more about what drove the Ninja Village leader to accept God&#39;s power could be very revealing. This also gives the story a chance to develop Blast more as a character, since he ends the chapter leaving with Saitama. The One-Punch Man manga&#39;s new take on the Ninja Village story arc could be very interesting thanks to these big changes from the webcomic.
