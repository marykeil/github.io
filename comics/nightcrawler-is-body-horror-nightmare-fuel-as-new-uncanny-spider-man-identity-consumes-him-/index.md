# Nightcrawler Is Body-Horror Nightmare Fuel as New  Uncanny Spider-Man  Identity Consumes Him 


## SUMMARY 



  Nightcrawler&#39;s new identity as Uncanny Spider-Man is meant to be an escape from his problems, but it ends up becoming just as nightmarish as what he&#39;s trying to escape.   Peach Momoko&#39;s nightmarish redesign of Nightcrawler emphasizes his worm-based codename, with a mouth resembling a worm and a chest covered in writhing tentacles.   Uncanny Spider-Man #5 releases December 20 from Marvel Comics

## Literature Review

Nightcrawler has become Spider-Man to run from his problems, but a new cover shows a version of Kurt as Spidey who’s more monstrous than ever 




Nightcrawler has recently taken up the identity of the Uncanny Spider-Man to get away from a world that hates and fears him more than ever, but now Marvel is imagining a reality where this new identity eats him alive. Peach Momoko’s nightmare Nightcrawler is an expertly horrific twist on both Kurt and Spidey, and yet another stunning redesign from an artist who continues to go from strength to strength.




During the latest X-Men era, Fall of X, Nightcrawler has taken up the mantle of Spider-Man in Uncanny Spider-Man (written by Si Spurrier, drawn by Lee Garbett, colored by Matt Milla and lettered by VC’s Joe Caramagna). In Spurrier’s previous X-Book, Legion of X, Kurt was mind-controlled into killing numerous world leaders by his adoptive mother, the sorceress Margoli Szardos, working at the behest of the anti-mutant group ORCHIS. The killings have left him one of the world&#39;s most wanted men.

          

Becoming Spider-Man is supposed to be an escape for Kurt, a way to do good in a new identity divorced from mutant problems. However, both the outside world and Kurt’s own conscience are telling him that he can’t just leave the fight so easily.

Marvel&#39;s Nightmare Covers Reinvent Its Heroes in Terrifying Ways

 

Now, fan-favorite writer and artist Peach Momoko has drawn a nightmarish version of Nightcrawler’s new Spider-Man look for her horror-inspired Uncanny Spider-Man #5 variant cover, part of her series of &#39;Nightmare&#39; covers, releasing over December. Momoko’s horrific version of Kurt emphasizes the worm-based codename of Nightcrawler like never before, with his mouth closer to the circular mouth of a worm and his chest a seemingly writhing mass of tentacles. The horror of this look is only reinforced by the fact that Momoko makes Kurt’s Spider-Man costume part of his skin, which is translucent in parts to reveal the pulsing veins beneath. Nightmare variant covers will release as follows:

 Peach Momoko Nightmare Variant Covers   December 6  Alpha Flight #5   Avengers #8   Blade #6   Daredevil #4   Fantastic Four #14   Sentry #1   Spider-Gwen: Smash #1   Thunderbolts #1   Venom #28   X-Men #29   December 13  Captain America #4   Immortal Thor #5   Luke Cage: Gang War #2   Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13   Moon Knight #30   Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #4   December 20  Amazing Spider-Man #40   Doctor Strange #10   Incredible Hulk #7   Uncanny Spider-Man #5   Wolverine #40   December 27  Black Panther #7   Captain Marvel #3   Carnage #2   Spider-Woman #2   Timeless #1   






There’s a great irony in turning Kurt’s Spider-Man look into something horrific. The whole point of Kurt’s disguise is to get away from both his mutant identity and specifically from his look as Nightcrawler, demonized after ORCHIS’ manipulation. While Spidey has his downswings as well, he’s generally a more popular hero, beloved by regular folk, and Uncanny Spider-Man #1 (by Spurrier, Garbett, Milla and Caramagna) shows a Spider-Man fan website where Kurt’s new identity becomes immediately popular. Momoko’s redesign corrupts Kurt’s escape from his problems, turning the identity into something just as nightmarish as the image he&#39;s trying to escape.



 A Horror-Inspired Nightcrawler Could Be a Reality Soon Enough 
Peach Momoko&#39;s Upcoming Ultimate X-Men Could Transform Kurt Wagner


          

With Peach Momoko’s upcoming work on Marvel&#39;s relaunched Ultimate X-Men, it’s not unimaginable that a similar version of Nightcrawler could exist in an actual story. The series’ first preview has already given fans a look at how the series will use body horror with Armor. If Momoko wants to take the Ultimate X-Men in this horror direction, then Nightcrawler would be an obvious choice. The first thing most people notice about Nightcrawler is that he looks like a demon, and even if readers know that the man underneath is just as heroic as Spider-Man, the Ultimate Universe may choose to deviate from this long-held truth.
