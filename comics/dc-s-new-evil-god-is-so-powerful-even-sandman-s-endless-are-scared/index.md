## Literature Review

John Constantine: Hellblazer - Dead in America #1 kicks off with the introduction of a new malicious deity that even the all-powerful Endless fear.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for John Constantine, Hellblazer: Dead in America #1!




The Sandman&#39;s Endless are known as some of the most powerful entities in the DC universe; however, John Constantine’s new ongoing Hellblazer series may be shaking up the deity hierarchy with the addition of a new malicious god. This formidable newcomer is so powerful that it evokes fear even in Dream, one of the seven Endless, yet Constantine is set to confront this deity head-on.

In John Constantine: Hellblazer - Dead in America #1, Si Spurrier and Aaron Campbell seamlessly pick up from their previous Hellblazer installment, thrusting Constantine into a narrative where he&#39;s wanted for murder in London and decides the best way to confront this issue is going on the run in America.



          

This fugitive status sets him on a collision course with both familiar and unfamiliar deities and demons, one of which is a malevolent force that takes the form of a girl scout. However, looks can be deceiving, as it is later revealed in the issue that even the formidable Dream fears this unnamed, up-and-coming god.





 Dream of the Endless Enlists Constantine to Help Defeat New God 
          

Constantine&#39;s initial encounter with the girl scout occurs when she abruptly barges into and disrupts a negotiation meeting between him and another demon. Right from the start, the girl scout establishes that she is more than she appears, demonstrating an unsettling level of knowledge about Constantine and seemingly having insight into his personal thoughts and motivations. She then effortlessly exorcises the other demon with a display of fiery power. When John asks about her identity and motives, she provides a cryptic response, stating, &#34;Y’all just think of me ‘n’ my kin as your hostesses,&#34; before then expressing her motivations as just wanting to &#34;get a good look&#34; at him.

It&#39;s only later, during a confrontation with Dream, that Constantine grasps the magnitude of the threat posed by the girl scout. Dream reveals that something &#34;obscene has slithered into America,&#34; and he tasks John with rectifying the situation since he&#39;s already so conveniently in America. Constantine queries why Dream wouldn&#39;t personally handle the situation. This leads him to the realization that the Endless member harbors fear towards the girl scout, a revelation Dream doesn&#39;t deny. The implication of Dream being reluctant to confront this new god and her kin suggests they are possibly even more powerful than Dream and his siblings.




                  John Constantine: Hellblazer - Dead in America #1 Just Launched 2024&#39;s Best Comic Series (Review)   Spurrier and Campbell&#39;s new Hellblazer series is as darkly gorgeous as it is entrancingly entertaining, making it DC&#39;s best ongoing comic run.   



 John Constantine May Prove He’s More Powerful Than a God 
          

In the Sandman Universe, Dream and his Endless siblings reign supreme as the most powerful beings. However, Dream&#39;s conspicuous choice of inaction against the girl scout and her kin, despite his expressed desire to eliminate them, is extremely telling. It implies that Dream recognizes a credible threat in these emerging entities, with the potential to surpass even the might of the Endless. Hence, should Constantine successfully eliminate these entities, he will ascend to a level of power surpassing even the Endless, having achieved a feat they didn&#39;t dare attempt. This would be a huge boon for John Constantine&#39;s character, effectively making him a god-killer in the Sandman Universe.
