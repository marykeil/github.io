## Literature Review

The Justice League has been busy saving the world and making babies! Here are ten in-continuity kids poised to lead DC&#39;s next generation of heroes.




Dawn of DC has brought a plethora of Justice League offspring who are ready to inherit the mantle from their iconic parents. Fan-favorites like Superman&#39;s son, Jon Kent, and the once-assassin turned Robin, Damian Wayne, lead the charge. Yet, the roster has expanded to include emerging powerhouses like Irey &#34;Thunderheart&#34; West and the princesses of Atlantis and Themyscira, Andy Curry and Lizzie Prince. These young heroes are the future of DC.
Despite DC&#39;s penchant for Crises, the Justice League&#39;s most iconic members—Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and others—have somehow found time for love and baby-making. Thankfully for the world, these romantic escapades have left DC with a surplus of legacy heroes ready to tackle the challenges of future generations. This list ranks ten standout hero offspring based on their likelihood to take the reins and lead the next generation of heroes.









 








 10  Lian Harper AKA Cheshire Cat 
Daughter of Roy Harper (Arsenal) and Jade Nguyen (Cheshire)
        

Lian Harper finds herself on the lower end of the list primarily because she was dead for a significant portion of continuity. She is currently in the process of rediscovering herself after being estranged from her family and deceased. Lian is navigating the complexities of finding her path in life.
Her endeavors have focused on reuniting with her father, Roy Harper, and carving out a space for herself as a hero. At this juncture, Cheshire&#39;s attention is understandably directed toward reclaiming her life and determining her role in the world, making her unlikely to take on the mantle of leading the upcoming generation of heroes.





 9  Anissa Pierce AKA Thunder 
Daughter of Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning) and Lynn Stewart
        

Anissa&#39;s suitability as a leader is questionable, given her portrayal as less than an ideal team player in comic narratives. Effective leadership entails a seamless ability to collaborate within a team, a quality Thunder occasionally lacks.
In The Other History of the DC Universe#5 by John Ridley, Giussepe Camuncoli, Andrea Cucci, and Jose Villarrubia, it is revealed that Anissa&#39;s motivation for joining the Outsiders was solely to antagonize her father. This revelation underscores a lack of maturity on her part, a factor that could have had dire consequences, potentially endangering her teammates and civilians, as she joined the team for personal rather than altruistic reasons.





 8  Maxine Baker AKA Animal Woman 
Daughter of Buddy Baker (Animal Man) and Ellen Baker
        

Though Maxine Baker has been teased to possess even greater power than her father, Animal Man, she finds herself at the lower end of the list due to her limited exposure in comics. The scant page time dedicated to Maxine has made it challenging to gauge the extent of her leadership potential.
In recent comic appearances, she often takes on the role of a tag-along, aligning herself with other super-powered youths like Irey West. While this doesn&#39;t discount Maxine&#39;s inherent leadership capabilities, fans have yet to witness them in action. The hope lingers that DC will rectify this narrative oversight, allowing Maxine to shine and reveal the depth of her untapped leadership potential.





 7  Connor Hawke AKA Green Arrow 
Son of Oliver Queen (Green Arrow) and Sandra Hawke
        

Connor Hawke&#39;s journey has mirrored that of Damian Wayne, with both emerging from the League of Shadows to carve their own paths as heroes. Despite his extensive character development, Connor&#39;s potential for leadership hasn&#39;t been spotlighted with a definitive &#34;wow&#34; moment in comics.
He has demonstrated his ability to collaborate with other heroes, forming connections with figures like Tim Drake and Lian Harper. However, Connor&#39;s leadership prowess remains somewhat obscured, partially attributed to his decade-long absence from comics. His erasure from continuity during DC&#39;s reboots withFlashpoint and the New 52 events has left a void in showcasing the full extent of his leadership potential.





 6  Jai West AKA Surge 
Son of Wally West (Flash) and Linda Park
        

While Jai West undeniably stands out with powers that extend beyond the typical Flash Family abilities, specifically superhuman strength, these unique attributes may not necessarily position him as the ideal candidate to lead the next generation of heroes. The spotlight, in terms of leadership potential, appears to gravitate toward his outgoing and driven twin sister, Irey.
Both Flash siblings are esteemed heroes in their own right, but Irey frequently assumes the lead role between the two. She is also recognized as the fastest Flash in continuity. As a result, it&#39;s plausible that Jai would willingly defer to his sister when leadership positions come into play.





 5  Jonathan “Jon” Kent AKA Superman 
Son of Clark Kent (Superman) and Lois Lane


 







Jon is positioned lower on the list not due to a lack of leadership potential, but simply because there are stronger candidates to helm the next generation of heroes. Being Superman&#39;s son, Jon naturally exhibits significant leadership qualities, having already stepped into his father&#39;s formidable shoes by taking up the Superman mantle for himself.
However, his character has been predominantly portrayed as a follower rather than a leader, often deferring to Damian Wayne and yielding to his guidance. Notable instances in works like Super Sons and DCeased showcase their close collaboration, with Damian consistently assuming the leadership role while Jon provides steadfast support to his best friend.





 4  Iris “Irey” West II AKA Thunderheart 
Daughter of Wally West (Flash) and Linda Park


 







Irey West has emerged as a rising star in the DC Universe, and it&#39;s only fitting to consider her a formidable contender for the role of the Justice League&#39;s next leader. Despite her youth and ongoing development, Irey displays immense potential. Moreover, she appears on the trajectory to become one of DC&#39;s most powerful metahumans. 
The Flash (2023) #4, by Si Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., and Trish Mulvihill, hints at a power upgrade for Irey, elevating her status even further. This potential is substantiated in The Flash #771, where a future version of Irey boasts a heightened connection to the Speed Force, surpassing even the modern-day Flash.





 3  Andrina &#34;Andy&#34; Curry AKA Aquawoman 
Daughter of Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Mera
        

While Andy Curry&#39;s relatively short stint in the DC Universe might raise eyebrows regarding her high placement on this list, her deserving position is evident. The Future State comic event highlights Andy&#39;s ability to collaborate effectively with other superheroes, showcasing her potential for strong teamwork.
Additionally, growing up under the guidance of her parents, the king and queen of Atlantis, offers Andy valuable lessons in leadership. However, she won&#39;t bear the weight of the throne on her shoulders since Arthur and Mera successfully fought to end the monarchy of Atlantis. This liberation of duty frees up the princess to redirect her capabilities toward leading the next generation of DC heroes.





 2  Elizabeth &#34;Lizzie&#34; Prince AKA Trinity 
Daughter of Diana Prince (Wonder Woman), Father Unknown
        

With DC outright confirming that Trinity will lead the Justice League in the future, it&#39;s clear that Lizzie possesses the essential qualities for an outstanding leader, a trait not surprising given who her mother is. As a relatively recent addition to the DC Universe, fans are still in the dark about many aspects of Trinity&#39;s character, a gap that her upcoming solo series is anticipated to fill.
&#34;I am Elizabeth Marston Prince. Champion of the Amazons. Leader of the Justice League. Daughter of Diana. And the first holder of the three Lassos of Fate.&#34; - Wonder Woman #800 by Tom King, Daniel Sampere, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. 

Trinity is second only to Damian Wayne on this list, as her status within DC&#39;s primary continuity remains unconfirmed. However, she could very well surpass him if DC decides to solidify her place within continuity.





 1  Damian Wayne AKA Robin 
Son of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Talia al Ghul


 







Once relegated to the bottom tier regarding leadership potential, Damian Wayne has undergone matchless character growth that puts him at the top of this list. Damian&#39;s conscious choice to shed his past as an assassin and embrace goodness reflects a remarkable level of character strength that transcends mere innate virtue. Despite possessing the capability to be a formidable force of darkness, he consistently opts for heroism.
Additionally, his role as a true leader is exemplified in comics such as DCeased by Tom Taylor and Trevor Hairsine,where he sacrifices himself to save the universe. Damian&#39;s unparalleled heroic journey makes him the top choice to lead DC&#39;s nextJustice League.
