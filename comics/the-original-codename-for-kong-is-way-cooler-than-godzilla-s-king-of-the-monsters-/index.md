# The Original Codename for Kong Is Way Cooler Than Godzilla s  King of the Monsters 


## SUMMARY 



  Kong&#39;s original MonsterVerse codename is &#39;The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death&#39;, illustrating his wrath and power as an untouchable god.   Kong&#39;s backstory reveals his role as the ruthless protector of Skull Island, with his roar signialing the death of any creature he desires.   Comparatively, Godzilla&#39;s title as &#39;King of the Monsters&#39; suggests his strength, but Kong&#39;s codename is way cooler, portraying him as a supernatural force of impending doom.

## Literature Review

Godzilla is famously called the King of the Monsters within MonsterVerse continuity, and while that title is cool, it&#39;s nothing compared to Kong&#39;s! 




‘King of the Monsters’ is Godzilla’s official title and codename in the MonsterVerse continuity, and while it’s an unarguably awesome one given the level of superiority and domination it implies, it’s nowhere near as cool as Kong’s original MonsterVerse codename. While Kong’s codename doesn’t convey that he’s a King (ironically enough, given his well-noted ‘King Kong’ moniker), it does present Kong as a bringer of death on a scale that can only be personified by nothing short of an ancient god.




Long before his existence was made known to the world in Godzilla vs Kong, Kong lived on Skull Island, and was worshiped by the indigenous people who lived there. Not only that, but Kong was entangled in an age-old war between his species and the Skullcrawlers, all the while keeping the plethora of other monstrous Titans on his island in-check.

          

Kong’s history stretches back much further than the day Monarch discovered him (then subsequently kept him a secret) in Kong: Skull Island, as his influence has touched generations of humans living on Skull Island, given his role on the island itself. Some saw him as a benevolent protector, though others saw him in a much more wrathful light, and his original codename illustrates that in the most badass way possible: ‘The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death’.




                  &#34;It Makes Him Invincible&#34;: Kong&#39;s MonsterVerse Origin Reveals Why He&#39;s So Powerful   Kong&#39;s origin within the MonsterVerse exposes why he&#39;s such a powerful Titan, as well as his shocking connection to Skull Island&#39;s Titan War.   


 Kong’s Original MonsterVerse Codename Is ‘The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death’ 
         

In the four-part miniseries Skull Island: The Birth Of Kong by Barnaby Legg, Arvid Nelson, and Zid, readers are given Kong’s full backstory. When a team of explorers goes to Skull Island to learn the truth about what manner of threats to the planet actually exist there - and if Kong alone can handle them all (or is one himself) - they are taken in by the island’s indigenous people, who share with them the history of Kong and his entire species.

It’s shown in detail how Kong’s species fought a great war against the Skullcrawlers, how Kong’s parents were the last two of their kind, and how Kong himself was born during the final battle between the apes and the Skullcrawlers before the creatures were awakened once more during the events of Kong: Skull Island. Born of war and a witness to the death of his entire species, Kong was hardened at an early age, and he carried that strength with him as the ruthless protector of his island. Anytime his roar was heard by the island’s ancient humans, death would follow any creature Kong wanted dead, earning this great Titan the title of ‘The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death’.






 Godzilla’s Title Identifies A King, Kong’s Is Fit For A God 
          

‘The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death’ is a title that immediately gives one the impression of impending doom, the likes of which is totally unavoidable for those caught in its wake. Like a Lovecraftian Old One, the will of The-Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death is utterly absolute and terrifyingly unstoppable. The codename makes Kong’s wrath feel supernatural, like that of an immortal god, whereas Godzilla’s ‘King of the Monsters’ title - while well-earned - just makes him sound like he’s the strongest monster on the planet, and is thereby outclassed by the seemingly otherworldly ‘Mountain-Who-Thunders-Death’.

While Godzilla is arguably stronger than Kong (proven true during their matchups in Godzilla vs Kong), their respective titles alone make it sound like Kong is an untouchable god able to bring death upon those who hear his roar, and Godzilla is simply a really strong monster. For this reason, it’s fair to say that MonsterVerse’s original codename for Kong is way cooler than Godzilla’s ‘King of the Monsters’.
