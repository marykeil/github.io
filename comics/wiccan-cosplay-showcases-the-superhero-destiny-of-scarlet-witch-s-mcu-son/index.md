## Literature Review

Wanda Maximoff&#39;s son Wiccan is a fan-favorite comic book character; cosplayer Marc Scherwin&#39;s artful depiction shows why he should join the MCU ASAP.




Cosplayer Marc Scherwin (@elegantfeatherduster) debuted an Omega-level Wiccan cosplay at this year&#39;s Dragon Con, giving attendees and fans on Instagram alike a look at what a full-grown, fully-empowered MCU version of Scarlet Witch&#39;s son could look like, once he&#39;s ready to embrace his destiny as a central part of the next generation of on-screen Marvel superheroes.




Scherwin&#39;s Wiccan is full-on levitating in the photo shared to Instagram, with the character&#39;s red cape majestically rising upward, in an incredible shot credited to photographer and fellow cosplayer Maddi (@final_egirl).


 

Scherwin perfectly articulates what a live-action Wiccan should, and can, look like when the adult version of the character invariably makes his way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Giving some insight into the production of the photo, Marc Scherwin noted, &#34;I&#39;ve never done a jumping, cape flip photo before,&#34; calling the finished product &#34;a BANGER way to kick off the tradition.&#34; Scherwin also credited partner Vic (@vicious.frockery) with, &#34;off-screen cape flipping, forever cheerleading my builds, and also being the Teddy to my Billy,&#34; referring to Wiccan&#39;s longtime boyfriend, the Kree/Skrull Emperor Hulkling. Together, Wiccan and Hulkling are perhaps Marvel Comics&#39; most enduring, iconic queer couple, making the characters vital to the future of the company. Scherwin&#39;s Wiccan cosplay is a perfectly achieved tribute to the character, in the process giving a sense of what the character will look like in the MCU.




The son of powerful mutant and Avengers member Scarlet Witch, Wiccan debuted in 2005&#39;s Young Avengers title – written by Allen Heinberg, with art by Jim Cheung – and in subsequent years has risen to prominence, both as a fan-favorite character a character that has yet to achieve his greatest potential, though he is sure to in time. MCU viewers were introduced to the character, albeit as a child, and an illusion created by his mother Wanda Maximoff, in 2021&#39;s WandaVision. Wanda&#39;s appearance in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness the next year, however, revealed real versions of her children exist in the multiverse, and even teased adult Wiccan&#39;s appearance.
