## Literature Review

As Superman is overtaken by maniacal laughter, Lois Lane, Metropolis, and the Man of Steel are all corrupted by an upgraded villain.




Warning: contains spoilers for Action Comics #1061!As Superman bursts into involuntary laughter, the Man of Steel just became his own version of the infamous &#39;Batman Who Laughs&#39; - an evil Batman from a world where Joker managed to brainwash Bruce Wayne. Now, Clark Kent is suffering the same fate, as his dark opposite attacks not just his mind, but that of Lois Lane and the whole of Metropolis.




After Bizarro&#39;s world is destroyed due to the endless Crisis events that DC goes through, Bizarro decides to attack Metropolis and Superman. This darker version of Bizarro ends up using powerful magic to transform Metropolis into a bizarro version of itself.

          

The citizens of Metropolis who used to love Superman become frantic in their desire to destroy him, and it seems like the spell extends to Superman himself, with Lois referring to the hero as &#34;Bizarro Number One.&#34; As the citizens of Metropolis are transformed, Superman ends up in a fit of maniacal laughter, as seen in Action Comics #1061 by Jason Aaron, John Timms, Rex Lokus, and Dave Sharpe.

                  Superman&#39;s Silliest Villain Just Became His Most Tragic   Bizarro&#39;s characteristic backward nature becomes tragic instead of goofy when the villain is portrayed as a victim of brain damage.   





 Superman&#39;s Mind Has Been Twisted by Bizarro 
Bizarro Has Infected Metropolis With His Hatred of Superman


          

Bizarro has long been an &#39;opposite&#39; version of Superman - a dull-witted villain with a version of the Man of Steel&#39;s powers. However, after his homeworld was seemingly lost due to DC&#39;s Crisis events, Bizarro found himself on a world rich in magical power. It turns out that Superman&#39;s weakness to magic manifests in Bizarro as the ability to absorb it, giving him a huge mystic upgrade. Combined with his rage over his missing home, that spells trouble for Superman.

The spell that Bizarro cast has seemingly transformed every citizen in Metropolis into a Bizarro version of themselves, with their love of Superman turned into rabid hatred. After the spell is cast, Superman remarks several times that he can hear Bizzaro inside his head, before eventually being overcome by his laughter. Even Lois becoming a Bizarro opposite only makes Superman laugh harder. With a villainous grin on his face, it seems like Bizarro may have found a way to flip Superman&#39;s moral code - right as the entirety of Metropolis has been set up to provoke him.




          

Superman is one of the brightest and most hopeful characters in the DC Universe, but as Bizarro&#39;s spell flips the deepest feelings of Metropolis&#39; citizens, the entire city just became a weapon against Superman - including his beloved wife. Superman&#39;s biggest weakness has always been magic, and now he&#39;s going to have to find a way to both free the citizens of Metropolis from Bizarro&#39;s dark magic and also free himself from the villain&#39;s influence. With Superman being one of the kindest and greatest heroes in the DC Universe, a true opposite version of him would be an absolutely terrifying thing for the world of DC to deal with - and it seems like that&#39;s what Bizarro just unleashed.
