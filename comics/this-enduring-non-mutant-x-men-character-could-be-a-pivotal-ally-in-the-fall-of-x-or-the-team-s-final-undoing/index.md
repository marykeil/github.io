# This Enduring Non-Mutant X-Men Character Could Be a Pivotal Ally In the Fall of X (Or the Team s Final Undoing)


## SUMMARY 



  Danger, the sentient incarnation of the Danger Room, is currently working against the mutant nation of Krakoa due to their ban on artificial intelligence.   Danger has the potential to be a gamechanging character in the upcoming climax of the Krakoan era, as she possesses valuable knowledge about the strengths and weaknesses of the X-Men.   The X-Men have the opportunity to either make amends with Danger and convince her to join their cause, or she could be crucial to Orchis&#39;s annihilation of mutantkind, allying herself with other dangerous artificial intelligences inside the villainous organization. Her decision could determine the outcome of the conflict.

## Literature Review

One forgotten X-Men ally-turned-enemy-turned-hero could prove to be pivotal to saving the team from Orchis – or could author their final destruction.




One long-time X-Men character – whose role has changed dramatically in the years since their first introduction, and who has been both an antagonist and an ally to the team over the years – still has time to play a pivotal role in the future of the X-franchise; it&#39;s possible that Danger, the personification of the Danger Room, could be an essential part of the climax to mutantkind&#39;s Krakoan era.




Wolverine (2020) #20 – by the creative team of Ben Percy, Adam Kubert, Frank Martin, and Dijo Lima – revealed the sentient incarnation of the X-Men’s iconic Danger Room to be working for the CIA, and potentially Orchis, against Krakoa, following her exile from the mutant nation in Sabretooth #4 – by Victor LaValle, Leonard Kirk, Rain Beredo, and Cory Petit – due to their laws against artificial intelligence.

          

Danger has the potential to be a gamechanging character during the upcoming Fall of the House of X and Rise of the Powers of X books, which promise to be a definitive end to the Krakoan era of the X-franchise.

                  &#34;X-Mansion Weapons Cache&#34;: X-Men Reveals the Hidden Secret of Xavier&#39;s School, &amp; It Changes Their Base Forever   The X-Mansion was once home to some of Marvel&#39;s most powerful heroes, but it&#39;s now the home of one X-Man&#39;s most dangerous weapons stash.   





 Their Danger Room Could Live Up To Her Name 
          

The entity known as Danger grew to sentience thanks to her original design being augmented with Shi’ar technology; upon gaining sentience, she sought vengeance on Professor Xavier for her suffering, but over time, she was ultimately converted away from antagonism, ultimately joining his students’ mission. Operating as a valued member of the X-Men for a time, Danger even served on Cyclops’ Extinction Team, alongside mutant icons like Storm, Magneto, and Hope Summers. These days, however, the team – and mutantkind at large – seem to have turned their back on their one-time ally, in what could prove to be a pivotal miscalculation.



Danger first appeared as a sentient character in 2005&#39;s Astonishing X-Men (Volume 3) #9 – written by Joss Whedon, with art by John Cassaday.







Readers have not seen Danger since her appearance in Wolverine #20, which positioned her to once more become an enemy of the X-Men during their most dire hour. What she has been doing behind the scenes could become a significant plot point during the upcoming final confrontation between Earth&#39;s mutants and the sinister organization Orchis. As the Xavier Institutue’s former training program, Danger knows the strengths, weaknesses, and battle tactics of almost all the core X-Men more than anyone else. Allied with fellow anti-mutant artificial intelligences like Nimrod and the Omega Sentinel, Danger could be the ultimate threat to the resurrection of the Krakoan dream, truly making Orchis all but unstoppable.



 The X-Men Have To Make Amends With Danger 
          

Alternatively, Danger’s involvement with Orchis could be the saving grace that the mutants desperately need right now. Danger has been successfully swayed to the X-Men’s cause before, and if they could finally treat her with the dignity and loyalty she deserves, she could be potentially convinced to betray her fascistic masters and rejoin her mutant found family, while also providing whatever intel she’s managed to gather from her time behind enemy lines. What&#39;s more, if the X-Men’s old ally has secretly been working for the mutants all along, that gives the mutant heroes one more crucial supporter inside Orchis’ operation, alongside fan-favorite Firestar.




With Cyclops’ execution fast approaching, the X-Men desperately need an ace in the hole to not only win the day against Nimrod and his Orchis allies, but against every enemy ready to strike out at the mutants while they’re on the defensive. If their former ally Danger can find it in her heart to forgive their betrayals yet again, she just might turn the tides of the worst conflict in their history in the favor of the X-Men. Ultimately, it could turn out that whether Danger can be persuaded to rejoin her old teammates could either be the X-Men’s salvation or their damnation.
