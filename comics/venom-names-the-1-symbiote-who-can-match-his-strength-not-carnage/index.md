# Venom Names the 1 Symbiote Who Can Match His Strength (Not Carnage)


## SUMMARY 



  Rascal, a young symbiote, is quickly proving to be one of the most powerful and dangerous symbiotes in the Marvel Universe.   Despite Venom&#39;s history of taking down formidable opponents like Spider-Man, Carnage, and Juggernaut, Rascal&#39;s ferocity and combat skills make Venom wary.   Rascal&#39;s ability to absorb other symbiotes is just an added bonus to its absurd strength-level, and contributes to making it a symbiote that Venom truly fears.

## Literature Review

In Red Goblin #10, the Venom symbiote declared the eponymous character to be the one symbiote that can match its strength, moreso even than Carnage. 




Venom is one of Marvel&#39;s strongest heroes, and he&#39;s faced off against some truly intimidating characters in the past. Venom has regularly gone up against Spider-Man, as well as his symbiote offspring Carnage, and has even fought heavyweights like Knull and Juggernaut. Still, despite going up against these truly powerful enemies, Venom names one surprising symbiote as the one he&#39;s wary of facing off against: Normie Osborn&#39;s Rascal symbiote.




Red Goblin #10 – by Alex Paknadel, Chris Campana, Roberto Poggi, David Curiel, and Joe Caramagna – featured the showdown between Venom and Rascal. In this story, the Rascal symbiote realizes that it is hurting its host, Normie Osborn. To save its host, the Rascal symbiote goes after Venom, trying to force Venom to separate Rascal and Normie.



          

Unfortunately, Venom isn&#39;t able to do this, and this results in Rascal going berserk, attacking Venom with everything it has and even ending up knocking Venom out cold at one point, which is a major achievement considering Venom went up against Juggernaut with ease.

                  10 Most Important Venom Moments That Defined the Symbiote Anti-Hero   From villain to anti-hero to symbiote god, Venom has had one of the most expansive arcs in all of Marvel Comics. Here are his top 10 defining moments.   





 Rascal Is One Of Marvel&#39;s Most Powerful New Symbiotes 


          

Symbiotes are among the strongest aliens in the Marvel Universe, even being shown capable of taking over cosmic beings like the Celestials. They are absurdly dangerous, so when Venom calls out the Rascal symbiote as being especially dangerous, that is significant. Rascal has been described by Normie Osborn several times as essentially a feral dog. The Rascal symbiote is young and doesn&#39;t fully understand the world or how things work yet, it just lashes out at things it views as a threat. The way Rascal tends to take care of threats is also surprisingly brutal, creating Goblin Bombs from itself and launching them at people.

Venom has fought tons of powerful enemies over the years. He was a regular enemy of Spider-Man, has previously taken down the Dark God Knull, regularly goes up up against Carnage, and once took down Juggernaut and made it look easy. The fact Dylan Brock vs the Red Goblin gave the Venom symbiote pause is a surprising testament to just how absurdly powerful Rascal is. The other major thing that makes Rascal dangerous is the fact it has shown the ability to absorb other symbiotes, as shown during the Carnage Reigns event. This means while Rascal&#39;s physical strength and speed a problem, if Rascal had desired, it could have simply absorbed the Venom symbiote entirely.






 The OG Symbiote Venom Proclaimed Rascal As His Equal 


          



The fight in Red Goblin #10 did not last long; Venom mostly spent it reacting, trying to figure out why Rascal was upset instead of fighting back. While Venom didn&#39;t unleash his full strength against Rascal, there&#39;s still no denying just how dangerous Rascal is, especially considering Rascal ended the fight by knocking Venom out cold. By using his Goblin Glider, Rascal was able to take Venom by surprise, knocking him unconscious, which is a major feat that even Spider-Man often struggled with. Rascal might be a new symbiote, but its ferociousness and capability in combat can not be understated, so while villains like Carnage are certainly terrifying, the one symbiote that Venom truly worries about is Rascal.
