# Wonder Woman s Son with the Evil Superman Unlocked a New Kryptonian Power


## SUMMARY 



  Zod, the son of Wonder Woman and the Justice Lord Superman, is a powerful Kryptonian/Amazonian hybrid with the ability to control Kryptonian technology.   Zod&#39;s control of Kryptonian tech is so strong that he can use it from within the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension that nullifies most superpowers.   This version of Zod has the potential to be as heroic as his mother, Wonder Woman, and is even more powerful than Superman himself.

## Literature Review

Wonder Woman and Superman have paired up many times across the multiverse, but one surprising union led to an even more surprisingly powerful son.




As close friends and two of DC’s strongest heroes, Wonder Woman and Superman have frequently been paired up in various retcons, reboots, and alternate timelines, often resulting in Elseworlds offspring. But one surprising union between the pair led to a shockingly powerful Kryptonian/Amazonian hybrid by the name of Zod. While he’s nowhere near as evil as his Earth-0 namesake, he’s got more power than Wonder Woman or Superman could’ve expected.




Hailing from the DCAU timeline, Zod first appears in the first arc of Justice League Beyond 2.0 by Christos Gage, Iban Coello, Randy Mayor, and Thomas Mason. As the son of the prime DC Animated Universe Wonder Woman, Zod is also the son of the Justice Lord Superman – a fascist version of the Man of Steel that rules his Earth with an iron fist.

          

Created using Diana and Lord Superman’s genetic material as a peace treaty for the latter’s warring world, Zod is stolen by Brainiac and raised by the Kryptonian criminal Jax-Ur in the Phantom Zone. There he develops the unusual ability to manipulate Kryptonian technology with his mind before coming to terms with his lineage and earning a place in the Justice League as its new Superboy.

                  DCEU&#39;s New Aquaman vs Wonder Woman Rivalry Is a Good Idea That&#39;s Come Too Late   In most continuities, Aquaman and Wonder Woman are close allies, but a tie-in to the DCEU hints that this Arthur and Diana may not be super friends.   





 Wonder Woman and Superman’s Child Can Control Kryptonian Technology 
          

The idea that the child of Wonder Woman and Superman would be one of the world’s strongest heroes in their universe isn’t surprising in the least. After all, on their worst days, both Clark and Diana are undoubtedly two of the Justice League’s most powerful members, and both heroes have demonstrated feats of strength that boggle the imagination. A hybrid Kryptonian and Amazonian child would likewise be on a similar power level, but his Kryptonian technopathy puts this young but heroic version of Zod into an entirely different echelon of power than even Superman or Wonder Woman.

Zod’s control of Kryptonian tech is so strong that the boy can even use it from within the Phantom Zone: a hellish alien prison dimension well-known for its negation of most superpowers. Combine these incredible abilities with an innate drive to do good, which allows him to overcome both his dark familial nature as well as his troubled upbringing under Jax-Ur, and this version of Zod has the potential to be every bit the hero as his mother, Wonder Woman. And under the tutelage of the Justice League, that seems highly likely.






 This Universe&#39;s Zod Is More Powerful than Superman 
          

Superman and Wonder Woman regularly reshape fans’ understanding of power levels within the DC Universe, so it’s only natural that their shared alternate-universe son would do the same. The young Kryptonian may not come from the most traditionally heroic background, but that hasn’t stopped him from fighting for what he thinks is right. And while he hasn’t been seen or heard from in quite some time, there’s no doubt that the son of Wonder Woman and Superman has the potential to reshape the legacy behind the Zod family name.



Justice League Beyond 2.0 is available from DC Comics.
