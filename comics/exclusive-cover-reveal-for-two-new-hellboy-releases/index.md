## Literature Review

Revisit some of Hellboy&#39;s best stories with two upcoming releases from Dark Horse Comics, and Screen Rant has an exclusive first look at the covers.




Christmas has come early for fans of Hellboy as news drops that the character is getting two comic releases coming in 2024, and Screen Rant has an exclusive first look at the covers. Next year is already shaping up to be a big one for Big Red, as Hollywood prepares to release another cinematic reboot for his character. With Brian Taylor in the director&#39;s chair and the duo of Christopher Golden and creator Mike Mignola writing, Hellboy: The Crooked Man is set to be the fourth live-action Hellboy movie.




In anticipation of the release, Dark Horse Comics is debuting two comic collections featuring Hellboy. First, Hellboy: The Crooked Man &amp; The Return of Effie Kolb features stories by Mike Mignola with art by Richard Corben, Zach Howard, and Mike Mignola, colors by Dave Stewart., and lettering by Clem Robins. In addition, Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1955 - 1957 written by Mike Mignola with John Arcudi and Chris Roberson, featuring the art of Alex Maleev, Ben Stenbeck, Stephen Green, Patric Reynolds, and others. Cover art by Mignola can be viewed below.

          



The Crooked Man &amp; The Return of Effie Kolb will be a paperback, while Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1955 - 1957 is a hardcover. Though they may not be brand-new stories, they are collections of classic stories ripe for readers introducing themselves to Hellboy for the first time, as well as long-time fans who want to revisit classic stories in time for the latest on-screen reboot.




     


 Two New Hellboy Collections Coming Soon 


          



First, Hellboy: The Crooked Man &amp; The Return of Effie Kolb collects Hellboy: The Crooked Man #1-3, and Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: The Return of Effie Kolb #1-2. The Crooked Man, as can be assumed by the title, is the main source of inspiration for the next movie, centering around Hellboy helping a young man who sells his soul to the title antagonist. Soon after, in the sequel by Mignola and Zach Howard, Hellboy confronts the folk legend again when someone - or something - has moved into the Crooked Man&#39;s mansion with wicked intentions.




Finally, Hellboy and the B.P.R.D.: 1952-1954 features Hellboy&#39;s earliest adventures with the paranormal defense bureau. Among the cases collected from a three-year period for the devilish agent, this features his very first official case from 1952. In it, Hellboy tracks down a mad scientist in Brazil, beginning his journey of punching out monsters across the globe.



 Hellboy Returns For New and Old Fans Alike 
          

Both of these collections not only feature the best of Hellboy but some of the earliest examples of Hellboy adventures within his canon. For new fans, this is the perfect way to introduce themselves to the destined World Destroyer, catching a glimpse of his earliest adventures as a B.P.R.D. agent. Meanwhile, fans who are already well familiar with the would-be Beast of the Apocalypse should be happy to revisit these stories in time for his next resurgence into the mainstream due in 2024. In either case, these two collections of Hellboy are must-haves for anyone remotely interested in the character.
