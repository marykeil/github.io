## Literature Review

X-Men&#39;s Krakoa Era has been steadily heading for a conclusion during the ongoing Fall of X event, and now the final mutant has left the island. 




Warning: Spoilers for Immortal X-Men #17!




The Krakoa Era is officially over as the final member of the X-Men has left the island. Two 2019 miniseries, House of X and Powers of X, marked the beginning of the mutants transitioning into calling Krakoa their home. After almost five years, the end of the Krako Era is drawing near after Orchis destroyed virtually everyone on the island during this year&#39;s Hellfire Gala. In the time since, only Professor Xavier has remained on Krakoa.

That has changed following Immortal X-Men #17 by Kieron Gillen, Juan Jose Ryp, David Curiel, VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles, Tom Muller, and Jay Bowen. After learning that Mister Sinister is still lurking in Professor Xavier&#39;s mind following the &#34;Sins of Sinister&#34; storyline, Xavier is finally convinced to leave the island of Krakoa behind him.

          




In what is a somber moment for the conclusion of the Krakoa Era, it also hints at what the future holds for the post-Krakoa Era. It&#39;s possible that Krakoa could merely be replaced rather than wiped out entirely.

                  X-Men&#39;s 2019-2024 Era Will End by Turning [SPOILER] into a Mutant God - Theory Explained   The Four Sinister Suits have raced for centuries towards claiming Dominion. However, it now seems the Sinister Dominion might be Charles Xavier.   


 The Final X-Men Member Leaves Krakoa 
          

Krakoa was a paradise for mutants that soon became a nightmare when Orchis invaded the island on the night of the Hellfire Gala this year. From that moment on, mutants on the island were either killed mercilessly, forced into hiding, or forced off the planet entirely, but most survivors left the island. The only mutant who remained for the longest time was Professor Charles Xavier, almost out of a sense of pride, a sense of mourning for a dream deferred.




Going into Immortal X-Men #17, Xavier is ready to end his life until Mister Sinister arrives to stop him, confirming the implication of the previous issue that there are still remnants of Sinister in his head. Sinister literally talks Charles off the ledge before telling Xavier that he wants to help him stop Orchis for good, if only out of spite and bitterness. At the end of their conversation, Xavier accepts a transport bubble from Mister Sinister. Xavier is finally ready to leave the island, and they make their way to Muir Island.



 Could Muir Island Be the X-Men&#39;s New Krakoa? 
          

As of this writing, it isn&#39;t yet clear as to why they could be heading to Muir Island. If Muir Island is still as isolated as it once was before, one has to wonder if there are plans at stake for Muir Island to be used as the new Krakoa, a new safe haven for mutants. Whatever plans they have in mind, the most significant thing at this moment is that Krakoa has finally been abandoned. The end of the Krakoa Era has slowly been nearing an end and it&#39;s even been speculated if the end of Krakoa will actually be a rebirth rather than a full-on death, with the final mutant gone, the X-Men&#39;s former sanctuary is officially uninhabited.






Immortal X-Men #17 is on sale from Marvel now.
