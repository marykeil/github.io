Summary

  As the original five teen X-Men are ripped out of the timeline, they meet an older version of a major mutant hero.   Their new mentor reveals they beat all the Avengers&#39; biggest villains single-handed, but there&#39;s one threat they need the original X-Men to help them beat...   Original X-Men #1 is coming from Marvel Comics December 20.  





As the original teen X-Men go on a new mission that will change the team forever, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman, Beast and Angel discover that one of their number has a maximum power level that makes the Avengers surplus to requirements.






They took down Thanos, Ultron, Mephisto and Dormammu - the latter two on the same day.




In a preview of Original X-Men #1, the teenage heroes are yanked out of the timeline during their first year at Charles Xavier&#39;s school. The culprit is none other than an older Jean Grey (aka &#39;Old Lady Phoenix&#39;), who reveals that she is from a world where - during the Dark Phoenix Saga - the Phoenix Force accepted her as a partner rather than trying to replace her. This one event changed the team&#39;s destiny, with that world&#39;s X-Men becoming Earth&#39;s foremost protectors - replacing the Avengers, and fighting all their classic villains. Original X-Men #1 comes from Christos Gage, Greg Land, Jay Leisten, Frank D&#39;Armata and Clayton Cowles.

         




In Old Lady Phoenix&#39;s speech, she shares that she took down Thanos, Ultron, Mephisto and Dormammu - the latter two on the same day. That&#39;s a relatively complete list of the Avengers&#39; most powerful foes of all time, with preview art suggesting Old Lady Phoenix toppled them pretty much single-handed. The Avengers have fought and struggled against these foes, leading to some of their hardest-won victories and darkest losses. But apparently for Jean Grey at the height of her power, they were barely a challenge.

However, as powerful as she is, the older Jean doesn&#39;t dare go up against the series&#39; main threat: a team of X-Men who turned villain, conquering their world instead of saving it. While Old Lady Phoenix claims she can&#39;t risk the evil Jean claiming the Phoenix Force - and that she has chosen the teenage original five because they have prior experience messing with the timeline - it&#39;s a suspicious claim, as the young team will struggle to beat conqueror versions of themselves.






One of the five teen heroes will end the story trapped in the present...

Jean Grey&#39;s Dark Phoenix Story Gets a Huge Twist


          

The reveal that Jean Grey would be a one-woman Avengers roster if she&#39;d worked with the Phoenix is a major confirmation of her potential, but it&#39;s also more relevant than ever. Recently, Jean Grey was killed by the anti-mutant group Orchis, and has spent the four issues of Louise Jones Simonson and Bernard Chang&#39;s Jean Grey miniseries looking back through her life, trying to see how things could have gone differently. In the recent issue 4, Jean finally bonded with the Phoenix on equal terms. That should mean she now rivals this alternate-reality, god-tier Old Lady Phoenix - capable of defeating the Avengers&#39; biggest villains with a wave of her hand.




It&#39;s also a significant rewrite because of what it says about Jean&#39;s history. The Dark Phoenix Saga is perhaps the most famous X-Men story ever published, and remains relevant to this day. The story connected Jean forever with the cosmic embodiment of change, and saddled her with an unforgivable death toll and the potential to be Marvel&#39;s most powerful hero of all time. Here, fans learn that if the Phoenix Force had just approached Jean in the right way, she could have flourished rather than spending years overcoming the trauma of the experience. Of course, with the evil X-Men still to be introduced, it&#39;s likely fans will also see how the same story could have gone way worse.

The big draw of the Original X-Men series is Marvel&#39;s promise that one of the five teen heroes will end the story trapped in the present. That&#39;s something fans are looking forward to in a big way. Back in 2012, Marvel released All-New X-Men, in which the teen heroes were first brought to the present by their modern-day selves. The series was a huge hit, especially since it added depth and history to each member of the team. The teen Iceman came out as gay, Angel was reshaped physically and mentally by the cosmic Black Vortex, and Henry McCoy&#39;s Beast began studying magic, even transforming himself into a new, more demonic form.

Meanwhile, Cyclops joined the Champions - making new friends his own age, and giving him experiences outside Xavier&#39;s school - and also spent time in space with his father Corsair, who was absent for his childhood and adolescence. Jean unlocked her telepathic powers early and went on an odyssey to learn more about the Phoenix and her own potential, training under several Marvel heroes while also harboring the potential to become a darker hero, having seen how the future destroyed her friends and family.

Eventually, the teen heroes had their memories of the present telepathically repressed, and were sent back to live out their lives, growing up to become the adult heroes fans know and love. However, not only did Old Lady Phoenix just unlock these repressed memories, but one hero will be getting a permanent home in the present. It&#39;s likely they&#39;ll somehow replace their adult self in Marvel&#39;s mainstream canon, however the identity of the stranded hero is still a mystery, since all the adult X-Men are currently good candidates to be replaced.

It will be exciting to see which of the teen heroes ends up in the present day, continuing their story. While it initially seemed like a lock that the young Beast would end up in the present - as his older self recently turned evil, and is now being targeted for death by Wolverine - that&#39;s now feeling less certain. Jean is also currently dead (albeit now in control of the Phoenix Force), Angel was seemingly just killed over in Dark X-Men, and Iceman is hanging by a thread as his powers go haywire. Meanwhile, Cyclops has been captured by Orchis, who intend to execute him after a show trial.

Any of the adult X-Men could believably be killed off permanently in the coming months, leaving a gap for their teen self to fill. This preview of Original X-Men sets up a major new era for the mutant team, establishing not just Jean Grey&#39;s full power as equal to the Avengers&#39; biggest villains, but also beginning the mystery of who will end up joining Marvel&#39;s present.
