The narrative takes a compelling twist as the issue concludes, unveiling Santa&#39;s own version of Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude, aptly named The Glacier. Krampus&#39;s nefarious intentions come to light as it is soon unveiled that Santa&#39;s Glacier is both a formidable fortress and the dwelling place for the deadly creatures Krampus aims to unleash upon the world.

In a surprising revelation, Santa Claus has been harboring a unique secret in his Glacier. Instead of presents, the jolly gift-giver stores dangerous creatures he&#39;s captured over the years but couldn&#39;t bring himself to eliminate, as they represent the last of their kind. Santa&#39;s compassionate approach allows these creatures to live on within the Glacier, simultaneously safeguarding the general population of Earth from their potential threat. This parallel to Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude and its zoo is undeniable, as the Man of Steel also curates an elaborate game preserve filled with interplanetary animals, many of which are either endangered or the last surviving specimens of decimated worlds.

Despite Santa&#39;s well-intentioned efforts to preserve these creatures, Krampus&#39;s success in releasing the once-contained beings transforms Santa&#39;s Glacier into an unexpected menace within the DC universe. Considering the similarities between The Glacier and Fortress of Solitude, it&#39;s a valid question as to whether Superman&#39;s own zoo could pose the same threat if a villain targets it and sets free its inhabitants. This food for thought adds an intriguing layer to Superman&#39;s lore, leaving fans to ponder whether DC writers will eventually address this potential time bomb within the Man of Steel&#39;s sanctuary or if it will be swept under the rug and left unaddressed.






 Santa’s Glacier Puts Him on the Same Level as Other A-List DC Heroes 
          

Joining the ranks of premier heroes like Superman with his revered Fortress of Solitude and Batman with his famed Batcave, Santa&#39;s Glacier becomes a noteworthy addition to the pantheon of clandestine lairs. In the world of true A-list heroes, having a secret lair is a defining characteristic, and Santa Claus now officially earns his stripes as a genuine DC hero by meeting this essential criterion. Santa&#39;s Glacier houses trophies and creatures collected from his numerous adventures, mirroring the storied collections found in the Fortress of Solitude and Batcave. Hence, solidifying Santa&#39;s place among Superman and Batman as DC&#39;s most elite heroes.
