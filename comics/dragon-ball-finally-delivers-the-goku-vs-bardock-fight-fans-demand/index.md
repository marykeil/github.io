# Dragon Ball Finally Delivers the Goku VS Bardock Fight Fans Demand


## SUMMARY 



  Dragon Ball Super attempted to tease a Goku and Bardock interaction but ultimately fell short, while Dragon Ball Heroes steps in to give readers the Goku and Bardock moment they&#39;ve been waiting for.   In Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, Goku and Bardock finally fight each other, with Bardock surprisingly proving to be more powerful than ever before.   Despite the potential for a deeply emotional moment between father and son, Dragon Ball Heroes takes a more casual approach, resulting in a lackluster and unoriginal scene. Fans can only hope to see more of Goku&#39;s father in the future.

## Literature Review

Dragon Ball Super failed to give fans the Goku and Bardock moment they wanted but Dragon Ball Heroes actually lets the characters fight each other.




Despite the recent attention given to Goku’s thoughts about his father Bardock in Dragon Ball, the pair have never really had a real moment with one another. Dragon Ball Super may have teased something along these lines with promotion for the Granolah arc, but ultimately delivered little more than Goku listening to some scratchy audio. Dragon Ball Heroes aims to rectify this by giving Goku and Bardock a chance to fight in person.




Even with all the future timelines and alternate universe counterpart shenanigans that Dragon Ball Super has going for it, Goku and Bardock have still never met in the series canon timeline. Whether they really need to meet is an entirely different question but Dragon Ball Super did try to tease a Goku and Bardock interaction within the Granolah arc and didn’t really deliver on it.

          

Dragon Ball Heroes, however, is no stranger to Bardock guest appearances and the Ultra God Mission arc grants readers a chance to see a fight between Goku and Bardock from an alternate timeline.

In chapter 8 of Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, Goku asks Jiren to stand down while he fights the mysterious “Warrior in Black” on behalf of their timeline. Thanks to his scars and Saiyan transformations, it is very apparent that this Warrior in Black is in fact, Bardock, the father of Goku. The two clash and strangely enough, Bardock seems more powerful than ever before. He is able to go blow for blow with Goku using only Super Saiyan 3. This power is so intense that Goku feels pressured enough to use Ultra Instinct Sign just to stay equal in strength. Bardock is eventually overwhelmed by Goku’s Mastered Ultra Instinct and admits to his son that he is the superior fighter, granting him the ability to seek out a Time Fairy and escape the trap Aeos laid out for them a few chapters prior.

Bardock and Goku actually fighting with each of their strongest forms is an interesting read thanks to some of the more dynamic panels, but ultimately falls flat. For what could have been a truly emotional moment between father and son, reuniting in circumstances that pit each other in a fight to the death, Dragon Ball Heroes instead opts for the ‘play it cool’ approach and downplays all previously established stakes. Dialogue in this chapter is also very sparse, and there is exactly one comment made by a fighter on the other’s power and technique.




In the end, even though Dragon Ball Heroes manages to give readers the Goku and Bardock moment Dragon Ball Super failed to deliver on, this scene still manages to come across as lackluster and unoriginal. Dragon Ball has such a unique set of interesting characters, and it’s a shame to see what could have been a truly emotional moment between Bardock and Goku more or less wasted. With the elimination of Bardock from Dragon Ball&#39;s latest tournament, readers can only hope this isn’t the last of Goku&#39;s father, the lone Saiyan warrior.

               Dragon Ball   Summary:   From the creative mind of Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a mega multimedia franchise that spans back to the 1980s. Dragon Ball expanded quickly, starting as a serialized manga for Weekly Shonen Jump in Japan. It made its way overseas via manga and an anime adaptation that is enjoyed worldwide. Dragon Ball was the initial starting animated series that followed the adventures of the young Son Goku as he sought after the Dragon Balls. These mystical orbs would grant the wish of any who gathered them together. Then, the series would branch off into the immensely popular Dragon Ball Z, which followed Goku as an adult and featured high-intensity battles and Goku&#39;s never-ending search to be the strongest.
