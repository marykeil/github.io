## Literature Review

In the new shared Energon Universe, G.I. Joe and Cobra are both racing to claim Transformers&#39; Energon - using it to create upgraded weaponry.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Duke #1G.I. Joe is known for its vast arsenal of vehicles and weaponry, but in the franchise&#39;s new continuity, these weapons of war are actually derived from the Transformers’ power source, Energon. It&#39;s all a part of the larger tapestry publisher Skybound Entertainment is weaving with the shared Energon Universe, tying the two beloved Hasbro properties more closely together than ever before.




Coming from the creative team of Joshua Williamson, Tom Reilly, Jordie Bellaire and Rus Wooten, Duke #1 sees the title character going AWOL to uncover the secrets of the Transformers. This brings him in contact with Dr. Adele Burkhardt, a classic character from the original Marvel Comics who has been reinterpreted as an expert in the mysterious alien substance known as Energon.

          

After providing Duke with intel on various factions using Energon to create weapons of war, Dr. Burkhardt sends Duke to the weapons manufacturer M.A.R.S. Industries. Longtime G.I. Joe fans will recognize this as the company run by the villainous Destro, who also makes a surprise appearance in the issue.

Successfully infiltrating the M.A.R.S. facility, Duke watches as various vehicles and weapons are manufactured in bulk. Keen-eyed G.I. Joe fans will recognize many of the vehicles and weapons displayed on the two-page spread. Most prominent among them are the H.I.S.S. tanks, the eventual backbone of Cobra&#39;s heavy armor vehicles. Also seen are the single-seat F.A.N.G. copters, the robot exoskeleton Cobra S.N.A.K.E.s and what looks to be a C.L.A.W fighter. Also hidden away is a line-up of B.A.T.s, the robotic infantry troopers that will one day serve as cannon fodder for Cobra&#39;s army.

It&#39;s interesting to see all these classic heavy weapons and vehicles being manufactured following the discovery of Energon, and it raises the stakes immeasurably for the story going forward. In a world where the G.I. Joe and Cobra organizations don&#39;t yet exist, it&#39;s exciting to see the pieces slowly come together in such a way. It also serves to hammer home how important Energon will be going forward in the new shared continuity, as it&#39;s no accident that Skybound has dubbed this new line the Energon Universe. The Transformers and the human characters of G.I. Joe are headed for a major collision over the valuable power source, and the galaxy will never be the same.

Dr. Burkhardt minces no words over the ramifications of the discovery of Energon on Earth, alluding to the biblical Garden of Eden as well as a certain &#34;snake&#34; lying in wait: &#34;I believe this is the new apple from the Tree of Knowledge, and there is a snake hoping someone takes a bite out of it…&#34; Skybound has already announced that the upcoming Cobra Commander miniseries will see the titular character on a quest for Energon, carving a path of death and destruction as he builds his terrorist organization from the ground up. Which Energon-powered weapons and vehicles will see action in future issues of Duke and the upcoming Cobra Commander? It will be fascinating to see how events play out in this new G.I. Joe corner of the Energon Universe.
