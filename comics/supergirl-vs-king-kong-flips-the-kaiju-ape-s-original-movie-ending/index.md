## Literature Review

As the MonsterVerse continues to invade the DC Universe, Supergirl steps in to save a fellow hero by picking a fight with the legendary Kong.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3!Kong and Supergirl are about to square off in a battle that promises to put a twist on one of the most famous movie endings of all time. The kaiju of the MonsterVerse have invaded the DCU and even the strongest heroes are in danger. But that&#39;s not stopping Kara Zor-El from taking on the Eighth Wonder of the World.




In Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3 by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, Superman has just been defeated by Godzilla, and the rest of the League is scrambling to stop the rest of the invading Titans. However, Supergirl and Shazam get revenge for Superman by popping Godzilla square on the jaw.



          

Miles away, Green Arrow is simply trying to survive Skull Island, only to come across Kong protecting his domain. Before the great ape can attack Oliver, Supergirl arrives to give the Emerald Archer a chance to escape. As soon as Kong makes a move, Kara belts him one, incurring the monster&#39;s ire.


 Supergirl Has Just Picked a Fight with Kong 
          




The Legion of Doom has unleashed a huge problem on the DC Universe. Using the Dreamstone, the Toyman discovered the MonsterVerse Titans and saw them as the villains&#39; best chance of defeating the Justice League. Now kaijus are rampaging across the most famous locations in the DCU, such as Metropolis and Themyscira. Fortunately, the heroes are quick to respond and have already taken down the bat-like monster Camazotz from doing any more damage to Gotham. Unfortunately, Titans like Godzilla and Kong are still loose, defeating heroes as powerful as Superman.

It shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that Supergirl is the first hero to go up against Kong. After all, in the kaiju&#39;s debut film, King Kong, the monster was obsessed with a young woman. Kong&#39;s interest in the movie&#39;s lead actress ultimately led to his death after he kidnapped her on his final rampage, inspiring the film&#39;s last line &#34;It was beauty killed the beast&#34;. Kara, of course, is no damsel and doesn&#39;t even give Kong the chance to get his stinking paws on her. Instead, Supergirl slugs him and challenges him to a fight. Beauty might not kill the beast here, but she&#39;s surely going to give him a hell of a fight.






 Will Supergirl Be Able to Defeat Kong in Battle? 
          

If Godzilla can beat Superman, then anything could happen in the miniseries&#39; next couple of battles. However, Kara was able to beat Godzilla with Shazam&#39;s assistance. And anyone who saw Godzilla vs. Kong knows that Godzilla walked away from their battle the victor. If Supergirl can beat Godzilla with a partner, then she should be able to handle Kong by herself. After all, all Kong really has is size and strength. But Kara has a whole bevy of Kryptonian powers that could give her the edge in her fight with the oversized ape. Either way, watching Supergirl come face-to-face with Kong will truly be a sight to behold.

Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
