## Literature Review

Starscream pushes his brutality to a new limit in the Energon Universe, as the latest issue of Transformers sees the Decepticon pushed to the brink.





Summary

  Starscream becomes increasingly unhinged and brutal as he tries to maintain his leadership of the Decepticons.   Starscream and Soundwave cannibalize their wounded comrade Skywarp for Energon, showing their desperation.   The true Decepticon leader, Megatron, is expected to return, and the battle for Energon intensifies.  







The new Transformers title has gotten a lot of attention for being edgy, and the latest issue shows Starscream reaching new levels of brutality as the self-proclaimed leader of the Decepticons slips further and further into megalomania. Starscream is becoming more and more unhinged, proving to be a challenge for the Autobots as he continuously terrorizes humanity in the surrounding town.

Transformers #4 picks up the story from the previous issue, as Optimus Prime rushes a wounded Spike Witwicky to the hospital after he caught a stray bullet in the battle between the humans and the Transformers. On the way, Prime is assaulted by Starscream, who follows Prime and Cliffjumper all the way to the hospital.

          

Although Prime and Cliffjumper put up a valiant effort, they can’t hold out against the Decepticons once Soundwave joins the fight with Starscream. Taking advantage of Prime being one-armed, Starscream overtakes the Autobot leader, but he wants to see Prime suffer before delivering the final blow. Starscream decides to destroy the hospital.






Transformers #4 comes from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten.




                  Optimus Prime’s Newest Weapon Comes From His Greatest Enemy: MEGATRON   After losing his arm in battle, Optimus Prime has a new weapon to use against the Decepticons, but it comes from his greatest enemy: Megatron!

The Autobots are saved once Ratchet and Jazz arrive on the scene, causing Starscream and Soundwave to make a hasty retreat. The two express their frustration at their lack of Energon, as the Transformers don’t have enough power to repair themselves now that the super-computer Teletraan I has been destroyed. This is when Starscream’s brutality truly reaches a new level, as he and Soundwave look on at their wounded comrade Skywarp like he’s a juicy prime rib. In a horrifying sequence, Starscream and Soundwave tear up Skywarp, essentially cannibalizing their fellow Decepticon so that they can take his Energon for themselves.




The scene plays out like something from a zombie movie, and it shows just how desperate the Decepticons are to survive in this new continuity. It also shows that Starscream is becoming more unhinged as the pressures of leadership are weighing heavily on him. Starscream is essentially a selfish character, someone whose quest for power stems entirely from his own desire to put himself above everyone else. Starscream lacks the menace of Megatron, who is able to keep his soldiers in line due to his fearmongering ways. This is why readers are seeing Starscream reach new lows, as the self-proclaimed Decepticon leader is lashing out in a desperate bid to hold on to his newfound power.

Now that fans know what happened to Megatron, it will be most interesting to see what happens when the true Decepticon leader comes back to take his rightful place from Starscream. It will also prove to be interesting to see what Starscream does next as he struggles to hold on to his shaky leadership role. As the battle for the scarce resource of Energon heats up, Starscream seems willing to do anything to hold on to power, making this era of Transformers particularly brutal.
