## Literature Review

The cover for The Invincible Iron Man #14 reveals that Tony will be teaming up with the powerful mutant innovator Forge to create an epic new armor.  




Tony Stark is on the run... married to Emma Frost, without his iconic Iron Man armors, and fighting the forces of Feilong and Orchis as discretely as he is able to. The cover for The Invincible Iron Man #14 reveals that Stark will be partnering with the dangerous mutant innovator Forge to collaboratively create new technology to win his war against Orchis, with the help of his armored ally Ironheart.




Tony&#39;s marriage to Frost has revealed to him the existence of the powerful mutant metal mysterium, which Tony hopes to use to create a new suit - and potentially a battalion of other resources - to battle Feilong&#39;s Stark Sentinel army.

          

Kael Ngu&#39;s gorgeous cover for The Invincible Iron Man #14 - from writer Gerry Duggan and artists Juan Frigeri and Bryan Valenza - depicts Iron Man, Ironheart, and Forge all wielding impressively intimidating weapons, preparing for an all-out battle against an unknown enemy.


 A Mysterium Armor Will Make Iron Man Nearly Invincible 
          




Forge is one of the most powerful and deadliest mutants from Krakoa, although he might not appear as such at first glance. His impressive mutant ability grants him intuitive knowledge about machinery, technology, and innovation, allowing Forge to create pretty much any technology he can think of. Forge used his power to create some of Krakoa&#39;s most iconic features, like the X-Men&#39;s Treehouse and the recently appropriated Captain Krakoa suit, as well as creating a terrifyingly powerful black hole singularity bomb back in X-Men #20 to try and take out Nimrod and Orchis&#39; Sentinel Forge.

While Iron Man recently became a terrifying cosmic god in his battle against Korvac, Forge&#39;s innovation combined with Ironheart&#39;s genius could allow Tony to once again achieve a godlike state without being compromised by cosmic awareness. Forge&#39;s mutant gift may be necessary to empower Iron Man to a level where he can directly fight against an army of Stark Sentinels thousands strong, as well as against the radioactive Feilong, using a new Iron Man army forged from mysterium. Their collaboration will make for some interesting drama, seeing as Forge hates Iron Man, explicitly stating in X-Men #23 that he &#34;loathes&#34; Tony Stark, even though he respects his intelligence and innovation.






 Forge&#39;s Innovation Could Inspire The Embattled Mutants 
          

Iron Man and Emma Frost recently stole a cache of mysterium, an incredibly powerful anti-magic metal harvested from the bowels of the Phoenix&#39;s White Hot Room, from Krakoa for Tony to use in a new arsenal of Iron Man armor and technology. Stark has enlisted Ironheart to help create some type of ship with the Nidavellirian dwarf Eitri, and apparently, Forge&#39;s mutant gift will be necessary as well. Forge&#39;s power, which allows him to create new technology but not necessarily understand how he did it, could pair perfectly with the mutant mysterium and Riri&#39;s ingenuity, allowing him to help Iron Man and mutantkind in their hour of greatest need.

Forge has been seemingly absent from the X-Men&#39;s horrific Fall of X, so it is incredibly exciting to see him back in action with Iron Man. It would be inspiring for many Krakoans to see technology infused with Krakoan biotechnology and mysterium used to battle Orchis. Previews for the future story depicted in Rise of the Powers of X have revealed a new Iron Man suit that is seemingly made up of Krakoan biotech, hinting Forge, Ironheart, and Iron Man&#39;s efforts to create a mutant-inspired line of Stark technology could become reality, if Forge is able to get over his intense dislike of Tony Stark.




The Invincible Iron Man #14 from Marvel Comics debuts on January 3rd, 2024.
