# Daredevil Admits The One Reason He Really Shouldn t Be On The Avengers


## SUMMARY 



  Daredevil&#39;s radar sense doesn&#39;t work well in large-scale battles, as he finds himself in with the Avengers in Daredevil #5, making him question his place in the team.   Chaotic environments heavily interfere with Daredevil&#39;s radar sense, making it difficult for him to use his powers effectively.   Daredevil operates best as a hero when working alone, as his powers are sensitive and work best under specific circumstances.

## Literature Review

Daredevil is a major hero in the Marvel Universe, and like most major heroes, he eventually joined the Avengers, even if he admits he shouldn&#39;t have.




Most major Marvel heroes end up in the Avengers at one time or another – including Daredevil. It is often a sign of the character&#39;s growth and a sign of respect for them in the world. This is why Daredevil has been an Avengers member in the past, despite the fact that he is the first to admit he really shouldn&#39;t be a member of Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes.






Over the years, [Daredevil] has made a name for himself as a major hero, earning him an invitation to join the Avengers. This is usually the highest honor a hero can get, but Daredevil admits he&#39;d rather not have been invited at all.




Daredevil #6 – by Mark Waid, Javier Rodriguez, Alvaro Lopez, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Caramagna – explained that Daredevil&#39;s radar sense doesn&#39;t work very well in large-scale battles. This came up as a result of Daredevil helping with a major Avengers fight against the villain known as the Orb. This battle required the full Avengers roster, and it was here that Daredevil admits that he really shouldn&#39;t be included. 

          

With characters like The Hulk and The Thing stomping through the city and tossing buildings, Daredevil admitted it&#39;s like being caught in a hurricane, which is a great reason for him not to be included in any Avengers battles.




                  Daredevil Has the Perfect Shutdown for Anyone Who Criticizes the Avengers   Daredevil might not always be an Avenger, but he has more than a few choice words for any critic of the Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes.   


 Daredevil Admits Avengers-Level Battles Aren&#39;t His Strong Suit 
          

The childhood accident that resulted in Matt being struck by a radioactive isotope that blinded him for life boosted the rest of his senses to hyper-levels. Matt gained a type of radar sense that allowed him to view the world without really &#34;seeing&#34; it. With these incredible senses, Matt was able to become a vigilante, fighting crime and save people&#39;s lives. Over the years, he has made a name for himself as a major hero, earning him an invitation to join the Avengers. This is usually the highest honor a hero can get, but Daredevil admits he&#39;d rather not have been invited at all.




Daredevil&#39;s radar sense grants him a significant number of advantages over the average person, but there are also plenty of things that can mess with his radar sense and render him useless. One of the biggest examples of this is the fact rain heavily messes with Daredevil&#39;s radar. If something as simple as a sprinkler system or rain could mess with Daredevil&#39;s radar, then it&#39;s hard not to imagine just how terrible someone like the Hulk or the Thing stomping around would be for Matt&#39;s senses. This is why Daredevil doesn&#39;t really enjoy being in Avengers-level battles – because in the sheer chaos of it all, Daredevil struggles to use his powers.



 Daredevil Is Best As A Hero When Operating Alone 
          

There&#39;s no denying that Daredevil is a major hero, on multiple occasions proving himself to be one of the best that the Marvel universe has to offer, but his powers are extremely sensitive and best used under very specific circumstances. Daredevil often works alone and faces off against threats by himself because it&#39;s simply easier to track things when it&#39;s Daredevil against everyone else in the room. In Daredevil #6, when Daredevil was put into a giant city block brawl with many enemy combatants, and just as many superpowered allies, that&#39;s when Daredevil realized that the Avengers might just not be for him.
