## Literature Review

The original Red Ranger is set to lose his powers in shocking fashion according to a preview of the new series coming from the original Pink Ranger. 




Warning: Spoilers for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return #1!Amy Jo Johnson&#39;s new Power Rangers series teases a brand-new mystery villain as the original Red Ranger&#39;s powers are stolen from him in a new preview. The original Pink Ranger actor is at the helm as writer for an alternate look at the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, showcasing a world where members of the original team never left. The small change is significant enough to create a ripple effect across the universe.




A new preview from BOOM! Studios of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return #1, written by Amy Jo Johnson and Matt Hotson with art from Nico Leon, showcases how the original Red Ranger has his powers stolen by a mystery villain. The main cover by GoÃ±i Montes can be viewed below, followed by preview images of the series&#39; first issue.



          



The preview offers readers a glimpse of not only the Red Ranger&#39;s previously teased vigilante lifestyle, but also the dangers that still await him and the rest of the Rangers 22 years after they hung up their Morphers.

Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return promises to be a &#34;What If?&#34; story pondering on what their world would look like if Trini, Jason, and Zack never left for the Peace Corps. What follows is the Rangers sticking together, conquering evil, and still making time for their personal lives, which includes following their careers and, for Tommy and Kimberly, getting married. Then, everything changes when the Command Center is attacked, leading to the deaths of Zordon and Alpha-5. The tragedy is traumatic enough for the Rangers to all stop being Rangers, except for one.

While the rest of the team move on with their lives, 22 years later, Jason continues to dedicate his life to fighting crime as the planet&#39;s sole Power Ranger. The preview showcases Jason&#39;s latest encounter, a shrouded evildoer who somehow manages to strip Jason of his power coin and Morpher from him. It looks like this will be the series of panels to kick the main plot in motion, as previous solicit summaries have teased that the surviving members of the team reunite when Jason goes missing.






 Who Is This New Power Rangers Villain? 


          

Besides the absolutely gorgeous art and the fate of Jason, what stands out most in these panels is the hooded figure committing the deed from the shadows. This could very well be a completely new entity targeting the Rangers, but it also could potentially be a villain from the Rangers&#39; past. The possibilities are endless, but so is the intrigue surrounding this storyline as it unfolds. What&#39;s just as much of a curious thought is what this new villain could want with Jason&#39;s Morpher, if not all of the remaining Rangers&#39; Morphers. Time will tell when Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return #1 releases following its run on Kickstarter, which can be supported for four more days.
