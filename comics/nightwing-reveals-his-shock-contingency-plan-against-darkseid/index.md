Summary

  Titans Tower is a safe haven for the superheroes, capable of resisting Darkseid&#39;s Omega Beam blasts.   Building a safe house requires planning for all types of powerful villains, and the Titans have done just that.   The Titans&#39; safe house proves that they can handle threats like Darkseid and keep civilians safe.  







Nightwing proved that the Titans have one of the strongest based in the DC Universe because of howt it&#39;s rated to resist up to three Omega Beam blasts from Darkseid. Superheroes are attacked constantly by their villains, so having a location they can actually retreat to or keep civilians in is extremely important.

In Titans #6 by Tom Taylor and Travis Moore, which takes place during the events of Beast World, Nightwing and his group are holed up in Titans Tower, one of the safest places in the city. But when a mind-controlled Tempest allows Brother Eternity and his army into the Titans tower, Nightwing has to think quickly to keep the civilians inside safe.

          

Nightwing&#39;s plan involves bringing the civilians to the Titans safe room, which is the safest spot in the building. The place is so safe, that it can take up to three Omega Beam blasts by Darkseid. Considering how Darkseid&#39;s Omega Beams actually works, this is no small feat.




                  Nightwing&#39;s New Villain APEX AVA Is a Deadly New Take on a Titans Power Set   Nightwing’s newest enemy Apex Ava officially debuts in the DC Universe, and her powers may make her one of “Beast World’s” most dangerous villains.   


 Nightwing Claims Titans Tower Can Withstand Darkseid&#39;s Omega Beams 
          

There are tons of powerful villains that the heroes of Earth have fought over the years, but few are as powerful as Darkseid. Darkseid is the literal embodiment of tyranny, and he possesses absurd physical strength. But the most powerful weapon in his arsenal is without a doubt the Omega Beams. While Darkseid&#39;s Omega Beams might just look like heat vision, they are far more dangerous. Darkseid&#39;s Omega Beams can do essentially whatever the villain wants: they&#39;ve been shown to instantly kill people, send them back in time, resurrect them, and a whole host of other things. That the safe room in Titans Tower can take up to three hits from these beams is no small claim on Nightwing&#39;s part.




When building a safe house or base, the heroes of the DC Universe need to make sure it&#39;s actually safe, and considering the number of powerful villains in this world, that&#39;s not an easy thing to plan for. There are villains such as Doomsday, who have strength on par with Superman, as well as characters like Mirror Master, who can step through reflective surfaces. Of course, there are also characters like Darkseid, who can instantly obliterate anything with his Omega Effect. Creating a truly safe house would require planning for all of these, and it seems that&#39;s exactly what the Titans have done, proving they&#39;ve outdone the Justice League and their Hall of Justice.



 Nightwing and the Titans Can Handle Darkseid 
          

The Titans are currently DC&#39;s biggest superhero team, which means they need to be more capable of saving people than ever before. Having a giant base in the middle of their city might be great for moral, but it&#39;s also an incredibly easy target. The Titans get attacked all the time, and when they sometimes have civilians staying in the building, it&#39;s important to be able to retreat and find safety, if only for a moment. Nightwing proved that the Titans have the safest spot in the entire world with the statement that their safe house could stand up to Darkseid&#39;s wrath.
