## Literature Review

Beast Boyâ€™s powers become a frightening torture when Garfield Logan pushes his body well past its limit to create his most powerful form ever.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #1!He&#39;s been through some wild transformations before, but Beast Boy&#39;s latest stunt is his most horrifying change yet. The DC Universe comes under fire from a powerful alien entity and only Garfield Logan has the power to repel it. But this new form puts Beast Boy through the most arduous torture of his life.




In Titans: Beast World #1 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, a terrifying alien known as the Necrostar is coming for Earth after being released by Brother Eternity. After Starfire reveals that the Necrostar can only be taken down by Starro, Beast Boy volunteers to use his shape-shifting powers to become a similar creature.

          

Raven keeps in telepathic communication to ensure that Beast Boy has emotional support during his transformation. To assist him, she takes on some of Gar&#39;s pain so he can concentrate. But the pain is immense for both of them as Gar&#39;s body expands until Beast Boy completes his metamorphosis into a giant alien starfish, calling himself &#39;Garro&#39;.


 Beast Boy&#39;s Latest Transformation is Physically and Mentally Painful 


          




The Justice League has stepped down and in its place, the members left the responsibility of safeguarding the world to the Titans. Nightwing and his allies rose to the challenge and have so far done an admirable job. Not only are they stopping crime on a worldwide level, they&#39;re taking steps to truly fix the world. Unfortunately, their old enemy Brother Blood (now calling himself Brother Eternity) returned with a sinister agenda, which involved a strange meteorite and converting the Titans&#39; old ally, Garth. Eternity was later revealed to be a Tamaranean who stole Blood&#39;s identity as part of a plan to eradicate the human race.

Beast Boy is used to unconventional transformations beyond his go-to favorites in the animal kingdom. In the past, Gar has transformed into things like a werewolf, a phoenix, and a dragon. But while those forms were all unconventional, they weren&#39;t as harsh on his body as the Garro transformation was. It&#39;s understandable considering Beast Boy had to grow to the size of a large asteroid, far larger than any of his previous transformations. It&#39;s all the more unsettling that Raven, one of the strongest empaths in the DCU, could barely share the pain with Gar during his wildest transformation yet.






 Beast Boy&#39;s Garro Form Reveals the True Horror of His Powers 
          

Shape-shifting seems like a fun power, and generally, Beast Boy enjoys being able to turn into different animals. But not every metamorphosis is a fun experience and the act can put Gar through serious pain to change his body in such an outrageous way. The only saving grace here was that Beast Boy had Raven to help lessen the stress of his transformation. But even with his girlfriend at his side, Gar could barely hang on as he became a gargantuan space monster. There&#39;s no doubt Beast Boy&#39;s powers are cool, but they can be quite disturbing during his more &#39;out-there&#39; experiences.

Titans: Beast World #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
