# Batman s Batcycle Has a Hidden Contingency That Makes It Essential - No Matter How Many Batmobiles He Builds


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s steam-powered Batcycle is his most dependable vehicle, proven in two separate disasters where his other vehicles failed.   The Batcycle&#39;s ability to continue operating during a global blackout makes it more useful than the famous Batmobile.   In situations where the Batmobile&#39;s size is a drawback, the Batcycle allows Batman to quickly navigate tight areas and diverse terrain.

## Literature Review

Batman has an entire arsenal of vehicles at his disposal, but his motorcycle is even better than his iconic Batmobile for one major reason.




Batman&#39;s Batmobile has been a Gotham staple, roaring down the street on its way to stop criminals in the dead of night. But despite how famous the Batmobile is, it&#39;s not actually Batman&#39;s most trustworthy vehicle. That honor actually goes to the Batcycle, which has proven itself in two separate disasters.




The importance of the Batcycle is shown off in Forever Evil #4 by Geoff Johns, David Finch, Richard Friend, Sonia Oback, and Rob Leigh. In this story, the Crime Syndicate has taken over the Earth, banishing the Justice League and shutting down all electronics. This renders all of Batman&#39;s Batmobiles completely useless, but not his Batcycle.

          

The Batcycle is steam-powered and can continue operating even in a worldwide blackout. This makes the Batcycle far more useful than the Batmobile, and it&#39;s not even the first time this difference has come in handy either.

The Batcycle allows Batman to travel through Gotham when it&#39;s been shut down or in a disaster scenario. The Batmobile is great for chasing people down or launching large attack, but the Batmobile isn&#39;t exactly great for getting through tight areas due to its sheer size, and Batman can&#39;t just ram through everything in his way. It&#39;s situations like this where the Batcycle really shines: it allows him to quickly get where he needs to be in a wide variety of terrains and situations for which the Batmobile simply isn&#39;t equipped.

While Batman&#39;s Batcycle was invaluable during Forever Evil, that&#39;s not the only time it has proved its worth. During the events of the New 52&#39;s major Batman story Zero Year, the Riddler takes over Gotham&#39;s power grid, plunging the city into darkness. With absolutely no electricity of any kind and criminals running rampant, Gotham soon falls into complete chaos, with cars either no longer working or completely abandoned. It&#39;s here that, chronologically in his career, Batman first uses the Batcycle to navigate the overgrown and destroyed Gotham City as he searches for a way to stop the Riddler and return power to the city and its people.

Batman is equipped for just about everything he might face, but not all of his equipment is right for every job. While the Batmobile is absolutely iconic and obviously gets the most use of his vehicles, the Batcycle is the most useful to him in times of dire need. The Batmobile has been taken over or outright disabled before, but the Batcycle has always thrived when all of Batman&#39;s other vehicles have been destroyed or taken out of commission.



Forever Evil #4 is available now from DC Comics!
