## Literature Review

It’s a new year and the perfect opportunity to finally resolve several lingering mysteries in the DC Universe that fans need a resolution for.




The past few years have been filled with dozens of twists and turns for the DC Universe. Before and during the Dawn of DC initiative, plenty of intriguing mysteries were introduced, many of whom have yet to be solved. Some revolve around strange events causing the greatest heroes trouble in their corners of the DC Universe. Others involve secret masterminds subtly influencing things behind the scenes. Whatever the case, there are plenty of unsolved plot threads primed to be solved in the new year. Read on to discover the 10 DC mysteries that need to be solved in 2024.









 








 10  What&#39;s Going on With the Firestorm Matrix? 
Mystery introduced: Lazarus Planet: Legends Reborn #1
        

There’s a lot of mysteries to how the Nuclear Man Firestorm operates. But a new wrinkle was added to Ronnie Raymond’s powerful alter ego when he was hit by the Lazarus Storm in Lazarus Planet. After defusing, Ronnie’s partner and other half of Firestorm, Martin Stein aged considerably. This incident repeated itself when Ronnie fused with a man named Dr. Ramirez to fight of a shadow demon, only for Ramirez to wind up several decades older than he was. Firestorm has yet to figure why the Firestorm Matrix is stealing time from secondary users, something that deserves an answer.





 9  What is the Real Secret Behind the Three Jokers? 
Mystery introduced: Batman / Catwoman: The Gotham War – Scorched Earth #1
        

In the wake of “Gotham War”, the Riddler decided to repay Batman for dismantling Catwoman’s operation with a clue about the Joker. But Batman confirmed he already knew that there were three Jokers instead of one. This officially decanonized the DC Black Label book Batman: Three Jokers and the reason behind the triple Clown Princes of Crime. That said, fans did see the multiversal Joker doppelganger Red Mask creating multiple Jokers in the past. But Riddler seemed to hint that there was more behind the story, leaving the true secret behind the three Jokers up in the air for now.





 8  Why Did Perry White Cover Up the Truth About Lex? 
Mystery introduced: Superman 2023 Annual #1
        

In Superman’s pages, secrets have come out about Metropolis’ past, including the dubious notion that Lex Luthor was once a hero. But thanks to Lois Lane’s hard work, she discovered an even more shocking secret in the Daily Planet’s archives. The person who buried every story about Lex being a hero was none other than Lois and Clark’s old boss Perry White. White has had a lot of things on his mind between his recent stroke and brief attempt to run for mayor. But Superman may want to ask why a noble journalist ensured that the truth about Lex Luthor was kept from the public.





 7  What&#39;s Going on with the Newly Humanized Trench? 
Mystery introduced: Lazarus Planet: We Once Were Gods #1
        

The DC Universe changed in many ways thanks to the massive storms of Lazarus Resin in Lazarus Planet. In Lazarus Planet: We Once Were Gods #1, the Resin spread to the Trench, the ravenous swarm of aquatic monsters and changed them into normal-looking Atlanteans. Aquaman promised that he would look after the now human-appearing Trench and help them adapt to modern society. But Aquaman’s diminishing presence in the DC Universe hasn’t allowed for an opportunity to show what’s become of the Trench. Have Aquaman&#39;s fierce enemies adapted and now live in peace or are they too stuck in their old ways and still a threat?





 6  Where are the Other Aspects of Olgrun? 
Mystery introduced: Action Comics #1043
        

During Superman’s journey to liberate Warworld, he discovered the mythology of an ancient Old God named Olgrun. Olgrun was the first and most powerful Old God, but his essence was split into seven aspects that were hidden across the multiverse. Superman retrieved the Fire of Olgrun and used it to revive his adopted son Osul-Ra. Since then, there’s been little development on where the other aspects are, though writer Phillip Kennedy Johnson hinted that the aspects of Olgrun will return some day. It’s just a matter of where they are and who is going to find them.





 5  What is Causing the Disruption to the Emotional Spectrum? 
Mystery introduced: Green Lantern #5
        

The Emotional Spectrum is the powerful energy source that the Green Lantern Corps and its various splinter organizations draws their power from. Amid the chaos of the Corps being overtaken by the United Planets, Hal discovered that the Emotional Spectrum wasn’t working correctly. This became quite apparent when Green Lantern&#39;s nemesis Sinestro channeled the Red Light of Rage with a Yellow Power Ring. The fluctuations could have something to do with the strange attacks on various Central Power Batteries. The Yellow and Blue Batteries have already been destroyed, but no one knows who did it or why.





 4  Why is Everyone After the Watchman? 
Mystery introduced: Flashpoint Beyond #6
        

Ever since Batman found the Comedian’s button in the Batcave, Watchmen’s characters have been a part of the DC Universe. Flashpoint Beyond ended with a young woman named Cleopatra Pak, aka Nostalgia, starting a search for Clark Dreiberg, aka the Watchman, a young boy infused with Doctor Manhattan’s godlike power. The New Golden Age #1 followed up on this with the Time Hunters also mentioning they were looking for Dreiberg before his biological parents or anyone else found him. But what’s so important about Clark and what threat does he present if people other than the Time Hunters find him?





 3  Who is Trinity&#39;s Biological Mother? 
Mystery introduced: Wonder Woman #3


 







The comic book world overwhelmingly embraced Wonder Woman’s new daughter Elizabeth, aka Trinity. Trinity is Diana’s future daughter and her origin is currently being told in the current Wonder Woman series. However, a twist came just several issues in when Wonder Woman discovered her old Amazonian rival Emelie was pregnant. Like Emelie, Trinity has blonde hair and this part of the story surprised her when she heard it. While Wonder Woman is the person who raised Trinity, its not known if she’s Elizabeth’s blood mother or what happened to Emelie.





 2  What Does Brainiac Have Planned For Earth? 
Mystery introduced: Superman #1


 







Brainiac is one of Superman’s most devious nemeses and he’s been keeping a close eye on Clark’s activities for some time now. Superman 2023 Annual #1 and Superman revealed that he had a bottled Czarnian city and that Brainiac recruited several warriors as powerful as Lobo to do his bidding. Brainiac appears to be searching for a hidden secret in Earth that would explain why the planet has such a high number of superhumans. But he’s yet to reveal what he’ll do with that kind of information or what other plans he has in mind for Earth once he’s reached his goals.





 1  Who is On the Council of Light? 
Mystery introduced: Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7


 







Fans of Young Justice no doubt remember the Light, the enigmatic cabal of villains. The Council of Light made their official debut in Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 where they gave Amanda Waller permission to rid the Earth of metahumans and the resources to do so. Like Young Justice, the council’s identities are a secret and appear as white silhouettes. They’ve only appeared once since their first appearance, in Knight Terrors: Night’s End #1 where Waller updated them on her progress. Who is on the Council of Light, how did they get so much power, and what other steps will they take to see their mission through?
While there&#39;s plenty of exciting stories ahead in 2024, hopefully fans will get some resolution to these unsolved DC Comics mysteries.
