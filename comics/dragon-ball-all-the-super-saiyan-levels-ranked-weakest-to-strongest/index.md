# Dragon Ball All The Super Saiyan Levels Ranked Weakest To Strongest


## SUMMARY 


 There have been many different transformations used in 
Dragon Ball
 over the years, from Super Saiyan to Ultra Instinct. 
 The differences between some of these transformations are subtle, and many are only used by one or two characters. 
 New transformations are often being introduced in the 
Dragon Ball Super
 manga, so there are likely many more forms that lie ahead for Goku and friends.

## Literature Review

Twenty years ago, the Super Saiyan form was the cream of the crop. Today, it barely scratches the surface of a Saiyan&#39;s power level.




Though Goku was the first one to reach the highest Super Saiyan levels in Dragon Ball, many other Saiyans (and Saiyan-like beings) have reached higher and more powerful levels throughout the series&#39; storied history. There was a time when the always lovable Goku ascending to the level of Super Saiyan was a spectacle for Dragon Ball Z viewers. Now, multiple decades later, Super Saiyan has evolved beyond anything fans expected; with two different timelines, there are two vastly different lineages for the Super Saiyan transformations.
Nearly all Super Saiyan forms are superlative increases to raw power and combat ability. More often than not, the real reveal of these levels of Super Saiyan lies in the new look, and where these godly abilities take the respective Saiyan, particularly in storylines involving Goku&#39;s most powerful enemies. It&#39;s best that casual fans and even longtime viewers have a refresher course on which level of Super Saiyan fits in terms of strength. Some dangerous and powerful Super Saiyan forms might even surprise audiences in terms of where they land on the list.









 








 20  False Super Saiyan 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug
        

During Dragon Ball Z: Lord Slug, one of many Dragon Ball movies made over the years, the eponymous villain shows up on Earth looking for trouble. He&#39;s quickly confronted by the Z fighters, who are easily dispatched. Even Goku has a hard time with Slug until he manages this power boost. As False Super Saiyan is the weakest of the Super Saiyan levels, Goku&#39;s hair didn&#39;t turn yellow, but his pupils disappeared, and his aura gained a gold tinge. He also received a huge power boost, although he wasn&#39;t able to maintain it for very long. Technically, Goku was the only one who reached this benchmark, though Vegeta has shown off a technique that is similar.





 19  Super Saiyan 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Transformed at Last&#34;


 







Every Dragon Ball fan remembers watching Goku transform into a Super Saiyan for the first time. A Saiyan is able to achieve this state through a combination of intense training and extreme emotional reactions. For Goku, it was watching his best friend be destroyed. For Vegeta, it was the anger that both Goku and Trunks had beaten him to it. In the first of the true Super Saiyan forms, the Saiyan&#39;s hair stands up straight and turns completely yellow. The Saiyan also displays a golden aura, which Akira Toriyama designed to make Goku easier to draw. Super Saiyan laid the foundations for many of the best Dragon Ball movies.





 18  Ascended Super Saiyan 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Super Vegeta&#34;
        

Ascended Super Saiyan is extremely similar to the base Super Saiyan form. The primary differences are that the muscles grow a little bigger and the hair gets a little bit longer and wilder. Once the Super Saiyan transformation is achieved, a Saiyan can reach this upgrade through immense training. Vegeta, Trunks, and Goku were all able to reach this form through extended periods in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. Vegeta was able to overpower Semi-Perfect Cell while using this technique.





 17  Super Saiyan Third Grade 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Trunks Ascends&#34;
        

Out of the different Super Saiyan levels, Ultra is a bit of a wild card. Also known as the Ultra Super Saiyan or the Super Saiyan 1.5, the Super Saiyan Third Grade Transformation is the last one between the original form and Super Saiyan 2. It is similar to Ascended Super Saiyan with a few key differences. Similarly, a Saiyan&#39;s power level increases immensely, their muscles grow huge, and their already spiky hair grows even bigger and shoots out in all directions. Unlike the previous transformation, speed is greatly reduced due to the mass increase. Goku, Vegeta, and Cell all immediately recognized the downside of this technique, but it took Trunks a little longer.





 16  Super Saiyan Full Power 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Meet Me in the Ring&#34;
        

After Goku reached Ultra Super Saiyan, he came to an important conclusion: the original Super Saiyan form is the most practical, and thus Super Saiyan Full Power was established. Super Saiyan Full Power consumes less energy than either of the two superior forms and there is less rage involved, keeping the user more level-headed. Goku decided that he and Gohan would remain in Super Saiyan form permanently right up until the battle with Cell. This way, their bodies would become accustomed to the power and it wouldn&#39;t drain them. They would also be able to control their rage.





 15  Super Saiyan II 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Cell Juniors Attack!&#34;


 







The Cell saga was full of all kinds of new Super Saiyan levels, but none of them made the kind of impact that this one did. In this form, Gohan&#39;s initially short hair spiked and grew much longer. His aura maintained a small amount of lightning around it, and his strength and speed significantly increased. He became confident to a fault, which allowed Cell to briefly gain the upper hand. Goku, Vegeta, and Trunks have all reached this level, as well as Kale and Caulifla more recently.





 14  Legendary Super Saiyan 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z: Broly - The Legendary Super Saiyan
        

Like Ascended Super Saiyan and its upgrade, the Saiyan&#39;s muscles grow much larger. However, in this form, their speed is not at all affected - arguably the first of the Super Saiyan levels to be truly terrifying. A legendary Super Saiyan&#39;s hair also gains a green tinge as opposed to the original yellow, and their eyes become white without pupils.
At first, the only Saiyan to reach this level was Broly, one of Goku&#39;s strongest foes, in non-canonical movies. The transformation was recently made canon when the timid Universe 6 Saiyan Kale achieved the Legendary Super Saiyan form. It is difficult to control but possesses a raw power that is stronger than Super Saiyan II.





 13  Berserker Super Saiyan 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;You&#39;re Our Tenth Warrior! Goku Approaches Frieza!!&#34;
        

Similar to Broly&#39;s Super Saiyan state, the Berserker Super Saiyan or Super Saiyan Berserk unlocked the deep potential of the Universe 6 warrior Kale. After getting the Legendary form&#39;s signature muscle mass increase and white eyes, a golden green glint shines in Kale&#39;s aura and hair - but also at the cost of losing control to sheer rage. Nearly overpowering Goku&#39;s Super Saiyan Blue and also displaying its force in the Tournament of Power, Berserker Super Saiyan is Kale at her deadliest. Berserk is definitely one of the more dangerous Super Saiyan levels.





 12  Super Saiyan III 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z, &#34;Super Saiyan 3?!&#34;


 







So far only two Saiyans have achieved the Super Saiyan III form. The first was, obviously, Goku. He used it against Buu in what came off as a lecture on Super Saiyan transformations. The second was Gotenks, who just kind of figured it out on the fly. This form is drastically different from the first few. For one, the Saiyan&#39;s blond hair grows huge and falls behind their back. They also lose their eyebrows entirely, which makes for a more menacing look. The downside is that it requires a huge amount of energy and therefore can&#39;t be maintained for very long.





 11  Golden Great Ape 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball GT, &#34;The Tail&#39;s Tale&#34;
        

All Saiyans are born with monkey-like tails. When they look at the Moon while their tails are still attached, they transform into a giant ape known as Oozaru. When a Saiyan who has achieved the Super Saiyan transformation turns into Oozaru, they reach the Golden Great Ape form. The form resembles Oozaru in every way except that the fur is gold instead of brown. It is also obviously much stronger, surpassing even the power of a Super Saiyan III. With Dragon Ball GT and its many episodes wiped from canon, the most transformative of the Super Saiyan levels no longer exists.





 10  Super Saiyan IV 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball GT, &#34;Back in the Game&#34;


 







Super Saiyan IV was the final Super Saiyan transformation before Dragon Ball GT was erased and Dragon Ball Super took its place. It is achieved when a Saiyan manages to gain full mental control while in the Golden Great Ape form. In keeping with the simian theme, the Saiyan also grows red fur all around their body except for the chest. The Saiyan also gains a red outline around their eyes. Goku and Vegeta both reached it in Dragon Ball GT, and their fused form Gogeta was also able to achieve the transformation.





 9  Super Saiyan Rage 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;Zamasu&#39;s Ambition - The Storied &#39;Project 0 Mortals&#39; of Terror&#34;
        

Just when Dragon Ball couldn&#39;t get any more confusing, Dragon Ball Super went and introduced Super Saiyan Rage. It takes Super Saiyan II&#39;s power and multiplies it. The Saiyan&#39;s hair grows slightly longer, and they gain a blue tinge within their golden aura. In this form, Trunks was able to go toe-to-toe with Goku Black in his Super Saiyan Rosé form. Much like Goku&#39;s spirit bomb technique, Trunks was able to gather energy from the remaining humans in his time in order to defeat Future Zamasu.





 8  Super Saiyan God 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods


 







The most aptly named of the Super Saiyan levels, Goku was able to reach Super Saiyan God through a ritual involving five other Saiyans who were pure of heart. In this form, his hair returns to its normal state. Instead of being pure black, a Super Saiyan God&#39;s hair and eyes gain a red tinge. In this form, a Saiyan has access to God Ki and their anatomy is irrevocably altered. While it was never shown on screen, Vegeta was also able to reach this level through intense training with Beerus and Whis. While he wasn&#39;t able to defeat Beerus, Goku was able to go toe-to-toe with the God of Destruction while in his Super Saiyan God form.





 7  Super Saiyan Blue 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’


 







What happens when a Super Saiyan God turns into a Super Saiyan? It results in a Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, or as it is most commonly known, Super Saiyan Blue. To prevent further confusion among the Super Saiyan levels, this form resembles Super Saiyan entirely, except for the fact that all the gold is replaced with blue. Goku and Vegeta are both able to achieve this form and while its power is extremely draining on a Saiyan&#39;s body, they&#39;ve both trained enough that they were able to outclass Frieza in his newly attained Golden Frieza form. Their fusion transformations, Gogeta and Vegito, can also use the technique.





 6  Super Saiyan Rosé 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;Rematch with Goku Black! Enter Super Saiyan Rosé&#34;
        

Upon meeting Zamasu, the first thing Goku obviously does is challenge the unstable being. After his defeat, Zamasu sets his sights on Goku&#39;s body and strength. To that end, he steals Goku&#39;s body from another timeline and teams up with his future self for all kinds of destructive mischief. This form is exactly the same as Super Saiyan Blue, except for the fact that Zamasu is an actual God, not just a Saiyan who managed to gain access to God Ki. Because of this, instead of Goku Black&#39;s hair and aura turning blue, it turns pink.





 5  Super Saiyan White 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;Worship Me! Give Praise Unto Me! The Explosive Birth of a Merged Zamasu!&#34;
        

When an evil God who&#39;s achieved Super Saiyan Rosé fuses with his future evil God-self who hasn&#39;t, he gets the purest version of Super Saiyan God to ever be bent on universal destruction. Zamasu is, in theory, the only person able to achieve this transformation. In his Super Saiyan White form, Zamasu maintained his own skin tone and facial features with Goku&#39;s build and, more importantly, his hair. However, because he reached a new level of power, and also because Zamasu&#39;s hair color is white, the hair in this form is also white, a key difference from other levels of Super Saiyan.





 4  Ultra Instinct 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;Goku Enkindled! The Awakened One&#39;s New Ultra Instinct!&#34;
        

This form isn&#39;t limited to Saiyans, but it&#39;s worth mentioning because Goku&#39;s version of it is unique. Ultra Instinct is the greatest of techniques, even though it has its flaws. Once a warrior achieves it, getting it back is no easy feat. In this form, Goku doesn&#39;t even have to think. He is calm and in perfect harmony with his mind and his muscles.
This is an ability Goku has been trying to master since all the way back when he trained with Mr. Popo and Kami in order to defeat Piccolo. He first used the technique in Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Tournament of Power against Jiren, though he was only able to maintain it momentarily. It also manifested briefly against Kefla. Much more visually muted compared to other Super Saiyan levels, Goku&#39;s hair is slightly elevated, and his aura appears as a gray, bubbly glow around him.





 3  Perfected Ultra Instinct 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super, &#34;A Transcendent Limit Break! Autonomous Ultra Instinct Mastered!&#34;
        

This is the most powerful form a Saiyan has ever been shown to achieve in the anime, and is a fitting way to close out the Dragon Ball Super anime. In this form, Goku&#39;s hair and eyes are completely gray. His power level gains a huge boost, though it is extremely damaging to his body. If he maintains the form for too long, his body could literally explode. 
The Autonomous Ultra Instinct possesses a power level even higher than Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Gods of Destruction. Whis and the other angels are able to reach this form, as is Jiren, though Beerus is still working towards it. However, this form still doesn&#39;t put Goku&#39;s power level above Jiren&#39;s. In the manga, Goku has also been able to use this form to perform the &#34;Susanoo&#34; technique, which creates a giant version of himself made of Ki that can deliver attacks.





 2  Ultra Ego 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super Manga, &#34;Vegeta vs. Granolah&#34;
        

The Ultra Ego transformation is, at present, exclusive to Vegeta, and has only been seen in the Dragon Ball Super manga. If Ultra Instinct is the power of the angels, Ultra Ego is better recognized as the power of the gods of destruction. Vegeta learned this technique from Beerus, and it represents a divergence from the path that Goku was treading with Ultra Instinct. His hair turns an unusual purple color in this form, reminiscent of destroyer energy.
While Ultra Ego, like the variations on Ultra Instinct, isn&#39;t truly a Super Saiyan transformation, it is worth mentioning as it represents the peak of Vegeta&#39;s power and character development.


Ultra Ego is unique in that the more damage the user takes, the more powerful they become--but this has a massive downside, as it means that one has to take a lot of hits in order to reach maximum power. Vegeta collapsed the first time he used it from taking too much damage, but still proved the power accessible is almost incomparable.





 1  True Ultra Instinct 
First Appearance: Dragon Ball Super Manga, &#34;To Each His Own Answer&#34;
        

Perfected Ultra Instinct, as it turns out, is only one way that the Ultra Instinct ability can develop. In the Dragon Ball Super manga, Goku discovered the &#34;True Ultra Instinct&#34; state by not reigning in his emotions and instead harnessing them to achieve ultimate power. His hair doesn&#39;t change color, but instead develops silver highlights. 
Goku deployed this against Gas, who at the time was the strongest warrior in the universe due to a wish on the Dragon Balls. This form was developed by Goku, and as such he&#39;s the only one who can use it. Still, it wasn&#39;t enough to match up to Black Frieza&#39;s power, as Goku was defeated easily even in this state. Though it remains to be seen what incredible powers will be developed, as of now, Perfected Ultra Instinct is Dragon Ball&#39;s strongest Saiyan transformations​​​​​.
