# Star Trek Has Been Hiding a Rick and Morty Reference Right Under Fans  Noses


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy comic reveals a surprising connection to Rick and Morty through the characters Doqtis and Marta, whose names resemble the original version of Rick and Morty, Doc and Mharti.   The comic explores Picard&#39;s struggle to make friends at Starfleet Academy due to his family trauma, but Doq, an El-Aurian like Guinan, provides support despite Picard&#39;s dismissal of the need for friends.   As the cadets face off against Romulans in their important Evasive Maneuvers exam, Doq and Marty will be by Picard&#39;s side, hopefully coming up with escape ideas that are less disgusting than what would be seen in Rick and Morty.

## Literature Review

Picard struggled to socialize as a cadet at Starfleet; the closest he has to friends are two characters who reference the popular Adult Swim show.




Star Trek has always boldly gone where no one has gone before, seeking out new life and new civilizations, but an Easter egg in Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy has revealed one strange new world that itself owes much to Star Trek: Rick and Morty. This comic has taken a funny tone many times in its telling of Captain Picard&#39;s Starfleet days, but this reference flew under readers&#39; noses until now.




Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy by Sam Maggs and Ornella Greco sees the young Jean-Luc Picard having a hard time making friends at Starfleet Academy. Picard&#39;s family trauma has left him believing he can only rely on himself, so even group assignments like his important Evasive Maneuvers exam leave him cramming on his own, instead of trying to work together with his fellow cadets. In issue #1, a mysterious, snarky narrator introduces the reader to Picard&#39;s peers, including the only two people he would maybe consider friends.

          

They are Doqtis Ilum and Marta Batanides. Or, as Picard calls them, Doq and Marty.


 The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti Was the Origin of Rick and Morty 


 
First gaining popularity on the early streaming site Channel 101, Justin Roiland&#39;s obscene Back to the Future parody was about the adventures of Doc Smith and Mharti McDonhalds, not to be confused with middle-aged mad scientist Doc Brown and his teenage friend Marty McFly. This wasn&#39;t the first time Roiland had made popular shorts for the site that brought lawyers to his door; his first series of shorts, House of Cosbys, had Bill Cosby&#39;s team sending cease and desist letters that forced him to come up with a new show idea. When Rick and Morty co-creator Dan Harmon was looking for show pitches that would work for Adult Swim, he called Roiland and the two revised Doc and Mharti into the characters everyone knows today.

While Marta &#34;Marty&#34; Batanides has long been part of Picard&#39;s backstory, first mentioned in the Next Generation episode Tapestry, Doqtis was created for the comic. Doq is an El-Aurian, the same alien species as Guinan, one of Picard&#39;s confidantes aboard the Enterprise. It was established in the show that Marty and Picard had crushes on each other that they never acted on, which has been explored somewhat by Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy. Doq, being an excellent listener, has shown Picard support even as the future captain dismisses any need for friends. As the cadets head into their big Evasive Maneuvers exam, Doq and Marty will be by Jean-Luc&#39;s side as they face off against Romulans. Hopefully, Star Trek&#39;s Doq and Marty will come up with ideas for escape that are far less disgusting than what would be seen in Rick and Morty.




Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy #3 will be released December 13 from IDW.
