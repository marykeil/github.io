## Literature Review

It may be tempting to write Darkhawk and Night Thrasher off as dated relics, but a new cosplay shows these character&#39;s potential. 




New cosplays of Darhawk and Night Thrasher have resurrected the ultimate 90s heroes. The 1990s saw the debut of many heroes and villains, both at DC and Marvel. Of the characters who debuted at the House of Ideas during this time, Darkhawk and Night Thrasher are still fondly remembered by fans. Now, cosplayer knightmage100 has brought both heroes to life in a stunning new cosplay shoot.




Knightmage100 unveiled the shoot, stretched across two photos, on their Instagram. The first shot shows 1990s icon Darkhawk. Hovering in midair, Darkhawk has spread his wings, revealing their unique designs. Knightmage100’s Darkhawk cosplay is comic&#39;s accurate, perfectly recreating the character’s classic look. The second photo shows Night Thrasher, complete with his trademark skateboard. Night Thrasher is going for his weapons, poised and ready for combat.


 

Just as Knightmage100 lovingly brought Darkhawk to life, they do the same for Night Thrasher, doing justice to this amazing character.


 Darkhawk and Night Thrasher Are Products of Their Times 
          




The early 1990s were some of comics’ most turbulent years. It was marked by a speculator frenzy, iconoclastic approaches to icons as well as “extreme” heroes, and Darkhawk and Night Thrasher are prime examples of this trend. Debuting within two years of each other, Darkhawk and Night Thrasher represented a new type of hero, one who was more proactive in their approach. Both Night Thrasher and Darkhawk were teenagers when they debuted, and since then, both have grown into great heroes. Darkhawk joined the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Night Thrasher was last seen during the Devil’s Reign crossover event.

Comics and characters from the 1990s are currently experiencing second life and critical reappraisals, and Knightmage100’s cosplay illustrates this perfectly. Darkhawk and Night Thrasher embody the spirit of Marvel in the 1990s, right down to their names. Despite being of their time, both characters are ripe with story potential, even 30&#43; years after they were created. Creators could have let Night Thrasher and Darkhawk lapse into obscurity, but instead kept them alive in the hearts and minds of fans, fans like Knightmage100 who then cosplay as them. Far from one-trick ponies, Darkhawk and Night Thrasher have survived and thrived in the Marvel Universe.






 Darkhawk and Night Thrasher Could Have Been One-Hit Wonders 
          

And now, Knightmage100 has lovingly brought them to life. Both cosplays are stunning, breathing life into these “extreme” characters and helping to introduce them to a new generation of fans. Knightmage100 recreates Night Thrasher and Darkhawk as they appeared in their debuts in 1989 and 1991, respectively. The two characters could have been written off as jokes, or dated relics of another time, but instead the two continue to find new life, thanks to fans like Knightmage100.
