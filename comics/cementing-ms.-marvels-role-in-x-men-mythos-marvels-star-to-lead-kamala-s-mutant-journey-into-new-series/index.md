## Literature Review

The talented Iman Vellani is set to write another Ms. Marvel limited series with Sabir Pirzada, bringing Kamala Khan and the Fall of X to Jersey City.




The beloved Kamala Khan will continue to reconcile her new identity as a mutant and member of the X-Men in the upcoming Ms. Marvel: Mutant Menace, another 4-issue limited series once again written by Ms. Marvel&#39;s MCU actress Iman Vellani, and writer Sabir Pirzada. The exciting new series will see Kamala return to her hometown of Jersey City during the ongoing Fall of X, battling mutant hatred and iconic X-Men villains, cementing herself as a permanent part of the X-Men mythos.




After Kamala&#39;s terrible death in Amazing Spider-Man #26 the hero was resurrected on the eve of the disastrous Hellfire Gala, revealed to be a mutant-Inhuman hybrid, before joining an X-Men splinter faction fighting against Orchis.

          

Marvel&#39;s announcement reveals that Ms. Marvel: Mutant Menace, with art from Scott Godlewski (Alpha Flight), will see new X-Men hero Ms. Marvel dealing with the consequences of being outed as a mutant in her hometown, potentially forced to work as a hero in the shadows if Carlos Gómez&#39;s cover is any indication. Writer Sabir Pirzada had this to say about Iman Vellani and Kamala Khan:


&#34;It&#39;s been an absolute joy and privilege to get to co-write Ms. Marvel with Iman Vellani, who has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that she is THE voice of Ms. Marvel on the page just as much as she is on the screen,&#34; Pirzada said. &#34;We are excited to report that Kamala&#39;s mutant journey will continue on in MS. MARVEL: MUTANT MENACE. It will be Kamala&#39;s most dangerous ride yet.&#34;






 Ms. Marvel Is Headed Back To New Jersey For The Fall Of X 
          

Iman Vellani and Sabir Pirzada&#39;s Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant limited series just concluded its epic 4-issue run, with Kamala Khan destroying a vicious Stark Sentinel, wrecking an Orchis lab, and gaining more confidence in her new complex identity. The core of Ms. Marvel&#39;s story has always been about her juggling her various identities - as a Pakistani-American, an Inhuman, a fan girl - and now she must continue to evolve her mutant identity. Ms. Marvel&#39;s mutant ability has yet to be revealed since her Inhuman terrigenesis transformation stopped her X-Gene from activating, but that doesn&#39;t mean she isn&#39;t already a full-fledged X-Men hero.

Ms. Marvel: Mutant Menace will see Kamala returning to Jersey City and attempting to go back to her life as a costumed hero while dealing with people&#39;s various reactions to her new mutant identity. Orchis&#39; propaganda campaign has been terrifyingly successful, meaning Ms. Marvel might not be seen as a simple &#34;hometown hero&#34; anymore, and now could be considered a dangerous &#34;mutant menace.&#34; Kamala returning to Jersey City will bring the X-Men&#39;s devastating Fall of X to her hometown, thrusting her and her loved ones into the conflict. This will set up Ms. Marvel to meet more mutant rebels, and even reunite with a fan-favorite ex of hers, presumably the dashing Red Dagger.






 Iman Vellani Continues To Perfect Ms. Marvel&#39;s Unique Voice 
          

Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant has successfully integrated Kamala Khan into the vast and beloved X-Men mythos while also &#34;staying true to her roots,&#34; and not erasing her cultural or Inhuman identity. Much of that is due to Iman Vellani&#39;s vision for the character and her mutant journey, coming from a passionate and knowledgeable Marvel fan with an intimate connection to Kamala Khan&#39;s origins and history. Carlos Gómez&#39;s cover for Ms. Marvel: Mutant Menace includes the hero wearing her grandmother&#39;s bangles, which Emma Frost returned to her in Ms. Marvel: The New Mutant #4, another visual signifier of Kamala&#39;s shared identity as a Pakistani-American mutant-Inhuman hero.

Hopefully, Ms. Marvel: Mutant Menace will not only see Kamala Khan continuing to find a balance between her various identities but also reveal what her mutant ability could be. Make sure to check out Iman Vellani and Sabir Pirzada&#39;s newest limited series when it debuts to keep up to date on Ms. Marvel&#39;s inspiring journey as the newest X-Men hero, and how she can help save mutantkind during their tragic Fall of X.
