## Literature Review

Villain team ups aren&#39;t anything new in comic books, but one team up brought the DCU&#39;s iconic super villains much closer than ever before.




There are countless iconic evil teams in comics, and one of them brought the Justice League&#39;s worst villains closer than ever before. In a world where the lives of Batman and Superman are merged together, they end up having to fight the Brotherhood of Injustice, a fusion of their worst foes.




The ultimate villain team is featured in Superman/Batman #61 by Michael Green, Mike Johnson, Francis Manapul, Brian Buccellato, and Rob Leigh. After Batman and Superman awake in a fused version of Metropolis and Gotham (called Gothamopolis), they are quickly ambushed by the Justice Titans, a fusion of the Justice League and Teen Titans.



          

As Batman and Superman are able to convince the team that they&#39;re on the same side, they begin to wonder what else in their world has been fused. Their question is eventually answered when they meet Lex Joker, the leader of the Brotherhood of Injustice, a fused gang of Batman and Superman villains.

The Justice League is one of DC&#39;s most powerful teams, so it makes sense that their villains are nearly equally powerful. Since this fused world that Batman and Superman find themselves in is partially based off of their own social lives, the villains of Lex Joker&#39;s Brotherhood of Injustice are all mash-ups of familiar characters. The Brotherhood of Injustice is made of heavy hitters like Jimmy Two-Face, the Ventrilomaker, Brainycat, Doomstroke, Penguello, and Lana Quinn. All of these are classic mashups of Batman and Superman characters, even including sympathetic characters like Lana Lang and Jimmy Olsen.

Fusing Batman and Superman villains makes for truly terrifying enemies. There are few villains Superman admits he&#39;s scared of, but in the past he has admitted to finding Doomsday terrifying. Likewise, Batman has fought Deathstroke several times and knows how dangerous a man Slade Wilson is. When the two are faced with Doomstroke, a fusion of both villains, Batman immediately tells Superman they have to hit him with everything they have as fast as possible, leaving nothing to chance. When Batman, Superman, and the Justice Titans come up against the Brotherhood of Injustice, they actually end up losing. That&#39;s how terrifying a fusion of Batman and Superman&#39;s villains really is.

Ultimately, Batman and Superman can&#39;t defeat a fused team of their greatest villains. Even with fused allies of their own, they are overpowered and defeated. They only manage to escape because Batman realizes that Dr. Destiny caused the strange fusion in the first place. By calling out to him and breaking the illusion of the dream, Batman bypasses fighting this evil team entirely. Without that dream-like twist, it&#39;s clear that these Justice League heroes would&#39;ve lost to DC&#39;s darkest villain team, the Brotherhood of Injustice.
