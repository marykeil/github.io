# Boruto s Time Skip Misses its Big Chance to Redeem One Classic Series Shinobi


## SUMMARY 



  The Boruto time skip missed the opportunity to give Hinata, an underrated female character from Naruto, a bigger role in the story.   Hinata is more than just Naruto&#39;s wife and Boruto&#39;s mother, she is the heir to a powerful shinobi clan and became a strong kunoichi through her own efforts.   Hinata&#39;s absence from the main storyline is a shame considering her background and connections, and her presence during the time skip could have added depth to the story and allowed her character to reach her full potential.

## Literature Review

Despite the Boruto time skip offering Hinata Uzumaki the perfect chance to come out from the shadows of her husband and son, she remains sidelined.




The Boruto time skip is doing a lot to fix the issues of the series, but at the same time Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has missed its chance to redeem one of Naruto&#39;s best, and most disrespected, female characters: Hinata.




Naruto and Boruto unfortunately both have a story of not giving enough spotlight to their female characters. Hinata was, at first, a shy kid who felt she could not live up to the expectations of the mighty Hyuga clan, and was constantly overshadowed by her talented cousin Neji. Hinata&#39;s time to shine, unfortunately, came with her death, which at least let her profess her love for Naruto (before being resurrected).

          

While she went on to become Naruto&#39;s wife, fans were hoping Hinata could play a bigger role in the sequel Boruto, but unfortunately, much like Sakura, she was relegated to cameo appearances. The announcement of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex could have been a chance to fix that, but unfortunately Hinata was sealed away in another dimension by Kawaki right before the time skip.





 Hinata Should Have Not Been Sealed Away Before Boruto&#39;s Time Skip 
          

Hinata is more than just Naruto&#39;s wife and Boruto&#39;s mother. She&#39;s the heir of one of the stronger shinobi clans in Konoha village, and became a mighty kunoichi through her own dedication and grit. Born into the prominent Hyuga Clan, as the oldest child of the clan&#39;s head, Hinata was automatically in line to become its leader, but due to her quiet and shy personality, she always felt like she did not live up to the expectations. However, under the guidance of her master Kurenai, the encouragement of Naruto, and her own will of steel, Hinata ultimately surpassed everyone&#39;s expectations.

                  Naruto Cosplay Proves Hinata Was Always The Series&#39; Best Female Ninja   Naruto fans often debate which of the series&#39; female ninja is the best, and a new cosplay just proved that Hinata deserves the top spot.   




Unfortunately, outside of her backstory and her connections to Naruto, Hinata is woefully absent from the main storyline in both series. For such a powerful and connected shinobi with such a fascinating backstory, this is a shame. However, as Boruto&#39;s mother, her absence from the plot is also an element of the story that could have been positively addressed in Boruto. Indeed, considering the open-ended, soft reboot nature of Part 2, the run-up to the confrontation between Boruto and Kawaki offered creator Kishimoto the ideal time to finally give Hinata the exposure she deserves.

For instance, if Kawaki decided to only seal Naruto into another dimension at the end of Boruto Chapter #79; Hinata&#39;s presence in the new reality caused by Eida&#39;s Omnipotence could have opened very interesting possibilities. After falling victim to Eida&#39;s power, she would literally forget who her son is, and this would be an amazing angle to capture and explore. If Hinata&#39;s bonds with her family would have proven too strong, she could have been yet another person outside of Eida and Kawaki&#39;s control. She could have supervised a plan of action with Sarada and Sumire to stop Kawaki, and return her son to his rightful place.






 Hinata Could Have Finally Reached Her Full Potential In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex 
          

Whatever role she would play, the point is that having Hinata present during the events of the time skip would not only add an extra dimension to the story, but also provide an opportunity for the character to finally live up to the potential she has been showing since Naruto. While it&#39;s still possible for Hinata to have a bigger role in the story, the history of Naruto and Boruto sidelining her suggests it&#39;s rather unlikely.

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex is available from Viz Media and Manga Plus.
