# Genius Marvel Theory Explains Secret Reason the MCU Revolved Around Tony Stark


## SUMMARY 



  Magic is not as powerful as it seems in the Marvel Universe. Science, represented by Iron Man, holds the true power, explaining why the MCU was so effectively anchored by Iron Man during its formative phases.   Iron Man&#39;s ability to think and strategize scientifically sets him apart from other superheroes who rely on magic or other sources of power.   Science consistently counters and strips away magic in the Marvel Universe, proving its dominance, with Iron Man as its favored champion.

## Literature Review

In the MCU, Iron Man sits at the center of a universe filled with beings capable of immense power - all because he represents Marvel&#39;s driving force.

The Marvel Universe is filled with beings of world-changing power, yet Iron Man frequently finds himself at the center of its biggest conflicts – especially in the MCU. On the surface, having an engineer at the heart of a reality brimming with magic makes little sense. Mother Righteous, on of the X-Men’s most sinister villains, gives some insight behind the reason: magic is not nearly as powerful as it seems.

Immortal X-Men #18 – by Kieron Gillen, Juan José Ryp, David Curiel, and Clayton Cowles – finds Mother Righteous attempting to become a god-like Dominion. Over time, she has used magic to achieve her ends, but as she explains in the issue, “If magic was actually powerful, it’d be ruling the world already.”

          




In the grand scheme of the universe, that means something else rules in its place: science. Tony Stark represents the idea perhaps better than anyone else – his foundation as a hero is built upon his understanding of science. The idea is emphasized even more in the MCU, which held Tony as its central figure for so long.

 Iron Man Is The Marvel Universe&#39;s Anchor To Science Amidst The Chaos Of Magic 
          

When Wanda Maximoff can shatter reality with three words, or Thanos can wipe out half of existence with a snap, it’s easy to assume magic is the most terrible, powerful force in the Marvel Universe. There is no denying the effect it can have or its ability to create change, good or bad, but it has no staying power. Marvel has propped up the idea that no matter what magic accomplishes, someone will out-think it, or find a way around it eventually. Tony Stark isn’t the only big brain working toward that end, either. Reed Richards, Beast, and other scientifically inclined characters often think their way around magical issues.




What sets Iron Man apart is the idea that he was built by science alone. No bombardment of cosmic rays, genetic twists, or encounters with gods made him what he is. His successes and failures are rooted in science, and it’s the only reason he can face the endless onslaught of high-powered beings that come his way. The MCU takes that a step further, making its magic harder to control and less impressive overall, as Asgardians and other god-like beings don’t wield the same amount of power, or do so consistently. An engineer in a metal suit stopped the Infinity Gauntlet as surely as his Hulkbuster armor hemmed in Bruce Banner during his rages.



 Magic In The Marvel Universe Is Unpredictable, But Science Provides A Counterpoint 
          

One of the greatest weaknesses of magic is its unpredictability. Even those who exhibit great mastery over it, like Doctor Strange, spend much of their time handling magic itself rather than shaping the universe with it. It’s regarded by some as poorly understood technology, rather than something unfathomable and mystical. Tony even remarks, amid the Contest of Chaos, that he’ll trust his gadgets over Scarlet Witch’s “glowing red fingers.” Tony and others, like Dr. Doom, repeatedly used science to counteract even those as gifted as the Beyonders. Time and again, science counters or strips away magic, proving itself to be the driving force of the Marvel Universe with Iron Man at its helm.
