## Literature Review

Skurge stole the scene in Thor: Ragnarok, but now he shares a bond with the Thunder God--and it may spell doom for both.




Warning: contains spoilers for Avengers Inc. #3!




The MCU’s Skurge just redefined Thor lore forever with the secret of his death. Skurge, also known as the Executioner, was one of Thor’s greatest villains, frequently collaborating with the Thunder God’s enemies. Skurge endeared himself to audiences when he made the jump to live action in 2017’s Thor: Ragnarök, and now, as seen in Avengers Inc. #3, he shares a special connection to Thor that will have long-term ramifications.

Avengers Inc #3 is written by Al Ewing and drawn by Leonard Kirk. While working on a case involving Skurge, Janet Van Dyne, Victor Shade and Jane Foster confront Odin, who brings them up to speed on the Executioner: he is in Valhalla because he died a noble hero&#39;s death. Odin reveals that Thor was fated to die at that battle, but instead Skurge “stole” it.

          




Because Skurge took what was meant for Thor, they now share a bond, one Odin plans to use to save Thor’s life.

As Odin recounts the details of Skurge’s heroic sacrifice, it becomes clear it is a shout-out to the character’s scene-stealing turn in Thor: Ragnarök. Skurge is one of Thor’s oldest villains, first appearing in 1964’s Journey Into Mystery #103. A frequent ally of the Enchantress, Skurge the Executioner is one of Asgard’s most fearsome residents. Karl Urban brought Skurge to life in Ragnarök, perfectly capturing the character’s slimy essence. Ironically, Skurge ended up saving many lives as he fought off Hela’s forces, making him into a fan favorite in the process.

Now Skurge’s relationship with Thor has changed forever, and it could potentially end with the Thunder God’s death. In Asgardian culture, a heroic death such as Skurge’s is highly desirable, particularly when it comes about in combat. Valhalla is full of Asgardian warriors who fell in battle, and that now includes Skurge. However, Skurge was not meant to die in this way. He stole Thor’s heroic death, which has forged a connection between them, for the first time in their lives. How exactly this new connection between Thor and Skurge will play out remains to be seen, but Odin has foreseen bad times ahead for the Thunder God.



 Will Skurge Save Thor From the Elder Gods? 
          

Odin’s premonition of doom in Avengers Inc. #3 creates a crossover of sorts with Odinson&#39;s current book: Immortal Thor. Also written by Avengers Inc scribe Al Ewing, Immortal Thor has also hinted that something bad is in store for the Thunder God. The Elder Gods, those above Odin and the rest, are returning to our reality–and they are angry. The Elder Gods have their sights on Thor, and there may be no stopping them. If the MCU’s Skurge and Thor do share a bond, it could spell the end for both of them.
