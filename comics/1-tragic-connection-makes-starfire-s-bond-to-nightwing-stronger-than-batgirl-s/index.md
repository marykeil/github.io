## Literature Review

Nightwing has had a lot of iconic love interests over the years, but one dark connection gives him a special bond with Starfire.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Titans #6!Nightwing has been with many women over the years, but his two most iconic love interests have always been Batgirl and Starfire. While both characters have tons of things in common with Nightwing, Starfire just pointed out the unique bond she shares with Dick Grayson.




When Starfire is recounting her past in Titans #6, she describes the tragedy of witnessing her parents die in front of her. As she points out, this tragedy is the same one that Nightwing went through as a kid, and apparently it was a major reason their relationship hit it off as well as it did. The issue comes from Tom Taylor, Travis Moore, Tamra Bonvillain, and Wes Abbott.

         

Because of the shared tragedy of seeing their parents slain, Nightwing and Starfire had a deep personal connection despite literally coming from different worlds. It shows how Starfire isn&#39;t just Nightwing&#39;s love interest from his Teen Titans days, but someone who fully understands the trauma that defined him as a hero, and vice versa.

                  DC Officially Names the Titans&#39; 2 Most Powerful Members   As “Beast World” rages on, two Titans are recognized for their strengths. But a new development in the unfolding chaos hints at the danger they’re in.   





 Starfire Admits the Tragedy She Shares With Nightwing 
Dick and Kori Became Superheroes After Losing Their Parents
          

The entire reason that Bruce Wayne adopted Dick Grayson was due to the tragedy that they shared. When Bruce Wayne was very young, he saw his parents killed in front of him. When Dick was very young, he witnessed his parents die after their acrobatic performance was sabotaged. This trauma is what led Dick Grayson to eventually become the hero Nightwing. The death of his parents was the biggest event in Dick&#39;s life, and it&#39;s what set everything else in motion. This is an event that few people can relate to, but Bruce Wayne could, and so can Starfire.

Fans are incredibly divided on whether Nightwing should &#39;end up&#39; with Batigrl or Starfire, even as all three heroes have their own adventures and love interests. Dick&#39;s bond with Batgirl is often connected to their past - they both grew up fighting crime in Gotham and have known each other since they were young kids fighting to make the world a better place. In contrast, Dick&#39;s bond with Starfire is often seen as part of his shift from sidekick to solo hero, striking out on his own away from Gotham. However, both relationships are deeper than that, as Starfire&#39;s story shows that her and Dick&#39;s connection emerges from the deepest and most foundational traumas of their lives - long before either lived the life of a vigilante.






 Starfire and Nightwing Have An Iconic Relationship 
Whichever Couple You Ship, Dick and Kori&#39;s Bond Is Deeper Than the Titans
          

Batgirl was the first love of Nightwing&#39;s life, and has been a friend and ally through thick and thin. However, the idea that she&#39;s Dick&#39;s one &#39;true&#39; love isn&#39;t true. Starfire and Nightwing didn&#39;t just get together because they were thrust together by Titans membership - they are people who went through a very specific experience and had the same heroic reaction. While Batgirl and Dick are currently together in the comics, Starfire&#39;s origin underlines why her bond with Nightwing will always be unbreakable, and why this love triangle is easily DC&#39;s most compelling.
