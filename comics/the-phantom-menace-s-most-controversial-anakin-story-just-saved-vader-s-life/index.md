# The Phantom Menace s Most Controversial Anakin Story Just Saved Vader s Life


## SUMMARY 



  In Darth Vader #41, the former Anakin Skywalker uses his skills as a droid-builder to rebuild an army of droids under his control, saving himself from an attack by the Empire and buying him time against the Scourge.   The controversial retcon from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, which made Darth Vader C3PO&#39;s &#34;maker,&#34; has been justified several times by Marvel&#39;s current Star Wars comics.   The &#34;Dark Droids&#34; crossover event emphasizes the relationship between Vader and droids, highlighting his connection to machines from even before he became part-machine himself.

## Literature Review

Darth Vader couldn&#39;t have achieved what he does against the ancient artificial intelligence known as Scourge without The Phantom Menace&#39;s retcon.




Warning: Spoilers for Star Wars: Darth Vader #41




Darth Vader just saved himself by employing a particular skill set he learned as a result of a controversial retcon from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace – where it was famously, or perhaps infamously, revealed that Anakin Skywalker built C-3PO. This part of franchise lore remains controversial. However, a recent issue of Marvel&#39;s Darth Vader ongoing series just found a way to justify it.

Darth Vader #41 – by writer Greg Pak, artist Raffaele Ienco, colorist Federico Blee and VC&#39;s letterer Joe Caramagna – finds the Dark Lord of the Sith continuing to battle the ancient artificial intelligence known as the Scourge. Darth Vader risks letting the Scourge into his mind in order to trap it in a portion of his armor, in the process separating it from a group of robots under its control.

          




However, this state prevents Vader from leveraging Scourge&#39;s influence over the freed droids, so he rebuilds them until he gains full control over them, on par with the ancient AI.

                  &#34;The Final Barrier Is Broken&#34;: Star Wars Officially Debuts the Ultimate Weapon Against All Organic Life   Star Wars is nearing the end of its Dark Droids crossover, and the Scourge has finally figured out how to corrupt more than just droids alone.   


 Phantom Menace Revealed Anakin Skywalker To Be A Mechanical Prodigy 
         

Following the release of The Phantom Menance, many fans disliked that the prequel&#39;s attempt to connect the franchise&#39;s most recognizable droid with its iconic villain, in part because it made Star Wars&#39; massive galaxy seem much smaller. Part of the &#34;Dark Droids&#34; crossover event, a story which has already warranted Darth Vader and C3PO&#39;s controversial relationship, Darth Vader #41 makes it clear Vader has the means to rebuild almost any droid, given that The Phantom Menace established he was able to construct a complicated droid such as C3PO when he was a kid. The movie established Anakin Skywalker as a prodigy when it comes to droid construction, and now Vader #41 pays that off.




With these droids, Vader is able to protect himself from the Empire, which had just launched an attack on him after he recently used the story of Darth Plagueis the Wise to justify overthrowing Palpatine. Unfortunately, they prove to be no match against the Scourge. The ancient AI bests Vader every time the Sith Lord tries to overtake it with his droids, as the Scourge has countless more under its control. It is ultimately a display of Vader&#39;s raw power that helps him defeat the enemy – but only because his skills as a droid-builder helped buy him crucial time.

          

Considering the Scourge is the most dangerous artificial intelligence to ever threaten the Star Wars galaxy, it is fitting that the Marvel&#39;s &#34;Dark Droids&#34; crossover event has taken time to emphasize this aspect of canon, the relationship between Vader and droids in general. As &#34;more machine than man,&#34; Vader has, of course, found himself at the very center of the current conflict. Whether fans appreciate his personal connection with C-3PO or not, there is no doubting now that this controversial retcon from Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace saved Darth Vader&#39;s life at a pivotal moment, as the final confrontation with the Scourge plays out.
