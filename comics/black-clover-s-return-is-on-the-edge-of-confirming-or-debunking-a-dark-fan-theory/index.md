# Black Clover s Return is on the Edge of Confirming or Debunking a Dark Fan Theory


## SUMMARY 



  Black Clover chapter #369 reveals that Luck and Magna have already used up half of Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic. Fans are now left wondering if they will lose their magical powers once the Anti-Magic wears off.   Contrary to initial expectations, Asta&#39;s transfer of Anti-Magic to the Black Bulls doesn&#39;t automatically destroy their own magic. This is because Asta used the reverse Demon-Dweller Sword ability, which absorbs and wields other forms of magic without destroying them.   While it&#39;s just a theory, the introduction of a limit to the Anti-Magic usage creates suspense and allows fans to see what will happen to the Black Bulls&#39; powers in the future.

## Literature Review

Although originally disproven, a new dark theory about Anti-Magic has emerged thanks to a recent twist in Black Clover&#39;s first chapter in Jump GIGA.




Warning: Spoilers for Black Clover chapter #369Black Clover&#39;s debut release in Jump GIGA came with a bang when the Black Bulls Magna and Luck unleashed their Anti-Magic-enhanced powers against one of Lucius Zogratis&#39; clones. Some fans were initially surprised when Asta bestowed his Anti-Magic on the Black Bulls. None of them seemed negatively affected in Black Clover&#39;s final Shonen Jump chapter, but the latest installment has set a timer that will confirm or reject a dark fan theory positing the Black Bulls who received Anti-Magic from Asta could end up losing their powers once the Anti-Magic wears out.




In chapter #369 of Black Clover by Yuki Tabata, Luck and Magna completely destroy one of Lucius Zogratis&#39; clones by combining their own magical powers with Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic. However, during the fight, the clone confirms that the two of them had already burned through half of Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic.

          

This means that when both of them have fully burned through it all, fans will be able to see what they will be left with at the end. Is it possible that Luck and Magna will have no magical powers at all?


 Black Clover Could Confirm or Deny That Luck &amp; Magna Will Lose Their Powers 
          

Black Clover has established many times that Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic completely seeks out and destroys all forms of magic. So it came as a shock when Asta learned he could transfer his Anti-Magic to people in chapter #367. Based on past precedent, it was assumed that the transfer would cause the Anti-Magic to destroy the recipients&#39; own magic. However, Jump GIGA&#39;s first Black Clover chapter quickly proved that both powers can live harmoniously under this process. Now there&#39;s just the question of whether or not their original magical abilities will disappear along with the Anti-Magic once it fades.




The fact that the Black Bulls can harness Anti-Magic along with their own powers is possible because Asta didn&#39;t directly attack them with Anti-Magic. He reversed the use of his Demon-Dweller Sword, which normally absorbs another caster&#39;s magic. This is important because the sword is actually an Anti-Magic artifact. The fact that it is composed of Anti-Magic and yet can naturally absorb and wield other forms of magic without destroying them proves that when using it in reverse with the Black Bulls, the process shouldn&#39;t destroy their other magical powers.

In essence, the reverse Demon-Dweller Sword ability is treating the Black Bulls like Demon-Dweller Swords that are now absorbing Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic and using it with their own. However, the reverse Demon-Dweller Sword ability is experimental, so who&#39;s to say that when the Anti-Magic fades, the Black Bulls&#39; magical powers won&#39;t? 

          




Of course, this is all just a theory, so it&#39;s plausible that the Black Bulls won&#39;t lose their normal powers. That said, the fact that Black Clover introduced a limit whereby the Black Bulls could burn through their Anti-Magic made it possible for fans to see what they will be left with sooner rather than later.
