Summary

  Catwoman believes Gotham needs a new kind of Batman, one that focuses on protecting the suburbs where regular people are affected by petty crimes.   A man with amnesia who believes he is Batman has been protecting the suburbs, gaining praise from Catwoman.   Catwoman tries to prevent the real Batman from interfering with amnesiac Batman&#39;s work, arguing that the Bat-Signal is rarely lit for people who truly need help.  







Catwoman and Batman have a complicated relationship, and even though Catwoman has no doubt that Bruce Wayne is a hero to the people of Gotham, she still admits she thinks the city needs a new kind of Batman. While Bruce does a lot to help people in Gotham, his focus is usually on high-end crimes that threaten the city on the whole, and Catwoman believes that a Batman closer to the streets might be just what Gotham truly needs.

In the story &#34;Pygmalion&#34; from Batman: The Brave and the Bold #7 by Guillem March and Arif Prianto, Batman seems to have amnesia. He spends most of his days training with the civilians he&#39;s staying with, trying to relearn his skills so he can continue protecting Gotham. When Catwoman finally tracks Batman down, she praises the work he&#39;s been doing.

          




She appreciates that he&#39;s been protecting people down in the suburbs of Gotham instead of in the &#34;downtown penthouses.&#34; Catwoman argues that this is where Batman is truly needed; unfortunately, Batman doesn&#39;t seem convinced and leaves for the Bat-Signal.

                  The Winner of the Gotham War Isn&#39;t Batman or Catwoman - It&#39;s [SPOILER]   The Gotham War event has concluded with less of a bang and more of a whimper - but everything has played out as its true mastermind had designed.   


 Catwoman Believes a New Kind of Batman Could Save Gotham 
          

Batman has always tried to prevent crime as best he can, but considering the amount of threats Gotham faces every night, he often has to prioritize. Instead of stopping a mugging or a break-in in the suburbs, he has to prevent a super-villain&#39;s bank robbery downtown. While this crime-fighting method likely saves the most people, it still leaves the suburbs unprotected. When Catwoman meets this amnesiac Batman, she tries to convince him to stay where he is, ignore the Bat-Signal, and continue what he&#39;s doing now. She even argues that the Bat-Signal is almost never lit for the little people who truly need it. While this may seem like an odd argument for Catwoman to bring to Batman, there&#39;s an important reason she&#39;s doing this.




The amnesiac Batman whom Catwoman speaks to isn&#39;t actually Bruce Wayne. Instead, Frank Freeman is a former thief who suffers amnesia after a jetpack he stole from Batman ran out of fuel, causing him to crash. When Frank awoke, he was covered in the Batman gear he had stolen and naturally came to the conclusion that he was indeed Batman. Frank has been &#34;fighting crime&#34; in the suburbs, slowly training to regain his military skills — with Catwoman watching him the entire time. Instead of turning Frank over to the real Batman or the police, she sees the good he does for the neighborhood, a kind of good that Bruce simply isn&#39;t doing. This is why she tries to advise him away from the Bat-Signal, which ends up being a trap set by the real Batman.



 Catwoman Tries To Prevent DC&#39;s New Batman From Leaving 
          




Catwoman and Batman haven&#39;t always seen eye to eye about how to solve crime in Gotham. Bruce often tries to use his wealth to enact social changes in the city that might eventually address the true causes of crime. As Batman, he tries to take on criminals who are much too violent to be left alone, such as the Joker or Two-Face — but this doesn&#39;t leave Batman time for the petty crimes that affect regular people. This is why, when presented with a second version of the Dark Knight, Catwoman tries to give Gotham a new (and better) Batman.
