Summary

  Transformers #4, set to release in January 2024, will feature the return of a powerful Autobot as the Energon Universe expands.   Optimus Prime, along with the wounded Spike and Sparkplug Witwicky, seeks help from Ratchet after a devastating encounter with the Decepticon Skywarp.   The identity of the Autobot that Ratchet will revive remains unknown, but Arcee is a top contender due to her expertise in sharpshooting and combat skills.  







The Transformers are back and better than ever thanks to publisher Skybound Entertainment, as the Energon Universe era continues strong into 2024. The publisher recently revealed a preview for January’s Transformers #4, which teases the return of one powerful Autobot as the universe expands.

Coming from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer, and Rus Wooten, the preview for Transformers #4 (released via Skybound.com) finds Optimus Prime escaping with a wounded Spike and his father Sparkplug Witwicky in his cab, following what looks to be a devastating encounter with the Decepticon Skywarp.

         

As Optimus flees from an attack by Starscream, he calls Ratchet for help. Although he’s working on reviving Wheeljack, the Autobots’ chief medic decides to delay repairing his old friend and instead bring back an Autobot with more “firepower.”





 Which Autobot Will Be Appearing in Transformers #4? 
          

The preview cuts off before fans can see which Autobot Ratchet is talking about, but there are a few possibilities as to the identity of this &#39;bot. When Skybound announced that the company had acquired the license from Hasbro, the publisher released the cast of Autobot characters set to appear in the new series, which includes Optimus Prime, Ratchet, Cliffjumper, Wheeljack and Arcee. Optimus and Ratchet were both revived in Transformers #1, and Cliffjumper was repaired in #2. Ratchet was also seen working on Wheeljack in the second issue, which he still appears to be doing in next year’s Transformers #4. Given that he stops working on Wheeljack to revive another Autobot, fans can only assume that the new character will be Arcee.

As the Autobots’ expert sharpshooter, Arcee certainly fits the bill of having more “firepower.” Paired with her considerable hand-to-hand combat skills, Arcee is easily one of the Autobots&#39; deadliest warriors, so it would make sense that Ratchet would stop what he’s doing to revive her to help his friends in their hour of need. Optimus and his Autobots are going to need all the help they can get, considering that the supercomputer Teletraan I was destroyed in Transformers #1, thus limiting the number of active Robots in Disguise running around Earth. Of course, it’s also entirely possible that Johnson and his collaborators are about to swerve and introduce a hitherto unannounced Autobot in Transformers #4.






 The Energon Universe Has a Limited Number of Active Transformers 
          

Whatever the case, the fourth issue looks like a story that fans won’t want to miss. With Starscream pursuing a damaged Optimus and a wounded Spike, the stage is set for a dramatic confrontation. It will also be interesting to see Spike’s girlfriend Carly seeking vengeance on the Decepticons, as Starscream coldly murdered her father at the end of the first issue. It’s certainly never been a better time to be a fan of the Transformers as Skybound continues to build the Energon Universe in exciting new ways.



Transformers #4 is available January 10th, 2024 from Skybound.
