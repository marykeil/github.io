## Literature Review

The status of number one contender for Hulk&#39;s status as Marvel&#39;s strongest character came down to a brawl between Venom and Juggernaut.




Even taking for granted that Hulk is the Marvel Universe&#39;s strongest character, the question of who is closest to him in terms of power remains to be asked. One name that quickly enters the conversation is Juggernaut – and while readers might not immediately think to add Venom to the mix, a confrontation between Marvel&#39;s first symbiote and the crimson giant proved that the &#34;Lethal Protector&#34; is one of Marvel&#39;s true powerhouses.




Venom Annual (2018) #1 contained the story &#34;Unstoppable&#34; by James Stokoe and Travis Lanham, which featured Juggernaut being hired to act as muscle for the mob, in order to intimidate a lawyer. Surprisingly, Venom appeared on the scene to prevent this – leading to a fight, one with a surprising outcome, for readers and Juggernaut alike.



          



While most fans would expect that Venom would be in for a tough fight, facing off against Juggernaut, instead Venom easily defeated Juggernaut. Venom showed off the extent of his strength by tossing Juggernaut around several times, which is an absurd feat when fighting someone as large and strong as Juggernaut.

                  It&#39;s a Shame Marvel Didn&#39;t Just Kill Juggernaut: The Secret of His Powers Could Change Everything   Juggernaut nearly died at the end of Hellfire Gala, then again once in Orchis custody, yet both times he made it out alive - &amp; that&#39;s a real shame.    





 Venom&#39;s Face-Off With Juggernaut Had A Surprising Outcome 


          

The Juggernaut is one of the most physically powerful characters in the entire Marvel Universe. Part of this comes from the fact that Juggernaut is an avatar of the God of Destruction, Cyttorak. Juggernaut is so powerful that he has physically torn down the barriers between realities before. Many people would consider Juggernaut&#39;s physical strength right up around iconic characters such as the Hulk, but Venom has proved without a doubt that his strength and skills are capable of matching the crimson giant. In their battle, from Venom Annual #1, Venom was not only able to physically overpower Juggernaut in a few different ways, but he also expertly redirected Juggernaut&#39;s own strength, using it against him.

Venoms powers physical strength is accentuated by his other abilities; despite Venom&#39;s large size, he is surprisingly quick and agile, and is well aware of how to use the enemy&#39;s skills against them. One of the major things that Juggernaut is known for is being an unstoppable force; when Juggernaut starts moving, he physically can not be contained. In Venom Annual #1, to counter this, Venom doesn&#39;t bother trying to stop him, instead settling for redirecting him. This strategy allows Venom to keep up and match Juggernaut, which in turn gave him the opportunity to display strength that is equal to, if not greater than, the infamous mutant anti-hero.






 Venom Defeated Juggernaut As Thoroughly As Anyone Has 


          



The Incredible Hulk was Marvel Comics&#39; first true powerhouse character, operating at an absurd level of superhuman strength – while characters with incredible strength levels are now proliferate in Marvel, Hulk has largely remained the standard by which all of them are judged. Introduced in 1965, just three years after Hulk, Juggernaut has long been one of Hulk&#39;s peers in the upper echelon of Marvel strength levels. Since his own introduction in 1988, Venom has become a progressively stronger character – with his thorough physical handling of Juggernaut firmly inaugurating the symbiote anti-hero into his and Hulk&#39;s class of pure strength.

The Juggernaut is an absurdly powerful physical combatant, but ultimately, he isn&#39;t unbeatable. He lacks great mobility, and he has very few ranged options, both of which are tactical aspects of Venom&#39;s fighting ability that he thrives on. Instead of trying to face Juggernaut directly, Venom continually dodged his abilities and disrupted the ground under Juggernaut, preventing him from becoming an unstoppable force. This enabled Venom to eventually physically overcome his opponent, displaying his own incredible strength in the process. Despite how powerful Juggernaut truly is, Venom proved himself to be the stronger fighter when he brought down the crimson giant, in what was an especially humiliating defeat.
