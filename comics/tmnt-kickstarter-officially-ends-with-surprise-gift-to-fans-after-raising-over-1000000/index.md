## Literature Review

Surpassing its original $250,000 goal, the Kickstarter for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness is a major success story.




Palladium Books&#39; Kickstarter for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness has officially ended, having earned more than $1,000,000 from backers. Planned to ship in September 2024, the tabletop RPG is a remastered version of the 1985 classic, including new art, updated and clarified rules, a celebration of the original game, and a host of extras.




Via its Kickstarter, Palladium Books has announced the end of its fundraising project for TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness, which originally sought just $250,000 for a Redux Edition of the classic game.

Thanking fans, Palladium Books has promised its BackerKit pledge manager will soon be live, allowing supporters to finalize their purchases.

 TMNT Kickstarter Earns $1,277,496 
Palladium Books Unlocks All Stretch Goals (Including $1,400,000 April O&#39;Neil)
         




Launched in 1985, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness is an in-depth roleplaying game set in the world of the original comics (which are significantly darker than the iconic &#39;80s animated TV show.) The game allows fans to design their own mutated animal or dinosaur, then take them on adventures in a world of ninjas, magic, time travel, and alternate dimensions. Indeed, one of the stretch goals unlocked is an introductory adventure from the current writer of TMNT comics over at IDW Publishing, Sophie Campbell. Palladium Books&#39; Sean Owen Roberson thanked fans for backing the project, saying:


Again, as someone who personally found this hobby through the 1985 TMNT RPG, I&#39;m ecstatic with the success of this project and humbled by your support as we bring this classic back in redux style - thank you from me and the rest of the Palladium Books team.




Showing signs of its later success, the Kickstarter for TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness reached its initial funding goal of $250,000 - allowing the project to go ahead - within only four hours.

While the Redux Edition will see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness remastered with new art and improved content, it will also act as a tribute to the wider franchise. TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman has promised to include unseen materials from his personal files, while a murderer&#39;s row of creators have contributed art and stories about the franchise. With immediate and immense backing from fans, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &amp; Other Strangeness&#39; Kickstarter has been a huge success, and Palladium Books is thanking fans by unlocking every stretch goal as the campaign concludes.
