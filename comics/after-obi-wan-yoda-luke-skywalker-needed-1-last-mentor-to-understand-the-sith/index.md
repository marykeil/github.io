## Literature Review

Luke Skywalker had one mentor after Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda to understand the Sith before Return of the Jedi, which could redefine Vader&#39;s redemption.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars #42 Luke Skywalker’s journey to becoming the Jedi Knight introduced in Return of the Jedi is still being told in Star Wars canon, as it seems he needed one more mentor to understand the Sith who movie fans never saw, even after his training with Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi.




Luke begins his Jedi journey with Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. Obi-Wan had been tasked with watching over Luke on Tatooine since Luke was a child, and when the time finally came to train him in the ways of the Force, Obi-Wan was there to do so. After Luke’s training with Obi-Wan came to an abrupt and tragic end, Obi-Wan told Luke that his training would continue with another surviving Jedi Master: Yoda.

          

Luke trained with Yoda on Dagobah in Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. It was at this point when Luke was given glimpses into the dark side of the Force, as Yoda wanted to warn him of its dangers, and its seduction. However, before Luke’s training was complete, he left Yoda to go help his friends, as they were in the clutches of Darth Vader. And now, in the current continuity of Star Wars comics set between the events of Episode V and VI, Luke Skywalker has found yet another expert in the Force: Auntie Feez.




                  &#34;The Schism Imperial&#34;: Star Wars Officially Unveils the Empire&#39;s Secret Society (The Rebellion&#39;s True Opposite)   The Schism Imperial has just been introduced in Star Wars canon, a secret society within the Empire working to remove Emperor Palpatine from power.    


 Auntie Feez Helped Luke Skywalker Understand the Sith Better Than Obi-Wan or Yoda 
         

In Star Wars #42 by Charles Soule and Steven Cummings, Luke is attempting to purify a red kyber crystal, so he seeks the help of a member of the Fallanassi race he befriended named Gretta. When he finds her, Luke is surprised to see that she isn’t alone, as Gretta’s aunt, Auntie Feez, is also there and offers her assistance.

The Fallanassi once committed themselves to the study of kyber, as they have an inherently strong connection with the living crystals. Years ago, the Fallanassi would regularly heal bled kyber crystals - a science/artform Auntie Feez still knew. So, with Feez’s help, Luke Skywalker ventures into the metaphysical realm of the kyber crystal to meet the fragmented spirit of the Sith that resides within it, hoping to redeem them.






 If Luke Skywalker Redeems This Mysterious Sith, That Will Redefine Vader’s Redemption 
          

This issue ends with Luke Skywalker successfully entering the secluded realm that was created within this kyber when the Sith who bled it poured their very essence into the crystal. Therefore, it’s unknown at this time if Luke is successful in purifying the crystal at all, meaning fans don’t know if he is able to redeem this mysterious Sith. However, if he does succeed, it will be because of the ‘training’ Auntie Feez put him through by helping him merge his mind with the red kyber crystal. Not only that, but the method used by Luke to redeem this mysterious Sith (again, if he’s able to) would likely be the same one he used to help redeem Darth Vader. Vader chose redemption upon seeing his son attacked by Palpatine, meaning Luke didn’t do much aside from simply being Vader’s son and experiencing torment by his master’s hand. Could Luke have actually had more of a hand in Vader’s redemption than was immediately obvious in Return of the Jedi? At the moment, it’s unclear. But if he did, then this hypothetical method of Sith redemption could assuredly be attributed to his experience redeeming this mysterious Sith with the help of Auntie Feez.




Regardless of whether this experience helped Luke redeem Darth Vader, Auntie Feez showed Luke Skywalker the inner workings of a Sith’s mind in ways Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda never did, proving that she was the last mentor he needed before becoming a true Jedi Knight by the end of the Star Wars original trilogy.

Star Wars #42 by Marvel Comics is available now.
