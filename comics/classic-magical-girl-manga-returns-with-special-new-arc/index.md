## Literature Review

Kodansha&#39;s Nakayoshi magazine announced that it will publish a &#34;Special Arc&#34; for Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card in its April 2024 issue.




CLAMP&#39;s Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card is set to receive a &#34;Special Arc&#34; after its conclusion. The manga&#39;s final chapter was published on December 1 in Nakayoshi magazine&#39;s January 2024 issue. A few weeks earlier, the series&#39; 15th volume was released in Japan, while its 14th volume was released in English-speaking territories.




CLAMP announced on their official X account (formerly Twitter) on November 30 stating that a &#34;Special Arc&#34; will be published in Nakayoshi magazine&#39;s April 2024 issue. They specified no other details except the release date, which is scheduled for March 1.


 

This announcement comes in light of the news regarding CLAMP&#39;s exhibition, which will be held in Tokyo from July 3 to September 23, 2024.


 The Cardcaptor Sakura sequel Takes Place After the Events Of the Original Manga 
Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card is a direct sequel to the iconic manga and was set to end in 2022
          

The story picks up after Sakura Kinomoto captures the Clow Cards and turns them into Sakura Cards. She&#39;s now starting her first day of middle school with her friends, including Shaoran Li, who has moved back to Tomoeda. One night, she has a prophetic dream where she meets a mysterious cloaked figure. Upon waking up, she finds that all her Sakura cards have become clear and completely powerless. Thus begins Sakura&#39;s adventure to find out how to restore the cards, this time as master of the Clow Cards, and joined by new friends.




The manga has been running since 2016 as a continuation of the beloved classic of the magical girl genre, Cardcaptor Sakura. In 2018, Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card received an anime adaptation in 2018 that will continue in a sequel whose release date is yet to be announced. In 2022, the series&#39; official X (formerly Twitter) account announced that the manga&#39;s 14th volume would be its last. CLAMP then took to social media to announce another volume. Six months after the post, however, they once again stated that the series would be extended by another, final volume. The final chapter&#39;s release date was confirmed only a few days before its magazine release.

                  10 Manga Whose Creators Helped Make Their Anime   A mangaka usually isn&#39;t involved with the making of an anime of their work, but these are 10 creators who made sure to be involved with their anime.   

Both Cardcaptor Sakura and its sequel were serialized in Nakayoshi, which is one of the best-selling shojo magazines in Japan. The magazine has released other famous titles in the past, such as Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon. It is published by Kodansha, Japan&#39;s largest publishing company. CLAMP is an all-female Japanese manga artist group, consisting in a writer and three artists, who have authored some of the most successful shojo and magical girls manga ever, such as X(1992), Magic Knight Rayearth (1993), and xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle (both 2003). There&#39;s currently no news on when volume 15 of Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card will come out in English, but it&#39;s safe to say that it won&#39;t be before next year.
