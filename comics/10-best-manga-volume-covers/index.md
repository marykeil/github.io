## Literature Review

Manga volume covers are an exciting aspect of the medium, with many illustrations becoming iconic across a variety of genres and demographics.




One of the most exciting parts about reading manga is the new art that welcomes a new volume. These full color covers are a breath of fresh air that constrasts with the standard black and white panelling in the volume, and offers gorgeous visual flair that adds depth to whatever is being featured in the volume.
A new manga volume, or tankoban in Japan, usually has between 14-16 chapters for a weekly series, and about 5 chapters for series that release new chapters monthly, and it is a tradition to include art at the front that not only gives the authors an outlet to show off their coloring skills but also gives the reader an idea of what is to come.
            
 
 10 Best Manga Time Skips That Changed Everything 
Timeskips are a common occurrence in manga, and some of them stand out by completely changing their stories for the better.












 








 10  Death Note Volume 12 
By Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata
        

Death Note went out with a bang with its final cover, proving that the series&#39; art is just as good as its suspenseful and brilliant story. The cover featured Light, L, Near and Mello, with the protagonist stretching his hands in a cross-shape, a reference to his ego and God complex. As much as he was the main character, his death was quite satisfying given how cruel and self-conceited he had been. Death Note is one of the most popular manga of all time and stands out as one of the best plot-driven series ever.

 9  Sakamoto Days Volume 7 
By Yuto Suzuki
        

A relatively new series, Sakamoto Days has been the talk of the town recently, not just for its action-packed premise that draws comparisons to John Wick, but it also has art that&#39;s hailed as one of Shonen Jump&#39;s best in a very long time. Yuto Suzuki&#39;s over-the-top art style, which includes some of the most impressive weaponry in the series, is depicted in the art that features Gaku with a huge hammer-like weapon that also has spikes. Sakamoto Days is an extremely underrated series is poised to be Shonen Jump&#39;s next big manga, and an eventual anime adaptation looks very realistic.

 8  One Piece Volume 60 
By Eichiro Oda
        

Although the cover of One Piece&#39;s 60th volume wasn&#39;t as memorable as the others, it packed the most emotional punch. Following the end of the epic Marineford arc, Luffy was at the lowest point of his life, not only witnessing the brutal death of his brother Ace in front of him, but not having his crew by his side. The cover shows the childhood version of Luffy, Ace, and Sabo, with the arc diving deeper into the lives of the three brothers. This was by far the saddest stretch of chapters, as fans truly understood the weight of Luffy&#39;s loss. Fortunately, Jimbei and Rayleigh were there for our beloved rubber man and helped him recover from the traumatic incident and become stronger.

 7  Vinland Saga Volume 16 
By Makoto Yukimura
        

It was almost impossible to imagine Thorfinn living a peaceful life after all that happened to him in his early years, but he managed to do it. From adopting a child and a dog, getting a beautiful wife and founding a peaceful city in Vinland, he became the kind and gentle man he always wished to be, and it was all symbolized on the cover of Volume 16. Sitting on the farm with his child and dog on a beautiful sunny day, few people deserved a good life more than Thorfinn.

 6  Tokyo Ghoul Volume 13 
By Sui Ishida
        

The bleak and ghostly art displayed in Tokyo Ghoul&#39;s 13th volume is the perfect representation of the story&#39;s atmosphere. On a snowy night, the investigators launched a full-scale assault on a small cafÃ© called Anteiku which was a meeting ground for ghouls. The agency wanted to down the Owl, a powerful and extremely dangerous ghoul that had slaughtered many people years ago but had disappeared ever since. The night was extremely tragic, not only displacing many ghouls who weren&#39;t a threat to humans, but also the death of Kaneki at the hands of the strongest investigator, Arima.

 5  Slam Dunk Volume 18 
By Takehiko Inoue
        

Slam Dunk is the premiere sports comic, and one of its strongest points was the constantly improving art that dazzled readers with every turn of the page. Takehiko Inoue was a brilliant artist, and an even better painter, with his coloring skills breathing life into his covers and hooking readers even before the book is opened. Sakuragi and Shuhoko&#39;s tough battle against Ryonan was at its peak, and the stakes were higher than ever, with the winner qualifying for the nationals. The art displayed Sakuragi attempting his famous &#34;commoner&#39;s shot&#34; with Fukuda attempting to block him and Akagi preparing himself to grab the rebound.

 4  Chainsaw Man Volume 1 
By Tatsuki Fujimoto
        

Chainsaw Man&#39;s covers are always vibrant, colorful, and full of life, and its first cover is its most iconic. It sums up the vibe of the series and shows the gore that will be present all throughout. Fujimoto&#39;s skills as an illustrator have never been doubted, with Fire Punch and Goodbye Eri displaying his skill as a mangaka. Although Chainsaw Man had a very noticeable drop in art quality as compared to his previous works, he let loose when it came to the manga covers. From using bright and varying colors to giving fans a hint of what&#39;s to come, Chainsaw Man was a great example of cover art done right.

 3  One-Punch Man Volume 20 
By Yusuke Murata
        

The One-Punch Man set of volume covers are like a jigsaw puzzle, and they can be put together to form a gorgeous piece of artwork. The cover of volume 20 is especially an eye-catcher, not only perfectly displaying the true beauty of Yusuke Murata&#39;s art style but also featuring many of the S-rank heroes in an epic start to the series&#39; biggest battle between humanity and the monsters. Murata stands out for his realistic art style, but his coloring and shading are also a huge point of strength for the new founder of an anime studio.

 2  Vagabond Volume 28 
By Takehiko Inoue
        

Described as a demon and a problem child ever since he was a child, Miyamoto Musashi&#39;s character development into an enlightened and wise man was one of the most beautiful journeys in fiction. The 28th cover was the first to show his new persona as a man who finally achieved inner peace and set his priorities straight. With his hands together in a praying gesture and a statue behind him, this cover was a tribute to the painful journey of the Japanese legend from centuries ago before becoming a philosopher and an incredible swordsman who left his legacy and mark for many years to come.

 1  Naruto Volume 70 
By Masashi Kishimoto
        

Even after 70 volumes and hundreds of chapters of incredible art, Kishimito&#39;s drawings were as gorgeous to look at as ever. The 70th volume was especially visually appealing, featuring Indra and Ashura, Madara and Hashirama, and Naruto and Sasuke, with Hagoromo at the center. This powerful piece was a comparison of the most powerful shinobi and enemies who were closer than blood, but their relationship turned sour. The genius and cold-hearted Indra reincarnated as Madara and Sasuke, while the hardworking and kind Ashura reincarnated as Hashirama and Naruto, showing that Naruto and Sasuke&#39;s fate had already played out two times, but they also had the chance to do it differently.
