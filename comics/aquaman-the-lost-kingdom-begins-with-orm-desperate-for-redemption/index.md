In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Special #1, readers find Orm imprisoned for his past crimes. Initially, Orm maintains unwavering faith in his ability to outsmart his wardens. He strategically bides his time, pretending submission in an attempt to deceive them. Using his experience as Atlantis&#39;s former King, Orm employs his knowledge of the prison&#39;s layout, fostering hope for a successful escape. However, his carefully planned jailbreak reveals a harsh reality â€“ his captors anticipated his every move. Orm realizes he was never as close to escape as he had believed, leading to a profound moment of realization that there is no hope of freedom for him.



Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is set to be the final DCEU movie before the universe is rebooted by James Gunn and Peter Safran in 2025.




During his continued confinement, Orm experiences profound inner turmoil. The solitude and the relentless reality of his imprisonment prompt extensive introspection. His once-stalwart demeanor crumbles, giving way to a soul weighed down by self-doubt and remorse. This internal transformation leads Orm to concede that his punishment is warranted, resigning himself to the probability of a life restricted within the confines of his cell. As the narrative nears its end, this solemn acceptance marks a significant turning point. Orm&#39;s shift in perspective sets the stage for his imminent encounter with Arthur, paving the way for an emotionally charged and fervent quest for redemption.
