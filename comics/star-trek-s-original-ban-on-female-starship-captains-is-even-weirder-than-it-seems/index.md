# Star Trek s Original Ban on Female Starship Captains Is Even Weirder Than It Seems


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: Mission&#39;s End #5 reveals that there was a real unofficial ban on women captains in the Star Trek universe, which contradicts the franchise&#39;s progressive vision for humanity.   Kirk informs Ambassador Casady that they can&#39;t pursue a relationship because it would be unprofessional, now that the ban on women starship captains has been lifted.   The ban on women captains in Starfleet is seen as a shameful chapter in its history, but it is important to note that it did not last long and was eventually corrected.

## Literature Review

Starfleet&#39;s ban on women starship captains in Kirk&#39;s time was odd, and now fans learn it was a very real, but unofficial, thing. 




Star Trek’s original ban on women captains is even weirder than it seems. As the Star Trek mythos has grown and developed, certain aspects of it have not aged well and its ban on women in the captain’s chair is one of them. Fan debates have raged for years over how to reconcile it with Trek’s utopian future, but in Star Trek: Mission’s End #5, fans learn it was a real thing–sort of.




Star Trek: Mission’s End #5 is written by Ty Templeton and drawn by Steve Molnar. Throughout the series, Kirk has had romantic feelings for Ambassador Casady, and the feeling is mutual. At the end, Casady wishes to pursue a relationship with Kirk, but he informs her that it would not be professional, due to the lifting of the unofficial ban on women starship captains. He informs her the USS Hawking needs a captain, and she is to take command.

          

Finally, he tells Casady that if they were to have a relationship, people may feel she did not earn the captain’s chair.


 Some Parts of Star Trek Have Not Aged Well 
          




For 57 years, Star Trek has depicted a utopian future free of the strife that has been a hallmark of the human condition–including racism, misogyny and homophobia. Yet in Star Trek’s third season, in the episode “The Turnabout Intruder,” Janice, a former lover of Kirk&#39;s, famously tells him that his world does not allow women to be starship captains. The line flies in the face of everything else fans know about Star Trek, inspiring passionate debate among fans over what it means. Most believe that Janice was merely implying Kirk’s personal world does not allow for women captains.

This solution makes sense. Other Star Trek shows set before the Original Series, such as Enterprise, Discovery and Strange New Worlds, have depicted plenty of women captains. This lends credence to the theory that Janice was referring to Kirk’s world. However, there have been instances in the franchise where seemingly incongruous laws have been seen. The most notable, other than the no women captains rule, was the death penalty for anyone visiting Talos IV. The death penalty and a highly misogynistic ban on captains are at odds with the future Star Trek depicts.

 Why Was There a Ban on Women Captains in the First Place? 
          

And yet, Star Trek: Mission’s End makes it clear that the ban on women captains was a very real, albeit unofficial, thing. The book, nor any other Star Trek media, has asked why this ban existed in the first place, as it flies in the face of the franchise’s progressive vision for humanity. Also, this ban could not have lasted long, as Strange New Worlds, set about five years before the Original Series, features a woman skipper in Captain Bartel. Starfleet’s ban on women captains is a shameful chapter in its history, although one it learned from and made sure never happens again.
