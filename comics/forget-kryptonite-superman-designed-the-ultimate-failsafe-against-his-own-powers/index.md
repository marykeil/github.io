# Forget Kryptonite - Superman Designed the Ultimate Failsafe Against His Own Powers


## SUMMARY 



  Superman has a gadget that can render him powerless by preventing his cells from absorbing yellow sunlight, making it the most effective way to defeat him.   The Kryptonian ability to absorb yellow sunlight was well-known on Krypton, prompting the creation of technology to block sunlight absorption.   Superman&#39;s desire to be a part of humanity and his collection of Kryptonian technology in his Fortress of Solitude led to his possession of the technology to disable his own powers.

## Literature Review

One of the great questions in the DC Universe is how to take down Superman. But it turns out that Superman himself has the best answer.




Superman is an absurdly powerful character, and anyone intending to fight him needs to have remarkable planning skills to stand any chance. That&#39;s why many characters, such as Lex Luthor and Batman, have come up with plans to defeat Superman — but none of them match the plans Superman has for himself.




The surprising answer to defeating Superman is revealed by Superman himself in Justice League Beyond 2.0 #2 by Christos Gage, Iban Coello, Randy Mayor, and Saida Temofonte. Superman&#39;s powers go out of control and put the world and his teammates at risk. Something has entered the sun, and it&#39;s causing Superman&#39;s powers to become unstable. One second, he&#39;s weaker than normal, and the next, he&#39;s far stronger than he should be.

          

When everyone else fails to find a cure for this, Superman simply brings out a gadget he has that prevents his cells from absorbing yellow sunlight. This renders him entirely powerless, which is far more effective than any other plan people have had for him.

 Superman Easily Disables His Own Powers 
Justice League Beyond 2.0 #2 Reveals the Perfect Anti-Superman Plan
          

Villains are always looking to remove Superman&#39;s powers. The Man of Steel is one of the most effective crime fighters in comics simply because of how absurdly powerful he is. Fighting Superman one-on-one is an almost impossible task. Unless the villain has power equal to or above Superman, the only option is to drag Superman&#39;s power level down. Lex Luthor and Batman both usually resort to Kryptonite to achieve this, but it&#39;s not the only option. As Superman reveals, it&#39;s not even the most effective option.

The Kryptonian ability to absorb yellow sunlight was well-known on Krypton; it&#39;s one of the reasons why they banned space travel. The Kryptonian government knew how much damage they could do to the universe at large, so they simply didn&#39;t allow Kryptonians to leave the planet. It makes sense that instead of removing their citizens&#39; freedom to go where they want, they&#39;d look into more reasonable ways to deal with their own biology. Superman reveals that he has Kryptonian microtech that can block his cells from absorbing sunlight entirely. This tech was likely created to allow Kryptonians to live normal lives under different colored suns if they so chose. It would likely also be the best way to take down any Kryptonian who had become dangerously super-powered.






 Superman Accidentally Unleashes His Power (But He Can Stop It) 
          

Superman has tons of hidden things inside his Fortress of Solitude that he&#39;s collected over the years, including the last bit of technology that exists from Krypton. It&#39;s not surprising that Superman would have the technology to remove his own powers. Clark has always desired to truly be a part of humanity, and not having super strength might come in handy sometimes. That&#39;s why it isn&#39;t Batman or even Lex Luthor who has the best way to defeat Superman — it&#39;s actually Superman himself.
