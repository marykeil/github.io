  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>What If? series in the 80s introduced groundbreaking and bizarre alternate fates for Marvel heroes, some of which were folded into the main canon.
Notable What If? stories include Doctor Doom focusing on Mephisto instead of becoming a villain, Spider-Man saving Gwen Stacy but facing dire consequences, and Captain America sacrificing himself as President.
Other stories explored outcomes like the Phoenix obliterating Earth, a compressed Clone Saga for Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four without powers, and Conan becoming a gang leader in New York.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are a plethora of What If? stories published by Marvel, and those in the early &rsquo;80s were some of the most memorable. Here are 10 of the best!</p>
<p>Marvel Comics’ What If? series has been a mainstay for the publisher for decades, with a timeless premise that’s still captivating fans to this day. What if things in Marvel canon were just a little different? That’s the question each issue asks, and sometimes even the most seemingly innocuous change yields drastic consequences for the wider Marvel Universe.
The What If? series launched in the late ‘70s, but it arguably wouldn’t hit its stride until the ‘80s, with the early ‘80s kicking off an era of truly groundbreaking and bizarre alternate fates for a number of fan-favorite heroes. Not only that, but a few What If? ideas were way ahead of their time, as those storylines were effectively folded into the main Marvel Comics canon. While this particular era of What If? can be charted through issues #20-#47, there were some obvious standouts. Here are the 10 best Marvel What If? stories from the early ‘80s!
: Top 10 Marvel Comics What If Stories, According to Ranker</p>
<p>10  Doctor Doom Never Becomes The Fantastic Four’s Greatest Foe
What If? #22 - “What If Doctor Doom Had Become A Hero?” by Don Glut and Fred Kida</p>
<p>The title of this issue is a bit of a misnomer, as Victor Von Doom doesn’t necessarily become a hero, he just doesn’t become a villain, and instead decides to focus his brilliance on one evil entity: Mephisto. The event in his original origin story that turned Victor into Doctor Doom was the failure of his college experiment to reach hell and save his mother from Mephisto. Doom blamed Reed Richards, and vowed to destroy him and his family.
In this issue, Doom accepts Reed’s help on his machine in college, and he gets it to work! He speaks to his mother, and vows to destroy Mephisto to save her. Plus, since the machine didn’t explode, there was no need to cover his face and body in armor, allowing Doom to retain his humanity.</p>
<p>9  If Spider-Man Saved Gwen Stacy, It Would Be His Life That Ended
What If? #24 - “What If Spider-Man Had Rescued Gwen Stacy?” by Tony Isabella, Gil Kane, and Frank Giacoia</p>
<p>Every Spider-Man fan is aware of the heartbreaking moment when Spider-Man failed to save Gwen Stacy after Green Goblin threw her off the George Washington Bridge. They’re also aware that, immediately following Gwen’s death, the Green Goblin was also killed. However, this What If? saves the lives of both Gwen and Gobby, at the expense of Peter Parker’s. Since Gwen lived, Spider-Man didn’t pursue Osborn as ferociously as he originally did, so Green Goblin’s life was spared. However, that became a problem since Gobby knew Spider-Man’s secret identity, and he exposed it to the press.
When Peter saw that Gwen was alive, he asked her to marry him on the spot, and she said yes. But, after what Green Goblin leaked to the press, the police arrived to arrest Peter at his own wedding, forcing him to flee and become a fugitive. Gwen Stacy might have been saved, but Spider-Man’s life was effectively over.</p>
<p>8  Captain America Becoming President Was Literally The Death Of Him
What If? #26 - “What If Captain America Had Been Elected President?” by Mike W. Barr, Herb Trimpe, and Mike Esposito</p>
<p>Captain America was once asked if he’d consider running for President of the United States, and originally, he refused. However, this issue reimagines that scenario, and charts Captain America’s life if he had decided to run for President - and win. Unfortunately, Captain America never stopped being a superhero even after taking office, something that was exploited by the Red Skull, who was able to capture Cap and effectively hold the entirety of the United States hostage.
In the end, Captain America sacrifices himself to stop Red Skull and save the country to which he pledged his life and loyalty.</p>
<p>7  If Jean Grey Wasn’t Killed, The Phoenix Would Have Obliterated The Earth
What If? #27 - “What If Phoenix Had Not Died?” by Mary Jo Duffy and Jerry Bingham</p>
<p>The shocking death of Jean Grey/Phoenix has been burned into the minds of old-school X-Men fans since that groundbreaking issue. However, what happened if she had survived her fateful encounter with the Shi’ar Empire is far more tragic than the original fallout of her death. In this issue, it’s shown how Jean’s telepathic abilities - along with the Phoenix Force itself - were deliberately repressed within her mind by Shi’ar scientists. However, that didn’t hold the Phoenix for long, and she eventually took to the cosmos and consumed another life-giving star far off in space (which is why the Shi’ar called for her death in the first place).
When she was confronted by Kitty Pryde, Phoenix vaporized her in front of the X-Men. Each member then attacked Jean, and she killed them like they were nothing. Then, upon realizing what she’d done, Jean Grey exploded with power, and the Phoenix obliterated the entire Earth.</p>
<p>6  Spider-Man Experienced A Compressed ‘Clone Saga’ Long Before The ‘90s Storyline
What If? #30 - “What If Spider-Man’s Clone Had Survived?” by Bill Flanagan, Rich Buckler, Jim Mooney, and Pablo Marcos</p>
<p>While Ben Reilly and the Clone Saga have been ingrained in modern Spider-Man fans, the origin of that ‘90s storyline was actually decades before that, when the villainous Jackal created a clone of Spider-Man to take out the original. That storyline ended with Spider-Man disposing of his clone, and going back to being the one and only Spider-Man. While the Clone Saga would eventually reveal that the clone (Ben Reilly) survived that ordeal, this What If? storyline beat that infamous arc to the punch with a single-issue story that was essentially a compressed version of the entire Clone Saga.
In this comic, the original Peter Parker was knocked unconscious rather than the clone, and the clone Peter went off to live his life thinking that he was the original. However, he soon learned that he was the clone, but instead of disposing of the original (as Peter canonically did to him), the clone revived Peter. Then, they decided to be like brothers and take turns being Spider-Man, which isn’t unlike the introduction of Scarlet Spider.</p>
<p>5  Wolverine Would Have Suffered A Grisly Fate If He Killed The Hulk
What If? #31 - “What If Wolverine Had Killed The Hulk?” by Rich Margopoulos and Bob Budiansky</p>
<p>Wolverine made his Marvel Comics debut in a Hulk comic, as he was originally hired to kill the Jade Giant on behalf of the Canadian government. While originally the two teamed up to stop the Wendigo, this storyline shows what would have happened if Wolverine succeeded in slaying the Hulk - and that triumphant kill was perhaps the least interesting thing about it. After Wolverine killed the Hulk, the whole world took notice, including and especially Magneto. The Master of Magnetism discovered it was Wolverine who did the deed, and he hired him to do another: infiltrate the X-Men.
Wolverine was accepted onto the X-Men, disabled the security system, and allowed Magneto and his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants to enter. However, Wolverine had become a part of the X-Men family, and fought back against Magneto. While Wolverine managed to land a killing blow, Magneto used his dying breath to turn Wolverine’s own claws against him, forcing Logan to stab himself in the head, killing him moments later.</p>
<p>4  The Fantastic Four Are Just As Fantastic Without Their Powers
What If? #36 - “What If The Fantastic Four Had Not Gained Their Super-Powers?” by John Byrne</p>
<p>Originally, the Fantastic Four decided to blast off into space even when conditions weren’t safe because they were concerned about funding, something which clouded Reed’s mind enough for him to make a mistake that would mutate himself and his family. However, in this retelling, Reed takes a step back and decides to wait to do the space flight. A few weeks later, the team launches safely, and they complete their mission without incident. This not only prevents them from getting superpowers, but also sets the stage for a new technological era for the entire planet. However, just because the Fantastic Four didn’t get powers, doesn’t mean their villains ceased to exist.
Mole Man still attacked just as he did in Fantastic Four #1, though the Fantastic Four still defeated him all the same. In the end, it was revealed that the FF don’t need their powers to be fantastic, as their brilliant teamwork was enough to save the day.</p>
<p>3  If They Mutated Further, The Thing Would Be Healed &amp; Beast Would Be Doomed
What If? #37 - “What If The Beast And The Thing Continued To Mutate?” by Tom DeFalco, Arvell Jones, Sam DeLaRosa, and Alan Weiss</p>
<p>When the Thing was exposed to MODOK’s ‘Virus X’ in the original continuity, the Fantastic Four were able to cure the illness before it really took effect. However, in this reimagining, they aren’t able to come up with a cure so quickly. This means that the virus continued to mutate the Thing’s cosmically-irradiated cells, turning him into a clumpy, grotesque form of his former self. Once he has finished mutating, it’s revealed that Virus X actually healed the Thing, and he reverted to his human self.
Beast, however, was not so lucky. If his mutation continued along the trajectory shown in the original continuity, then his body wasn’t the only thing that became beast-like, but also his mind. Beast attacked his fellow X-Men, and in the end, the only thing to do with him was to exile Beast to the Savage Land, where he’d live out the rest of his days truly living up to his namesake.</p>
<p>2  Conan Battles The Avengers In Modern Day Rather Than Joining Them
What If? #43 - “What If Conan The Barbarian Were Stranded In The 20th Century?” by Peter B. Gillis and Bob Hall</p>
<p>While today’s fans are familiar with Conan being stuck in the modern day from the Savage Avengers comics, this What If? came up with that concept way earlier, and with a vastly different outcome. Rather than aligning himself with modern day superheroes/antiheroes, Conan the Barbarian simply takes to the streets of New York and does what he’s best at: being a thief. Conan finds that modern day cities aren’t too dissimilar to what he’s used to, and after he learns the language, he thrives just as well as he would in any other city of the Hyborian Age.
Canon eventually starts his own street gang called the Barbarians, becoming a ‘Warriors-esque’ gang leader that rules a good portion of New York City’s criminal underbelly. Before long, his path crosses with the Avengers - specifically Captain America - and they fight for their respective causes rather than coming together and fighting a greater evil - like in Savage Avengers.</p>
<p>1  Uncle Ben Would Have Been A Hindrance To Spider-Man’s Heroism
What If? #46 - “What If Spider-Man’s Uncle Ben Had Lived?” by Peter B. Gillis and Ron Frenz</p>
<p>The death of Uncle Ben is easily one of the most iconic and well-known moments in comic book history, as it set Peter Parker on the course to becoming the spectacular superhero Spider-Man. However, this What If? issue shows what would have happened if Uncle Ben hadn’t been killed by the criminal Spider-Man let get away, but if Aunt May had been the one to die instead. Peter still became Spider-Man, and his life was more or less the same. That is, until Uncle Ben found out that Peter was Spider-Man. At that point, Ben made a deal with Peter’s boss, J. Jonah Jameson, where he told Jonah Peter’s secret in exchange for a money deal. Spider-Man would provide the Daily Bugle with exclusive news and Jameson would share the wealth more generously with Peter and Ben.
Uncle Ben’s contribution to Peter’s (and Spider-Man’s) life wasn’t the most morally sound, even if it was lucrative. In the end, this What If? proved that Uncle Ben was a better help to Spider-Man as a memory of a morally righteous man, rather than the reality of someone who would sacrifice his own nephew’s morals just for cash. Shocking revelations like this are why these What If? stories are the 10 best in Marvel Comics from the early ‘80s.</p>
