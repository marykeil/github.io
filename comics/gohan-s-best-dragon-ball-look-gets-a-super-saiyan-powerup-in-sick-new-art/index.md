## Literature Review

Gohan has a lot of different looks in Dragon Ball lore, with the unique Kai costume he gets from Kibito getting a Super Saiyan upgrade in new fanart!




In the anime and manga world of Dragon Ball, the powerful Z-Warrior known as Gohan has worn a few different looks over the years, with his Supreme Kai clothing donned during the epic events of the Majin Buu Saga being one of his best. And now, in a new fanart image of the character, Gohan does the one thing he never needed to do while wearing these unique threads: ascend to the Super Saiyan level.




Recently shared on social media via X, username @DBSKAKERU1 is a talented and prolific creator who specializes in making fanart that features Dragon Ball’s most iconic characters, with their artwork rivaling the professional illustrations drawn by series creator Akira Toriyama and Dragon Ball Super’s current artist, Toyotaro.


 

Mentioned in their bio that drawing Dragon Ball fanart is their “hobby,” @DBSKAKERU1 consistently impresses with unique pieces that show off their impeccable illustrative skills, with their art of Trunks as King of the Saiyans, Chi-Chi returning to her fighting roots, and Gohan going Super Saiyan 2 only a select few of the stand-out projects @DBSKAKERU1 has uploaded to their page as of late.

                  Dragon Ball&#39;s Gohan Gets a Crossover With The Strongest Pokemon In New Fanart   Dragon Ball&#39;s Gohan and Pokemon&#39;s Mewtwo have never officially met, but in a new fanart piece they finally share space with a special Digimon guest!   





 Gohan Goes Super Saiyan While Wearing His Supreme Kai Clothing In New Fanart 
          

A set of clothes given to him by Kibito after Gohan travels to the Sacred World of the Kais to train with the fabled Z-Sword, this wardrobe change was short-lived, as it wasn’t long before Kibito transported Gohan back to Earth to take on Super Buu, this time around giving him a much more standard Z-Fighter look. Not needing to transform into a Super Saiyan during this time because, after getting his potential power unlocked by Old Kai, Gohan’s ascended form was an entirely unnecessary drain on his stamina and body, this is still a look that Gohan wore well, making this design that much more special for fans of the character.

Drawn kneeling close to the edge of a cliff, @DBSKAKERU1 illustrates Gohan with a determined look as he scans the horizon and uses the Z-Sword to prop himself up. Dressed in the signature layered clothing and pointed shoulder pads of a Supreme Kai — and colored with a slightly muted set of blue, teal, and orange hues — @DBSKAKERU1 gives fans something they can appreciate by depicting Gohan already powered up to the Super Saiyan level. Looking incredibly badass while wearing this outfit, this piece shows that if Gohan had chosen to use the Super Saiyan transformation while wearing this costume, he’d have set the standard as having one of the coolest character designs in the Dragon Ball Universe, period.






 Dragon Ball Fanart Shows What Super Saiyan Gohan Would Look Like Using The Z-Sword 
          

This redesigned version of Gohan’s Supreme Kai look is one that will never be seen in Dragon Ball lore, as not only did Gohan retire these duds shortly after receiving them, but since he already had full access to his Super Saiyan strength while wearing them, there was no real reason for him to use his golden-haired form in the field of battle. Regardless, this fanart’s out-of-continuity take on Gohan is a unique way to bring something new to the Dragon Ball community, so fans should throw a follow on @DBSKAKERU1’s page to experience more great original content from this iconic franchise!
