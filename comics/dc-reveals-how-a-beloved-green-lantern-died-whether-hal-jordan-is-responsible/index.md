## Literature Review

After months of speculation, the events behind Kilowogâ€™s death are revealed and shed light on how culpable Green Lantern Hal Jordan really is.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #7!After months of teasing, the circumstances behind Green Lantern Kilowog&#39;s death have been revealed and finally determines Hal Jordan&#39;s culpability. After the stunning revelation that Kilowog was dead, Hal claimed responsibility for his longtime friend&#39;s death. But what happened on Korugar and is the Emerald Knight actually responsible for killing Kilowog?




In Green Lantern #7 by Jeremy Adams and Amancay Nahuelpan, Hal tells his old ally Razer what happened to their mutual friend Kilowog. Several months ago, the Green Lantern Corps was taken over by the United Planets. Earth&#39;s Lanterns were reassigned, including Hal and Kilowog, who escorted the United Planets&#39; leader Lord Premier Thaaros to broker a treaty with the Sinestro Corps.

          

Unfortunately, the treaty was a trap and several Sinestro Corps members attacked Kilowog after Hal was dismissed for his unruly behavior. During the battle, Kilowog dies when the Yellow Central Power Battery explodes. Though Jordan had nothing to do with Kilowog&#39;s death, he still feels he should have been there to help him.

Things haven&#39;t been easy for Green Lantern ever since he officially left the Corps. He went back home and tried to pick up where he left off, only to discover how much of the world had moved on. To make matters worse, his greatest nemesis Sinestro was also on Earth and still furious about what happened on Korugar. Sinestro discovered he could tap into the Red Light of Rage and attempted to destroy the Earth, but thankfully Hal managed to stop him. However, the past came for Hal again when Razer made his way to Earth, leading Hal to reveal that their friend Kilowog was dead.

Green Lantern caused a lot of speculation when he said he was responsible for Kilowog&#39;s death. Though it seemed highly dubious that Hal would actually do anything to cause the death of a close friend, it&#39;s now confirmed he&#39;s innocent. If anyone&#39;s responsible for Kilowog&#39;s death, it&#39;s the trio of Sinestro Corps members that attacked Kilowog (though whoever caused the Yellow Central Power Battery to explode is the real guilty party). Hal&#39;s admission in the previous issue comes from the Lantern blaming himself for not being there for Kilowog in his final moments. While there&#39;s nothing Jordan could have done, will the hero be able to forgive himself?






 Green Lantern is Dealing With Heavy Survivor&#39;s Guilt 
          

Green Lantern has seen a lot of death in his day and it never gets easier, especially when the Corps&#39; latest hero to fall in battle is one of Hal&#39;s closest allies. Jordan likely knows that it wasn&#39;t his fault that Kilowog died, but survivor&#39;s guilt isn&#39;t always easy to overcome. Green Lantern has spent much of his time since the event on Korugar running, but now that he&#39;s finally confronting it, maybe he will be inspired to track down the truth behind what caused the Yellow Central Power Battery to explode. It can give Green Lantern the closure he needs and get justice for his friend.

Green Lantern #7 is on sale now from DC Comics.
