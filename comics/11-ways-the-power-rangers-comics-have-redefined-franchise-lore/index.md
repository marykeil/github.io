## Literature Review

BOOM! Studios continues to build upon the history of the Power Rangers franchise by expanding to its vast lore in new and exciting ways.




BOOM! Studios has helped redefine the Power Rangers franchise through its comic book series. Beginning in 2016, the comic book publisher debuted a modern retelling of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. That would soon evolve into additional series including Go Go Power Rangers, Mighty Morphin, Power Rangers, and several one-shots. Rather than rebooting the franchise completely, or remaking it, Boom!&#39;s creative teams continue to find fresh ways to recontextualize the Ranger&#39;s world and its characters.
In doing so, Boom!&#39;s Mighty Morphin&#39; Power Rangers ongoing comic series has been able to build the franchise&#39;s ever-growing mythology, adding new context to old stories while also pushing familiar, beloved characters in unexpected directions. Expanding on what began as a children&#39;s series, a live-action cartoon of sorts, Boom! Studios has consistently opted to tell more mature stories – meaning the franchise continues to grow alongside its original fanbase – while developing a complex, richly textured narrative world for these stories to play out in. Below are 11 ways Power Rangers lore has evolved in the Boom! Studios comic book era.









 








 11  Power Rangers Comics Introduced The Multiverse 
The Shattered Grid Storyline Combined Every TV Team


 







The release of the prolific Shattered Grid event coincided with the 25th anniversary of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. As such, as often has been the case throughout the franchise, this milestone opened the door for another Ranger team-up. By introducing the multiverse into the franchise, it helped BOOM! Studios deliver the biggest Ranger team-up ever. On top of that, it allowed BOOM! to continue using the multiverse in additional storylines. Even today, the multiverse continues to be a focal point of the Rangerverse as Dark Specter travels through space and time to either destroy Rangers or convert them into his zombie army.





 10  Power Rangers Comics Revealed What The Morphin Grid Looks Like 
The Emissaries Three &amp; The Morphin Masters


 







The Rangers franchise has frequently spoken of the Morphin&#39; Grid and how it connects the Rangers to their powers, but never actually showed it directly. That changed thanks to the comics, which have also established recently that the Morphin&#39; Grid appears differently to everyone who enters it. Along with elaborating on the mechanics of the Morphin&#39; Grid, Boom! Studios has given more detail on the elusive Morphin&#39; Masters than ever before, including introducing a rogue, evil Morphin&#39; Master named Praetor in Beyond the Grid. BOOM! also introduced the Emissaries Three, God-tier beings responsible for protecting the Morphin&#39; Grid, bringing in a new cosmological element to the Power Rangers Universe.





 9  Power Rangers Comics Revealed There Were Rangers Before MMPR 
Zordon Chose His First Rangers in 1969
        

Early in the series, the Rangers deal with an unlikely, but efficient Big Bad in the form of Finster and were approached for help by Grace Sterling, the head of Promethea. This tech company specialized in space travel and otherworldly occurrences. It is also worth noting that Promethea&#39;s home base would later become Terra Venture in Lost Galaxy Rangers. Sterling was especially interested in the Rangers due to her connection to Zordon. The Green Psycho Ranger tried to free Rita Repulsa from her moon prison and Zordon called on five teenagers with attitude in the late 1960s. They defeated Psycho Green, but not without three casualties, before Zordon took the surviving pair&#39;s Morphers away.





 8  Tommy Oliver Wasn&#39;t Rita Repulsa&#39;s First Choice 
Zack Was Almost The Original Green Ranger
        

The BOOM! Studio series has offered fans secret moments they never knew about. In Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #5, readers were privy a flashback, in which Rita Repulsa attempted to manipulate one of the Rangers, after Jason got the glory for a mission that Zack did the heavy lifting for. Sensing jealousy, she kidnapped the Black Ranger, seeking to convince him they could create a better world together if he joined her side. She used her crystal ball to show Zack her vision, and in Rita&#39;s glimpse at a different world, he&#39;s the Green Ranger. Zack declined the offer, however, which compelled Rita to start scouting a new student named Tommy Oliver instead.





 7  What Happened To Trini, Zack, &amp; Jason After Leaving the Team 
They Became The Omega Rangers
        

The original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team was changed forever in the midst of the 1990s series, when Zack, Trini, and Jason left for the &#34;Peace Conference&#34;. As it turns out, the Peace Conference was merely a cover-up, as the trio opted not to tell their teammates the truth. The truth was that they were recruited by the Blue Morphin&#39; Emissary of the Emissaries Three to build a new superhero team that specialized in space missions. From the moment they left the team, they left the planet Earth and ventured into outer space as the Omega Rangers – radically altering long-time fans understanding of these classic characters.





 6  Power Rangers Comics Made The Sword of Light Relevant 
A Forgotten, Underused Artifact Became Critical
        

The Sword of Light was introduced in the television series as an essential means of transferring Rangers powers from one wielder to another. On TV, this was quickly forgotten about ,and unused by the time Kimberly needs to transfer her abilities to Kat. This was long considered a plot hole, but became a focal point in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink. Because the Sword of Light wasn&#39;t used to transfer her powers, it was revealed Kimberly remained connected to the Morphin Grid. As a result, not only could she still become a Ranger after leaving the team, but Kimberly became the Shazam of the Power Rangers by sharing her powers with others using the sword.





 5  Power Ranger Communicators Can Do More Than Teleport 
They Project Holograms Too
        

In the TV show, communicators were used to teleport from one place to another and, of course, communicate with Rangers further away. Much like how the Sword of Light proved more useful than the show led on, the communicators also received an upgrade in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Pink. When Goldar captured the Rangers and the Sword of Light, the imprisoned Rangers used their communicators to project an image of the full Power Rangers team in front of their cages. It was convincing enough to fool Goldar&#39;s henchmen, who charged at the cages hard enough for the real Rangers to break out.





 4  Revealed The Fate Of Alpha 5 After Turbo/In Space 
A Beloved Original Character&#39;s Tragic Ending
        

At the beginning of Power Rangers Turbo&#39;s season, Zordon and Alpha 5 left Earth for a mission on Zordon&#39;s home planet, Eltar. In the finale, Eltar was invaded by Divatox, delivering Zordon into Dark Specter&#39;s hands for the following In Space season. However, the fate of the show&#39;s original Alpha-bot was never revealed until the 30th Anniversary Special comic. As Eltar was being invaded, Zordon urged Alpha to flee, but convinced that his purpose is to ensure that his friend was never alone, Alpha stayed. The comic ended there, with the likelihood that Alpha died amid Eltar&#39;s destruction, explaining why audiences have never encountered him in the franchise again.





 3  Power Rangers Comics Revealed What Happened To Zordon&#39;s Body 
Separated From His Conscious, On The Planet Bizerk
        

Power Rangers lore long-established that Zordon was confined to a tube thousands of years ago, because during his original war with Rita Repulsa over control the galaxy, her final scheme saw her use a spell to trap him inside of a time warp. Those wondering whatever happened to Zordon&#39;s body were eventually given an answer in BOOM! Studios Power Rangers comics. Rita explained that while she trapped his consciousness inside a time warp, she separated it from his body. Someone she described as an &#34;old friend&#34; collected the body, along with the Dragon Coin, and sent it to another planet.





 2  Zordon And Zedd&#39;s Secret History Revealed 
They Were Both Eltarian Warriors, And Former Friends


 







Between 2021 and 2022 – when the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series was split into two separate series Power Rangers and Mighty Morphin – BOOM! Studios delivered the Eltarian War arc. This storyline gave the origin story of Zordon and his upbringing on Eltar as a warrior; it also established that Lord Zedd was originally an Eltarian himself. Before his turn to villainy, Zedd was a mentor and friend to Zordon. A flashback shows that Zedd&#39;s skin was ripped away as he tried to steal the Zeo Crystal. With this reveal, Boom! transformed the antagonist from a scary villain to a complex three-dimensional character with a major connection to the Rangers&#39; leader.





 1  Origins For Rita Repulsa &amp; Her Crew 
Revealed Her Backstory &amp; Why She Recruited Her Minions
        

Rita Repulsa was often portrayed on TV as a one-dimensional, maniacal eccentric, but the comics rebuilt her as something more. The comics showcased her origin story as a child of Master Vile and the more gentle-hearted Lady Fienna. Rita was quickly ripped away from her mother to solely be raised by her father, who put her on a path to villainy. In time, she slowly built her forces. She traveled the galaxy specifically to find &#34;strays,&#34; who were essentially outcasts in need of &#34;a guiding touch ... or a stern hand&#34; and, thus, were easy to manipulate. That&#39;s how she recruited Goldar, Babboo, Squatt, and Finster to fight the Power Rangers.
