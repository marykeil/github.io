 The Perry Bible Fellowship Creator Releases Comedy Story About Generational Trauma 


          




The Perry Bible Fellowship was created by Nicholas Gurewitch in 2001 for Syracuse University&#39;s newspaper The Daily Orange. Gurewitch&#39;s webcomic made a name for itself with its charming, innocent art style that often heavily juxtaposed the strip&#39;s dark or surreal punchlines. No topic is too off-color for The Perry Bible Fellowship, which has made jokes about sex, murder, war and other sensitive subjects. Gurewitch&#39;s series has been lauded by many critics over the years, many of whom praise its twisted sense of humor and its delightful art style. Dark Horse Comics has released several collected editions of The Perry Bible Fellowship, some of which have had multiple printings.

Though Gurewitch only provides a glimpse of his story in his Instagram post, fans of The Perry Bible Fellowship can immediately recognize his signature style and comedic sensibilities. Much like Gurewitch&#39;s webcomic, Trauma Trooper captivates readers with Gurewitch&#39;s eye-pleasing art and hits them hard with unexpected twists. Also like The Perry Bible Fellowship, Gurewitch goes to an uncomfortable place to tell his story, in this case, the cycle of trauma people are born into that they wind up continuing. That sort of topic can be hard to write about, much less make funny. But if anyone has the chops for it, it&#39;s the mind behind The Perry Bible Fellowship.






 Trauma Trooper Builds on The Perry Bible Fellowship&#39;s Style 


          

While dark humor isn&#39;t for everyone and some may not find stories of generational abuse funny, Gurewitch doesn&#39;t appear to be making light of the issue. Like he did with his webomic, Gurewitch is using his talents to find the humor in the situation, not make fun of the concept. By the looks of Trauma Trooper&#39;s preview, Gurewitch seems to have discovered a hilarious, if not morbid way of exploring generational trauma that also informs his audience. Fans who wish to procure a copy of Trauma Trooper can buy it now at The Perry Bible Fellowship&#39;s shop.
