Summary

  Superman and Lex Luthor switch roles and team up to battle the Lex Luthor Revenge Squad.   Lex has been providing advice to Superman, but now he will be out on the field making decisions.   The role reversal may lead to a better understanding and perspective between Superman and Lex Luthor.  







Superman and Lex Luthor have been bitter rivals for decades, but the two have recently started coming to some kind of understanding — and it seems that&#39;s going to be explored even more when Superman and Lex switch roles. While Superman has recently been put in the role of Lex Luthor, it seems Lex will be put in the role of Superman soon.

The solicitation for the upcoming Superman #12 by Joshua Williamson and David Baldeon promises to put Lex Luthor in the role of Superman by stating &#34;Superman is the brains while Lex is the brawn, as they team up to battle the Lex Luthor Revenge Squad for the fate of Metropolis.&#34; 

 SUPERMAN #12 (2023)                 Release Date:  March 19th, 2024    Writers:  Joshua Williamson    Artists:  David Baldeon    Cover Artist:  Jamal Campbell    Variant Covers:  Lee Bermejo, Clayton Henry, Dan Jurgen, Norm Rapmund, Alan Quah   Superman is the brains while Lex is the brawn, as they team up to battle the Lex Luthor Revenge Squad for the fate of Metropolis. Lex has sworn to Superman that he is a changed man, but to what lengths will he go to stop his enemies?! And what danger from deep space rapidly makes its way toward Earth?   






Recently, Lex has essentially been the &#34;guy in the chair&#34; for Superman and has helped provide intel and advice as Superman fights crime. While Superman hasn&#39;t accepted most of this advice, it seems the roles are going to be reversed. Lex is now going to be the man out on the field, having to decide if he listens to Superman&#39;s strategic advice or not.

                  Superman&#39;s Exotic Energy Gun Is the Ultimate Anti-Justice League Weapon   On a good day, Superman could probably solo the Justice League, though his anti-Justice League ray gun means he can beat them whenever he wants.    


 Superman and Lex Luthor Have Officially Switched Places 
         

Superman and Lex Luthor have been wokring against each other for decades due to a fundamental difference in how they view the world. Superman believes that the world can be saved if everyone simply works together and that everyone can be a hero. Lex believes that humanity needs to suffer to evolve and that, without facing adversity, they&#39;ll never actually be able to protect or save themselves. Lex views Superman&#39;s presence as an active detriment to humanity, since if Superman keeps solving every problem, humanity will never learn for themselves. This has caused Lex to try and get rid of Superman in the past, but now it seems that Lex is truly turning over a new leaf.




Recently, Superman has become a better Lex Luthor due to several factors. With Lex in prison, Lex transferred his entire company over to Superman, renaming it into SuperCorp. In addition to this, Superman has begun wearing a suit of armor after suffering Kryptonite poisoning. This armor is a literal repaint of Lex&#39;s iconic power armor. For the past several months, Superman has been using more and more of Lex&#39;s gadgets and intel, something even other characters have noticed. Now the solicitation for Superman #12 shows that Lex will take on the role of Superman — at least in terms of Clark&#39;s &#34;brawn.&#34; Likely due to the Kryptonite poisoning, Superman may have to sit on the sidelines while Lex tries to save the city.



 Superman Will Have to Allow Lex Luthor to Save Metropolis 
          

These two characters have been iconic rivals for decades, but recently they&#39;ve been forced into swapping roles, which is likely going to go a long way to finally making them see eye to eye. Lex Luthor is used to being the genius who stays in the shadows, manipulating his city from afar and scheming new ideas to take down Superman. Superman is used to being in the spotlight, saving everyone he can, and inspiring hope. Now Lex Luthor and Superman are truly going to have to see things from each other&#39;s perspectives.




Superman #12 is available March 19th from DC Comics!
