## Literature Review

Green Arrow has countless iconic trick arrows to get the job done. No matter what he&#39;s up against, he&#39;ll always have an arrow ready for action.




Despite his baffling range of trick arrows, Green Arrow may seem like a hero who isn&#39;t very intimidating. After all, he&#39;s just a man with a bow and arrow. But being underestimated is what has allowed Oliver Queen to become so dangerous, since his arrows pack a lot more punch than villains tend to expect.
Instead of constantly firing the same old regular arrow at his opponents, Green Arrow has a plethora of fancy trick arrows that he can use. Between the classic Boxing Glove Arrow and the more rare Kryptonite Arrow, Oliver Queen has a truly creative range of weapons at his disposal. When he shares these arrows with the rest of the Green Arrow Family, there&#39;s very little these non-powered heroes can&#39;t accomplish. Green Arrow and his allies have used a number of trick arrows over the years, and each is more memorable than the last.
            
 
 Superman&#39;s Biggest Hero Threat Isn&#39;t Batman, It&#39;s Green Arrow 
Fans have debated for years whether Batman could beat Superman or not, but it turns out Superman&#39;s biggest threat is actually Green Arrow.












 








 10  Flashbang Arrow 
Green Arrow/Black Canary #28 by Andrew Kreisberg and Mike Norton
        

Sometimes Green Arrow just needs to make a quick escape or give himself some breathing room. When that time comes, nothing is better than a Flashbang Arrow. All Green Arrow has to do is take aim and fire, and everyone will be unable to hear or see for a few minutes afterward. This Arrow is so useful that Oliver has consistently used it in almost every form of media he&#39;s been in, whether it&#39;s TV or comics. This trick arrow is an inspired staple in Green Arrow&#39;s quiver.





 9  Microphone Arrow 
World&#39;s Finest Comics #56 by George Papp
        

One of the major things that vigilantes have to do is gather information, both to know where crimes are going to happen and to also know if they&#39;re actually beating up the right people. This is why Oliver Queen came up with the perfect arrow to make sure he&#39;s always in the know. Originally called the &#34;Listening-In-Arrow,&#34; this trick gadget would later go on to be called the Microphone Arrow after its debut in 1952. By simply aiming and shooting it, Green Arrow can hear anything said in the general vicinity of the arrow.





 8  Foam Arrow 
Justice League United #0 by Jeff Lemire and Mike McKone
        

One of the key elements of Green Arrow&#39;s trick arrows is versatility. While being able to fire an arrow at someone and defeating them with it is certainly useful, it&#39;s even more useful if that same arrow can be used to save someone&#39;s life. This is best shown with Green Arrow&#39;s iconic Foam Arrow. This Foam Arrow can be used to either incapacitate enemies or be used as a safety cushion, preventing runaway cars from smashing into anything or providing someone with a safe landing as they fall.





 7  Boxing Glove Arrow 
Adventure Comics #118 by Ed Herron and George Papp


 







While it&#39;s not always the most useful or the best arrow in Green Arrow&#39;s arsenal, there&#39;s no denying just how iconic the Boxing Glove arrow is. Any fan of the character knows it and can name at least one instance when it&#39;s been used. Even in recent comics, the Boxing Glove Arrow has gotten an upgrade that keeps it relevant regardless of what kind of enemy Oliver is fighting. As Oliver once explained, he created this arrow simply because sometimes he wants to punch someone who is really far away. In reality, this arrow was created to give Oliver a direct method of attack without being lethal. This absolutely legendary arrow first appeared in 1947.
Check out the return of the Boxing Glove Arrow in DC&#39;s recent Green Arrow title by Joshua Williamson and Sean Izaakse. 






 6  EMP Arrow 
Green Arrow #22 by Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino
        

In the world of comic books, it&#39;s not unusual to come up against things like robots, cyborgs, or people wearing high-tech battle armor. In such situations, there isn&#39;t much a man with a bow and arrow can really do. That is, unless that man has an EMP Arrow. The EMP Arrow is one of the stronger arrows in Oliver&#39;s arsenal. He can use it to immediately shut down or even outright destroy any technology in a specific radius. This arrow is absolutely invaluable in a world where rogue cyborgs aren&#39;t that uncommon.





 5  Handcuff Arrow 
World&#39;s Finest Comics #79 by George Kashdan and George Papp
        

One of the major things that non-powered vigilantes have to deal with is chasing down criminals. In this situation, Green Arrow handles crime better than Batman, while Batman has to chase down his criminals and put them in handcuffs before calling the police, Green Arrow has devised an arrow to handle this. Instead of having to chase his criminals down, Green Arrow can simply fire his classic handcuff arrow. This is an arrow shaft with handcuffs at the end. It can either get people by the wrists, by the ankles, or even cuff people to objects, like a nearby streetlamp.





 4  Sleeping Gas Arrow 
Adventure Comics #132 by George Papp
        

Green Arrow will often find himself outnumbered, either due to a riot or just numerous criminals in a single place. When this happens, the best option is to simply use Green Arrow&#39;s Sleeping Gas Arrow. All he has to do is either fire it at the ground or at the crowd and within three seconds flat they&#39;ll be unconscious. One of Green Arrow&#39;s favored tricks is to fire the arrow at someone he knows will catch it, just so the gas will release in their face and knock them out. Though this arrow debuted in the Golden Age, it&#39;s still frequently used to this day.





 3  Kryptonite Arrow 
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #4 by Frank Miller and Klaus Janson
        

Batman has used Kryptonite in tons of different ways over the years, but he&#39;s never really had a ranged option for Kryptonite. This was changed in the iconic story The Dark Knight Returns. In this story, Batman goes up against a fascist Superman who serves the government. Batman plans to lure Superman into a trap wherein Green Arrow will use a kryptonite arrow to bring down the Man of Steel. This plan works pretty much perfectly, and it was the first instance of Oliver Queen intentionally using a Kryptonite Arrow. Even non-powered characters like Green Arrow have a chance to take down a Kryptonian.





 2  Atom Arrow 
The Brave and the Bold #130 by Bob Haney and Jim Aparo
        

Fans love nothing more than a superhero team-up, especially in order to see how the two characters&#39; powers and personalities interact. This is shown off when Green Arrow invents the &#34;Atom Arrow&#34;, an idea so good that Marvel would later take it for themselves, years later, with the &#34;Ant-Man Arrow.&#34; The basis of this arrow is that someone, usually Ray Palmer, will shrink down to miniature size and ride one of Oliver&#39;s arrows to the target, allowing Ray to get a very quick and surprising drop on them. This shows that even the most basic of Green Arrow&#39;s arrows can be legendary with the right inspiration.





 1  Phantom Zone Arrow 
Teen Titans #32 by Geoff Johns and Todd Nauck


 







The Phantom Zone Arrow is, without a doubt, one of the most dangerous trick arrows ever made. This arrow was actually created by Superman, for unknown reasons, and was eventually stolen by Roy Harper, Green Arrow&#39;s frequent ally. Roy would later pass the arrow onto Mia Dearden, the new Speedy, who then used it against Superboy-Prime. While Oliver himself never used the arrow, it&#39;s still a trick arrow, and it&#39;s completely possible that it&#39;s still in his arsenal. This arrow would instantly banish anyone into the Phantom Zone, making it one of the most dangerous trick arrows in Green Arrow&#39;s long history.
