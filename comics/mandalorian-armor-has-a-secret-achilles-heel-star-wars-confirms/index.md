# Mandalorian Armor Has a Secret Achilles Heel, Star Wars Confirms


## SUMMARY 



  Mandalorian beskar armor, while incredibly tough, has a major vulnerability - a gap between the helmet and the breastplate, which a skilled sniper like Aurra Sing can exploit (as shown in Star Wars: Revelations.)   The need for maneuverability means not every part of the body can be protected by beskar, making the gaps in the armor a significant weakness.   However, Aurra Sing is a galaxy-class sniper, and this weakness can only be exploited by the best of the best.

## Literature Review

Beskar armor may be incredibly resistant to harm - even fending off lightsaber blows - but Star Wars confirms it still has one major vulnerability.




Warning: contains spoilers for Star Wars: Revelations #1!Star Wars&#39; Mandalorians are known for their incredibly tough beskar armor, which is even strong enough to stop lightsabers. However, while the Mandalorian steel is coveted across the galaxy, the armor they fashion from it has a major vulnerability, which Star Wars just took pains to point out.




In Star Wars: Revelations #1&#39;s &#39;Stolen Hope&#39; - from Ethan Sacks, Will Sliney, Nolan Woodard, and Travis Lanham - Jango Fett journeys to Nar Shaddaa. Attacked by a K&#39;lor&#39;slug - part of a planned real life holochess board for Jabba the Hutt - Jango nevertheless triumphs, as his armor protects him from the beast&#39;s constricting limbs and club-like tail. Only a little worse for wear, Jango continues his hunt for the Hope of Glee Anselm - a valuable statue that&#39;s become a major prize for the galaxy&#39;s thieves and bounty hunters. Little does the Mandalorian realize he&#39;s in the sights of another deadly predator.

          

As Jango Fett disembarks, he finds himself in the crosshairs of the bounty hunter and assassin Aurra Sing. An expert sniper, Sing confirms that despite Fett&#39;s beskar armor, she has a kill shot, saying:





At this range, I can hit the gap between the helmet and the breastplate.

Typically found only on Mandalorian worlds, beskar is used in the culture&#39;s ceremonial armor, which marks out many of the galaxy&#39;s most skillful and resilient warriors. Pure beskar can repel many of the most powerful forces in the galaxy, from direct blaster fire and lightsaber blows to rancor bites. However, despite its strength, the armor doesn&#39;t offer total immunity to harm. Repeated damage can wear down and eventually break beskar, and beskar weapons are incredibly effective against it. There is also the risk of concussion, which can make even non-piercing blows fatal.

However, Star Wars: Revelations #1 goes beyond these mild limitations, confirming that a skilled enough sniper can take down Mandalorians by targeting the gaps in their beskar armor. These gaps are essential for mobility, making this a significant Achilles Heel of the otherwise highly prized armor. The one proviso is that Aurra Sing is a galaxy-class sniper whose skills are augmented by Force sensitivity, suggesting that this vulnerability may only be exploitable by the very best of the best.

Mandalorians are known for their incredibly tough armor, which at various points in Star Wars canon has survived almost impossible hardships - however, the need for maneuverability means that not every part of the body can be protected by beskar, and in the face of Aurra Sing&#39;s pinpoint accuracy, that&#39;s a major weakness.
