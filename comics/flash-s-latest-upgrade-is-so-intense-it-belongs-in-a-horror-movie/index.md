## Literature Review

As “Beast World” intensifies, the Flash Family faces an old enemy with a terrifying new upgrade and has no choice but to take on disturbing new forms.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City #1!The Flash and his closest associates have just gained one of their most terrifying upgrades ever. All across the DC Universe, chaos reigns as people are turning into animal-human hybrids. But rather than run from this madness, the Fastest Man Alive and his loved ones are embracing their wild side to put an end to &#34;Beast World&#34;.




In Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City #1 by Si Spurrier and Scott Koblish, the Flash&#39;s nemesis Godspeed has returned and he&#39;s been changed by Beast Boy&#39;s spores. Now that Godspeed is a giant wasp, Barry Allen uses a Cosmic Treadmill to call out to the Flash Family for assistance.

          

Despite the greater numbers, Flash and his allies struggle against the evil speedster. However, at Irey and Jai&#39;s suggestion, the Flash Family willingly give up to the spores and are reshaped by Animal Girl into a swarm of bees. The Flash swarm envelops Godspeed and successfully removes the spore, ending the speedster&#39;s reign of terror.


 The Flash Family Has Become a Family of Insects 


          




Beast Boy has been mind-wiped and is now nothing more than Garro, an alien invader like Starro the Conqueror. It was bad enough for the DC Universe that a beloved Titan had lost his mind, but making matters worse was the spores he began sending out. All across the globe, innocent people were infected by the spores and transformed into half-human/half-animal monsters. To make matters worse, the spores intentionally seek out more powerful hosts, infecting people like Black Adam and Power Girl. Superman is also a prime target for the spores, forcing him to constantly stay in motion.

So far, every hero that&#39;s gone up against the animal-human hybrids has tried fighting them on their terms. The Flash Family is the first set of heroes that have tried to fight fire with fire and allowed the spores to transform them. The only reason they even considered this option was because they had no way of keeping up with Godspeed&#39;s new form. Plus, they had Maxine Baker who could not only make sure they transformed into bees but kept them from losing control by placing Barry Allen&#39;s fiance Iris West in charge of the swarm. It&#39;s a risky gambit to sacrifice their humanity, but maybe it&#39;s what&#39;s needed to give DC&#39;s heroes a win.






 The New Flash Family Can Save the Day in &#34;Beast World&#34; 
          

The Titans are in a precarious situation right now. They need to handle powerful, infected people like Black Adam, which requires their strongest heroes to do so. But the Titans risk heroes like Starfire or Donna Troy becoming infected themselves. It&#39;s too dangerous to send them into a fight that could get them corrupted, but for the Flash Family, it&#39;s not an issue. They&#39;ve already got spores inside them and it&#39;s not like they can get infected twice. By sending the team of bees to handle other hybrids, the Titans can focus on other important things, like stopping Garro. The Flash and his family&#39;s new bodies may be disturbing, but it might resolve this worldwide calamity.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Central City #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
