## Literature Review

The Predator has entered Marvel with Predator vs Wolverine, and now that it&#39;s there, who else will it hunt? Here&#39;s the 10 aliens who should be scared.




The Predator has crossed over into the Marvel Comics universe during the epic event Predator vs Wolverine by Benjamin Percy, Greg Land, Ken Lashley, and Andrea Di Vito. While this storyline is effectively closed off from the wider Marvel Universe, the fact that it exists at all means there’s no reason to assume that Wolverine will be the last Marvel character a Predator will hunt, as there’s a whole universe filled with potential prey.
Within the Predator’s own continuity, it’s been very well established that the Yautja don’t just hunt on Earth, but actually travel from planet to planet, seeking the deadliest prey across the cosmos. So, now that they’ve found their way into the Marvel Universe with this Predator vs Wolverine crossover, the Predators are free to do the exact same thing in an entirely new reality. Here are the 10 alien species that should be terrified that the Predator has joined the Marvel Universe.
            
 
 10 Marvel Heroes the Predator Should Fight Next (After Taking On Wolverine) 
The Predator is familiar with fighting Wolverine, but afterward, which Marvel Comics hero is next for the cosmic hunters? Here&#39;s the 10 best choices! 












 








 10  The Shi’ar Empire’s Imperial Guard Would Get The Predators’ Attention Immediately 
Shi’ar Imperial Guard First Appearance: X-Men #107 by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum


 







The Imperial Guard is a group of superpowered members of the Shi’ar Empire charged with protecting their ruler. Shortly after their first appearance, the Imperial Guard challenged the X-Men to capture and ultimately destroy Jean Grey aka the Phoenix - and the Shi’ar made the X-Men look weak by comparison. If the Predator is impressed by Wolverine - a prominent member of the X-Men - then the Yautja would be absolutely blown away by the Imperial Guard.
The Imperial Guard represent the best of the best when it comes to the Shi’ar race, meaning they are who the Predator would want to hunt. And even with their immense strength and vast power, the Imperial Guard should be scared if these ruthless killers decide to come after them (Predators have faced the likes of Superman in the past, after all, so warriors like Gladiator shouldn’t be too much of a challenge).





 9  The Kree Empire Is A Known Powerhouse, &amp; The Predators Would Investigate 
Kree Empire First Appearance: Fantastic Four #65 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby
        

The Kree Empire made its first appearance taking down the Fantastic Four, and showing Marvel’s First Family who the real powerhouse in the galaxy truly is - which is something the Predator would absolutely take note of. Not only do the Kree have elite squadrons similar to the Shi’ar’s Imperial Guard, but some members of the Kree race have inherent abilities that make them superhumans (kind of like Earth’s mutants), meaning even a ‘regular’ Kree should be able to give any given Predator a worthy challenge.
The beauty of these galactic empires, too, is their prevalence in the cosmos, meaning the Predator would hear about them immediately, and would have no trouble scouting out the perfect hunting trip.





 8  The Skrulls Are Arguably The Perfect Prey For Predators 
Skrulls’ Most Impactful Storyline: Secret Invasion by Brian Michael Bendis and Leinil Yu
        

While the exhilaration of battling superhumans would be satiated between the Shi’ar’s Imperial Guard and select Kree warriors (not to mention mutants like Wolverine on Earth), the Skrulls might actually be the Predators’ perfect prey due to the ability they’re famous for: shapeshifting. Predators aren’t just deadly combatants hungry for a brutal battle, they’re also hunters in the truest sense of the word, which includes tracking and stalking. Indeed, the Predators’ most useful weapon - the cloaking device - was specifically created for the purpose of tracking their prey. And in that regard, there’s no better challenge than a Skrull.
Trying to kill a Skrull would be the purest example of a Predator’s thrill of the hunt, as the final kill likely wouldn’t be drawn out in battle, but would instead be well-earned through relentless tracking and truly unadulterated hunting practices.





 7  The Chitauri Are Savage Warriors - Excellent Challenge For A Predator 
Chitauri First Appearance: Ultimates #8 by Mark Miller and Bryan Hitch
        

The Chitauri were originally the Ultimate Universe’s version of Skrulls, which means they’d present the same level of threat (and thrill) for a Predator to hunt. However, the version of the Chitauri in Earth-616 would be equally thrilling for a Predator, though for a completely different reason. In Earth-616, the Chitauri are much more in-line with their depiction in the MCU, as beast-like creatures with advanced technology and a singular, savage goal of utterly decimating the planets they invade.
Earth-616’s Chitauri would be a fun hunt for a team of Predators testing their mettle. The Yautja would most likely be able to take them out fairly easily given their higher level of intelligence, better combat tactics, and more advanced tech, but they still might get overtaken by the Chitauri’s sheer numbers and ruthlessness in battle, making the Chitauri an exciting (and brutal) undertaking.





 6  The Kronans’ Rock-Hard Stone Skin Alone Would Make Them Attractive Prey 
Kronans’ First Appearance: Journey Into Mystery #83 by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby
        

Predators are always on the lookout for prey that are not only the deadliest, but also the hardest to kill, as that’s an opportunity for the Predators to test their weaponry and make adjustments/upgrade when necessary - and the Kronans would be the perfect prey in that regard. Kronans are essentially ‘rock-people’ who are notably stronger than an average human, though for the most part, aren’t too dissimilar to humans at all. In the Predator’s eyes, a Kronan would basically amount to a human with super strength and nearly unbreakable skin, making them ideal targets.
It’s well known that Predators love hunting humans, so there’s no way they’d pass up a chance to push the limits of their tech and skill sets a bit further by hunting Kronans.





 5  The Klyntar Pose A Unique Challenge For The Predators 
Klyntar Species’ Most Impactful Storyline: King In Black by Donny Cates and Ryan Stegman


 







The Klyntar species (or symbiotes as they’re more commonly known) are unlike anything the Predator has hunted before in the past, in any universe. As shown in the King In Black, Klyntar are capable of claiming entire planets, possessing cosmic gods (ie, Celestials), and acting autonomously, without the need of a host. Klyntar are deadly on a cosmic scale, though while they may seem invincible, the symbiotes do have very clear weaknesses that don’t take long for an experienced hunter to figure out. In other words, the Predators would promptly find some to hunt upon their exploration of the Marvel Universe.
While the Klyntar would threaten to possess the Predators - something that would assuredly happen during a group hunt of these creatures - the Yautja would quickly learn that fire and sound are the symbiotes’ weakness, and would upgrade their weapons accordingly. This would be an exciting hunt unlike any other, and the Predators would have a very good chance of coming out on top, meaning the Klyntar should be afraid of their arrival.





 4  The Brood Would Make The Predators Feel Right At Home 
The Brood’s First Appearance: Uncanny X-Men #155 by Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum
        

It’s been said that the Brood is Marvel Comics’ answer to Alien’s Xenomorphs, as their bug-like appearance, extraterrestrial origin, and parasitic breeding process are all nearly identical to the classic horror movie monster. That means any Predator who seeks out the Brood will feel right at home hunting them, given the importance of hunting Xenomorphs in Predator culture as established in Dark Horse Comics’ Aliens vs Predator continuity.
It’s not a stretch to assume a team of Predators would deliberately infect a small society of hosts with the Brood for the sole purpose of hunting them, which is something the Yautja regularly do with Xenomorphs. Given the Predators’ proficiency at killing creatures just like them, the Brood should be very wary of the Yautja if their paths ever cross.





 3  A Makluan Is Worth Hunting For A Predator’s Trophy Alone 
Makluan First Appearance (Fin Fang Foom): Strange Tales #89 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby
        

The first member of the Makluan race Marvel Comics fans were introduced to was Fin Fang Foom, who was displaced on Earth and was single-handedly responsible for most of the lore surrounding dragons. Any warrior worth their salt has dreamed of hunting a dragon, and the Predators would be no exception.
While the hunt itself would be epic given the proven power-level of Fin Fang Foom, Predators care just as much about the trophies from their hunts as the hunts themselves (with Predator vs Wolverine actually being a prime example), and there are few trophies that would be as glorious or grand as the skull of a slain Makluan.





 2  The Sakaarans Live In A Gladiator Society - Perfect For A Predator 
Sakaarans’ First Appearance: Planet Hulk by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan
        

Sakaarans were shown in all their bloody glory battling the Hulk (and each other) during the Planet Hulk storyline, making them prime targets for a Predator hunt. However, a storyline where Predators are hunting Sakaarans could quickly become something much more than an average ‘Predator Vs’ comic. The gladiator-like race of warriors could actually battle a Predator - stripped of its tech, of course - in the ring for the crowd’s entertainment, the same way the Hulk was made a gladiator during Planet Hulk.
A Predator/alien-gladiator story would be a really cool read, and would assuredly put on full display exactly why Yautja are feared across the cosmos - and why the Sakaarans should fear them as well.





 1  Xandar’s Nova Corp Would Wage War On The Predators 
Xandar’s First Appearance: Nova #1 by Marv Wolfman and John Buscema


 







The Nova Corp of Xandar are essentially a team of space cops who seek out galactic threats and eliminate them for the betterment of the entire galaxy. If the Predators crossed over into the Marvel Universe in any meaningful way - beyond just picking a fight with Wolverine - then the Nova Corp would assuredly be all over them. The Nova Corp would wage war against the Predators, making this particular ‘hunt’ one of epic proportions, as it would inevitably include a space battle, planet-hopping escapades, and galactic detective work on both sides.
In the end, the Nova Corp would learn the terrifying truth of how truly deadly Predators are, making the Xandarians just one of the 10 alien species that would be terrified that the Predator has joined the Marvel Comics universe.
