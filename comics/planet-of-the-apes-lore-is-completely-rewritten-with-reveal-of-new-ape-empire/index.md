## Literature Review

Everything fans thought they knew about the Planet of the Apes will change when a new ape empire is discovered. 




Planet of the Apes lore is completely rewritten with the introduction of a new ape empire. This year, the license to produce Planet of the Apes comics returned to Marvel, and the publisher hit the ground running with a new line of comics expanding and building upon the mythos. This January, Beware the Planet of the Apes launches and in issue three, the apes discover they are not alone.




Marvel unveiled a look at Taurin Clarke’s cover for Beware the Planet of the Apes #3, which will be written by Marc Guggenheim and drawn by Alvaro Lopez. The synopsis for the issue reads as follows:

          

Clarke’s cover, shared below, shows Cornelius, one of the good apes, being overwhelmed by another army of apes with glowing red eyes. Cornelius is helpless before the army, and is reaching out to the reader for help.

When asked for his thoughts on working on Planet of the Apes, Guggenheim called it one of the “OG franchises.” Guggenheim is not wrong: the Planet of the Apes franchise encompasses multiple film series as well as books, television shows and even comic books. Marvel published some of the first Planet of the Apes comics in the 1970s, and it is only fitting that the license would return there. Following the most recent films’ continuity, Marvel’s series fills in the gaps between the movies, showing exactly how human society collapsed, and the apes became dominant.





 

However, Beware the Planet of the Apes will be set in the continuity established by the original series of films, and will star some of the biggest characters from those movies, including the apes Cornelius, Zira and Zaius, as well as the human Nova. Beware of the Planet of the Apes will lean into the dense and strange mythology of the first film series, including the Forbidden Zone, just beyond the ape’s city. Cornelius, Zira and the rest believe themselves the only society on the planet, but Beware will change all of that, introducing a new city somewhere beyond the Zone.

 How Will This New Ape Empire Affect the Franchise? 
          




The introduction of another ape society upends just about everything fans thought they knew. Marvel did not reveal any information on the new apes, but Taurin Clarke’s cover shows an invading army with menacing red eyes. Whether this is an effect or something more has not been revealed, but it makes for a cool visual nonetheless. Marvel’s synopsis for Beware the Planet of the Apes #3 does mention that a war may be coming with the new apes, meaning they may not be friendly at all. Whatever their intention, the new ape city changes everything fans thought they knew about Planet of the Apes.
