# Batman Has Lost Faith in Nightwing, as the Titans Fail Like Never Before


## SUMMARY 



  Batman may no longer trust Nightwing to lead the DC Universe, putting Nightwing&#39;s future in jeopardy.   The Beast World event has thrown the world into chaos, causing Batman to question Nightwing&#39;s ability to handle the new role.   If Nightwing fails to regain Batman&#39;s trust, Batman might want to reclaim his position as the leader of the DC Universe.

## Literature Review

After gifting Nightwing with the keys to the DC kingdom following the dissolution of the Justice League, Batman may be ready to take them back. 




Warning: Contains a preview for Titans: Beast World #2!This year, Batman primed his former ward, Nightwing, to be the face of the DC Universe, but now he&#39;s already starting to reconsider. DC&#39;s Dark Crisis event ended with Batman proclaiming to Nightwing that he has to lead the DC Universe into the future as its center. Batman later reiterates that same sentiment, even asking Nightwing to lead the Justice League.




Now Batman may be regretting his vote of confidence as of Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, Brad Anderson, and Wes Abbott. Reis, Miki, and Anderson&#39;s cover art can be viewed below, alongside a preview of the panels to come for the issue. Titans: Beast World #2 is scheduled to officially release on December 12.

         

The preview features a subtle exchange between Batman and Nightwing that seems to suggest that Batman may not trust Nightwing to get the job done like he did earlier this year. If that truly is the case, then it&#39;s surely going to put Nightwing&#39;s future - as well as the state of this new Dawn of DC era - in jeopardy.


 Batman Doesn&#39;t Trust Nightwing Anymore 
          




DC&#39;s latest Beast World event first kicks off in the previous issue, where an escapade in space puts the Titans into conflict with Brother Eternity. He unleashes Necrostar, a 30-million-year-old creature that killed half a planet&#39;s worth of Starfire&#39;s Tamaranean ancestors. Upon learning it was only ever defeated by Starro, Beast Boy is compelled to transform into Garro, which works until Doctor Hate appears and shatters Beast Boy&#39;s mind. From there, Beast Boy&#39;s fractured mind causes chaos across the planet by using its spores to turn people into animalistic creatures.

Beast World #2 shows off the immediate aftermath. While the Justice League and the Titans head to space to try to neutralize Garro, Batman and Nightwing take the streets to save the citizens in disarray. In a quick moment, one of the citizens who Nightwing saves urges him to let him down so that he can save his son, who is still trapped in a car. Batman says he&#39;ll get him, despite Nightwing&#39;s attempt to let Batman know he can get him instead, which goes completely ignored.






 Nightwing&#39;s Future as DC&#39;s Leader is in Jeopardy 
          

Dark Crisis marked DC&#39;s passing of the torch to Nightwing and the Titans as the new leaders of the DC Universe. The Justice League and Batman especially had no problems passing that torch and, in multiple instances during Dark Crisis and afterwards in stories like Nightwing #100, they express their trust in the Titans to carry that torch. Beast World is the Titans&#39; first major event in their new roles and, so far, it thrusts the world into chaos. Given Batman&#39;s reaction where he basically brushes off Dick&#39;s attempts to help, he may have lost faith that a future for the DC Universe with Nightwing at the helm is salvageable. If Nightwing doesn&#39;t find a way to regain his trust, Batman might be anxious to take his torch back.



Titans: Beast World #2 goes on sale from DC Comics on December 12.
