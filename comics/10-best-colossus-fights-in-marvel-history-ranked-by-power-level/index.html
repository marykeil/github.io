  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Colossus is one of the strongest members of the X-Men – which means that for better or worse, he has gone up against some of the strongest characters, heroes and villains alike, the Marvel Universe has to offer.   This list ranks 10 of Colossus&rsquo; best fights according to the power level of his opponent.   In many cases, Piotr Rasputin has proven himself one of the most formidable fighters in the Marvel Universe, but at times, he has been on the losing end of severe beatings.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Colossus has had a many iconic fights across Marvel history, but these are the most definitive ranking according to the power levels of his opponents.</p>
<p>One of the strongest members of the X-Men is Piotr Rasputin, Colossus. The character has long been used as the X-Men&rsquo;s go-to fighter and, in many cases, their secret weapon to unleash during battles. Over the years, he has had some of Marvel&rsquo;s most iconic physical confrontations, squaring off against many of the company&rsquo;s other most powerful fighters.</p>
<p>Being one of the X-Men&rsquo;s brute strength enforcers has led Colossus into some unforgettable brawls with some vicious opponents. The list below is concerned with more than just Colossus&rsquo; best fights – it seeks to analyze his &ldquo;best&rdquo; performances in the context of the strength of the opponents he faced. Below are the character&rsquo;s most memorable confrontations, with each opponent ranked by their power level, from weakest to strongest. This list serves to illustrate just how many all-time powerful foes Colossus has faced off with over the years – and more importantly, strives to provide insight into why Piotr Rasputin is one of Marvel&rsquo;s greats.</p>
<pre><code>              10 Things Only Comic Book Fans Know About The X-Men's Colossus   Despite his inclusion in the movies, Colossus remains unknown by mainstream audiences, but comic book fans know him as one of the best X-Men of all   
</code></pre>
<p>Colossus vs. Ord
Astonishing X-Men #5</p>
<p>Years before the events of Astonishing X-Men, Colossus sacrificed his life to cure the Legacy Virus. The X-Men subsequently cremated Colossus and sent his ashes to Russia – but as Astonishing would later retcon, this wasn&rsquo;t Colossus&rsquo; real body. The actual corpse was in the possession of an alien named Ord, who sought to retrieve the cure for the Legacy Virus from Piotr&rsquo;s system. He revived Colossus, then proceeded to torture and experiment on him. When Colossus was finally freed, a beating was surely overdue. Ord proved to be no match for Piotr, who was only stopped from killing the enemy by an intervening Nick Fury.</p>
<p>Astonishing X-Men #5 was written by Joss Whedon, and penciled by John Cassaday. It was released in 2004.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Marauders
Uncanny X-Men #211</p>
<p>A great example of Colossus showcaseing his full strength without holding back came when he faced off with the Marauders. This occured during the :Fall of the Mutants&quot; storyline, after the Marauders killed innocent Morlocks – in what became known as the first Mutant Massacre –</p>
<p>and severely injured Colossus&rsquo; teammates, Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler. Colossus had enough of the Marauders and was ready to take them down with no regard for his morals, such as his usual no-kill rule. His unrelenting rage turned him into a one-man wrecking machine, most notable in the horrifying moment when he choked the villain Riptide to death.</p>
<p>Uncanny X-Men #211 – by Chris Claremont, John Romita Jr, and Bret Blevins – was released in 1986.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Red Hulk
Uncanny X-Men #11</p>
<p>This heavyweight bout took place both during the &ldquo;Avengers vs. X-Men&rdquo; arc, during a time when Colossus was made the new Juggernaut by the god Cyttorak. Once Cyclops delivered the first blow to Captain America, an all-out battle commences between the Avengers and the X-Men. Colossus and the Red Hulk were gunning for each other almost immediately. Their showdown took on a new dimension when Colossus unleashed his underrated shapeshifting powers, distorting his body into a whole new form, but even that proves fruitless as the former General Thaddeus &ldquo;Thunderbolt&rdquo; Ross ultimately dispatched the mutant with an absolutely brutal uppercut.</p>
<p>2012&rsquo;s Uncanny X-Men #11 was written by Kieron Gillen, and drawn by Greg Land.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Juggernaut
Uncanny X-Men #183</p>
<p>Colossus has had many battles with the Juggernaut, but by far their most memorable and iconic came during Uncanny X-Men #183. Following Colossus&rsquo; break-up with Kitty Pryde, Wolverine brought the metal-skinned mutant to a bar – ostensibly to help him get over the end of his relationship, though really Logan intended to beat Piotr up for breaking Kitty&rsquo;s heart. This plan changed when Colossus accidentally spilled his drink in Juggernaut&rsquo;s direction, and a building-shattering brawl ensued. Colossus didn&rsquo;t even recognize Juggernaut in his civilian clothes at first, but that didn&rsquo;t stop Cain Marko from dropping everything but the kitchen sink on him.</p>
<p>1984&rsquo;s Uncanny X-Men #183 was written by Chris Claremont, with art by John Romita Jr.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Juggernaut (as Juggernaut)
Uncanny X-Men #542-543</p>
<p>Besides their bar brawl, another memorable encounter between Cain Marko and Piotr Rasputin came during the era when Colossus had adopted the mantle of Juggernaut. In the process, he was confronted by and defeated the original. Understandably, Colossus taking Juggernaut&rsquo;s powers for himself gave the Russian a much-needed power upgrade, which would come in handy in their rematch, which occured in Uncanny X-Men #542-543. Cain Marko still made a formidable opponent, leading Colossus to realize that, &ldquo;he is more powerful than me in all ways but one. He cannot stop me.&rdquo; Charging at Cain at 600 MPH subsequently allowed the new Juggernaut to take down the original.</p>
<p>Uncanny X-Men #542-543 by Kieron Gillen, Greg Land, and Jay Leisten was published in 2011.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Gladiator
Phoenix: The Untold Story #1</p>
<p>Shi&rsquo;Ar warrior Gladiator has a reputation for being one of the strongest characters in the entirety of the Marvel Universe. His fight with Colossus opened with him delivering a punch so forceful that it compelled Piotr to say, &ldquo;What a blow! I doubt even Juggernaut ever hit me that hard!&rdquo; Nonetheless, the fight persisted to the point that the narration called their battle &ldquo;brutal - a clash of modern titans. Two men of steel - one an irresistible force, the other an immovable object - battling without letup, giving everything they have.&rdquo; The fight was decided not by either fighter, but by the surrounding old ruins crumbling on top of them, ending the battle in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Phoenix: The Untold Story #1 is written by Chris Claremont and John Byrne, featuring art from Byrne. It was published in 1984.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Mikhail
X-Force #46</p>
<p>Mikhail Rasputin has been confirmed to be a much more powerful version of his brother, as well as someone who has perfected his powers in ways that Piotr still has yet to evolve into. This was made evident during their long-awaited final fight, a conflict that has been several years in the making, ever since Mikhail first started controlling Colossus&rsquo; mind. As Colossus finally started to break free, that&rsquo;s when Mikhail struck. Although Piotr was resistant to fight his own brother, being a few notches above Colossus&rsquo; power level seemingly made it easier for Mikhail to have his way with his younger brother – until Piotr ripped his heart out.</p>
<p>2023&rsquo;s X-Force #46 was writren Benjamin Percy, with art by Robert Gill.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Wolverine
Wolverine #4</p>
<p>Wolverine&rsquo;s virtual immortality – thanks to his famous healing factor – and his incredible feats of strength, makes him one of the most powerful X-Men on the roster. Colossus&rsquo; power level may not be able to compare, but defensively, Colossus may be the most durable member of the X-Men. This was highlighted when Wolverine was possessed by a demon, and wound up in a fight with Colossus. With enough time, Wolverine can pierce Colossus with his claws, but as Wolverine #4 depicted, it takes a great deal of effort for even adamantium-laced blades to get through Piotr&rsquo;s metallic skin, to the flesh underneath.</p>
<p>Wolverine #4 was written by Jason Aaron, with art by Renato Guedes and Jae Lee. It was published in 2010.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Thor
Cable And X-Force #10</p>
<p>Thor is among the most powerful on this list, and no one has humiliated Colossus in a fight quite like the Mighty One. When Cable assembled a new X-Force, including Colossus, in order to disrupt visions of a horrible future, their attempts to avoid this dark future put them in present conflict with the Uncanny Avengers. When a battle commenced, Thor absolutely brutalized Colossus. Despite not getting any offense on Thor at all, Colossus urged Thor to not gloat until their battle was over. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start now,&rdquo; Thor said, launching Colossus into the distance with a final blow using Mjolnir.</p>
<p>Cable and X-Force #10 – by Dennis Hopeless and Salvador Larroca – was released in 2013.</p>
<p>Colossus vs. Hulk
World War Hulk: X-Men #2</p>
<p>Much like his fellow Avenger before him, the Hulk asserted his core strength to Colossus by making short work of the mutant enforcer. Throughout the World War Hulk: X-Men series, Hulk constantly flung the Russian brute aside like he was nothing, causing serious injuries in the process, but they had a true one-on-one in the second issue. Hulk admitted that there was once a time when Colossus would have made a tough opponent for him, though he went on to say those times had changed. Hulk made that as clear as possible when he bent Colossus&rsquo; arms at the wrists, breaking them through his supposedly unbreakable skin.</p>
<p>World War Hulk: X-Men #2 was written by Christos Gage and drawn by Andrea Di Vito in 2007.</p>
