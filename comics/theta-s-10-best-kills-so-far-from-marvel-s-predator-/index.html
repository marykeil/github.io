Theta&rsquo;s origin story is unique and tragic, as her family was murdered by a Predator, driving her cosmic conflict with the universe&rsquo;s ultimate hunters.
Throughout the Predator comics, Theta has displayed incredible skills, including decapitating a Predator, keeping its armor, melting one with her spaceship, and avenging her family&rsquo;s deaths.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Theta is the ultimate protagonist in the Predator series, both in terms of her intriguing backstory and unparalleled kill-count. Here&rsquo;s the 10 best!</p>
<p>Throughout the entirety of the Predator franchise, Theta has proven herself to be the greatest Yautja-killer of all time. Within Marvel Comics’ ongoing Predator continuity, Theta has taken center stage as the series’ ultimate protagonist, as her Predator kill-count puts all others to shame. Not only that, but her origin is also incredibly unique and utterly tragic, as her family was murdered by a Predator, which is what drives her cosmic conflict with the universe’s ultimate hunters.
After two volumes detailing Theta’s personal war against the entire Predator species, Marvel Comics promises even more Predator chapters chronicling her action-packed adventures to come! But, before fans look too far ahead into Theta’s exciting future in Predator lore, it’s important to reflect on all the badass things she’s already done. Here are Theta’s 10 best kills from Marvel Comics’ Predator (so far).</p>
<p>10  Theta’s Opening Kill: Predator Decapitation
Predator Vol. 1 #1 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>In the opening pages of the first Predator issue under Marvel Comics, fans are thrown into an alien world where seemingly two Predators are fighting to the death, a fight that ends with one of them getting decapitated. The surviving ‘Predator’ then takes off her mask to reveal the face of a human woman - Theta - who releases a visceral scream filled with victory and rage. She killed the Predator she was fighting, but the Predator she was fighting wasn’t the one she wanted to kill.
This kill was not only insanely badass, and a great way to kick off a new Predator series, but it also set up the overarching storyline in a way that was as interesting as it was brutal.</p>
<p>9  Theta Kept The Armor Of 1 Of The Predators She Killed
Predator Vol. 1 #1 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>While this kill was off-panel (as she was shown with the resulting prize at the start of the first issue), Theta killed a Predator to gain its armor. This kill is perhaps the most significant of all the others, as it is a direct reminder that Theta was able to kill at least one Predator without utilizing their own tech against them.
While that may not seem too impressive, given that every other Predator-killer has done the same thing, Theta stands out because she takes the fight to the Predators rather than simply reacting to a Yautja assault - and she did so without armor on at least one occasion, in order to gain the armor she currently wears.</p>
<p>8  Theta Melted A Predator With Her Spaceship
Predator Vol. 1 #3 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>After Theta decapitated that first Predator, she immediately got to work trying to track down the next one. Unfortunately, that ‘next Predator’ had the same idea, and lured Theta into a trap. While the Predator initially had the jump on Theta - which actually resulted in Theta getting a foot blown off - Theta ended up with the upper hand, as she was able to scramble into her ship, turn its rocket propulsion towards the Predator, and melt the Yautja with a single blast.
This fight was one of the most nail-biting in the franchise, and only proved how skilled Theta is in battle, especially after suffering such a serious injury.</p>
<p>7  Theta Got An Unneeded Predator-Kill Assist From Another Enemy
Predator Vol. 1 #4 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>Right after Theta melted the Predator with her ship’s engine, another Yautja was right on top of her. Given her reputation, Theta earned the attention of more than one Predator at a time, as it seemed the Yautja species deemed her dangerous enough to send an entire team to go take her out rather than the usual solo-hunter. Unfortunately for the Predators, that still wasn’t enough. Even while recovering from her last fight, Theta was still able to beat a Predator one-on-one, effectively winning the match after slicing the Predator&rsquo;s neck with a hidden blade.
However, Theta received unneeded (and unwanted) assistance from a team of soldiers working for a company called Astar, as they blew the Predator to pieces with a barrage of bullets - at which point, she was taken into their custody.</p>
<p>6  Theta Finally Avenged Her Family’s Deaths By Killing The Target Predator
Predator Vol. 1 #6 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>Throughout the entire first volume of this Predator comic, Theta has been looking for one Predator in particular: the one who killed her family. That Yautja was missing a tusk, making it easily identifiable. That’s how Theta knew she hadn’t killed it yet, and why she was driven to keep fighting. And now, it was when she was at her most vulnerable that this Predator would finally seek her out to finish the job it started so many years ago.
When Theta was in Astar custody, the Predator boarded the ship she was being held on and slaughtered nearly everyone aboard. One Astar employee finally let Theta out of her cell after realizing what was happening, and then led her to her gear and weapons. Fully armed, Theta meets her ultimate enemy, and defeats them, thus completing a mission she had committed the majority of her life to.</p>
<p>5  Theta Blew The Head Off A Predator On Its Own Hunting Preserve Planet
Predator Vol. 2 #1 by Ed Brisson and Netho Diaz</p>
<p>While Theta did say at the end of Vol. 1 that she was still going to hunt Predators even after killing the one who slaughtered her family, the events of the next volume were still shocking, especially in the opening issue. A group of people abducted at different points in time and then kept in stasis until that moment were dropped on a Predator hunting preserve world not dissimilar to the one featured in 2010’s Predators. These people had no idea what was happening to them as a team of Predators picked them off one by one, and their attempts to fight back were laughable, to say the least.
That is, until one of the Predators who was terrorizing this unfortunate group of people had its head blown to bloody pieces, with Theta’s intimidating form towering over its mutilated corpse.</p>
<p>4  Theta Decapitated Then Displayed The Corpse Of A Predator As A Deterrent
Predator Vol. 2 #2 by Ed Brisson and Netho Diaz</p>
<p>Theta discovered this Predator hunting preserve while on her mission to ‘kill every last one of them’, and she decided she didn’t want to stop at just killing them. Though it wasn’t a part of her original plan, Theta saved these people’s lives along with killing the Predators that were hunting them. However, even Theta knew that blowing up Predator heads would only get them so far, as there were simply too many Yautja to kill practically by herself. So, she came up with a deterrent.
Theta killed another Predator, chopped off its head, and displayed its corpse for the other Yautja to find in a way that told them - in so many words - “come this way and die”. Of course, the Predators didn’t listen, but perhaps they were a bit more wary than they otherwise would have been.</p>
<p>3  Theta Weakened A Predator To The Point Of Death (&amp; Nearly Died In The Process)
Predator Vol. 2 #2-3 by Ed Brisson and Netho Diaz</p>
<p>One of the Predators Theta was trying to deter caught up with her and the people she saved before they were able to board her ship. This Predator was perhaps the most formidable Theta ever fought, as it chopped her arm clean off. Theta nearly died as a result, but she was in no way helpless.
Not only did Theta deliver some devastating blows herself before losing her arm, but she also distracted the Predator long enough for a horde of other deadly aliens to attack it, resulting in the Yautja&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>2  Theta Killed The Predator That Boarded Her Ship (Her Last Kill So Far)
Predator Vol. 2 #5 by Ed Brisson and Netho Diaz</p>
<p>After Theta got a robotic replacement limb for her missing arm, she and the people she saved had another problem on their hands: a pursuing Predator. This Predator followed them from the hunting preserve planet, and successfully boarded Theta’s ship. It slaughtered nearly everyone aboard, and almost killed Theta herself. But, with the assistance of those she saved (one of whom threw her a machine gun at the perfect time), Theta killed this Predator just like all the others before it.
This was Theta’s most recent Predator kill, but it certainly wasn’t her last - and farther from her first than many fans may know.</p>
<p>1  Theta Killed 23 Predators Over The Course Of 15 Years (Before The Series Even Started)
Predator Vol. 1 #3 by Ed Brisson and Kev Walker</p>
<p>Before killing the Predator who murdered her family - or even the Predator she decapitated in the first issue, for that matter - Theta went through a lot of Yautja in search of her ultimate prey. In fact, the precise number was revealed in the first volume’s third issue by the AI system in Theta’s ship: 23.
Over the course of 15 years, Theta killed 23 Predators, and she added to that already impressive number right before fans’ eyes in these two volumes alone. Among them were the 10 best kills Theta was able to pull off in Marvel Comics’ Predator - and she’s not done yet.</p>
