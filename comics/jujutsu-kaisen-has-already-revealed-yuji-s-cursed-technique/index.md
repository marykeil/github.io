## Literature Review

Jujutsu Kaisen may have already left all the clues to Yuji&#39;s true Cursed Technique and it may be completely different than fans expected.





Summary

  Yuji&#39;s true Cursed technique could be Blood Manipulation, learned from Choso and Noritoshi Kamo, as hinted in recent chapters.   Yuji&#39;s apparent ability to use Flowing Red Scale explains his improved performance against Sukuna and his connection to the Death Painting Wombs.   It is strongly implied that Kenjaku gave Yuji the Blood Manipulation Technique, making him one of his experiments like the Death Paintings.  







Jujutsu Kaisen may have already revealed Yuji&#39;s Cursed Technique, and it could finally settle a popular debate about his origins. While the common assumption thus far was that Yuji would eventually gain access to Sukuna&#39;s Cursed Technique, hints scattered throughout the latest chapters of Jujutsu Kaisen suggest Yuji may have a completely different Cursed Technique instead.

In chapter #247 of Jujutsu Kaisen, Sukuna was hit by what appears to be a Piercing Blood attack during the fight against Higuruma. The attack was launched &#34;off-screen&#34;, and while it initially appeared as though it may have been Choso who fired the attack from far away, some fans have speculated that it may be Yuji who used Blood Manipulation to attack Sukuna, having learned the technique from Choso and Noritoshi.

          




Choso, in fact, has not been involved in the battle against Sukuna, while Yuji is fighting the villain with Higuruma. The truth about Yuji&#39;s Cursed Technique would not only explain his mysteriously improved performance against Sukuna but may also be tied to his suspicious birth involving Kenjaku and his connection to the Death Painting Wombs.


 Yuji Learned His Cursed Technique From Choso and Noritoshi Kamo 
          

In chapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji oddly thanks his senpai Noritoshi Kamo for teaching him, going on to state that Choso wasn&#39;t very good at the same. While Yuji does not specify what exactly they taught him, seeing as Choso and Noritoshi are both two users of Blood Manipulation, it is strongly hinted that the two likely helped Yuji develop his Cursed Technique. Furthermore, the color spread for chapter #246 revealed that the still-mysterious coating on Yuji&#39;s arms is red, much like hardened blood, which strongly resembles Choso&#39;s Flowing Red Scale ability with which he covers his arms with hardened blood during his fight against Yuji in Shibuya.




          

Yuji&#39;s use of Flowing Red Scale, which improves the user&#39;s strength and speed, might also explain how he was able to land a solid hit on Sukuna in chapter #244, which even took Sukuna by surprise. More importantly, seeing as Blood Manipulation is an inherited technique, Yuji&#39;s ability to manifest the technique could explain his connection to the Death Painting Wombs and Kenjaku.



 Kenjaku Gave Yuji His Cursed Technique 
          

Although not stated explicitly, Jujutsu Kaisen has strongly implied that Yuji is connected to Kenjaku, and he may be very similar, if not one of the Death Paintings, much like Choso. Not only does Choso mysteriously feel the same connection to Yuji as he does with the rest of the Death Paintings, but Kenjaku has referred to Yuji as his son. A brief flashback teased that Kenjaku may have possessed Yuji&#39;s mother&#39;s body at the time of Yuji&#39;s birth. In the body of Noritoshi Kamo (an ancestor of Yuji&#39;s senpai from Jujutsu High with the same name), Kenjaku created the Death Paintings, who then inherited the Kamo family Blood Manipulation technique. It is then possible that Kenjaku passed on the Blood Manipulation Technique to Yuji, the newest of his experiments.




Kenjaku has been confirmed to be able to retain and use more than one Cursed Technique even after switching bodies, as he can still use Yuji&#39;s mother&#39;s technique, Antigravity System, while in Geto&#39;s body, as seen in chapter #208. Hence, it is possible Kenjaku still possessed Blood Manipulation while in Kaori Itadori&#39;s body since obtaining it from Noritoshi Kamo, his older host in the Meiji era. This would explain how Yuji and Choso would be able to manifest the technique, even though Blood Manipulation is only passed down exclusively among the Kamo clan.

          

Overall, Yuji&#39;s Cursed Technique has been a topic of extensive debate and discussion among fans of the series for quite a while. Despite being the so-called protagonist of Jujutsu Kaisen, Yuji has recently been relegated to the sidelines, leaving fans patiently anticipating his growth and his return to the spotlight. Fortunately, Yuji&#39;s latest power-up may be exactly what he needs to do just that.
