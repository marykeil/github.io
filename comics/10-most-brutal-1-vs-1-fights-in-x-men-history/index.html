  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The X-Men fight against super-villains in brutal combat, with intense one-on-one fights being arguably the most intense.
Wolverine&rsquo;s fights with Deadpool and Sabretooth are particularly gruesome and filled with relentless violence.
Magneto&rsquo;s fights, including his brutal killing of Tarn and ripping Apocalypse in half, showcase his ruthless power.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There is no shortage of epic fights in X-Men, and a great many of them are one-v-one. Here are the 10 best single combat battles in X-Men history!</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that a series centered around a mutant militant squad trained to fight world-class super-villains is going to have some brutal fight scenes, and X-Men certainly lives up to that expectation. In the first issue alone, the X-Men are fighting a villain who is attempting to commit an act of terrorism that would have resulted in horrific loss of life - and that set the stage for the rest of the series and its many spin-offs.
With every passing storyline, the X-Men must work together to battle the next ‘big-bad’, usually for the sake of the entire world. While the X-Men are famous for their teamwork skills, there are more than a few one-on-one fights littered throughout the many comic titles as well. And as it turns out, those instances of single combat are arguably the most intense, and a few standout fights prove it. Here are the 10 most brutal one-v-one fights in X-Men history!</p>
<p>10 Most Dangerous Creations From Wolverine&rsquo;s WEAPON PLUS Program
Aside from Wolverine, the Weapon Plus Program is responsible for making a number of increasingly deadly living weapons. Here are 10 of the deadliest!</p>
<p>10  X-Men &amp; Cyclops’ Moral Disagreement Turns Into Brutal Combat
X-Men: Schism #4 by Jason Aaron and Adam Kubert</p>
<p>Wolverine and Cyclops have become like brothers, and like all siblings, they fight from time to time. During one of their conflicts, the X-Men were under imminent attack from a giant Sentinel hellbent on their destruction, and Cyclops ordered every X-Man - including some who were young children - to stand their ground and fight. Wolverine vehemently objected to this plan, so he went over Cyclops’ head and evacuated the area, forcing the X-Men to retreat. Cyclops didn’t like that one bit, and promptly responded with a concussive optic blast to Wolverine’s face.
The fight that ensued afterCyclops’ initial attack was probably their most brutal, especially on Cyclops’ part, as he did everything short of blasting Wolverine’s head clean off in an effort to put his long-time friend and partner down.</p>
<p>9  When Deadpool Is Hired To Kill Wolverine, Their Most Epic Battle Ensues
Wolverine: Origins #22-23 by Daniel Way and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>Wolverine has fought Deadpool almost as many times as he’s fought Sabretooth, and those fights are just as bloody. However, none of them can top this one, as it spans two (arguably three) issues of non-stop action, with every attack being more brutal than the last.
From Wolverine getting a piano dropped on him at the start, to the battle ending with Wolverine&rsquo;s claws in Deadpool’s sides and a bullet in Logan’s skull, this fight is truly gruesome brutality at its finest.</p>
<p>8  Magneto Beats Quicksilver To Death, Sparking X-Men’s Most Infamous Moment
House of M #7 by Brian Michael Bendis and Olivier Coipel</p>
<p>When Magneto and the rest of the superpowered community discovered that it was Quicksilver manipulating Scarlet Witch into rewriting reality in the hopes of creating an ideal world for everyone, Magneto took it poorly, to say the least. It wasn’t what Quicksilver did, it’s that Pietro led the world to believe that this was something Magneto was responsible for. So, Magneto assaulted Quicksilver with a barrage of scrap metal, pummeling him so thoroughly that he is eventually killed.
It’s bad enough that Magneto killed someone who he believed was his son for a number of years in Marvel canon, but the fallout of that murder was arguably much worse. In response to seeing her brother killed, Scarlet Witch channeled her reality-altering powers and uttered the infamous words, “No more mutants”, all to spite the man who murdered her brother.</p>
<p>7  Wolverine’s First Fight with Sabretooth Is One of Their Most Brutal
Uncanny X-Men #212-213 by Chris Claremont and Alan Davis</p>
<p>While the full extent of their history would later be explored, Wolverine’s first fight on-panel with Sabretooth was during the Mutant Massacre event, where Sabretooth was little more than a goon working for Mr. Sinister and was tasked with slaughtering the X-Men - and Wolverine took it upon himself to stop him. Their fight started in the Morlock tunnels in Uncanny X-Men #212, but wouldn’t reach its climax until after Wolverine intercepted Sabretooth as he was attacking Psylocke at the X-Mansion in the next issue. The fight ends with both Wolverine and Sabretooth throwing themselves off a cliff and into the tumultuous sea below.
Though this fight wasn’t as graphic as some of their others (with the one from Wolverine #55 being perhaps the most graphic), that’s only because of the art style, as the story surrounding their fight - including the fight itself - was actually one of the most brutal in X-Men canon.</p>
<p>6  Colossus Releases His Inner Rage Like Never Before Fighting Ord
Astonishing X-Men #5 by Joss Whedon and John Cassaday</p>
<p>Ord of the Breakworld is an alien warrior with the ability to peak into the future due to his species’ technological advancements. Ord came to Earth after ‘seeing’ the destruction of his homeworld by the hand of a mutant, so he aligned himself with anti-mutant organizations to wipe them all out, just to be safe. Given his villainous mission, Ord was bound to come face-to-face with the X-Men, and as he would quickly learn, the one X-Man he did not want to run into the most was Colossus.
After the X-Men escaped the mutant-experimentation facility Ord trapped them in, Colossus went after him with an abundance of rage and fury. Indeed, this was perhaps the most rageful Colossus has ever been depicted aside from his time as the Juggernaut, and that fury was shown brilliantly in the physical violence he delivered upon Ord.</p>
<p>5  A Juggernaut-Powered Colossus Battles An Asgardian-Powered Juggernaut
Uncanny X-Men #543 by Kieron Gillen and Greg Land</p>
<p>During Marvel Comics’ Fear Itself event, Cain Marko comes across the Hammer of Kuurth, imbuing him with god-like power arguably stronger than that offered him by the Crimson Gem. Because of that, Marko actually gave up the power of the Juggernaut, allowing Colossus to claim it in his stead. This led to the inevitable conflict depicted in this issue of a Juggernaut-powered Colossus battling an Asgardian-powered Juggernaut, and it was just as brutal as it sounds.
The sheer strength of these two powerhouses exploded off the page, with every punch thrown by the Juggernauts seemingly sending ripples through the comic itself. In short, this fight was epic, and it ushered in an era of brutality for Colossus’ character.</p>
<p>4  Magneto Brutally Kills Tarn In Gladiator-Style Combat
X-Men Red #3 by Al Ewing and Stefano Caselli</p>
<p>Tarn the Uncaring is a hybrid of Okkaran mutants and daemons on Amenth, a product of the forced breeding program established by Annihilation. When Arakko was transported to Mars following the X of Swords event, Tarn wasted no time in establishing his physical superiority over all the other residents of the Red Planet. That is, until Magneto came to put him in his place.
Magneto challenged Tarn in gladiator-style combat, where he silently and quickly levitated his own helmet onto Tarn’s head - thereby neutralizing his psychokinetic powers - and crushed it using his magnetic abilities, killing Tarn instantly. It was a short fight, to be sure, but insanely brutal nonetheless.</p>
<p>3  Iceman Flexes His Omega-Level Power Fighting Nimrod
Hellfire Gala 2023 #1 by Gerry Duggan, Adam Kubert, Luciano Vecchio, Matteo Lolli, Russell Dauterman, Javier Pina, RB Silva, Joshua Cassara, Kris Anka, and Pepe Larraz</p>
<p>When Nimrod attacked the 2023 Hellfire Gala, he slaughtered some of the biggest heavy-hitters on the X-Men roster like it was nothing, including the entirety of the new X-Men lineup (even going so far as to cave in the Juggernaut’s skull). However, when Iceman challenged him to a one-on-one fight, Nimrod was stopped in his tracks.
Iceman used his Omega-level powers to their fullest extent in this battle, lashing out at Nimrod with everything he had. Unfortunately, the real brutality of this fight happened at Iceman’s expense, when Nimrod literally melted his body, ending the fight as gruesomely as it began.</p>
<p>2  Wolverine Makes Cyclops’ Brother, Havok, Suffer a Fate Worse Than Death
Weapon X #1 by Larry Hama, Adam Kubert, Karl Kesel, Dan Green, and Chris Warner</p>
<p>If fans thought Wolverine’s previously mentioned fight with Cyclops was bad, this one with Scott’s brother, Havok, is sure to shock. Within the Age of Apocalypse timeline, Havok - a minion of Apocalypse in this reality - challenges Wolverine as Weapon X tries to free humans and mutants imprisoned within Apocalypse’s citadel. While Havok put up a good fight, it was clear that he was no match for a savage Wolverine, who actually managed to defeat Havok by using his brains rather than just his brawn.
Wolverine had Sentinels at his disposal, and as Havok tried to escape by using a teleportation device, Weapon X shot the Sentinel’s hand at Havok, which hit the mutant villain right as the teleporter turned on. This entangled Havok’s DNA with the mechanics of the Sentinel hand, throwing him into a state of unfathomable agony - effectively making him suffer a fate worse than death.</p>
<p>1  Magneto Channels the Rage of An Entire Reality To Kill Apocalypse
X-Men: Omega - Age of Apocalypse by Scott Lobdell, Mark Waid, and Roger Cruz</p>
<p>The Age of Apocalypse is a storyline that proves En Sabah Nur is truly the greatest threat that faces mutant and humankind alike. Apocalypse decimated humanity only to imprison, selectively breed, and experiment on mutants in order to make them as strong as they could possibly be. That’s why Magneto formed the X-Men in this reality, and why he was the one who eventually killed Apocalypse. In the climactic issue of this iconic crossover event, Magneto launches an assault on Apocalypse’s citadel after building an Apocalypse-killing suit of armor, and he holds nothing back as he throws attack after attack at the X-Men villain.
In the end, Magneto rips Apocalypse in half - down the middle - and he does so with the collective rage of an entire reality behind him, making this fight one of the 10 most brutal one-v-ones in X-Men history.</p>
