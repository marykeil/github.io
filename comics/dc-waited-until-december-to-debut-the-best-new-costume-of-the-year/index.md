## Literature Review

Right before the year ended, DC Comics gave fans a look at one of its coolest designs for a superhero, but will fans ever see it again?




Spoilers ahead for Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22!It may have debuted in the 11th hour of 2023, but DC Comics just introduced one of the coolest, and most perplexing costumes it&#39;s featured all year. As Batman and Superman deal with the strange events on Kingdom Come&#39;s Earth, they come face-to-face with a hero who seems to be cribbing the style of a familiar wall-crawler.




In Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 by Mark Waid and Dan Mora, Gog and his disciple, Superman&#39;s former sidekick Thunderman, discuss the problem of the invading Prime Superman and Batman. However, Gog isn&#39;t worried as the duo is currently being taken in by every available hero on Earth-22.

          

Despite the overwhelming odds, Superman and Batman manage to hold off many of the Justice League variants. However, to Batman&#39;s surprise, this League also has original heroes in its ranks. The Dark Knight briefly encounters a very Spider-Man-like hero, albeit with a yellow-and-black color scheme with spikes adorning their outfit and a matching hooded vest.


 DC&#39;s New &#39;Spider-Man&#39; Has Its Coolest Costume 
          




Batman and Superman&#39;s journey to Earth-22 all got started back when Clark took on a powerful young man from another universe as his sidekick. David, or Boy Thunder as he was called, wanted to do good, but had several deep-seated anger issues which led to the hero acting out by harshly punishing criminals. It also didn&#39;t help that David went though a terrifying ordeal when he was kidnapped and tortured by the Joker, only fueling his desire to maim and even kill supervillains. Following the event, David was transported to Earth-22 where he grew to take on the name Thunderman, though David was ultimately destined to become the deadly new-wave hero Magog.

While the Prime DC Universe does have heroes that resemble Marvel&#39;s premier web-slinger (such as Sideways), this yellow-and-black clad hero isn&#39;t given a name nor are their powers explored. It can be assumed they may have spider-powers given their similarities to Spider-Man, but that&#39;s no guarantee. Regardless of what the hero&#39;s name or powers are, people can agree on one thing: Their costume is pretty badass. It&#39;s got all the sleekness and style of the original Spidey&#39;s outfit, but with a little bit more edge to it (fitting for a world as harsh as the one seen in Kingdom Come). Whoever this hero is, they need to be brought back immediately.






 Will Fans See DC&#39;s Spider-Man Again? 
          

It&#39;s hard to say if this unexpected hero will show up again. So far, they&#39;ve just appeared in group shots and only serve to highlight the wild differences between Earth-0 and Earth-22. But Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest&#39;s current arc has a few more issues left, so it&#39;s not outside the realm of possibility that they could come back. However, this hero is a side-character at best and may not get many more chances to shine. But whether they return or not, it&#39;s still awesome to see an awesome new costume like that in the DC Universe (even if it does borrow from Spider-Man&#39;s outfit).

Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 is on sale now from DC Comics.
