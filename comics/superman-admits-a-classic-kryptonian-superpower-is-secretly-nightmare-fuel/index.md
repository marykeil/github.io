## Literature Review

“Beast World” intensifies and the bodies are starting to pile up. But thanks to one Superman power, the situation becomes much worse for Jon Kent.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #4!One classic Superman power is far more horrifying than fans ever thought. The Earth is rapidly falling apart as the events of &#34;Beast World&#34; reach a boiling point. As destruction and death spread across the globe, one power makes the experience so much worse for the Man of Steel.




In Titans: Beast World #4 by Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer, Wonder Woman&#39;s nemesis Giganta steps up to protect Ivy Town from an invading swarm of Beast Boy spores. Unfortunately, she winds up getting infected by one and turns into a giant bear that starts wrecking the small town.

          

Superman Jon Kent arrives with the Titans to stop the transformed Giganta. Unfortunately, she&#39;s much stronger than they anticipate and knocks Jon clear into a building. As Jon emerges from the rubble, his enhanced vision and hearing make him see all the carnage and listen to the anguished cries of victims. It all becomes too much for Superman, who weeps for the dead.


 Superman&#39;s Enhanced Senses Show Him Every Victim He Doesn&#39;t Save 
          




Things got out of control fast when Beast Boy transformed into a Star Conqueror to stop an alien known as a Necrostar from destroying Earth. He was successful, but Amanda Waller, in her bid to ruin the Titans&#39; credibility, had the mysterious Doctor Hate mind-wipe Beast Boy, leaving him stuck as an out-of-control monster. To make matters worse, the newly transformed Beast Boy began unleashing waves of spores that started transforming the people of Earth into animal-human hybrids. The Titans and every hero not turned yet have been fighting to stop the invasion before the world is overrun by beast people.

Jon Kent may be Superman, but he&#39;s not as hardened when it comes to battle as his father. Jon&#39;s only been through a handful of crises compared to Clark Kent, and &#34;Beast World&#34; has been particularly grizzly as heroes and villains are becoming animals and attacking everything in sight. The only thing that makes this situation worse is just how much Jon is seeing and hearing. With his enhanced senses, Jon is extremely aware of how many people are dying at any given moment. While Superman&#39;s had a lifetime to selectively filter information in the heat of battle, Jon hasn&#39;t had as much practice and it&#39;s tearing the young hero up inside.

Superman&#39;s enhanced senses are ultimately a good thing as they can key him into people in trouble, no matter where they are in the world. However, in a calamity like this, it can be quite overwhelming. While there&#39;s no official number, it&#39;s almost certain that the death rate has to be in the thousands, with more people suffering injuries or worse, mourning the loss of loved ones. And Jon is hearing every single one, whether he wants to or not. Hopefully, Superman can work through the emotional pain of his powers and try to help resolve &#34;Beast World&#34; peacefully.
