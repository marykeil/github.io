# The X-Men s Most Trusted Member is a Mutant Fans Would Never Expect


## SUMMARY 



  Mutant Firestar seemingly betrayed her people in order to side with the villainous Orchis – only for it to be revealed that she is, in fact, deep undercover.   Firestar&#39;s position in Orchis was implanted in everyone&#39;s memories by Jean Grey in her dying moments; at least, that is, according to Firestar.   Firestar&#39;s real superpower seems to be her ability to gain unquestionable trust from people, as she has exhibited with both the X-Men and Orchis.

## Literature Review

Mutantkind&#39;s apparent betrayer, Firestar, has been revealed to be operating undercover, proving to be the X-Men&#39;s most trusted member after all.




Warning: Spoilers for X-Men #28!




Cyclops and Juggernaut have made it clear who the most trusted member of the X-Men is: Firestar. This is a shocking turn of events, given her place in the Marvel Universe right now. Publically, Firestar is viewed as a traitor, a mutant who betrayed her people in favor of Orchis – but in reality, she&#39;s a double agent, still working for the X-Men.

X-Men #28 – by Gerry Duggan, Joshua Cassara, Marte Gracia, and VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles – contained this major reveal. Even within the X-Men, very few people are aware that Firestar is still on their side, viewing her as a turncoat and an enemy. However, this seems to be a cost she&#39;s willing to pay to do vital work in the service of mutantkind&#39;s survival.

          

At a critical moment, with only her word to go on, both Cyclops and Juggernaut accepted Firestar&#39;s explanation of her behavior, elevating her to the status of one of the X-Men&#39;s most trusted members, placing an enormous amount of faith in her ability to ensure their survival.




                  X-Men Just Recruited the Avengers&#39; Most Underrated Powerhouse   The new arc of X-Men Unlimited focuses on Firestar&#39;s undercover journey in Orchis, revealing that her new mission is to fight her ex-fiancé Justice.   


 Cyclops and Juggernaut Choose To Trust Firestar 
          

When Orchis killed thousands on Krakoa grounds during the Hellfire Gala this year, one of those murdered was Jean Grey. In her dying moments, she telepathically implanted memories into the heads of Orchis&#39; top brass, making them believe they had recruited Firestar, making her mutankind&#39;s mole in the anti-mutant organization. Firestar reluctantly agreed to the arrangement; as Jean&#39;s dying wish, she didn&#39;t think she could refuse. In X-Men #28, while Firestar is infiltrating Orchis&#39; ranks, Cyclops and Juggernaut are both initially furious at her role in the recent events Orchis has pulled off. However, a Morse code sequence and a few whispers change everything.






Firestar debuted on the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends animated series, as well as in a tie-in comic, before making her canon debut in Uncanny X-Men #193, by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr.




Previously, in X-Men #26, Firestar narrowly escapes death at the hands of Shadowkat. This newly rebranded, Wolverine-esque Kate Pryde confronted Firestar, determined to kill her, until Firestar explained her involvement with Orchis. As unbelievable as it might sound, Kate accepted the explanation. Recent issues of X-Men have begun to more actively depict her positive contributions to mutantkind&#39;s cause, with Firestar helping Juggernaut escape Orchis imprisonment, and smuggling intel to the X-Men. Given Jean Grey&#39;s faith in Firestar&#39;s ability to pull off this undercover role, and how quickly other members of the team have come to accept her in this role, Firestar can now be considered the team&#39;s most trustworthy member.



 Firestar&#39;s Real Superpower Has Nothing to Do With Fire 


          




It speaks to an untapped superpower that Firestar seems to have: getting people to trust her wholeheartedly and unquestionably. The same can be said even with her role within Orchis – even as Moira MacTaggert seems to grow suspicious of her, Firestar&#39;s lies continue to convince the majority of Orchis&#39; upper echelon of leadership that she was with them since the beginning. Yes, Jean Grey&#39;s memory implants help, but this all could have come crumbling down as fast as it started if Firestar wasn&#39;t convincing in her approach. Firestar gets the X-Men to trust her truths and Orchis to trust her lies.

X-Men #28 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.
