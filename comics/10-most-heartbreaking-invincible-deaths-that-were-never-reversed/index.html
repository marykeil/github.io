Angstrom Levy could have found redemption, but his life was tragically ended when he was decapitated by Robot during a sudden betrayal.   The Guardians of the Globe, the world&rsquo;s greatest defenses, were brutally slaughtered by Omni-Man, leaving only the Immortal as the sole survivor of the shocking and violent betrayal.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>For all the ridiculous things the cast of Invincible survive, there were some tragic circumstances certain characters didn’t come back from.</p>
<p>Warning! MAJOR spoilers for Invincible ahead!While much of Invincible’s cast manages to survive some truly epic injuries, not everyone makes it out of the story alive. Sure, some characters have access to powerful technology or are blessed with the Viltrumites&rsquo; amazing healing factor. But some characters can only take so much before their bodies wind up giving out. Death isn’t an uncommon sight, but for certain characters, it’s an absolute shock seeing them finally perish. Read on to see the 10 most tragic deaths featured in Invincible.</p>
<p>Rus Livingston Was a Victim, Not a Villain
Invincible #70, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Rus Livingston was once an astronaut who went on an exploratory mission to Mars. Unfortunately, during his time there, Livingston was possessed by the psychic hive-mind alien race, the Sequids. After becoming the Sequid host, Rus returned to Earth and attempted to take over the planet and add every living creature to the Sequid hive mind. During the epic battle, Invincible makes the call to end Livingston’s life to stop the Sequids from spreading. While it was successful, Rus was just as much a victim of the Sequids as anyone else, but he paid the ultimate price.</p>
<p>Angstrom Levy Could Have Found Redemption
Invincible #108, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Angstrom Levy is one of the few people in Invincible who could be described as Mark’s nemesis. After a botched experiment radically transforms Levy, he dedicates his life to destroying Invincible and nearly succeeded. While Angstrom eventually let go of his anger towards Mark, Levy was kidnapped by an evil variant of Invincible, who held Angstrom prisoner to use his powers to expand the Viltrum Empire. Levy is decapitated by Robot during his sudden, unexpected betrayal. While Angstrom did a lot of nasty things, he was on the path to redemption before the evil Mark and Robot ended his life.</p>
<p>The Guardians of the Globe Were Omni-Man&rsquo;s Most Well-Known Victims
Invincible #7, Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker, Terry Stevens, Matt Roberts, Mark Englert, Dave Johnson, Cliff Rathburn</p>
<p>One of the most tragic deaths comes during the earliest issues of Invincible. After Mark developed his powers, Omni-Man decided to eliminate the world’s greatest defenses to prepare for the Viltrum Empire’s arrival. This, of course, meant Omni-Man had to kill the Justice League-like team, the Guardians of the Globe. Omni-Man faked an emergency to gather the team in one place then brutally slaughtered the team. The only person able to survive the onslaught was the Immortal, but the rest of the team perished during Nolan’s shocking and extremely violent betrayal.</p>
<p>Thragg&rsquo;s Children Were Merely Weapons for Him to Use
Invincible #139, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>After Thragg lost control of the Viltrum Empire, he decided to start anew by siring an army of Viltrum/Thraxan hybrids. Unfortunately, Thragg had no real love for his children. He simply wanted waves of soldiers he could use to destroy the traitors to the Viltrum Empire. During his final battle with Invincible, Thragg shows just how little he cares for his children by using them as weapons, throwing them one at a time at his enemy. Each one violently explodes against the much more resilient Mark. What makes the situation worse? His children were so devoted to Thragg that they willingly offered themselves up to be sacrificed.</p>
<p>Battle Beast Died Getting His Greatest Wish
Invincible #120, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Battle Beast is one of the greatest fighters in the Invincible and wanted nothing more than a worthy fight. He got his wish after he was sent by Allen on a secret mission to kill Thragg while he was in exile. After Battle Beast arrived, Thragg was injured by voracious aliens (released by Battle Beast’s partner, Thresha). Wanting an even match, Battle Beast injured himself and began a fight that lasted days. Battle Beast came closer than most to ending Thragg’s life, but he ultimately failed. While Battle Beast died content with the fight of his life, Thragg dishonored Battle Beast&rsquo;s life by turning his remains into a pelt.</p>
<p>Invincible Had No Option But to Kill Dinosaurus
Invincible #100, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Dinosaurus was the intelligent alter ego of David Anders, who believed in taking extreme measures to save the world. Mark decided to team up with Dinosaurus, believing the two could find a way to save billions of lives. However, Dinosaurus wanted to bomb major cities to accomplish his goals and winds up killing thousands of people, causing a rift between the two. After an intense confrontation, Dinosaurus comes to the conclusion that he’s too dangerous to be left alive and asks Invincible to kill him. Mark honors the request but he&rsquo;s forced deal with the consequences of their partnership.</p>
<p>Cecil Stedman Was Robot&rsquo;s First Victim
Invincible #111, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Cecil Stedman was a complicated figure in Invincible’s life. He lied to Mark’s face repeatedly and routinely used him to further his own agenda. However, the ever-prepared Stedman was taken by surprise after Invincible informed him that Robot was planning to take over the world in a mad attempt to protect it. Robot was forced to enact his secret plans and swiftly took out Cecil, slitting his throat and crushing his head in front of Mark. Invincible may have had his issues with Cecil, but even he didn’t think Cecil deserved to die like that.</p>
<p>Rex Splode&rsquo;s Biggest Sacrifice Proved His Heroism
Invincible #60, Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley</p>
<p>Rex Splode had a tendency to be a jerk, but his final moments proved how much of a hero he really was. During the Invincible War, Angstrom Levy attacks the Earth using numerous evil variants of Mark. One rogue Invincible attempted to destroy the Guardians, but Rex used his kinetic powers to turn everything he had had into an explosive weapon. But what the variant didn’t expect was Rex turning his skeleton into a bomb. Rex destroyed the evil Invincible at the cost of his own life, something that sent shock waves through the hero community.</p>
<p>Invincible&rsquo;s Brother Oliver Died Saving His Family
Invincible #132, Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker</p>
<p>Omni-Man’s son and Mark’s half-brother grew like a weed throughout the series, and it wasn’t long before he was an adult. During his time working for the Coalition of Planets, Oliver was assigned by Allen to act as a double agent to keep tabs on Thragg. However, Oliver gave up all pretense of acting as a spy when Thragg attempted to murder Mark and Eve. While he managed to save Invincible’s daughter, Terra, Oliver is ultimately felled by Thragg. The pain only grew worse for Invincible when he discovered the role Allen played in Oliver’s death.</p>
<p>Omni-Man Passed On in a Final Touching Moment
Invincible #141, Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker</p>
<p>Omni-Man did a lot of terrible things as a member of the Viltrum Empire. But the growth he experienced over the course of Invincible helped him develop as a person. Nolan abandons his former alliance and becomes one of the most crucial assets in defeating Thragg and his supporters. However, despite the redemption Omni-Man finds, it doesn’t stop him from meeting his maker in the story’s final battle with Thragg, who fatally wounds Nolan. In one of the series’ most heart-wrenching moments, Mark stays by his father’s side as Nolan reaffirms his belief that Mark can change the Viltrumites the same way Mark changed Omni-Man.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of tragedy to be found in Invincible, but these 10 deaths are truly the series&rsquo; most tragic.</p>
