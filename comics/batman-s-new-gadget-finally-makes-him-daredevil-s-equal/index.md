Summary

  Batman has a new gadget in Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham that amplifies his hearing, giving him the ability to follow criminals and use a hearing ability similar to Marvel&#39;s Daredevil.   By using this gadget, Batman increases his hearing by 35% and can track down criminals even if they manage to escape.   This new gadget is a game-changer for Batman, as it finally gives him the sonar ability that is synonymous with bats and enhances his street-level hero status.  







One of the major things that has let Batman keep up with super-powered individuals is his varied use of gadgets. While Batman has no powers himself, these gadgets can let him match people who do. Famously, Marvel&#39;s Daredevil has the ability to hear things at a superhuman level, and now, thanks to one brand-new tool, Batman can do that, too.

DC has recently launched a new Black Label book, Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham by Rafael Grampá, Mat Lopes, and John Workman, which features a dark storyline set in an alternate Batman mythos. But a brand-new villain isn&#39;t the only thing Batman has in this book: he apparently has a new gadget that finally gives Bruce Wayne the powers Batman needed from the start.

          

While breaking into a criminal laboratory in the first issue, Batman takes down several criminals while one of them manages to escape. In order to follow the criminal through the unfamiliar building, Batman uses a device in his cowl to amplify his hearing, letting him follow the criminal&#39;s footsteps. He increases his range of hearing incrementally over the course of the issue. Not only is this practically identical to what Marvel&#39;s Daredevil is famous for doing, but it also gives Batman the ability bats are most famous for: sonar hearing.




 : Batman&#39;s New Daredevil-Like Costume Is the Perfect Character Mash-Up


 Batman Uses Sonar to Locate His Enemy 
          

When Daredevil was a kid, he lost his sight due to a radioactive isotope that hit his eyes. This accident completely blinded the young Matt Murdock but granted him amazing abilities related to his other senses. Matt&#39;s renewed senses of smell and hearing allows him to detect the faintest scents, and his hearing is good enough to hear someone loading a bullet into their gun chamber from several blocks away. Because of this amazing radar sense, Daredevil has been able to act as a vigilante — but Daredevil&#39;s powers work better for Batman. Batman has configured his entire attire and persona around bats, and one of the biggest things bats are known for is their sonar ability.




Using his new gadget, Batman manages to increase his hearing by 35%, allowing him to follow a criminal despite how far away the man managed to escape. It&#39;s honestly surprising that it&#39;s taken this long in Batman comics for Bruce to use an ability so inherently attached to his namesake. Batman has used everything from electric gloves to infrared lenses in his cowl, but rarely has Batman used anything similar to sonar to deal with his enemies. This Batman and Daredevil &#34;crossover&#34; is the one superpower that Batman has really needed all this time.

Though Batman sometimes goes out on big space adventures, he is still, at the heart of things, a street-level hero. Batman fights petty thugs and criminals who are often below the likes of Green Lantern or Superman. This is why it&#39;s no surprise that Batman&#39;s best gadget in years has come from stealing the iconic power of Marvel&#39;s best street-level hero, Daredevil.
