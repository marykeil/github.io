## Literature Review

Expert cosplayer Caleb Weeks makes Spider-Man look incredible in this inspirational photoshoot, reminding fans of an iconic canon moment.




One of Spider-Man’s most dangerous and inspirational moments has been recreated through cosplay. When the chips are down and his back’s up against the wall, Spider-Man fights through the pain and fear to push forward. A breathtaking cosplayer shows the world how Spider-Man can survive anything by bringing this iconic moment to life.




Pro Cosplayer Caleb Weeks (@calebweekss) donned his Spider-Man suit for an incredible photoshoot, in which he re-created an iconic canon event, familiar to many long-time Spider-Man fans. Caleb’s cosplay features Spider-Man lifting himself out of heavy rubble with water pouring down his suit.


 

This photoshoot was inspired by a visual from comic artist John Romita Jr. who depicted this scene in Amazing Spider-Man #500. Romita Jr’s artwork pays homage to what is considered one of the most famous Spider-Man moment of all time, from all the way back in Amazing Spider-Man #33, from the “If This Be My Destiny” storyline.

Amazing Spider-Man #500 was written by J. Michael Straczynski, with artistic contributions from John Romita Jr. and John Romita Sr. It was released in 2003.




In a pivotal, character-defining moment from the “If This Be My Destiny” storyline, Spider-Man is trapped under a pile of flooding rubble by the Master Planner, who has been revealed to be Doctor Octopus. While he lies trapped under the weight of the rubble and the water drowning him, Spider-Man feels like he’s failed Aunt May and his loved ones again. However, it is his internal willpower that causes him to escape death, as he manages to lift himself out of the wreckage with his pure strength. This was a milestone for the character at the time. It displayed the extent of Spider-Man&#39;s physical strength, while solidifying that his nature is to never give up.



Amazing Spider-Man #33 was written by Stan Lee, with art by Steve Ditko. It was released in 1963.







The impact of this image is still felt sixty years after Amazing Spider-Man #33 was released, as exhibited by this faithful cosplay recreation. It remains a perfect example of a scene that shows Spider-Man&#39;s never-say-die attitude. Cosplayer Caleb Weeks noted in his Instagram post about Spider-Man’s incredible feat of strength: &#34;What I love most about Spider-Man is his ability to keep on fighting. His willingness to save others even if it’s at the expense of his own life.&#34; Caleb ended his caption with: &#34;Every single day grants us new opportunities to be a hero. It’s just up to us to seize the moment and be great.&#34;

Expert cosplayer Caleb Weeks loves Spider-Man, so much in fact that it allows him to recognize the hero in all people. Remaking this inspirational scene pays homage to decades worth of Spider-Man lore and imagery, in a way that is likely to lead new fans to these classic stories as well. The best of Marvel’s heroes come from a place of humanity, where they constantly doubt they are the right person to save others. Spider-Man chooses to believe in his strength despite impending doom to save Aunt May, MJ, and all of his loved ones. As Caleb Weeks highlights, Spider-Man gives fans around the world a reason to always get back up and save others.
