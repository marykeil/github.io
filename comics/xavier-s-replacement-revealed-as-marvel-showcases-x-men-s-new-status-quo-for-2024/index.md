# Xavier s Replacement Revealed, as Marvel Showcases X-Men s New Status Quo for 2024


## SUMMARY 



  The Timeless comic reveals glimpses of the X-Men&#39;s future, suggesting that they may return to the Xavier Institute.   Magneto is shown as the potential new leader of the X-Men, wearing his classic helmet and sitting in a large chair, similar to Xavier&#39;s wheelchair.   This wouldn&#39;t be the first time Magneto has taken over as leader of the X-Men, as he previously replaced Xavier as headmaster of the Xavier Institute during the Trial of Magneto.

## Literature Review

One of the teasers seen in this year&#39;s Timeless hints that the iconic Magneto may be replacing Xavier as leader of the X-Men in the mutant&#39;s new era. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Timeless and Rise of the Powers of X #1As the iconic Krakoan Age of the X-Men enters its final breaths, mysterious teasers for the mutant&#39;s newest era have been unveiled in the annual Timeless comic, showing that the new leader of the X-Men may be the iconic Magneto. Soon to be returned to life in Resurrection of Magneto, this would not be the first time that the Master of Magnetism led an X-Men team, or replaced Charles Xavier as the mutants de facto mentor.




This year&#39;s annual Timeless comic, from writer Jackson Lanzing with artists Juann Cabal and Edgard Delgado, revealed several glimpses into the Merry Mutants future, hinting that the X-Men may be returning to the status quo of the Xavier Institute.


 

The future leader of the X-Men&#39;s rebooted universe - also shown in Marvel&#39;s trailer for Timeless - seems to be Magneto, shown wearing his classic helmet and sitting in a large chair, an image reminiscent of Xavier&#39;s famous wheelchair.


 Magneto Is Becoming The X-Men&#39;s New Professor Xavier 
          

It makes sense that Marvel would want a fresh leader for the X-Men, following the upcoming reboot of the X-Men franchise and Xavier&#39;s intense fall from grace throughout the Krakoan Age. Magneto emerged as a truly compassionate, effective, and strong leader for the nation of Krakoa, avoiding many of the ethical and self-centered pitfalls that Xavier fell into during their time on the Quiet Council. Timeless reveals Magneto, sitting in a chair with a suit and his classic helmet on, with Cyclops standing beside him, hinting that Magneto will be the powerful presence leading the X-Men into the light of their newest era.




The Timeless trailer also reveals that there is a &#34;Prisoner X&#34; locked within the classic version of the Danger Room, and there is a chance that this &#34;Prisoner X&#34; is actually &#34;Professor X.&#34; Currently, in Rise of the Powers of X, Charles Xavier is attempting to reset the entire timeline of the Marvel Universe, erasing Krakoa from ever existing but also saving the world from the coming Enigma Dominion. It seems likely that he will fail, and Krakoa will not be erased, so perhaps the X-Men have locked Xavier up for his attempt at resetting their universe, leading to Magneto stepping into Charles&#39; shoes as the mutants&#39; wise mentor and leader.



 This Is Not The First Time Magneto Has Replaced Xavier 
          

There is a lot of precedence for Magneto taking over leadership of the X-Men from his longtime friend, enemy, and collaborator Charles Xavier. At the Trial of Magneto in Paris, Xavier was attacked and gravely injured by the Nazi mutants the Fenris Twins, and was forced to travel to space with his love Lilandra Neremani of the Shi&#39;ar to heal himself. Xavier begged Magneto to take his place as headmaster of the Xavier Institute, to prove the former villain&#39;s change in heart and mind, and Magneto reluctantly agreed to honor his friend&#39;s wishes. While Magneto&#39;s time as headmaster did come to an end, he was a powerful advocate and mentor for the New Mutants, while working alongside the X-Men on their official team.




Little is known about the future of the X-Men, like if their new era will be a reboot to the days of the Xavier Institute or an entirely different approach to mutantkind. Regardless, it appears that the iconic Magneto will be taking on a leadership role once again, replacing Charles Xavier as leader after the X-Men &#34;rise from the ashes&#34; following the fall of Krakoa and a new status quo for mutantkind.

Timeless #1 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
