# Wolverine Mentored a Surprising MCU Hero, Setting Up the Perfect Marvel Movie Connection


## SUMMARY 



  Yelena Belova, Black Widow&#39;s &#34;sister,&#34; looks up to Wolverine and takes his advice seriously, potentially setting up a connection between the X-Men and the MCU.   In the White Widow comic series, Yelena has become an assassin consultant and mentor, using her skills to train the next generation while also fighting against a nefarious corporation.   Yelena&#39;s strong confidence, support for other women, and snarky personality could potentially tie the X-Men characters to the existing Avengers in future MCU films, especially with Deadpool 3 in production.

## Literature Review

As the MCU creates more and more small ties to pull the X-Men into its orbit, a new mentee of Wolverine&#39;s could easily incorporate him into Phase 5.




For all that Wolverine claims to be a lone wolf, he certainly has been a father figure to a lot of young female characters. In a recent flashback, Marvel revealed a new MCU star who thinks Logan is cool, and took some advice from him seriously: Black Widow&#39;s &#34;sister,&#34; Yelena Belova. As the MCU pulls the X-Men into its orbit, and Deadpool 3 has marked the return of Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine, this connection could find its way into a theater near you.




Just like the series&#39; first issue, White Widow #2 by Sarah Gailey, Alessandro Miracolo, and Matt Milla, kicks off with a flashback of Yelena on an assassination mission where she crosses paths with an Avenger. White Widow has been sent to kill Wolverine, but so has another, weaker assassin. Yelena and Logan call a temporary truce while taking out the third, and quickly slide into great banter.



          

As Yelena taunts the fallen assassin, she also tells her what she did wrong and lets her live to try again. Wolverine, himself a non-traditional educator sometimes, informs White Widow that she&#39;d make a great teacher.

                  After 32 Years, Marvel Fans Finally Know How Predator Lore Changed Wolverine Forever   Wolverine&#39;s origins have always been shaded by trauma and retcons, but it seems the Predator is more responsible for his suffering than fans knew.   





 Wolverine Inspired White Widow to Become a Teacher 


          

 In her own series, White Widow has left the Red Room behind to become an assassin consultant and mentor. What she expects to be a more peaceful existence, however, is interrupted by the massive corporation Armament, which may be evil. In between trying to save her new neighborhood, Yelena has a thriving business teaching the next generation of assassins how to kill quickly, escape without a trace, and set up dental insurance. One of the reasons Armament is moving so aggressively against Yelena is because the company wants to hire her for itself. She really is a great teacher.

After being obsessed with surpassing Natasha Romanoff, Yelena has found some semblance of peace by just trying to be herself. Her unshakable confidence and high body count are two solid reasons that she&#39;s so in demand as a mentor. Yelena knows her own worth, and rather than tearing down other women, as she was raised, she supports them and wants to build them up. Despite thinking group names are silly (she calls the X-Men &#34;your little club&#34;), she doesn&#39;t put down the two members of B.A.D. Girls who attack her to take back the Armament tech. She just files their name away in White Widow&#39;s ever-growing list of dislikes.






 White Widow Could Tie Together the Thunderbolts and the X-Men 
          

 Florence Pugh&#39;s scene-stealing performance as Yelena in Black Widow and Hawkeye has fans aching to see her again. Sarah Gailey&#39;s writing for the White Widow solo series portrays a Yelena that is as tough and funny as her MCU version, so this could be an interesting way of tying the X-Men characters to existing Avengers and friends. The MCU takes a lot of inspiration from modern comics, so it&#39;s not out of the question to see this sort of snarky interaction on the big screen, especially with fourth-wall-breaking Deadpool 3 in production. Wolverine knows what it&#39;s like to be made into a weapon by an uncaring government, so his mentor relationship with White Widow would be a welcome moment for fans.
