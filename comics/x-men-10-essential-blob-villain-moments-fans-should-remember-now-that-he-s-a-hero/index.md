## Literature Review

Blob has given up his life of villainy to become a hero with the Uncanny Avengers, but that doesn&#39;t excuse his past crimes. Here are his Top 10 worst!




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Uncanny Avengers #4 The Blob is one of the X-Men’s original villains - predating the likes of the Sentinels and even the Juggernaut - and his significance in Marvel Comics goes far beyond his longevity alone. In fact, Fred Dukes actually just gave up his life of villainy to join the Uncanny Avengers in the face of the sinister Orchis.
Since the Blob is now an honorary member of the Avengers and the X-Men, it may become increasingly easy to overlook the many villainous actions of his past, especially given how integral he’s sure to become as a hero of Marvel’s future. Here are 10 essential Blob villain moments fans should remember now that he’s a Marvel hero.









 








 10  The Blob Was One Of The 1st Villains To Defeat The X-Men 
X-Men #3 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby


 







The second, to be exact. The Blob debuted in X-Men #3 as a mutant who didn’t know he was a mutant. All he knew was that he was special, which is why Fred spent the majority of his life working for a traveling circus, putting his powers on full display for the price of an entry ticket. When he was approached by the X-Men and told what he was, the Blob immediately grew arrogant and malevolent. He lashed out at the X-Men, claiming to be superior to them due to the nature of his mutation (which essentially prevents him from taking any damage during a fight, along with a fair level of super strength).
While the Blob wasn’t necessarily wrong in his assertion, since he did manage to beat every member of the X-Men at once, his initial reaction to finding out he was a mutant was alarming to say the least, and it set him down a dark path he’d stay on for quite some time.





 9  The Blob Joined Magneto &amp; His Brotherhood of Evil Mutants 
X-Men #7 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby


 







Only a few short issues after attacking the X-Men by himself, the Blob decided to do so with a team of like-minded supervillains. In issue #3, Professor X wipes the Blob’s mind of the X-Men (that’s the only way they were able to beat him). But in this issue, Magneto helps the Blob remember his hatred of the mutant heroes, at which point Dukes decides to join him.
The Blob would be a member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants for many years following this initial team-up, even after a number of changes in the leadership and roster.





 8  The Blob Joined Mystique &amp; Her Freedom Force 
Uncanny X-Men #199 by Chris Claremont and John Romita, Jr.


 







When the Blob had finally left the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he joined Mystique and her newly-formed… Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. Granted, that’s not too different from the previous non-Magneto iteration of the Brotherhood he had with Unus the Untouchable (and their stint on Factor Three), but this team stands out, as it wouldn’t keep the ‘Brotherhood’ title for long. Under Mystique, the Blob and his team become a government-backed outfit renamed the Freedom Force. Their job was to capture and otherwise neutralize mutants/super-powered individuals who would take the law into their own hands outside governmental regulation - including the X-Men.
In an official capacity, the Blob wasn’t a villain at all, but rather an extension of governmental authority. Unfortunately, the side of the government that backed the Freedom Force was extremely anti-mutant, and riddled with corruption, landing the Blob on the wrong side of the moral spectrum yet again.





 7  The Blob Got A Major Upgrade From Onslaught 
X-Force #52 by Jeph Loeb and Adam Pollina
        

Onslaught showed the Blob through mental probing the extent of his mutation, and how to access this massive upgrade. No longer was the Blob simply able to take any hit thrown at him, but he learned how to actually turn his body into a malleable putty, allowing him to stretch, shapeshift, and even engulf his enemies with his raw flesh alone.
The Blob’s alignment with Onslaught made him infinitely deadlier, which makes sense given the caliber of villain Onslaught proved to be.





 6  The Blob Played A Part In The Assassination Attempt Of Senator Kelly 
X-Men Vol. 2 #106 by Chris Claremont, Leinil Francis Yu, Thomas Derenick, and Anthony Williams
        

After being de-powered from the grotesque upgrade Onslaught helped him achieve, the Blob joins Mystique again. This time, they weren’t being backed by any particular body of the government, but instead sought to reshape its very structure by eliminating a particularly problematic politician. The Blob participated in the assassination attempt of Senator Kelly that was masterminded by Mystique.
While unsuccessful, the Blob nearly threw the world into chaos by trying to kill an elected official. And even if the senator’s death didn’t lead to anything drastic (which fans know it would have), doing so is still one of the more serious crimes one can commit.





 5  The Blob Attacked His X-Corps ‘Teammates’ Uncanny 
X-Men #406 by Joe Casey and Aaron Lopresti
        

When Banshee decided to form his own team of mutant heroes called the X-Corps, he recruited Blob to act as the ‘heavy hitter’ on the team, which made sense at the time. After all, the X-Men had Colossus, the X-Factor had Strong Guy, and the X-Force had Warpath. Naturally, the X-Corps needed to fill that role as well, and Blob was as good a recruit as anyone. The only problem was: the Blob didn’t join the team willingly. Instead, he was mind-controlled into doing so.
After the Blob figured out that he was tricked into being a mutant hero against his will, he went crazy and started attacking his ‘teammates’. Honestly, the Blob had every right to be angry, but he starts to lose sympathy when the thing he’s angry about is that he was forced into being a good guy.





 4  The Blob Became A MGH Drug Dealer 
Uncanny X-Men Vol. 3 #20 by Brian Michael Bendis and Chris Bachalo
        

Following the global mutant catastrophe that was M-Day, a drug hit the scene in Madripoor that was commonly known as MGH (Mutant Growth Hormone), and the Blob smuggled and dealt MGH with Mystique as his supplier. Mystique and Blob sell MGH (which was produced by Dazzler) to fund their efforts to turn Madripoor into a mutant sanctuary, and revitalize the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with some serious money behind it.
However, when the two went to Magneto with this plan, he reacted violently, as he was angered that the two dealt MGH at all, no matter their reasoning.





 3  The Blob Joined Miss Sinister To Kill The X-Men 
X-Men: Blue #26 by Cullen Bunn and R.B. Silva
        

To be fair, the Blob didn’t join Miss Sinister so much as he was captured, tortured, and experimented on by her until he was quite literally beaten into submission. However, given his inclination to follow the strongest villainous leader in his immediate area, it’s fair to say that he probably wouldn’t have needed much convincing anyway, especially since he was helping Miss Sinister do the one thing he’s been trying to do alone since his debut: kill the X-Men.
Like Onslaught, Miss Sinister helped the Blob achieve a major upgrade, as she helped him unlock the power to morph his body into a literal gelatinous blob, making the prospect of injuring him with any attack utterly impossible. Plus, he gained the ability to reshape his body any way he wanted, making him a far deadlier opponent as well.





 2  The Blob Literally Ate The Wasp (Ultimate Universe) 
Ultimatum #2 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch
        

This entry stands out as being the only one that doesn’t cite a moment from Blob’s villainous past within Marvel Comics’ main continuity of Earth-616, but rather that of the original Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610). However, this moment is one of the most infamous in the Blob’s Marvel Comics history, regardless of the version of the character. At the start of the Ultimatum event, after Magneto flooded New York, killing millions as a result, the Ultimates were helping to clean up the city and deal with any of the fallout. While searching for survivors, Hawkeye stumbles upon a sight of grotesque horror: the Blob eating the Wasp.
The image of the Blob cannibalizing a founding Avenger has been burned into the minds of Marvel Comics fans since it was printed, and will assuredly stay there as the Blob ventures into the realm of heroism in the current canon.





 1  The Blob Joined Captain Krakoa &amp; His Mutant Liberation Front 
Uncanny Avengers Vol. 4 #1 by Gerry Duggan and Javier Garrón
        

After finding peace and acceptance on Krakoa, the entirety of mutantkind was essentially wiped out after Orchis massacred the X-Men during the most recent Hellfire Gala. The Blob was among the survivors, but like practically every other mutant that made it out alive, he was without a leader to follow. That is, until Captain Krakoa showed up and formed the Mutant Liberation Front. Thinking it was still Cyclops under the mask (as he was the original Captain Krakoa), the Blob was happy to commit atrocious acts of mutant terrorism in the name of fighting back against Orchis. Tragically, it was Orchis who was pulling the strings of this ‘Captain Krakoa’ (who, in fact, was not Cyclops), meaning the Blob unwittingly sided with yet another team of villains.
At the end of Uncanny Avengers #4, however, the Blob learned the error of his ways and promptly sided with the Uncanny Avengers against the Orchis-backed Mutant Liberation Front, marking one of the most significant moments where the Blob actively chose the side of good rather than evil. However, even with his newfound redemption arc, it’s hard to forget all the villainous things the Blob has done throughout X-Men lore, with these 10 moments just being a few handfuls of his extensive history.
Uncanny Avengers #4 by Marvel Comics is available now.
