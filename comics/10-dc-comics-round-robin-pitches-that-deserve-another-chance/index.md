## Literature Review

DC Comics’ Round Robin tournament teased a lot of interesting ideas for full-length miniseries, but these 10 pitches deserve a second chance.




There are a lot of pitches DC Comics brought to fans’ attention during its Round Robin competition that unfortunately just haven’t seen the light of day as a fully actualized series. DC’s Round Robin tournament has allowed fans to vote between dozens of pitches to pick its next series, such as Robins and Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow, the previous two winners. Unfortunately, pitches that don’t win wind up being abandoned altogether. But DC showed a willingness to bring previous competitors back as a full miniseries with Blue Beetle: Graduation Day. If Blue Beetle can come back, then the following 10 pitches absolutely should as well.









 








 10  Justice League Redacted 
        

Justice League Redacted was a first-round elimination in the 2022 Round Robin, losing out to Suicide Squad Dark. The miniseries would have seen Green Arrow creating a new black-ops version of the Justice League to take a more proactive stance against evil. It&#39;s a similar premise to the miniseries Cry for Justice, but this comic would have put more focus on Oliver Queen as a leader. Green Arrow rarely gets the chance to take the lead when it comes to the Justice League and a series that examines him in that kind of role could make for an interesting experiment.





 9  Firestorm: Fourth World Problems 
        

Firestorm: Fourth World Problems was another first-round elimination from 2022, this one losing out to Kid Flash: The Speed of Fear. This miniseries would have put the warring halves of Firestorm into the spotlight and revealed that the Firestorm Matrix contains a “spark of the Life Equation”. This would have put the hero in direct confrontation with Darkseid, who wanted to claim the Matrix for himself. Firestorm is a severely underused character and it’s been years since he’s anchored a book. Having him face off against Darkseid would make for an amazing and thrilling return for the hero.





 8  Suicide Squad Dark 
        

Suicide Squad Dark was this close to winning the 2022 Round Robin before losing to Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow. As a finalist, fans got peek at the potential series from Zac Thompson and Garry Brown, which would have seen Amanda Waller leading a team of magic-based heroes and villains to assassinate Earth-13’s League of Shadows. DC Comics released a 10-page preview of the story which introduced several of its members such as a vampiric Batman and Spore, a twisted Swamp Thing-like avatar. The pitch showed a lot of potential and ambition which deserves to be fleshed out in a full series.





 7  Constantine &amp; the Demon: Vacation from Hell 
        

Constantine &amp; the Demon: Vacation From Hell made a valiant effort before being knocked out in the 2022 semifinals. This series would have come from Frank Allen and Nik Virella and featured occult hero John Constantine becoming the new host of the demon Etrigan. A 6-page preview of this story was eventually seen in Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow, which showed how the usually plucky Constantine was chaffing under the weight of hosting the demonic hero. It’s always fun watching Constantine get in over his head and watching him find a way to break his latest curse could have been really entertaining.





 6  Superman &amp; Lois Ignition 
        

Superman and Lois: Ignition was a competitor from the 2021 Round Robin which only made it to the second round. The story would have come from Colin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing, and Vasco Georgiev, and seen the husband and wife pair on an adventure across the galaxy. Lois Lane discovers that the solar system is a machine meant to trap and kill the Man of Steel, so as Superman heads out to save the universe, Lois joins him to crack the greatest mystery in her career. It’s always nice seeing Clark and Lois together, and a story of this size and scale sounds extremely intriguing.





 5  Green Lantern: The Birth of a Conspiracy 
        

Green Lantern: The Birth of Conspiracy was a book intended to star the Golden Age Green Lantern Alan Scott that would have been from Scott Bryan Wilson and Skylar Patridge. Though it was knocked out in the second round of the 2022 competition, fans got a peek at the potential story in a 6-page preview in Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow. The series would have been set in the 1940s and followed several government employees as they begin connecting the dots that place Alan Scott at several mysterious events. This book could have offered some fascinating insights into the Golden Age Green Lantern’s past.





 4  Justice League Queer 


 







Unfortunately for fans, Justice League Queer lost in the first round of DC’s first Round Robin. The book would have come from Andrew Wheeler and Luciano Vecchio and featured an all-LGBTQ&#43; team of heroes forming. The book may have lost to the eventual winner of the 2021 competition, Robins, but the team got to officially debut in DC Pride 2021 and returned in that year’s holiday special ‘Tis the Season to be Freezin. JLQ hasn’t been seen since (save for another Pride special), and a book that focuses on them could be a great opportunity for fans who wish to see more LGBTQ&#43; representation in comics.





 3  Hawkman and Hawkwoman: The Changeling 


 







Hawkman and Hawkwoman: The Changeling only made it halfway through the 2022 tournament, but it would have made some extremely interesting changes to two Justice League members. The book was envisioned by Cavan Scott and Fico Ossio and revolved around Carter Hall and Shayera Hol meeting their supposed ‘son’ Hektor. A backup in Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow teased this premise in a 6-page story, but unfortunately, fans haven’t yet seen what else Scott and Ossio had planned for their story. The mystery set up in this book is simply too interesting not to be followed up eventually in a full-length miniseries.





 2  Green Lantern: The Light at the End of Forever 
        

Si Spurrier and Marco Santucci envisioned Green Lantern: A Light at the End of Forever for the 2022 Round Robin, but it wasn’t meant to be. The comic would have followed an elder John Stewart living in the far reaches of space. The Green Lanterns are gone and chaos is reigning and Stewart contemplates if order can be restored. Like many other pitches, fans got a peek at this story in Superboy: The Man of Tomorrow, which showed the kind of contemplative comic it would have been. John’s always been one of the more beloved Lanterns and a story about him bringing order to a lawless world in his twilight years sounds incredibly interesting.





 1  Kid Flash: The Speed of Fear 


 







One of the most intriguing concepts for a Round Robin pitch was Kid Flash: The Speed of Fear. Brandon Easton and Travis Mercer’s story would have put Wallace West in the starring role and pitted him against two terrifying entities: The Reverse-Flash and the fear entity Parallax. But rather than face them separately, Kid Flash would have been in for the fight of his life after Thawne willingly becomes Parallax’s new host. A 6-page preview of the story showed just how frightening this concept was and it’s a downright shame if DC Comics never follows up on this unique premise.
DC Comics&#39; Round Robin competition has seen plenty of interesting pitches, but these 10 deserve a shot at becoming actualized miniseries.
