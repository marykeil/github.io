## Literature Review

Time is of the essence for Green Lantern and when he needs to purge himself of a dangerous corruption, John Stewart embarks on his first ‘soul trek’.




Warning! Preview pages ahead for Green Lantern: War Journal #4!A peculiar new ability is going to help Green Lantern overcome the most dangerous situation he&#39;s ever been in. John Stewart is racing against the clock to stop an infection from turning him into a member of the zombie-like Radiant Dead, and a trip inward could be the cure for what ails him.




In a preview for Green Lantern: War Journal #4 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Montos, Lord Premier Thaaros of the United Planets welcomes refugees of Euphorix to the planet Durla. Unfortunately, Thaaros hears word of the missing Green Lantern Varron and is forced to send of team of Green Lanterns to investigate.

         

Meanwhile, on Earth, John, a variant of Kyle Rayner, and the Green Lantern Caolán Shepherd take a trip inside John&#39;s mind. While this version of Stewart has never done this before, Kyle explains that his John used to do it frequently, calling it a &#39;soul trek&#39;. By using his ring to walk inside his own essence, John can heal wounds and trauma.

John Stewart thought he left a life of action behind when he left the Green Lantern Corps. However, his troubles were just beginning when a new threat known as the Radiant Dead came to the DC Universe. The undead army nearly extinguished the Emerald Light in their home dimension and have come to the Prime DCU to finish the job. To make sure no one stops them, the Radiant Dead attacked John and infected him. Now John is slowly being converted into one of the Radiant Dead and has only mere moments to save his life.

While Green Lantern wasn&#39;t aware that he had this power, it&#39;s a good thing he does. The Radiant Dead infection spreads quickly, even faster whenever John uses his Green Lantern abilities. But performing a soul trek doesn&#39;t appear to exacerbate his symptoms. Now he&#39;s got a way to root out the corruption and hopefully prevent him from turning into one of those monsters. While this is a good thing for Stewart to have in this situation, soul treks might come in handy for other injuries as well. Kyle doesn&#39;t imply there&#39;s a limit to what the soul trek could do, meaning John could theoretically use his ring to heal any injury, no matter how severe.






 Green Lantern&#39;s Soul Trek Can Help Him Overcome Any Villain 
          

Green Lantern&#39;s journey inward is the first time the Prime John Stewart has tried to heal an injury this way and it&#39;s his only shot to stop the corruption from turning him. If John succeeds, then this new move will be a true game-changer for him. No matter how powerful a villain Green Lantern fights, a soul trek could help him heal and recover. If something as insidious and powerful as the Radiant Dead can&#39;t claim John, then there&#39;s virtually nothing that could harm Green Lantern ever again (provided this mission is a success).

Green Lantern: War Journal #4 will be available from DC Comics on December 19th.
