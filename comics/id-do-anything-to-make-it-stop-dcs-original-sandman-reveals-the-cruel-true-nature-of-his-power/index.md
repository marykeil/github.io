## Literature Review

While Wesley Dodds&#39; Sandman doesn&#39;t have any official superpowers of his own, a reveal about his trademark gas means he&#39;s basically a metahuman.




Warning: Spoilers for Wesley Dodds: The Sandman (2023) #4 ahead!Wesley Dodds - the original Sandman - may be one of DC&#39;s oldest heroes, but a return to his adventures shows he&#39;s also one of the scariest. Dodds has long beaten criminals by knocking them out with a unique gas concoction, but it turns out they don&#39;t exactly get a good night&#39;s rest. The issue reveals what those exposed to Dodds&#39; sleeping gas actually experience, essentially giving him a dark superpower.




Having been dosed with his own sleep gas when chasing down a copycat Sandman (&#34;The Fog&#34;) in the previous issue, Wesley Dodds: The Sandman #4 opens with the fallout of this experience. This means fans actually get to experience the gas&#39; effects from Dodds&#39; first-person perspective, and it&#39;s horrifying. Dodds&#39; gas proves to be an incredibly potent hallucinogenic, forcing him to experience every single wrong he&#39;s caused throughout his lifetime from his victims&#39; perspective, making him feel the same pain and suffering they felt in those moments.

          

The experience proves excruciating. As Dodds describes it, &#34;every offense. Every hurt I&#39;ve spoken or committed...I experience their truth. I&#39;d do anything to make it stop.&#34; To add insult to injury, the visions spiral outward into warnings of future torments (alongside a reference to DC&#39;s Night Terrors event) before Dodds can finally escape into wakefulness.

                  &#34;The Macabre Man&#34;: After 84 Years, Sandman Has the Nemesis He Deserves   The Sandman’s newest villain isn’t just a bad dream. Someone has stolen Wesley Dodds’ heroic identity and is about to spread death to the world.   


 Sandman&#39;s Gas Forces His Victims to Relive Every Time They Hurt Someone 
The Extreme Nature of Dodds&#39; Power Is Justified by His Ties to Dream of the Endless


          

The hallucinogenic properties of the gas completely recontextualize Dodds&#39; reputation as an early hero, explaining why he can punch far above his weight class for someone with no functional superpowers. Despite ostensibly being just a detective in a trenchcoat, Dodds has created a power that results in incredible psychic anguish. However, given the fact that Neil Gaiman&#39;s classic Sandman #1 (1989) retcons Dodds as having a link to Dream of the Endless&#39; power, it makes sense that he has such an oversized ability.






Sandman (1989) #1 is by the team of Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, and Daniel Vozzo.




          

In DC lore, Dream - the embodiment of human imagination - was imprisoned for years by occultists who wanted to abuse his powers. However, since Dream is part of the natural order, the cosmos kept trying to fill the void he&#39;d left behind, resulting in several normal people becoming superheroic versions of the Sandman - Wesley being the most famous. For most of his life, Wesley didn&#39;t understand his true purpose, but this does explain how a normal person was able to develop a hallucinogenic that feels almost mystic in its potency - the entire universe was tilted in favor of Wesley succeeding in his mission and keeping the raging dreams caused by injustice under control.




Wesley Dodds&#39; Sandman tends to be overlooked when people think about DC&#39;s early heroes, but this display of his gas&#39; true power earns him a place at the table alongside the Justice Society&#39;s strongest. With a mind capable of unlocking truly hellish concoctions, and utterly relentless in his pursuit of justice, DC&#39;s original Sandman is a force to be feared.

Wesley Dodds: The Sandman (2023) #4 is available now from DC Comics.
