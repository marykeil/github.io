## Literature Review

Carnage continues to ascend the ranks of dangerous villains in the Marvel Universe, and he just found the only teammate who can match him; Carnage.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Carnage #2!




Few villains in the Marvel Universe are as dangerous as Carnage. The unhinged symbiote has struggled to function in villain team-ups, which is one of the few things that has prevented him from being as dangerous as he could be. However, now it seems that Cletus Kasady has finally discovered someone he can team up with, which is another version of himself.

Carnage #2 – by Torunn Gronbekk, Pere Perez, Erick Arciniega, and Joe Sabino – continues Carnage&#39;s latest rampage across the Marvel Universe, and he&#39;s now decided to return to Earth, forming a new church that worships him as a God. But to do this, he needs a partner, and with Cletus&#39; difficulty with finding teammates, there&#39;s only one person he feels he can turn to: himself.



          




Cletus Kasady finds another Cletus Kasady deep beneath a city that he once visited while on a school field trip – and as it turns out, this confusing revelation has actually been a long time coming.

                  Carnage Proved His Godhood By Replicating Thor&#39;s Most Epic MCU Feat   Carnage is one of the more dangerous villains in the Marvel Universe and he just proved how powerful he is by replicating a major MCU Thor feat.   


 Carnage Can Only Truly Rely On Himself 


          

After Cletus Kasady fused with Tony Stark&#39;s Extrembiote, the Carnage symbiote left him and went into space to try and become a God. This led to the Carnage symbiote traveling across the stars, killing pretty much anything that it could come across. Eventually, Carnage was sent back to Earth, and realized that it truly missed Cletus as its perfect host. It then regenerated a brand-new Cletus Kasady to use as its host. But the original Cletus was still on Earth, having survived his battle against Tony Stark during the Carnage Reigns event. Now, the Marvel Universe has two Cletus Kasady&#39;s who have just teamed up.




When Cletus Kasady was left behind on Earth with the Extrembiote, he decided to make a name for himself outside the Carnage symbiote. This led to the events of Carnage Reigns, where Cletus went on a massacre throughout New York City. This massacre was brought to an end by Tony Stark setting off a bomb inside of Cletus, seemingly killing the serial killer for good. Yet, like all good slasher villains, Cletus wasn&#39;t dead. A piece of him survived through Extrembiote and seems to have regenerated fully into an older Cletus Kasady. With the young and old Cletus teaming up, there&#39;s really no telling what two versions of Marvel&#39;s most deranged serial killer could accomplish.



 Two Cletus Kasadys Is Bad News For The Marvel Universe 


          

Carnage wants to be Marvel&#39;s next God, but becoming God isn&#39;t an easy thing. This requires worshipers, and he needs to create a cult that truly believes in him. This is going to require a lot of work and require some teammates. Due to how deranged Cletus is, teammates are hard to come by, which is why he&#39;s turned to the only person he&#39;s ever been able to rely on: himself. Cletus Kasady has been Marvel&#39;s greast, most deranged serial killer, and now the heroes of the Marvel Universe will need to contend with two versions of him. This could lead to Marvel&#39;s biggest and most absurd Carnage event so far.
