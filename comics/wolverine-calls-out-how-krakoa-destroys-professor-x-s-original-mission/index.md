# Wolverine Calls Out How Krakoa Destroys Professor X s Original Mission


## SUMMARY

Wolverine realizes the importance of teamwork and the support of others, as he reflects on his own journey and the failures of Krakoa.

## Literature Review

As the Fall of X nears, and mutantkind&#39;s Krakoan era ends, Wolverine contemplates how it all went wrong, starting with Professor Charles Xavier.




Warning: Spoilers for Wolverine #40!




As Krakoa falls, Wolverine contemplates how it all went wrong, starting with Professor X neglecting his original mission. The mutant nation essentially became defunct as soon as Orchis ran everyone off the island through force, following their assault on the Hellfire Gala. Professor X was the last mutant to leave the island, which, considering his position as its founder, is as ironic as it is tragic.

Wolverine #40 – by Benjamin Percy, Ibrahim Moustafa, Frank D&#39;Armata, VC&#39;s Cory Petit – features its protagonist reflecting Xavier&#39;s original mission statement for mutantkind, and how abandoning it doomed Krakoa. Since Krakoa&#39;s demise, it&#39;s become apparent who saw the writing on the wall from the start. Emma Frost predicted Krakoa&#39;s downfall from the start, as did Doctor Doom.



          




Wolverine is the latest among the X-Men to realize that Krakoa was always doomed to fail, specifically because one of the founders of Krakoa strayed from his original mission of bringing mutants and humans together by isolating all the mutants away from humanity.


 Wolverine Thinks Xavier Failed Krakoa from the Start 


          

During a space mission with Spider-Man in Wolverine #40, Wolverine gives an inner monologue about what he thinks went wrong with Krakoa, and as someone who has been alone since leaving Krakoa prior to the Hellfire Gala, he relates the island&#39;s problems with his own journey. &#34;Nobody&#39;s the best alone,&#34; he says. &#34;If you&#39;re not fighting for others ... then what&#39;s the fighting for?&#34; Wolverine feels like he&#39;s been at his worst lately, without the structure that comes with a team or the support of those around him – and as a corollary to that, he provides some insight into what went wrong with Krakoa.




Wolverine #40 explains why Logan has committed to so many team-ups lately, forming brief alliances with Hulk, Captain America, Black Panther, and now Spider-Man. The same can be said as to why he frequently partners with friend and collaborator, CIA agent Jeff Bannister – who Logan goes out of his way to send a heartfelt message, when he thinks he won&#39;t make it back from space. Wolverine articulates that no man is an island, and the more Krakoa steered away from the larger world society as an island relying solely on itself, the farther Krakoa started to stray from its original purpose.



 The Existence Of Krakoa Contradicts Professor X&#39;s Mission 
          

Anyone familiar with Professor X knows that dating as far back as the X-Men&#39;s original debut, Xavier&#39;s dream was for mutants and humans to unite together in perfect harmony and acceptance. When that proved too difficult to achieve, he abandoned his dream completely to give mutants a home for themselves. By dividing mutants further and further away from humanity, it only caused more division between the two races, which in turn gave Orchis a political voice as they spread their anti-mutant message of hate across the world. Now, mutants are hated and hunted worse than ever before, and Wolverine understands exactly why.






Wolverine #40 is on sale now from Marvel.
