# Star Trek Is Setting Up a Second God War, This Time Involving EVERY Cosmic Being


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek #16 teases the possibility of a second god war involving all cosmic beings in the franchise.   Lore&#39;s ascension to godhood and Kahless still being at large are unresolved plot threads from the first god war, and could factor into the next one.   The next god war, if it happens, will involve many more players and may spell the end of the Star Trek universe.

## Literature Review

While Star Trek&#39;s god war may be over, a new crisis, involving every cosmic being in the universe, is on the horizon. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Star Trek #16!




Star Trek is setting up a second god war, and this time it will involve EVERY cosmic being in the franchise. In 2022, IDW inaugurated their new line of Star Trek comics with the epic “god war” story, which came to a head in the crossover event Day of Blood. While the dust may have settled from that conflict, Star Trek #16 teases the war is far from over–and it may be even bigger next time.

The seeds for the second god war are sown in Star Trek #16, written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Marcus To. In a text piece made to resemble an official Starfleet Communication, the enigmatic Vulcan T’Lir tells an unidentified god-like being that they are aware of a meeting between “all remaining entities with a stake in the current crisis.” The unknown entity has called this meeting, for purposes unknown.

          




T’Lir then tells whoever they are addressing they will “see them soon.”


 Star Trek&#39;s God War Shook the Franchise To Its Core 
          

The god war, which raged throughout the first year of IDW’s Star Trek and its sister title Defiant, saw the Klingon Emperor Kahless wage war against the universe’s god-like beings. Gary Mitchell and the Crystalline Entities were among those who fell before Kahless’ rampage. The war climaxed in Day of Blood, which dealt Kahless’ campaign a major blow. Many of his followers abandoned him, and his dream of a Klingon uprising was crushed. Kahless is still at loose in the galaxy, and it is almost a given he will return at some point.

Another plot thread left hanging by Day of Blood, perhaps even bigger than Kahless’ still being at large, is Lore’s ascension to godhood. During the buildup to Day of Blood, Lore comes into contact with a massive AI intelligence, one far beyond even him and his brother Data. In Day of Blood’s epilogue, Lore, now charged with some unknown power, appears to Kahless’ followers, imploring them to follow him. Lore was integral in stopping Kahless, but as usual, he was following his own agenda. Lore has not been seen since the god war’s conclusion.




                  Star Trek Confirms a Shocking Limit to a God-Like Species&#39; Power   Star Trek&#39;s god-like entities the Bajoran Prophets are usually seen as good and omniscient, but they may be hiding a new secret.   



 Who Will Instigate the Second God War? 
          

With both Lore and Kahless still roaming the galaxy, each with their own agenda, either one, or both, of them could instigate another god war. Kahless still despises the god-like beings, and Lore is seeking to become one of them. While each has their own motivation, the next god war will see many more join the fray. Sisko and company halted the first god war because it posed a threat to all creation–and that was with just a few races. If more players are involved in round two, it most certainly will spell the end of the Star Trek universe.
