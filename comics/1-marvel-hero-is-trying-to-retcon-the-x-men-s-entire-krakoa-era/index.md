## Literature Review

Rise of the Powers of X #1 reveals Xavier&#39;s horrific plan to beat the Enigma Dominion... by killing a young Moira X and erasing Krakoa from history.  




Warning: contains spoilers for Rise of the Powers of X #1As the X-Men battle against the forces of Orchis on all fronts, former mutant leader Charles Xavier is setting his sights on a deadlier war, against the coming Enigma Dominion. Using Krakoa&#39;s No-Place as a hiding spot from the Dominion, Xavier plans to somehow time travel to murder Moira X before her mutant power ever manifests, resetting the current Earth-616 timeline and retconning Krakoa from existence.




Above all else, Charles Xavier wants mutantkind to survive, and if the Enigma Dominion arrives on Earth without anything standing in its way, the dark cosmic deity will use its vast power of ascension to absorb all conscious life on the planet into itself, killing Earth along the way.

          

Rise of the Powers of X #1, from writer Kieron Gillen and artists R.B. Silva and David Curiel, sees Charles Xavier revealing his dark and destructive plans to Sins of Sinister hero Rasputin IV, hoping she will aid him in saving mutantkind through whatever means necessary.


 Xavier Is Attempting To Erase The Existence Of Krakoa 
          




The Krakoan Age began with the reveal that Moira MacTaggert was a mutant with powerful resurrection abilities, causing the entire timeline of Earth-616 to reset upon her death. Sinister then used a &#34;Moira Engine&#34; - from multiple clones of Moira - to attempt to reach Dominion, inadvertently allowing Enigma to become empowered and reach the full status of Dominion. Xavier has a terrible track record of doing what he thinks is right while not consulting those who would be most impacted by his drastic and often unethical plans. Charles believes his plan is more important than anything else, having stolen Rasputin IV away from the X-Men right as she was going to help rescue Cyclops in Fall of the House of X #1.

Now, Charles wants to travel back in time to kill Moira before age 13 when her powers first activate, eliminating the current timeline, and causing the Dominion to be &#34;cut off at the root,&#34; while simultaneously completely erasing the very existence of the nation of Krakoa. Interestingly, Krakoa presumably knows of Xavier&#39;s plans and is okay with them, seeing as it and Cypher adapted the No-Place to house themselves, Xavier, Rasputin IV, and two yet unrevealed team members. It is unclear how exactly Xavier and his crew are hoping to travel back in time and murder Moira as a child without being discovered by Enigma, but many fans seem to think one of the unrevealed teammates could be the missing Manifold, a &#34;universal shaper&#34; who can fold time and space.






 Xavier&#39;s Destructive Plan Could Lead To His Imprisonment 
          

While this plan could potentially work in theory, it is doubtful that Xavier&#39;s plan will be successful. If Charles managed to murder Moira and erase the current timeline, four years of stories from the X-Men and every other Marvel franchise would be erased and retconned immediately, something that would detract from future storytelling and make many fans incredibly upset. Teasers for the X-Men&#39;s new era from this year&#39;s Timeless one-shot show a mysterious &#34;Prisoner X&#34; in the Danger Room, and it would make sense if &#34;Prisoner X&#34; was revealed to be &#34;Professor X,&#34; having been incarcerated for attempting to destroy Earth-616s timeline.

Charles Xavier would become the X-Men&#39;s greatest villain any day of the week if it meant he could save mutantkind, making him a tragic antihero and an incredibly flawed leader. If Xavier&#39;s plan to murder Moira and erase Krakoa from history comes to pass, years worth of X-Men character development and fascinating stories will cease to exist, a tragic conclusion to a beloved era.




Rise of the Powers of X #1 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
