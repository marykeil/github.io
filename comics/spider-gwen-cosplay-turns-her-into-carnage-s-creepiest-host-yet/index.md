## Literature Review

A cosplay from @biancabellacosplay presents what a Gwen Stacy and Carnage combination would look like, replacing Venom as her symbiote pairing.




A cosplay of Spider-Gwen reveals just how creepy the heroine can be when she becomes a host to Carnage. Best known as a hero and counterpart to Spider-Man in the universe, blending with symbiotes makes her much fiercer, as well as scarier. Her look is well-known and recognizable, but her Carnage iteration makes her stand out in an all-new way.




Spider-Gwen has been bonded to her Venom symbiote since Spider-Gwen #22, which was released in 2017. Since then, she has had a strange relationship with it. It has been more prominent on some occasions, such as during the King in Black event which ran from 2020 to 2021. This has earned her the nickname &#34;Gwenom.&#34; Despite this, she has not been host to the Carnage symbiote in comics.


 

However, fans often put twists on their favorite characters and Gwen Stacy is no exception, as she has now been transformed into a version of Carnage in Bianca Bella&#39;s cosplay. Shared on Instagram, this symbiote alteration is eery and captivating.

Bianca Bella has shared a different perspective on Gwen Stacy&#39;s alternate universe potential. Donning a red and black bodysuit that has a hooded attachment as well as several webbing accents and clawed fingers, this version of Gwen could have horrifying potential. Gwenom is already impressively power-boosted in her symbiote form and adding Carnage&#39;s twisted aggression to the mix could prove especially lethal for her enemies. The suit Bianca Bella wears is credited to therpcstudio, while the pattern is credited to Brandon Gilbert (@braekor). It is a stunning design that explores an alternative symbiote path for Marvel&#39;s fan-favorite Spider-Verse heroine.



 Spider-Gwen&#39;s Symbiote Has Unlimited Potential in Marvel Comics 

 

There have been numerous symbiotes in Marvel&#39;s comic universe, but also very different iterations of the Venom symbiote, shifting with each host. From Eddie Brock and Flash Thompson to Deadpool and Mysterio, there has been no shortage of hosts for Marvel&#39;s original Klyntar. Each host is affected differently through their bond based on their individual personality and abilities. Carnage has also been a much more aggressive and homicidal relative to Venom, often partly due to his bonds with hosts like Cletus Kassidy and the Red Goblin. While both host and symbiote affect their external manifestation, there&#39;s a good chance Gwen would be negatively impacted by a bond with Carnage. This could make her more menacing than she already is.





 

This cosplay from Bianca Bella presents a stunning example of what a bond between Gwen Stacy and Carnage could look like. It highlights an intriguing alternate possibility if she had bonded to Carnage instead of Venom. She likely would&#39;ve had a much different outcome as a hero, and it might even have impacted her role in the fight against Knull, the previous King in Black. Bianca Bella&#39;s cosplay is a fantastic representation of the many paths Marvel heroes like Spider-Gwen can take throughout their comic journeys, particularly where iconic villains are concerned.

Series featuring Spider-Gwen and Carnage are available from Marvel Comics.
