## Literature Review

As Wolverine takes on Weapon VIII, the Weapon X program&#39;s biggest success lashes out with deadly claws, flamethrowers, and more.




As Wolverine finally faces off against his predecessor Weapon VIII, Logan is brutalized by a vicious take on his iconic claws. In Marvel lore, the Weapon Plus group have been creating living weapons for almost a century, with Wolverine actually being part of the Weapon 10 project (the &#39;X&#39; in &#39;Weapon X&#39; is a Roman numeral.) Various stories have revealed the group&#39;s connections to major heroes and villains, however Weapon VIII has never been seen before... until now.






Additional weapons shown include palm blades, wrist-mounted flamethrowers, and some kind of miniaturized drone tech.




In a preview of Edge of Spider-Verse #1, Wolverine goes up against the spider-themed Weapon VIII. While Logan has his claws and healing factor, the preview art shows him losing hard, as Weapon VIII pins him with ultra-sharp prehensile limbs, then unleashes a flamethrower.

         

Also including the return of the digital hero Spider-Byte (last seen on the big screen, in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse), Edge of Spider-Verse #1 is coming from Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, Nilah Magruder, Travel Foreman, and Eric Gapstur.

While Edge of Spider-Verse titles are multiversal anthologies, with each story taking place in a different alternate reality, fans have never actually seen the mainstream Weapon VIII, making this spider-villain the official debut of Weapon Plus&#39; &#34;greatest previous success&#34; before Wolverine. Wearing a deadly take on Spider-Man&#39;s Iron Spider costume, Weapon VIII has four blade-like legs which cut through Wolverine&#39;s body with ease. Additional weapons shown include palm blades, wrist-mounted flamethrowers, and some kind of miniaturized spider-tech drones. It&#39;s easy to see why Weapon Plus considered Weapon VIII a major success story.

While Peter Parker&#39;s Iron Spider had prehensile limbs, it&#39;s clear that Weapon VIII has weaponized this feature in a new way, essentially creating a far more versatile version of Wolverine&#39;s claws. These limbs can be used to hold an enemy in place, allowing Weapon VIII to get in close and unleash the rest of its arsenal. The biggest difference is likely that Wolverine&#39;s bones were able to be coated in adamantium, making his claws unbreakable. Despite this, it&#39;s one of Logan&#39;s biggest vulnerabilities that he needs to get in close and soak up damage to be effective - something that&#39;s only possible because his mutant healing factor picks up the slack.

Coming from Kelly, Lanzing and Foreman, this story is being teased as &#34;the first appearance of Weapon VIII,&#34; suggesting Marvel has future plans for the killer. That makes sense, as some of Marvel&#39;s most beloved heroes and villains connect back to Weapon Plus. Currently, the canonical results of each Weapon Plus project are as follows:

 Weapon Plus Designate  Focus of Experiments  Resulting Superhumans   Weapon I / Project Rebirth  Super-Soldier Program  Captain America   Weapon II  Animal Experimentation  Brute Force   Weapon III  Mutant Experimentation  The Skinless Man   Weapon IV / Project Sulfur  Plant/Human Experimentation  Man-Thing, Man-Slaughter   Weapon V  Symbiote Experimentation  Sym-Soldiers   Weapon VI  Human Experimentation on Prisoners  Luke Cage   Weapon VII / Project Homegrown  Human/Cyborg Experimentation on Soldiers  Nuke   Weapon VIII  Creation of Sleeper Agents  Not Revealed   Weapon IX / Project Psyche  Psychological Experimentation on mutants  Typhoid Mary   Weapon X / Department K  Mutant/Adamantium Experimentation  Wolverine, Sabretooth, Deadpool (failed subject)   Weapon XI  Not Revealed  Not Revealed   Weapon XII  Super-Sentinel Experimentation  The Huntsman   Weapon XIII  Super-Sentinel Experimentation  Fantomex   Weapon XIV  Hivemind Experimentation  The Stepford Cuckoos   Weapon XV  Super-Sentinel Experimentation  Ultimatum   Weapon XVI  Living Religion Experimentation  Allgod   Weapon H  Hulk/Wolverine Hybrid Experimentation  Weapon H (aka Hulkverine)   Weapon Minus  LSD Experimentation  Doctor Mindbubble   Weapon Infinity  Mass Cyborg Experimentation  Deathlok Soldiers   






Now, Weapon VIII joins that list, revealing a deadly Weapon Plus experiment which likely ties back to the Spider-Verse&#39;s mystic animal totems. Given spider-heroes&#39; unique tendency to travel across the multiverse, fans shouldn&#39;t be surprised to see Weapon VIII appear in Marvel&#39;s mainstream reality soon - assuming of course that the assassin survives their inaugural battle against Wolverine.

Edge of Spider-Verse #1 is coming from Marvel Comics February 21.
