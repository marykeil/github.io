## Literature Review

Mister Fantastic often relies on his genius intellect, but his stretching abilities do a lot of heavy lifting - sometimes with horrifying results. 




Contains spoilers for Fantastic Four #14!!




Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four has come to be known as one of the Marvel Universe&#39;s foremost intellectuals –however, Mr. Fantastic&#39;s stretching abilities sometimes put a disturbing visual twist on heroism, and now he’s taken that to a whole new level. From growing octopus-like arms from fingers to turning one arm into a whole collection of working hands, Reed has moved well beyond just elongating his limbs.

Fantastic Four #14 – by Ryan North, Ivan Fiorelli, and Brian Reber –

Mr. Fantastic is in rare form, as he demonstrates just how much he can change and mold his body without breaking a sweat. He takes out Lady Octopus with one hand, taunting her that he can “arm [himself]” as well as she can, as he turns each finger into a long, tentacle-like appendage.

          




Reed creates a dozen individual hands without even standing up from his chair. Although he’s best-known for his intelligence, Mr. Fantastic&#39;s mastery over his stretching abilities makes him one of Marvel&#39;s most horrifying, if effective, heroes.

 Mr. Fantastic’s Powers: Useful AND Frightening 
          

Reed Richards is one of the smartest characters in the Marvel Universe. He frequently relies on his mind to solve problems, but he’s no stranger to combat, either. The Fantastic Four have faced down some of the most vicious enemies around, so there’s no room for Mister Fantastic to be a slouch on the battlefield. Still, his most impressive physical feats tend to be more on the defensive side, as he stretches himself to either form a protective shield around others or encase someone to prevent them from fighting. Reed even successfully deploys the latter tactic against fighters as skilled as Wolverine, as seen in Wolverine (Vol. 3) #22.






Wolverine (Vol. 3) #22 was written by Mark Millar, with art by John Romita Jr., and Klaus Janson. It was released in 2004.




In Fantastic Four #14, his use of his abilities is far more casual, somehow making it more disturbing to see. He creates a dozen new hands to shut down the Metamind so quickly, it appears to be a regular activity. With sufficient need, it seems possible that Reed could stretch himself into a whole second body – or maybe more. At the very least, turning each limb into a dozen others just like it makes one many into a whole small army. His mind works quickly enough for multiple people, and his uncanny ability to sprout new, independently working limbs further expands his presence.



 Mr. Fantastic&#39;s Physical Powers Are Nearly As Limitless As His Intellect 
          




Whether he’s using his mind for good, evil, or some debatable area in between, it’s unlikely that Reed will trade in his brains for brawn any time soon, especially when the rest of the Fantastic Four can tear things apart with such ease. This fresh look at his abilities still shows that he could be a formidable physical force, should he need to be. Growing new hands or sprouting octopus arms for the sake of a taunt only scratches the surface of what he can do. It isn&#39;t exactly pleasant to behold, but it&#39;s certainly effective. As the Fantastic Four work to restore their reputation, they need all of Mr. Fantastic&#39;s many hands and arms on deck.

Fantastic Four #14 is available now from Marvel Comics.
