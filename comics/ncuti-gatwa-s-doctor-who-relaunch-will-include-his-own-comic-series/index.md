## Literature Review

Ncuti Gatwa will soon debut as the Doctor, and Titan Comics has announced a new series starring the 15th Doctor.




Ncuti Gatwa’s forthcoming Doctor Who relaunch will include a new comic series from Titan. This Christmas, Gatwa will debut as the 15th Doctor alongside brand-new companion Ruby Sunday. The BBC is pulling out all the stops for this bold new era of Doctor Who, and Titan Comics, who have published titles based on the venerable franchise, will roll out a new book starring Gatwa’s 15th Doctor.




Titan Comics announced the new Doctor Who series in a post on X, formerly Twitter. The series will debut in a special to be released on Free Comic Book Day in 2024, written by Dan Watters, with a regular series to follow later in the year. Titan did not release any additional information on the new series, such as the artist or a release date.


 

Titans’ Doctor Who: The Fifteenth Doctor Free Comic Book Day Special will also mark ten years of Doctor Who comics from Titan.

Doctor Who celebrates its 60th anniversary in 2023, and the BBC is celebrating in style. David Tennant, who played the beloved 10th Doctor, has returned for a series of holiday specials, culminating with a Christmas episode that will mark Ncuti Gatwa’s debut as the Doctor. Russell T. Davies, who helped launch Doctor Who into the modern era in 2005, has also returned to the franchise as showrunner, promising big things ahead. Titan Comics will get in on the act with their own comic starring Gatwa’s Doctor.





 

For the past decade, Titan has published some epic Doctor Who comic books, with nearly every Doctor getting their own series. The books have attracted top talent, who flesh out and add to the show’s mythos. Dan Watters, who made a name for himself with titles such as Sword of Azrael, Arkham City and Home Sick Pilots, will be the first to write the 15th Doctor’s adventures. While no premiere date has been set for either the TV show or the comic, they will nonetheless be debuting around the same time, giving fans smitten with Gatwa’s Doctor even more exciting stories.
