<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Spy X Family is more lighthearted compared to a lot of other darker modern anime series, with laugh-out-loud humorous moments in many of the episodes.</p>
<p>The popular anime and manga series, Spy x Family, is filled with some of the most hilarious moments in recent anime and manga history. When the anime began airing in April 2022, fans immediately fell in love with the series and the Forger family as a whole. Each member of the family is hiding a secret identity from the others and this makes for some pretty humorous situations.
Loid is a talented spy named Twilight, Yor is a talented assassin, Anya Forger is a young girl with incredible telepathic abilities, and even the family dog, Bond, can accurately predict the future. All of these unbelievable personalities came together to form a fake family in order to further their individual goals. However, it is not always easy for the group to keep their abilities hidden, and the family becomes involved in all kinds of wacky escapades and scenarios throughout the course of the series.</p>
<p>10 Anya Proclaims Her Love For Peanuts
&ldquo;Operation Strix,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 1</p>
<p>Anya&rsquo;s absolute obsession with peanuts is a recurring gag throughout the Spy x Family series. In the very first episode of the anime, she introduced herself with the words, &ldquo;My name is Anya. I love peanuts, but hate carrots.&rdquo; Her fondness for the snack food appears again and again throughout the course of the series. In season 1; episode 12, &ldquo;Penguin Park&rdquo;, Anya got in trouble for attempting to enter Loid&rsquo;s bedroom and he reprimanded her, then later cheered her up with peanuts.
This hilarious fact about Anya appears many times. The telepathic girl even suggested using the name &ldquo;Peanuts&rdquo; for Bond Forger, the family dog. This silly personality trait of Anya&rsquo;s makes fans laugh every time it appears in the show. The fact that she can seemingly be instantly soothed in any situation by a package of peanuts is incredibly amusing and created one of the funniest scenes in Spy x Family.</p>
<p>9 Anya Insults Loid&rsquo;s Homemade Spy Wars TV Show Episode
&ldquo;Short Mission: 9,&rdquo; Volume 12; Chapter 68.1</p>
<p>In this chapter, Loid pulled out all the stops to assist Anya in becoming a stronger student at Eden Academy. Her recent failure on an important test prompted him to turn to the one thing he knows Anya will listen to wholeheartedly; the Spy Wars TV show. He and his partner, Franky, crafted a homemade episode of Spy Wars, hoping to strengthen the young girl&rsquo;s intelligence through a medium she would enjoy. Unfortunately, the result was an incredible failure and laughably bad, causing Anya to tell Loid it &ldquo;sucks.&rdquo;
This fan-favorite manga chapter has not been adapted into an anime episode yet but is certainly worthy of its spot on this list of funniest scenes. It is comedic because it shows Anya&rsquo;s hysterical and sometimes blunt personality in the series very well. This hilarious moment also showcases the comedic attempts Loid makes to help Anya become better in school, a recurring theme in the series.</p>
<p>8 Anya Reenacts A Scene From Spy Wars
&ldquo;Will They Pass or Fail?,&ldquo;Season 1; Episode 5</p>
<p>In this episode, Anya got to play the role of a character on her favorite television show, Spy Wars. The Forger family had been under a lot of stress while waiting for their daughter&rsquo;s Eden Academy entrance exam results but discovered that she was accepted to the prestigious school. To reward Anya&rsquo;s hard work, Loid and his partner, Franky, agreed to stage an elaborate reenactment of one of her favorite scenes from Spy Wars, her all-time favorite show.
This scene is hysterical because Loid, Franky, and Yor all play roles that are out of character to amuse Anya. They even rented a castle to make the scene feel more accurate to the show, which is humorous and a kind display of appreciation for the young girl&rsquo;s success. The drunken Yor Forger steals the show in this moment, swearing to protect Anya from being &ldquo;kidnapped&rdquo; in a comical attack against Loid before quickly passing out. This elaborate production is one of the show&rsquo;s most amusing moments to watch and shows the characters&rsquo; acknowledgment of their daughter&rsquo;s efforts.</p>
<p>Spy X Family Code: White Receives Official English Release In Spring 2024<br>
Spy x Family Code: White has had major success since its release in Japan back in December, and its official English release has finally been set.</p>
<p>7 Yor And Fiona Face Off In A Hilariously Intense Tennis Match
&ldquo;The Unwavering Path,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 23</p>
<p>Fiona Frost is one of Loid&rsquo;s partners who goes by the spy name Nightfall. She also has a huge crush on Loid and hopes to steal him from Yor. She finally confronts his wife in this episode and put her tennis skills to the test, making Anya nervous. Surprisingly, although Fiona is incredible at tennis, Yor&rsquo;s devotion to her family spurred her on, and she was the victor in the tennis match. This horrified and upset Fiona, who begrudgingly accepted her loss.
It is hilarious how high-stakes this tennis match becomes. Both women seemed to use it as a way to fight for a place in Loid&rsquo;s life rather than a simple game of tennis, which is quite a hysterical concept. Anya also humorously read the women&rsquo;s thoughts and became worried Fiona would &ldquo;steal&rdquo; Loid if she won the game, which is an outlandishly ridiculous idea as well, making this one of the series&rsquo; most laughable moments.</p>
<p>6 Yor&rsquo;s Brother, Yuri, Demands Loid and Yor Kiss
&ldquo;The Counter-Secret Police Cover Operation,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 8</p>
<p>This episode showed one of the most stressful moments the undercover Forger family had encountered yet, when Yuri, Yor&rsquo;s overprotective brother, came over to the Forger residence. Yuri also happens to be a member of the Secret Police. The couple had to convince him of their love for one another or risk blowing everyone&rsquo;s covers, since Yuri&rsquo;s organization is in direct opposition with Loid&rsquo;s.
Unfortunately, he did not fall for the couple&rsquo;s act, and they continued to put on increasingly hilarious displays of affection. This moment is one of the most hysterical in the series because Loid and Yor both acted awkwardly in the hopes of convincing Yuri they are a genuine couple. When they were pushed to kiss each other, Loid was calm and composed while Yor was nervous, a hilarious juxtaposition that perfectly showcases their very different personalities in the series.</p>
<p>5 Yor Unleashes Her Terrifying Side When Anya Is In Danger
&ldquo;Disarm The Time Bomb,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 14</p>
<p>Episode 14 truly showcased how far Yor is willing to go as a mother when protecting her child from danger. Anya and Bond were being pursued by terrorists and Yor intervened, revealing her true identity as an accomplished and powerful assassin. She terrified the Berlint University Student Terrorists and even, funnily enough, accused Keith Kepler of kidnapping her daughter.
Yor&rsquo;s loving instincts are both incredibly sweet and a little terrifying to witness, scaring even Anya, as she shifts into full-on attack mode to save her. This scene is quite entertaining to watch. No one would expect sweet and unassuming Yor to possess such incredible fighting skills, but she does. She released them at this moment with a truly comedic result that is one of the funniest in the series.</p>
<p>4 Spy &ldquo;Daybreak&rdquo; Fails Hilariously At His Mission To Change Test Scores
&ldquo;Uncle The Private Tutor / Daybreak,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 18
The shockingly untalented spy, &ldquo;Daybreak&rdquo; crossed paths with the talented Loid Forger as they embarked on very similar missions to change students&rsquo; test scores at Eden Academy. Loid changed Anya&rsquo;s score to improve it, while Daybreak hoped to give the Desmond brothers poor scores. Daybreak did not carry out his mission well and Loid had to pick up his slack at every turn to keep them both from getting caught by fixing his sloppy work and giving him an I.D. to use. The inferior spy failed, since Loid had to sabotage Daybreak&rsquo;s mission in order to further his own.
Daybreak&rsquo;s antics are incredibly entertaining to watch, as he tried to be Loid&rsquo;s rival but could not possibly fail more miserably at his goal. He almost compromised the mission for both of them, and Loid&rsquo;s frustrated outbursts are quite hysterical. These moments of Loid trying to work around Daybreak&rsquo;s idiotic actions are some of the funniest in the series.</p>
<p>Spy x Family Proves Why Classic Shonen Heroes Are Important With Anya<br>
While Spy x Family isn&rsquo;t a typical Shonen story, one of its protagonists Anya just inadvertently proved what makes classic Shonen Heroes great.</p>
<p>3 Yor Is An Absolutely Terrible Cook
&ldquo;Yor&rsquo;s Kitchen / The Informant&rsquo;s Great Romance Plan,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 16</p>
<p>Another topic that comes up quite consistently in Spy x Family is Yor&rsquo;s poor cooking. In this episode, she decided to work on this skill in order to make a meal that would impress her family and she received lessons from her co-worker, Camilla. Eventually, Yor produced a tasty dish, but not before her first horrible attempt that caused Camilla and Dominic to collapse in disgust. Hysterically, her brother Yuri loved the meal, even though it was awful.
Yuri&rsquo;s enjoyment of Yor&rsquo;s terrible food shows his overwhelming love for her, but is also quite funny because her food is shown by all other characters to be almost inedible. People&rsquo;s reactions of revulsion and Yor&rsquo;s terrible mistakes in the kitchen are laughter-inducing to watch. Thankfully, the stew she eventually served Anya and Loid tasted good, but her journey to cook one edible dish is one of the series&rsquo; most hilarious.</p>
<p>2 Bond Forger Gets Jealous of Agent Penguin
&ldquo;Nightfall; First Fit of Jealousy,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 21</p>
<p>The Forger family dog named Bond became incredibly jealous of Anya&rsquo;s beloved plush penguin. His envy grew to such levels that he eventually snuck into her room and attacked the plush, tearing it to shreds. Bond quickly felt remorse for his unkind actions, but thankfully, Loid was able to patch Agent Penguin up. The dog apologized to Anya, and she forgave him, sealing the apology with a handshake between Bond and Penguin.
This Spy x Family moment is both heartwarming and hilarious, perfectly showcasing the lighthearted feel of the show. It is comedic that Bond felt such resentment towards an inanimate object, but certainly displayed his love and care for Anya in a very comic fashion that produced one of the funniest scenes in the series.</p>
<p>1 Anya Produces A Hilariously Misleading Report On Loid&rsquo;s Career
&ldquo;Investigate The General Hospital / Decipher The Perplexing Code,&rdquo; Season 1; Episode 20</p>
<p>For a school project, Anya visited Berlint General Hospital with Loid because she had to learn about a career and create a report with information about that job path. However, Loid&rsquo;s spy work and psychiatric work at the hospital became intermingled on that day. After seeing this, Anya wrote a laughably incorrect depiction of the career of a psychiatrist, which she then shared with her professor and the entire class.
This episode is one of the funniest because it showed Loid&rsquo;s difficulty living two different identities. Even if he tries his best to hide his spy occupation, Anya&rsquo;s telepathy ability makes this utterly impossible. It is also hysterical to see Anya telling her class that her father physically attacks his patients at the hospital, which caused her history teacher, Henry Henderson, to become incredibly concerned. This circumstance is just one of the amusing misunderstandings Loid&rsquo;s double life causes and one of the funniest Spy x Family moments.
