# Ultron Would Lose His Mind Over Wolverine s New Adamantium Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  Wolverine seeks adrenaline through extreme sports, leading him to ask Forge to craft an adamantium surfboard.   The surfboard provides Wolverine with a near-death experience, showcasing his signature style and love for danger.   The recreational use of adamantium may exasperate villains like Ultron, but Wolverine chooses the thrill of surfing over creating another weapon.

## Literature Review

As a death-defying member of Marvel&#39;s X-Force, Wolverine has Forge make him a new weapon out of adamantium (and the MCU&#39;s Ultron would be furious).




In Marvel&#39;s X-Force, Wolverine is gifted a new kind of adamantium weapon guaranteed to surprise fans... and make MCU&#39;s Ultron furious.




Featuring Logan taking a rare day off from protecting the mutant nation of Krakoa with time to kill, the former Weapon X decides to seek adrenaline through extreme sports, proving that Wolverine always needs some sort of battle (even if it&#39;s recreational). But in X-Force #25 from writer Benjamin Percy and artist Robert Gill. Logan decides to take his hobby further by having Forge craft him something that&#39;s as epic as it is ridiculous.



          

Hilariously, the issue reveals that Wolverine had asked Krakoa&#39;s resident inventor Forge to build him a surfboard. Made out of what else? Adamantium.

 Wolverine&#39;s Surfboard Gives Adamantium A New (Pointless?) Purpose 


          






It makes sense for Krakoa to host a supply of adamantium, kept in reserves should it be needed to recoat Logan&#39;s bones (once brought back using the island&#39;s resurrection protocols). But in using some of the invaluable metal to create an adamantium-coated surfboard, Forge provides Wolverine with something else he desperately needs: a near-death experience. How better to unwind from a life spent hacking and slashing in defense of the planet than battling nature itself, risking a brutal beating by hundreds of pounds of crashing waves? The motivations may be more destructive than therapeutic, but the creativity proves there is nothing Wolverine does without his own signature style. Just don&#39;t let anyone who covets the precious metal see how the X-Men anchor is putting it to use.

Original as an adamantium surfboard may be, it would no doubt exasperate villains like Ulysses Klaw, or the MCU&#39;s Ultron, considering his famous criticism of humanity&#39;s use of vibranium &#34;to make a Frisbee&#34; (Captain America&#39;s shield). After all, vibranium is the &#34;most versatile substance on the planet,&#34; and the same is true of adamantium in the comics. It stands to reason that is the X-Men-related adamantium been available in the MCU, it&#39;s likely Ultron would have also sought out the substance to make his upgraded body even more indestructible. Which makes the purely recreational use pale in comparison.




But then, why do the expected and forge another weapon or suit of armor from a substance like adamantium, when there are deadly waves waiting for Wolverine to surf?
