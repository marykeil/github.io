## Literature Review

The Kickstarter for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return has reached over ten times its original goal - which fans met in 45 minutes.




BOOM! Studios&#39; Kickstarter for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return is nearing its end with a whopping total over $500,000, having earned its original $50,000 total within just 45 minutes. Amy Jo Johnson, the actress who played the original Pink Ranger Kimberly Hart in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, is co-writing Power Rangers: The Return, a new comic book series in collaboration with BOOM! Studios and Hasbro.




Last month, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return&#39;s Kickstarter page officially went live and - as of this writing - the campaign is within hours of ending. However, those following the campaign could rest assured that the Kickstarter goal was reached in just 45 minutes after launching, and continues to rise, netting $541,480 so far according to BOOM! Studios&#39; campaign page. The series comes from Amy Jo Johnson, Matt Hotson and Nico Leon.

          

The swift, almost immediate success of the Power Rangers: The Return Kickstarter page is not only a great sign for the project itself, but an even better sign for the Power Rangers franchise as it transitions into a new era.

The series looks at an alternate universe that puts a twist on classic Mighty Morphin Power Rangers lore. Instead of the core members of the Power Rangers team gradually leaving over time, they instead resolve to stay together even while pursuing careers outside of Rangerhood. Unfortunately, it comes at the price of losing Zordon and Alpha-5 in a tragedy that causes the entire team to disband. Flash forward to over two decades later when the only remaining active Ranger, original Red Power Ranger Jason, goes missing, causing the group to reunite.

The new series will introduce a brand new timeline for the original team - one including Green Ranger Olivia Hart, who is the daughter of Kimberly Hart and Tommy Oliver. Other changes include a closer bond between Lord Zed and Rita Repulsa, and new post-Zordon careers for each classic hero.

2023 marked an interesting transitionary period for the Power Rangers franchise during its 30th anniversary. The latest season of the show, Power Rangers Cosmic Fury, has been rumored to be the final season of the show as fans know it as the franchise preps for a reboot geared towards young adults. In the midst of change, it&#39;s easy for a fanbase to lose interest, but as The Return&#39;s Kickstarter results skyrocket from loyal fans, it&#39;s clear that the fanbase remains as faithful as ever, and has a reliable home in comics. If ever there was a sign that the Power Rangers franchise is still alive and kicking with a vested interest from its audience, it&#39;s the success of The Return&#39;s Kickstarter.
