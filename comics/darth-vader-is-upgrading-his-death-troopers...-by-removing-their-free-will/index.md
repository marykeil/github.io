## Literature Review

Darth Vader is planning to correct a major mistake with his fearsome Death Troopers in the Star Wars canon, and the solution is extremely dark.





Summary

  Darth Vader plans to remove the free will of his Death Troopers to ensure they never betray him again.   Vader&#39;s Death Troopers were carefully chosen and created by him, but their loyalty was ultimately to Palpatine.   If successful, Vader will have more intimidating and loyal Death Troopers that are solely his tools alone.  







Following a massive betrayal in the Star Wars canon, Darth Vader intends to upgrade his Death Troopers in the darkest way possible. Having learned that he truly has no power that can&#39;t be taken away or used against him by Emperor Palpatine, Lord Vader is now planning to forge a power that&#39;s wholly his own. However, this does mean that his most elite troopers will be paying the price.

As seen in a new preview for Star Wars: Revelations #1, the Dark Lord of the Sith is taking swift action following the events of Darth Vader #40 by Greg Pak and Raffaele Ienco. As seen in the recent issue, Vader attempted to test his master on Coruscant only to have his own carefully chosen Death Troopers turned against him. Wanting to ensure that it will never happen again, it seems Vader will be &#34;upgrading&#34; them in Star Wars: Revelations #1, an anthology of short stories teasing what&#39;s to come in 2024. The preview pages can be viewed below:

         




As seen in the preview for &#34;Tool of the Empire&#34; by Greg Pak and Salvador Larroca, Vader is seeking to &#34;correct&#34; the biggest weakness in his Death Troopers: their free will.

 Darth Vader&#39;s Death Troopers Explained 
Why Did Vader&#39;s Elite Troopers Betray Him?
         

As introduced in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Death Troopers were the Empire&#39;s most elite troopers. Specially trained in multiple forms of combat and weapons training, Death Troopers were assigned to the most dangerous missions, covert operations, and the protection of the highest-ranking Imperial officers including Grand Admiral Thrawn, Grand Moff Tarkin, Director Krennic, Moff Gideon, and more. While this included Darth Vader as well, this new preview hints that Vader&#39;s Death Troopers were carefully chosen and &#34;created&#34; by the Dark Lord himself.




That being said, not even Vader could retain his Death Troopers&#39; loyalty as soon as his master wished otherwise. As seen in Darth Vader #40, Palpatine reveals that Vader&#39;s troopers ultimately serve him, proving that the only power his apprentice has in the Empire only comes through his service to Palpatine himself. As such, it looks as though Vader is looking to make his Death Troopers more like droids, removing their ability to choose and thereby guaranteeing their loyalty going forward.



 What&#39;s Next For Star Wars&#39; Death Troopers? 
Will They Serve Vader Once More?
          

Assuming Darth Vader&#39;s efforts are successful, it seems he&#39;ll soon have Death Troopers that are even more intimidating and disturbing. They&#39;ll also never betray him again in the Star Wars timeline as they&#39;ll truly be Vader&#39;s tools alone rather than being the Imperial weapons they once were. While it remains to be seen how Darth Vader will accomplish this dark upgrade, it&#39;s quite possible he could end up using the same behavioral implants that were used on the Republic&#39;s clone army to ensure their compliance during Order 66 and the Jedi Purge (though that&#39;s purely speculation ahead of the full Star Wars issue).
