## Literature Review

Sarada finally has the chance to become stronger than her father in her upcoming huge battle.




In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, Sarada is the last Uchiha besides Sasuke, and as such there&#39;s a lot of pressure to live up to her legendary predecessors such as Itachi and Madara. She has always been talented and a brilliant ninja, but now Sarada&#39;s time to surpass Sasuke has finally come.




In chapter #5 of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, the self-aware God Trees are reflecting on their new status. Each of them decides on a goal that will define their new personality and existence. These new Boruto villains are copies of victims of the Claw Grimes born from the Ten-Tails, and they possess the looks and power of their originals.

          

Sasuke&#39;s clone, who is called Hidari, has his eyes on Sarada Uchiha, and although this means she is in a lot of danger, this is also her chance to go up against her father&#39;s almighty power and officially surpass him.

                  Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Hints At How Naruto Will Die   Naruto is in more danger than ever, with Boruto: Two Blue Vortex&#39;s latest chapter revealing that he is being targeted by the new main villain.   





 Sarada Is On The Path To Becoming The Strongest Uchiha 
          

What makes these new villains very scary is that they have access to their victim&#39;s full arsenal of techniques, plus the fact that they can tap into the almost unlimited well of chakra from the Ten-Tails. Sasuke&#39;s clone is even more frightening given how he immediately used Chidori as soon he gained consciousness. This leads readers to conclude that he can use Rinnegan, Fire Style, and all of Sasuke&#39;s powerful moves. It is not a stretch to say that Hidari is a stronger version of Sasuke, and he set his sights on Sarada.

Despite how grim it might look for Sarada, all hope is not lost. She became one of the youngest Uchiha to awaken the Mangekyou Sharingan in chapter #80 of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, when she pleaded with Sasuke to help Boruto. Furthermore, 3 years have passed since readers saw her fight, and considering how gifted and hard-working she is, it is a fair assessment to say that she has improved her fighting capabilities significantly. Going up against someone who looks eerily like her father will prove to be an emotional burden, but what makes Sarada an incredible ninja is her use of logic and wit, and she will definitely confront Hidari with no restraint.






 Sarada Will Have To Surpass Her Father To Achieve Her Dream 
          

Sasuke is perhaps the most powerful Uchiha of all time, only surpassed by Madara at his peak. Defeating an even stronger version of him seems a daunting task, but Sarada will have to do that if she wants to succeed Naruto and achieve her dream of becoming Hokage. With how powerful Boruto has proven to be after the time skip, Sarada should not lag behind, and should become stronger than Sasuke if Boruto: Two Blue Vortex really wants to prove to be a worthy sequel to Naruto.
