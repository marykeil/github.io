## Literature Review

Marvel Comics Ultimate Universe pushed the boundaries of what fans could handle, from horrific gore to character changes. Here&#39;s the 10 most shocking!




The Ultimate Universe has recently been rebooted in Marvel Comics, and it&#39;s already raising the bar for how extreme a new ‘ultimate’ continuity can really be. Though even still, it’s fair to say that the original Ultimate Universe will be pretty hard to beat in that regard, as it had no shortage of truly shocking moments during its fifteen-year publication history.
Kicking off in the year 2000 as a way to revitalize the Marvel Comics brand, and then ending violently in 2015’s Secret Wars event, the Ultimate Universe has since become a staple in Marvel history - though not always for the best reasons. From beloved heroes meeting gruesome ends, to iconic characters having their stories twisted into bizarre and sometimes corrupted versions of their Earth-616 counterparts, the Ultimate Universe wasn’t afraid to really push the boundaries of what readers could handle. Here are the 10 most shocking moments from the original Ultimate Universe!

Deadpool has one of the most impressive healing factors in comic book fiction, which means his injuries can be the most gruesome. Here&#39;s the 10 best! 












 








 10  Wolverine &amp; Spider-Man Switch Bodies, &amp; It’s More Uncomfortable Than It Needed To Be 
Ultimate Spider-Man #66 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley


 







This issue opens with Logan waking up one morning to discover that he is now the teenager, Peter Parker, with Peter having the same startling realization inside the body of Wolverine. While the storyline is - for the most part - a fun ‘Freaky Friday-esque’ adventure, there’s a level of perverted creepiness that totally ruins it. While inside the body of Peter, Wolverine makes a number of sexual advances towards an underage Mary Jane Watson, who was Peter’s girlfriend at the time.
Even in the early 2000s, this storyline was shocking, mostly because of the predatory depiction of Wolverine.





 9  The Hulk Is A Sexually-Charged Cannibal In The Ultimate Universe 
Ultimates #5 by Mark Miller and Bryan Hitch


 







When Bruce Banner Hulks-out in this issue, it’s due in part to Betty Ross being on a date with Freddie Prinze, Jr. and also because he was just being ridiculed by the other members of the Ultimates. As the Hulk, he rampages through New York City, and seeks out Ross and Prinze while they’re on a date, and when he finds them, Hulk screams about how he wants to be sexually intimate with Betty (in a much more crude manner), which is something he says again later after Thor beats him with Mjolnir.
When Iron Man attacks him, Hulk rips off his helmet and tries to eat Tony Stark&#39;s head, screaming about how hungry he is. He does this before trying to eat other members of the Ultimates as well, proving that he wasn’t just attempting to be weirdly intimidating, he actually wanted to eat them.





 8  Magneto Does The Impossible &amp; Actually Kills Wolverine 
Ultimatum #5 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch
        

Ultimatum is full of scenes filled with shock and horror, but none were as surprising as the death of Wolverine by the hand of Magneto. Wolverine is a character who practically can’t die, with one storyline even showing him regenerating from a single drop of his own blood (X-Men Annual #11). Not only that, but even when Magneto attempted to kill Wolverine within the continuity of Earth-616 (1993’s “Fatal Attractions”), all he did was rip the adamantium from his body and spark the next stage of his mutation. But in the Ultimate Universe, Wolverine is killed permanently, with nothing more than a clawed hand remaining of him.
Even in a story where Magneto kills Charles Xavier, and is then himself killed by Cyclops, the one death surrounding Magneto that is still the most shocking has to be that of Wolverine.





 7  The Blob Kills The Wasp (By Eating Her) 
Ultimatum #2 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch
        

After Magneto tilts the Earth on its axis, causing detrimental flooding around the globe - including and especially in New York City - the Ultimates commit to damage control before launching an investigation into what exactly happened. While each member took to the streets of New York, seeing where people needed their help, Hawkeye stumbled upon a truly grisly sight: the Blob eating the Wasp. Apparently, Blob was able to grab Wasp as she was trying to help civilians, and rather than simply killing the superhero (as many villains would have assuredly done), the Blob eats Wasp right there in the street.
This version of the Blob lived up to his supervillain moniker in a way the original Earth-616 version never could, and it’s just as grotesque as one would imagine.





 6  Doctor Strange Is Gruesomely Murdered By Dormammu 
Ultimatum #4 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch
        

New York City flooding wasn’t the only immediate fallout from Magneto’s assault on the entire world, as the resulting destruction of Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum allowed the dread Dormammu to cross into the physical plane. While Doctor Strange confidently fought the demonic entity, he proved too weak, and Dormammu wasn’t messing around. Dormammu wrapped Doctor Strange in mystical bands and constricted him until his head literally popped off.
This is an especially shocking moment for fans of the MCU, as Doctor Strange was able to best Dormammu upon his first encounter with the evil entity, yet in this continuity, Strange is killed like it’s nothing - and in absurdly brutal fashion.





 5  The Thing Crushes Doctor Doom’s Head In His Hand 
Ultimatum #5 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch


 







When the Thing discovers that it was Doctor Doom who manipulated Magneto into waging war against the world, and was thus responsible for the countless deaths that ensued - including a number of beloved heroes, and Ben Grimm’s personal friends - he sought him out with only one thing in mind: vengeance. Without hesitation, the Thing walked into Doom’s chambers in Latveria, took Victor&#39;s head in his hulking hand, and clenched his fist until there was nothing left of Doom’s head but a bloody stump.
The idea that the Thing could kill someone like Doctor Doom, who once harnessed the power of the Beyonders and became as close as one could be to God, is incredibly shocking (and even more badass).





 4  Cyclops Gets Assassinated By Quicksilver 
Ultimatum #5 by Jeph Loeb and David Finch
        

Not only was it a shock when Cyclops was seemingly shot in the head as he was giving an address on behalf of mutantkind in Washington, DC after Magneto was killed, and the conflict was won, but that it was Quicksilver who did it. Quicksilver was supposed to be dead. That’s pretty much the whole reason Magneto nearly destroyed the world. But, as fans learned, he only pretended to be dead in order to make Magneto angry enough to launch his ultimate attack on humanity.
Quicksilver then gets revenge on the man who killed his father, while throwing human/mutant relations back into disarray.





 3  The Ultimate Universe Implied A Romantic Relationship Between Quicksilver &amp; Scarlet Witch 
Ultimates 3 by Jeph Loeb and Joe Madureira
        

Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were originally siblings in the prime Marvel Comics timeline of Earth-616… and they’re still siblings in the Ultimate Universe - which is why the fact that they had an implied romantic relationship was so utterly shocking. While the two characters had been mainstays throughout the wider Ultimate Universe continuity all the way back to the first Ultimate X-Men run, they wouldn’t develop into potential romantic partners until Ultimates 3.
In one issue, the Wasp implies to Captain America that the Maximoff siblings have a ‘special relationship’. In another issue, readers see a silhouette of the two siblings that leaves very little to the imagination, cementing this extremely taboo and utterly unexpected moment in Marvel Comics that will assuredly live forever in infamy.





 2  Hulk Ripped Wolverine In Half, Sparking Some Major Controversy 
Ultimate Wolverine vs Hulk #1 by Damon Lindelof and Leinil Francis Yu
        

Wolverine made his debut fighting the Hulk in Earth-616, so naturally, the Ultimate Universe had to have a ‘Hulk vs Wolverine’ battle too, and this one really stepped up the violence. Not only did the two fight, but Hulk actually ripped Wolverine in half. This was a major controversial moment in the fandom, as it showed the Hulk breaking the adamantium bonding on Wolverine’s spine, which is something that shouldn’t have been possible.
While the fandom still rages over this particular moment - with the ‘Ultimate Universe isn’t canon’ crowd finding their shining moment with this one - it’s an undeniably awesome scene, and marks this fight as perhaps the coolest between the two characters.





 1  Peter Parker’s Spider-Man Dies, Passing The Torch To The Now-Iconic Miles Morales 
Ultimate Spider-Man #160 by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley
        

Comic book characters, in general, do not die permanently, and they certainly don’t die and then pass their moniker off to someone else. There are a few exceptions, of course - with Mar-Vell’s Captain Marvel being a great example - but even in his prime, Captain Marvel was nowhere near the level of popularity boasted by Peter Parker’s Spider-Man. It’s for this reason that “The Death of Spider-Man” storyline (which came to a violent end in Ultimate Spider-Man #160) was so shocking, as it did what no other storyline dared to do: actually kill Spider-Man.
Peter Parker’s death was then cemented with the rise of Miles Morales, who promptly took over as the Ultimate Universe’s one and only Spider-Man, and who would go on to become just as iconic as Peter Parker in the eyes of fans. This story was a pioneer within the realm of comic book fiction, making it one of the 10 most shocking moments from Marvel Comics’ original Ultimate Universe.
