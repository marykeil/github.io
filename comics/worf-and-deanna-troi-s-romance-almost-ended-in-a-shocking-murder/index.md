## Literature Review

Worf and Troi&#39;s relationship was never popular with Star Trek fans, and in an alternate timeline, it ended in cold-blooded murder.




Worf and Deanna Troi’s romance was controversial in the Star Trek universe, but this romance almost ended with a shocking murder. The two characters had their share of romantic encounters with others throughout Star Trek: The Next Generation’s seven seasons, but at the show’s end, the producers decided to pair them off. The romance was poorly-received by fans, and in the alternate timeline of Star Trek: The Lost Generation, it ends in murder.




Star Trek: The Last Generation was written by Andrew Steven Harris and drawn by Gordon Purcell. In this timeline, the Klingons conquer the Federation, creating a rebellion in the process. Worf, the ruler of Earth, keeps Troi as a concubine, initially unaware that she is also a member of the rebellion.

          

Worf eventually wisens up to Troi’s plans, and kills her, but not before getting under the Klingon’s skin with jabs at his effectiveness as a leader.


 Deanna Troi and Worf Should Have Never Hooked Up 
          

Deanna Troi and Worf were one of the odd couples of the Star Trek universe, proving the cliché that “opposites attract.” Worf was the first Klingon in Starfleet, serving as the tactical officer on the Enterprise. Troi, on the other hand, was the ship’s counselor, using her half-Betazoid abilities to help others deal with their trauma. Out of seemingly nowhere, in the show’s final season, Worf and Troi entered into a relationship. The pairing was never popular with fans, who said it felt forced on the characters. Their affair ended sometime before Worf transferred to Deep Space Nine.

The vision of Worf presented in Star Trek: The Last Generation is shocking. He has no regard for anyone other than his fellow Klingons. Keeping Troi as essentially a slave is a vile act in itself, but Worf’s reason for taking her was horrible as well: he felt a Klingon woman would become uppity and threaten his supremacy. In the Prime timeline, Worf and Troi felt something deep for each other. Even though it did not work out between them, they remain friends—a far cry from The Last Generation.

And this horrifying affair came to a tragic end. Troi had been secretly working for the rebellion, funneling them secrets Worf spilled in bed. Even though this variant of Troi’s life ended with a blade, she did not feel her sacrifice was in vain, and ensured she bruised Worf’s ego before passing. Troi and Worf’s affair in the Prime timeline had its share of struggles, and despite it not working out, they still felt deeply for each other. All traces of love are gone here, replaced by lust and envy. Worf and Troi’s romance failed in the Prime Star Trek timeline, and was volatile in others, leading to cold-blooded murder.
