## Literature Review

Super-siblings Osul-Ra and Otho-Ra are being set up for a conflict between light and darkness, just as Han and Leia&#39;s twins were in pre-Disney canon.





Summary

  Blue Earth kidnaps Otho-Ra in an attempt to turn her against Superman and her family, mirroring Star Wars&#39; conflict between Jacen and Jaina Solo.   Norah Stone is revealed to be Janan al Ghul, who plans to lead Otho astray to the dark side, creating a conflict between the twins.   Superman&#39;s family embracing classic Star Wars tropes hints at a growing conflict within the seemingly idyllic House of El, as Otho is tempted by her darker urges.  







The xenophobic hate group Blue Earth has played their hand, kidnapping Otho-Ra in an attempt to turn her against Superman and the rest of her family. But this isn&#39;t the first time a set of super-powered twins have been split apart and set against each other; Star Wars&#39; forgotten scions of the Force, Jacen and Jaina Solo, are perfect examples of the kind of conflict that Othul-Ra and Osul-Ra now face.

When a super-powered Blue Earth squad uses excessive force against a team of bank robbers in Action Comics #1059 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, and Eber Ferreira, Superman and the rest of his family arrive to stop them. When Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra join the fray, Otho is beset by illusions of Blue Earth&#39;s leader, Norah Stone, telling her that she&#39;s the one Blue Earth really wants.

          




Norah is soon revealed to be Janan al Ghul (Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul&#39;s daughter from the Dark Multiverse), who kidnaps Otho and tells her that &#34;Big, big things are about to happen, kid. And an awful lot of it relies on you.&#34;

                  DC Just Introduced the Perfect Codenames for Superman&#39;s New Sidekicks   Supermanâ€™s newest sidekicks, the Super-Twins, learn about two ancient Kryptonian legends that may inspire their future heroic identities.   


 Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra Are a New Era&#39;s Jacen and Jaina Solo 
          

Before Disney&#39;s acquisition of the Star Wars franchise and the release of The Force Awakens, the Star Wars saga had an extensive canon established through novels, comics, and video games, with two breakout characters being Han and Leia&#39;s twin children: Jacen and Jaina Solo. Powerfully attuned to the Force, the two notably served as the primary protagonists of the 19-book series The New Jedi Order (1999-2003) and the 9-book series Legacy of the Force (2006-2008). Tragically, Jacen Solo is corrupted by the Sith cultist Lumiya, becoming Darth Caedus before ultimately falling at the hands of his sister in a final confrontation.




With Janan al Ghul&#39;s machinations revealed, the parallels between these two sets of twins become distinct. Both Otho and Osul are the scions of the much-beloved Superman and the House of El, with their Kryptonian bloodlines granting them incredible powers. Janan is acting in the role of Star War&#39;s Lumiya, hoping to lead Otho astray to the &#34;dark side&#34; (literally, as Janan originates from DC&#39;s Dark Multiverse); if she is successful, a conflict between the twins would seem all but inevitable, with Osul representing the &#34;light&#34; and Otho representing the &#34;dark.&#34;



 Superman&#39;s Family Can Be The Spiritual Successor To Star Wars&#39; Legends Canon 
          

The expanded Star Wars universe was retconned from existence after Disney acquired the property in 2012, but that continuity remains much beloved to this day. This is why it is so thrilling to see Superman&#39;s family embracing the tropes of these classic stories, hearkening back to the classic Star Wars vibe that Disney has struggled to replicate. It also portends a growing conflict in Superman&#39;s seemingly idyllic family, with Otho being tempted by her darker urges, which the House of El cannot satisfy. Whichever direction Otho-Ra and Osul-Ra&#39;s stories take from here, Superman&#39;s children seem poised to follow in the footsteps of Star Wars&#39; beloved Solo twins.
