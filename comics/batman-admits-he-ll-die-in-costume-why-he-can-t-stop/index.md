# Batman Admits He ll Die in Costume - &amp; Why He Can t Stop


## SUMMARY 



  Batman will never retire, because fighting crime is the only way he can keep his parents&#39; deaths from becoming meaningless, in his trauma-induced conception of things.   Batman can never stop being a hero, because it is through saving people that he remains connected to his parents and avoids facing the reality of their deaths.   Bruce Wayne&#39;s entire life is an act of mourning his parents, and he will always strive to save them, even though they are already gone.

## Literature Review

Batman has been fighting his war on crime for decades; recently, he admitted that no matter how many people he saves, he&#39;ll never be able or to stop.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Detective Comics #1075!




Many readers might assume Batman won&#39;t ever stop fighting crime because Gotham will never be rid of corruption and villainy, but this isn&#39;t true. Batman will fight crime until the day he dies because as long as he does, his parents&#39; deaths still hold meaning – were he to retire, however much good he has done, Thomas and Martha Wayne&#39;s deaths would become just two more gunshots in an alley.

Detective Comics #1075 – by Ram V, Francesco Francavilla, and Ariana Maher – contained the heartbreaking reason Batman will never retire. This issue saw Batman slowly losing his mind, returning to the graves of his parents for solace.



          

At their graves, he hallucinates a conversation between himself and his childhood self, revealing core truths about the Caped Crusader in the process.




 : Batman&#39;s New War for Gotham Redefines His Parents&#39; Legacy


 Bruce Wayne Admits He Can&#39;t Stop, And He Won&#39;t Stop Being Batman 
Detective Comics #1075 , child-Bruce asks his adult self if saving people makes the pain of losing his parents easier, and Bruce admits it doesn&#39;t. Bruce says he can never stop saving people, because if he does, then his parents will truly be dead, and to him it will be as though he never saved anyone at all. Everything Batman does, he does in memory of Martha and Thomas Wayne, and he feels that no matter how many people he saves, he can&#39;t stop. Batman can never do enough good for Bruce, because it is only through action, through the process of doing good in his parents&#39; name, that he remains connected to them.

In Bruce&#39;s conception, the day he retires is the day he has to admit that the good that came out of his parent&#39;s death is over. Batman is Bruce taking something horrible that happened to him as a child and used it to motivate him as a force for good, but if he retires, he&#39;ll just be left with something horrible. By using the pain of that event to do good, Batman can at least avoid facing the reality of what happened to him. Losing his parents was the single worst thing to ever happen in Bruce Wayne&#39;s life. It was also the single defining moment of his existence.






 Batman&#39;s Entire Life Is The Act Of Mourning His Parents 


          

In the ensuing years, Batman has saved countless lives, but it&#39;ll never be enough, because he&#39;ll always be trying to save two people who are already gone. A lot of heroes have tragic backstories, but few are as tragic as Bruce Wayne&#39;s. He had his childhood ripped away from him far too early and instead of turning out to be a monster, he used that pain to become a hero. Bruce used the pain of loss to prevent anyone else from feeling that gutwrenching tragedy; he used it to become Batman. Yet, Bruce admits that if he ever gives up Batman, the only thing he&#39;ll be left with is that pain and loss.
