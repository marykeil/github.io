## Literature Review

Starfire discovers that the Titans’ newest enemy is a blast from her past and someone secretly responsible for the worst moments of her life.




Warning! Preview pages ahead for Titans #7!If the chaos of &#34;Beast World&#34; weren&#39;t enough, a new secret is turning everything fans know about the Titan Starfire&#39;s past on its head. The enigmatic villain Brother Eternity has been revealed to be a Tamaranean just like Koriand&#39;r, and he&#39;s got a dark secret that changes everything about the hero&#39;s life.




In a preview for Titans #7 – by Tom Taylor and Travis Moore – Cyborg and Raven arrive at Titans Tower to find the mind-controlled Garth aka Tempest. Meanwhile, Starfire is dealing with Xand&#39;r, a Tamaranean who has been posing as a reformed Brother Blood. Years before this, however, Xand&#39;r served in Starfire&#39;s family&#39;s royal court on Tamaran.

         

Xand&#39;r reveals that his true allegiance was to his god, the Necrostar and that he conspired with the Dominators and the Citadel to destroy Tamaran. Xand&#39;r ensured that the planet&#39;s rulers were killed and that Starfire was enslaved, all in exchange for a piece of the Necrostar and the knowledge of where it was imprisoned.


 Xand&#39;r is Responsible for Destroying Starfire&#39;s Home World 
          




The Titans knew something was up when their old enemy Brother Blood presented himself as a reformed savior to the world, especially when their former teammate Garth was working with him. Their suspicions turned out to be correct when the villain unleashed the Necrostar, a powerful Star Conqueror from its prison on Saturn&#39;s moon Titan. That event kicked off the chaos of &#34;Beast World&#34;, which ended up with Beast Boy transforming into a Star Conqueror himself. Amid all the chaos, Eternity went after the Titans, intent on killing them save for one in order to retrieve the Necrostar and finish his mission to destroy humanity.

Starfire already had one of the most tragic backstories in Titans&#39; history. The former princess of a dead kingdom, someone who was enslaved at a young age and had their own family turn against them. Koriand&#39;r suffered through a lot, but up until now it was all just assumed to be happenstance. Now Starfire has the name and face of the person responsible for the death of her kingdom and the destruction of her family. To make things worse, not only is Xand&#39;r responsible for destroying Starfire&#39;s past, he&#39;s now putting her future in jeopardy. Even if the Titans resolve &#34;Beast World&#34; peacefully, Starfire&#39;s life on Earth may be over.






 Xand&#39;r Destroyed Starfire&#39;s Old and New Lives 
          

Thankfully, fans know the Titans are going to survive &#34;Beast World&#34;. Unfortunately, they&#39;re going to be taking the heat for the attack thanks to Amanda Waller to advance her anti-metahuman agenda. All of this is happening thanks to Xand&#39;r&#39;s treachery years ago. Had he not betrayed Tamaran&#39;s royal court, he wouldn&#39;t have freed the Necrostar from its prison, preventing Waller from all the awful things she&#39;s done in &#34;Beast World&#34;. But this terrible figure from Starfire&#39;s former life has damned her new one, because once the dust is cleared, the people of Earth are going to blame Koriand&#39;r and her team. Not only has Xand&#39;r ruined the Titan&#39;s past, but he&#39;s also destroyed her future as well.

Titans #7 is on sale January 16th from DC Comics
