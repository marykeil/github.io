  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Garth Ennis saved the Punisher from a supernatural fate and gave him a hard reset, bringing back the street-level vigilantism that fans love.
The opening kill in Ennis&rsquo; run sets the tone for the series, with the Punisher twisting a man&rsquo;s head around 180 degrees.
Ennis wrote the scene that inspired the memorable rooftop chain-gun dilemma in the MCU&rsquo;s Daredevil series, showcasing his influence and impact on the character - and these are just some of the greatest moments from
Punisher
Vol. 5!</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Garth Ennis wrote The Punisher from Vol 5 into Vol 7, with the first 12 issues of Vol 5 being perhaps the most memorable. Here&rsquo;s the 10 best moments!</p>
<p>Many fans are assuredly most familiar with Garth Ennis as the co-creator of The Boys, though some may not know that Ennis also had a fairly long stretch writing the Punisher for Marvel Comics, stretching through the Punisher’s fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes - and any fan of The Boys can only imagine how perfect that combination truly was.
Garth Ennis is incredibly talented at writing scenes and storylines that shock and disgust in the most badass ways imaginable, and a number of them were so impactful, that they went on to inspire future iterations and adaptations. Here are the 10 most unforgettable moments from Garth Ennis’ original Punisher run!</p>
<p>Every Version of the Punisher in Marvel Lore (Ranked Weakest to Strongest)
Joe Garrison may be replacing Frank Castle, but he isn&rsquo;t the first new Punisher. Here&rsquo;s every Punisher, ranked from mostly harmless to most lethal.</p>
<p>10  Garth Ennis Brought The Punisher Back From Being A Worse ‘Ghost Rider’
Punisher Vol. 4 #4 by Tom Sniegoski, Christopher Golden, and Bernie Wrightson vs Punisher Vol. 5 #1 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>Garth Ennis began his run on the Punisher at the start of the series’ fifth volume, and one of the greatest hurdles Ennis’ run overcame - and one of its most impactful feats - was undoing what was done to the Punisher in the previous volume. In Punisher Vol. 4 #1-4, the Punisher was granted supernatural abilities from literal angels, abilities that he used to battle demons. The Punisher was even rebranded during volume 4, as he wasn’t a dealer of punishment or vengeance anymore, but redemption, telling his victims to “pray” before he struck them down with righteous glory. Obviously, that sucked, and was essentially just a worse version of Ghost Rider.
Garth Ennis saved the Punisher from this fate, and he did so mostly by just ignoring it. Ennis did a quick wrap-up in the opening issue, but aside from that, he just gave the Punisher a hard reset. Other writers might have committed an entire arc to undoing what was done, but that’s not why someone buys a Punisher comic, and Ennis knew that, as he promptly threw fans back into the cruel, street-level vigilantism the Punisher brings to the Marvel Universe.</p>
<p>9  The Punisher Twisted His Victim’s Head Completely Around In A Shocking Opening Kill
Punisher Vol. 5 #1 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>A series rooted in violence like The Punisher is arguably only as good as its opening kill, as that’s the one that sets the tone for the rest of the series while also usually being immensely important to the storyline that’s to come - and Ennis’ opening kill does both. After the Punisher is killing drug suppliers and dealers during a large shipment deal, he gives one guy a chance to turn his life around before leaving. When it becomes clear that this person will not turn his life around (indeed, he was already making deals to sell the leftover product), the Punisher grabs his head and twists it around a full 180 degrees.
The sight of a person’s head being twisted completely around is truly one to behold, and definitely one readers won’t forget anytime soon, especially given that this one was the opening kill of an all-new run.</p>
<p>8  The Punisher Created His Own Martial Arts Technique: ‘Splat-Fu’
Punisher Vol. 5 #2 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>While this was admittedly more of a cheeky joke than a legitimate testament to the Punisher’s unparalleled fighting ability, ‘Splat-Fu’ did prove to be a truly effective method of killing someone who is also skilled in martial arts combat. In this issue, the Punisher’s target is a master martial artist assassin, so rather than fight him, the Punisher follows him into the subway, and pushes him onto the tracks.
The Punisher calls this technique Splat-Fu in a dark lightheartedness that’s sure to stick with readers in the form of a morbid chuckle.</p>
<p>7  Garth Ennis Wrote The Scene That Inspired One Of The Best Moments In MCU’s Daredevil
Punisher Vol. 5 #3 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>One of the best moments from the 2015 Netflix-turned-MCU series Daredevil was in season 2, when Daredevil finds himself chained to a New York City rooftop with a gun taped to his hand and a simple choice presented to him by the Punisher: either Daredevil kills him, or Frank kills a criminal. This crisis of conscience was the ultimate test for someone like Daredevil, who tries to maintain a moral code despite fighting against the worst criminals one can imagine. The Punisher attempts to break him of that, and this scene is his way of doing it - a scene that originated in Garth Ennis’ run.
The legacy of this scene - which is almost a shot-for-shot adaptation from the comic to the show - obviously speaks for itself, as it was immortalized in both Marvel Comics and the MCU.</p>
<p>6  The Punisher Used An Entire Zoo As A Weapon (&amp; Punched A Polar Bear In The Face)
Punisher Vol. 5 #4 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>When being pursued by a gang of mobsters, the Punisher leads them into a zoo, where he proceeds to use a number of different animals to kill each of the villains one-by-one. One guy gets eaten down to the bone by a school of piranhas, another is constricted to death by a giant python, and the rest are eaten by polar bears (including their boss, who actually survives this particular ordeal).
Not only does the Punisher kill these people with an entire zoo, but he also punches one of the polar bears in the face before turning them on the rest of the mobsters, which is arguably just as memorable as the passive murders he orchestrated.</p>
<p>5  Garth Ennis Gave Fans One Of Marvel’s Coolest Fights: The Punisher vs The Russian
Punisher Vol. 5 #10 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>The Punisher has fought some very formidable opponents in his day - from Asgardian monsters to even Spider-Man himself - but none of them could match the Russian, who was an enforcer called in only under the most extreme circumstances. The Russian is capable of killing an entire squad of elite soldiers like it’s nothing, he barely feels pain, he laughs at a gut-stab, and can literally crush other humans with his bare hands.
The Punisher nearly died fighting the Russian, and for good reason, as he was one of the most badass (albeit short-lived) villains in the Punisher’s cadre.</p>
<p>4  Garth Ennis Created An Original Team In Marvel Comics: The Vigilante Squad
Punisher Vol. 5 #11 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>Most of the time, when a writer takes over a run for an iconic Marvel Comics character, they usually just play with the characters who have already been established - Marvel does have quite a large sandbox, after all. However, Garth Ennis decided to add to this universe a bit with the creation of an all-new team of ‘crime-fighters’: the Vigilante Squad. The squad had three members: the Holy, Elite, and Mr. Payback. The Holy was a serial killer priest who murdered those who confessed their sins to him, as he believed he was tasked by God to do so. Elite was a wealthy white man who was only interested in killing people he deemed lesser than himself (which, as one could imagine, was almost exclusively racially motivated). Mr. Payback was the closest to the Punisher out of all of them, but his lack of planning while killing criminals resulted in a number of innocent casualties, and he didn’t seem to care one bit.
In true Garth Ennis fashion, they were all horribly despicable and corrupt in the worst ways imaginable, and the Punisher promptly killed all three members by the end of the run after they approached him about being their leader. However, just because they were short-lived, doesn’t detract from the significance of their inclusion, as it’s not every day that new characters are included in Marvel Comics, and Garth Ennis pulled it off brilliantly.</p>
<p>3  The Punisher Scares A Squad Of Mob Enforcers In The Series’ Most Iconic ‘Nope’ Moment
Punisher Vol. 5 #11 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>This entire run is about a mob family trying to kill the Punisher by any means necessary, and so, when the Punisher literally shows up at their doorstep, a small army of enforcers goes out to meet him. However, the Punisher isn’t alone, as he also brought the severed head of the Russian, whose reputation was arguably even more infamous than the Punisher’s - and there he was, dead by the Punisher’s hand.
One look at this and every mobster knew they were going to die if they fought the Punisher, so they all dropped their guns and walked away in what was perhaps the most memorable ‘nope’ moment in comic book fiction.</p>
<p>2  Garth Ennis Made The Punisher’s Ma Gnucci Suffer To An Absurd Degree
Punisher Vol. 5 #12 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>Ma Gnucci is the main villain of this entire run, and she committed some truly vile atrocities to earn that title, though it’s fair to say that Garth Ennis made her pay for all her crimes and then some by the end of the story. Ma Gnucci was the boss who survived getting mauled by polar bears, though she did lose her arms and legs in the process, and existed in a state of perpetual agony for what little remained of her life. Then, when the Punisher got his hands on her in the final issue, he literally kicked her like a soccer ball into a blazing house fire, where she slowly burned to death with no chance of escape.
The level of suffering brought down upon this character was laughably extreme, and definitely one of the more memorable parts of this particular run.</p>
<p>1  The Entirety of Garth Ennis’ Punisher Vol. 5 Inspired The Fan-Favorite 2004 Film
Punisher Vol. 5 #1-12 by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon</p>
<p>Garth Ennis’ The Punisher Vol. 5 ran from 2000 to 2001, and only a few years later, basically the entire thing was adapted into the 2004 Punisher film. The comic started with the death of the mob boss’ son (the guy whose head was twisted), which sparked their wrath against the Punisher, which is the exact same overarching plot in the movie. Then, the Punisher moves into a dilapidated apartment with three characters named Dave, Bumpo, and Joan in the comic, which is the exact same thing that happens in the movie. Then, the mob hires the Russian to kill the Punisher, which is what happens in the movie. Then, the Punisher kills the mob boss with fire after dismantling their entire organization, which is what happens in the movie.
This isn’t to say anything bad or critical of the 2004 film, far from it, actually. The fact that a specific run of a comic can influence an adaptation so heavily is indicative of how iconic the original comic run truly is, and there are few Punisher series that are more memorable than Garth Ennis’ original twelve-issue run, and these 10 unforgettable moments prove it.</p>
