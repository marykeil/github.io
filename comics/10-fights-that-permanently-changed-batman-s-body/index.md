## Literature Review

Batman has been fighting criminals for decades, and in that time he&#39;s taken some pretty nasty hits that have left permanent scars on his body.




Fighting Gotham City&#39;s criminals night after night for decades has taken a toll on Batman&#39;s body. Despite how skilled a fighter Batman is, even he can&#39;t come out of his nightly scraps entirely untouched. Over the years, Batman has suffered dozens of different kinds of injuries that have left their permanent mark on his body in one way or another.
From broken bones to scars to lost limbs, the physical injuries that Batman has endured would lead a lesser hero to give up his crusade. Yet despite these incredible injuries, Batman still goes out night after night to face criminals and protect the weak. It&#39;s a testament to the Dark Knight&#39;s strength and determination. These are the top ten injuries that Batman has sustained in his fight against crime.









 








 10  Catwoman Slashes Batman&#39;s Chest 
Batman&#39;s Greatest Love Leaves Her Mark On Him
        

One of the more complicated relationships that Batman has had has been with Catwoman. The two are often allies, sometimes lovers, and sometimes enemies. Recently in the comics, Batman and Catwoman have found themselves at odds, engaging in one of their biggest conflicts in years. The two have traded blows several times over the years, a fact that&#39;s been touched on with one consistent set of scars Batman has that come from Catwoman. These scars across his chest have been referenced several times through comics, appearing in both Batman: Hush by Jeph Loeb, Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Alex Sinclair, and Richard Starkings as well as in Batman: Three Jokers.





 9  Croc Knocks Out Batman&#39;s Teeth 
Bruce Wayne Has To Explain Away His Injuries

        

Batman puts a tremendous amount of effort into keeping up appearances as the perfect handsome playboy Bruce Wayne. This can be a very difficult ruse to maintain when he keeps getting injured as Batman. He often tries to explain this away as various skiing trips or car races gone bad, but it&#39;s difficult to be the handsome playboy while missing teeth. In Batman: Killing Time #1 by Tom King, David Marquez, Alejandro Sanchez, and Clayton Cowles, Batman battles Killer Croc for one of the first times in his career, and almost immediately has two of his teeth knocked out, while Batman manages to knock out 13 of Croc&#39;s.





 8  Batman Becomes Immune To Fear Toxin 
He&#39;s Been Exposed So Many Times It Has No Effect

        

The majority of Tom King&#39;s run on Batman involves the long battle between Batman and Bane. One of the many things Bane does to try and break Batman is trapping him in a nightmare, pumping Scarecrow&#39;s fear toxin into Bruce to keep him in a state of terrifying dreams. Eventually, Batman is able to break out of this, as seen in Batman #70 by Tom King, Mikel Janin, Jorge Fornes, Jordie Bellaire, and Clayton Cowles. Part of how Batman breaks out is the fact that, after spending so much time in Scarecrow&#39;s nightmare, it seems Batman has become immune to fear toxin.





 7  Batman Bathes In Dionseium 
Batman&#39;s Mind Is Wiped Clean

        

A major climax of the decades-long battle between Batman and the Joker takes place in Batman: Endgame by Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, Danny Miki, FCO Plascencia, and Steve Wands. This story sees Batman and the Joker duking it out with each other in a collapsing cave network. This cave is home to a pool of Dionseium, a chemical that grants rapid regeneration that Joker has been using. While it appears the two die together in the cave-in, it&#39;s later revealed that Batman&#39;s body fell into the Dionseium along with Joker, returning both of their bodies to prime condition, while also giving them a case of amnesia.





 6  Blinded By Acid 
An Attempt To Help Two-Face Backfires

        

During the events of All-Star Batman, Bruce has to get Two-Face across America in order to cure him. Two-Face has been growing in power and becoming more and more dangerous, but when Harvey Dent reaches out to Batman for help, Batman has no choice but to try. This results in Batman trying to get Two-Face to the site of a possible cure, while dozens of villains try to kill Two-Face for his growing power, and Two-Face tries to escape Batman to prevent being erased by this cure. It&#39;s in one of these scuffles that Two-Face manages to pour acid into Batman&#39;s eyes, brutally temporarily blinding him. This is all seen in All-Star Batman #4 by Scott Snyder, John Romita Jr, Danny Miki, Dead White, and Steve Wands.





 5  Given Cancer By Dr. Phosphorus 
Batman&#39;s Years Of Being Doused In Chemicals Comes Back To Haunt Him

        

Batman has been doused with an unbelievable amount of chemicals in his time fighting crime. Joker Venom, Fear Toxin, Venom, the list goes on and on. But the one criminal that really got Batman once and for all was Dr. Phosphorus, as seen in Detective Comics #1027 story Legacy by Tom King, Walter Simonson, Laura Martin, and John Workman. This story details one of the final confrontations between Batman and Dr. Phosphorus and shows that Batman would ultimately be killed by Dr. Phosphorus due to him giving Batman cancer.





 4  Traumatic Brain Injury 
Swinging Above Gotham City Is Truly Dangerous

        

During the events of Batman #609 by Jeph Loeb, Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Alex Sinclair, and Richard Starkings, Batman is chasing Catwoman after she has stolen something. Running and jumping from the rooftops of Gotham City, Batman leaps from a building and tosses out his grapple hook, only for someone to cut the line. Batman then falls several stories and Batman plummets down into Crime Alley. He lands so hard that he cracks his skull and suffers a traumatic brain injury, needing to rely on skilled surgeon Thomas Elliot to perform emergency surgery and save his life. While Batman does recover from the injury, it&#39;s not the kind of thing that ever truly goes away.





 3  Batman Is Infected With Joker Toxin 
Batman Must Become His Greatest Enemy

        

The Batman Who Laughs, a terrifying combination of both Batman and the Joker, is one of the most dangerous villains to terrorize the DC Universe. When the Batman Who Laughs is on the loose in Gotham City, Bruce does everything he can to track him down and stop him, but ultimately, he isn&#39;t able to keep up with a Joker that has the mind of a Batman. Because of this, the Joker infects Batman with the same toxin that created the Batman Who Laughed, claiming that the only way Batman can beat him is by becoming him. Bruce begins dosing himself with tons of Joker Anti-Venom to stave off the transformation, but the ending of the comic strongly implies Joker&#39;s influence lingers on, even after Bruce takes the cure.





 2  Bane Breaks The Bat 
One Of Batman&#39;s Most Brutal Injuries Is Iconic

        

An absolutely iconic event in Batman&#39;s history is the Knightfall crossover, which ends with Bane breaking Batman&#39;s back in Batman #497 by Doug Moench, Jim Aparo, Dick Giordano, Adrienne Roy, and Richard Starkings. This is one of the first major defeats that Batman ever suffers, especially since it happens in the Batcave. Batman has every home field advantage and Bane still breaks the Bat with no issue. This event forces Bruce to temporarily retire from being Batman, needing Jean-Paul Valley, and later Dick Grayson, to take over the mantle. But as brutal as this defeat is, Batman does heal and return to the role, with minor changes to his abilities.





 1  Ghost-Breaker Cuts Off Batman&#39;s Hand 
A Multiversal Journey Leaves A Permanent Mark On Batman

        

Ghost-Maker is one of Batman&#39;s friends in the main DC Universe, but when Bruce travles to a world without Batman, the man known as Ghost-Breaker is one of his biggest obstacles. While trying to pull a switch to shut down the villain Darwin Halliday&#39;s evil plan, Ghost-Breaker manages to cut off Bruce&#39;s hand. While Bruce does succeed at pulling the switch, and immediately knocks Ghost-Breaker out afterward, the loss of his hand is one of the biggest physical injuries Batman has ever suffered, as seen in Batman #134 by Chip Zdarsky, Mike Hawthorne, Adriano Di Benedetto, Tomeu Morey, and Clayton Cowles. Batman does have a new mechanical hand to make up for his missing one, but there&#39;s still no denying that this is by far the worst injury that has had the longest effect on Batman so far.
