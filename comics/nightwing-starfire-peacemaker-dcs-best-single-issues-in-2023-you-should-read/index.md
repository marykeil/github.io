## Literature Review

From Peacemaker getting a happy ending to fans seeing the world through Nightwing’s eyes, find out the best single issues released by DC in 2023.




There were a lot of amazing single issues put out by DC Comics in 2023. From the new series published under the Dawn of DC initiative to the exciting comics carrying the Black Label brand, DC had plenty of great stories. While many individual books were published as part of a larger story, some single issues are so great they’re worthy of extra attention. Read on to discover DC Comics&#39; best single issues in 2023.









 








 15  Peacemaker Finally Got the Ending He Deserves 
Peacemaker Tries Hard! #6, Kyle Starks, Steve Pugh
        

Peacemaker Tries Hard! was a Black Label series that followed Christopher Smith as he went on an adventure to rescue his pet (an adorable dog he named Bruce Wayne). The comic examined the tragedy of Peacemaker’s inability to bond or socialize with others. Everything came full circle for the hero at the end when Smith’s associate, the Golden Age hero Red Bee, sacrificed himself to save Smith. That one act of love gave Smith the clarity he needed to understand friendship, allowing him to end the series on a positive note, with a collection of friends and family.





 14  Starfire Took Center Stage in a Fantastic Character Study 
Tales of the Titans #1, Shannon Hale, Dean Hale, Javier Rodriguez
        

2023 was a year that the Titans stepped up and got the focus they deserved. Tales of the Titans gave the focus to the team’s heroes who weren’t anchoring books at the time. The miniseries’ first issue put Starfire in the starring role and saw her assist two wayward Tamaraneans back to their colony. The issue was a fascinating character examination into Starfire’s psychology, examining what being the princess of a dead empire means to her and what it&#39;s like for her to carry such passionate emotions.





 13  Ra&#39;s al Ghul Achieved His Finest Victory 
Batman: One Bad Day - Ra&#39;s al Ghul #1, Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis
        

Batman: One Bad Day – Ra’s al Ghul #1 saw the Dark Knight’s enemy embark on his most ambitious crusade yet. Ra’s had numerous CEOs of the worst polluting corporations replaced with puppets that he could control, all of whom began taking steps to undo the damage ecological damage. Unlike other Batman stories, this one-shot ended with al Ghul succeeding in his work, actively making the world a better place in the process. The event really challenged Batman, who carried Ra’s dark secret, knowing that exposing what al Ghul had done would only endanger the progress he’d made.





 12  The Doom Patrol Showed What Was on Their Minds 
Unstoppable Doom Patrol #4, Dennis Culver, Darko Lufeunte
        

Unstoppable Doom Patrol #4 was the midpoint of the exciting new miniseries. But rather than see the World’s Strangest Heroes in battle, it featured the Doom Patrol’s members taking time to talk to their resident psychiatrist, Dr. Synco, aka Jerry. The team’s newest members got to elaborate more on their tragic backstories while the more seasoned members dug into their particular foibles and developments. Despite the lack of action, it was a highly engaging read that gave readers insights into where each member of the Doom Patrol was at during this new phase in their lives.





 11  Batgirls&#39; Best Story Showed the Strength of Silence 
Batgirls #14, Becky Cloonan, Michael W. Conrad, Jonathan Case
        

Silence is golden and nothing proves that more than Batgirls’ fourteenth issue. Stephanie Brown is missing and Cassandra Cain spends the entire issue tracking her down. There is no dialogue featured in this story, which is told nearly through Cass’ actions alone. The only time any writing pops up is in a letter that Stephanie left behind for Cass which details her feelings for her close friend. It’s a poignant and touching issue that really stands out from the rest of Batgirls’ issues.





 10  Joker&#39;s Worst Fears Came to Light (And They Were Hilarious) 
Knight Terrors: The Joker #1, Matthew Rosenberg, Stefano Raffaele


 







DC’s summer event Knight Terrors massively affected the publisher’s output for July and August. Many titles were delayed, and one-shots gave fans a look at what DC’s greatest heroes and villains’ worst nightmares were. But what was the Joker’s biggest fear? As Knight Terrors: The Joker #1 revealed, it&#39;s working a 9 to 5 job, which he took on after accidentally killing Batman. The issue turned the central idea of Knight Terrors on its head by having the Joker be petrified of something so unbelievably boring. That said, the Joker’s dreams still managed to be extremely disturbing.





 9  Robin and Supergirl&#39;s Date Was Comically Awful 
Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #12, Mark Waid, Emanuela Lupacchino
        

Batman/Superman: World’s Finest had teased a tense event in the past between Robin and Supergirl, and the series&#39; twelfth issue finally revealed what happened: Dick Grayson and Kara Zor-El went on the date from Hell. Between awkward conversations, accidentally rude comments, and a local man’s missing monkey accidentally causing a truck full of bowling balls to crash, a successful romantic encounter just wasn’t in the cards for the Boy Wonder and the Girl of Steel. It was a painful and cringey read, but also quite humorous seeing these two DC icons utterly fail at something so simple.





 8  Wonder Woman vs. The Birds of Prey Was DC&#39;s Most Thrilling Fight 
Birds of Prey #4, Kelly Thompson, Leonardo Romero
        

The newly revamped Birds of Prey came together to fight the most unexpected opponent in this issue: Wonder Woman! Zealot, Black Canary, Batgirl, and Big Barda all go up against the most feared Amazon warrior in a fight scene expertly drawn by Leonardo Romero. One by one, the Birds of Prey fight Diana, who expertly disarms and defeats each one. But Big Barda gets at least one good shot in when she takes a page out of Bane’s book and attempts to break Wonder Woman’s back.





 7  Green Lantern Exposed Real-Life Horrors 
Alan Scott: The Green Lantern #2, Tim Sheridan, Cian Tormey
        

The Golden Age hero’s secret history is tragically explored in Alan Scott: The Green Lantern #2. After losing his lover, Alan checks himself into Arkham Asylum where the psychiatrists attempt to ‘cure’ him of his same-sex desires. The issue is horrifyingly true to life as Alan experiences electroconvulsive therapy against his will (and that’s to say nothing of the treatment his transgender friend Billie receives in Arkham). Though Scott’s time in the Asylum is brief, it’s disturbing to see anyone go through such things.





 6  Superman and Lex Luthor&#39;s Relationship Was Properly Examined 
Superman: The Last Days of Lex Luthor #1, Mark Waid, Bryan Hitch
        

The relationship between Superman and Lex Luthor is a complicated one, and no comic showed that better than Superman: The Last Days of Lex Luthor #1. The Man of Steel’s nemesis is dying and has no choice but to turn to Superman for assistance. As Clark struggles to find a way to save Lex’s life, he keeps thinking back to their shared childhood in Smallville, wondering if he could have done anything to save Lex. It’s a candid and honest look at the complexities of relationships and reveals the real tragedy hidden in Superman and Lex&#39;s antagonistic relationship.





 5  Multiple Batmen United Across the Multiverse 
Batman #135, Chip Zdarsky, Mikel Janin, Jorge Jimenez, Mike Hawthorne


 







Batman #135 (or Batman #900 as the legacy numbering has it) is the culmination of “The Bat-Man of Gotham” storyline and sees Batman face off with his new enemy Red Mask. The villain runs all across the DC multiverse, traveling to worlds, creating new Jokers or resurrecting old ones. This issue is a real treat for Batman fans as it sees Bruce meet some of his most infamous variants like media such as the Arkham games. Batman even gets new gadgets like a robotic prosthetic hand or, thanks to Batman ‘66, anti-shark repellent spray.





 4  Readers Got to Step into Nightwing&#39;s Shoes for a Day 
Nightwing #105, Tom Taylor, Bruno Redondo
        

Nightwing’s creative team of Tom Taylor and Bruno Redondo have experimented with the medium before but took it to a new level with the book&#39;s 105th issue. The story sees Nightwing and Batgirl running through the city as they get caught up in a plan masterminded by an evil pharmaceutical manufacturer. The real joy of the issue is that the story is told entirely from Nightwing’s POV. It’s a fun, creative endeavor that pushes the boundaries of standard superhero storytelling.





 3  Poison Ivy Finally Reunited With Harley Quinn 
Poison Ivy #9, G. Willow Wilson, Marcio Takara
        

Poison Ivy detailed the notorious Batman rogue’s journey of self-discovery after she and her girlfriend Harley Quinn took some time apart. But fans everywhere were overjoyed when love shined through with the series’ ninth issue. Harley surprises Ivy and it doesn’t take but seconds for the two to embrace and pick up exactly where they left off. Many readers missed seeing Harlivy together, and this issue gave those readers exactly what they wanted.





 2  Wonder Woman Helped Someone Who Truly Needed Her 
Wonder Woman #4, Tom King, Daniel Sampere
        

For the most part, the new Wonder Woman series focused on the Amazons being outlawed by the United States government. But the series&#39; fourth issue has Diana take a break from that to make a terminally ill young man’s dream come true by spending the day with him. Wonder Woman takes a boy named Jack to Paradise Island and gives him the best day possible. There are no huge battles or shocking story developments. But seeing Wonder Woman comfort a child in need reminds readers of the type of hero she really is.





 1  Batman&#39;s Darkest Story Had Its Strongest Opening Ever 
Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #1, Rafael Grampa


 







2023 had no short supply of Batman stories, but Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #1 raised the bar considerably. Set in its own continuity, the series takes place in a much worse version of Gotham. As such, its Batman is going all in to save his city’s soul with his most ambitious plan yet: Killing his alter ego and living as Batman full time. The issue is written and drawn by Rafael Grampa, who flexes hard in this introductory issue. Even the most seasoned of Batman readers will be floored by what they read here and desperate to know what comes next.
There were plenty of amazing single issues released by DC Comics in the past year, but these 15 stand out as the &#39;must reads&#39; of 2023.
