## Literature Review

The cast of G.I. Joe continues to fill out in Skybound&#39;s new Energon Universe continuity, and now three classic Joes have entered the fray.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Duke #4G.I. Joe is in the midst of a reboot as a part of Skybound Entertainment’s Energon Universe, with the release of the all-new Duke and Cobra Commander series rebooting the franchise for a bold new era. Now, the cover for next March’s Duke #4 has just revealed three classic characters who will be joining the fray, as the new continuity begins building out the universe with franchise favorites.




Duke #4 continues Conrad “Duke” Hauser’s quest to uncover the truth behind the mysterious alien robots he first encountered in Transformers #2. The issue sees Duke go AWOL in his search for answers after his brutal encounter with the Decepticon Starscream.

 Duke #4                 Release Date:  March 27th, 2024    Writer:  Joshua Williamson    Artist:  Tom Reilly    Colorist:  Jordie Bellaire   Duke is close to discovering the truth about the alien robots that have landed on Earth. But who—or what—is M.A.R.S.?   



The cover for issue #4 by Tom Reilly and Jordie Bellaire sees Duke leading a team of Joes into battle. The previously announced Stalker and Baroness are there, but the cover also features the surprising first look at classic Joe member Rock ’n Roll.

It’s an intriguing cover, and one that will likely excite longtime G.I. Joe fans. In a world where the G.I. Joe and Cobra organizations have yet to be formed, it’s surprising to see long-time villain Baroness working alongside Duke in the new continuity. Of course, it’s likely that Anastasia DeCobray has her own agenda, and it&#39;s certainly guaranteed she’ll eventually switch sides when it suits her needs. Stalker is also a strong addition to the cast, as the character has been a stalwart of the franchise since the beginning of the Real American Hero line that kicked things off all the way back in 1982. Most exciting is the heretofore unannounced Rock ’n Roll, the longtime Joe machine gunner who also appeared in the very first line of action figures.




The character seen riding with the Baroness on her motorcycle is a little harder to figure out, as there are more than a few Joes who are dark-haired and bearded. Given that Stalker and Rock ’n Roll were a part of the initial wave of action figures released in 1982, it can be assumed this character is also from that original line-up, with the most likely possibilities being Breaker or Clutch. Either character would be a strong addition to the cast. Breaker is a communications specialist who can speak seven different languages and is known for constantly chewing bubblegum. Clutch is the Joes’ resident driver and mechanic, who also moonlights as a race car driver on the indie circuit.



 G.I. Joe&#39;s New Continuity Is Still Missing Several Fan Favorites 
          

Whoever the dark-haired, bearded Joe on the cover of Duke #4 winds up being, one thing’s for sure: the upcoming Duke and Cobra Commander miniseries will be packed with guest stars galore, as Skybound and the creators fill out the world of the new G.I. Joe continuity. How long will it be before fan favorites like Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow and Beach Head make their Energon Universe debut? Fans will have to keep reading Skybound’s new G.I. Joe titles to find out.
