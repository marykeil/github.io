## Literature Review

There&#39;s one character in Dragon Ball Super who would be the best ultimate opponent, and it&#39;s perfectly fitting with the story to make it so.


Summary

  Goku and Vegeta may be being groomed as successors to Beerus, and could face a final test by battling their master, Whis.   A battle with Whis would put Goku&#39;s abilities to the test and reveal the true extent of Whis&#39;s power.   While Goku may not become the next Destroyer, a match-up with Whis would represent the culmination of Goku&#39;s training and allow him to finally defeat one of his masters.  





Dragon Ball Super has introduced a number of powerful new fighters to the franchise, and it generated the question of who could be Goku and Vegeta&#39;s ultimate opponent, considering the incredible level of power they are reaching. The character that would best fit that description, of course, would be none other than Beerus&#39;s Angel attendant and his own teacher, Whis.




Goku has already clashed with Beerus himself in the Dragon Ball Super anime and the Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods film, and while it wasn&#39;t a victory for the Saiyan, he more than held his own, and has advanced so much since then that a rematch in the future would likely go very differently. Much of Goku&#39;s growth as a fighter throughout Super has been thanks to the training of Whis, who has taught Goku to fight in ways that he never would&#39;ve even considered prior.

          

As Goku&#39;s latest master, it would also be appropriate for Whis to represent Goku&#39;s final challenge within the series. The question that remains to be answered is how Whis could turn from a neutral angel into a villain - or if Whis needs to be a true villain to be the final opponent at all.

Whis&#39;s role as an angel attendant is not only to serve Beerus, but to guide and instruct him, and part of that includes helping him to pick out a successor when that time comes. Many fans have speculated that Goku and/or Vegeta are likely being groomed for the role, hence why they&#39;re allowed to train with Whis on Beerus&#39;s planet so frequently. If it&#39;s true that Goku and Vegeta are being considered for the next Destroyer, then it&#39;s only logical that there might be some form of final test to prove that they&#39;re ready to take on such an important mantle. What better challenge could there be than battling their own master, putting their skills to the test against Whis directly?




Aside from making sense within the context of the Destroyer theory, Whis being Goku&#39;s ultimate opponent also makes sense within the broader history of the series. Back in Dragon Ball, when Goku was still a kid training under Master Roshi, Roshi challenged him in disguise under the name of &#34;Jackie Chun,&#34; marking what would be the culmination of his training. Goku never had the chance to defeat &#34;Jackie Chun,&#34; losing the match by a hair, but it establishes a precedent for Goku fighting his master at the end of an arc. An all-out battle with Whis would not only put present-day Goku&#39;s abilities to the test, but would also allow Whis to reveal the true extent of his own abilities.

Of course, even if such a match between Goku and Whis took place, that&#39;s no guarantee that Goku would become the next Destroyer (or Angel); that kind of responsibility is a poor fit for Goku, after all. Knowing how powerful Whis is, Goku no doubt dreams of the day when he can see the Angel&#39;s full power on display, so he might accept such a challenge if only for the opportunity to finally fight Whis for real. For Whis, such a day might represent the culmination of everything he&#39;s worked for: training a mortal to the level of defeating a divine being. Goku versus Whis makes a lot of sense as Dragon Ball Super&#39;s final battle, showcasing everything Goku has accomplished throughout the series and finally allowing him to best his master, in a way he wasn&#39;t allowed to before.
