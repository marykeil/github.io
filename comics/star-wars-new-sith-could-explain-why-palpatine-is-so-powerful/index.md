# Star Wars  New Sith Could Explain Why Palpatine Is So Powerful


## SUMMARY 



  Palpatine may be able to harness the emotions of others, as has been teased with Star Wars&#39; new Rogue Sith.   This ability could explain Palpatine&#39;s power and frequent lack of negative emotions such as rage and fear.   The upcoming Star Wars #42 will soon reveal more about Palpatine and the Rogue Sith and the dark side ability that may share.

## Literature Review

Star Wars is about to debut a brand-new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34;, one who may help explain the full extent of Emperor Palptine&#39;s power in the dark side.




Star Wars&#39; brand-new Sith lord may help explain the true power of Emperor Palpatine. As seen across the Star Wars timeline, Palpatine has always been in control, whether it was manipulating events from the shadows or ruling his Empire outright as seen in the original trilogy of films. Keeping that in mind, the imminent debut of a new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; may shed new light on Palpatine&#39;s full power over the dark side and where his control truly comes from.




Having been teased in Charles Soule and Madibek Musabekov&#39;s Star Wars #35, Luke Skywalker is about to encounter a new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; in the upcoming Star Wars #42 whose spirit is seemingly trapped within a piece of red kyber currently in Luke&#39;s possession. Having entered this Sith lord&#39;s metaphysical hall when he tried to connect and heal the bleeding kyber in Star Wars #35, Luke was told by this &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; that the emotions typically associated with the dark side were absent.

          

Essentially, Star Wars #35 has teased that this new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; may be capable of harnessing the rage, pain, hate, and suffering of others, rather than personally feeling and experiencing these often corruptive emotions. To that end, this could be an ability Emperor Palpatine has long used across the Star Wars timeline as well.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Palpatine Can Likely Harness The Emotions Of Others Too 
It Would Explain A Lot
          

While emotions such as hate and rage offer Force-users access to the dark side and all its great power, the emotions themselves are compromising by nature. They constantly threaten to overwhelm and take over rather than being focused toward one&#39;s goals. Case in point, Darth Vader frequently struggled with his own self-hatred as well as the hatred Vader carried for Palpatine himself.

Conversely, Emperor Palpatine explicitly confirmed in recent issues of Marvel&#39;s canonical Darth Vader series that he in fact thrived on his apprentice&#39;s hate for him as well as the hate of others. As such, it&#39;s possible that Palpatine can also harness the emotions of others as is being teased with this new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34;. While most Sith were strong due to their vast amounts of hate and rage, Palpatine rarely seems even irritated in the Star Wars canon. He&#39;s patient, he gets most of what he wants, and isn&#39;t often under threat to create fear. As such, it may be because he&#39;s instead fueled by emotions that aren&#39;t inherently his own.






 Star Wars&#39; New Sith Can Reveal Secrets Of The Dark Side 
Do The Rogue Sith and Palpatine Share The Same Abilities?
          

If Palpatine does indeed literally derive his power in the dark side from the hate and fear of others, it would explain how he&#39;s so incredibly powerful. By creating the Empire, Palpatine essentially got the entire galaxy to hate and fear him, giving him a never-ending power source (not to mention Palpatine&#39;s corruption of the Chosen One). While this is likely the case, it will be very exciting to see what can be learned and confirmed through this new &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; when they soon face Luke Skywalker in Mavel&#39;s canon Star Wars series.

Star Wars #42 is set to release on January 10th from Marvel Comics.
