Warning! Contains spoilers for Nightwing #109!




Nightwing&#39;s latest feat proves that he could potentially be a member of the Green Lantern Corps some day. One of the biggest parts of being a superhero is the ability to overcome great fear. Fighting against supervillains and saving lives every day can be a terrifying experience, and heroes constantly need to fight through this fear to save people. When heroes go a step beyond and prove themselves truly fearless, like Nightwing just has, they show that they&#39;re worth of wielding a Green Lantern ring.

Nightwing is able to overcome great fear in Nightwing #109 by Tom Taylor, Stephen Byrne, Adriano Lucas, and Wes Abbott. After Bea Bennett is stabbed in front of him and tossed into the ocean, Nightwing steps up to jump in after her.



          

This is a major moment for Nightwing, since, while jumping into certain danger is usually an extremely easy feat for Nightwing, lately he&#39;s been completely paralyzed by fear anytime he tries to jump into action. But the fact he&#39;s able to overcome this fear and still jump in after her proves that he&#39;s not just a true hero, but he&#39;s also ready to be a Green Lantern.




                  DC&#39;s Deadliest Green Lantern Is the Protégé of a Major Gotham Villain   The Green Lantern Corps is made up of thousands of sentient beings from different backgrounds, but one surprise Corps member has a very lethal origin.   


 Nightwing Overcomes His Fear To Save Bea Bennett 


          



Dick Grayson grew up in the circus and has been leaping off of tall things and doing death-defying stunts since before he was 12 years old. As such, he&#39;s certainly no stranger to fear. Nightwing is even immune to Scarecrow&#39;s fear toxin, that&#39;s how much experience Nightwing has had with fear. Yet despite all of this, recently Nightwing has begun having moments of fear that completely paralyze him. There have been several times when Nightwing has failed to leap into action now because of this random fear. But he manages to overcome this fear for Bea Bennett and, being able to overcome a fear that great, proves that Nightwing deserves to be a Green Lantern.




Being a Green Lantern is one of the most powerful things a person can become in the DC Universe and being one requires showing the ability to overcome great fear. Every Green Lantern has shown the ability to resist fear, which is extremely important because the Green Lantern&#39;s natural enemies are the Yellow Lanterns, who are empowered by fear. Nightwing has been a hero for years and faced many terrifying situations, but no situation has ever been so scary that Nightwing was frozen in fear before.



 Nightwing Is One Of DC&#39;s Bravest Heroes 
          

Many heroes have gotten power upgrades by becoming Green Lanterns, but not every hero has been able to prove that they truly deserve it. While Batman has been a Green Lantern in the past, he ultimately wasn&#39;t able to pass the test of letting go of the fear and trauma of his childhood. Nightwing has managed to prove on several occasions that no matter how terrifying something is, he&#39;ll always overcome it. Nightwing truly proves that he deserves to be a member of the Green Lantern Corps when he overcomes the greatest fear he&#39;s ever felt to save someone he loves.
