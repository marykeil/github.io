# Shonen Jump Loses Best-Selling Manga Spot For The First Time In 20 Years


## SUMMARY 



  Blue Lock is the first manga to dethrone Shonen Jump in two decades; it is the top-selling manga of 2023.   The surge in Blue Lock&#39;s popularity can be attributed to the anime adaptation and the manga&#39;s tie-in with the World Cup 2022.   Kodansha&#39;s achievement is significant and showcases their potential to compete with Shueisha in the manga industry.

## Literature Review

Shonen Jump has locked the annual best-selling manga position for the past 20 years, and an unlikely manga just broke the record.




Shonen Jump is responsible for some of the most iconic manga ever created, but recent sales data shows the iconic publisher lost out on the top-selling manga spot for the first time in two decades. Shueisha and its subsidiaries such as Shonen Jump have been dominating the manga industry since its founding in 1925. The company has put out some of the most memorable and iconic manga, such as Dragon Ball, One Piece, and Naruto, leading them to acquire publishing rights for new manga.




Now though, according to recent data from manga sales tracker Oricon, Shueisha and Shonen Jump have been dethroned by competitor Kodansha&#39;s series Blue Lock. X account Shonen Magazine News revealed the staggering accomplishment in a post saying:



&#34;With 10.527.146 copies sold, Blue Lock is the most sold manga in 2023 year according to Oricon! Blue Lock becomes the first spokon and the first manga from Shonen Magazine to achieve that first place in Oricon era!&#34;





 

Although Kodansha has always been a competitor to Shueisha, this is the first time one of their manga has surpassed Shonen Jump&#39;s manga to become the year&#39;s best-selling series. X user @justmeight confirmed just how impressive this accomplishment is with an image using Oricon&#39;s data to show what each year&#39;s best-selling manga was. Since 2000, every best-seller has been from Shueisha, which makes Blue Lock&#39;s achievement all the more impressive.

 Blue Lock Beats One Piece &amp; Jujutsu Kaisen as Top-Selling Manga 

 

Comicbook.com unveiled Oricon&#39;s list of top-selling manga, and despite Blue Lock nabbing first, the rest of the top-sellers are more in line with previous years. Unsurprisingly, this year&#39;s list of manga with the highest sales was dominated by Shonen Jump manga such as Chainsaw Man, Oshi no Ko, and Jujutsu Kaisen. What shocked everyone, though, was that the sports manga Blue Lock surpassed One Piece in sales. The manga was at number 7 last year, and although it was leading in the first half of 2023, it was assumed that the likes of One Piece and Jujutsu Kaisen would catch up and pass it.

 Ranking  Series  Sales  Publisher   1  Blue Lock  10.52 Million  Kodansha   2  Jujutsu Kaisen  8.54 Million  Shueisha   3  One Piece  7.18 Million  Shueisha   4  Oshi no Ko  5.41 Million  Shueisha   5  Chainsaw Man  5.35 Millions  Shueisha   6  Slam Dunk  4.97 Million  Shueisha   7  Spy x Family  4.33 Million  Shueisha   8  My Hero Academia  3.53 Million  Shueisha   9  Tokyo Revengers  3.22 Million  Kodansha   10  Kingdom  3.20 Million  Shueisha   






The surge in popularity may seem random and out of nowhere, but the reasons are surprising and make sense. Most manga have a sharp increase in manga sales when the anime adaptation airs, some being drastic, like Oshi No Ko receiving a 390% increase in sales. The anime was very popular, and when the first season ended, a second season and movie of Blue Lock were immediately announced. The other major factor that catapulted sales was the World Cup 2022. Blue Lock is all about a project that aims to make Japan win the World Cup. The artist behind the manga collaborated with Adidas to design jerseys for the Japanese national team, which were inspired by the manga.


 

Shueisha has always had the majority share of the manga industry, but this latest development is great. Kodansha has some amazing manga such as Attack On Titan, Vinland Saga, Parasyte, Akira, and many other genre-defining series. The company has many hidden gems that fans should definitely watch out for. Kodansha has just accomplished a huge milestone that they will hopefully continue doing in the future. Blue Lock is the first manga to dethrone Shonen Jump, and hopefully that will push both manga titans into new and exciting spaces.
