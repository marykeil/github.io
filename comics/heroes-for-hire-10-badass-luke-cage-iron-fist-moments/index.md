## Literature Review

Luke Cage and Iron Fist are the iconic Marvel Comics duo, the Heroes for Hire, with no shortage of badass moments between them. Here are the 10 best! 




Luke Cage and Iron Fist are an iconic duo, and they have been throughout every era of Marvel Comics canon. The first time these two worked together, they were collectively known as ‘Power Man and Iron Fist&#39; before rebranding to the much more eye-catching Heroes for Hire. However, even before the two got together, their separate solo series laid the groundwork for a number of adventures that would unfold within their shared continuity.
Luke Cage was the original Hero for Hire, and Danny Rand was an accomplished superhero as the Immortal Iron Fist long before the two of them ever joined forces. They even continued to kick ass in Marvel Comics long after they dissolved Heroes for Hire, both in reunion-style storylines and larger group settings with other high-profile superheroes. In short, no matter how they do it or in what capacity, Luke Cage and Iron Fist will always be Heroes for Hire, and they’ll always be badass. Here are 10 Marvel Comics moments that prove it!
            
 
 The 10 Most Powerful Iron Fist Punches in Marvel History 
From killing gods to tearing a hole in reality, Iron Fist&#39;s most powerful punches show his staggering potential should never be underestimated.












 








 10  Iron Fist Introduced One of the Cruelest Villains in Marvel Comics: Sabretooth 
Iron Fist #14 by Chris Claremont and John Byrne


 







Sabretooth is easily one of the cruelest villains in Marvel Comics history (something that is reinforced in the Sabretooth War event). While many fans likely attribute Sabretooth to Wolverine - and for good reason, as they are canonically arch rivals - Victor Creed actually made his debut in Iron Fist #14. He was hired to kidnap Danny Rand and Colleen Wing, not knowing that he was picking a fight with someone who can literally one-shot a dragon.
While their fight was cool and the entire issue was captivating, this is more of an example of badass by association, given how hardcore Sabretooth would prove to be throughout his Marvel Comics history - one that started in this issue of Iron Fist.





 9  Luke Cage Tried To Kill Doctor Doom... Over $200 
Luke Cage, Hero for Hire #8-9 by Steve Englehart and George Tuska


 







When Luke Cage was hired by Doctor Doom to eliminate some of his Doombots, Luke happily accepted the job, given his position as a hero for hire. However, when the job was done, and it came time to pay up, Doctor Doom skipped out on the bill, leaving Luke in the lurch. Angered immensely about being robbed, Luke Cage tracks down Doctor Doom with the intention of forcing him to pay up. And the kicker? The bill was only $200.
It’s unclear which aspect of this storyline is funnier, the fact that Doctor Doom - the leader of an entire country - refused to cough up $200 even after a job was done well, or the fact that Luke Cage challenged a supervillain who would later rip Thanos’ spine from his body for a measly couple hundred bucks. Whichever one it is, it’s clear that the latter is easily the most badass, as it proved Luke Cage’s confidence in his own powers, and his willingness to fight anyone who dares wrong him - even Doctor Doom.





 8  The First Time Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist Meet Is As Badass As It Is Historical 
Power Man #48 by Chris Claremont and John Byrne
        

When these two heroes, who were destined to work side-by-side practically from this moment onward, first met each other, they were far from friends. In fact, they were at each other’s throats - literally. Luke Cage breaks into Danny Rand’s home looking for Misty Knight, but instead he comes across Colleen Wing, and Danny jumps into action to protect her. At first, Iron Fist has the upper hand, catching Luke Cage off guard with his power-punch. But, Luke quickly recovers, and ends the fight by nearly strangling Iron Fist to death, but deciding to let him go before killing him.
This moment is where it all started, when the two founding members of the Heroes for Hire first met each other, making it a historic moment that also happened to be insanely badass.





 7  Luke Cage Nearly Did What Iron Fist &amp; Wolverine Have Failed To Do: Kill Sabretooth 
Power Man and Iron Fist #84 by Mary Jo Duffy and Denys Cowan
        

Sabretooth’s debut saw him survive Iron Fist, and his many battles against Wolverine always ended with the two of them walking away to fight another day, but that almost wasn’t the case when Luke Cage got his hands on Victor Creed. When Sabretooth is hunting Misty Knight for revenge, and starts hurting people in Misty and Luke’s lives, Luke Cage holds nothing back when the two of them are finally face-to-face.
In the end, Iron Fist actually convinces Luke Cage not to kill Sabretooth, meaning the only reason Sabretooth is still around to cause chaos in the Marvel Universe (and, indeed, the multiverse) today is because Luke Cage spared him - it doesn’t get much more badass than that.





 6  The Heroes For Hire’s Conflict With Unus The Untouchable Is Iconic 
Power Man and Iron Fist #90 by Kurt Busiek and Denys Cowan
        

Unus the Untouchable is a supervillain with the ability to generate force fields around his body, making him ‘untouchable’. Except, whenever he goes up against superheroes, he always seems to be beaten, as his powers usually can’t match theirs. So, Unus decides to quit being a supervillain and decides instead to be a petty criminal. He may not be able to defeat superheroes, but his force fields can absolutely keep him from getting arrested by the police. And that’s where the Heroes for Hire come into play.
This storyline is action-packed and exciting, to be sure, but it’s also simply iconic as a Heroes for Hire story in practically every conceivable way. It features a fascinating villain, a true street-level tale with major implications for regular people big-time superheroes would never even meet, and it still managed to show off Iron Fist and Luke Cage in the most badass light possible, making this one of the most well-rounded Heroes for Hire stories in their entire catalog.





 5  Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist Actually Prevented World War III 
Power Man and Iron Fist #104 by Archie Goodwin and Greg LaRocque
        

After they seemingly take down a villain named Doombringer, Luke Cage and Iron Fist are alerted to a situation Colleen Wing and Misty Knight find themselves in over in the Middle East, a situation set up by Doombringer himself. The villain orchestrated an imminent nuclear attack on the United States, and with Wing and Knight out of commission, it’s up to the Heroes for Hire to stop what’s been set in motion before it&#39;s too late.
In the end, the two stop the missiles, and Doombringer meets his very well deserved end. In doing so, Luke Cage and Iron Fist not only saved the lives of thousands, they also effectively prevented World War III.





 4  Luke Cage Is Framed For Murdering Iron Fist Before Disappearing For Years 
Power Man and Iron Fist #125 by Jim Owsley and Mark Bright
        

This issue marked the end of an era for Power Man and Iron Fist, as it was, indeed, the final issue of their series - and what a finale it was. Iron Fist was channeling his chi to help save the life of a little boy plagued with powers that he didn’t understand - and they were killing him. While Danny sat by the boy’s bedside in the hospital, asleep in the chair next to him, the boy transformed into the superhuman Captain Hero. His mind stinging with pain, Captain Hero tried to wake Iron Fist up so Danny could help him, but he did so by punching the unwitting and asleep Iron Fist through the wall of the hospital, killing Iron Fist instantly.
Danny Rand died in this issue (even if it was technically an impostor), and since no one knew the little boy could turn into Captain Hero, Luke Cage was blamed for it.





 3  The Heroes For Hire Actually Saved The Hulk 
Heroes for Hire #1 (1997) by Roger Stern, John Ostrander, and Pasqual Ferry
        

During Marvel Comics’ Heroes Reborn initiative, Danny Rand and Luke Cage got another shot at being the Heroes for Hire, Power Man and Iron Fist, once again. This time, they decided to expand their roster a bit in order to tackle better money-making jobs, and one of the first missions they find themselves on is saving the Hulk.
The Hulk is kidnapped by an organization that successfully embeds a mind control device in the back of his head, and is forcing the Hulk to commit acts of villainy for them. That is, until the Heroes for Hire take the case, and Iron Fist lives up to his namesake and destroys the chip with a single punch, thereby saving the Hulk and accomplishing a truly badass comeback all in one go.





 2  Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist Upstage Spider-Man By Beating Tombstone On The Fly 
Power Man and Iron Fist Vol. 3 #1 by David Walker and Sanford Greene
        

“The Boys Are Back” is a fan-favorite Luke Cage and Iron Fist storyline, and one of the few good things to come out of Marvel Comics’ Civil War II era. The comic is as it sounds, as Iron Fist and Luke Cage tackle ‘one more mission’ together in a reunion-style arc, one that lands them right in the office of known gang leader Tombstone - and the two of them soundly defeat Tombstone and all his goons with zero prep time.
Tombstone was more recently a main antagonist in Amazing Spider-Man, showing the web-slinger struggling to take him down. Meanwhile, Luke Cage and Iron Fist did so without even trying, which only proves how badass they are in an already amazing story arc.





 1  Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist Come Out Of Retirement To Help Take Down The Kingpin 
Devil’s Reign by Chip Zdarsky and Marco Checchetto


 







While they were far from the only heroes involved, Devil’s Reign made a point to show how both Danny Rand and Luke Cage came out of retirement to help take down the Kingpin after Mayor Fisk waged war on the entire superhero community. Devil’s Reign was the highest-stakes street-level storyline in recent memory (with the more recent Gang War being the only other one of note that’s giving it a run for its money), and Luke Cage and Iron Fist were front and center. Plus, the event led to Luke Cage becoming the mayor of New York City, effectively reshaping his entire Marvel Comics career.
Out of all their adventures, this one is easily one of the 10 most badass moments for the iconic Heroes for Hire, Luke Cage and Iron Fist.
