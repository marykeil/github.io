# Carnage Has One Huge Weakness Marvel Heroes Need to Exploit Broccoli


## SUMMARY 



  Carnage, one of Marvel&#39;s most dangerous villains, can be brought down with a dose of vitamin C, as revealed in Carnage: Mind Bomb.   Injecting a symbiote&#39;s host with a large dose of vitamin C disrupts their brain&#39;s connection to the symbiote, rendering the symbiote helpless for a few minutes.   While vitamin C is effective against symbiotes like Carnage, its effects are only temporary, before the symbiote can reconnect and regain control.

## Literature Review

Carnage is one of the most deadly and dangerous serial killers in the entire Marvel Universe, but one vegetable is all it takes to beat him.




Despite being one of the most dangerous villains to ever inflict damage on the Marvel Universe, the symbiote Carnage has a surprisingly simple weakness – as it turns out, in order to bring Carnage down, the only thing Spider-Man, or the other heroes of the Marvel Universe, would need is a nice helping of broccoli.




Carnage: Mind Bomb – by Warren Ellis, Kyle Hotz, John Babcock, Mike Higgins, and Marie Javins – revealed Carnage&#39;s surprising weakness. After the Ravencroft Institute failed to make any headway in treating Cletus Kasady, they brought in Dr. Kurtz, a psychiatric specialist from Washington, to try his hand at getting through to Cletus.



          

Fully aware of Cletus and his Carnage symbiote, Kurtz didn&#39;t enter his cell without a plan. Kurtz first used a sonic gun to disorient the Carnage symbiote, and then he injects Cletus with a massive dose of vitamin C. This disrupted his brain&#39;s connection to the symbiote, disabling him entirely.

                  Thanos Is Responsible For The Birth of Marvel&#39;s Deadliest Symbiote   Thanos is one of the most dangerous aliens in Marvel, and because of him, Earth has to deal with the most deadly serial killer ever known.   





 Symbiotes Have A Vitamin C Deficiency 


          

Carnage is one of the most brutal serial killers that Marvel has ever seen. Part of this is due to his absurd physical ability. Carnage is able to create weapons from his symbiote, which he uses to devastating effect. His cruelty is nearly endless, and he really doesn&#39;t care what kind of victim he has. Carnage has slaughtered anyone from the elderly to young children. Carnage is so dangerous he&#39;s actually stronger than the Hulk in some instances. The biggest weaknesses that symbiotes tend to have are heat and sonics, and both have been used against Carnage in the past, but one weakness is a lot easier to use.

The classic symbiote weaknesses have increasingly become less effective on Carnage, who has managed to rid himself of these weaknesses on several occasions. This makes him practically unstoppable, except for his weakness to vitamin C, as revealed in Carnage: Mind Bom. As Dr. Kurtz demonstrated, injecting Cletus with a large dose of vitamin C immediately disablef his connection to his symbiote; while ultimately, Cletus absorbed the vitamin C fairly quickly, it was still a good few minutes where he was completely helpless. For heroes like Venom, Spider-Man, and the Avengers, separating Cletus from the Carnage symbiote could be all that&#39;s needed to prevent major devastation.






 Vitamin C Is Effective Against Symbiotes – But Only Briefly 


          

Dealing with Cletus Kasady and the Carnage symbiote has been one of the most difficult problems for the heroes of the Marvel universe. As Carnage: Mind Bomb made clear, vitamin C – which common vegetables such as broccoli contains a ton of – is an effective tool that more Marvel heroes should deploy when fighting Carnage, as well as other symbiotes. However, they must keep in mind that timing is critical; as Dr. Kurz unfortunately learned in Mind Bomb, a vitamin C infusion only buys several minutes of time before the symbiote is able to reconnect to its host and reassert control.



Carnage: Mind Bomb was released in 1996. It is available now from Marvel Comics!
