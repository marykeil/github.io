## Literature Review

DC Comics goes all out in promoting Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham with a new trailer that animates a fight scene between Bruce and his new rogues.




DC Comics&#39; epic new comic comes to life in a trailer for Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham. Now that the series has released its second issue, the publisher is hyping up its intense Black Label miniseries with an animated trailer that shows off just how brutal the newest members of his rogues&#39; gallery are.




On YouTube, DC Comics posted a trailer promoting the release of Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham&#39;s second issue. The trailer is fully animated and shows Batman dropping into a warehouse filled with cartoon memorabilia. Unbeknownst to him, however, is Batman&#39;s newest villain Crytoon, who weeps as he attacks the Dark Knight with a hammer.


 

Crytoon swings his hammer, but Batman is too quick for his opponent to land a blow. Crytoon isn&#39;t the only new foe seen as the perturbing villain Moth-er is briefly shown, surrounded by a swarm of flittering bugs. The trailer also provides a tease of the Virgin, a villain who has yet to cross Batman&#39;s path.

Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham is a DC Black Label series set in its own continuity. In this world, Gotham is far more bleak and corrupt, plagued by horrifying social ills. Unlike the Prime DC Universe, this version of Gotham isn&#39;t filled with the standard coterie of supervillains that so often battle the Dark Knight. However, the metropolis has its own twisted antagonists such as Crytoon, a murderer obsessed with an old-school cartoon who kills people in violent, over-the-top ways. There&#39;s also Moth-er, a priest who&#39;s part of a shadowy secret society and uses swarms of moths when attacking his victims.

This trailer isn&#39;t the first time Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham has gone animated. At San Diego Comic-Con 2023, DC hyped up the then-upcoming series with an animated teaser. This trailer was followed up with anothe after the miniseries&#39; first issue was released, which showed Batman patrolling Gotham before entering Crytoon&#39;s warehouse. Every new trailer seems to be building up a simplified version of Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham&#39;s narrative. The trailer really is a sight to behold as it captures the style and tone of Rafael Grampa&#39;s story. Compared to other comic book promos, this trailer goes above and beyond previous marketing attempts for other comics.






 New Batman Trailer Raises the Bar on Comic Book Promotion 
          

When a comic does get a trailer to help promote it, it&#39;s often nothing more than a motion comic (which admittedly can help bolster interest among casual readers). However, Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham&#39;s fully animated promos are in a completely different ballpark. Not only are they very well made and engaging, they show off the dark and gritty world the story presents as well as the extremely disturbing villains Batman faces. Sure, the trailer could have just shown pictures from the series and communicated the same ideas. But these animated commercials break the mold when it comes to hyping up Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham.
