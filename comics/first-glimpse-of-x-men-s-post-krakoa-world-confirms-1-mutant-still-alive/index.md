## Literature Review

Fans can get their first glimpse at the X-Men&#39;s post-Krakoan world in this year&#39;s Free Comic Book Day Special, starring a surprise mutant.




Fans will soon get their first look at the X-Men’s post-Krakoa world, and learn that one mutant is still alive. Krakoa fell at last year’s Hellfire Gala, but now with Fall of the House of X/Rise of the Powers of X on the horizon, a new era in mutant history will be beginning and fans can get their first glimpse at it in Free Comic Book Day 2024: Blood Hunt/X-Men #1.




Marvel released more information about Free Comic Book Day 2024: Blood Hunt/X-Men #1 on their website. The first half of the book sets up this year&#39;s vampire-centric Blood Hunt event and the second, featuring a new story written by Gail Simone and drawn by David Marquez, will feature Jubilee, who, according to Marvel, will go on a “journey to where it all began.” Marvel provided no additional information or preview art.



          

However, the cover is noteworthy for featuring the classic X-Men logo, one missing from the books during the Krakoan era.


 The Krakoan Era Was the X-Men&#39;s Crowning Achievement 
          




The Krakoan era was a bold step forward for the X-Men and Earth’s mutants. After years of persecution, mutants finally had a homeland of their own–but it was not to last. Orchis staged an attack on Krakoa during the Hellfire Gala, in an attack that left many dead and others unaccounted for. The Fall of X has shown the terrifying aftermath of the attack, but now the mutants are preparing to make their final stand against Orchis in Fall of the House of X/Rise of the Powers of X. After that, the X-Men will have a new status quo, and now Marvel is giving fans a first look.

While the post-Krakoan landscape is still shrouded in mystery, Marvel has confirmed that at least Jubilee survived, and will be a part of the X-Men’s new era. The press release promised Jubilee was on a quest to “where it all began,” but did not reveal any more details. The most logical choice would be the X-Mansion, a classic X-Men landmark and one that has not been seen in some time. Returning to the X-Mansion would be the perfect way to kick off a new beginning for the X-Men. It looks back at what made the franchise so great in the first place, while simultaneously looking ahead to what lies ahead.






 The Krakoan Era Proved the X-Men Still Had Plenty of Stories Left in Them 
          

What lies next for the X-Men is still up in the air, but the Krakoan era raised the bar high for future stories. Krakoa was a huge risk, but one that paid off, creating some of the best X-Men stories in recent memory. Judging from the use of the classic X-Men logo on the book’s cover, this new direction may be a return to the franchise’s roots–and a trip to the derelict X-Mansion is the perfect way for doing this. The Krakoan era restored the X-Men to a place of prominence in the Marvel Universe, and their new era, with an emphasis on the classics, will continue this.
