## Literature Review

It is a Christmastime tradition for every Robin, former and current, to face-off against one expected villain...and not tell the others.




Warning: DC&#39;s Twas the &#39;Mite Before Christmas #1!




It is a Christmastime tradition for every former and current Robin to keep this specific secret from each other. Anyone who was ever Robin within the Bat Family has a tight-knit bond together. They can all connect over their shared successes and failures of training under Batman. However, that doesn&#39;t stop them from keeping one secret – albeit a hilarious one – from each other.

DC&#39;s Twas the &#39;Mite Before Christmas #1 is a one-shot collection of Christmas-themed stories featuring several fan-favorite DC characters. The story &#34;Wonderful Toys,&#34; – written by Sholly Fisch, with art and color by Juan Bobillo, and lettering by Dave Sharpe – depicts the first meeting between Damian Wayne and Bat-Mite.



          

As it turns out, each previous Robin has had their own run-ins with Bat-Mite on Christmas...but none have told each other. Dick Grayson nor Tim Drake are willing to loop the latest incarnation of the hero in, instead letting Damian think he&#39;s crazy. However, Damian shouldn&#39;t feel too bad: Jason Todd and Dick went through the same ordeal, without either telling Tim.




                  Robin: Bruce Wayne&#39;s Son Admits His Deepest Trauma   DC delivers an emotional gut punch in their Christmas special, pulling back the curtain on Robin&#39;s most profound trauma and leaving fans heartbroken.   


 First Rule of Robin Club: Don&#39;t Talk About Bat-Mite 
          

While most of the Bat Family decorate for the holidays, Damian insists on training instead. That&#39;s when he&#39;s visited by the elusive, mischievous Bat-Mite, who punches Robin in the face when he doesn&#39;t recognize him, calling Damian &#34;an imposter!&#34; Damian endures his own personal torment at Bat-Mite&#39;s hands as the diminutive dynamo rampages through the Bat Cave. Things take a surprising turn when Damian is met by a vision of his mother, but things get even weirder and wilder once his Bat brothers make their way to the Cave. Suddenly, everything Damian witnessed Bat-Mite do is gone, and the Cave is in perfect shape – as if nothing had happened.




Damian tries to explain to Tim and Dick that a &#34;magical imp&#34; destroyed the Bat Cave, but the former Robins play coy as if they have no idea what he is talking about, leaving Damian utterly confused. Feeling slightly guilty, Dick whispers to Tim, asking if they should tell Damian they not only know who Bat-Mite is, but have met him. Tim reminds Dick that neither he nor Jason told him about Bat-Mite, revealing that this is a familiar tradition among the Robins – a rite of passage for each of Batman&#39;s proteges, something each previous iteration of the sidekick has gone through.



 Every Robin Is Initiated Into The Family By Bat-Mite 


          

The ridiculous feats that Bat-Mite is capable of are already indescribable to someone out of the know as far as who or what he is. Damian is lucky enough to have a family of people who have experienced the might of Bat-Mite, but no one wants to confess to their experiences. It&#39;s almost like every Robin needs a Bat-Mite encounter to truly indoctrinate themselves into the Bat-Family, even if they don&#39;t tell each other about it. It&#39;s a Christmas tradition for every Robin to earn their place in the Bat Family with a mind-bending Bat-Mite face-off, as revealed in &#34;Wonderful Toys,&#34; from DC&#39;s Twas the &#39;Mite Before Christmas #1.






DC&#39;s Twas the &#39;Mite Before Christmas #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
