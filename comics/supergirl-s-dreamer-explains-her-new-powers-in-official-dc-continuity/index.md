## Literature Review

Dreamer, an original character from the CW&#39;s Supergirl series, takes a moment to explain her new powers in official DC Comics continuity. 




Warning: Spoilers for Titans: Beast World Tour - Metropolis #1!As Dreamer establishes herself as a part of the official DC Comics canon, the original Supergirl character illustrates her new powers. Played by Nicole Maines, Dreamer originally debuted in The CW&#39;s Supergirl before becoming a recurring hero of the Arrowverse, where she can see the future through her dreams. In due time, Dreamer was officially introduced in the comics as one of the new premier heroes of the DC Universe.




The former Supergirl character continues to evolve her powers in Titans: Beast World Tour – Metropolis #1, in the story &#34;Primal Pain&#34; by Nicole Maines, Steve Orlando, and Fico Ossio. Mikel Janin&#39;s cover art and a preview of the panels to be included in this issue can all be seen below. Titans: Beast World Tour - Metropolis will be available in stores starting December 5.

         

Dreamer&#39;s powers first got a power upgrade during DC&#39;s &#34;Lazarus Planet&#34; event from last year, but this is the first time that Dreamer takes the time to make sense of those powers out loud. In addition, readers get to see that new power upgrade on display during the issue.

                  Supergirl&#39;s Dreamer is Teased as DC&#39;s Next Top Sorcerer   Supergirl&#39;s Dreamer is quickly becoming one of the most important characters in the DCU—especially after her strange encounter with Doctor Fate.   





 Dreamer&#39;s New Powers 
          

The story begins with Dreamer in her civilian identity, Nia Nal, having lunch with her friend Yvette. Nia has a strange and awkward encounter with a waitress. Despite being insistent about taking a plate for the waitress, Nia nonetheless drops it all of a sudden. When questioned about it by Yvette, Nia just says she was &#34;confused.&#34; Nia then elaborates, recapping the events she went through during the &#34;Lazarus Planet&#34; event. During the storm that gave people around the world new powers, Nia&#39;s powers changed significantly. Instead of seeing the future through her dreams, her precognition powers are activated while she&#39;s awake.

&#34;Sometimes I see a couple seconds ahead,&#34; Nia continues. &#34;Sometimes hours...days...I don&#39;t ...I don&#39;t always know what&#39;s real. I feel like I&#39;m losing my mind.&#34; She adds it&#39;s never clear to her if the future she is seeing is supposed to happen right now or later. Readers get to see Nia&#39;s dilemma firsthand when she reacts to seeing a massive explosion in the background, but when no one else around her reacts, she quickly realizes that this explosion is a premonition rather than something happening now.






 Dreamer&#39;s Powers Get Even More Complicated 
          

Both in the show and in the comics, Dreamer struggled to navigate with her powers when it was just through her dreams. Now, she is seeing the future in real-time and can&#39;t discern the future from what&#39;s currently happening in reality. Maybe it&#39;s something that Nia will need to adapt to in time, but clearly, she is falling apart at the seams just trying to do basic day-to-day tasks. This will mark Dreamer&#39;s first official adventure trying to navigate with these updated powers and time will tell how the Supergirl alum can learn to work through them to save the day.



Titans: Beast World Tour – Metropolis #1 will be available from DC Comics on December 5.
