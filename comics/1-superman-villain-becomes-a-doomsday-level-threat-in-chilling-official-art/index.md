## Literature Review

An iconic villain reaches Doomsday-level threat status in a chilling variant cover for an upcoming Superman comic, teasing a grim fate for Kal-El.




Fans are preparing for a seismic shift in the Superman universe as Lex Luthor, the iconic nemesis of the Man of Steel, escalates to Doomsday-level threat status in a harrowing variant cover. The chilling imagery teases a dark and foreboding future for Kal-El, with Luthor at the helm of his demise.




Superman and Lex Luthor&#39;s precarious partnership takes center stage in Superman #12–by Joshua Williamson and David Baldeón–as they unite to face the formidable &#34;Lex Luthor Revenge Squad,&#34; determining the fate of Metropolis. Lex insists he&#39;s now on the side of righteousness, but a sneak peek at Lee Bermejo&#39;s variant cover for the upcoming comic makes this claim doubtful.

 Superman #12 (2024)                 Release Date:  March 19, 2024    Writers:  Joshua Williamson    Artists:  David Baldeón    Cover Artist:  Jamal Campbell    Variant Covers:  Lee Bermejo, Clayton Henry, Alan Quah, Dan Jurgens, and Norm Rapmund   THE MAN OF STEEL TEAMS WITH LEX LUTHOR AGAINST THE LEX LUTHOR REVENGE SQUAD! Superman is the brains while Lex is the brawn, as they team up to battle the Lex Luthor Revenge Squad for the fate of Metropolis. Lex has sworn to Superman that he is a changed man, but to what lengths will he go to stop his enemies?! And what danger from deep space rapidly makes its way toward Earth?   






Luthor, clad in his imposing Warsuit and brandishing kryptonite, looms over a defeated Man of Steel, who is crushed beneath the erstwhile adversary&#39;s boot. This foreboding imagery casts doubt on Lex&#39;s professed change, leaving fans on edge until the comic&#39;s March 19, 2024 release.


 Lex Luthor Kills Superman in Variant Cover Art for Upcoming Comic 


          

Luthor&#39;s iconic Warsuit, making its debut in Action Comics #544 (1983) by Cary Bates and Curt Swan, was initially crafted by the villain as a strategic response to the overwhelming power of his arch-nemesis, Superman. Over the years, fans have witnessed various incarnations of the Warsuit. In a recent twist, the suit played a pivotal role in Superman #9 by Joshua Williamson and Bruno Redondo, as Luthor refitted the suit for Superman&#39;s temporary use during a period of vulnerability after intense battles. However, the variant cover for Superman #12 suggests that Luthor has re-commandeered the loaned-out Warsuit and is now using it against Superman.




This official art paints a dire tableau for Superman, marking a bleak culmination of his longstanding rivalry with Lex Luthor. Crushed under the merciless boot of the Warsuit, Superman lies defeated amidst a pile of rubble, bearing the visible wounds of a brutal encounter. The haunting imagery suggests he is suffering from Kryptonite poisoning as well as a brutal beating, pushing him to the brink of death. This signals a transformative moment, elevating Lex Luthor to the status of a Doomsday-level threat. The cover encapsulates the intensity of their conflict and leaves fans eagerly speculating about the perilous fate awaiting the iconic Man of Steel.



 Fans Could Be Facing Another Death of Superman Storyline 
          

Examining the variant cover for Superman #12, fans are left contemplating the potential unfolding of another The Death of Superman storyline. This iconic narrative, where the Man of Steel met his demise at the hands of the genetically engineered monstrosity Doomsday, seems to loom in the visual narrative. With Clark already in a weakened state, the plausibility of Luthor seizing the opportunity to defeat him becomes a compelling possibility. Complicating matters is the current truce between the two, providing Luthor with the advantage of catching Kal-El off guard and orchestrating an unexpected attack. The suspense surrounding Superman&#39;s fate escalates as fans anxiously await the March release date.




Superman #12 will be available to read from DC Comics on March 19, 2024.
