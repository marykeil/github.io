 Artemis of Bana-Mighdall Gets Legendary Redesign 


          

After once donning the mantle of Wonder Woman during the dynamic era of the &#39;90s, Artemis has seamlessly become a recurring figure, leaving an indelible mark on various DC storylines. Her journey took a unique turn when she joined the eclectic ensemble of Red Hood&#39;s rag-tag outlaws in the Red Hood and the Outlaws (2016—2018) series. In a recent narrative twist, Artemis found herself unjustly accused and subsequently cleared of the tragic murder of Amazon Queen Hippolyta. Now, with the latest DC comic solicitations for February on the horizon, it appears that the Amazon&#39;s path is destined to collide with Batman&#39;s.

Francesco Mattina&#39;s breathtaking variant cover has ignited a wave of excitement among fans eagerly anticipating Artemis&#39;s entrance into the three-part Batman adventure, commencing with Batman: The Brave and the Bold #10. The variant cover, nothing short of badass, stands as the pinnacle of character design for Artemis, surpassing all previous iterations. Mattina&#39;s artistic prowess takes center stage, showcasing an unparalleled ability to reimagine a character while preserving their unmistakable essence. The anticipation for this Batman adventure is now not only fueled by the narrative promises but also by the visual feast that Mattina&#39;s skillful artistry guarantees, making this a must-have for fans and collectors alike.




                  Red Hood&#39;s New &#34;Dark Trinity&#34; Adventures Are a Must-Read for Jason Todd Fans   The new &#39;Dark Trinity&#39; escapades of Red Hood are an unmissable journey for die-hard fans who love all things Jason Todd and Outlaw-related.   



 DC Meets World of Warcraft in Stunning Variant Cover Art 
          

Mattina&#39;s high-fantasy rendition of Artemis draws an uncanny parallel to the captivating concept art featured in the expansive realm of the popular open-world game, World of Warcraft. Notably, Artemis&#39;s battle axe becomes a focal point, so reminiscent of the iconic weaponry one might expect to earn in challenging raids like Dragon Soul, the apex of difficulty in the Cataclysm expansion with the formidable Deathwing as its final boss. Mattina&#39;s redesign provides fans with a fresh perspective on the &#39;90s Wonder Woman and sparks a yearning among World of Warcraft enthusiasts who can&#39;t help but wish for Artemis&#39;s formidable presence within the game&#39;s immersive universe.




Batman: The Brave and the Bold #10 will be available to read on February 27, 2024, from DC Comics.
