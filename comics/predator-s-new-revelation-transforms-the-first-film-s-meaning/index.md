# Predator s New Revelation Transforms the First Film s Meaning


## SUMMARY 



  The lore of the Predator franchise is expanding thanks to Marvel&#39;s new comics, redefining what fans already knew from the first film.   Predators are not random trophy hunters, but officially drawn to planets with war or unrest on a global scale.   This makes the first Predator film (and Prey) overt political commentary, showcasing humanity&#39;s lust for war attracting cosmic punishment.

## Literature Review

The latest installment in the Predator franchise redefines the first movie&#39;s meaning, as it explains what the Yautja was doing there to begin with. 




At long last, the lore of the Predator franchise is being explored and explained, answering some of the fandom&#39;s most nagging questions. Not only are the new canon comic books revealing more about the seemingly two-dimensional species, but this information is actually redefining what fans already knew–stretching all the way back to the very first film.




1987’s Predator follows a group of American mercenaries–led by a man named Dutch (Arnold Schwarzenegger)–who are called to action in an undisclosed South American country for a &#39;rescue mission.&#39; The Truth: American forces couldn&#39;t intervene, as the nation was under the threat of falling to communism. Set amidst the Red Scare of the 1980s (and years after the end of the Vietnam War), tensions were still high with the Soviet Union, and the domino theory was still taken extremely seriously. A communist nation in Americ&#39;a backyard made the film&#39;s CIA nervous, sending in Green Berets to disrupt the region. When that didn’t work, Dutch and his mercenaries were hired to finish the job and tie up loose ends. Basically, this conflict was much more than two groups of people shooting at each other in a forest. And that battle is exactly why the Predator appeared in the jungle, as its species monitors planets for signs of unrest and war.


 Predators are Drawn to Moments of War to Abduct the Deadliest Prey 
          




In Predator Vol. 2 #2 by Ed Brisson and Netho Diaz, a group of people are running for their lives on an alien planet, as they are being hunted by a team of Predators. After talking among themselves, they come to find out that each of them thinks it’s a different year. One person thinks it’s the ‘90s, another thinks it&#39;s the 2020s, and a few more swear it’s closer to the 2050s. The reason for this confusion is that each of them were originally from a different time period on Earth, and every time a Predator hunted on Earth they abducted someone and put them in stasis, only to wake them up when they were needed for a controlled hunt like this one.

What’s even more interesting is that the dates weren’t random, as each of them corresponded with some type of wartime conflict on Earth, and most of the people who were on this planet were soldiers. What this issue seems to confirm is that Predators are drawn to planets specifically when there is a war going on, or some type of unrest that would cause battles to erupt that impact most of the planet.






 The Predators Are A Cosmic Punishment, Not Random Hunters 
          

This is why the Predator in the first movie found itself right in the middle of a CIA-led skirmish in South America. It’s because that seemingly innocuous battle was secretly a fight between two of the biggest power-houses in the world at that time: the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Predator saw the unrest on Planet Earth, targeted a specific area where conflicts were present, and made that its hunting ground. This method ensured that the Predator was hunting the most worthy prey possible, with the added benefit of perhaps taking one of the humans with them to put on stasis once they were finished.

With this new revelation, the meaning of the first Predator film is totally transformed from a classic action movie into a heavy piece of political commentary, as the Yautja acts as cosmic punishment for humanity&#39;s lust for war is the very thing that attracts it.
