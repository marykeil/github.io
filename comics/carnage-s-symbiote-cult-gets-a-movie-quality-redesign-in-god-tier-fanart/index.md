## Literature Review

Carnage is slowly building a cult in the Marvel Universe, and artist BossLogic gives them a chilling, movie-quality makeover. 




Carnage’s symbiote cult gets a movie quality redesign in a new piece of god-tier fan art. Carnage is the deadliest of the symbiotes, a remorseless killer who has cut a path of terror and destruction across the Marvel Universe. Along the way, Carnage has gained acolytes and followers. Now, one of these cult members gets an epic redesign in a stunning new piece from acclaimed artist BossLogic.




BossLogic unveiled the piece in a post on Instagram. The piece shows a member of Carnage’s cult, complete with the trademark red spiral on their face. The unidentified cult member is perched on top of a building, ready to strike. They are grinning ear to ear, revealing a set of fearsome teeth.


 

BossLogic prefaced the piece with only a red spiral.


 Carnage Is On the Road to Becoming a Marvel God 
          

After Venom began drifting towards anti-hero status in the early 1990s, a new killer symbiote character was needed: enter Carnage. Cletus Kasady, a cellmate of Eddie Brock’s, was infected by the symbiote, becoming Carnage. He has been one of the most fearsome villains in the Marvel Universe, and recently began a quest towards godhood. Carnage got his first taste of it during the buildup to the King in Black event, when he was resurrected to be “Knull’s Messiah.” Although this cult was brought down, the seed was now in Carnage’s head. Carnage is once again making a stab at godhood in the pages of his new ongoing series.




On his own, Carnage is bad news. Unlike Venom, who operates with a strict moral code, Carnage kills indiscriminately. In one of his first appearances, Carnage killed a man simply because he did not like his name. He is a villain with no redeeming value and is beyond rehabilitation. With a cult at his disposal, Carnage could take his evil to a whole new level. The few instances where Carnage has dabbled in cults and religions were downright chilling, and if he is successful in his plans to achieve god status, then the Marvel Universe is in for a tough fight.

                  Carnage Proved His Godhood By Replicating Thor&#39;s Most Epic MCU Feat   Carnage is one of the more dangerous villains in the Marvel Universe and he just proved how powerful he is by replicating a major MCU Thor feat.   



 The Movies Should Take a Cue from BossLogic&#39;s Carnage Design 
          




And BossLogic’s new piece perfectly captures the menace and danger that comes with Carnage’s cult. The acolyte depicted in the picture have completely surrendered themselves to Carnage. Their facial features have been replaced by the sinister red spiral that has become Carnage’s calling card. This spiral represents the downward trek into Carnage’s world of madness and violence, and this person has let themselves go, embracing it head-on. Carnage’s evil has destroyed many lives, including those of his victims and those of his followers. This cult is Carnage’s legacy and BossLogic makes it terrifying in this epic new piece.
