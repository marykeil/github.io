## Literature Review

Superman is one of the strongest characters in comics, and his greatest defeat came from Doomsday, but now one villain has beaten Superman again.




Warning! Contains spoilers For Superman #9!




Very few villains have been able to beat Superman in a straight-up fight, with one of the few examples being Doomsday. But recently, the current Superman creative team promised to give readers a new Doomsday-level threat for the Man of Steel to face. Considering his injuries after the fight, it seems clear thattThe Chained has absolutely lived up to this description, as he&#39;s injured Superman unlike anyone since Doomsday.

The biggest challenge that Superman has just overcome is facing off against the Doomsday-level threat called the Chained, a villain from Lex Luthor&#39;s past. After Superman releases the Chained from his prison, Superman quickly realizes the mistake he&#39;s made as the Chained goes on a rampage throughout Metropolis.



          

Unable to stop him at first, Superman eventually realizes that the Chained&#39;s power can be nullified with kryptonite. With no other option, Superman strikes the Chained with kryptonite and weakens him enough to be captured. However, Superman is also left badly injured and on the verge of death and readers can see Lois helping his recovery in Superman #9 by Joshua Williamson, Bruno Redondo, Adriano Lucas, Ariana Maher.




                  Superman&#39;s New Doomsday-Level Villain Has Comics&#39; Rarest Superpower   Supermanâ€™s destructive new enemy the Chained is unleashed upon Metropolis and his amazing power has a secret connection to one Super-Family member.   


 Superman&#39;s Fight With The Chained Is As Bad As His Fight With Doomsday 
         

Introduced in the seminal Death of Superman storyline, Doomsday is a massive creature who intensely hates all living things. It first appeared on Earth and began rampaging toward Metropolis, easily slaughtering any heroes in its way. This resulted in Superman and Doomsday having a titanic battle in the streets of Metropolis that eventually ended with Doomsday being defeated, but Superman seemingly dying from his injuries as well. Superman entered a catatonic state, and it took a long time for him to wake up. Now, it seems that the Chained has just achieved a similar accomplishment.




After being freed, the Chained is able to take on the entire Super-Family and keep them at bay due to his intense telekinetic powers that prevents them from getting close to him. His power is so great that Superman has to resort to using kryptonite to be able to bypass his telekinetic shield and deal any damage to him. While this definitely works, it also ends the battle the same way as Superman&#39;s iconic encounter with Doomsday. While the threat to Metropolis is defeated, Superman is left hanging onto life by a thread.



 Superman&#39;s Battle With The Chained Leaves Him Badly Wounded 


          

As the protector of Earth, Superman has gone up against literal gods and faced off with the likes of Darkseid, but the biggest defeat he ever suffered was at the hands of Doomsday. Doomsday was the only villain to match Superman blow for blow and, in some instances, even overpower him. While Clark was able to eventually overcome Doomsday, it practically cost him his life. Now it seems that history is repeating itself, and just as readers were promised, the Chained has lived up to being a Doomsday-level threat by once again putting Superman in a coma after the hardest fight of his life.






Superman #9 will be available from DC Comics on December 19!
