## Literature Review

Despite the hot chocolate and Christmas movies, all is not as it seems in this preview for ANTARCTICA #6, as exclusively shared by Screen Rant.




The holiday season is getting a science-fiction twist in an exclusive new preview of Top Cow and Image Comics&#39; Antarctica #6. This preview may feature a warm family scene, but all is not right for Hannah Curtis.




Screen Rant can exclusively share a new preview for Antarctica #6 by Simon Birks, Willi Roberts, and Lyndon White. While the preview focuses on a classic kind of holiday moment — featuring hot chocolate, classic Christmas movies, and some family drama — the opening page suggests there&#39;s something far more strange going on behind the scenes.

         

Top Cow&#39;s official synopsis of the issue — available everywhere comics are sold on December 13th — promises even more trouble for Hannah and her father:



&#34;THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PAST.&#34; It&#39;s Christmas Eve. Hannah is seven years old and looking forward to spending the holidays with her father, but when she wakes on Christmas morning, things don&#39;t seem right. Jerome is acting suspiciously, the windows are showing the same scenes over and over again, and someone, or something, is waiting for her on the other side of the wall…

 Top Cow&#39;s Antarctica Combines Sci-Fi Mystery with Family Drama 


          

Top Cow&#39;s sci-fi series Antarctica begins its second arc with issue #6, delving deeper into Hannah Curtis&#39; past and relationship with her father. The series begins, in fact, with a major moment from Hannah&#39;s childhood: the disappearance of her father after one of his expeditions to Antarctica. Though Hannah struggles to pull her life together, her father&#39;s fate haunts her, and she eventually gets a job at the same research station in Antarctica where her father once worked. But there&#39;s one major twist: Hannah soon meets Dr. Curtis, an alternate version of herself who comes from a dark world where resources are slim. The two Hannahs work together in the series&#39; first arc, but now a new mystery is taking shape.




The new preview of Antarctica #6 not only marks the start of a new story for Top Cow&#39;s latest science fiction series, it also reveals what makes the series stand out from other sci-fi comic fare. With a focus first and foremost on Hannah&#39;s character and her complicated past with her family, Antarctica knows that the intrigue lies just as much in the characters&#39; familial struggles as it does in the classic time- and dimension-traveling trappings. Even for readers unfamiliar with Antarctica&#39;s first arc, this preview promises the perfect jumping on point to get to know Hannah and her world.

With a new story arc starting with this issue — and with a plot timed perfectly for the holiday season — Antarctica #6 continues to delve deeper into its characters&#39; worlds, internal and external both. With many mysteries yet to be solved, readers can begin to discover the answers when the newest issue of Antarctica hits shelves December 13th from Top Cow and Image Comics.
