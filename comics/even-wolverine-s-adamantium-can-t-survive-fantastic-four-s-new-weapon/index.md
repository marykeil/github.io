# Even Wolverine s Adamantium Can t Survive Fantastic Four s New Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  The Fantastic Four&#39;s children accidentally invent a universal solvent that can eat through anything, including Wolverine&#39;s claws.   The solvent was created as a school project and ended up being a dangerous weapon that dropped in the Fantastic Four&#39;s lap.   Having a weapon that can permanently put down Wolverine is a good thing for the Fantastic Four due to their history with the X-Men and the potential for their relationship to deteriorate again.

## Literature Review

The Fantastic Four essentially just stumbled upon a powerful new weapon that could easily beat Wolverine&#39;s adamantium  - and that&#39;s a good thing. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Fantastic Four #16 A new weapon has just landed in the laps of the Fantastic Four, and it’s something that has never been seen before in the Marvel Universe: a universal solvent, capable of eating through even Wolverine’s adamantium claws.




In a preview for Fantastic Four #16 by Ryan North and Francesco Mortarino, Franklin Richards, his sister Valeria, and their friends are brainstorming about how they can take their science homework to the next level. Rather than doing some boring assignment, the kid-geniuses decide to do something that’s never been done before: invent a universal solvent.

          

          

          




          

          

          

The children come home from school, storm Reed’s laboratory for a few scientific items, and then set up their own make-shift laboratory, where they argue, test, and eventually succeed in creating the universal solvent. However, their invention works a little too well, as the liquid actually eats through the vial it was kept in, eating through each layer of the Baxter Building, without showing any signs of slowing down.




                  Move Over, Doctor Doom - Reed Richards Finally Has a Villain Who Equals His Genius   Fantastic Four just introduced a new villain that has the intelligence of billions, making it more of a challenge for Reed Richards than Doctor Doom.    


 The Fantastic Four’s Kids Accidentally Invented A Way To Kill Wolverine

The universal solvent was invented on a whim by these child-scientists just to test themselves at school, and while things inevitably went wrong in the end, they still accomplished what they set out to. Since the Fantastic Four didn’t have a direct hand in creating this substance, it’s effectively a weapon that just dropped in their lap (and through their building).




Franklin and Valeria may not have been able to control the universal solvent, but Reed Richards absolutely could. Not only that, he could weaponize it, and add this seemingly unstoppable substance to his family’s ever-growing arsenal of ultimate weapons.



 A Wolverine-Killing Weapon Is A Good Thing For The Fantastic Four To Have 
          

At the start of Dawn of X - during the House of X/Powers of X event - Reed and Sue don&#39;t hide their distrust in the mutants establishing their own nation on Krakoa. And they outwardly expressed their displeasure at Cyclops making vague threats regarding their then-mutant son, Franklin, as Scott alluded to the idea that the X-Men would essentially take Franklin to come live with them on Krakoa. Basically, not too long ago, the Fantastic Four and the X-Men were enemies. While that status quo has flipped, it could flip back in at any moment, so the Fantastic Four would be wise to be ready if/when it does.




House of X/Powers of X proved that the Fantastic Four can’t always trust the X-Men, so a weapon that could permanently put down their deadliest member, Wolverine, is a very good thing to have access to at a moment’s notice. And now, thanks to the scientific recklessness (albeit brilliance) of their kids, the Fantastic Four has just that, as the team’s new weapon can literally melt through anything - including Wolverine’s adamantium claws.

Fantastic Four #16 by Marvel Comics is available January 17, 2024.
