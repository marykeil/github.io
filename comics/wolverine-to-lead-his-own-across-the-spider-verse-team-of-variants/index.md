## Literature Review

X-Men mainstay Wolverine is the latest Marvel character to get his own Across the Spider-Verse as he teams up with multiversal variants of himself.




Wolverine is getting his own Across the Spider-Verse-style adventure in an all-new miniseries coming in 2024. Following the success of Spider-Man&#39;s Spider-Verse franchise (both the comics version and the movies), several Marvel characters have embarked on their own variant teams. Some more recent examples include Spider-Gwen getting her Gwen-Verse, and even Wolverine&#39;s rival Sabretooth teasing a Sabre-Verse at the end of his Exiles run.




Now, it&#39;s time for Wolverine to embark with his own team to shred through the mutant multiverse in Weapon X-Men #1, written by Christos Gage with art by Yiliway Cinar, according to an announcement from Marvel. Cover art by Dike Ruan can be viewed below. Weapon X-Men #1 is currently slated for a March 6 release date.



          

While there is still much to be revealed about the story itself and how Wolverine&#39;s current storylines could get us to this point in three months&#39; time, there is still much to speculate on and even more to be excited about. The variants teased on the cover alone leave a lot for readers to consider in the months building to the anticipated angle.

                  25 Deadliest Versions of Wolverine&#39;s Claws (Ranked)   Wolverine&#39;s claw have been upgraded, altered, and imitated numerous times. This list ranks 25 versions of the iconic claws in order of deadliness.    





 Wolverine Stars in Weapon X-Men #1, Coming March 6 
          

Marvel promises that this upcoming series will be spinning straight out of Gage and Greg Land&#39;s Original X-Men #1, which itself will be published this week. Original X-Men #1 will serve as a super-sized 60th anniversary one-shot commemorating when the X-Men first landed on comic book stands across the world. As such, the Phoenix recruits Professor X&#39;s original team to fix a time-displaced issue, which will turn into a multiverse issue going into Wolverine&#39;s four-part series. Wolverines from across the multiverse will have to team up to face someone who even the Phoenix fears.

As seen on the cover, readers can look forward to appearances from Wolverine from the Age of Apocalypse, Zombie Wolverine from Marvel Zombies, Wolverine from Earth X, and Old Man Logan. What might catch readers&#39; eyes the most is that the cover includes a brand-new mystery character who will be making her Marvel debut in this series: Jane Howlett from Earth-1281. In addition, Christos Cage teases in the original Marvel news story that the series will not only bring together several Wolverines from the multiverse, but the story will be &#34;moving from one alternate Earth to another.&#34;






 Wolverine&#39;s Bub-Verse is Upon Us 
          

The cover art includes many familiar variants from X-stories of the past, but the choices for each inclusion are rather intriguing. Particularly interesting is the inclusion of the Logan from Earth X, who, unlike his counterparts, is not an actual mutant. Instead, he&#39;s a descendant of the ancient primitive race, the Moon Clan, and spends most of the Earth X series as an overweight slob. Perhaps it&#39;s a sign of just how dangerous this new enemy is. Not only is this an enemy that the all-powerful Phoenix fears, but it&#39;s an enemy that demands the forces of as many Wolverines as possible to defeat, including the most obscure variants.



Weapon X-Men #1 will be available March 6 from Marvel Comics.
