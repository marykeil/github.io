## Literature Review

The Batmobile is a versatile car well-known in DC Comics, with some members of the Justice League having vehicles that match it in more ways than one.




The Justice League is DC Comics’ premiere superteam that has rostered dozens upon dozens of iconic heroes, with the majority of them commanding vast and varied power sets, unique technological advancements, and, of course, all sorts of cars, spaceships, shuttles, and planes that they consistently utilize to save the day. Of the most popular and legendary, Batman’s Batmobile is the blueprint for what an efficient and effective crime-fighting vehicle should be, with only a handful of other characters having something that comes close.
Whether utilizing its high-tech weaponry and defense systems, zipping through the streets of Gotham City at a breakneck pace, or cruising around town with a stylish design that only The Dark Knight can dream up and implement, the Batmobile is the pinnacle of superhero vehicles in the DC Universe, especially considering Batman, unlike a lot of his colleagues, can’t just fly, run, or transport himself wherever he wants, whenever he wants. But there are Justice League heroes who use differing modes of transportation and other kinds of vehicles when needed, some that are synonymous with their character, and some that rival the Batmobile.
            
 
 12 Cruelest Justice League Heroes in The History of The Team 
The Justice League is a beacon of hope in the DC Universe, with some members being so cruel it&#39;s a wonder they were ever allowed on the roster at all.












 








 12  Superman&#39;s Kryptonian Rocket Kept Him Safe During His Journey To Earth 
Action Comics #1 (1938)


 







A vehicle that&#39;s comparable to the Batmobile not because of its gadgets and firepower but due to the simple fact that it delivered DC’s shining beacon of hope, Superman, to Earth, Kal-El’s Kryptonian rocket ship was a last-ditch effort by his parents to save him from his exploding homeworld, and succeeded in its task by protecting baby Supes from the harsh conditions of space and his eventual entry into his new planet’s atmosphere. Keeping him alive, nourished, and, most importantly, safe during his journey, this ship debuted on the first panel of Action Comics #1 and has been seen in nearly every iteration of Superman’s origin ever since.





 11  Barry Allen&#39;s Cosmic Motorcycle Can Travel Through Time and Dimensions 
The Flash #6 (2011)
        

Driven by a variant of Barry Allen during Geoff Johns’ critically acclaimed 2010 run with the character, the Cosmic Motorcycle taps into the power of the Speed Force and essentially mimics a speedster’s time-traveling abilities while also being capable of sensing various kinds of temporal disruptions. Wrapped up in a stylish and highly street-illegal package, this version of Barry, going by the codename of Hot Pursuit, utilizes his Cosmic Motorcycle to travel across dimensions to warn Barry Prime of the then-upcoming Flashpoint, with it transforming into a much smaller, high-tech-looking tonfa when not in use.





 10  The Arrowcar Is Green Arrow&#39;s Version Of The Batmobile 
More Fun Comics #73 (1941)
        

Piggybacking on Batman’s shtick by naming everything he has after his superhero motif, Green Arrow’s Arrowcar (or Arrowplane as it’s originally and inexplicably called) has gone through more than a few iterations over the years, with its general look being something that resembles the Batmobile only with a brighter yellow color scheme. One of the fastest cars on the road, complete with gadgets similar to the base version of the Batmobile, the Arrowcar and its other models usually don’t last too long in comics, as Oliver Queen himself tends to destroy them for a variety of reasons.





 9  The Astro-Harness Is A Unique Vehicle Suited To The New God Orion 
New Gods #1 (1971)
        

Belonging to the New God and son of Darkseid known as Orion, this mode of transportation doubles as a weapon of mass destruction that puts him in the same power bracket as some of the strongest DC characters around. Able to self-repair in dire situations, produce a powerful shield (one that can even block Darkseid’s Omega Beams), reach untold speeds both on land and in space, and most destructively, shoot out beams of Positive and Negative Astro-Force energy to annihilate his foes, Orion is very rarely seen without his harness, making it synonymous with the character from his very first appearance.





 8  Lobo&#39;s Spacehog Helps Him Cash In Bounties All Across The Galaxy 
Omega Men #3 (1983)
        

Almost as iconic as the cigar-chomping anti-hero who rides it, “The Main Man” and intergalactic bounty hunter known as Lobo, this space cycle — or the “Spacehog” — has been a staple in Lobo’s history in one form or another since his inception way back in the 1980s. Looking like a heavily modified version of a Hell’s Angels-type of motorcycle, this bike complements Lobo’s biker gang style and is capable of traveling at ridiculous speeds while shooting missiles, brandishing machine gun attachments, housing Lobo’s sizable personal arsenal, and more, meshing well with Lobo’s over-the-top tendencies perfectly.





 7  Hawkman and Hawkgirl Rely On Their Thanagarian Star Cruiser 
The Brave and the Bold #34 (1961)
        

Utilized by the pairing of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, this interstellar Thanagarian starship, or “Hawk Cruiser,” acts as a sort of mobile base for these Justice League heroes during their ever-constant fight against evil and allows them to not only travel faster-than-light to any star system in the galaxy but also hosts a unique piece of tech dubbed the Absorbascon. A device that essentially lets Thanagarians read other living beings’ minds, the Absorbascon is only one of the many tech-based tools Hawkman and Hawkgirl have access to onboard.





 6  The House of Heroes Exists Outside Time And Space 
New Teen Titans #21 (1982)/The Multiversity #1 (2014)
        

A satellite with the unique ability to travel through the space between dimensions known as The Bleed, this reality-hopping vehicle was first used by The Monitor to keep an eye on all of creation pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths, a feat made possible thanks to its high-tech monitoring equipment and a sophisticated A.I. named Harbinger. Eventually, during Grant Morrison’s 2014 The Multiversity storyline, The House of Heroes was converted into the headquarters for the multiversal superhero team known as the Justice League Incarnate, where they continue to oversee the various universes that make up DC Comics today.





 5  Flash&#39;s Cosmic Treadmill Helps Speedsters Time Travel With Ease 
The Flash #125 (1961)


 







Developed by Barry Allen&#39;s The Flash in an attempt to more reliably travel through time, the Cosmic Treadmill technically doesn’t “move” in a traditional vehicle sense, yet helps to transport those who use it into the past, future, or, on occasion, different dimensions. Harnessing and charging cosmic rays depending on the intended destination, all Flash and his fellow speedsters have to do to utilize the Cosmic Treadmill to its fullest is program it to where they want to go, hop on for a quick jog, and end up in a different time and place entirely moments later.





 4  Rip Hunter&#39;s Time Sphere Allows Anyone To Mess With The Time Stream 
Showcase #20 (1959)


 







Another time travel-related vehicle that rivals the Batmobile, Time Master Rip Hunter constructed this vessel so that he and his team could right the wrongs of a timeline that always seems to need correction by allowing them to skip around the past, present, and future with ease and a purpose that became more of a responsibility than anything else. Stolen at one point by the Justice Leaguer known as Booster Gold, the Time Sphere allows anyone who knows how to operate its tech the keys to the timeline and was most recently seen in 2022’s critically acclaimed Flashpoint Beyond storyline.





 3  Blue Beetle&#39;s &#34;The Bug&#34; Is Basically A Flying Batmobile 
Captain Atom #86 (1967)
        

Built by the second Blue Beetle, Ted Kord, “The Bug” takes a page out of the Batmobile’s book by not only adhering to its owner’s signature superhero theme — in this case, Blue Beetle’s beetle motif — but is chock-full of enough gadgets and gizmos that would make The Dark Knight blush. Capable of flight, having reinforced defenses, and utilizing all kinds of nonlethal weapons like lasers, claws, and more in a fight, The Bug even houses its own mini crime lab, something that the Batmobile can’t say the same about.





 2  The Justice League&#39;s Javelin Ship Can Carry The Entire Team 
Justice League: The Animated Series Season 1 Episode 4 (2001)
        

Technically first introduced in the animated Justice League show from the early 2000s, the Javelin, or as it’s referred to in the show as the Javelin-7, is a Justice League vehicle that rivals the Batmobile thanks to its Batman-developed design and the simple fact that it can house the entire team during a particularly long commute to their next battle. An airborne vehicle capable of high-speed worldwide transportation, interstellar travel, and even underwater submersion, the Javelin eventually made the jump to comic continuity proper — like in 2020’s Justice League #44 — but isn’t seen nearly as much as its animated counterpart.





 1  Wonder Woman&#39;s Invisible Jet Is An Iconic Airborne Vehicle 
Sensation Comics #1 (1942)
        

Arguably the most popular Justice League vehicle next to the Batmobile, Wonder Woman’s Invisible Plane (or Invisible Jet, depending on its incarnation) is a staple mode of transportation that Diana uses for long-distance travel or when flying through the skies herself isn’t feasible. Able to turn invisible thanks to its unique cloaking abilities, this plane also utilizes a differing set of fighter jet-like weaponry depending on the situation and is one of the most formidable vessels ever commanded by a member of the League.
