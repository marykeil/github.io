## Literature Review

Blade will soon join the MCU, and ahead of his exciting debut, Marvel has taken the chance to clarify the vampire hunter&#39;s powers and abilities.




Marvel has officially explained Blade’s powers ahead of his forthcoming MCU movie and video game. Blade has been Marvel’s premiere vampire hunter for over 50 years, but for most of that time, his powers have been vague and ill-defined. Blade will soon make his MCU debut, as well as receive his own video game, and Marvel has taken this opportunity to clarify how Blade’s powers work.




In a post on Marvel’s website, the publisher gives fans a comprehensive overview of Blade’s origin, and nature as a Dhampir. The article recounts Blade’s vampire physiology, and how it was altered after a bite from Morbius. It also contextualizes Blade’s physical strength (so strong he can cut through the Hulk’s skin). Furthermore, fans learn that Blade has an excellent healing factor, one that has kept him alive for nearly a century.

          

The article pays special attention to Blade’s new shapeshifting ability to turn into mist, which he unlocks with Dracula’s help. Finally, it delves into some of the uses of Blade’s vampire bite. Marvel’s article also points out the new abilities he unlocked after his meeting with Dracula, powers that make him even more like a vampire than ever.





 Blade&#39;s &#39;Daywalker&#39; Powers Go Well Beyond A Vampire&#39;s 
          

Since his introduction in Tomb of Dracula #10, Blade has left a trail of vampire bodies across the Marvel Universe. After his mother was bitten while in labor, Blade received a host of vampire powers and none of their weaknesses. Brutal and unforgiving in his methods, Blade works from the shadows.

Marvel clearly lays out the extent of Blade’s abilities–and there are some surprises.

  Slowed aging   Ability to detect magic or supernatural   Super smell, super vision   Strong enough to lift 1,000 lbs   Super-speed in bursts   Healing factor to rival Wolverine&#39;s   Can deliver curses through a bite   Ability to absorb supernatural energies  

The article compares various aspects of Blade’s character, such as his strength and endurance, to other Marvel heroes and reveals he can hold his own with the publisher’s heaviest hitters. The article reveals that Blade is powerful and full of surprises, which helps make him Marvel’s best vampire hunter.






 Could Blade Truly Be One of Marvel&#39;s Most Powerful Heroes? 
          

Blade also occupies a unique spot in Marvel history: his 1998 feature film was Marvel’s first box office success, and a precursor to the comic book movie boom. After two sequels and a TV show, Blade will soon receive a reboot, starring Mahershala Ali, which will be set in the MCU. As Blade has developed as a character, his powers have changed, a fact Marvel’s article notes. After being bitten by Morbius, Blade gained additional powers, such as enhanced senses and super strength.

Some fans speculate Marvel changed Blade’s powers to match the movie version, as the story involving Morbius was published around this time. These changes to Blade’s powers stuck, and have become an integral part of his lore. Blade will return to theaters soon as part of the MCU, as well as headline his own video game from Bethesda, meaning now is the perfect time to clarify just how high he ranks in Marvel&#39;s roster of superhumans.
