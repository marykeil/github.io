## Literature Review

The Mutant Massacre is one of the most impactful events, creating ripples that can still be felt to this day. Here are 10 ways it shaped X-Men canon! 




X-Men’s Mutant Massacre event saw the brutal killings of nearly the entire Morlock society by the hands of the villainous team of mutant-killers called the Marauders. This event was easily the darkest in the X-Men’s already extensive Marvel Comics history up until that point, as it was one of the more violent depictions of a world where mutants were truly hated, where an entire society of mutants could be slaughtered like it was nothing, and humanity didn’t bat an eye.
The impacts that rippled from the Mutant Massacre (which was crafted by Chris Claremont, Louise Simonson, Walter Simonson, John Romita Jr., and Sal Buscema) are far more lasting than the stark truth of humanity’s wider apathy towards mutants as a whole, as the events of this tragedy actually helped shape X-Men lore for decades afterward, and can still be felt to this day. Here are the 10 ways the original 1980s Mutant Massacre reshaped the X-Men franchise.

 10  Mutant Massacre Began An Era Of Iconic X-Men Crossovers 
X-Cutioner’s Song, Age of Apocalypse, House of X/Powers of X, etc.


 







The Mutant Massacre is the first X-Men-specific event that was a true Marvel Comics crossover, as it stretched across every X-Men title at the time (X-Men, X-Factor, New Mutants) as well as other titles like Thor, Daredevil, and Power Pack. This fact alone is perhaps the most understated yet important impact of the event.
Its success sparked other successful crossover events like X-Cutioner’s Song, Age of Apocalypse, and - more recently - House of X/Powers of X, all of which impacted every X-Team as well as the wider Marvel Universe.





 9  Mutant Massacre Introduced One Of The Most Significant X-Men Villains Ever: Mr. Sinister 
Uncanny X-Men #212 by Chris Claremont and Rick Leonardi
        

Mr. Sinister’s debut in Uncanny X-Men #212 was little more than a mere mention before his full debut a few issues later. Sinister was significant in this storyline as the leader of the Marauders, and the one who ordered the titular mutant massacre of Morlock society itself - and his villainous legacy was only just beginning.
Not only has Sinister terrorized the X-Men for decades following this event, but he recently threw the entire Marvel Universe into chaos in the X-Men event Sins of Sinister. Plus, Mr. Sinister even sat on the Quiet Council of Krakoa, a choice that’s made even more controversial in retrospect of his involvement in the atrocity that corresponded with his very debut.





 8  X-Men’s Mutant Massacre Introduced The Famous Rivalry Between Wolverine &amp; Sabretooth 
Uncanny X-Men #212 by Chris Claremont and Rick Leonardi


 







The rivalry between Wolverine and Sabretooth is one of the more significant in X-Men canon, and retroactively stretches all the way back to Logan’s origin - before and during his forced involvement with Weapon X. However, before that was established, Wolverine’s rivalry with Sabretooth began right here, during the Mutant Massacre. Sabretooth was a member of Sinister’s Marauders, and led the charge in the slaughter of the Morlocks.
Not only did this storyline mark the beginning of Wolverine and Sabretooth’s famous rivalry, but it also established Sabretooth as a truly despicable villain, which is something that remained true all the way through the Krakoan era (including and especially when he was sentenced to the Pit during House of X/Powers of X).





 7  X-Men’s Mutant Massacre Marked Colossus’ First Kill 
Uncanny X-Men #211 by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr
        

Before this event, Colossus was a pretty innocent member of the X-Men. Bright-eyed, optimistic, and ready to be the hero he knew he could be, with a team of like-minded friends and family right there next to him. However, after he saw the carnage in the Morlock tunnels, Colossus was exposed to the true horrors of villainy in a way that he, quite frankly, wasn’t prepared to handle. After he got his hands on one of the Marauders responsible - a villain named Riptide - Colossus grabbed him by the throat and squeezed until the villain stopped breathing.
This moment was probably the most impactful in Colossus’ life, as it was the first time he killed a villain during a mission. It matured him, and opened him up to the cruel realities of being a superhero, something he carried with him even in the more recent continuity, as one of the mutant leaders on Krakoa.





 6  X-Men’s Angel Loses His Wings, Leading Him To Become Archangel 
X-Factor #10 by Louise Simonson and Walter Simonson
        

Warren Worthington III aka Angel is a founding member of the X-Men who became a member of the X-Factor (which consisted of the original five X-Men), and other than his debatable change in superhero teams, he’s stayed pretty consistent throughout his publication history up until this point. And then, Angel got captured by the Marauders, who crucified and tortured him, injuring Angel’s wings beyond repair. It was this moment that led to Angel eventually becoming the Horseman of Death for Apocalypse, who replaced his useless wings with deadly, synthetic ones.
Angel was a pretty boring character before Mutant Massacre, which led him down a path of anger, vengeance, and pain as Archangel, making him infinitely more interesting all the way through to the modern era of X-Men canon.





 5  Nightcrawler Teased The Full Extent Of Nimrod’s Threat Level 
Uncanny X-Men #194 &amp; #211 by Chris Claremont and John Romita Jr
        

Before the Mutant Massacre even began, the X-Men were at a major disadvantage that proved detrimental in their efforts to defeat the Marauders: Nightcrawler couldn’t teleport. Nightcrawler hadn’t recovered from the X-Men’s battle against Nimrod after Rogue temporarily stole Kurt’s powers to defeat the Sentinel. The fact that Nightcrawler couldn’t help at the start of this mission because of Nimrod - a villain whose impact was felt even in a story he wasn’t in - only teases the full extent of Nimrod’s threat level, which is something fans are very aware of today.
Nimrod has since become the biggest threat facing all of mutantkind in the history of X-Men canon, which is something that’s teased during the Mutant Massacre storyline, as that’s when the impacts of Nimrod’s initial attack is arguably felt the strongest.





 4  Gambit’s Involvement In The Mutant Massacre Has A Lasting Impact On His Character 
Uncanny X-Men #350 by Steve Seagle, Joe Maduriera, and Andy Smith
        

More than one hundred issues after the event itself, it’s revealed that Gambit was the one responsible for the Mutant Massacre - well, kind of. In truth, Gambit was hired by Mr. Sinister to form the team of Marauders who would kill the Morlocks by Sinister’s command. Gambit - having been a morally gray criminal and former member of the Thieves Guild at that point - made sure to find the worst of the worst for Mr. Sinister, the deadliest group of killers he could find. Unfortunately, Gambit came through a bit too well for the insidious villain, making the blood of everyone they killed on Gambit’s hands as well.
Even during the Krakoan era, there are still mutants - like Destiny - who don’t fully trust Gambit, and that mistrust is rooted in far more than the fact that he used to be a thief, but assuredly because of his involvement in one of the worst atrocities in X-Men lore.





 3  Psylocke’s Fight Against Sabretooth Made Her An X-Men Member 
Uncanny X-Men #213 by Chris Claremont and Alan Davis


 







When Psylocke first came to live at the X-Mansion, she wasn’t an official member of the X-Men. That is, until she faced off against Sabretooth during the Mutant Massacre event. This fight proved her mettle, especially to Wolverine, and after she helped to take Sabretooth down while he was attempting to attack the X-Mansion and kill the mutants within, Psylocke became an official member of the X-Men.
This not only launched Psylocke’s long-standing X-Men career, but it also proved that she’s capable of exceeding the expectations of others. Indeed, Psylocke eventually became Captain Britain, a title she still holds to this day, which is a huge upgrade from her previous status as just another X-Men member.





 2  Tensions Were Still High From The Mutant Massacre In The Krakoan Era 
Hellions #1 by Zeb Wells and Stephen Segovia
        

Scalphunter aka John Greycrow was one of the prominent members of the Marauders who was directly responsible for a great number of Morlock deaths during the Mutant Massacre, and the Morlocks on Krakoa never let him forget it. When the mutant nation was established, a group of Morlocks who either came to live on the island or were resurrected there sought out Greycrow on the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre, and tried to kill him just as he did to them all those years ago.
Even in an age of rebirth and redemption - one that saw fit to put the real cause of the Mutant Massacre, Mr. Sinister, on the Quiet Council - tensions were still high from that atrocity, making this one of the more pronounced examples of the Mutant Massacre’s lasting impact in X-Men canon.





 1  Almost No Other X-Men Tragedy Could Top The Mutant Massacre - Until 2023 
Hellfire Gala 2023 #1 by Gerry Duggan, Adam Kubert, Luciano Vecchio, Matteo Lolli, Russell Dauterman, Javier Pina, RB Silva, Joshua Cassara, Kris Anka, and Pepe Larraz
        

Above all others, the Mutant Massacre’s most notable legacy was the fact that it was arguably the greatest tragedy/loss of life that occurred in the mutant community - that is, until 2023’s Hellfire Gala. This Hellfire Gala saw Orchis - with Nimrod leading the charge - wiping out every member of the X-Men, then forcing the remainder of mutantkind off-world. This was the most atrocious massacre in X-Men history, and perhaps the only other one that could match it was the Mutant Massacre.
While these two events weren’t directly related, the Mutant Massacre set the bar for what mutantkind could endure, and it also warned of Nimrod’s threat level, given how impacted Nightcrawler was at the start of the Mutant Massacre event. And it’s for these reasons that the Hellfire Gala Massacre was influenced by the Mutant Massacre, making it perhaps the purest example of how the Mutant Massacre shaped the X-Men franchise in the modern era.
