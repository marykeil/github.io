## Literature Review

Captain Picard is a moral and astute leader, but he once almost got taken in by a time traveling con-man, and it now gets a call out.

Star Trek calls out Captain Picard’s most embarrassing blunder. As captain of the USS Enterprise, Jean-Luc Picard has faced down some of the cosmos’ biggest threats, including Q, the Cardassians and the Borg. Yet when Picard meets time-traveling con man Berlinghoff Rasmussen, he nearly gets one over on the captain. It was a rare moment of weakness for Picard, and now it gets a call-out in Star Trek: Defiant #10.

Star Trek: Defiant #10 is written by Christopher Cantwell and drawn by Mike Feehan and Pow Rodrix. On their way to Talos IV, the Defiant’s crew reviews Rasmussen’s file, and the ship’s Orion medic is incredulous. She has a hard time believing that the great Jean-Luc Picard was so thoroughly fooled by Rasmussen.

          

She goes on to express her admiration for Rasmussen’s scheme.





 It Takes a Lot to Fool Captain Picard 
          

Berlinghoff Rasmussen, introduced in the fifth season Star Trek: The Next Generation episode “A Matter of Time,” was a petty criminal from Earth’s 22nd century. Rasmussen met a time traveler from the 26th century. Stealing the traveler’s time ship, Rasmussen plotted a course for the 24th century. Boarding the Enterprise, Rasmussen attempted to steal technology, such as tricorders and phasers, planning to take them back to his own time and profit from them. Rasmussen was nearly successful in his plans, and came close to even kidnapping Data. The episode ends with Rasmussen’s time ship leaving him stranded in the 24th century.


 




Jean-Luc Picard is one of the greatest officers in Starfleet history. Possessed of a firm moral compass, Picard is a man of culture and learning as well. Rasmussen passed himself off as an archaeologist from the future, intent on “studying” a critical mission. Archaeology is also one of Captain Picard’s interests, and perhaps this was how Rasmussen gained his trust. Not until episode’s end did Picard begin to question Rasmussen’s story. Likewise, most of his senior staff did not question Rasmussen’s disguise. Rasmussen nearly gave Picard the slip, but quick thinking on Data’s part prevented this. Picard is astute, so for him to be taken in such a fashion is a huge deal.

                  Star Trek TNG Permanently Broke Picard&#39;s Brain   The comic miniseries Star Trek: The Next Generation - Perchance to Dream reveals that several intense TNG experiences are key to Picard&#39;s psyche.   



 Will Rasmussen Fool Worf the Way He Fooled Picard 
          




And now, Nymira, the Orion medic, calls out Picard, Worf and the rest of the Enterprise crew for being so easily fooled. Rasmussen pulled the wool over Picard’s eyes, a testament to his skills as a con man. If Rasmussen had been able to thoroughly fool Picard, he would have most certainly prevailed over lesser officers. Worf’s reaction to Nymira’s recounting of events shows that Rasmussen was not only an embarrassment to Picard, but to him as well. Jean-Luc Picard is one of the most intelligent people in the Star Trek universe, but one man was able to fool him: Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
