## Literature Review

Thanos knows how to give speeches and memorable quotes just as well as he knows how to wipe out universes. Here are some of his best lines. 




The Mad Titan, Thanos, is just as much a threatening orator as he is a force to be reckoned with. Thanos first debuted in 1973, but it wasn&#39;t until 1991&#39;s The Infinity Gauntlet storyline that the warrior was portrayed the imposing menace he remains today. While his strength, skill, and overall physical prowess are a big reason for this, it is the philosophy he upholds and the dialogue he uses to expound that philosophy that has helped him leave an impression on readers. Every ounce of rhetoric that leaves his lips proves to be as poetic as it is devastating.
Over the years, words full of gravitas spoken by Thanos have left the highest of Marvel&#39;s cosmic characters speechless in his presence, and brought all-powerful beings to their knees without him ever needing to throw a punch. Not every villain has the power to deliver such an impact through hefty monologues, while Thanos has consistently done so for fifty years now. Identifying his best quotes is a tall task; below are ten of his most iconic lines, those which make it clear to everyone how and why he has maintained his status as Marvel&#39;s greatest villain, sporting few as his equal.
            
 
 [SPOILER] Just Made Thanos&#39; &#34;I&#39;ll Do It Myself&#34; Quote As Cool As It Deserves to Be 
When faced with a choice on whether to unleash a devastating weapon, the X-Men&#39;s Storm puts a new spin on Thanos&#39; first line in the MCU.












 








 10  &#34;I, Alone, Have Looked Into The Darkened Corners Of Your Soul...&#34; 
Silver Surfer Vol 3 #50
        

This line cuts like a knife, but the reason he says it amplifies exactly how cold Thanos is at his core. A prelude to The Infinity Gauntlet, Silver Surfer Vol 3 #50 finds Thanos reanimating himself through space rock, then unleashing an unbridled attack on the Silver Surfer. With every blow, he puts the Mind Stone into practice, examining Surfer&#39;s past, proving they are more alike than expected. When Thanos learns Surfer&#39;s father is a disgraced academic, who killed himself after getting caught plagiarizing, he says: &#34;I, alone, have looked into the darkened corners of your soul ... and know you for what you truly are,&#34; laughing maniacally as he unearths the man behind Silver Surfer.
Released in June, 1991, Silver Surfer Vol 3 #50 was written by Jim Starlin, with art by Ron Lim. 






 9  &#34;Fools Taking Up Arms Against Omnipotence.&#34; 
Infinity Gauntlet #3


 







By the time the third issue of The Infinity Gauntlet rolled around, Thanos was fully aware that the heroes were compiling their forces in response to his growing power. Rather than meet this incoming brigade with apprehension, he was amused. &#34;Fools taking up arms against omnipotence,&#34; Thanos calls the heroes to Mephisto, slyly grinning. He continues. &#34;They rush head-on into Armageddon. So I shall provide them with a most glorious doomsday! The heavens will run red with blood. But in the end, as always, Thanos will stand triumphant.&#34; What&#39;s worse is that when the heroes finally battled Thanos, they truly did feel his wrath, just as he expected.
Infinity Gauntlet #3 was written by Jim Starlin, with art by George Perez. It was published in July 1991. 






 8  &#34;Death And I, We Have Been Waiting For You.&#34; 
Spider-Man Vol 1 #17
        

The last thing that anyone wants to see waiting for them at the Pearl Gates, when they get to the other side, is an 8&#39;3 hulking mass of a purple man, such as Thanos. However, that is exactly what Spider-Man encountered while on the brink of death. In Spider-Man Vol 1 #17, an attempt to save a little girl briefly cost Spider-Man his life. Awakening in the afterlife, Peter appeared in a religious graveyard of sorts, filled with fallen idols like himself. What shocked him more than his whereabouts, though, was the booming echo of Thanos, the newly appointed servant of Death, calling out with the ominous invitation: &#34;Come, Spider-Man, Death and I, we have been waiting for you.&#34;
Published in 1991, Spider-Man Vol 1 #17 was written by Ann Nocenti, with art by Rick Leonardi. 






 7  &#34;I Did Not Ask For Your Trust. I Demand Only Your Obedience.&#34; 
Secret Defenders #12
        

In Secret Defenders #12, when he needs help to conquer a monastery on the planet H&#39;Aarg in hopes of seizing an oracle, Thanos puts together a special team of supervillains. Among his surprising recruits is Geatar, someone who notoriously was a pawn in Thanos&#39; past schemes. When Geatar is understandably apprehensive, and even more understandably furious, Thanos makes one thing clear: &#34;I did not ask for your trust. I demand only your obedience.&#34; He barely gives Geatar an explanation for why he&#39;s there, or why he&#39;s needed, only insisting that he listens to Thanos&#39; every command whether this unwilling subordinate likes him or not.
Secret Defenders Vol 1 #12 was written by Ron Marz, with art by Tom Grindberg. It was released in December, 1993. 






 6  &#34;A Disciple Of Death... Versus A Lord of Destruction.&#34; 
DC Versus Marvel #2
        

A meeting between Thanos and Darkseid, two sides of the same coin hailing from two different universes, is a dream match made in hell. Appropriately enough, Marvel Versus DC offered dream matches galore when the two companies collided. The second issue offers a flurry of must-see match-ups, including Killer Croc vs. Wolverine, Bane vs. Captain America, Storm vs. Wonder Woman, Nightwing vs. Gambit, and yes, Darkseid vs. Thanos. The best of that last one takes place off-panel, but on-panel, Thanos&#39; words excited fans for the best fight they never actually saw: &#34;A disciple of Death... versus a Lord of Destruction. Tell me then, Darkseid... would you care to make a wager on the outcome?&#34;
Released in 1996, Marvel versus DC Vol 1 #2 was written by Peter David, with art by Claudio Castellini and Dan Jurgens. 






 5  &#34;The Past Is Dead. The Present, Annihilus, Is War.&#34; 
Annihilation: Silver Surfer #2
        

Annihilation: Silver Surfer #2 is where the Mad Titan and Annihilus, Lord of the Negative Zone, first get properly acquainted with each other. As villains do, they have a bit of banter with each other, during which Annihilus attempts to bring up Thanos&#39; failings with the Infinity Gauntlet. &#34;The past is dead,&#34; Thanos interrupts. &#34;The present, Annihilus, is war.&#34; Thanos is not one to dwell for too long on his successes or his failures. He would rather ruminate on the nature of the present, wherever the present takes him, even if it takes him into the trenches of an ongoing space war.
Released in May 2006, Annihilation: Silver Surfer #2 was written by Keith Giffen, with art by Renato Arlem. 






 4  &#34;At This Moment No Living Thing In The Universe Will Die&#34; 
Deadpool vs. Thanos #1


 







Not many things can defeat Deadpool&#39;s healing factor, but Thanos alone does a convincing job of making readers believe that he has the power to will Deadpool into a permanent death. It&#39;s all thanks to words like this: &#34;At this moment no living thing in the universe will die. Not the lowliest bacteria nor grandest Celestial. While stars collapse and implode, blown to dust all that possesses &#34;life&#34; refuses oblivion. All of it lives on despite its destiny, in defiance of the engine of evolution that culls the weak. All of it, Wilson, but you. I am the only reason you live. And because Thanos decrees it, you will die.&#34;
Published in 2015, Deadpool vs. Thanos #1 was written by Tim Seeley, with art by Elmo Bondoc. 






 3  &#34;A Fellow Poet Of Annihilation&#34; 
Eternals Vol 5 #2
        

If there is one thing that readers should gather from this list, it is that Thanos loves little more than destroying things, and the sight of destruction itself. If that isn&#39;t so evident, then Kieron Gillen&#39;s Eternals #2 should be a keen reminder of this fact. When the Eternals are facing a confrontation with the Mad Titan, the reasonable reaction readers might expect would be apprehensive. That is not the case from Ikaris, though, as they charge headfirst at Thanos. Thanos, ever the one for chaos, takes it as Ikaris&#39; invitation to their own destruction, something Thanos takes delight in. &#34;A fellow poet of annihilation. Fantastic. Let us trade verse.&#34;
Eternals Vol 5 #2 was written by Kieron Gillen, with art by Esab Ribic. It was released in February, 2021. 






 2  &#34;There Is No Poetry In You&#34; 
Eternals Vol 5 #11
        

Thanos&#39; journey continues throughout the Eternals series, with the Mad Titan eventually being accompanied by Druig as his new right-hand man. Except, of course, Thanos is perceptive enouh knows that one of Marvel&#39;s most hated villains can&#39;t be trusted. Among the many insults he throws at the would-be MCU hero, including &#34;backstabbing snake,&#34; Thanos tells him during Eternals #11 that, &#34;There is no poetry in you, and your attempts to pretend we share anything offends me.&#34; Thanos will not be fooled by Druig&#39;s attempts to please him, as he won&#39;t be appeased so easily wooed by the charm of a charmless man.
Eternals Vol 5 #11 is written by Kieron Gillen, with art by Guiu Vilanova. It was released in April, 2022. 






 1  &#34;Until I Am Ash And Bone, I Will Work Without End To Deny You. I Will Never Become You.&#34; 
Thanos Vol 2 #18


 







No one is spared from the harsh brutality of Thanos ... not even Thanos himself. He travels to a potential future where he becomes King Thanos after killing pretty much everyone, all to please Death. Unsurprisingly, Death still isn&#39;t pleased, but she calls for one last death: his own. Two versions of the Mad Titan fight in Thanos #18, with the younger one, winning as the elder Thanos begs for his death to please Death. The younger Thanos is disgusted at his future self&#39;s groveling, not only denying him of the death he wants, but declaring he will do everything in his power to prevent this future from ever happening for him, ensuring he never becomes King Thanos.
Thanos Vol 2 #18 was written by Donny Cates, with art by Geoff Shaw. It was release in April 2018.
