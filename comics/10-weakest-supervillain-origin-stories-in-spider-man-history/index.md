# 10 Weakest Supervillain Origin Stories in Spider-Man History


## SUMMARY 


 Some of Spider-Man&#39;s villains have some pretty goofy origin stories, such a man who becomes a kangaroo and a regular hippo who was turned into humanoid villain for...reasons. 
 Some villains, like Electro and Boomerang, had pretty uninspiring beginnings before becoming super-criminals and perennial adversaries for Spider-Man. 
 Spider-Man has faced off against some truly bizarre villains, including a living wall and a vampire with a questionable transformation story.

## Literature Review

Spider-Man has many iconic villains, in part because he has had so many villains throughout the years, some with weaker origin stories than others.




One of the most important parts of a comic book hero&#39;s mythos is their villains. Heroes are defined by truly great villains, and it&#39;s often agreed that the two characters with the greatest villains of all time are Batman and Spider-Man. Just about anyone, comic book readers or otherwise, can name several villains from these iconic heroes&#39; rogues gallery, but not all of these villains had fantastic origin stories.
Comic book origin stories are often pretty goofy, and Spider-Man&#39;s villains – especially those who first appeared during his formative years – are a great example of this, as is the Webslinger himself. Peter Parker was a young boy who went on a school field trip to a science lab and ended up being bitten by a radioactive spider. This resulted in him gaining significant superpowers, such as increased strength, agility, durability, and spider-sense. While some villains in Peter&#39;s rogues gallery have truly heartbreaking origins, a lot of them are even more absurd than Peter&#39;s origin, and these are the top 10 weakest Spider-Man villain origins.
            
 
 10 Ultimate Spider-Man Moments That Helped Marvel Websling Into the New Millennium 
The Ultimate Universe was created to modernize Marvel characters and storylines, &amp; Ultimate Spider-Man was the flagship. Here&#39;s the 10 best moments! 












 








 10  Electro (Maxwell Dillon) 
The Amazing Spider-Man #9


 







One of the most enduring Spider-Man villains is Electro. Maxwell Dillon was originally an average telephone pole operator, tasked with doing routine maintenance. There wasn&#39;t anything special about him, aside from the fact he was remarkably selfish, refusing to help save a fellow employee from a life-threatening situation without being paid first. One day, while Max was atop a telephone pole doing his job, he was suddenly struck by lightning. Having the current of the lightning running through his body at the same time as the telephone pole&#39;s electricity ended up giving him control over electricity, and he subsequently embarked on a career as a super-criminal.
The Amazing Spider-Man #9 was written by Stan Lee, with art by Steve Ditko, and Artie Simek.







 9  Kangaroo (Frank Oliver) 
The Amazing Spider-Man #81

        

Frank Oliver was a man who was absolutely obsessed with kangaroos. He could not get enough of them, being endlessly fascinated by their powerful legs and ability to jump. Because of this, he began living as a kangaroo. He ate the same food as kangaroos, jumped around like a kangaroo, did everything he could to gain their power. Eventually, he did. Frank then went on to become a professional boxer, but after jumping on his opponent and accidentally injuring them, potentially killing them, his life changed. Not wanting to be sent to prison for this, Frank fled to America and became the supervillain known as the Kangaroo.
The Amazing Spider-Man #81 came from the creative team of John Romita Sr, Stan Lee, John Buscema, Jim Mooney, and Artie Simek.







 8  Boomerang (Frederick Myers) 
Tales to Astonish #81

        

Plenty of people make a living in the Marvel Universe without turning to superheroics, or theatrics, but some people are eventually pushed into it due to circumstances. Frederick Myers was a young boy who was obsessed with baseball, and wanted nothing more than to become a professional player. Eventually, Frederick got his wish, and became a professional baseball player, but he lost it all when he decided to start taking bribes. Disgraced and banned from his dream job, Frederick Myers became the villain Boomerang; he began working for the Secret Empire, and later Kingpin. This would bring him into conflict with Spider-Man several times over the years.
Tales to Astonish #81 was written by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Bill Everett, and Sam Rosen.







 7  Hippo (Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins) 
Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2

        

Spider-Man tends to have a lot of animal-themed villains and Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins is a perfect example of that. Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins used to just be a regular hippo who hung out in a zoo, doing typical hippo things, such eating grass, and rolling around in the mud. For some reason, the High Evolutionary appeared and decided to evolve this hippo, transforming Mrs. Fluffy Lumpkins into a humanoid. Suddenly overcome with the desire for material possessions, Fluffy Lumpkins took on the villain name of the Hippo and began robbing banks, until she was promptly defeated by Spider-Man, in one of his more bizarre, if memorable, encounters.
Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man #2 by Brian Reed, Chris Bachalo, Tim Townsend, Jared K. Fletcher, and Antonio Fabela.

 6  Stegron (Vincent Stegron) 
Marvel Team-Up #19

        


Vincent Stegron was the medical assistant to Dr. Curtis Connors. The two were experimenting on dinosaur DNA that had been supplied from the Savage Lands. After Dr. Curt Connors transformed himself into a monster known as the Lizard, Stegron was inspired to follow suit, and used the dinosaur DNA he had in his possession, along with a vial of Connors lizard serum, to transform himself into a dinosaur hybrid. From this point on, Vincent simply went by the name Stegron, proving to be an occasional pain for Spider-Man. While not gaining the same notoriety as Curt Connors did, Stegron still appears now and then as a recurring threat.
Marvel Team-Up #19 was from the creative team of Len Wein, Gil Kane, Frank Giacoia, Glynis Wein, and Dave Hunt.







 5  Grizzly (Maxwell Markham) 
The Amazing Spider-Man #139


 







J. Jonah Jameson has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way during his long tenure running the Daily Bugle. One of the many people that he crossed was Maxwell Markham, a former professional wrestler who was famous for brutally taking down his opponents. Jameson ended up writing a scathing review of Maxwell, demanding the Wrestling Commission look into his conduct. After they did si, Maxwell was suspended from wrestling. Maxwell then spent ten years plotting his revenge; he eventually got his hands on an exoskeleton suit in the shape of a bear costume. He then returned to the Daily Bugle, attempting to murder Jameson, only to be stopped by Spider-Man.
The Amazing Spider-Man #139 was from the creative team of Gerry Conway, Ross Andru, Frank Giacoia, Dave Hunt, Jan Brunner, and Artie Simek.







 4  Big Wheel (Jackson Weele) 
The Amazing Spider-Man #183

        

Jackson Weele was a corrupt businessman, who stole tons of money from his company. To cover his tracks, he hired a criminal to steal the incriminating evidence; they were successful, but they kept the most damning evidence as blackmail. The Rocket Racer demanded an additional ten thousand dollars before he handed over the final piece of information. Unable to pay this, Jackson ended up turning to the Tinkerer, the same criminal who had built the Rocket Racer&#39;s gear. Jackson used the last bits of money he had to have the Tinkerer build equipment that transformed Jackson into Big Wheel, an extremely goofy villain. Big Wheel then sought revenge on Rocket Racer, nearly destroying New York in the process.
The Amazing Spider-Man #183 was by the creative team of Marv Wolfman, Ross Andru, Bob McLeod, Jim Novak, and Janice Cohen.







 3  Typeface (Gordon Thomas) 
Peter Parker: Spider-Man

        

Gordon Thomas was a Vietnam veteran who, upon coming back after the war, had his wife leave him and take their only son with her. Heartbroken, and with nothing left, Thomas became a signsmith. He managed to find some semblance of happiness again, but when his company was bought off, Gordon was let go. Furious at his hand in life – that everything he cared for had been taken from him – he decided to become a supervillain. To achieve this, he painted letters on his face and used weaponized letters of the alphabet. Typeface was a deceptively effective villain, defeating Spider-Man in their first encounter, despite how goofy he seemed at the conceptual level.
Peter Parker: Spider-Man was written by Paul Jenkins, with art by Mark Buckingham, Dan Green &amp; Rodney Ramos, Joe Rosas, and Troy P.

 2  Morbius (Michael Morbius) 
The Amazing Spider-Man #101

        

In a particularly underwhelming origin, Michael Morbius managed to transform himself into a vampire by accident, even though vampires are a real thing in the Marvel Universe. While experimenting in search of a way to cure his rare blood disease, Morbius ran experiments on vampire bats, which incorporated electroshock therapy. This combination, somehow, when applied to himself, transformed Morbius into a pseudo-vampire. He had all the strengths and weaknesses of a vampire, without technically being one. His hunger for blood would lead him into confrontation with Spider-Man, and he has returned to menace the Webslinger several times over the years.
The Amazing Spider-Man #101 was by the creative team of Roy Thomas, Gil Kane, Frank Giacoia, Artie Simek.







 1  The Wall (Joshua Waldemeyer) 
Spidey Super Stories #8


 







Spider-Man has fought all kinds of vicious villains in his time protecting New York City. He&#39;s gone up against tragic criminals and truly deranged serial killers, but by far the most bizarre villain that Spider-Man has ever faced off against was Joshua Waldemeyer. Joshua used to be a regular high school kid, working in a part-time job as a construction worker. For reasons that no one will ever know, the wall he was working on exploded and collapsed on him, transforming Joshua into a living wall. For equally mysterious reasons, Joshua then decided to ruin Spider-Man&#39;s day and attacked him at a local baseball game. The battle was quickly resolved, when the umpire threw both Spider-Man and the Wall out of the stadium.
Spidey Super Stories #8 was by the creative team of Jean Thomas, Win Mortimer, and Mike Esposito.
