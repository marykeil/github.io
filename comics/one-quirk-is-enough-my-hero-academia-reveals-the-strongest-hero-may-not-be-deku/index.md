Summary

  Bakugo&#39;s victory over All For One marks a crucial point in his character arc, showing his growth and belief in his own quirk and himself.   His victory is achieved through his ingenuity and understanding of his quirk, avoiding clichéd power-ups.   All For One&#39;s defeat is a result of the collective efforts and sacrifices of numerous heroes, highlighting the importance of unity and relying on others as Bakugo acknowledges that he couldn&#39;t have won alone.  







With All For One on the cusp of defeat, My Hero Academia has revealed its strongest hero, and it isn&#39;t Deku, but Bakugo, Deku&#39;s biggest rival. In fact, the epic climax of the showdown between All For One and Bakugo in the latest chapter proves his arc may be better than Midoriya&#39;s with a singular phrase.

Chapter #409 of My Hero Academia reveals Bakugo has all but taken down All For One, and with what may be one of his most powerful lines in the series. Though faced with a massive swirl of every quirk in All For One&#39;s possession, Bakugo manages to take down All For One with a massive, well-timed Howitzer Impact, claiming he only needs his &#34;one quirk&#34; as he does so.

          

Unassuming as they may seem, Bakugo&#39;s simple words, &#34;the one quirk I&#39;ve got is enough,&#34; hold a whole new world of meaning beyond simply mocking All For One, especially when seen from the context of Bakugo&#39;s character growth thus far and his history of inferiority issues.




               :   All Might&#39;s Final Gift Proves Deku Is Not His Most Important student   My Hero Academia&#39;s ultimate evil nearly tore All Might in half, but one protégé has proved he&#39;s more vital than Deku &amp; deserves what he&#39;s wanted most.   


 Bakugo&#39;s Character Arc Finally Comes Full Circle 
          

Bakugo&#39;s affirmation of belief in his own quirk and himself in chapter #409 represents the culmination of his character arc. Not only has Bakugo been constantly trying to catch up to Deku and bridge the gap between them, but Bakugo&#39;s feelings of envy towards Deku being chosen to inherit One For All are also well known which further makes his confidence in himself and his quirk all the more impactful.

Despite Bakugo&#39;s initial introduction as a bully, he has had one of the most nuanced character arcs in My Hero Academia, eventually going on to accept that his hostility stemmed from his feelings of inferiority towards Deku and a fear of not being able to catch up to him even when Deku was quirkless. Bakugo has since been constantly forced to acknowledge the gap between him and Deku, especially during the Final War where his initial defeat against All For One drove the point home, which makes his current triumph even sweeter.




               :   Bakugo Wasn&#39;t a Real Hero Until One of His Darkest My Hero Academia Arcs   Bakugo&#39;s lowest moment in My Hero Academia was essential to him becoming a real hero because it forced him to reflect on his behavior.   



 Bakugo&#39;s Victory Sidesteps Shonen Clichés 
          

What makes Bakugo&#39;s win feel organic is simply that it avoids giving Bakugo a stereotypical awakening or inexplicable power-up to achieve this victory. Instead, it is arguably Bakugo&#39;s understanding of his quirk that widens, opening up new possibilities for him to explore. Bakugo manages to defeat All For One using this very ingenuity by taking advantage of All for One&#39;s raging emotions to strike discreetly.

Moreover, the victory over All For One is also the culmination of the efforts and sacrifices of countless heroes who have stood in his path before Bakugo, including Tokoyami, Hawks, All Might, and countless others who slowly chipped away at All For One&#39;s armor. Thus, in a way, Bakugo&#39;s biggest victory in the series completes his journey toward learning to work together and rely on other people, finally overcoming one of his biggest flaws as he too admits he would not have been able to defeat All For One alone in chapter #409.




Nonetheless, My Hero Academia&#39;s Final War has given Bakugo the chance to shine like never before, bringing the complexities of his character and his journey to the forefront. Bakugo&#39;s sheer determination throughout, even while on the brink of death, has irrevocably proved that he may be just as great of a hero as Deku, if not greater, even with only one quirk.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
