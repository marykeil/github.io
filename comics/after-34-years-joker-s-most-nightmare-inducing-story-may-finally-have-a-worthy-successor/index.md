## Literature Review

A new Joker storyline by Chip Zdarsky is taking the villain back to his origin, in a story that has the potential to be his scariest in decades.




The Joker has given DC some of their most haunting stories, including The Killing Joke and his portrayal in the &#34;New 52&#34;. His role in Grant Morrison and Dave McKean&#39;s 1989 horror classic Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth has held up for nearly 34 years as perhaps the scariest Joker tale. Now, the first teaser for a new Joker story is drawing major comparisons to Arkham Asylum.




On his Substack, writer Chip Zdarsky shared a first-look at his next big Joker story, The Joker: Year One. The artwork for the announcement is absolutely terrifying, as a lightwashed Joker is shown with his haunting smile, the shadows from the light source making his eyes appear vacant and black.



          

This terrifying new arc – written by Chip Zdarsky, with art by Giuseppe Camuncoli and Andrea Sorrentino – will be featured in Batman #142-144, and based on early descriptions of the story, it looks like it will be a perfect new glimpse at the villain&#39;s horrifying origins, while also venturing &#34;some time into the future.&#34;


 The Joker: Year One Will Redefine Joker&#39;s Backstory 
         




The preview image shared by Zdarsky looks like something an unfortunate photographer shot before meeting their fate at the hands of the villain, and it succeeds in being incredibly creepy as a result. Zdarsky, Camuncoli and Sorrentino seem to be taking a page from Paul Dano and Stevan Subic&#39;s The Riddler: Year One for this creepy update to the Joker&#39;s backstory. The series will feature haunting new artwork to match the mood, in addition to a story that gives fans new insight into the Caped Crusader&#39;s most iconic antagonist. Zdarsky also mentioned in his announcement that Joker: Year One will hop between two time periods as &#34;Batman tries to unravel a mystery.&#34;

During his investigation, Batman will learn more about his adversary as the story gives readers a glimpse at &#34;the period directly after the Joker&#39;s creation in the chemical vat.&#34; The fact that Year One is going to take fans back to a time that has been explored over-and-over hints that there will be some major reveals lying in wait, and it could change what readers thought about the notorious criminal for years to come. When looking back for Joker arcs to compare this upcoming story to, Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth is the first one that came to many long-time DC readers&#39; minds.






 The Joker&#39;s New Horror Story Has A Lot to Live Up To 
         

When looking back at the Joker&#39;s role in Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the team behind The Joker: Year One will have a lot of work ahead of them to match the creepy vibes of the 1989 classic. The Joker in that comic was showcased as an ethereal madman as he subjected Batman to a horrific night in Arkham against his deadliest enemies. He&#39;s the chaotic mind behind the madness, and it provided fans with one of the scariest DC stories for decades. However, based on the few details provided for Year One, the new arc will likely live up to the hype.

By giving an updated origin story, it&#39;s a perfect opportunity for Zdarsky, Camuncoli and Sorrentino to mold the Joker into the monster he would become as he navigates his new life. This could lend itself to some incredibly creepy artwork as the Clown Prince of Crime becomes an existential threat to Gotham itself. The Joker has given fans some of DC&#39;s darkest stories because of his twisted sense of humor, allowing for artists to take the character&#39;s crimes to some horrific places. Now, this new Joker story has the potential to become the scariest arc surrounding the character in 34 years as it sets itself up to be a worthy successor to Arkham Asylum.
