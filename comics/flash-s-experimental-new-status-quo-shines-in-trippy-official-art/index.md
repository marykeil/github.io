## Literature Review

James Stokoe’s variant cover for the upcoming Flash #6 perfectly captures the strange cosmic journey Wally West is undergoing in his current run.




Nothing says more about the odd era the Flash is currently experiencing than a trippy new piece of cover art. DC Comics&#39; newest batch of solicitations has given fans a peek at what lies ahead for next February, including variant covers. The alternate cover art for The Flash #6 perfectly captures the title&#39;s fun but incredibly strange vibe.




February sees the DC Universe return to normal after it moves past its epic &#34;Beast World&#34; crossover. Unfortunately for the Fastest Man Alive, The Flash continues to follow Wally West as the strange unknown parts of the DCU continue to complicate his life. A variant for The Flash #6 by James Stokoe sums up the weird adventures the Scarlet Speedster has been through lately. The alternate cover art shows Flash running along fragmented color tiles as the cosmic explorers the Stillness and the terrifying monster the Uncoiled surround him. There&#39;s also a field of eyeballs in the background, disturbingly looking in every direction.



          



  The Flash #6   Release Date: 2/27/24   Writer: Si Spurrier   Artist: Mike Deodato, Jr. and Trish Mulvihill   Cover Artist: Mike Deodato, Jr. and Trish Mulvihill   Variant Cover Artists: Mike Deodator, Jr., James Stokoe, and Matt Taylor   Synopsis: After the shocking ending of last issue, Wally West’s world has been completely upended—and as he quite literally is putting the pieces together, The Stillness’s attempts to reach out to a higher power are answered. Lace up your boots as the first arc of the critically-acclaimed new era for the Scarlet Speedster concludes!  





 The Flash Variant Cover Captures the Oddest Era in DC History 
          

During the Dawn of DC initiative, the publisher gave The Flash a fresh start with a brand-new creative team. This new era of Wally West&#39;s life began in The Flash #800, which saw the Flash develop a new dimensional shift power after crashing through an atomic mirror. The current Flash title has followed how this has affected Wally. Not only is he phasing into different layers of reality, but he&#39;s discovering new cosmic entities all around him. Some are seemingly benevolent, like the giant collective the Stillness. Others are horrific killers, such as the twisted and dangerous-looking Uncoiled.

While it&#39;s only been a few issues, it&#39;s obvious that the current Flash run is one of the most experimental it&#39;s been in some time. Sure, it&#39;s got standard superhero fare such as Wally taking on his usual foes such as Gorilla Grodd. But the title has seen Wally experience sights and feelings he&#39;s never seen before. He&#39;s seen villains that can step in and out of reality like it was nothing and explorers that defy comprehension. While the latest era is only starting to spread its wings, it already has several offbeat factors that help solidify its identity. Stokoe&#39;s variant is the perfect representation of what this new saga has been building.






 The Flash is in His Most Bold, Experimental Era Yet 
          

It&#39;s still early in this new chapter of the Scarlet Speedster&#39;s history, but it&#39;s been an undeniably innovative run so far. Between giving Flash a power that allows him to explore wild, unseen layers of reality and giving him strange cosmic allies and enemies, there&#39;s a lot of originality to be found. Stokoe&#39;s variant only provides a taste of what readers can expect from the current Flash run, but it does a fantastic job of setting the stage. Anyone curious readers wondering if they should take a look at the current Flash title need only look at James Stokoe&#39;s amazing cover art.

The Flash #6 will be available from DC Comics on February 27, 2024.
