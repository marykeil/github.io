## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Stormbreakers 2023 class of artists will assemble the most badass possible team with a series of variant covers, for issues coming in 2024.




Wolverine and Spider-Punk are among the hardcore line-up teased by the team-up piece produced by Marvel&#39;s 2023 class of Stormbreakers, its most invigorating young artistic talents. With eight variant covers dropping across January and February 2024, this exciting crop of artists will assemble not only a tribute to earlier Marvel creatives, but also one of the most badass possible teams Marvel could possibly put together.




The Stormbreaker variant covers will include Chris Allen&#39;s Spider-Punk variant cover for Edge of Spider-Verse #1 – coming February 21, 2024 – and Martin Coccolo&#39;s variant cover for Wolverine #42, which will be released on January 31, 2024.



          

The full roster of characters featured on the Stormbreaker variant covers, when put together, offers a look at a team that would blow the doors off the Marvel Universe, were it to come together for a story, beyond their combined appearance in the Stormbreakers&#39; highlight series.


 Marvel&#39;s Stormbreakers Deliver A Dream Team In Variant Covers 
         




Inaugurated in 2020, Marvel&#39;s &#34;Stormbreakers&#34; program is the successor to its &#34;Young Guns&#34; initiative, a developmental program for the company&#39;s top artists. The most recent class of Stormbreakers are: Chris Allen, Jan Bazaldua, Elena Casagrande, Martin Coccolo, Nic Klein, Federico Vincenti, C.F. Villa, and Lucas Werneck. Each artist provided a variant cover for an upcoming Marvel release, spanning their most important titles, from the X-Men and Spider-Man franchises, to the Avengers. Together, the characters across the eight covers in the series unite to form a highly powered, highly dangerous – and certainly, highly entertaining team, which fans would be more than eager to see in action.

Spider-Punk is a fan-favorite variant of Spider-Man, while Spider-Boy is a mysterious new addition to Peter Parker&#39;s life. Spider-Gwen has carved out a massive fan-base for herself since debuting in 2014. Magneto is soon to be resurrected, just as Scarlet Witch is set to begin a new limited series, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and Cable is beginning a new volume as well. Factoring in Wolverine and Captain America, all of these characters are either already mainstays of the Marvel Universe – each preparing to play their most pivotal roles yet – or members of the next generation of Marvel heroes, ready to take center stage, and not yield it easily.






 Spider-Punk And Wolverine Need To Team-Up ASAP 


          





Spider-Punk first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #15, by writer Dan Slott and artist Olivier Coipel. He recently appeared in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, voiced by Daniel Kaluuya.




There are many fascinating potential character dynamics at play in this eclectic mix of Marvel characters new and old – from Magneto and Scarlet Witch&#39;s family drama, to Captain America&#39;s perhaps futile attempts to keep the team on the straight-and-narrow, to Wolverine&#39;s interactions with young, and iconoclastic, new heroes like Spider-Boy and Spider-Punk, respectively. Spider-Punk and Wolverine in particular should be given a chance to interact as soon as possible; whether Wolverine would appreciate Spider-Punk&#39;s anarchic spirit, or find him to be a pretentious loud-mouth, fans of both characters can only speculate until Marvel throws them together in an upcoming story.




Marvel&#39;s Stormbreaker variant series begins with the release of Captain America #5, featuring Jan Bazaldua&#39;s variant cover, on January 3, 2024.
