## Literature Review

In celebration of the new Wolverine: Madripoor Knights series, it&#39;s time to take a look at the classic X-Men story that started it all back in 1990...




Uncanny X-Men #268 was an important issue in writer Chris Claremont’s classic run, giving readers a glimpse of Wolverine’s mysterious past by showing his first meeting with Captain America during World War II. With the storyline set to be directly continued in the new Wolverine: Madripoor Knights series from Claremont and Edgar Salazar, now is the perfect opportunity to revisit the original landmark issue and what made it so special.






Uncanny X-Men #268 – from the creative team of Chris Claremont, Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Glynis Oliver and Tom Orzechowski – was released in 1990.




Uncanny X-Men #268 tells two intertwined stories: one is set in the present featuring Wolverine, Black Widow, Psylocke and Jubilee, while the other takes place during World War II, giving readers some early insight into Logan&#39;s backstory, as well as his first meeting with Captain America.



          

The present-day storyline features Black Widow on assignment from Nick Fury to foil a plot between HYDRA and the Hand in Madripoor. Meanwhile, the story in the past sees Logan and Captain America teaming up to save a young Natasha Romanoff from being kidnapped by the Hand, who seek to train her into becoming one of their ninja assassins.





 Uncanny X-Men #268 Features Captain America And Wolverine&#39;s First Meeting 
          

Uncanny X-Men #268 is perhaps most important for the way it offers a tantalizing glimpse into Wolverine’s past. At the time, Logan’s origin hadn’t yet been revealed, and Marvel played up his status as a “man of mystery” by hinting that the character was far older than he appeared. Revealing that he was around during WWII, looking much the same as he did in the present, only served to fuel further speculation over Logan’s mysterious origin. Fans were eager for any clues they were given, in order to piece together the character’s backstory. With its cavalcade of guest stars, the issue also served as a highlight for collectors and crossover fans alike.

When her mission gets too heavy to handle alone, Black Widow enlists Wolverine, Psylocke and Jubilee when the action gets too heavy to handle alone, while the issue also includes villains such as HYDRA’s Baron von Strucker, the Fenris Twins and the Hand. Though the story is memorable, what really makes Uncanny X-Men #268 iconic is the contribution of Jim Lee, who was quickly becoming the hottest artist in comics at the time of the issue&#39;s release, thanks to his work on Punisher: War Journal and Uncanny X-Men. After drawing several well-received issues of the series, issue #268 began Jim Lee’s tenure as the regular penciller on Uncanny X-Men.






 Uncanny X-Men #268 Is Among Superstar Artist Jim Lee’s Best Work 
         

Jim Lee&#39;s Uncanny X-Men run would eventually propel the artist to “superstar” status, making the future DC Comics president popular enough to eventually break away from Marvel a few years later to form Image Comics. Coupled with Scott Williams’ polished inks and Glynis Oliver’s moody color palette, Uncanny X-Men rarely looked better than when Jim Lee was drawing it, and issue #268 represents some of his very best work on the series. As a classic issue, the story has been revisited a few times throughout the years – with original writer Chris Claremont&#39;s upcoming sequel being the latest, most exciting return.



Wolverine: Origins #16 was written by Daniel Way, with art by Steve Dillon, color by Matt Milla, and lettering by Randy Gentile. It was released in 2007.







Wolverine: Origins #16 retold the events of the issue, filling in some of the gaps of Logan and Captain America’s first meeting. Notably, the story was also very loosely adapted as an episode of the 1990s X-Men: The Animated Series, bringing Captain America in as a guest star in that mega-popular cartoon adaptation. Now, the story is set to be revisited again in Wolverine: Madripoor Knights, as Chris Claremont returns to tell another story about Logan, Captain America and Black Widow, with original artist Edgar Salazar returning as well. X-Men fans both old and new should revisit the classic Uncanny X-Men #268 to prepare.

Woverine: Madripoor Knights #1 will be available February 7, 2024 from Marvel Comics.
