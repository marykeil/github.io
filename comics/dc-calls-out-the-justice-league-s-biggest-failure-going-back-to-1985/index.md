## Literature Review

Superman discovers he Justice Leagueâ€™s inability to stop multiverse-wide calamities is having serious consequences when one world suddenly disappears.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1061!The biggest Justice League failure has finally built to a point where the entire multiverse is suffering. Superman&#39;s most unexpected nemesis Bizarro makes his return after a long absence, and he&#39;s furious over a problem that has only been getting worse since the original Crisis on Infinite Earths.




In Action Comics #1061 by Jason Aaron and John Timms, Bizarro invades the Sorcerer&#39;s World, the nexus point of all magic. Bizarro is in pain as he rages against the magical forces all around him. But the Sorcerer&#39;s World&#39;s defenses do nothing but give the backward Superman a powerful, magical upgrade.

          

A month and a half later, Bizarro attacks Superman and lets the Man of Steel know that Bizarro World has gone missing. Bizarro reveals that the endless Crises and catastrophes have resulted in Bizarro World&#39;s disappearance. After his struggle with Bizarro, Superman discusses the situation with Barry Allen and discovers that Bizarro World is gone and is officially listed as a missing world.


 DC&#39;s Endless Crises Just Erased a Classic World 
          




The DC Universe may be guarded by thousands of superheroes, but even combined they can&#39;t stop one event from occurring every so often. &#39;Crisis&#39; is a catch-all term for an event that involves numerous universes and often includes the death or rebirth of worlds. The most famous Crisis is, of course, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the massive DC event that incorporated fifty years of history that led to a simplified, streamlined universe (albeit at the expense of countless other realities). Since then the multiverse has expanded, especially as other Crisis events came around to make further adjustments to the wider DC Universe.

Losing Bizarro World wouldn&#39;t be the first time an iconic realm had gone missing. Crisis on Infinite Univese lost thousands of worlds. Flashpoint changed the makeup of the rebooted 52 universe. The cosmic shuffling and reshuffling of the endless Crises was bound to have some sort of effect and unfortunately for Bizarro, his world was one of the first to fall. While the Justice League and the rest of DC&#39;s heroes have been reactive to these massive, universe-changing events, they haven&#39;t been exactly proactive in stopping them. Sure, they always wind up winning in the end, but their inability to stop Crisis-level events is now having very real consequences on the multiverse.






 Other DC Realities Are At Serious Risk of Disappearing 
          

To the Justice League&#39;s credit, they&#39;ve taken steps to try to combat the huge ramifications caused by Crises. But they&#39;ve never been able to stamp them out completely. As of right now, it&#39;s just Bizarro World that&#39;s missing, but who&#39;s to say these repeating fluctuations to the DC multiverse won&#39;t wind up destroying other Earths? Even worse, what if this isn&#39;t an accident, but a deliberate attack by someone taking advantage of the chaos brought on by the endless rearrangement of the multiverse? The Justice League needs to seriously step up because Bizarro World could just be the first in a chain of missing worlds.

Action Comics #1061 is on sale now from DC Comics.
