Summary

  Bizarro&#39;s new magical powers make him a serious threat to Superman, and he uses them to turn Metropolis against the Man of Steel.   Bizarro casts a spell that transforms every citizen in Metropolis into a Bizarro version of themselves with a frothing hatred for Superman.   By reversing the city&#39;s admiration and love for Superman, Bizarro has successfully turned Metropolis upside down and poses a significant challenge for the Man of Steel.  







Now that Bizarro&#39;s homeworld is gone, he has set out to hurt Superman unlike ever before — by turning Metropolis upside down. Countless villains have tried to bring down Superman over the years, but the one villain that he&#39;s never really had to take seriously was Bizarro. Despite the physical threat that Bizarro poses, he was never actively evil. But now everything has changed, mostly due to Bizarro&#39;s impressive new magical form.

The full extent of Bizarro&#39;s plan is revealed in Action Comics #1061 by Jason Aaron and John Timms. After Bizarro&#39;s world is seemingly destroyed by the continual upheavals of the DC Universe, Bizarro makes his way to Earth, armed with new magical powers, and begins casting a spell over the city of Metropolis.

          




While Superman tries to reason with Bizarro, Bizarro&#39;s new power upgrade makes him far stronger than Superman can handle. Despite Superman&#39;s best attempts, Bizarro succeeds in casting his spell, which turns every citizen in Metropolis into a Bizarro version of themselves, all with a frothing hatred of the Man of Steel.

                  &#34;Darker &amp; Scarier&#34;: After 65 Years, DC Is Finally Fixing Superman&#39;s Most Wasted Villain   Bizarro is one of Superman&#39;s most recognizable — and goofiest — villains. Now DC promises that he&#39;s being taken in a much darker direction.   


 Bizarro Superman Casts a Powerful Spell Over Metropolis 
          

Even among supervillains, the Bizarros are a strange case. They come from all over, and their origins have changed often over the years. Lex Luthor has created Bizarros as clones of Superman; there have been Bizarros created by the Joker; Bizarros have come from different planets. While the &#34;alien Bizarro&#34; is the most common, each version shares a similar trait. Bizarros tend to speak completely backwards, and they tend to act backwards as well. This can make communicating with a Bizarro pretty difficult. But this unique characteristic is exactly why Bizarro&#39;s latest plan is so devastating. In a city that absolutely adores Superman, if all the citizens become Bizarro, then their feelings for the Man of Steel are also reversed.




The exact rules of Bizarro&#39;s spell aren&#39;t known yet, but the effects seem obvious. All the citizens of Metropolis, including Lois Lane, are suddenly transformed into Bizarro versions of themselves and immediately begin tearing apart any Superman-related memorabilia around them. The people of Metropolis absolutely love Superman; they see him as one of the greatest heroes to ever live. So, having those feelings suddenly inversed is going to literally turn the entire city against the Man of Steel. This is how Superman&#39;s silliest villain has just beaten him in a way that even the likes of Lex Luthor never managed. Bizarro has officially turned Metropolis against the Man of Steel.



 Metropolis Has Been Turned Upside Down 
          

Superman has dealt with magic before, but never on this level. Every single citizen, including his loving wife, has been transformed into opposite versions of themselves. Their admiration and love for their greatest hero seem to have been transformed into a seething hatred. Bizarro lost his world due to the constantly shifting DC Multiverse, and as revenge, he has taken away Superman&#39;s world by shifting it into something else. Superman has always inspirec hope and pushed people to be better versions of themselves. Now, because of Bizarro, every citizen in Metropolis wants to tear Superman apart.
