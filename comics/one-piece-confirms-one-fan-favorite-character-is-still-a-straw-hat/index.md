# One Piece Confirms One Fan-Favorite Character Is Still a Straw Hat


## SUMMARY 



  Yamato&#39;s appearance on the cover page confirms that they are still considered a Straw Hat at heart, despite not officially joining the crew in the Wano arc.   The cover splash pages in One Piece are not canon but are used to show the Straw Hats having fun together. Yamato&#39;s presence on the page signifies their connection to the crew.   Fans can hope that Yamato will eventually reunite with the Straw Hats and sail with them after the safety of Wano is ensured. However, this may not happen until the end of the series.

## Literature Review

One Piece just confirmed that the popular character Yamato from Wano is a Straw Hat at heart even if they didn&#39;t officially join the crew.




A recent cover splash page for the One Piece manga proves that a fan-favorite character who didn&#39;t end up joining the crew, Yamato, is still a Straw Hat at heart. This should be great news for many fans who were disappointed by the end of Yamato&#39;s story in Wano. It also hints that this character may have a more important role later in the series.




The splash page cover for chapter #1103 is a beautiful image by Eiichiro Oda showing the Straw Hats celebrating with Momo and Yamato from the Wano arc, eating a lot of great food and flying through the sky of Momo&#39;s flame clouds. This page seems to be celebrating the imminent arrival of the year of the Dragon, as Momo is a dragon and 2024 has just begun.

          

However, while Yamato is deeply connected to Momo as both were central figures in the Wano arc, this doesn&#39;t fully explain why they would have an appearance here with all the other Straw Hats. The reason for this is that like with the popular Straw Hat Vivi, Momo and Yamato are both potential additions to the crew who couldn&#39;t officially join them at sea due to extenuating circumstances.



Yamato remained in Wano to protect the country from outside threats.








 One Piece&#39;s Color Spread Confirms Yamato is a Straw Hat 
          

These cover splash pages have produced some of the coolest images in the manga&#39;s history, even if they generally aren&#39;t canon. They also are used mainly to show the Straw Hats having fun together in a variety of situations and locations. Other characters can occasionally appear in these splash pages if they fit a certain theme, but this is generally pretty rare. Thus Yamato appearing in the splash page shows that even though they didn&#39;t officially join the crew at the end of Wano like many fans wanted, they are ultimately still a Straw Hat at heart. This could also apply to Momonosuke, although since he fits the Dragon theme, it&#39;s a bit more tenuous.

Many fans felt that Yamato not joining the crew at the end of Wano was a bait and switch on Oda&#39;s part, given how it seemed he was being set up to do so. While the anime may have handled the ending of Wano a bit better, there was still some ambiguity about whether Yamato was still counted as a Straw Hat like Vivi or if he was just counted as an ally to the crew. This spread seems to confirm that Yamato has joined the crew in spirit even if he has never sailed the seas with the Straw Hats like his idol Oden did with Gol D. Roger.






 Yamato Needs to Reunite With the Straw Hats in One Piece 
          

This spread gives fans hope that Yamato will one day reunite with the Straw Hats and maybe sail with them after Momo and the rest of Wano are safe from outside threats. This unfortunately may not occur until the end of the series, for as long as the World Government exists it will be a danger to Wano. However, One Piece fans can still take some comfort that Oda hasn&#39;t forgotten Yamato and has basically confirmed that they are still an honorary member of the Straw Hats.

One Piece is available from Viz Media and MANGA Plus.
