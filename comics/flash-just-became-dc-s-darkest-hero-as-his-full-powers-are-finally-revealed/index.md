## Literature Review

The darkest side of the Flashâ€™s powers comes to light when Wally West discovers that using the Speed Force is harming unseen layers of reality.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for The Flash #3!Unfortunately for the Flash, his powers are doing a lot more harm to the DC Universe than good. Ever since Wally West stumbled into a new way of looking at the world, he&#39;s seen things that defy comprehension. Now the Fastest Man Alive is finding out that his speed is seriously dangerous.




In The Flash #3 by Si Spurrier and Mike Deodato, Jr., Max Mercury arrives to help Flash with his new dimensional shift power. Max matches Wally&#39;s aura and the two explore a lower layer of reality. Flash panics as a powerful explosion ripples across the hidden dimension.

          

However, once Flash and Max return to their dimension, they discover Impulse has just arrived. While Wally correctly surmises that Bart was the cause of the explosion, Max reminds Flash that all Flash Family members draw from the same power source. In short, whenever a speedster uses their powers in one plane of existence, it causes unknown destruction on another layer.


 The Flash is Accidentally Hurting Other Dimensions Just By Running 
          




The Flash&#39;s world turned upside down ever since he ran straight into an atomic mirror wielded by Mirror Master. Since then, Wally has been experiencing glitches that show him hidden, often horrifying layers of reality. At the same time, the Speed Force began experiencing strange anomalies. Speedsters using their speed began experiencing physical pain and strange monsters like the Uncoiled have tried killing Wally. The fluctuations haven&#39;t been all bad, as West&#39;s glitching has helped him develop new powers. But other than that, the Flash has been absolutely stumped as to what&#39;s behind these odd changes to the Speed Force.

Flash has been afraid of what his new dimensional shift powers were doing to him. But as it turns out, Wally and every other speedster were the ones causing damage all this time. Though nothing seems wrong on the Flash&#39;s plane of existence whenever a speedster runs, it&#39;s actually causing massive damage to other layers of reality. Even more horrifying, those other planes of existence have sentient beings on them. So what may seem like an innocuous run in one dimension is actually quite destructive to another layer of reality. Now that Flash is aware of how destructive his speed is, he might have to seriously reconsider how he uses his powers.






 The Flash Can&#39;t Ethically Use His Powers 
          

The Flash uses his speed to help rid the world of bad guys and stop cataclysmic threats. While it&#39;s a noble mission, Wally&#39;s now aware that his speed is actually harmful to the world, or at least unseen parts of it. While those on the topmost layer of reality don&#39;t see or feel anything, the damage is most certainly felt on lower planes. Who knows how that kind of damage could affect the world? Wally might be a hero dedicated to justice, but until he can figure out what&#39;s going on, the Flash can&#39;t use his powers knowing he&#39;s actively harming the more vulnerable parts of the world.

The Flash #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
