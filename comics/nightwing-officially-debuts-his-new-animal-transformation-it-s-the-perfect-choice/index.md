## Literature Review

As heroes and villains across the DC Universe begin to transform into their animal counterparts, Nightwing joins the fray and sprouts some fur.




Contains spoilers for Titans #6!!




DC Universe has gone feral thanks to Beast Boy and the events of Beast World, and now Nightwing is joining the fray with his own animal form. During a confrontation with Tempest and Brother Eternity, one of the “Garro” organisms infecting the planet finds a new host in Dick Grayson. Its effects are nearly instant, and the Titan’s leader changes into an orange-furred fox, throwing his team into further disarray.

In Titans #6 – written by Tom Taylor, with art by Travis Moore, Tamra Bonvillain, and Wes Abbott – Nightwing, Batgirl, and the Titans try to hold off the flood of problems coming from every angle. Before Dick and Barbara have a chance to execute their plan to handle Tempest, he floods the headquarters and claims Nightwing as the next Beast World victim.

          




Unlike Batman, whose rage morphs him into a bloodthirsty werewolf, Dick is slated to take a more cunning form. Titan’s #6 only shows a glimpse of bright green eyes, an elongated foot, and orange fur, but that’s plenty to signify that Blüdhaven’s protector has left his humanity behind and leaned into his quick-witted, foxy nature. 


 Nightwing’s &#34;Beast World&#34; Transformation Highlights His Best Qualities 


          

Dick’s transformation, seen in full on the Titan&#39;s #6 Sweeny Boo variant cover, isn’t cause for celebration. It further complicates the mission to handle Brother Eternity, Garro, and the host of other problems building around the globe. However, Nightwing turning into a fox does offer some interesting insight into the character himself – especially when stacked against the other existing transformations. Batman is a fanged and clawed werewolf, with Red Hood becoming the same, and it’s hardly a mystery why the two of them would take that form. There is violence to both (though they handle it differently) and the Beast World events drag it to the surface. Fox Nightwing brings out something else entirely.




Although Nightwing can display a serious, even stern, tactical side when it comes to planning and leadership, he’s frequently able to use his flirtatious, likable nature to win over allies and build unexpected bridges. Changing into a fox seems to touch on the best parts of Dick Grayson&#39;s personality, including his incredible intelligence and clever thinking. He was the first Robin, after all, and he’s spent his life training to be cunning and quick – often thinking of solutions that his mentor and teammates don’t. While Batman and some of the others transform based on their darker instincts, Nightwing seems to be leaning toward the light.



 The Titans Need Their Leader If They&#39;re Going To Survive &#34;Beast World&#34; 
          

While Dick’s transformation is intriguing, and it offers some insight into the core of the character, it couldn&#39;t have come at a worse time. The Titans are already stretched thin and missing multiple members. Just before his transformation, Dick and Barbara devised a plan to deal with Tempest and seemed to have some partial idea for how to undo the bestial changes caused by the Garro organisms, and Dick suggests the answer is drawing them out of their hosts. None of their plans were put into motion before Nightwing sprouted fur, and the world needs him back to normal as he guides his team through the unfolding chaos.
