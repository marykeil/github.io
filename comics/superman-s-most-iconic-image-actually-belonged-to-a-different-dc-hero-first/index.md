## Literature Review

It turns out that Superman wasn&#39;t the first hero to act out his iconic pose from the Action Comics #1 cover: Green Lantern beat him to it.





Summary

  Green Lantern Alan Scott homages Superman&#39;s iconic Action Comics #1 pose.   Green Lantern&#39;s pose mirrors the classic cover of Action Comics, emphasizing his role as one of the first superheroes.   In the DC Universe, Green Lantern&#39;s debut sparked the heroic age, similar to Superman&#39;s impact on the superhero genre in 1938.  







Few things are more iconic in the comic-book world than Superman&#39;s classic pose from Action Comics #1. That&#39;s why it comes as a major surprise to discover that, for all the fame that scene has accrued, it&#39;s not actually Superman&#39;s pose; Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern, did it first in DC&#39;s official continuity.

Jeremy Adams and Diego Olortegui&#39;s Jay Garrick: The Flash #4 takes readers through the memories of Professor Hughes (who is actually the evil Doctor Elemental), flashing back to 1938. It is revealed that, on his way to celebrate his recently obtained tenure, Hughes saw an amazing feat that would send him spiraling into obsession and villainy: one of the first broadcasts of Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern, foiling a robbery.

          




Green Lantern&#39;s pose is instantly recognizable: positioned beneath a slanted car that has impacted a telephone pole while onlookers rush away in panic, it is practically a mirror of Action Comics #1&#39;s classic cover, down to the screaming figure in the bottom left corner.

                  ALAN SCOTT: THE GREEN LANTERN Reintroduces an Authentic Queer Hero (Review)   Alan Scott&#39;s return to a solo Green Lantern series captures the hero&#39;s compassion and heart, showing why he has become a role model for so many.   


 Green Lantern Takes Over Superman&#39;s Classic Pose 
Action Comics #1 (1938)


          

The homage is clearly deliberate. For those familiar with Superman&#39;s classic cover, it&#39;s not difficult to see that, while the circumstances are different, the composition of Green Lantern&#39;s broadcast clearly mirrors the iconic image, with a terrified bystander on the bottom left and the distinctive angle of the car. While there is no telephone pole in Superman&#39;s version, keen-eyed viewers will notice the crumpling of the front fender to be an almost perfect match.




This isn&#39;t the first time DC has reused this classic Action Comics Superman pose, especially given its historical importance as Superman&#39;s first appearance. It is an excellent visual mainstay and shorthand for conveying a character as being particularly heroic, marking new beginnings or a dramatic entrance. In Green Lantern&#39;s case, it emphasizes his place as one of the very first superheroes in DC&#39;s timeline, framing him as just as big a catalyst for the arrival of future heroes in the DC Universe as the first publication of Superman was for readers.

 Green Lantern Sparked DC&#39;s Heroic Age 
         




The broadcast of Alan Scott as Green Lantern is specifically noted to take place during 1938; this would put his debut in the DC Universe roughly on par with Superman&#39;s first appearance in Action Comics. This implies that, in the DC Universe, it was in fact Green Lantern who sparked the heroic age (although there is certainly room for him and Superman to operate concurrently). Either way, it&#39;s certainly interesting to see how, by using this iconic pose, Green Lantern has become the &#34;Superman&#34; catalyst of the DC Universe.
