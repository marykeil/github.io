# Moon Knight s Personas Officially Get New Codenames as Separate Heroes


## SUMMARY 



  Moon Knight&#39;s alternate personas get new codenames in the finale of his latest comic series, reflecting their unique characteristics.   The Traveler, The Embracer, and The Pathfinder are the new names, representing Jake&#39;s traveler status, Steven&#39;s analytical mind, and Khonshu&#39;s god-tier power.   While the physical manifestation of these personas is unlikely, the codenames add an interesting layer to Moon Knight&#39;s struggle with his dissociative identity disorder.

## Literature Review

Moon Knight&#39;s personality disorder has given him a few different personas over the years, with each one officially getting new superhero identities.




Spoilers for Moon Knight: City of the Dead #5!In Marvel Comics, Moon Knight’s dissociative identity disorder (DID) sees his body and mind taken over by more than a few alternate personas depending on the situation at hand, making him an unpredictable wild card of a hero who isn’t always reliable in a pinch. And now, in the finale to Moon Knight’s latest comic miniseries, Marc Spector’s four distinct identities get brand new codenames that fit each perfectly as separate superheroes.




Using a couple of other consistent personas aside from Marc Spector, an ex-mercenary and current defender of those who travel by night, Moon Knight can also call on the business smarts of the billionaire Steven Grant and the street-smarts of the rough-around-the-edges taxi driver Jake Lockley, when needed.

          

Also harboring the personality of the Moon God known as Khonshu, Moon Knight, during a trip to the underworld to save a young boy’s soul, finally unleashes all of these unique parts of himself in the flesh, birthing three separate heroes based on Moon Knight&#39;s personas: “The Traveler,” “The Embracer,” and “The Pathfinder.”

                  Long Live the Knight: Marvel Trailer Teases the New Moon Knight After Marc Spector&#39;s Death   Marvel has unveiled a new trailer for Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1, giving fans a tantalizing glimpse at the new Fist of Khonshu.    





 The Traveler, The Embracer, and The Pathfinder Make Their Marvel Comics Debut 
          

New codenames revealed while fighting the final battle against the Jackal Knight in Moon Knight: City of the Dead #5, by David Pepose and Marcelo Ferreira, this issue sees Moon Knight bring to life Steven Grant, Jack Lockley and even Khonshu himself, thanks to the underworld being a “psychoactive” realm “shaped by the contents of one’s heart.” Manifesting Jack Lockley’s fighting spirit as “The Traveler” (dressed in Mr. Knight garb), Steven Grant’s “refined” and “analytical” mind as “The Embracer” (in a unique white and gold costume), and the god-tier power of Khonshu as “The Pathfinder” (dressed as the skeletal bird-like figure he’s usually seen as), Marc Spector’s Moon Knight pulls off something previously thought impossible.




Called “The Traveler,” this name is spot-on for Jake, as not only is he a constant traveler due to his taxi driver pastime, but as seen here dressed in Mr. Knight’s costume, is someone who takes in and helps troubled travelers at Moon Knight’s Midnight Mission. Named &#34;The Embracer,&#34; this next title makes sense for Steven, considering he’s always the first persona to embrace the next new idea and face a tough situation with “a gambit or a witty remark.” Finally, there’s “The Pathfinder,” a pitch-perfect name for Marc’s Khonshu personality since it was this manipulative Moon God who quite literally put Marc on the path to becoming the vigilante he is today.



 Moon Knight&#39;s Multiple Personas Now Have Separate Superhero Codenames 
          

So while it’s doubtful that when Marc Spector is not traversing the depths of the underworld Steven Grant, Jack Lockley, or Khonshu will ever physically manifest themselves into separate tangible beings as seen in this issue, knowing that each has assigned themselves unique names that fall in line with what each persona stands for is an interesting piece of Moon Knight lore that further adds to Marc’s struggle and acceptance of his dissociative identity disorder. Moon Knight’s alternate personalities deserve some extra attention and respect in comics, and now, thanks to a set of codenames that could double as superhero monikers, they have both.






Moon Knight: City of the Dead #5 is now available from Marvel Comics.
