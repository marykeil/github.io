With the entire world in a panic due to the events of Beast World, a former love interest of Dick Grayson has returned to try and help him save the world.

As Garro&#39;s Beast Spores take over the world, people are transformed into beast forms and run rampant. Desperate for a cure, Nightwing turns to his old friend and lover Bridgette.



          

As a trained doctor and one of the few people not transformed into a beast right now, Bridgette begins searching for the cure to Garro&#39;s Beast Spores. The issue further revealed that she&#39;s always known Nightwing&#39;s secret identity since she used to be the landlord of his apartment.




                  Titans: Beast World #1 Proves 2023 Still Has Must-Read Stories Left to Tell (Review)   DC Comics’ last event for 2023 begins in earnest with Titans: Beast World #1, a nail-biting calamity with action and surprisingly touching moments.   


 A Former Love Interest Returns To Help Nightwing During The Events Of &#34;Beast Wars&#34; 


          



When Nightwing first moved to Bludhaven, he needed a place to stay and ended up staying in the apartment building owned by Bridgette Clancy. There was an immediate attraction between the two characters, and they tried to find the time for one another, but they&#39;d constantly get interrupted by events in their life. Eventually, they had to go their separate ways in life. Nightwing eventually went back to Batgirl and Bridgette moved on to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor. This choice also ended up saving her life, as it got her out of Bludhaven before the city ended up being destroyed by Chemo.




Bridgette and Nightwing&#39;s relationship never really got off the ground, as the pair were in two different places in life. Nightwing&#39;s romance with Barbara Gordon started up again, and Bridgette moved out of Bludhaven to pursue being a doctor. This divergence in paths might have just saved the world, as Bridgette has returned to Nightwing&#39;s life, now a full-fledged doctor, and is ready to help him as Beast World reaches its most dire moment. It has been shown that the Beast Spores can leave the human body without causing any long-lasting harm. The only problem is finding a way to induce the Beast Spore to leave the target involuntarily, which is what Bridgette is trying to figure out.

With the world overrun by beasts, it is going to take every single person who is still human in the DC Universe to save the world. Nightwing has been directing the Titans, and trying to keep the world from falling apart, as major hitters like Powergirl and Black Adam have transformed into monsters and run rampant. This has made finding a cure all the more important, as more and more powerful characters are transformed into monsters with each issue. With Dick Grayson also ending up transformed, it looks like it won&#39;t be Nightwing that can save the world, but one of his old and oft-forgotten love interests could prove critical in the event&#39;s endgame.
