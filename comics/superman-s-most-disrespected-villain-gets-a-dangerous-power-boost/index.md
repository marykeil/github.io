## Literature Review

Bizarro, Supermanâ€™s most perplexing foe, is back with enhanced strength powerful enough to send the Man of Steel flying all across the solar system.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1061!An infamous Superman villain has returned and he&#39;s come back with strength that is shocking to DC&#39;s most powerful hero. After some time away, the Man of Steel&#39;s backward nemesis Bizarro is back. But an upgrade and a mysterious plan could be turning Superman&#39;s opposite into Clark&#39;s greatest foe.




In a preview for Action Comics #1061 by Jason Aaron and John Timms, Superman discovers his opposite-themed foe Bizarro acting a bit unlike himself. Taking up Bizarro diction, Clark asks what&#39;s wrong only for Bizarro to insult the hero before hitting Superman and sending him flying millions of miles away from Earth.

         

Superman lands on Venus and is shocked that Bizarro is displaying strength that exceeds his old limits. Bizarro reveals he&#39;s much different than before and fights Superman all across the galaxy. After abandoning Superman on Pluto, Bizarro returns to Earth and begins a ritual with several relics in an attempt to find a way home.


 Superman Admits Bizarro is Stronger Than He&#39;s Ever Been 
          




Out of all the villains in Superman&#39;s rogues gallery, the strangest by far has to be Bizarro. Bizarro is an imperfect copy of Superman. Not only does he operate off a twisted, nearly backward form of logic, but Bizarro has almost the complete opposite of Clark&#39;s power set. Instead of heat vision, Bizarro has freeze vision. While Superman has freeze breath, Bizarro has flame breath. Over the years, Bizarro&#39;s motivations have fluctuated wildly. Sometimes he&#39;s a villain because Superman is a hero. Other times Bizarro wants to be good, but because of his backward Bizarro logic, he winds up doing more harm than good.

For most of his experiences with Bizarro, the villain has been more of a nuisance than a legitimate threat. But by Superman&#39;s admission, Bizarro is hitting harder than he ever has before, enough to knock Clark all the way to another planet. Bizarro also seems to be far more aggressive and determined than he&#39;s previously been, likely because he&#39;s trying to go home and has no way of getting back to the Bizarro World. Bizarro isn&#39;t one to tinker with arcane objects, but his desperation has driven him to try new methods, likely explaining his enhanced strength. But what other secrets could Bizarro be hiding in his backward mind?






 Bizarro&#39;s Mission is Making Him More Dangerous Than Ever 
          

Usually, Superman can handle his offbeat, less powerful doppelganger. But with enhanced strength, it&#39;s going to be more of a problem than usual. Especially if Bizarro is experimenting with next-level magic objects. Maybe he&#39;s just trying to magically divine a way home, but he could be consulting these powerful relics to make himself more powerful. He&#39;s already got Superman-level strength. What&#39;s Clark going to do if Bizarro can match or even outdo the hero&#39;s speed or durability? If Bizarro&#39;s found a way to augment his abilities, then Superman and the rest of the DC Universe could be in serious danger.

Action Comics #1061 is available from DC Comics on January 9th.
