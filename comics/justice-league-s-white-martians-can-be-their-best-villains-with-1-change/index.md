## Literature Review

DC&#39;s alternate-universe series Dark Knights of Steel alerted the Justice League of another world to how dangerous White Martians can really be.




White Martians may be the Justice League&#39;s most underestimated adversaries, but they could be even more dangerous with one tweak. 2023 turned into something of an unexpected resurgence for the White Martians, who in DC canon are one out of four races from the planet Mars. These violent shapeshifters showcased how dangerous they could really be against the Justice League in Dark Knights of Steel.




Created by Tom Taylor and Yasmine Putri, Dark Knights of Steel is a medieval reimagining of classic DC lore. Dark Knights of Steel #9 by Taylor, Putri, Arif Prianto, and Wes Abbott is the first to reveal that the invading White Martians had been the main antagonists pulling the strings behind the scenes, shifting the plot in motion the entire time.

          

However, even in their most impressive effort, there is one thing holding them back: their weakness to fire. As has been the case with just about every DC story showcasing the White Martians, even those within official continuity, fire proves to be the White Martians&#39; undoing by the end.

 Fire Is a White Martian&#39;s Undoing Every Time 
          

Dark Knights of Steel truly shows off how impressive the White Martians are as a Justice League enemy. Not only are they shown to be wildly powerful, but they are proven to be incredibly skilled at subterfuge. Meaning that by the time anyone becomes savvy about their plans, they&#39;re already too late, and those plans have already been put in motion. This is the case in Dark Knights of Steel, where it is well past the halfway point of the series before the universe&#39;s version of the Justice League learns that the White Martians were even on their planet — let alone what a White Martian is.

However, even in an alternate universe, fire proves to be the White Martians&#39; downfall. Their reveal in the ninth issue comes with the Green Arrow shooting a fiery arrow at someone who happens to be a White Martian, alerting the League to who and what they&#39;re dealing with. By the time the final issue rolls around, the Justice League knows they can beat their adversaries by allowing fire to rain down on them, and that aggressive tactic proves to be the heroes&#39; triumph. Similarly, in official DC continuity, Batman by himself is able to dispose of the White Martians with even greater ease by using fire.






 The Problem with Fire as a Weakness for White Martians 
          

Outside actual DC lore, fire as a weakness is a bit underwhelming. After all, fire is a weakness for most people in general — superhero, alien, and otherwise. The average human is not going to survive long if a fireball is hurled in their direction. In terms of actual DC lore, though, fire as a main weakness puts the White Martians at a disadvantage every time because it&#39;s so easy to exploit. Someone can convince an entire alien species to flee the planet just by rubbing two wooden sticks together. Superhero stories thrive on creativity, and finding new ways to beat the White Martians can only help elevate them into becoming a bigger — and more exciting — threat to the Justice League.



Dark Knights of Steel is available now, online and in collected editions, from DC Comics.
