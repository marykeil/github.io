# Captain America Hates One Major DC Team


## SUMMARY 



  DC Universe treats its heroes better than Marvel. Superman and Flash have their own museums and Batman has a burger franchise based on his adventures.   Marvel Universe has more hostility towards its heroes. Anti-mutant sentiment and events like Civil War create a more challenging environment for heroes.   Captain America sees the Justice League as tyrants who have conquered their world, based on the love that civilians have for them. However, DC citizens genuinely love the Justice League.

## Literature Review

The Justice League is one of the greatest superhero teams in comic books, but despite this, Captain America is certainly not a fan of them.




The Justice League and the Avengers may be the two greatest teams in comic books, but Captain America is not a fan of DC&#39;s squad of superheroes. The two teams have defended their respective universes for years against threats that would conquer or destroy everything. But despite their similarities, there&#39;s one major difference between the two teams that Cap cannot abide.




A contest between two cosmic forces leads to the Avengers and Justice League swapping universes in the 2003-2004 miniseries JLA/Avengers by Kurt Busiek, George Perez, Tom Smith, and Comicraft. When the Avengres land in the DC Universe, Captain America is less than impressed with how this universe treats its heroes compared to the Marvel Universe.



          



This leads Captain America to believe that the Justice League is made up of tyrants who have conquered the world. He bases this opinion on the world&#39;s absurd hero worship, such as literal fast food chains based on Batman or the Flash Museum. This is a stark difference from the Marvel Universe, where civilians often distrust their heroes and what they can do.

                  The Avengers Finally Gain One Cool Advantage Over DC&#39;s Justice League   The Avengers and Justice League are evenly matched on opposite sides of the multiverse, but the former may have just found a serious advantage.   





 The DC Universe Treats Its Heroes Much Better Than Marvel 


          



The DC Universe definitely treats its heroes differently from Marvel&#39;s. Despite DC having a reputation for being &#34;darker&#34; with characters like Batman, the civilians of the DC Universe tend to love their heroes. Superman is a beloved hero in Metropolis and Flash is so popular in Central City that he has his very own museum, something Quicksilver even remarks on. There is merchandise of characters like Superman, who gets to appear on the news; Wonder Woman is a literal ambassador for the government, and Batman has a burger franchise based off his adventures. All of these show that the Justice League is treated much differently from the Avengers.

The Marvel Universe doesn&#39;t treat its heroes nearly as well as DC does, and that&#39;s in part due to the sheer number of differences in their universe. The Avengers continue to allow Dr. Doom to rule over Latveria, with no real way to stop him. While DC has Black Adam, his citizens seem to legitimately care for him, and Black Adam doesn&#39;t try to conquer the world every chance he gets. The Marvel Universe also has its mutant problem, with a huge amount of hatred being directed towards the mutant population, something the Avengers haven&#39;t been able to solve. There was also the massive Civil War event that nearly destroyed the superhero community entirely, an event that DC doesn&#39;t have its own version of.






 Captain America Sees The Justice League As Tyrants 


          



While both teams are equally heroic, one obviously has a harder time than the other. For whatever reason, the Marvel Universe is a significantly more hostile place to its heroes, with anti-mutant sentiment running rampant and events like the Civil War arc that pit friend against friend. These major differences lead Captain America to believe that the Justice League simply must have conquered their world and enforced the love that civilians seem to have for them. Considering the world Captain America comes from and the events he&#39;s seen, it&#39;s not an unreasonable assumption. But despite how Captain America feels about the Justice League, the citizens of DC truly do love them.
