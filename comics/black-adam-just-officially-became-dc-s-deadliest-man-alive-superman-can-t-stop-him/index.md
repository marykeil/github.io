## Literature Review

Black Adam has gotten his most terrifying and destructive upgrade ever and unfortunately for the DC Universe, Superman is powerless to stop him.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #2!Even Superman can&#39;t stop Black Adam thanks to the antihero&#39;s latest upgrade. The Earth is being besieged by spores that are changing DC&#39;s heroes and villains into terrifying animal creatures. Sadly, the Man of Steel can&#39;t do anything to stop the fallen Champion of Shazam from destroying the world around him.




In Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, Beast Boy is unleashing spores across the globe that are turning everyone they come in contact with into animal hybrids. In Gotham, Nightwing tries to keep things under control, but he&#39;s helpless as a spore attacks Batman and transforms him into a wolf-like creature.



          

Nightwing realizes that the spores are attracted to power just as Oracle discovers Kahndaq is in flames after Black Adam has been transformed into a lion hybrid. Oracle dispatches Starfire and Donna Troy to rein the powerful magic-wielder in. However, the battle becomes incredibly harder for the Titans once they discover they&#39;re at risk of being infected by the spores.


 Black Adam is Out of Control and No One Can Stop Him 
          




All hell broke loose quickly when a devastating alien known as the Necrostar was released from captivity. After Starfire revealed that only Starro could defeat the Necrostar, Beast Boy rose to the occasion to stop it. He pushed his powers further than he ever had before to become a similar creature to Starro. It worked and he successfully repelled the invader. Unfortunately, Amanda Waller&#39;s new asset Doctor Hate mind-wiped Beast Boy, leaving him stuck as a rampaging monster. Worse, he began releasing spores that slowly started turning the people into animal hybrids.

Black Adam is one of the most powerful people in the DC Universe, so it&#39;s understandable that the spores would be attracted to him. Unfortunately, few people match him in power and could stand up to the monster he is now. Superman seems like a natural choice to deal with the infected Black Adam. Unfortunately, as seen in Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis #1, Clark is currently traveling across the globe to prevent the spores from infecting him and making a bad situation worse. While Superman is being responsible and keeping himself at a distance, the Titans have very few options for handling an unrestrained Black Adam.






 Who Will Stop Black Adam if Superman Can&#39;t? 
          

The nature of Beast Boy&#39;s spores is quickly making the Titans realize how much of an uphill battle they&#39;re facing. The spores are attracted to power, and turn mighty figures like Black Adam into unhinged threats. The only way of potentially defeating someone like him is with an equal amount of power, but that poses the risk of other heroes getting infected too. How exactly are the Titans supposed to defeat these animal hybrids if the DCU&#39;s strongest heroes are also the most vulnerable to infection? The team is going to have to figure out something because with Black Adam causing more damage by the second, they&#39;ll need a more creative solution than bringing in Superman.

Titans: Beast World #2 is on sale now.
