## Literature Review

Norman Osborn will don the iconic Green Goblin costume once again, putting an end to the Spider-Man villain&#39;s stint as Marvel&#39;s latest hero.




Norman Osborn is saying goodbye to his days as a hero and returning to his role as the infamous Green Goblin. In recent years, Norman Osborn has been going through a major redemption arc as he attempts to become the next big Marvel hero. Not only has he teamed up with Spider-Man countless times in the latest run of The Amazing Spider-Man, but he&#39;s also taken on the role of Marvel&#39;s latest crime fighter, the Gold Goblin. Now, it looks like Norman will be returning to his villainous roots in an upcoming storyline.




According to Marvel, the upcoming Free Comic Book Day title, Spider-Man/The Ultimate Universe #1, will give fans a glimpse into what lies ahead for the world of Spider-Man. This issue by Zeb Wells, Deniz Camp, Ryan Stegman and Juan Frigeri will &#34;set up the return of Norman Osborn as Green Goblin&#34; in a massive shake-up to The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s story.



          

Osborn&#39;s role as the Goblin has lived on in infamy for Spider-Man fans throughout the years, with his most notable evil deed being the death of Gwen Stacy. Now, with his return to the role guaranteed, it opens the doors to one of the darkest storylines yet, as Spider-Man must face his greatest nemesis once again.

                  Willem Dafoe&#39;s Green Goblin Gets the Epic Redesign He Deserves in Ultimate Spider-Man   The new Ultimate Green Goblin has been revealed, and his latest look has given Willem Dafoe&#39;s version the perfect redesign for a new era.   





 Osborn&#39;s Return as Green Goblin Will Likely Be a Slow Burn 
          

While fans will need to wait to see Osborn back in his purple and green outfit, this doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be clues sprinkled throughout future issues of The Amazing Spider-Man. In fact, fans will likely get to see hints towards his turn sooner than they think. Recently, Zeb Wells, Patrick Gleason and Marcio Menyz&#39;s The Amazing Spider-Man #35 actually set up what&#39;s to come. After Peter was infected with Norman&#39;s past sins and turned villain, Norman was able to free the Webhead. However, this came at a cost, as Norman&#39;s sins found their way back to Osborn. The issue ends with Norman letting out a Goblin-esque chuckle. The seeds have been planted, and there will be more hints to come before he finally lets loose as the Goblin once more.






 Norman&#39;s Turn Sets Up Major Character Potential for Spider-Man 
          

Looking on the opposite side of what this shift to villainy will entail, Peter Parker will likely be met with a feeling of guilt once he realizes that the &#34;new&#34; Norman is gone. The two have been working together for quite some time now, with a renewed friendship officially formed through their crime fighting. However, that&#39;s all going away now because Norman has been exposed to his past sins. It was a major sacrifice on Norman&#39;s part to save Peter, but that won&#39;t stop the latter from feeling guilty about what his shocking turn to villainly did to his friend. This opens up a lot of story potential as Spider-Man comes to learn that Norman made this choice to save Peter.

Fans will be able to get a glimpse at the return of the Goblin when Free Comic Book Day: Spider-Man/The Ultimate Universe arrives in comic stores on May 4. This issue will also contain a glimpse into what lies in store for the newly rebooted Ultimate Universe, as well as &#34;a special preview of Al Ewing&#39;s next mind-bending arc of Venom.&#34; However, it&#39;s clear that Norman Osborn will be the spotlight of this issue as his darker half, the Green Goblin, finally emerges and puts an end to his hero days once and for all.
