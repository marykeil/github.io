## Literature Review

Godzilla&#39;s strength has been well noted in the MonsterVerse, but his latest battle confirms he &amp; the other Titans are way stronger than fans thought. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #2 It’s no secret that Godzilla is strong on a near-incomprehensible scale, especially within the MonsterVerse continuity, but fans have only ever had the other Titans to compare him with. Obviously, no human can compete with Godzilla or any other Titan in the MonsterVerse, so they’re completely in a league of their own. At least, until now, as Godzilla’s strength (and, by extension, the strength of every Titan he’s ever fought) is truly put to the test in ways it never has before. And that test is Godzilla’s recent battle against Superman.




In every installment of the MonsterVerse - from Godzilla: King of the Monsters to Godzilla vs Kong - Godzilla has faced threats that only he can handle (with some assistance from Kong on one occasion). Not only did Godzilla prove himself to be the King of the Monsters with every victory he gained through his superior strength, but he also made every other Titan look pathetic by comparison.

          

These other Titans were literally kneeling before Godzilla after he killed King Ghidorah, and Godzilla maintained that dominance through Godzilla vs Kong, and will likely continue to do so as the MonsterVerse continues. This makes the other Titans seem weak, though nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, every Titan who’s ever even gone toe-to-toe with Godzilla has Kryptonian-level strength, and the latest issue of Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong proves it.





 Godzilla Is As Strong As Superman, &amp; So Are The MonsterVerse’s Other Titans 
         

In Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #2 by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, Superman and Godzilla engage in combat, as teased at the end of the previous issue. Godzilla and a number of other Titans were transported to the DC Universe after a wish was made upon the Dreamstone to make it so. Now, Godzilla is stomping through Metropolis, and Superman is right there to stop him. At least, he’s trying to stop him.

Every attempt at taking Godzilla down - or even simply getting him to change direction - has failed. Godzilla swats Superman like a bug, matches his heat vision with his own atomic breath, and takes zero damage with every hit Superman does manage to land. Meanwhile, every hit Godzilla lands is detrimental to Superman, as Godzilla sends him flying through a building with a single swat of his tail, and nearly kills the Man of Steel with a blast of his atomic breath.






 Godzilla’s Victory Over Superman Elevates The Status Of Every Titan He’s Ever Fought 
          

While Godzilla has beaten every Titan he’s ever fought, there’s always a bit of back and forth between them before Godzilla takes the win. Godzilla has even gotten close to death after battling some of his tougher foes, like King Ghidorah and Mechagodzilla, before pulling out a victory in the end. But, in his fight with Superman, his victory was sound, with little to no danger of losing his life while fighting the Kryptonian. This means that not only does Godzilla have Superman-level strength, but so, too, does every other monster who’s ever given him trouble in the MonsterVerse, as each of them gave Godzilla a better fight than Superman did.

This new power scale is absolutely terrifying, especially when considering the regular humans who live among the Titans in the MonsterVerse, as each kaiju is roughly as strong as Superman, who’s own strength is astronomical (indeed, Superman can push the moon out of orbit on an average day). With this new information gathered from Godzilla’s battle against Superman, it’s fair to say that the Titans of the MonsterVerse are all way stronger than fans ever imagined.




Justice League vs Godzilla vs Kong #2 by DC Comics is available now.
