  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Deadpool&rsquo;s love life is complicated, but his relationship with Black Widow was short-lived due to her not wanting to get closer.
Shiklah and Deadpool&rsquo;s marriage quickly fell apart as she cheated on him and left him for her original fiancé, Dracula.
Copycat, also known as Vanessa, had a tumultuous relationship with Deadpool, including her death at the hands of the Weapon X project.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From flings with members of the Avengers to a long-lasting marriage that ended in tragedy, Deadpool has had many interesting love interests.</p>
<p>Deadpool has lived a very full life, with enough love interests to have their own comic series. From civilians who fell for the Merc with a Mouth to superheroes that one would never expect to see him partnered with, Deadpool has had his ups and downs in the relationship department.
While Wade Wilson may have a personality that can be irksome, even flat out annoying to some, he has managed to charm his way into the hearts of many. Given how complicated Deadpool is as a character, it should come as no surprise that his love interests have their own hangups. One love of his was even an incarnation of Death. Talk about baggage. Here are the best love interests in Deadpool&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>10  Carol Danvers
Debuted in 1967</p>
<p>When she was Ms. Marvel, before adopting the &ldquo;Captain Marvel&rdquo; mantle, Carol Danvers met Deadpool when they banded together to defeat a mass of aliens that were able to control the minds of humans. The experience was not only successful in destroying the troublesome aliens, but it also established a relationship between the supers. The pair got so close that they were nearly married. Had it not been for Captain American interrupting their Vegas wedding to reveal that Carol had been controlled by one of the aliens the whole time, they would have married. However, knowing Deadpool, it would have ended in annulment soon enough regardless.</p>
<p>9  Black Widow
Debuted in 1964</p>
<p>A surprising and seemingly mismatched pairing, Deadpool and Black Widow dated, albeit for a short period. They met while facing the Thunderbolts, yet it was not love at first sight for Black Widow. Instead, Wade eventually found a way to get under her tough exterior and find a way to her heart. However, he didn&rsquo;t pierce her tough armor enough; she ended the relationship not long after they got together because she didn&rsquo;t want them to get any closer.</p>
<p>8  Shiklah
Debuted in 2014</p>
<p>One of the weirdest romances of Marvel, Shiklah and Deadpool seemed doomed from the beginning. Meeting when Deadpool was tasked with bringing the betrothed Shiklah to her fiance, Dracula, Deadpool instead romanced her himself. They married in a ceremony that was even officiated by Nightcrawler. However, a happy ending was not in the cards for them as she started to resent Wade for neglecting her. She started to cheat on him, with one notable affair partner being Werewolf by Night (which seems like an apt pairing for the Queen of the Undead/Succubus). Before long, she left Deadpool for Dracula, the person she was originally engaged to in the first place.</p>
<p>7  Copycat
Debuted in 1990</p>
<p>While perhaps more well known as simply Vanessa by fans of the 2016 and 2019 Deadpool films, Copycat is a mutant shapeshifter. Vanessa met Wade before he was Deadpool and they fell in love quickly. However, when Wade was diagnosed with cancer he broke up with her. They would then go on to have a complicated history with Copycat trying to recruit Wade into the Weapon X project. However, after her memory went haywire, she tried to seduce him instead. After they broke up due to his love for Siryn, Copycat would use her shapeshifitng powers to turn into the women he loved in order to mess with him. Deadpool later was tasked with killing her by the Weapon X project, but he refused and tried to protect her. Unfortunately, his efforts were unsuccessful and she died in his arms.</p>
<p>6  Death
Debuted in 1940</p>
<p>Deadpool likes to live dangerously, including in his love life. As a result, is it really all that surprising that Deadpool would get into a relationship with Death (and not figuratively)? Lady Death and Wade met after his multiple near-death experiences, and the two of them soon fell in love. They loved each other so much that Deadpool tried to die in order to be close to her. However, Thanos, who&rsquo;s also had feelings for Death, did not take kindly to competition for his love interest. He cursed Deadpool with immortality, consequently destroying any chances of Death and Deadpool being together for keeps.</p>
<p>5  Siryn
Debuted in 1980</p>
<p>The mutant daughter of Banshee, Siryn is gifted with sonic powers, which made her a valued member of the X-Force. It was on the X-Force team where she met the wisecracking but (occasionally) charming Deadpool. He was infatuated with Siryn to the point of obsession. Rather than be scared off by this, Siryn found it endearing. Although Siryn has a soft spot for Deadpool, she never wanted a full-fledged relationship with him. The interest in one another, though, had the important effect of setting Deadpool down a path that showed him he was capable of heroics, even if it did start out as just a way to attract Siryn.</p>
<p>4  Rogue
Debuted in 1980</p>
<p>A very short-lived romance, Rogue and Deadpool shared a warm and accepting relationship nevertheless. Meeting when they fought Red Skull as part of Captain America&rsquo;s Avengers Unity Squad, the pair celebrated their victory with a kiss. Given Rogue&rsquo;s powers, when she kissed him, she inadvertently took on Wade&rsquo;s scarred appearance. Instead of recoiling at her new visage, she embraced it, communicating to Deadpool that she was not going to judge him or hold his looks against him. That was about as far as their romance went, but it was meaningful to Wade, which is not usually an easy thing to accomplish.</p>
<p>3  Valentine Vuong
Debuted in 2022</p>
<p>A recent addition to Deadpool&rsquo;s long list of love interests, Valentine Vuong first appeared in 2022&rsquo;s Deadpool (Vol. 9) #1. This non-binary assassin was originally tasked with a not so romantic task: to recruit Deadpool to be the leader of the Atelier Assassins Guild, of which they are a member. While Valentine was not successful in making Deadpool the Atelier leader, they fell for him instead. They have actually saved his life multiple times, including saving him from a symbiote.</p>
<p>2  Mercedes Wilson
Debuted in 1999</p>
<p>The wife of Deadpool for a time, Mercedes has quite the complicated story. She and Wade had an idyllic relationship and marriage (a rare occurrence for Deadpool&rsquo;s love life) until they rescued a man named T-Ray who claimed to be Wade Wilson. T-Ray killed Mercedes, leaving the real (or maybe not real) Deadpool heartbroken. To really send his cruelty home, T-Ray brought Mercedes back to life to mess with Wade&rsquo;s head. When Deadpool ran into Mercedes again after Bullseye puts a hit out on her, she ended up leaving with T-Ray. To make things just a bit more confusing, the appearance of Mercedes has changed drastically since her debut; she started out as a raven-haired beauty who seemed like a regular non-super, but later transformed into a redhead with mystical powers and a look to go with it.</p>
<p>1  Carmelita
Debuted in 2013</p>
<p>Carmelita Camacho had a brief relationship with Wade that produced their daughter, Eleanor. It wasn&rsquo;t until later, however, that Wade learned of his progeny. While Eleanor would eventually become a big part of Wade&rsquo;s story, he actually turned away from his former flame and his child when Carmelita first told him of his daughter&rsquo;s existence, as he thought they would be better off without him. However, things would all change when a Weapon X scientist kidnapped Carmelita in hopes of blackmailing Deadpool. Wade tried to rescue her, but he was too late and, as a result, was left as the guardian of Eleanor. He would later go on to have a close relationship with his daughter, and the fact that she brought Eleanor into his life makes Carmelita perhaps the most significant of all of Deadpool&rsquo;s romantic interests.
Deadpool   Summary:   The Merc with the Mouth first appeared in an issue of New Mutants in 1990, and since then has gone on to get his own series and a massive cult following. With his incredible powers of healing and regeneration, Deadpool was initially depicted as an X-Men villain, but went on to become an anti-hero. After getting his own movie series starting in 2016, the third Deadpool movie finally brings the wisecracking, fourth-wall-breaking character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe.    Franchise:   Marvel    Birthday:   November 22    Race:   Mutant    Alias:   Wade Wilson    Created By:   Fabian Nicieza, Rob Liefeld    Video Games:   Deadpool    Movies:   Deadpool, Deadpool 2, Deadpool 3    Comic Books:   Deadpool #1    Cast:   Ryan Reynolds</p>
