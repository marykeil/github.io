## Literature Review

For years, fans have debated the extent of Mystique&#39;s powers, and now a disgusting theory about her has been confirmed. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Uncanny Spider-Man #4!




The X-Men just confirmed a disgusting fan theory about Mystique’s shape-shifting powers. For over 40 years, Mystique has been one of Marvel’s most intriguing mutants, a shape-shifting assassin loyal to no one but her lover Destiny. Mystique’s powers allow her to assume any form she wishes, but has also led to speculation on other aspects of her abilities, and in Uncanny Spider-Man #4, one theory is seemingly confirmed.

In Uncanny Spider-Man #4, written by Si Spurrier and drawn by Lee Garbett, Nightcrawler (the Uncanny Spider-Man) teams up with the real Spider-Man after Mystique launches an attack on Orchis, demanding the organization return her child to her.



          



Spider-Man asks Nightcrawler about the weapon Mystique used to shoot the anti-mutant contingent, and he confirms it was indeed a bazooka, going on to reveal that she can create cavities in her body to store weapons.

 Mystique is Marvel&#39;s Mutant Assassin 
          

The fearsome Mystique has been at times an ally of the X-Men, but opposed them on many others. First appearing in 1978’s Ms. Marvel #18 and created by the legendary team of Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, Mystique has been one of Marvel’s most popular mutants, having appeared in numerous comics as well as being an integral part of Fox’s series of X-Men movies. Mystique is an assassin, and her shape-shifting abilities give her an edge in this field, and in the past she has served as a spy as well. As Mystique has developed, it has also been revealed her powers grant her a long life, as her cells continually regenerate.

Yet questions about Mystique’s powers have raged since her first appearance. As a shape-shifter, Mystique can alter her body mass. Originally, Mystique’s powers in this area were limited, but over time her powers have grown, leading fans to wonder if she could somehow create “pockets” in her body where weapons could be stored. If this was true, then it would give Mystique another advantage as an assassin: not only could she assume any form needed to get to her quarry, but she could even stash a weapon in her to use. Fans have speculated about this for years, and now Mystique’s son, Nightcrawler, has confirmed it.






 Mystique Leaves Unanswered Questions About This Ability 
          

Despite settling the matter, Uncanny Spider-Man #4 still leaves the details up to the imagination. For instance, it does not specify if the weapons Mystique stashes in her body would register with conventional detection methods. If this is not the case, and her weapons do show up on metal detectors, then some of the advantage she gained would be lost. However, Mystique is savvy enough to have somehow accounted for this, as she was able to slip her bazooka in this issue past the Sentinels. Mystique is one of the most lethal X-Men, and a long-standing fan theory about her has been confirmed, giving her another serious (but disgusting) edge.
