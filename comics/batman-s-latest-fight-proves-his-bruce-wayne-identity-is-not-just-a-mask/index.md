Summary

  Batman battles Zur-En-Arrh, a pure mechanical version of Batman without Bruce Wayne&#39;s humanity.   The fight between Batman and Zur-En-Arrh will settle the debate of whether Bruce Wayne or Batman is the true mask.   Bruce Wayne&#39;s true self, a traumatized child who wants to protect others, must overcome the pure version of Batman to prove his identity.  







Fans have debated for a long time over whether Bruce Wayne or Batman is the true mask, but Batman&#39;s newest villain promises to settle this debate for good. Bruce himself has given conflicting statements at times; some interpretations lean into the idea that Batman is his true self, and other interpretations have explored the idea of Bruce Wayne truly being the man underneath the cowl.

The upcoming battle between Batman and Bruce Wayne is teased in Batman #140 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jiménez. In this issue, Batman battles Zur-En-Arrh for control of his mind, and when Batman finally succeeds in regaining control over his body, he discovers that Zur has simply found a new one.



          

Using the Failsafe android, Zur-En-Arrh has given himself a new and unstoppable body, becoming a pure mechanical Batman without any of Bruce Wayne&#39;s humanity. What will follow is a fight that will settle this fan debate once and for all. DC has promised a literal Bruce Wayne vs. Batman fight, and it is going to be absolutely unforgettable.




                  &#34;An Army of Batmen&#34;: Bruce Wayne&#39;s Deadliest Contingency is Officially A Multiversal Threat   The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh is a bigger threat than Bruce Wayne thought, as he discovers his backup persona has huge plans for the DC Universe.   


 Bruce Wayne Finally Admits that He Is More Than Batman 
          

Bruce Wayne is a complicated character to pin down. After the death of his parents, he swore revenge on criminals, and since then he&#39;s used both the personas of Bruce Wayne and Batman to fight crime in different ways. As Bruce Wayne, he plays the bumbling billionaire while he tries to fund Gotham City, making it a better place. As Batman, he tries to eradicate crime through force and protect the innocent so no one suffers like he did. The personality Bruce puts on when he acts as his billionaire playboy self is a false one, which often leads some fans to believe that the entire Bruce persona is fake and Batman is the true one — but this isn&#39;t the case.




Bruce has a third personality: his true self, who is neither the cold vigilante Batman nor the playboy Bruce Wayne, but the real Bruce Wayne. He is a traumatized child who doesn&#39;t want anyone to ever suffer the pain he went through, and he is a father figure to many other traumatized children. This true Bruce Wayne now has to face a &#34;pure&#34; version of Batman in order to settle once and for all which version of him has the most power. Zur-En-Arrh is Batman&#39;s identity taken to the absurd, a version of Batman that only cares about fighting criminals and nothing else. Bruce is now going to have to demontrate that he&#39;s capable of overcoming a pure version of Batman, proving that he truly is Bruce Wayne above anything else.



 Zur-En-Arrh Is Batman without Bruce Wayne&#39;s Humanity 
          

Bruce Wayne is a complicated character; because of this, a lot of fans aren&#39;t exactly sure if he&#39;s truly the billionaire playboy or the Dark Knight who cares nothing for high society. Zur-En-Arrh is finally going to force Bruce to answer this question by pitting him against a pure version of Batman, not an evil twisted Batman. Zur is Batman without Bruce Wayne, and now Bruce is going to have to try and overcome that to prove once and for all that Batman can not exist without a Bruce Wayne — that beneath the cowl there has always been that scared boy who lost his parents and wants to prevent anyone else from going through the same pain.
