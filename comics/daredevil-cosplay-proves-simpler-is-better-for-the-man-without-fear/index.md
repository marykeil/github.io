## Literature Review

A new cosplay brings Daredevil&#39;s all-red costume from the comics to life brilliantly, beating out all previous live-action adaptations.




There’s no question that Daredevil has one of the greatest superhero costumes of all time. Yet every time he’s been adapted into live-action, the simple and sleek all-red design of the comics has been routinely ignored. New cosplay from Zack Attack Cosplay shows that, when it comes to the Man Without Fear, simpler is better.




Shared by photographer Ryan Sims via Instagram, the cosplay by zack_attack_cosplay looks like it stepped directly from the comic-book page. Striking a classic Daredevil pose with billy clubs drawn and at the ready, this cosplay is truly excellent work, showcased expertly by the photographer.


 

Zack’s cosplay shows that the classic Daredevil costume could be translated successfully into live-action without having to add anything “extra” to the design. All that’s required is the sleek look from the comics, the all-red bodysuit with the horned mask and the double-D logo on the chest.

                  Daredevil&#39;s Extreme 90s Armor Has a Secret Power That Protects His Identity   Daredevil&#39;s classic 90s black armor is back, and has just been revealed to have a secret power that any superhero would kill to possess.   





 Daredevil Has One of the Best Superhero Costumes 
          

Of course, Daredevil didn’t start in the all-red get-up, but rather had a yellow and red costume when the character made his debut in 1964. It wasn’t until Daredevil #7 by Stan Lee, Wally Wood, Artie Simek that Wood revised the character&#39;s original Bill Everett design and thus created one of the most iconic superhero costumes of all time. What’s most impressive about Zack Attack’s cosplay and Sims’ photography is that they even go so far as to capture the distinctive shading that Wood gave to the costume, with the darker red of the suit being rim-lit by lighter highlights. That’s truly what makes Daredevil’s costume what it is, and the cosplay captures that to perfection.

Notably, Daredevil’s red outfit is so iconic that the costume hasn’t been changed much since its original debut. There was the black-and-red armored costume Daredevil briefly adopted in the 1990’s, and Murdock has taken to adding black to his ensemble from time to time in the years since. But the character always goes back to the classic red, which is why his live action adaptations thus far can’t help but feel a bit disappointing. As cool and as well-designed as many of them are, they can’t match the beautiful simplicity of the red costume from the comics.






 Daredevil’s Costumes Throughout the Years 
         

Daredevil is set to make his return to the small screen soon, so the filmmakers will hopefully (and finally) give fans a classic suit more directly inspired by the comics. Those filmmakers would also do well to take a page from Zack Attack&#39;s cosplay and bring the classic red Daredevil to life on-screen.
