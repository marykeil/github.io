Summary

  Firestorm&#39;s control over molecules allows him to create Kryptonite gas, making him capable of taking down Superman.   Firestorm&#39;s fusion with the Firestorm Matrix grants him control over energy and matter, giving him an absurd level of power.

When it comes to members of the Justice League, Superman is without a doubt one of the most powerful. With flight, super speed, nigh-invulnerability, super strength, and a host of defensive and offensive powers, it&#39;s difficult to imagine anyone beating Superman without similar strength. But Firestorm proved that he has the exact skill set needed to bring down the Man of Steel.

Firestorm takes down Superman in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 by Mark Waid and Dan Mora. When Batman and Superman fight the entire Justice League in the Kingdom Come universe, some surprising characters get to show off just how effective they are against the iconic duo.

          

While Superman can hold his own against characters like Shazam and Wonder Woman, it&#39;s Firestorm who ends up being the key to taking Superman down. With his control over molecules, Firestorm can essentially re-arrange and create anything he wants, which he does when he creates Kryptonite gas to bring Superman down.




                  &#34;All-Out War&#34;: Darkseid&#39;s God-Like New Foe Leads the Justice League in a Massive DCU Battle   Darkseid is one of the most dangerous characters in the DC Universe, and now a new villain, Gog, is leading the Justice League against him.   


 Firestorm Can Easily Take Down Superman with His Powers 
          

Superman is an absurdly powerful character and the idea of taking him on in a fight is hopeless for the majority of DC&#39;s characters. Usually, taking him on requires someone to have the same level of strength as him or higher. And while Kryptonite is a way to bring Superman down to someone else&#39;s level, getting ahold of it is absurdly difficult. The Justice League has done their best to round up every bit of Kryptonite they can so that Superman&#39;s life isn&#39;t in danger, but one hero has shown the ability to create Kryptonite on command. With his control over molecules, bringing down the Man of Steel isn&#39;t any problem for Firestorm.




Firestorm has an absurd level of power despite his frequent absences from the DCU in recent years. Due to his fusion with the Firestorm Matrix, Firestorm has control over essentially all forms of energy and matter. He can re-arrange the molecular structure of things to instantly transform them into other things. This grants him the ability to make Kryptonite gas out of oxygen, which is a massive problem for Superman. While Firestorm has never really had any reason to fight Superman, this fight scene shows just how effective he would be against the Man of Steel. With his ability to literally create Green Kryptonite gas out of thin air, there&#39;s no reason Firestorm couldn&#39;t go a step further and create Gold Kryptonite — and other variations — as well.



 Firestorm Should be a Justice League Leader 


          




One of the best things about the DC Universe is the sheer size and scope of it. While Superman is undeniably powerful, there are plenty of characters who are capable of bringing him down. Almost any magic user has a decent shot of doing real damage to Superman, and other characters, like Blue Beetle and Firestorm, have demonstrated the ability to take the Man of Steel down if they really have to. As powerful as Superman is, there will always be Justice League characters, like Firestorm, who can give him a surprisingly tough fight when they have to.
