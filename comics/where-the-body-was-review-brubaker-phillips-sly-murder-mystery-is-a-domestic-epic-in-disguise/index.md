## Literature Review

Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips tackle the well-worn whodunit genre, but flip it on its ear in their approach to sex, lies and attempted murder...




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Where The Body Was




If noir has a name in comics, it would have to be Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips. The pair have consistently put out the finest crime/noir tales in comics over the years at Image Comics, establishing themselves as one of the most celebrated writer/artist duos in the whole of the comics industry. Now, they return with their latest work, Where The Body Was, an epic hardcover graphic novel that sees the pair tackling a murder mystery, with a twist.

First teaming up in 2001 for the DC Elseworlds book Batman: Gotham Noir, Brubaker and Phillips later collaborated on works such as Sleeper, Criminal, and Incognito. The publication of Fatale in 2012 saw the duo make their debut at Image Comics, where they’ve proceeded to produce a number of acclaimed titles like The Fade Out and Kill or be Killed. With the release of their 2020 title Pulp, Brubaker and Phillips moved away from monthly comics and instead chose to focus on long-form graphic novels like the Reckless series and last summer’s Night Fever.






          

Where The Body Was continues Brubaker and Phillips’ journey into long-form graphic novels, and is easily their most ambitious work yet.

Where The Body Was opens with a double-page spread of a map of the neighborhood where the bulk of the action takes place, along with a page detailing the cast of characters appearing therein. It sets the stage nicely for the story that unfolds over the 134 pages that follow, a crime fable peeling back the layers of an average American suburb to find the rot seeping in at the cracks. “Epic” is a term that is thrown about rather loosely these days, but Brubaker and Phillips truly earn that label with this latest project, a story that is wide-ranging in both scope and story content.

Set in the summer of 1984, Where The Body Was takes place primarily in the suburb of Pelican Road, whose inhabitants find themselves twisting through each other’s lives in a swirl of sex, lies and attempted murder. The cast of characters is expansive, with Brubaker and Phillips using this tried-and-true plot of a murder mystery to uncover the secret lives of very distinct characters living in the same suburb. From the young junkies in love to the cheating wife to the war vet living in the tent on the outskirts to the young girl tasking herself with dressing up like a superhero and protecting the neighborhood, Brubaker and Phillips use the “murder mystery” plot as an excuse to examine the lives of these characters in a very specific moment in time.

What is most immediately apparent about Where The Body Was is the willingness of the creators to take classic genre tropes and turn them on their ear at every turn. When the reader first meets the characters in the story, they may think they know what role they will play out in this grand “murder mystery” tableau, but each of them carries a secret and none are as simple on the surface as they may appear. This approach even extends to the titular “body” of the title, the mystery of which is not revealed until the very last scene of the book, as Brubaker and Phillips subvert expectations at every turn. There is a murder attempt and there is a dead body found, but the victim isn’t who you think and nothing plays out how you think it will.

What Brubaker and Phillips are really doing here is examining society in microcosm. The “body” of the title isn’t just referring to the dead body found on the Pelican Road sidewalk on that quiet summer afternoon in 1984, but also the various bodies making up the larger body of society. The creators take an interesting approach to the story by having many of the characters in the present day narrate the events of the past, making the book feel like a documentary or true crime podcast. By taking this approach, Brubaker and Phillips highlight the interconnectivity of characters as they weave in and out of each other&#39;s lives, the repercussions of their actions motivated by the characters’ loneliness, alienation and heartbreak.

Like a good novel, Where The Body Was closely examines each character chapter by chapter, as the story slowly comes together when their lives begin to intersect in interesting and surprising ways. Most surprising of all is how Brubaker and Phillips bring the characters to the climactic confrontation that winds up uniting them all, a moment of violence that is quickly wrapped up so that the story can take a more melancholic tone as the story draws to its denouement. The final moments of Where The Body Was are some of the most emotional pages Brubaker and Phillips have delivered thus far, as readers discover what happens to each character in the decades since that fateful summer.

If there’s anything to criticize in Where The Body Was, it’s that the story is perhaps too short. Each character is fascinating in their own way, but there are some who get more focus than others. Upon reaching the end of the story, one can’t help but feel certain characters could have used more page time, like the homeless Vietnam veteran Ranko, who plays an integral role in the story, yet somehow feels rushed and short-changed in his characterization. Ditto for neighborhood snoop Mrs. Wilson, who comments upon the action like a Greek Chorus throughout the story, but more often than not feels more like a convenient vehicle for exposition rather than a flesh-and-blood character.

Still, if the only real criticism one can find with any given work is that they are left wanting more upon reaching the conclusion, that only speaks to the overall excellent quality of the work in question. There is no doubt that Where The Body Was is the work of masters operating at the height of their craft, delivering an original graphic novel that is unpredictable, emotional and thoroughly gripping throughout. From the opening map setting the stage for the story to come to the final reveal of what happened to the “body” in the title, the creators have taken the murder mystery format and delivered a sly and unique take on a well-worn genre. Where The Body Was from Image Comics continues the impressive winning streak of creators Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips, and solidifies the pair’s legacy as the finest names out there in crime/noir comics.
