# Batman s Best Contingency Gadget Can Beat 2 Completely Different Justice League Heroes


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s contingency plans for the Justice League can be repurposed and used against other members of the Crime Syndicate.   Lex Luthor proves to be more imaginative than Batman by repurposing a lightning rod to potentially take down an evil version of Shazam.   While Batman&#39;s plan doesn&#39;t work on Alexander Luthor, it could work on Shazam, showing that sometimes a plan designed for one person will be effective against another.

## Literature Review

Batman has a contingency plan for every hero and villain he might come up against, but sometimes one contingency plan can work for two heroes.




Batman always has a plan to take down his opponent, but, because he has so many different weapons and artifacts at his disposal, sometimes he finds himself with a contingency plan that works on a Justice League hero it was never designed for. This was the case when Lex Luthor discovered a plan to take down the Flash and could very easily take down Shazam as well.




When the Crime Syndicate takes over the planet and banishes the Justice League in the lead up to Forever Evil #4 by Geoff Johns, David Finch, Richard Friend, Sonia Oback, and Rob Leigh, it is up to Batman and Lex Luthor&#39;s Injustice League to take them down. Since the Crime Syndicate is made up of evil versions of the Justice League, Batman feels that the contingency plans he has for the Justice League should work against the Crime Syndicate — and Lex Luthor proves even more imaginative than that.

          

Working on this theory, Batman retrieves a lightning rod from the future that he believes will be able to sap speed from the evil speedster Johnny Quick. Lex Luthor then repurposes this anti-speedster rod to try and damage an evil version of Shazam, bringing lightning down on him for a major hit.




                  DC&#39;s Crime Syndicate: The Evil Justice League Gets a New Origin   The Crime Syndicate may have a lot to handle in its new six-issue miniseries, which promises to tell the group&#39;s origin story.   


 Batman&#39;s Contingency Plan for the Flash Also Works for Shazam 
          

Batman has tailored plans to defeat each Justice League member should they ever go out of control. These plans include specific details, like making Aquaman hydrophobic, which naturally seems like a plan that would only work on Aquaman. But there are a few plans that Batman has had that could be repurposed for other League members. For example, one of Batman&#39;s big plans to take down Wonder Woman is to trap her in an illusion. But there&#39;s no reason this plan couldn&#39;t also work on Superman, especially considering Superman&#39;s vulnerability to magic.




While Batman intends to use the lightning rod in this issue against the Crime Syndicate version of the Flash, Lex Luthor realizes that it could work just as well against Alexander Luthor. A crazed version of Lex Luthor, Alexander steals the powers of anyone he kills. This makes him extremely dangerous, especially as his greatest power is stolen from Shazam, making him practically invulnerable. In a bid to deal any damage to Alexander, Lex has Black Adam shove the lightning rod into their enemy and then call down the magic lightning, hoping it might deal real damage to Alexander.



 Lex Luthor Makes Better Use of Batman&#39;s Contingency Plans 
          

While this doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s not because it&#39;s a bad plan. Alexander had absorbed far more powers than Shazam&#39;s baseline. While this plan doesn&#39;t work on Alexander, there&#39;s no reason to think it wouldn&#39;t work on Shazam. Ultimately, Batman tries to tailor his plans for the villains or heroes they&#39;re meant for. But with so many heroes with so many different powers — both in the Justice League and otherwise — it&#39;s no surprise that sometimes a plan designed for one person will end up being effective against another. While Batman had every intention of using this lightning rod against Johnny Quick, Lex Luthor realizes it&#39;s just as effective as an anti-Shazam contingency plan.
