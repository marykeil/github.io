## Literature Review

On a trip to America, Attack on Titan mangaka Hajime Isayama decided to let his fans know how he feels about their reaction to his conclusion. 




Warning: contains spoilers for the end of Attack on TitanAttack on Titan&#39;s ending was so controversial that series creator Hajime Isayama had to release a statement about it a few days before a scheduled appearance at an American convention. With the recent release of the Attack on Titan anime&#39;s final episode, the debate over the finale and Eren Yaeger&#39;s justification for his actions have been reignited. Despite fan division though, Isayama&#39;s statement suggests that some fans might take their passion a little too far.




By the time Attack on Titan released its final chapter in April 2021, the conclusion arc had already become a subject of sharp contention for, among other reasons, its multiple revelations about Eren and why he chose to become an enemy of humanity. Though it could be argued that Eren&#39;s turn to villainy had been foreshadowed since the series&#39; earliest chapters, fans criticized Isayama for seemingly abandoning any hope of a truly heroic interpretation of Attack on Titan&#39;s characters, leaving them with a supposedly empty feeling for the story overall.

          

In anticipation of his appearance at the Anime NYC convention back in November, Isayama broke his silence through his longtime publisher Kodansha, releasing a message for fans that reads:


To the fans of the Attack on Titan manga &amp; anime, Attack on Titan was heavily influenced by Hollywood movies, TV shows, and American culture, so I am excited to meet fans from the place where I’ve always dreamed of going. I am aware that the ending of Attack on Titan was quite controversial. I am open to receiving people’s honest opinions. However, I would appreciate it if you’d be kind to me. I am both hopeful and anxious about coming to Anime NYC, but I am certainly looking forward to it.

 Though his expression of excitement is admirable, Isayama’s statement hints that some fans may have made their distaste for the series finale personal. Despite any backlash though, Attack on Titan truly ended the only way it could. It was Isayama’s decision to not glorify the typical shonen hero by making sure that Eren isn&#39;t exactly redeemed by the end. Attack on Titan&#39;s Eren refuses to learn from his constant mistakes and his friends’ reliance upon him despite the red flags ultimately makes them complicit in his eventual choices.

In addition to the comments about kindness and anxiety, what sticks out about Isayama&#39;s statement is his comment about being open to receiving honest opinions. While Isayama himself probably didn&#39;t have a direct hand in the Attack on Titan anime, that series did make a few small but pivotal changes to Isayama&#39;s original ending. Notably, Eren and Armin&#39;s last conversation has a much different tone, with the latter being much more harsh and judgemental of his former friend&#39;s actions.

Regardless of whether the criticism over Attack on Titan&#39;s ending was warranted or not though, it appears like fan response took a decidedly nasty turn. Though Attack on Titan&#39;s ending will probably remain controversial, it is a shame that the series creator has to remind fans to be respectful when discussing it.

Attack on Titan is available now on Kodansha&#39;s manga app, K Manga.
