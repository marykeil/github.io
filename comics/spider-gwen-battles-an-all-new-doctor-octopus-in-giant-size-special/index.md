## Literature Review

Marvel celebrates the anniversary of its Giant Size comic issues with a Spider-Gwen adventure that sees her facing off against a new Doctor Octopus.




Marvel is preparing for Spider-Gwen’s biggest year ever in 2024 with the launch of her own Giant-Size issue where she fights a new Doctor Octopus, as well as an all-new limited series. With Gwen Stacy’s character more popular than ever, there’s never been a better time to check out her upcoming comics.




Giant-Size Spider-Gwen #1 and details on the Spider-Gwen: Smash limited series were announced during the Marvel: Amazing Spider-Man Gang War panel at LA Comic Con 2023. As detailed on Marvel&#39;s website, Giant-Size Spider-Gwen is a part of Marvel’s “50th anniversary celebration of the epic Giant-Size storytelling of 1970s,” which included monumental Marvel stories such as 1975’s Giant Size X-Men #1.



          

The writer of the upcoming Spider-Gwen comics, Melissa Flores, was interviewed by Marvel Comics Director of Talent Relations Rickey Purdin at the convention about the details of Gwen Stacy’s newest adventures. Flores stated in the interview, “Being given the opportunity to continue to develop those relationships in this one-shot was an unexpected jolt of euphoria that I never saw coming.”




                  Spider-Gwen&#39;s New Costume Makes Her Tougher Than Ever with Armored Redesign   The latest installment of the Contest of Chaos crossover finds Spider-Gwen in a medieval land, defending her castle with an all-new suit of armor.   


 Gwen Stacy Goes One-on-One With A New Doc Ock 

On March 6, 2024, Giant-Size Spider-Gwen by Melissa Flores and Alba Glez will continue this incredible trend of Spider-Gwen stories. The issue sees Gwen Stacy locked in a battle to save her best friend, MJ Watson of Earth-65, who is being hunted down by a new Doc Ock. Gwen is certainly no stranger to fighting variants of Doc Ock. This new variant, Orlando Octavius, is the adopted son of Otto Octavius who joins a group of villains to capture MJ and study the Carnage symbiote still lurking within her. This 2024 special edition with cover art by Bryan Hitch also reprints 2016’s Spider-Gwen #13 by Jason Latour and Robbi Rodriguez.

The Giant-Size adventure follows the release of the three-issue limited series, Spider-Gwen: Smash by Melissa Flores and artist Enid Balam, previously titled Spider-Gwen On Tour. In this series, which launches in December, Gwen and her band the Mary Janes are living their best lives as a band until a mysterious assassin threatens to ruin their tour. The series will see Gwen team up with the superstar Dazzler and battle Earth-65’s Hulk, which lines up perfectly with the &#34;Smash&#34; subtitle. With Melissa Flores given full writing duties on Gwen Stacy, she now has a chance to update her character with this Giant-Size comic to fit her own limited series continuity.






 Spider-Gwen Gets the Giant-Size Adventure She Deserves 
          

Gwen Stacy has had an excellent 2023 full of comic announcements and a prominent role in the film Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. This once shy and reserved Earth-65 Spider-Woman has come a long way from her debut in 2014’s Edge of Spiderverse. From facing Earth-65 Peter Parker aka the Lizard, to joining the Spider-Army and fighting her own Gwen variants, Spider-Gwen is more than ready to continue her growth with her upcoming series and her Giant-Sized adventures.



Spider-Gwen: SMASH #1 goes on sale Dec. 13, 2023 and Giant Size Spider-Gwen #1 will be released on March 6, 2024 from Marvel Comics!
