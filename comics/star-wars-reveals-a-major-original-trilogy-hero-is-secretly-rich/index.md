## Literature Review

Star Wars&#39; new crossover event has revealed that a hero from the original trilogy of films is secretly rolling in credits in the galaxy far, far away.





Summary

  R2-D2 has a surprising amount of credits and uses them to hire infamous bounty hunters IG-88 and 4-LOM to save C-3PO in Star Wars: Dark Droids: D-Squad #3.   It is possible that R2-D2 has access to Rebellion funds or has hacked into Imperial accounts to acquire his substantial amount of credits.   R2-D2&#39;s wise use of his funds and the help of these bounty hunters might just enable him to save his friend and end the threat of the Scourge in the Dark Droids crossover.  







A surprising Star Wars hero from the original trilogy is apparently quite wealthy. It&#39;s well-known and established that Princess Leia was rich, a fact that initially convinced Han Solo to rescue her from the Empire in A New Hope. However, the new Dark Droids crossover has revealed that a major Rebellion hero also has an impressive amount of credits at their disposal.

As seen in Star Wars: Dark Droids: D-Squad by Marc Guggenheim and Salva Espín, R2-D2 has been trying to save C-3PO, one of the very first droids corrupted by the sentient AI known as the Scourge who&#39;s converting droids all over the galaxy into its hivemind. To that end, the brave astromech is bringing together a whole team of droids to help him out. This includes the infamous droid bounty hunters IG-88 and 4-LOM from The Empire Strikes Back whom Artoo easily hires in the new D-Squad #3.

          




As confirmed by IG-88, Artoo apparently has a &#34;substantial amount of credits&#34; which he uses to buy his and 4-LOM&#39;s loyalty. As such, it&#39;s quite surprising that R2-D2 would have funds at all, let alone a sizable secret stash in the established Star Wars timeline.

 How Does R2-D2 Have So Much Money? 
He Likely Has Access To Rebellion Funds
          

It&#39;s certainly possible that Artoo has hacked into various Imperial accounts in the past and stolen credits from time to time. It certainly seems like something the little astromech would do, his own personal rebellion against the Empire. However, it&#39;s more likely that Artoo potentially has access to Rebellion funds to be used during operations and emergencies.

It&#39;s worth remembering that R2-D2 does belong to Commander Luke Skywalker, the hero who blew up the Death Star (with Artoo&#39;s help) and the Alliance&#39;s resident Jedi Knight. As such, it stands to reason that the astromech has a high enough clearance to access Rebellion finances. Then again, perhaps Artoo has some sort of side hustle that&#39;s never been seen before in the Star Wars canon (however unlikely).






 R2-D2 Is Using His Funds Wisely In Star Wars 
He&#39;s Got Two Infamous Bounty Hunters Working For Him
          

In any event, R2-D2 is clearly using his money wisely during the new Dark Droids crossover. After all, IG-88 and 4-LOM were hired by Darth Vader to find Han Solo during The Empire Strikes Back which certainly speaks to their respective reputations. Now that they&#39;ve been hired by the surprisingly wealthy R2-D2, the astromech might just have a change at saving his golden-plated friend and ending the galaxy-wide threat of the Scourge as the Dark Droids crossover continues.
