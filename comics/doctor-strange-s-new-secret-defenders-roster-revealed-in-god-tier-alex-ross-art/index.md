Warning: contains potential spoilers for Doctor Strange #13!




Doctor Strange’s new Secret Defenders roster is unveiled in a piece of god-tier Alex Ross art. Marvel has released Ross’ cover to Doctor Strange #13, revealing that the Sorcerer Supreme has brought together a new incarnation of the Secret Defenders to stop a sentient role-playing game that has taken over New York City. Doctor Strange has picked some truly surprising heroes for this new team, casting doubts on whether it will be effective.

Marvel shared Ross’ cover for Doctor Strange #13 with AIPT. The issue is written by Jed MacKay and drawn by Pasqual Ferry. Ross’ cover shows Doctor Strange and the Secret Defenders in the middle of a New York City sidewalk, people gaping all around them.

          

The new lineup for the Secret Defenders includes Strange, Hunter’s Moon, Black Cat and the Taskmaster.





 The Secret Defenders&#39; Time Has Come Again 
          

This is not the first incarnation of the Secret Defenders. In the 1970s, Doctor Strange was a member of the very first version of the group, which was famously billed as a “non-team.” Other members included the Hulk, Sub-Mariner and the Silver Surfer. Later, in the 1990s, Doctor Strange brought together another group, this time called the Secret Defenders. Unlike previous Defenders’ teams, the lineup of the Secret Defenders changed to suit the mission. The Secret Defenders starred in their own book, which ran for 25 issues. While there have been other incarnations of the Defenders since, the Secret Defenders concept had seemingly run its course–until now.

When Jed MacKay took over the scripting duties on Doctor Strange, he began by revisiting classic concepts, characters and stories from across the Sorcerer Supreme’s 60-year history. MacKay and Ferry began by closing the book on one of the character’s biggest mysteries: the War of the Seven Spheres. Mentioned but never seen during the 1990s, this was the biggest event of Strange’s career–and MacKay and Ferry gave readers a front-row seat to it all. The Secret Defenders were another chapter in Doctor Strange’s history, also from the 1990s, and now MacKay and Ferry are bringing the concept into the 21st century.

 Can Doctor Strange Hold the Secret Defenders Together? 
          

A hallmark of previous Secret Defenders’ teams was their volatile nature, and this new version will continue that. Doctor Strange has assembled a most unlikely squad, one that will be hard-pressed to work together. Strange has a grudging admiration for Black Cat, but Taskmaster and Hunter’s Moon are unknown variables who could jeopardize the mission. Both Taskmaster and Hunter’s Moon are loose cannons, and could send matters off the rails quickly. Alex Ross’ cover for Doctor Strange #13 introduces the new Secret Defenders, but this version may be over before it even starts.
