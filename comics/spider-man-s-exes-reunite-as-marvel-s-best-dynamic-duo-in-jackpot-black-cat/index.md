## Literature Review

Mary Jane and Black Cat are teaming up once again, and this time they&#39;ll be taking out a blackmailer while MJ shows off her new powers as Jackpot.




Spider-Man&#39;s exes Mary Jane Watson and Black Cat are officially reuniting to continue their tenure as Marvel&#39;s Dynamic Duo in an all-new series, Jackpot and Black Cat. Ever since their first team-up together in Jed MacKay and C.F. Villa&#39;s 2022 hit one-off, Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat: Beyond, these two Marvel heroines have become the talk of Marvel fans for being the ultimate duo that no one expected. Now, Mary Jane and Black Cat are teaming up for a third time following their pairing during Dark Web.




According to Marvel, Celeste Bronfman and Emilio Laiso&#39;s Jackpot and Black Cat will see the two heroes cross paths as they &#34;combine their wits, expertise and super-powers to take down an emerging new threat.&#34; This four-issue series will follow Mary Jane, newly dubbed under her hero name Jackpot, as she assists her friend Black Cat, who has become a victim of a major blackmail scheme that has forced her to commit &#34;a public and blatant crime spree.&#34;

 Jackpot and Black Cat #1 (2024)                  Writer: Celeste Bronfman   Artist: Emilio Laiso;   Cover Artist: Adam Hughes      



This arc will feature a major mystery for the heroes and readers to solve as they try to uncover the source of the blackmail. Anyone could be behind it, and fans won&#39;t be disappointed as it establishes a familiar face will be a &#34;classic Spider-Man villain&#34; who &#34;has history with at least one of our titular heroines.&#34;


 Jackpot and Black Cat Will Continue Mary Jane&#39;s Hero Evolution 
          




What&#39;s most exciting about this new series is that it will expand upon Mary Jane&#39;s role as one of the Marvel Universe&#39;s newest heroes. Writer Celeste Bronfman will be returning to the character for this series after being behind Mary Jane&#39;s debut as Jackpot in Amazing Spider-Man #925. While this will be the second time MJ has teamed up with Black Cat after gaining her abilities, it will be the first time she fights alongside her under her new superhero moniker. This opens the path for Jackpot to develop more as her own character and show her friend what she can do after being relatively inexperienced with her powers in Jed MacKay and Vincenzo Carratu&#39;s Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat. Bronfman even teases what lies in store for these two by mentioning how much she &#34;always loved the push and pull of their friendship. Expect them to butt heads through heists, betrayals and the unexpected!&#34;



 Which Spider-Man Villain Is Behind the Blackmail Scheme? 
          




Of course, another major draw of this new series is the promise that a classic Spider-Man villain will be returning to pull the strings as the antagonist. Since it&#39;s been hinted at that they have history with Mary Jane and/or Black Cat, this narrows down the long list of foes in Spidey&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery, but still leaves enough room for speculation. Despite their long Marvel history, it&#39;s best to look through interactions starting with 2018&#39;s Fresh Start relaunch.

With this in mind, one of the biggest potential culprits could be Mysterio given his immense history with Mary Jane as she worked with him starting in The Amazing Mary Jane #1. Another potential villain that could make a return is Kingpin. While he has officially retired from crime following the end of the Devil&#39;s Reign arc, he could still have a score to settle with Black Cat from his time as New York City&#39;s mayor. There&#39;s no shortage of potential Spider-Man villains who could appear in this storyline, and the buildup to solve the mystery could make the reveal incredibly satisfying.




Fans will be able to check out this new story beginning next year when Jackpot and Black Cat #1 hits stores on March 27, 2024. These two heroines have become a huge deal among the Marvel fan base as they&#39;ve shown they have so much in common to make a team-up work. Outside of being connected as Spider-Man&#39;s exes, Black Cat and Mary Jane are compelling characters who think two steps ahead, and this new story could set them up as the next big Marvel team for years to come.



Look for Jackpot &amp; Black Cat #1 on March 27, 2024 from Marvel Comics!
