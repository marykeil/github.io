## Literature Review

Spawn is a series rooted in supernatural horror, and the artwork on many of the covers makes that abundantly clear. Here&#39;s the 10 most spine tingling!




The very nature of Spawn is horrific, as the series deals exclusively in the most terrifying and disturbing corners of the supernatural. Created by Todd McFarlane, Spawn follows Al Simmons - a former special forces soldier who committed his entire life to killing people at the command of others, no questions asked - who was double-crossed and murdered by those he thought he could trust. Simmons winds up in hell upon his death, but given his proven skillset, hell had other plans for him. Rather than letting him rot in perpetual torment, the generals of hell gave Al a suit that granted him demonic abilities that practically no other superpowered being could match. With that, Al Simmons became Spawn.
Spawn’s original mission on Earth is to kill evil people and send their souls to hell, thereby building hell’s ever-growing army. His motives are strangely nuanced, as it’s good he’s stopping evildoers and protecting the innocent, but it’s bad that he’s making hell stronger in the process. Regardless of the overarching plot, however, nearly every issue of the comic series pitted Spawn against an increasingly horrifying demonic entity, and more often than not, that was indicated on the cover art.
Sometimes Spawn cover art would be more badass than scary - a sword-wielding warrior or a gun-toting soldier, for instance - or they’d simply be images of Spawn in different poses. But, on more than a few occasions (especially in the first 90 issues published in the ‘90s) those comic covers would show something truly shocking to let readers know exactly what they were in for. Here are the 10 most spine tingling Spawn covers from the ‘90s!

 10  The Violator’s True Form Is Horrifically Thrown Right In The Faces Of Spawn Readers 
Spawn #4 by Todd McFarlane
        

If someone never opened a Spawn book, and purely looked at the array of covers from the early days of the series, this would be their introduction to the Violator in his true form, and it is absolutely terrifying. The elongated face, impossible grin, sharp teeth, and horns are aspects of the horrific character design that seem to be jumping right from the page at the reader, as if daring them to open the comic and see - if this is just the cover - what level of horrors await within.
The image itself is pure nightmare fuel, while the forced perspective is startling, to say the least, which - in all honesty - is the perfect way to be introduced to the Violator.





 9  Spawn’s Grotesque, Rotting Face Is Sutured Down The Middle With A Shoelace 
Spawn #23 by Todd McFarlane
        

The sight of Spawn’s uncovered face is a shocking one, given that all of his flesh was melted and charred in the fire that killed his mortal body. But it’s made even more so with the addition of a suture prominently featured right in the middle of his face, one that was tied with a thick, dirty shoelace. While the image is disturbing, this cover is actually more interesting than horrific, as the story behind this injury is one many fans might be shocked by: Batman is to blame for Spawn’s disgusting scar.
During a previous crossover storyline, Batman threw a batarang right into Spawn’s face, creating a gashing wound. Here, Spawn is still suffering from that injury, with a shoelace literally holding his face together.





 8  The Clown Is Using A Human Head As A Hand Puppet 
Spawn #34 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

If Spawn fans thought the Violator in his true form was scary, then they’re not ready for his Clown persona - especially the way he’s depicted on this cover. The Clown - as he’s known when wearing this particular skin - has his grubby fingers woven beneath the flesh of a severed human head, with two of them protruding from the head’s eye sockets and a third coming out through his mouth.
The sight of this is repugnant, especially given the bloody knife the Clown is holding, indicating that he’s not just desecrating a corpse, he made it.





 7  Spawn Goes Full ‘Hellraiser’ As He’s Being Torn Apart By Chained Hooks &amp; Excited Demons 
Spawn #41 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

Being a demonic entity channeling the powers of hell, Spawn should be no stranger to Hellraiser-esque torture methods, especially given that he regularly uses a chain as a weapon himself. Well, if Spawn wasn’t familiar with these strange methods of pain (or pleasure) before this issue, he certainly was afterward.
Spawn is shown without his suit, his body cut in half at the waist, with his upper half hanging on ropes attached to impossibly long ropes, pulling him in every direction. Spawn screams in agony as the many demons perpetuate his suffering by crawling all over his mutilated body, ripping and shredding his innards with malicious smiles stretched across their despicable faces.





 6  Spawn’s Face Becomes A Monument To Abstract Horror 
Spawn #49 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

Sometimes true horror lies not in a gory scene or a disturbing image, but in the unexplained, an abstract sight that just makes one feel uneasy upon looking at it. This Spawn cover is a monument to such horror. Spawn’s normally iconic face is pulled and twisted into sharp expressions of visible pain and anguish - as if his agony was made manifest.
There’s no monster in this image, no bloody dismemberment or creative torture, just bizarre imagery of abstract suffering, with Spawn right at the center of it.





 5  A Tendril Of Sewn-Together Flesh Has Spawn Hopelessly Trapped 
Spawn #51 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

Something that looks as though it was sewn together from the flayed flesh of a dozen human victims before being stuffed with loose entrails to keep its shape, then finally animated into an aggressively violent creature, has Spawn in its clutches on this cover. This sentient tendril of sewn-together flesh has Spawn so well trapped beneath itself that the only part of him that’s visible is a single desperate hand hopelessly reaching for salvation, but to no avail.
This monster is grotesque, and the nature of how it was created allows one’s imagination to go to the darkest places possible.





 4  Spawn Gazes In On A Chained Man Grinning Insidiously With ‘X’ Bandages Over His Eyes 
Spawn #56 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

A naked prisoner, crouched and chained in a cold cell all alone, the moonlight making visible the many scars and gashes littering his body. Two white bandages making an ‘X’ cover each eye, the rest of his face drenched in shadow. Except for his smile. A smile that holds no joy, no happiness. Perhaps an ironically comical mania, but no genuine elation can be found here. Spawn looks in on this pathetic sight, his green eyes glowing with increasing intensity - perhaps with hatred, perhaps pity.
Without any context whatsoever, the imagery on this cover tells a disturbing story in itself, one that allows fans to fill in their own blanks, though with enough guidance to ensure that those blanks aren’t filled with anything good.





 3  ‘Spawn Was Here’ Written In The Clown’s Blood Behind His Dismembered Corpse 
Spawn #60 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

While the actual picture itself is a truly grisly sight, it’s actually more comical than anything else, especially when considering how deserving the victim of this violence truly is. The Clown is shown torn to pieces, utterly dismembered and effectively carved out like a fleshy pumpkin. His head is hanging from chained hooks, their placement forcing a mocking grin across his face. His bloodied, severed hand hangs by his head with the rest of his body stuffed in a trashcan behind him. On the wall right next to the Clown is a note written in his demonic green blood that reads, “Spawn was here”, the antihero’s comical attempt to sign his handiwork.
Despite being darkly humorous and completely deserved, the image itself is decidedly R-rated.





 2  Spawn’s Face Drenched In Shadow Reminds Fans Why They Were Afraid Of The Dark 
Spawn #70 by Todd McFarlane and Greg Capullo
        

This cover is a brilliant depiction of what one sees in the corner of their pitch-black room late at night, lying in bed, unable to sleep from the unnerving feeling of an accompanying, malevolent presence. While veteran fans know that this is just Spawn, and therefore there’s nothing to fear, someone who’s never read a Spawn comic looking at this cover might still find the image familiar, though in a half-remembered way that evokes paralyzing terror. The image itself is simple enough: Spawn’s glowing green eyes and gritty teeth are the only things visible on the cover, the rest of it is drenched in darkness.
On the surface, it may not seem like anything spectacularly horrific, but the feeling that this grim face exists in every shadow in the corner of every dark room around the world is a terrifyingly persistent one, as this Spawn cover reminds readers why they were ever afraid of the dark.





 1  A Painful Grin Stretched Across Spawn’s Rotting Face, Mouth Filled With Bugs, Maggots, &amp; Snakes 
Spawn #89 by Todd McFarlane, Brian Holguin, and Greg Capullo
        

Perhaps the most sickening depiction of the demon Al Simmons became when he accepted the role as a Hellspawn is shown on the cover of this issue. Spawn’s mask is removed, but it’s more than just a scared corpse that’s put on display, as his mouth is filled with maggots, his face is littered with bugs, and a snake slithers over his rotting flesh. All the while, Spawn has a painful, joyless grin stretched across his face, seemingly accepting the horrific fate he wrote for himself.
Every aspect of this cover is the very definition of spine tingling, making it one of the 10 Spawn covers from the ‘90s that falls deservedly into that category.
