# Robin Calls Out the 1 Justice League Hero He Doesn t Respect


## SUMMARY 



  As revealed in World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5, Robin holds a negative view of his teammate, Speedy due to their similarities to their respective mentors, Batman and Green Arrow.   Green Arrow has often been compared to Batman, with similarities in their rich boy origins and vigilante personas.   The Teen Titans team depicted in World&#39;s Finest has engaged readers with complex characters, featuring young protagonists who don&#39;t always act heroically, who continue to grapple with trust and identity.

## Literature Review

Each of the Teen Titans has strong opinions about their adult hero partner, but Robin reveals he thinks someone else&#39;s is trying to be Batman.




Warning: Spoilers for World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5!




DC&#39;s Teen Titans are most famously comprised of the sidekicks of Justice League members. While most of them have a deep respect for their own mentors, that doesn&#39;t mean their opinions of every member of the League have to be glowing. As a recent issue revealed, Robin holds one Justice League hero in little regard.

World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5 – written by Mark Waid, with art by Emanuela Luppachino and Steve Wands – finds the team attempting to help Wonder Girl and Aqualad navigate their burgeoning relationship. During a conversation with Wonder Girl, Dick Grayson notes that he and Speedy, Green Arrow&#39;s protégé, don&#39;t get along at all, even going as far as to hold it against his fellow young hero that, &#34;his mentor is a carbon copy of mine.&#34;

          




This comment gave many DC readers a solid chuckle – considering it is an accusation that&#39;s been lobbed against Oliver Queen for over 80 years, since the character&#39;s inception.


 Green Arrow Is More Than A Batman Derivative 
         



Green Arrow was created by Mort Weisinger. He first appeared in 1941&#39;s More Fun Comics #73.




Name this hero: a rich boy survives a traumatic event and uses his assets and determination to hone himself into a vigilante. He fights alongside his teenage ward, and owns automobiles thatis named after himself. Comic book readers have been comparing Green Arrow, Speedy, and the Arrowplane with Batman, Robin, and the Batmobile for ages. Green Arrow creator Mort Weisinger claimed he wasn&#39;t Batman while creating the character; he was inspired byvRobin Hood, and a 1940 serial called The Green Archer. Originally serving as a backup story to the tales of Doctor Fate and the Spectre in More Fun Comics, Green Arrow and Speedy soon gained enough popularity to start headlining the comic themselves.




When Dennis O&#39;Neill took over the character in 1969, he leaned even further into the Robin Hood connection. Oliver Queen lost his fortune, and became a more street-level hero, while also fighting for progressive societal causes. During the 1970s, he was often paired with Green Lantern, and the two would clash over their political beliefs while saving the world. Aside from this temporary fall from grace, Oliver Queen stayed largely unchanged throughout his comic book life. Unlike other Golden Age characters like Flash, the Sandman, or Green Lantern, the Green Arrow title was not handed off to other heroes. For better or for worse, Olly has always been Olly.



 Who&#39;s Afraid Of Big, Bad Batman 
          

World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans has done an excellent job of balancing Golden Age-style art and stories with more modern storytelling and humor. Creators Mark Waid and Emanuela Lupacchino reimagined the original Titans line-up, with fleshed-out characters who don&#39;t always do, or say, the most heroic thing. Later in issue #5, Speedy points out that while Robin asks for trust, he doesn&#39;t trust the rest of the team with his identity. Speedy srefers to the &#34;big, bad Batman,&#34; but only because Dick was holding back his real name out of fear of his mentor. It&#39;s not out of disrespect of Batman, but of a desire to better connect with his Teen Titans teammate.






World&#39;s Finest: Teen Titans #5 is available now from DC Comics.
