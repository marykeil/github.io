## Literature Review

Batman and Wonder Woman have gone through some major injuries as superheroes, but Wonder Woman just experienced Batman&#39;s greatest injury.





Summary

  Wonder Woman gets attacked by Big Barda, who nearly breaks her back in a move reminiscent of Batman&#39;s iconic back-breaking in Knightfall.   Unlike Batman, Wonder Woman quickly recovers and gets back up to continue fighting.   This demonstrates Wonder Woman&#39;s incredible strength and resilience, as she easily shakes off an attack that left Batman out of commission for months.  







Wonder Woman&#39;s latest battle has resulted in an attack that will feel extremely familiar to fans of &#39;90s Batman stories. The Birds of Prey have drawn the attention of Wonder Woman, and what results is a fight that mimics the iconic back-breaking of Batman — in more ways than one. Unlike Batman, though, Wonder Woman gets right back up again.

Wonder Woman gets a knee to the back in Birds of Prey #4 by Kelly Thompson and Leonardo Romero. The Birds of Prey had originally planned to get in and out of Themyscira without attracting any attention, but as usual, things don&#39;t go according to plan. This draws the attention of Wonder Woman, who is not in the mood to talk — considering the Birds have been attacking her sisters.



          

This results in a high-powered brawl between Big Barda and Diana, and Big Barda manages to nearly break Diana&#39;s back in a move similar to Bane&#39;s in the iconic Knightfall story.




                  One Wonder Woman Tool is More Useful Than Any Weapon Batman Owns   Forget about Batman and his toys. Wonder Woman takes down a half dozen armed soldiers without breaking a sweat thanks to one impressive weapon.   


 Wonder Woman Nearly Has Her Back Broken by Big Barda 
          

Since Batman is merely a man without powers, he always tries to have an advantage during any fight he finds himself in. This has led to Batman being known as the man who always has a contingency plan, but even he&#39;s not above being taken by surprise. During the events of Knightfall, Bane broke Batman unlike any villain before him. Part of this was achieved by Bane waiting in the Batcave and attacking when Batman was least prepared. This famously led to Batman having his back broken, putting him out of commission for many months. This strategy is so good that it even seems to work on Wonder Woman.




One of the safest areas in DC is Themyscira. Few villains would attempt to attack an island full of trained warriors who also have a direct link to the gods. Because of this, Wonder Woman feels especially safe in Themyscira and certainly isn&#39;t expecting to be attacked when she&#39;s there. But when the Amazons send out a distress signal due to the Birds of Prey, Diana gets there as fast as she can and is quickly taken by surprise by Big Barda. Big Barda is a New God and has unbelievable strength — strength that she uses to recreate the moment Batman&#39;s back was broken by Bane.



 Batman&#39;s Back Was Broken In An Iconic Moment 
          

When Batman&#39;s back was broken, he was out of his costume for months, and he had to spend a long time training — making the battle a major win for Bane. When Big Barda attempts to snap Wonder Woman&#39;s back, it doesn&#39;t seem to do anything more than anger her, as Diana is shown back up and ready to fight only seconds later. Wonder Woman is one of the most powerful characters in the DC Universe, and she definitively proves that by easily shaking off an attack that left Batman out of commission for months — despite taking the hit from one of DC&#39;s most powerful New Gods.
