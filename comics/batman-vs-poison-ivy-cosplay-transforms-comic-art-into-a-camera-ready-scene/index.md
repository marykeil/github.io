## Literature Review

A Batman and Poison Ivy cosplayer have joined forces to recreate one of DC legend Jason Fabok&#39;s most iconic and lethally gorgeous comic covers.




Poison Ivy and Batman, known for their long and deadly history in comics, have seen their iconic rivalry come to life through the impressive collaboration of two fans. This stunning cosplay is a hypnotizingly gorgeous creation and is elevated by its faithful recreation of one of DC&#39;s most memorable comic covers.




Taïr Hamou, embodying the plant-themed villain, and Bat Mateo, donning The Dark Knight&#39;s cape and cowl, have seamlessly brought the historic rivalry between Batman and Poison Ivy from comic book pages to life in their striking collaboration. Shared on Instagram, the culmination of their efforts showcases Batman ensnared in the intricate web of vines, with a triumphant Poison Ivy standing confidently over her captive.


 

The immersive experience of this cosplay was elevated through the digital editing expertise of Wens Universe. Responsible for bringing Ivy&#39;s plant-based powers to life, Wens Universe added a stunningly gorgeous and deadly touch to the portrayal, enhancing the overall impact of the scene.


 Batman vs Poison Cosplay Recreates Iconic Jason Fabok Cover 


          




This god-tier collaboration masterfully recreates Jason Fabok&#39;s cover for Detective Comics #14, a joint effort by Fabok, artist Andy Clarke, and writer John Layman. Just like the original artwork, the cosplay portrays a prone Batman ensnared in Ivy&#39;s vines, with a victorious and predatory gleam in her eyes as she caresses him. Impressively, Wens Universe&#39;s editing skills recreate the abstract bat shape of the vines, staying true to Fabok&#39;s artistic vision. The meticulous attention to detail exhibited by Hamou, Mateo, and Universe in crafting this masterpiece is truly exceptional and would undoubtedly earn the admiration of even Fabok himself.

This cosplay delves even deeper into the source material that inspired it by featuring a quote that perfectly encapsulates Poison Ivy&#39;s character: “I’m Poison Ivy, guardian of the garden you’ve so fortuitously fallen into.” This quote also aptly summarizes the unfolding situation between her and Batman, adding an extra layer of authenticity. The cosplayers&#39; love for the source material is evident in their meticulous use of canon material, from the recreation of familiar artwork to the inclusion of the perfectly applicable quote. This attention to detail pays homage to the characters and also enhances the enjoyment for fans familiar with the original material.

Hamou treated her followers to a solo picture, showcasing herself as the Queen of Green. Wens Universe&#39;s digital artistry is once again on full display as Ivy is bathed in golden sunlight and surrounded by lush foliage. The scene looks as if it were taken straight from the Garden of Eden and features an equally fitting quote: &#34;It took God seven days to create paradise. Let’s see if I can do better.&#34; This powerful and entirely badass quote, coupled with Hamou&#39;s awe-inspiring cosplay, emphasizes the need for Poison Ivy to make her live-action debut in this modern era of DC.
