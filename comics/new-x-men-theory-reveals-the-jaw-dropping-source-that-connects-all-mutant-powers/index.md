# New X-Men Theory Reveals the Jaw-Dropping Source That Connects ALL Mutant Powers


## SUMMARY 



  Immortal X-Men #18 contains a gamechanging suggestion that mutants are not products of science, or evolution, but rather beings of magic, connected to the White Hot Room.   Despite their science fiction background, mutants have long been connected to occult aspects of the Marvel Universe, as explored in various storylines and characters, and this new information takes that to the next level.   The mutants may be the Children of Arcana, rather than Children of the Atom, as Marvel embraces a more magical nature to their existence

## Literature Review

The source of mutant power has been long debated, but a throwaway line from one of the X-Men&#39;s greatest threats changes everything fans know.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Immortal X-Men #18There has always been plenty of speculation surrounding the power source of the X-Men and their fellow Children of the Atom. Initially, it was theorized that the mutants’ abilities were derived form nuclear radiation, with later retcons establishing that their gifts are the result of the vaunted X-Gene. However, one of mutantkind’s most dangerous foes just hinted that the X-Men aren’t creatures of science – they’re beings of magic.




Immortal X-Men #18 – by Kieron Gillen, Juan José Ryp, David Curiel, and VC’s Clayton Cowles – features the culmination of Mother Righteous’ machinations against the X-Men. The Sinister clone explains how she managed to shunt the citizens of Krakoa to the famous White Hot Room after the Hellfire Gala, as a stepping stone to her ascension.

          

Thinking to herself, “I made the mutants all want to go to the place mutants are all kind of connected to. The White Hot Room,” Righteous changes what fans know about mutantkind with one throwaway line. Thile this is far from the first time the X-Men have been connected to this Room, this revelation recontextualizes years of mutant lore.

                  X-Men Finally Reveals The Terrible Secret Behind The Coming Dominion   Immortal X-Men #18 reveals the dark secret of the coming Dominion, unveiling that the celestial AI is Enigma, the 5th &#34;child&#34; of Nathaniel Essex.    





 Mutant Magic Has Been Around For Ages 
          

The White Hot Room itself is essentially the font of all creation, a plane outside and above the very Marvel multiverse described in this issue as “where creativity starts.” Time and again, it’s been established that the Phoenix and Jean Grey are intrinsically linked to the Room, but the notion that all of mutantkind stems from this plane actually makes a lot of sense. After all, this deep connection would explain why only mutants are able to mine Mysterium – the alloy that comprises Iron Man’s latest suit – from the White Hot Room, as they are the only beings capable of ascending to their plane of origin.

Mother Righteous herself says, “any sufficiently advanced mutation is indistinguishable from magic,” and despite their seemingly science fiction background, the mutants have long been tied to some of the more occult edges of the Marvel Universe. This notion that mutants are strangely connected to mystical forces is one that’s explored by Brian Michael Bendis during his time in the X-Office, specifically through the fan-favorite character Magik. And even more recently, Apocalypse’s time in the Krakoan Age has taken a decidedly sorcerous turn, especially within the pages of series like Excalibur – by Tini Howard, Marcus To, and more – and in X-Men Red, by Al Ewing, Federico Blee, et al.






 The X-Men Could Be The Children Of Arcana 
          

Often called the Children of the Atom, the X-Men have usually been considered to be creations of science fiction, first appearing in an era kickstarted by the Atomic Age. That said, if what Mother Righteous declares in Immortal X-Men #18 can be taken at face value, it is clear there is a more mystical nature to the mutants of the Marvel Universe than ever previously realized. Whatever the case ultimately turns out to be, the Fall of X has at least proven that there’s more magic behind Marvel Comics’ X-Men than anyone ever realized, and as this latest revelation suggests, the White Hot Room will be pivotal to the future of mutantkind.
