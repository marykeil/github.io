## Literature Review

DC Comics has more than a few queer heroes, but the DCU&#39;s first openly gay hero has made a long overdue comeback — with a somewhat familiar look.





Summary

  DC Comics&#39; first openly gay hero, Extraño, makes a comeback in a holiday anthology, reemphasizing his place in the DCU.   Extraño&#39;s appearance in the anthology resembles Marvel&#39;s Doctor Strange, signaling a potential relaunch and redemption for the character.   DC Comics recognizes the importance of Extraño as a LGBTQIA&#43; hero and is actively working to give him the attention he deserves.  







These days, DC Comics has more than a few LGBTQIA&#43; heroes — like Dreamer, Apollo, Batwoman, Nubia, and more — reminding readers just what positive representation looks like. But DC&#39;s first openly gay hero, Extraño, is reemphasizing his place in the DCU – and sporting a Doctor Strange-inspired outfit while he does it.

The short story “It’s A Bunkerful Life” by Josh Trujillo, Andrew Drilon, and Lucas Gattoni — featured in DC’s ‘Twas The ‘Mite Before Christmas holiday anthology — reunites Extraño with fellow queer hero, Bunker, as he reminds the former Teen Titan of the difference he makes simply by existing in the world. As Bunker’s foe is mysteriously teleported to a nearby prison, the young Titan remarks on the strangeness of the situation, only for Gregorio de la Vega to correct him by saying, “Not Strange…” before Miguel recognizes the hero at his side.



          




Appearing out of a mystical portal, Extraño’s appearance does bear a striking resemblance to that of Marvel Comics’ Master of the Mystic Arts. And with all Extraño’s been through, he’s more than earned some of Strange’s heroic cache.

                  Twas the Mite Before Christmas #1 Shows Why DC&#39;s Holiday Comics Are Appointment Reading (Review)   Mischief, mayhem, and mites unite in a can&#39;t-miss DC Christmas special featuring fan favorites like Superman, Harley Quinn, and John Constantine.   


 DC&#39;s Extraño Has Had a Strange Journey 
          

Created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton as one of the fabled New Guardians during the Millennium storyline, Gregorio de la Vega is a powerful sorcerer recruited to be gifted with cosmic knowledge, power, and immortality by the Guardians of the Universe — who, of course, created the Green Lantern Corps. During his initial appearances, Extraño was arguably portrayed as an over-the-top caricature of a gay man before creators decided to redesign the character with a more traditionally “masculine” costume and eventually write him off. Gregorio would remain in comic book limbo for decades before returning in Midnighter and Apollo #2 by Steve Orlando, Fernando Blanco, and Romulo Fajardo Jr. as a more seasoned sorcerer – a role in which he’s clearly still comfortable.




While his appearance in this issue isn’t his first resurgence out of obscurity, Extraño’s borrowing a page from Stephen Strange’s grimoire could be just what he needs to relaunch himself as a mainstay of the DC Universe. After all, in many ways, Gregorio is already a Dr. Strange pastiche, and directly setting himself up as one of comics’ staunchest mystics in a manner akin to the Sorcerer Supreme would certainly fill a void within DC Comics’ pantheon. And after the disservice rendered to Extraño in his earlier incarnation, this would also serve as a great redemption arc for an oft-mistreated and overlooked hero.



 DC’s First Gay Hero Deserves Better – And DC Knows It 
          

Extraño might not be the first hero that springs to mind when it comes to positive queer representation in DC Comics, but it’s clear the publisher is intent on making amends with Gregorio de la Vega. The former New Guardian is a relatively obscure hero, but that doesn’t negate the impact his very existence has on the DC Universe in both the past and the present. And whenever DC Comics becomes serious about finding its own Doctor Strange, Extraño has already proven himself to be the perfect candidate.
