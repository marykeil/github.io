## Literature Review

This year, DC introduced CITY BOY, a hero who can talk to cities; meanwhile, Marvel introduced THE IMPOSSIBLE CITY, a hero who is, itself, a city.




DC and Marvel introduced two exciting new characters this past year, with powers that make them a natural, if unconventional, fit for a team-up – leading fans to suggest that the next big crossover between the two major comic book companies should be a meeting between DC&#39;s City Boy and Marvel&#39;s latest Avenger, the Impossible City.




City Boy, DC&#39;s exciting newcomer, possesses the ability to communicate with cities, gifting him the unique opportunity to explore the famous major urban environments of the DC Universe. Meanwhile, Marvel&#39;s Avengers series has added the title&#39;s most fascinating character of the year, hands-down: the sentient city, and orbital fortress, known as the Impossible City.

         

In addition to being a member of the team, the Impossible City will serve as the Avengers new base. The new character has been teased to have a long, complicated history – one that a character like City Boy would be absolutely perfect to help uncover the mysteries of.


 City Boy Has Already Met Some Of DC&#39;s Greatest 
         






City Boy #1 – written by Greg Pak, with art by Mingkyu Jung – was released in May, 2023. The character previously debuted in DC&#39;s Wildstorm 30th Anniversary Special in 2022, and the Lazarus Planet: Legends Reborn one-shot from January, 2023, before receiving his own ongoing series.




In the short time since his inception, City Boy has been on a whirlwind tour of the DC Universe, and has already interacted with many of the company&#39;s greatest characters, and their cities – including Superman and Metropolis, as well as Nightwing and Bludhaven; City Boy even recently proved his powers extend to communicating with an ant hill, subsequently leading to a touching encounter with Swamp Thing. By far, this new character possesses the most dynamic and entertaining set of powers displayed by a new DC character, certainly in the past calendar year – and Marvel&#39;s equivalent would be a dream companion for City Boy.



The Impossible City joined Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes in October 2023&#39;s Avengers #6 – written by Jed MacKay, with art Ivan Fiorelli – after debuting several issues earlier.







In its most innovative contribution to Marvel lore so far, the latest volume of Avengers introduced the Impossible City, an intelligent city with the ability to communicate – and then, by the conclusion of the arc where I. City first appeared, went a step further by inducting the City into the team&#39;s ranks. The potential storytelling dynamics inherent in this character and City Boy&#39;s related power sets are rich, and tantalizing to fans of DC and Marvel. Certainly, crossovers between the two companies are rare enough, but when the time comes for the next one, City Boy and Impossible City would make a noteworthy duo.



 City Boy Can Speak The Impossible City&#39;s Language 
         

Much of City Boy&#39;s journey so far has been about learning how to use his powers to effectively communicate with cities, which are certainly alive, but not sentient – the Impossible City is the exception to this rule, a fully intelligent urban environment. It would be able to communicate with City Boy directly in a way other cities can&#39;t, while at the same time, City Boy&#39;s powers would allow him to communicate with I. City in a completely unique way, unavailable to any hero in the Marvel Universe – making the two new characters an immediate fit for one another, and a no-brainer for an inter-company crossover, even just as a one-shot special.




With these two recently introduced characters, City Boy and the Impossible City, quickly being established in positions of prominence in their respective universes, fans can be expected to engage with them, and become familiar with them, by speculating about what more could be done with them. As has long been the case, forecasting crossovers between DC and Marvel remains a favored way for fans to get excited about both companies&#39; rosters of titles, and to push both publishers to take exciting chances with new characters that have stood out and grabbed readers attention, as DC&#39;s City Boy and Marvel&#39;s Impossible City have done this year.
