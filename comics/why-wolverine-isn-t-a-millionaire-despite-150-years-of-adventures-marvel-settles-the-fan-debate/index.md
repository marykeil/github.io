## Literature Review

Wolverine&#39;s long life could have been devoted to making him a wealthy man; instead, he has eschewed financial security in favor of a humble life. 




Wolverine has lived a life of adventure for over a century and a half, which has given some Marvel fans cause to speculate that he might have accrued significant financial assets throughout his long life – a theory X-writer Benjamin Percy dispelled with a simple, yet obvious answer: every cent Logan ever earned, he spent.




Speaking with AIPT for their X-Men Monday series, Percy, alongside fellow writer Victor LaVelle, discussed their upcoming projects featuring the iconic mutant, including the looming &#34;Sabertooth War&#34; – and in the process, the duo were gracious enough to answer several fan-submitted questions, including a query about Wolverine&#39;s finances.

          

Answering humorously, but not flippantly, Benjamin Percy responded to the question about Wolverine&#39;s potential wealth with the suggestion that whatever money Logan had acquired over the years, between his preferred vices and his penchant for helping the less fortunate, there would be nothing substantial left in his bank account in the present day.

                  10 Children of Wolverine Who Were Just As Deadly   Wolverine has many sons and daughters in the Marvel multiverse, but only a few of Logan&#39;s children can truly claim to be as deadly as their father.   





 Wolverine Doesn&#39;t Need A Savings Account 
         

Part of what makes Wolverine such an engaging character is his status as the consummate wayfarer – one way or another, he&#39;ll get where he&#39;s going, he&#39;ll get by on whatever he needs to. The character is, without fail, depicted as being uninterested in wealth, or any of sedentary society&#39;s trappings. More than the result of an animalistic nature, Logan&#39;s lifestyle represents a classic American countercultural ethos. Given his long personal timeline, Wolverine could have enriched himself several times over throughout the decades – but as author Benjamin Percy told AIPT, there&#39;s a simple reason why he hasn&#39;t.

&#34;What he didn’t spend on rotgut whiskey, he probably gave away, because he’s a big mean softie,&#34; Percy explained. Sure, Logan will always need money to spend on cheap booze at one dive bar or another; considering the copious amount of alcohol he&#39;s been known to consume, this would require a decent amount of cash on hand. Beyond that, aside from cigars, the occasional new leather jacket, and a working motorcycle, Wolverine doesn&#39;t need much. As Percy suggests, any large sum of money Wolverine comes into, he would likely quickly unburden himself of by giving to those who need it more.






 Wolverine Is Better Off Broke &amp; Free 
          

While a rich, industrialist version of Wolverine sounds like a great premise for a &#34;What If...?&#34; story, the classic version of the character most beloved by readers is designed to live a bare, Spartan existence. Writer Benjamin Percy emphasized this point with his comment – in many ways, Logan lives for his vices, and thankfully for the Marvel Universe at large, that includes helping people, rather than hording wealth. Having been born a Howlett, a well-off family for the time period, the character&#39;s very origins involve a rejection of luxury, and through all the ensuing years, Wolverine has never had the makings of a millionaire.
