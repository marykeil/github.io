# Deadpool s Healing Factor is The Opposite of Wolverine s, Not The Same


## SUMMARY 



  Deadpool and Wolverine have similar powers, but their healing factors work differently.   Deadpool&#39;s healing factor was designed specifically for him and does not heal injuries, but rapidly creates cells being killed by his cancer.   Wolverine&#39;s healing factor constantly heals his body to its original form, but he cannot grow back lost limbs like Deadpool can.

## Literature Review

Deadpool and Wolverine seem as though they have the same exact healing factors, but the two abilities are opposites and perfectly suited for each!




There are many similarities between Deadpool and Wolverine, but the mutant healing factor fans believe to be the same between the two couldn’t be more different. They may be effectively immortal and unkillable, but the way their abilities work within their bodies is not what most fans assume.




As shown in Deadpool #3 written by Daniel Way with art by Paco Medina, Juan Vlasco, and Marte Gracia, the true nature of Deadpool&#39;s healing factor is explained. While Wade wasn’t born with his healing factor, he is the only living organism it was designed and works for. When Skrulls try to steal Deadpool’s powers to make a Deadpool-Skrull army, they hope the ability will make their soldiers as unkillable as Wolverine.

          

What they don’t account for, however, is the unique properties of Deadpool’s healing factor. Instead of healing from injury, the soldiers experience rapid growth of cells created throughout their body, turning them into grotesque and useless horrors.


 Wolverine is a Healing Mutant, But Deadpool Never Actually Was 
          




As opposed to Wolverine, who was born with a healing factor as part of his inherited mutation, Deadpool was given his power through highly advanced experimentation which turned him from a normal human to a human weapon. Aside from the training Wade Wilson had under his belt working as a mercenary, he had no natural-born abilities -- because he is a mutate, not a mutant.

Since Wade wasn’t born with mutant powers, his body reacted differently to the introduction of mutated cells, mutilating his face, ravaging his mind, and turning Wade Wilson into the Deadpool fans know and love today. Deadpool’s healing factor, since it was engineered and not produced naturally in his body, was specifically made for him. Wade suffered from cancer before taking part in Weapon X experimentation, so his healing factor was designed to constantly recreate cells that were constantly being killed by his cancer.



 Wolverine Has a True Healing Factor, As Fans Understand It 
          




By contrast, Wolverine’s power is constantly healing itself to its original healthy form, including the constant fight against Logan&#39;s adamantium poisoning. This distinct difference has always presented itself any time Deadpool has lost a limb. Whenever Deadpool loses an arm in a sword fight or is torn in half, he always grows his limbs back. Wolverine, however, cannot grow his limbs back (as shown through his Age of Apocalypse variant who lost a hand that didn’t replace itself). Wolverine’s wounds may heal like anyone else&#39;s, but the limb is lost, and can&#39;t recreate missing cells like Deadpool.

Deadpool and Wolverine’s healing factors may seem like they are the same, but in fact they are very much opposites.
