## Literature Review

The Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;s Mantis just explained her new powers to Gamora, and it turns out her costume is a multiversal spin on Venom&#39;s symbiotes.




Warning: Spoilers Ahead for Guardians of the Galaxy #9!The Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;s Mantis has just revealed a clever new take on Venom in the form of a new costume. Venom and his massive family of symbiotes have been the center of some of Marvel&#39;s most popular stories ever since Spider-Man first came into contact with the creature in 1984&#39;s Secret Wars event. There have been countless iterations of the symbiote that have found their way around the universe, granting hosts exceptional abilities throughout the years. However, a new Guardians of the Galaxy costume has given the symbiote a fresh new spin.




In Guardians of the Galaxy #9 by Collin Kelly, Jackson Lanzing and Kev Walker, Gamora and Mantis head to Earth to find the synthetic being known as &#39;Multitude&#39; in the hopes of getting the Soul Stone to help Drax. On their journey, the two discuss things that Groot gave them to retain their personalities ever since they assimilated with his Grootspace form. Mantis reveals that her item is actually a living garment she calls Dress, which attaches to her and links with her personality.



          

What makes Dress unique is that she&#39;s able to mold herself to fit the situation based on Mantis&#39; personality, seemingly even granting her weaponry based on her outlook - just as the Venom symbiote does for its hosts. Similarly, the Venom symbiote was first introduced as a new costume, before it was eventually revealed to be an alien being which was influencing Spider-Man, bringing out his inner darkness.




                  One Guardians of the Galaxy Character Was Briefly A DC Hero   Decades ago the legendary Steve Englehart, creator of the character Mantis, took the Celestial Madonna with him to DC, Eclipse, and Image comics!    


 Is Guardians of the Galaxy&#39;s Dress a Symbiote? 
Dress Behaves Like Venom, But Seems Less Predatory
          

In recent comics, Mantis has been drastically changing her appearance and behavior. It turns out that following her son&#39;s villain turn in Empyre, she&#39;s been tapping into the multiverse and trying out different personas from her variants in an attempt to find herself. Dress has been along for the ride, making it so that whatever persona Mantis slips into, she has the look and equipment to match - including some powerful weaponry.

When looking at who and what Dress is, it seems like she could just be another variation of the dreaded Klyntar species, aka the symbiotes. The Collector told Mantis that Dress &#34;had thoughts and feelings,&#34; meaning she&#39;s sentient. She also attaches herself to Mantis to aid in combat, similar to what characters like Venom and Carnage do with Eddie Brock and Cletus Kasady. But there&#39;s one thing that drastically separates herself from Venom&#39;s species: Dress doesn&#39;t seem to be parasitic. She doesn&#39;t require the constant need to feed on something to survive, and doesn&#39;t appear to make demands of Mantis. Unlike Venom&#39;s usual hosts, Dress and Mantis are partners.






 Dress Has a Powerful Link to the Multiverse 
Mantis Has Become One of the Guardians&#39; Mightiest Heroes
          

Something that really sticks out about Dress regarding her potential is her ability to reach out across the multiverse. Mantis explains that Dress has been helping her to &#34;surf the multiversal personality bank&#34; in her quest to be herself. This search has included a battle-armored Mantis, a cannon-armed cyborg, a goth mystic, a ballerina, a Western-era entertainer and many more. It&#39;s an interesting way to explore Mantis&#39; other lives on the multiversal plane, making Dress a powerful ally in combat when the two work in tandem. Dress&#39; only limit seems to be that Mantis&#39; equipment must be possessed by one of her variants somewhere in the multiverse.

Dress ultimately opens up a whole new branch of possibilities that Marvel can explore in future stories. Given that Mantis has found her companionship with Dress to be a healthy and necessary one, it&#39;s unlikely that the two will separate soon. This new take on Venom and the idea of a powerful symbiote costume is giving her a whole new character outlook as her story continues with the Guardians of the Galaxy.
