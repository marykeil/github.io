## Literature Review

As the anti-alien group Blue Sky try to spread fear of Superman, DC fans get to see Metropolis&#39; hidden fear of the Super-Family.




Warning: contains spoilers for Action Comics #1059!Batman has long presided over the most feared superhero family in DC canon, but now Superman is coming for the title - even though he doesn&#39;t want it. While being attacked by a group of creepy bat-ninjas is certainly a terrifying idea, having to deal with a family of godlike beings is much scarier - as DC just confirmed.




Readers first get to see just how terrifying Superman&#39;s family actually is to the criminals of Metropolis in Action Comics #1059 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, Eber Ferreira, Matt Herms, and Dave Sharpe. This preview opens with a group of criminals trying to flee from a crime, only to be stopped by who they believe to be the Super-Family.

          

Usually, criminals try their best to escape DC&#39;s superheroes, even if it&#39;s hopeless. But when faced with the Super-Family, one of the criminals outright begs to just stop the car, admitting that there&#39;s no point in even trying to get away. This is a stark contrast to the criminals of Gotham, who open up with gunfire once a member of the Bat-Family is spotted. Sadly for the criminals however, the &#39;heroes&#39; who descend on them are actually Blue Sky killers, out to ruin Superman&#39;s reputation.

 Superman&#39;s Family Have A Terrifying Reputation In Metropolis 
And Now It&#39;s Being Wielded by His Villains
         

Gotham City is a dark and dangerous place - one of the most dangerous cities in the DC Universe, which is why it takes Batman and his extended Bat-Family to keep crime under control. But since Batman and his family are just humans, they often rely on fear to make criminals second guess fighting them or even committing crimes in the first place. This is an effective tactic, but the fact the Bat-Family are just humans is well known in their city - there&#39;s always some possibility to escape, even if it&#39;s just lucky timing. However, against a family of Kryptonians, there&#39;s no such hope for normal people.

Almost every single member of Superman&#39;s family has powers in one way or another. This is a fact that&#39;s well known by just about everyone in Metropolis, criminals included. There&#39;s simply no way to try and escape from a hero who can move faster than a speeding bullet, let alone an entire family of heroes who have such speed. Indeed, in DC&#39;s far future, Superman&#39;s family have been shown to grow into a dynastic group known as the House of El, becoming a major political force in the galaxy. For two thieves in a car, hope vanishes the moment they see a figure in the sky. Now, the Blue Sky group have stolen Kryptonian powers, and they intend to make Superman&#39;s city fear him like never before.






 Superman&#39;s Family Is Terrifying To Criminals 
But Blue Sky Wants The Terror to Spread


          

Batman fancies himself the master of fear, but DC fans just saw how Metropolis&#39; criminals react when they think Superman&#39;s family is after them, and it&#39;s way more extreme than Gotham&#39;s hardened criminals. And as the anti-alien hate group Blue Sky use stolen Kryptonian powers to attack the city, that fear is only likely to grow more intense - and spread to innocents. Superman&#39;s pure heart and goodness make him a symbol of hope, but those targeted by his family of gods still know to be terrified when they see a floating figure in the sky.
