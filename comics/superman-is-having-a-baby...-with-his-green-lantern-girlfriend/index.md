# Superman Is Having a Baby... With His Green Lantern Girlfriend


## SUMMARY 



  Superman&#39;s estranged Green Lantern girlfriend, Hope, returns and reveals she is pregnant, potentially causing serious trouble in his relationship with Lois Lane.   The out-of-continuity story of Superman: Lost depicted Clark&#39;s time in space and his close relationship with Hope, though the nature of their relationship was left vague.   While Superman and Lois have overcome many obstacles, having a baby with another woman may be too much for their relationship to handle, causing complications and potential rifts.

## Literature Review

Superman and Lois Laneâ€™s relationship is finally on solid ground, but can they survive Clark having a baby with his Green Lantern girlfriend?




Warning! Spoilers head for Superman: Lost #9!It&#39;s true, Superman is having a baby with his estranged Green Lantern girlfriend. After a rough adjustment period from being in space, Clark Kent and Lois Lane have finally worked things out. But their relationship may be in serious trouble after the Man of Steel&#39;s paramour walks back into his life carrying his baby.




In Superman: Lost #9 by Christopher Priest, Carlo Pagulayan, Jason Paz, Dan Jurgens, and Brett Breeding, Lois Lane is rapidly growing worse after Lex Luthor gave her cancer. Despite Superman&#39;s surprisingly violent desire for revenge, Lois takes care of the problem herself by confronting Lex and getting him to admit she was actually poisoned rather than given cancer.

          

After Lois takes the antidote, her condition improves and she and Clark finally seem to be on a better footing. However, Bruce Wayne stops by the couple&#39;s apartment, and reveals that Superman&#39;s Green Lantern ex-girlfriend Hope has found Earth and that she&#39;s pregnant.

The out-of-continuity story Superman: Lost saw DC&#39;s iconic hero experience a harrowing event when he traveled through a singularity and wound up a trillion lightyears from home. Stranded far away from home, Clark had no choice but to make a new life for himself. While away on a planet he came to call Kansas, Superman met a woman he called Hope, a woman who possessed a Green Lantern Power Ring (though she wasn&#39;t a member of the Corps). Clark lived with Hope for years, but their time together came to a violent end when he discovered Hope murdered one of his friends on Kansas to prevent Clark from leaving.

Fans may be incredibly shocked to see Hope return (not to mention seeing her pregnant). Superman and Hope were shown to be quite close in the years that Clark was lost in space. However, they were never shown to be physically intimate and the nature of whatever relationship they had was left vague. However, Hope was incredibly devoted to Superman and did everything in her power to keep him in her life. It&#39;s hard to imagine who else the father could be. Unfortunately, the revelation of Hope&#39;s pregnancy could be the straw that breaks the camel&#39;s back and cause a rift that Superman and Lois won&#39;t be able to overcome.






 Will Superman&#39;s New Child Destroy His Relationship with Lois? 
          

Superman and Lois have weathered a lot of storms in Superman: Lost, from Clark&#39;s PTSD to Lois&#39; cancer scare and they&#39;ve largely come out of these trials stronger than before. However, Clark having a baby with another woman might be beyond the pale for Lois. Sure, Clark was gone for twenty years in space and wasn&#39;t certain if he&#39;d be coming home. But for Lois, Clark was only gone a day and her entire life changed almost in an instant. It&#39;s doubtful that Superman will abandon his wife to be with his Green Lantern lover, but his unborn child is undoubtedly going to complicate things with Lois in unimaginable ways.

Superman: Lost #9 is on sale now from DC Comics.
