## Literature Review

A confrontation between Supergirl and the Caped Crusader revealed Batman&#39;s contingency plan for taking down rogue Kryptonians using no weapons.




Contains spoilers for Batman / Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22!!




Batman is famed for his seemingly endless supply of contingency plans, and he has an answer to defeat nearly any foe, including Supergirl. Family and friends are not exempt from his strategies, either, and he has plenty of ways to deal with the most highly powered among them. Rather than rely on access to Kryptonite or the right gadget to face Kryptonians, he learned the specialized martial art, Klurkor.

Batman / Superman: World’s Finest #22 – by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, and Tamra Bonvillain, and Steve Wands – features Batman and Superman facing down brainwashed versions of their friends, who are convinced the real Bruce and Clark are their enemies. They’re outnumbered, and at a clear disadvantage, but when Supergirl goes after Batman, he still takes her down with ease.

          




Instead of reaching for something in his utility belt, Bruce dips into his knowledge of Klurkor – a martial art taught on Krypton. It proves highly effective, even against Supergirl’s incredible abilities. In this case, it doesn’t buy Batman enough time to win the overall battle, but it’s one more impressive tactic in his repertoire.


 Batman&#39;s Martial Arts Knowledge Extends To Extraterrestrial Techniques 
          

Batman survives in an overpowered world because of his remarkable dedication to knowledge. No one trains as intensely as Bruce Wayne, so it’s little wonder that he learned the basics of Klurkor. As long as he’s conscious, it gives him something to use against any Kryptonian foe, meaning he’s not at a complete loss without his usual collection of tech or a spare piece of Kryptonite. Despite him taunting Supergirl about not learning Klurkor, he isn&#39;t the only one who studied it. Lois Lane learned Klurkor on Kandor and has used it to protect herself multiple times. Another version of Supergirl did study Klurkor, as she trained with Batman and the Amazons.




Klurkor itself appears to be very similar to karate, though theoretically the moves would be specialized to counter Kryptonian speed and strength. Supergirl admits to only being trained at the first level, leaving only two humans (Lois Lane and Batman) to demonstrate its effectiveness. Still, both show that Klurkor gives them a major leg up. With so few people versed in that particular martial art, it also means few counters exist. Batman is a master of several Earth-based martial arts, too, but he&#39;s hardly the only one, and some people can match him in a toe-to-toe fight. Klurkor is unexpected, and that&#39;s a whole new advantage.



 Klurkor Is One Of DC&#39;s Most Underrated Fighting Styles 
          



Supergirl #40 was written by Jody Houser, with art by Rachael Scott. It was released in 2020.







The Klurkor fighting form is one of the most underrated elements of Kryptonian society, as depicted in the DC Universe. It is also one that is directly relevant, and useful, to all of DC&#39;s leading fighters. Batman takes full advantage of that against the World’s Finest Supergirl. Similarly, in Supergirl #40, Kara uses Klurkor in her favor. When gold Kryptonite temporarily cuts her off from her powers, she uses Klurkor to get back on her feet. It’s a temporary solution, just as it is for Bruce, but it works. Batman and Supergirl both know the power of Klurkor training, and it can make all the difference when fighting a Kryptonian.

Batman / Superman #22 is available now from DC Comics.
