## Literature Review

Kaiju No. 8 is already a highly anticipated anime, but it will also be the first anime ever to be available for streaming on social media.




Shonen Jump&#39;s latest and hottest anime Kaiju No. 8 is already standing among the crowd of new 2024 anime in a unique, unprecedented manner. As announced during Jump Festa, Kaiju No. 8 will be the first anime ever to stream on X.




This year&#39;s Jump Festa was jam-packed, to say the least. From the highly unexpected One Piece remake to the news of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s conclusion, it was no wonder that Kaiju No. 8&#39;s latest announcement went under the radar.


 

As well as receiving an exciting new trailer, it has been announced that Kaiju No. 8 will stream on X (formerly Twitter), making it the first time that an anime will be available on a social media platform.

                  Kaiju No. 8 Release Info, Trailer, &amp; Everything We Know So Far   Kaiju No. 8 brings hot shonen battle action in the world of giant monsters, and here&#39;s everything to know about the upcoming series.   


 Kaiju No. 8&#39;s Release Will Be The First Of Its Kind 
          




Naoya Matsumoto&#39;s manga is one of the publisher&#39;s most popular serializing manga at the moment, prompting a highly anticipated anime project. Set to premiere in April 2024, Kaiju No. 8 is one of the biggest and most anticipated anime of 2024, and this latest revelation just made it stand out even more. The anime was confirmed to air on Crunchyroll but the series will also be made available on X, according to the official account of the anime. This obviously left fans confused as this has never happened for not just anime, but also any movie or TV show. How this setup will work is still not known.


 

What is probably the most confusing part is how the production team will make back their money invested into the anime if it will be on a free-to-use platform. Anime is extremely expensive, and the cost only increases for action series such as Kaiju No. 8. The most plausible explanation is that fans will have to pay to watch the anime on X when it is out, paving the way for the social media giant to host series and movies on their site. This might be similar to Amazon Prime Video&#39;s formula where you can buy or rent a movie/TV episode.




          

This news isn&#39;t very surprising when you consider the dramatic changes X has gone through under the new leadership of Elon Musk. The site has offered a subscription plan for a blue checkmark, introduced job postings, and hosted more ads than ever, so this latest stunt may be yet another revamping of the platform to generate more revenue. What is interesting is that Kaiju No. 8 was selected as perhaps the first franchise in this new program, proving not only the series&#39; overwhelming popularity but anime as a medium&#39;s growing acceptance globally.
