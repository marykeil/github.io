## Literature Review

A flashback story reveals that Daredevil essentially screwed over the Marvel Universe in a big way, and if its heroes knew, they&#39;d hate him for it. 




Warning: Spoilers for Daredevil: Black Armor #1!If the heroes of Marvel knew how badly Daredevil set them up for failure, they&#39;d all hate him. Given their history with each other, there is no one who Daredevil hates more in life than Wilson &#34;Kingpin&#34; Fisk. However, without realizing it, the Man Without Fear paved the way for elevating Kingpin into his most powerful position.




Matt Murdock convinces Kingpin to pursue his biggest position of power yet in Daredevil: Black Armor #1 by D.G. Chichester, Netho Diaz, JP Mayer, Andrew Dalhouse, and VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles. The series serves as a prequel taking place back during Daredevil&#39;s iconic &#39;90s era of wearing a black and red armored suit.



          

However, readers have now learned that it is during this run that Daredevil inadvertently gave the Kingpin the idea to run for Mayor of New York City, opening the door for the chaos he created during the &#34;Devil&#39;s Reign&#34; story arc.

                  Daredevil: Black Armor #1 Adds Depth to an &#39;Extreme 90s&#39; Concept (Review)   Daredevil&#39;s Black Armor returns in a new miniseries that shows why this particular era of the character should not be ignored.   





 Daredevil Suggests Kingpin Runs for Mayor 
          

As the debut issue reaches its conclusion, Daredevil confronts Kingpin for the first time in his new costume. Wilson assures him that he&#39;s clean and is merely &#34;humbled by circumstance,&#34; though there are some things in the streets he&#39;s just so happened to hear as a self-proclaimed man of the people. Sarcastically agreeing with Kingpin&#39;s sentiment, Daredevil suggests Fisk should run for office. Kingpin admits he does like the sound of &#34;Mayor Fisk.&#34; While he would not act on his urge until some years down the line, Kingpin would take up Daredevil on his suggestion, becoming Mayor of New York City in the process.

In becoming mayor, Kingpin pushed a campaign of anti-heroism, proceeding to basically get superheroes banned from New York City. As a result, Kingpin not only oversaw the imprisonment of numerous superheroes in one fell swoop, his anti-hero rhetoric worked on the city&#39;s population. Even after he&#39;s out of office, most citizens remain sick of superheroes and believe they all deserve to be banned.






 Daredevil Made It Difficult to Be a Hero in New York 
          

Now more than ever, it is becoming increasingly hard to be a superhero in New York City and based on this new information, it&#39;s all thanks to Daredevil. Daredevil has been out of favor with superheroes already lately after starting his own cult and breaking supervillains out of prison. Luckily for him, most of that history has been undone and erased as Matt Murdock returned from Hell with a whole new life and identity as Father Matt. But this connection to Kingpin is enough to turn Marvel heroes against Daredevil all over again. If Fisk never ran for mayor, maybe the heroes wouldn&#39;t be in such turmoil that they&#39;re in now, but none of this turmoil would be possible if not for Daredevil.



Daredevil: Black Armor #1 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.
