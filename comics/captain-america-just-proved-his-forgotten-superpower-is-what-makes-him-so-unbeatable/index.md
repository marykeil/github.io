## Literature Review

Steve Rogers is well-known for his near-superhuman physique, but a daring confrontation proves there&#39;s more to Captain America than raw muscle.




Thanks to his trademark Super Soldier Serum, Captain America is Marvel Comics’ primary example of peak physical perfection. While Steve Rogers was infamously scrawny and weak prior to his participation in Operation: Rebirth, the Weapon Plus program heightened his physicality to incredible limits and ultimately made him one of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. But while Captain America’s strength and speed are no laughing matter, it’s really his heightened senses that make him such a formidable fighter.




Uncanny Avengers #4 by Gerry Duggan, Javier Garrón. Morry Hollowell, and VC’s Travis Lanham sees Captain America once again confronting his opposite number, Captain Krakoa. After realizing the identity of the man behind the mask, Steve launches a surprise attack on his unsuspecting foe and notes how powerful the hearing of his enemy is even when he’s not wearing his enhanced battle suit.

          

After a dramatic confrontation, the true identity of the Unity Squad’s false flag opponent – the Hydra-raised Steve Rogers of Secret Empire infamy – is unveiled, explaining just how Captain America knew just what to expect from his opponents’ senses. But if Captain Krakoa’s perceptions are strong enough that Captain America felt the need to be Fastball Specialed to take him by surprise, then that means Steve’s own hearing and situational awareness are beyond what anyone expected.

 There’s More To Captain America Than Muscle 
          

When Steve Rogers first became Captain America, it was abundantly and visually clear that the Super Soldier Serum transformed him to human physical perfection, and over the years he has repeatedly performed physical feats that may even place him in the superhuman range. However, Cap has just as often displayed an uncanny sensory awareness that is much harder to quantify and is less obvious unless fans realize that his senses were as enhanced as his muscles. While Captain America’s senses are clearly not on the level of a character like Wolverine or Daredevil, it’s clear that Steve’s visual and, more importantly, his auditory perception are still far above that of a normal human combatant.




There have been countless occasions where Captain America’s situational awareness has seemed borderline superhuman. But it’s this same awareness that has kept Steve alive through confrontations against way more powerful opponents such as Captain Krakoa and countless others. And considering how expertly he is able to sling his trademark shield at angles that seem to defy the laws of physics, Steve has to be able to perceive things in ways that no other person can.



 Steve Rogers&#39; Senses Are Supreme 
          

No matter how physically talented he may be, there’s no way that Captain America would be the fighter he is without the ability to see and hear what’s coming next. And his near-superhuman reflexes would be all-but-useless without incredible senses to let him know when and where to react. Otherwise, Steve Rogers would be a pretty lousy Super Soldier.




Captain America’s Super Soldier status usually gets harped on in reference solely to his physicality. But it’s abundantly clear now that Steve Rogers’ senses are just as enhanced as his. Brawn. In every way that counts, Captain America truly is Marvel Comics’ ideal for human physical perfection.

Uncanny Avengers #4 is available now from Marvel Comics.
