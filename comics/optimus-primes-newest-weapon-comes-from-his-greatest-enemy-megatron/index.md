## Literature Review

After losing his arm in battle, Optimus Prime has a new weapon to use against the Decepticons, but it comes from his greatest enemy: Megatron!




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Transformers #4




Optimus Prime has proven his mettle time and time again as the leader of the Autobot Transformers, but now he must borrow from his greatest enemy in order to survive in the new Energon Universe. The latest issue of Skybound’s Transformers sees Prime taking the iconic weapon of Megatron in a shocking twist fans certainly didn’t see coming.

Transformers #4 – from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten – picks up from the events of the previous issue, in which readers witnessed Optimus Prime losing his arm in a fight with Skywarp.

          

After using the Matrix of Leadership to restore the energy to a hospital, Prime is left with less resources to repair himself than ever. Autobot Ratchet tells Prime that he has one option to replace his missing arm, and readers learn what that is in an epic splash page: the left arm of Megatron, which has his iconic fusion cannon attached, in tow.

As Transformers fans will note, this is a major twist, one that could have major repercussions moving forward. Ever since Transformers #1 launched in October of last year, readers have wondered where Megatron has been. Transformers #4 finally provides an answer, as we learn that Megatron was thrown from the Ark during a battle with the Autobots, when it crashed on Earth centuries ago. The Decepticon leader landed somewhere in the arctic, where he has been frozen in the ice for centuries. However, before he was thrown from the Ark, Megatron apparently lost his arm, and fusion cannon along with it, which the Autobots escaped with following their flight from the Ark in Transformers #1.

Megatron’s fusion cannon comes from the original toy, which had an alt-mode as a pistol. The pistol had various attachments, including a scope that attached to the barrel. When transformed into a robot, the scope wound up on Megatron’s right forearm, which wound up being an iconic piece of the Decepticon leader’s arsenal. Even when Megatron was later portrayed as transforming into a tank, he always retained the fusion cannon on his arm. It’s unknown at this point in time whether Megatron will transform into a gun, like the classic G1 incarnation, although theories persist that Megatron might be hiding in plain sight all along in his famous alt-mode.






 Taking Megatron’s Arm Will Impact Optimus Prime Moving Forward 
          

Optimus Prime choosing to replace his arm with his greatest enemy’s could prove to have major ramifications for the Energon Universe. This decision could have repercussions for Prime&#39;s personality, or it could cause the Autobots under his command to look at him differently. Most crucially, if and when Megatron makes his grand return, he will seek to reclaim the lost part of him. Answers will come in future issues of Transformers, but until then, readers should be satisfied with the opportunity to have writer Daniel Warren Johnson interpret Prime’s truck mode with the fusion cannon thrown in. With any luck, Hasbro will turn Optimus Prime with Megatron’s fusion cannon arm into an official Transformers toy sooner rather than later.
