## Literature Review

Marvel has released a new trailer for Ultimate Black Panther #1, which will see T&#39;Challa fight the armies of Moon Knight. 




Warning: contains potential spoilers for Ultimate Black Panther #1!




Killmonger gets an amazing upgrade as the war between Black Panther and Moon Knight erupts in a brand-new trailer. Marvel has unleashed a new Ultimate Universe, full of new and unique spins on classic heroes. In the trailer for Ultimate Black Panther #1, fans get a tantalizing glimpse of a new Wakanda–but the country’s peace will soon be shattered by the invading armies of Moon Knight.

Marvel posted a trailer for Ultimate Black Panther #1 to YouTube. The book will be written by Bryan Hill and drawn by Stefano Caselli. The trailer begins with Moon Knight’s forces entering Wakanda, only to be greeted by Killmonger, who is wielding an electric ax. Killmonger hurls it at Moon Knight’s forces, and it brutally takes them out. Fans then get to see the new Black Panther in action, as well as meet some of his supporting cast.


 




The trailer does not say why Moon Knight has targeted Wakanda, but it does end on an ominous note, as the Maker lurks in the background.


 Marvel is Creating a New Black Panther for a New World 
          

The Maker has been crucial to the birth of this new Ultimate Universe. After escaping his prison on Earth-616, he made his way to a new Earth. The Maker would come to rule this Earth, alongside a council made up of ruling families. The Maker’s plans were opposed by Howard Stark, who imprisoned him within his lair. For a brief moment, the world is free–at least until the Maker inevitably gets loose again. In the meantime, a new world of heroes will emerge, including new takes on Spider-Man, the X-Men and Black Panther.

While giving fans their first good look at Ultimate Black Panther, the trailer does raise questions. The first and most obvious is why Moon Knight has set his sights on T’Challa and his kingdom. Beyond that, fans are left to wonder what kind of person Moon Knight is in this new Ultimate Universe. The Moon Knight of Earth-616 is a brutal vigilante, but has never shown a desire for conquest, nor has he had any argument with the Black Panther. In creating the new Ultimate Universe, the Maker has warped Moon Knight into something terrible, and now Wakanda and the Black Panther are going to pay the price.




                  Black Panther Introduces Killmonger&#39;s Evil Opposite In Shocking Twist   Black Panther finally brings a new kind of Killmonger to the Marvel Universe - one who is even more ruthless (and he&#39;s already started a war).   



 Fans Need to Keep an Eye on Ultimate Killmonger 
          

In addition to introducing the Ultimate incarnation of Shuri, fans get to see Ultimate Killmonger in action, including his awesome new weapon, an electric ax. Killmonger makes the most of this weapon as well, using it to dispense of Moon Knight’s soldiers. Killmonger and his ax are but one of the trailers&#39; many highlights, and Ultimate Black Panther #1 promises more as T’Challa heads into battle with Moon Knight.
