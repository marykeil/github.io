## Literature Review

Nightwing has learned a lot from Batman over the years and it&#39;s made him an extremely competent hero, but he learned one major skill from Alfred.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Nightwing #109!




Nightwing is one of the most beloved and skilled heroes in the DC Universe and a large chunk of this has come from the intense training he went under from his mentor Batman. From Batman, Dick learned how to solve mysteries, how to fight, and basic engineering and computer science. But one major skill that might just save one of Dick&#39;s friends wasn&#39;t learned from Batman, but from Alfred.

Currently, Nightwing has been on a pirate adventure with Bea Bennett, a former love interest of his who was revealed to be the pirate queen, Captain Blud. Some people contest Bea&#39;s claim to the title of Captain Blud, and she is brutally stabbed through the stomach by her own brother, before being tossed into the waters below.



          

In the opening pages of Nightwing #109 by Tom Taylor and Stephen Byrne, Dick stands on the edge of jumping in after her when he has a flashback to his days of training with Batman. But it&#39;s not Batman&#39;s advice or training that is going to get him through this. Instead, Nightwing remembers one specific lesson given by Alfred Pennyworth, which may just be the key to saving Bea&#39;s life.




                  Nightwing&#39;s New Love Triangle Was Just Resolved in the Darkest Way Possible   Nightwing has found himself in a love triangle, but before he has to sort his feelings out, things are resolved in the darkest way possible.   


 Nightwing Dives In To Save Bea 
         

It&#39;s widely agreed that the Bat-Family are some of the best-trained vigilantes in the DC Universe purely because of how absurdly difficult and demanding Batman&#39;s training actually is. Batman&#39;s training turned Nightwing into the world-class hero that he is, but Batman isn&#39;t a master of everything. There are various skills that Batman simply does not possess and would not be able to teach Dick. This is where Alfred Pennyworth comes in. The issue depicts one day when Dick comes down for his training, only it isn&#39;t Bruce waiting for him, but Alfred. This lesson could be the exact one Dick needs right now.




Part of Alfred Pennyworth&#39;s backstory is that he was a trained medic in the Royal British Army. Alfred has a ton of medical experience and is often the one who patches Batman up when he wanders in from a night of fighting crime, having been stabbed or shot or worse. While Alfred&#39;s medical abilities don&#39;t surpass those of an actual doctor or trained surgeon, he&#39;s still well above anything Batman can do on his own. Alfred is more than capable of stitching up stab wounds and resetting broken bones, which is very likely what Alfred teaches Dick in this flashback. The cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas of a pig are remarkably similar to those of humans.



 Alfred Pennyworth Has The Skills That Batman Lacks 
          

Bea Bennett has just been stabbed through the stomach and dropped from a great height. It&#39;s not heroics that&#39;s going to save her life, but quick and decisive medical knowledge. It&#39;s extremely likely that down in the Batcave, Alfred taught Dick exactly how the human body works and how things in it can be repaired after they&#39;ve broken down. This means that it&#39;s not going to be Batman&#39;s skills and training that save Bea Bennett&#39;s life, it&#39;s going to be Nightwing&#39;s training that he received from Alfred Pennyworth that is going to make all the difference.






Nightwing #109 is on sale from DC Comics on December 19th!
