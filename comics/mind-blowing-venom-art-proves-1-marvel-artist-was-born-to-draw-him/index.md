## Literature Review

A forthcoming &#34;Nightmare&#34; variant for Venom #28 proves that superstar artist Peach Momoko was born to draw him.




A new piece of mind-blowing Venom art proves that one superstar Marvel artist was born to draw him. For 35 years, Venom has been one of Marvel’s most popular characters, having gone from a vicious Spider-Man villain to one of the publisher’s premiere anti-heroes. There is a definite body horror aspect to Venom, and a “Nightmare” variant cover for Venom #28 by Peach Momoko taps into this, proving she is a natural fit for Venom.




Peach Momoko unveiled the cover for Venom #28 on her Instagram. The book, which will be written by Torunn Gronbekk and drawn by Julius Ohta, will ship with several variant covers, including the aforementioned Momoko cover. Done in Momoko’s distinct style, the cover shows Venom in mid-transformation, and leans into the character’s body horror dimensions. Facing down, his mouth is wide open, flashing his long, sharp teeth. Venom’s tongue hangs out, and he looks ready to pounce, almost like he is ready to eat someone’s brain.


 

Momoko draws a truly impressive Venom.


 Peach Momoko Is One of Marvel&#39;s Best Artists 
          




Peach Momoko is one of the top artists working today. Her style is unforgettable, and graced not only numerous covers for Marvel, but also interiors in the series of Demon Days books. These titles, set in feudal Japan, gave fans a unique vision of some of Marvel’s biggest icons, such as Wolverine. Momoko’s star has only increased, and she is set to write and draw the forthcoming Ultimate X-Men title, as part of the relaunch of the Ultimate imprint. To celebrate, Marvel commissioned Peach Momoko to draw a series of “Nightmare” variants of some of their biggest characters. These covers will feature icons such as Monica Rambeau, transformed into nightmarish creatures.

And now Peach Momoko has worked her magic on Venom, creating a bold look for Eddie Brock. Venom is a disgusting character: he drools regularly, eats brains and wears a slimy, oozy symbiote. Momoko captures Venom’s gross essence perfectly, but manages to make it one of the most compelling covers of the entire Nightmare line. Momoko not only nails Venom’s nastiness, but also shows hints of the pain and sorrow that drive him. Despite his disgusting habits, Venom is one of Marvel’s most complex characters, and Momoko nails it.

 Peach Momoko Needs to Draw Venom...Badly 
          

The Nightmare variant of Venom #28 makes one thing abundantly clear: Peach Momoko was meant to draw the character. Momoko’s style lends itself well to horror, something Venom excels in. While Ultimate X-Men will keep Momoko busy for the foreseeable future, there is always hope she could draw another Venom cover, or even better, do interiors for at least one issue. Peach Momoko and Venom are a match made in heaven, and Marvel should seize on this opportunity.
