## Literature Review

From the time-jumping X-Men to the brainy nemeses Reed Richards and Victor Von Doom, these characters know their way around time travel.




Marvel Comics have never been afraid to embrace science fiction topics like time travel in its publications. Series like The Fantastic Four are a huge testament to Marvel creators&#39; use and love of science fiction in their storylines and characters. Consequently, it seems fitting that Marvel has made perfect use of the concept of time travel, which has taken center stage in several key storylines.
As a result, some characters are well versed with time travel, knowing the ins and outs of it as well as the science needed for it to happen. From the time jumping X-Men members like Cable and Bishop to the villains Doctor Doom and Kang the Conqueror, the Marvel characters who regularly travel through time are varied and exclusive.









 








 10  Cosmic Ghost Rider 
Debuted in 2017
        

A future version of Frank Castle imbued with the Ghost Rider&#39;s Spirit of Vengeance, the lethal combination of the Cosmic Ghost Rider is made even more powerful thanks to being bestowed with the Power Cosmic by Galactus. As a result, he has total control over the elements, energy, and time. His Hell Cycle has the ability to travel through space and time, or stop time altogether. In addition, the Cosmic Ghost Rider has also been seen to wield the Time Stone, granting him ultimate power over all things temporally related.





 9  Kitty Pryde 
Debuted in 1979


 







A major figure in the iconic Days of Future Past storyline, Kitty Pryde does not possess time traveling powers of her own. However, her journey to the past is essential in preventing the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly and keeping the Sentinels from taking over the world. She is able to send her consciousness back in time and successfully stop the Sentinels&#39; destruction of mutants with help from fellow X-Man Rachel Summers&#39; psionic powers. Consequently, Kitty&#39;s time traveling saves both mutants and humans from a dark fate.





 8  Bishop 
Debuted in 1991
        

Lcuas Bishop came from the future after following the criminal Fitzroy into an intertemporal portal, stranding him in the present. Fighting alongside the modern-day X-Men, Bishop has had many time-related storylines. For instance, Bishop was one of the major forces who tried to stop Professor Xavier&#39;s son Legion from killing Magneto and altering history. Moreover, one of the most important plots that Bishop was involved in was the Onslaught saga, which saw Bishop warning the X-Men about the future and their own lives being at risk. Had it not been for his time travel escapades, Bishop may never have been the important part of the X-Men team that he became.





 7  Ravonna Renslayer 
Debuted in 1963
        

Fans of the Disney&#43; series Loki are very familiar with Ravonna Renslayer, who is a major character in the series. In the comics, Renslayer plays a similar role as well. The great love of Kang the Conqueror, Ravonna shared her romantic partner&#39;s talents and knowledge of time travel. Further, she has time traveling devices of her own that allow her to weave in and out through the landscape of time and space. While the comics and MCU versions of the character may differ greatly (for one, the comics version is a princess), both are highly adept at time travel.





 6  Reed Richards 
Debuted in 1961


 







A genius by all accounts, Reed Richards is capable of almost anything when it comes to science, time travel included. He can even use technology to rewrite future events, such as when he recently concocted his own time creation to combat the Metamind app. Additionally, Mister Fantastic has a history of making time machines, including the infamous Time Sled. The vehicle has played a role in many Fantastic Four stories, such as when they used the Rosebud II model to travel to the future to destroy the Time Bubble. There was also the Rosebud III Time Sled model, which the Fantastic Four used to travel to Chronopolis to help the Avengers, Dr. Druid, and the Temptress combat Kang.





 5  Meridius 
Debuted in 2021
        

A future version of Eddie Brock after the former Venom host assumed the role of King in Black, Meridius created his own time loop to ensure his existence even after Eddie&#39;s physical body died. Gifted the ability to manipulate the symbiote Hive Mind, he is able to travel through the timeline and gather multiple versions of himself simultaneously. If one thinks that sounds complicated, he will certainly not be alone. Regardless of the complexity of how Meridius exists, what is easy to say is that he has a deep understanding and knowledge of all things time, including time travel. While Meridius is powerful on his own, he has several iterations of himself that he has encountered in the time loop, which include the personas Finnegan, Bedlam, Wilde, Tyro, and his final form, the Eventuality.





 4  The Maker 
Debuted in 2004
        

The villainous version of Reed Richards from the Ultimate Universe, the Maker has the intellect of his Earth-616 counterpart while being more powerful. As the Maker, Richards travels to the Sacred Timeline to restart the world he previously left behind. Given his knowledge of the future, he destroys the ancestors of those heroes whom he knows will be a threat to him. Further, since he is not native to the timeline he is wreaking havoc in, he does not have to worry about any time travel attacks on his own past selves because he doesn&#39;t have past selves on the timeline to begin with. As a result, his ability to manipulate the timeline without consequences to himself makes him a villain without many vulnerabilities while still being extremely powerful.





 3  Cable 
Debuted in 1985
        

Cable&#39;s entire complicated personal history has been defined by his many adventures through time. He started off as Nathan Summers, the son of Scott Summers aka Cyclops. He was born in the present day, but when he became infected by a techno-organic virus, he was sent thousands of years into the future in order to be receive a cure. This was the beginning of his long history of time traveling. He eventually returned to the present day as a much older man in order to stop the villain Apocalypose from achieving world domination. Thanks to help from Shi&#39;ar technology, he is able to send his consciousness into the past. Likewise, he would go from the &#39;90s to the future thanks to the Professor, a computer in his ship the Graymalkin. Moreover, being the son of Cyclops, it should come as no surprise that Cable has played a big role in various iterations of the X-Men.





 2  Doctor Doom 
Debuted in 1962


 







A monarch, sorcerer, scientist, and supervillain, Doctor Doom is one of the most brilliant and lethal antagonists in the Marvel Universe. Therefore, it is not all that surprising that Doctor Doom&#39;s capabilities and expertise extend to time travel. Much like his peer and rival Reed Richards, Victor von Doom is well-versed in the intricacies of time travel, and has used that knowledge to create his Time Platform. Like all supervillains, he aimed to use the Time Platform for his own selfish and nefarious purposes. For instance, he stole Blackbeard&#39;s treasure from the 18th century, and even traveled to 1211 to get an exclusive education in the mystical arts from Morgan le Fay herself.





 1  Kang The Conqueror 
Debuted in 1964
        

With a backstory as complicated as time travel itself, Kang the Conqueror was born in the peaceful 30th century before growing bored with the lack of chaos, leading him to travel back to Ancient Egypt. His time traveling did not end with his origins, however, and he&#39;s played a major part in Marvel Comics history due to his traversing back and forth through time to establish power rather than peace. His temporal jumping has also resulted in him taking on different forms. For instance, the future Kang traveled back in time to his younger self to persuade him to take a heroic path, leading him to become the benevolent Iron Lad for a time. He&#39;s even gone to war with versions of himself from different points on the timeline.
But Kang&#39;s time travel is not limited to just interacting with his past and future selves. Rather, he aims to use his gifts to conquer the universe through different time-traveling devices from advanced futures and civilizations. This has put him into conflict with nearly every hero in Marvel Comics and cemented his status as the most powerful wielder of time travel in the universe.
