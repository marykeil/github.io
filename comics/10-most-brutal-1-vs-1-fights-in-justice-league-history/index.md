# 10 Most Brutal 1 vs 1 Fights in Justice League History


## SUMMARY 



  Superheroes don&#39;t make names for themselves by fighting off faceless goons all the time. Rather, their most iconic moments come from memorable one-on-one fights, both against major villains, and at times, other heroes.   The Justice League&#39;s members prove time and time again why they are the premiere superheroes in the DC Universe by displaying their power in epic fight scenes.   With DC&#39;s endless Multiverse, there are always opportunities for Justice League teammates to find themselves in brutal physical confrontations with one another, as several entries on this list depict.

## Literature Review

DC&#39;s premiere superheroes, the members of the Justice League, are no strangers to brutal 1-vs-1 fights; here are ten absolutely intense examples.




One of the many demands of being a member of the Justice League calls for being up for a fight at a moment&#39;s notice. A true Justice Leaguer must be ready for any and anything at all times, whether that means having a multiversal battle in the skies or a fight to the death with the latest monster of the week.




Sometimes, a Justice Leaguer will have to be ready for a one-on-one fight at a moment&#39;s notice and sometimes, that fight can get real ugly real fast. Such one-on-one fights can get ugly in a hurry, and when they get ugly, they tend to get gory. It doesn&#39;t matter if that one-on-one fight happens to be against a villain or sometimes another hero. Some members of the Justice League have experienced some of the most violent fights that any hero could ask for in their superhero career. Below are 10 of the most brutal 1-vs-1 fights in Justice League history.


 Wonder Woman vs. Superman 
Wonder Woman: Dead Earth #3
         

In a post-apocalyptic DC Universe, ravaged by a war started by humanity, the US government made the decision to nuke Themyscira. Superman was on the side of humanity, but was shocked at the government&#39;s actions. He apologized to Diana, but when a missile hit the island and wiped out the Amazons, she was in no mood to talk. This forced a fight between the two, where Diana attacks Clark with unrelenting blind rage. The two came to bloody blows, with the fight culminating at the Fortress of Solitude, where Wonder Woman pounded into Superman with fists full of Kryptonite. She landed the killing blow by punching a hole through Superman&#39;s chest.






2020&#39;s Wonder Woman: Dead Earth #3 was written and drawn by Daniel Warren Johnson.






 Reverse Flash vs. Batman 
Batman #21
         

Kicking off the Watchmen crossover known as &#34;The Button&#34; with style, Bruce Wayne was in the Bat Cave, when he received a brief vision of his father, Thomas Wayne, the Batman from the Flashpoint timeline. Just then, a resurrected Reverse Flash appeared, called upon by the Button, and mistook Bruce for the Batman who killed him, Thomas. After introducing himself, Eobard Thawne started to beat Bruce within an inch of his life, until Bruce could defend himself, piercing a Batarang through Reverse Flash&#39;s foot. Bruce&#39;s fast thinking allowed him to take advantage of Eobard&#39;s momentary gloating. Still, Eobard got what he wanted, the Button, though it was more than he bargained for, when it burned half his body away.






Batman #21 was written by Tom King, with artwork by Jason Fabok. It was published in 2017.






 Shazam vs. Superman 
Kingdom Come #4
          

In the alternate future of Kingdom Come, where Superman is retired and an adult Billy Batson is under Lex Luthor&#39;s mind control, Shazam and the Man of Steel came into conflict when Luthor made Billy break prisoners out of the Gulag prison. While the Justice League dealt with the prisoners, Billy and Clark faced each other one-on-one. Superman started to get the advantage, blasting his laser vision directly into the then-Captain Marvel&#39;s face, but things took a brutal turn when Billy starts shouting &#34;Shazam!&#34; over and over again in Supes&#39; direction. The magic lightning proved too much for Superman, as he starts bleeding from his eyes, mouth, and ears.






Kingdom Come #4 was written by Mark Waid, with art by Alex Ross. It was released in 1996.






 Batman vs. The Joker 
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #3
          

In the world of The Dark Knight Returns, a 50-something-year-old Joker spent 10 years in a catatonic state at Arkham Asylum, until he got wind that Batman pulled himself out of retirement. The two forever fighters make up for lost time in the series&#39; third issue in a county fair brawl that concludes, fittingly for two enemies practically in love with each other, within the Tunnel of Love. As violent as their skirmish gets, Batman still, even in old age, can&#39;t bring himself to kill The Joker. Joker, though, with a Batarang in his eye, finishes the job for ole Bats by snapping his own neck.






Published in 1986, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #3 features story and art from Frank Miller.






 Batman vs. Superman 
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns #4
         

The Dark Knight Returns earned its reputation as potentially the best Batman story by featuring not just one, but multiple candidates for his most brutal fight. As if his lover&#39;s quarrel with the Joker wasn&#39;t intense enough, the series followed that up in its next and final issue with a duel between the World&#39;s Finest. The brutality of the fight truly reached its crescendo as Clark started telling Bruce each vital organ he&#39;s decimating, as he was injuring them. In the end, a last-minute assist from the Green Arrow allowed Batman to pound away at Superman to win it all. In his own words, &#34;I want you ... to remember, Clark ...the one man who beat you.&#34;






1986&#39;s The Dark Knight Returns #4 was written and drawn by Frank Miller.






 Black Adam vs. Hawkman 
Black Adam: The Dark Age #3
          

Black Adam and Hawkman individually have each had a reputation for being DC&#39;s most brutal hero throughout the years – meaning this fight was always bound to happen one day. As expected, the two were evenly matched, as they traded one blow after another, neither initially able to gain the advantage in the conflict. Things changed once the fight took to the air, though ironically, this caused things to go south for Hawkman, rather than Black Adam. Ultimately, flight specialist Hawkman was set up for failure, as Black Adam ripped his wings off, forcing him to crash into the ground beneath.






Black Adam: The Dark Age #3 was written by Doug Mahnke, with art by Peter Tomasi. It came out in 2007.






 Wonder Woman vs. Superman 
Wonder Woman #219
          

As seen above, in an earlier entry, few allies are capable of dishing out such unruly punishment to each other quite like Superman and Wonder Woman. The sentiment was no different here, except this instance was a little more iconic in the history of DC lore. Most DC readers will remember the horrifying conclusion of Wonder Woman snapping Maxwell Lord&#39;s neck to break Superman&#39;s mind control, but one thing that can&#39;t be overlooked is just how the two Leaguers pulverized each other beforehand. From Diana giving Clark a concussion mid-fight to slicing his neck open with her tiara, Wonder Woman nearly killed Superman in this bout.






Wonder Woman #219 was written by Greg Rucka with art from Tom Derenick, Georges Jeanty, Karl Kerschi, David Lopez, and Rags Morales. It was published in 2005.






 Superman vs. Doomsday 
Superman #75
          

No list focusing on Justice League member&#39;s most brutal fight scenes is complete without the fight that was a top news story in 1993. The Death of Superman took the world by storm, with the death itself taking place during Superman #75. No man or creature overwhelmed the Man of Steel in his entire superhero career quite like Doomsday, and few have done so ever since. Doomsday gave the entire Justice League a run for their money, before he and Superman fought throughout Metropolis. The knock-down drag-out encounter ended with both delivering simultaneous killing blows to each other, in one of the most shocking comic book moments of all time.






Released in 1993, Superman #75 was written by Dan Jurgens, with art bt Brett Breeding.






 Batman vs. The Joker 
Batman #40
          

Joker and Batman are truly destined to do the same dance forever. Not just duking it out in a battle of good and evil, but as seen above in The Dark Knight Returns, have unflinching physical battles as well. Each fight seems to get bloodier than their last and perhaps their bloodiest – besides their most recent where Batman potentially killed Joker – came during the finale of Scott Snyder&#39;s Endgame arc. It ended with both hero and villain lying in pools of their own blood, bodies mangled, and in Batman&#39;s case, blood pouring from his eyes as a Joker card is jammed in it.






Batman #40 was written by Scott Snyder with art by Greg Capullo. It was released in 2015.






 Wonder Woman vs. Medusa 
Wonder Woman #210
          

Fights like this are how Wonder Woman earned her reputation as the scariest member of the Justice League. Her most R-rated kill came not against a supervillain, or even another hero, but against the legendary Gorgon, Medusa. Much of the brutality came from Diana needing to take cringe-inducing measures to avoid Medusa&#39;s stoney gaze, such as blinding herself with snake venom. In the end, she managed to deal the final blow by cutting off Medusa&#39;s head. Countless Justice League members have endured brutal fights, but few more so than what Wonder Woman went through in this incredible, unbelieavable violent battle.






Released in 2004, Wonder Woman #210 was written by Greg Rucka, with art by Ray Snyder and Drew Johnson.
