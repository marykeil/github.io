## Literature Review

Predator vs. Wolverine #3 gives an origin to Logan&#39;s iconic &#34;I&#39;m the best there is at what I do...&#34; catchphrase for the first time in Marvel history. 




Warning: contains spoilers for Predator vs. Wolverine #3The iconic berserker hero Wolverine is known for many things, like his long and dramatic history with the X-Men, but his infamous catchphrase, &#34;I&#39;m the best there is at what I do, but what I do best isn&#39;t very nice&#34; has become synonymous with the savage mutant. Logan has lived a long life - more than a century in fact - and the recent Predator vs. Wolverine #3 comic has finally revealed that Wolverine&#39;s time training under the demonic swordsmith Muramasa is when he earned his iconic tagline.




Predator vs. Wolverine #3, from writer Gerry Duggan and artists Ken Lashley, Kei Zama, and Hayden Sherman, continues the decades-long hunt between the titular Yautja alien and Wolverine, this time with the Predator battle landing in Japan during Muramasa&#39;s training of Logan.

          

As Wolverine describes his unique relationship with the infamous swordsmith, and Muramasa&#39;s intense training regimen, Muramasa tells Logan he&#39;s a skilled fighter, &#34;But you&#39;re not the best there is,&#34; establishing that Muramasa himself might have been the one to determine when Wolverine did become the best.


 The Demon Swordsman Muramasa Inspired Logan To Be His Best 
          




It is important to mention that Marvel has not confirmed or denied whether Predator vs. Wolverine is in the main Earth-616 continuity, but it wouldn&#39;t disrupt continuity too much to make the Yautja real in the Marvel Universe. Wolverine&#39;s classic catchphrase cuts right to the core of who Logan is as a hero - brutal, vicious, but ultimately honorable - and debuted as the first thing out of Logan&#39;s mouth in 1982&#39;s Wolverine #1 from writer Chris Claremont and artist Frank Miller. Wolverine would quickly go on to explain that what he is best at is hunting and killing, something he has proven time and time again as a member of Team X, an Avengers member, and while working with the X-Men.

Even though Logan&#39;s catchphrase is synonymous with the character, the origins of Wolverine&#39;s internal compass of being &#34;the best&#34; have never been revealed. Being the best there is at hunting and killing has never been something Logan is necessarily proud of, but instead, a title he must wear and act upon with respect and honor. Logan trained for years under first Ogun and then Muramasa to become the skilled and mindful fighter he is in modern times, and Muramasa is known to be one of the universe&#39;s most skilled sword fighters, so it makes sense beating him would make Wolverine &#34;the best.&#34;






 Wolverine&#39;s Battle Against The Predator Could Earn Him Muramasa&#39;s Blessing 
          

The infamous blade Muramasa forged for Logan was created through a piece of Wolverine&#39;s rage-filled soul, and it stands to reason that the smith would not have created the wildly powerful weapon for Logan if he didn&#39;t see him as the best. While in Predator vs. Wolverine #3 Muramasa tells Logan that he is a long way from being the best, there is a chance that Muramasa will witness something in Wolverine&#39;s century-long battle with the Predator that will convince him that Logan has indeed earned that title.

Even if Muramasa is not able to acknowledge Wolverine&#39;s status, it is clear that after Logan inevitably defeats the vengeful Predator he will indeed be &#34;the best there is&#34; at hunting and killing, having killed one of the universe&#39;s most deadly predators. The X-Men hero Wolverine is the best there is at what he does, but first, he&#39;ll need to beat the wickedly fierce Predator to impress his teacher Muramasa enough to earn that precious title.
