## Literature Review

The X-Men and Ultron don&#39;t cross paths often in comics, but in a new cosplay image, both Wolverine and Cyclops give it their all to take Ultron down.




In Marvel Comics, Wolverine and Cyclops are staple members of the X-Men who have triumphed over seemingly insurmountable odds time and time again, somehow always finding ways to come out on top thanks to their signature mutant abilities and tactical prowess on the battlefield. And now, in an epic new cosplay image, Wolverine and Cyclops’ skills are put to the test in a life-or-death cosplay battle against the rogue robotic intelligence known as Ultron!




Recently shared on Instagram by both cosplayers featured in the photo — @zack_attack_cosplay as Wolverine and @supermancfl as Cyclops — this post was also uploaded by the digital artist and photographer of the piece, Ryan Sims (@ryansimsphotography).


 

Editing and photographing other members of the cosplay community to stunning results, Ryan has more recently given fans a very MCU-like live-action X-Men poster, epic photos of Batman, Aquaman, Daredevil, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and more, and even a few pieces from the worlds of Disney, anime, and video games, with each new image raising the bar for a creator that doesn’t miss.

                  Wolverine Cosplay Gives Fans A Jaw-Dropping Live-Action Design Ahead of Deadpool 3   Wolverine is finally getting the live-action look he deserves in next year&#39;s Deadpool 3, but until then, this cosplay design is the next best thing!

Technically never shown fighting Ultron on-panel in the comics, the closest the X-Men came to duking it out with this robotic villain was in 2013’s Age of Ultron event after the team is killed off-screen, leaving Wolverine to travel back in time to kill Hank Pym — the creator of Ultron — and stop this tragedy from ever happening. And while an X-Men vs. Ultron fight would be awesome to see both in comics and in the live-action space, this battle is currently exclusive to the cosplay community, making it a dream come true for fans of these characters.

A photo that places @zack_attack_cosplay’s Wolverine and @supermancfl’s Cyclops smack dab in the middle of an overwhelming assault by a group of ruthless Ultron drones, both cosplayers do their respective characters justice with homemade costumes that sell these iconic mutants&#39; live-action looks perfectly. Showing Cyclops blasting his enemies with his signature optical attack while Wolverine stands ready with unsheathed claws, Ryan builds an awe-inspiring scene around Scott and Logan as they fight for their lives, throwing in explosions, destroyed Ultrons, flying debris, and more enemies arriving every second, giving Wolverine and Cyclops a match-up they might not be able to walk away from.

As a bonus, fans can swipe through the rest of the images in the post to see a short video that shows off Ryan’s creative process in bringing this epic battle to life, as well as a few zoomed-in versions of the original photo that highlight some of the intricate details Ryan put into this already impressive piece. Only time will tell if Wolverine, Cyclops, and the rest of the X-Men will ever face off against Ultron, so until then, creative talents like Ryan Sims (@ryansimsphotography), @supermancfl, and @zack_attack_cosplay will have to keep pumping out impeccable cosplay creations like this one to tide fans over.
