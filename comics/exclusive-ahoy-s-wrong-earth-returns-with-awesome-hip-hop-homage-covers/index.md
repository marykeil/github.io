## Literature Review

Screen Rant exclusively announces the return of Wrong Earth, with the newest series - Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers from Ahoy Comics, coming in 2024. 




Screen Rant is excited to exclusively announce Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers from Ahoy Comics, as well as reveal two of the series&#39; upcoming covers. The fan-favorite series, Wrong Earth, returns with a new adventure and more humorous complications for its heroes. It will feature covers that pay homage to classic band photos in rock and hip-hop history.




Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers is an upcoming five-issue series by the creative team of Jamal Igle, Tom Peyer, Juan Castro, and Lee Loughridge. The series continues the adventures of Dragonflyman and his sidekick, Stinger, as they find themselves on a different Earth than the one they are originally from.



          

The Wrong Earth comic line has featured a few series, as well as several one-shots, following the duo as they interact with various iterations of themselves on alternate Earths. This has included their original swap with Dragonfly, a brutal vigilante from Earth-Omega, whose life will collide with his more peaceful counterparts.

 Ahoy Comics &amp; Wrong Earth Pay Homage to Music History with New Series&#39; Art 
         

Ahoy Comics is known for its campy adventures, and Wrong Earth has proven to be a particularly successful one. It prides itself on toying with superhero storytelling tropes and, thus far, has done a great job of remixing the genre in a fun way. This new series will also feature a remix of a different nature by having comic covers created by Jamal Igle with a musical theme. As seen above, the first issue&#39;s cover is an homage to Public Enemy&#39;s 1990 publicity photo. Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers #1 also features a variant cover from Felipe Sobreiro. The second issue&#39;s cover by Igle pays homage to the cover of Onyx&#39;s debut album, Bacdafucup, which was released in 1993. Check out the synopsis here:


Dragonflyman and Stinger are finally back where they belong, on campy Earth-Alpha - but Earth-Omega&#39;s gritty Dragonfly and Stinger II are now trapped there too. Will their vigilante violence infect the planet&#39;s innocent, code-approved culture? And what happens when two heroes want to share Dragonflyman&#39;s civilian identity, billionaire Richard Fame? The agonizing answers will shake Fortune City to its foundations in THE WRONG EARTH: DEAD RINGERS!







 Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers Continues Delivery of Campy Storytelling and Superhero Tropes 
          

On what fans can expect with this new addition to the Wrong Earth series, Tom Peyer says, &#34;This one&#39;s a bit different from previous installments, though we&#39;re still playing with superhero tropes through the ages. But now we get to do it with fistfights in space, secret identity crises, and the whole rich history of lame attempts by middle-aged comics creators to come off as youthful. Come for the action, stay for the cringe!&#34;

Jamal Igle reflected on the creative journey, saying, &#34;It&#39;s really amazing to me that we&#39;ve come so far with this series. When I was invited by Tom to join the series, I had no idea what to expect but we&#39;ve built a rich, complex story over the last six years. I&#39;m on for the ride as long as people want to see these guys mix it up.&#34;




Wrong Earth: Dead Ringers #1 will be available on March 13, 2024 from Ahoy Comics.
