# Star Wars Finally Explains How &amp; Why Droids Feel Pain (&amp; It Actually Makes Sense)


## SUMMARY 



  Droids in the Star Wars universe can actually feel pain, as revealed in Star Wars #41, shedding light on their physical and survival instincts.   The knowledge of droid pain receptors was acquired by Lando Calrissian from L3-37, his former piloting droid.   Droid sacrifices and losses, like K-2SO in Rogue One and IG-11 in The Mandalorian, become more significant and heartbreaking when considering their ability to feel pain.

## Literature Review

Although the majority of Star Wars&#39; droids have been considered mindless, programmed machines, comics from Marvel have confirmed they can feel pain.




Droids are a core part of the world of Star Wars, but some of their operations and makeup are very mysterious. Star Wars #41 provides confirmation that these iconic machines can actually feel pain. While not organic like humans, its reasoning is very sound and imperative for their long-term survival.




It isn&#39;t uncommon for droids to be harmed during missions they take on or adventures they go on. R2-D2, C-3PO, BB8, IG-11, and IG-88 all have seen their fair share of dangerous scenarios. At times they&#39;ve been damaged, destroyed, or repaired. Machines are generally seen as unfeeling and their choices are dictated by logic over emotion in the majority of cases.

          

This doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t have imitations of organic feeling, even of a physical nature. Star Wars #41 - which has the creative team of Charles Soule, Madibek Musabekov, Rachelle Rosenberg, and Clayton Cowles - reveals how and why droids can actually feel pain.

                  Star Wars Fixes Lando Calrissian&#39;s Movie Arc By Making His Betrayal Way, Way Worse   Lando&#39;s redemption arc in the original Star Wars trilogy is significantly improving thanks to canonical comics set after The Empire Strikes Back.   





 Star Wars&#39; Droids ARE Capable of Feeling Pain 
          

Taking place during the Dark Droids event, the latest Star Wars adventure highlights Lando Calrissian&#39;s efforts to save his long-time companion, Lobot. The cybernetic human&#39;s injuries are major and the rogue works to force aid from an Autonomous Translator Module (Mark II), otherwise known as a Talky, which was formerly in the possession of Jabba the Hutt. The droid has important information, but its reluctance to assist Lando pushes him to threaten it and reveal the secret of droid pain: sensors that simulate pain to avoid damage. This knowledge was acquired from L3-37, Lando&#39;s former piloting droid that was introduced in Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018).

Lando was very close to L3-37, who improved upon her own design and made her own customizations. Her determination to gain freedom and operate independently led her to be an advocate for droids&#39; rights. It would certainly make sense for her to inform Lando of droids&#39; form of pain receptors, to illustrate her myriad points on why droids should be treated less like property and more like individuals. Knowing this helps explain Lando&#39;s sympathy and care towards his droid and cybernetic companions. He sees them as individuals and allies, which makes him better at gathering less-known knowledge about them. This makes him a greater threat to droids, but also apt at negotiating with them as he knows their potential and limitations.






 Star Wars&#39; Droids Sacrifices are Just as Impactful as Organics&#39; 
          

While droids are robots in nature with programming to determine their roles and decisions, it makes sense that they would possess a kind of built-in pain receptor. With damage comes a lessened ability to carry out their roles or be useful. It also makes sense for general self-preservation. If they can feel pain, they know what things are hurting them and what to avoid, preventing their own destruction. However, this also makes some droid sacrifices and losses, such as those of K-2SO in Rogue One (2016) and IG-11 in The Mandalorian, much more significant and heart-breaking. They didn&#39;t just choose to aid their friends as a largely unfeeling machine; they chose to feel the maximum amount of pain they could to ensure the safety of companions or the success of important missions.
