## Literature Review

Cobra Commander has his own transforming weaponry in his new series, which the future Cobra leader uses to make a bloody mess of his enemies.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Cobra Commander #1




Transformers and G.I Joe  have never been more closely tied together than they are with Skybound’s Energon Universe line of comics, and the recently released Cobra Commander #1 ties them even further together. In the new continuity, the future leader of the Cobra terrorist organization is revealed to be using weapons derived from Transformers technology, and is on the hunt for Energon to create more.

Cobra Commander #1 – by the creative team of Joshua Williamson, Andrea Milana, Annalisa Leoni and Rus Wooten – brings the character into the Energon Universe continuity with a major revelation, establishing that the titular character hails from the underground civilization of Cobra-La. After conducting a series of experiments on an imprisoned Megatron, Cobra Commander develops a series of deadly, transforming weapons.



          




The Commander’s experiments soon become a problem for the future Cobra leader, leading to an uprising from certain segments of the secret society.


 Cobra Commander’s New Weapons Are Derived From Decepticon Leader Megatron 


          

The miniseries&#39; debut issue introduces Cobra Commander as a human scientist, who was found and accepted into the Cobra-La society of serpent people. Further, it reveals that he has been torturing and experiment on Megatron, in order to learn the Transformers’ secrets. This soon goes awry, and Cobra Commander winds up being badly scarred in a battle with Cobra-La dissidents; ultimately, he is rejuvenated with the venom of three snakes, after which he is brought before Golobulus, the ruler of Cobra-La. Due to his controversial experimentation on Megatron, the Commander is sentenced to death.

Despite being outnumbered, Cobra Commander fights off the Cobra-La guards with transforming, insectoid devices. Cobra is able to leverage his weapons&#39; impressive display, convincing Golobulus to let him live, and to endorse his search for more Energon. Cobra Commander deriving his new weaponry from Transformers tech lines up with revelations from Duke #1, which portrayed the Commander’s future ally/rival Destro using Energon to develop classic Cobra vehicles like the H.I.S.S. tank and F.A.N.G. helicopter for M.A.R.S. Industries. Assuming the two eventually come together to form Cobra, it is incredibly exciting for fans to watch the pieces being maneuvered into place.






 Transformers Tech Makes Cobra Commander Deadlier Than Ever 


          

In the issue&#39;s opening scene, Cobra Commander appears to use some variation of his transforming weaponry to murder the trucker, and it’s possible that the Commander is using something else entirely… perhaps even Megatron himself. Eagle-eyed readers have noted that Cobra Commander is carrying what looks to be Megatron’s gun mode on Andrea Milana’s cover. Fans will have to keep reading all Energon Universe titles to see how things play out. One thing is certainL the introduction of Transformers tech into G.I. Joe lore is a clever way to tie the two franchises together, a trend that will presumably continue.
