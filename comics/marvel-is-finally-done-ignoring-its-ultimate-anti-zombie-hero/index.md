Summary

  Luke Cage finally joins the zombie battle in Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3, using his unbreakable skin to fight off the undead horde.   The anthology format of Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood allows for unique and diverse stories featuring different Marvel characters and alternate universes.   Luke Cage was supposed to be the protagonist in the original Marvel Zombies run, but his appearance was changed. Now, fans can see how he would fare in a true zombie apocalypse.  







Luke Cage is known for his unbreakable skin, and Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood is finally showing how he&#39;d handle the zombie apocalypse. Many superheroes are strong, but their powers become a weapon when they inevitably are bitten by the horde. In the latest issue of the gory anthology series, writer Cheryl Lynn Eaton and artist Leandro FernÃ¡ndez throw the Hero-for-Hire into the fray in the story &#34;Surprise, Mother Strucker!&#34;

The latest Marvel Zombies series has showcased some of the top talent in comics telling short horror stories starring everyone&#39;s favorite heroes. Gail Simone, Garth Ennis, and Peach Momoko have all contributed tales about holding on to hope, trying to find a cure, or just trying to fight through endless zombie monsters. These anthologies are also leading the hype for the upcoming Disney&#43; series Marvel Zombies.



          




Now, in a preview for Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Red #3, readers are treated to a story that looks straight out of a 1970s Blaxpoitation film, one of the original inspirations for Luke Cage. He&#39;s about to bring his unbiteable, unscratchable skills to the fight against the undead.


 Black, White &amp; Blood Explores Alternate Marvel Universes 
         

Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood doesn&#39;t have to tell one overarching story like previous Marvel Zombies editions. This anthology series lets each writer and artist create their own world and focus on the few characters they want to highlight. Peach Momoko&#39;s story is set in her X-Men alternate universe, Demon Days. The Black Widow and Hawkeye tale &#34;Already Dead&#34; evokes the setting of The Walking Dead; the preview shows the duo arriving in a small town that&#39;s been calling for visitors, but holds a deadly secret. This anthology format allows the Luke Cage story to step away from current Marvel Gang War politics and jump back to a groovier time. He&#39;s in his old Power Man costume in the preview, about to open a can of whoop-ass on Rackham, a guard at Seagate Prison where Luke Cage was unjustly held.




While the previous stories in this anthology have focused on top-tier Marvel characters, Luke Cage facing the Marvel Zombies universe should have been a no-brainer. His unbreakable skin would help him defend against being infected while holding back the hordes. It&#39;s funny that it took until the third issue of a four-part series for him to make his appearance. However, as these horror stories usually don&#39;t have happy endings, his superpower may prove useless, or so effective that he&#39;s the only man left alive on the planet.

                  The Last Survivor of Marvel&#39;s Zombie Apocalypse Makes Perfect Sense   The ultimate survivalist in the middle of Marvel&#39;s zombie apocalypse is none other than Frank Castle - and no one should really be surprised.    



 Cage Was Supposed to be The Hero of the First Marvel Zombies 
          




In the original Marvel Zombies run in 2005, writer Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead) had the idea that Luke Cage should be the protagonist, because he couldn&#39;t get bitten by a zombie. However, when he saw the finished artwork in Mark Millar&#39;s Ultimate Fantastic Four, which introduced the zombie storyline, Greg Land had already drawn a zombiefied Cage. Kirkman abandoned the idea and wrote the story fans know today, but with no explanation for how the hero&#39;s unbreakable skin fell to a zombie bite. Now, Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood will finally let fans see how Luke Cage will fare in a true zombie apocalypse.
