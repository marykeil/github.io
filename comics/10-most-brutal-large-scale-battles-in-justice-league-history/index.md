## Literature Review

The Justice League is one of the most powerful teams in comic books and they&#39;ve had to fight tons of wars over the years to protect Earth.




The Justice League is one of the largest and most powerful teams in comic books. When it comes to defending the Earth, they&#39;re often the first line of defense. The Justice League has been through tons of battles over the years, but they&#39;ve also been in legitimate wars with the fate of the entire universe on the line.
There are plenty of villains in the DC Universe who want nothing more than either complete subjugation or utter annihilation of all life. This has led to the Justice League needing to bolster their roster, so they always have enough people to fight these villains off. Sometimes these villains are absurdly powerful in their own right, sometimes they come with armies. No matter the situation, the Justice League is always there to fight them and this has led to the League being involved in several full-scale wars. These are the top 10 biggest battles the League has been involved with so far.









 








 10  Prometheus vs. The Justice League 
JLA #17 (1998)


 







The first time the Justice League almost suffers a real defeat at the hands of one man takes place in the pages of JLA #17 by Grant Morrison, Arnie Jorgensen, David Meikis, Mark Pennington, Ken Lopez, and Pat Garrahy. This story sees the brand-new villain Prometheus infiltrate the Justice League and very nearly destroy them. Using his advanced equipment, Prometheus is able to systemically take down every member of the Justice League he comes across. Even Batman is outmatched and defeated. The only hurdles for Prometheus are Superman and the unexpected appearance of Catwoman. While Prometheus isn&#39;t able to win this encounter, he is one of the first to take on the entire Justice League on his own and nearly beat them.





 9  Starro The Conqueror 
The Brave and the Bold #28 (1960)

        

The first villain the Justice League ever fights in the comics is Starro. This giant alien starfish appears on Earth and begins attacking the planet, forcing Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, and the Flash to all attempt fighting it separately. When that fails, they team up to bring the beast down, as seen in The Brave and the Bold #28 by Gardner Fox, Mike Sekowsky, Bernie Sachs, Joe Giella, Murphy Anderson, and Gaspar Saladino. Other heavy hitters, like Batman and Superman, are aware of the invasion going on but are preoccupied with Superman in space and Batman fighting crime in Gotham. Starro has been a major recurring enemy ever since, and his legacy has currently led to the major DC event of Beast World plaguing the Earth right now.





 8  The Justice League vs. Darkseid 
Justice League #6 (2012)


 







One of the biggest battles the Justice League ever face is in Justice League #6 by Geoff Johns, Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Sandra Hope, Batt, Mark Irwin, Alex Sinclair, Tony Avina, Hi-Fi, and Patrick Brosseau. This comic details the first time in the New 52 canon that Darkseid invades Earth. This involves several heroes all over the planet doing their best to repel the Parademon army, but eventually, they realize they have to stand together to have any hope of beating Darkseid. This is the first time the Justice League forms to fight Darkseid. Even with the combined might of the Justice League, Darkseid still nearly wins and conquers Earth. With the knowledge that such powerful threats like Darkseid exist in the galaxy, the Justice League decide they have to stay together for when he eventually returns.





 7  The Joker&#39;s Endgame War 
Batman #35-40 (2014-15)


 







One of the smartest things the Joker ever does is take out the Justice League before launching a full-scale assault on Gotham City. The Joker manages to infect every member of the Justice League with his Joker Venom, leaving them bedridden and completely unable to function. The villain then launches an assault on Gotham City, dispersing his poison throughout the town and turning most civilians into essentially Jokerfied zombies. This forces Batman to resort to relying on his rogues&#39; gallery of villains to battle the Joker. The Bat-Family and the rogues team up to battle Joker&#39;s army of zombified civilians as Batman faces off against the Joker himself. While the Justice League isn&#39;t able to make an appearance in this war, that is entirely due to the Joker&#39;s design.
Joker&#39;s war was seen in Batman: Endgame by Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, Danny Miki, FCO Plascencia, Dezi Sienty, and Taylor Esposito. 






 6  Green Lantern Corps vs. Superman&#39;s Regime 
Injustice: Gods Among Us - Year Two (2014)

        


One of the biggest wars in DC&#39;s history takes place in the alternate universe of Injustice. When Superman takes over Earth, the Green Lanterns step in to stop him. This leads to a full-scale war between Superman&#39;s regime and the Green Lantern Corps, as seen in Injustice: Gods Among Us - Year Two by Tom Taylor, Mike S. Miller, Rex Lokus, and Wes Abbott. The Green Lanterns obviously cannot stand by while an alien takes over a planet in their jurisdiction, and Superman isn&#39;t going to submit to someone else and give up his regime after everything he&#39;s done. Because of this conflict, Superman ends up with a yellow lantern ring and massacres the entire Green Lantern Corps, including pushing Ganthet and Mogo into the sun, killing both of them.





 5  The Living vs. The Dead 
DCeased: War of the Undead Gods #6 (2023)

        


The darkest universe that DC has ever explored is without a doubt the universe of DCeased. It&#39;s in this universe that a zombie virus is accidentally unleashed and turns the majority of people into monsters. This virus is able to affect anyone, including superpowered people. This makes it remarkably dangerous, and the virus spreads instantly through either physical wounds or seeing infected screens, like from a phone. Eventually, the virus spreads out into the galaxy and infects the New Gods. This results in a cosmic army of the dead that the surviving Justice League has to fight, as seen in DCeased: War of the Undead Gods #6 by Tom Taylor, Trevor Hairsine, Andy Lanning, Rain Beredo, and Saida Temofonte.





 4  Survivors vs. Vampires 
DC vs. Vampires #6 (2022)

        


Another twisted universe that takes a different approach than DCeased is DC vs. Vampires. Instead of an immediate apocalypse, this story follows a quiet apocalypse where the Justice League is slowly turned into vampires along with everyone else and the world is lost before anyone even knows it. This eventually culminates in the last survivors of humanity launching a full-scale attack against Nightwing, the King of Vampires who orchestrates the fall of the world. Wanting to kill Nightwing once and for all, Batgirl leads a final ragtag version of the Justice League against Nightwing&#39;s kingdom in the ruins of Gotham City. This final confrontation was seen in DC vs. Vampires #6 by James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt, Francesco Mortarino, Pierluigi Casolino, and Tom Napolitano.





 3  The Atlantean Amazon War 
Flashpoint #1 (2011)

        

When Barry Allen decides to prevent his mother&#39;s murder, he ends up running back in time to change her death. Doing this sends reverberations throughout the timeline and changes just about everything. One of the major changes is Wonder Woman and Aquaman having an affair. When Mera, Aquaman&#39;s wife, finds out, she tries to kill Wonder Woman, who then kills Mera in self-defense. Heart-broken over the death of his wife, Aquaman declares war on the Amazons. This war wages across the Earth and causes the deaths of millions. It&#39;s one of the bloodiest wars the Justice League has ever been involved in because it&#39;s one that intentionally includes the death of civilians at certain points. This war was first mentioned in Flashpoint #1 by Geoff Johns, Andy Kubert, Sandra Hope, Alex Sinclair, and Nick J. Napolitano.





 2  The DC Universe vs. Imperiex 
Our Worlds At War event (2001)

        


There have been tons of cosmic villains over the years who have threatened reality, but one of the most dangerous is Imperiex-Prime. Imperiex detects imperfections in the universe and decides to destroy it and remake it anew. Because of this, he heads to Earth, which he intends to make the staging ground for his assault on the rest of the universe. Imperiex knows that if he can destroy Earth, he&#39;ll be able to destroy everything else outward from there. The threat of Imperiex is so great that heroes and villains from across the DC Universe rally together to fight him. In a bizarre twist of fate, Darkseid ends up being Metropolis&#39; greatest hero. Eventually, Imperiex is defeated, and he realizes that the imperfection he sensed in the universe is himself. The great war against Imperiex can be read in the Our World&#39;s At War event.





 1  DC&#39;s Entire Multiverse vs. The Batman Who Laughs 
Dark Nights: Death Metal #6 (2021)

        


Dark Nights: Death Metal is one of the biggest events that DC has ever published and saw every hero and villain fighting to save the Multiverse from the Batman Who Laughs. The Batman Who Laughs gains the powers of Watchmen&#39;s Dr. Manhattan and becomes seemingly unstoppable. He is fully capable of rewriting reality in his image, and he intends to destroy and remake the entire Multiverse for his twisted entertainment. This results in just about every hero and villain who&#39;s ever existed teaming up to stop the Batman Who Laughs and his army of evil doppelgängers from the Dark Multiverse.
The final war for the Multiverse can be seen in Dark Nights: Death Metal #6 by Scott Snyder, Greg Capullo, Jonathan Glapion, FCO Plascencia, and Tom Napolitano. This war isn&#39;t just for the fate of one planet, it was for the fate of all planets. Concluding with the expansion of the DC Multiverse into an Omniverse and the launch of DC&#39;s Infinite Frontier era, this is without a doubt the Justice League&#39;s greatest battle.
