# Shonen Jump s New Series Brings A Much-Needed New Approach To Sports Manga


## SUMMARY 



  Green Green Greens takes a character-driven approach instead of relying heavily on action and sports sequences.   The debut chapter focuses more on the friendship between the two protagonists rather than showcasing golf as the main focus.   The success of the character-driven approach suggests that manga creators can prioritize character development over action to create a compelling series.

## Literature Review

While golf is at the center of the new Shonen Jump series Green Green Greens, the early focus is on the characters and that&#39;s the best thing about it.




The new sports manga Green Green Greens is trying an alternate path to success – with implications that could prove revolutionary to how Shōnen Jump approaches new series debuts. In the ultra-competitive manga industry, the key for a new series to remain in Shōnen Jump&#39;s weekly publication rotation is to get popular as fast as possible. Normally, this entails heavy doses of action and mesmerizing storytelling. Shōnen Jump&#39;s target market is action-oriented manga appealing to teenage boys and young men.




Kento Terasaka&#39;s new series Green Green Greens is, on the surface, a sports story about golf. It follows high school student Haku Yaesaki who, while his friends are busy pursuing their dreams, is working his way to becoming a world-class NEET. That is until he runs into his classmate Nadeshiko Oga in the school&#39;s College &amp; Career Planning Office. Oga is the opposite of Yaesaki: smart, disciplined, and organized.

          

Yaesaki is surprised to learn that, like him, the guidance counselors are worried about Oga&#39;s lack of a plan for the future. Yaesaki&#39;s even more surprised when, later that evening, he runs into Oga and learns that after high school she&#39;s planning on trying her talents on a professional golf tour. Interested in her off-beat idea, Yaesaki starts to think that golf is the way for him as well.






NEET or Not in Education, Employment, or Training refers to the modern phenomenon of young people who don&#39;t work, aren&#39;t taking classes, or getting any sort of professional training. It&#39;s a common character trope in manga and anime.





 Green Green Greens Relies on Character-Driven Storytelling

Focus on character development so early in a Shōnen Jump manga is rare. It&#39;s even rarer for a sports manga to take this approach. As a point of reference, the first issues of the popular Shōnen Jump sports manga Kuroko&#39;s Basketball and Haikyuu!! were loaded with tense in-game action sequences or mesmerizing practice scenes. While Green Green Greens&#39; debut leaves open a number of interesting avenues that the story can develop, what is most interesting about the chapter is how little it focuses on sports in general, and golf in particular.




The last time Shōnen Jump published a sports manga where the sports were similarly downplayed in favor of the character&#39;s development was Blue Box. But, even Blue Box&#39;s debut chapter has a lot more sports action than Green Green Greens. While there is some discussion of golf, and more than a few pages of Oga and Yaesaki swinging away at the driving range – golf and sports are an afterthought to the much more interesting and attractive focus on the burgeoning friendship between the two protagonists. Amazingly, none of the action is necessary to get the reader interested in Green Green Greens, the characters do that all by themselves.



 Green Green Greens Gives Narrative Relevance To Its Action Sequences 
          

The fact that the character-driven first chapter works so well means that there is an alternative route for manga creators, as they don&#39;t always need to go for the home run in the debut. Rather than trying to impress with action and gimmickry, they can instead focus on the characters who give life to the story. Like Green Green Greens&#39; Terasaka, most creators have the artistic chops to produce awesome artistic action. It&#39;s harder to develop a deep and interesting character – the one who can carry a series – through action alone. The character focus of Green Green Greens articulates this concept and because of that, Shōnen Jump might have just found another winning series.
