## Literature Review

Spider-Punk is back, as new miniseries Arms Race confronts him with new villains and introduces a new ally in the form of a punk Black Panther.




Hobie Brown&#39;s Spider-Punk is returning to Marvel Comics, as Marvel shares a trailer for the upcoming series Spider-Punk: Arms Race. With a higher profile than ever thanks to Daniel Kaluuya&#39;s depiction in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Spider-Punk is ready to save Earth-138 alongside his fellow punk heroes.




Hobie returns in a trailer shared by Marvel Entertainment, which sees him facing off against a host of new villains. The series reunites Cody Ziglar and Justin Mason, who handled the character&#39;s 2022 solo series - fondly remembered for providing a seven-song punk playlist to go along with each issue (a feature which will returns for Arms Race.)


 

The trailer shows Spider-Punk and his Spider-Band taking on Doctor Octopus, who is working with Justin Hammer to create an army of Spider-Slayer Sentinels in a grasp for power after Spider-Punk destroyed Norman Osborn&#39;s regime. The series promises new enemies and new allies as the heroes work to help society recover from Osborn&#39;s villainy.

 Spider-Punk Faces New Villains in Arms Race 
Hobie Brown&#39;s World Introduces Bullseye, the Lizard and More
         

Spider-Punk&#39;s prior series introduced the heroes of Earth-138, including punk takes on Captain America (Captain Anarchy), Ironheart (RiotHeart), Daredevil and the Hulk, each joining together in an activist band of crime-fighters. Now, they&#39;re getting the villains they deserve, as the trailer shows them hunted by Bullseye, attacked by a gang of villains including the Lizard, Stegron, Sauron, Death Adder and Vulture, and facing off against Doctor Octopus&#39; terrifying new inventions.

The series will also debut a new version of Black Panther, who Marvel hasn&#39;t yet revealed to fans. This reinvention of the Wakandan hero comes on the heels of his redesign for the upcoming Ultimate Black Panther, in which T&#39;Challa also finds himself combating a fascistic regime (this time helmed by an evil version of Moon Knight.) It seems 2024 will be a great year to be a Black Panther fan.




Marvel&#39;s Spider-Punk comics don&#39;t just use the aesthetic of punk, but embrace the anarchic spirit of the subculture in how it characterizes its heroes and villains - even managing to predict the Trump administration&#39;s resurrection of the &#39;Make America Great Again&#39; mantra. Fans will be thrilled to see Hobie back taking on the establishment - as well as to see Earth-138 continue to expand with new heroes and villains - when Spider-Punk: Arms Race hits shelves.

Spider-Punk: Arms Race is coming February 28 from Marvel Comics.
