# 15 Avengers Who Could Beat Thor In A Fight


## SUMMARY 



  Thor can be temporarily weakened by Scarlet Witch&#39;s magic, making him vulnerable without Mjolnir&#39;s power.   The Wasp can exploit Thor&#39;s human vulnerabilities by shrinking and attacking him in his inner ear.   Captain America, if able to wield Mjolnir, could use it against Thor or rely on his tactical genius to find a weakness.

## Literature Review

When it comes to kicking ass, few do it better than Thor. But that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s unbeatable.




Among the Avengers, there are few who can match Thor&#39;s strength or powers. Not only is the Asgardian god of thunder one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe, but he is driven to prove it whenever possible. That being said, he is not invincible.




Thor has been defeated, beaten, and left to die more than most superheroes, taking on battles and enemies far beyond the abilities of his Avenger teammates. In some cases, even taking on missions and duties that cause him to fight his friends, rather than help them. If the time should come for Thor to do battle against Marvel&#39;s heroes, who would stand against him? More to the point, who can beat Thor?


 Scarlet Witch&#39;s Magic Could Strip Thor of His Hammer 
         

Thor wasn’t around during the events of Avengers Disassembled and House of M, so he missed out on Wanda losing control, and therefore he didn’t have to face her full power. If he had, it’s likely that he would have been caught in the effects of her reality warping and would have potentially fallen before realizing he was in danger.

Wanda’s hexes are no match for Thor’s raw strength or his own magic, but with enough prep time to conjure the proper spell, Wanda could make Thor temporarily unworthy of Mjolnir by manipulating his memories or history. Without Mjolnir’s power, Thor is significantly weakened, and therefore much more vulnerable. His only chance would be to use his weakness as a strength. and charge in without any thought at all.






 The Wasp is Small Enough To Pass Thor&#39;s Defenses 
         

Janet Van Dyne might not be the most powerful Avenger, but she is a founder and mainstay of the team for good reason. She’s a natural leader and has stared down Doctor Doom, Magneto, and even Ultron. Her size-shifting powers and bio-energy blasts make her an unpredictable and formidable combatant.

While she isn’t even close to being able to match Thor&#39;s legendary strength, the Asgardian still has many of the same physical characteristics as a human, and therefore many of their vulnerabilities. Van Dyne&#39;s best option is to shrink to her minimum size and enter his inner ear, while there she could unleash her most powerful blasts to give him the worst case of vertigo in history. It may not put him down permanently, but a thunder god who can’t stand, can’t fight.






 Captain America Could Be Worthy Enough To Challenge Thor 
         

Captain America may well be one of the greatest fighters in the Marvel Universe, but even years of combat experience and an unbreakable shield can’t match Thor when it comes to sheer power. Of course, they don&#39;t have to. Steve Rogers is one of the few mortals able to not only lift Mjolnir, but wield its full power, making him someone who legitimately could defeat Thor.

Assuming the reason for their battle is due to Thor being deceived, possessed, or otherwise out of his mind, Cap would be able to use Mjolnir against him. Armed with the greatest weapon in the Marvel Universe, Cap could easily best an unarmed Thor. Should Cap not be able to use Mjolnir, he still stands a chance. While he cannot match Thor in terms of power, he’s still Captain America, a man who never gives up and always seems to have a plan.






 Black Panther&#39;s Own Gods Could Erase Thor&#39;s Greatest Advantage 
         

It’s hard to think of anyone who couldn’t be beaten by Black Panther in the right circumstances. He’s got the body of Steve Rogers and the mind of Tony Stark, with the resources of a technologically advanced nation and the world’s largest private fortune behind him. Black Panther may not be able to match Thor’s mystical potential, but his connection to the Panther God may be able to level that particular playing field in the right circumstances.

With Thor’s magical abilities theoretically countered, that just leaves his sheer strength to deal with. Black Panther has a nearly unlimited supply of Vibranium at his disposal and therefore could construct energy-absorbing weapons to shield himself from Thor’s physical attacks. Theoretically, all that would be left is for Black Panther to deliver a crushing blow in order to beat Thor.






 Cannonball 
          

Cannonball generates a kinetic energy field around himself that also propels him at supersonic speed. While his “Blasting Field” is active, he is essentially invulnerable and pummels anything he hits with incredible force. In this theoretical grudge match, Cannonball has two options.

His first is to disengage. His tactical experience would tell him that when faced with a superior foe, retreat and come back with superior firepower. Assuming he has to face Thor one-on-one, Cannonball could employ the same trick he used to take on Gladiator of the Shi’Ar Empire. He would need to goad Thor into hitting him as hard as possible, absorb the force of the impact, and redirect it at Thor in one massive blow.



 Cable&#39;s Abilities Have Stood Against Greater Enemies Than Thor 
         




Most of Cable’s stories focus on his combat prowess and impressive firepower. When he’s not hindered by the techno-organic virus Apocalypse infected him with as a baby, he’s one of the most powerful beings in existence. Cable’s telepathy is apparently able to pick up a stray thought a world away.

He once fought Silver Surfer while simultaneously levitating an island and telepathically communicating with hundreds of people. Even without his full powers, he once beat Iron Man, Captain America, Falcon, and Red Hulk while at death’s door, just by using superior tactics. Cable’s superior intelligence and tactical skill mean that he would likely be able to source a mystical weapon, such as the fang of the Midgard serpent, and weaponize it, making him someone who can beat Thor.



 Wonder Man&#39;s Immortality Could Defeat Thor... Eventually 


          




Simon Williams is one of the physically strongest Avengers, though not quite at the level of Thor. He also doesn’t have Thor’s magical abilities. He doesn’t even have Captain America or Cable’s tactical genius. So at first glance, it may seem like this would be a very one-sided fight. But, as with all things comic book related, it comes down to the writer and the circumstances.

In theory, Wonder Man is immortal. Ever since his resurrection at the hands of the Scarlet Witch, his strength has been said to be equal to that of the Sentry and he choked the Red Hulk out with little effort. While Thor is also immortal, he isn’t a true immortal. All Wonder Man has to do is engage Thor until he eventually weakens through exhaustion. It could take a few decades for that to happen, though.



 Sersi The Eternal is The Exact Same Threat as Loki (Only Stronger) 
         




Sersi is an Eternal, a true immortal with incredible transmutation powers. She never tires and has immense psionic powers, so a battle with Thor would be fought on a knife-edge. While Sersi’s physical powers would give Thor a great deal of trouble, it’s more than likely she would employ the tried and tested “cast an illusion” technique to defeat him.

It’s worked for Loki so often that it’s probably the most effective strategy and one that would involve the least risk to herself. Should Sersi be unable to trick Thor with her transmutation powers, she may be able to use them on him directly. In the Trojan war, she turned a shipload of sailors into pigs merely for bothering her. She may be able to use her powers on Thor and turn him into a mortal man. If she was able to do this, it would be for Sersi to be someone who can beat Thor.



 Doctor Strange Can Create a Fight Only He Can Win 
         




On a number of occasions, Doctor Strange’s magic has proven to be compatible with Thor’s and he was even able to cast a spell that repaired Mjolnir when it was shattered and its own magics were broken. A battle between Thor and Strange would have to be fought on the astral plane. Strange can conjure any illusion there and even deprive Thor of his powers, making the fight immense, but brief.

If the fight were to take place in the real world, Strange still has the ability to conjure physical powers and could use the Crimson Bands of Cytorrak to bind Thor and potentially hold him in place long enough to deal with him by using a more permanent spell. His best chance for Strange to be someone who can beat Thor is to somehow separate him from Mjolnir. If he could put Mjolnir in a pocket dimension, he could potentially beat Thor by simply banishing him to another realm from which there was little hope of escape.



 The God of War Couldn&#39;t Resist a Fight With Thor 


          






The Greek God of War has been an enemy of the Avengers, aiding Hades against the forces of good. But when he left Olympus and began to live an ordinary life as a construction worker on Earth, he was called up for Avengers duty with the promise that they could top his salary. While Ares admires and respects Thor, he is also keen to fight the greatest battles there are, often seeking a challenge.

Ares’ mind often works to find the best possible strategy, due to his status as the God of War and several millennia of experience. In a battle with Thor, he would work quickly to find a weakness and exploit it. Ares is one of the few heroes who possess the raw power to do so without resorting to trickery.



 Captain Marvel 
         

Captain Marvel is one of Marvel’s most valuable assets. Ever since she began to gain prominence, Captain Marvel&#39;s power levels have been greater too. Even without her cosmic-level “Binary” powers, she is fast, strong, and able to fly as well to absorb and re-direct energy. That last ability would be her key to defeating Thor.




While Thor can generate and blast huge amounts of power via his hammer, he can still be harmed by energy weapons. As Captain Marvel has no limit to the amount of energy she can harness, her best chance is to get Thor to use as much power as possible and wait until she has enough energy to unleash a devastating single blast that would cripple him, making her an easy candidate as someone who can beat Thor.



 Hercules Would Give Thor a Perfectly-Matched Brawl 
         

While Hercules and Thor have fought in the past, the two are generally very good friends and would be unlikely to fight each other. But, if they did, they are equal in terms of pure strength. Each has a near-unbreakable weapon, and each has a degree of magical ability. In theory, it could be a stalemate.

Without the ability to trick Thor or to use some kind of tactical advantage, it comes down to a full-on brawl. Hercules v Thor might not have the same impact as Batman v Superman or Captain America v Iron Man, but pitching brother against brother carries a massive emotional resonance and a battle of pure strength between these two would be epic.






 Sentry Let Thor Win in Their Greatest Fight 
         

The first time Thor fought the Sentry, it ended with Thor victorious and the Sentry dead. But truthfully, it was only because the Sentry deliberately lowered his guard and begged Thor to kill him before he hurt any more people due to the influence of The Void.

In truth, the Sentry at full power could have probably beaten Thor, as he tore Ares in half with little effort and matched The Hulk blow for blow. The Sentry has been shown to have the same power as Molecule Man and could potentially beat Thor by merely dispersing Thor’s molecules. He may not even have to raise a hand to be someone who can beat Thor.



 &#39;Marvel&#39;s Superman&#39; Hyperion Could Possess Enough Power To Beat Thor 
         




Hyperion is Marvel’s answer to Superman. Technically a mortal, Hyperion stands equal to most gods in terms of raw power. His strength is incalculable; his nuclear energy beams are capable of atomizing almost any foe. When it comes to sheer power, he can stand shoulder to shoulder with beings such as Thor and the Sentry.

Thor and Hyperion have found themselves kindred spirits, as each understands what it is to possess the power of a god but to stand among ordinary men. Hyperion’s only vulnerability is that he weakens considerably when he is unable to absorb light. In a classic too-close-to-call battle, these two are evenly matched in many ways. It’s only that Hyperion may be more willing to kill his foe that could possibly give him the edge over his friend and ally.



 Thor Has Admitted Hulk is The One Person He Can&#39;t Defeat 
          




“Hulk is the strongest one there is” is an often-quoted line and one that has been proven accurate many times. While the scourge of the universe, Thanos, will take on just about anyone and win, in the comics, he’s stated outright that The Hulk is the one person he actively avoids. Given that Thor has rarely triumphed when battling the Hulk, it’s easy to see why the Thunder God would most likely lose this particular fight.

If Thor was in possession of the Odinforce, things may be a little different, as his near omnipotence in this form may finally give the Hulk a physically superior foe. Who can beat Thor? In his normal form, with his classic power levels, Thor has openly stated that the Hulk is one foe he can’t beat. His only option is to use his full strength to hit the Hulk so far away that the conflict can be abandoned.
