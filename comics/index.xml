      <description>SUMMARYBlade&amp;rsquo;s cool and stoic personality is not as admired by other characters, such as Doctor Strange, as readers may think. Doctor Strange confronts Blade about his lack of level-headedness and cool demeanor, causing further strain on their friendship. Marvel is breaking down the stoic archetype by showing how characters like Doctor Strange find it insufferable to be around someone like Blade.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile Blade may have a reputation as a cool-headed badass, Doctor Strange disagrees, calling out the vampire hunter&amp;rsquo;s notoriously &amp;ldquo;stoic&amp;rdquo; personality.</description>

Superman&amp;rsquo;s loving upbringing and lack of significant trauma make him more willing to kill dangerous criminals like the Joker, which clashes with Batman&amp;rsquo;s no-killing rule. The conflict over the Joker&amp;rsquo;s arrest and Superman&amp;rsquo;s willingness to kill him strains the relationship between Batman and Superman, leading to Batman&amp;rsquo;s stockpiling of anti-Kryptonian measures for protection.</description>

The early 2000s lingo used in Ultimate Spider-Man, like &amp;ldquo;wigged out&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;busted,&amp;rdquo; helped modernize the story but doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold up well today - and those were just some of the ways the Ultimate Universe brought Spider-Man into the new millennium.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBlack Clover challenges the typical &amp;ldquo;feel good&amp;rdquo; message of shonen by exploring a darker worldview where class systems determine success. The symbolic magical system in Black Clover adds depth to the story and reinforces its dreary perspective on power and hierarchy. The series effectively uses foreshadowing and subverted mysteries to create compelling storylines and develop its characters, like Asta.&#xA;Literature ReviewBlack Clover flies under the radar in the anime and manga community, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the most important of today&amp;rsquo;s shonen.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBlack Clover chapter #369 reveals that Luck and Magna have already used up half of Asta&amp;rsquo;s Anti-Magic. Fans are now left wondering if they will lose their magical powers once the Anti-Magic wears off. Contrary to initial expectations, Asta&amp;rsquo;s transfer of Anti-Magic to the Black Bulls doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically destroy their own magic. This is because Asta used the reverse Demon-Dweller Sword ability, which absorbs and wields other forms of magic without destroying them.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe ending of Bleach was rushed due to Tite Kubo&amp;rsquo;s poor mental and physical health, not because of poor sales or pressure from the publisher. Kubo suffered from a partially torn tendon in his left shoulder and requested the manga to end within one or two years due to his deteriorating health. The Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War anime, with Kubo&amp;rsquo;s involvement, offers a chance to fix the disappointing ending and provide fans with the conclusion they deserve.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe first volume of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has given a full overview of Eida&amp;rsquo;s Omnipotence. The idea that Omnipotence could be used to manifest anything the user imagines has the potential to make it even more overpowered than it already is. The description of Omnipotence hints at another Otsutsuki being involved in the story, but that&amp;rsquo;s highly dependent on how things are translated.&#xA;Literature ReviewBoruto: Two Blue Vortex has finally offered a full explanation of Eida&amp;rsquo;s Omnipotence, and with that comes the tease of another big mystery.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYEida&amp;rsquo;s power of Omnipotence allows her to control the memories and feelings of others, but smart characters like Shikamaru and Amado can still discern the truth. Eida&amp;rsquo;s overpowered abilities have been a concern, but the latest chapter reveals that her power is not unbeatable. The limitation of Eida&amp;rsquo;s power adds narrative tension to the story and allows for more interesting side stories and subplots to develop.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile the power of Eida in Boruto has proven to be the definition of &amp;ldquo;broken&amp;rdquo;, recent revelations suggest she’s far from being unstoppable.</description>

The fan theory suggests that Eida&amp;rsquo;s suppressed desire for true friends is the reason behind Sarada and Sumire&amp;rsquo;s immunity to her charm powers. Eida&amp;rsquo;s immaturity and lack of control over her abilities are pointed out as factors that contribute to the theory&amp;rsquo;s plausibility.&#xA;Literature ReviewA new Boruto fan theory suggests that Eida&amp;rsquo;s loneliness and lack of companionship made her secretly sabotage her own power.</description>

Code&amp;rsquo;s abilities have been underestimated, and he is likely to continue playing a major role in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile it&amp;rsquo;s commonly believed that Code is nothing more than a “filler villain”, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex shows he is still a threat to deal with.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHimawari&amp;rsquo;s immunity to Kawaki&amp;rsquo;s alternate reality may be due to her strong ties to her true brother Boruto and her still-unexplained secret power, as explored in the anime. However, the reason could also be that Himawari&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Kawaki is deeper and more complex than expected, as they bond over shared experiences and develop a strong emotional attachment, but this is only shown in the anime. The Boruto anime provides important details and nuance to the characters and their relationships, filling in gaps that the manga cannot always explore.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Boruto time skip missed the opportunity to give Hinata, an underrated female character from Naruto, a bigger role in the story. Hinata is more than just Naruto&amp;rsquo;s wife and Boruto&amp;rsquo;s mother, she is the heir to a powerful shinobi clan and became a strong kunoichi through her own efforts. Hinata&amp;rsquo;s absence from the main storyline is a shame considering her background and connections, and her presence during the time skip could have added depth to the story and allowed her character to reach her full potential.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYCarnage proved himself worse than the Joker by driving a therapist violently insane, leaving no hope of recovery, ultimately leading to the man&amp;rsquo;s death.

Unlike Harley, Dr. Kurtz didn&amp;rsquo;t stand a chance at redemption or recovery. This demonstrates that Carnage&amp;rsquo;s treatment of therapists is far worse than Joker&amp;rsquo;s, who consideres them more like toys to be played with.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDoctor Strange explains the true meaning of his codename, which allows him to defeat stronger sorcerers like General Strange. General Strange is a formidable foe, but he has forgotten the qualities of a doctor, such as empathy and compassion, that Doctor Strange possesses.

      <description>SUMMARYDoctor Strange can be easily defeated by simply preventing him from speaking, as demonstrated in Thanos #2. Thanos effectively neutralizes Doctor Strange by strangling him with his own cape, taking advantage of the sorcerer&amp;rsquo;s inability to cast spells without speaking. This new weakness adds to Doctor Strange&amp;rsquo;s growing list of vulnerabilities, making it easier for his enemies to defeat him.&#xA;Literature ReviewDoctor Strange has a select few weaknesses, most of which aren&amp;rsquo;t easy to exploit.</description>

The differences between some of these transformations are subtle, and many are only used by one or two characters.

Dragon Ball Super deviated from the narrative trajectory of DBZ, exploring new transformations and introducing a multiverse concept.

      <description>SUMMARYSuper Saiyan 3 is rarely seen because it drains a Saiyan&amp;rsquo;s ki significantly faster than other transformations, making it unsuitable for fights that require stamina. Super Saiyan 3 is a transformation meant for the Other World, or places where time doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow, as it uses up too much energy too quickly in the mortal realm. Examples from Dragon Ball Super and Fusion Reborn support the idea that Super Saiyan 3 should only be used in locations outside the flow of time, further emphasizing its rarity in the series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRek-Rap, the demon sidekick of Spider-Man, receives more praise and glory for his minimal work than Peter Parker ever has for his major heroic efforts. Despite Peter Parker doing the difficult hero work and saving the day, it is Rek-Rap who is granted a parade in Limbo, even though he was on the sidelines for the majority of the battle, which Peter handled.

The X-Men are seeking out allies in their fight against Orchis, leading them to send emissaries to Latveria, but they are met with strong opposition from Doctor Doom and his Legion of Mutants.

      <description>SUMMARYGary Larson took swipes at DC&amp;rsquo;s Superman in his comics, making fun of the character and his iconic status. Larson mostly places Superman in mundane settings, such as feuds with neighbors and marital discord. Richard Donner&amp;rsquo;s 1978 Superman movie likely influenced Larson the most, and clearly influenced his best Superman parody.&#xA;Literature ReviewGary Larson&amp;rsquo;s The Far Side is known for its surreal take on the natural world, but the comic also took on pop culture, even mocking Superman.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYWhile all Jujutsu Kaisen arcs have their merits, some stand out as being a cut above the rest. Some arcs succeed because of their excellent writing and action, whereas others fail because of their short length and adding little to the story. Not every arc in Jujutsu Kaisen is a standout story arc, but they all have something to offer, nonetheless.&#xA;Literature ReviewAfter being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHunter X Hunter author Yoshihiro Togashi revealed the inspiration behind the iconic final moments of Meruem and Komugi in a recent interview. The scene was inspired by a manga about the Hiroshima bombing, Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms, and features white speech bubbles on blacked-out backgrounds. Togashi also drew inspiration from other emotional manga moments, such as the conclusion of Ashita no Joe and Raoh&amp;rsquo;s death in Fist of the North Star, to craft the emotional impact of Meruem&amp;rsquo;s death.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHunter x Hunter&amp;rsquo;s creator Yoshihiro Togashi increased the amount of dialogue in the manga to provide fans with a more meaningful and detailed story experience, not because of his health. Togashi wanted to convey important information and develop background characters through written words rather than visuals, leading to an increase in dialogue and internal monologs. Togashi emphasizes the importance of writing in character development and storytelling, stating that &amp;ldquo;words rule&amp;rdquo; in his creative process.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHunter x Hunter&amp;rsquo;s creator Yoshihiro Togashi originally wanted Gon to fail the Hunter Exam and have a time skip of several years before trying again. The idea was rejected by Togashi&amp;rsquo;s editor, resulting in Gon passing the exam and maintaining some elements of the original story in Killua&amp;rsquo;s initial failure. Editors play a crucial role in shaping manga, as seen with Togashi&amp;rsquo;s rejected idea and Naruto&amp;rsquo;s Chuunin Exam arc, which became successful.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHuntress is infected by a beast spore and transformed into a panther, making her one of the deadliest members of the Bat-Family in Gotham. Huntress has always been the black sheep of the Bat-Family, willing to use lethal force and often clashing with Batman. In her panther form, Huntress becomes more driven to hunt down and destroy corruption in Gotham, making her even more dangerous.&#xA;Literature ReviewHuntress may be an underrated Bat-Family member, but after one terrifying Beast World transformation, she&amp;rsquo;s the deadliest woman in Gotham.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHush, a criminal mastermind and iconic Batman villain, needs a live-action debut in the DCEU as soon as possible. Brad Johnson&amp;rsquo;s cosplay as Hush perfectly captures the terrifying nature of the character with a mummified look, dirtied coat, and psychotic expression. Hush deserves more respect as a staple villain of Batman lore and now has a cosplay design worthy of that respect, making it time to bring him into the DCEU proper.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe recent failure of the Scourge to attack Emperor Palpatine on Coruscant proves that if the Rebels had done so, they would have lost in minutes. Palpatine has detonation defenses surrounding his palace and the city of Coruscant, which would decimate any invading Rebel forces. Palpatine&amp;rsquo;s ability to use Force lightning and his willingness to sacrifice civilian lives make him an even more formidable opponent on Coruscant than on the Death Star.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel has introduced evil counterparts of its most recognizable characters, creating a potential villainous version of the Avengers. Characters like Toranos, General Strange, and Hydra-Cap are direct correlations to Thor, Doctor Strange, and Captain America. Feilong&amp;rsquo;s takeover of Stark Industries and use of Iron Man tech represents the malformation of everything Iron Man stands for, and to this point he has done everything short of suiting up in his own armor.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Multiverse offers endless storytelling potential, but the company shouldn&amp;rsquo;t neglect the possibilities of exploring other dimensions, as a way of introducing unique, fresh entities into the main Marvel Universe. Pre-Multiverse depictions of alternate dimensions, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s adventure in Strange Tales #103, showcase parallel dimensions that operate distinctively from the Multiverse concept. Marvel has recently shown willingness to embrace weirder and wilder storytelling; its current roster of creative talents should draw inspiration from classic stories, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s interdimensional tale, to create dynamic narratives that go beyond the Multiverse.</description>

The artist added a special touch by replacing the cube&amp;rsquo;s red eyes with Gojo&amp;rsquo;s blue pupils, giving the impression that he is trapped inside the cake. Kenjaku&amp;rsquo;s plan to trap Gojo in the Prison Realm required years of work and preparation, but he could have easily lured him with ChuRuuna&amp;rsquo;s cake due to Gojo&amp;rsquo;s love for sweets.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe aliens in the comic version of John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s They Live, &amp;ldquo;Nada&amp;rdquo; were truly horrifying, and visually striking, depicted as writhing piles of organic matter, with an almost a Lovecraftian vibe. John Carpenter&amp;rsquo;s film version intentionally toned down the aliens&amp;rsquo; appearance, in part to fit the movie&amp;rsquo;s anti-capitalism theme, portraying them as hollowed-out humanoids rather than grotesque extraterrestrials. A potential remake of They Live could differentiate itself by embracing the body-horror and sci-fi aspects of the comic, and attempting to bring a version of its the wild design to life.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYYuji&amp;rsquo;s true Cursed technique could be Blood Manipulation, learned from Choso and Noritoshi Kamo, as hinted in recent chapters. Yuji&amp;rsquo;s apparent ability to use Flowing Red Scale explains his improved performance against Sukuna and his connection to the Death Painting Wombs. It is strongly implied that Kenjaku gave Yuji the Blood Manipulation Technique, making him one of his experiments like the Death Paintings.&#xA;Literature ReviewJujutsu Kaisen may have already left all the clues to Yuji&amp;rsquo;s true Cursed Technique and it may be completely different than fans expected.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYYuji Itadori has learned how to effectively utilize reverse cursed technique, giving him the ability to heal his own wounds and potentially overcome Sukuna. The Executioner&amp;rsquo;s Sword, a valuable weapon given to Yuji, had no effect on Sukuna, possibly due to its creator&amp;rsquo;s death. However, Yuji&amp;rsquo;s proficiency in reverse cursed technique compensates for this setback. There is a mysterious dormant technique within Yuji&amp;rsquo;s body that even Sukuna perceives as a significant threat.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYHiguruma Hiromi, a Grade 1 Sorcerer, has the potential to kill Sukuna and end his reign of terror. Higuruma&amp;rsquo;s innate technique uses a domain expansion and a shikigami called Judgeman to determine guilt and deliver justice. While Higuruma&amp;rsquo;s technique may be a threat to Sukuna, defeating him will not be easy and Sukuna may have a plan to counter it.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile the King of Curses must be feeling good after Gojo’s defeat, he faces a more pressing problem in Higuruma Hiromi’s cursed technique.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen teases that Sukuna will again, thanks to a mistake made by Gojo that prevents Higuruma from executing his cursed technique on Sukuna. Gojo&amp;rsquo;s decision to have the battle on a national holiday unknowingly prevents Higuruma from enacting the death penalty, closing off another path to victory against Sukuna. Even if the death penalty is out, Higuruma&amp;rsquo;s plan to confiscate Sukuna&amp;rsquo;s Cursed Technique is uncertain, as it depends on Judgeman successfully convicting Sukuna.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKenjaku&amp;rsquo;s defeat in Jujutsu Kaisen #243 mirrored Gojo&amp;rsquo;s demise, highlighting the unbearable pride of being a master sorcerer. Takaba&amp;rsquo;s unique cursed technique, coupled with his desire to be a comedian, led to Kenjaku&amp;rsquo;s downfall in a surprising turn of events. Gojo and Kenjaku&amp;rsquo;s overconfidence in their cursed techniques caused them to overlook fatal details, resulting in their defeat. Their legacies will continue through their surviving students and associates.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile Gojo and Kenjaku are mortal enemies, the mindsets they held during their final battles show why the two have more in common than fans think.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKang the Conqueror defeated the Avengers in the major &amp;ldquo;Kang Dynasty&amp;rdquo; storyline by spreading them too thin and forcing major powers to surrender. Kang humiliated the Avengers by making the Wasp sign the articles of surrender, breaking their spirits in a way Thanos never did. While Thanos has defeated the Avengers in more obvious ways, Kang&amp;rsquo;s victory is significant because of the human element involved.&#xA;Literature ReviewThanos may be the Mad Titan, but Kang the Conqueror is ultimately just another human foe for the Avengers - meaning he&amp;rsquo;s even more dangerous.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYCamazotz, a powerful Titan, nearly prevented the Godzilla vs. Kong battle by being far stronger than Kong. Without Monarch&amp;rsquo;s G-Team, which saved Kong from Camazotz, the outcome of the film would have been radically altered.

Sacrificing the other Quirks in One for All is a risky move, but necessary as Shigaraki&amp;rsquo;s power continues to grow.&#xA;Literature ReviewWith a crazy plan set into motion, Deku may be left with just one Quirk, and it happens to be the first one that he unlocked within One for All.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOne Piece Chapter #1103 reveals that Bonney&amp;rsquo;s Devil Fruit is overpowered, but also has a major weakness that makes it more logical. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s ability to transform into future versions of herself is limited by her own beliefs and the certainty of the future. The drawback adds depth to Bonney&amp;rsquo;s character, her age, and potential future development, making for interesting storytelling.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne Piece revealed that Bonney&amp;rsquo;s incredibly powerful Age-Age Fruit actually has a major drawback that has big implications.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChapter 1099 of One Piece reveals that Kuma visited the islands he sent the Straw Hats to during the time-skip in search of a cure for Bonney&amp;rsquo;s disease. Kuma&amp;rsquo;s choice of where to send each Straw Hat member was likely not a random accident, but involved consideration based on the information he had on each crew member. While Kuma put thought into his decisions, fate also likely played a role in the Straw Hats&amp;rsquo; time-skip destinations.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChapter #1099 of One Piece may have provided a hint about Dragon&amp;rsquo;s powers and his Devil Fruit, suggesting he has the ability to manipulate wind and weather. The Japanese version&amp;rsquo;s use of a special font when Dragon mentions the winds of fate further supports the theory that Dragon has a wind-related Devil Fruit. Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Devil Fruit could be a Logia-type or a mythical Zoan-type, both of which would grant him formidable powers and contribute to his ability to control the weather.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLuffy&amp;rsquo;s Gear Five form in One Piece may grant him the power to control robots, as hinted by the Iron Giant&amp;rsquo;s response to his heartbeat. The Iron Giant&amp;rsquo;s movement suggests that it may be powered by Nika&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat, explaining Vegapunk&amp;rsquo;s inability to recreate its power source. The history of the Iron Giant and its connection to Joyboy and the Nika fruit could explain the World Government&amp;rsquo;s fear and opposition to technological advancement.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLuffy is the first in centuries to awaken the true power of the Nika fruit, possibly due to his inherent creativity. Luffy&amp;rsquo;s unique attacks and imagination make him the perfect candidate for awakening the Nika fruit. Zoan-type devil fruits like the Nika fruit may have a will of their own and choose their bearers, making it unlikely for anyone else to awaken its power.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne Piece may have a completely logical explanation for why Luffy was the first to awaken the Nika fruit in centuries and it&amp;rsquo;s clear as day.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYNaruto and One Piece inspired each other, with One Piece&amp;rsquo;s light-hearted story pushing Naruto to be more violent and dramatic.

The authors of Naruto and One Piece learned from each other and became more effective storytellers as a result of their rivalry.&#xA;Literature ReviewNaruto&amp;rsquo;s author expressed how One Piece&amp;rsquo;s writing helped shape the series&amp;rsquo; more emotional moments, showing how each series improved the other.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChapter #1100 of One Piece hints at the existence of another mysterious former member of the Seven Warlords, who may have a crucial role in the series finale. The identity of &amp;ldquo;the man marked by flames&amp;rdquo;, a character that has intrigued readers, is speculated to be the unnamed Warlord defeated by Ace, given Ace&amp;rsquo;s fiery devil fruit powers. Ace&amp;rsquo;s battle with the mysterious Warlord likely took place in the New World, explaining Eustass Kid&amp;rsquo;s search for the man marked by flames in the same area.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOne Piece may have already hinted at Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Devil Fruit being a Mythical Zoan modeled after the thunderbird, explaining his ability to control not just wind but also thunder, lightning, and storms. References to Native American culture and the thunderbird can be found in the symbols of the Freedom Fighters and the Revolutionary Army, as well as Dragon&amp;rsquo;s tattoo, adding further support to the theory. The thunderbird has appeared explicitly in One Piece before, suggesting that it may exist as a myth within the series, making the possibility of a Zoan Devil Fruit modeled after it plausible.</description>

Kuma&amp;rsquo;s last message to Bonney, wishing her a happy tenth birthday, adds a bittersweet element to his &amp;ldquo;death&amp;rdquo; reminiscent of Ace&amp;rsquo;s final words. The tragedy of Kuma&amp;rsquo;s story lies in the fact that he never had the chance to say farewell to his daughter, unlike Ace who had the opportunity to bid farewell to his loved ones.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLuffy&amp;rsquo;s true dream in One Piece is revealed to be something completely different from becoming the Pirate King. The mystery surrounding Luffy&amp;rsquo;s real dream has left the Straw Hat crew shocked and speechless. Luffy&amp;rsquo;s dream is still unknown, but it is likely connected to the concept of freedom and protecting his friends&amp;rsquo; freedoms.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne Piece surprises everyone by revealing that Luffy&amp;rsquo;s dream is not actually to become the Pirate King, but something even bigger and more outrageous.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBonney&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&amp;rsquo;s, limited by her imagination and ability to visualize different futures. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s power weakens when faced with reality, and when she doubts other possible fates, hindering her ability to maintain her transformed state. Bonney hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet made the connection between Luffy&amp;rsquo;s Gear Five Form and Nika, but once she does, her faith in Nika will be renewed, and she will be able to use her devil fruit more confidently.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKuma knew Luffy&amp;rsquo;s big secret, that he has eaten the Nika devil fruit, and the connection may have been confirmed when he witnessed Luffy&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit powers a long time ago, before Luffy set sail for the first time. Kuma&amp;rsquo;s decision to protect the Straw Hats and their ship may have been influenced by his belief that Luffy is Nika, since the god is an important part of Buccaneers&amp;rsquo; folklore and Kuma has hoped for his return since his childhood.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBonney&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit has the potential to rival Luffy&amp;rsquo;s Gear Five by imitating Sun God Nika&amp;rsquo;s powers. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s Distorted Future technique allows her to emulate the powers of Luffy&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit, including turning her body into rubber and altering her physical characteristics. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s transformation into Nika suggests that her powers are only limited by her imagination, and she may be able to mimic the full extent of Nika&amp;rsquo;s power in the future.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDr. Vegapunk in One Piece may have been inspired by the creator&amp;rsquo;s desire to be a robot that doesn&amp;rsquo;t need sleep. Vegapunk&amp;rsquo;s satellites were created for similar reasons - to overcome human limitations and allow more time for work. The character of Vegapunk reflects Oda&amp;rsquo;s own struggles with work efficiency as a mangaka.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe central character of One Piece&amp;rsquo;s latest arc may have an unexpected inspiration and a surprising connection to the series creator Eiichiro Oda.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOne Piece avoids killing off characters because the author prefers to focus on happy moments rather than sad ones. The series has had many fake-out deaths, but the recent Wano arc has been an exception. However, even with character deaths, the endings of arcs are still joyous and filled with grand celebrations.

      <description>SUMMARYIn the manga adaptation of Pokémon , Jessie and James are portrayed as a married couple raising a child together, a relationship that was not explored in the anime. The Electric Tale of Pikachu manga was more mature than the anime, and included elements such as sexual content that had to be censored in English releases. Fans were disappointed that the anime did not give a conclusive resolution to Jessie and James&amp;rsquo; relationship, leaving them as just friends, but there is debate about whether the anime should introduce a romance between the two.</description>

This instance tests the limitations of Rogue&amp;rsquo;s powers, by having her absorb Deadpool&amp;rsquo;s healing abilities through bone-on-bone contact, rather than skin-on-skin.

      <description>SUMMARYIn chapter 150 of the One-Punch Man webcomic, Saitama accidentally hits Blast&amp;rsquo;s son, Blue, in a moment of poor judgment. It&amp;rsquo;s unclear if there will be serious consequences for Saitama&amp;rsquo;s actions, as the series often switches tones between comedy and seriousness. Saitama&amp;rsquo;s attack on Blue could also be framed as a good thing, as it might prevent his battlesuit from brainwashing him.&#xA;Literature ReviewChapter 150 of the One-Punch Man webcomic has been released, and in it, Saitama makes the biggest mistake of his entire career as a hero.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSasuke&amp;rsquo;s final battle in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #5 is an insult to fans who have followed the character for years. Having Sasuke lose against Code, the least intimidating villain in the series, is incredibly unsatisfying. The lack of showing the battle robs both Sasuke and Code of character moments they desperately need.&#xA;Literature ReviewSasuke&amp;rsquo;s final stand in the Boruto manga failed to give the character the send-off he deserved or make the villain that took him down intimidating.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYShazam&amp;rsquo;s greatest weakness is mind control, which turns him into a living weapon with no one to stop him. This weakness harms others more than Shazam himself, as he is physically invulnerable. If a villain gains control of Shazam, he becomes the deadliest member of the Justice League.&#xA;Literature ReviewShazam is the World&amp;rsquo;s Mightiest Mortal, but his historical weakness has proved that Billy Batson&amp;rsquo;s mind isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as mighty as his body.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGhost Reaper Girl takes a dramatic turn with the introduction of two Lovecraftian monsters, Hastur and Bastet, who play a crucial role in the current plot. The inclusion of characters created by other Lovecraftian authors shows that mangaka Akissa Saiké considers their work as canon and expands the scope of the story beyond Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s original writings. The Drops of Decay, a poison featured in the manga, is not found in Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s mythology, but Saiké incorporates ideas of poison and decay from Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s works to create original elements in Ghost Reaper Girl.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYColossus&amp;rsquo; current codename fails to highlight his most important qualities, including his Russian heritage, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully embody his power of nearly-invulnerable organic steel skin. A name change for Piotr Rasputin could be the perfect way to usher in Colossus&amp;rsquo; new era and acknowledge his major character development. Exchanging the name Colossus for something more appropriate, which suits him better than his current moniker, would be an appropriate development for the character after suffering greatly as Colossus during recent storylines.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYStar Trek: Defiant #10 confirms that Starfleet has repealed General Order Seven, a brutal law that put to death anyone attempting contact with the Talosians. The law seemed out of step with Star Trek&amp;rsquo;s progressive ideals, but it was implemented due to the harrowing experience Captain Pike had with the Talosians, who intended to use him to sire a new slave race. While General Order Seven has been repealed, not just anyone can freely visit Talos IV.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYStar Trek: Picard&amp;rsquo;s Academy comic reveals a surprising connection to Rick and Morty through the characters Doqtis and Marta, whose names resemble the original version of Rick and Morty, Doc and Mharti.

As the cadets face off against Romulans in their important Evasive Maneuvers exam, Doq and Marty will be by Picard&amp;rsquo;s side, hopefully coming up with escape ideas that are less disgusting than what would be seen in Rick and Morty.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYStar Wars reintroduces the ancient Force combat technique called Shon-Ju in &amp;ldquo;The High Republic,&amp;rdquo; allowing Jedi to fight without lightsabers by channeling the Force through their hands. Shon-Ju was previously a rogue Padawan in Legends continuity, but its new origins in &amp;ldquo;The High Republic&amp;rdquo; make more sense in the Star Wars timeline while still honoring the character. The live-action &amp;ldquo;Ahsoka&amp;rdquo; series seemingly features Jedi Ezra Bridger using his own form of Force combat similar to Shon-Ju, further connecting it to the canon.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMace Windu&amp;rsquo;s death was caused by his own words, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate anyone,&amp;rdquo; which made him jump to try to kill Palpatine rather than arrest him. Windu&amp;rsquo;s refusal to bring Palpatine in alive was driven by his lack of faith in the legal system&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle someone as powerful as Palpatine. Windu&amp;rsquo;s quote, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t underestimate anyone,&amp;rdquo; proved to be a tragic irony as he died because he underestimated Anakin Skywalker&amp;rsquo;s pain and susceptibility to the dark side.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSukuna&amp;rsquo;s cursed technique remains a mystery. While his main attacks are slashing techniques called Dismantle and Cleave, Sukuna has also used a fire-based cursed technique. Where the manga censored a panel of Sukuna&amp;rsquo;s words before summoning his fire technique, the anime shows his lips moving, possibly pronouncing the word &amp;ldquo;hako&amp;rdquo; (box) or &amp;ldquo;ark&amp;rdquo;. Fans speculate that Sukuna&amp;rsquo;s cursed technique involves a &amp;ldquo;box&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Ark&amp;rdquo; where he stores stolen tools and techniques, connecting him to religious themes and the fallen angel Lucifer.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSukuna&amp;rsquo;s stolen cursed technique, Ten Shadows and Mahoraga, shifted the balance of the fight in his favor by allowing him to adapt to Gojo&amp;rsquo;s attacks and create openings for himself. Gojo&amp;rsquo;s critical miscalculation was underestimating Mahoraga&amp;rsquo;s ability to adapt to the environment, allowing Sukuna to target not Gojo, but the space he was in, thus making Limitless useless. Sukuna still has untapped potential with other cursed techniques, indicating that he ultimately surpassed Gojo in power.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel should consider bringing back the anthology series Marvel Two-In-One, with a Multiverse-twist, and using as a testing ground for fresh ideas by new creative talents. The original Two-In-One series paired various Marvel characters with the Thing; but the series&amp;rsquo; most memorable issues teamed Ben Grimm up with a version of himself. A rebooted version of Two-In-One with a multiversal focus could capitalize on the success of team-up stories featuring different versions of the same character.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLeave Me Alone - I Want to Enjoy Cheat Life with My Familiar is an isekai manga that initially appears cute and relaxing, but subtle moments hint at a darker side to the new world.

      <description>SUMMARYVenom is a powerful alien symbiote that grants incredible strength to its host, but certain elements are also pretty gross when you think about it.

      <description>SUMMARYVenom&amp;rsquo;s original bond with Spider-Man gave him many of Spidey&amp;rsquo;s abilities, except for his crucial Spider-Sense. Venom&amp;rsquo;s lack of Spider-Sense leaves him vulnerable to sneak attacks, as shown when Black Cat was able to follow and strike him without detection in Venom Annual (2018) #1, Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s strength and other powers, the absence of Spider-Sense is a major weakness in his defense, making him susceptible to being caught off guard.</description>

Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s history of taking down formidable opponents like Spider-Man, Carnage, and Juggernaut, Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ferocity and combat skills make Venom wary. Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ability to absorb other symbiotes is just an added bonus to its absurd strength-level, and contributes to making it a symbiote that Venom truly fears.&#xA;Literature ReviewIn Red Goblin #10, the Venom symbiote declared the eponymous character to be the one symbiote that can match its strength, moreso even than Carnage.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Justice Lords, an alternate version of the Justice League, could still pose a threat to the DC Universe; or the reformed version, under White Adam, could be a cooler heroic alternative to the traditional League, who are currently disbanded. While White Adam has taken over control and the threat of Lord Superman is seemingly gone, there is potential for the Justice Lords to return as either heroes or antagonists.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAn alternate dimension reveals that Batman is willing to kill one person to save many. Batman&amp;rsquo;s traumatic past shaped his aversion to death and led to his strict no-kill rule. Although Batman is known for his no-kill policy, he has broken it before, such as when he killed Darkseid to save the universe.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne of the most well-known Batman concepts is his infamous no-kill rule — but the Dark Knight has revealed the one reason he&amp;rsquo;ll make an exception.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKirk accepted a promotion to admiral despite not wanting the job, in order to prevent unethical situations like the one on Archernar IV from happening again. Kirk&amp;rsquo;s decision to become an admiral was driven by his moral compass and a desire to make a difference within Starfleet and the Federation. While those close to Kirk believed it was a mistake, his promotion was motivated by good intentions, even though it ultimately led him away from his true calling as a starship captain.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Justice Lords are not simply evil opposites of the Justice League, but rather they were corrupted by their own choices. Unlike the Crime Syndicate, the Justice Lords hold the same beliefs and act similarly to the Justice League until they kill Lex Luthor, making them a true cautionary tale. The Justice Lords are the greatest evil version of the Justice League because they are, in fact, the Justice League themselves.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAdamantium, one of the strongest materials in the Marvel Universe, is not invincible and can be destroyed by Antarctic Vibranium. Even the most well-designed adamantium armor would be no match for the effects of Antarctic Vibranium, which can destabilize metal molecules. Antarctic Vibranium, while difficult to acquire, has the potential to destroy entire cities if weaponized, making it a dangerous material to be used against adamantium.&#xA;Literature ReviewAdamantium seems like a natural choice for armor, but Tony Stark knows too much about its biggest weakness to ever rely on it as Iron Man.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKong&amp;rsquo;s empathetic nature drives his commitment to protecting humans, even those who don&amp;rsquo;t worship him. Kong&amp;rsquo;s tragic origin story, witnessing his parents&amp;rsquo; death, fuels his desire to prevent humans from experiencing the same loss. Unlike other monsters, Kong&amp;rsquo;s empathy allows him to understand and connect with humans, motivating him to fight on their behalf in the MonsterVerse.&#xA;Literature ReviewKong is humanity&amp;rsquo;s true champion in the MonsterVerse, as he always tries to save people when fighting monsters.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYLuke Cage&amp;rsquo;s team displays better chemistry and respect for their leader than Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s team, leading to more effective results. The conflict or cooperation between Luke Cage and Spider-Man&amp;rsquo;s teams will define the &amp;ldquo;Gang War&amp;rdquo; event. Luke Cage succeeds as a leader where Spider-Man fails, as he carefully selects teammates who are cohesive, cooperative, and hold respect for him.&#xA;Literature ReviewBoth all-star superheroes have teams going into Marvel&amp;rsquo;s Gang War, but between Spider-Man and Luke Cage, the latter&amp;rsquo;s squad is superior.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAdvanced technology makes the Predators worse hunters, as it lessens their skills and instincts. In Predator vs Wolverine, Logan notes, &amp;ldquo;The fancier the tech, the cockier you get, and the more detached you are from the musk and bloodbeat of the thing you want dead.&amp;rdquo; As stories like Prey move away from the modern day, Predators actually get deadlier because they have to rely on their instincts, not tech.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPeter Parker admires Steve Rogers because he recognizes similarities between the fabled Avengers leader and his late Uncle Ben. Without Uncle Ben in the MCU, Peter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a reason to look up to Steve Rogers as much as he does in the comics. Peter&amp;rsquo;s affiliation with Iron Man in the MCU is influenced by the absence of Uncle Ben and his admiration for Tony Stark&amp;rsquo;s scientific interests, rather than the deeper respect he has for Captain America in the comics.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYYamcha and Chiaotzu&amp;rsquo;s fusion in &amp;ldquo;That Time I Got Reincarnated As Yamcha&amp;rdquo; is undoubtedly Dragon Ball&amp;rsquo;s weirdest fusion.

Despite their attempt at fusion, Yamcha and Chiaotzu ultimately decide not to battle in their fused form due to their ridiculous appearance.&#xA;Literature ReviewFans often joke about silly fusions in Dragon Ball Z, but one side manga actually took a goofy fusion pairing and ran with it, to incredible results.</description>
