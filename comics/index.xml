      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s distrust of Superman stems from his fear of unchecked power, which leads him to test Superman&amp;rsquo;s moral limits on killing. Superman&amp;rsquo;s loving upbringing and lack of significant trauma make him more willing to kill dangerous criminals like the Joker, which clashes with Batman&amp;rsquo;s no-killing rule. The conflict over the Joker&amp;rsquo;s arrest and Superman&amp;rsquo;s willingness to kill him strains the relationship between Batman and Superman, leading to Batman&amp;rsquo;s stockpiling of anti-Kryptonian measures for protection.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s scare tactics were influenced by Santa Claus and Krampus, who used similar techniques to scare naughty children into behaving. Santa Claus and Krampus have a centuries-old tag-team approach to rehabilitating bad children, which predates Batman&amp;rsquo;s fear-based techniques. The connection between Batman, Santa Claus, and Krampus shows that their tactics in fighting evil are universal and effective.&#xA;Literature ReviewBatman, Santa Claus, and Krampus are currently crossing over in DC Comics, with Batman learning he has far more in common with them than he thinks.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s plan to defeat Green Lantern using a Sinestro Corps ring is a terrible idea considering he has zero experience with the weapon. Batman&amp;rsquo;s contingency plan fails against the evil Power Ring and would have been even worse if he was fighting the actual Hal Jordan. The fact that Batman summons Sinestro to Earth by accident shows that not only can he not beat Green Lantern, but he also brings forth a powerful villain.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s steam-powered Batcycle is his most dependable vehicle, proven in two separate disasters where his other vehicles failed. The Batcycle&amp;rsquo;s ability to continue operating during a global blackout makes it more useful than the famous Batmobile. In situations where the Batmobile&amp;rsquo;s size is a drawback, the Batcycle allows Batman to quickly navigate tight areas and diverse terrain.&#xA;Literature ReviewBatman has an entire arsenal of vehicles at his disposal, but his motorcycle is even better than his iconic Batmobile for one major reason.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s contingency plans for the Justice League can be repurposed and used against other members of the Crime Syndicate. Lex Luthor proves to be more imaginative than Batman by repurposing a lightning rod to potentially take down an evil version of Shazam. While Batman&amp;rsquo;s plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on Alexander Luthor, it could work on Shazam, showing that sometimes a plan designed for one person will be effective against another.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman #145&amp;rsquo;s cover art reveals a striking Hush-inspired transformation for Batman, raising questions about the storyline and potential return of the villain. The bandaged appearance may be metaphorical, representing Batman&amp;rsquo;s fractured mental state as he faces challenges from Zur-En-Arrh.

      <description>SUMMARYBlack Clover challenges the typical &amp;ldquo;feel good&amp;rdquo; message of shonen by exploring a darker worldview where class systems determine success. The symbolic magical system in Black Clover adds depth to the story and reinforces its dreary perspective on power and hierarchy. The series effectively uses foreshadowing and subverted mysteries to create compelling storylines and develop its characters, like Asta.&#xA;Literature ReviewBlack Clover flies under the radar in the anime and manga community, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the most important of today&amp;rsquo;s shonen.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBlack Clover chapter #369 reveals that Luck and Magna have already used up half of Asta&amp;rsquo;s Anti-Magic. Fans are now left wondering if they will lose their magical powers once the Anti-Magic wears off. Contrary to initial expectations, Asta&amp;rsquo;s transfer of Anti-Magic to the Black Bulls doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically destroy their own magic. This is because Asta used the reverse Demon-Dweller Sword ability, which absorbs and wields other forms of magic without destroying them.</description>

The Quincy arc in Thousand-Year Blood War was almost inevitable given their role as equals and opposites to Soul Reapers, leading to a clash between the two groups.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe ending of Bleach was rushed due to Tite Kubo&amp;rsquo;s poor mental and physical health, not because of poor sales or pressure from the publisher. Kubo suffered from a partially torn tendon in his left shoulder and requested the manga to end within one or two years due to his deteriorating health. The Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War anime, with Kubo&amp;rsquo;s involvement, offers a chance to fix the disappointing ending and provide fans with the conclusion they deserve.</description>

Despite being ridiculed, Code has the potential to become an Otsutsuki god and poses a significant disruptive force. Code&amp;rsquo;s abilities have been underestimated, and he is likely to continue playing a major role in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile it&amp;rsquo;s commonly believed that Code is nothing more than a “filler villain”, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex shows he is still a threat to deal with.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe emergence of new powerful villains in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex poses a greater threat than the Ten-Tails Beast, as they possess the ability to absorb chakra and control their hunger. The possibility of Kaguya Otsutsuki&amp;rsquo;s return is hinted at by the new villains, who possess Rinnegan-shaped eyes and potentially have access to the Six Paths Technique.

      <description>SUMMARYHimawari&amp;rsquo;s immunity to Kawaki&amp;rsquo;s alternate reality may be due to her strong ties to her true brother Boruto and her still-unexplained secret power, as explored in the anime. However, the reason could also be that Himawari&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Kawaki is deeper and more complex than expected, as they bond over shared experiences and develop a strong emotional attachment, but this is only shown in the anime. The Boruto anime provides important details and nuance to the characters and their relationships, filling in gaps that the manga cannot always explore.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Boruto time skip missed the opportunity to give Hinata, an underrated female character from Naruto, a bigger role in the story. Hinata is more than just Naruto&amp;rsquo;s wife and Boruto&amp;rsquo;s mother, she is the heir to a powerful shinobi clan and became a strong kunoichi through her own efforts. Hinata&amp;rsquo;s absence from the main storyline is a shame considering her background and connections, and her presence during the time skip could have added depth to the story and allowed her character to reach her full potential.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDragon Ball Super&amp;rsquo;s Beerus was mentioned in Dragon Ball Z, hinting at his existence years before his official introduction. The connection between Beerus and the Elder Kai&amp;rsquo;s imprisonment was a clever retcon that linked the two series together. While Beerus is stronger than Buu, the chaotic nature of Buu made him more dangerous, according to Elder Kai&amp;rsquo;s comment.&#xA;Literature ReviewAkira Toriyama revealed that one obscure line in Dragon Ball Z actually referred to Beerus, retroactively connecting the two series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYA spin-off manga gives Yamcha an opportunity to shine by exploring different choices he could have made in the Dragon Ball Z storyline.

      <description>SUMMARYSuper Saiyan 3 is rarely seen because it drains a Saiyan&amp;rsquo;s ki significantly faster than other transformations, making it unsuitable for fights that require stamina. Super Saiyan 3 is a transformation meant for the Other World, or places where time doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow, as it uses up too much energy too quickly in the mortal realm. Examples from Dragon Ball Super and Fusion Reborn support the idea that Super Saiyan 3 should only be used in locations outside the flow of time, further emphasizing its rarity in the series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Multiverse offers endless storytelling potential, but the company shouldn&amp;rsquo;t neglect the possibilities of exploring other dimensions, as a way of introducing unique, fresh entities into the main Marvel Universe. Pre-Multiverse depictions of alternate dimensions, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s adventure in Strange Tales #103, showcase parallel dimensions that operate distinctively from the Multiverse concept. Marvel has recently shown willingness to embrace weirder and wilder storytelling; its current roster of creative talents should draw inspiration from classic stories, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s interdimensional tale, to create dynamic narratives that go beyond the Multiverse.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&amp;ldquo;The Invincible War&amp;rdquo; in Invincible #60 features an army of alternate Invincibles and a lineup of Image Comics guest stars. The TV adaptation will likely have to make significant changes since the guest stars are owned by their respective creators. Despite the absence of guest stars, the story still delivers dramatic moments and a strong narrative.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Invincible War was a huge event in the original Invincible comics, but it will be almost impossible to adapt for the Amazon TV series.</description>

While fans may have differing opinions, from a creator&amp;rsquo;s perspective, Invincible would defeat the Hulk due to his gift of flight.&#xA;Literature ReviewInvincible and the Hulk have each fought some of the most intense battles in comics.

      <description>SUMMARYViltrumites have a tradition of sporting mustaches, which represent their cultural identity and allegiance to Viltrum.

Mark&amp;rsquo;s decision to remain clean-shaven reflects his commitment to breaking the cycle of the Viltrumites&amp;rsquo; old ways and leading them towards change and a better future.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Iron Fist is honored with beautiful fan artwork, reminding readers why they want to see the hero on-screen. The image showcases Iron Fist&amp;rsquo;s full power and the depth of his character, making it clear that he is a force to be reckoned with in the Marvel Universe. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of Iron Fist did not do justice to the character&amp;rsquo;s full potential, and Marvel should bring a new version of the hero into the MCU with more vocal supporters like Kode Abdo cheering him on.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s New Ultimate Universe, with Jonathan Hickman at the helm, has built up a lot of anticipation, with the Ultimate Invasion miniseries making a lot of promises that the new slate of ongoing Ultimate titles should strive to keep. The new Ultimate Universe is irrevocably tied to the memory of the original incarnation of the imprint (2000-2015) – as a result, it should consciously work to be its own, distinct version of the Marvel Universe.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYIron Man&amp;rsquo;s Argonaut suit, made of Antarctic Vibranium, is a deadly counter to Wolverine&amp;rsquo;s adamantium-laced body. Antarctic Vibranium destabilizes adamantium, potentially beyond what Wolverine&amp;rsquo;s healing factor can handle. Tony Stark is aware of the suit&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and would use it against Wolverine if necessary.&#xA;Literature ReviewIron Man has a history of building armor to contend with heroes gone rogue, but his anti-adamantium suit is a particularly brutal countermeasure.&#xA;Iron Man and Wolverine are two of the most prolific heroes in the Marvel Universe, having saved the world, and their respective teams, countless times.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYChapter #244 of Jujutsu Kaisen teases that Sukuna will again, thanks to a mistake made by Gojo that prevents Higuruma from executing his cursed technique on Sukuna. Gojo&amp;rsquo;s decision to have the battle on a national holiday unknowingly prevents Higuruma from enacting the death penalty, closing off another path to victory against Sukuna. Even if the death penalty is out, Higuruma&amp;rsquo;s plan to confiscate Sukuna&amp;rsquo;s Cursed Technique is uncertain, as it depends on Judgeman successfully convicting Sukuna.</description>

Takaba&amp;rsquo;s unique cursed technique, coupled with his desire to be a comedian, led to Kenjaku&amp;rsquo;s downfall in a surprising turn of events.

      <description>SUMMARYKang the Conqueror defeated the Avengers in the major &amp;ldquo;Kang Dynasty&amp;rdquo; storyline by spreading them too thin and forcing major powers to surrender. Kang humiliated the Avengers by making the Wasp sign the articles of surrender, breaking their spirits in a way Thanos never did. While Thanos has defeated the Avengers in more obvious ways, Kang&amp;rsquo;s victory is significant because of the human element involved.&#xA;Literature ReviewThanos may be the Mad Titan, but Kang the Conqueror is ultimately just another human foe for the Avengers - meaning he&amp;rsquo;s even more dangerous.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKaido, the powerful former Yonko, never actually awakened his Devil Fruit, a fact confirmed in the latest chapter of One Piece. Kaido&amp;rsquo;s lack of inclination to awaken his Devil Fruit is due to his reliance on Haki and his belief that it is the best way to be on top. If Kaido had awakened his Devil Fruit, the outcome of the fight against Luffy may have been different, but it is unclear how much of a difference it would have made.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDevil fruits can potentially grant their powers without the need for direct consumption, raising questions about One Piece&amp;rsquo;s original power system. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s powers were given to her by Saturn, who fed her extracts of the fruit when she was an infant. The workings of devil fruits may be more intricate than presumed, as seen with Vegapunk&amp;rsquo;s experiments and characters like Blackbeard and Big Mom.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne Piece&amp;rsquo;s latest chapter reveals a shocking twist that could permanently alter the very fundamentals of its most important power system.</description>

Kuma&amp;rsquo;s choice of where to send each Straw Hat member was likely not a random accident, but involved consideration based on the information he had on each crew member.

The Japanese version&amp;rsquo;s use of a special font when Dragon mentions the winds of fate further supports the theory that Dragon has a wind-related Devil Fruit.

      <description>SUMMARYOne Piece may have already hinted at Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Devil Fruit being a Mythical Zoan modeled after the thunderbird, explaining his ability to control not just wind but also thunder, lightning, and storms. References to Native American culture and the thunderbird can be found in the symbols of the Freedom Fighters and the Revolutionary Army, as well as Dragon&amp;rsquo;s tattoo, adding further support to the theory. The thunderbird has appeared explicitly in One Piece before, suggesting that it may exist as a myth within the series, making the possibility of a Zoan Devil Fruit modeled after it plausible.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBonney&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&amp;rsquo;s, limited by her imagination and ability to visualize different futures. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s power weakens when faced with reality, and when she doubts other possible fates, hindering her ability to maintain her transformed state. Bonney hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet made the connection between Luffy&amp;rsquo;s Gear Five Form and Nika, but once she does, her faith in Nika will be renewed, and she will be able to use her devil fruit more confidently.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKuma knew Luffy&amp;rsquo;s big secret, that he has eaten the Nika devil fruit, and the connection may have been confirmed when he witnessed Luffy&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit powers a long time ago, before Luffy set sail for the first time. Kuma&amp;rsquo;s decision to protect the Straw Hats and their ship may have been influenced by his belief that Luffy is Nika, since the god is an important part of Buccaneers&amp;rsquo; folklore and Kuma has hoped for his return since his childhood.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYRed Hood relies on unexpected allies, including Manhunter, to take down the Joker once and for all.

The Bat-Family has been unsupportive of Red Hood&amp;rsquo;s mission to stop the Joker, pushing him to seek help elsewhere.&#xA;Literature ReviewRed Hood hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been on the best of terms with the Bat-Family, which is why it&amp;rsquo;s not too surprising he has another hero he trusts to help him.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYJason Todd&amp;rsquo;s life could&amp;rsquo;ve been completely different if he had grown up in Bludhaven instead of Gotham City. Bea became Captain Blud by stealing a superyacht and impressing the previous captain; rather than become an oprhan on the streets of Gotham, growing up in Bludhaven could have set Jason on a different path, potentially leading to a life as a pirate king. Nightwing recognizes the similarities between Jason and Bea, and acknowledges that Jason could&amp;rsquo;ve had a stable family and a sense of community if he had grown up in Bludhaven.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBlue Lock is the first manga to dethrone Shonen Jump in two decades; it is the top-selling manga of 2023. The surge in Blue Lock&amp;rsquo;s popularity can be attributed to the anime adaptation and the manga&amp;rsquo;s tie-in with the World Cup 2022. Kodansha&amp;rsquo;s achievement is significant and showcases their potential to compete with Shueisha in the manga industry.&#xA;Literature ReviewShonen Jump has locked the annual best-selling manga position for the past 20 years, and an unlikely manga just broke the record.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYShadow Eliminators could be a replacement for Jujutsu Kaisen once it ends, but it needs to meet Shonen Jump&amp;rsquo;s tough standards. Shadow Eliminators and Jujutsu Kaisen share similarities in terms of cursed spirits and moral-driven protagonists. For Shadow Eliminators to truly replace Jujutsu Kaisen, it needs a complex power system like Cursed Energy or do the unexpected and go for something simpler.&#xA;Literature ReviewShadow Eliminators is a new Shonen Jump series that&amp;rsquo;s giving similar vibes to Jujutsu Kaisen, and could replace the hit manga when it ends.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGhost Reaper Girl takes a dramatic turn with the introduction of two Lovecraftian monsters, Hastur and Bastet, who play a crucial role in the current plot. The inclusion of characters created by other Lovecraftian authors shows that mangaka Akissa Saiké considers their work as canon and expands the scope of the story beyond Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s original writings. The Drops of Decay, a poison featured in the manga, is not found in Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s mythology, but Saiké incorporates ideas of poison and decay from Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s works to create original elements in Ghost Reaper Girl.</description>

The debut chapter focuses more on the friendship between the two protagonists rather than showcasing golf as the main focus. The success of the character-driven approach suggests that manga creators can prioritize character development over action to create a compelling series.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile golf is at the center of the new Shonen Jump series Green Green Greens, the early focus is on the characters and that&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about it.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYWeekly Shonen Jump declared in 1995 that Dragon Ball Z&amp;rsquo;s Gogeta would win in a short match, while Vegito would win in a long battle. Gogeta and Vegito&amp;rsquo;s power levels are so similar that either can potentially win a duel, but Potara&amp;rsquo;s fusion has fewer faults. While both Fusion Dance and Potara Earrings have pros and cons, the rareness of the Earrings makes Fusion Dance a better option for most fighters.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYColossus&amp;rsquo; current codename fails to highlight his most important qualities, including his Russian heritage, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully embody his power of nearly-invulnerable organic steel skin. A name change for Piotr Rasputin could be the perfect way to usher in Colossus&amp;rsquo; new era and acknowledge his major character development. Exchanging the name Colossus for something more appropriate, which suits him better than his current moniker, would be an appropriate development for the character after suffering greatly as Colossus during recent storylines.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe cover art of Spawn comic books in the &amp;rsquo;90s often showcased terrifying and shocking images, such as the Violator in his true form. Spawn&amp;rsquo;s face is grotesquely scarred and sutured in the middle with a shoelace, a result of Batman&amp;rsquo;s attack on him.

      <description>SUMMARYDragon Ball Super&amp;rsquo;s Super Saiyan Blue transformation was chosen to be blue because its predecessor, Super Saiyan God, was red.

      <description>SUMMARYMutant Firestar seemingly betrayed her people in order to side with the villainous Orchis – only for it to be revealed that she is, in fact, deep undercover. Firestar&amp;rsquo;s position in Orchis was implanted in everyone&amp;rsquo;s memories by Jean Grey in her dying moments; at least, that is, according to Firestar.

      <description>SUMMARYBryan Hitch, known for his influential work on the Ultimates series that inspired the MCU, will no longer be working with DC and Marvel Comics but will continue to create comics where he owns the rights to his content. Hitch has had a significant impact on the comic book industry and beyond, including designing the Tardis interior for Doctor Who and working on the Star Trek reboot movie. While Hitch&amp;rsquo;s departure from Marvel and DC may not directly impact the DC movie universe, it remains to be seen if his work will influence the current revamping of the DC movie universe by James Gunn.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYVenom is a powerful alien symbiote that grants incredible strength to its host, but certain elements are also pretty gross when you think about it.

      <description>SUMMARYVenom&amp;rsquo;s original bond with Spider-Man gave him many of Spidey&amp;rsquo;s abilities, except for his crucial Spider-Sense. Venom&amp;rsquo;s lack of Spider-Sense leaves him vulnerable to sneak attacks, as shown when Black Cat was able to follow and strike him without detection in Venom Annual (2018) #1, Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s strength and other powers, the absence of Spider-Sense is a major weakness in his defense, making him susceptible to being caught off guard.</description>

Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s history of taking down formidable opponents like Spider-Man, Carnage, and Juggernaut, Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ferocity and combat skills make Venom wary. Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ability to absorb other symbiotes is just an added bonus to its absurd strength-level, and contributes to making it a symbiote that Venom truly fears.&#xA;Literature ReviewIn Red Goblin #10, the Venom symbiote declared the eponymous character to be the one symbiote that can match its strength, moreso even than Carnage.</description>

Without Uncle Ben in the MCU, Peter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a reason to look up to Steve Rogers as much as he does in the comics. Peter&amp;rsquo;s affiliation with Iron Man in the MCU is influenced by the absence of Uncle Ben and his admiration for Tony Stark&amp;rsquo;s scientific interests, rather than the deeper respect he has for Captain America in the comics.</description>

Hayuma and Kisama could be ideal partners, each elevating the other&amp;rsquo;s skills, but they may face obstacles due to Hayuma&amp;rsquo;s lack of training and Kisama&amp;rsquo;s concerns about holding him back.</description>
