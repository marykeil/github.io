      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s distrust of Superman stems from his fear of unchecked power, which leads him to test Superman&amp;rsquo;s moral limits on killing. Superman&amp;rsquo;s loving upbringing and lack of significant trauma make him more willing to kill dangerous criminals like the Joker, which clashes with Batman&amp;rsquo;s no-killing rule. The conflict over the Joker&amp;rsquo;s arrest and Superman&amp;rsquo;s willingness to kill him strains the relationship between Batman and Superman, leading to Batman&amp;rsquo;s stockpiling of anti-Kryptonian measures for protection.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s scare tactics were influenced by Santa Claus and Krampus, who used similar techniques to scare naughty children into behaving. Santa Claus and Krampus have a centuries-old tag-team approach to rehabilitating bad children, which predates Batman&amp;rsquo;s fear-based techniques. The connection between Batman, Santa Claus, and Krampus shows that their tactics in fighting evil are universal and effective.&#xA;Literature ReviewBatman, Santa Claus, and Krampus are currently crossing over in DC Comics, with Batman learning he has far more in common with them than he thinks.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s plan to defeat Green Lantern using a Sinestro Corps ring is a terrible idea considering he has zero experience with the weapon. Batman&amp;rsquo;s contingency plan fails against the evil Power Ring and would have been even worse if he was fighting the actual Hal Jordan. The fact that Batman summons Sinestro to Earth by accident shows that not only can he not beat Green Lantern, but he also brings forth a powerful villain.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s steam-powered Batcycle is his most dependable vehicle, proven in two separate disasters where his other vehicles failed. The Batcycle&amp;rsquo;s ability to continue operating during a global blackout makes it more useful than the famous Batmobile. In situations where the Batmobile&amp;rsquo;s size is a drawback, the Batcycle allows Batman to quickly navigate tight areas and diverse terrain.&#xA;Literature ReviewBatman has an entire arsenal of vehicles at his disposal, but his motorcycle is even better than his iconic Batmobile for one major reason.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman&amp;rsquo;s contingency plans for the Justice League can be repurposed and used against other members of the Crime Syndicate. Lex Luthor proves to be more imaginative than Batman by repurposing a lightning rod to potentially take down an evil version of Shazam. While Batman&amp;rsquo;s plan doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on Alexander Luthor, it could work on Shazam, showing that sometimes a plan designed for one person will be effective against another.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBatman #145&amp;rsquo;s cover art reveals a striking Hush-inspired transformation for Batman, raising questions about the storyline and potential return of the villain. The bandaged appearance may be metaphorical, representing Batman&amp;rsquo;s fractured mental state as he faces challenges from Zur-En-Arrh.

Fans are now left wondering if they will lose their magical powers once the Anti-Magic wears off. Contrary to initial expectations, Asta&amp;rsquo;s transfer of Anti-Magic to the Black Bulls doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically destroy their own magic.

      <description>SUMMARYQuincy were created as rivals to Soul Reapers, meant to be their opposites in every way - white clothing vs black, long-range weapons vs close-range, etc. Uryu Ishida initially believed himself to be the last Quincy, but the revelation that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t shook the story, flipping what was known about Quincy. The Quincy arc in Thousand-Year Blood War was almost inevitable given their role as equals and opposites to Soul Reapers, leading to a clash between the two groups.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe ending of Bleach was rushed due to Tite Kubo&amp;rsquo;s poor mental and physical health, not because of poor sales or pressure from the publisher. Kubo suffered from a partially torn tendon in his left shoulder and requested the manga to end within one or two years due to his deteriorating health. The Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War anime, with Kubo&amp;rsquo;s involvement, offers a chance to fix the disappointing ending and provide fans with the conclusion they deserve.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe emergence of new powerful villains in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex poses a greater threat than the Ten-Tails Beast, as they possess the ability to absorb chakra and control their hunger. The possibility of Kaguya Otsutsuki&amp;rsquo;s return is hinted at by the new villains, who possess Rinnegan-shaped eyes and potentially have access to the Six Paths Technique.

      <description>SUMMARYHimawari&amp;rsquo;s immunity to Kawaki&amp;rsquo;s alternate reality may be due to her strong ties to her true brother Boruto and her still-unexplained secret power, as explored in the anime. However, the reason could also be that Himawari&amp;rsquo;s relationship with Kawaki is deeper and more complex than expected, as they bond over shared experiences and develop a strong emotional attachment, but this is only shown in the anime. The Boruto anime provides important details and nuance to the characters and their relationships, filling in gaps that the manga cannot always explore.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe Boruto time skip missed the opportunity to give Hinata, an underrated female character from Naruto, a bigger role in the story. Hinata is more than just Naruto&amp;rsquo;s wife and Boruto&amp;rsquo;s mother, she is the heir to a powerful shinobi clan and became a strong kunoichi through her own efforts. Hinata&amp;rsquo;s absence from the main storyline is a shame considering her background and connections, and her presence during the time skip could have added depth to the story and allowed her character to reach her full potential.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGoku could have killed Beerus in the Buu arc by almost murdering the Supreme Kai, as their lives are linked. Gods of Destruction can be wiped out, as seen in the Future Trunks arc, but Beerus and the Supreme Kai are still alive in the main timeline. Beerus&amp;rsquo;s weakness is known by only a few, but it&amp;rsquo;s only a matter of time before someone changes the power dynamic in Dragon Ball Super.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDragon Ball Super&amp;rsquo;s Beerus was mentioned in Dragon Ball Z, hinting at his existence years before his official introduction. The connection between Beerus and the Elder Kai&amp;rsquo;s imprisonment was a clever retcon that linked the two series together. While Beerus is stronger than Buu, the chaotic nature of Buu made him more dangerous, according to Elder Kai&amp;rsquo;s comment.&#xA;Literature ReviewAkira Toriyama revealed that one obscure line in Dragon Ball Z actually referred to Beerus, retroactively connecting the two series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYA spin-off manga gives Yamcha an opportunity to shine by exploring different choices he could have made in the Dragon Ball Z storyline. Yamcha trains extensively and unlocks his potential in order to defeat the Saibamen and even defeats Vegeta with some help. Despite changing the course of events, Yamcha&amp;rsquo;s actions do not have a major impact on the overall Dragon Ball Z story.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe epic Dragon Ball Z battles in the Saiyan Saga go a lot differently in a spin-off manga where Yamcha gains enough power &amp;amp; knowledge to beat Vegeta.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSuper Saiyan 3 is rarely seen because it drains a Saiyan&amp;rsquo;s ki significantly faster than other transformations, making it unsuitable for fights that require stamina. Super Saiyan 3 is a transformation meant for the Other World, or places where time doesn&amp;rsquo;t flow, as it uses up too much energy too quickly in the mortal realm. Examples from Dragon Ball Super and Fusion Reborn support the idea that Super Saiyan 3 should only be used in locations outside the flow of time, further emphasizing its rarity in the series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYMarvel&amp;rsquo;s Multiverse offers endless storytelling potential, but the company shouldn&amp;rsquo;t neglect the possibilities of exploring other dimensions, as a way of introducing unique, fresh entities into the main Marvel Universe. Pre-Multiverse depictions of alternate dimensions, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s adventure in Strange Tales #103, showcase parallel dimensions that operate distinctively from the Multiverse concept. Marvel has recently shown willingness to embrace weirder and wilder storytelling; its current roster of creative talents should draw inspiration from classic stories, like the Human Torch&amp;rsquo;s interdimensional tale, to create dynamic narratives that go beyond the Multiverse.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYSuperman&amp;rsquo;s success in the Injustice Universe was largely due to the support of his Justice League allies, who each had their own unique reasons for joining him. Wonder Woman&amp;rsquo;s character in the Injustice Universe was drastically changed after her discovery that Steve Trevor was a Nazi agent, leading her to embrace Superman&amp;rsquo;s dark methods. The Flash initially supported Superman but eventually had a crisis of conscience and decided to betray him, realizing that Superman&amp;rsquo;s brutality needed to be stopped.</description>

      <description>SUMMARY&amp;ldquo;The Invincible War&amp;rdquo; in Invincible #60 features an army of alternate Invincibles and a lineup of Image Comics guest stars. The TV adaptation will likely have to make significant changes since the guest stars are owned by their respective creators. Despite the absence of guest stars, the story still delivers dramatic moments and a strong narrative.&#xA;Literature ReviewThe Invincible War was a huge event in the original Invincible comics, but it will be almost impossible to adapt for the Amazon TV series.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYViltrumites have a tradition of sporting mustaches, which represent their cultural identity and allegiance to Viltrum.

The image showcases Iron Fist&amp;rsquo;s full power and the depth of his character, making it clear that he is a force to be reckoned with in the Marvel Universe. Netflix&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of Iron Fist did not do justice to the character&amp;rsquo;s full potential, and Marvel should bring a new version of the hero into the MCU with more vocal supporters like Kode Abdo cheering him on.</description>

Tony Stark is aware of the suit&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and would use it against Wolverine if necessary.&#xA;Literature ReviewIron Man has a history of building armor to contend with heroes gone rogue, but his anti-adamantium suit is a particularly brutal countermeasure.&#xA;Iron Man and Wolverine are two of the most prolific heroes in the Marvel Universe, having saved the world, and their respective teams, countless times.</description>

Kang humiliated the Avengers by making the Wasp sign the articles of surrender, breaking their spirits in a way Thanos never did. While Thanos has defeated the Avengers in more obvious ways, Kang&amp;rsquo;s victory is significant because of the human element involved.&#xA;Literature ReviewThanos may be the Mad Titan, but Kang the Conqueror is ultimately just another human foe for the Avengers - meaning he&amp;rsquo;s even more dangerous.</description>

Past precedent in the series suggests that flashbacks and origin stories for villains, such as Himiko Toga and Dabi, are not out of place, leading to the possibility of a deeper dive into Shigaraki&amp;rsquo;s backstory.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYKaido, the powerful former Yonko, never actually awakened his Devil Fruit, a fact confirmed in the latest chapter of One Piece. Kaido&amp;rsquo;s lack of inclination to awaken his Devil Fruit is due to his reliance on Haki and his belief that it is the best way to be on top. If Kaido had awakened his Devil Fruit, the outcome of the fight against Luffy may have been different, but it is unclear how much of a difference it would have made.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYDevil fruits can potentially grant their powers without the need for direct consumption, raising questions about One Piece&amp;rsquo;s original power system. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s powers were given to her by Saturn, who fed her extracts of the fruit when she was an infant. The workings of devil fruits may be more intricate than presumed, as seen with Vegapunk&amp;rsquo;s experiments and characters like Blackbeard and Big Mom.&#xA;Literature ReviewOne Piece&amp;rsquo;s latest chapter reveals a shocking twist that could permanently alter the very fundamentals of its most important power system.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYOne Piece may have already hinted at Dragon&amp;rsquo;s Devil Fruit being a Mythical Zoan modeled after the thunderbird, explaining his ability to control not just wind but also thunder, lightning, and storms. References to Native American culture and the thunderbird can be found in the symbols of the Freedom Fighters and the Revolutionary Army, as well as Dragon&amp;rsquo;s tattoo, adding further support to the theory. The thunderbird has appeared explicitly in One Piece before, suggesting that it may exist as a myth within the series, making the possibility of a Zoan Devil Fruit modeled after it plausible.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBonney&amp;rsquo;s devil fruit may be just as powerful as Luffy&amp;rsquo;s, limited by her imagination and ability to visualize different futures. Bonney&amp;rsquo;s power weakens when faced with reality, and when she doubts other possible fates, hindering her ability to maintain her transformed state. Bonney hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet made the connection between Luffy&amp;rsquo;s Gear Five Form and Nika, but once she does, her faith in Nika will be renewed, and she will be able to use her devil fruit more confidently.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYBlue Lock is the first manga to dethrone Shonen Jump in two decades; it is the top-selling manga of 2023. The surge in Blue Lock&amp;rsquo;s popularity can be attributed to the anime adaptation and the manga&amp;rsquo;s tie-in with the World Cup 2022. Kodansha&amp;rsquo;s achievement is significant and showcases their potential to compete with Shueisha in the manga industry.&#xA;Literature ReviewShonen Jump has locked the annual best-selling manga position for the past 20 years, and an unlikely manga just broke the record.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYShadow Eliminators could be a replacement for Jujutsu Kaisen once it ends, but it needs to meet Shonen Jump&amp;rsquo;s tough standards. Shadow Eliminators and Jujutsu Kaisen share similarities in terms of cursed spirits and moral-driven protagonists. For Shadow Eliminators to truly replace Jujutsu Kaisen, it needs a complex power system like Cursed Energy or do the unexpected and go for something simpler.&#xA;Literature ReviewShadow Eliminators is a new Shonen Jump series that&amp;rsquo;s giving similar vibes to Jujutsu Kaisen, and could replace the hit manga when it ends.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYGhost Reaper Girl takes a dramatic turn with the introduction of two Lovecraftian monsters, Hastur and Bastet, who play a crucial role in the current plot. The inclusion of characters created by other Lovecraftian authors shows that mangaka Akissa Saik√© considers their work as canon and expands the scope of the story beyond Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s original writings. The Drops of Decay, a poison featured in the manga, is not found in Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s mythology, but Saik√© incorporates ideas of poison and decay from Lovecraft&amp;rsquo;s works to create original elements in Ghost Reaper Girl.</description>

The success of the character-driven approach suggests that manga creators can prioritize character development over action to create a compelling series.&#xA;Literature ReviewWhile golf is at the center of the new Shonen Jump series Green Green Greens, the early focus is on the characters and that&amp;rsquo;s the best thing about it.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYWeekly Shonen Jump declared in 1995 that Dragon Ball Z&amp;rsquo;s Gogeta would win in a short match, while Vegito would win in a long battle. Gogeta and Vegito&amp;rsquo;s power levels are so similar that either can potentially win a duel, but Potara&amp;rsquo;s fusion has fewer faults. While both Fusion Dance and Potara Earrings have pros and cons, the rareness of the Earrings makes Fusion Dance a better option for most fighters.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYColossus&amp;rsquo; current codename fails to highlight his most important qualities, including his Russian heritage, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t fully embody his power of nearly-invulnerable organic steel skin. A name change for Piotr Rasputin could be the perfect way to usher in Colossus&amp;rsquo; new era and acknowledge his major character development. Exchanging the name Colossus for something more appropriate, which suits him better than his current moniker, would be an appropriate development for the character after suffering greatly as Colossus during recent storylines.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYThe cover art of Spawn comic books in the &amp;rsquo;90s often showcased terrifying and shocking images, such as the Violator in his true form. Spawn&amp;rsquo;s face is grotesquely scarred and sutured in the middle with a shoelace, a result of Batman&amp;rsquo;s attack on him.

      <description>SUMMARYSukuna&amp;rsquo;s stolen cursed technique, Ten Shadows and Mahoraga, shifted the balance of the fight in his favor by allowing him to adapt to Gojo&amp;rsquo;s attacks and create openings for himself. Gojo&amp;rsquo;s critical miscalculation was underestimating Mahoraga&amp;rsquo;s ability to adapt to the environment, allowing Sukuna to target not Gojo, but the space he was in, thus making Limitless useless. Sukuna still has untapped potential with other cursed techniques, indicating that he ultimately surpassed Gojo in power.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYFight Club&amp;rsquo;s Tyler Durden betrays his anti-consumerism beliefs by being involved in advertising and running a demolition company in the Tranmetropolitan. Transmetropolitan hints at a shared continuity with Fight Club, suggesting that Tyler Durden exists within the body of the Narrator&amp;rsquo;s descendant in the 23rd century. Tyler Durden&amp;rsquo;s involvement in advertising and running a demolition company shows that he is the ultimate traitor to his own cause of anti-capitalism in this distant future &amp;ldquo;sequel&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYVenom&amp;rsquo;s original bond with Spider-Man gave him many of Spidey&amp;rsquo;s abilities, except for his crucial Spider-Sense. Venom&amp;rsquo;s lack of Spider-Sense leaves him vulnerable to sneak attacks, as shown when Black Cat was able to follow and strike him without detection in Venom Annual (2018) #1, Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s strength and other powers, the absence of Spider-Sense is a major weakness in his defense, making him susceptible to being caught off guard.</description>

Despite Venom&amp;rsquo;s history of taking down formidable opponents like Spider-Man, Carnage, and Juggernaut, Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ferocity and combat skills make Venom wary. Rascal&amp;rsquo;s ability to absorb other symbiotes is just an added bonus to its absurd strength-level, and contributes to making it a symbiote that Venom truly fears.&#xA;Literature ReviewIn Red Goblin #10, the Venom symbiote declared the eponymous character to be the one symbiote that can match its strength, moreso even than Carnage.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAdamantium, one of the strongest materials in the Marvel Universe, is not invincible and can be destroyed by Antarctic Vibranium. Even the most well-designed adamantium armor would be no match for the effects of Antarctic Vibranium, which can destabilize metal molecules. Antarctic Vibranium, while difficult to acquire, has the potential to destroy entire cities if weaponized, making it a dangerous material to be used against adamantium.&#xA;Literature ReviewAdamantium seems like a natural choice for armor, but Tony Stark knows too much about its biggest weakness to ever rely on it as Iron Man.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYAdvanced technology makes the Predators worse hunters, as it lessens their skills and instincts. In Predator vs Wolverine, Logan notes, &amp;ldquo;The fancier the tech, the cockier you get, and the more detached you are from the musk and bloodbeat of the thing you want dead.&amp;rdquo; As stories like Prey move away from the modern day, Predators actually get deadlier because they have to rely on their instincts, not tech.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYPeter Parker admires Steve Rogers because he recognizes similarities between the fabled Avengers leader and his late Uncle Ben. Without Uncle Ben in the MCU, Peter doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a reason to look up to Steve Rogers as much as he does in the comics. Peter&amp;rsquo;s affiliation with Iron Man in the MCU is influenced by the absence of Uncle Ben and his admiration for Tony Stark&amp;rsquo;s scientific interests, rather than the deeper respect he has for Captain America in the comics.</description>

      <description>SUMMARYTwo on Ice is a new figure skating manga from Shonen Jump that recalls the tones of Yuri on Ice, featuring two skaters who admire each other&amp;rsquo;s abilities. The manga explores personal hardships that shape a skater&amp;rsquo;s journey, like Yuri on Ice, but stands out by focusing on pair skating and allowing for individual development. Hayuma and Kisama could be ideal partners, each elevating the other&amp;rsquo;s skills, but they may face obstacles due to Hayuma&amp;rsquo;s lack of training and Kisama&amp;rsquo;s concerns about holding him back.</description>
