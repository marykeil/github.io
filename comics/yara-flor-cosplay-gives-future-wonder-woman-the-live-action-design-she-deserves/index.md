## Literature Review

Yara Flor is one of the newest and most exciting additions to Wonder Woman mythos, with a new DC Comics cosplay giving her a live-action makeover!




In the world of comics, Wonder Woman is a staple hero who would stop at nothing to save the people of Earth while simultaneously doing all she can to protect her Amazonian sisters from those that would do them harm. And in DC&#39;s near future, Yara Flor takes on the role as the next Wonder Woman, with this stunning cosplay finally bringing the character into the real world in a way that does her warrior mentality and unique costume design justice.




Posted on social media via Instagram by @zoogirlq, this creative talent is an aspiring zoo veterinarian who just so happens to find the time to specialize in making professional-looking cosplays of characters that fans across the nerd spectrum can appreciate.


 

Collaborating with a few other creatives to photograph, build, and design this piece as well as many others, @zoogirlq uses her skills to fine-tune, finalize, and wear each new homemade look to its fullest, with her Supergirl, Rocket Raccoon, Homelander, Chun-Li, and Ahsoka costumes being only a fraction of what @zoogirlq has to offer the cosplay community.

 Yara Flor Gets A Live-Action Cosplay Design The DCEU Shouldn&#39;t Ignore 
          

Currently, (and begrudgingly) going by the Wonder Girl persona in comics, Yara Flor is a more recent addition to Wonder Woman mythos as she and her lost Brazilian tribe named the Esquecida were only just introduced a couple years back in 2021. Known for being a bit reckless at times, Yara is a firecracker of a warrior who uses her signature bola weapon in battle while riding around on her pegasus friend, Jerry. Dressed in a costume that comes across as more unitard-like in nature compared to Wonder Woman’s standard attire, Yara’s look stands out with darker colors and far more gold plating, design choices that @zoogirlq recreates in her cosplay perfectly.

Standing defiant and ready for battle in the first photo while holding her trusty bola in hand, @zoogirlq’s version of Yara not only succeeds as a comic-accurate depiction of the character, but as the rest of the images in this post show, as an influential take on what Yara’s real world design should look like as well. Covered in weathered golden shoulder, wrist, hand, shin, foot, and chest armor, @zoogirlq’s second and third image gives fans a better look at her design, made complete thanks to her blue, red, and gold color scheme, and, of course, her Wonder Woman-adjacent tiara accessory.

And while it’s a long shot that Yara will get the big screen treatment anytime soon, especially if Gal Gadot continues to stay involved as the DCEU’s Wonder Woman, it’s great to see Yara’s profile on the rise and already getting spot-on cosplays usually only reserved for DC’s most popular superheroes. Yara Flor may still have a few years to go before she becomes the future Wonder Woman of the DC Universe, but as this cosplay proves, her Wonder Girl persona deserves some respect too, especially after seeing @zoogirlq pull off what is hands down one of the best live-action takes on the character ever seen in the nerd community!
