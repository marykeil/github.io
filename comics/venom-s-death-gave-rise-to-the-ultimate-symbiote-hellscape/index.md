## Literature Review

Venom is one of the darker heroes in the Marvel Universe, but in a timeline where Eddie Brock died early, the world becomes much darker without him.




Trigger Warning: Contains Mentions Of Suicide!Venom has often danced the line between hero and anti-villain, but one alternate future proved that without Eddie Brock, the world would be a much darker place. In an alternate timeline, instead of getting the Venom symbiote, Eddie ends up taking his own life, and this results in the Knull the King in Black conquering the entire planet through Eddie&#39;s son Dylan.




This dark alternate future is seen in 2020&#39;s Venom #29 by Donny Cates, Luke Ross, Jesus Aburtov, and Clayton Cowles. In this timeline, instead of Eddie Brock going to the church and finding the Venom symbiote after it separates from Spider-Man, he ends up taking his own life. This results in the Venom symbiote instead finding Eddie&#39;s wife, Anne.



          



Anne does her best to try and raise their son Dylan, but without Eddie&#39;s influence, Knull is eventually able to take over Dylan&#39;s mind, turning him into the villain Codex. Codex then goes on to take over the entire world, replacing just about everyone with symbiotes that he can directly control.

                  Sony&#39;s Venom Movies Will NEVER Show Eddie&#39;s Dark Reason for Being a Hero   Venom is one of Marvel&#39;s darkest anti-heroes, but he still has a desire to protect the innocent, and this desire comes from a dark place.   





 The World Where Eddie Brock Never Became Venom is Doomed 


          

Without Eddie Brock in his life to help keep him safe and help navigate all this symbiote stuff, Venom&#39;s son Dylan ends up becoming Codex, a major villain who takes over the entire planet and seeks to destroy the world&#39;s light in the name of Knull. This is a remarkably dark future, and it all stems from the fact that without Eddie Brock there, no one knows who Knull is or what is happening to Dylan until it is too late.

While there&#39;s no doubt that Venom&#39;s history as a hero has been questionable at best, there&#39;s also no denying how important he is. Without Eddie Brock, Earth would never survive Knull&#39;s awakening. Be it Knull&#39;s physical invasion of Earth or Knull taking over Dylan Brock&#39;s mind, both of these situations can be prevented by Eddie Brock. When Knull physically lands on Earth during the King in Black event, it is Eddie who becomes the literal God of Light and manages to fight Knull off. Eddie&#39;s influence on Dylan&#39;s life also prevents his son from going down a dark path. If Dylan doesn&#39;t have someone like Eddie to guide him, there&#39;s nothing preventing other people, like Knull, from exploiting the special connection he has to symbiotes.






 Dylan Brock Needs His Father to Avoid the Dark Side 


          

Dylan Brock eventually grows up to be his own version of Venom and is every bit the hero that his father eventually came to be. But without Eddie Brock in his life, Dylan would not just become the worst villain, but the last villain Earth ever sees. It&#39;s only because Eddie Brock becomes Venom that Earth is able to survive two separate apocalyptic events. Without Venom, Earth would have been conquered by Dylan Brock a long time ago.
