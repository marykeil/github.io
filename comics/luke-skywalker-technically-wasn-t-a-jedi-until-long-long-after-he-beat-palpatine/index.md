# Luke Skywalker Technically Wasn t a Jedi Until Long, Long After He Beat Palpatine


## SUMMARY 



  Luke Skywalker didn&#39;t become an official Jedi until years after the fall of the Empire, as a result of the Empire&#39;s anti-Jedi laws.   The public perception of the Jedi was shaped by the Empire&#39;s policies of denial, painting them as a mythical and sinister force.   In the eyes of the law, Luke Skywalker was considered a criminal and rebel, despite his heroic actions as a Jedi.

## Literature Review

Luke Skywalker is one of Star Wars&#39; most iconic Jedi, but in the eyes of Imperial law, the franchise&#39;s greatest hero was no more than a criminal.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for Star Wars: Revelations




Throughout the Star Wars Galaxy, there are few Jedi as prominent as Luke Skywalker. As one of the franchise’s greatest heroes, the young Skywalker was once thought to be the epitome of the Light Side of the Force. However, despite his training and his heroic feats, Luke Skywalker didn’t actually become an official Jedi until years after the fall of the Empire.

Star Wars: Revelations (2023) #1 contains the story In “A Trick Of The Mind” – by Charles Soule, Andrea Di Vito, Rachelle Rosenberg, and VC’s Travis Lanham – which features the bounty hunter Dengar on trial in Imperial court. His lawyer argues that the bounty hunter’s crimes were committed under the sway of the Jedi Mind Trick, painting a sinister picture of the Jedi for the court.

          




Dengar’s lawyer describes the act of the Jedi Mind Trick with malice, positioning its practitioners as callous and twisted – and neglecting the fact that Luke was not yet a Jedi at this point in the Star Wars timeline.

                  After Obi-Wan &amp; Yoda, Luke Skywalker Needed 1 Last Mentor to Understand the Sith   Luke Skywalker had one mentor after Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda to understand the Sith before Return of the Jedi, which could redefine Vader&#39;s redemption.   


 Luke Skywalker Didn’t Live Up To The Jedi Myth 
          

Dengar’s defense is ultimately thrown out thanks to the Empire’s official policy of the extinction of the Jedi, and it’s quite clear that this policy applied far outside their official legal system. Thanks in no small part to these official policies of denial, to the public, the Jedi were little more than a half-remembered and misunderstood myth with a regal yet vaguely sinister aura in the minds of the citizenry at large. Luke Skywalker may have been a noble Jedi and a true hero, but he was also a farm boy from Tatooine – something quite far from the more otherworldly portrait painted by Dengar’s attorney.




When Luke Skywalker first learned of the Jedi from his mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, knowledge of the Force and its Jedi were revelations, thanks to these longstanding Imperial legal policies – policies that would stand for years after the downfall of Emperor Palpatine. Despite Darth Sidious’ death at the Battle of Endor, his Imperial Remnant didn’t officially sign peace accords until years later, officially giving up their dictation over the Galaxy’s laws and policies, including their official denial of the Jedi’s existence. Only then did Luke Skywalker officially become a Jedi to the public at large. Only then could Luke’s more heroic nature as a Jedi begin to change the public perception of the so-called ancient religion.



 Legally, Luke Skywalker Was Just A Criminal Under Imperial Law 
          




Luke Skywalker is undoubtedly one of the galaxy&#39;s greatest heroes, but in technical and legal terms, he was an antagonist to the prevailing social order for a long, long time. While the Empire is one of the most iconic bastions of evil in all pop culture, they were also the primary legal and political power of the Star Wars galaxt for decades, and as such, their laws and mandates affected their citizens far more than any Death Star ever could. Ultimately, Emperor Palpatine did die at the hands of a Jedi, but in the eyes of the law, Star Wars’ iconic hero Luke Skywalker, was little more than Rebel scum.
