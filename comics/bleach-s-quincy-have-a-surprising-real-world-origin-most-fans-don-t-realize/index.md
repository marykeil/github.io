# Bleach s Quincy Have a Surprising Real World Origin Most Fans Don t Realize


## SUMMARY 



  Quincy were created as rivals to Soul Reapers, meant to be their opposites in every way - white clothing vs black, long-range weapons vs close-range, etc.   Uryu Ishida initially believed himself to be the last Quincy, but the revelation that he wasn&#39;t shook the story, flipping what was known about Quincy.   The Quincy arc in Thousand-Year Blood War was almost inevitable given their role as equals and opposites to Soul Reapers, leading to a clash between the two groups.

## Literature Review

The origin of the Quincy in Bleach is quite simple, as Tite Kubo once revealed in an interview how the iconic rivals to the Soul Reapers were created.




Bleach&#39;s Quincy are an iconic part of the franchise, even more so now that Thousand-Year Blood War has brought the major Quincy conflict to TV screens for the first time. But what led series creator Tite Kubo to develop this rival group to the Soul Reapers, and how were they originally conceived?




The Quincy were created very early on within the lore of Bleach, originally focused on Uryu Ishida, a major character who long believed himself to be the last of the Quincy. While Uryu eventually became an ally of Ichigo&#39;s (until the Thousand-Year Blood War, at least), he and Ichigo got off to a rather rough start, as Uryu challenged him to a Hollow-slaying contest, hoping to prove that Quincy skills are superior to the Substitute Soul Reaper.

          

Common enemies have largely kept Uryu and Ichigo aligned with each other, but the revelation that he wasn&#39;t the last Quincy shook the story to its core, flipping much of what was known about Quincy on their heads.


 The Quincy Were Designed to Be the Soul Reapers&#39; Opposites 
          




In an interview hosted on LiveAbout.com from Kubo&#39;s trip to the US back in 2008, Kubo explained his thoughts from when he was creating the Quincy. He stated that the Quincy were developed as rivals for the Soul Reapers, intended to be their opposites in almost every way. The Quincy wear white, while Soul Reapers wear black; the Quincy use long-range weapons (bows), while the Soul Reapers use close-range weapons (swords). He further elaborated that the Quincy get their name from the English prefix &#34;Quint-&#34;, meaning five, as a reference to the five-pointed cross that serves as their emblem within the series.


Tite Kubo: I created Quincies to be Ichigo&#39;s rival characters, so I put Uryu in white clothing (compared to the black kimono worn by the Soul Reapers). Quincies use arrows because they&#39;re long range weapons, so it&#39;s difficult for Ichigo to fight them with his sword, which is more for short range combat. The Quincy cross has 5 points, kind of like the Japanese 5-pointed star. 5 points, quintet, Quincy! Quincies use arrows, so if you call them Quincy archers, it sounds like a name, so I kind of liked that.





Since Uryu was the only Quincy initially, all of this certainly describes him, but it also would go on to apply to the Quincy Wandenreich seen in Thousand-Year Blood War, even though Kubo wouldn&#39;t begin that arc for several more years from the time of the interview. Knowing that the Quincy were built as equals and opposites of the Soul Reapers, the Thousand-Year Blood War arc almost seemed inevitable, as the Soul Reapers would naturally clash with this group operating in the same space. Even the structure of the Wandenreich, with its Sternritter as rough equivalents to Captains, mirrors the organization of the Soul Reapers.

Kubo&#39;s explanation is a simple one, but it highlights an element of story design by casting Uryu as Ichigo&#39;s foil, and later the Quincy as a whole as foils to the Soul Society. Their opposing traits help to highlight the differences between them, but the differences weren&#39;t so great that Uryu and Ichigo were unable to find common ground. By casting the Quincy as foils for the entire Soul Society, Bleach takes the conflict which had been kept between the two characters to a bigger level, forcing both to grow and evolve as their friendship is challenged.
