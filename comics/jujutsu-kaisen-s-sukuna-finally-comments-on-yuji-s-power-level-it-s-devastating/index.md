## Literature Review

Despite Yuji Itadori&#39;s stunning victories, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s most powerful villain has some brutal words concerning the main character&#39;s powers.





Summary

  Sukuna deems Yuji Itadori &#34;boring&#34; and not strong enough to be a worthy opponent.   Itadori receives a devastating attack from Sukuna, but he may have learned a new skill to defeat him.   Despite Sukuna&#39;s power, Itadori has the potential to surprise him and beat him in the end.  







As Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s ultimate battle against Sukuna rages on, the King of Curses finally reveals his true thoughts on Yuji Itadori&#39;s abilities, and they do not go over well. Gege Akutami&#39;s franchise has been hitting its stride once again, with the anime&#39;s second season expertly adapting the Shibuya arc that changed Jujutsu Kaisen forever and the series&#39;s epic final arc continuing to shock readers worldwide. Now that Itadori and Sukuna are able to fight in JJK&#39;s real world, readers finally get to hear what the ultimate villain of the series truly thinks of his former captor&#39;s strength.

The supremely evil Ryomen Sukuna has been living it up after being able to transfer his consciousness from Itadori to Fushiguro. Many of the world&#39;s strongest jujutsu sorcerers have taken him on and failed to defeat him. Although he is the most powerful cursed spirit in the series&#39; history, worthy challenges have entertained the battle-hungry monster. Chapter #247 reveals that Yuji Itadori is not one of those he&#39;s deemed worthy.




          

As the brilliant lawyer and quick-learning sorcerer, Hiromi Higuruma continues to impress Sukuna in their battle, Itadori sees an opening to attack Sukuna that does not go as planned. Chapter #247 of JJK has Itadori receive a devastating Cleave attack from the King of All Curses, who then tells the series main character, &#34;Get it through your head already. You&#39;re boring. You don&#39;t thrill me at all.&#34; as a chunk of Itadori&#39;s side was reduced to bloody chunks.

                  Jujutsu Kaisen Has Already Revealed Yuji&#39;s Cursed Technique   Jujutsu Kaisen may have already left all the clues to Yuji&#39;s true Cursed Technique and it may be completely different than fans expected.   


 Sukuna Does Not See Itadori&#39;s Potential 
          




The current arc of Jujutsu Kaisen has finally delivered a lot of what fans have wanted since the anime began with Gojo and Sukuna&#39;s first battle. Readers worldwide were shocked when Gojo lost his life in the first battle of the Inhuman Makyo Shinjuku Showdown. The surprising Jujutsu Kaisen death forced a manga to go on hiatus when Fly Me To The Moon&#39;s author, Kenjiro Hata, read chapter #236 and needed time to recover. While Sukuna&#39;s game-changing victory devastated many fans, the King of Curses himself had the time of his life fighting a worthy opponent, a trait he does not see in JJK&#39;s main character, Yuji Itadori, and that might be his undoing.

                  Sukuna&#39;s Victory Over Gojo In Jujutsu Kaisen Explained   In the most important battle in Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s history, Sukuna beat Gojo, just barely, and fans are still wondering exactly how that happened.   

Some of Gojo&#39;s final thoughts before passing on in the afterlife commented on the loneliness one bears after becoming the strongest jujutsu sorcerer. Sukuna has survived for over a thousand years after transforming himself into a curse, and that loneliness has shaped the villain into what he is now. Like Dragon Ball&#39;s Goku, Sukuna thrives on evolving his skills, and fighting strong opponents helps him do just that. Although Itadori has proven himself time and time again against overwhelming odds, it has not been enough to put Gojo and Nanami&#39;s entrusted student on Sukuna&#39;s radar.






 Yuji Has Surprised Sukuna In The Past, And He Will Do It Again 
          

Yuji has yet to demonstrate his own Domain Expansion or the beneficial Reverse Cursed Technique to help regenerate wounds. However, after taking Sukuna&#39;s attack only to return to deliver what might be a decisive blow with Higuruma&#39;s sword, Yuji has likely learned the advanced healing technique or some other useful skill that will significantly aid him in finally putting the King of Curses down for good. While Jujutsu Kaisen has set itself apart from other series with its shocking twists, at the end of the day, it&#39;s a Shōnen story that would have the most satisfying ending by having Sukuna defeated by Itadori.
