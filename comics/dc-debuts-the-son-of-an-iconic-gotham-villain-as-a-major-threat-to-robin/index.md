## Literature Review

A new villainous legacy is revealed as Robin discovers one of his new schoolmates is the son of one of the biggest psychopaths in Gotham.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman and Robin #5!As if high school wasn&#39;t hard enough for Robin, now he has to deal with the son of one of the worst killers in Gotham. Damian Wayne has had a hard time adjusting to the life of an average teenager, made only worse by a bully with a connection to Victor Zsasz.




In Batman and Robin #5 by Joshua Williamson and Nikola Čižmešija, Damian is continuing his investigation into the strange new villain Shush, who he believes to be his new principal, who&#39;s also the school&#39;s soccer coach. Damian joins the team and excels in the sport until a goalie puts an end to the Boy Wonder&#39;s demonstration.



          

Later that night, Batman and Robin investigate the soccer team as Damian is suspicious of Zach, the team&#39;s goalie, after recognizing his moves during the game. The Dynamic Duo tracks Zach down where they discover Zach has a private altar to his father, Victor Zsasz, where Zach mentions plans to reunite with the infamous killer.

Batman and Robin may have had a tough few years, but they finally restarted their partnership and just in time, too. A strange series of events began happening that involved science labs being targeted, as well as a geneticist named Dr. Kafira. The operation involved genetic splicing with animals, which roped in several notable animal-themed villains such as Orca, Killer Croc and the Terrible Trio (who weren&#39;t animal-hybrids but are now). The minds behind these crimes were Man-Bat, who has evolved into something far more dangerous, and a mysterious woman named Shush, whom Damian believes to be his former mentor and current principal.

Victor Zsasz isn&#39;t the first Batman villain to have a child around Robin&#39;s age, but Zsasz is most certainly someone not equipped to be a father. Zsasz is one of the worst serious killers in Gotham and his body count can be seen in tally marks all over the killer&#39;s body. Zsasz is a sadist and an outright monster and it looks like his son is a regular chip off the ol&#39; block. It&#39;s uncertain if Zach has killed anyone like his father, though by the looks of things, it seems that the young man strongly desires to emulate his role model. Whatever Zach has planned, Gotham could be in serious trouble.






 Robin&#39;s New Foe is Going to Unleash a Killer on Gotham 
          

Zsasz might not have the body count of the Joker or the ambition of the Riddler, but Zsasz is one of the sickest minds in Gotham. If Zach manages to free his father, there&#39;s no telling what he&#39;ll do, especially if he has a partner who&#39;s just as twisted as Zsasz is. Robin should be enough to stop Zsasz&#39;s offspring, but if he managed to show up Damian in soccer, could he be hiding some serious combat skills? Victor Zsasz and his son could give Batman and Robin a run for their money if Zach manages to free his depraved father.

Batman and Robin #5 is on sale now from DC Comics.
