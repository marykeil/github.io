# Ghost Rider vs Hulk Unleashes a New Weapon of Vengeance Hellfire Grenades


## SUMMARY 



  Ghost Rider gets a fearsome new weapon - hellfire grenades - in his battle against the Hulk in Incredible Hulk #7.   The previous issue introduced a Ghost Rider resembling a WWII soldier, who attacks the Hulk with his hellfire pistol and grenades.   The hellfire grenades slow down the Hulk but do not stop him, hinting at a bigger threat that the Ghost Rider has emerged to face. Other Ghost Riders should consider using these grenades too.

Warning: contains potential spoilers for Incredible Hulk #7!




Ghost Rider is set to take on the Hulk, and the Spirit of Vengeance will get a fearsome new weapon: hellfire grenades! The Hulk is on a cross-country odyssey in the latest run of his solo title, fighting monsters and staying one step ahead of an ancient evil. In a preview for The Incredible Hulk #7, Bruce Banner confronts a new Ghost Rider who uses some truly novel weapons.

The Incredible Hulk #7 is written by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and drawn by Nic Klein. In the previous issue, a Ghost Rider, resembling a World War II motorcycle soldier, attacks the Hulk. As the preview opens, the two monsters are locked in mortal combat. Ghost Rider first uses a pistol that spits his trademark hellfire. Undaunted, the Hulk continues his assault, forcing the Ghost Rider to brandish his hellfire grenades. It explodes, covering the Hulk in hellfire.

         




The preview ends there, hinting that the Ghost Rider emerged in response to another threat that was not the Hulk.


 The Hellfire Grenades Are Already One of Ghost Rider&#39;s Coolest Weapons 
          

Since his debut over 50 years ago, Ghost Rider has had a number of formidable weapons and tricks at his disposal. In addition to his flaming motorcycle and Penance Stare, Ghost Rider and other Spirits of Vengeance regularly use hellfire against their opponents. The unidentified Ghost Rider in this preview will need all the hellfire he can get in his battle against the Hulk, who is on a quest to find the Mother of All Horrors, who commands Earth’s monsters–including Ghost Rider.

This Ghost Rider is not the only Spirit of Vengeance to use hellfire weapons. During the early 1990s, Johnny Blaze was not possessed by a Spirit of Vengeance, and instead rode around on a regular motorcycle, using a shotgun that dispensed hellfire, similar to the preview Ghost Rider’s pistol. These hellfire weapons are usually enough to take out even the nastiest and most powerful of supernatural foes, but as seen in the preview, they barely faze the Hulk. Fortunately, the unknown Ghost Rider had their hellfire grenades and while it does not stop the Hulk altogether, it does slow him down.




                  Hulk Is So Strong, He Broke Marvel&#39;s Most Unbeatable Mutant Power   Hulk&#39;s unmatched strength has pulled off some incredible feats throughout Marvel Comics history, &amp; beating X-Men&#39;s unbeatable mutant was one of them.    



 Other Ghost Riders Need to Use Hellfire Grenades 
          

While the hellfire grenades’ effectiveness against the Hulk is debatable, they can still be one of Ghost Rider’s best weapons. Johnny Blaze’s hellfire shotgun showed that it could be effectively weaponized in new and creative ways. The hellfire shotgun ended many reigns of terror, and the hellfire grenade has the potential to do the same. So far, the Ghost Rider of the preview seems to be the only Spirit of Vengeance who uses them, and it would behoove other Ghost Riders to take them up. A hellfire grenade in the hands of Johnny Blaze or Robbie Reyes could do some serious damage, just like it did to the Hulk.




Incredible Hulk #7 is on sale December 20 from Marvel Comics!
