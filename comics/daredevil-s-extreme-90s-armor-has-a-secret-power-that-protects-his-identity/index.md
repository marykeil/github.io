## Literature Review

Daredevil&#39;s classic 90s black armor is back, and has just been revealed to have a secret power that any superhero would kill to possess.




Warning: Spoilers for Daredevil: Black Armor #1!Daredevil just proved his black &#39;90s armor has a major &#39;power&#39; that his other costumes don&#39;t. In 1993&#39;s Daredevil #320, the Man Without Fear was left without a costume following a violent encounter with Silver Sable. The next issue famously replaced it with a new armored suit that was perfectly at home in the &#39;extreme nineties&#39; - albeit one that didn&#39;t last very long.




Daredevil: Black Armor #1 revisits the &#39;Black Armor&#39; era in a story by D.G. Chichester, JP Mayer, Clayton Cowles, Netho Diaz, and Andrew Dalhouse. At this point in Matt Murdock&#39;s life, he&#39;s faked his death and resurfaced in Hell&#39;s Kitchen with new black and red armor that&#39;s been spruced up by Melvin Potter, the former Gladiator. This ultimately leads to Matt making his presence known to the Kingpin.



          

 As Wilson Fisk is at a chop shop with the owner, they look up to see Daredevil right above their heads. Except not even Kingpin recognizes Matt as the same man he has fought so many times before - and even unmasked.

Unlike some hero and villain pairs, Daredevil and Kingpin have a very intimate relationship. The two have fought hand to hand constantly, often been forced to work together, and even have shared love interests. Wilson Fisk has also long known Daredevil&#39;s civilian identity, holding it over him as a shared secret. The two are so close that they can often sense the other&#39;s involvement in a scheme before they&#39;re exposed - one of Daredevil&#39;s most famous lines sees him blame Kingpin for the explosion of his home, simply because it&#39;s Wilson&#39;s style - &#34;It was a nice piece of work, Kingpin. You shouldn&#39;t have signed it.&#34;

But despite Matt Murdock likely maintaining the same mannerisms and voice that Kingpin knows inside out, Fisk assumes this to be a new vigilante assuming the Daredevil identity. Kingpin calls him &#34;The new Daredevil, every bit as respectful as the dead one,&#34; and refers to his &#34;predecessor.&#34; Even Kingpin&#39;s thugs don&#39;t recognize him, instantly calling him &#34;the new Hornhead.&#34; While Daredevil is believed dead at this point, it&#39;s not as if his mask even covers all of his face - apparently there&#39;s something about the black suit that is so transformative, everyone Matt meets instantly assumes he&#39;s a new person.

Given Daredevil&#39;s history, this actually makes sense. Perhaps because of his enhanced senses, Matt has some incredible acting skills - long ago convincing his friends he had a twin, sighted brother by adopting the role of Mike Murdock. He&#39;s also had some freaky ninja training that allows him to mislead others - in Daredevil vol. 2 #74, he hides his presence from a group of people who know his face, despite sitting right in front of them. Finally, it&#39;s likely the heavier armored costume does change his body language - Melvin Potter is a costume-making genius, and clearly had a hand in building an entirely new identity for Daredevil in the form of this costume.

Superhero costumes are meant to protect the identity of those who wear them, and Daredevil&#39;s black armor may be the best ever at accomplishing this. Despite going by the same name and fighting his closest nemesis, Daredevil is rendered unrecognizable by his new suit - a fresh start that Matt Murdock has spent many years of his life wishing he could recapture.
