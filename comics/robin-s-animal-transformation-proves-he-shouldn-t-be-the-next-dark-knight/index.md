## Literature Review

The events of “Beast World” finally come for Robin as he gains a new animal form that reveals a surprising inner truth about Damian Wayne.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Nightwing #109!If anything proves that Robin shouldn&#39;t take after his father, it&#39;s his new animal transformation. DC Comics&#39; &#34;Beast World&#34; crossover is changing hero and villain alike and even Batman&#39;s son can&#39;t escape the madness. But his shockingly fuzzy side reveals just how different Damian Wayne really is from his father.




In Nightwing #109&#39;s backup story &#34;Beast World Prologue&#34; by Tom Taylor and Sami Basri, Robin is patrolling Gotham, curious why fewer animal-human hybrids have sprouted up in the city compared to others. Damian&#39;s investigation leads him to Gotham Zoo, a facility that&#39;s been abandoned and fallen into disrepair.

          

However, the Zoo harbors several animal people, all under the control of a new villain (the recently revealed Apex Ava). She has her hybrids subdue Damian and pulls out one of Beast Boy&#39;s spores and feeds it to him. Damian undergoes a violent and painful transformation and when all is said and done, the Boy Wonder is turned into a half-cat creature.


 Robin&#39;s Animal Transformation is Surprisingly Adorable 


          




From Metropolis to Gotham City, every corner of the DC Universe has been under attack by a beloved Titan. Beast Boy changed himself into a giant Starro-like monster to repel an alien invader. Unfortunately, he was mind-wiped and left stuck in his destructive new form. Things went from bad to worse when he unleashed spores that invaded Earth and began seeking out the most powerful hosts possible. Street-level heroes, speedsters, and even Kryptonians have all become infected by Garro&#39;s spores and are doing major damage to their home. The remaining heroes have no choice but to fight their friends and avoid the parasitic spores while doing so.

Other members of the Bat-Family like Batman and Jason Todd have transformed into wolves, so it&#39;s a bit surprising to see Damian become a cat. But the transformations in &#34;Beast World&#34; do reflect those who are infected to some degree (such as Harley Quinn becoming a strong, but ultimately friendly bunny). For all his bluster and edge, Damian&#39;s actually a pretty sweet kid and he&#39;s shown an affinity for smaller animals like bats and cats. While his transformation goes in a much different direction than Batman&#39;s, it&#39;s an important reminder that Damian is his own person and not a carbon copy of his father.






 Robin is an Individual and Deserves His Own Life 
          

Damian Wayne was conditioned to be just like his father, and in a way, he still feels that pressure. Potential glimpses into the future show that for better or worse, Damian is going to assume Batman&#39;s mantle one day. But at his core, Damian&#39;s not like his father. He knows it and Bruce knows it. While Robin may feel expected to grow up and take his birthright, it would behoove him to forge an identity of his own, one that better reflects who he is inside. That&#39;s not to say that Robin needs to be a cat, but maybe that&#39;s a sign that Damian shouldn&#39;t follow in his father&#39;s footsteps exactly.

Nightwing #109 is on sale now from DC Comics.
