## Literature Review

Magneto is coming back to life, and with his return also comes the mysterious and long forgotten seventh Infinity Stone: the Ego Stone.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Resurrection of Magneto #1!After spending the latter portion of the X-Men&#39;s Krakoan Age dead and gone, Magneto&#39;s resurrection draws closer with each passing day. Marvel announced a limited series detailing this journey, and the first look at the interiors teases the return of the long-forgotten seventh Infinity Stone. What role the stone will play in Storm&#39;s quest to reclaim the Master of Magnetism from the afterlife remains unknown.




Resurrection of Magneto #1 from Al Ewing, Luciano Vecchio, David Curiel, VC&#39;s Joe Sabino, and Jordan D. White will be released on January 24, 2024. That&#39;s nearly two months from now, but Marvel has already released a few unlettered preview pages via Comicbook.com. The third preview image depicts Ororo&#39;s journey into the higher mystical realms of the Marvel Universe and is seemingly greeted by the Amenthi villain Tarn the Uncaring.

         

Behind him stands a collection of powers cosmic and primordial, such as the Living Tribunal and the embodiment of Death. Among this crowd are the Infinity Stones, and the six famous gems hover alongside the lesser-known seventh Infinity Stone: the Ego Stone.


 The Ego Stone Appeared To Be Gone Forever (Just Like Magneto) 
          




The original seven Infinity Gems were formed out of the death of a cosmic being in the early days of the universe. The six well-known gems are vessels of this being&#39;s various abilities: Mind, Soul, Power, Reality, Space, and Time. The Ego Stone is the last vestige of that original being&#39;s personality and is largely absent from Infinity Stone narratives since it was ejected to the Ultraverse long ago. Despite being reunited with the other stones, the Ego Stone was later destroyed. Since then, all the other Infinity Stones have been reformed, even changing colors to match their counterparts in the MCU. It seems that the Ego Stone has finally reformed as well and rejoined their siblings.

The Ego Stone&#39;s inclusion in Resurrection of Magneto is surprising but not altogether out of left field. Series writer Al Ewing has demonstrated both a love for reinvigorating the more Byzantine aspects of Marvel lore and mapping out the greater cosmos of the Marvel Omniverse in his other titles. However, the powers of the Ego Stone are loosely defined, and its appearance in the preview art thus far indicates it functioning as part of a greater host of entities Storm must face in her quest. Perhaps the Ego Stone&#39;s return here is a setup for future plot threads that Ewing hopes to explore elsewhere.






 The Ego Stone is One of Many Hurdles to Magneto&#39;s Resurrection 
          

Speaking of the larger scene, Tarn the Uncaring is no friend to Storm or Magneto, so Ororo may have to face him in this ethereal plane before even having a chance to worry about the Infinity Stones or the Living Tribunal. Even overcoming those threats may not be enough, as solicits for later issues tease that even darker forces want to use Magneto&#39;s return for their own purposes. Magneto will return, but the Ego Stone&#39;s presence is just one more reminder of how challenging his journey home will be.



Resurrection of Magneto #1 will be available from Marvel Comics on January 24, 2024.
