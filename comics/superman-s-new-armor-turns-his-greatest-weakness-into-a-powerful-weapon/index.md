# Superman s New Armor Turns His Greatest Weakness into a Powerful Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  Superman&#39;s new armor uses kryptonite to weaken and defeat the powerful villain, the Chained, showing his willingness to go to great lengths to protect Metropolis.   Despite the risks to his own health, Superman resorts to using kryptonite gauntlets as a last resort to save the day and defeat a threat that traditional methods couldn&#39;t handle.   The use of kryptonite against the Chained is an innovative move for Superman, who typically avoids the radioactive material due to its deadly effects on him.

## Literature Review

To take down a nearly indestructible enemy, Superman dons a new set of armor that turns kryptonite into the most dangerous weapon heâ€™s ever wielded.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Superman #8!The latest Superman armor has weaponized his iconic Achille&#39;s heel. The Super-Family has just met the Chained, one of the most powerful villains Metropolis has ever seen. When all else fails to rein in the Chained, the Man of Steel debuts a suit that amazingly uses kryptonite to defeat his foe.




In Superman #8 by Joshua Williamson, Gleb Melnikov, Norm Rapmund, David Baldeon, and Jamal Campbell, Clark&#39;s powerful new villain the Chained is on the loose and hunting Lex Luthor. The Chained finds Lex at Stryker&#39;s Island and threatens to kill Lex Luthor&#39;s family.

          

Superman and the Super-Family fight the Chained, but Lex reveals that, like Clark, the Chained is also vulnerable to kryptonite. Superman speeds off and quickly returns with armor that has kryptonite gauntlets. Clark punches the Chained, weakening him enough for the Super-Family to imprison the villain. The day is saved, but the use of the kryptonite gauntlets leaves Superman in a highly vulnerable state.

To make Metropolis a better place, Superman reluctantly teamed up with Lex Luthor. Surprisingly, the two made a good team and made substantial changes to their city. Lex also bequeathed his former business empire to Superman, giving him access to high-tech weapons and armor. But as their partnership went on, Clark began discovering hidden parts of Metropolis&#39; past. One thing Lex hid from Superman was Sammy Stryker, aka the Chained, a powerful supervillain Lex contained an inescapable prison. Superman freed the Chained, only for Stryker to use his powers to destroy Metropolis in his quest for revenge against Lex.

In his long history, Superman has seen all forms of weaponized kryptonite. From gases to knives and even claws, numerous villains have taken the iconic irradiated rocks and found new, ingenious ways of hurting the Man of Tomorrow. But this is one of the rare occasions where Superman has employed kryptonite in such a capacity. It&#39;s not that he&#39;s never used kryptonite against his enemies, but using them for fisticuffs is pretty innovative. It&#39;s also a serious danger as the gauntlets have left Superman gravely injured. Superman using kryptonite gauntlets shows just how desperate he was to put an end to the Chained.






 Superman&#39;s New Armor Is His Most Dangerous Last Resort 
          

Even when facing an enemy that&#39;s also vulnerable to kryptonite, Superman is reluctant to use it. Not only does he not want to accidentally kill someone, but the radioactive material is deadly to Clark. But the Chained is one of the strongest villains Superman has faced in some time thanks to his powerful telekinetic abilities and traditional methods weren&#39;t working. Even if it puts Clark&#39;s life at risk, his kryptonite gauntlets are a powerful last resort that proves Superman is willing to go down swinging as long as it means defeating a threat to Metropolis.

Superman #8 is on sale now.
