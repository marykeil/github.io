## Literature Review

The infamous bounty hunter Jango Fett once discovered that Jabba the Hutt wanted something far worse for his palace pets before his fearsome rancor.





Summary

  Jabba the Hutt was likely given a collection of pet monsters before his deadly rancor.   Someone was collecting monsters to make a living Dejarik holo-chess game, which would make a horrifyingly perfect gift for Jabba   After facing a k&#39;lor&#39;slug meant for Jabba, Jango Fett is being hunted by Aurra Sing while searching for a valuable statue (and a showdown is imminent).  







Thanks to Jango Fett, Star Wars has revealed Jabba the Hutt once had something far worse than a rancor. As seen in Return of the Jedi, the notorious crime lord delighted in feeding those who displeased him to his pet held below his palace, directly under his throne. However, it seems the gangster was likely given a collection of pet monsters.

As seen in the new anthology Star Wars: Revelations #1, the short story &#34;Stolen Hope&#34; by Ethan Sacks and Sliney tees up their upcoming Jango Fett series coming in 2024. To that end, the infamous bounty hunter, future father of Boba Fett, and genetic template for the Republic&#39;s clone army is on a mission to find an incredibly valuable statue known as &#34;Glee Anselm&#39;s Hope&#34;. Seeking information from a black market broker, Jango finds himself face to face with a living k&#39;lor&#39;slug, part of a very particular collection of monsters intended for none other than Jabba himself.

         




Remarkably, it seems as though Jabba was at one point gifted with a living set of Dejarik pieces in the Star Wars timeline (assuming whoever was gifting them to Jabba was able to procure another k&#39;lor&#39;slug).

                  New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!   


 A Living Star Wars Holochess Set Would Be Horrifying 
          

First seen in A New Hope, Dejarik is one of the Star Wars galaxy&#39;s most popular holo-chess games, and a table was installed on the Millennium Falcon. Played using miniature versions of actual monsters throughout the galaxy, a living set would certainly be a truly bold and perfect gift for a crime lord such as Jabba the Hutt. Beyond the k&#39;lor&#39;slug, Dejarik also includes pieces resembling a ghhhk, a molator, a houjix, a Kintan strider, a Mantellian savrip, a monnok, a ng&#39;ok, a bulbous, a scrimp, and a karkath.




As a result, some of these living pieces would have undoubtedly required an insane amount of credits and effort to capture and get them all together. Furthermore, some were believed to only be part of myth and legend such as Alderannian molaters. It&#39;s exactly the right kind of gift that would both impress and entertain Jabba, provided his menagerie was big enough to hold them all.



 What&#39;s Next For Jango Fett After Star Wars Revelations? 
          

After dealing with the broker who unleashed the k&#39;lor&#39;slug on him, it seems Jango is continuing his hunt for this highly coveted statue, though he&#39;s likely unaware that he himself is being hunted by the famed assassin Aurra Sing. Using Jango to find the statue before killing him, it seems as though an exciting showdown between Jango and Aurra is imminent for the Star Wars canon, one that will presumably end with Aurra respecting Jango enough to help mentor and train his future son Boba as seen in The Clone Wars animated series.
