## Literature Review

In a preview for Blade #6, the vampire hunter enters into a new relationship with his greatest enemy and the MCU should take note.




Warning: contains potential spoilers for Blade #6!




Marvel is rewriting Blade’s lore in a way that could greatly improve his role in the MCU. Blade will soon make his MCU debut in a new feature film starring Mahershala Ali as the titular vampire slayer. Marvel has also launched a new Blade series, pitting him against an ancient, evil force. In a preview for issue six, Blade seeks help from his greatest foe in a scene that the MCU should take note of.

Blade #6 is written by Bryan Hill and drawn by Lee Ferguson. The preview opens at Chernobyl, in Russia. Fans learn that Blade has traveled back to the Vampire Nation to seek Dracula’s help in stopping the Adana. Dracula criticizes Blade’s fighting technique, saying he understands why the vampire hunter was defeated in his first encounter. Blade tells Dracula he sought him out to learn how to “fight evil with evil,” prompting a heart-to-heart between the two adversaries. Dracula and Blade discuss evil, and people’s perceptions of it.

         




The preview ends with Dracula telling Blade he will take no joy if the Adana’s agenda is fulfilled.


 Blade and Dracula Should Not Be Working Together...But They Are 
          

Since Blade’s debut in Tomb of Dracula #10 fifty years ago, the vampire hunter has chased Dracula relentlessly, cultivating one of the best adversarial relationships in the Marvel Universe. Recently, after Dracula created the Vampire Nation, the United Nations appointed Blade the Nation’s “sheriff.” In this role, Blade acted as a watch in case the Nation’s citizens got out of control. This move forced Blade to tolerate Dracula, as attacking him could potentially trigger an international incident. Now, with the Adana coming for Blade, and the rest of the supernatural corner of the Marvel Universe, new alliances must be forged.




This shift in Blade and Dracula’s relationship is a watershed moment in both of their lives. Their relationship is built on a foundation of hatred and violence, but in his darkest hour, Blade finally acknowledges Dracula has something he needs. Blade perceives Dracula as the ultimate evil and while the vampire certainly can lay claim to this title, he is in fact multi-faceted and layered. In the Marvel Universe, Dracula has traditionally been a two-dimensional villain, seeking nothing but to feed. This preview upends all of that, and gets into Dracula’s head, showing us his motivations and even briefly his fears.

                  Blade Was Originally Created For Marvel&#39;s Direct Sequel To &#39;Dracula&#39;   Blade is known for being Marvel Comics&#39; greatest vampire killer, so it makes sense he made his debut in a sequel to Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula.   



 The MCU Needs to Adopt This Approach to Blade and Dracula 
          




And by giving depth to Blade and Dracula’s relationship, Hill and Ferguson are showing the MCU the best way to approach it. Dracula was a one-note villain, but since the birth of the Vampire Nation, he has demonstrated new sides of his personality. Most of them have not been good, but here he shows Blade vulnerability, and he trusts the vampire hunter enough not to take advantage of it. If the MCU adapts this angle, the Blade movie could be better for it. How Blade and Dracula’s new relationship will play out is anyone’s guess, but for now they are uneasy allies.

Blade #6 is on sale December 13 from Marvel Comics!
