# Most Underrated Avengers Members Ever Form Their Own Team in Epic Fanart


## SUMMARY 



  Chris Ouellette has shared &#34;B-List/Replacement Avengers&#34; fanart on Instagram.   The art creates a roster out of War Machine, Ant-Man, Yellowjacket, Trick Shot, Yelena Belova, White Vision, U.S. Agent, Mr. Fixit, and Thunderstrike.   Hopefully, Marvel sees the art and gives this team their own series, similar to 2010&#39;s Chaos War: Dead Avengers.

## Literature Review

In this awesome art, the Avengers&#39; most underrated members form their own team - including Hawkeye&#39;s brother, Thor&#39;s successor, and the gray Hulk.




Breaking free from the shadows, the most overlooked Avengers members unite in a fan-created masterpiece, crafting a team that demands recognition and - hopefully - canonicity. This epic Avengers art showcases the team&#39;s most underappreciated heroes in a dazzling new light and serves as the team-up fans didn&#39;t know they needed.






The level of professionalism displayed in Ouellette&#39;s artwork is so striking that it seamlessly aligns with the standards of official Marvel comic art, blurring the lines between fan creation and official content.




Via Instagram, artist Chris Ouellette has unveiled &#34;B-List/Replacement Avengers,&#34; showcasing a lineup that includes War Machine, Ant-Man, Yellowjacket, Trick Shot, Yelena Belova, White Vision, U.S. Agent, Mr. Fixit, and Thunderstrike.


 

Ouellette&#39;s creative vision extends beyond the mainstream, assembling an Avengers dream team comprising some of the group&#39;s most underrated members. Notably, this fanart wasn&#39;t just a labor of love but a commissioned piece for Mr. Bigtime, underscoring the growing appreciation for these lesser-known heroes. However, given the unique charm and skillful execution of Ouellette&#39;s work, there&#39;s no doubt that this commissioned masterpiece will resonate far beyond its initial recipient.

Marvel&#39;s extensive comic history boasts numerous Avengers team rosters, each with its own dynamic lineup. Yet, Ouellette&#39;s &#39;B-List/Replacement Avengers&#39; emerges as one of the most unique and coolest iterations yet. What sets this team apart is its inclusion of characters who are lesser-known, but also skirt the moral boundaries of being an Avenger. The team boasts former villains like Belova, Hawkeye&#39;s brother Trick Shot, and Rita DeMara&#39;s Yellowjacket, as well as the darkest versions of beloved heroes, such as the callous White Vision and self-serving Mr. Fixit (an alternate persona of the Hulk.)

The level of professionalism displayed in Ouellette&#39;s artwork is so striking that it seamlessly aligns with the standards of official Marvel comic art, blurring the lines between fan creation and official content. The characters&#39; iconic costumes take center stage, but their expressiveness and body language offers the perfect introduction to some lesser-known Avengers names. It&#39;s easy to see from just this image how different relationships and grudges might form between the members of this imaginary team. The suggested friendship between Ant-Man and Mr Fixit and the potential rivalry between roguish Trick Shot and ultra-professional Yelena Belova are essentially already there.

Marvel&#39;s Lesser-Known Avengers Could Still Have Unique Relationships
          

Ouellette&#39;s &#39;B-List/Replacement Avengers&#39; fan art leaving fans yearning for a comic, cartoon, or live-action adaptation featuring this unique team of heroes who failed to hit the A-list. The image conjures a scenario where the classic Avengers roster is absent, and these &#39;replacement&#39; heroes step up to safeguard the world - similar to 2010&#39;s Chaos War: Dead Avengers, where deceased members of the team (including this B-team&#39;s Vision and Yellowjacket) rose again to defend the Earth against a supernatural threat.

Hopefully, Marvel sees Chris Ouellette&#39;s team of B-list Avengers for the whip-smart idea it is, as the awesome &#39;B-List/Replacement Avengers&#39; showcases an idea with a huge amount of potential to reintroduce forgotten heroes.
