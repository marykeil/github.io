## Literature Review

Duke #1 sees the introduction of a major G.I. Joe villain into the Energon Universe, with the new continuity finding them as more ruthless than ever.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Duke #1




The Energon Universe era of G.I. Joe is here, and the newly-rebooted franchise just introduced a major villain. Taking place in a world where the G.I. Joe and Cobra organizations don’t exist yet, both Duke and the upcoming Cobra Commander series will establish the franchise for a brave new era, tying in more closely to fellow Hasbro franchise the Transformers than ever before.



Duke #1 comes from the creative team of Joshua Williamson, Tom Reilly, Jordie Bellaire and Rus Wooten.




Picking things up where Transformers #2 left off, Duke #1 sees Conrad “Duke” Hauser still reeling from his death-defying encounter with the Decepticon Starscream. Discovering that the U.S. government wants to cover the incident up, Duke takes matters into his own hands and starts his own investigation, which brings him to weapons manufacturer M.A.R.S. Industries.




          

Long-time G.I. Joe fans will recognize M.A.R.S. as the company run by Destro, eventual ally of Cobra Commander. After teasing it out during Duke’s infiltration of the M.A.R.S. facility, Destro finally appears on-panel, instructing the guards to let Duke go for now, as he has bigger plans in store for the future Joe leader…

                  Cobra Commander Finally Kills a Beloved G.I. Joe Hero   In Skybound&#39;s G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series, the Joes mourn the passing of a beloved hero after he is coldly murdered by Cobra Commander.   


 Destro Makes His Energon Universe Debut In Duke #1 
          






G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #11 was written by Larry Hama, with art by Mike Vosburg, Jon D&#39;Agostino, Christie Scheele, and Rick Parker.




First appearing in G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #11, Destro has evolved into one of the franchise’s major villains in the decades since. James McCullen, Destro XXIV, originally hails from the Scottish Highlands, whose family clan forged and sold weapons for centuries. His ancestor was caught by Oliver Cromwell’s men for selling weapons to both sides during the War of the Three Kingdoms, and was forced to wear a steel mask as punishment for his crimes. The mask became a symbol for the clan; a tradition carried on to the present day, as Destro is never seen without his trademark mask.



M.A.R.S. stands for Military Armament Research Syndicate.







Destro’s Energon Universe debut immediately portrays him as more ruthless than ever. Duke learns about M.A.R.S. Industries from Dr. Adele Burkhardt, whom he meets at a conspiracy theory convention. She sends Duke to a M.A.R.S. facility to learn more. Duke is eventually discovered, and after a brutal fight with the guard Mercer, thrown back out on the street under Destro’s orders. Duke heads back to the convention, only to discover that everyone has been murdered in cold blood. With her dying breath, Dr. Burkhardt tells Duke that this was done by an Australian man in disguise – strongly hinting that none other than the mercenary Zartan carried out the massacre on the orders of Destro.

The surprise appearance of Destro in Duke #1 is an exciting way to kick off the Energon Universe era of G.I. Joe. It has already been announced that Baroness will be appearing soon in the pages of the Duke miniseries, so it is possible that the character will meet the future love of her life, Destro, sooner rather than later. With Skybound Entertainment&#39;s Robert Kirkman telling fans to expect the unexpected, anything is possible in the new continuity. No matter what surprises await in the Energon Universe, fans won’t want to miss any upcoming issues of Duke to see which G.I. Joe characters appear next.
