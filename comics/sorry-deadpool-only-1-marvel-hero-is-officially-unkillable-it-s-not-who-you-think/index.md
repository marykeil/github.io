## Literature Review

Deadpool is known for his incredible healing factor, but one Avenger will outlive the Merc With The Mouth - and everyone else in the Marvel Universe.




With an insanely powerful healing factor and stubborn refusal to die, Deadpool is widely known as one of Marvel Comics’ most unkillable heroes. He’s been shot, stabbed, blown up, and dismembered, but Wade Wilson always comes back. However, Deadpool isn’t the only unkillable Avenger, and even his healing abilities pale in comparison to the hero known as Mr. Immortal.




Known for a healing factor that lives up to his name, Mr. Immortal aka Craig Hollis has been seemingly unkillable since his debut. But 2005&#39;s Great Lakes Avengers #4 by Dan Slott, Paul Pelletier, Rick Magyar, Wil Quintana, and Dave Lanphear puts the gravity of his powers into perspective.

          

Visited by Deathurge, Craig is informed that he is actually Homo supreme – the ultimate evolution of humanity that has evolved beyond the concept of death to the point where his immortality outpaces that of Marvel’s cosmic deities. Referencing these cosmic forces, Deathurge goes so far as to tell him, “Even their life forces can be snuffed out. But not yours, Craig Hollis.”

                  Deadpool&#39;s Grossest Use for His Healing Factor Just Gave Him Wolverine Claws   Wolverine is Weapon X&#39;s greatest success while Deadpool is its deadliest failure. However, by creatively using his healing, Wade gets his own claws.   





 No Marvel Hero Will Outlive Mr. Immortal 
          

With this revelation in place, it’s said that Mr. Immortal is going to outlive all life in the universe, and even the universe itself. While the founding member of the Great Lakes Avengers may be a relatively obscure hero even in Marvel continuity, this put his healing factor far out of the league of iconic characters like Deadpool, and even above theological entities like Thor, Galactus, or Eternity. Mr. Immortal is truly unkillable at a fundamental level, but despite the sheer magnitude of his healing factor, it does have a few disadvantages when compared to other healing heroes like Wolverine.



 Mr. Immortal&#39;s Healing Factor Has a Major Downside 
          




It&#39;s true that upon receiving a fatal injury, Mr. Immortal immediately and completely heals or resurrects from whatever death he suffers, similar to beings like Deadpool, Logan, and Sabretooth. But unlike a traditional mutant healing factor, this ability only kicks in for this low-tier Avengers member when the injury is serious and life-threatening. Any other injury, such as a broken arm or a non-fatal stab wound, heals for Mr. Immortal at the normal human rate, which isn’t exactly the most useful ability to have for a superhero who has practically no other useful crime-fighting skills aside from longevity and eternal youth.

Marvel’s Mr. Immortal may not ever make it to the big leagues of the Avengers alongside Captain America or Iron Man, but he’s certainly got enough time to give it a fair shot. Outside of his immortality, Craig Hollis is really just an ordinary guy trying to make a difference in the world. And if a former villain like Deadpool’s determination and healing factor were enough to help him join a premier Avengers team, then Marvel Comics’ Mr. Immortal’s chances are better than ever – or at least he can just wait until he’s outlived every other hero vying for the top spot.






Great Lakes Avengers #4 is available from Marvel Comics.
