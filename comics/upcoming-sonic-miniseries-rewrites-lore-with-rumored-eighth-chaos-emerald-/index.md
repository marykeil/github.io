## Literature Review

Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter will document Fang&#39;s travels with his gang as they go in search for the legendary Eighth Chaos Emerald.




A 2024 Sonic the Hedgehog miniseries might be starring a completely random villain and his absurd gang, but their mission has the potential to completely change the franchise&#39;s lore forever. Ever since the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive game Sonic 2, there have been seven Chaos Emeralds, but Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter is introducing the legend of an eighth Chaos Emerald, and the eponymous villain can&#39;t help but see for himself if the rumors are true.




Advertised as a 30th anniversary special event, Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter is written by Ian Flynn and drawn by Thomas Rothlisberger. The four-issue series will feature Fang along with his gang consisting of Bark the Polar Bear and Bean the Dynamite. Major Sonic characters will also make pivotal appearances each issue.

 Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter #2                 Release Date:  February 21, 2024    Writer:  Ian Flynn    Artist:  Thomas Rothlisberger    Cover Artist:  Aaron Hammerstrom    Variant Covers:  Thomas Rothlisberger Mauro Fonseca   Determined to find out more information about the legendary-and possibly not real-eighth Chaos Emerald, Fang, Bark, and Bean make a trip to Angel Island. But trespassers looking for an emerald are going to have to tussle with the Master Emerald&#39;s guardian, Knuckles! Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails follow their own lead on another mystery...   



Issue #1 will have Fang seeking intel from Sonic because he&#39;s the &#34;Chaos Emerald expert.&#34; Fang and the gang continue on their journey to Angel Island in issue #2, which, of course, will lead them to its guardian, Knuckles.




 : Sonic the Hedgehog&#39;s Chaos Emeralds, Explained


 Sonic Comics Have Never Shattered Franchise Lore Like This Before 
          

Although an eighth Chaos Emerald would change everything, there weren&#39;t always seven of them to begin with. The first Sonic game - which, consequently, also debuted the eponymous blue hedgehog - only had six Chaos Emeralds. A seventh was added in Sonic 2 because, after Sonic collected &#34;all&#34; six in the first game, nothing really happened except players getting a special message at the very end. Adding a seventh Emerald in Sonic 2 allowed something awesome to happen once Sonic collected all of them. In this and every game going forward, it would involve Sonic being able to go Super Sonic.

Outside of Archie Comics&#39; Sonic continuity, which introduced the idea of alien Chaos Emeralds, nothing has shattered the established lore like this prospective eighth Chaos Emerald could have in IDW&#39;s ongoing comic. The only series that has come close to anything is the Sonic Prime TV show with its Shatterverse and Paradox Prism. In fact, Screen Rant confirmed in a Sonic Prime interview that the development team chose to create the so-called Paradox Prism rather than involve the Chaos Emeralds since they weren&#39;t there to rewrite history. Having the Chaos Emeralds do what the Paradox Prism does in Sonic Prime would definitely be the definition of rewriting history.






 Could There Actually Be An Eighth Emerald in Sonic&#39;s Universe? 
          

That said, it&#39;s very unlikely that Fang&#39;s search will actually lead him to an eighth Chaos Emerald. In addition to Screen Rant&#39;s Sonic Prime interview, IDW&#39;s comic writer Ian Flynn has shared numerous times about the lack of creative freedom he actually has due to Sega&#39;s wishes to keep Sonic as close to the game character as possible. It&#39;s even less likely that an eighth Chaos Emerald would be found in a miniseries as opposed to the main continuity, especially since the Sonic comic is making its way toward its monumental 100th issue. That would be the time and place to do it. However, the prospect that there could even be an eighth Chaos Emerald is exciting and gives fans hope that more changes like this could happen in future issues of Sonic the Hedgehog.






Sonic the Hedgehog: Fang the Hunter #1 will be available from IDW Publishing in January 2024.
