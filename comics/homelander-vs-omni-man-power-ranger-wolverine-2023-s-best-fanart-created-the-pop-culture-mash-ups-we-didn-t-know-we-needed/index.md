## Literature Review

Fans did not hold back when it came to creating jaw-dropping pieces of fanart in 2023 - &amp; Screen Rant was there to cover them all. Here&#39;s the 10 best!




2023 was chock-full of incredibly significant pop culture moments, especially in comic book media from Marvel Comics, DC, Image Comics, and more. Prime examples include the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles getting official successors, and the Juggernaut finally being fully redeemed from his decades-long stretch as a villain. And with these groundbreaking comic changes in 2023, the fans didn’t just sit on the sidelines, but were active participants. The amount of fanart that was inspired by these stories was astounding in 2023, with the quality of each piece being equally jaw-dropping.
Not only did a number of pieces of fanart rival the work done by professional artists themselves, but they also created entirely new scenarios/mash-ups with these characters that could never have existed otherwise - and Screen Rant was there to cover them all. From Homelander vs Omni-Man, a Power Ranger Wolverine, and a Jedi Nightwing, here are 2023’s best pieces of fanart that fans didn’t know they needed.

 10  Homelander vs Omni-Man Fanart Reveals Which Superman-Alike Would Win 
Original Screen Rant article: Homelander vs Omni-Man Gets a Definitive Answer in R-Rated Fanart


The Boys’ Homelander and Invincible’s Omni-Man are both characters reminiscent of DC’s Superman, only these two ‘Men of Steel’ are murderously villainous. Homelander and Omni-Man use their powers for personal gain at the expense of anyone in their way, and one piece of fanart answers the question: what if they were in each other’s way?
On X, formerly known as Twitter, artist Thirdphp (handle: @thirdphp) posted a thread containing multiple pieces of fanart depicting a fight between Homelander and Omni-Man. The first is shown above, which shows the two super-men facing off. The second (which is the reason for the aforementioned ‘R-Rated’ description) is posted a little further down the thread, and it shows Omni-Man claiming victory in the most brutal way imaginable.





 9  Wolverine Goes From Iconic X-Men Member To Honorary Power Ranger

Wolverine is perhaps the most iconic member of the X-Men, which was originally a team of teenagers with amazing abilities that dedicated themselves to saving the world. And it seems old habits die hard for Logan, as one piece of fanart shows him joining another team of teenage superheroes dedicated to saving the world: the Power Rangers.
On Instagram, artist David Winters (handle: @wintersink) shared a piece of fanart that depicts Wolverine in a Power Rangers suit that molds Logan’s classic X-Men costume with the more armored, Sci-Fi aesthetic of the Power Rangers’ suits in a world where Wolverine became an honorary Power Ranger.





 8  Nightwing Dual-Wields Blue Lightsabers as a Badass Jedi Knight 
Original Screen Rant article: It’s Jedi Nightwing vs Sith Red Hood In This Jaw-Dropping Fanart Redesign


Check out the original Screen Rant article, so you can see Nightwing’s Jedi face off against a Sith Red Hood! 

Nightwing has always been a champion of the innocent, someone who is dedicated to maintaining peace and order in his community - even through the use of extreme force, if the situation calls for it. These are the exact same attributes of a Jedi Knight, with their ‘community’ stretching across the entire galaxy. It’s as if Nightwing was always meant to be a Jedi, but cursed to never become one. At least, until now.
On Instagram, artist Kode Abdo (handle: @bosslogic) shares an image of Nightwing dual-wielding blue lightsabers as if in the middle of an epic battle of cosmic proportions, the blades surging with power, as Nightwing’s focus through the Force is sharper than fans have ever seen it before.





 7  Avengers Fanart Brings The MCU’s Most Iconic Moment Back To Its Roots 
Original Screen Rant article: Avengers’ Iconic MCU Moment Recreated with Their Original Costumes in Genius Fanart


The most iconic moment in the MCU has to be when the Avengers assemble for the first time in the streets of New York City while fighting Loki and his invading Chitauri forces. The team stands at the ready, shoulder-to-shoulder, all of them preparing to defend the Earth - or avenge it.
On Instagram, artist Kerry Callen (handle: kerrycallen) shared an image that recreated that scene from 2012’s Avengers, only this time, it was done in classic comic book style as if drawn by the likes of Jack Kirby or Don Heck. Each member of the MCU Avengers was wearing their original comic book costumes in a piece of fanart that brilliantly merged the two greatest eras in Avengers history.





 6  One Fanart Imagines A Gender-Swapped Superman &amp; Lois Lane 
Original Screen Rant article: Superman Fanart Imagines Adorable Gender-Swapped Lois and Clark


Gender-swaps are one of the cornerstones of fan fiction, as something so simple as flipping the genders of two main characters in any given story or property could alter the entire series in a number of interesting ways. And one artist gives Superman and Lois that very treatment with an absolutely adorable piece of fanart.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, artist Dan Schkade (handle: @danschkade) shared a single-panel fan comic of a female Clark Kent (named Clara Kent) meeting a male Lois Lane (named Louis Lane) for the first time in the Daily Planet newsroom, setting the stage of a story that’s just begging to be told.





 5  A Pitched Updated Lineup For The Fantastic Four, Complete With Astounding New Costume Designs 
Original Screen Rant article: Fantastic Four Get Redesigned Costumes &amp; New Roster in Fanart Marvel Shouldn’t Ignore


The Fantastic Four is Marvel’s First Family, but that doesn’t mean they should be immune to natural change and progression within Marvel Comics canon. In fact, one person pitched an entirely updated permanent lineup for the team, one that pays perfect tribute to its roots while also creating something new and original.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, artist Mike Becker (handle: @mikejbecker) - the creator behind Young Offenders!, Empryrex Adventures, and Big Green World - shares a piece of artwork that shows Franklin Richards leading a new Fantastic Four with the Silver Surfer and two original characters: Incredi-Girl and Kirbax. The lineup is epic, the new costumes are sweet, and the explanation behind how/why they took over as the new Fantastic Four is incredibly intriguing, and deserves to be very seriously considered by Marvel Comics.





 4  Batman Takes Inspiration From The Joker With An Unhinged Fanart Costume 
Original Screen Rant article: Batman Gets New Costumes Based on Iconic Gotham Villains in Fanart DC Shouldn’t Ignore


Check out the original Screen Rant article to see the rest of Batman’s fanart costumes inspired by other iconic Gotham villains! 

Batman has no shortage of increasingly awesome batsuits, but the ones brought to life by one fan imagined if Batman actually took inspiration from his villains for his batsuits - with the most notable being the Joker.
On Instagram, artist Tom Hoskisson (handle: tomhoskissonart) shared an original piece of their artwork featuring Batman dressed like a bat-themed harlequin with the grinning face of the Joker looming behind him. Batman even personifies the unhinged energy of the Joker while wearing this suit, as he’s about to walk right off a building while holding a map with an imaginary mini-Batman holding him back from the ledge. Plus, his iconic utility belt is just full of silly pranks.





 3  Tim Drake’s Robin Separates Himself From The Bat-Family With Fanart Costume &amp; Codename 
Original Screen Rant article: Robin Gets New Codename &amp; Costume in Fanart DC Can’t Afford to Ignore


Tim Drake really only stands out to those who hold a special place in their heart for him specifically, because as far as the Robins go, he never had the opportunity to become his own person the way the others did. Dick Grayson became Nightwing, Jason Todd became the Red Hood, and Damian Wayne was raised by the League of Assassins before even becoming a Robin. Drake was robbed of that same level of evolution - at least, until now.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, artist Sebastián Píriz (handle: @sebastianpiriz) - the comic creator behind We Ride Titans and Exorcists Never Die - shared an original concept piece for a proposed new codename and costume for Time Drake: Black Bird. The costume is black with splashes of yellow and orange, allowing Drake to stand out as his own definitive superhero while also staying true to his roots as a Robin. Plus, this fanart puts Drake in the same class as Nightwing and Red Hood as his own established superhero, Black Bird.





 2  1 Charlie Brown Fanart Attempts To Clear Up Possible Misconceptions About His Hair 
Original Screen Rant article: Charlie Brown Art Fixes How Every Movie Misunderstands His Design


Charlie Brown may be most widely known for his appearances in the &#39;Peanuts Holiday Specials&#39;, but he originated as a character in a black and white comic strip. Since then, Charlie Brown has been adapted several times in the realm of 2D animation, as well as a more recent 3D animated film, and every time the beloved character is ripped from the comic strip, there’s always one possible mistake made to his design: his hair. This is most obvious in the 2015 Peanuts Movie, but it’s something that’s been happening since the very first animated special. Now, one fan hopes to clear up this possible misconception.
On X, formerly known as Twitter, artist ‘Alex BANG!’ (handle: Jokeb0i) uses their fanart to suggest that Charlie Brown isn’t bald with a single twisty hair right above his forehead, but that he has short hair, and that ‘curl’ is actually a tuft of hair with the rest of it being implied. The original Charlie Brown artwork by Charles M. Schultz is minimalist in design, so this theory is in no way unfounded. Plus, the alternative is undoubtedly odd (especially the CG version).





 1  Indiana Jones Teams Up with His Comic Strip Counterpart: Tintin 
Original Screen Rant article: Indiana Jones Meets Tintin in Pitch Perfect Mashup Fanart


Indiana Jones is an archeologist who finds himself in perilous situations involving dangerous people (primarily Nazis), which forces him to play the role of the hero in order to stop their nefarious deeds. Swap ‘archeologist’ with ‘journalist’, and that’s exactly what Tintin is, making these two a match made in heaven - and one artist agreed.
On Instagram, professional artist Adam Murphy (handle: adammurphyart) - known for work on Disney, Lucasfilm, and Nickelodeon projects, just to name a few - imagined what it would be like if Indiana Jones met Tintin. The fanart itself is unsurprisingly amazing, but what’s fascinating about this particular piece is the potential story that could be told with a crossover like this one, allowing one’s imagination to run wild with the kind of adventure Indiana Jones and Tintin could go on together - making this one of the 10 best pieces of fanart covered by Screen Rant in 2023 that was inspired by Marvel Comics, DC, Image Comics, or any other.
