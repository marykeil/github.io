After historically expanding the lore of Arkham Asylum, DC Comics reveals a breakout that not even Batman would prevent from happening.





Summary

  In Alan Scott: The Green Lantern #2, it is revealed that Arkham Asylum was once a mental health facility that provided help to patients, but treated queer people as prisoners and subjected them to torture.   Alan Scott, a queer hero, orchestrates a breakout from Arkham Asylum after experiencing electroshock therapy and witnessing his trans friend undergo violent conversion therapy.   This reinterpretation of Arkham Asylum&#39;s history sheds light on the homophobia and mistreatment queer people faced, and presents a unique breakout that readers root for, challenging the traditional portrayal of villains escaping from the facility.  







The lore of Arkham Asylum expands in a way that reveals it wasn&#39;t always the haven for villainy that Batman knows it to be today. Arkham Asylum is best known as the facility that houses Batman&#39;s rogues gallery. However, there was a time when the true villains were actually the ones running the Asylum — meaning there was one historic breakout that even Batman would support.



The bulk of this article discusses the historical treatment of queer people as mentally ill and/or as criminals in the United States. The images include depictions of conversion therapy in a historically and narratively essential context.




This fact becomes unearthed in Alan Scott: The Green Lantern #2 by Tim Sheridan, Cian Tormey, Matt Herms, and Lucas Gattoni. Alan Scott&#39;s time in Arkham during the late 1930s reveals a special brand of homophobic horror that would horrify Batman if he knew about it. Batman is notorious for thwarting his enemies&#39; frequent plans for breaking out of Arkham Asylum, but the one breakout orchestrated by Scott is one that Batman would actually support.






          

After his trans friend Billie is put through violent conversion therapy, Alan is forced into electroshock therapy of his own. A superior authority figure on the premises finding his private journal is enough to get Alan officially committed, despite the fact that he was there voluntarily. Alan then successfully orchestrates a breakout for himself and a bevy of other Arkham residents held in the &#34;deviancy wing&#34; for their sexuality.

                  &#34;Alan Scott Is Going to Change the Game&#34;: Tim Sheridan Talks DC&#39;s First Green Lantern Alan Scott in Exclusive Interview   Alan Scott: The Green Lantern writer Tim Sheridan shares his thoughts on DC&#39;s first Green Lantern, the importance of queer stories, and more!   


 Arkham Asylum&#39;s History is Laced with Homophobia 


          




The original Green Lantern first came out as gay during Infinite Crisis in 2021. To address the new revelation, Alan Scott: The Green Lantern re-envisions the title character&#39;s origin story to recontextualize Alan Scott as the authentic queer hero he was meant to be. After watching his secret lover die in front of him, Alan checks himself into Arkham Asylum to &#34;get better&#34; as he struggles with his own queerness. But he soon learns that, despite his voluntary stay, he and the other queer &#34;patients&#34; are treated more like the Arkham prisoners of Batman&#39;s time.

As two heroes from two different time periods, Batman and the original Green Lantern don&#39;t share much of a connection with each other, but the latter&#39;s earliest adventures reveal a dark truth about Arkham Asylum. This secret history puts Arkham Asylum into a new perspective for readers. There was a time when the residents of Arkham weren&#39;t always the violent serial killers fans are familiar with, and the facility wasn&#39;t always a go-to place for villains to be imprisoned. Instead, it was a mental health facility for patients in need of help. Unfortunately, during a time when homosexuality was viewed by the bulk of American society as a mental illness, those who identified as anything other than heterosexual were treated like prisoners and tortured as such at Arkham Asylum.






 Arkham Asylum Residents Weren&#39;t Always Criminals 
          

That&#39;s what makes the breakout led by Alan Scott all the more surprisingly satisfying. Readers are used to seeing Batman apprehend villains trying to escape Arkham Asylum, but this is the one Arkham breakout where readers are rooting for the escapees. Hopefully this series will continue to recontextualize iconic DC history to account for the DCU&#39;s more inclusive — and much more nuanced — status quo.
