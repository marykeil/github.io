# Even X-Men s Worst Enemies Fear Doctor Doom


## SUMMARY 



  Orchis, the anti-hate group targeting mutants, is afraid to provoke a conflict with Doctor Doom, keeping his mutants in the country of Latveria safe.   The X-Men are seeking out allies in their fight against Orchis, leading them to send emissaries to Latveria, but they are met with strong opposition from Doctor Doom and his Legion of Mutants.   Orchis should remain cautious of invading Latveria; at least the mutant population of the small, but imposing nation should hope so, as Orchis&#39; fear of provoking a conflict with Doctor Doom is crucial to their survival.

## Literature Review

The X-Men&#39;s most treacherous foes, the anti-mutant organization Orchis, want no part of Doctor Doom. Crucially, this keeps Latveria&#39;s mutant&#39;s safe.




Warning: Spoilers for X-Men #29!Not even the X-Men&#39;s most dangerous enemies want to cross Doctor Doom. Orchis, the anti-hate group, cemented themselves as the X-Men&#39;s worst enemies at this year&#39;s Hellfire Gala, murdering a multitude of mutants and forcing countless others into hiding off the island, some even off-planet. Using their political power, they have turned the planet against mutants – but Doom, leader of the nation of Latveria, still makes them weary.






As long as Orchis is afraid of starting a conflict with the world-renowned Doctor Doom, Latveria&#39;s mutants are shielded from the villainous organization&#39;s crusade.




X-Men #29 – by Gerry Duggan, Joshua Cassara, Marte Gracia, VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles – establishes that even with as much power as they have now, Orchis has no intentions of angering Doctor Doom in Latveria. Orchis has been hellbent on wiping every single mutant off of the planet, but as much progress as they have made, their sinister influence has its limits.

          

However, there are mutants in Latveria, and yet, so far at least, no sign of Orchis in Latveria. It would appear that despite their undying hatred for mutants, Orchis does not want to risk starting a war with Latveria and Doctor Doom. More specifically, Orchis is afraid of Doctor Doom.




                  X-Men Reveals Powers &amp; Codenames of Doctor Doom&#39;s Evil X-Men Roster   With so many mutants missing and scattered, the X-Men seek out the handful left in Latveria, but Doom&#39;s Legion of Mutants are strong opponents.    


 Doctor Doom&#39;s Influence Keeps Latveria&#39;s Mutants Safe 
         

Following the Hellfire Gala, many mutants have been forced to flee off-world by Orchis, including those who received Xavier&#39;s mental push to flee through the Krakoan gates. However, the X-Men learned recently that there is a previously unknown group of mutants still on-planet in the country of Latveria, unaffected by Orchis&#39; maneuvers. Wolverine, Ms. Marvel, and Shadowkat are sent to the small nation to investigate in X-Men #29, but are immediately confronted by its imposing, authoritarian leader, Doctor Doom. In the process, they learn that these mystery mutants are a part of Doctor Doom&#39;s own personally assembled X-team, which he refers to as his Legion of Mutants.




The X-Men trio urge Doctor Doom&#39;s mutant Legion that they have no intentions of fighting. Instead, they want to warn them of the mutual threat facing all mutantkind, and potentially join forces, knowing that Orchis&#39; Stark Sentinels could be swooping in any second. One of Doctor Doom&#39;s X-Men members, Volta, assures them that they haven&#39;t seen any robots in their skies. Further, she states if they did, they would not be afraid to fight them off. In the same breath, Doom&#39;s mutants make it clear they also have no problem starting a fight with the X-Men – resulting in a brief scuffle.



 Orchis Would Be Foolish To Invade LatveriaAssuming Orchis is aware of the mutant population in Latveria – it is possible Doom could have cloaked their presence, in some way – it would be prudent of them to remain cautious of the country&#39;s leader. As long as Orchis is afraid of starting a conflict with the world-renowned Doctor Doom, Latveria&#39;s mutants are shielded from the villainous organization&#39;s crusade. Orchis is well aware of what Doom is capable of, of what starting a war with Latveria could mean for them. With this in mind, the X-Men could use Orchis&#39; fear of Doctor Doom to their advantage, if they find a way to somehow collaborate with Latveria, as they spearhead a final fight against their enemies. 
X-Men #29 is on sale now from Marvel.
