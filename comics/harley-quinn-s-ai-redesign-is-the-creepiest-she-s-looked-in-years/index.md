Summary

  An AI version of Harley Quinn gives the antihero a creepy redesign with glitchy artwork and a Purge-style mask.   AI Harley Quinn&#39;s ability to learn makes it Harley&#39;s biggest threat in the comics yet.   Earth-48&#39;s attempt at harnessing Harley&#39;s chaotic energy could backfire because of AI Harley&#39;s abilities.  







An official redesign of Harley Quinn that turns her into an artificially intelligent entity is the creepiest Harley has looked in years. Throughout the multiverse, Harley Quinn has no short supply of creative redesigns, including her cartoon bunny form called &#34;Harely Quinn.&#34; Others designs are a bit scarier, like Harley&#39;s suburban nightmare design from Knight Terrors. But her latest artificial-intelligence form takes the scary cake.

In Harley Quinn #34 by Tini Howard and Sweeney Boo, Lady Quark and Lord Volt of Earth 48 unveil the reason why they have been sending advanced versions of Harley&#39;s hyenas, Bud and Lou, to keep an eye on her. They&#39;re monitoring her to harness her chaotic energy in an effort to recreate and &#34;wield it in our more enlightened hands as a weapon!&#34; They do this by recreating what they have learned about Harley and coding it into an artificially intelligent being. The result is pure nightmare fuel as they unveil what their monster creation.






          

This artificially intelligent redesign is noticeably &#34;glitchy&#34; and pixelated as it struggles to maintain its form while speaking an unintelligible language. What makes it even worse is its face, which mimics a mask one might see in The Purge with a simplistic yet creepy smile.

                  Harley Quinn Is an Evil Marilyn Monroe in Jaw-Dropping Femme Fatale Redesign   Beautiful new cover artwork by Jenny Frison has given Harley Quinn a Marilyn Monroe-inspired femme fatale look, and it&#39;s absolutely breathtaking.   


 AI Harley Quinn&#39;s Ability to Learn Makes Her a Greater Threat 
          




What makes AI Harley stand out as a terrifying creation — outside of her horrific look — is how quickly she can learn from Harley. When the two face off, AI Harley, since its coding is incomplete, is noticeably and constantly learning from the real Harley. It starts out speaking gibberish, but as Harley tries to figure out what it is, it begins to mimic her speech patterns. When it jumps inside Harley to see if it can fill in the missing gaps, Harley&#39;s own chaos proves to be &#34;too much,&#34; as it quickly realizes there are too many &#34;unresolvable errors.&#34; This sets it up as a huge threat to Harley; if it can gain enough power, it could perfectly replicate the original Harley while still &#34;learning&#34; as an AI.

Of course, like most artificial intelligence in fiction — such as Skynet from The Terminator — the creation could end up posing a threat to the creator more than anyone else. The Forerunners clearly wanted to create this version of Harley to potentially fend off Darkseid, since Lady Quark specifically stated that this AI would be used as a weapon. However, this could end up coming back to haunt them if this version of Harley manages to complete its coding. Not only is it an ever-learning creation that will only get smarter as it continues to exist, but it&#39;s running on chaos energy manifested by Harley herself. This could lead to the AI generating hectic solutions that backfire on its creators, posing a threat to the multiverse as a whole.






 AI Harley Quinn Could Be Earth-48&#39;s Undoing 
          

Of course, it&#39;s easy to see that this is exactly where the character is heading based on its design alone. AI Harley is a terrifying creation, and making it into a weapon that harnesses Harley&#39;s chaotic energy is a recipe for disaster. It&#39;s the perfect way for Harley Quinn to explore the current controversies of AI while also giving her the creepiest redesign she&#39;s had in years as this technological threat truly takes shape.
