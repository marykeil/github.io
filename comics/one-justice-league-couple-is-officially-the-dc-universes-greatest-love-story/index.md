## Literature Review

The Justice League has had a lot of iconic romances, but as Green Arrow finally comes home, his reunion with Black Canary shows their immense love.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Arrow # 6!Out of all the couples in the Justice League, one love story is the greatest in the entire multiverse. No, it&#39;s not Superman and Lois Lane or even the Hawks, but a couple whose passion is as strong as ever as they reunite after the most trying experience of their lives.




In Green Arrow #6 by Joshua Williamson and Sean Izaakse, Oliver Queen continues to tumble through time and finally discovers the person responsible for keeping him apart from his family: His old nemesis Malcolm Merlyn. As the two fight in an endless void, Green Arrow&#39;s son Connor Hawke comes to his rescue.

          

Green Arrow finally makes it back to his proper time and the first person he sees is the love of his life, Black Canary. For the first time in months, the two embrace one another and kiss while Ollie&#39;s son remarks that there isn&#39;t a universe or timeline where Black Canary and Green Arrow aren&#39;t deeply in love.


 Green Arrow and Black Canary Are Finally Reunited 


          




While the rest of the Justice League returned, Green Arrow was lost during Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths. As his family scrambled to find him, Oliver was traveling all over time and space. He later revealed to Lian Harper that Team Arrow couldn&#39;t reunite because if they did, they would usher in one of the greatest disasters that would leave the Earth devastated. But that didn&#39;t stop Black Canary or Arsenal, who fought like hell to reclaim their loved ones, making deals and getting into fights with characters such as Peacemaker or Cheshire.

Green Arrow and Black Canary have had their troubles over the years, no doubt. But even as they were eras apart from one another, their love was as strong as ever. Dinah never gave up hope that Oliver was alive, no matter how impossible the odds seemed. While Green Arrow believed he was doing the right thing by keeping himself away from his family, it was tearing him up inside to stay away from his beloved &#39;pretty bird&#39;. The look on the two&#39;s faces as they reunite says it all about how strong their bond truly is. While there&#39;s plenty of love to be found in the Justice League, few relationships are as passionate as the one between Black Canary and Green Arrow.






 The Justice League&#39;s Best Couple Can Overcome Anything 
          

Black Canary and Green Arrow have had a more difficult relationship than most other couples in the Justice League. But despite the issues they&#39;ve had in the past, their time apart and subsequent reunion prove how much they truly love each other. Every decision they make now is to keep the person they love most safe, even at the cost of their own happiness. Thankfully this story had a good ending and Oliver was able to finally come home to Dinah. If any love story in the Justice League&#39;s history can be considered the greatest, it&#39;s definitely Green Arrow and Black Canary&#39;s.

Green Arrow #6 is on sale now from DC Comics.
