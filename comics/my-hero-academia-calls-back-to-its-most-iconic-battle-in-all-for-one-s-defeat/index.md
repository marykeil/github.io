# My Hero Academia Calls Back To Its Most Iconic Battle in All for One s Defeat


## SUMMARY 



  Victory over All for One was a team effort, highlighting the importance of collaboration in My Hero Academia.   Bakugo&#39;s acknowledgment of his teammates&#39; contributions shows his growth as a hero.   All for One&#39;s defeat resulted from a series of heroic actions, not just Bakugo&#39;s efforts, and it calls back to a great moment at the end of the Paranormal Liberation War.

## Literature Review

The end of My Hero Academia&#39;s big fight against All for One hearkens back to the series&#39; greatest moments, reminding fans this was a team effort.




Warning: Spoilers for My Hero Academia, Chapter #409My Hero Academia&#39;s greatest villain, All For One, has just been dealt a crippling blow that seems to have ended the fight, and the circumstances of his defeat are extremely similar to those at the end of another amazing battle in the series: The Paranormal Liberation War. The scene echoes the ending of the Paranormal Liberation War arc by emphasizing that this victory wasn&#39;t the work of one person, even if Bakugo dealt the finishing blow.




In chapter #409 of My Hero Academia, Bakugo is able to repel All For One&#39;s ultimate attack, leaving the villain utterly stunned. He attempts to work up the power to do so again, but fails, as the Quirks within him are no longer following his commands. Bakugo is able to deliver what&#39;s likely to be the final blow, at last bringing down history&#39;s greatest villain.

          

However, Bakugo acknowledges at the end of the chapter that he couldn&#39;t have done so alone, and that it was only thanks to the various opponents who had challenged All For One previously having weakened him enough that Bakugo could finish the job.


 Victory is Always a Team Effort in My Hero Academia 
          




In many ways, this is similar to how Gigantomachia was taken down in the final pages of the Paranormal Liberation War arc. Many heroes stood against Gigantomachia, including Midnight and Majestic, the kids of Class 1-A and 1-B, and Best Jeanist. It was only thanks to the efforts of everyone that Gigantomachia was finally brought down, a fact that radically altered the course of the battle and turned what would&#39;ve been a savage loss into a costly victory. The story took a moment to iterate this fact after the villain went down, emphasizing that no one person deserves credit for Gigantomachia&#39;s defeat.

The same applies here to All for One. All for One had already fought against Endeavor and Hawks&#39; team, Tokoyami&#39;s Dark Shadow backed by the students of Shiketsu High, Gigantomachia, Armored All Might, and Stain before finally going up against Bakugo. Each of those fights caused All for One to grow younger and younger due to the Rewind drug he took, and the younger he became, the more emotional he was. With his emotions in turmoil by the time he got to Bakugo, he no longer had the strength of will to keep his Quirks in line, and that&#39;s ultimately what led to his defeat. Just like with Gigantomachia, it was a long chain of heroic actions that led to this ultimate villain&#39;s defeat.






 All For One&#39;s Defeat Showcases The Growth Of Bakugo 
          

It&#39;s also impressive that Bakugo is able to admit this at the chapter&#39;s end, as he previously would&#39;ve been more than happy to take all the credit for All for One&#39;s defeat. Bakugo has grown into a real hero, one who can admit that he&#39;s benefited from the help of others. All for One has been a terrifying figure for over a hundred years, so seeing the villain finally defeated is a massively big deal. Had All for One been better able to control his emotions, he may have won out, but losing his cool ended up costing My Hero Academia&#39;s biggest villain everything.
