## Literature Review

One Piece revealed that an unseen battle, including Luffy&#39;s brother and secret member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, changed the world forever.




Warning: Spoilers For One Piece Manga #1100




Luffy&#39;s brother Ace made a big name for himself in One Piece&#39;s oceans before the Straw Hat captain set sail, and one big reason was an epic battle against a Warlord of the Sea that fans will likely never be able to see. The anime and manga have briefly alluded to Ace&#39;s adventures after leaving Dawn Island. Still, details of his exploits have been revealed in Sho Hinata&#39;s &#34;Ace&#39;s Story&#34; novels and in One Piece&#39;s manga chapter #1100, where he upset the balance of the pirate world.

In the past, Ace and Jimbei battled for five days straight until both were too exhausted to continue. However, One Piece #1100 revealed that the future Straw Hat helmsman was not the only Warlord of the Sea that Luffy&#39;s brother fought.

          

Elder Saint Saturn asked Kuma to become a Warlord of the Sea after Ace &#34;...recently knocked out one of the seven.&#34; The identity of the unnamed member of the Seven Warlords is a One Piece mystery that includes an epic battle that fans will likely never witness.





 Ace Defeated A Warlord Of The Sea Before Luffy Set Sail 
          

The fact that Ace&#39;s fight against a Warlord of the Sea isn&#39;t shown in the manga is a shame since it leads to many drastic changes in One Piece&#39;s world. The Warlords were all incredibly strong pirates that the World Government used to keep their idea of peace enforced. So, when Ace defeated the currently unrevealed Warlord, Kuma was quickly asked to fill the role so that the public&#39;s perception of the WG and their Seven Warlords would not be tarnished. A decision that would later see Kuma play a massive role in saving Luffy and the Straw Hats crew&#39;s lives at the Sabaody Archipelago.

If Kuma had not become a Warlord of the Sea, he wouldn&#39;t have been sent to Thriller Bark to confront Luffy. This confrontation led to the Straw Hats rescue and temporary disbandment in the following arc. In a way, Ace&#39;s battle against the Warlord proved to be a vital domino that would lead to his brother&#39;s rescue when he needed it most after punching a Celestial Dragon, which summoned Admiral Kizaru years before Luffy was ready to take him on. A victory that Ace would not survive to celebrate. Still, even after death, Ace&#39;s actions helped pave the way for his brother to become the King of the Pirates eventually.






 Egghead Is Full Of Epic Fights, But Ace Vs A Warlord Is Not One Of Them 
          

The Seven Warlords made a mark on the world and readers, especially when they confronted Luffy and his crew. Each had considerable abilities that were more than a challenge to overcome, a feat that both Luffy and Ace would accomplish in their teens. Battles against the Warlords were some of the best One Piece fights in the anime. Still, it&#39;s unlikely Ace&#39;s newly revealed confrontation with the secret Warlord will ever be animated in One Piece&#39;s Egghead arc. It&#39;s a shame since it was likely another epic bout that caused ripples in the series&#39; future events.
