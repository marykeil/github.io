## Literature Review

The repercussions of an untethered Green Lantern ring are wide-reaching and horrifying, as John Stewart is currently discovering in his newest story.





Summary

  The Radiant Dead corrupt Lantern Rings, severing their connection to the Central Battery.   Reverse-engineering Lantern Rings is now possible, making them available to other forces in the universe.   Possession of these inert Lantern Rings could lead to a deadly arms race and potential destruction of the DC Universe.  







In his struggle against the Revenant Queen and her Radiant Dead, Green Lantern John Stewart has just made the jump from being the universe&#39;s most powerful Green Lantern to the universe&#39;s most dangerous. Now equipped with a Lantern Ring powered by Genesis energy and his own will, John Stewart and Steel showcase just how potentially destructive reverse-engineering a Lantern Ring can be.

Green Lantern: War Journal #4 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Montos delivers a powerful revelation about the Radiant Dead: when they corrupt a Lantern, the Lantern&#39;s ring is severed from the central Lantern Battery instead of returning to the Corps. This gives John Stewart the idea of delivering one of these isolated rings to Steelworks in the hope of reverse-engineering it.

          




Terrifyingly, the process works: severed from its closed circuit, Steel is able to tap into the ring&#39;s machinery and power it with Genesis energy. Stewart then masters the ring with his own willpower, replacing his own corrupted ring and staving off the Radiant Dead&#39;s infection.

                  Soul Trek: Green Lantern Officially Names His Psychedelic New Healing Power   Time is of the essence for Green Lantern and when he needs to purge himself of a dangerous corruption, John Stewart embarks on his first ‘soul trek’.   


 The Green Lantern Ring Can Now Be Wielded By Anyone 
          

While Green Lantern rings — and the other rings powered by the emotional spectrum — are among the most powerful tools in the DC Universe, that power has always come with a major restriction: wielders must be selected by their respective Lantern Corps, ensuring that (for the most part) rings don&#39;t fall into the hands of unsuitable users. Furthermore, when a Green Lantern dies, their ring returns to the Central Battery or seeks a suitable bearer. While each Lantern Corps may have differing ideals as to what counts as &#34;suitable&#34; (Red and Yellow Lanterns are infamous for winding up in the hands of galactic terrorists), this link to the Central Battery ensures that all rings are accounted for and cannot be tampered with.




The Radiant Dead&#39;s corruption severs a ring&#39;s connection to its Central Battery, breaking this closed circuit. While this prevents the rings from being used by another Lantern, it means that Green Lantern rings can now be reverse-engineered by other forces in the universe (as demonstrated by Steel). While the process requires enormous power, there are numerous beings in the DC Universe who could meet those demands: for example, should Darkseid get his hand on these inert rings, it is theoretically possible for him to create his own Anti-Life Corps, which would surely mean the ultimate destruction of the DC Universe as fans know it.



 This Lantern Ring Could Be the DC Universe&#39;s Deadliest Weapon 
          

By proving it is possible to reverse-engineer one of the &#34;dead&#34; Lantern Rings, Steel may have inadvertently kicked off one of the deadliest arms races in the DC Universe. From the Dominators to the Weaponers of Qward — even the Star Conquerors — anyone who can get their hands on one of the Radiant Dead&#39;s inert rings holds the blueprint to one of the most dangerous weapons in all of DC history. Steel may have helped save Green Lantern John Stewart from the Radiant Dead&#39;s infection... but at a potentially universe-destroying cost.
