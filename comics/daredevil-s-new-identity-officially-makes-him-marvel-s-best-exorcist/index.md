## Literature Review

Following his death and resurrection, Daredevil&#39;s latest series has officially becoming the best exorcist that the Marvel Universe has to offer. 




Warning: Spoilers for Daredevil #4!




Daredevil is officially t​​​he ​best exorcist in the Marvel Universe. Ever since Daredevil served his time as the Hand of God in his trip to Hell, Matt Murdock has experienced a reincarnation in which he&#39;s literally living a whole new life as a priest. Living his new life has given him some new benefits and drawbacks.

Daredevil #4 – by Saladin Ahmed, German Peralta, Jesus Aburtov, and VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles – weighs the benefits and drawbacks of Matt&#39;s newfound ability to see demons, and to cast them out of possessed individuals. One of the shocks of the series has been Daredevil&#39;s changed relationship former friend, Ben Urich, who as it turns out, is demon-possessed.

          

Thankfully, as he did previously, Matt managed to successfully exorcise the demon from Ben Urich&#39;s body, saving his friend. Now that he is two for two in attempted exorcisms, Daredevil officially becomes the best exorcist that the Marvel Universe has to offer.





 Daredevil Saves Ben Urich With His New Exorcism Powers 
          

Earlier in the series, Matt Murdock&#39;s newfound priesthood comes with a brand-new upgrade to his super senses, empowering him to now be able to identify demons through their human hosts. He first uses this ability on his former Queen of the Fist Elektra when she is possessed by a devilish visitor. In his first attempt at giving an exorcism, he manages to exorcise the demon from Elektra&#39;s body. This would quick prove to not be his last. Daredevil #4 begins with Father Murdock &#34;meeting&#34; Ben Urich and at first sight, he sees a demon hovering over the reporter, controlling him.

The issue concludes with Daredevil presenting his holy cross to the affected host of the demon. He gives prayer, trying to get through to his former friend, all while the demon struggles, resisting expulsion. This ultimately proves to be futile for Ben Urich&#39;s demon, as Daredevil expels the demon from Ben&#39;s body, and the unwitting vessel collapses to the ground unconscious. Dating back to the first issue of this series, the first demon in his defeat promises that there will be &#34;others&#34; coming for Matt, and this sudden emergence of Ben&#39;s demon seems to capitalize on that promise. Still, this feat has made it clear Matt is now Marvel&#39;s go-to exorcist.






 More Demons Are Coming, But Daredevil Is Prepared 
          

It may be safe to say that this will not be the last demon that Daredevil will have to exorcise this series, but considering that he has successfully committed two exorcisms, it&#39;s also safe to say Daredevil is ready for whatever&#39;s coming to him. It&#39;s also safe to say that his time as a Catholic priest has redeemed himself in the eyes of Daredevil himself. Historically, Daredevil has always let Catholic guilt overwhelm him and what he does as a superhero, but as a Catholic priest and a master exorcist of demons, Daredevil is now legitimately doing the Lord&#39;s work.



Daredevil #4 is on sale from Marvel now.
