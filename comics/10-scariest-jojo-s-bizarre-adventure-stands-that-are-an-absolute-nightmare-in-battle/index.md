## Literature Review

While the series has memorable Stands that range from adorable to majestic, it also has some truly terrifying ones that act as nightmare fuel.




Since their introduction in Stardust Crusaders, Stands have represented some of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure&#39;s scariest threats. A manifestation of the user&#39;s &#34;fighting spirit,&#34; the term &#34;Stand&#34; comes from the way most of these figures appear standing beside the user.
Individuals can either be born with their Stands, such as in the case of the Joestar family, or they can awaken them through other means, such as the Arrow. These powers aren&#39;t limited to humans, as animals like Iggy and Coco Jumbo are shown to possess fairly powerful abilities. Since Stands represent one&#39;s psyche, their appearance and abilities will therefore reflect their users&#39; characteristics and they can take on both humanoid and irregular forms. Some of these beings are especially memorable for how terrifying they are, which brings into question just how dark the user&#39;s spirit must be.









 








 10  Milagroman - JoJolion 
User: Zeihei Nigatake
        

What makes Milagroman so scary is how it lures victims with a false sense of security. The Stand is a mysterious one that&#39;s said to have awakened after an arms dealer lost his fortune and killed his entire family. It can create and duplicate money, but when it targets someone, it will keep giving them money until they are crushed or suffocated by a mountain of cash. The only way to escape this &#34;curse&#34; is to return the money to the previous owner or to have it destroyed by a new person, therefore making them the new victim. The Stand will also continue to exist after the user&#39;s death.





 9  Limp Bizkit - Stone Ocean 
User: Sports Maxx
        

Limp Bizkit is a horrifying Stand that reanimates corpses into zombies and gives the newly undead heightened abilities. Since the stand lacks a physical appearance, the zombies are invisible, but they can be seen when coated in substances, such as blood. It&#39;s one of the few Stands in the series that persists after the user&#39;s death, but through an exception to the rule, can be controlled by its undead user, allowing them to speak and act like a living person. Limp Bizkit&#39;s appearance in Stone Ocean is something straight out of a horror movie, made even more disturbing by the fact that the user, Sports Maxx is even more violent in death than he was in life.





 8  Purple Haze - Golden Wind 
User: Pannacotta Fugo


 







Purple Haze&#39;s potential for destruction is so great that even its user is hesitant to use it. The Stand has three capsules on each hand that contain an incurable, flesh-eating virus capable of killing an adult human in 30 seconds. No one is safe from its effects, including Fugo himself, with whom the stand shares its erratic behavior and explosive temper. Purple Haze&#39;s violent nature makes it prone to fits of rage and obsessive cleanliness, causing it to let out a disturbing, guttural sound. While there are some limitations to its power, such as sunlight and the correct antibodies, it&#39;s still a horrifying Stand whose virus is still developing.
            
 
 JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventures&#39; 5 Deadliest Stands 
Stands in Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure can have a wide array of abilities, with some much stronger than others. Five Stands rise above the rest though.








 7  Cream - Stardust Crusaders 
User: Vanilla Ice
        

Cream&#39;s appearance is rightfully based on perceptions of the Grim Reaper. However, its true fear factor comes with its ability to swallow itself and create a portal into a void-like dimension. The Stand is dangerous to anyone within range, including its user, who only survives by being inside the void dimension. If this isn&#39;t scary enough, Cream is practically undetectable from the outside and can disintegrate everything into nothingness. In Stardust Crusaders, the group suffers the most losses when fighting Vanilla Ice, as Avdol is instantly sucked into the portal, and Iggy dies while protecting his friends from the void. Polnareff is only able to detect the portal by scattering sand and following its trail across the room.





 6  The Grateful Dead - Golden Wind 
User: Prosciutto


 







The Grateful Dead has a nightmare-inducing appearance with its multiple eyes and floating torso that forces it to walk using its hands. It also boasts a terrible ability that causes anyone within range to age rapidly depending on their body heat. This phenomenon extends to both the body and spirit, reducing the victim&#39;s cognitive abilities along with their physical functions. If used over a large area, the Stand will attack both friend and foe, making it especially dangerous for the user&#39;s allies. While the effects can be countered by the cold and other close-range stands, The Grateful Dead&#39;s abilities are terrifying in a world where aging is often regarded negatively.





 5  Rolling Stones - Golden Wind 
User: Scolippi
        

Unlike most other Stands, Rolling Stones is automatic and can&#39;t be controlled by its user. It&#39;s both cruel and merciful since it predicts the death of its target and relentlessly follows them, but also gives them the option to die peacefully. The Stand&#39;s most ruthless quality, however, is the way it shows the target exactly how they will die without telling them when it will happen. This fills the victim with dread and uncertainty about their eventual demise. In Golden Wind, the stone takes the form of Bucciarati, and unbeknownst to the group, also shows the deaths of Abacchio and Narancia. Since Rolling Stones is powered by fate, the target&#39;s death is unavoidable.





 4  Death Thirteen - Stardust Crusaders 
User: Mannish Boy
        

Death Thirteen attacks people in their dreams, making the Stand a literal nightmare. It&#39;s unique in the way that Death Thirteen only exists in dreams, luring in defenseless victims while the user, a baby, evades suspicion in the real world. When a living being falls asleep near the user, they are pulled into a world resembling a carnival, which Death Thirteen has full control of. It&#39;s worth noting that victims can&#39;t summon their Stands in this world and that any injuries they receive will be reflected in reality. As shown by Kakyoin, the only way to defeat it is to activate a Stand before falling asleep. However, this is difficult to do when the victim doesn&#39;t remember what happened.





 3  Jailhouse Lock - Stone Ocean 
User: Miuccia Miuller
        

Jailhouse Lock is activated on anyone who tries to escape from Green Dolphin Street Prison. Jailhouse Lock inflicts a form of psychological torture on its victims by only allowing them to retain three pieces of information and causing them to forget the previous information if presented with a fourth idea. While they keep their memories from before they were &#34;locked,&#34; victims will suffer from extreme memory loss that will eventually take away their ability to think. The &#34;rule of three&#34; extends to people as well, where they can only perceive three people at a time. The Stand&#39;s ability to trap targets in a mental prison, destroying them psychologically, makes it truly terrifying.
            
 
 Why JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Was Rebooted After Part 6 
JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure: Stone Ocean saw the original continuity of the series end and a brand new continuity begin, and here&#39;s why that happened.








 2  Wonder of U - JoJolion 
User: Tooru
        

A sentient Stand that acts independently from its user, Wonder of U is the very definition of doom. In JoJolion, it takes on a human form that lets Tooru live a double life. The Stand&#39;s main ability allows it to manipulate Calamity, which is an inescapable negative force. If someone shows pursuit towards the user, including an intention or desire to pursue, they will be affected by Calamity and doomed to misfortune. The Stand&#39;s ability can also activate on anyone who sees the back of its human form. Since it follows the rules of fate, the misfortunes suffered by the person depend on their karma. Once locked onto a target, Wonder of U turns even the universe against its victims.





 1  C-Moon/Made in Heaven - Stone Ocean 
User: Enrico Pucci


 







C-Moon and Made in Heaven are different forms of the Stand used by Enrico Pucci. C-Moon can manipulate the direction of gravitational pull and becomes more dangerous after evolving into Made in Heaven and gaining the ability to accelerate time using gravitational forces. Considered by Pucci as the final piece to achieving &#34;heaven,&#34; the Stand causes the universe to &#34;reset&#34; according to the cyclical time model. Reincarnated organisms in subsequent universes will have the same fate as their predecessors, as seen by Emporio Alnino, who is forced to live through multiple cycles of rebirth after losing everyone. The Stand erases Pucci from existence after he is defeated during the universe&#39;s reset, making it the most nightmarish Stand in JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure.
