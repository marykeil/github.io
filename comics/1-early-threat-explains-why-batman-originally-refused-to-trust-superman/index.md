# 1 Early Threat Explains Why Batman Originally Refused to Trust Superman


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s distrust of Superman stems from his fear of unchecked power, which leads him to test Superman&#39;s moral limits on killing.   Superman&#39;s loving upbringing and lack of significant trauma make him more willing to kill dangerous criminals like the Joker, which clashes with Batman&#39;s no-killing rule.   The conflict over the Joker&#39;s arrest and Superman&#39;s willingness to kill him strains the relationship between Batman and Superman, leading to Batman&#39;s stockpiling of anti-Kryptonian measures for protection.

## Literature Review

Batman and Superman have one of the greatest friendships in the DCU, but they didn&#39;t start out as friends. In fact, one early event almost ruined it.




While Superman and Batman have one of the best friendships in the DC Universe, that wasn&#39;t always the case. Batman is notoriously distrustful; when a man seemingly made of steel appears out of nowhere and has absolutely no oversight or counter-measure, it&#39;s expected for Batman to get a bit paranoid. But this paranoia eventually pushed Batman to test Superman&#39;s views on killing — by sending the Joker to Metropolis.




When Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents were gunned down in front of him in Crime Alley, he swore then and there to fight crime in whatever form it took. He also swore to never put anyone through the same pain he had gone through, no matter what. This was the start of Batman&#39;s infamous no-killing rule: no matter how bad the criminal was, Batman would not kill them. This is a rule that not only Batman follows, but he also holds everyone he works with to it as well. When the planet Krypton exploded, Superman&#39;s parents sent him to Earth, where he was taken care of by Martha and Jonathan Kent. Superman grew up in a loving home with caring parents and never suffered any significant trauma in his childhood. As such, while Superman avoids killing, he doesn&#39;t have any hard-set rules against it — and that is a major problem for Batman.


 Batman Tests Superman&#39;s Moral Limits 
          




One near-breaking point for Batman and Superman&#39;s friendship takes place in Adventures of Superman #14 by Max Landis, Jock, Lee Loughridge, and Wes Abbott. After the Joker shows up in Metropolis, Superman manages to quickly disarm his bombs and then apprehends the Clown Prince. While dealing with the Joker, Superman gives him absolutely no leeway. Not only does Superman brutally insult Joker, but he also refuses to take the Joker seriously. When the Joker starts raving about becoming more dangerous and finding a way to hurt Superman, Clark simply laughs it off and points out how stupid the Joker sounds. Superman does not give him any slack and even threatens to kill the Joker should he return to Metropolis. After the Joker is arrested, Superman visits Batman, and that&#39;s when things get much worse.

The Joker could not have left Gotham and gotten to Metropolis without Batman knowing. Superman accuses Bruce of such and is right. Batman intentionally allowed the Joker to go to Metropolis to see Superman’s stance on no-killing. Since Superman openly threatened to kill the Joker, Batman considers this a failed test and thus believes that the Man of Steel can&#39;t be trusted with his power. Superman, however, retorts that the Joker is dangerous, and he&#39;s only growing more dangerous. One cannot indulge the Joker&#39;s madness; the only way to deal with him is to shut his act down and remind him there will be harsh consequences for his actions. Batman doesn&#39;t agree, and after a heated exchange, the two go their separate ways, with Superman promising to kill the Joker if he encounters him again.






 Superman Does Not Like Being Tested 
          

While Superman and Batman&#39;s relationship would eventually get back on the right track, there&#39;s no doubt that one of the reasons Batman began stockpiling Kryptonite and other anti-Kryptonian measures was because of this conflict. In alternate universes like the world of Injustice, when Superman kills the Joker, the Kryptonian immediately tries to take over the world. The Joker&#39;s first encounter with Superman is what makes Batman distrust the Man of Steel — and perhaps he&#39;s right to do so.
