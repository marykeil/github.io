# “Flesh and Blood” DC Confirms Batmans Greatest Asset (Its Not His Weapons)


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s mortality is his greatest strength and motivates him to think outside the box to beat his enemies.   The Batman of Zur-En-Arrh lacks the risk of death, making him careless and less effective as a superhero.   Despite initial setbacks, Batman&#39;s grounding in mortality will ultimately lead him to victory over Zur-En-Arrh.

## Literature Review

Batman faces off with his toughest opponent, but Bruce Wayne’s greatest assets may ensure his victory (and it’s nothing in his utility belt).




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #141!All of Batman&#39;s gadgets and gizmos might be impressive, but they aren&#39;t the greatest asset he has to his name. After months of struggling, the Dark Knight is taking on his sinister backup personality, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. And despite the great challenge ahead of him, Bruce Wayne has one advantage that may ultimately spell victory for him.




In Batman #141 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jiminez, Batman has been taken hostage by the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, his dangerous backup personality. Now inhabiting Failsafe&#39;s robotic body, Zur-En-Arrh gives Bruce the chance to retire, but Bruce opts to end Zur-En-Arrh&#39;s reign of terror.

          

Batman manages to put some distance between himself and Zur-En-Arrh and formulates a plan of attack in his opponent&#39;s workshop. Bruce tricks Zur-En-Arrh into walking into the workshop and triggers an explosion. The Caped Crusader notes that Zur-En-Arrh may be invulnerable, but that makes him sloppy. Batman, however, is all too aware of his limitations as a human, which keeps Bruce cautious and ever-prepared.


 Batman&#39;s Mortality is What Makes Him Great at What He Does 
          




The last several months of Batman&#39;s life have been one high-octane thrill ride to the next. Ever since Batman returned from traveling the multiverse, he&#39;s been slowly influenced by the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, making him much more dangerous and unpredictable. After &#34;Gotham War&#34; came to an end, Bruce severed his ties to the Bat-Family and embarked on a new mission: To finally put a stop to the Joker. However, that adventure ended with Zur-En-Arrh assuming control of Batman&#39;s body. Bruce managed to get control back, but by the time he awoke, Zur-En-Arrh had transferred his consciousness to Failsafe&#39;s body.

There are a lot of things that make Batman an impressive hero. His preparation, his relentless determination, and, of course, his amazing cache of toys. But Zur-En-Arrh has all those same things. But now that Zur-En-Arrh is inhabiting a robotic body that is impervious to pain, damage, or potentially even death, he&#39;s lacking a fundamental part of who Batman is. Bruce has always been aware that so much as one bullet could end everything for him. But that knowledge has kept him grounded during his superhero career. Zur-En-Arrh may have the upper hand for now, but without the threat of mortality hanging over his head, Batman is bound to ultimately beat him.






 Zur-En-Arrh Lacks What Makes Batman Truly Effective 
          

Zur-E-Arrh might be ahead right now, but it doesn&#39;t make what Bruce said any less true. Batman&#39;s effectiveness only works when he has his mortality in the back of his mind. Without the risk of death, what incentive does Zur-En-Arrh have to be careful? Bruce thrives in dangerous situations and his will to survive motivates him to really think outside the box and come up with the most ingenious ways of beating his enemies. Yes, Bruce lost this battle to his more refined foe. But something like Zur-En-Arrh can&#39;t keep winning without having the thing that makes Batman truly special.

Batman #141 is on sale now from DC Comics.
