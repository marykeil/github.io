## Literature Review

Tony&#39;s new identity, as the Mysterium Man, will finally debut in Invincible Iron Man #16, as Stark takes the war against Orchis directly to Feilong. 




Tony Stark&#39;s newest era begins in just a few short weeks as Iron Man evolves further than ever before, donning the ultimate new Mark 72 armor and adopting the codename &#34;Mysterium Man,&#34; in Invincible Iron Man #16. Tony&#39;s secret war against his archenemy Feilong will finally reach a bombastic conclusion as the Mysterium Man uses his advanced mutant metal armor to take down the Stark Sentinels and strike back against Orchis.




Tony Stark has been pretending to be at rock bottom to evade Feilong&#39;s machinations, and will finally be able to fight back against the oppressive radioactive villain with his impressive new armor.


 

Invincible Iron Man #16, from writer Gerry Duggan with artists Juan Frigeri and Bryan Valenza, will see Tony Stark utilizing his new mysterium armor - seen above in a design page by Pepe Larraz - to take the battle directly to Feilong, using the Mark 72 to hit the villain where it hurts and hopefully take back control of the vast Stark Industries.


 Tony Stark&#39;s New Mysterium Armor Is His Most Evolved Form 
          




Tony Stark&#39;s iconic Iron Man armor has gone through incredible advancements and evolutions of technology since the Mark 1, built in a cave by Tony and Ho Yinsen, debuting in 1963&#39;s Tales of Suspense #39. Since the Mark 1, there have been at least 70 different variants of the Iron Man armor, with major upgrades related to space flight, stealth abilities, weapons systems, nanotechnology, and materials used to craft each suit. The new Mark 72, gorgeously designed by Pepe Larraz and brought to life on the cover for Invincible Iron Man #16 by Kael Ngu, is made entirely out of the mutant metal mysterium, the perfect suit to take on Feilong and his Sentinels.

Feilong, jealous of the otherworldly powers of Marvel&#39;s mutants, gave himself radioactive abilities while on the moon Phobos, which he has used to defeat Iron Man. Thankfully, mysterium is an incredible material - harvested by Krakoa&#39;s mutants from the cosmic White Hot Room - and one of its most important qualities is that it is incredibly resistant to radioactivity. This means that Tony Stark will be perfectly primed to take on Feilong, able to withstand his radioactive blasts, and then use the metal&#39;s incredible strength and resilience to battle Orchis&#39; army of Stark Sentinels, which have been terrorizing mutants on Earth for months now.






 Tony Stark&#39;s Marriage To Emma Frost Has Been Fruitful 
          

Tony Stark and Emma Frost&#39;s marriage has become surprisingly intimate, a surprise to some fans, but their marriage has always been one of convenience and access to resources. Tony would have never even heard about mysterium if not for Emma, and it is his partnership with the X-Men leader that allowed him to access a stash of mysterium on Krakoa and an even larger amount of it on Gameworld. Besides Frost, Tony has also relied on his friendships with Ironheart and Starfox to create a fleet of mysterium ships to use in his battle against Orchis, and will soon work with the X-Men innovator Forge to create his mysterium armor.

As the X-Men&#39;s Fall of the House of X begins, and Orchis&#39; attention is elsewhere, Stark will have the perfect opportunity to take on Feilong without too many distractions. Tony Stark has always been an impressive inventor, evolving his Iron Man armor time and time again over the years, but his newest evolution into the Mysterium Man may be his most iconic evolution yet.
