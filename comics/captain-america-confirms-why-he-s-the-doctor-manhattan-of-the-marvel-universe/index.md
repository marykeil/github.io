# Captain America Confirms Why He s the Doctor Manhattan of the Marvel Universe


## SUMMARY 



  Captain America and Watchmen&#39;s Doctor Manhattan share a similar perception of time, experiencing past, present, and future simultaneously.   Steve Rogers describes his temporal perspective in a way that mirrors Doctor Manhattan&#39;s in Watchmen, giving insight into Cap as an individual.   Both Captain America and Doctor Manhattan&#39;s disconnection from normal time perception helps explain their struggles to connect with others – but Cap resists succumbing to the inaction exhibited by Manhattan.

## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s Captain America #3 draws a surprising parallel between the time displaced title character Doctor Manhattan from Alan Moore&#39;s Watchmen.




Warning: Spoilers for Captain America #3!




The latest issue of J. Michael Straczynski&#39;s Captain America run for Marvel draws a fascinating parallel between Watchmen&#39;s Doctor Manhattan and Steve Rogers. Readers of Watchmen, by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons, will recall that Doctor Manhattan experiences time all at once. His past, present, and future all happen congruently to each other as far as he is concerned. As it turns out, the time-displaced Cap shares a similar temporal perspective.

Captain America #3 – by J. Michael Straczynski, Jesus Saiz, Lan Medina, Matt Hollingsworth, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna – suggests that Steve Rogers, having time-traveled in his own unique fashion, experiences time in a less-than-linear way. Captain America has always been portrayed as a man out of time, but the narration he provides in this issue makes that parallel even more apparent.

          




The way that Steve describes his perception of time in this issue is eerily similar to how Doctor Manhattan describes his own perception of time in Watchmen. The precise nature of their temporal experiences may be different, but the overlap provides fascinating insight into Cap as an individual.

                  Captain America&#39;s Best Weapon Isn&#39;t His Shield   As impressive as Captain America&#39;s shield is, he has even better weapon, strong enough to bring down the X-Men&#39;s most formidable adversary.   


 Captain America Experiences Time In An Idiosyncratic Way 
          

Watchmen established that ever since acquiring his powers, Doctor Manhattan&#39;s understanding of time was not linear. Instead, he perceived the entirety of his past, present, and future as happening simultaneously. After the JFK assassination, his partner at the time, Janey, asked Manhattan why he didn&#39;t prevent it from happening if he knew it was going to happen. He replied that he couldn&#39;t prevent the future when the future is already happening to him. Throughout the series, Manhattan expressed how he experiences moments from years past at the same time as those that are happening in future years, and in the present.




Steve Rogers expresses something similar in Captain America #3. The book opens with Steve explaining how being born in a different time period, only to be frozen for decades, gave him a new perspective on time. Borrowing ideas from Iron Man, Bruce Banner, and Thor, he says that time doesn&#39;t exactly exist, so much as the perception of time exists. In his perception, he recalls being born, dying, and being injected with Super Soldier serum all at the same time. He concludes that all of his experiences are happening at the same moment, &#34;we just can&#39;t see it. Or at most, we sense only the echoes of those moments.&#34;



 Captain America And Doctor Manhattan Share The Same Disconnect 
         

Both series showcase how Captain America and Doctor Manhattan experience time very similarly, though they relate their experiences in different ways, and consequently, are motivated by it differently. Neither man can truly comprehend how time passes, because they are so time-displaced. For Doctor Manhattan, his perspective of time disconnects him from those around him. Captain America has admirably refused to succumb to the same ennui. By the same sword, this connection between the two characters helps readers to makes sense of how and why, over the years, Captain America has struggled to connect with modern society in his own way.






Captain America #3 is on sale from Marvel now.
