## Literature Review

Mace Windu is about to return to Star Wars canon in an all-new storyline, one that - based on a preview - looks a lot like Andor&#39;s prison break arc. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars: Revelations Upon his debut, Mace Windu was one of the more badass additions to Star Wars canon, not just because he was played by Samuel L. Jackson, but because of the unique color of his lightsaber blade, which was eventually explained to be an indicator of a Jedi who can tap into both the light and dark sides of the Force. And now, his badass reputation is becoming even more pronounced, as Mace Windu is returning to Star Wars in an Andor-style prison break storyline (ahead of Mace Windu&#39;s official comeback in a new Star Wars series).




In a preview shared by StarWars.com for Star Wars: Revelations, fans got a sneak peek at every storyline featured in this anthology book, including one titled Mace Windu: “Showdown At Ocean’s Deep” by Marc Bernardin and Chriscross. This one-page preview gives very little away, but what it does show is incredibly telling.

          

Mace Windu has gone undercover as a guard to bust someone out of prison, with his one line of dialogue indicating that there is also conflict with the prison’s warden themself. While this setup may or may not lead to a prison-wide escape sequence like the one shown in Andor, the setting alone is enough to draw a comparison.


 Mace Windu’s New Star Wars Story Is Reinforcing His Well-Established Badass Nature 
          




Mace Windu made his debut in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, and played an integral role throughout the entire prequel trilogy as well as in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Windu would meet his end in Episode III, when he was betrayed by Anakin Skywalker and ultimately killed by Sheev Palpatine, effectively becoming the final stage in Anakin’s fall to the dark side and his rise as Darth Vader.

Aside from his importance in Anakin Skywalker’s Star Wars journey, Mace Windu has a long history in Star Wars lore in his own right. For instance, his aforementioned purple-bladed lightsaber was earned through Mace’s mastery of a technique called Vaapad, which essentially redirects the dark side energy used by an opponent back at them. Plus, Mace Windu had no shortage of Jedi missions across the galaxy during his youth - he was a Jedi Master, after all. And now, one of them is going to be featured in an all-new comic series that will mirror what is perhaps the most successful Star Wars story in recent years: Andor.






 Star Wars Effectively Merging Mace Windu With Andor Is Sure To Be Epic 
          

While almost nothing is known about the specifics of this new comic, it can be confidently asserted that it will take place before/during the prequel era in Star Wars canon (in other words, it won’t retcon Mace Windu’s death in Episode III), and it has something to do with a prison break. The latter plot point in particular indicates this story will be similar to the ‘prison break’ arc in Andor, not just because of the prison break itself, but because of the very nature of the prison Mace Windu is trying to break someone out of. Like in Andor, this prison has very few guards, relying instead on the secure facility itself to keep inmates in-line. While this may seem terrifying, isolating, and inhumane, the lack of physical personnel will assuredly work to the advantage of a Jedi Master like Mace Windu.




Having Mace Windu’s first new Star Wars story in decades mirror one of the most popular Star Wars storylines in recent memory is a brilliant move by the creative minds behind this comic as well as by Marvel Comics as the publisher, as an Andor-style prison break is the perfect way for a badass like Mace Windu to reenter Star Wars canon.

Star Wars: Revelations #1 by Marvel Comics is available December 20, 2023.
