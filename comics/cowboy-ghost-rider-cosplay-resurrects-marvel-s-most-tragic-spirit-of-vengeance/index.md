## Literature Review

This badass cowboy Ghost Rider cosplay resurrects Marvel&#39;s most tragic embodiment of the spirit of vengeance, complete with his flaming stallion.




This iconic cowboy Ghost Rider cosplay is a tribute to one of the Marvel character&#39;s most legendary comic book storylines. Seeing this badass character brought to life in such an astonishing cosplay strongly emphasizes the potential for Marvel to feature a cowboy Ghost Rider on the silver screen, complete with the Spirit of Vengence&#39;s flaming stallion.




Kode Abdo (@bosslogic) shared his phenomenal Ghost Rider cosplay on Instagram, showcasing a wild-west inclined Spirit of Vengeance sitting astride his flaming stallion as it rears up onto its two hind legs. The sinister and shadowy forest background further enriches the extraordinary atmosphere of this portrayal.


 

Abdo&#39;s post was accompanied by a succinct, yet ultimately fitting caption comprising four emojis – depicting a cowboy, skull, flames, and horse, respectively – which aptly encapsulating the essence of this remarkable cosplay. Fans will surely be blown away by this incredible Ghost Rider build, one that without question supersedes Nicholas Cage’s portrayal of the character.

This extraordinary cosplay highlights an unparalleled demonstration of visual editing artistry, elevating it to a truly magnificent level. Every detail – from the fiery stallion to the equally incandescent rider –coalesces into a genuine masterpiece. The sheer excellence of this portrayal is so advanced that it resembles a movie still, for an anticipated wild west-themed Ghost Rider film. While fans will have to content themselves with the western version of the character depicted in Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears, the comic series that cosplayer Kode Abdo draws his inspiration from; after seeking out, or revisiting, the series, fans will have an even greater appreciation for Abdo&#39;s fidelity to the design.

The vast Marvel Universe has been home to numerous Ghost Riders, all empowered by the Spirit of Vengeance, often recognized for their fiery vehicles. However, this skilled cosplayer has revitalized one of Marvel’s lesser-known Ghost Riders, Caleb, distinguished by his mode of transportation – a blazing horse instead of the traditional car or motorcycle. Caleb stands out not only for his fiery steed and possession of standard Ghost Rider powers, but also for his unique ability to possess the living, and traverse between dimensions. Hence, Abdo&#39;s cosplay gets even cooler when considering the canon material that served as its inspiration.






 Kode Abdo Pays Tribute An All-Time Ghost Rider Comic 


          





Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears – by the creative duo of Garth Ennis and Clayton Crain – was published in 2007.




This compelling cosplay serves as a heartfelt tribute to the revered comic book series Ghost Rider: Trail of Tears, hailed as one of the best Ghost Rider storylines. Renowned for its distinctive Western influences and notably tragic backstories, the series delves into the genesis of Caleb, the horse-riding Spirit of Vengeance, unraveling his deeply moving transformation. Abdo&#39;s portrayal reveres this exceptional storyline and sheds light on its lesser-known yet captivating narrative. His cosplay also serves as a poignant reminder of often-overlooked yet compelling storylines, encouraging audiences to explore and appreciate these hidden Ghost Rider gems that often get overshadowed by more prominent or movie-featured narratives.
