## Literature Review

A surprising source — and an encounter with Deadman — reveals the surprising fate of the Flying Graysons, forever changing Nightwing&#39;s origin.





Summary

  Nightwing&#39;s parents, the Flying Graysons, make a heartwarming posthumous appearance and express their pride in their son.   The inclusion of Deadman allows for the Flying Graysons to make an appearance and provides closure for neglected characters.   Nightwing&#39;s parents have never left him and continue to watch over him, giving their blessing to his superhero career.  







Nightwing is one of contemporary DC&#39;s biggest players, but his origins receive relatively little attention. Thankfully, a team-up with the surprise duo of Scooby-Doo and Deadman directly acknowledges the Flying Graysons and gives them a heartwarming posthumous moment with their son.

In The Batman &amp; Scooby-Doo Mysteries #1 by Sholly Fisch, Dario Brizuela, and Franco Riesco, Nightwing returns to Haly&#39;s Circus alongside Scooby and the gang to solve the mystery of why Deadman seems to be haunting the circus&#39; acrobats. The &#34;ghost&#34; is quickly proven to be a fraud, but the real Deadman pops in to show that he&#39;s been watching events the entire time, and he&#39;s not alone: he is accompanied by the Flying Graysons&#39; spirits, who reveal that they have been keeping an eye on their son from the afterlife.

          




As Deadman expresses relief at having his name cleared, Nightwing&#39;s parents add that being unable to speak to or be seen by their son &#34;doesn&#39;t stop us from watching over [him]. Or from being proud of him.&#34;

                  Nightwing Just Became Worthy of His Own Green Lantern Ring   Nightwing has been through a lot of scary moments in his life, but the fear he just overcame proves that he&#39;s ready to be a Green Lantern.   


 Nightwing&#39;s Parents Have Never Left Him 
          

While the deaths of Thomas and Martha Wayne have been explored extensively, it&#39;s often overlooked that Nightwing practically shares Batman&#39;s origin: his parents were slain in 1940&#39;s Detective Comics #38 (by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson) after Haly&#39;s Circus refused to pay protection money to mobster Tony Zucco. While Nightwing&#39;s quest to bring Zucco to justice has played a major role in shaping his career as a superhero, his parents themselves rarely appear (whether by flashback or by narrative contrivance) to express their opinions on his actions; by contrast, Batman has had many opportunities to present his mea culpas before his deceased parents.




The narrative inclusion of Deadman is a particularly clever way to allow the Flying Graysons to make an appearance. As a circus performer himself, it makes sense that Boston&#39;s death and subsequent spectral return would be a known legend among DC&#39;s circus population (thereby setting up the Scooby-Doo mystery); likewise, it is not a stretch to see how the spirit of one deceased circus performer might reach out to the spirits of other circus folk, as this issue implies that Deadman and the Flying Graysons are familiar with one another. Tragically, with Deadman passing into the afterlife in DC&#39;s recent Knight Terrors event, one of the last remaining links the Graysons have to the land of the living has (apparently) been severed.



 The Flying Graysons Are Unequivocally Proud Of Nightwing 
          

Regardless, Nightwing&#39;s parents giving their son their blessing is a heartwarming moment that provides a sense of closure for two long-neglected characters. Nightwing is now a major role model in the DC Universe; he has given his parents every reason to be proud. With Tony Zucco at the center of the Dick&#39;s problems once more in the ongoing Nightwing title, it seems that Nightwing&#39;s parents are on the cusp of getting the sendoff they have long deserved — and Deadman and Scooby-Doo finally giving them a chance to speak makes the moment even sweeter.
