# 1 Superman Power Could Drain His Other Abilities if He Used it Too Much


## SUMMARY 



  Superman&#39;s heat vision, while a powerful ability, drains his solar battery quickly, rendering him powerless if overused.   Superman&#39;s power is not infinite; his abilities are fueled by the energy he absorbs from sunlight, and his reserve of stored solar energy can be burned through by overuse of his powers, especially heat vision.   Despite his god-like abilities, Superman is still mortal and has clear limitations, as shown in Action Comics #1058.

## Literature Review

Superman has many different powers, with many different applications – but overusing one particular power can potentially drain the others.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Action Comics #1058!




Superman has just about superpower conceivable, aside from perhaps telepathy – and even more impressively, his powers come with little to no downside, for the most part. The only power in Superman&#39;s arsenal that has a major drawback is heat vision; in fact, Superman recently revealed that if he ever went overboard using his heat vision, it would leave him entirely drained and helpless.

Action Comics #1058 – by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Rafa Sandoval, Matt Herms, and Dave Sharpe – finds the Man of Steel being attacked by someone who mimics his powers, and as a result, he is put on his back foot for the majority of the fight.



          

Eventually, Superman gets his bearings and manages to exploit his enemy&#39;s super-hearing weakness. Since the enemy is using Superman&#39;s powers, he knows how to exploit them. As it turns out, his two biggest weak points are super hearing and heat vision. Superman reveals that heat vision absolutely burns through his solar battery, meaning overuse of it renders him powerless.

There&#39;s no denying that Superman is one of the most powerful heroes ever created, and he owes all of that power to the yellow sun that Earth orbits. Funny as it might sound, Superman is similar to a plant, in that he&#39;s able to absorb and store the yellow sunlight inside his cells. This act supercharges him, allowing him to do the amazing things that he does – but because the energy he can store is finite, this means his power is finite too. If Superman exerts too much energy, he&#39;ll simply run out and be powerless. As Action Comics #1058 shows, nothing takes up more energy than heat vision.

Superman&#39;s heat vision is one of his most iconic, destructive abilities, able to easily obliterate just about anything he aims it at. This has led some fans to quyestion why Superman doesn&#39;t solve every problem with heat vision. After all, an army of Lex Luthor&#39;s robots isn&#39;t likely to last long after being hit by a beam as hot as the sun. Action Comics #1058 provides an explanation: heat vision has a huge weakness. It drains his solar battery faster than anything else. If Superman used a continuous blast of heat vision, he would quickly rendered himself powerless, and be an easy target for literally anyone.

Of course, Superman has died before, but readers have the tendency to look at him as indestructible and indefatigable, but Action Comics #1058 used the attack by a Superman duplicate to make it clear that the Man of Steel&#39;s powers do have clear limitations, and that his reserve of energy is not endless. It also explains why Superman only uses heat vision in controlled short bursts, because he has to be mindful of his energy resources. If Superman goes all out with his heat vision and doesn&#39;t take down his enemy, then he will lose the fight. This is why, despite how iconic heat vision is, it&#39;s also one of Superman&#39;s biggest weaknesses.
