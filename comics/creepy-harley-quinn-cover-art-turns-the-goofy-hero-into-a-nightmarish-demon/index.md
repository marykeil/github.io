## Literature Review

Harley Quinn has had some brave looks before, but a new variant cover gives her a frightening appearance that’s unsettling, but damn hardcore.




The jester look Harley Quinn had for so many years is back, but not in a way fans saw coming. A peak into next year&#39;s releases has revealed some killer variant covers, but none are as intense as one that gives Harley an unsettling, if not familiar look.




2023 is nearly up and solicitations are giving fans new comics to look forward to and new cover art to appreciate. In February, DC Comics will release Harley Quinn #37 by Tini Howard, Sweeney Boo and other artists. The issue comes with several variants by artists such as Erica Henderson, DaNi, and Jorge Fornes. Sebastian Fiumara also contributes a variant that looks like it could double as a metal album cover. Harley Quinn is shown hunched over, wielding her oversized wooden mallet. In addition to her usual red and black outfit, she&#39;s wearing a patchwork version of her jester hat. Harley Quinn also gives off a disturbing grin as she looks directly at the viewer.



          



  Harley Quinn #37   Release Date: 2/27/24   Writer: Tini Howard   Artist: Sweeney Boo and various   Cover Artist: Sweeney Boo and various   Variant Cover Artists: Jorge Fornes, DaNi, and Sebastian Fiumara   Plot: Honka honka! That nogoodnik Brother Eye has soured my reputation across the whole dang multiverse and it’s gonna take me, myself, and I to put things right. Join me, Tini, Sweeney, and a panoply of clown girl artist extraordinaires as we go across the clowniverse! If you don’t buy this comic then my lawyer P.P. Thompson is gonna sue you!!!! Plus: In 1999 two teenagers went into the woods with a video camera and my twin sister Erica Henderson came out of the woods with a comic book about me that’s got real four-quadrant appeal (I wanted ta make a pun usin’ a word for butts instead of appeal but the lady who’s forcing me to write these told me not to).  





 Harley Quinn&#39;s Classic Look Gets a Dark Reimagining 
          

Harley Quinn is a woman who loves switching up her look. Granted, she made a huge impression on comic book readers when she wore her iconic jester outfit for years, playing up the &#39;harlequin&#39; aspect of her name. However, ever since breaking out onto her own, Harley has experimented with her appearance dozens of times. While she&#39;s never abandoned her trademark red and black color scheme, she&#39;s always trying out daring, experimental costumes. From traditional superhero outfits to punk imagery and derby girl outfits, there&#39;s no look Harley won&#39;t try as long as it lets her express herself.

Black &#43; White &#43; Redder has seen Harley given several unconventional looks and this cover follows that trend. Lately, Harley&#39;s more or less abandoned her jester look ever since she left the Joker&#39;s side. And while this take on it isn&#39;t an exact recreation, it shows that she can still pull it off. Not only is it still a solid costume, but Harley makes her more clownish style look just as, if not as upsetting as the Joker. Harley&#39;s always been a lot more bubbly and easy-going than her demented and homicidal ex. But with just a few touches, she could easily look just as intimidating.






 Harley Quinn Can Be Terrifying When She Wants to Be 
          

When one thinks about Harley Quinn, words like &#39;zany&#39;, &#39;chaotic&#39;, or &#39;destructive&#39; may come to mind. But most may not think of Harley as particularly frightening. Even when she was more of a villain, she paled in comparison to the Joker (though to be fair, anyone would). But just because Harley isn&#39;t known for looking frightening as hell, doesn&#39;t mean she can&#39;t pull it off. As Fiumara&#39;s cover shows, with the right clothes and the perfect, soul-shaking look, Harley Quinn can make anyone&#39;s blood run cold.

Harley Quinn #37 will be available from DC Comics on February 27th, 2024.
