## Literature Review

When someone attacks Haly&#39;s Circus, the same place where his parents died, Nightwing steps in to protect the family he couldn&#39;t save as a child. 




Nightwing has a strong sense of justice and will always strive to right wrongs, wherever he sees them. A new crossover comic revealed that some crimes are more personal than others for the Hunk Wonder. When Haly&#39;s Circus, the traveling circus Dick Grayson was born into, comes under attack, Nightwing flies into action, even though another team of heroes is already investigating the crime.




The Batman &amp; Scooby-Doo! Mysteries is back in 2024 with a new run by Sholly Fisch, Dario Brizuela, and Franco Riesco. While the series is true to the Scooby-Doo spirit and runs heavy on the gags, the first issue has a lot of pathos for Nightwing, as a star trapeze artist&#39;s life is put in danger.



          

The Mystery Inc. crew is already there, hired by a ringmaster who believes the circus is being haunted – a problem much more in their wheelhouse than Nightwing&#39;s. The long-time DC hero winds up in the mix, however, as he tells Velma, &#34;I just don&#39;t like people threatening circuses.&#34;

                  Nightwing&#39;s Origin Is Transformed As DC Reveals His Parent&#39;s Final Fate   A surprising source — and an encounter with Deadman — reveals the surprising fate of the Flying Graysons, forever changing Nightwing&#39;s origin.   





 A Crime That Cuts to the Quick for Dick Grayson 
          

While the death of Batman&#39;s parents is the driving force behind his thirst for vengeance, it&#39;s worth remembering that Dick Grayson&#39;s parents were also murdered in front of him. A mafia gangster, Tony Zucco, was trying to extort protection money out of Haly&#39;s Circus, and when the ringmaster refused, Zucco&#39;s men tampered with the trapeze ropes. The Flying Graysons ended in tragedy, and only the coincidence that Bruce Wayne was at the circus that night allowed young Dick Grayson to rise to his great potential. Bruce saw the similarities in their childhood trauma, and decided to take on his first apprentice.

Robin, and later Nightwing, has dealt with Tony Zucco in various ways across the years, both highlighting Dick&#39;s similarities to his adoptive father, but also where the two differ. In the Pre-Crisis continuity, Batman and Robin recorded Zucco killing one of his henchmen, and used the evidence to turn him over to the police, following the letter of the law to make sure justice was served. In a fate that falls into a more morally grey area, in Batman: Dark Victory, a not-yet-Robin Dick Grayson hunts down Zucco and chases him through Gotham, giving the mafioso a fatal heart attack. In a particularly nightmarish turn, Zucco was reanimated in Blackest Night – alongside Dick&#39;s parents.






 No Matter Where Nightwing Goes, He Remembers Where He Came From 
          

While ghosts usually aren&#39;t real in Scooby-Doo stories, they do haunt the DC Universe. The issue reveals the Deadman who was destroying the circus to be an impostor, but the real Deadman makes a brief appearance at the end. Himself a trapeze artist who met a deadly fate, he brings along John and Mary Grayson for this visit. The Flying Graysons still watch over their son, and are proud of him for all the good he&#39;s done in the world. Nightwing may have risen above the doom and gloom of Bruce Wayne, but he&#39;s never forgotten where he came from, or those he wants to protect most.
