## Literature Review

The Justice League are set to meet one of the biggest icons in the Star Trek universe in a special new variant cover by Dan Mora.




The Justice League meets a Star Trek icon in a heart-warming variant cover. Since its launch, Batman/Superman: World’s Finest has featured a series of variant covers starring some of pop culture’s biggest icons, meeting Superman, Batman and other DC heroes. Now, for the series’ 25th issue, superstar artist Dan Mora has provided a variant starring none other than Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner.




DC has provided a look at Mora’s cover for Batman/Superman: World’s Finest #25, which will be written by Mark Waid and drawn by Mora. The cover, which is set during the Justice League’s “satellite era,” shows William Shatner in civilian clothes hanging out with the team. The rest of the League, including Superman, Wonder Woman and Green Arrow, surround a smiling Shatner, who is standing at the meeting table.

          

Most of the League seems happy to have Shatner among their ranks, although Green Arrow does not seem to approve.


 Captain Kirk is About to Embark on His Biggest Adventure Yet 
          




William Shatner is known to legions of fans around the world as Captain James T. Kirk, one of the skippers of the Enterprise. While best known for Star Trek, Shatner has starred in many other films and television shows, such as TJ Hooker and Rescue 911. Shatner has also written novels, including a series of well-received Star Trek books, and even traveled to low-Earth orbit aboard Blue Origin. Still going strong in his 90s, Shatner is now set for his greatest adventure: teaming up with the Justice League.

Shatner’s World’s Finest cameo comes on the heels of other celebrity appearances on the book’s cover. Previous variant covers have featured musicians such as Paul McCartney and Jack White, actor Nicolas Cage, as well as Superman superfan Jerry Seinfeld. Each of these covers, while not having any bearing on the story, are still lots of fun, which fits with the overall adventurous tone of World’s Finest. These covers have been well received by fans, ensuring more will be created in the future.




                  Star Trek Reveals Exactly How Many Starfleet Regulations Kirk Broke as Captain   In IDW&#39;s Star Trek: Defiant #5, Spock precisely quantified Captain Kirk&#39;s frequent insubordinations from his tenure as a Starfleet captain.   



 The Justice League Needs to Cross Over with Star Trek 
          

While Shatner just makes a cameo on the cover, the idea of Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise sharing an adventure with the Justice League is a promising one. There is a precedent, as IDW and DC have released Star Trek crossovers with Green Lantern and the Legion of Super-Heroes. Furthermore, the franchise has crossed over with the X-Men on two occasions. Star Trek icons such as Kirk, Spock and Uhura meeting the heroes of the Justice League could form the basis of an amazing story. For now, however, fans will have to settle for Dan Mora’s variant cover of Batman/Superman: World’s Finest #25.






Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #25 is on sale March 19th from DC Comics.
