## Literature Review

The X-Men have had tons of different rosters over the years, with its 90s team having iconic designs that cosplayers like these can&#39;t get enough of!




In Marvel Comics, the X-Men are astonishing mutant heroes who will always fight and defend a world that hates and fears them, with their 90s line-up being one of the most popular and influential versions of the team ever conceived. And now, in an incredible set of cosplay images, Wolverine, Cyclops, and the rest of the uncanny characters that make up the X-Men come to life in live-action looks the MCU needs to take note of!




Recently shared on social media via Instagram by each of the cosplayers tagged in the posts, these photos bring together Jubilee (@missnarcca), Gambit (@calebweekss), Jean Grey’s Phoenix (@amaliaaacat), Cyclops (@supermancfl), Wolverine (@saadleup), and Rogue (@paper.moon.cosplay), and give them homemade looks that truly impress.


 

Collectively dressing as other iconic comic book characters like Marvel’s Daredevil, Black Cat, Spider-Man 2099, and Gamora, as well as DC’s Batgirl, Catwoman, Nightwing, Supergirl, and so much more, this group of creative talents always find ways to pull off comic-accurate designs that are hands down some of the best in the cosplay community.

 The 90s Return in Epic Live-Action X-Men Cosplay Designs 

 

Kicking off a decade of fresh stories, new characters, epic events, and memorable moments with 1991’s X-Men #1 by Chris Claremont and Jim Lee, the team’s profile rose even higher with the 1992 premiere of X-Men: The Animated Series. Decked out in their now signature blue and yellow outfits while tweaking their existing designs ever so slightly to fit into a new era of storytelling, the X-Men have yet to have a proper silver screen adaptation of these looks, making these cosplay images must-see photos for fans waiting with bated breath for the MCU’s version of the characters.

Posing together for a photo shot by @worldofgwendana, this 90s-era X-Men squad immediately comes across as some of the most satisfying cosplay designs ever seen for each respective mutant hero. Dressed in the blue and yellow versions of their suits (save for Gambit’s spot-on jacketed look and the addition of Jean Grey’s red and gold Phoenix), Wolverine’s very Hugh Jackman-like Deadpool 3 costume design, Cyclops’ practically perfect custom threads, Jubilee’s totally tubular outfit, and Rogue’s badass full-body uniform all nail the look and feel of their comic counterparts in ways that are as professional-looking as they are uniquely their own.






 The X-Men&#39;s 90s Costumes Get the Cosplay Designs They Deserve 
          

The 90s versions of these iconic heroes will always have a special place in the hearts of nerds everywhere, making this particular set of images something fans can appreciate even more and made even better thanks to the high standards set by each and every cosplayer involved. The X-Men consistently update their looks with each passing decade and new iteration of the team, so hopefully, it won’t be long before this talented group of creators takes it upon themselves to bring to life another roster featuring Marvel’s best mutants.
