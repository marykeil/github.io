# It s Not Batman s Fault! - DC Explains the Real Reason Its Darkest Villains Flock to Gotham


## SUMMARY 



  Gotham City is a unique and dangerous place that attracts villains, who view it as the ultimate proving ground for crime and corruption.   The presence of Batman is not the sole reason why villains flock to Gotham; it is the city itself that draws them in.   The Penguin seeks to conquer Gotham City, and his alliance with a former love interest reveals the true nature of the city and its appeal to villains.

## Literature Review

Batman always gets flak for attracting the villains that plague his city nightly, but there&#39;s much more to why Gotham is a breeding ground for evil.




Spoilers for The Penguin #4!The place Batman calls home, Gotham City, is a cesspool of superstitious and cowardly criminals who would stop at nothing to leave their mark on a town that hides death and disaster around every corner. And now, as The Penguin returns to his wicked ways, he’s set his sights on the one city that’s managed to chew him up and spit him out, with the real reason why Gotham’s most vile villains flock to its streets finally revealed.




A city regarded as the most dangerous and dark place to live in the entire DC Universe, Gotham is known for its high crime and murder rates, collection of eclectic and thematic villains, corrupt governmental and judicial systems, and, of course, a bat problem that subjectively isn’t helping anyone.

          

And as Oswald Cobblepot aka The Penguin plans his latest scheme to take over the city, he proposes an alliance with one of his former loves and explains why Gotham is a magnet for people like him regardless of Batman’s existence there by simply calling the city out for what it is: “There is nothing like it.”

                  From Gotham to the Gallows: Batman Confronts a Dark Truth in the Face of Death   From Gotham&#39;s savior to public enemy number one, Batman confronts a dark truth on his way to the gallows (literally) in a new Detective Comics story.   





 Gotham City Is A Place That Villains Want To Conquer 
          

Telling readers why Gotham is such a hotbed for cruel and unusual people in The Penguin #4, by Tom King and Rafael de Latorre, Penguin’s reasoning is a sound one and is an idea that’s far more interesting the more it’s explored. Stating that “Every sin of man comes there to fester, then thrive,” Oswald goes on to compare Gotham to Las Vegas by saying, “This casino, this desert, with all its travesties and horrors, is but an ant shivering in the shadow of Gotham,” essentially reasoning that criminals flock to Gotham like it were a proving ground of crime and corruption, something that would still be happening whether Batman prowled its streets or not.

Being a place like nowhere else on Earth, including the notoriously corrupt and exclusive town that is Vegas, Penguin surmises that crime bosses and all-around bad people haven’t really conquered anywhere until they’ve conquered Gotham — lending credence to the idea of why there seem to be so many criminals in town by default. Using this logic, and contrary to a lot of talk surrounding Batman being at fault for the crazies that run around nightly, Gotham&#39;s creepy villain problem truly isn&#39;t the Caped Crusader’s fault since the city is considered by many to be the ultimate underworld destination where the evil and corrupt go to prove themselves.






 Batman Doesn&#39;t Attract Villains, Gotham City Does 
          

While it’s true that Batman’s presence protecting his city has been a big reason for a few of Gotham’s worst villains setting up shop in every dark alley and secret underground lair they can find — like the Clown Prince of Crime himself, the Joker, constantly wanting to destroy the city thanks to his unwavering obsession with making Batman’s life a living hell — most of the less insane street-level villains flock to town simply to try and tame a white whale not many have. The Penguin is poised to take Gotham City back from Batman, and unfortunately for the city, he won’t be the last to try.



The Penguin #4 is now available from DC Comics.
