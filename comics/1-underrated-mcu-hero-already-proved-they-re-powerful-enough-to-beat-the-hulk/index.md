# 1 Underrated MCU Hero Already Proved They re Powerful Enough to Beat the Hulk


## SUMMARY 



  Monica Rambeau, aka Photon, proved her superior strength by blowing a hole through a zombified Hulk with a single shot.   She possesses Hulk-killing power, as shown in Secret Wars, but that&#39;s not even close to the limit of her powers.   In her solo limited series, it is revealed that Monica has the power to collapse an entire universe, making her stronger than the Hulk on a cosmic scale.

## Literature Review

While this hero-in-question&#39;s still new to the MCU, and relatively underrated, they&#39;ve already proven to be more than capable of taking down the Hulk!




The Hulk is regarded as one of the strongest Marvel characters alive, in the MCU or otherwise. However, there’s one MCU hero who already proved to be even stronger than the founding Avenger when she literally blew a hole through one of his variants - and her power goes well beyond superiority in combat situations alone.




The hero in question is Monica Rambeau aka Photon (and Spectrum, and Captain Marvel), who may be new to the MCU scene, but whose history is extensive in Marvel Comics - and far more significant. Monica has been a member of the Avengers, the Ultimates, A-Force, and Strikeforce, effectively fighting within the most prominent superhero teams in the history of Marvel Comics.

         

While Photon’s influence has touched practically every corner of the Marvel Universe, there are clearly storylines in which she shines much brighter than others. One of those instances included the massive 2015 crossover event Secret Wars, during which she proved - with one impressive shot - to have Hulk-killing power.


 Monica Rambeau Can Beat The Hulk With One Shot 
          




In Secret Wars - A-Force #5 by Marguerite Bennett, G. Willow Wilson, and Jorge Molina, the iconic team of heroes including the likes of Captain Marvel, She-Hulk, Spider-Gwen, and Photon are taking on a horde of super-zombies, each one an undead version of a classic Marvel Comics character. One of these zombies is the Hulk, and Photon blasts a hole right through Hulk&#39;s body, dropping him with a single shot.

While this version of the Hulk obviously isn’t the original, he does possess most, if not all, of the original’s powers. This is made very clear in the multiple Marvel Zombies storylines, as these zombies retain their abilities even after joining the legions of the undead. That means this blast is still at a Hulk-killing level. But, if this issue isn’t convincing enough that Monica could take down the Jade Giant, then all one has to do is venture over to her solo limited series, where it is revealed that Photon has the power to collapse an entire universe.



 Monica Rambeau Is Stronger Than The Hulk On A Cosmic Scale 
          




Monica Rambeau: Photon is a five-part limited series by Eve L. Ewing and Luca Maresca detailing the Avenger’s most impactful chapter yet. Monica learns that she is strong enough to collapse the entire universe, as she’s sending ripples through space that are beginning to shatter reality. Even a Beyonder intervenes with the help of the Eternal Starfox, as this is something that could stretch even beyond their universe and into the multiverse. In the end, Monica learns to allow this energy to flow through her, something that comes naturally once she becomes fully aware of this immense power and how to channel it.

Monica Rambeau is strong enough on a cosmic scale to leave a Beyonder and an Eternal speechless, so even if she didn’t blow a hole through a zombified Hulk and dropped him like it was nothing, it’s still clear that she’s powerful enough to beat the Hulk any day (even if she is an underrated MCU character).
