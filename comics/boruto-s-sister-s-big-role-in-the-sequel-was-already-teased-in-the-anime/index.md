# Boruto s Sister s Big Role In The Sequel Was Already Teased In The Anime


## SUMMARY 



  Himawari&#39;s immunity to Kawaki&#39;s alternate reality may be due to her strong ties to her true brother Boruto and her still-unexplained secret power, as explored in the anime.   However, the reason could also be that Himawari&#39;s relationship with Kawaki is deeper and more complex than expected, as they bond over shared experiences and develop a strong emotional attachment, but this is only shown in the anime.   The Boruto anime provides important details and nuance to the characters and their relationships, filling in gaps that the manga cannot always explore.

## Literature Review

The Boruto anime features an exclusive episode that more effectively explains the power that Himawari has in Two Blue Vortex.




Boruto&#39;s sister Himawari appears to be partly immune to the alternate reality Kawaki created in Two Blue Vortex, and the reason for this may have been teased in an anime-only storyline. This isn&#39;t the first time that the anime has done a far better job at filling in important gaps than the manga, as when it showed Himawari&#39;s hidden strength more clearly and effectively.




At the end of the first part of Boruto, Naruto Next Generations, Kawaki manipulates Eida&#39;s Omnipotence power to create a world where he and Boruto switch roles. As a result, most characters are under the false impression that Boruto betrayed Konoha and killed Naruto, except for Sarada and Sumire who are somehow immune to the effects of Kawaki&#39;s manipulation of Omnipotence.

          

In the debut chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex, after the alternate reality has been in effect for three years, Himawari confesses to an amazed group of friends that there&#39;s a part of her that wants to help Boruto even though he ostensibly killed her father Naruto. She also mentions that the memories she has of him don&#39;t match with what eventually happened.


 Himawari and Kawaki Actually Have A Stronger Relationship in the Boruto Anime 
Their close ties, not shown in the manga, could explain why Himawari is not fully affected by Omnipotence.
          




Manga-only fans are convinced that Himawari&#39;s quasi-resilience to Kawaki&#39;s alternate reality has something to do with both her strong ties to her true brother and her still-unexplained secret power, which caused a reaction even from Daemon, Eida&#39;s younger and completely overpowered brother. However, the anime more fully explored what Daemon is reacting to based on Himawari&#39;s incredible exploits shown in early episodes. However, there could be a deeper, much more nuanced reason why Himawari sees through Eida and Kawaki&#39;s illusion,

Surprisingly, this is not based on her feelings for Boruto but rather for Kawaki, as shown in the anime. In episode #209 of Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, way before Kawaki&#39;s alternate reality is cast, Himawari and Kawaki bond over a wolf named Jaggy. Kawaki&#39;s rough exterior breaks throughout the course of his time with Himawari and Jaggy, causing him to do what he would never normally do. For Himawari, Kawaki becomes someone she can depend on and even find comfort with in times of great pain and sorrow. The anime even heavily suggests that Kawaki and Himawari&#39;s relationship continues after the episode ends, alluding to an even deeper and more complex emotional attachment for both of them.




          

Rather than explain Himawari&#39;s resilience to Omnipotence with her secret powers, it would be a much more powerful and nuanced image if Himawari did not currently see Boruto as a traitor because, before reality was changed, she never saw Kawaki as someone evil. Considering that Omnipotence switched the world&#39;s perception of Boruto and Kawaki, everyone who fears and distrusts Boruto now does so because they felt that way for Kawaki, especially after he allegedly killed the Hokage. Himawari, however, loved and trusted her adopted brother as much as her real one, which is what could have created a &#34;bug&#34; in the Omnipotence spell.

It&#39;s an interesting theory, and one that confirms that Boruto episodes should not be seen as mere filler because they often add details and nuance to the characters and their relationships, which the manga cannot always explore in depth.
