 Diana’s Most Criticized Costume Returns in Wonder Woman #7 
         

Details surrounding Diana&#39;s revived biker outfit remain scarce. The only confirmation thus far is that the outfit will be featured as a variant cover for the upcoming comic, leaving fans in suspense about whether Diana will actually don the attire within the comic&#39;s storyline. It will be a daring move on King and March&#39;s part if the costume gets featured in the narrative, as the 90s-era biker costume faced widespread disapproval in its initial debut. Fans and DC artists alike voiced their displeasure at the time, criticizing the design for deviating too far from Diana&#39;s iconic and beloved Wonder Woman costume.




Diana&#39;s biker costume holds historical significance as a product of the major status quo changes DC made to its flagship heroes in the &#39;90s. This era brought about significant alterations to characters&#39; narratives and costumes, with Diana, in particular, experiencing a pivotal shift. Losing the title of Wonder Woman to her rival Artemis of the Bana-Mighdall, Diana continued her crime-fighting endeavors without the iconic moniker and costume. Instead, she adopted a look featuring black boots, gloves, shorts, and a blue jacket. Decades later, the reappearance of Wonder Woman&#39;s biker outfit in Wonder Woman #7 is sparking curiosity and discussions among fans about the potential impact on the character&#39;s modern storyline.



 Wonder Woman’s Biker Outfit Would Look Better on Wonder Girl Donna Troy 


          

Critics argued that the biker look clashed with Diana&#39;s established costumes, transforming the Amazon princess into a street brawler rather than the regal figure she embodies. The controversial costume even abandoned the traditional blue, red, and gold colors synonymous with Wonder Woman&#39;s identity. The biker outfit would be a more fitting choice for Wonder Girl Donna Troy, who shares a closer aesthetic alignment with the style. Donna&#39;s costume, characterized by a black and white-starred, skin-tight look, mirrors the biker outfit featured in the variant cover. Hence, if any character should be reclaiming the &#39;90s biker look, it should be Wonder Girl rather than Wonder Woman.




Wonder Woman #7 will be available from DC Comics on March 19, 2024.
