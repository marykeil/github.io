## Literature Review

Jump Festa, the big year-end event of Shonen Jummp&#39;s publisher Shueisha, will stream for the second time internationally, now in English too.




Jump Festa, the big year-end event of Weekly Shonen Jump&#39;s publisher, Shueisha, will be streamed internationally for the second time in its long history, and now with simultaneous English interpretation. The event is usually highly anticipated by manga and anime fans because it&#39;s used by Shueisha to announce the biggest news of the upcoming year.




The publisher has unveiled the full program of the event, which will take place on December 16-17 from the Makuhari Messe venue in Chiba. All the hot series published on Shueisha&#39;s digital and paper platforms will be present, and fans are particularly excited about the news concerning Dandadan and its newly announced anime, My Hero Academia, and of course One Piece, which will close the event as usual.

          

More importantly, while this is the second year in a row that Jump Festa will be streamed internationally, this time there will be a a simultaneous English interpretation for the panels taking place on the main stage, “Jump Super Stage RED”.

The attention for the non-Japanese-speaking audience proves once again that Shueisha has become an international venture. The global success of series such as One Piece has clearly opened the doors of the international market, and it&#39;s safe to say that nowadays anime is truly a global phenomenon. However, fans&#39; eyes will be also on the least famous series that still don&#39;t have an anime adaptation, such as Sakamoto Days, and on those anime for whom a new season has still not been announced.

Manga and anime fans worldwide now have a chance to catch the latest news and most exciting announcements about their favorite series in real-time when Jump Festa 2024 will head directly into their streaming devices - with English translation - on December 16 and 17, 2023.
