# Dragon Ball s Beerus Has a Secret Weakness That Proves How Goku &amp; Vegeta Could Kill Him


## SUMMARY 



  Goku could have killed Beerus in the Buu arc by almost murdering the Supreme Kai, as their lives are linked.   Gods of Destruction can be wiped out, as seen in the Future Trunks arc, but Beerus and the Supreme Kai are still alive in the main timeline.   Beerus&#39;s weakness is known by only a few, but it&#39;s only a matter of time before someone changes the power dynamic in Dragon Ball Super.

## Literature Review

Beerus maybe Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Ultimate God of Destruction, but they can die thanks to one glaring weakness that Goku or Vegeta would never exploit.




Beerus, the God of Destruction in Dragon Ball Super, is one of the anime medium&#39;s most powerful characters, but the anime already revealed how to kill a Destroyer God, and it&#39;s surprisingly easy. Throughout Dragon Ball Super&#39;s intense arcs, Beerus consistently represented a level of strength for Goku and Vegeta to strive to overcome. Still, the Saiyans could easily kill the God of Destruction, and Goku almost did in Dragon Ball Z&#39;s Buu arc.




Dragon Ball Super&#39;s episode #55 shared some information the manga did not by revealing how to kill any universe&#39;s God of Destruction. Before Goku is summoned to meet Dragon Ball&#39;s Grand Zeno, the King of All, the angel Whis casually reveals how to kill Beerus, and the Destroyer is understandably not happy about it.


 

Before Goku was taken to visit the supreme ruler of the Dragon Ball&#39;s multiverse, Beerus expressed concern that the Omni-King may take any frustrations with Goku out on their universe&#39;s Supreme Kai. Whis then explains to Goku and the audience that if the Supreme Kai were to die, so would Beerus because the two&#39;s lives are linked. That being the case, Goku was incredibly close to killing Beerus before he was even introduced.





 Goku Almost Murdered Supreme Kai, Which Would Have Killed Beerus In The Buu Arc 

 

The Buu arc features some of Dragon Ball Z&#39;s most intense moments, like Majin Buu systematically killing almost every human on Earth and Majin Vegeta&#39;s rampage. Before Goku and Vegeta&#39;s epic rematch, the Supreme Kai attempted to intervene in their battle. With Babidi seeking to absorb the Saiyan&#39;s energy to resurrect Buu, the Kai saw no choice but to try and stop the fight Vegeta and fans had waited years to unfold. In one of Goku&#39;s most cold-blooded moments, he threatens to kill Supreme Kai with a charged energy blast until he gives in. Without knowing it, Goku almost prevented the entirety of the Dragon Ball Super series before it even began.

                  &#34;Not The Senzu Bean The Film Was&#34; - Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Super Hero Manga Review   The Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero manga&#39;s adaptation fails to hit the dynamic and emotional beats of the film or flesh out the story meaningfully.   




Beerus and his fellow Gods of Destruction are some of the most feared creatures across the multiverse, but that does not mean they have never been wiped out. The divisive Future Trunks arc witnessed the rouge Kai Zamasu wiping out all of the Kai&#39;s in his timeline, effectively killing every God of Destruction that would have stood in his way of executing his Zero Mortals Plan. However, Beerus or the Supreme Kai have yet to perish in the main Dragon Ball Super timeline, although that would be an exciting plot development for the series&#39; story to explore eventually.



 Only A Few People Know How To Kill Beerus...For Now 
          

Beerus was technically made canon in Dragon Ball Z when Toriyama revealed that the one who sealed Elder Kai in the Z sword was Beerus. Knowing that the death of the Kai would have been the end of the Destroyer God, it makes sense why the grouchy cat sealed the Universe 7 Kai over a disagreement. Whis trusts Goku with the information about Beerus&#39;s weakness because the Saiyan, obsessed with improving himself, would never destroy the weaker Supreme Kai to defeat the universe&#39;s Destroyer God. With such a rule in place, it&#39;s only a matter of time before the wrong person finds out and changes the status quo of Dragon Ball Super&#39;s power-level food chain once again.
