# Star Trek Reveals the Secret Behind the Most Important Fight of Picard s Life


## SUMMARY 



  In &#34;Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy #2,&#34; a comic book, Picard witnesses a student being bullied but chooses not to intervene, believing it&#39;s the bullied student&#39;s responsibility to handle the situation.   The comic book connects to the &#34;Tapestry&#34; episode of &#34;Star Trek: The Next Generation,&#34; suggesting that Picard&#39;s decision to help a friend in a fight may have been influenced by his earlier failure to protect a bullied student.   The inclusion of time travel in the &#34;Tapestry&#34; episode adds complexity to the theory, implying that Past Picard allowed himself to be stabbed in order to save Future Picard, potentially changing his motivations in the original brawl.

## Literature Review

Although explained in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode &#34;Tapestry,&#34; the Picard&#39;s Academy comic is adding more context to what happened.




Warning: Spoilers for Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy #2A Star Trek comic that takes place during Jean-Luc Picard&#39;s days at Starfleet Academy is dropping strong hints about why he would later fight in a random brawl that results in him getting stabbed in the heart. The story behind this fight was originally documented in Star Trek: The Next Generation TV show. The connection between the comic and The Next Generation episode is already on readers&#39; minds, since the comic&#39;s debut issue already introduced a character named Marta Zweller who only appeared in that one episode.




In Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy #2 by writer Sam Maggs, artist Ornella Greco, colorist Charlie Kirchoff, and letterer Jeff Eckleberry, Picard witnesses a student he doesn&#39;t know getting bullied during a party he didn&#39;t want to attend.

          

Instead of getting involved, Picard decides to wait and see what happens. In his mind, it&#39;s not his problem and the bullied kid needs to know how to learn how to handle things on his own.


 Picard&#39;s Actions Are Complicated By Time Travel 
          

The correlation between this event in the comics and the fight that a young Picard gets involved in during The Next Generation episode &#34;Tapestry&#34; is stunning. In &#34;Tapestry,&#34; it&#39;s revealed that, after graduating from Starfleet Academy, Picard once stood up for his fellow graduate Cortin Zweller when a game between Cortin and some aliens turned violent. During the altercation, one of the aliens stabbed Picard in the heart. Since Picard&#39;s Academy takes place before the stabbing and with the same characters, it&#39;s creating the impression that Picard could have felt compelled to jump in to help his friend Cortin after failing to stand up for that bullied student in the comic. Moreover, one of the comic&#39;s major themes is how Picard learns the importance of working with others. Since Picard fails to save the bullied student because he thinks he shouldn&#39;t depend on others, this is obviously a pivotal moment already.




However, the &#34;Tapestry&#34; episode is more complicated because Q later gets involved, bringing time travel into the mix and understandably adding some complications to this theory. In the episode, Picard is dying, and Q comes to Picard with a deal. He will let him survive if Picard changes the past so that he doesn&#39;t get stabbed in the heart. Picard, who is already embarrassed by that time in his life (in part because he laughed when he got stabbed), obliges. But in his new life, he&#39;s a low-ranking officer who never got far in his career because he never took any risks. When &#34;Future&#34; Picard restores the past and gets stabbed, he laughs like his past self did. It&#39;s therefore implied that &#34;Past&#34; Picard was laughing because he somehow knew what would happen in the future and therefore was aware that, in getting stabbed, that horrible alternate reality would never come to pass.

          




This implies that the real reason why Past Picard actually allowed himself to get stabbed was to save Future Picard and that he wasn&#39;t truly motivated by a desire to help his friend. If true, this also means that Picard may not have been compelled to save that friend because of what he failed to do at an earlier party either. That said, any story involving time travel is so complicated that anything is possible. Therefore, it&#39;s plausible that Picard could have truly been influenced to stand up for his friend in the episode &#34;Tapestry&#34; because of his failure to help a bullied kid at a party in Star Trek: Picard&#39;s Academy.
