## Literature Review

Batman&#39;s cape and cowl are an iconic part of his persona, with a new cosplay giving him a full face mask that his comic counterpart needs to wear!




Batman is a DC Comics superhero whose choice in crime-fighting attire has cemented him as one of the most badass-looking characters in the history of the comic book industry, with his bat motif helping to effectively scare the daylights out of criminals whenever they cross his path. And now, in a new cosplay, Batman gets the only addition to his wardrobe that could make him look even better than usual: a full-faced bat-cowl.




Recently shared on Instagram by @calebweekss, this isn’t the first time this creative talent has taken on the tall task of designing, creating, and wearing a cosplay based on DC’s most popular hero, with @calebweekss giving his followers more versions of the Batman character than what’s usually seen from a single cosplayer.


 

Dressing in a suit hailing from the video game world of Batman: Arkham Knight, a The Dark Knight Returns Batman costume, and even a design that brings Batman’s hard-to-recreate white eyes into the live-action space, @calebweekss is no slouch when it comes to bringing this character to life, with his latest design being no exception.

                  &#34;Freaking Real Life Action Figure&#34;: Batman Cosplay Nails the 1 Detail No Movie Ever Has   Batman&#39;s film look usually does a good job of adapting his character for the big screen, with one detail making its live-action debut in cosplay form!   





 Batman Needs To Start Wearing a Full Mask While Crime-Fighting 

 

Helping Batman to strike fear into the hearts of the superstitious and cowardly lot that plague his city on a nightly basis, The Dark Knight’s bat-themed cape and cowl are iconic elements of his comic book costume, giving him a terrifying silhouette and signature superhero look that are synonymous with fear and darkness. Yet other than when a specific situation calls for it or when a specially made batsuit implements it in its design, Batman is rarely seen wearing a full mask that covers his face while fighting crime, with this cosplay proving he needs to rethink that decision immediately.

Making a case for being one of the best alternate Batman cosplays out there, @calebweekss nails this custom look with a full face mask, a set of piercing red eyes, textured armored plating, and in an inspired yet controversial choice, no cape to speak of. By utilizing a full cowl for this costume, @calebweekss not only adds to the walking nightmare that is Batman but covers a glaring hole in Batman’s defenses by shoring up a vulnerable spot on his face that’s far easier to target than Batman lets on. Throw in a short clip that shows off this unique outfit in all its dark and mysterious glory, and @calebweekss proves Batman needs a new comic design featuring at least some of these unique cosplay additions.






 Batman Looks More Badass Than Ever With A Fully Masked Cowl 
          

As of now — and not counting Terry McGinnis’ full-body Batman Beyond batsuit — the only Batman to fully commit to wearing a mask that covered his entire face was Jace Fox’s New York City-based Caped Crusader, and even then, Jace ditched the look for the usual cut-out cowl design not long into his tenure as the city’s new protector. While it remains to be seen if Bats will ever update his look with a face mask similar to what @calebweekss has given him here, this proof of concept shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that Batman should have been using this character design from the start.
