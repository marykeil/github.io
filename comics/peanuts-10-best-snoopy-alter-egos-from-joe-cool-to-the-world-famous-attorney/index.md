## Literature Review

From an astronaut to the grinning Cheshire Beagle, Snoopy has had many alter egos in Peanuts history, but these remain his most popular.




Snoopy is one Peanuts character who lives on his own terms, marching to the beat of his own drum. He is unabashedly himself and has a very opinionated list of his likes and dislikes. One defining characteristic about Snoopy is his overactive imagination. He loves to picture himself as different personas. Some are grandiose, like his World-Famous Author alter ego, while others are more random, like Joe Cool.
Whatever kind of personality Snoopy has adopted, he always goes all in. When he imagines himself as an astronaut, Snoopy really imagines himself walking on the moon. Likewise, when Snoopy acts like a pirate, he even adopts a band of buccaneers.
            
 
 10 Funniest Peanuts Comics Starring Snoopy 
Snoopy has become a cultural icon over the years, thanks to his adventures in Charles Schulz&#39;s Peanuts. Here are ten of his funniest outings.












 








 10  Cheshire Beagle 
Debuted In 1967
        

Fans of Alice in Wonderland are well versed with the Cheshire Cat, a mischievous grinning feline who can disappear at will. What some may not know is that Snoopy himself has a Cheshire cat alter ego, except he is fittingly the Cheshire Beagle. From one beloved fictional character to another, the Cheshire Beagle&#39;s grin can cause his whole body to disappear with the exception of his mouth, just like the Cheshire Cat. Snoopy considers these abilities special tricks of his, using them to impress the Peanuts kids like Linus as well as his pal Woodstock.





 9  Head Beagle 
Debuted In 1970
        

The Head Beagle has the high honor of being ruler of all dogs. A dog as funny and kooky as Snoopy somehow manages to finagle a short-lived spot as the Head Beagle. He has the position for only a month, but it is still a huge deal for the pup. Like any ruler, the Head Beagle has some important responsibilities and duties, such as solving noteworthy disputes, delegating missions to fellow dogs, and doling out punishments to dogs who don&#39;t follow rules. While Snoopy has the position of Head Beagle for a very short time, the amount of respect, prestige, and fear he gets from other dogs makes this alter ego a likely favorite of Snoopy&#39;s.





 8  World-Famous Attorney 
Debuted In 1972


 







Snoopy is not always content with living a fantasy life filled with beng an astronaut or a Cheshire Beagle. As a result, he sometimes decides to embrace a more down-to-earth imaginary persona, such as an attorney. However, Snoopy is no low-rent, hum-drum attorney. Instead, he&#39;s a world-famous attorney. As an attorney, he dresses for the part, bringing a briefcase with him to his cases. While this pup has had many imaginary cases where he has defended Little Red Riding Hood, Peter Rabbit, and a scarecrow, he has had actual clients like Peppermint Patty and Linus as well. Snoopy always loses his cases, though, so the Peanuts gang is better off looking for alternative counsel.





 7  Blackbeagle 
Debuted In 1996
        

Blackbeard, the infamous British pirate, becomes Snoopy-fied in his alter ego Blackbeagle. The World-Famous Pirate, Blackbeagle is one of the personas Snoopy adopted later on in the Peanuts strip&#39;s history. As his pirate alter ego, he wears a bandanna and eyepatch with his trusty sidekick Woodstock sitting on his shoulder in place of the traditional parrot. However, Snoopy does not have a pirate crew of only two, rather he has a slew of fellow pirate birds that he refers to as his Scurvy Band.





 6  World-Famous Astronaut 
Debuted In 1969
        

Snoopy&#39;s World-Famous Astronaut persona sees him imagining being the first beagle on the moon. This alter ego first appeared in 1969, the year of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Given how many times there have been space missions since the 1960s, people underestimate the massive deal that going to the moon was back then. Snoopy and his alter ego being made during this time shows America&#39;s fascination with space and space exploration that was promoted by the space race and the Moon landing.





 5  Masked Marvel 
Debuted In 1967
        

Wearing a black Zorro-like mask and occasionally a cape, Snoopy becomes the Masked Marvel when he decides he wants to live as the best athlete. For instance, in the Masked Marvel&#39;s debut, Snoopy adopts the anonymous persona when he imagines himself to be the world-famous arm wrestling champion, just in time for a neighborhood competition against Lucy. Likewise, in a series of strips from the early &#39;80s, Snoopy resumes the Masked Marvel persona when he enters a golf tournament against Peppermint Patty. While a part of the comic strips, the Masked Marvel has also appeared in Peanuts specials such as You&#39;re the Greatest, Charlie Brown.





 4  World-Famous Author 
Debuted In 1965
        

Snoopy decided to embrace his creative side and create the persona of the World-Famous Author. Writing on his typewriter on top of his doghouse, all of his stories start the same with the same line: &#34;It was a dark and stormy night.&#34; However, he attached the &#34;World-Famous&#34; moniker a bit too hastily due to all publishers hating his work. As a result, the wannabe Hemingway has amassed a large collection of rejection letters. While the Peanuts gang has tried to give Snoopy&#39;s writings constructive criticism, he rarely ever entertains the suggestions.





 3  Easter Beagle 
Debuted In 1971


 







Appearing during the spring holidays, the Easter Beagle is a festive alter ego of Snoopy. The Easter Beagle is basically Snoopy&#39;s version of the Easter Bunny, bringing the Peanuts children painted eggs. With Woodstock as his assistant, the Easter Beagle is one of Snoopy&#39;s favored personas by the neighborhood kids, since he actually gives them gifts for a change. He is known for grand entrances that get more and more extravagant every year. He&#39;s even popped out of a giant Easter egg before.





 2  World War I Flying Ace 
Debuted In 1965
        

Prior to 1965, Snoopy would have alter egos that were only animals. However, that would all change thanks to the heroic Flying Ace. The World War I-era persona would make multiple appearances throughout the decades in both the comic strips and TV specials, with the Flying Ace segment in It&#39;s The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown being one of the most well known and highly regarded visuals from all the Peanuts specials. As the Flying Ace, Snoopy would engage in imaginary battles with his nemesis, the Red Baron.





 1  Joe Cool 
Debuted In 1971


 







In his wild imagination, Snoopy came up with his coolest persona ever: the appropirately-named Joe Cool, a hip James Dean/Fonzie-esque college student. He is perennially seen in sunglasses, like any cool person. Having his own digs, Joe Cool has his dorm room, which is, in reality, his doghouse. His dorm room even once had a guest, as seen when Linus moved into it after a fight with Lucy. Over the years, Joe Cool has been plastered all over Peanuts merchandise, making him one of Snoopy&#39;s most popular alter egos ever.
