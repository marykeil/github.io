# Iron Man s  Wolverine-Buster  Armor Is His Deadliest Anti-Hero Contingency Suit


## SUMMARY 



  Iron Man&#39;s Argonaut suit, made of Antarctic Vibranium, is a deadly counter to Wolverine&#39;s adamantium-laced body.   Antarctic Vibranium destabilizes adamantium, potentially beyond what Wolverine&#39;s healing factor can handle.   Tony Stark is aware of the suit&#39;s capabilities and would use it against Wolverine if necessary.

## Literature Review

Iron Man has a history of building armor to contend with heroes gone rogue, but his anti-adamantium suit is a particularly brutal countermeasure.




Iron Man and Wolverine are two of the most prolific heroes in the Marvel Universe, having saved the world, and their respective teams, countless times. There is hardly anyone that Tony can’t out-think, or Logan can’t out-fight. Yet, if pitted against each other, Iron Man’s lineup of Argonaut suits contains the perfect anti-Wolverine armor that guarantees his victory.




Amid the “Execute Program” story in Iron Man (Vol. 4) #12 – written by Daniel and Charles Knauf, with art by Patrick Zircher – Iron Man and several other heroes attempt to contend with Tony’s out-of-control Argonaut suits. Though he built them as a self-contained peacekeeping force, the suits do nothing to keep the peace after being hijacked, making Iron Man&#39;s engineering and skill the whole world&#39;s problem.



          

There are five suits in total, including the “Subterranean” Argonaut (also called the Digger or Model 32), which is made of Antarctic Vibranium. The material acts as a ruthlessly efficient counter to adamantium by destabilizing it. Tony didn’t design the suit to fight Wolverine, but it is nonetheless a deadly counter to his Adamantium-laced body.




                  Black Panther&#39;s New Claws Can Kill Wolverine in Seconds   As Black Panther rejoins Captain Marvel&#39;s new Avengers team, he&#39;s sporting claws which can cut through even adamantium like butter.   


 Iron Man’s Argonaut Armor Is A Serious Threat To Wolverine&#39;s Adamantium-Laced Skeleton 
          



Iron Man (Vol. 4) #12 was released in 2006.




Tony demonstrates Antarctic Vibranium&#39;s efficacy, as he and several other heroes attempt to stop his rogue sets of armor. One of the other five Argonaut suits, the “Battle Argonaut”, contains adamantium. As it continues to cause mayhem, Tony uses the Antarctic Vibranium Digger to bring it down. The effects are practically instant, and the Battle Argonaut suit is blown into pieces just by being near the Digger. The suit only contains an adamantium coating, far less than Wolverine’s body, so it doesn’t take a Stark-level genius to know what the material would do if used against Logan. It would possibly be beyond what his healing factor could handle.




Antarctic Vibranium works by causing vibrations strong enough to destabilize other metals, including the notoriously dense and powerful adamantium. Depending on the metal in question, it may become so unstable it turns into a liquid. Tony has a history of working with the material, as Stark Industries designed Misty Knight’s Antarctic Vibranium arm, meaning he is well aware of its effects. The Argonaut armor suits may have been designed as a peacekeeping force – unlike several of his other suits created to nullify specific enemies or rogue heroes – but it is difficult to imagine someone being more affected by the Subterranean suit than Wolverine.



 An Anti-Wolverine Suit Isn’t Necessary For Tony Stark 
          

Tony’s history of designing suits for seemingly every problem is well-documented and often invaluable, but it typically happens in response to an ongoing or expected threat. Wolverine is frequently an ally of the Avengers, and is even on the Avengers team with Tony when the Argonaut issues go down. There is serious tension between them, but nothing on the level that requires liquefication at the ready. Still, it is clear that Tony is aware of what his Subterranean suit can do to adamantium, and Logan by extension, as he uses the tactic on the Battle suit right away. If Wolverine ever makes a true enemy of Iron Man, he’ll be on the losing side.
