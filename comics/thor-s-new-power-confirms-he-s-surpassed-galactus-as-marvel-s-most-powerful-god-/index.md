## Literature Review

Thor has always been one of Marvel Comics&#39; strongest heroes, but his latest feat of strength proves that he&#39;s now also it&#39;s most powerful god.




Warning: SPOILERS for Avengers #8Since his earliest appearances, Thor has always proven himself to be one of Marvel Comics’ most powerful heroes. Even before his ascension to the throne of Asgard, the God of Thunder accomplished countless labors of strength and heroism. But the Odinson’s latest feat put’s Thor into a whole other league as one of Marvel’s most powerful entities of all – even more so than Galactus himself.




Avengers #8 by Jed McKay, C.F. Villa, Federico Blee, and VC’s Cory Petit finds many of the titular heroes, Thor included, trapped within personal mental hellscapes by their aptly name adversary, Nightmare. Prompted into revelation by the Scarlet Witch, Thor immediately begins forcing the nightmare to his will, much to his captor’s shock.

          

Harnessing all of his godly power, the Odinson frees himself and his fellow Avengers before bartering with Nightmare to return them to the waking world. And while this is a traditionally heroic achievement for the King of Asgard, it’s even more impressive considering that not even the Devourer of Worlds himself has been able to break free of Nightmare’s machinations on his own.

 Move Over, Galactus: Thor Is Marvel’s New God 
          

Thor’s incredible power levels are nothing new, but breaking free of Nightmare’s grasp is even more proof that Thor is one of the most powerful beings in the entire Marvel Comics universe. After all, in Marvel #4 by Kurt Busiek, Alex Ross, and Steve Darnall, finds Nightmare using his power to enthrall not just the Devourer of Worlds, but the Celestials, the Living Tribunal, and even Eternity himself. The fact that Thor was able to break free from the demon lord’s control with little more than a prompt from his Avengers teammate reinforces a notion that fans have already been seeing within recent issues of The Immortal Thor: the God of Thunder can essentially do anything he puts his mind to.

Since he’s claimed the throne of Asgard, Thor has accepted Odin’s All-Knowledge as his own Thor-Knowledge – a concept that seemingly goes hand-in-hand with the All-Power. In discussion with the X-Man, Storm, in The Immortal Thor #3 by Al Ewing, Martín Cóccolo, Matthew Wilison, and VC’s Joe Sabino, the Odinson says, “We are not measured by strength, nor raw power. The measure of us is what we do…when the need for action lies with us…” Ultimately, this was meant as a commentary on the constant power-scaling comparisons between Marvel’s heroes. But with his new Thor-Knowledge, and his feat against Nightmare, it&#39;s clear that Thor’s adaptability to any situation is exceedingly specific to him – and puts him above any other Marvel god.






 Thor Is The Mightiest God Of All 
          

As one of the Avengers’ heaviest hitters of all time, Thor is one of Marvel Comics’ most powerful heroes and always has been. But the Odinson’s ascension as the King of Asgard has clearly come with more than a few perks, including greater power than ever before. Nightmare’s dark magics may be effective against “lesser” gods like Galactus or the Celestials, but he’ll need to step up his game if he truly hopes to beat Marvel Comics’ Thor.
