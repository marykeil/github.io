## Literature Review

There is one long-time mutant character who should prove essential to Iron Man&#39;s current X-Men era –but he is on record as hating Tony Stark.




Between his marriage to a prominent member of the X-Men, Emma Frost, and their shared enemy in Orchis, Iron Man has become a closer ally to mutantkind than ever before – but one X-gene gifted individual who would seemingly make a natural ally for the tech genius billionaire is on record as hating Tony Stark.






Iron Man&#39;s &#34;X-Men-era&#34; has maneuvered the character into being a close ally of mutantkind without forcing him to fully commit to their cause; his marriage to Emma Frost has been part love-story, part comedy-of-errors, part marriage-of-convenience, and his support for mutants has come in large part out of his own necessity.




The Invincible Iron Man #14 – written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Juan Frigeri – will find newlyweds Tony and Emma Frost soliciting the help of mutant inventor Forge in their quest to defeat the villainous Feilong, a leading member of anti-mutant organization Orchis, who has also taken control of Stark Industries.



          

Forge&#39;s unique mutant abilities make him a seemingly obvious mutant ally for Iron Man. However, as readers have seen previously, there is tension between the pair – at least from Forge&#39;s side of the equation. This tension will make their upcoming interactions all the more exciting, and all the more vital to Iron Man&#39;s current arc.





 Forge Doesn&#39;t Just Hate Tony Stark – He &#34;Loathes&#34; Him 
Still, Even More Importantly, Forge Respects Iron Man
          



As a character, Forge presents Invincible Iron Man&#39;s creative team the opportunity to make Tony Stark confront his own motivations.




Forge&#39;s feelings about Tony Stark were verbalized in X-Men #23 – like the current Invincible Iron Man arc, written by Gerry Duggan; art by Joshua Cassara – during a confrontation with a new model of Sentinel, designed by Orchis using top-of-the-line Stark technology. Forge tells his team they need to approach the fight as if they are fighting &#34;a three-story Iron Man,&#34; adding that, &#34;as much as I loathe Tony Stark, the man&#39;s a genius.&#34; Given that Duggan planted the seed of this tension in the earlier story, it is exciting to see that it has the potential to bear fruit in the upcoming Invincible Iron Man #14.




Iron Man&#39;s &#34;X-Men-era&#34; has maneuvered the character into being a close ally of mutantkind without forcing him to fully commit to their cause; his marriage to Emma Frost has been part love-story, part comedy-of-errors, part marriage-of-convenience, and his support for mutants has come in large part out of his own necessity. As a character, Forge presents Invincible Iron Man&#39;s creative team the opportunity to make Tony Stark confront his own motivations. Overall, this could represent a pivotal moment in Tony&#39;s current arc – and give him the opportunity to truly become the ally the X-Men, and mutants everywhere, need him to be if they are to survive Orchis.



 Forge Can Truly Mold Iron Man Into A Member Of The X-Men 
If Tony Can Win His Respect, That Will Signal A Major Character Shift
         

If Tony can win his mutant peer&#39;s respect, it would be a major milestone for the character. In his recent appearances, Forge has been depicted as more powerful, and more confident, than ever before. He will not give his approval to Iron Man easily – nor will he let Tony Stark be at anything other than his best when it comes to working together, especially when it is more than for just Stark&#39;s benefit. Whatever their dynamic turns out to be, X-Men&#39;s Forge and Iron Man will be working together toward the salvation of all mutantkind, and the future of Earth as a whole.




The Invincible Iron Man #14 will be available January 3, 2024 from Marvel Comics.
