# Spider-Man Proves a Forgotten MCU Team are Marvel s Most Pathetic Villains


## SUMMARY 



  Spider-Man effortlessly defeats the low-level Tracksuit Mafia alongside Tombstone and She-Hulk in The Amazing Spider-Man #40.   The Tracksuit Mafia is a silly yet dangerous gang, known for their humor and brutal acts of violence.   The gang, originally associated with Hawkeye, is expanding beyond their previous encounters and becoming a threat to other Marvel street-level heroes.

## Literature Review

These MCU villains was always thought of as a joke, but their appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s Gang War story shows what pushovers they are.




Warning! Spoilers for The Amazing Spider-Man #40 ahead!Spider-Man has fought his share of deadly enemies and supervillains, but now and again he goes up against some seriously low-level mooks. Everyone is coming out of the woodwork for Marvel&#39;s Gang War event, including a pathetic but fan-favorite group last shown going up against Hawkeye in the MCU: The Tracksuit Mafia. Sorry, Clint and Kate, but Peter Parker shows off how easy it is to take these bros down.




Every villain in New York has stepped up to the plate to take a swing at gaining ground in the ongoing Gang War event. Diamondback has allied with Hydra, Madame Masque took out Hammerhead and took over the Maggia, and even Shang-Chi is breaking bread with mafia families as they redraw the map. It was only a matter of time before the Tracksuit Mafia showed up, ready to bro their way to the big time, and The Amazing Spider-Man #40, from creative team Zeb Wells, John Romita, Jr., Scott Hanna, and Marcio Menyz, delivers the goods.



          

Unfortunately, they got all dressed up for nothing, as Spider-Man, Tombstone, and She-Hulk very quickly take them out.

                  Hawkeye&#39;s History With The Tracksuit Mafia &amp; Echo   The Hawkeye Disney&#43; show includes new MCU villains, the Tracksuit Mafia - but who are they are what is there link to Clint Barton&#39;s past?   





 The Tracksuit Mafia Is a Silly But Dangerous Gang 
          

First appearing in Matt Fraction and David Aja&#39;s Hawkeye (2012), the Tracksuit Mafia is an Eastern European gang dealing in street crime and shakedowns for money. They come into conflict with Clint Barton because they&#39;re threatening people in his apartment building, tripling rents and stealing tenants&#39; belongings when they evict them. Their leader is Ivan Banionis, who owns the building and refuses Hawkeye&#39;s offer to buy it from him (with some hard-earned Avengers cash). They&#39;re never referred to by a real group name, but their uniform of red tracksuits prompts Hawkeye to call them &#34;The Tracksuit Mafia.&#34;

The group never refers to each other by names, choosing to call everyone &#34;bro.&#34; Between this and the tracksuits, it gives the members a level of anonymity, which shows off the gang&#39;s real strength: numbers. The Tracksuit Mafia is a fan-favorite due to the many funny aspects of the gang, and this humor sometimes makes them seem even more dangerous given the juxtaposition between comedy and violence. They seem incompetent, and they&#39;re very low-level, but they&#39;re armed and ruthless: in one of their first encounters, they shoot Hawkeye, who gets saved by a stray dog who bites them. They then kick the dog into the street where he gets hit by a car. The dog survives, being adopted by Clint and named &#34;Lucky,&#34; but it was a harrowing story when the villains were thought to just be some silly guys.






 The Tracksuit Mafia Is Expanding 


          

Since their creation, the Tracksuit Mafia has only ever appeared to harass Hawkeye. Showing up in a Spider-Man book during a major event suggests these bros have actually hit the big leagues. Their role as Wilson Fisk&#39;s operatives in the Hawkeye Disney&#43; series exposed them to an entirely new fanbase, who are excited to see this dumb little gang show up when they&#39;re least expected. She-Hulk fastball specials Spider-Man into the group, efficiently taking them out here, but they always regroup to rise again. If they&#39;ve been unleashed from only going up against Clint Barton and Kate Bishop, this hilarious team would be welcome with any Marvel street-level hero. As Spider-Man shows, these pathetic MCU villains can be an easy win on a good day.
