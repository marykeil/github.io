# Wolverine s Healing Factor Is Powerless Against 1 MCU Villain, Marvel Officially Confirms


## SUMMARY 



  Wolverine&#39;s daughter Laura Kinney is killed by the High Evolutionary, proving that even Wolverine&#39;s healing factor is no match for the villain&#39;s godlike technology.   Laura shares Wolverine&#39;s healing, but she&#39;s still killed with a gesture in X-Men #30.   The death matches Wolverine&#39;s limits as seen in other stories, and proves the High Evolutionary is way out of his league.

## Literature Review

While Wolverine has survived for over a century thanks to his incredible healing factor, he&#39;s not unbeatable - as a major MCU villain just proved.




Warning: contains spoilers for X-Men #30!While Wolverine has survived for over a century thanks to his incredible healing factor, he&#39;s not unbeatable, and Marvel just confirmed that one recent MCU villain can destroy him in seconds. Even more unfortunately, the villain in question has recently become a major thorn in the side of the X-Men, acting as a deadly wild card in their battle for survival.




In X-Men #30, Wolverine&#39;s daughter Talon (aka Laura Kinney) and the power-mimic Synch track down the High Evolutionary. While Herbert Wyndham (played in the MCU by Chukwudi Iwuji) has previously made overtures to mutantkind as a powerful ally, the X-Men dismissed him as an amoral despot. Sadly, when Talon and Synch encounter the villain, he&#39;s still angry over the snub, and incinerates Talon after forcing her to impale herself with her own claws.



          

Talon&#39;s healing factor is equal to her father&#39;s - indeed, she used the Wolverine codename herself for several years - showing that even Logan&#39;s powers mean nothing against the High Evolutionary&#39;s godlike technology. While Synch manages to store Talon&#39;s psychic imprint within his own mind, her body is utterly obliterated, leaving no clear way to bring her back to life - even as Synch begins to lose his grip on her essence.

 Wolverine&#39;s Healing Means Nothing to the High Evolutionary 
The MCU Villain Just Killed Wolverine&#39;s Daughter Talon
         

Not long ago, the High Evolutionary offered to gift the X-Men a powerful virus which would sterilize mankind. Obsessed with creating the perfect biological entity, Wyndham wanted to hasten mutantkind&#39;s ascension as Earth&#39;s dominant species. The X-Men turned down the gift and got the villain to leave Earth by giving him a single drop of Synch&#39;s blood. Now, however, the X-Men have discovered a new use for Wyndham&#39;s virus, intending to retrofit it to save human lives rather than end them. Unfortunately, the High Evolutionary is no longer in the giving mood - he allows Synch to leave with the virus, but only after taking Talon&#39;s life as &#39;payment.&#39;




It&#39;s a moment that&#39;s all the more terrifying because Wyndham&#39;s godlike power is totally self-made. Formerly a human scientist, the High Evolutionary has traveled through space and across dimensions to hone his expertise and craft. Having enhanced his body to post-human levels and devised a technological suit which allows him to manipulate others on the genetic level, the High Evolutionary is among Marvel&#39;s most powerful foes.

At this point, it&#39;s not clear exactly how he killed Talon, but there are two main possibilities. Either the High Evolutionary turned off Laura&#39;s X-gene - rendering her healing factor inert - or else he simply used advanced weaponry to totally incinerate her body (something that has worked on Wolverine several times in the past.) Wolverine&#39;s healing factor is granted by his bone marrow and circulated throughout his body in his blood - that means he can take a lot of damage and heal, but if he&#39;s burned away to nothing, he stays dead - and the same is true of his kids.

The Movies Also Removed High Evolutionary&#39;s Link to Multiple Hero Origins
         

Movie fans will be shocked to learn the High Evolutionary is so powerful, but the movies actually downgraded him in some extreme ways. The MCU&#39;s High Evolutionary lost a lot of the technology that makes him nearly unbeatable. The High Evolutionary&#39;s armor grants him a healing factor even Wolverine would envy, and can essentially grow him an entirely new body from scratch. He also possesses force fields and telekinesis that would shame Marvel&#39;s gods, as well as a range of other powers including flight, energy blasts, telepathy, and the ability to grow to a gigantic size. What&#39;s more, because of his constant research, the High Evolutionary is always growing more powerful - even as he transforms into an inhuman monster behind his &#39;perfect&#39; mask.






Despite starting life as a human, the High Evolutionary has become one of Marvel&#39;s &#39;Ascended&#39; - beings who operate on a godlike level. He is invited whenever the great powers of the cosmos convene, and has fought Galactus blow for blow in the past.




These experiments also make the High Evolutionary far more essential to Marvel lore than his appearance in Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 suggests. The High Evolutionary is the one who gave Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch their powers, turned Spider-Woman into a superhuman as a child, returned Magneto&#39;s powers after House of X, empowered Adam Warlock and created his &#39;sister&#39; Eve Warlock. He&#39;s also an old ally of Tony Stark&#39;s father Howard, who sought him out to help in the delivery of Tony&#39;s brother Arno.



 The High Evolutionary Might Be Marvel&#39;s Most Successful Villain 
The Avengers &amp; X-Men Have Failed to Stop High Evolutionary&#39;s Atrocities
         




Being able to beat Wolverine&#39;s healing factor with a gesture is the perfect expression of how powerful the High Evolutionary is, as well as how underrated he&#39;s become as a Marvel villain. Starting out as an enemy of Thor, the High Evolutionary often exists in the background of the Marvel Universe. Because of this, he&#39;s rarely faced true defeat. As X-Men #30 confirms, the High Evolutionary still uses Counter-Earth (a secret planet in Earth&#39;s solar system) to carry out planetary experiments, committing genocide against his creations whenever he wants to start over. While the Avengers or X-Men would suit up and take on any other villain who committed such atrocities, the High Evolutionary has proved all but unbeatable, and - as Talon&#39;s death proves - crossing him often comes with a body count.

Currently, the X-Men are in the fight of their lives against Orchis - an anti-mutant organization who intend to hand the Earth over to robotic life. The last thing they need is the High Evolutionary taking an interest in them at this crucial moment, and yet Wyndham has made it very clear he&#39;s more interested in Earth&#39;s mutants than ever. Fans still don&#39;t know what Wyndham did with Synch&#39;s blood, and his murder of Wolverine&#39;s daughter Talon makes it clear that before the current era of X-Men is done, the mutant heroes are due a final reckoning with the High Evolutionary.




X-Men #30 is available now from Marvel Comics.
