## Literature Review

As Flash unlocks the ability to &#39;step out&#39; of reality, he discovers that he can rewrite the laws of physics on a whim, surpassing even Superman.




Warning: contains spoilers for Flash #3!As Flash&#39;s powers evolve to a godlike new level, he&#39;s replacing Superman as DC&#39;s most powerful hero. However, while the Fastest Man Alive may now be able to alter reality on a fundamental level, that level of power comes with potentially apocalyptic consequences.




In Simon Spurrier, Mike Deodato Jr., Trish Mulvihill and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou&#39;s The Flash #3, Wally West continues to explore his new powers. Along with Max Mercury, Flash visits different layers of DC&#39;s main reality, coming face-to-face with forces beyond his comprehension. As he struggles to navigate, Wally is mocked by the Folding Man, who confirms that a single misstep will alter reality itself. As Wally enters a layer of reality composed of plant life, the Folding Man gloats &#34;Wouldn&#39;t want to wreck the immutable laws of nature by inhaling the wrong spore.&#34;

          

While there&#39;s still a lot to learn about Wally&#39;s powers, it&#39;s clear that he has essentially found a way to access and influence the fundamental forces of reality - both on purpose and by accident.






He&#39;s essentially unlocked the cheat codes to reality.

Recently, the Flash came into contact with exotic matter while battling the mysteriously enhanced Mirror Master. Since then, he&#39;s harnessed the ability to step &#39;sideways.&#39; This allows Wally West to vibrate outside time and space, re-entering reality as he chooses. To his enemies&#39; perspective, this appears similar like teleportation, however The Flash #3 reveals that&#39;s only the tip of the iceberg. In this issue, Flash and Max go on a whistle-stop tour of several dimensions, with each embodying a different aspect of reality - there&#39;s a psychic plane, a world of the dead, and what appears to be the Green and the Red - the supernatural forces that govern flora and fauna in the DC Universe.






Flash is no stranger to DC&#39;s fundamental forces of nature. He&#39;s worked alongside Swamp Thing - the powerful Avatar of the Green - on many occasions, and his daughter Iris is currently best friends with Maxine Baker, who is destined to become the Avatar of the Red (and is the daughter of his Justice League colleague Animal Man.)




While Flash doesn&#39;t yet understand how to control his powers, the Folding Man makes it clear that he&#39;s essentially unlocked the cheat codes to reality. By accessing different layers of reality as physical spaces, Wally can now change what otherwise seemed like unbreakable laws of physics and nature. Within the Green, Flash can change how nature works on its most fundamental level, but that&#39;s just one of several &#39;dimensions&#39; he enters in this issue. So far, it seems like Flash will be able to influence natural law, mental processes, the progress of time, and perhaps even the rules of life and death. As powerful as Superman is, he&#39;s only been able to influence these fundamental forces when given access by a higher power, and certainly can&#39;t rewrite the laws of nature on a whim.

What&#39;s particularly worrying about Flash&#39;s new powers is that while he can influence all of these things, he doesn&#39;t know which of his actions will cause what effect. As Flash and Max explore the psychic layer, they witness intense destruction, which then turns out just to be the arrival of Impulse. It certainly seems like the Flash-Family&#39;s speed powers have always been causing chaos on other levels of reality - they just didn&#39;t know it.

This new level of power for Flash is extreme, but it&#39;s not unprecedented. Flash has long been able to travel through time, changing the timeline through his actions in the past (most disastrously in Flashpoint), and saving those who would have otherwise died. However, what was previously possible through a web of cause and effect now seems to be at Flash&#39;s fingertips, and once he masters his new powers, he should be able to change the world around him with the most minor actions. Hopefully, Flash can gain control of his new reality-altering abilities before he causes too much damage, because surpassing Superman as DC&#39;s most powerful hero also means he just became the most dangerous man alive.




Flash #3 is available now from DC Comics.
