<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Batman’s Insurgency in the Injustice comics and video games inspired many heroes to join the fight against Evil Superman.</p>
<p>Injustice tells the epic and tragic story of Superman becoming an evil dictator and his former best friend, Batman, forming a team of heroes and reformed villains to end his reign of terror. Five years of war between Superman’s Regime and Batman’s Insurgency has all the heroes of the world picking sides.
The Insurgency, led by the Caped Crusader, is the first and last line of defense against Superman’s One-Earth Regime. After the Joker tricks Superman into killing his wife Lois Lane and their unborn child, the Man of Steel finally snaps and kills the Clown Prince of Crime for revenge. During Superman’s murderous conquest of Earth, many heroes jump in to protect the world while siding with Batman’s Insurgency. These were all of the heroes brave enough to join the fight for freedom in the Insurgency.</p>
<p>27 Alfred Pennyworth
The Bat Family Butler</p>
<p>This butler has supported Bruce Wayne since the day he was born. The family butler of the Wayne Family and caretaker/advisor of Bruce Wayne has assisted the billionaire throughout his vigilante career as Batman. Alfred is so committed to Batman’s cause for peace that he even takes a Kryptonian pill to beat up Superman. Though he is killed by Victor Zsasz and later resurrected thanks to the Lazarus Pit, Alfred still loves Bruce and supports Batman’s cause to save the world from Superman’s wrath.</p>
<p>26 Nightwing
Dick Grayson</p>
<p>The first Robin instantly joins the resistance in Year One of Injustice because he wants to help Batman through this difficult time and protect his fellow Titans. Though they’ve had their disagreements, Nightwing respects Batman’s heroism and bravery in standing up to evil threats. Dick is killed during a breakout at Arkham Asylum by Damian Wayne, who accidentally knocks him out, snapping his neck on a rock. In Year Three, Dick Grayson returns in ghost form as the new Deadman to help the Insurgency defeat Trigon and Mister Mxyzptlk.</p>
<p>25 Aquaman
Arthur Curry</p>
<p>The king of Atlantis is one of the first Justice League members to join the Insurgency in the beginning. In Injustice Year One #6 by Tom Taylor, Tom Derenick, Mike S. Miller, Aquaman attends Batman’s meeting with former Justice League members who are committed to fighting back against Superman’s tyranny. However, for the next three years, Aquaman remains a neutral party, keeping his loyalty to his kingdom of Atlantis, while still remaining in contact with Batman. However, Superman periodically checks in on Aquaman to make sure he isn’t helping the Insurgency, and it&rsquo;s not until Injustice 2 that Arthur finally steps up to help Batman.</p>
<p>24 The Birds of Prey
Black Canary (Laurel Lance), Huntress (Helena Bertinelli), and Batwoman (Kate Kane)</p>
<p>The Birds of Prey have a sense of justice that makes it easy to side with Batman. Upon hearing of Superman’s plans to control the world through brute force, the trio revoke their Justice League memberships and join up with Batman’s Insurgency in Injustice Year One #6. They act as Batman’s main enforcers for the Insurgency, but two of the Birds do not survive the war against the Regime. Huntress is killed after Wonder Woman snaps her neck with the Lasso of Truth, and Batwoman is vaporized by Superman’s heat vision. After Superman kills her lover Green Arrow, Black Canary tries to kill the Man of Steel, but she is mortally wounded by his heat vision. Luckily, Doctor Fate saves Canary and brings her to a new universe, Earth-One, where she can live a peaceful life with another Green Arrow and their son.</p>
<p>23 Black Lightning
Jefferson Pierce</p>
<p>Before joining Batman’s cause, Black Lightning helps out with Metropolis relief efforts following a nuclear explosion in the city. The Southside superhero joins the Insurgency in Injustice Year One #6, unable to watch as Superman rules the world with an iron fist. However, Jefferson begins questioning Batman’s extreme methods with the former Justice Leaguers who join the Regime. While skeptical about his leader’s orders, Black Lightning is advised by Batman to go underground and hide from the Regime until further notice. After four years, Jefferson gets tired of sitting on the sidelines and eventually joins the Regime to take action and help others. In Injustice 2, Jefferson apologizes for leaving the Insurgency and now acts as the U.S. President, ready to help Batman create a safer world.</p>
<p>22 Lex Luthor
Superman&rsquo;s Enemy is a Hero in this Universe</p>
<p>The Injustice universe presents Lex Luthor as a good guy who is torn between helping his long-time friend Superman and supporting Batman’s Insurgency. After surviving the Metropolis explosion, Superman and his Regime find Lex Luthor alive and well in Injustice Year One #7. While initially happy to be reunited with his best friend, Lex soon realizes the Clark Kent he knew is dead, and now he must find a way to save the world from this evil Superman. While acting as the Regime’s investor and tech expert, Lex establishes a secret working relationship with the Insurgency, feeding them info and funding their projects for the next five years. Lex ultimately dies after Superman discovers his betrayal in the Injustice video game, but his death assures Batman’s future victory.</p>
<p>21 Martian Manhunter
J’onn J’onzz</p>
<p>J’onn J’onzz is a faithful member of the Insurgency right from the beginning. After Nightwing’s death and Superman’s descent into evil, Batman needs spies on the inside who can help turn the tide against the growing Regime. In Injustice Year One #6, Batman officially forms the Insurgency with Martian Manhunter acting as his official inside man for the Regime. In the end, J’onn tries to reason with Superman by showing him visions of his past with the White Martians taking over his planet. However, after Wonder Woman ruins his attempts at peace, Superman is forced to incinerate J’onn using his heat vision, which is a Martian’s true weakness.</p>
<p>20 Captain Atom
Nathaniel Adam</p>
<p>The living atomic bomb, Captain Atom, joins the Insurgency in Injustice Year One #6, quitting the Justice League after Superman declares world domination. He’s one of the heroes who mount up on a mission to the Fortress of Solitude to steal a durability super pill called “5-U-93-R.” Unfortunately, the Regime tracks down the Insurgents, leading to a slugfest between Captain Atom and Superman. Before Atom can win the fight and kill Superman, Wonder Woman cuts open Atom’s radiation suit with her sword. Unable to contain the energy pouring out of him, Atom decides to take out Kal-El and Diana with a sacrificial explosion. But even the power of 10 nuclear bombs exploding from Atom can’t kill Superman or Wonder Woman.</p>
<p>Injustice: Why the Justice League Sided with Superman When He Turned Evil<br>
In the Injustice Universe, a cruel version of Superman took over the world — something he only accomplished by having the Justice League on his side.</p>
<p>19 Green Arrow
Oliver Queen</p>
<p>Green Arrow is the last hero killed by Superman during his first year as a dictator. Horrified at Superman’s murder of the Joker, Oliver goes to great lengths to save Harley Quinn, fearing she could be next on Superman’s hit list. After much consideration, Green Arrow joins the Insurgency with his better half, Black Canary, in Injustice Year One #6. It’s thanks to Green Arrow that Batman gets his hands on the super pills in the Fortress of Solitude. However, the victory costs Green Arrow his life. After accidentally wounding Jonathan Kent with an arrow, Superman goes insane and beats Oliver to death right in front of his parents. The Green Arrow is remembered as the man who helped give the Insurgency a fighting chance by delivering the super pills before his death.</p>
<p>18 Batgirl/Oracle
Barbara Gordon</p>
<p>Another one of Batman’s trusted allies joins the Insurgency due to loyalty and the Bat-Family&rsquo;s no-killing rule. In Injustice: Year Two #1, Barbara Gordon is revealed to be the Insurgency’s source for intel and global communication as Oracle. However, in Injustice: Year Four #5, with the help of Lex Luthor, Oracle receives intense spinal surgery, which helps her walk again and resume her career as Batgirl. Her biggest contribution to the Insurgency is using a Mother Box and Speed Force energy from the Flash to create a dimension portal and bring in an alternate Justice League to save their universe from the Regime.</p>
<p>17 Green Lantern Corps
Guy Gardner, Kilwog, Tomar-Re, Ganthet, Mogo the Living Planet</p>
<p>The Green Lantern Corps, except Hal Jordan and John Stewart, side with the Insurgency to battle Superman during Injustice Year Two. After Superman refuses to end his hostile takeover of Earth, Ganthet mobilizes the entire Green Lantern Corps to launch an all-out war against the Regime. The war leads to most of the Corps being killed, with Hal Jordan ripping Guy Gardner’s arm and ring off while Sinestro kills John Stewart and many other Lanterns. Finally, after being bestowed with a Yellow Ring, Yellow Lantern Superman kills both Ganthet and Mogo the Living Planet by flying them both into Earth’s sun.</p>
<p>16 The GCPD
Commissioner Jim Gordon, Renee Montoya, and Harvey Bullock</p>
<p>Though they could never compete with Gods and Monsters, the Gotham City Police Department has always been able to save lives. In Injustice Year Two #2, Jim Gordon is invited into the Insurgency by his daughter Barbara after Superman threatens him for info on the “fugitive” Batman. Gordon brings in officers Renee Montoya and Harvey Bullock to the resistance, and they are all given the Super pills to fight against the Regime. Bullock is vaporized by the Spectre in Year Three and Renee overdoses on Super pills trying to kill Superman in Year Four. While Gordon eventually succumbs to his cancer, his last heroic act is saving the Insurgency base from being found by the Regime.</p>
<p>15 Doctor Occult
Richard Occult</p>
<p>When Batman is left with no choice but to rely on Dark Magic, he reaches out to the experts, starting with Doctor Occult. In Injustice Year Three Annual #1 by Ray Fawkes and Xermanico, Batman seeks out Doctor Occult to develop countermeasures against magic users in the Regime such as Wonder Woman and Raven. While sharing a body with his girlfriend, Rose Psychic, the Doctor sets off to Raven’s home dimension, Azarath, to find anti-magic weapons to give the Insurgency an edge. However, Raven finds the couple and kills Occult and Rose before they can return to Batman.</p>
<p>14 Teen Titans
Superboy (Connor Kent), Starfire (Koriand’r), Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark), and Red Robin (Tim Drake)</p>
<p>Three years after the nuclear explosion in Metropolis kills Titan members Kid Flash and Beast Boy, Superboy has had enough of watching his mentor/father figure become a villain. In Injustice Year Three Annual #1, the surviving Teen Titans Superboy, Starfire, Wonder Girl, and Red Robin work together to trap Superman in the Phantom Zone. But Superman critically injures Superboy, which leads to Connor and the Titans being trapped in the Zone instead. After six years in the Zone, the Titans are freed by Batman and Plastic Man. After Red Robin is killed by a returning General Zod, Superboy decides to carry on the Superman name until he and Wonder Girl are captured by Brainiac. Luckily, they are saved by Booster Gold, who takes them to the future.</p>
<p>13 Hellblazer
John Constantine</p>
<p>The Hellblazer joins the fight against Superman’s Regime. After the Regime’s Raven kills Doctor Occult, Constantine initially refuses Batman’s offer to help defeat Superman. He has a change of heart when he has a chance to defeat Superman and Wonder Woman with sleep magic. Throughout Injustice Year Three, along with his Justice League Dark comrades, Constantine leads the Insurgency through the magical realms, facing off against the all-powerful Trigon and Mister Mxyzptlk. Thanks to Doctor Fate, Constantine’s secret plan to trap both Trigon and Mxy in the void works wonders. Finally free from the two most powerful and evil magical beings, John Constantine leaves the Insurgency to take care of his daughter, Rose.</p>
<p>12 Etrigan the Demon
Jason Blood</p>
<p>The magical version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde helps support the Insurgency. Jason Blood, an ancient sorcerer and expert on occultism, is a host body for a powerful Hell demon named Etrigan. The two souls are constantly at odds with each other, but both realize the danger of Superman’s Regime. In Injustice Year Three #2, Jason Blood is called upon by Constantine to help Batman use magic to defeat the Regime. Sadly, Jason Blood is vaporized along with Harvey Bullock by Mister Mxyzptlk posing as the Spectre. Now free from Blood’s body, Etrigan mourns for his former host and honors him by possessing the bodies of Constantine and Batman to help put Superman into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Injustice: Every Villain Executed by Superman&rsquo;s Evil Regime (Ranked Weakest to Strongest)<br>
In Injustice, Joker breaks Superman, leading the Man of Steel to adopt brutal new tactics and &lsquo;protect&rsquo; Earth by slaughtering its villains.</p>
<p>11 Justice League Dark
Zatanna Zatara, Madame Xanadu, Deadman (Boston Brand), and Detective Chimp</p>
<p>The greatest superhero team of wizards joins the Insurgency in Injustice Year Three #2. Constantine gathers these masters of magic and mystery to figure out a way to put Superman into a magical sleeping coma. Before Year Three, Zatanna joins the Insurgency much earlier to help Batman heal his back after he is paralyzed by Superman. Madame Xanadu uses her power of foresight to help Batman and Constantine in their mission to stop Superman. Though Deadman is killed by Mister Mxyzptlk, Boston Brand passes his mantle of Deadman to the deceased Nightwing, who helps turn the tide in the battle with Trigon and the evil imp.</p>
<p>10 Doctor Fate
Kent Nelson</p>
<p>The mightiest sorcerer in all of DC Comics joins Batman’s side in this war. Kent Nelson, the current Doctor Fate, offers his services to Batman by order of Nabu, the entity that resides in his helmet. In Injustice: Year Two #12, Doctor Fate breaks his vows to Nabu by helping Black Canary cheat death and start a new life with Earth-One Green Arrow. After assisting the Insurgency in Year Three with the Justice League Dark, Fate returns in Injustice 2 video game. However, Nabu has taken full control of Kent after his “insubordinate” behavior of saving lives. Later on, Kent breaks free from Nabu and regains his humanity until he is killed by Brainiac.</p>
<p>9 Plastic Man
Patrick O’Brien</p>
<p>The wise-cracking elastic man is a rebel when it comes to protecting his family. In Injustice Year Four Annual #1 by Tom Taylor, Bruno Redondo, Sergio Sandoval, Jordi Tarragona, Plastic Man saves his son Luke from the Regime’s super-prison, the Trench. Though Luke’s only “crime” is opposing Superman, Plastic Man shows his heroic side by freeing all the inmates in the Trench and taking his son to safety in the Mirror World. In Injustice 2 #8, Batman recruits the father and son duo to save more lives as part of the Justice League Task Force.</p>
<p>8 Hawkman
Katar Hol</p>
<p>The reincarnated Carter Hall joins the Insurgency to face his former wife, Shiera Hall aka Hawkgirl. Hawkman, a 100-year-old alien from the planet Thanagar, longs to be with his people and be reunited with his one true love, Hawkgirl. However, in Injustice Year Five #4, Hawkman returns to Earth to win his lover back, only to find she has joined Superman’s Regime. While his interests align with the Insurgency, Hawkman uses stolen Kryptonite meant for Batman’s plans to fuse it with his mace to kill Superman. Sadly, Katar’s plan fails as the Flash takes away his Kryptonite mace while Superman beats the alien to death.</p>
