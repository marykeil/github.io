## Literature Review

The Penguin is finally returning to Gotham, as Oswald Cobblepot&#39;s makeover into DC&#39;s scariest villain reaches its height - Batman better look out.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For The Penguin #8!Gotham City is home to some of the deadliest villains to ever exist in DC Comics, and Penguin has spent the last few months proving he&#39;s the most dangerous - even while living in exile, marshaling his forces to make a grand return. Now, Oswald Cobblepot is coming home, and even Batman should be scared.




The Penguin will be returning to Gotham City in The Penguin #8 by Tom King and Rafael De Latorre, as announced in newly revealed solicit information. Penguin has been gone for quite a while after faking his death to frame Batman for his murder. This ended up nearly destroying the entire Bat-Family, due to the Superman-level android Failsafe activating in response to Batman seemingly taking a life. Meanwhile, Penguin left the life of crime behind... at least until he was contacted by Amanda Waller, who wants him to be her puppet in Gotham&#39;s underworld.

Having recruited the deadly fighter known as the Help and the former superheroes the Force of July, Penguin is seemingly ready to take Gotham by storm once again - despite the fact that when he &#39;left,&#39; he willed his criminal empire to his children. It appears that before he takes on the city&#39;s protectors, Penguin will need to deal with the next generation of Cobblepots.

Oswald Cobblepot Is Done Planning - Now He&#39;s Coming After Batman


          

Finally free of Gotham, Penguin had fallen in love and settled down to a life of non-violence, however Amanda Waller needs someone who can conquer Batman&#39;s city. Kidnapping Penguin&#39;s new partner, Waller assigned Agent Nuri Espinoza as Penguin&#39;s handler, forcing him to recommit to his life of murder and treachery. The series so far has stressed how cruel, calculating, and effective the Penguin really is, with an early flashforward showing Batman close to death, drowning in the Batmobile thanks to Oswald&#39;s upcoming plans.




A lot of people assume that the Joker is Batman&#39;s most deadly enemy, but The Penguin has made a good case that Batman&#39;s ultimate villain is the Penguin. While many other villains, like Joker and Bane, have caused massive destruction to the city, they&#39;re also quickly defeated and brought to Arkham Asylum, starting again from scratch. In contrast, the Penguin has only gone from strength to strength, all while murdering, trafficking, and supplying weapons across Bruce Wayne&#39;s city. The Batman Who Laughs even made a point of telling Penguin that in the majority of alternate realities, he&#39;s the last Gotham villain standing.



          

The Penguin&#39;s return to Gotham City is likely to be devastating for everyone there, civilians and criminals alike. The Penguin&#39;s control over Gotham&#39;s economy rivals that of Bruce Wayne&#39;s and his criminal connections are second to none. Even outside of Gotham City - and starting from nothing - Penguin was able to assemble some of the most dangerous criminals on the planet to work with him. While Batman has managed to stop the Penguin before, definitively defeating him has always been another matter. As Penguin returns to Gotham City to reclaim his empire, he&#39;s beginning a war that Batman may not be capable of winning.




The Penguin #8 is on sale March 26 from DC Comics!
