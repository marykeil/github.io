# Forget the Force - Chewbacca s Neck Strength Is Star Wars  Most Unbelievable Power


## SUMMARY 



  Chewbacca&#39;s neck strength is more impressive than the Force, as he demonstrates by ripping the head off a droid with his teeth.   The feat of Chewbacca biting the head off a durable droid is unlike anything fans have seen in Star Wars, making it truly impressive and unbelievable.   While the Force grants god-like power, the idea that anyone, including a Wookie, can use their bite force to rip off a droid&#39;s head is even more unbelievable. Chewbacca&#39;s neck strength is the most unbelievable power in Star Wars.

## Literature Review

The Force in Star Wars is a cosmic energy that grants some near god-like power, yet even still, Chewbacca&#39;s neck strength is way more unbelievable. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Star Wars #41 The Force is the connective energy that flows through all living things across the entire Star Wars universe and can be used as a type of superpower for those who know how to access it - with telepathy and telekinesis being just two of the many examples of what the Force can do - but even still, the Force is nowhere close to being as impressive as Chewbacca’s neck strength, especially after the Wookie’s latest action-packed adventure.




It’s a known fact that Wookies are incredibly strong, as it’s something that’s been shown in Star Wars since the days of the original trilogy and through the prequel and sequel trilogies as well. Wookies fought alongside the Jedi against the Separatist droid army during the Clone Wars, they regularly tore the arms off their captors when enslaved by the Empire, and even Chewbacca himself nearly crushed Lando’s throat with his bare hands (and could have easily done far greater damage, at that).

         

Even with the Wookie species’ proven feats of strength as shown throughout the films, shows, and other forms of Star Wars media, nothing compares to that of Chewbacca in Marvel Comics’ Star Wars #41. Chewie didn’t just rip a droid apart, he did so with his teeth, and tore the head off an attacking droid using nothing but bite grip and neck strength.





 Star Wars’ Chewbacca Bit The Head Off A Scourge Droid 
          

In Star Wars #41 by Charles Soule and Madibek Musabekov, Luke, Leia, Lando, and Chewie are taking on an army of Scourge-infected droids. Leia and Lando are shooting the villains with their blasters and Luke Skywalker is cutting each of them down with his lightsaber, calling upon the Force to assist in that effort as well.

Meanwhile, Chewbacca grabs a droid, bites down on its head, and rips the mechanical appendage off its synthetic body. Wires and sparks fly like blood gushing from a fatal wound, with Chewbacca’s teeth digging deeper into the droid’s mechanics, his eyes wide with a warrior’s fury, looking for his next victim.



 Chewbacca’s Feat Of Strength Is Unlike Anything Fans Have Seen In Star Wars 
          




Chewbacca biting the head off a droid - a droid that can withstand blaster fire and exhibits significant strength and durability itself - is like tearing the door off a car… with his mouth. Fans have seen the Force used in practically every way imaginable so far in the series, from Rey and Kylo Ren being dyads in the Force to Palpatine using dark side magic to literally come back from the dead, but fans haven’t seen anything like what Chewbacca did to this droid, making this feat of strength way more impressive (and, quite frankly, unbelievable).

Obviously, a side-by-side comparison between the Force and Chewbacca’s bite force and neck strength is no contest, with the Force granting those who are particularly well-connected to it near god-like power. That being said, the idea that any creature, Wookie or otherwise, can rip a droid’s head off with its mouth is honestly more unbelievable than a cosmic energy source giving people superpowers. In other words, forget the Force - Chewbacca’s neck strength is Star Wars’ actual most unbelievable power.




Star Wars #41 by Marvel Comics is available now.
