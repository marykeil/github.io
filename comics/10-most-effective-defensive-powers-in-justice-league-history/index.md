## Literature Review

When it comes to the Justice League’s members keeping themselves or others safe, these 10 special abilities are the best in the team’s history.




The Justice League is one of the best superhero teams ever created and not just because of their ability to play offense. While many DC heroes have special abilities that make them powerful threats to even more powerful evildoers, sometimes going on the defensive is the smarter way to go. Sure heat vision or superspeed can help turn the tide of battle. But when heroes need to keep themselves or others safe, the following 10 powers just can&#39;t be beaten.









 








 10  Aquaman Can Attack People&#39;s Minds 
Created by Mort Weisinger and Paul Norris
        

People may laugh at Aquaman’s ability to ‘talk to fish’, but no one is laughing when the King Beneath the Seas uses his powers on more advanced beings. Arthur Curry has telepathic control over creatures that live in the sea. But life that evolved from the sea, namely humans, are also susceptible to his influence. Of course, Aquaman doesn’t have complete control over humans as he does marine life, but he can compel them to perform certain actions. He can also induce seizures to stop people, making Aquaman much more of a threat than people give him credit for.





 9  Plastic Man is Too Stretchy to Die 
Created by Jack Cole
        

Plastic Man might be seen as the Justice League’s resident jokester, but he’s notoriously hard to kill. Thanks to a strange chemical mixture, Eel O’Brian is the most malleable person alive and his physiology practically defies comprehension. Not only can Plastic Man survive anything that’s thrown at him, but he can alter his form and turn into a shield or anything needed to protect other people. In fact, To get an idea of how hard Plastic Man is to kill, he once had his heart ripped out in Blackest Night and lived to tell the tale.





 8  Animal Man Has Every Animal Power Imaginable 
Created by Dave Wood and Carmine Infantino
        

Buddy Baker, aka Animal Man, has powers that make him an underrated powerhouse. Animal Man has access to the universe’s morphogenetic field, aka the Red, and can take on the abilities of any creature, even extinct ones. While he often calls on the strength and speed of mightier creatures in battle, he can also call on other skills for defensive purposes. Buddy can take the camouflage abilities of chameleons to hide or become as durable as a cockroach to survive more brutal enemies. He might not be the League’s go-to guy, but he’s got near-limitless defensive abilities.





 7  Shazam is as Strong as the Gods 
Created by Bill Parker and C.C. Beck
        

When Billy Batson was given powers by the wizard, he was granted gifts by six different legendary figures. From Atlas, Billy gains otherworldly stamina that allows him invulnerability on par with Superman. In fact, as the Earth’s Mightiest Mortal, Shazam can withstand blows from heroes or villains who have Kryptonian-level strength. It’s an impressive level of durability that has allowed him to safeguard the world. Unfortunately, this power doesn’t extend to his mortal side, which puts the hero at a serious disadvantage when he transforms into Billy Batson in the middle of a fight.





 6  Wonder Woman’s Bracelets Can Stop Anything 
Created by William Moulton Marston and H.G. Peter


 







Wonder Woman is one of, if not the most skilled warrior in the DC Universe. But at her core, she’s a protector and nothing helps her keep others safe than her iconic move. Thanks to the Bracelets of Submission, gauntlets made of an indestructible metal, Diana can counter any bullet that comes her way. Whether fired from a pistol or a machine gun, Wonder Woman is fast enough to deflect bullets from herself or others. Her bracelets are also strong enough to stop missiles and energy blasts as strong as Superman’s heat vision.





 5  There&#39;s Nothing Firestorm Can&#39;t Transmutate 
Created by Gerry Conway and Al Milgrom
        

Firestorm is the Nuclear Man and with a solid understanding of atomic structures, there’s virtually nothing he can’t do. When two people are connected to the Firestorm Matrix, whoever is operating the body can completely change the composition of anything around them. If someone has a gun, Firestorm can easily turn it into cotton candy or steam. The only hitch is that the ‘driver’ of the Firestorm Matrix must know their desired atomic structure (though they can easily speak to the secondary Firestorm member for advice). It’s a bit trickier than other superhero defenses, but it’s amazingly effective when used correctly.





 4  Green Lanterns Can Make Any Defensive Weapon 
Created by Martin Nodell and Bill Finger


 







Every Green Lantern has one of the most powerful weapons in the DC Universe. The Power Ring can bring anything its users think to life and is only limited by one’s imagination. While many Lanterns use their rings to conjure up offensive weapons, they can also create shields, walls, and even suits of armor. Of course, the durability of a Lantern’s constructs depends on how much willpower they have, so they might not be perfect in the hands of a novice. But a Green Lantern like Hal Jordan or John Stewart can generate an impenetrable field.





 3  Flash&#39;s Phasing Lets Him Slip Through Anything 
Created by Gardner Fox and Harry Lampert
        

The Fastest Man Alive is always showing off the amazing feats he can achieve with his unbelievable speeds. One of the most practical applications of the Flash’s power is his ability to phase. By vibrating his atoms at just the right speed, Barry Allen, Wally West or any speedster can become intangible and pass through any solid object. Not only has this helped Flash escape the most secure of bonds (including a Green Lantern’s force field), but it has also saved his life. In the rare circumstances where Flash doesn’t dodge a bullet, he can vibrate fast enough for it to pass through him.





 2  Batman is Outrageously Prepared For Every Situation 
Created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger
        

He may not have powers, but Batman didn’t make it into the Justice League just because he’s rich. Bruce Wayne is one of the most forward-thinking heroes in the DC Universe and his ‘prep-time’ borders on superhuman. Batman has made numerous plans and contingencies to take down numerous threats and monsters. He’s even proved he could take down his most powerful allies in the infamous “Tower of Babel” arc when it was revealed Batman had failsafes in place to stop the League in case they went rogue. He may only be a man, but Bruce is always thinking multiple steps ahead.





 1  Superman&#39;s Invulnerability is a Gift For Everyone 
Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster


 







What else needs to be said about Superman’s invulnerability? He’s not called the Man of Steel for nothing. This hero survives powerful extremes on a daily basis. Neither high-caliber bullets, the vacuum of space, or even the mighty power of the sun are enough to hurt Clark Kent. Not only does he use his powerful, natural defenses to take on threats that would kill average people, but Superman first and foremost makes sure his gifts protect innocent people caught in the crossfire. Sure kryptonite or red sun radiation can diminish his powers. But for the most part, nothing tops Superman’s invulnerability.
Out of all the powers that help keep the DC Universe safe, these 10 abilities are the best in Justice League history.
