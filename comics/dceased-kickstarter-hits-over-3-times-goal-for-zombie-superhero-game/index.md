## Literature Review

Comic fans have only a few days left to get the exclusive extras for the Kickstarter-funded DCeased - A Zombicide Game, based on the hit DC title.




DCeased was an incredibly popular comic series from 2019, in which a virus based on the Anti-Life equation spread throughout Earth, turning villains, heroes, and bystanders into violent zombies. CMON Games is resurrecting the franchise with a new board game on Kickstarter, based on the popular Zombicide engine. The cooperative game has already tripled its goal amount, and blown through most of its stretch goals heading into its final days.




With the Kickstarter ending soon, enthusiastic DCeased fans will want to make sure to get their pledges in, as there are many figures and alternate rule-sets exclusive to the Kickstarter.


 

Zombicide is a miniatures game for 1-6 players, where everyone works together to survive a zombie apocalypse. CMON Games previously made Marvel Zombies games using the Zombicide mechanics, so they have experience at transforming a comic saga into a tabletop gaming experience. In addition to all the unlocked add-ons from the campaign, there are already additional expansions featuring fan favorite locations and villains, like Arkham Asylum and the Green Lantern Corps.

 DCeased Tore Apart the Justice League – Literally 
          




In DCeased, Darkseid kidnapped Cyborg after discovering that his cybernetics held one half of the Anti-Life Equation, the villain&#39;s personal &#34;white whale&#34;. Merging the half he already had with Cyborg&#39;s systems, the equation becomes corrupted, transforming into a techno-virus that is immediately unleashed directly onto Darkseid. To stop the virus from spreading throughout Apokolips, Darkseid&#39;s followers sent Cyborg back to Earth, uploading the virus onto the internet, instantly spreading the virus around the world. Heroes and villains of the DC Universe alike turn into feral, violent zombies, made much worse with their superpowers factored in. The popular series has received several sequels, and was recently turned into an immersive zombie experience.



DCeased came from the creative team of Tom Taylor, Stefano Gaudiano, and Trevor Hairsine.







The new DCeased board game allows anyone to work their way through the apocalyptic landscape of DC&#39;s zombified Earth – whether with friends, or the game&#39;s solo mode. The zombies are controlled by the AI of the game, so all players take on the roles of the last few uninfected of the DC Universe, including characters such as Batman, Power Girl, and the Flash. Enemies include generic members of the zombie horde, but also zombie villains like Green Lantern, the Penguin, and Beast Boy. Bystanders also give extra items and powers, representing favorite sidekicks like Jimmy Olsen, Vicki Vale, and others.



 The DCeased Kickstarter Is In Its Final Days 


          

With the Kickstarter ending on November 30, comic readers and gamers have only a few days left to make sure to get all the exclusives promised to backers of the game at this stage in its production. The base game comes with 85 customizable, sculpted miniatures representing a wide range of DC characters, but many, many more have been unlocked through stretch goals by the zealous funding of this project. The game has many modular playfields, to mix and match for adjustable difficulty, and the extra sets are available as optional add-ons. Zombicide itself is popular among board gamers; this DC Universe version will prove even more exciting for anyone familiar with DCeased lore.
