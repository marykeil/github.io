## Literature Review

Marvel and DC have exciting futures featuring new versions of iconic characters, with new fanart bringing Batman Beyond and Spider-Man 2099 together!




Marvel and DC Comics are hosts to unique near-future versions of their present-day universes in Spider-Man 2099 and Batman Beyond, with each series ripe for a crossover that will probably never happen in an official capacity. Fortunately for fans, the fanart community has other ideas and has finally brought Miguel O’Hara’s Spider-Man and Terry McGinnis’ Batman together to fight the forces of evil in a team-up for the ages!




Shared on Instagram by both artists responsible for the image, @arifinity_ and @mn_arts_616, these creative talents are concept and digital artists who bring their unique talents to the fanart space in ways that do the characters they depict justice.


 

Collectively uploading concept art featuring some of the most well-known comic book heroes and villains around, like Marvel’s Wolverine and Doctor Strange, DC’s Animal Man and Booster Gold, Invincible’s Mark Grayson, and even a few pieces that mash-up different actors with their hypothetical and hopeful castings in the live-action space, it’s clear that @arifinity_ and @mn_arts_616 are the perfect pair to bring Spider-Man 2099 and Batman Beyond together.

                  Batman Beyond &amp; Spider-Man 2099 Unite in Fanart Marvel &amp; DC Shouldn&#39;t Ignore   Batman Beyond and Spider-Man 2099 are fan-favorite iterations of their present day counterparts, with new fanart putting them on the same team!   





 Marvel and DC Collide in New Batman Beyond x Spider-Man 2099 Fanart 
          

Created by Peter David and Rick Leonardi in 1992, Miguel O’Hara became a new version of Spider-Man hailing from the year 2099 that fans immediately resonated with. Similarly, Terry McGinnis’ iteration of Batman premiered in 1999’s Batman Beyond animated series, a show that rejuvenated The Dark Knight for a future period that fans couldn’t get enough of. And although their respective comic universe crossed over in 1996’s epic DC vs. Marvel miniseries, both Spider-Man 2099 and Batman Beyond didn’t partake for obvious reasons, making this fanart that much more special for fans of these characters to see.

Helped along by the compositing skills of @pixelens._, @arifinity_’s Batman and @mn_arts_616’s Spider-Man practically pop off the screen as they leap and glide across the wet rooftops of a futuristic city that desperately needs their help. Utilizing their respective art styles to bring both heroes to life with gritty realism, @arifinity_ gives Terry’s Batman a sleek, tactical batsuit complete with glowing red eyes, chest bat symbol, and glider wings, while @mn_arts_616 gives Miguel’s Spider-Man a textured set of spandex with bright red spider accents, made even better thanks to Miguel leaping forward in an incredibly acrobatic pose only reserved for the arachnids heroes of the Marvel Universe.






 New Fanart Shows Spider-Man 2099 And Batman Beyond Joining Forces 
          

With DC vs. Marvel still discussed in nerd circles to this day like it were the holy grail of comic crossovers, it seems like a no-brainer for the companies to strike a deal for a miniseries dedicated to these futuristic heroes or, at the very least, commit to an oversized one-shot featuring Miguel and Terry joining forces a la 2022’s Batman/Spawn comic. Regardless of whether the worlds of Spider-Man 2099 and Batman Beyond will ever officially cross paths, fans can at least turn to inspired fanart like this one to give them the superhero team-up they crave.
