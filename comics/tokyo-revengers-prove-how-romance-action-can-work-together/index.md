## Literature Review

While Tokyo Revengers’ hard-boiled street gang story might attract attention, its deeper heartfelt story is what keeps fans coming back for more.  




With its graphic depiction of fighting, ample amounts of toxic masculinity, and street gang themes, Tokyo Revengers is widely seen as a prime example of the delinquent manga genre, but a deeper look at its plot, and its protagonist Takemichi Hanagaki, prove it to be a far more wholesome and positive story.




Ken Wakui&#39;s Tokyo Revengers follows a 26-year old Takemichi wasting his life away doing odd jobs and making just enough money for rent, food, and entertainment. He adopted this lifestyle due to his childhood membership in a street gang with three of his school friends. However, his gang was eventually pressured into serving a much larger and scarier entity, forcing the friend group to disband. So when he had the opportunity to escape the life he mistakenly thought he wanted, he jumped at the chance and changed schools, ditched his friends, and gave up on the one part of his life that he cherished the most – his girlfriend, Hinata. However, after learning that Hinata was killed in an incident involving his old gang, Takemichi is mysteriously transported back in time to his middle school days. Determined to save Hinata, Takemichi vows to rewrite his and his friend&#39;s violent history.

          




Underneath all its delinquency and &#34;bad boy&#34; violence, at its core, Tokyo Revengers is a classic romance manga, dressed up to look like a shonen story of youth gang delinquency. Takemichi loves Hinata so much that he&#39;s not only willing to relive his brutal gang-related experiences, but also suffer an uncountable number of beatings to change the progress of history to make sure that she lives in the future; and he does this all without a guarantee that, even if he succeeds, they will be together in that future. ​​

Like delinquent manga, romance is another popular manga genre. Owning to the nature of the subject, however, romance manga have a much broader range of stories and plots. Any story that involves people falling in love and struggling to realize or maintain the focus of their affections has the basic elements of a romance manga. This is most obvious when romance is the central theme. While there are a few standalone subplots in Tokyo Revengers, the majority of the story centers around Takemichi doing whatever he can – and suffering – to change the future so that Hinata isn&#39;t killed, because even after years of not even thinking about her, he still loves her and wants to marry her.




         

While Tokyo Revengers presents itself as a no-holds-barred glimpse into contemporary Japanese street gang culture, it is, in reality, a romance manga with a hard-as-nails outer surface of Takemichi navigating youth gang culture. It shows how creative minds can transform the oft-maligned romance manga genre into an exciting and engaging story that can go &#34;toe-to-toe&#34; with the best hero, adventure, or dark fantasy manga titles out there.
