# X-Men s Enemies Aren t Just Hunting Mutants Anymore - They re Hunting Superheroes


## SUMMARY 



  Orchis is targeting both mutants and non-mutant superheroes, spreading misinformation to continue turning public opinion against mutants, and by extension any heroes that support them.   Orchis is falsely accusing non-mutant heroes of being mutants, creating further hysteria, and making it increasingly harder for non-mutants to support mutants.   Orchis&#39; current actions are reminiscent of the &#34;Days of Future Past&#34; story arc, where Sentinels hunted all superpowered people, escalating the problems for Marvel&#39;s heroes at large.

## Literature Review

Orchis have increasingly become the X-Men&#39;s greatest threat in their long history; now, the villainous organization will seek to wipe out all heroes.




Warning: Spoilers for Uncanny Spider-Man #4!Orchis are no longer just a threat to the X-Men, but every superhero in the Marvel Universe as well. Heroes and mutantkind both have their fair share of issues right now. Superheroes are struggling to navigate former Mayor Wilson Fisk&#39;s anti-superhero laws, effectively banning heroes from New York City, while Orchis have used their political power to villanize mutants in the eyes of the human public.




Uncanny Spider-Man #4 – written by Si Spurrier, with art Lee Garbett – finds anti-mutant organization Orchis targeting the X-Men&#39;s supporters in the superhero community; this is made easier thanks in large part to Kingpin&#39;s laws, as a result of his anti-hero rhetoric has been that public opinion toward superheroes is at an all-time low.



          

The ever-growing presence of Orchis operations within the New York area has complicated matters significantly for all NYC-based superheroes, especially with prolific heroes like Spider-Man and Captain America continuing to offer their support to mutants. Now, Orchis may have just found a solution to keep people believing their anti-mutant hate speech.

The Anti-Mutant Organization Accuses Non-Mutant Heroes Of Being X-Men
          




The opening pages of Uncanny Spider-Man #4 paints a picture of just how much rage and paranoia about mutanthood has grown among NYC citizens, as a mob has captures a local pizza delivery person, under the impression that he is a mutant. As the new Creepy Crawler Spider-Man looks on, original Spider-Man Peter Parker tries to calm the mob down, attempting to convince them to let the delivery person go. Eventually, one of Orchis&#39; Stark Sentinels arrives on the scene, and uses its mutant detection sensors to confirm to the mob that the person they have detained is, in fact, not a mutant.

All things considered, that should be the end of all this as a crisis has been avoided. However, before the mob has a chance to disperse, the Stark Sentinel scans Spider-Man, and due to the genetic anomaly in his DNA, the Sentinel declares him to be a mutant. Readers know that Spidey having a genetic anomaly does not mean he&#39;s a mutant, and there&#39;s a significant chance that Orchis themselves knows this, but as was alluded to in Uncanny Avengers #3, turning humans against superheroes may be Orchis&#39; way to &#34;clean it all up.&#34; It works here, as the mob turns on Spidey.






 Shades Of &#34;Days of Future Past&#34; 
Orchis&#39; Plans Echo The Sentinels In Chris Claremont&#39;s Influential X-Men Arc
          



&#34;Days of Future Past&#34; took place in 1981&#39;s Uncanny X-Men #141-142 – written by Chris Claremont, with art by John Byrne; the series set the precendent for X-Men&#39;s many subsequent alternate continuity stories, as well as influencing the 2014 live-action X-film of the same name.




This is all very reminiscent of the &#34;Days of Future Past&#34; story arc, where the villainous Sentinels eventually went from hunting mutants, to hunting all superpowered people. This is the beginning of Orchis doing something similar, further escalating the problems of Marvel&#39;s mant heroes. More importantly, this makes it increasingly harder for non-mutants to support mutants. What made Captain America&#39;s speech in Uncanny Avengers #3 so empowering was that it came from someone with no mutant gene. Falsely accusing non-X-Men heroes of being mutants will create enough hysteria to strain whatever attempts non-mutants can make to repair the damages Orchis continues to make.






Uncanny Spider-Man #4 is on sale from Marvel now.
