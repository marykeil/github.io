# Cyborg s New Power Gives the Titans an Edge Even the Justice League Can t Match


## SUMMARY 



  Victor is immune to the Star Conqueror spores because he is more machine than man, lacking the essential parts that the spore needs to latch onto and control him.   Cyborg&#39;s unique immunity to the spores makes him a valuable asset in the Beast World Crisis.   Cyborg&#39;s ability to create Boom Tubes also makes him an exceptionally unique hero.

## Literature Review

Cyborg is known for having capabilities that other heroes could only dream of, and his latest ability is sure to make some Justice Leaguers jealous.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans #7!




Cyborg&#39;s extensive array of powers is both vast and distinctive, with his latest addition being a remarkable type of invulnerability, that not even Superman can match. This newfound power could potentially provide the Titans with the advantage required to stop the ongoing Beast World crisis and save the DC Universe.

In Titans #7 by Tom Taylor and Travis Moore, Xand’r, also known as Brother Eternity, the Tamaranean traitor responsible for unleashing the Necrostar and triggering the Beast World events, uses Starfire as bait to lure Cyborg into a trap.

          

Xand’r&#39;s goal is to infect Cyborg with a mind-controlling Necrostar, envisioning Victor as a crucial ally to help him &#34;cross the stars&#34; and resurrect the Necrostar. Despite Kori&#39;s attempt to warn Victor, a Necrostar spore manages to jump down his throat. However, Cyborg proves immune to the Necrostar spore&#39;s effects, thwarting Xand’r&#39;s sinister plan.





 Cyborg is Immune to Star Conqueror Spores and Can’t Be Infected 
          

When Cyborg defies the spore&#39;s effects, Xand’r finds himself in utter confusion. The spores have proven effective against beings ranging from gods to Kryptonians and Atlanteans, making Cyborg&#39;s resistance unprecedented. Victor&#39;s unique advantage lies in him being more machine than man, lacking the essential parts that the spore needs to latch onto and control him. Additionally, his possession of the &#34;peak technology of two worlds&#34; allows him to out-process the ancient spore. In a move that blends badassery with a touch of disgust, Cyborg commands the spore to &#34;get out&#34; and proceeds to expel it, with Starfire promptly squishing it.

Cyborg revealing that he is immune to Star Conqueror spores is just a glimpse of the Titan&#39;s exceptional and unique abilities showcased in Tom Taylor&#39;s Titans and Titans: Beast World runs. In Titans: Beast World #4, Victor demonstrates another one-of-a-kind skill—creating Boom Tubes. These extra-dimensional portals enable instantaneous travel between any two locations in the universe and beyond. The Boom Tube he conjures in this issue is particularly noteworthy, as he crafts one large enough to teleport Giganta&#39;s giant bear form to a location where she can&#39;t wreak havoc, marking just another way Cybborg is a total badass.






 Cyborg’s Spore Immunity Gives the Titans a Major Edge in Beast World 
          

In the battle against the Beast World crisis, metas and heroes stand as the world&#39;s greatest hope. However, they also represent a significant liability, especially those with meta genes, as they can become dangerous animal hybrids. This presents a Catch-22 as infection could transform them into a bigger threat than the one they are attempting to handle. In contrast, Viktor&#39;s immunity to the spores makes him a standout asset in the DCU. His immunity eliminates the risk of turning into a more formidable threat, positioning Cyborg as a crucial ally in the fight against the crisis.

Titans #7 is available now from DC Comics.
