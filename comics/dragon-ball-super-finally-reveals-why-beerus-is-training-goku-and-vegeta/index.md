## Literature Review

While Dragon Ball Super&#39;s Destroyer God, Beerus, seemed hungry for a good fight, his secret reason for training Goku and Vegeta has come to light.





Summary

  Beerus has been training Goku and Vegeta to potentially become the next God of Destruction of Universe 7.   Goku&#39;s disinterest in the job hasn&#39;t stopped Beerus from trying to find a replacement, and Vegeta could also be a candidate.   Beerus has been the God of Destruction for a very long time, and he likely wants to retire.  







Dragon Ball Super&#39;s God of Destruction has been helping make Goku and Vegeta stronger, and Beerus has finally explained why. The DBZ sequel series broadened the universe and Goku&#39;s variety of adversaries considerably throughout its many arcs. Beerus and his angel attendant, Whis, have been training Goku and Vegeta, and chapter #101 reveals it&#39;s more than a fun side-project for the divine beings.

When the Destroyer God Beerus was introduced in Dragon Ball Super&#39;s first arc, he was exploding entire planets with the same level of boredom and tiredness of an employee long burnt out of their job. After fighting Goku in his Super Saiyan God form, the God of Destruction felt a tinge of excitement he hadn&#39;t felt in many years. And in DBS&#39;s manga chapter #101, he finally reveals why he has continued to keep Goku and Vegeta around.

          




After Goku finished complimenting Black Frieza&#39;s strength, Beerus encouraged the Saiyan to keep training and told him what would happen if he could eventually surpass him. &#34;And once you&#39;re stronger than me? I&#39;ll nominate you as the next God of Destruction,&#34; Beerus said casually while eating a steam bun. This statement reveals that Beerus has been training Goku and Vegeta, hoping one of them would become the new God of Destruction of Universe 7.


 Beerus Wants Goku To Take His Job 
          

Goku has previously expressed his disinterest in taking Beerus&#39;s job, but that hasn&#39;t stopped the current God of Destruction from trying to find a replacement. Beerus has been Universe 7&#39;s Destroyer God for millions of years. Despite the franchise being filled with fun and epic adventures, the old God seems more than ready to retire and nominate another to take his job. An attitude not too dissimilar from Dragon Ball&#39;s creator, Akira Toriyama. But Goku is not the only candidate who could become the new God of Destruction.




Dragon Ball Super&#39;s story arcs proceeding the Tournament of Power has seen Goku power up Ultra Instinct with multiple variations. Vegeta has also learned a new form known as Ultra Ego that uses destruction energy similarly to Beerus. While Vegeta still has a long way to go before matching the Destroyer God&#39;s powers, Beerus&#39;s challenge to Goku could have been a way to push Vegeta. It seems more likely for the Prince of All Saiyans to pursue Beerus&#39;s position, especially with Goku&#39;s proclivity to unlocking the angelic Ultra Instinct, compared to Vegeta&#39;s progression with Beerus and Ultra Ego.



After learning to control his power, Broly would also be a great candidate for Universe 7&#39;s next God of Destruction.






 Offering The Destroyer Position To Goku May Encourage Vegeta To Go For It 
          




The current God of Destruction seems determined to see Goku surpass him, but it&#39;s challenging to imagine Dragon Ball&#39;s protagonist as a Destroyer God. The battle-hungry Saiyan would likely love traveling the universe to fight strong foes, but Goku doesn&#39;t seem like the type of character to relish blowing up planets filled with living creatures. Still, the conclusion of Beerus&#39;s character arc that began with his introduction in Battle of Gods is a mystery. With Dragon Ball Super&#39;s manga teasing the Destroyer God&#39;s retirement, time will tell if he passes the job down or has it taken from him.
