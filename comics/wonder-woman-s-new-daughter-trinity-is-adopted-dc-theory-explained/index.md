# Wonder Woman s New Daughter Trinity Is Adopted - DC Theory Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Trinity, Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter, may not be biologically related to Diana, raising the possibility that she is adopted.   A revelation from Sarge Steel casts doubt on Trinity&#39;s lineage, as it is revealed that Wonder Woman&#39;s rival, Emelie, is potentially Trinity&#39;s birth mother.   Wonder Woman may be lying to Trinity about her true origins, possibly to protect her from a painful chapter in Amazonian history.

## Literature Review

The parentage of Wonder Woman’s future daughter Trinity comes into question when its hinted that another Amazon could be Elizabeth’s birth mother.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Wonder Woman #3!Trinity, Wonder Woman&#39;s future daughter, very likely doesn&#39;t have the blood connection to Diana fans thought. Elizabeth Marston Prince made waves when she debuted as the child of DC&#39;s mighty Amazon warrior. But a revelation from an unexpected source has cast Trinity&#39;s lineage in doubt and raised the possibility that she&#39;s actually adopted.




In Wonder Woman #3 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, Diana comes to Southhide Defense Industries looking for Sarge Steel. Numerous agents are dispatched to try and bring Wonder Woman in, but none of them are a match for Diana&#39;s fighting prowess, especially her tiara which takes out several heavily-armed men.

          

Wonder Woman meets with Sarge Steel to find out what he knows about Diana&#39;s former rival Amazon Emelie. After a brief standoff, Steel relents and reveals a medical report. One blood sample recovered from the pool hall murders turned out to be Emelie&#39;s. The blood also revealed that Emelie is pregnant, a twist that surprises Trinity as she listens to this story.


 Wonder Woman&#39;s Daughter Might Be the Blood Daughter of a Rogue Amazon 
          




Wonder Woman&#39;s world turned upside down when Emelie, the Amazon she once competed against to become Themyscira&#39;s champion, murdered a pool hall full of men after being inappopriately touched. The murders led to the United States government passing legislation that banned Amazons from American soil. Those that didn&#39;t leave the country were either detained or killed by the Amazon Extradition Entity (or A.X.E.). All the while, the secret king of America, the Sovereign, began fomenting waves of anti-Amazon paranoia and hysteria to retain his iron grip on the county his family had been ruling for centuries.

The current Wonder Woman arc is intended to be a story told by the Sovereign to Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter, Elizabeth. Trinity wants to know her story, but Diana refuses to tell her. And thanks to this latest reveal we may finally know why. While it isn&#39;t outright said that Emelie is Elizabeth&#39;s birth mother, it&#39;s clear that Trinity had no clue that Wonder Woman&#39;s rival was ever pregnant. It should also be noted that like Emelie, Elizabeth is also blonde. It&#39;s not the most damning evidence, but given Diana&#39;s refusal to tell Elizabeth her origin, there&#39;s a strong chance that Trinity is the blood daughter of an evil Amazon.






 Wonder Woman is Possibly Lying to Her Future Daughter 
          

It should be noted that the Sovereign isn&#39;t the most truthful character and his family wielded the Lasso of Lies for generations. But by the time Sovereign tells the story to Elizabeth, he no longer holds the lasso. He&#39;s imprisoned and has no reason to lie. Wanting to protect Trinity from this particularly painful chapter in Amazonian history is understandable, but not telling Elizabeth the truth is just as bad. Granted there&#39;s a chance that this is a misdirect and Elizabeth is the blood child of Diana. But if she&#39;s not, Wonder Woman owes a serious explanation to Trinity about her past.

Wonder Woman #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
