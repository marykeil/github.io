## Literature Review

The Green Lantern Corps is made up of thousands of sentient beings from different backgrounds, but one surprise Corps member has a very lethal origin.




The legacy of the Green Lantern is one of DC’s most diverse, especially across the multiverse. From Golden Age heroes like Alan Scott to modern interpretations like Jo Mullein, those who dare to shed their light on dark evil have always had a unique role within the fabric of DC lore. But one Lantern’s path is quite different from her fellow Ringslingers, and it started in the shadow of one of Batman’s greatest foes: Ra&#39;s al Ghul.




Justice League Beyond 2.0 #19 by Christos Gage, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Saida Temofonte catches readers up with the future League of the DCAU, including this timeline’s Green Lantern Kai-Ro as he confronts a version of his sister – the deadly assassin Curaré. Hailing from the home dimension of the infamous Justice Lords and wielding a Power Ring stolen from her world’s Kai-Ro, Curaré is an iconic enemy of Batman &#34;Beyond,&#34; Terry McGinnis.

          

A full-fledged member of Ra&#39;s al Ghul&#39;s League of Assassins, Curaré uses her deadly training in conjunction with her willpower to give her Green Lantern brother a run for his money. And while she’s ultimately defeated and stripped of her ring, she’s still a Green Lantern unlike any readers have seen before.




                  DC’s Strongest Green Lantern Names the Hero Who Should Have His Ring Instead   John Stewart is one of the Green Lantern Corps&#39; brightest lights, but the Master Builder knows who deserves his ring more than he does.   


 Ra&#39;s al Ghul Trained DC&#39;s Deadliest Green Lantern 
          

The Green Lantern Corps is filled with all sorts of sentient beings from unique walks of life. From soldiers to scientists, the Guardians of the Universe have selected a diverse array of champions to enforce their will across the cosmos. But that a power ring deemed an assassin like Curaré worthy — an assassin with obvious ties to Ra’s al Ghul himself — is practically unheard of. After all, while the prime qualification for a Green Lantern is the ability to overcome great fear, there’s also usually an unspoken qualification of a certain moral fiber necessary to serve the Green Lantern Corps – a qualification rarely broken save for renegades like Sinestro or the Parallax-infected Hal Jordan.




While it’s clear that Curaré stole her ring from her murdered brother, that she has the willpower to force it into her service instead of finding a worthy replacement makes her far more dangerous than any amount of lethal training ever could. Even without her Lantern abilities, fans have seen the threat she poses against world-class heroes like Batman Beyond. Combine a stolen power ring with years of tutelage at the hands of one of the most dangerous men in the world – and arguably Batman’s greatest rival other than the Joker – and there’s practically no limit to the threat Curaré could pose if left unchecked.



 The Green Lantern Corps Has Never Seen Anyone Like Curaré 
          

While Curaré may have ultimately been defeated by Green Lantern Kai-Ro and the Justice League, she’s still far and away one of the most unique Green Lantern recruits fans have ever seen. As a student of Ra’s al Ghul and with the training to match, this character already poses a formidable threat to any hero unfortunate enough to stand in her way. But as DC’s deadliest Green Lantern, Curaré could potentially become the most dangerous woman not just in Gotham, but in the DC cosmos as a whole.






Justice League Beyond 2.0 #19 is available now from DC Comics.
