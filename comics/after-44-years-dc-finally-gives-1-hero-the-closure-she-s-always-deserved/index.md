## Literature Review

The DC Universe is no stranger to heroes born from tragedy, but after 44 years, Starfire is finally getting the closure and revenge she deserves.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans #7!




Much like Batman and Nightwing, Starfire&#39;s journey as a hero sprang from the tragedy of witnessing her parents&#39; murder. Yet, unlike the dynamic duo, Kori&#39;s suffering didn&#39;t end there. Instead of being granted the time to grieve and the solace of loved ones, she found herself ensnared in enslavement. Despite Starfire&#39;s resilience and growth through her hardships, the closure she rightfully deserved remained elusive—until now.

Titans #7 by Tom Taylor and Travis Moore delves deeper into the revelation that Brother Eternity, the orchestrator of releasing the Necrostar and catalyst for the Beast World crisis, is actually Xand&#39;r—a former trusted advisor to Kori&#39;s family.

          

Contrary to Starfire&#39;s belief, he was not the friend he had appeared to be and was, in fact, responsible for her parents&#39; death and subsequent enslavement. Xand&#39;r has been a source of profound pain for Starfire in both her past and present. However, with the assistance of Raven, Starfire finally attains her well-deserved revenge against Xand&#39;r.




                  Sorry Raven: But Starfire Has a New Best Friend and Together They’re Unstoppable   Starfire and Raven may have once been DC&#39;s ultimate best friends forever duo, but it looks like Kori has a new bestie and together their undefeatable.   


 Starfire Gets Revenge Against Xand&#39;r for Murdering Her Parents 
          

With Kori temporarily incapacitated, Xand’r begins to go on a monologue detailing his betrayal of Starfire&#39;s parents. He reveals the deal he made with the Dominators and the Citadel, that he would ensure Kori&#39;s parents and the council were vulnerable to a strike while keeping Kori and her sister away. In exchange, the Dominators and the Citadel pledged to provide him with information on the location of the god he worshipped—the Necrostar. Xand&#39;r&#39;s plotting and betrayal were successful and resulted in the death of Kori&#39;s parents and her enslavement.




Xand&#39;r&#39;s monologue faces an abrupt interruption as Cyborg enters the scene. Using the distraction, Starfire seizes the moment and delivers a killer right hook, unleashing decades-long pent-up rage, hurt, and betrayal. The punch proves cathartic, marking the moment that Kori finally gets some semblance of vengeance for her parents. However, Starfire&#39;s closure regarding Xand&#39;r&#39;s crimes against her family reaches its peak when Raven personally visits him in confinement and banishes him to the Phantom Zone. Titans #7 stands as a pivotal issue for Kori, providing her character with her long-overdue closure.

                  Nightwing&#39;s Time as a Leader Should End (and Starfire&#39;s Repulsive New Feat Proves Why)   Starfire becomes Nightwing&#39;s knight in purple armor with one feat that is as disgusting as it is badass, proving she has the grit to lead the Titans.    



 Starfire and Nightwing’s Tragic Connection Comes Full Circle 
          




Nightwing and Starfire share the tragic bond of both witnessing their parents&#39; murders. This shared trauma has forged a resilient connection over the years, offering each a profound understanding of the pain and suffering that defined their journeys as heroes. While Dick found closure by avenging his parents, Kori had long been denied this resolution. However, with Xand&#39;r now banished to the Phantom Zone, she has at last attained the closure that had been afforded to Dick but alluded her. This culmination brings their shared tragic connection full circle, marking a significant moment in Starfire and Nightwing&#39;s intertwined histories.

Titans #7 is available now from DC Comics.
