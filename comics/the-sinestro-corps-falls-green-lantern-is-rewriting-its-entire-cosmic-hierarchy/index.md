## Literature Review

A devastating change comes to the Green Lantern mythos when an attack on the Sinestro Corps turns out to be the prelude to a bigger mystery.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #7!Changes are coming to the DC Universe as an iconic part of the Green Lantern mythology falls. For months now, fans have been wondering what caused the recent bad blood between Hal Jordan and Sinestro. And the answer reveals an even darker mystery that could endanger the entire DC Universe.




In Green Lantern #7 by Jeremy Adams and Amancay Nahuelpan, a flashback details what happened when the Green Lantern Corps was taken over by the United Planets. Hal is reassigned to serve as an escort for the United Planet&#39;s leader Lord Premier Thaaros as he attempts to broker a peace with the Sinestro Corps.

          

However, the peace talks are a trap as several members of the Sinestro Corps attack Thaaros, forcing the Green Lantern Kilowog into a fight. Unfortunately, Kilowog is killed when the Yellow Central Power Battery explodes. Hal wraps up the story to his old ally Razer, who informs Hal that the Blue Central Power Battery has also blown up.


 Something is Destroying The Green Lantern&#39;s Emotional Spectrum 
          




Things have been odd in Green Lantern&#39;s corner of the DC Universe. After the Guardians of the Universe disappeared and the United Planets assumed control of the Corps, Hal Jordan retired and came back to Earth. Unfortunately, his most bitter enemy Sinestro was there, too, but he wasn&#39;t able to tap into the Yellow Light of Fear. However, after a failed attack, Green Lantern&#39;s nemesis discovered that he was able to access the Red Light of Rage, turning Sinestro into a Red Lantern. Since the event, Hal has been curious as to what&#39;s going on with the Emotional Spectrum&#39;s recent aberrations.

It&#39;s been known that something odd was occurring in the Emotional Spectrum, though what it was hasn&#39;t been clarified. Now it appears that something is actively destroying the Central Power Batteries of the various Corps. The Green Lanterns lost theirs some time ago, but thankfully John Stewart&#39;s recent power upgrade made him a decent substitute. However, the destruction of Yellow and Blue Batteries has seemingly severed Sinestro and Razer&#39;s connections to their respective energies. Someone clearly wants to destroy the other lights of the Emotional Spectrum. The question is who has the power to do something like that and why do it now?






 The DC Universe&#39;s Greatest Energy Source is in Danger 
          

The Emotional Spectrum is a powerful energy and the various lights become stronger when working together. While it&#39;s unknown who is taking out the Central Power Batteries, it&#39;s clear that doing so is having a severe effect on the Lanterns&#39; abilities to wield the various lights. It&#39;s possible that the Black Lanterns have returned in some capacity and are trying to extinguish the White Light of Creation. Or there could be some other entity who wants to destroy as much of the Emotional Spectrum for some other unknown purpose. Whatever&#39;s behind this mystery, Green Lantern needs to figure out what&#39;s going on before every other light is permanently snuffed out.

Green Lantern #7 is on sale now from DC Comics.
