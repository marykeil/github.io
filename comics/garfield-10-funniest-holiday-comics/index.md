 10  Santa Likes Garfield&#39;s Post 
Published December 24, 2019
        

Since its debut on June 19, 1978, the Garfield comic strip by Davis has stood the test of time, evolving with the changing landscape of modern advancements. A prime example of this evolution can be seen in a more recent installment, where Santa Claus is depicted liking Garfield&#39;s picture of cookies and milk on social media.
The sheer absurdity of Garfield and Santa having social media accounts adds a contemporary twist to the classic strip. This clever integration of modern elements into the timeless world of Garfield showcases the strip&#39;s ability to stay relevant and delight audiences for over four decades.





 9  Homeowners Against Ugly Yard Santas 
Published December 13, 2020


 







It appears that not even the world of Garfield is immune to a villain familiar to many in the real world—the Homeowners Association. In this particular strip, Jon&#39;s efforts to embrace the Christmas spirit are abruptly dampened as he incurs a fine from his HOA for featuring what they deem an &#34;ugly yard Santa.&#34;
The humor in this scenario is amusingly absurd and hits close to home for many readers who can likely relate to the struggles of dealing with their own HOAs. This comic cleverly intertwines humor and realism, showcasing how even in the world of Garfield, the challenges posed by the Homeowners Association are all too real.





 8  Waiting Up for Santa Claus 
Published December 24, 2007


 







In Davis&#39; Christmas-themed strips, there is a running gag involving Garfield and Odie earnestly attempting to catch a glimpse of Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. The humor in these scenarios always unfolds in the same way—despite their best efforts, the two companions inevitably succumb to sleep before Santa&#39;s much-anticipated arrival.
This specific comic brilliantly encapsulates this running joke&#39;s essence, depicting Santa entering after Garfield and Odie have fallen asleep. Santa&#39;s quip, &#34;I love tradition,&#34; serves as a humorous acknowledgment of the countless other comics preceding it that have playfully employed the same endearing gag.





 7  &#39;Tis the Season to Regift Fruitcake 
Published December 17, 2019
        

&#39;Tis the season for the dreaded tradition of gifting fruitcake, and it seems even Garfield, renowned for his love of food, shares a disdain for this spirit-soaked concoction of dried fruits, nuts, and spices. Davis once again taps into the holiday familiarity in his comic, portraying Jon and Garfield regifting their unwanted fruitcake to the birds outside.
The scenario strikes a chord of realism, as anyone who has received a fruitcake has likely contemplated regifting or discreetly disposing of it. The humor reaches its peak in this strip with the punchline—the birds, equally unimpressed, attempt to regift the much-maligned fruitcake to the squirrels.





 6  &#34;Be My Lederhosen Baby&#34; 
Published December 25, 2010


 







In this humorous comic, Jon presents Liz with the peculiar gift of a music box that plays the &#34;Be My Lederhosen Baby&#34; polka, a choice that clearly doesn&#39;t resonate with Liz&#39;s taste. Ever the astute observer, Garfield humorously suggests using Odie&#39;s backyard digging escapades to dispose of the quirky present.
Jon&#39;s less-than-stellar gift-giving skills are a recurring theme in Davis&#39; Christmas strips, and this particular comic is just one instance where Jon earnestly attempts to select a gift that Liz will appreciate, only to fail miserably. The ongoing gag highlights the comedic dynamic of Garfield teasing Jon for his well-intentioned but often misguided efforts to please Liz.





 5  Jon vs the Christmas Tree 
Published December 8, 2009
        

While Davis is renowned for his clever dialogue, he also proves to be a master of visual gag humor, adept at telling a story through images alone. In this particular strip, fans witness Jon in a notably disheveled state, covered in pine needles and entangled in Christmas lights.
The visual alone paints a vivid picture of a comical encounter between Jon and the Christmas tree, with the tree evidently emerging victorious. Adding the perfect touch to this visual narrative, Garfield&#39;s deadpan comment of &#34;The tree&#39;s still crooked&#34; serves as the pièce de résistance, injecting a final dose of humor and capturing the essence of the strip&#39;s comedic brilliance.





 4  Season Greetings From Mrs. Feeny 
Published December 8, 2003
        

Mrs. Feeny is the elderly neighbor of Jon and Garfield, who is often unwittingly thrust into the midst of the orange tabby&#39;s mischievous antics. Their relationship is characterized by a tumultuous and comically antagonistic dynamic, with Mrs. Feeny often retaliating against Garfield through means like restraining orders and her trusty leaf blower.
However, in this Christmas special, fans witness a holiday-themed twist as Mrs. Feeny sends Garfield a card expressing her wish for him to receive &#34;big ol&#39; hot, fiery coal&#34; for Christmas. The card humorously encapsulates the depth of Mrs. Feeny&#39;s disdain for Garfield, adding a festive touch to their ongoing comedic feud.
Mrs. Feeny never appears in-panel in the Garfield comics. She is usually on the phone with Jon Arbuckle, complaining about Garfield’s latest slight against her. 






 3  Santa&#39;s a T-Bone and Coffee Kind of Man 
Published December 24, 1998
        

Davis&#39; comedic brilliance takes center stage in this comic when Garfield scolds Jon for presuming that &#34;a big fat guy who&#39;s driving all night&#34; would prefer cookies and milk over a hearty T-bone steak and coffee. The humor lies in the absurdity of Garfield&#39;s suggestion, which serves as a testament to Davis&#39; ability to infuse wit and the unexpected into the dialogue of his comics. Garfield&#39;s unconventional snack choice for Santa showcases the feline&#39;s unwavering dedication to food and emphasizes the depth of thought he invests in his culinary preferences.





 2  Santa Gifts Garfield with a Christmas Restraining Order 
Published December 8, 2008


 







Beyond Mrs. Feeny&#39;s realm of grievances, even Santa Claus appears to have found cause to issue a restraining order against Garfield. This comic strip offers fans a humorous glimpse into the orange tabby&#39;s world, where even the merry figurehead of Christmas is compelled to take such drastic measures against the mischievous feline.
The humor unfolds in multiple layers, from Garfield nonchalantly waiting in line to see Santa to the distress evident in Santa&#39;s dialogue upon seeing the tabby cat. Here, Davis weaves a tapestry of comedy that intrigues readers, prompting them to speculate about the wild and whimsical antics that could have prompted Santa to resort to such a drastic response.





 1  A Lasagna Sort of Christmas 
Published December 24, 1978


 







This particular entry is the pinnacle of comedic brilliance and also pays homage to Garfield&#39;s unwavering love for lasagna. The crux of the humor lies in the dialogue delivered by Santa Claus, who scolds himself for nearly overlooking Garfield&#39;s present, musing aloud, &#34;How could I ever forget Garfield… only kid in the world to ask for 20 pounds of lasagna.&#34;
The sheer absurdity of Garfield&#39;s wish takes center stage, provoking laughter at the audacity of the cat asking for such an extravagant quantity of lasagna. This comic showcases the festive spirit with Santa&#39;s presence and pays homage to the enduring and beloved running gag of Garfield&#39;s insatiable appetite for lasagna.
