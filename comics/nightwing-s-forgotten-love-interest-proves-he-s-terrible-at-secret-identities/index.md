## Literature Review

Nightwing has a vast array of women with whom he&#39;s been romantically involved, but one consistent pattern is how he handles his secret identity.





Summary

  Nightwing struggles to keep his secret identity from romantic partners, as a former love interest in Titans: Beast World #3 reveals she knew his secret.   This is not the first time Nightwing has failed to keep his identity a secret from someone he loves, as previous love interests have also discovered the truth.   Nightwing&#39;s need for love often overcomes his need for secrecy, leading to his secrets being exposed and his vulnerability increasing.  







The return of a former love interest points out just how bad Nightwing is at keeping his secret identity from his romantic partners. Nightwing has had plenty of romances throughout DC&#39;s history, and his life before reuniting with Batgirl has given him a misconceived reputation as a playboy. Perhaps he&#39;s dipped his toes in the love pit one too many times, because a lovelorn Nightwing has often neglected his biggest secret.

DC reveals that a returning and former Nightwing love interest knew his secret identity years ago in Titans: Beast World #3 by Tom Taylor, Lucas Meyer, Romulo Fajardo Jr., and Wes Abbott, where she is lending a hand at Titans Tower. Dr. Bridget Clancy is a local Blüdhaven physician who met Dick when she was the superintendent of his apartment building during his 1990s solo title. The two had a will-they-won&#39;t-they dynamic that never materialized into anything permanent.

          




Clancy has made sporadic appearances since then, but this is by far her most significant return, as she tells Dick for the first time that she has long known that he&#39;s Nightwing. While the moment is shocking, Dr. Clancy isn&#39;t the first would-be romance of Nightwing&#39;s to discover his secret identity.

                  Nightwing&#39;s New Love Triangle Was Just Resolved in the Darkest Way Possible   Nightwing has found himself in a love triangle, but before he has to sort his feelings out, things are resolved in the darkest way possible.   


 Nightwing&#39;s Past &#39;90s Love Interest Clancy Returns 
          

Clancy makes her return in this issue when Dick calls her up to Titans Tower to examine Batman after he transforms into a wolf — much like other DC heroes, who are transforming into monstrous animals during the Beast World event. Concerned about Nightwing&#39;s injuries, she asks if he can remove his mask in order to check for a concussion. He refuses until she assures him her secret is safe with her by calling him Dick. She confirms for a shocked Dick that, for all the years they lived in the same apartment building, she &#34;caught a few things&#34; during her night shift. She also lets him know that though he&#39;s careful, he&#39;s not infallible.




This wouldn&#39;t be the first time Nightwing failed to keep a secret identity a true secret from the woman he loves. In Nightwing #62 by Dan Jurgens, Ronan Cliquet, Nick Filardi, and ANDWORLD Design, during his time living as Ric Grayson, he decides to come clean about both his present and his past to his then-girlfriend, Bea. Not only does he tell her he&#39;s a superhero, but that he used to be Batman&#39;s sidekick. Time would tell that Bea, another of Nightwing&#39;s forgotten love interests, was harboring some secrets of her own, but that didn&#39;t keep their relationship going for long. There are other examples, of course, such as Cheyenne Freemont, who also learned Dick&#39;s identity on her own.



 Nightwing Lets Love Overcome His Need for Secrecy 
          

Batman&#39;s most painful lesson is that it&#39;s almost impossible to balance a normal love life with vigilantism. Bruce was proven right when Nightwing realized he needed to walk away from Bea to protect her. Maybe that&#39;s why he lets knowledge of his secret identity slip away so easily time and time again: because he&#39;s overcome by love. Either he&#39;s distracted by trying to make his romances work, or secrets slip through the cracks the harder he tries to create a balance. Thankfully, he&#39;s settled with another vigilante to make that balance easier, but Nightwing still only makes himself more emotionally exposed the deeper he falls in love.
