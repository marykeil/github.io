## Literature Review

Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3 will see the titular monsters attacking Peach Momoko&#39;s enchanting folktale Momokoverse.




The horrifying, gruesome universe of Marvel Zombies is back in an all-new anthology, and Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3 is headed for the bright and vibrant world of Peach Momoko&#39;s beloved Momokoverse. The Marvel Zombies franchise is a fascinating and cruel take on the complex Marvel Universe, and Momoko&#39;s Demon Days is the perfect setting for a bloody alternate-universe collision.




The original Marvel Zombies series sees the heroes of the Marvel Universe devolve into bloodthirsty monsters, devouring the cosmos with their insatiable hunger, and this new anthology series is providing a more intimate and personal glimpse into this brutal world.



          

Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3 features a Peach Momoko story set in &#34;a mystical forest full of gods and monsters,&#34; as well as a terrifying cover by Peach that highlights her character Juju, Momoko&#39;s folktale adaptation of the X-Men&#39;s iconic Jubilee, from Demon Days: X-Men #1.


 Marvel Zombies Is Coming To Devour The Momokoverse 
          




Peach Momoko&#39;s Momokoverse is a breathtakingly fresh take on the Marvel Universe, weaving beloved heroes and villains into Japanese folklore while providing inspiring messages on hope, friendship, and identity. Momoko is known for her adorably cute yet simultaneously truly horrifying watercolor art - like her recent Nightmare Variant covers for Marvel - making a Marvel Zombies story set in the Momokoverse truly fateful. The synopsis for Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3 offers very little about the plot of Momoko&#39;s zombie tale, but there is a chance it could include characters from both Demon Days and Demon Wars.

The sequel to Demon Days - the brilliant Demon Wars - saw Momoko&#39;s main character Mariko Yashida traveling to the forest world of the yokai to claim her destiny as a descendant of the powerful Oni King, partnering with various folktale creatures and gods to battle demons and monsters. Juju, a town mystic who uses magic and science to protect her village, has only been seen in Demon Days: X-Men, but was a brilliant adaptation of the hot-headed and youthful Jubilee. While Demon Days: X-Men took place many years before Mariko&#39;s tale, it would be amazing to see Juju somehow team up with Mariko in this zombie attack, or work with new Momoko Marvel adaptations.






 The Momokoverse Is Used To Dealing With Monstrous Threats 
          

Peach&#39;s ever-expanding Momokoverse is home to a wide variety of terrifying ghouls and goblins, including warped versions of iconic villains like Venom and Carnage, so the denizens of the universe are no strangers to vicious monsters. The Momokoverse is known for transforming classic characters into Japanese folktale counterparts, so it stands to reason that the zombies in Peach&#39;s gorgeous cover for the issue will be a yokai of some sort. While Peach Momoko could create an entirely new type of zombie yokai, she may also draw inspiration from folklore ghosts like the rotting graveyard Nuppeppō or the Hone onna, also called &#34;bone women.&#34;

Peach Momoko&#39;s brilliant Momokoverse is filled with adorable but fierce heroes, who will defend their land and people to the last breath, meaning the Marvel Zombies will have their work cut out for them if they want to destroy this magical forest. Whether the zombies go up against Juju, Mariko Yashida, Elektra, Sai, the Iron Samurai, or any other hero from the Momokoverse, Peach&#39;s unique universe won&#39;t go down without a brutal fight.




Marvel Zombies: Black, White &amp; Blood #3 from Marvel Comics debuts on December 13th, 2023.
