# Captain Marvel s Son is Enduring the Grossest Zombie Transformation


## SUMMARY 



  Genis-Vell, the son of original Captain Marvel, and third to bear the moniker, has been transformed into a disturbing, mindless zombie by Omen.   The physical changes in Genis-Vell are as revolting as the mental changes, in what is a disgusting, tragic fate for an underrated character.   Captain Marvel is unable to reach Genis-Vell, who is under Omen&#39;s control, suggesting he may be gone for good.

## Literature Review

One former Captain Marvel has been zombified, and as a result, is going through the most &#34;disgusting&#34; metamorphosis as part of his transformation.




Warning: Spoilers for Captain Marvel #2!The son of Captain Marvel is going through one of the most disgusting zombie transformations ever seen in the Marvel Universe. Genis-Vel, son of Mar-Vell (the original Captain Marvel) was the third person to ever use the illustrious codename. He&#39;s resurfaced recently, albeit under the control of Carol Danvers&#39; new rival, Omen.




Captain Marvel #2 – written by Alyssa Wong, with art by Jan Bazaloua, Bryan Valenza, and VC&#39;s Ariana Maher – presented readers with the full extent of Genis-Vell&#39;s latest transformation. It has become all the more apparent after this issue that Omen has turned Genis-Vell into some sort of practically mindless zombie with only two things on his mind: getting back the Nega-Bands and serving Omen.

          

In addition, the issue showcases how Genis-Vell&#39;s new transformation is just as physical as it is mental for the character. While the mental changes are disturbing to witness unfold for a formerly beloved hero, the physical changes are flat-out disgusting.

                  Carol Danvers Officially Proves Why She&#39;s the Best Captain Marvel   Carol Danvers proves that she&#39;s the best to wear the Captain Marvel mantle by defeating one of the heroes who previously held that role.   





 The Third Captain Marvel Has Become A Zombie 
          

Genis-Vell first resurfaced in the previous issue, Captain Marvel #1, where he fought off Omen in her violent pursuit of the Nega-Bands. He was seemingly killed after she cuts off his band-wielding hands, followed by shoving a spear through his chest. Omen didn&#39;t get what she came after him for, however, as Captain Marvel&#39;s new sidekick, Yuna Yang, acquired the Nega-Bands for herself. In the process, this created a psychic link between herself and Carol Danvers. To compensate for being outmatched, Omen revives Genis-Vell, using her magic to turn him into her own personal minion, despite the gaping hole in his chest.

In Captain Marvel #2, the freshly reanimated Genis-Vell&#39;s first task in his hunt for the Nega-Bands is attacking Yuna&#39;s university where he wreaks havoc until Captain Marvel intervenes. Genis-Vell starts getting his backside handed to him by his successor, until Omen arrives as his backup, doing so by unconventional – and uncomfortable – means possible. Omen enters the fray by using the hole in Genis-Vell&#39;s chest as a portal. &#34;Okay, that&#39;s disgusting,&#34; says Yuna, understandably so. Throughout their fight with Captain Marvel, Omen is constantly echoing out of Genis-Vell&#39;s chest to assist him in the battle, in Marvel&#39;s most unique, and disturbing, take on zombies yet.






 Captain Marvel&#39;s Son Suffers An Undeserved Fate 
          

Captain Marvel #2 goes out of its way to showcase just how far gone Genis-Vell is at this point. He is fully corrupted by Omen&#39;s magic, and there is nothing that Carol can say, or do, to get through to him. Only time will tell if it would even be possible, at this point, to undo what Omen has done to Genis-Vell. In any case, it is a tragedy for longtime fans to witness, having come to respect the character during his hero run. His time as Captain Marvel is underrated in a lot of ways, and now, unfortunately, the hero has nonetheless been reduced to a puppet in Omen&#39;s game.



Captain Marvel #2 is on sale now from Marvel.
