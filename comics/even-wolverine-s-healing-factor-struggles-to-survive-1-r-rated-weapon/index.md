# Even Wolverine s Healing Factor Struggles to Survive 1 R-Rated Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  Wolverine&#39;s healing factor is put to the ultimate test when faced with the Predator&#39;s R-rated acid spray.   The acid spray melts Wolverine&#39;s face, leaving him unconscious and requiring the help of Weapon X scientists to make a full recovery.   The implications of Wolverine&#39;s vulnerability to acid raise concerns for his survival against Xenomorphs in a potential future crossover with the Alien franchise.

## Literature Review

Wolverine&#39;s healing factor has saved his life more times than fans can count, but it nearly failed him after going up against one R-rated weapon! 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Predator vs Wolverine #3 Wolverine’s healing factor is strong enough to bring him back from the brink of death, no matter the extent of the injury (unless it’s immediately fatal). However, this life-saving ability has just been put to the test in a way that it never has before, as Wolverine has finally come across one weapon that he has some major trouble surviving - a weapon that is decidedly R-rated.




This weapon in question was used by the Predator who’s been hunting Wolverine throughout the ongoing Marvel Comics/20th Century Studios crossover series Predator vs Wolverine. In issue #3 (by Benjamin Percy, Ken Lashley, Juan Fernandez, Kei Zama, and Hayden Sherman), the Predator tracks Wolverine to the infamous Weapon X facility, where it discovers a hidden gem associated with this particular hunt: Wolverine’s adamantium skeleton.

          

This Predator decides that the trophy is worth more than the hunt, and instead of allowing Wolverine to escape only to track, fight, and hopefully kill him, the Predator sprays Logan in the face with acid - and it very nearly gave this crossover series a swift, grim end.

After his face was melted, Wolverine was taken onto the Predator ship, where it took him a long time to even regain consciousness, much less make a full recovery. Then, it was only due to the berserker rage surging through him from the Weapon X experimentation that gave him the strength he needed to escape. And he still wouldn’t even make a full recovery without the help of the Weapon X scientists, meaning this is an injury Wolverine may not have actually survived if it was left to his healing factor alone (especially since it was paired with him falling from a spaceship, and burning up through Earth’s atmosphere).

This isn’t the first time a Predator has used this acid spray in an attempt to kill someone, as it did the very same thing against the guards at the Weapon X facility to get to Wolverine in the previous issue. The grotesque visual of a victim’s face being melted off their skull while they die screaming is enough to classify this brutal weapon as being R-rated, though the implications of its effectiveness against Wolverine could be detrimental for the X-Men hero, assuming the Predator is not the only alien killer from its corner of the multiverse to cross over with Marvel.

The Alien and Predator franchises have become so intertwined that many fans just assume one comes with the other, especially when it comes to the comics. While the films have maintained a clear separation between them - even establishing a completely secluded Alien vs Predator franchise to keep the continuities straight - the comics have been way less strict in that regard, especially Predator and Alien comics published by Dark Horse Comics. Though Alien and Predator haven’t established a shared continuity under 20th Century Studios quite yet, it seems like an inevitability, at which point the Xenomorph will be free to venture into the Marvel Universe just like the Yautja. When that happens, and the Xenomorph goes toe-to-toe with Wolverine (which was even teased on a Wolverine variant cover), fans know that he may not survive getting hit with the creature’s acid blood, if this is his reaction to the Predator’s acid spray.




Regardless of any potential conflict with Alien’s Xenomorphs, Wolverine is currently in the thick of it with a bloodthirsty Predator hellbent on adding Logan’s adamantium skeleton to its vast collection of trophies. And this issue reveals that the Predator may very well succeed, as even Wolverine’s healing factor struggles to survive one of the Predator’s R-rated weapons.

Predator vs Wolverine #3 by 20th Century Studios is available now.
