## Literature Review

Wonder Girl Cassie Sandsmark returns to her &#39;90s roots with the perfect new costume, bringing back the spunk that defined her character.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Wonder Woman #5!




Wonder Girl Cassie Sandsmark, daughter of Zeus and former Teen Titan, makes a bold return with a kickass costume that seamlessly blends street-wear vibes with a nostalgic &#39;90s aesthetic. Having originally debuted in 1996 in Wonder Woman Vol 2 #105 by John Byrne and Patricia Mulvihill, it&#39;s only fitting for her to embrace her roots in this revival.

In Wonder Woman #5 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, Wonder Girls Cassie Sandsmark, Donna Troy, and Yara Flor attempt to shoehorn themselves into Diana&#39;s unfolding battle against a world turned against her. Despite their good intentions, Wonder Woman adamantly rejects their help, fearing for their safety in a fight she considers her own.

          

The Wonder Girls, undeterred, propose separate challenges to Diana, vying for the opportunity to fight alongside her and provide assistance. It&#39;s during Cassie&#39;s interactions with Diana that readers are treated to a glimpse of her new costume.

Similar to her fellow Wonder Girls, Cassie opts for a unique challenge with significant consequences: winning would secure her a place alongside Diana in battle, while defeat would compel her to swear an oath to the gods, promising not to intervene and let Wonder Woman confront her battles alone. Cassie, staying true to her character, proposes an arm wrestling competition at a bar as her chosen challenge. It&#39;s at this venue that readers get the best view of Wonder Girl&#39;s new costume.

Cassie has bid farewell to her familiar skirt-sweatshirt combination, and the change is undoubtedly for the better. Her new look is a nostalgic delight for fans who adore this version of Wonder Girl. The ensemble exudes &#39;90s vibes, featuring a jean jacket adorned with patches and a turtleneck crop top. Young Justice fans may recognize the turtleneck, reminiscent of Cassie&#39;s signature look in the final arc of the animated TV series. Also notable is the first panel highlighted in this article, which showcases a leggings-and-denim-jacket combo, the epitome of &#39;90s fashion, ranking among Cassie&#39;s best outfits to date.

 Wonder Girl May Be Bringing Her New Look to Amazons Attack 


          

Wonder Girl&#39;s new costume isn&#39;t confined to King&#39;s run alone. In a variant cover for the upcoming Amazons Attack #5, Cassie is seen donning a similar outfit, hinting at two significant possibilities. Firstly, and most importantly, Cassie might be making her debut in Josie Campbell and Vasco Georgiev&#39;s Amazons Attack comic run. Secondly, Cassie&#39;s fresh look is set to grace this run despite being crafted by a different writer and artist. Whatever the case, it&#39;s clear that Wonder Girl is making a stylish comeback in the DC Universe.
