## Literature Review

DC Comics confirms with one throwaway line that Batman is not, in fact, the scariest member of the Justice League, and he never really was.





Summary

  Wonder Woman is revealed to be the scariest member of the Justice League, with no exploitable weaknesses and the ability to become unstoppable when enraged.   Despite being known as a warrior princess, Wonder Woman is an agent of peace who prefers to avoid violence if possible.   The Birds of Prey&#39;s confrontation with Wonder Woman on Themyscira is bound to be terrifying for them, as she has every right to be angry with them for infiltrating her home.  







Most fans might assume that Batman is the scariest member of the Justice League, but that&#39;s not actually true. It turns out the scariest member is actually Wonder Woman, as confirmed by her ally Black Canary.

Readers can see exactly how terrifying Wonder Woman can be in Birds of Prey #3 by Kelly Thompson, Leonardo Romero, Jordie Bellaire, and Clayton Cowles. This issue has Black Canary and her Birds of Prey landing on Themyscira, looking for Dinah&#39;s sister Sin. Since they&#39;re infiltrating the island of the Amazons, they naturally don&#39;t want Wonder Woman to be aware. Green Arrow holds Wonder Woman back for a few moments, but she does eventually make it to Themyscira to battle the Birds.



          

It&#39;s here that Dinah admits people are afraid of Batman and even Superman â€” and they should be. But Black Canary thinks there&#39;s one unexpected hero everyone should fear: Wonder Woman. As Dinah says, &#34;Everyone just loves Diana. As they should. They should also be very, very afraid.&#34;




 : Wonder Woman&#39;s Forgotten Power Is Too Strong To Ever Bring Back


 Wonder Woman Is a Terrifying Justice League Member 
          

The Justice League is full of some extremely powerful individuals, including characters like Superman and Martian Manhunter, who can literally move mountains with ease. Still, the most powerful member of the League is Wonder Woman. While Superman and Martian Manhunter are powerful, they have very clear and defined weaknesses. Superman loses his powers if he doesn&#39;t have enough yellow sunlight, and he can also be harmed through either magic or Kryptonite. Martian Manhunter can famously be defeated pretty easily by simply using large amounts of fire. But Wonder Woman has absolutely no exploitable weaknesses at all.

Wonder Woman isn&#39;t an easy character to anger. While some might like to portray Wonder Woman as a warrior princess, she is first and foremost an agent of peace. While Diana is extremely capable of violence, she is ultimately someone who doesn&#39;t want to use violence if it can be avoided. The only reason she fights Green Arrow at all in this issue is because he attacked first, using weaponry that could potentially cause her harm. While it&#39;s especially difficult to enrage Wonder Woman, once it is done, she&#39;s just about unstoppable, which is also being made clear in the new ongoing Wonder Woman title by Tom King and Daniel Sampere. An evil Batman or Superman is definitely scary, but an enraged Wonder Woman is downright terrifying.






 Can the Birds of Prey Take Down Wonder Woman? 
          

With the Birds of Prey attacking Themyscira, even if for a noble reason, Wonder Woman has every right to be angry with them. While it&#39;s clear she&#39;ll do everything she can to avoid hurting any of them, there&#39;s no doubt that a confrontation between Wonder Woman and the Birds of Prey is going to be terrifying for the Birds. People fear Batman and Superman for different reason, but Black Canary is about to see firsthand exactly why Wonder Woman is the scariest member of the Justice League.
