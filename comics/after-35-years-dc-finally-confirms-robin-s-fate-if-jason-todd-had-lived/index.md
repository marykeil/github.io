## Literature Review

When Robin died, it was the end of Jason Toddâ€™s hero career. But an alternate look at history reveals what his fate could have looked like.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #428: Robin Lives!Decades after the infamous &#34;Death in the Family&#34; storyline, DC Comics has finally confirmed how Jason Todd&#39;s life would have gone had Robin survived his harrowing ordeal. Batman #428 ended the second Boy Wonder&#39;s career, but an unpublished story suggests nothing would have changed had the lad lived through the experience.




In Batman #428: Robin Lives! by Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo, Batman searches through the rubble for Robin, who was left trapped in an exploding building. After Batman finds Sheila Haywood right before she dies, he notices Jason Todd&#39;s body not too far away. However, the Boy Wonder is amazingly still clinging to life.



          

Batman gets Jason to a hospital, but unfortunately, the trauma has left the young hero comatose. Dick Grayson visits the hospital to check on Batman and Robin and offers his service to his former mentor. Nightwing&#39;s offer is rebuffed as Batman says he&#39;ll handle the case by himself explicitly stating &#34;That&#39;s the way I want it from now on.&#34;.


 Even if He Lived, &#34;Death in the Family&#34; Was it For Jason Todd as Robin 
          




The death of Jason Todd was the result of one of the most notorious marketing gimmicks in comic books. During the &#34;Death in the Family&#34; storyline, Robin was beaten by the Joker and left to die in an exploding warehouse. DC Comics left the direction of the story in the hands of readers by letting them vote on whether Jason would meet his maker or not. The poll received thousands of votes and by a margin of just 72 votes, the second Robin&#39;s fate was sealed. When Batman #428 originally came out, it was confirmed that Jason died in the explosion, an event that changed DC history forever.

The interesting thing about this alternate version of Batman #428 is that the scene where Bruce swears off ever working with anyone else is remarkably similar to one from the original comic. Instead of being in a hospital talking with Nightwing, Bruce is in the Batcave talking to Alfred. When Alfred offers to call Dick for assistance, Bruce tells Alfred that he no longer wants any help. In the original story, it seemed like Batman was so shaken by the events that he couldn&#39;t fathom the idea of taking on another partner. But even if Jason lived, Bruce was never going to let him resume his role as Robin.






 Batman Couldn&#39;t Risk Jason or Anyone Else Getting Hurt 
          

It&#39;s always been a question of how DC history would have looked had Jason lived. Had the vote gone the other way, some fans assumed he&#39;d have continued to carry the Robin mantle (after properly processing his trauma, of course). But Bruce was no more pleased to see Jason alive than he was to see him dead. Either way, Batman recognized he failed his partner and Bruce was always going to make the necessary change to his operation to prevent anything like this from ever happening again. Unfortunately for Jason Todd, his Robin career was done the moment the Joker got a hold of him.

Batman #428: Robin Lives! is on sale now from DC Comics.
