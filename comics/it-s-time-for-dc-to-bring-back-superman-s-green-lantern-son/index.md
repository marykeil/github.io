# It s Time for DC to Bring Back Superman s Green Lantern Son


## SUMMARY 



  DC&#39;s Elseworlds imprint is making a comeback, presenting the opportunity to revisit the concept of Superman&#39;s Green Lantern son from Superman: Distant Fires.   The story of Superman: Distant Fires was set in a post-apocalyptic world, and featured Superman and Wonder Woman becoming romantically involved, resulting in a son named Bruce.   Fans have been waiting for a follow-up to Superman: Distant Fires for 25 years; the new Elseworlds series presents the ideal opportunity to explore the development of Bruce Kent as a Green Lantern.

## Literature Review

The 1998 Elseworlds one-shot Superman: Distant Fires ended with a gutpunch of a parallel to the Man of Steel&#39;s origin, and a host of possibilities.




With the return of DC&#39;s Elseworlds imprint, the company has the perfect opportunity to return to one of its most exciting unexplored concepts: Superman&#39;s Green Lantern son from Superman: Distant Fires. With the Superman Family expanding in recent years, DC could bring the character into its main continuity; alternatively, it could return to the world of Distant Fires for a sequel, following up on the one-shot&#39;s dramatic conclusion.




Published in 1998, Superman: Distant Fires was written by Howard Chaykin, with art by Kevin Nowlan. The story ended with a dramatic parallel to Superman&#39;s origins, as he sent his son away from a dying Earth, just as he was sent off Krypton before its destruction.



          

The gamechanging difference is that, in this case, Superman used Green Lantern technology to save his son, setting up a thrilling character, who has yet to be developed further in the twenty-five years since Distant Fires was released.

DC announced at New York Comic-Con that its Elseworlds imprint will return for the first time since 2010, starting with &#34;World War V,&#34; the latest installment in the company&#39;s DC vs. Vampires alternate continuity. Other titles confirmed for the relaunch so far include Batman the Barbarian and Green Lantern: Dark.




Superman: Distant Fires begins and ends with tragedy. A nuclear conflagration leads to civilization being wiped out, with most of the world&#39;s population being killed. As is requisite for a post-apocalyptic story, there are some survivors, and these few must fight to try to re-establish order from the chaotic aftermath. Among the survivors are several of DC&#39;s greatest heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman, who in the course of the story become involved romantically. This is a relationship many DC fans have clamored for over the decades, and until things go horribly wrong at Distant Fires&#39; climax, it is a satisfying portrayal of them as a couple, their love forged amidst the greatest of adversity.

Their union produces a son named Bruce, in honor of their late friend and colleague. Any hope of raising their son together is shattered when Wonder Woman is killed by a deranged Captain Marvel, who is in turn killed during a clash with Superman; not by the Man of Steel, but rather by the powers that grant the Captain his powers themselves. Soon after, Superman realizes the destruction of the Earth is imminent, and having acquired the Power Ring from a deceased Green Lantern, he fashions an escape pod for his son. Superman: Distant Fires ends with Bruce Kent being sent into space, the Last Son of Earth leaving behind the Last Son of Krypton.

DC&#39;s Elseworlds began in 1989 with Gotham by Gaslight, written by Brian Augustyn, with art by Mike Mignola, featuring the crimefighting adventures Bruce Wayne in a Victorian-era Gotham, as Batman faces off against Jack the Ripper.




The concept of Superman and Wonder Woman&#39;s son, wielding the power of a Green Lantern, is one that would supercharge fans&#39; excitement. It is a wonder that DC has not followed up on the ending of Superman: Distant Fires in the two-and-a-half decades since the one-shot came out. Bruce Kent is a character most DC fans would be thrilled to spend more time with; the upcoming slate of Elseworlds titles already includes a sequel to iconic Elseworlds title Gotham by Gaslight, tantalizingly subtitled The Kryptonian Age, meaning that more follow-ups to classic Elseworlds stories could be in DC&#39;s plans, and certainly should be.




In the main continuity, recent years have seen the Superman Family expanding, and it would certainly be exciting to see Bruce Kent hop the multiverse and interact with his quasi-siblings, like Jon Kent. However, even more exciting are the exciting possibilities for a sequel to Superman: Distant Fires. The potential of a fully-grown Bruce Kent traversing the universe as a Green Lantern is limitless. He could find an adopted home planet, in another parallel to his father&#39;s origin, and become its protector. Alternatively, he could encounter another Green Lantern and become a full-fledged member of the Corps. From the ending of Distant Fires, a whole new corner of the DC Universe could spring.
