# 10 Best Devil Fruit Powers in One Piece


## SUMMARY 


 The Glare-Glare Fruit eaten by Viola only has a few uses in battle, but its power is excellent for espionage purposes since it gives the user clairvoyant and telepathic abilities. 
 The Bird-Bird Fruit, Model: Phoenix is used by Marco in aerial combat, and is one of the few Devil Fruits with a healing ability. 
 While the Rumble-Rumble Fruit is weak against the Gomu-Gomu Fruit, it is much more versatile and has many more functions.

## Literature Review

These Devil Fruit abilities are great for several reasons including their function, resourcefulness, and capacity for growth.




One Piece is a fantasy anime with a unique power system known as Devil Fruits. Though Haki, essentially a manifestation of one&#39;s spiritual energy, has risen to prominence in the series recently, it is the Devil Fruits that are truly iconic. These mysterious objects grant their users special powers and are known to be one-of-a-kind, with each one having a different ability. Eating the fruit also comes with some limitations, particularly the weakness to seawater and the unpredictability of the power.
Devil Fruits are categorized into the diverse Paramecia-type, the animal-transforming Zoan-type, and the elemental Logia-type. Apart from one notable exception in Blackbeard, a person can only eat one Devil fruit. While the resulting power often depends on the user&#39;s ability to harness it, some functions are limited despite their strength. An example comes with Charlotte Katakuri&#39;s Mochi-Mochi Fruit, whose weak powers are used to their full extent, but still have many limitations. However, there are some Devil Fruits in One Piece that stand out not just for their power, but their versatility, usefulness in combat, growth potential, and users&#39; ability to harness them.

 10  Hollow-Hollow Fruit 
Current User: Perona
        

The Hollow-Hollow Fruit is first seen in Thriller Bark, where it&#39;s used by Perona to conjure ghost-like apparitions called Hollows. These creatures can pass through people to fill them with negativity and can attack them with shockwave explosions. One of the fruit&#39;s most interesting features is the way it allows its user to link their consciousness to the Hollows. Perona is seen using these abilities for astral projection and information gathering, and post-time skip, can fly without having to leave her body. However, the power has some weaknesses, including the way Hollows are useless against extremely negative targets and how the user is vulnerable to attacks when linking their consciousness. Despite this, the Hollow-Hollow Fruit is an excellent support ability.





 9  Time-Time Fruit 
Current User: Unknown, Formerly used by Kozuki Toki
        

The Time-Time Fruit allows its user to control time, which is a power that people have coveted for ages. However, this comes with several limitations, since they can only use the fruit to travel forward in time, and can&#39;t use it to teleport to a specific location. The Devil Fruit originally belonged to Kozuki Toki, who used it to travel centuries into the future where she married Kozuki Oden and had two children with him. After Toki died in One Piece, the fruit returned to circulation, and its whereabouts are currently unknown. What makes this power special is its potential in battle, where it can be used to evade attacks or escape from a threatening situation. Based on how Toki teleported her son into the future, the ability also works on other people.





 8  Tremor-Tremor Fruit 
Current User: Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard), Formerly used by Edward Newgate (Whitebeard)
        

The Tremor-Tremor Fruit is considered the most powerful Paramecia-type Devil Fruit in One Piece. It&#39;s made famous by its former user, Whitebeard, and later by Blackbeard, who gains the fruit after his death. The fruit gives its users the ability to generate vibrations through any material, essentially causing earthquakes and tsunamis. They can also &#34;pull&#34; on any medium, including air, and can concentrate their power onto a single point. While it&#39;s extremely powerful in combat with only a few known weaknesses, the fruit also has limited uses apart from combat. One major problem is that its effects aren&#39;t limited to a single target and will affect everyone in its path. However, Armament Haki can cancel the vibrations in specific areas.

While One Piece sports a massive ensemble cast, each of their powers are unique and differ in interesting ways. However, a few stand out.








 7  Glare-Glare Fruit 
Current User: Viola
        

The Glare-Glare Fruit allows its user to see through anything if they form circles with their thumb and index finger and place them over their eyes. These &#34;glasses&#34; can literally look into someone&#39;s skeleton or read their mind and memories. The fruit also has clairvoyant and telepathic abilities and can transform its user&#39;s tears into projectiles during battle. It&#39;s used by Viola, the princess of Dressrosa to scan her targets for hidden threats. The power proves especially useful when she goes undercover as a member of the Donquixote Pirates and helps convince Doflamingo to spare her father&#39;s life. Overall, this Glare-Glare Fruit provides an excellent power with no known weaknesses.





 6  Magma-Magma Fruit 
Current User: Sakazuki (Akainu)
        

The Magma-Magma Fruit stands out as one of the most powerful Logia-type Devil Fruits. It&#39;s used by Sakazuki and is seen in a truly destructive capacity during the war at Marineford. The Magma-Magma allows the user to control magma, which includes turning their body into the element. This fruit is generally considered to be superior to the Flame-Flame Fruit, which allows the user to manipulate fire, due to its ability to overpower the flames. The magma is extremely hot and incredibly explosive, allowing its user to inflict serious damage upon targets. Sakazuki also uses his power for transport by mimicking a volcanic explosion and launching himself to his desired location.





 5  Bird-Bird Fruit, Model: Phoenix 
Current User: Marco
        

This variant of the Bird-Bird Fruit allows its user to transform into a phoenix. A mythical Zoan-type, it&#39;s used by Marco for both transportation and combat purposes, having regeneration abilities like the bird of legend. When the user transforms, they emit bright blue flames that allow them to heal themselves or others from injury and disease. The flames are also able to withstand the heat of the Magma-Magma Fruit. The phoenix form alters the user&#39;s physiology and allows them to deliver powerful attacks in combat. It&#39;s a powerful and versatile Devil Fruit ability that can be used for offensive, defensive, and support purposes. This is also one of the few abilities in the series with healing properties.





 4  Dark-Dark Fruit 
Current User: Marshall D. Teach (Blackbeard)
        

The Dark-Dark Fruit has an ability that&#39;s said to be the most evil in the series. Its current user, Blackbeard, gained his abilities by murdering his former crewmate and stealing the fruit. The Dark-Dark Fruit allows the user to control darkness, and by extension, gravity, absorbing everything in its path. One of the fruit&#39;s unique skills, however, is its capacity to nullify the abilities of other Devil Fruits by simply touching the user and absorbing their power. This is also its biggest weakness, since the user is vulnerable to the darkness, and must time their attacks accordingly. It&#39;s also worth noting that, despite being a Logia fruit, it doesn&#39;t allow its user to transform into an elemental state.

 3  Gum-Gum Fruit 
Current User: Monkey D. Luffy


 







The Devil Fruit used by the series&#39; protagonist was originally called the Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika, and classified as a Mythical Zoan. It&#39;s accidentally eaten by Luffy as a child and lets him take on the properties of rubber. The Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika also allows its user to withstand electrical acts since their body is an insulator, while their flexibility lets them survive otherwise fatal attacks. Luffy is seen creatively using the power, and once the devil fruit is awakened, can alter his physique without inflating his body. The fruit is among the most powerful in the series and only has a few limitations, including the distance the user can stretch and the time it takes for their limbs to retract.





 2  Rumble-Rumble Fruit 
Current User: Enel


 







Once considered invincible, the Rumble-Rumble Fruit is a Logia-type that allows its user to control lightning. It was eaten by Enel, who used his power to rule over Skypeia. Despite the fruit&#39;s weakness to insulators like rubber, it&#39;s more versatile and well-rounded than the Gum-Gum Fruit. It grants extreme power to its user and lets them travel at the speed of lightning, dodging attacks instantaneously. The user can use their electricity for both close-range and long-range attacks and can manipulate the weather to produce lightning storms. But the fruit&#39;s usefulness doesn&#39;t end there, since it allows the user to perform other electrical functions, including medical ones like restarting a heart. Overall, the Devil Fruit has an overwhelming potential for growth.





 1  Op-Op Fruit 
Current User: Trafalgar D. Water Law


 







The Op-Op Fruit is called the &#34;Ultimate Devil Fruit&#34; and is highly coveted for its ability to grant eternal youth. The fruit has numerous functions and allows its user to produce a force field (called &#34;ROOM&#34; by Law) to &#34;surgically&#34; manipulate everything inside it, including abstract concepts like personalities. However, the fruit&#39;s most remarkable traits are its medical properties, which allow it to cure any illness, as demonstrated by its user, Trafalgar Law. Once the fruit is awakened, it allows the user to produce ROOMs without having to be inside them. Despite the ability&#39;s limitations in range, movement, and stamina, it offers a lot of versatility and potential for growth, making it the best Devil Fruit in One Piece.
