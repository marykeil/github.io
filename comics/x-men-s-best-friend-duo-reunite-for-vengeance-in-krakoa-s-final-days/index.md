## Literature Review

Joshua Cassara&#39;s cover for X-Men #32 depicts Kate Pryde and Illyana Rasputina fighting Orchis together, finally reuniting X-Men&#39;s most beloved ship.  




Two of the most beloved X-Men heroes are finally being reunited in the mutants&#39; war against Orchis, with Shadowkat and Magik working together on a gorgeous new cover for X-Men #32. Kate Pryde and Illyana Rasputina&#39;s friendship has long been speculated to be romantic, and fans of the iconic queer X-Men heroes are incredibly excited to see them side-by-side again after a long time apart.




X-Men #32, from writer Gerry Duggan and artist Phil Noto, will see the fierce &#34;besties&#34; teaming up to take on a battle with Orchis, in the lead-up to Kieron Gillen&#39;s Fall of the House of X, which marks the beginning of the end for the Krakoan Era.

          

Joshua Cassara&#39;s stunning cover for X-Men #32 depicts Magik, her powers restored after Realm of X, and Kate Pryde, now operating as the violent vigilante Shadowkat, emerging out of one of Illyana&#39;s stepping discs armed with their epic swords, and also features Lockheed, Kate&#39;s alien dragon who hasn&#39;t been seen since before the Hellfire Gala. The solicit for X-Men #32 reveals:


Besties with bloody blades! Kate Pryde and Illyana Rasputin have been best friends for a long time. They’ve had good times, and they’ve had bad times. One thing they can always agree on? Stomping anti-mutant bigots’ heads.






 X-Men&#39;s Most Beloved Ship Is Finally Reunited In Their War Against Orchis 
          

The Krakoan Era of the X-Men has seen more visible canonical queer representation than ever before in Marvel Comics, or mainstream comics in general. From Betsy Braddock and Rachel Summers getting into a beautiful relationship, to Mystique and Destiny recently retconned as Nightcrawler&#39;s biological parents, to the introduction of new queer characters like Solem and Somnus, the X-Men Universe has never been more queer. The Krakoan Age also saw Kate and Illyana becoming canonically queer, with Gerry Duggan depicting Shadowkat kissing a female tattoo artist, confirming the hero&#39;s bisexuality.

For years fans have zeroed in on queer subtext throughout Kate and Illyana&#39;s friendship that has hinted their relationship was much more intimate than shown on panel. The iconic Chris Claremont subtly suggested a more intimate relationship between both Kate and Illyana and confirmed that his original plan was for Kate and Rachel Summers to be soulmates. With the modern era of Marvel Comics allowing queer subtext to become canon text, there is more room for exploration in the women&#39;s friendship. X-Men #32 would be a beautiful opportunity to make the romantic feelings between Magik and Shadowkat canon, allowing them to navigate their subtle attraction in the emotionally intense setting of their war against Orchis.






 Kate &amp; Illyana&#39;s Relationship Should Be Explored More 
          

Kate and Illyana&#39;s relationship is so fascinating because of their character&#39;s long, complex histories, as well as Kate&#39;s long-time romantic association with Colossus, brother to Magik. From Illyana and Kate being roommates at Xavier&#39;s after Magik returned from Limbo a teenager to Kate wielding Magik&#39;s infamous Soulsword after she &#34;died,&#34; their beautiful friendship has long been marked by moments of intimacy and deep connection. It is exciting to see Magik and Shadowkat teaming up again, because they have not worked closely together very often in the Krakoan Era, and it will be a blast to see these two iconic women bashing some fascists together.

Of course, it is also amazing to see Lockheed, a fierce and rambunctious character who deserves way more page time! While Cassara&#39;s cover of X-Men #32 doesn&#39;t hint at any romantic tension between the X-Men heroes, it seems clear that Duggan has an interest in exploring Kate&#39;s queerness, and it would be amazing to see Kate and Illyana share a moment of on-page intimacy while they wage war against the forces of Orchis.




X-Men #32 from Marvel Comics debuts in stores on March 6th, 2024.
