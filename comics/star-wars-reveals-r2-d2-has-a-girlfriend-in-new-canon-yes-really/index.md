Summary

  R2-D2 surprisingly has a girlfriend named Qutee, whom he reunites with in the new Dark Droids crossover.   Qutee was part of the original D-Squad, a special unit of droids during The Clone Wars, and seemingly shared a lasting bond with R2-D2.   Unfortunately, Qutee&#39;s fate is unknown as she was shot during a battle with Imperial droids in the recent issue, possibly leaving R2-D2 without his old flame.  







Star Wars&#39; new crossover has revealed that R2-D2 surprisingly has a girlfriend. In the original trilogy of Star Wars movies, the brave little astromech was busy helping the Rebellion fight the Empire. However, a more personal mission set between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi features Artoo reuniting with a past ally confirmed to be an old flame in the established Star Wars timeline.

Tying into the current Dark Droids crossover, the new D-Squad #3 from Marc Guggenheim and Salva Espín sees Artoo continuing to assemble droids all over the galaxy to save his friend and constant companion C-3PO. As seen in the main Dark Droids comic, the golden-plated protocol droid was one of the first droids corrupted by the sentient AI virus known as The Scourge. To that end, the latest addition to Artoo&#39;s new D-Squad is none other than QT-KT.

          




With Artoo and Qutee having known each other since the Clone Wars, the droid bounty hunter 4-LOM rightly deduces that the little astromechs are attracted to each other. Although unorthodox considering their shared droid status, emotions such as love have been displayed by droids in the Star Wars canon before (a prime example being Solo&#39;s L3-37 and her love for Lando Calrissian).

 R2-D2&#39;s Girlfriend Is An Old Flame From The Clone Wars 
Qutee Was Part Of The Original D-Squad
          

As seen during The Clone Wars season 5, R2-D2 and QT-KT were both part of a special unit of droids under the command of the Republic and Jedi Order to infiltrate a Separatist ship and steal a valuable encryption module, the original D-Squad. Qutee herself belonged to the Jedi Aayla Secura, much like Artoo was the loyal astromech of Anakin Skywalker. As such, it seems as though the pair formed a lasting bond, so much so that an attraction was apparently generated as much as their programming allowed.




To that end, it&#39;s understandable why Artoo would want Qutee to join his new D-Squad during the original trilogy. It&#39;s also pretty hilarious when Artoo gets defensive and flustered when probed by 4-LOM about his long-distance girlfriend, especially when it&#39;s confirmed he&#39;s kept up on her whereabouts despite having not seen her for years. Likewise, 4-LOM&#39;s theory is proven true when Artoo reunites with QT. There&#39;s clearly something between the two astromechs, though the mood is subsequently killed by Triple-Zero, the homicide droid Artoo surprisingly convinced to help save Threepio as well.

Artoo and Qutee&#39;s reunion was also cut short by the platoon of Imperial KX units and Darktoopers under the control of the Scourge. During the subsequent battle, Qutee was tragically shot during the firefight which closed out the issue with her fate unknown. While Qutee will hopefully survive to join the brand-new D-Squad in the Star Wars canon, it&#39;s quite entertaining that she&#39;s officially confirmed to be an old flame of Artoo&#39;s whom he never forgot despite their years apart.
