# The Expanse Reinvents the Rings  Powers in Game-Changing New Twist


## SUMMARY 



  Strange occurrences in The Expanse: Dragon Tooth #6 suggest that people &#34;die&#34; when they go through the Rings, supporting Dr. Okoye&#39;s theory.   The ghostly voices and locked rooms experienced by the Rocinante crew indicate that the protomolecule may be reaching out for help once more, as depicted previously on the TV series.   The situation is scarier than Holden&#39;s encounter with Miller, as the protomolecule can now seemingly take over the ship&#39;s systems, posing a greater threat than it did previously.

## Literature Review

The protomolecule once spoke to Holden via a dead friend; it&#39;s asking for help again, though now it has thousands of dead souls to speak through.

Spoilers for The Expanse: Dragon Tooth #6!




The Expanse: Dragon Tooth has already established that things get a little creepy around the Rings. In issue #6, it seems there really are ghosts in the machine. The Rocinante crew and the scientific research station they’re guarding are depicted hearing mysterious voices and getting locked into rooms with no explanation.

The Expanse: Dragon Tooth #6 – written by Andy Diggle, with art by Francesco Pisa – marks the midway point of Boom! Studios maxi-series, expanding on the lore of the popular sci-fi novels and television series, and pushing it in new directions.



          

In the previous issue, Dr. Elvi Okoye theorized that the Rings transport by scanning what goes through them, breaking it down, and spitting out an exact copy on the other side. If true, it would mean people &#34;die&#34; going into the Ring gates. The strange occurrences in Dragon Tooth #6 give weight to this theory, but also suggest the lost souls aren&#39;t traveling too far.




 : The Expanse: Dragon Tooth Just Introduced a Life-Changing Theory About the Ring Network


 Holden Has Heard Voices From The Ring Before 
The Protomolecule Raised The Dead For His Help
          

The Expanse: Dragon Tooth has been bridging the gap between where the first six books – and the TV series – left off and where the final three pick up, thirty years later. Because of that continuity, the first thing brought up about someone hearing voices is Holden&#39;s experiences with &#34;The Investigator.&#34; Throughout seasons three and four of the television version, Holden saw a vision of his dead friend, detective Joe Miller. Miller would speak to Holden only when he was alone, and often spoke cryptically; rather than explicitly warning him of a danger the Rocinante was facing, Miller would tell an old story from his police days about a partner who died similarly.




Both Holden and his crew thought he was going crazy, but his instincts turned out to be right, eventually opening up a brand new Ring gate in the Sol system and saving thousands of lives. Miller&#39;s ghost, dubbed &#34;the Investigator,&#34; was an abstract generated by the protomolecule, to use Holden to achieve its goal of opening the gate. He was not a supernatural manifestation of the person, but a sort of AI representative of him, taken from Holden&#39;s memories and manipulated to communicate what the protomolecule needed. The protomolecule itself was not a weapon or a disease, but a tool sent across the galaxy to create Ring gates and connect universes.



 The Protomolecule Has Thousands of Voices To Take 
It May Be Reaching Out For Help Again


          

The Eros Incident that created the Ring gate killed hundreds of thousands of people, who were docked on the asteroid as it crashed into the planet Venus. The dead scientist Dr. Cherniv recorded logs of himself that sounded like he was losing his mind, but to readers who remember what happened with Holden, it doesn&#39;t look all that different. His last words were, &#34;This place, I think it might be Hell,&#34; which are echoed in another voice when Naomi is locked alone with the Ring. Similar to when Miller appeared to Holden speaking through old cop stories, these new voices may be reaching out in the only way they know how.




Whether the uploaded awareness of the people who died from Eros, or scans from anyone who has passed through the gate, these ghostly voices are terrifying news for the Rocinante. This situation is scarier than what Holden experienced, as now this mysterious entity can also take over the ship&#39;s systems, locking doors and shutting down comms. The protomolecule has shown absolute determination to follow its directive, and until it makes its current goals known, there&#39;s no telling what could happen before Dragon Tooth concludes. Once again, The Expanse: Dragon Tooth keeps its promise to be just as thrilling as the books and show.

The Expanse: Dragon Tooth #6 is available now from Boom! Studios.
