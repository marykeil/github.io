## Literature Review

As the Ultimate Black Panther is revealed, fans get to see the awesome redesigned costume he&#39;ll be using to kill Moon Knight.




As Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate Universe imprint begins to expand its world, fans have gotten their first look at the Ultimate Black Panther - seeing the hero both out of costume and wearing the awesome armor that he&#39;s using to take on Moon Knight. However, this is no hero vs hero misunderstanding - it&#39;s a battle to the death for the fate of the world.




Recently, Marvel revealed its first slate of character-focused titles set in the newly established Ultimate Universe, with Black Panther, Spider-Man, and the X-Men getting their own reinventions. Now, Marvel has shared cover art for Ultimate Black Panther #1, with art from Stefano Caselli &amp; David Curiel, Ethan Young &amp; Matt Wilson, Karen S. Darboe, and Travel Foreman revealing the hero&#39;s stunning new armor.

         

Coming February 7, 2024, Ultimate Black Panther comes from the creative team of Bryan Hull, Stefano Caselli, David Curiel, and Wil Moss. The book&#39;s summary reads:


THE NEW ULTIMATE BLACK PANTHER!
In the wake of ULTIMATE INVASION, Khonshu and Ra - the force known together as Moon Knight - are seeking to expand their brutal control of the continent of Africa. In response, the lone bulwark against them, the isolated nation of Wakanda, will send forth its champion…its king…the Black Panther!
From the creative minds of Bryan Hill (BLADE, KILLMONGER) and Stefano Caselli (X-MEN: RED, AVENGERS) comes a bold new take on the world of Black Panther and Wakanda!





 : &#34;The Maker&#39;s Council&#34;: Marvel&#39;s All-Powerful Evil Illuminati Finally Have an Official Codename


 Black Panther Fights for Freedom in a World Ruled by Villains 
The Maker&#39;s Council Must Be Stopped - Starting with Moon Knight
         

Introduced in the recent Ultimate Invasion miniseries (Jonathan Hickman, Bryan Hitch), the Ultimate Universe is Earth-6160. Originally similar to Marvel&#39;s main reality, this timeline was warped by the villainous Maker, who rewrote history to make the planet and its people easier to control. Killing or neutralizing most of Marvel&#39;s iconic heroes, the Maker then secretly carved up the world among his ruling council, staging a series of fake wars in order to keep the world in a manageable state of conflict.

Among the villains on the council are X-Men&#39;s Colossus and Magik, the diabolical Legendary Hulk, an evil take on Captain Britain, and Khonshu and Ra - a duo of dictators who together share the identity of the Moon Knight. While Tony Stark&#39;s Iron Lad is fighting to stop the Council carving up America over in Ultimate Universe (from Jonathan Hickman and Stefano Caselli), Ultimate Black Panther will follow the titular hero as he attempts to stop Khonshu and Ra from seizing Wakanda.






 Black Panther Is Taking on the Moon Knight Dictators 
But Is Wakanda Part of the Maker&#39;s Plan?
          

Previous series have shown the world map of the Ultimate Universe by indicating which of the Council rules certain areas. However, there&#39;s a black dot in the center of Africa marked as &#34;undiscovered territory.&#34; It&#39;s likely this is Wakanda, and that the Black Panther has so far managed to stop the Council seizing the nation. This would be a smart play on Wakanda&#39;s status in Marvel&#39;s main canon, where it was only recently revealed to the rest of the world, and has a reputation for having never been conquered in its long history. However, with the Maker having used time travel to remake the world however he wanted, the question remains as to why he&#39;d allow such a pocket of resistance to exist - is it possible Black Panther is part of his larger plan for the world?




These questions and more will be answered when Ultimate Black Panther hits comic stands. So far, fans don&#39;t know for certain who&#39;s under the helm - the figure shown on a throne on Karen S. Darboe&#39;s cover is the right age for T&#39;Challa, but many figures have been reimagined in the Ultimate Universe, and it wouldn&#39;t be surprising for Marvel to throw fans a curveball such as a heroic Eric Killmonger. Either way, the awesome new armor is exactly what the Black Panther will need to take on the Maker&#39;s Council and free the world from the despicable new version of Moon Knight.

Ultimate Black Panther #1 is coming February 7, 2024.
