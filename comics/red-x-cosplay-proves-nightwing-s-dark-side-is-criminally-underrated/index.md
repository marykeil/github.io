## Literature Review

Nightwing is an overall great guy and hero, but during a dark time he became Red X, with this cosplay giving the character a perfect live-action look.




In DC Comics continuity, Red X is the covert costumed identity of Dick Grayson -- also known as Nightwing -- and is a character who only more recently became an official part of DC’s sprawling comic book universe. Leave it to the talented creators in the cosplay community to bring the character back into the spotlight with a badass new live-action design that proves Red X is Nightwing’s most criminally underrated alter ego!




Shared on social media via Instagram by the photographer of the piece, @nycosplayer, the actual cosplayer featured in this photo has unfortunately not yet been identified, but if @nycosplayer’s influence as a shutterbug in the community is of any indication, it’ll only be a matter of time before the original creative talent behind this costume is finally located.


 

Consistently shooting and uploading images of other equally as skilled cosplayers, @nycosplayer has shared pictures of the Batman x Superman hybrid hero named Superbat, a Christmas-themed Red Hood design, the cosmic space cops known as Green Lantern Jessica Cruz and Green Lantern John Stewart, and more, and @nycosplayer always seems to find ways to elevate some already great material with his unique photographic eye.




                  Red X Cosplay Proves Teen Titans Antihero Has One of DC&#39;s Best Costumes   In a menacing and comic-accurate cosplay, Red X from Teen Titans comes to life in a cosplay that brings the mysterious villain/antihero to life.   


 New DC Cosplay Shows Off Red X&#39;s Unique Character Design 
          

Introduced in season 1, episode 9 of the animated Teen Titans series titled “Masks,” Red X was a persona Nightwing used when he had to get close to the mercenary known as Deathstroke without compromising his superhero nature. A more rough-around-the-edges and dangerous version of Dick who purposely didn’t play by the rules, a couple of iterations of the character have been introduced since his original debut, with Red X stepping into DC Comics continuity proper in 2021’s Future State event and then again later that same year in Teen Titans Academy #1, where Red X became a concerning piece of Nightwing’s past come back to bite him.




A picture taken at last year’s New York Comic Con, this Red X cosplay design immediately makes a case for being one of the best live-action looks ever seen for this character, a unique accomplishment considering not many people have embodied this lesser-known anti-hero. Wearing a half-white, half-black skull helmet with glowing blue eyes and Red X’s crimson logo etched onto it, this cosplayer’s tactical and practical set of pads and armor sells Red X’s real-world design well, with their Batman Begins-inspired utility belt, cape, gloves, and signature red “X” accents selling a look for a character who needs to be seen on the big screen sooner rather than later.



 Nightwing&#39;s Red X Identity Gets The Live-Action Design It Deserves 
          

Cosplayers who dream up and then create unique character designs such as this one deserve credit where credit’s due, but until this mysterious Red X fan comes forth or is identified by another member of the nerd community, @nycosplayer’s incredible photos of them will have to suffice in showcasing what they’re truly capable of as a cosplay creator. Red X hasn’t been all that prevalent in DC Comics since he made his official canonical debut, but after seeing this live-action design, it’s clear that Nightwing’s dark side needs a lot more respect put on his name.
