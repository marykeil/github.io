 Several manga, such as 
High School Family
 and

## Literature Review

Weekly Shonen Jump is infamous for its cutthroat business practices and swift cancellations, and because of it, too many great manga ended in 2023.




One of the things that defines Weekly Shonen Jump is how cutthroat a business they run. If a manga isn&#39;t at least a moderate success from its debut chapter, it’ll be canceled more often than not without a chance to ever find its footing. That practice has helped make them as successful as they are, but it’s also given them a reputation for being notoriously ruthless towards their creators.
Manga are always ending in quick succession in Weekly Shonen Jump, and 2023 was no different. Many of the Weekly Shonen Jump manga that ended in 2023 were the usual cases of a series being canceled due to low sales and poor reception from fans, but in a few cases, a manga ended because it either reached its natural conclusion – or because the author no longer wished to be serialized in the magazine.
        

Whatever the case, too many Weekly Shonen Jump manga ended in 2023, and that’s worth calling attention to, regardless of the quality of some of them.
            
 
 10 Best Shonen Jump Manga Canceled Way Too Soon 
Weekly Shonen Jump is notorious for how quickly it will cancel a manga, and here are 10 Jump manga that were, unfortunately, canceled far too soon.












 








 12  High School Family: Kokosei Kazoku Had Finally Run Its Course 
Serialized from September 7, 2020 to February 20, 2023
        

The first Weekly Shonen Jump manga to leave the magazine in 2023 was Ryo Nakama&#39;s High School Family: Kokosei Kazoku. For two years, High School Family: Kokosei Kazoku filled the role of Weekly Shonen Jump&#39;s resident gag manga, but it abruptly came to an end in early 2023, likely due to rankings and sales getting too low to justify its continuation. It was very unfortunate for fans of the series, but Weekly Shonen Jump&#39;s other gag manga, Me &amp; Roboco, has been successful enough to receive an anime and upcoming film adaptation, so at the very least, that niche is still being fulfilled.

 11  PPPPPP’s Story &amp; Art Were Never A Good Fit For the Magazine 
Serialized from September 18, 2021 to February 27, 2023
        

 Throughout its run, Mapollo 3&#39;s PPPPPP maintained a notable cult following thanks to its unique art style and writing that had only grown larger over time, but from the start, PPPPPP&#39;s writing and art style never fit the standards of what was expected out of Weekly Shonen Jump, so it makes sense that it would eventually be canceled. Mapollo 3 recently started a new story on Manga Plus, Magical Girl Tsubame: I Will (Not) Save The World!, so at the very least, people are still plenty able to experience their work.

 10  Tokyo Demon Bride Story Failed To Carve Out Its Own Identity 
Serialized from September 5, 2022 to April 3, 2023
        

Following PPPPPP, the next manga to have left Weekly Shonen Jump was Tadaichi Nakama&#39;s Tokyo Demon Bride Story. Tokyo Demon Bride Story had good art and storytelling, but the main issue was that it always stuck to incredibly familiar story beats, so it offered very little in the way of originality and failed to maintain a fanbase as a result. Adding how Tokyo Demon Bride Story centered around battling demons meant that it was forced to compete with Jujutsu Kaisen and other manga with similar premises, it makes sense that Tokyo Demon Bride Story would eventually be canceled.

 9  Ginka &amp; Glüna&#39;s Pacing Killed One Of Shonen Jump&#39;s Most Promising Stories 
Serialized from September 12, 2022 to April 10, 2023


 







One of the most unfortunate examples of Weekly Shonen Jump&#39;s cancelation practices was Shinpei Watanabe&#39;s Ginka &amp; Glüna. Ginka &amp; Glüna had engaging world building and writing from the very start a great art style to go with it as well. However, Ginka &amp; Glüna had very poor pacing that always alternated between being too slow and too fast, so despite having some of the best art and ideas in a new Weekly Shonen Jump manga in years, its poor execution led to it being canceled before it could find its footing.
            
 
 Shonen Jump Will Never Have Another One Piece, &amp; A Cancelled Series Proves It 
While One Piece is one of Shonen Jump&#39;s flagship manga series, one canceled story shows why the magazine will never have a series like it again.

 8  Ichigoki’s Under Control!! Was One Of Shonen Jump&#39;s Least Popular Manga Ever 
Serialized from November 28, 2022 to April 03, 2023
        

One of the least surprising to leave the magazine this year was Seiji Hayashis Ichigoki&#39;s Under Control!! While Hayashi had found success with his previous series, I&#39;m From Japan, his art and comedy didn&#39;t translate nearly as well to Ichigoki, which often came off as a visual and narrative mess that tried too hard to be funny. As such, Ichigoki&#39;s Under Control!! came to a very anticlimactic end with a total of 19 chapters across two volumes, making it one of the shortest manga to be published in Weekly Shonen Jump in recent years.

 7  Mashle: Magic And Muscles Reached Its Fitting Conclusion 
Serialized from January 27, 2020 fo July 3, 2023


 







Not every manga that left Weekly Shonen Jump in 2023 was canceled, and a prime example of that is Hajime Komoto&#39;s Mashle: Magic and Muscles. It had already been announced a year prior that Mashle had entered its final arc, and everything that happened in Mashle: Magic and Muscles from 2022 onwards slowly built up its final act and closed out various plot points until it reached a heartfelt and fittingly absurd conclusion. Mashle&#39;s anime adaptation is set to adapt its second arc in 2024, and with any luck, it&#39;ll be able to bring the entirety of the story to a wider audience.

 6  Black Clover&#39;s Author&#39;s Health Could No Longer Keep Up With Shonen Jump&#39;s Schedule 
Serialized from February 16, 2015 to August 21, 2023


 







Another manga that left Weekly Shonen Jump in 2023 without being canceled is Yuki Tabata&#39;s Black Clover. Tabata&#39;s health issues in recent years had long been public knowledge, with Black Clover often either publishing chapters with unfinished artwork or taking unexpected breaks, and in August 2023, it was announced that Black Clover would leave Weekly Shonen Jump and finish out its final arc in Shueisha&#39;s quarterly magazine, Jump Giga from December 2023 onward. While it might be disappointing for the story to take so much longer to conclude, it&#39;s great that Tabata has decided to prioritize his health, and that&#39;s bound to make Black Clover’s ultimate conclusion even better.

 5  Fabricant 100 Hit Far Too Many Action Manga Cliches 
Serialized From December 5, 2022 To September 4, 2023
        

Going back to Weekly Shonen Jump manga that were canceled in 2023, Daisuke Enoshima&#39;s Fabricant 100 had an interesting setup with its story and good art to back up the fight scenes, but throughout its run, Fabricant 100 kept invoking one action manga cliché after another, like a secret organization the protagonists had to pass a test to join and an elaborate power system the heroes and villains used. All of it came together to make Fabricant 100 have far too little in the way of identity, and as such, it ended in a little less than a year.

 4  Tenmaku Cinema’s Story Was Far Too Niche For Weekly Shonen Jump 
Serialized from April 10, 2023 to September 11, 2023
        

 Yuto Tsukuda and Shun Saeki&#39;s Tenmaku Cinema met an unfortunate and abrupt cancelation in 2023. While Tenmaku Cinema had a great, meta-fictional story about film production with stellar art to support it, film production is far too niche of a subject for most manga readers to really care about, so Tenmaku Cinema failed to attract a large audience and ended up being canceled after 21 chapters. Tenmaku Cinema&#39;s cancelation might seem surprising when Tsukuda and Saeki were previously responsible for Food Wars!: Shokugeki no Soma, but if anything, it serves as proof that an author succeeding once doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll succeed again.

 3  Do Retry Failed To Capture An Audience At Every Turn 
Serialized From May 8, 2023 To September 18, 2023
        

Another unsurprising cancelation of a Weekly Shonen Jump manga in 2023 was Jun Kirarazaka&#39;s Do Retry. In addition to sports manga like boxing always being hard to sell in Weekly Shonen Jump, Do Retry had terrible art and fight choreography, and it was made even worse by the poor pacing and often nonsensical storytelling exhibited in each chapter. Do Retry failed to give people a real reason to care about it for the entirety of its run, and as such, it was canceled after only 19 chapters, making it another example of one of the shortest runs of a Weekly Shonen Jump manga in recent years.

 2  The Ichinose Family’s Deadly Sins Wasted Too Much Time Spinning Its Wheels 
Serialized From November 14, 2022 To November 6, 2023
        

Taizan 5 made a name for themselves with the series Takopi’s Original Sin, but their next story, The Ichinose Family’&#39; Deadly Sins, didn&#39;t have as much success. Taizan 5 utilized the same sort of character drama and dark writing that defined Takopi, but The Ichinose Family&#39;s Deadly Sins&#39; use of Taizan 5&#39;s writing only amounted to a confusing narrative that was far too focused on drama and twists than it was on constructing a solid story. Nothing could ever be resolved without the story immediately undoing it, and the story ending with the characters accepting that nothing would ever be resolved is emblematic of why it failed as a series.

 1  Ice-Head Gill Had Little To Offer Its Readers From the Start 
Serialized From June 26, 2023 To November 13, 2023
        

The final manga to leave Weekly Shonen Jump in 2023 was Ikuo Hachiya&#39;s Ice-Head Gill, and it was another unfortunate, albeit unsurprising, cancelation. While the manga had a bit of novelty to it because of its Norse mythology aesthetic, Ice-Head Gill&#39;s bad pacing, art, and fight choreography all came together to make a manga that never succeeded in appealing to its readers, and that led to it being unceremoniously canceled after only 20 chapters.
