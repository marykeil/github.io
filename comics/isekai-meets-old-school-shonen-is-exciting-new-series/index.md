# Isekai Meets Old-School Shonen is Exciting New Series


## SUMMARY 



  The Magician Who Rose From Failure is a refreshing isekai manga that follows a protagonist who has to work hard to catch up to others.   The manga breaks the typical isekai trope by featuring a weak hero who needs to study for two years before showing any progress.   The story combines elements of shonen manga and isekai, allowing the protagonist&#39;s past life to influence events in the new world.

## Literature Review

Imagine an isekai series where the hero shares similarities to shonen protagonists like Naruto – that&#39;s the manga The Magician Who Rose From Failure.




The Magician Who Rose From Failure might be yet another isekai reincarnation manga, but it&#39;s structured like an old-school Shonen Jump series, following a protagonist who must work extra hard just to be on the same level as everyone else. Some might compare this unconventional reincarnation manga to a similar isekai trope where the weak hero grinds against a vast numbers of weak monsters to get exponentially stronger, but its ties to big-name shonen series like Naruto are much more prominent.




Written by Hitsuji Gamei with artwork from Saika Fushimi, The Magician Who Rose From Failure initially creates the very convincing impression that Arcus Reytheft is the typical isekai&#39;d protagonist who will end up wielding incredible magic that everyone overlooked.

          

However, Arcus isn&#39;t that type of hero. Instead, he is forced to study hard for two years before he can get anywhere, and finally proves himself at the end of chapter 4.

While sharing the best qualities with the most successful old-school shonen, The Magician Who Rose From Failure still employs the most celebrated aspects of isekai. Incidentally, a trope that Am I Actually the Strongest? also uses, Arcus is the heir of a venerable house of sorcerers with high magical power, but after being born with a low magic level, he is immediately disinherited. The boy is tormented both mentally and physically by his father, but unlike Am I Actually the Strongest?&#39;s protagonist Haruto, who actually possesses incredible powers that humanity just can&#39;t comprehend, Arcus is legitimately weak.




This is very similar to big-name shonen like Naruto for obvious reasons, but The Magician Who Rose From Failure is still an isekai and, luckily, allows Arcus&#39; past life and memories to influence the events in this new world. For example, the horrendous domestic abuse that Arcus is unfortunately subjected to is actually much worse than it already is, since he experienced what a healthy family dynamic is like in his previous life. In fact, Arcus initially tries to cope with his current conditions by remembering how he was bullied in his previous life and still persisted, but it&#39;s when he recalls his loving parents that he breaks down even more. For those who care more about fighting systems than family drama, the final scene of chapter 4 also greatly implies that Arcs&#39; magical prowess is augmented by his knowledge of his former life in an intriguing way.

          




Since there are so many isekai series that seem to borrow so much from one another, hopefully more series will follow the unexpected precedent set by The Magician Who Rose From Failure – even if it does pander to formulaic shonen tropes. The fact that an isekai is doing this rather than another shonen action series, however, makes this cliché feel shockingly fresh. The Magician Who Rose From Failure was recently picked up by the English publisher J-Novel Club for an official overseas release. Preview the first two volumes of the isekai series The Magician Who Rose From Failure officially on J-Novel Club.
