## Literature Review

Marvel has revealed a new Ultimate Universe and gives readers a look at the brand-new Ultimate versions of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. 




A new Green Goblin is on the horizon as Ultimate Spider-Man is preparing to launch on shelves. The Ultimate Invasion series and storyline introduced a brand-new Ultimate Universe. Among the revamped heroes in the new Ultimate Marvel line-up is Spider-Man. Initially, there were rumors of a mystery wall-crawler filling Spider-Man&#39;s shoes, but now it&#39;s been confirmed to be Peter Parker, who in this universe is a mature family man.




The new Ultimate Spider-Man and Green Goblin are unveiled in a preview YouTube trailer from Marvel. In addition, along with a special preview panel for Green Goblin&#39;s appearance, variant cover art from Ryan Stegman, J.P. Mayer, and Matt Milla can both be viewed below.


 

Ultimate Spider-Man #1 by Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checchetto, Matt Wilson, Joe Caramagna, Michelle Marchese, and Will Moss is currently slated for a January 10, 2024 release date.


 The Green Goblin and Spider-Man are Ultimately Back 


          

As can be seen above, this version of Peter Parker offers a rare depiction of Spider-Man as a full-blown family man. Not only is he married to Mary-Jane Watson, but the two share two children they are raising together. The trailer showcases all the villains who Peter will be facing off against (including a tease for a fight between himself and the Kingpin), but the family factor suggests that he will need to balance his superhero life with being a father and husband. In Earth-616 canon, Peter struggles with being a single man holding a job and an apartment with a superhero career, so family life may prove to be an even bigger challenge.




Speaking of challenges, this Ultimate Spider-Man is going to face off with a brand-new version of Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is seen donning an armored suit and glider reminiscent of the version of the Goblin seen in Sam Raimi&#39;s 2002 Spider-Man film. Whoever is under the mask likely won&#39;t be Norman Osborn, as the trailer also features a news story listing countless names claimed in some mysterious event. Among those late names who flash on the screen include Norman Osborn, as well as Aunt May Parker. Another suspect may be Harry Osborn, but time will tell as to who ends up being the Green Goblin.



 A Very Different Spider-Man vs. Green Goblin 


          

In just small glimpses so far, it is clear that the creative team is going out of their way to offer wholly unique versions of both Spider-Man and the Green Goblin from what readers are currently getting or have gotten from the 616 canon. At a time when Peter is usually hapless and down on his luck, the Ultimate Universe delivers a mature version of Peter Parker who seems to have his life figured out, at least enough to have his own family. Ultimate Spider-Man #1 is due for a physical and digital release from Marvel on January 10.
