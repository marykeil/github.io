## Literature Review

The X-Men’s futures are in peril, but the most important moment is in the past between two characters who’ve influenced Krakoa like no others.




As the X-Men’s Krakoan era comes to a close with the line-wide initiative Fall of X, one of the key writers of the era has explained which two crucial characters the story always had to circle back to, and why their meeting was so important. The X-Men’s hopes and dreams might be going up in a fiery inferno, but the moment that matters most is a much quieter one on a park bench.




The end of the Krakoan era comes with the dual series Fall of the House of X (written by Gerry Duggan, illustrated by Lucas Werneck, colored by Bryan Valenza and lettered by VC’s Travis Lanham) and Rise of the Powers of X (written by Kieron Gillen and penciled by R.B. Silva)



          

 Fall is mostly focusing on the present-day battles against the anti-mutant group Orchis, while Rise careens into the future, as the last mutants fight against the artificial intelligences that have hounded and haunted them for years. If the future is to be saved, it will come back to the main characters of the entire Krakoan era.


 The X-Men&#39;s Krakoa Era Is All About Two Characters 


          




In an interview with CBR, Rise of the Powers of X writer Kieron Gillen explained why his story revolves around Charles Xavier and Moira MacTaggert, and why it was so important that the Krakoan era returned to both of them. As Gillen says –



“Moira is quite big in this story because the end of the X-Men Krakoan era had to come back to her. It had to come back to Xavier as well. Because we basically started with those two people on a bench. For all the big ideas Jonathan Hickman started, it was a very powerful, personal story about these people trapped and wanting to be free.”




The park bench moment referred to by Gillen is first seen in Powers of X #1 (written by Jonathan Hickman, penciled by R.B. Silva, inked by Silva and Adriano Di Benedetto, colored by Marte Gracia and lettered by Clayton Cowles). This is the first time that Xavier and Moira ever meet from Xavier’s perspective.

Xavier and Moira are absolutely the most important characters of the entire Krakoan era. Xavier has been the figurehead for Krakoa; the one whose psychic message let the whole world originally know about the mutant nation and its goals. Meanwhile, Moira has been both his most crucial ally and greatest enemy. She began as an apparent friend, using the knowledge she gained from her newly revealed mutant powers of reincarnation to guide Charles to found Krakoa. However, Moira was secretly hoping to destroy mutantkind later down the line. She&#39;s come much closer to achieving this goal now that she’s joined Orchis after being exposed.






 The Entire Krakoa Saga Centers On One Moment 


          

The moment when Xavier and Moira meet on the park bench is clearly a singularly important moment for Kieron Gillen. In Immortal X-Men #1 (written by Gillen and illustrated by Lucas Werneck), readers see a parallel scene between Destiny and Mister Sinister that Gillen returns to time and again. Similarly, the cover for Rise of the Powers of X #3 (by R.B. Silva and Edgar Delgado) shows what appears to be an assassination attempt on Moira’s life at that same pivotal bench moment. So, as the X-Men’s future remains imperiled, the story will also return to the past to reiterate why Xavier and Moira are so important to this era.



Fall of the House of X #1 and Rise of the Powers of X #1 are on sale now from Marvel Comics.
