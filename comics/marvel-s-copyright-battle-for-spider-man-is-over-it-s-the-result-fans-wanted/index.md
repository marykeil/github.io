## Literature Review

The estate of Steve Ditko, co-creator of Spider-Man, has settled its copyright dispute against Marvel in a satisfactory fashion.




Marvel’s copyright battle for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange is over–and it is the result fans wanted. For the past few years, Marvel has been wrapped up in legal battles over the rights to some of its most iconic characters, including Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Now, Marvel has settled with the various creators’ estates, including Ditko’s, reaching a settlement pleasing to all involved parties.




As reported in The Hollywood Reporter, Marvel settled its final dispute with the estate of Steve Ditko, the co-creator of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Ditko’s estate was one of several who filed “copyright termination notices” with Marvel, seeking to regain rights to certain characters. In addition to obtaining the rights to Spider-Man and Doctor Strange’s debuts, the notices also sought compensation for other uses of the characters. The Hollywood Reporter revealed that Marvel and Ditko’s estate had settled the matter “amicably.”

          

Other creators who filed suits include Larry Leiber as well as the estates of Gene Colan, Don Heck and Don Rico.

He created two of the company&#39;s biggest icons
          




Steve Ditko, along with Stan Lee, created two of Marvel’s biggest icons: Spider-Man and Doctor Strange. Growing dissatisfied with Lee, Ditko left Marvel in the mid-1960s, jumping to DC Comics as well as Charlton. Famously reclusive, Steve Ditko died at the age of 90 in 2018. In the years since Ditko’s exodus from Marvel, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man became two of the most popular heroes on the planet, thanks to the MCU. In 2021, Ditko’s estate, along with the others mentioned earlier, filed copyright termination notices, seeking to regain rights and ensure fair compensation.

Unfortunately, legal battles over creators’ rights have been a part of the comics&#39; industry for many years. The rumblings of the movement began with creators like Neal Adams in the early 1970s, as well as lawsuits by the estates of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. Jack Kirby became the center of several ugly court battles with Marvel over the rights to his creations, and the matter was not conclusively settled until many years after his death. Likewise, Bill Finger’s estate sued DC Comics to ensure he received proper recognition for co-creating Batman. These cases can sometimes become heated and contentious, leading to bad will among fans and creators.

 The Creators of Marvel&#39;s Icons Will Be Fairly Compensated 
But the fight for creator rights goes on
          

However, per The Hollywood Reporter, Marvel’s settlement with Ditko’s estate was satisfactory, and they are seeking dismissal of the suit–a cause for celebration. With this settlement, the status of the rights to their biggest icons, like Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, are settled. While the various estates did not get the rights to the characters back from Marvel, they will still receive fair compensation and credit in the years to come.
