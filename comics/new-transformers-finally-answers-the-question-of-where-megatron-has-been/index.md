## Literature Review

Megatron has been MIA since the launch of the new Transformers series, but now fans finally have an answer to the question, &#34;Where is Megatron?&#34;




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Transformers #4




Ever since Skybound relaunched the Transformers as a part of its new Energon Universe line, readers have been asking one question: “Where is Megatron?” Now, with the release of Transformers #4, fans have an answer to that question, as the issue reveals where Megatron has been ever since the Autobots and Decepticons crash-landed on Earth all those centuries ago.

Coming from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten, Transformers #4 picks up from the cliffhanger ending of the previous issue, which saw Spike Witwicky grievously wounded. A battle between the Autobots and Decepticons breaks out, leading Starscream and Soundwave to beat a hasty retreat.

          

In a mad grab for Energon, Starscream and Soundwave wind up cannibalizing the damaged Skywarp, as a further unhinged Starscream declares himself the ruler of the Decepticons: “Today. Tomorrow. Forever!” The scene is intercut with an arctic landscape, until the final page reveals Megatron, missing his arm and frozen in an ice cap.

It’s a foreboding image, especially intercut with Starscream’s ultimate declaration that he’s the de facto leader of the Decepticons now. Megatron is looking the worse for wear in the final splash page of the issue, badly damaged and even missing his famous gun arm. Even in such a wrecked state, the former Decepticon leader is still a formidable threat to both the surviving Autobots and the traitorous usurper Starscream. Previous Transformers issues have shown that Optimus and his Autobots barely survived the battle that led them to crash the Ark on Earth centuries ago, with Megatron in particular giving Optimus the fight of his life.

Now that fans have an answer to “Where is Megatron?,” the natural follow-up is, “What happens next?” Starscream has become increasingly unhinged as the new series has gone on, and the latest issue sees the self-proclaimed leader of the Decepticons acting more brutal than ever in his desperate bid to hold on to his newfound power. If and when Megatron wakes from his arctic slumber, it will be most interesting to see how the encounter with Starscream goes. His former second-in-command has always been portrayed as scheming against Megatron, but the cowardly Starscream has rarely ever confronted the Decepticon leader to his face. Anything can happen, but the odds aren’t on Starscream lasting long in the event of Megatron’s reawakening.






 When Will Megatron Retake Control of the Decepticons? 
          

While fans finally have an answer for what happened to Megatron, he’s still very much inactive and frozen in some chilly landscape. Starscream can rest easy for now, but the story now sees Megatron transformed quite literally into a Chekhov’s Gun - he’s been seen on-panel, so before all is said and done, the Decepticon leader will make his grand return to the Energon Universe at some point. Transformers fans will just have to keep reading to see what happens when Megatron wakes from his arctic slumber.
