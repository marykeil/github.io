# Invincible Why Viltrumites Have Mustaches But Mark Doesn t (&amp; Won t)


## SUMMARY 



  Viltrumites have a tradition of sporting mustaches, which represent their cultural identity and allegiance to Viltrum.   Mark, despite being a Viltrumite, chooses not to grow a mustache as he sees it as a symbol of the violent past and wants to move forward.   Mark&#39;s decision to remain clean-shaven reflects his commitment to breaking the cycle of the Viltrumites&#39; old ways and leading them towards change and a better future.

## Literature Review

Nearly every Viltrumite in Invincible sports a mustache except for Mark. The hero reveals the meaning of the mustaches and why he doesnâ€™t want one.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Invincible!At some point, fans of Invincible have all asked themselves the same question: Why do all the male Viltrumites except for Mark Grayson have a mustache? As it turns out there&#39;s a good answer for why Viltrumites are so particular to the facial hair. There&#39;s also a good reason why Invincible is never going to grow one.




In Invincible #144 by Robert Kirkman, Ryan Ottley and Cory Walker, Mark leaves Earth to lead the new Viltrumite Empire. At one point in the future, Invincible addresses his people about why he hasn&#39;t grown a mustache. Mark recognizes that mustaches are a tradition among the Viltrumites, even referring to them as ceremonial.



          

However, Mark admits he saw them as a symbol of the Viltrumite home world Viltrum, a planet Mark had no personal connection to. Furthermore, now that the Viltrumites have left their violent ways behind, Mark sees his cleanly shaved face as a way of moving on from the traditions of old.


 Viltrumites&#39; Mustaches Are a Traditional Part of Their Culture 
          




Like his father, Invincible is a Viltrumite, a race of warriors who attempt to conquer the galaxy in the name of Viltrum supremacy. While Omni-Man is the only Viltrumite Mark initially knows, he eventually meets dozens of them and like his father, they all have mustaches. Kreeg, Conquest, and the big bad of the series Thragg all sport upper facial hair like Nolan Grayson. Even Oliver, Mark&#39;s younger half-Thraxan brother, eventually grows a mustache by the time he catches up to Invincible in age. The only Viltrumite who doesn&#39;t ever have one is Mark, the most prominent Viltrumite in the whole story.

At first, Omni-Man&#39;s mustache doesn&#39;t seem like anything other than a preferred look. But as more male Viltrumites start entering the story, it raises the question of what the facial hair means. For native Viltrumites, it seems to be a rite of passage for males who grow a mustache to signify that they are a part of the Viltrumite culture. Mark, of course, initially has no allegiance to Viltrum and as such, doesn&#39;t grow one. But by the end of the story, he becomes the leader of the Viltrum Empire and his decision to keep his face clean-shaven signifies his goal of breaking the Viltrumites&#39; old ways.






 Invincible&#39;s Lack of a Mustache is Intended to Break the Viltrumite Cycle 


          

At his core, Mark believes that Viltrumites can change their ways, just as his father and several other Viltrumites did. Invincible is aware that his people are quite resistant to change and he knows that leading the Viltrumites requires him to make sure they look to the future rather than the past. Though Mark does integrate himself into Viltrumite culture, he intentionally chooses not to have a mustache so his people stay on the right track and grow past their heinous history. Invincible might be able to rock a decent &#39;stache if he tried, but as long as Mark is committed to changing the Viltrumite ways, he&#39;s never going to grow one.
