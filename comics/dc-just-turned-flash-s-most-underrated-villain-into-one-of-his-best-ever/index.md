## Literature Review

Flashâ€™s old nemesis the Folded Man returns with a surprisingly powerful upgrade that could turn him into the next Justice League-level threat.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for The Flash #3!An unexpected Flash villain makes his return with a god-tier upgrade. As Wally West continues to investigate the strange changes within the Speed Force, one of his old foes comes back with a vengeance. But unlike this rogue&#39;s early days, he&#39;s gotten a boost that turns him into a legit threat.




In The Flash #3 by Si Spurrier and Mike Deodato, Jr., Max Mercury comes to assist Wally with the odd Speed Force anomalies. Using Flash&#39;s dimensional shifting power, Wally and Max explore different layers of reality, only to stumble upon a spirit realm. However, a mysterious voice pushes them through lower planes to more twisted dimensions.

          

The voice sends Flash and Max to a plane filled with trapped speedsters. However, Max uses his last bit of speed to push Wally down one more layer where he discovers their tormentor&#39;s true identity: Edwin Gauss, aka the Folded Man, a B-list villain who has gotten a powerful upgrade.

In addition to complications lurking in the Speed Force, the Flash has also had to deal with his enemies getting major upgrades. Wally first discovered his foes were upping their game when he fought Mirror Master who used an atomic mirror to reflect things on a quantum level. But Mirror Master&#39;s upgrade paled in comparison to Gorilla Grodd who began invading Central City as part of a strange scientific experiment. Grodd&#39;s work only exacerbated the fluctuations with the Speed Force and managed to bring a terrifying being known as the Uncoiled to Flash&#39;s world, a being that nearly killed Wally.

The Folded Man was never one of the Flash&#39;s most well-known rouges. But despite only having a handful of appearances, Gauss was pretty powerful thanks to his suit that allowed him to travel between the second and fourth dimensions. However, thanks to the mysterious upgrade he&#39;s received, the Folded Man is far more powerful here. Gauss can literally fold realities around his opponents and send them down to the lowest and most terrifying planes of existence, trapping them completely. Wally is only able to escape thanks to his newfound dimensional shift powers. But anyone else unlucky enough to encounter the new and improved Folded Man is in serious danger.






 The Folded Man Has the Power to Become a God-Tier Threat 


          

With the Folded Man&#39;s newly upgraded powers, what happens if he decides to attack Wonder Woman or Superman? They&#39;d be powerless to escape any dimension he traps them in. Even Wally might not be able to escape since his glitching power isn&#39;t consistent and Max helped Flash escape a layer of reality by lending him speed. The Folded Man was already good at shifting between dimensions, but now he&#39;s got powers that could allow him to rid the DC Universe of its heroes. The Flash may want to tread lightly because the new and improved Folded Man could be a bigger threat than he thinks.

The Flash #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
