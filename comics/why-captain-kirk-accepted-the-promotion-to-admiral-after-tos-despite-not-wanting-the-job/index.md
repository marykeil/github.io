# Why Captain Kirk Accepted the Promotion to Admiral After TOS (Despite Not Wanting the Job)


## SUMMARY 



  Kirk accepted a promotion to admiral despite not wanting the job, in order to prevent unethical situations like the one on Archernar IV from happening again.   Kirk&#39;s decision to become an admiral was driven by his moral compass and a desire to make a difference within Starfleet and the Federation.   While those close to Kirk believed it was a mistake, his promotion was motivated by good intentions, even though it ultimately led him away from his true calling as a starship captain.

## Literature Review

Kirk&#39;s decision to become an admiral after the end of the Original Series was odd, but now Star Trek has revealed why he took it.




Star Trek has revealed why Kirk accepted a promotion to admiral after the end of the Original Series, despite not wanting the job. As captain of the Enterprise, Kirk often clashed with other admirals and showed a willingness to break rules. These qualities hardly become of a captain, let alone an admiral. In 2009’s Star Trek: Missions&#39; End #5, fans at long last learn what led Kirk to forsake commanding a starship and take a desk job.




Star Trek: Mission’s End #5 is written by Ty Templeton and drawn by Steve Molnar. Kirk and company have just saved the people of Archernar IV, who were rushed into Federation membership for nefarious reasons. Meanwhile, Kirk has been entertaining a promotion to the admiralty and after the events at Archernar, he decides to take it.



          

Bones is incredulous, but Kirk explains that by becoming an admiral, he will be in a position to keep situations like the one on Archernar from ever happening again.


 Kirk Hated Admirals--So Why Did He Become One? 
          

When Star Trek went off the air in 1969, Kirk was still in the center seat, but when the franchise returned a decade later with Star Trek: The Motion Picture, he was well into a stint as an admiral. Kirk would take command of the Enterprise during the V’Ger incident, but eventually returned to the admiral’s desk, even after skippering another five-year mission. Fans were understandably surprised upon learning Kirk had accepted a promotion and became that which he used to despise. Star Trek: Mission’s End attempted to bridge the gap between the end of the show and The Motion Picture, including explaining Kirk’s odd promotion.




Kirk’s decision to become an admiral was inspired by bad decision-making on the part of Starfleet and the Federation. The situation on Archernar IV was dire, but could have easily been avoided had there been more ethical decisions being made–and Kirk saw himself as just the one to spearhead this initiative. Kirk tells Doctor McCoy that he was done following orders that he did not believe were right. Kirk’s sense of morals, which made him an exemplary Starfleet captain, ultimately led him to become an admiral.

 Kirk Never Should Have Been an Admiral 
          

Those closest to Kirk, including Spock and Doctor McCoy, believed that Kirk taking a promotion was a mistake. While Kirk’s track record as an admiral spoke for itself, commanding a starship was his “first, best destiny,” as Spock noted in The Wrath of Khan. Kirk thought he could make a difference, but ultimately just became part of the machine himself. When Kirk was demoted back to captain in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, he smiled, knowing that he was once again back in command of a starship. While Kirk’s decision to accept a promotion may not have worked in the long run, it began with the best of intentions.
