## Literature Review

The My Hero Academia manga hints that an unexpected hero may have predicted All For One&#39;s defeat and the very weakness that would cause it.





Summary

  Hawks may have pinpointed the weakness that led to All For One&#39;s defeat, his inability to anticipate his own emotions, leading to him losing control over his Quirks.   All For One&#39;s plan to steal One For All was flawed from the start, as he failed to consider his own capacity for negative emotions and his ability to control Shigaraki.   Bakugo&#39;s provocation and ability to elicit strong emotional responses from All For One ultimately brought about his downfall.  







With All For One seemingly nearing his end at long last, My Hero Academia hints that one hero may have predicted All For One&#39;s defeat from the very start. The latest chapter suggests that Hawks may have pinpointed the weakness responsible for All For One&#39;s downfall long before the Final War, and it all has to do with his flawed plan to steal One For All.

In chapter #409 of My Hero Academia, All For One unexpectedly loses control over his Quirks during the battle against Bakugo. Though All For One believes his rewinding body is to blame, Hawks&#39; vestige present in All For One&#39;s realm points out that All For One&#39;s overwhelming emotions have loosened his control and allowed the Quirks to rebel against him. 

          

As Hawks&#39; vestige also points out, All For One has seemingly been overpowered by Shigaraki, and his plan to steal One For All has ultimately been foiled by All For One&#39;s inability to anticipate his own capacity for emotion, a weakness Hawks pointed out nearly a hundred chapters prior.




                  &#39;All For One Goal&#39;: My Hero Academia Reveals The True Meaning Of Its Villain&#39;s Name   All For One has unleashed his ultimate attack in My Hero Academia, and it reveals the true meaning of his name while changing his character forever.   


 Hawks Predicted the Flaw in All For One&#39;s Plan 
          

All For One&#39;s plan to steal One For All greatly relied on harnessing Shigaraki&#39;s strong hatred to overcome the will of the previous users of One For All. However, this plan may have been flawed from the start. As Hawks rightfully points out in chapter #311, All For One&#39;s hatred for the successors of One For All and his frustration at being thwarted by them for centuries should have sufficed for him to overpower and steal One For All. However, All For One failed to take into account the possibility that he could also feel as strong negative emotions as Shigaraki, believing himself incapable of emotion despite constantly laughing, as Hawks keenly notes.




Despite All For One&#39;s misguided belief, the battle against Bakugo has proved Hawks may have been right all along. Bakugo has repeatedly provoked All For One throughout their battle and has elicited many a strong response from the otherwise collected villain. All For One is even reminded of the second user of One For All and mistakes Bakugo for him when blinded by rage, further proving he may be far from the stoic man he believes himself to be.

                  &#39;One Quirk is Enough&#39;: My Hero Academia Reveals The Strongest Hero May Not Be Deku   Bakugo&#39;s latest victory in My Hero Academia proves he never needed to compete with Deku as he finally discovers his true strength in his only quirk.   

Ultimately, it seems that All For One&#39;s biggest weakness may have been one not even he himself saw coming and one that Bakugo unintentionally brought to the surface. This in turn proves Bakugo may have been destined to be All For One&#39;s final opponent all along. Having said that, while Bakugo has managed to stop All For One for the time being, it is unlikely that this will be the last fans see of him as My Hero Academia&#39;s ultimate villain is unlikely to bow out gracefully.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
