# Superman s Heat Vision vs Godzilla s Atomic Breath Which Is More Powerful, Officially Confirmed


## SUMMARY 



  Godzilla&#39;s atomic breath is just as powerful as Superman&#39;s heat vision, proving they are evenly matched in a battle.   The Legion of Doom&#39;s Toyman used the Dreamstone to send the Titans to the DC Universe to destroy the Justice League.   The DC Universe is in danger as Godzilla, with his Superman-like strength, wreaks havoc and the heroes struggle to pacify him.

## Literature Review

Godzilla has come to the DC Universe and only Superman can stop him. But whose power wins out? Godzilla’s atomic breath or Superman’s heat vision?




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #2!The match-up of the century has arrive and it&#39;s pitting Godzilla&#39;s iconic move against a classic Superman power. The DC Universe has just been invaded by Titans and leading the charge is the King of the Monsters and his first battle with the Man of Steel finally answers the question &#34;Which is stronger, heat vision or atomic breath?&#34;.




In Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #2 by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, the League realizes that Titans are invading all over and divides their efforts to stop the invading monsters. Superman stays in Metropolis, where Godzilla is already wreaking havoc.

          

Godzilla and Superman are pretty evenly matched (though Hawkwoman and Shazam do lend a hannd). Seeing that Godzilla is summoning his atomic breath, Superman activates his heat vision and the two icons blast one another with everything they have. Even Shazam is surprised when he discovers that their abilities are equal in power.


 Godzilla&#39;s Atomic Breath is as Powerful as Superman&#39;s Heat Vision 
          




Tired of always being defeated by the Justice League, the Legion of Doom decided to up their game and broke into Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude. While Lex Luthor planned to steal specific powerful relics, Toyman grabbed the Dreamstone and accidentally transported the team of villains to the MonsterVerse where they instantly met Kong. The rest of the Legion was terrified, but Toyman saw lots of potential in the giant beasts, seeing them as the perfect tools to destroy the Justice League. Wishing on the Dreamstone once more, Toyman sent the monsters to the DC Universe, where they instantly began attacking.

One would think that between Godzilla&#39;s atomic breath and Superman&#39;s heat vision, one would naturally come out on top. After all, the temperature of the MonsterVerse incarnation of Godzilla&#39;s atomic breath is approximately 36,032 Fahrenheit at its weakest while the lower end of Superman&#39;s heat vision has been confirmed at around 5,000 degrees (at least during the New 52). But both characters&#39; powers wildly vary depending on the context. Superman, for example, once used his heat vision to repair a hole in reality. While it&#39;s hard to accurately measure the power level of each ability, one thing is clear as day now: Godzilla&#39;s atomic breath is at least equal in strength to Superman&#39;s heat vision.






 Godzilla is as Strong as Superman and the DC Universe is in Danger 


          

Godzilla&#39;s in a new world where superhumans are attacking him, so he&#39;s obviously going to fight back. But if he&#39;s as strong as Superman, then the DC Universe is in serious trouble. The DCU is used to giant monsters attacking, but not one with Superman-like strength or power. The only real shot at resolving things peacefully isn&#39;t going to be by defeating Godzilla, but by finding ways to pacify him. Godzilla generally sides with humanity, but that&#39;s not going to happen as long as the heroes keep attacking him. Unless Superman finds a way of calming Godzilla down, the monster&#39;s just going to keep rampaging across the DCU.

Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
