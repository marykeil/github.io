## Literature Review

Razer, a character that debuted in Green Lantern: The Animated Series, makes his debut in the DC Universe, hopefully to resolve a dormant cliffhanger.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #6!After years since he debuted in animated form, a Green Lantern ally has finally become DC canon. Hal Jordan may be grounded on Earth, but he keeps encountering old faces from outer space. After dealing with his greatest enemy, the Emerald Knight meets with someone fans may recall from Green Lantern: The Animated Series.




In Green Lantern #6 by Jeremy Adams and Xermanico, Hal Jordan faces off against his old enemy Sinestro, who has just become a Red Lantern. Sinestro threatens to tear the world in half with a construct shaped like a kaiju, but Green Lantern stops him with an amazing mecha construct.

          

After Green Lantern saves the day, he heads back home to his trailer and talks things over with Kilowog. However, he&#39;s visited by an unexpected ally, the former Red Lantern Razer, Hal and Kilowog&#39;s friend who debuted in Green Lantern: The Animated Series. Razer wonders why Jordan is talking to a construct Kilowog only for Hal to reveal that Kilowog is dead.


 Green Lantern: The Animated Series&#39; Razer is Now DC Canon 


          




Green Lantern: The Animated Series was a show that aired on Cartoon Network that aired from 2011-2013. The cartoon largely followed Hal Jordan and his partner Kilowog as they traversed the universe. In their travels, they met Razer, a younger, tormented member of the Red Lantern Corps. In the series, Razer grew close with Aya, the artificial intelligence of the Interceptor, Green Lantern&#39;s ship. At the end of the series, Razer lost Aya and began to search the universe for her, his intense hope earning him a Blue Lantern Power Ring. Unfortunately, the show was canceled and there was no resolution to Razer&#39;s search.

It&#39;s no surprise that Razer has come to the DC Universe under Jeremy Adams&#39; watch. Adams was a writer on Green Lantern: The Animated Series and expressed an interest in bringing the character into the DCU. On X, Adams responded to a fan who asked if Razer&#39;s presence means that the rest of the cartoon is DCU canon. According to Adams, he calls it &#39;canon adjacent&#39;, saying that many of Hal and Razer&#39;s off-panel adventures in the DC Universe resemble what happened in Green Lantern: The Animated Series. Fans are no doubt excited to see Razer as this could be the first step to resolving the cartoon&#39;s notorious cliffhanger.






 Green Lantern: The Animated Series Could Finally Get the Closure it Needs 
          

Fans of Green Lantern: The Animated Series loved the bond Razer and Aya shared and were crushed that the show left on such a downbeat note. While there&#39;s very little chance the show will have a second life (barring some unforeseen miracle), Adams is highly aware of how much people loved the show&#39;s original characters. Now that he&#39;s steering the Green Lantern ship, fans have a chance to see this story come to a close. Not only is it great that Green Lantern has a new and unexpected ally by his side, but fans could finally see Razer reunite with Aya for the first time in over a decade.

Green Lantern #6 is on sale now from DC Comics.
