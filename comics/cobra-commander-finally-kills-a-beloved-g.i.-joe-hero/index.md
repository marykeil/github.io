Summary

  G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero #301 marks the start of a new era with a major character death at the hands of Cobra Commander.   The decision to kill off Wade Collins fits with the poignancy of his story arc, according to writer Larry Hama.   Hama admits to not planning out plots in advance and lets the characters write themselves, prioritizing consistent character development over specific plotlines.  







G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero is back, and the franchise is marking the occasion by killing off one of its major characters at the hands of Cobra Commander. Writer Larry Hama continues the story he began over forty years ago, as the landmark G.I. Joe: ARAH #301 ushers in an entirely new era at new publisher Skybound Entertainment.

Coming from the creative team of Larry Hama, Chris Mooneyham, Francesco Segala and Pat Brosseau, the issue finds the Joe team in a race to prevent Serpentor Khan from detonating a deadly genetic bomb on Cobra Island, with Cobra Commander taken prisoner in previous issues, along with Cobra turncoat Wade Collins.

          

As slippery as ever, Cobra Commander takes the opportunity to escape, fatally shooting Wade Collins in the process. Speaking with Gamesradar, Hama says the decision to kill Collins off “fits with the poignancy of his story arc.” However, Hama is quick to admit that not even he knows exactly what’s coming up next:





“I have never planned out plots in advance. I write page by page, and I don&#39;t know what&#39;s on page five until I get to page four, and on the way, I&#39;m letting the characters write themselves.” 


                  G.I. JOE Owes Its Existence to a Shocking MCU Hero   G.I. Joe was one of the most beloved toy properties of the 1980s, but it turns out that the Real American Heroes owe their existence to a Marvel hero.   


 G.I. Joe’s Wade Collins Is Killed By Cobra Commander 
          

Wade Collins is a long-running character in the franchise, whose roots stretch all the way back to some of the most important lore and backstory of the entire series. Collins was a member of the Long Range Recon Patrol that also included Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow and Stalker, although he was left behind on the battlefield after he was presumed to be killed by a landmine. Collins survived, however, and the embittered veteran was brainwashed into joining up with the Cobra terrorist organization. Collins was eventually stationed to replace Fred Broca, a Crimson Guardsman assigned to watch over G.I. Joe HQ the Pit with his family. Creepily, Fred’s family had to accept Collins as their new husband and father as he carried out his duty for Cobra as “Fred II.”




While on assignment, Collins was reunited with Snake Eyes and Stalker, both of whom eventually talked him into walking away from Cobra. Collins left the terrorist organization, and his newly adopted family chose to go with him. His adopted son Sean eventually grew up and received training from the Arashikage ninja clan, becoming the new Snake Eyes after the original sacrificed himself when defending the Pit. After being killed in Cobra Commander’s escape, Collins is carried off the boat by his original LRRP squad-mates Storm Shadow, Stalker and a newly-resurrected Snake Eyes with his son Sean there as well, in his own Snake Eyes garb.

It’s interesting that Hama admits to not knowing where the story is going next in the Gamesradar interview, and has been more or less flying by the seat of his pants all these decades while chronicling the adventures of Hasbro&#39;s Real American Heroes. While some fans might be surprised to hear this, Hama is quick to point that keeping the characters consistent is far more important than where they go in the plot. “Keeping the characters consistent is my main concern,” Hama explains, “I can&#39;t even remember plotlines, what I remember best are character points.” Given the devoted fan-base that developed thanks to Larry Hama’s work on both the original action figure file cards and the long-running comic book, the characters of G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero keep the franchise alive to this very day.
