## Literature Review

Black Adam may be the King of the Jungle in his lion form, but one Wonder Woman villain just transformed into an infinitely bigger and deadlier beast.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans: Beast World #4!




In DC&#39;s Beast World crisis, a myriad of beasts—from the werewolf Batman to Harley Quinn&#39;s horrifying rabbit transformation—have taken center stage; but it&#39;s Wonder Woman&#39;s longstanding adversary, Giganta, who steals the spotlight with her jaw-dropping beastly metamorphosis. Doris Zeul emerges as a colossal and lethal creature that undoubtedly claims a prominent position at the top of the animal hierarchy.

Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer&#39;s Titans: Beast World #4 continues to follow heroes and villains as they navigate the tumultuous landscape of the latest crisis event, Beast World. Within this crisis, Beast Boy&#39;s Garro spores have unleashed a transformative chaos, turning heroes, villains, and civilians into volatile, uncontrollable animal hybrids.



          




The pervasive influence of the spores spares no one, catching even the formidable Giganta in its grip as she undergoes a monumental change into a giant bear. This unparalleled transformation stands as Beast World&#39;s largest and most lethal to date, prompting the intriguing question: can any other beast form rival or surpass the sheer might of this colossal bear?


 Giganta Turns Into a Giant Bear and Wrecks Havoc on Ivy Town 


          

Despite her reputation as a formidable foe of Wonder Woman, Giganta&#39;s heroic nature emerges in the midst of the crisis event. When birdlike creatures menace the small community of Ivy Town, the police urge everyone to seek safety. However, against their advice, Doris courageously charges into the chaos, enlarging herself to help save the community. Unfortunately, as she battles the beasts, several spores flood her mouth, resulting in a transformative twist that turns her into a giant bear. Rather than becoming the community&#39;s savior, Doris unintentionally becomes Ivy Town&#39;s biggest threat and proceeds to wreak havoc, unable to control her bear form.




Alerted to the chaos, Batgirl calls every available hero to converge on Ivy Town, categorizing Giganta as a level 8 threat. Upon their arrival, the assembled heroes are confronted with a town in the process of being decimated, marked by significant casualties and property damage. It takes the combined efforts of six A-list heroes, including Nightwing, Starfire, Flash, Cyborg, Swamp Thing, and Superman Jon Kent, to stop and neutralize Doris. The swift and extensive damage inflicted by Giganta in a remarkably short span of time makes this beast transformation the deadliest seen thus far and underscores the severity of this crisis event as a whole.



 Which DC Villain or Hero Will Have the Ultimate Beast Form? 
          

It&#39;s challenging to conceive anything more formidable than a giant bear, yet with each new release, Tom Taylor consistently ups the ante with the beast forms of heroes and villains. From Black Adam&#39;s lion form to PowerGirl&#39;s flamebird form, the animal hybrids continue to escalate both in size and menace, wreaking increasing havoc and evolving into more substantial threats. The anticipation for the upcoming Titans: Beast World releases is heightened as fans eagerly await the unveiling of beast forms for their favorite characters. It will be interesting to see which character&#39;s beast form comes out on top, although surpassing Giganta in the animal hierarchy will be a daunting challenge.
