Warning: contains spoilers for Invincible Iron Man #14The surprising marriage between Iron Man and the X-Men leader Emma Frost is leveling up big time, as the two iconic heroes have a steamy encounter in Iron Man #14, confirming that their marriage of convenience is not just for show anymore. Tony Stark&#39;s marriage to Hazel Kendal - an alias of the fabulous Emma Frost - was all about solidifying their heroic partnership against Orchis, but the intimate time they have spent together has created some real feelings of care between the two.




While Tony and Emma&#39;s marriage was a shock for many fans, the two &#34;lovebirds&#34; have used their fake marriage to gather allies, build resources - like Iron Man&#39;s new mysterium suit - and share secrets to undermine the plans of Orchis and Tony&#39;s archenemy Feilong.

          

Invincible Iron Man #14, from writer Gerry Duggan with artists Andrea Di Vito and Bryan Valenza, shows an incredibly steamy scene of Tony Stark and Emma Frost consummating their marriage, proving that while their marriage might have started out fake, it has seemingly developed into something real.

Some X-Men and Iron Man fans have not been happy about the marriage between Emma Frost and Tony Stark, but it is hard to deny that they are shockingly compatible and weirdly adorable together. Both Tony and Emma are known for being a bit vain and having troubled pasts, and they have also struggled in complex relationships with other heroes. While the two lovers may have fallen into their sham marriage by accident, it seems like fate that they were pushed into it and that their burgeoning relationship has been so fruitful.

The sexy scene in Invincible Iron Man #14 sees Emma Frost comforting Tony after he wakes up from a truly terrifying dream, telling him she knows how he can forget his worries. Stark, in a surprising move, tells Emma he is interested in talking about what their relationship could transform into, after their war is won, but Frost is more focused on the here and now since the future is so murky. The two then share a passionate kiss and embrace, before their intimate encounter becomes even more steamy, getting as close to an R-rated intimate moment as Marvel can show.






 The Future Of Iron Man And Emma Frost&#39;s Marriage Is Unclear 
          

Tony is a man who often hides his troubles behind a suit of armor, while Emma constantly protects herself under her perfect diamond visage. This issue saw Tony opening up to Emma in a real way about his fears, so if their relationship is to deepen even more, Emma will have to let down her emotional walls and allow Stark inside. While many fans would be happy to see Emma and Tony&#39;s relationship end after the war with Orchis is over, others feel like their pairing works surprisingly well, and that the two should remain together in the X-Men&#39;s newest era.

Even though Tony Stark and Emma Frost&#39;s marriage began strictly as one of convenience and access, their fascinating relationship has developed into something more real. The intimate encounter shared between Iron Man and the X-Men&#39;s Emma Frost in this issue shows that their &#34;fake&#34; relationship could be more legitimate than many thought and that the two lovebirds could potentially have a future together at Marvel.




Invincible Iron Man #14 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
