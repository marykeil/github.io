Summary

  Green Arrow discovers he was technically fired from the Justice League after being lost in time and space.   Following the events of Dark Crisis, the Justice League officially disbanded without Green Arrow&#39;s knowledge.   Green Arrow replaces the disbanded Justice League with his family, as the DC Universe sees a lot of change.  







Despite his important role in the Justice League, Green Arrow just found out that he was technically fired. The League often has a rotating cast of characters, but Oliver Queen is a staple as Green Arrow — the character with the strongest connection to the everyday people of Earth. All of that has changed after his latest crisis, both personal and cosmic.

Ever since the events of Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths, Green Arrow has been lost across time and space. His family, which includes fellow Justice League hero Black Canary, has been desperately trying to reunite with him, and they finally do so in Green Arrow #6 by Joshua Williamson, Sean Izaakse, Phil Hester, Trevor Hairsine, and Ande Parks.



          

Ollie has been reunited with his family and is ready to get back to saving the world, but he will soon discover that there isn&#39;t any Justice League for Green Arrow to return to. After the finale of Dark Crisis, the Justice League was disbanded, an event and universe-wide development that Ollie completely missed.




                  1 Powerless Justice League Hero Can Officially Beat Batman - &amp; DC Proved It   An obscure DC villain once showed that there is one Justice League hero in particular who could take down Batman, even without superpowers.   


 The Justice League Has Officially Disbanded After Dark Crisis 
          

The Justice League has been around for a long time and has protected the Earth from some of the greatest threats it has ever faced. But over time, the world has changed, as have the DCU&#39;s iconic teams. After the events of Dark Crisis, certain League members felt that Earth needed something different. Because of this feeling, the Justice League was officially disbanded in Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths by Williamson, Rafa Sandoval, Daniel Sampere, Jackson Herbert, Giuseppe Camuncoli, Cam Smith, Romulo Fajardo Jr., Matt Herms, Alex Guimarães, Alejandro Sánchez, and Tom Napolitano. This decision was agreed on by every member of the Justice League — except Green Arrow, who didn&#39;t make it to the final battle after sacrificing himself, getting lost in both time and space.




Now that Green Arrow has finally made it back to Earth, he finds himself in a world without a Justice League. Green Arrow has been a member of the League for many years and plays a crucial role in it. The League is primarily made up of characters with unbelievable powers, or characters like Batman who aren&#39;t exactly in touch with the ordinary person. Green Arrow always makes sure that the League never becomes too detached from humanity and the needs of the people they live to help. Now that the Justice League is disbanded, Oliver is going to have to find a new place in the DC Universe.



 Green Arrow Replaces the Justice League with His Family 
          

The DC Universe has been seeing a lot of change lately, with the Titans taking over from the Justice League and new characters, such as Red Canary, being introduced. These changes haven&#39;t stopped in Green Arrow&#39;s life either. Now that he&#39;s finally managed to cross time and space and return to his family, he&#39;s found that the biggest team he was a member of, the Justice League, has technically fired him by disbanding without his knowledge.
