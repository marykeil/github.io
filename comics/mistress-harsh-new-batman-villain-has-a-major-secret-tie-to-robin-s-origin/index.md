## Literature Review

Batman and Robin have fought tons of enemies over the years, but now one of the newest threats facing Gotham may have ties to Damian Wayne&#39;s origin.




Warning! Contains spoilers For Batman and Robin #4!Batman&#39;s current Robin has had a pretty rough history, and now it may be coming back to haunt him in the form of his former teacher, Mistress Harsh. Damian Wayne grew up in the League of Assassins and was trained from birth to kill people. He spent a long time in the League and was trained by some of the world&#39;s greatest and most brutal killers, and it seems one of them is returning to see how her old student is doing.




Gotham City has been thrown into turmoil as Batman and Robin are being attacked by an unknown enemy. Old villains, like the Terrible Trio, have gotten major upgrades, and new villains like Shush have appeared. But who the exact mastermind behind these attacks is remains unclear.



          



The biggest hint so far has come in a preview of Batman and Robin #4 by Joshua Williamson, Simone Di Meo, and Steve Wands. In a flashback, readers see one of Damian&#39;s old trainers, who brutally berates him for not living up to her expectations, even smacking him across the face at one point. It&#39;s possible she&#39;s returned to see her old student now.

                  Batman Is Calling Out Robin&#39;s Biggest Flaw - &amp; It&#39;s Pretty Unforgivable   Damian Wayne has been trained to be an assassin his entire life, but now Batman really needs to train the young Robin how to be a human being.   





 Robin Remembers His Teacher Mistress Harsh 
         

When Damian Wayne was born, he lived with the League of Assassins, which was ruled over by his mother, Talia al Ghul, and his grandfather, Ra&#39;s al Ghul. These two tried to mold Damian into being the perfect prince who would eventually inherit the world. This required Damian to be educated, both mentally and physically, so Talia brought in a great number of absurdly well-trained people to hone Damian&#39;s mind and body. But most of these people were perfectionists and trained killers, not the sort to let things go. This is why, after all these years, it&#39;s very likely that the one behind the attacks on Batman and Robin now isn&#39;t a villain from Batman&#39;s past, but from Robin&#39;s.

Robin was trained to be an assassin by a lot of people over the years, but as this preview shows, the woman known as Mistress Harsh clearly stands out in Damian&#39;s memory. As her name would imply, she was an incredibly harsh teacher and wouldn&#39;t settle for anything less than perfection. The preview depicts a particularly grueling training segment where, disappointed with Damian&#39;s performance, Mistress Harsh strikes him across the face. She is then immediately confronted by Talia al Ghul, who obviously doesn&#39;t take kindly to her son being hit by a mere servant. Readers haven&#39;t seen how this interaction ends, but it&#39;s very likely that it does not go well for Mistress Harsh, and she&#39;s now returned for revenge on Damian.






 Damian&#39;s Past Returns To Haunt Him 


          



It&#39;s not uncommon for writers to introduce new villains by using Batman&#39;s past as a way to bring them in. But Damian has almost as varied a past as his father. Having grown up in the League of Assassins for the first ten years of his life, Damian must have met a ton of villainous people. So it&#39;s really no surprise that with Batman and Robin under attack from a new mysterious enemy, it&#39;s possible that it&#39;s none other than Mistress Harsh from Robin&#39;s past.



Batman and Robin #4 will be on sale from DC Comics on December 12!
