## Literature Review

DCâ€™s latest event continues with Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis, an anthology that gives fans some much needed laughs with an unexpected parody.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1!The DC Universe manages to find the humor and heart in its latest chaotic event with Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1. The world may be under attack by animal-human hybrids, but even that manages to be a riot when a crew of DC icons decides to recreate the hit movie Jaws.




Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1 comes from Sina Grace, Riccardo Federici, Frank Tieri, Valentine De Landro, Meghan Fitzmartin, and M.L. Sanapo. The book explores how the DC Universe&#39;s Atlanteans are dealing with Beast Boy&#39;s spores transforming everyone into animal-human hybrids.

          

Tieri and De Landro&#39;s story &#34;Just When You Thought It Was Safe to Go Back in the Water&#34;, however, deals with a local beach being plagued by Black Manta, who has transformed into his namesake and become a &#39;Mantazilla&#39;. Much like the movie Jaws, Vixen, Deadeye, and Captain Boomerang head into the ocean to stop Black Manta, with plenty of commentary riffing on the situation&#39;s similarity to the iconic film.

The beloved Titan Beast Boy has become the latest threat to plague the DC Universe. After transforming into a Starro-like monster to defend Earth, Gar&#39;s mind was wiped, leaving him stuck as a monster that turned on his planet. He unleashed spores that began turning the world&#39;s population into animal-human hybrids. Even worse, the spores are intentionally seeking out the most powerful hosts possible. Batman has become a ravenous wolf creature and the Flash Family is now a swarm of bee monsters. Superman can&#39;t even stop moving lest he be turned into something wild and uncontrollable.

Every story in Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1 is quite entertaining, but Tieri and De Landro&#39;s Jaws tribute is certainly the standout. Most other side stories that have tied into the &#34;Beast World&#34; crossover have been a bit more serious. Tieri gets a lot of mileage out of the idea of animal-human hybrids by playing up how ludicrous the idea could be. De Landro&#39;s art really adds to the story, especially in the splash page that shows off the transformed Black Manta. While it deviates from the mostly serious event, the story works as a much-needed bit of levity.






 DC&#39;s Jaws Moment Came at the Best Time in &#34;Beast World&#34; 
          

&#34;Beast World&#34; has been full of heart-wrenching moments such as Beast Boy&#39;s mind being erased or Batman pleading with Nightwing as Bruce lost his humanity. While it&#39;s been a good event so far, it&#39;s been pretty heavy on the drama. Thankfully, Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1 offers a small reprieve from the event&#39;s more downbeat moments to act out a few moments from a classic movie like Jaws. Is it a bit unconventional? Sure? Is it entertaining? Absolutely. As &#34;Beast World&#34; continues to dominate the DC Universe, seeing a few characters act out Jaws is a welcome sight.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Atlantis #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
