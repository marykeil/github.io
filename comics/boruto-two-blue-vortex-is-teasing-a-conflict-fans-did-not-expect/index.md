## Literature Review

While no one is more happy to see Boruto return to Konoha than Sarada and Sumire, the two women may both have feelings for the returning hero.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #5As the characters in Boruto have come of age after the three-year time skip, romance could also take on a crucial role in Two Blue Vortex, and one budding love triangle could have serious repercussions for Konoha.




Over the course of the story, it was teased that Sarada Uchiha may have feelings for Boruto. While there was never an open admission of romantic feelings, if it weren&#39;t for Sarada, it&#39;s unlikely Boruto would have escaped Eida&#39;s turning the world against him. Sarada helped convince Sasuke, despite his falling under Eida&#39;s Omnipotence powers, to escape with and train Boruto during the time skip.

          

More obvious are Sumire Kakei&#39;s feelings towards Boruto. Originally introduced in the anime as a villain, she was not only thwarted by Boruto but he also helped her in finding redemption and a place among Konoha&#39;s Next Generation. Boruto&#39;s friendship, trust, and support of Sumire led her to develop feelings for him. Now that the hero is finally back in Konoha after three years, it seems that these three young shinobi may be caught in a harem-romcom-style love triangle.





 Boruto&#39;s Homecoming Will Bring Tensions To The Surface 
         

Up until recently, Sarada and Sumire&#39;s feelings towards Boruto have not damaged or infected their relationship with each other. They have a very solid relationship that has been made even stronger by the fact that they both share the secret of being impervious to Eida&#39;s charms. However, their relationship is unlikely to remain so friendly. In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter #5, Sarada made the most public expression of her feelings for Boruto to date. She hugged him in a manner that unequivocally showed her deep affection, and in front of Sumire, who was clearly distressed by the sight.

Even more telling is the way the creator Masashi Kishimoto and artist Mikio Ikemoto illustrate the situation. Before Boruto arrives, Sarada and Sumire are drawn near to each other in friendly conversation. After he arrives, Sarada and Sumire never appear alone together in the remaining panels of the chapter. Moreover, two panels specifically focus on Sumire&#39;s face as Sarada hugs Boruto, and he hugs her back. The final panel in the chapter portrays Boruto and Sarada together with Sumire way off to the side looking at them. The depiction creates a natural tension that pits Sarada and Sumire against one another for Boruto&#39;s attention and affection.






 Love Could Get In The Way Of Konoha&#39;s Future 
          

The tensions created by Sarada and Sumire&#39;s feelings towards Boruto could prove dangerous for all three. First, as the only two people who could confide in each other about their knowledge of what&#39;s really happening in Konoha, conflict between Sarada and Sumire would destroy the camaraderie that they surely developed over the timeskip. Now, with Boruto back - only through collaborative effort will the three be able to conquer the multitude of problems facing them.

Romantic tensions might lead one, or all three, to lose their focus, and at the worst possible time. Not only Boruto and his allies have to solve the situation in Konoha with Kawaki and Eida, and rescue Naruto and Hinata, but now they also have to deal with the self-aware God Trees unwillingly created by Code, who appear as the most dangerous villains the series has ever seen. Romantic tensions will only escalate the complexity of decision-making at a time when a wrong choice may be the difference between life and death. So, while Boruto&#39;s return home was a cause of joy for Sumire and Sarada, the tensions developing among the three of them could spell doom for Konoha&#39;s future.
