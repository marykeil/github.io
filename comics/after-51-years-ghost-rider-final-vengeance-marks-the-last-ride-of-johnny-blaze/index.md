## Literature Review

Johnny Blaze&#39;s time as Ghost Rider is coming to an end, but artist Greg Capullo gives him one last ride in a new variant cover.




After 51 years, Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance will mark the last ride of Johnny Blaze. Next year, a new, darker Ghost Rider will emerge, one eschewing Blaze’s heroic nature. Marvel has remained silent about the new Rider’s identity, promising fans will never guess it. While readers wait to learn more about the new Rider, Johnny Blaze takes his last ride in Greg Capullo’s variant cover of Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance #1.




Marvel shared a first look at Capullo’s cover for Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance #1, written by Benjamin Percy and drawn by Danny Kim, on their website. The cover shows Johnny in full Ghost Rider mode, complete with a blazing skull and chains.

For five decades, Johnny Blaze’s Ghost Rider has been an integral part of the Marvel Universe, and the lore surrounding the character has grown deep. Various creators have not only introduced other Ghost Riders throughout history, but expanded upon the very nature of the Rider itself. Recently, acclaimed writer Benjamin Percy took over the writing reins on Ghost Rider, creating graphic, hard-hitting stories that honor the character’s spirit. Percy has introduced new characters to the mythos, such as Talia Warroad. Now, Johnny Blaze’s world is turned upside down as a new, evil Ghost Rider debuts.





 

There have been multiple Ghost Riders in the modern era alone, but for many, Johnny Blaze is Ghost Rider. First appearing 51 years ago in Marvel Spotlight #5, Ghost Rider has ridden the backroads of the Marvel Universe, dispensing fiery justice to common criminals and demons alike. Ghost Rider has encountered some truly nasty beings in his day, and Percy’s run in the book has significantly upped the ante, introducing readers to horrifying monsters. Percy has also explored the toll being Ghost Rider takes on Johnny Blaze.

 Johnny Has Sought to Escape Ghost Rider All His Life 
          




Johnny has fought to rid himself of the Spirit of Vengeance many times, but fails. He tried walking away as well, only to get pulled back in. It might seem as if someone else was Ghost Rider would be Blaze’s dream, but in reality he must fight to get the Spirit back. Marvel is being coy about the new Ghost Rider’s identity, but it is clearly someone of lesser moral character than Blaze. The new Ghost Rider is a bad person, and Johnny Blaze must leap into action to stop them before it&#39;s too late. Johnny Blaze may be heading for his last ride, but he will make it count.
