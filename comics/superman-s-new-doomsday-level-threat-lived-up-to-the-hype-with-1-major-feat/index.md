Summary

  The Chained lives up to the hype as a Doomsday-level threat, pushing Superman to his absolute limits and leaving him on the verge of death.   Superman discovers that the Chained&#39;s telekinetic barrier is vulnerable to Kryptonite, resulting in Superman using Kryptonite gauntlets to defeat him.   The Chained&#39;s attack leaves Superman on the verge of death, mirroring the situation with Doomsday and leaving a lasting impact on Clark.  







Before Superman&#39;s new villain, the Chained, even appeared, DC promised that he would be a Doomsday-level threat who would push Superman to his absolute limits. Considering how the fight between them ends with Superman barely managing to stay alive, the Chained definitely lived up to the hype.

Superman&#39;s biggest fight in a while is against the Chained, a man experimented upon by Lex Luthor who gained incredible tactile telekinetic abilities. In Superman #8 by Joshua Williamson, Gleb Melnikov, Norm Rapmund, David Baldeon, and Jamal Campbell, it takes the combined might of the Super-Family to bring the Chained down, and even then it comes with a heavy loss.

          

As the Chained rampages through Metropolis, seeking revenge on Lex Luthor, Superman makes the startling discovery that the Chained&#39;s telekinetic barrier can&#39;t protect him from Kryptonite. With this in mind, Superman charges the Chained with Kryptonite gauntlets and defeats him — exposing himself to potentially lethal amounts of Kryptonite in the process. Superman has finally been brought to his knees.




                  Superman&#39;s New Doomsday-Level Villain Has Comics&#39; Rarest Superpower   Superman’s destructive new enemy the Chained is unleashed upon Metropolis and his amazing power has a secret connection to one Super-Family member.   


 Superman Endangers Himself in His Battle with the Chained 


          

Superman has fought many absurdly powerful enemies, so it&#39;s often difficult to conceive of new villains that can reasonably top ones from the past. When the Chained was stated to be a Doomsday-level threat, many fans likely couldn&#39;t see how that was the case, especially considering Doomsday&#39;s powers. Doomsday is a giant hulking monster who beat the Man of Steel to death; the Chained is a very thin, intentionally weak-looking character. He has no physical strength of his own, but his tactile telekinesis is a form of power that Superman has rarely faced, and so the Chained uses it to devastating effect.




While Superman has a host of powers, his biggest is his super-strength. Superman is one of DC&#39;s physically-strongest characters, which is why it was originally so surprising that Superman couldn&#39;t even get near the Chained. Due to the Chained&#39;s tactile telekinesis, he easily erects a barrier that renders super-strength completely useless. Only because Superman was willing to use Kryptonite to bypass this barrier was he able to land a blow at all — but this just ends up repeating a dark situation Superman had found himself in before. Once again, Superman has stopped a shockingly powerful villain from destroying Metropolis, and his reward is to end up lying in the street of his city, on the verge of death.



 Superman Is Once Again Dying in Metropolis 


          

Doomsday is the only villain in Superman&#39;s history who has managed to kill the Man of Steel in his own city — but now the Chained might join that exclusive list. While it&#39;s unclear exactly how Superman will survive the extensive Kryptonite poisoning, this experience will surely leave a lasting mark on Clark that he won&#39;t soon forget. While the Chained doesn&#39;t look like a major threat from his physical appearance alone, there&#39;s no doubt how dangerous he is now that he has hurt Superman in a way that definitely proves him to be a Doomsday-level threat.
