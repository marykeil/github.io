# DC s Multiverse Is Too Dangerous to Exist According to 1 VERY Convincing Villain


## SUMMARY 



  DC villain Gog argues that the existence of the Multiverse brings about more harm than good, considering the destruction and heartache it causes.   The Multiverse in DC Comics is often portrayed as a place where villains and evil versions of heroes emerge, rather than a source of infinite heroes and utopian worlds.   Characters like The Batman Who Laughs and Superboy-Prime, who come from the Multiverse, have only brought destruction, and become threats to the mainstream DC Universe because of their knowledge of it.

## Literature Review

The Multiverse offers an infinite number of possibilities, but only one DC villain is calling it out for perennially causing more harm than good.

One DC Comics villain just pointed out that the Multiverse has only ever caused far more harm than good. The argument made by the cosmic threat known as Gog is actually fairly convincing, considering the amount of destruction and heartache that have resulted entirely due to the existence of the Multiverse.

Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #23 – by Mark Waid, Dan Mora, Tamra Bonvillain, and Steve Wands – presented this critical stance on the confluence of alternate realities that comprises DC&#39;s fictional world. In this story, the Old God Gog argues that the Multiverse has done nothing but bring harm to the people who learn of it.

          

This explains why he has gone out of his way to make sure the Kingdom Come universe doesn&#39;t learn of it. Gog views the Multiverse as fundamentally a place where suffering happens more often that not, and he&#39;s not exactly wrong.




                  In the Era of the Multiverse, Marvel Shouldn&#39;t Forget About Parallel Dimensions   The Multiverse has become a key part of Marvel Comics, but there are threats lurking even closer to home that shouldn&#39;t be forgotten about.   


 Gog Views The Multiverse As Fundamentally Opposed To Its Inhabitants 


          

The DC Multiverse is one of the most widely explored in all comic books. It allows the writers essentially an infinite playground for continuous new takes on the same characters. Writers have used this to play with all kinds of ideas, such as Superman being the President of the United States, or Batman and Joker being the same person. With an infinite number of possible realities, there should be an infinite number of heroes, as well as several universes that are utopias, but that&#39;s rarely how the Multiverse is used.




The Multiverse should have an infinite number of heroes and perfect worlds in it, but the only thing that ever seems to come out of it is villains, and evil versions of heroes. The Crime Syndicate from Earth 3 is a perfect example of this. They&#39;re just a reversed version of the Justice League. There&#39;s also the Dark Multiverse, which is full of evil, twisted versions of characters, like The Batman Who Laughs. This is why Gog argues that knowing about the Multiverse only causes harm, and he isn&#39;t exactly wrong.



 Gog Argues That The Multiverse Destroy Everyones Eventually 


          

Characters like The Batman Who Laughs and Superboy-Prime are characters who came from the Multiverse and only sought to wreak destruction on Earth-0. If these characters had never known about the Multiverse, they wouldn&#39;t have become a threat. While there have been things like Justice Incarnate, overall, the Multiverse has been a net negative. For all the possibilities the Multiverse has, it only ever seems to bring about villains, and Gog is the only character in DC to call it out.
