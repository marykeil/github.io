## Literature Review

Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is a long-running series that&#39;s had its ups and downs. Here&#39;s a ranking of every individual part of the series, up to #1.




Hirohiko Araki&#39;s JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure has run for over 35 years now, telling the stories of various members of the Joestar bloodline. The series has varied a lot over the years, adding new mechanics and elements to the stories and trying out a variety of different protagonists and story types throughout that time. While every part of the story has its redeeming qualities, there&#39;s also no arguing that some parts are more entertaining than others.
Ranking the various installments of JoJo will come down to which ones embody the series at its best. The weirdness and discomfort that sometimes come with it, the unpredictable powers that characters wield, and the quality of the plot that occupies each part are all important things to consider when it comes to ranking JoJo.









 








 9  The JoJoLands - The Newest Jojo is an Unknown 
Original Run: February 2023 - Present, 9 chapters (at time of writing)
        

The JoJoLands is the most recent installment is the ninth part of the series. It may seem unfair to automatically rank it last, but the fact of the matter is that there isn&#39;t yet enough content to really judge The JoJoLands fairly compared to the other parts. The JoJoLands has been very interesting so far, with its criminal protagonist Jodio striking a very different tone than his predecessors. The ranking of The JoJoLands will very likely improve as it goes on and more is known about its characters and story, but for now, it has to remain at the bottom of the list, if only to be fair to the preceding parts.





 8  Phantom Blood - An Incomplete Start to the Series 
Original Run: December 1986 - October 1987, 44 chapters
        

The very first part of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure may also be one of its weakest. The conflict between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando is about as one-dimensional as it gets, with Dio so evil he kicks a dog in the first few pages of the story. Jonathan is also such a brilliant, shining hero that he comes across as a little boring, unfortunately, especially in comparison to his descendants. Phantom Blood also suffers from the lack of Stand abilities, which weren&#39;t created until Part 3, yet became emblematic of the series as a whole. That&#39;s not to say Phantom Blood is bad, by any means, but it just doesn&#39;t quite capture everything that makes JoJo... JoJo.





 7  Golden Wind - A Side Story Worth Reading 
Original Run: December 1995 - April 1999, 155 chapters
        

The fifth part of Jojo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure follows Giorno Giovanna, an offspring of DIO&#39;s from when he was briefly alive and active in the 1980s. Giorno is a gangster who is against the idea of doing crime, which puts a strange contradiction at the heart of his character. It also ends up feeling a bit like a side story, since Giorno&#39;s story is set in Italy and has almost nothing to do with any of the other parts. Giorno&#39;s Stand ability Golden Wind, while interesting, is ultimately a difficult power for a protagonist to be saddled with, which is why its inevitable upgrade ended up being completely different.





 6  Stone Ocean - A Glorious End to JoJo&#39;s Original Timeline 
Original Run: December 1999 - April 2003, 158 chapters


 







Part six of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure got back to the main family line by focusing on Jotaro&#39;s daughter, Jolyne, who is introduced in prison for a crime she didn&#39;t commit. While Stone Ocean is praised overall for being the first to star a female JoJo, Jolyne&#39;s portrayal, particularly in the earliest chapters, isn&#39;t handled very well. Father Puchi and Dio&#39;s Heaven plan is also quite complicated, which can make it a little difficult to follow sometimes. Still, the Stand abilities are perhaps the most creative they&#39;ve been, and the cast of characters may be the most likable outside of Stardust Crusaders.





 5  JoJolion - A Complex Tale of Family and Mystery 
Original Run: May 2011 - August 2021, 110 chapters
        

The eighth part, which ended most recently in 2021, is the longest part by far, having run for 10 years at a monthly schedule. It&#39;s set in a different continuity from parts 1-6, which some fans dislike. However, JoJolion tells a complex tale starring an alternate Josuke Higashikata, a complicated character who can be ruthless and less heroic than some previous Joestars. That&#39;s part of what makes JoJolion so interesting, though; Josuke is able to grow and change as a character in significant ways over the course of its run, and he possesses one of the strangest and most versatile Stand abilities among the main heroes.





 4  Battle Tendency - A Fan Favorite JoJo Debuts 
Original Run: November 1987 - March 1989, 69 chapters
        

JoJo Part Two stars Joseph Joestar is one of the most popular and longest-lasting Jojos, leading to him appearing in the next two parts as well. Joseph is not the bastion of righteousness that his grandfather Jonathan was, and that serves to make him a far more interesting character. The Pillar Men also make fantastic foes, enemies with grandiose ambitions who believe they deserve the right to lord over humanity. While Battle Tendency lacks Stands, like part 1, the creative application of Hamon techniques seen here makes up for that fact. Joseph also happens to be one of the most popular JoJos, and a quick read or watch of Part Two will surely reveal why.





 3  Steel Ball Run - A Grand Tale of Redemption 
Original Run: January 2004 - April 2011, 95 chapters
        

The seventh part of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure was also the first set in a new continuity, going back to the 1800s and starting over, this time with &#34;Johnny&#34; Joestar, an American-born JoJo who starts off as a bitter man thanks to a horseback accident that left him paralyzed. Johnny&#39;s growth over the course of the series is considered some of the best character development that JoJo has to offer, and he becomes a genuinely likable and heroic figure by the end. Steel Ball Run also introduced the new concept of Spin, which would come back again in JoJolion, set in the same continuity.





 2  Diamond is Unbreakable - Mystery in a Small, Cozy Town 
Original Run: May 1992 - December 1995, 174 chapters


 







The fourth installment, Diamond is Unbreakable, is set in the lovable small town of Morioh, which also features in JoJolion and in the Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe spinoffs. The story follows Josuke, Joseph&#39;s son born out of an affair, who grew up without knowing his family history. Josuke is a kind boy with a hotheaded streak that makes for an interesting protagonist, but Morioh really is the star of the show. Diamond is Unbreakable has a huge cast of recurring characters, all of whom have their own fans. It also sees the return of Jotaro Kujo, the preceding JoJo, in a support capacity, meaning this story gives you two JoJos (and an appearance by Joseph!) for the price of one.





 1  Stardust Crusaders - Still The Best JoJo Part 
Original Run: March 1989 - April 1992, 152 chapters


 







When people think generically of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, they&#39;re probably thinking of Part Three: Stardust Crusaders. This part sees Joseph teaming up with his grandson Jotaro to save his daughter and Jotaro&#39;s mother, Holly, sending them on a globetrotting quest to Egypt to defeat a revived Dio. Stardust Crusaders is the part that introduces Stand abilities and has some of the most memorable one-off villains that the series has ever seen.
It&#39;s no exaggeration to say that Stardust Crusaders changed everything for the JoJo franchise moving forward, as all later parts are modeled more closely on it than either Phantom Blood or Battle Tendency. The result is that Stardust Crusaders isn&#39;t just the most influential JoJo part, it&#39;s also still the best.
Regardless of their placement on this ranking list, every part of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is worth checking out for those who enjoy the series. In both anime and manga form, JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is one of the best long-running action series out there, and fans would do well to read up on any parts that they haven&#39;t had a chance to enjoy yet. With The JoJoLands still unfolding, the story of JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure is far from over, and hopefully, it will continue on for a very long time.
