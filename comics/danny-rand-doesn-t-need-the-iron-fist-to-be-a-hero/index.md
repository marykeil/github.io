## Literature Review

In &#34;Luke Cage: Gang War #2&#34; Danny Rand shows he can still be heroic, even without the powers of the Iron Fist, in the character&#39;s return to action.




Warning: Spoilers for Luke Cage: Gang War #2!




Despite no longer being the Iron Fist, Danny Rand has still got it, when it comes to kickin&#39; butt as a true hero. When former Sword Master Lin Lie replaced Danny Rand as the Iron Fist, some fans wondered where this would leave Danny in the Marvel Universe, as a character without his customary heroic identity.



Danny Rand&#39;s latest display of power and endurance, coming in a prominent crossover event, suggests Marvel may have plans for the next phase of his character.




Luke Cage: Gang War #2 – written by Rodney Barnes, with art by Ramon F. Bachs, Andrew Dalhouse, and VC&#39;s Travis Lanham – proves that Danny Rand doesn&#39;t need a costume to be a hero. Danny Rand has not seen too much action since passing over his responsibilities as Iron Fist to Lin Lie.

          




Joining Luke Cage&#39;s team in the midst of Marvel&#39;s &#34;Gang War&#34; is the first significant piece of action Danny has seen since he was Iron Fist. He makes the most of his appearance, showcasing the best of his martial arts skills, proving he does not need the Iron Fist to be a substantial member of any superteam.


 Danny Rand Is More Than Iron Fist 
          

As Marvel&#39;s answer for the Iron Fist&#39;s most problematic feature, Danny Rand passed the mantle over to Lin Lie in 2022. Since then, Danny has mostly settled into being CEO of the Rand Corporation, accordingly having been demoted to something more of a supporting player, if not a background character. For instance, in Rainbow Rowell&#39;s She-Hulk series, specifically She-Hulk #11, Danny is relegated to &#34;the peanut gallery,&#34; as he&#39;s merely seen in the background of Jen&#39;s Punch Club, watching instead of participating. This changes when his old partner Luke Cage asks Danny to join him, Jessica Jones, and Cloak &amp; Dagger as a new superhero team, to clean up New York City.




In Luke Cage: Gang War #2, the newly formed team take on Alistair Smythe, and Danny is depicted as holding his own alongside the team in a fight with Smythe&#39;s robots. Later, Danny gets a spotlight all to himself when Cage orders him to get to Smythe&#39;s lab. He uses his agility to evade an array of laser detectors, before facing down a horde of robots all by himself for as long as he can. Danny Rand&#39;s latest display of power and endurance, coming in a prominent crossover event, suggests Marvel may have plans for the next phase of his character.



 Without Iron Fist, New Storytelling Possibilities Are Wide Open For Danny Rand 


          

Luke Cage: Gang War #2 is a reminder of exactly what Danny Rand remains capable of, something that creative teams may have forgotten since he lost those powers in the last year. He still may be limited in what he can and can&#39;t do, but he&#39;s not useless, as evident by this issue. It appears as though Marvel has been at a loss for what to do with Danny now that he&#39;s Fist-less, but this issue shows readers a path forward for the character. It proves that he doesn&#39;t need the Iron Fist to be a hero, just badass martial arts skills and the heart of a hero.
