## Literature Review

With the Justice League disbanded, a new team has risen to from the shadows of World&#39;s Greatest Heroes - but they&#39;ve still got plenty of room to grow.




The Justice League have always been DC Comics’ primary superhero team. Even when the roster was missing icons like Superman, Wonder Woman, or Batman, the League itself still operated as the de facto first line of defense for Earth. However, with the Justice League disbanded, 2023 finally saw DC Comics give another team its long-overdue chance to fill the League’s shoes – and the Titans are living up to their newfound role.






DC&#39;s current Titans series is by the creative team of Tom Taylor, Nicola Scott, Annette Kwok, and more.




With the ongoing events of Titans: Beast World taking center stage in the DC Universe, the Titans are officially on the front lines like never before. 

          

Prior to the events of Beast World, it was Nightwing who saved the entire Multiverse during Dark Crisis On Infinite Earths, while the Titans as a whole have been working on reforestation efforts spearheaded by Beast Boy in the pages of Titans before saving the world from the Necrostar. Ultimately, putting the Titans at the heart of the DC Universe has helped a few Titans reach their fullest potential – but there’s still room for growth.




                  End of an Era: DC&#39;s Justice League Generation Officially Falls from Power   DC&#39;s Beast World event hammers home that the Justice League has truly fallen form power — now is the time of the Titans in the DC Universe.   


 The Titans Are Long Overdue For The Spotlight 


          

Stepping up to the plate to replace their predecessors as DC Comics’ primary superhero team hasn’t been an easy transition for the Titans. Still, it has given the young heroes their time to shine both as a unit – and, in the cases of Nightwing, Beast Boy, and Cyborg, in particular, to thrive individually as heroes. Unfortunately, this higher prominence also comes at a cost, as the Titans are exposed to DC Comics’ most dangerous forces, and placed under greater scrutiny than ever by the citizens of the DC Universe, as well as by fans and readers themselves as well.




With this added focus comes increased pressure for the Titans to live up to their mentors. Their first foray against a global, Justice League-level threat will ultimately determine how well they can live up to expectations, when all is said and done. So far, the team has done an admirable job of filling their predecessors’ footsteps, even if there are those who haven’t quite taken them as seriously as they should. In any case, the more time the Titans get in the spotlight, the more opportunity they’ll have to prove any doubters wrong, while also giving some of the team’s less highlighted heroes, including Starfire, Raven, and, Donna Troy their own chance to stand out.



 The Titans Aren’t Teenagers Anymore 
          

Even before filling in for the Justice League, the Titans had long since earned their stripes as one of DC Comics’ premiere superhero teams. Now that the former sidekicks have kicked it up a notch, heroes like Nightwing, Starfire, and the others finally have the opportunity to cement their status as the A-List heroes their fans know them to be. And with the Justice League still taking the back seat for the foreseeable future, the world will have to get used to placing its protection in the capable hands of DC Comics’ Titans.
