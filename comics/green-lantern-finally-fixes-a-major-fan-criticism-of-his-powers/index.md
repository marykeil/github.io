## Literature Review

When Green Lanternâ€™s nemesis threatens to burn the Earth, Hal Jordan whips up a construct that saves the day and proves his critics wrong.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #6!After years of complaints, Green Lantern has gone above and beyond with his latest and most amazing construct. Hal Jordan&#39;s greatest nemesis Sinestro has returned with a powerful upgrade and he&#39;s threatening the DC Universe. To stop him, the Emerald Knight busts out one of the best forms he&#39;s ever constructed with his Power Ring.




In Green Lantern #6 by Jeremy Adams, Xermanico, and Scott Godlewski, Hal Jordan is fighting his nemesis Sinestro with his new Red Lantern upgrade. Sinestro uses the out-of-control energy to violently attack his most hated enemy, as Hal tries his best to keep up.

          

Using his newfound powers, Sinestro creates a construct that resembles a giant kaiju and threatens to tear the Earth in half. In response, Hal pushes his new Power Ring and creates a giant mecha to fight and successfully defeat his enemy. Green Lantern is victorious, but Sinestro&#39;s new powers allow him to leave Earth&#39;s orbit and return to his home planet.

In a shocking turn of events, Hal Jordan left the Green Lantern Corps after it was taken over by the intergalactic authority, the United Planets. While Hal was no longer a member of the Corps, he returned to his role as a hero with a new Power Ring fashioned from residual willpower from an old set of Manhunter armor. Hal wasn&#39;t alone on the now-quarantined Earth as his enemy Sinestro wound up trapped on the planet, unable to leave after he found himself unable to channel the Yellow Light of Fear. However, thanks to aberrations in the Emotional Spectrum, Sinestro found himself able to access the Red Light of Rage.

Thanks to their Power Rings, Green Lanterns can make any kind of construct they need to fight evil. Despite having a weapon that can make literally anything Hal can think of, he&#39;s often been criticized for making constructs that lack imagination. Compared to Kyle Rayner or John Stewart, two Lanterns that use their artistic skills to produce extremely imaginative manifestations, Hal&#39;s constructs come up short. It&#39;s never stopped him from getting the job done, but Jordan&#39;s tendency to rely on his favorite constructs is a bit tired. However, this amazing mecha Green Lantern has produced proves he&#39;s much more creative than critics give him credit for.






 Hal Jordan Proves He&#39;s a Truly Creative Green Lantern 
          

Hal Jordan is a pragmatic Green Lantern and he&#39;s more concerned about accomplishing his goals rather than expressing himself creatively with his ring. But just because Green Lantern doesn&#39;t often make grand or fantastic constructs doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t. Sure, John or Kyle might be better known for creating things that require a bit more effort. However, Hal has been wearing his ring longer than most Earthlings, and when the situation requires it, Green Lantern can bust out a kickass construct to defeat his worst enemies.

Green Lantern #6 is on sale now from DC Comics.
