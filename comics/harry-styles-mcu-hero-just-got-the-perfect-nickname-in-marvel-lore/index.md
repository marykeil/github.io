Eros, aka Starfox, tries to flirt with Emma in Invincible Iron Man #13, but she swiftly shuts him down, giving him the derisive nickname &#34;Hornfox&#34; in the process.

## Literature Review

An Eternal god, Iron Man, and Emma Frost all go undercover on an intergalactic heist - but all Thanos&#39;s brother got was this lousy new nickname.




Warning: Spoilers for The Invincible Iron Man #13!




Eros, played by Harry Styles in the MCU Eternals film, just got a perfect new nickname. Tony Stark and his wife, Emma Frost, hitch a ride with the Eternal, also known as Starfox, in The Invincible Iron Man #13. Though he&#39;s often thought of as a god of love and pleasure, he struggles to break through the White Queen&#39;s icy demeanor, as she begins calling him &#34;Hornfox.&#34;

Invincible Iron Man #13 – written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Juan Frigeri, Bryan Valenza, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna – shows that while Tony Stark and Emma Frost&#39;s marriage is one of alliance in wartime, the two do get along quite well. When Starfox takes the couple to Gameworld on a heist, he turns on the charm with Emma, both to she and Tony&#39;s chagrin.



          




After enough of his double, and single, entendres, Emma officially dubs Eros with his new nickname, all while Mrs. and Mr. Frost plot to steal a massive hold of Mysterium from the planet&#39;s casino.

                  Starfox: Harry Styles&#39; MCU Hero Returns to Marvel Canon with New Link to Tony Stark   With his money gone and everything going wrong, Iron Man is teaming up with the Eternals’ most controversial member Starfox for a mission into space.   


 Emma And Tony Refused To Let Love Tear Them Apart 
          

Emma and Tony&#39;s marriage has already come a long way from its humble beginnings. When Tony first &#34;proposed,&#34; Emma rolled her eyes and said, &#34;I didn&#39;t think this hellish day could get any worse.&#34; Orchis devastated the mutant population at the Hellfire Gala, and stole Stark Industries out from under Tony: the two had a common enemy, making their union a tactical decision. While wearing the guise of a mundane alter ego, Hazel Kendal, and a wedding ring with psionic-masking tech inside, Emma Frost can evade capture, or worse, from Orchis. Feilong and Orchis are keeping an eye on Tony, and masquerading as a newlywed takes some of the heat off of him.




However, even at their quickie Vegas wedding, Tony knew that Emma was going to break his heart. This may be why, when Starfox starts his flirting, Tony tells him to back off, even as he enjoys Emma&#39;s reactions. Eros&#39;s powers affect the pleasure centers of the brain, which has meant the character has undergone some retooling in the past few years. In Kieron Gillen&#39;s A.X.E.: Judgment Day, the Eternal himself had discomfort with his powers. His days of problematic flirting may be over, but it seems he&#39;s still used to making others swoon. Emma rejects his cheesy pick-up lines, but it also seems she&#39;s deliberately choosing Tony.



 &#34;Hornfox&#34; Gets Some Laughs, But Also Strengthens Tony &amp; Emma&#39;s Bond 
          

Invincible Iron Man #13 has quite a few winks for the reader throughout the course of the issue, as Tony and Emma shine while planning their caper. Howard the Duck has a cameo once the trio hits Gameworld, Emma and Tony have a sexy update to a classic Marvel move – and, furthering the Harry Styles connection, Tony&#39;s narration references their journey as heading in &#34;one direction.&#34; Overall, the issue ends in a romantic moment for the couple, their connection seemingly strengthened by Eros having tried to come between them. As it turns out, Starfox hoped for an exciting getaway with some attractive people, but all Harry Styles&#39;s character from the MCU Eternals movie got was a new nickname.




The Invincible Iron Man #13 is available now from Marvel Comics.
