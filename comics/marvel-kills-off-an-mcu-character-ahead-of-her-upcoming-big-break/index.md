## Literature Review

While the MCU has teased a big role for Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine for a while, it seems that the comics have already killed her off.




Warning: Spoilers for Thunderbolts (2023) #1 ahead! While the MCU has been teasing Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine as one of its next major players in the wake of S.H.I.E.L.D&#39;s destruction, her time in the limelight is suddenly in jeopardy with the death of her comic counterpart. The new Thunderbolts series reveals that not only has the Contessa died off-screen, but it turns out that she has been dead for a long while.




Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Geraldo Borges&#39; Thunderbolts (2023) centers around Bucky Barnes forming a team to kill the Red Skull once and for all. His hand-picked operatives include the Contessa, Sharon Carter (now the Destroyer) and Red Guardian. Upon assaulting the Red Skull&#39;s fortress in the series&#39; first issue, the Contessa is pinned by one of the Red Skull&#39;s guards, who gleefully attempts to strangle her.

          

Instead, the Contessa&#39;s face splits open to reveal a cannon; to the man&#39;s horror, she coldly informs him that the original Contessa died eight years ago, and that she is in fact a Life-Model Decoy backup. She then obliterates the unfortunate henchman.


 The Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine Is Dead 
          




Introduced in 1967 in Jim Steranko, John Romita, and Marie Severin&#39;s Strange Tales #159, the Contessa has served as a spy, double agent, and overall femme fatale throughout Marvel&#39;s espionage community, acting as a pivotal performer in organizations such as S.H.I.E.L.D, Leviathan, and Hydra. In 2011&#39;s Secret Warriors #28 by Jonathan Hickman, Alessandro Vitti, and IFS, the Contessa gives herself up into Russian custody; since then, her appearances have been sparse. In the MCU, the Contessa is played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus; introduced in The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, she would go on to appear in a post-credits scene in Black Widow, with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever establishing her as the new head of the CIA.

This reveal of the Contessa&#39;s death heavily implies that she never made it out of prison after her surrender at the end of Secret Warriors. While the Marvel Universe&#39;s timeline is fairly loose, the dates line up: if Thunderbolts takes place in its publication date of 2023, that would put the Contessa&#39;s death somewhere around 2015, during which she could still feasibly be imagined to be in prison (having surrendered in 2011). The offhand reveal of the Contessa&#39;s death is a shocking revelation about a major Marvel figure, particularly with her relevance to upcoming films.






 Thunderbolts Simultaneously Revives And Kills Off The Contessa 
          

On one hand, having the Contessa as a major player in Thunderbolts sets her up to be prominent in the reader&#39;s consciousness ahead of her role in the MCU&#39;s upcoming Thunderbolts film, scheduled for a 2025 release; her LMD status also gives her new powers and abilities to play with. On the other hand, the Contessa has an extensive history that entwines with many of Marvel&#39;s major players, so killing off and replacing the character comes across as an exceedingly abrupt move when building awareness of her for her upcoming feature role. Either way, it is certainly an unexpected twist - and one that leaves Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine&#39;s future in the MCU extremely difficult to read.
