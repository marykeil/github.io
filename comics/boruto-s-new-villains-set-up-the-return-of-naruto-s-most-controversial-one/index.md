# Boruto s New Villains Set Up The Return Of Naruto s Most Controversial One


## SUMMARY 



  The emergence of new powerful villains in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex poses a greater threat than the Ten-Tails Beast, as they possess the ability to absorb chakra and control their hunger.   The possibility of Kaguya Otsutsuki&#39;s return is hinted at by the new villains, who possess Rinnegan-shaped eyes and potentially have access to the Six Paths Technique.   The Six Paths Technique and other powers granted from the Rinnegan could be used to bring back Kaguya, which opens up another interesting possibility for the future of the series.

## Literature Review

While Borutoâ€™s new villains pose an immediate danger, an even more foreboding threat is their potential ability to bring back Naruto&#39;s final villain.




Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex #4With the emergence of a new group of all-powerful villains in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex an even more frightening possibility looms at the horizons for the heroes of the series: the return of Naruto&#39;s final and most controversial villain, Kaguya Otsutsuki.




In Boruto: Two Blue Vortex Chapter #4, Boruto and Code are given a terrible fright when four unknown entities appear out of nowhere and attack them. As it turns out, these new powerful villains are born from Code&#39;s Claw Grimes - monster soldiers formed from parts of the Ten-Tails Beast - when they bite and entrap a human victim. The combination ultimately produces a Divine Tree in a humanoid form that Code aptly identifies as &#34;self-aware Divine Trees&#34;.

          

Apparently, the threat they pose is much greater than the Ten-Tails Beast itself. Instead, the four not only have the Ten-Tails Beast&#39;s ability to absorb the chakra out of all living things, but also the abilities of their victims and the rationality to control their hunger while considering the best way to accomplish their goal.





 Boruto&#39;s New Villains Could Bring Back Kaguya Through The Six Paths Technique 
          

If the appearance of the four wasn&#39;t ominous enough, an off-hand comment by one of the group members foreshadows even greater danger: &#34;Chakra - all life on a planet. Both current as well as past and long dead&#34;. This opens up ever so slightly the possibility of the return of Kaguya Otsutsuki, the progenitor of all chakra that currently exists on the planet. This possibility is based on two elements. First, based on their Rinnegan-shaped eyes, the four villains could be able to use the Six Paths Technique. Indeed, as discussed in Naruto Chapter #449, one power of the Six Paths Technique, known as the Outer Path, allows a user to revive the dead, which could include Kaguya.

Second, while Rinnegan is a requirement for the Six Path Technique, it also has several standalone powers. For instance, Urashiki was able to use the Rinnegan to travel back in time and redo events. The comment suggests that the new group of villains can access the Rinnegan&#39;s powers, which means they can go back in time and ensure that Kaguya survives. Lastly, there&#39;s also the fact that Rinnegan can break normally unbreakable seals - such as the one used by Naruto and Sasuke to seal Kaguya into her own dimension, using the same Six Paths technique. Assuming that Kaguya is not dead (Naruto&#39;s ending was not completely clear on that point), Rinnegan can be used to break the seal and recall her to the current shinobi world.






 All Evidence Suggests The New Villains Possess Rinnegan 
          

Outside the comment, there is plenty of alternate evidence that one of the new villains possesses the Rinnegan, and therefore can perform the Six Paths Technique. Specifically, there is a shot of the leader-like figure floating above the Kara headquarters. In that shot, we can see a Rinnegan symbol that Urashiki possessed. The icon is also tattooed on this chest. In addition, the clothing of the floating figure has the same spiral icon and accompanying dots that were also seen on Obito and Naruto when they tap into their Six Paths power abilities. The patterns are different, but the symbolism cannot be a coincidence.

Moreover, Sasuke is one of the victims of the Claw Grimes that &#34;gave birth&#34; to one of the new villains, who has already shown it can use Chidori. As Sasuke possessed the Rinnegan (even if it was destroyed), then the self-aware Divine Tree could surely have the same power. Finally, the reference to &#34;all chakra&#34; makes the most sense if it ties back to the original Otsutsuki, Kaguya. Regardless if Naruto&#39;s final villain comes back or not, Boruto: Two Blue Vortex has introduced yet another exciting possibile development in its plot, proving to be truly one of the best new series of 2023.
