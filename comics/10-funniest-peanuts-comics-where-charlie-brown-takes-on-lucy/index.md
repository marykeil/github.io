 4  Lucy&#39;s Question 
Published April 15, 1954

The comedic twist unfolds when it&#39;s later unveiled that &#34;None of your business&#34; is, in fact, the legitimate answer to Lucy&#39;s query, rather than Charlie Brown simply dismissing her.

Despite Lucy&#39;s less-than-ideal response, Charlie Brown&#39;s commendable moment lies in his bold challenge to Lucy&#39;s behavior.
