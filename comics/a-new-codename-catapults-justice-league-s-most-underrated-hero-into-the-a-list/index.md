## Literature Review

Christmas comes early for one overlooked Justice League member as a fresh codename decks the halls of heroism, catapulting them into the A-list.




Warning: Potential spoilers for DC&#39;s &#39;Twas the Mite Before Christmas #1!This holiday season brings a momentous shift for Booster Gold as he unveils a fresh codename, propelling the once underrated Justice League member into the illustrious A-List roster of DC heroes. This new moniker heralds a transformative phase in Booster&#39;s superhero journey and comes with a unique set of responsibilities that are as festive as they are downright hilarious.




Nestled within the pages of DC&#39;s 80-page holiday extravaganza, &#39;Twas the Mite Before Christmas #1, The Santa Copies emerges as a whimsical gem among the eight mini-stories. Crafted by Jillian Grant and illustrated by Rebekah Isaacs, this festive tale plunges Booster Gold into an unexpected role.



          

As Santa Claus becomes indisposed, Booster Gold finds himself reluctantly donning the iconic red suit and assuming the responsibilities of the jolly old saint. The consequence? The coveted codename â€“ Santa Claus. Now, the once-boisterous Booster Gold must embrace his newfound yuletide persona to save Christmas, treating readers to a can&#39;t-miss holiday treat of hilarious proportions.

The Santa Copies narrative kicks off as Booster bears witness to Santa being struck by what he letter learns is a &#34;replication device.&#34; Here, the holiday chaos escalates when Rip Hunter, Booster&#39;s trusty time-traveling companion, arrives on the scene, having diligently tracked the device through the vast expanse of space and time. Acting on impulse and in blissful ignorance of Rip&#39;s impending caution, Booster approaches Santa to check his pulse. Unbeknownst to him, this simple act creates a chain reaction, activating the replicator. In a surprising turn, Booster begins to undergo a transformation, morphing into Santa Claus and unwittingly stepping into the iconic role.

Booster Gold&#39;s brief adoption of the iconic codename Santa Claus provides a festive twist to his superhero identity and catapults him momentarily into the same echelon of recognition as legendary figures like Batman and Superman. Much like the household resonance of Batman and Superman, Santa Claus occupies a revered space as a universally recognized and respected hero within the DC universe. Hence, Booster Gold&#39;s embracing of the new codename Santa Claus positioned him among the esteemed pantheon of legendary DC heroes, if only momentarily. This whimsical yet substantial layer adds a delightful dimension to Booster Gold&#39;s superhero persona, marking a memorable and unexpected chapter in his superhero journey.
