## Literature Review

In the latest iteration of the Ultimate Universe, Marvel has taken an iconic character from Spider-Man comics and films and given him a fresh spin.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Ultimate Spider-Man #1 (2024)From his first appearance in Sam Raimi&#39;s Spider-Man to his most recent turn in the MCU&#39;s Spider-Man: No Way Home, J. K. Simmons&#39;s J. Jonah Jameson has been considered the gold standard in adapting any Marvel character to the big screen. Now, Ultimate Spider-Man #1 reimagines J. Jonah Jameson for a new universe, in a massive departure from previous film and comic book portrayals.




Ultimate Spider-Man (Vol. 2) #1 – from the creative team of Jonathan Hickman, Marco Checchetto, Matthew Wilson, and Cory Petit – depicts a brand-new Spider-Man story, as an adult Peter Parker finds himself becoming a superhero in a universe radically different from Marvel&#39;s familiar continuity. Peter, married to MJ Watson with two children, still works as a journalist for the Daily Bugle, led by J. Jonah Jameson.

          

In this universe, Jameson has a notably softer personality, at least in his relationship to Peter. What&#39;s more, in an even bigger departure from Spider-Man canon, Jameson leaves the Bugle and starts a new publication side-by-side with his managing editor, Ben Parker – who is still alive into Peter&#39;s adulthood.

                  New Ultimate Spider-Man Beautifully Subverts Everything Fans Thought They Knew (Review)   Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate Spider-Man #1 gloriously upends everything fans thought they knew about the Wall-Crawler&#39;s lore.   





 Ultimate J. Jonah Jameson Is A Friend To Peter (and Ben) Parker 
          

As with the original Ultimate Universe in the early 2000s, the new Ultimate Universe gives Marvel the chance to create an entirely fresh, modern continuity with massive changes. The new Ultimate universe was born in Marvel&#39;s Ultimate Invasion, where the Maker left Earth-616 with plans to craft a new world in his image. In his newly shaped Universe, the Maker carefully curated the world&#39;s superheroes, either by killing them, preventing their origins, or enlisting them as part of his world-conquering council. The Maker has since been sealed away after a battle with Howard Stark. Now, Tony Stark and Reed Richards seek to return the powers stolen from heroes.



In the Marvel Multiverse, the new Ultimate Universe is designated Earth-1610. The original Ultimate Universe was Earth-6160, while the main Marvel continuity is Earth-616.







There are many notable differences to Spider-Man&#39;s mythos in this new universe. One of the largest is the reversal of Uncle Ben surviving while Aunt May dies (in Ultimate Universe #1). Ben works at the Daily Bugle as managing editor alongside J. Jonah Jameson, who remains editor-in-chief. Though the gruff Jameson has come to be portrayed a friend and mentor of Peter&#39;s, rather than an antagonist, the Ultimate characterization of their relationship is certainly lighter in nature. In a comedic reveal, Jonah warmly welcomes Peter to work, while barking his classic &#34;PARKER!&#34; at Ben instead. He later lends Peter a tie and asks him to check in on Ben before a memorial.



 Jonah &amp; Ben Are Starting A Newspaper – and They Want Pictures of Spider-Man 


          

The relationship dynamics between Ben, Jonah, and Peter are highlights of Ultimate Spider-Man #1, and they will seemingly get more interesting going forward. When Kingpin demands they halt their investigation of the attack that cost May&#39;s life – an attack The Maker&#39;s council framed Tony Stark for – both Ben and Jonah quit the Bugle, vowing to start their own paper instead. They&#39;re different men – Ben is committed to the truth, while Jonah will simply settle for not lying – who make a shockingly great team. Better still is seeing how they interact with an adult Peter, both as father figures. It&#39;s a thrilling development for all three classic characters.




With Ben and Jonah starting their own publication, it will be interesting to see how the two interact to the debut of Spider-Man. As the newly released cover for Ultimate Spider-Man #4 shows, Ben will look into the hero himself for their paper. If Jonah falls into his old ways of hating Spider-Man, it would hurt Peter a lot more, considering their relationship in this continuity. It would be even worse if Uncle Ben, Peter&#39;s moral compass, was distrustful, or even hateful towards Spider-Man. The new series has rebooted these Spider-Man icons in fresh, interesting ways, with loads of story potential – exactly as Ultimate Marvel is meant to do.

Ultimate Spider-Man #1 is available from Marvel Comics now.
