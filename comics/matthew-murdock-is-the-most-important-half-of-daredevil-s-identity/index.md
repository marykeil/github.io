# Matthew Murdock Is the Most Important Half of Daredevil s Identity


## SUMMARY 



  Daredevil believes his vigilantism is useless without his ability to advocate for better laws.   Through his legal practice, Daredevil represents disenfranchised clients and fights for justice.   Daredevil&#39;s ability to change laws sets him apart from other heroes who rely solely on physical force.

## Literature Review

Daredevil admits that his vigilantism is useless if he is not also able to address the wrongs in the legal system as lawyer Matt Murdock.




Warning: Spoilers for Daredevil: Black Armor (2023) #1 ahead!Daredevil is all but unique among superheroes in that he fights crime in both of his identities: stopping criminals in the act as Daredevil, and improving the laws to protect society as lawyer Matt Murdock. In fact, while Daredevil is an outlet for all of Murdock&#39;s frustration and rage, he admits to himself that all of his vigilantism is toothless without his also being in a position to advocate for better laws.




Taking place during writer D.G Chichester&#39;s 1991-1995 run on Daredevil, Daredevil: Black Armor (2023) #1 by D.G. Chichester, Netho Diaz, JP Mayer, and Andrew Dalhouse takes readers back to when Matthew Murdock was believed to be dead. Adopting a new life as &#34;Jack Batlin,&#34; Murdock nevertheless laments being severed from the courts, thinking, &#34;what the courts can&#39;t fix, fists can...but what violence can solve, the law should.&#34;



          

To that end, &#34;Jack Batlin&#34; puts up fliers advertising his new practice of dispensing free legal advice to those who may not be able to afford it, naming his business &#34;Street Legal.&#34;

                  Daredevil&#39;s &#34;New Catchphrase&#34; Proves His Big Difference to Spider-Man   Despite the fact that they&#39;re both acrobatic, neighborhood vigilantes, the public response to Daredevil and Spider-Man could not be more different.   





 Daredevil Believes He Is Useless Without Being Able To Advocate For Justice 
          

Daredevil&#39;s position as lawyer Matthew Murdock makes him one of the few superheroes to attack crime from either side of the mask. While Jennifer Walters (She-Hulk) also practices law, her cases tend to focus on superheroics; Murdock&#39;s practice has traditionally remained open to more disenfranchised clients. As stated in this issue, Murdock relies on &#34;both [his] faiths...the church and the courts&#34; to pursue justice. This gives him a strong moral and ethical core that both sets him apart from mere vigilantism and provides a compelling contrast with his violent actions as Daredevil.

This passage highlighting the importance of legal advocacy to Daredevil&#39;s war on crime throws 2023&#39;s other issues in sharp relief: specifically, the final issues of Chip Zdarsky, Marco Checchetto, and Matthew Wilson&#39;s Daredevil (2022). In that story, Daredevil&#39;s attempt to abandon his identity as Matt Murdock in order to take on a more superheroic lifestyle comes crumbling down around him. His fists and will alone are not enough to enact the changes he desires, literally leading him alone into Hell. His new life as &#34;Father Matthew&#34; in Saladin Ahmed, Aaron Kuder, and Jesus Aburtov&#39;s Daredevil (2023) sees him attempting to compensate for his loss of legal standing by taking a role within the church and working with foster children. However, it becomes clear from the pressure his shelter faces from legal forces, as well as his difficulty in balancing his vigilante desires with the needs of the children in his care, that he cannot affect the same change he could as a lawyer.






 Daredevil&#39;s Greatest Gift Is Advocating Fair Laws 
          

There are countless heroes who stop criminals with their fists; Daredevil is one of the rare few who can fight criminals and then change the laws that enable them. Without &#34;Matt Murdock, Attorney at Law,&#34; Daredevil sinks dangerously close to being just another brooding antihero. No matter which costume he wears, Daredevil knows that, ultimately, his best armor is his courtroom suit.
