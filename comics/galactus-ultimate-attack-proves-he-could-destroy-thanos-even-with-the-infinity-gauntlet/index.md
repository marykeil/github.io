# Galactus  Ultimate Attack Proves He Could Destroy Thanos (Even with the Infinity Gauntlet)


## SUMMARY 



  Galactus shows he can defeat Thanos, even with the Infinity Gauntlet, with the right amount of prep time in Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #5.   Galactus is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe, with very few peers, such as the Living Tribunal and the One-Above-All.   The Infinity Gauntlet has a weakness: it can only work in the universe it was created in, and Galactus could exploit this weakness to defeat Thanos.

## Literature Review

Thanos nearly killed Galactus with the Infinity Gauntlet, but the planet-eaters&#39; ultimate attack could have countered the Mad Titan.




Warning: contains potential spoilers for Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #5!




Galactus’ ultimate attack proves he could handily defeat Thanos, even if he was wearing the Infinity Gauntlet. The Mad Titan has tangled with Galactus on several occasions, most notably in 1991’s Infinity Gauntlet, a meeting that ended in the planet-eater’s defeat. However, in a preview for Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #5, Galactus shows that, with just the right amount of prep time, he could easily dispatch Thanos.

Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #5 is written by Ron Marz and drawn by Ron Lim. In the previous issue, Galactus banished the Silver Surfer from our reality, to a black void outside of time and space. The preview opens with the Surfer becoming aware of his surroundings as well as what Galactus did to him. Although the void is immense, the Surfer is able to escape, summoning all of his power and entering Mephisto’s realm.

         




The preview ends there with the Silver Surfer and Mephisto sparring with each other verbally.


 Very Few Marvel Characters Can Defeat Galactus 
          

Galactus is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe, an immense world destroyer that helps maintain cosmic balance. He has very few peers in the Marvel Universe, with only the Living Tribunal and the One-Above-All outranking him. Despite his great power, Galactus has tasted defeat on many occasions, usually at the hands of Earth’s heroes, and in some cases even his heralds. Thanos came close to killing Galactus during the Infinity Gauntlet miniseries. Super-charged with the six Infinity Stones, Thanos easily trounced Galactus, imprisoning him alongside other cosmic beings, including the In-Betweener and two Celestials.

For all the power contained within it, the Infinity Gauntlet has one serious weakness: it can only work in the universe that created it. The Infinity Stones draw their powers from the fabric of the realities that created them. In other words, if Thanos took the Gauntlet to another world in the multiverse, he would no longer be able to use it. Both the comics and the MCU have played around with this idea, most notably during Loki’s first season. In one episode, Loki attempts to use a Stone against the TVA, only to find it is now useless–and Galactus could duplicate this strategy.




                  Thanos Is Responsible For The Birth of Marvel&#39;s Deadliest Symbiote   Thanos is one of the most dangerous aliens in Marvel, and because of him, Earth has to deal with the most deadly serial killer ever known.   



 Galactus Has a Way Forward to Defeat Thanos in the Future 
          

The most obvious question this tactic raises is why Galactus did not do it during the Infinity Gauntlet. Galactus has always possessed the power to shunt people out of reality, so why did he not do it with Thanos? It comes down to a lack of prep time: in the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos attacked quickly, forcing Galactus to think on his feet. Galactus did not have the time to think a strategy through as he was in survival mode. While the Infinity Stones are currently scattered across the universe, the possibility that someone, like Thanos, could assemble them again is very real, but Galactus’ ultimate attack can counter it.




Silver Surfer Rebirth: Legacy #5 is on sale January 3 from Marvel Comics!
