## Literature Review

With less than a day to go, the Kickstarter for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness has officially broken the $1,000,000 barrier.




The Kickstarter for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness has officially surpassed $1,000,000, as fans show up in droves to support the remastered roleplaying game. With an original goal of just $250,000, the game was fully funded in just four hours, and fans have been unlocking new bonuses and stretch goals ever since.




Having reached $1,000,000, fans have unlocked both a set of playing cards with art from the game (available to add to their orders) and the creation of a new miniature depicting the popular Fugitoid character, along with rules for playing the Turtles&#39; ally in the game. Via a Kickstarter update, Palladium Books has also revealed Kevin Eastman&#39;s variant covers for the foil editions and Sean Owen Roberson&#39;s interior art for the project, previewed below.

         

While $1,000,000 is a major milestone, Palladium Books has planned new stretch goals up to $1,400,000, including the introduction of an April O&#39;Neil miniature. That means that with less than a day left of the campaign, fans still have a reason to back the project. These additional goals are:




 Milestone  Unlocked  Conditions   $1,100,000  New Karai art and character-specific rules.  Included free at all levels in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness book.   $1,200,000  Triceraton Miniature and new rules for &#39;mystery mutant&#39;  Triceraton miniature will be added to the TMNT Villains miniature set, while rules for a new mutant animal (decided by fan poll) will be free at all levels in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness book.   $1,300,000  Doc Feral Miniature and new rules for &#34;mystery mutant&#34;  Doc Feral miniature will be added to the TMNT Villains miniature set, while rules for a new mutant animal (decided by fan poll) will be free at all levels in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness book.   $1,400,000  April O&#39;Neil Miniature and new rules for &#34;mystery mutant&#34;  April O&#39;Neil miniature will be added to the TMNT Heroes miniature set, while rules for a new mutant animal (decided by fan poll) will be free at all levels in TMNT &amp; Other Strangeness book.

 TMNT Reaches 4x Its Original Goal 
Fans Supported Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness in a Big Way
         

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness is a 1985 tabletop roleplaying game set in the world of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird&#39;s original comics, in which players create a unique mutant animal and set about exploring a world of robots, ninjas, dinosaurs, and time travelers. The new Redux Edition includes new art, clarified and extended rules, all previous supplemental adventure books, and a section celebrating the original game and the wider franchise.




Fans have shown up in incredible numbers for this project, showing the love that still exists for the TMNT 39 years after their debut. With miniature sets packed with the franchise&#39;s heroes, villains, and allies, and extras including custom character dice, art prints, and unique editions of the two 256-page books that make up the finished product, Palladium Books may have started small, but always had ambitions to build on the initial funding. The publisher also recently revealed many of the names who will be involved in the retrospective side of the project, including current TMNT writer Sophie Campbell, Ramon K. Perez, Freddie E. Williams II, and franchise co-creator Kevin Eastman, who has promised to include new materials from his personal collection.

As of writing, fans have just 11 hours left to back Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness on Kickstarter, where some elements like dice, miniatures, and variant cover editions are exclusive to backers. With $1,000,000 already dedicated to the project, the TMNT RPG is coming soon, with fans still working to get the biggest bang for their buck.
