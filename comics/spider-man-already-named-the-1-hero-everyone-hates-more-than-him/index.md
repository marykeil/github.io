# Spider-Man Already Named the 1 Hero Everyone Hates More Than Him


## SUMMARY 



  Daredevil&#39;s impulsive nature and lack of consideration for consequences make him an unpopular teammate, even among superheroes like Spider-Man.   Spider-Man and Daredevil&#39;s different approaches to a hostage situation reveal their contrasting personalities, with Daredevil being reckless and Spider-Man being cautious.   Despite their differences, Spider-Man reaches out to Daredevil because he needs his help as a lawyer, highlighting Daredevil&#39;s unique skills outside of his heroics.

## Literature Review

Spider-Man is a hero who often has difficulties with team-ups, from his infamous bad luck to his constant commentary, but there&#39;s one hero even worse.




Marvel heroes can be reluctant to team up with Spider-Man, but Daredevil may be even less popular than the web-slinger. Spider-Man is infamous for his horrible luck, as well as the fact that he never stops talking. But despite these character flaws, even Spidey can admit that people dislike working with Daredevil even more. While there&#39;s no arguing that Matt Murdock is a great hero, he&#39;s also a bit of a mess as a person.




Spider-Man and Daredevil team up to solve a mystery in 2012&#39;s Amazing Spider-Man #677 by Mark Waid, Emma Rios, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Caramagna. A scientist has been kidnapped, and his hologram projection technology has been stolen. When Spider-Man and Daredevil track down the kidnappers, they put a gun to the hostage&#39;s head.



          

Naturally, Spider-Man decides to back off and try to reassess the situation to make sure no innocents are hurt. Daredevil, on the other hand, asks why Spider-Man is worried, and why they don&#39;t just continue on. Peter&#39;s inner thoughts reveal that this attitude is exactly why no one likes to team up with Daredevil: because he always jumps in head first without thinking of the consequences.

                  Daredevil&#39;s &#34;New Catchphrase&#34; Proves His Big Difference to Spider-Man   Despite the fact that they&#39;re both acrobatic, neighborhood vigilantes, the public response to Daredevil and Spider-Man could not be more different.   





 Spider-Man Admits No One Likes Daredevil 


          

Thankfully, the entire hostage situation is revealed to be a hologram. This partially explains Daredevil&#39;s strategy, as he genuinely can&#39;t see the hologram and therefore doesn&#39;t know what Spider-Man is talking about. Still, the fact that Spider-Man legitimately thinks that Daredevil is willing to jump into a hostage situation with fists flying says a lot about what Spider-Man thinks of Daredevil&#39;s character. At this point in the character&#39;s history, Daredevil&#39;s identity has been publicly revealed, which is seen as very sloppy on Daredevil&#39;s part by some in the hero community. The only reason Spider-Man reaches out to Daredevil at all is mostly because he needs his help as a lawyer more than as a superhero.



 Daredevil Tends To Punch First And Ask Questions Later 


          




Matt has a history of being unpredictable and spiraling out of control. He became a literal demon and threatened the entire world during the events of Shadowland. He also often jumps into situations without thinking things through first, something he himself has admitted, and it&#39;s nearly gotten him killed a few times. All of these traits make him a pretty unreliable teammate, which is why he rarely works with others if he can help it. Spider-Man and Daredevil make a great team, but that&#39;s only because they&#39;ve been friends for a while and know how to work around one another. Even with that advantage, Spider-Man still admits that he can understand why no one else wants to work with Matt if they can help it.

It&#39;s no secret that Matt Murdock is a bit of an adrenaline junkie. He absolutely loves the thrill of being a superhero, and this can often lead him to do impulsive things that put others in danger. He&#39;s absolutely a hero, and he does everything he can to protect civilians. But when it comes to himself or other superheroes, Daredevil tends to leap before he looks, which is why Spider-Man says no one likes him.
