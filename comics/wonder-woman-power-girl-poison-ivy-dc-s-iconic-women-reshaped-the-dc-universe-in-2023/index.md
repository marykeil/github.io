## Literature Review

Between a slew of new titles and major status quo changes, 2023 was a banner year for DC&#39;s iconic women, including Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, and more.




The heroes of DC Comics experienced some major upheavals in 2023, and the publisher&#39;s iconic women — such as Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, Power Girl, Hawkgirl, and more — were often at the center of events. As DC revamped its storytelling through the Dawn of DC initiative, a slew of new and ongoing titles starring women reveal a heartening commitment to centering women in heroic (and not-so-heroic) roles throughout the DC Universe.




The women of DC Comics had a banner year in 2023, especially as the Dawn of DC initiative reached its final phase in the back half of the year. Some characters are leading their own series for the first time, such as Fire &amp; Ice: Welcome to Smallville and the historic Poison Ivy, or returning to their own solo titles after many years, like Power Girl. The beloved Birds of Prey team book relaunched this past fall, already proving to be a critical success. Perhaps most significantly, Wonder Woman relaunched with a new #1, making Diana and the Amazons one of the major cornerstones of the ongoing DC story. The following list includes DC&#39;s 2023 Dawn of DC titles that place female characters in leading or co-leading roles.

 Wonder Woman, the Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn, and More Reshaped the DC Universe in 2023 
         

Even in team and solo books with men in leading roles, DC&#39;s women are making a huge impact across the DCU. With the Titans leading the world&#39;s heroes in the Justice League&#39;s absence, characters like Starfire, Donna Troy, and Raven are getting major &#34;air time,&#34; especially during the major Beast World event. Meanwhile, The Flash and Jay Garrick: The Flash have placed major emphasis on their young female characters this past year, with Irey West and Judy Garrick becoming powerful speedsters (with big personalities). Even two major male-led Dawn of DC books, Green Arrow and Superman, have centered women in their stories, with Lois Lane finally becoming editor-in-chief of the Daily Planet and Black Canary taking the lead in the search for Green Arrow — all while Amanda Waller schemes from the shadows.




Significantly, a number of these titles also feature women in major creative roles, and in a still-male-dominated industry, it&#39;s heartening to see so many women writing, drawing, coloring, lettering, and even editing comic books starring female characters. With real women working behind the scenes as the female characters of the DC Universe take up an increasing amount of space — both in-universe and on comic shop shelves — DC Comics made clear strides in 2023 to prioritize non-male characters and creators in its year-long initiative. DC&#39;s women have been unapologetically complicated characters since Lois Lane&#39;s debut 85 years ago, and 2023 showcased their range, from the heroic to the villainous and every shade in between.



 What&#39;s Next for the Women of DC Comics? 
         

As DC moves beyond the Dawn of DC branding and into the next phase of its story, many of these titles will continue to play major roles in the DCU in 2024. Wonder Woman&#39;s story in particular is only beginning to take shape, and fans can follow Diana and her Amazon sisters in Wonder Woman and Amazons Attacks. Irey West is showing signs of becoming DC&#39;s most powerful speedster in Si Spurrier and Mike Deodato Jr.&#39;s The Flash, and Amanda Waller promises to be part of 2024&#39;s &#34;Trinity of Evil,&#34; especially as she ropes DC&#39;s precog hero, Dreamer, into her plans in March&#39;s Suicide Squad: Dream Team. The women of DC Comics made waves across the publisher&#39;s 2023 line-up — hopefully the trend will continue into 2024.




All discussed titles, including Wonder Woman, Power Girl, Poison Ivy, Hawkgirl, and more, are available now from DC Comics.
