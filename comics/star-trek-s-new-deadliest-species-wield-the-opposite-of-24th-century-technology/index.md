Warning: contains spoilers for Star Trek #14!




The Tzenkethi are one of the biggest threats in the Star Trek universe, and they wield the opposite of 24th-century technology. In recent issues of IDW’s flagship Star Trek title, Captain Sisko and the crew of the Theseus have been dispatched to the Tzenkethi homeworld to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation. The storyline has been loaded with mind-blowing revelations about the Tzenkethi, and in issue 14, readers learn this species is surprisingly low-tech.

Star Trek #14, part two of “Glass and Bone,” is written by Jackson Lanzing and Collin Kelly and drawn by Marcus To. Harry Kim, who has been working undercover in Tzenkethi space, tells Captain Sisko, Tom Paris and Ensign Sato that the Tzenkethi are shockingly low-tech. They eschew many 24th-century technological innovations such as replicators and AI. Kim says of their technology: “unless they can see it, touch it, break it–the Tzenkethi don’t trust it.”

          




He goes on to explain the mindset further, saying everything for the Tzenkethi is “hard math, instinct, pattern recognition and augury.”


 The Tzenkethi Are Star Trek&#39;s Great Unknown 
          

The Tzenkethi are one of the greatest mysteries of the Star Trek universe, only mentioned on screen a handful of times. Non-canon works, such as games and novels, have fleshed the Tzenkethi out further, painting a picture of a species so different and so alien to anything the Federation has encountered before. In a previous issue, Tzenkethi ships were described as “enormous” and made of glass, stone and bone–unconventional materials for a starship. Furthermore, the Tzenkethi are technically “pre-warp,” their ships essentially being giant reactors that “hurl” the ships at light-speed. Finally, the Tzenkethi themselves, resembling giant dinosaurs, are unique among the galaxy’s other races.






The Tzenkethi were first mentioned in the Deep Space Nine episode &#34;The Adversary.&#34;




All of this leads to one serious question: how were the Tzenkethi, a decidedly low-tech species, able to make fools of the Federation every time they met? Nothing about Tzenkethi “technology” is superior to the Federation, the Klingons or the Romulans. The Tzenkethi do not have conventional warp drive and do not cloak their ships, all of which would seem to put them at a huge disadvantage. Yet, as seen in the current storyline, the Federation and Starfleet are terrified over what a resurgent Tzenkethi could mean for the galaxy, sending one of their most decorated officers to defuse the situation.



 The Tzenkethi Are a Real Threat to the Galaxy 
          




Currently, the Tzenkethi represent a grave threat to the Alpha Quadrant. As Sisko and company tour the Tzenkethi shipyards, it becomes clear their new ships are going to be even bigger and more powerful than ever. Harry Kim notes that there are design elements new to the Tzenkethi. Whether they are getting help from the Romulans (who appear in this issue) or somewhere else is immaterial, as these massive ships in the hands of the Tzenkethi are terrifying. Kim notes the ship is made from the same materials as other Tzenkethi ships, showing that while they are open to outside influences, they retain their trademark low-tech approach, an anamoly in the Star Trek franchise.
