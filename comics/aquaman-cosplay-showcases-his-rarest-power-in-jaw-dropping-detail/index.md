## Literature Review

This Aquaman cosplay dives deep into the seas of creativity, surfacing with a splash-tacular showcase of his rarest and most envied power.




An Aquaman cosplay emerges from the depths of the sea, unleashing the King of Atlantis&#39; rarest power with oceanic precision and a splash of stunning detail. This Aquaman-lookalike skillfully captures the essence of Arthur Curry, offering a faithful recreation of the beloved character while also sparking more ideas for future cosplays.




Cosplayer Khal of Atlantis, in collaboration with digital artist Ryan Sims on Instagram, unveils a simply stunning Aquaman cosplay that transcends the ordinary. The synergy of Khal&#39;s portrayal of the King of Atlantis and Sims&#39; digital artistry results in a cinematic showcase of Aquaman&#39;s hydrokinetic powers, synonymous with water manipulation.


 

Sims masterfully brings this rare ability to life by digitally editing in water, seamlessly placing it under the captivating control of Khal&#39;s Aquaman. The visual spectacle is enhanced as the water seemingly wraps itself around Khal, poised and ready to respond to his command, capturing the sheer majesty of Aquaman&#39;s dominion over the oceans.


 Cosplayer Shows Off Arthur Curry’s Water Manipulation Powers 

 




The display of Aquaman&#39;s hydrokinetic powers stands as a rare and captivating spectacle, particularly since Arthur, unlike his wife and queen, Mera, can only manipulate water through the use of his mystic Trident of Neptune. Beyond Mera, Tempest, and a select few others, this unique power is infrequently witnessed within the DC Universe, making this display even more of a treat to witness in the realm of cosplay. Sims&#39; contribution is pivotal, as without him, this portrayal of the sea-based king&#39;s water manipulation would not have been achievable. This collaboration underscores the profound depth that digital editing introduces to cosplays.

The collaboration between Khal and Sims sent fans into a frenzy, with an outpouring of likes and comments expressing sheer delight. Among the notable remarks were ones such as &#34;The king is here&#34; and &#34;Fantastic Aquaman dude. So good.&#34; A particularly impressed observer lauded the pristine appearance of the digitally manipulated water, stating, &#34;That water looks clean tho.&#34; This cosplay is a testament to the magic that can happen when combining outstanding digital editing with a high-quality suit worn by a cosplayer who also bears a striking resemblance to Jason Momoa. The combination of these elements has crafted an Aquaman portrayal that is unparalleled and resonates deeply with fans.

 Forget Batman vs. Superman! Where’s Aquaman vs. Superman? 
          

It would be well within Khal and Sims&#39; creative abilities to bring to life another rare ability of Aquaman – his capacity to pierce Superman’s skin with his trident. In Justice League Vol. 2 #6, by Geoff Johns and Jim Lee, the Trident of Neptune pierces Darkseid through the chest. Given that Darkseid and Superman share similar levels of invulnerability, and since the trident is made of magic – one of Kal-El’s vulnerabilities – it is logical that it could also pierce Superman’s skin. Hence, with Khal’s unparalleled Aquaman portrayal and Sims&#39; editing prowess, it would be amazing to see these two legends create a cosplay that depicts Aquaman piercing Superman through the heart with his trident.
