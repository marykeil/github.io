## Literature Review

The Namek Saga is an iconic arc in Dragon Ball lore, and in a new fan-made poster, Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma set off on their epic journey planetside!




The Namek Saga is an iconic story arc in Dragon Ball’s manga and anime continuity that placed Goku and pals on the path to battling and eventually prevailing over the cruel and powerful space tyrant known as Frieza. And in a new piece of art that blurs the line between fanart and official art, Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma get a teaser poster for their epic journey to come, starting with their search for the Namekian Dragon Balls!




Shared on X by username @DBSKAKERU1, this creative talent’s feed is chock-full of professional-looking Dragon Ball fanart that’s practically indistinguishable from the art drawn by series creator Akira Toriyama and Dragon Ball Super’s Toyotarou.


 

Having more recently uploaded fan illustrations of a King of the Saiyans Trunks, a Cell Games-era Super Saiyan 2 Gohan, and even an inspired piece that brings Chi-Chi back to her martial arts roots, @DBSKAKERU1 doesn’t seem to miss when it comes to dreaming up and then drawing these kinds of images, with this Namek-set piece continuing @DBSKAKERU1’s creative streak as an artist.

                  Trunks Becomes King of the Saiyans in Art That Redefines Epic   Trunks won&#39;t be able to capitalize on the royal blood flowing through his veins, but a new piece of fanart just turned him into King of the Saiyans!   





 The Namek Saga Kicks Off In New Dragon Ball Fanart 
          

The third major storyline in Dragon Ball Z lore, the Namek Saga covers the events set immediately after Vegeta and Goku’s final battle on Earth, with Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma subsequently traveling across the stars in search for the Namekian Dragon Balls that could theoretically revive all those they had just recently lost. Covering the trio’s trip to Namek, the beginning of Frieza’s push to find the Dragon Balls himself, Vegeta’s recovery and battle with Zarbon, and finally, the arrival of the Ginyu Force, the Namek Saga is one of the most influential arcs in the series, as it sets the stage for Super Saiyan Goku and his triumph over a final form Frieza.

Immediately showing off their talent for creating images that rival even the most official Dragon Ball art around, @DBSKAKERU1 draws Gohan, Krillin, and Bulma already mid-journey as they scout around Namek with a sense of wonder and purpose. Illustrating Gohan holding a Dragon Radar in his hands and Krillin carrying Bulma on his back, @DBSKAKERU1 nails the excitement these characters felt when initially landing planetside, well before they realize the inescapable danger they’ve just put themselves in. Leaving enough headspace above the trio where fans can imagine a Dragon Ball logo placed almost as if this were a teaser poster for the upcoming story, and @DBSKAKERU1 nails the look and feel of these characters and arc in a way that truly impresses.






 Dragon Ball Fan Poster Highlights The Beginning of The Namek Saga 
          

Furthermore, and in the same negative space at the top of the poster, eagle-eyed fans can spot an incoming Saiyan Space Pod, most likely signaling the arrival of a severely injured Vegeta after his battle with Goku or, in a possible tease for the following saga, one of the multiple ships the Ginyu Force uses. Regardless, @DBSKAKERU1 shows here that they continue to have the skills and talent to create Dragon Ball artwork that deserves some recognition, so here’s hoping fans get more posters featuring the further exploits of Goku and the rest of the Z-Warriors pre-Namek Saga and beyond.
