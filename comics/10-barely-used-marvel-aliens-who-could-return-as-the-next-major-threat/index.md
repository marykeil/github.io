## Literature Review

The Skrulls and the Kree and are not the only big bad alien races in the Marvel Universe, and here are 10 more that could be a threat.




The Marvel Universe is home to many alien species, and on several occasions they have fought the heroes of Earth. Races such as the Skrulls, the Kree, the Brood and the Chitauri have waged campaigns of terror in the universe, and against each other. Stories centered around these conflicts have formed the basis of some of Marvel’s most popular stories, such as the legendary “Kree-Skrull War” arc running through Avengers #89-97.
However, there are plenty of other alien races throughout the Marvel Universe that, while maybe not in the same league as the Kree or the Skrulls, still pose a significant threat to Earth. Here are ten Marvel alien races that could become the next big threat.









 








 10  The Rigellians 
First Appearance: Thor #129


 







The Rigellians are a minor alien race in the Marvel Universe, but they have the potential to be one of its biggest threats. A race of colonizers, the Rigellians, first announced themselves to Earth by attempting to annex it. Tana Nile, the Rigellian envoy to Earth, ran afoul of Thor when she attempted to initiate a colonization. Since then, the Rigellians have been a nuisance to the rest of the cosmos. The Rigellians are not viewed in the same category as the Brood or the Chitauri, and indeed they are a galactic laughingstock. However, there is great potential for the Rigellians to become true players on the galactic scene, but it will take some work.





 9  The Cotati 
First Appearance: Avengers #133


 







Although regarded as largely peaceful, the plant-like Cotati could become a huge threat to the Marvel Universe. The Cotati hail from the same star system as the Kree, and have suffered genocide at their hands. However, the Cotati bounced back, and have been a presence on the galactic scene since. The Empyre crossover event gave fans a glimpse of the Cotati’s true power, and the event ended with the Cotati being teleported to a distant and secluded planet. While not a threat for the time being, the Cotati could return at any moment and wreak havoc on Earth’s ecosystem with their plant-controlling powers.

 8  The Kronans 
First Appearance: Journey Into Mystery #83


 







The Kronans, also known as “the Stone Men from Saturn,” are a war-like race, and could become a major threat in the Marvel Universe. Best known as the first foes faced by Thor in modern times, the Kronans have also tangled with other Marvel heroes as well. Perhaps the most notable Kronan is Korg, a long-time ally of the Hulk, who made the leap to the MCU in Thor: Ragnarok. The Kronans have a reputation for brutality. This, when combined with their formidable physical forms and highly advanced technology, make the Kronans potentially one of Marvel’s most dangerous alien races.





 7  The Snarks 
First Appearance: Power Pack #1


 







A race of reptilian conquerors, the brutal and sadistic Snarks could easily become a major threat to the Marvel Universe. While the Snarks have not made as many appearances as other species on this list, their few outings have shown their tendency towards violence. The Snarks first came to Earth seeking the secrets of an antimatter weapon, and the planet has been in their crosshairs ever since. Every Snark invasion has been turned back by Power Pack, and should the Snarks ever develop a way to counter the team’s abilities, they could be a grave threat to Earth.





 6  The Space Phantoms 
First Appearance: Avengers #2


 







The first Space Phantom to come to Earth was dispatched by the Avengers, but later revelations have shown his species to be very powerful, and their ability to mimic any hero makes them a dire threat. A Space Phantom is born when a person stays in the Phantom’s home dimension (usually called “Limbo”) for too long. They are reborn with the ability to perfectly copy any creature, in the process shunting the victim off to the Space Phantoms’ dimension. The Space Phantom’s most memorable appearance showed his potential as a villain, and a whole species of him is bad news indeed.





 5  The Xem 
First Appearance: Journey Into Mystery #62


 







So far, fans have only met one member of the Xem: the horrifying Xemnu. Created shortly before the birth of the modern Marvel Universe, Xemnu is a large creature with white fur and the ability to control people’s minds. He has made life miserable for She-Hulk and other Marvel heroes, and he took a disturbing turn in Immortal Hulk. His appearance in that book showed what Xemnu, and by extension his people, are capable of–and the result was terrifying. With their ability to dominate the minds of lesser beings, the Xem are one of the biggest threats in the Marvel Universe.





 4  The Dire Wraiths 
First Appearance: Rom #1


 







An offshoot of the Skrulls, the shape-shifting Dire Wraiths have one huge advantage over their evolutionary cousins: their command of dark magic. This potent combination kept Rom the Space Knight on his toes throughout his book’s early 1980s run, and the Dire Wraiths have gone on to terrorize the Marvel Universe as a whole. The Dire Wraiths were created to give the one-note Rom toy a villain, and the end result enriched the Marvel Universe in unexpected ways. With Rom on his way back to Marvel soon, it stands to reason the Dire Wraiths may not be that far off either.





 3  The Badoon 
First Appearance: Silver Surfer #2


 







The Badoon are one of the greatest threats to Earth and the Marvel Universe, yet they rarely are credited as such. They are a species divided strictly along gender lines: the males are dominant and war-like, while the women are pacifists. The Badoon are a race of slavers, regularly kidnapping aliens to force them into servitude. Earth’s heroes have come into contact with the Badoon many times. In the past, the Badoon have allied themselves with Thanos, aiding his schemes of conquest, and these occasions have shown the galaxy what the reptilian aliens are capable of.





 2  The Spartax 
First Appearance: Guardians of the Galaxy #1


 







One of the newer alien races introduced in the Marvel Universe, the Spartax could easily be one of its biggest threats. Peter Quill, the Star-Lord, is half Spartax by his father J’Son. Contact between Earth and Spartax has been limited: J’Son crash landed on the planet while fighting the Badoon, meeting Star-Lord’s mother and getting her pregnant. Star-Lord was instrumental in overthrowing J’Son and placing Spartax under more benevolent leadership. The Spartax have shown little interest in Earth so far, but should they ever turn their attention to it, the heroes will be in for the fight of their lives.





 1  The Korbinites 
First Appearance: Thor #337


 







Longtime Thor ally Beta Ray Bill hails from the Korbinites. The Korbinites were once a race of explorers, traveling the galaxy and colonizing worlds. However, due to a galactic environmental disaster created by Surtur, the Korbinites were nearly destroyed. Those left behind were scattered across the galaxy, and while they are viewed as a mostly peaceful species, the Korbinites are possessed of great technology and strength. Should the Korbinites ever embrace the ways of violence, then Earth, and the rest of the Marvel Universe, will suffer greatly.
Currently, the Kree and the Skrulls are allies, which has greatly shifted the balance of power in the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe. With the former adversaries now at peace, the time is ripe for a new species to rise up and threaten the cosmos–and these ten alien races are prime contenders.
