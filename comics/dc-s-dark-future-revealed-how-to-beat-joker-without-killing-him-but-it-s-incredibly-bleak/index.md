# DC s Dark Future Revealed How to Beat Joker Without Killing Him (But It s Incredibly Bleak)


## SUMMARY 



  Killing the Joker isn&#39;t the only solution to stopping him; the Justice Lords in an alternate universe solve the problem by lobotomizing him.   Superheroes struggle with dealing with unrepentant criminals like the Joker; while killing them may seem like an option, it can lead to slippery slopes and former heroes turning to villainy.   The Joker remains a major problem in the DCU, and while lobotomizing him may be effective, true heroes like Batman would unlikely go that far to stop him.

## Literature Review

One of the biggest problems with the Joker is the inability to contain or stop him, but one dark future shows a permanent and non-lethal solution.




The Joker can not be reasoned with, and he can not be contained, but one dark future shows that killing the Joker isn&#39;t the only solution to stopping him. In a world where the Justice League goes rogue, they solve their recurring criminal problems by simply lobotomizing them.




The Joker is dealt with — permanently — in Justice League Beyond 2.0 #18 by Christos Gage, Dexter Soy, Veronica Gandini, and Saida Temofonte. The Justice Lords come from an alternate universe where they finally had enough of Lex Luthor and killed him after he got away with murdering the Flash. This eventually spirals out of control with the Justice Lords going after any villain that would threaten Earth.

          

This includes them fighting and killing both Brainiac and Darkseid, but they didn&#39;t want to employ lethal force on every villain. It&#39;s revealed that several villains — such as Cheetah, Poison Ivy, and even the Joker — have all been lobotomized.

                  Batman Beyond&#39;s Kryptonite Armor is Still One of DC&#39;s Coolest   In Batman Beyond 2.0, DC introduced an incredible Kryptonite-powered armor for Terry McGinnis to take on an extremist alternate Superman.   





 The Joker Can be Stopped with One Method: a Lobotomy 
          

Superheroes struggle to deal with unrepentant criminals. Villains like the Joker and Lex Luthor continually get away with their crimes and are very rarely, if ever, remorseful for the harm they&#39;ve caused. While the heroes can continually track them down and capture them over and over, the question becomes if they are really doing anything, considering they keep escaping prison. While some people want heroes to simply kill their villains, that&#39;s proven to be a very slippery slope, with several former heroes falling into villainy themselves once they&#39;ve gone down that path. Historically, Batman trying to kill the Joker never ends well. But there might be another solution.

There have been times when the Joker has been blessed with sanity, in which case he immediately expresses regret for his actions. This shows that he isn&#39;t entirely a lost cause, and while performing invasive brain surgery on the Joker is a bit of a leap, it&#39;s far better than killing him. It&#39;s not likely either Batman or Superman would ever consider doing this, but there&#39;s no denying that the Justice Lords did manage to take care of their villain problem in a way that was far more effective than most — and they did it non-lethally, too.






 The Joker Will Continue to Be a Problem in the DCU 
          

The Joker is a major problem in the DCU, and in several alternate universes he grows to be such a threat that he eventually ends the entire world. With someone that dangerous continually running free in Gotham, it&#39;s not unreasonable for Batman or Superman to start looking for other solutions to deal with the Clown Prince of Crime. While lobotomizing him certainly seems to be a valid option, it&#39;s unlikely that true heroes like Batman would ever go that far to deal with a monster like the Joker.



Justice League Beyond 2.0 #18 is available now from DC Comics!
