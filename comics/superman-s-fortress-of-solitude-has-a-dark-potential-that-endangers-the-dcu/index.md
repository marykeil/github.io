# Superman s Fortress of Solitude Has a Dark Potential that Endangers the DCU


## SUMMARY 



  General Zod&#39;s new ultimate weapon, made of Sunstone, sets him up for a critical role in the future of the DC Universe, as a major antagonist once more.   Zod&#39;s knowledge of Kryptonian technology, particularly Sunstone, makes him extremely dangerous to Superman and other Kryptonians, as well as the rest of the galaxy.   The versatility of Sunstone leaves the purpose of Zod&#39;s ultimate weapon unclear, but it could be used to remove the powers of Superman or even destroy planets.

## Literature Review

One of the most famous places in DC is the Fortress of Solitude, but the same material that built Superman&#39;s fortress could endanger the world.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Kneel Before Zod #1!General Zod recently came to rule his own planet, and as he often does, he&#39;s begun using it to raise an army. What&#39;s more, he&#39;s started building an ultimate weapon, one made out of the same material as Superman&#39;s iconic Fortress of Solitude. While it&#39;s unclear precisely what Zod&#39;s plans are, it&#39;s not unwise to assume that the Kryptonian might have his eyes set on galactic domination.




Kneel Before Zod #1 – by Joe Casey, Dan McDaid, David Baron, and Troy Peteri – reveals General Zod&#39;s plan for an ultimate weapon, setting the long-time DC antagonist up for a critical role in the near future. The issue features a young Lor-Zod coming across his father&#39;s secret Sunstone mining operation. Zod admits that he&#39;s doing it to create an ultimate weapon, to help him stand up against the United Planets.



          

What this weapon is exactly isn&#39;t yet clear, but looking over the history of Sunstone and what people have done with it, there are some pretty terrifying possibilities. While Sunstone is most famous for making up Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude, it has many other uses too.

                  DC&#39;s Ultimate Fortress of Solitude Fits Superman Better than the Original   Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude is pretty iconic, but in terms of functionality, the one in the Flashpoint Universe is actually much better.   





 Zod Admits He&#39;s Building A Weapon 


          

Most people assume that Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude is built out of ice; while that may have been true originally, now it is mostly accepted to be built out of Sunstone. Sunstone is a mineral found on Krypton, one that has numerous properties. The majority of Kryptonian architecture was built out of Sunstone. Additionally, Sunstone was the material that comprised Kryptonian warships. Considering General Zod was the head of the Military Guild, and a decorated war hero, he would be intimately familiar with the many uses of Sunstone. While Superman has fought and defeated Sunstone warships before, there&#39;s one aspect of Sunstone that would leave Superman or any other Kryptonian in Zod&#39;s way completely powerless.

General Zod lived on Krypton, learning all about his people&#39;s history and military practices, something Clark Kent never got to experience. This makes Zod especially dangerous when it comes to Kryptonian technology, and Sunstone is one of the most dangerous substances Kryptonians have ever had. Not only can Sunstone warp to construct highly advanced structures like the Fortress of Solitude, or a warship, but Sunstone can remove Superman&#39;s powers as well. With proper treatment, Sunstone can be changed into a form of synthetic Gold Kryptonite, which removes a Kryptonian&#39;s powers on contact. While regular Gold Kryptonite removes the powers permanently, the synthetic version only does it temporarily.






 Sunstone Is Extremely Dangerous To Kryptonians 
          

It&#39;s not yet clear what this &#34;ultimate weapon&#34; Zod is building is, or what his precise goals are. With the versatility of Sunstone, it could be almost anything, from a giant planet-destroying warship to a batch of synthetic Gold Kryptonite, intended to remove the powers of Superman or any other Kryptonian who gets in his way. Whatever the case is, General Zod has no intention of simply living a peaceful life on the planet he was gifted. It appears inevitable he will once more find himself in conflict with both the United Planets and Superman, but Superman might just be unprepared for how far General Zod is willing to go.
