## Literature Review

The worldwide LGBTQ&#43; sensation Heartstopper has just broken a major record, as the franchise secures its place in pop culture history.




The critically-acclaimed LGBTQ&#43; romance comic Heartstopper has just set a major record in its native UK. Heartstopper has become one of the most recognizable pieces of modern LGBTQ&#43; media. The graphic novels by Alice Oseman have received critical and audience acclaim worldwide, and the official TV adaptation has become one of Netflix&#39;s most popular series with a third season on the way. Now, the franchise has hit another major milestone in the UK, where the story first began.




According to The Guardian, the fifth volume of Oseman&#39;s hit series just became the fastest-selling graphic novel in the UK ever. Selling &#34;60,012 copies in the first three days since its release on 7 December,&#34; Heartstopper Vol. 5 shot past Joe Sugg, Amrit Birdi and Matt Whyman&#39;s Username: Evie, which sold a total of &#34;nearly 14,000 copies in its first week on sale,&#34; to clinch the official title. This is a huge milestone for the franchise as it cements Heartstopper as one of the most recognized and beloved stories in comics today.



          

Heartstopper&#39;s coming-of-age story mixed with important themes such as &#34;friendship, coming out and mental health&#34; has helped Charlie Spring and Nick Nelson&#39;s love story become one of the best graphic novels for young adults.

The creator of the hit series, Alice Oseman, was quick to show appreciation to the comic&#39;s fans, saying:


I am completely blown away by the news. Heartstopper is a story I care so much about and for it to break records is something I could never even have imagined.


This groundbreaking UK record is a major achievement, especially seeing as the first volume officially debuted in 2019. The fact that Heartstopper became a record-breaking phenomenon in just four short years shows how passionate the fanbase are about Oseman&#39;s work and how invested they are in Nick and Charlie&#39;s story.

What&#39;s remarkable about Heartstopper&#39;s massive record in the UK is how it reflects the growing mainstream market for LGBTQ&#43; stories. Countless books and graphic novels centering on queer themes are consistently being challenged around the world, especially when created for young readers. In fact, many copies of various graphic novels such as Maia Kobabe&#39;s Gender Queer, Raina Telgemeir&#39;s Drama, and even Oseman&#39;s Heartstopper series have either been challenged or removed from middle and high school libraries in the US. This major milestone for the Heartstopper franchise proves that despite these attempts, stories like Charlie and Nick&#39;s are widely loved and have a huge, truly committed readership.

Alice Oseman has confirmed that there will be a sixth volume in the hit Heartstopper franchise. However, it will also be the last as the series reaches its planned conclusion. If the major success of volume five is of any indication, this final entry in the series could set an even bigger record and potentially become one of the fastest-selling graphic novels worldwide. Heartstopper will continue to live on in the hearts and minds of readers everywhere, and based on its major record set in its native UK, it won&#39;t be leaving the public conscious anytime soon.
