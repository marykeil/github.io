## Literature Review

Just in time for the anniversary of No Man&#39;s Land, DC finally acknowledges the short-lived career of the Batgirl between Barbara Gordon and Cass Cain.





Summary

  DC Comics finally acknowledges that Huntress was the Batgirl who followed Barbara Gordon.   Huntress&#39; time as Batgirl is largely forgotten, but this Titans story gives her the respect she deserves.   This recognition of Huntress as Batgirl could lead to her return as a prominent character in DC Comics.  







After 25 years, DC Comics finally acknowledges who the real third Batgirl is. In official DC continuity, despite the pre-Crisis existence of Betty Kane, Barbara Gordon is acknowledged as the first Batgirl, and most audiences recall Cassandra Cain being the one to take her cowl. That order isn&#39;t entirely accurate, however. Cass does become Batgirl shortly after Barbara steps down, but there is a forgotten Batgirl before her.

In Titans: Beast World Tour - Gotham #1&#39;s &#34;Claw &amp; Order&#34; by Sam Maggs, and PJ Holden, DC finally acknowledges that Helena Bertinelli, also known as Huntress, was the Batgirl to immediately follow Barbara Gordon. The story highlights a unique team-up of sorts between the former and current Batgirl during the Beast World event set off by a newly villainous Beast Boy.

          




When Huntress is transformed into a black panther, one of the Batgirls, Cassandra Cain, steps onto the scene. Immediately, the narration introduces Cass as the Batgirl who replaced Helena in the role. Considering that 2024 marks the 25th anniversary of the iconic Bat-Family story No Man&#39;s Land, Huntress getting her due couldn&#39;t have come at a better time.

                  Batman&#39;s Daughter Is the Key to Revitalizing a Dormant DC Franchise   The Suicide Squad is currently in mothballs while Amanda Waller pursues a sinister agenda, and Batman&#39;s daughter is perfect to reform the Squad.   


 DC Finally Remembers that Huntress Was Batgirl Before Cassandra Cain 


          

1999&#39;s No Man&#39;s Land was a year-long storyline in which, following an earthquake that ravages Gotham, the US government forces the citizens to evacuate Batman&#39;s city. Those who stay are unsafe because of the emerging gang warfare that ensues as villains claim their territories. Matters only get worse as Batman is missing from the action. Anointing herself as the city&#39;s new protector, Helena Bertinelli adorns the cowl herself to become Batgirl — the third after Betty Kane and Barbara Gordon — recognizing that criminals will always fear the Bat as a symbol far more than her Huntress persona. Her efforts prove successful, but Bruce never approved and demanded she give him the cowl — which later goes to Cassandra Cain, who makes her debut during the event.




Helena&#39;s run as Gotham&#39;s protector ends in tragedy wherein she&#39;s nearly killed after being shot by the Joker in a vicious moment that never results in any real payoff for the Huntress. She finally gains Batman&#39;s approval for everything she&#39;s done for the city, but at the cost of everything she&#39;s sacrificed physically and emotionally. Huntress&#39; time as Batgirl is largely forgotten now — until Cassandra Cain appears in this Titans story, which finally acknowledges this lost moment in DC&#39;s continuity. &#34;Cassandra Cain, better known as Batgirl,&#34; reads the narration, which continues: &#34;Once replaced Helena as Batgirl, but it&#39;s fine. They&#39;re cool now. Except at this current moment.&#34;



 Huntress&#39; Time as Batgirl Finally Gets Respect 


          

Helena is, by far, one of the most disrespected characters on DC&#39;s active roster. In-universe, she was the Bat-family&#39;s original black sheep, a status emphasized by how underappreciated her efforts to protect Gotham during No Man&#39;s Land were, despite how vital she was in building the city back to prominence. Meanwhile, in the larger tapestry of current DC stories, she&#39;s rarely used in major Gotham storylines, largely because of continuity confusion between herself and another Huntress who has just returned to the main DCU. This Beast World moment, though, is a step in the right direction for Huntress, as it not only pays respect to her time as Batgirl, but could hopefully springboard her back to the forefront of DC.
