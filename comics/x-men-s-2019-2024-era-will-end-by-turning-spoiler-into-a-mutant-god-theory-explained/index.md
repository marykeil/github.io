# X-Men s 2019-2024 Era Will End by Turning [SPOILER] into a Mutant God - Theory Explained


## SUMMARY 



  The long-teased end of X-Men&#39;s Krakoan era could come as a result of Professor X&#39;s shocking ascension to a god-like status, as a Dominion.   Charles Xavier has a lingering psychic trace of Mr. Sinister within him, which may be what leads him down the path to becoming the Dominion.   The ascension of Professor X as a Dominion could potentially help save mutantkind in their time of need, rather than dooming them,

## Literature Review

The Four Sinister Suits have raced for centuries towards claiming Dominion. However, it now seems the Sinister Dominion might be Charles Xavier.




Warning: SPOILERS ahead for Immortal X-Men #17!




As half a decade of X-Men storytelling comes together for one massive finish, it appears that Professor X&#39;s fate will not be a sacrificial death, nor a hard-won survival. The nature and impact of Dominions have remained a persistent thread in the overarching narrative of the Krakoan Age. Recent developments point to Charles Xavier being the one to ascend from space-time to this god-like status.

Immortal X-Men #17 – by Kieron Gillen, Juan José Ryp, David Curiel, VC&#39;s Clayton Cowles – contained the latest development in the Dominion plotline. Following the events of Sins of Sinister and Children of the Vault, Mother Righteous, Mister Sinister, Moira X, Destiny, and Serafina are the only ones aware of the Dominion manipulating events in their universe.

         




Now, a telepathic version of Sinister recruits Charles Xavier, reaffirming that this Dominion is a Sinister, and it must be stopped. However, it may turn out that their endeavor is what leads Professor X to becoming the Dominion himself.


 Mister Sinister Has Been Part of Professor X for Decades 


          





As established in Jonathan Hickman&#39;s Powers of X miniseries from 2019, a Dominion is the highest form of intelligence in the Marvel Universe.




Charles is still haunted by a lingering psychic Sinister, despite Krakoa&#39;s resurrection protocols being purged of Sinister&#39;s meddling. Due to the experiments carried out on Xavier as a child at the Black Womb Project, a backdoor has existed within Charles&#39; mind for Sinister to take over, following his death. It seems that the recent tinkering that led to the SOS timeline exacerbated this connection that Xavier has long put to bed. Professor X&#39;s conscious mind retained control over his body, even before he realized Sinister&#39;s mental ghost was following him around; the question of who is influencing who becomes very important as the two head to Muir Island as lab partners.




Two of this spectral Sinister&#39;s admissions are key to this theory. One, Sinister claims that the Dominion is a Sinister: &#34;it&#39;s one of the other Sinisters... it&#39;s me, only not.&#34; Later in Immortal X-Men #17, Nathaniel confesses to still trying to take over Charles, and that his drive to achieve Dominionhood may not be an active choice, but a compulsion. Taken together, Professor X has a glimmer of Sinister within him, one that recognizes the need to become a Dominion. Barring the success of the current front-runner, Mother Righteous, a clear pathway seems to have opened narratively for Charles Xavier to make this ascension.



 A Professor X Dominion Could Help Save Mutantkind 


          

While Fall of the House of X and Rise of the Powers of X are the core of Krakoa&#39;s closing chapter, the Dominion dénouement has been promised for X-Men: Forever. A Dominion is an intelligence so vast, it expands beyond humanity&#39;s comprehension of space-time, rising to a level of power indistinguishable from a god. It&#39;s not fully clear what it may mean for Charles Xavier to reach this status, but mutantkind is in need of all the Hail Marys they can spare at the moment. In an era where the X-Men have so clearly outgrown Professor X, perhaps it&#39;s time for some new growth of his own.




Immortal X-Men #17 is available now from Marvel Comics.
