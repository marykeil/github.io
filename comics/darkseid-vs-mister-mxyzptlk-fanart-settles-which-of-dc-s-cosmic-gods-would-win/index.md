# Darkseid vs Mister Mxyzptlk Fanart Settles Which of DC s Cosmic Gods Would Win


## SUMMARY 



  Kerry Callen&#39;s artwork hilariously portrays Mister Mxyzptlk defeating Darkseid by turning him into a giant baby.   Callen&#39;s interpretation is supported by canonical comic storylines, such as the Emperor Joker storyline, where Darkseid surrenders to Mxyzptlk&#39;s powers.   However, a notable exception in the canon shows Darkseid defeating Mister Mxyzptlk in DCeased: War of the Undead Gods, highlighting the weakness in Mxyzptlk&#39;s character.

## Literature Review

A hilarious fanart emerges to finally settle the age-old debate of who would emerge victorious in a battle between DC&#39;s Darkseid and Mister Mxyzptlk.




Kerry Callen has wielded his artistic talents to create a masterpiece that humorously settles the debate on who would emerge victorious in a battle between Mister Mxyzptlk and Darkseid. Despite the firm ground that comic canon provides to support this artist&#39;s stance on the potential winner, an intriguing twist lies in an exception within a notable DC narrative.




Renowned artist Kerry Callen, celebrated for his contributions to MAD and parody comics featuring DC and Marvel characters, has treated fans to a humorous interpretation of a clash between Darkseid and Mister Mxyzptlk. Taking to Instagram, Callen shared his creation, portraying the mischievous fifth-dimensional imp reveling in laughter as Darkseid is depicted donning a colossal baby outfit.


 

The visual suggests an amusing scenario where Darkseid and Mister Mxyzptlk engaged in a face-off, with Mister Mxyzptlk emerging triumphant by transforming Darkseid into a giant infant. Callen&#39;s comedic artwork adds a delightful touch to the perennial debate about what the outcome of a confrontation between these two iconic characters would be.


 Mister Mxyzptlk Defeats Darkseid by Turning Him Into a Giant Baby in Kerry Callen Art 
          




Kerry Callen&#39;s whimsical fanart featuring Mister Mxyzptlk and baby Darkseid originated from a commission request that humorously asked, &#34;Can you draw Mr. Myxlplyx making Darkseid wear a giant baby outfit?&#34; Gleefully accepting the challenge, Callen delivered a piece that garnered amusement and praise from fans. As fans marveled at the artwork, some couldn&#39;t help but comment good-naturedly on the specificity of the commission. The resulting portrayal of Darkseid, clad in a pink baby ensemble complete with booties, mittens, bonnet, bib, bikini, rattle, bottle, and a conspicuous diaper, humorously underscores Callen&#39;s belief that, in a clash between the two cosmic entities, the mischievous imp Mister Mxyzptlk would emerge triumphant.

While Callen&#39;s declaration of Mister Mxyzptlk as the winner in this hypothetical confrontation might seem like a fan headcanon, it finds support in canonical comic storylines. The Emperor Joker storyline by Joe Kelly, Jeph Loeb, Duncan Rouleau, and Todd Nauck explores a narrative where the Joker gains multi-dimensional powers from Mr. Mxyzptlk. When confronted by Darkseid, the omnipotent Joker threatens to turn him into a &#34;hood ornament,&#34; Darkseid wisely surrenders, acknowledging his inability to contend with the might of Mister Mxyzptlk&#39;s powers. This canonical reference adds weight to Callen&#39;s humorous depiction and supports the idea that Mister Mxyzptlk would indeed triumph in a clash against Darkseid.

 Mister Mxyzptlk’s 1 Major Flaw Guarantees He’d Lose in a Fight Against Darkseid 
         

However, a notable exception within the canon introduces a scenario where Darkseid emerges victorious against Mister Mxyzptlk. This dynamic unfolds in the pages of the critically acclaimed DCeased: War of the Undead Gods #5 by Tom Taylor, Neil Edwards, Trevor Hairsine, and Andy Lanning, where Mister M finds himself confronting a Darkseid infected with the anti-life equation. In this narrative, Mister Mxyzptlk is viewed as the other heroes&#39; ultimate hope, as the imp&#39;s immense power is such that a mere thought could have led to Darkseid&#39;s defeat, unraveling his very existence within the blink of an eye.




Yet, this isn&#39;t what happens. Mister Mxyzptlk&#39;s hubris and penchant for reveling in his own verbosity prove to be his Achilles&#39; heel. While Mister M was engaged in taunting Darkseid, the new god seized the opportunity to defeat the fifth-dimensional being by infecting him with the anti-life equation. This instance serves as a compelling reminder that, despite Mister Mxyzptlk&#39;s incredible powers, his character flaws can be exploited, leading to his ultimate defeat. Considering this twist in canon, one can&#39;t help but wonder if Kerry Callen might craft another artistic piece depicting a battle between Darkseid and Mister Mxyzptlk where the tyrannical ruler of Apokolips reigns supreme.
