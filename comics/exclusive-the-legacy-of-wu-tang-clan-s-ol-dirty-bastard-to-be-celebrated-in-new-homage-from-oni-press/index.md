## Literature Review

A first look at Oni Press &amp; Wu-Tang Clan&#39;s upcoming anthology graphic novel, ODB: Oddities, Discord and B-Sides - Lyrical Ruckus in the City. 




Screen Rant is excited to share a preview for Oni Press&#39; upcoming Wu-Tang graphic novel, ODB: Oddities, Discord and B-Sides - Lyrical Ruckus in the City. This original graphic novel will focus on Ol&#39; Dirty Bastard (ODB) and reimagine New York City through the eyes of the Wu-Tang Clan co-founder. This anthology will feature numerous creators and showcase the Grammy-award-winning artist&#39;s many identities.




Wu-Tang Clan was formed in 1992 and has since become one of hip-hop&#39;s most influential music groups. It has featured several members, including ODB, until his death in 2004. Now, the MC will take on new life within comics in Oni Press&#39; latest musically influenced publication. The comic can be backed via Kickstarter, with a trailer from Oni Press viewable now.


 

This graphic novel will add to Wu-Tang Clan&#39;s broader legacy, but will also offer fans the chance to purchase new merchandise inspired by ODB. This includes exclusive, limited-run action figures, 7&#34; vinyl, and more, in collaboration with Super 7. In addition to this partnership, another partnership with Four Screens has allowed this graphic novel to become a reality.

Check out the synopsis here:


In a fractured New York City, an elemental impact event has caused different versions of the city&#39;s most infamous neighborhoods from across the multiverse to converge together into a single reality. Spectral apparitions now haunt the streets of Queens. In the Lower East Side, a rogue artificial intelligence has seized the streets. A hundred blocks north, time travelers are throwing a block party in Harlem. And that&#39;s only the beginning... Our guide through this splintered mutation of New York&#39;s past, present, and future is none other than Ol&#39; Dirty Bastard himself. Follow him as he leads us through odd, urgent, and powerful tales that cast freedom and oppression, wealth and poverty, love and loss, and even life or death like so many dice in a cosmic game of chance.
