## Literature Review

Spider-Man is up against Deku&#39;s All for One in an astonishing piece of fanart that pits two friendly neighborhood superheroes against each other.




Spider-Man faces off against My Hero Academia&#39;s Izuku Midoriya and his One for All quirk in a stunning new piece of fanart. Superhero fans always love to imagine fights like this that pit good guys against each other, wondering who would win in a fight and who&#39;s stronger. But both these young heroes would more likely team up when they&#39;re done to take on the real villains.




Artist @Thirdphp dropped this piece on X of the two teenaged superheroes, locked in battle on a dark night. The image was in response to the prompt, &#34;Show me a drawing that you still don&#39;t understand how you cooked so hard.&#34; Thirdphp added that he never finished the sketch before inking, hence his surprise at how great the final turned out.


 

Deku and Spider-Man both have fists pulled back, with Peter&#39;s webs and Midoriya&#39;s power encircling the two. A hint as to what would make these two heroes fight lies in the suit the webslinger is wearing, suggesting he&#39;s got the Venom symbiote with him.


 Spider-Man vs. Deku Brings Together Two International Heroes 
         




While Venom has become more of an anti-hero when paired with Eddie Brock or Flash Thompson, whenever Peter Parker has the symbiote, he often can&#39;t control it or himself. Kind-hearted Deku would definitely go toe-to-toe with Spider-Man if he thought Peter was doing wrong. Midoriya was originally quirkless (i.e. unpowered), but had such a strong sense of justice that the hero All Might took him under his wing, eventually passing on his own quirk, One for All, to Deku. One for All is an incredibly powerful quirk that has been handed down through generations of heroes, who have trained and honed the power to be nigh unstoppable. While it might make it seem like this would give Deku the advantage, Spider-Man has held his own against powerful foes for his entire history.



 This Isn&#39;t the Artist&#39;s First Superhero Match-up 

 




Thirdphp has a penchant for setting up powerful characters against each other, and previously drew an R-rated throwdown between Invincible&#39;s Omni-Man and Homelander from The Boys. These two overpowered antiheroes are another pair where fans love to debate who would win if they came to blows. In that occasion, Thirdphp did pick a winner in a second panel, showing Omni-Man victoriously holding Homelander in pieces. Between Spider-Man and Deku, things likely wouldn&#39;t escalate to that degree, either because of Midoriya&#39;s good nature or Peter&#39;s snappy jokes. This artist is one to watch for spectacular comics fanart of everyone&#39;s favorite heavy hitters like Spider-Man and Izuku Midoriya.
