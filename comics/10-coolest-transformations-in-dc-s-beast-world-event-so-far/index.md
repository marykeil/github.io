Warning! Contains spoilers for DC&#39;s Beast World event!
DC Comics is closing out 2023 with its massive Beast Worldevent, which sees the publisher&#39;s heroes and villains taking on astonishing new animal forms. After Beast Boy loses himself to his Starro form and begins attacking the Earth, he rains down Beast spores onto the planet, transforming civilians, heroes, and even villains into beastly versions of themselves. There are plenty of transformations to go over as DC&#39;s next big event kicks off.
A major staple in comic books is the crossover event. They often happen several times a year, and it&#39;s no surprise that Beast World seems to be affecting almost every character in DC&#39;s lineup. As characters worldwide are infected and transformed into new beast forms, readers are getting to see tons of cool and unique designs. From Batman being transformed into a wolf to Black Adam as a lightning-powered black Lion, there are tons of cool designs to go around, and these are the top 10 coolest beast transformations that readers have seen so far.









 








 10  Killer Croc&#39;s New Lizard Form 
Killer Croc&#39;s Already Bestial Form is Taken to the Next Level


 







Killer Croc&#39;s major transformation is first seen in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham story &#34;The Good Boy&#34; by Chip Zdarsky, Miguel Mendonca, Mike Spicer, and Lucas Gattoni. This story finds Gotham under attack by Beast spores unleashed by Beast Boy&#39;s transformation into Garro. These spores infect people and turn them into horrible beast forms, and when this effect is applied to someone who is already fairly beastly, such as Killer Croc, he&#39;s pushed to the next level and becomes a true monster. This unleashed Killer Croc is far more Croc than man and very nearly takes down both Nightwing and a transformed Batman.





 9  Jimmy Olsen&#39;s Turtle Form 
The Iconic Turtle Man Returns

        


Jimmy Olsen has undergone an absurd number of transformations over the years, including becoming a wolf-man at one point, but Jimmy Olsen&#39;s most iconic transformation is that of Turtle Man. Jimmy Olsen once found a treasure chest on the beach and, upon opening it up, he discovered a device that could enlarge items. After the beam fired at a turtle, it reflected off the poor sea creature and hit Jimmy. The turtle acted as a filter for the beam, and Jimmy was enlarged to become the Turtle Man. Now infected by a Beast spore, this form appears again in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis story &#34;Turtle Boy&#34; by Dan Jurgens, Anthony Marques, Joe Prado, Wade Von Grawbadger, Pete Pantazis, and Dave Sharpe.





 8  Livewire Is A Lightning Lizard 
Livewire Gets a Sleek New Form


 







Livewire is a Superman villain who doesn&#39;t get much play but is always fun when she shows up. A former shock jock radio host, she was transformed into the villain Livewire after an accident gave her electricity-based superpowers. These powers weren&#39;t enough to keep the Beast spores away though, as she is infected and transforms into a lizard, as seen in Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis by Nicole Maines, Steve Orlando, Fico Ossio, Luis Guerrero, and Rob Leigh. Livewire proves to be especially dangerous, with her lightning speed serving to enhance her new bestial strength and rage. Thankfully, Dreamer is able to bring her down with her new powers.





 7  Power Girl Gets A Major Upgrade 
Power Girl Becomes a Literal Kryptonian Legend

        


No one is safe from the Beast spores, as even a character as powerful as Power Girl can still be infected. But unlike other characters who simply become bestial forms, Power Girls is tied deeply to her culture. Power Girl&#39;s surprising new form is first shown off in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis story &#34;Turtle Boy&#34; by Dan Jurgens, Anthony Marques, Joe Prado, Wade Von Grawbadger, Pete Pantazis, and Dave Sharpe. This transformation reveals Power Girl as a literal Flamebird. One of the major parts of Kryptonian culture was the legend of Nightwing and Flamebird, two Kryptonian heroes. Flamebird is an identity that several heroes in the DC Universe have used, but Power Girl is the first one to take on the form quite literally, which is fitting considering how significant it is to her home planet.





 6  Harley Quinn Transforms Into A Rabbit 
DC&#39;s Wackiest Anti-Hero Becomes a Wacky Wabbit

        


Harley Quinn is one of DC&#39;s more absurd heroes, and she undergoes a transformation that completely fits that. Harley Quinn takes on a new rabbit form as she hunts down a criminal, stalking him through the streets of Gotham. Making sure he&#39;s always alert to her presence from the thumping of her large foot, she practically drives the man insane as he seeks therapy to deal with it. Eventually, it&#39;s revealed that Harley is doing this on orders of Poison Ivy, who requires information that the criminal hads While Harley doesn&#39;t really do anything in the story, her ever-present stalking of the criminal is a sight to behold and can be seen in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham story &#34;Wild Harleys I Have Known&#34; by Grace Ellis, Daniel Hillyard, Rico Renzi, and Lucas Gattoni.





 5  Killer Moth Has ANOTHER Terrifying Transformation 
Killer Moth Has Had a Ton of Different Forms Over the Years

        


One of the bizarre trends when it comes to the character of Drury Walker is how often he seems to transform into a monster. One wouldn&#39;t expect the supervillain called &#34;Killer Moth,&#34; who was created to be an Anti-Batman, would have so many monstrous transformations, but he does. Readers can see Killer Moth&#39;s awesome transformation in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham story &#34;Wild Thing&#34; by Kyle Starks, Kelley Jones, Jose Vilarrubia, and Lucas Gattoni. In this story, Killer Mother transforms into a cockroach monster and battles against Stephanie Brown, who easily defeats him after he breaks into a food warehouse. This isn&#39;t the first monstrous form that Killer Moth has had, though; way back in Underworld Unleashed, he became the demonic creature Charaxes.





 4  Huntress Becomes A True Catwoman 
Helena Lets Out Her Wild Side
        

Huntress is one of the often overlooked Bat-Family members, but that might change after her recent transformation. Helena has always been a little more loose on the use of lethal force compared to the other members of the Bat-Family. While Batman is staunchly against it, due to Helena&#39;s upbringing, she believes some people deserve to die, and she&#39;s more than happy to help them along. She&#39;s never deserved her vigilante name &#34;Huntress&#34; more than when she transforms into a panther in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham story &#34;Claw and Order&#34; by Sam Maggs, PJ Holden, and Lucas Gattoni.. This form completely embodies her character as a solitary and dangerous hunter.





 3  Red Hood&#39;s Inner Beast Comes Out 
Jason Todd Wrestles with His Morality as a Wolf

        


It&#39;s not shown exactly how Jason Todd also ends up infected and transformed into a brown wolf, as seen in the Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham story &#34;Scavengers&#34; by Gretchen Felker-Martin, Ivan Shavrin, and Lucas Gattoni. Jason spends his time as a wolf hunting down food and criminals, killing both a raccoon and a thief that he catches. Jason questions whether he&#39;ll ever be anything more than a killer, or if the thoughts he&#39;s having even matter. It&#39;s one of the first times readers get to see the inner monologue of someone who&#39;s been infected, and it reveals a lot about Jason&#39;s character and how he sees himself. Red Hood&#39;s werewolf form seems to prove that, unfortunately, Jason will always be a killer.





 2  Batman Becomes A Literal Lone Wolf 
Batman Shows He&#39;s the Top Dog in Gotham


 







While it&#39;s not exactly accurate, Batman has often been called a lone wolf and Batman&#39;s new wolf form takes that label to a literal new level. Under the influence of the Beast Spore, Batman stalks the streets, completely focused on saving Gotham City and its citizens, more than ever before. Batman outright refers to Gotham as his &#34;master&#34; and continues fighting criminals even in this new beast form. While calling Batman a loner is a bit disingenuous due to the sheer size of the Bat-Family, there&#39;s no denying that this transformation absolutely makes the Dark Knight into a lone wolf, as seen in Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, Brad Anderson, and Wes Abbott.





 1  Black Adam Becomes The King of Animals 
Black Adam&#39;s Lion Form Rules the Animal Kingdom

        


One of the biggest reveals of Beast World is when Black Adam becomes the King of Beasts as he transforms into a Black Lion. There are few creatures on Earth cooler than a lion, let alone a giant lion in a cape that fires lightning. Black Adam&#39;s transformation is first seen in Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, Brad Anderson, and Wes Abbott. Black Adam&#39;s power is so great that he takes on both Raven and Starfire and manages to hold his own for a bit. Black Adam is already one of the most dangerous characters in DC Comics, and his transformation into the King of Beasts in the ongoing Beast World event is certainly going to help cement that title.
Titans: Beast World and its tie-ins are available now from DC Comics!
