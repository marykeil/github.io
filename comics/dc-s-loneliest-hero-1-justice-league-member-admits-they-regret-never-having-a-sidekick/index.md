## Literature Review

The Justice League&#39;s loneliest hero admits their regret of never having kids or a sidekick, revealing an extremely rare show of vulnerability.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Green Arrow #7!While Batman is frequently labeled as the DCU&#39;s lone wolf, the title of the Justice League&#39;s loneliest hero undoubtedly falls upon Green Lantern. In an unusual moment of vulnerability, Hal Jordan opens up to Green Arrow, confessing that he has always harbored a wish for a sidekick or child of his own.




In the captivating narrative of Green Arrow #7, by Joshua Williamson, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Trevor Hairsine, Oliver Queen makes a triumphant return to Earth-0 after his enigmatic sojourn through time and space. Eager to re-establish connections, one of Green Arrow&#39;s initial priorities is catching up with his fellow heroes and friends.

          

This quest leads him to a poignant encounter with his long-time friend, Hal Jordan, unveiling a rare and vulnerable confession from the typically steadfast Green Lantern. The exchange between the two heroes adds a layer of emotional depth to the storyline and reveals the startling revelation that one of Hal&#39;s biggest regrets is never having kids.


 Green Lantern Admits He Regrets Never Starting a Family 


          




During Ollie and Hal&#39;s reunion, their conversation shifts to the theme of family, prompting Hal to confess that when he first encountered Oliver, he never would have imagined the archer as a family man, even though Oliver now boasts a family so extensive that it rivals even Batman&#39;s. Hal further reflects on his past belief that he and Carol Ferris, Green Lantern&#39;s long-time love interest, would have been the ones to eventually have a child. In an attempt to lighten the somewhat somber conversation, Oliver interjects with a joking remark, &#34;You with a little Lantern?&#34; However, beneath the lightheartedness, it becomes evident that Hal does harbor a genuine desire for a child of his own.

Green Lantern is one of the only Justice Leaguers of the original seven who has yet to have a child featured in main continuity. In the rich history of the DCU, Batman, Superman, and Flash have established themselves as parents, with Batman notably known for his evergrowing hoard of children. Even in recent continuity, Wonder Woman and Aquaman have embraced parenthood with the addition of daughters to their narratives. Even though Martian Manhunter tragically lost his daughter, K&#39;hym, he remains a hero who experienced fatherhood and still has a nurturing connection with his niece, Miss Martian. This leaves Green Lantern as the lone childless hero among the original seven.

This subtle yet significant revelation could be a tantalizing hint at Hal Jordan stepping into the role of a parent or mentor in the near future, introducing a narrative shift that would redefine the character in unprecedented ways. Exploring the uncharted territory of parenthood for Hal would add layers of complexity to his persona, providing a fresh perspective on the fearless hero. Such a storyline would not only deepen Hal Jordan&#39;s character development but also introduce unexplored challenges and dynamics, creating a compelling and groundbreaking arc for Green Lantern.
