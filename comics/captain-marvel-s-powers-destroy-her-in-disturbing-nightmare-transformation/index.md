## Literature Review

Superstar artist Peach Momoko has released the most disturbing Nigthmare variant yet, starring Captain Marvel. 




Captain Marvel’s powers are slowly destroying her in a horrifying “Nightmare” variant cover by artist Peach Momoko. Momoko has released other covers in the “Nightmare” line, each depicting a Marvel icon caught in terrifying situations, and now it is Carol Danver’s turn. Momoko’s variant of Captain Marvel #3 is one of the best of the bunch, showing Carol going to her death–with a smile on her face.




Peach Momoko unveiled the Nightmare Variant cover for Captain Marvel #3 on her Instagram account. The cover shows Captain Marvel, complete in her new, more military-style uniform, sitting down. Inky, black tendrils are coming out of her body, but what exactly they are doing is never revealed.


 

Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of Momoko’s illustration is Captain Marvel’s reaction: she is smiling, blissfully unaware that her powers are destroying her.


 Peach Momoko Has Set the Marvel Universe on Fire 
          

Peach Momoko is one of the most exciting artists working in comics today. She is known for books such as the Demon Days series, which transport Marvel characters such as Elektra and Black Widow back to feudal Japan. Momoko has also made a name for herself with a series of striking covers, including the Nightmare variants. Previous Nightmare variants have depicted Venom as well as Captain Marvel’s ally Monica Rambeau. All of these covers feature the character caught in the throes of a nightmarish metamorphosis, and Captain Marvel #3 may be the most disturbing of them all.




The true limit of Captain Marvel’s powers has never been conclusively revealed, meaning she could be one of the publisher’s most powerful heroes. Her powers are energy based, and are dependent on how charged up she is. While Captain Marvel can largely control her powers, there have been some instances where it became too much for her. In Peach Momoko’s variant of Captain Marvel #3, these same powers are leaking out, taking a gross and disturbing form as they slowly kill her.

                  Captain Marvel Gets the Best Sidekick She Could Ask For (Even if She Makes Her Weaker)   Ever since they started teaming up together, Yuna Yang has simultaneously made Captain Marvel stronger (internally) and weaker (externally).   



 Captain Marvel&#39;s Journey is Coming to a Horrifying End 
          

It has been a long road for Captain Marvel. Carol Danvers has held many heroic aliases since gaining powers and becoming the first Ms. Marvel in the 1970s. Among the names she has taken include Binary and Warbird before finally becoming Captain Marvel. Carol has faced many obstacles along the way, including a bout with alcoholism. Through it all, she managed to persevere, overcoming her demons and becoming the hero she was always meant to be. Carol’s journey is an inspiring one, but in this cover, it is coming to an end in the most horrific fashion possible, as her powers threaten to consume her.
