## Literature Review

Tombstone, most notable now for his Boss Battles in the PlayStation Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man franchise, is bound to get his own comic redemption arc.




Warning: Spoilers for The Amazing Spider-Man #40!Spider-Man villain Tombstone is being set up to get a redemption arc in the comics to match the one he has in the PlayStation Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man video games. Best known for his side missions in the games, Tombstone is arrested for his activities as a crime boss, and in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man 2, he&#39;s legitimately reformed upon release. Now doing community service at a carnival, Tombstone has no ambitions for crime anymore.




Marvel seems to now be ready to give Tombstone an official redemption arc for the comics, beginning in The Amazing Spider-Man #40 by Zeb Wells, John Romita Jr., Scott Hanna, Marcio Menyz, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna. Lonnie &#34;Tombstone&#34; Lincoln debuted in the comics 35 years ago, and has slowly worked his way up the ranks of the local New York crime syndicate. He went from being a hitman and enforcer working for other people to being a notorious crime boss working for himself. Now, he&#39;s about to put his pride to the side for an unexpected team-up with Spider-Man.



          



This collaboration of convenience could easily evolve into Tombstone actually having a change of heart regarding his career in crime.

                  Spider-Man&#39;s New Nemesis Can Break Peter Even Worse Than Green Goblin   Tombstone has a mobsterâ€™s mindset and access to Peter&#39;s personal life, meaning that he can hurt Spider-Man worse than the Green Goblin ever did.   





 Tombstone Teams Up with Spider-Man 
          

Before the Gang War event that Marvel is in the midst of now, Tombstone was shot at his daughter&#39;s wedding. With Lincoln out of action and the apparent death of Hammerhead, it became open season for New York&#39;s gangs hunting for new territory. Chaos begins to erupt across the city, and when Tombstone learns his would-be son-in-law has been shot, he decides to check out of the hospital early. Desperate to end the ensuing war once and for all before someone else close to him - specifically his daughter, Janice aka the Beetle - gets hurt, he opts to work with Spider-Man and She-Hulk at the end of the last issue.

In this issue, Tombstone helps Spidey and She-Hulk get the drop on the local gang, the Inner Demons. From there, they start planning their next move and which moves need to be made to put a stop to this Gang War. Since Tombstone knows the world of crime better than Spidey, he helps the hero navigate around him and even uses his connections to get Wilson Fisk (aka the White King, fka Kingpin) and the Hellfire Club on their side, giving the heroes exactly the firepower they are going to need.

At the end of the last issue, Spidey points out that this isn&#39;t the first time that he and Tombstone have reluctantly joined forces, but it most certainly is the most significant compared to last time. The stakes are higher for Tombstone; for him, the fate of New York isn&#39;t just on the line, but the fate of his daughter and her romantic interest are at stake. He&#39;s fighting alongside his longtime enemy squarely to protect them. If Tombstone&#39;s can be that committed to the people he loves, especially after a life of crime nearly killed him, his commitment and newfound humbleness could get him to finally turn his back on crime by the time this collab with Spider-Man is over.
