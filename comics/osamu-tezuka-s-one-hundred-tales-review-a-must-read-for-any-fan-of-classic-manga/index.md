One Hundred Tales is the story of a cowardly accountant who is given a new chance at life when he makes a deal with the devil&#39;s daughter. Inspired by Faust by Goethe, this fable reinterprets the events of the original story into a humorous and lively tale inspired by Japanese culture and history. It has been translated into English by Iyasu Adair Nagata with lettering by Aidan Clarke. Being an older work, it has an older framework of existence, as noted by a preface note from the publisher, Ablaze, and Tezuka Productions. This should be kept in mind by audiences when reading the work. This is also true of some of its references, which could be lost on younger viewers, but which are fun nods to pop culture of the past some fans will still be able to recognize.





One Hundred Tales is a story about being careful what you wish for.
Ichirui Hanri is an ordinary accountant servicing his master. Though innocent, he is ordered to commit hara-kiri after being entangled in some trouble in his master&#39;s house. Just then, a witch named Sudama appears. She signs a contract with Hanri to obtain his soul in exchange for fulfilling three of his wishes. Hanri gets what he wants...but the price he pays is too high.


One Hundred Tales features a cowardly man who wishes his way into a better life, though he is still forced to earn improvements in his life. He faces several dangers along the way. Tezuka&#39;s art style is easily recognizable and long-term fans will be excited to see his usual humorous style at work here. There are random cameos of assorted characters and nods to famous people, like actor Christopher Lee. Sharp-eyed readers may even be able to find the self-insert of Tezuka himself. Though it is inspired by Faust, it quickly becomes a charmingly bittersweet and humorous samurai adventure.
