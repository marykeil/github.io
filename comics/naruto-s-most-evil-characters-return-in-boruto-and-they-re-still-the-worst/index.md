Despite being close to Danzo, one of Naruto&#39;s worst villains, two Konoha ninjas who&#39;ve contributed to countless deaths have returned in Boruto.





Summary

  Konoha elders Homura and Koharu are still alive and hold high-ranking roles, despite their past involvement in tragedies.   They are trusted advisors to the acting Hokage, even though their decisions caused the loss of many lives in Konoha.   The elders&#39; snap judgments and disregard for residents&#39; lives show they prioritize reputation and budget over their village.  







The Naruto franchise is filled with dastardly villains responsible for many innocent deaths, but two of Konoha&#39;s most harmful characters have returned in Boruto: Two Blue Vortex to make matters even worse. Many of the Naruto series&#39; biggest tragedies have had their perpetrators dealt with. Still, the Konoha elders who helped spur Itachi&#39;s slaughter of the Uchiha and Pain&#39;s ascension are shockingly still alive in the latest Boruto chapter.

Boruto: Two Blue Vortex occurs around 18 years after the Fourth Shinobi War ended. However, chapter #6 reveals that Konoha elders Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane are not only still alive but, even more surprisingly, still hold high-ranking roles in the village. Once the subordinates of the vile Danzo Shimura, the two notoriously contributed to Konoha&#39;s ruin on more than one occasion.

          




With Naruto being held captive by Kawaki, Shikamaru continues acting as Konoha&#39;s interim Hokage. Boruto: TBV Chapter #6 begins with him confronting members of the Konoha Council. Homura and Koharu have held their roles as Hokage&#39;s councilors before Naruto was born. What&#39;s most shocking isn&#39;t that the 70&#43;-year-old shinobi are still kicking, but the fact that they are still trusted in their roles despite their decisions directly leading to the loss of so many Konoha lives.


 The Konoha Council Should Have Lost Their Jobs Years Ago 
          

Danzo was undoubtedly one of the worst villains in the Naruto franchise, but he had helpers. Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane served with the Second Hokage and have since served as advisors for Konoha&#39;s acting Hokage. While the Third Hokage made several questionable decisions during his two tenures, most cold-hearted tactics seemed to spawn from Danzo&#39;s paranoid and jealous mind. Unfortunately, Homura and Koharu often leaned more toward Danzo&#39;s harsh methods than Saratobi&#39;s, and their short-sightedness has seemingly not improved over the years.




The slaughter of the Uchiha and Akatsuki&#39;s ascension can be directly linked to Danzo&#39;s actions, which both Homura and Koharu supported. Despite Hiruzen&#39;s desire for peace with the Uchiha, the other Konoha Council members persuaded Itachi to murder the clan, except for Sasuke. Plus, in a move to destabilize the Rain Village, Danzo tricked Hanzo the Salamander into killing members of the once peaceful Akatsuki group, which directly led to Konoha&#39;s destruction by Pain. The Elders even disagreed with Naruto&#39;s intervention with Pain&#39;s assault on Konoha. This decision would have ended Konoha and its shinobi if Naruto had done what they wanted.

          

Despite consistently claiming to have Konoha&#39;s best interests at heart, the two Elders were often quick to make snap judgments to imprison their own residents or even murder before fully understanding the events at play. Chapter #6 of Boruto: TBV saw Homura openly calling for Boruto&#39;s execution, despite Shikamru&#39;s statement regarding Code&#39;s retreat after Boruto&#39;s intervention. &#34;No matter the circumstances, Boruto at the very least must be eliminated,&#34; a statement from Homura that proves that the village&#39;s councilors still care more for Konoha&#39;s perceived reputation and their Daimyo&#39;s fiscal budgets than their village&#39;s residents.




                  Sasuke&#39;s Final Boruto Fight Isn&#39;t Just Disrespectful, It&#39;s An Insult To Fans   Sasuke&#39;s final stand in the Boruto manga failed to give the character the send-off he deserved or make the villain that took him down intimidating.   



 Tsunade And Kakashi Should Replace The Elder Konoha Council Members 
          

The Elder&#39;s train of thought is still heavily affected by Eida&#39;s spell, which has most of the populations memories of Boruto and Kawaki switched. Still, after having so many of their decisions backfiring on a colossal scale, it&#39;s surprising that Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane still have their jobs. Their inclusion in the Boruto manga proves that the Elders still have a role to play in the franchise&#39;s story, even if that role is to have their decisions lead to more chaos.
