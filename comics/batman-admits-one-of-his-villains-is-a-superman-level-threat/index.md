# Batman Admits One of His Villains is a Superman-Level Threat


## SUMMARY 



  Batman confirms that the Riddler could be a serious challenge for Superman, as his manipulation in a recent event threw off the villain&#39;s game.   While Batman&#39;s villains may not be as powerful as Superman&#39;s, the Riddler&#39;s intelligence and ability to create mind games and traps make him a formidable opponent.   Riddler&#39;s goal of proving his intelligence could lead him to take on Superman in a battle of wits, and Superman should be prepared in case the Prince of Puzzlers ever comes knocking.

## Literature Review

After a team-up between two unexpected villains, Batman reveals which member of his roguesâ€™ gallery would be a worthy opponent of Superman.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Batman/Superman World&#39;s Finest #19!One of Batman&#39;s most famous enemies could wind up being a serious threat to Superman. The Dark Knight confirms that one particular rogue has what it takes to be the ultimate challenger to the Man of Steel.




In Batman/Superman World&#39;s Finest #19 by Mark Waid and Travis Moore, Superman does battle with Jax-Ur, a Kryptonian criminal who has escaped from the Phantom Zone. Jax-Ur escaped after noticing a pattern of breaches in the Phantom Zone that took him to Earth. The villain reveals he forced the Riddler into a plan to lure Superman so that the hero could wind up trapped in the ethereal prison like Jax-Ur had been.

          

Batman and Superman team up to defeat Jax-Ur and confront him at Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude. The duo manages to trick Jax-Ur back into the pattern, once again securing him in the Phantom Zone. The heroes also catch the Riddler and leave him restrained for the authorities. With the event behind them, Superman discusses the case with Batman. Batman warns his friend that Jax-Ur&#39;s manipulation threw the Riddler off his game and that at his full capacity, the villain could be a real challenge to someone like Superman.





 Batman Confirms Riddler Would Be a Challenge for Superman 
          

Batman and Superman are very different heroes and as such, have very different villains. Clark often fights powerful threats; beings as mighty as Doomsday, Brainiac, and General Zod. Batman, on the other hand, fights more grounded foes; villains who might not be as strong, but are just as capable of bringing chaos and panic to Gotham. Of course, Batman has plenty of villains in his rouges&#39; gallery that are more powerful than average baddies, like Clayface or Bane. But generally, Batman&#39;s nemeses aren&#39;t nearly as powerful as Superman&#39;s.

And while the Riddler is all brains and no brawn, Batman is right on the money. Edward Nygma is one of the most insidious criminal masterminds in the DC Universe. He can create sinister mind games and deadly traps that have even challenged the World&#39;s Greatest Detective. Not to mention, the Riddler has gone toe-to-toe with far more powerful heroes than Batman before, like the Flash, and nearly beaten them. Superman could easily take down Nygma in a direct fight. But given enough time to bring his A-game, Riddler could come up with a real puzzler for the Last Son of Krypton.






 Riddler is Smart Enough to Face Off Against DC&#39;s Biggest Powerhouse 
          

Riddler is a simple man and has one goal in life: To prove how much smarter he is than everyone else. That&#39;s why he spends much of his time trying to outwit the greatest detective in the DC Universe. But Superman is a clever hero as well (maybe not to the extent that Batman is, but certainly clever enough). It&#39;s not unreasonable to think that Riddler could see the fun in taking on Superman in a battle of wits, nor is it unlikely that the villain would really up his game to challenge the Kryptonian. If Batman thinks that the Riddler could take on Superman, then the Man of Tomorrow should prepare himself in case the Prince of Puzzlers ever comes knocking. Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #19 is on sale now.
