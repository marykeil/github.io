## Literature Review

Shonen Jump’s Jiangshi X introduced a new technique that borrows ideas from both JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure and Dragon Ball Z.




Warning: SPOILERS for chapter #30 of Jiangshi XJiangshi X, the Chinese battle fantasy series that started its serialization in Shonen Jump Plus in 2023, has introduced a fighting technique that combines the best of JoJo&#39;s stands with the fusion mechanics of Dragon Ball Z. Following the time skip in chapter #23, the three young daoshi have matured into capable warriors. With that comes numerous new techniques, as was demonstrated by Jiuli in chapter #30.




By besting mighty spirits known as Shen Ling in battle, daoshi warriors receive a huge boost to their Dan Li - the energy they consume to support themselves and fuel their techniques in combat. After doing so, these Shen Ling will appear above the user when unleashing their Dan Li - but recent chapters have revealed that they can serve another purpose.

          

By building off another technique to allow their Shen Ling to briefly enter the mortal realm, daoshi are then able to merge with these spiritual beings in a process startlingly similar to fusion in the Dragon Ball franchise.

                  10 Shonen Jump Manga You Need To Be Reading in 2024   It can be difficult to decide which manga from Shonen Jump&#39;s large catalog are worth investing time into, but these are the ten best to read in 2024.   





 Jiangshi X&#39;s Spirit Bond Technique is like Fusing with a JoJo&#39;s Stand 
          

While a daoshi&#39;s Shen Ling is incorporeal in most cases, the Xian Huan: Manifest Spirit technique grants them a physical body for a short time, where they can then be manipulated much like a stand from JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure. Jiuli, the most studious of the three warriors from Shenxian Village, demonstrates this ability to great effect when he summons his Shen Ling, then quickly manifests it to block an incoming attack. However, merely taking control of a Shen Ling appears to be the tip of the iceberg, as chapter #30 demonstrates with the introduction of a technique that allows a daoshi to fuse with it.

Jiuli, while facing an immensely powerful sixth-order jiangshi, uses the Dai Ling: Spirit Bond technique to fuse himself with his stand-like spirit, skyrocketing his fighting prowess and allowing him to take it down with a single swing of his sword. Like the fusion dance in Dragon Ball Z, the Spirit Bond technique grants immense power but only lasts a short time, though its exact restrictions have yet to be revealed. The true power of Jiuli&#39;s Gongsun Sheng form remains to be seen, but its ease of dispatching a sixth-order jiangshi shows how far the trio has come, compared to their brutal encounter with a second-order jiangshi during their Naruto-like team test.






 There Could be More Fusion Possibilities in Jiangshi X&#39;s Future 
          

The true power and capabilities of the Shen Ling remain a mystery, but the existence of fusion techniques could suggest crazier possibilities, such as fusion with multiple Shen Ling, or between two daoshi using Spirit Bond. With three years of training thanks to the time skip, there are bound to be more exciting techniques and transformations coming to this new take on Wuxia action and dark fantasy, in their crucial fight against the Wu Dou Jiu Dao. The stage is set for Jiangshi X to further develop its fighting system during its second year of publication in Shonen Jump as it moves into 2024.

Jiangshi X is available from VIZ Media and MANGA Plus.
