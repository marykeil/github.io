## Literature Review

Forget about reflecting a repulsor blast with a vibranium shield - Emma Frost is able to refract Iron Man&#39;s beams throughout her entire body.




Warning: Spoilers for The Invincible Iron Man (2022) #13 ahead!Iron Man and Captain America&#39;s iconic tag-team move of bouncing a repulsor blast off Cap&#39;s shield has just been upstaged by none other than Emma Frost. When the time comes for Emma and Tony to fight side-by-side, Emma&#39;s diamond body elevates this classic move to deadly new heights.




In Gerry Dugan and Juan Frigeri&#39;s The Invincible Iron Man (2023) #13, Iron Man, Emma Frost, and Eros launch into space to retrieve the rest of Krakoa&#39;s mysterium supply from Gameworld. Unfortunately, they arrive at the same time that a gang of pirates makes their own play for the precious metal and are soon caught in a firefight.



          

To quickly dispatch the pirates, Emma transforms into her diamond form while Iron Man shoots her with a repulsor blast. Refracting the beam through her body, Emma redirects the repulsors to multiple targets simultaneously and ends the fight in seconds.

                  Wolverine&#39;s Daughter Just Made His Most Iconic Attack Even Cooler   The Fastball Special is one of Wolverine&#39;s most iconic attacks, and now his daughter has made it even cooler.   





 Emma Frost&#39;s New Attack Is Ripped Directly From The Avengers 
          

This team attack has been an MCU staple ever since Captain America bounced Iron Man&#39;s repulsor beam off his shield to cut through a horde of Chitauri in 2012&#39;s The Avengers. Since then, it has earned its memetic status through various references and call-outs, even being mocked by Deadpool in a 2018 advertisement for Marvel Strike Force (in which Deadpool attempts to bounce a grenade off a friendly medic with disastrous results). The move has proved to be so popular that, upon protests over its omission from the 2020 video game Marvel&#39;s Avengers on launch, it was subsequently patched in that very same year.

Emma Frost&#39;s version of this attack gives it a major upgrade. While Captain America&#39;s shield can reflect or diffuse a beam in a wide arc, Emma has shown that she can not only refract Iron Man&#39;s blasts throughout her entire body (subsequently multiplying them), but can also control the beams with pinpoint precision through her fingertips. This glorious light show effectively turns her into a targeted &#34;disco ball&#34; of destruction.






 The Synergy Between Iron Man And Emma Frost Keeps Growing Stronger 
          

While the much-hyped marriage between Iron Man and Emma Frost turned out to be largely one of convenience, moments like these throughout the series suggest a growing bond between them. The &#34;blast refraction&#34; team attack symbolically demonstrates the trust Iron Man and Captain America have for one another; for him to reach the same level of trust with Emma Frost is a significant milestone. Not only has Emma Frost recreated one of Marvel&#39;s most classic moments, but her growing bond with Iron Man has allowed her to refine the technique to levels Captain America could never hope to reach.
