## Literature Review

The cover for Invincible Iron Man #16, from artist Kael Ngu, reveals Tony&#39;s much anticipated new mysterium armor, designed by artist Pepe Larraz.




At long last, after months of teases, Tony Stark&#39;s newest Iron Man suit has been unveiled on the cover for Invincible Iron Man #16, revealing the Mark 72, an armor made from the anti-magic, hyper-powerful mutant metal known as mysterium. Iron Man - or perhaps Mysterium Man - has been collecting mysterium with the help of his wife Emma Frost, and will finally don his epic new suit in a coming issue of his war against Orchis.




Tony Stark has been at rock bottom for weeks now, pretending to have been fully defeated by his newest archenemy Feilong, but with the partnership of heroes like Frost, Ironheart, Forge, and Starfox, Iron Man now has the chance to enact revenge on his vile foe.

          

Invincible Iron Man #16, from writer Gerry Duggan and artists Juan Frigeri and Bryan Valenza, will debut Tony&#39;s impressive new mysterium suit at long last, which was designed by artist Pepe Larraz and brought to life in the cover for the issue by the talented Kael Ngu.


 Tony Stark&#39;s Mysterium Armor Is Finally Ready To Take On Feilong 
          




Iron Man and Emma Frost are in a bitter war against Orchis, specifically Feilong and his vast army of Stark Sentinels. Stark knows that to defeat the Stark Sentinels, which use the most advanced Iron Man technology to date, he needs an even more powerful suit, which is where mysterium comes in. Mysterium is a cosmically derived metal - mined by members of S.W.O.R.D. from the Phoenix&#39;s White Hot Room - that has incredibly powerful anti-magic powers, is wildly tough, and is known to be radiation-proof. In fact, Tony&#39;s Mark 72 armor being radiation-proof is the most important facet of his new mysterium armor.

Since his archenemy Feilong has vast radioactive abilities, Iron Man can now safely face Feilong without fear of being killed by radiation. Plus, mysterium is known for being so durable that even Captain Marvel, one of the single strongest beings in the Marvel Universe, was unable to bend it. Kael Ngu&#39;s epic cover for Invincible Iron Man #16, showing off Tony&#39;s new mysterium armor designed by Pepe Larraz, finally reveals what his new suit will look like. Featuring a heavy amount of the black mysterium metal and sporting a very unique-looking helmet and gauntlets, Iron Man&#39;s Mark 72 is just different enough from past Iron Man armor to make it feel truly special and important.






 Iron Man And Emma Frost Will Take The Battle Directly To Feilong 
          

All of Stark&#39;s efforts since the disastrous Hellfire Gala have been leading up to the creation of his mysterium armor so that he can defeat Feilong and gain his empire back, while also helping Frost take down Orchis once and for all. Since Iron Man&#39;s fall from grace, and Emma Frost&#39;s forced exile due to her mutant identity, both heroes have been operating from the shadows, frustrated with their inability to fight their enemies directly. From Tony pretending to be a defeated former billionaire to Emma Frost changing her entire identity, the two heroes are more than ready for a showdown.

Now, the time has come to take the battle to Feilong&#39;s doorstep, and while the upcoming Fall of the House of X proves Orchis won&#39;t be so easily defeated, it seems likely that Feilong&#39;s reign of terror will finally be stopped. Tony Stark&#39;s new Iron Man Mark 72 suit - crafted from the vastly powerful mutant mysterium metal - is just what the hero needs to take down his foe Feilong, and finally take back his power as the Mysterium Man.




Invincible Iron Man #16 from Marvel Comics debuts on March 20th, 2024.
