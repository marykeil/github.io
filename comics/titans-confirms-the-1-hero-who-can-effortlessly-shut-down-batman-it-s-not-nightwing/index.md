## Literature Review

Batman clashes with plenty of personalities, but one of the Titans proved they have both the backbone and skill it takes to change his mind. 




Warning: Contains spoilers for Titans: Beast World #1!!




Batman&#39;s stern, no-nonsense personality frequently puts him at odds with other heroes, but one member of the Titans squad doesn&#39;t hesitate to put him in his place when he starts speaking down to Beast Boy. As the Titans and Justice League gear up to face the Necrostar, Raven quickly puts herself between the Dark Knight and Gar, turning his blunt approach around on him.

In Titans: Beast World #1 – by Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, and Brad Anderson – Earth has only a few precious moments to respond to a devastating threat of the Necrostar, and prevent from destroying the planet. Batman, ever the strategist, is quick to choose a path, but he&#39;s less keen to give Beast Boy the floor.

          

Instead of hearing Gar&#39;s idea outright, he begins to talk over him. The move swiftly provokes Raven to cut the Caped Crusader off instead, reminding Batman that he&#39;s not speaking to &#34;one of [his] Robins.&#34; It&#39;s a bold move and turns out to be enough to give Beast Boy the floor. 





 Raven Isn&#39;t Intimidated By Batman 
The Titans Are The Justice League&#39;s Equals Now


          

Batman has many commendable qualities, but he&#39;s not always receptive to new ideas unless they&#39;re his own. In Beast World, he leaps on Gar&#39;s hesitation to explain his plan, using that against the younger hero. Bruce relentlessly believes in what he does, rarely wavering from it, so it&#39;s no great surprise that he&#39;d be so quick to find a flaw with Beast Boy&#39;s alternative plan. It&#39;s how he tends to approach everyone in his life – something Raven realizes, too. Raven&#39;s incredible empathic abilities grant her insight into even the most private individuals. By pointing out that Bruce is addressing Gar like a subordinate, she hits upon an old conflict.

At some point, every Robin has struggled against the tight leash Batman keeps on them. Moreover, by calling out the &#34;negativity&#34; at Batman&#39;s core, Raven forces him to pit that against the fate of the whole world. It puts him in a position with a clear answer, and he ultimately backs down rather than interrupt again. Raven is able to perfectly, succinctly call out what it could cost them all, while simultaneously vouching for Gar&#39;s plan, putting her faith in him. It&#39;s the perfect way to cut through Bruce&#39;s hesitation, put Earth&#39;s plight into perspective, and express her own understanding of both Beast Boy and Batman.






 Batman Is Intense, But He&#39;s Not A Bully 
Bruce Respects Those Who Stand For Something
          

Though not exactly the most accepting of other ideas or solutions, Batman does respect those who ultimately stand for good – even when they achieve it through means he wouldn&#39;t use. It&#39;s why he continues to hold Nightwing in such high esteem. When someone is willing to stand up for what they believe in, Bruce is more likely to pay attention. The moment in Beast World gives Raven the chance to put this in perspective. After all, they&#39;re all there to save the world, and their time is limited. Sometimes, even Batman needs a harsh reminder that the Titans and other heroes are more than capable heroes, his peers rather than subordinates.
