## Literature Review

Wolverine&#39;s origins have always been shaded by trauma and retcons, but it seems the Predator is more responsible for his suffering than fans knew.




Warning: SPOILERS for Predator vs. Wolverine #3




Wolverine has one of the most harrowing personal histories of any Marvel Comics character – and his ongoing conflict with the Predator has added further dimensions to the character&#39;s backstory, as well as firmly integrating the Yautja into the Marvel Universe, with the latest issue containing a major fusion of Predator and X-Men lore.

Predator vs. Wolverine #3 – by Bejamin Percy, Ken Lashley, Hayden Sherman, Kei Zama, and more – retells Logans’ Weapon X era, tying it to one of his earlier encounters with the Yautja. Seeking Logan’s adamantium skeleton as a trophy, the Predator steals him from the confines of the Weapon X laboratory.

          

Ultimately, the alien warrior’s mission fails, leaving Wolverine once more in the hands of Weapon X – along with his would-be captor’s helmet. The issue confirms the Predator helmet served as the template for the iconic Weapon X visor worn by the traumatized Wolverine – as first depicted 32 years ago.




                  10 Marvel Villains the Predator Would Absolutely Hunt   Given the Predator&#39;s recent conflict with Wolverine, anyone in Marvel Comics could be next, including super-villains. Here are the 10 best choices!    


 Weapon X’s Iconic Visor Was Yautja-Inspired 
          

First appearing in Marvel Comics Presents #79 by Barry Windsor-Smith and Jim Novak, Logan’s fan-favorite visor was an instantly iconic visual signifier of Wolverine&#39;s time spent in the Weapon X program as nothing more than a living weapon. Used to both train and control Wolverine, this visor was always treated as cutting edge tech, but its otherworldly origin, as revealed in Predator vs. Wolverine #3, adds yet another layer to Logan’s already complex backstory, further tying him to one of cinema history’s most iconic alien warriors. Beyond that, it reinforces the undeniably predatory nature of the Weapon X program, highlighting their nature as scavengers of power they cannot hope to match.




The minds behind the Weapon X Program are some of the most devious in all of Marvel Comics lore. Aside from Wolverine, they tortured and mutilated countless individuals, turning them into little more than blunt instruments to be used and discarded at will. Professor Thornton specifically was particularly cruel and calculating, so his use of the Predator’s helmet to advance his own macabre research is a natural retcon for one of Wolverine’s most twisted tormentors. In that sense, it’s no surprisethat he essentially stole the tech behind one of Logan’s most iconic looks, appropriating it from yet another unwilling source.



 Weapon X Stole Technology As Well As Lives 
          

Wolverine has had plenty of iconic costumes throughout the years, but few designs carry as much trauma and baggage as his iconic Weapon X visor. The revelation that the technology originated from the Yautja is another dynamic, exciting contribution to Wolverine&#39;s history from Predator vs. Wolverine. The series has, so far, done an exceptional job of placing the Yautja within the Marvel Universe, giving rise to the likelihood of more stories bringing them into deadly confrontations with classic Marvel characters. For now, with Logan and the Predator soon to face off once more, Wolverine must find a way to contend with this brutal new foe.
