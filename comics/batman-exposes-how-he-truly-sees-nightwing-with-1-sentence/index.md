## Literature Review

As the events of “Beast World” change Batman into something truly terrifying, the Dark Knight admits how he really feels about his partner Nightwing.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #2!In just one sentence, Batman has revealed how he truly sees his longtime partner Nightwing. The DC Universe is going wild as animal hybrids start popping up all over the place. Even the Dark Knight can&#39;t avoid this danger and a shared moment with Dick Grayson reveals how Bruce Wayne sees his ally.




In Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, the world is quickly going to hell as Beast Boy&#39;s spores are rapidly turning the world&#39;s population into animal creatures. While his Titans allies respond globally, Nightwing assists Batman with the situation in Gotham.

          

After saving a few innocent bystanders, Batman directly fights an infected civilian, only for their spore to transfer to Bruce. It isn&#39;t long before Batman slowly begins to transform into a werewolf-like creature. Nightwing promises that he&#39;ll find a way to save Bruce and the rest of the infected. All Batman can say before his transformation completes is &#34;Don&#39;t let me hurt anyone&#34;.


 Batman Trusts Nightwing to Keep Him in Check 
          




As part of a plan to exterminate Earth, a Tamaranean disguised as Brother Blood unleashed a monster known as a Necrostar on the DC Universe. The only thing able to defeat it is Starro, but in the alien&#39;s absence, Beast Boy volunteered to push his powers to the extreme and become a similar creature. Garfield was successful, but the sinister Amanda Waller took advantage of the situation and sent her newest, most powerful asset to mind-wipe Beast Boy. Now Gar is stuck as a rampaging monster and he&#39;s releasing spores that are turning the people of Earth into animal hybrids.

Generally, being a part of the Bat-Family means that one has a level of trust that Batman doesn&#39;t easily give. He&#39;d trust all of his allies with his life if he had to. However, Batman isn&#39;t facing death here, but rather, losing control of himself and giving into the ferocious instincts of an animal. Bruce knew that he only had moments to spare before he completely lost his mind, so in his last act of free will, he called upon the only person he values more than anyone else: Nightwing. Batman knows that out of all of his most trusted allies, Nightwing has what it takes to take Batman down if necessary.






 Nightwing is Batman&#39;s Best Contingency 


          

Batman knows that if he loses control of himself, he could pose a serious danger to the world around him. Out of all the people Bruce has worked with, he knows that Nightwing has the skills to defeat him and the spirit to do so. As frightening as it is watching the Dark Knight turn into a monster, he managed to pay his first Robin one of the highest compliments he could bestow. When things go seriously wrong, Bruce needs someone to stop him and prevent him from hurting others. For Batman, no person in the DC Universe is better suited to do that than Nightwing.

Titans: Beast World #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
