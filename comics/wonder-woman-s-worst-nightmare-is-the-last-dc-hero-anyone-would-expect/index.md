## Literature Review

Wonder Woman and the Amazons have enough on their plate to worry about, now they’re about to face off with Peacemaker and his deadly new weaponry.




A surprising villain is about to make the lives of Wonder Woman and her Amazon sisters very complicated. Thanks to the event of one rogue Amazon, the warrior race is banned from American soil. But as a cache of Amazons fight to clear their names they wind up in the crosshairs of the trigger-happy Peacemaker!




The new year is nearly here and solicitations are showing the kind of trouble heading towards the DC Universe&#39;s heroes. A preview for Amazons Attack #5 by Josie Campbell and Vasco Georgiev reveals that Queen Nubia and her Amazon sisters are being targeted by Amanda Waller&#39;s hyper-violent go-to guy, Peacemaker. The standard cover by Clayton Henry shows Christopher Smith using his scope to line up a shot to take out several amazons and their ally Mary Marvel. The Amazons look on in terror as Peacemaker coldly prepares to pull the trigger and take one or more of them out.



          



  Amazons Attack #5   Release Date: 2/27/24   Writer: Josie Campbell   Artist: Vasco Georgiev   Cover Artist: Clayton Henry   Variant Cover Artists: Irvin Rodriguez and Vasco Georgiev   Plot:Disturbing the peace! Queen Nubia and her sisters find themselves in the crosshairs of one of DC’s deadliest hired killers…Peacemaker! Elsewhere, Mary Marvel finds herself asking an unlikely ally for help in clearing the names of all Amazons. But can anyone be trusted in this game of lies?!  





 Peacemaker is Coming to Take Out the Amazons 
          

Things have majorly gone off the rails for the DC Universe&#39;s Amazons. An Amazon named Emelie killed a pool hall full of men after she was inappropriately touched, igniting a firestorm across the United States. The country&#39;s legislation acted quickly and created the Amazon Safety Act, which barred all Amazons from American soil. Those who stayed found themselves facing the Amazon Extradition Entity (or A.X.E), a task force that has detained and even killed Amazons. However, even in the face of paranoia and prejudice, Wonder Woman and other Amazons have fought back against the shadowy forces at work, no matter the danger it presents.

It doesn&#39;t seem like Peacemaker would present that much of a threat to most, or any, of the Amazons. After all, they&#39;re some of the most finely trained warriors around and have considerably better fighting experience and natural skills than Christopher Smith. However, Smith never backs down from a challenge, despite the overwhelming odds he faces. Not to mention, ever since the Amazons have been banned from America, the United States has stepped up its game when it comes to anti-Amazon weaponry. Now soldiers like Peacemaker are armed with bullets that can easily tear through any Amazon unlucky enough to be hit by it.






 Can Wonder Woman and the Amazons Stop Peacemaker? 
          

In most situations, no Amazon, much less Wonder Woman, would have to worry about someone like Peacemaker. For all his bluster, he&#39;s mostly just a stooge who couldn&#39;t take on most A-list heroes. However, with the Amazons now illegal and Smith having the full-backing of Amanda Waller, Peacemaker is far more dangerous than he previously was. Sure, he might not be much of a threat to Diana, but can the same be said for the rest of the Amazons? Will Wonder Woman&#39;s sisters stay safe or will they fall once Peacemaker has his eyes set on them?

Amazons Attack #5 will be available from DC Comics on February 27th, 2024.
