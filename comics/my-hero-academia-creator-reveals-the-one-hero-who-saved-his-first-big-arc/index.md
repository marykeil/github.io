# My Hero Academia Creator Reveals The One Hero Who Saved His First Big Arc


## SUMMARY 



  Shie Hassaikai arc in My Hero Academia is significant and gets quite dark, with the first character death in the series.   Series creator Kohei Horikoshi struggled to write such a dark arc and found inspiration in the character Fat Gum.   Fat Gum&#39;s good-natured attitude and role in the storyline helped Horikoshi push through and complete the arc.

## Literature Review

When writing one of My Hero Academia&#39;s largest and darkest arcs, series creator Kohei Horikoshi found himself relying on a particular hero for help.




My Hero Academia&#39;s first truly big story arc, in terms of length, happened to be the Shie Hassaikai arc, which pitted Deku and the heroes against Overhaul and his mafia. The arc has major story significance as well, and gets quite dark, being host to the first character death in the series. So dark, in fact, that series creator Kohei Horikoshi had a tough time writing it.




In an interview with Japanese site Natalie Comics (translated by Tumblr user Aitaikimochi) from 2018, Horikoshi discusses the then-recently concluded Shie Hassaikai arc (referred to here as the &#34;internship arc&#34;), which he says he wanted to be the first multi-volume story arc in the series, on par with longer story arcs from series like One Piece. However, the story became very dark, and Horikoshi began to struggle as he made his way into the middle of the story arc.

          

While Horikoshi says he likes reading darker stories, he found writing them to be very challenging, and that&#39;s when he latched onto a particular character one might not expect: Fat Gum.

In particular, Horikoshi cites the scene where Fat Gum and Kirishima battle against villains using My Hero Academia&#39;s own super soldier serum, the Quirk-enhancing drug, Trigger. The intense passion that these characters felt spread to Horikoshi, who was able to harness that emotional energy and push through the arc &#34;little by little.&#34; According to Horikoshi, his feelings are strongly shaped by what he&#39;s working on, and a darker arc like this one seems to have brought his mood down significantly. Horikoshi even refers to Fat Gum as &#34;my hero,&#34; suggesting that he felt he might not have been able to complete the arc otherwise.


Horikoshi: In the scene with Fat Gum and Kirishima fighting against the villain, I felt really passionate, and I was able to transfer that onto my brush. From that point, I was finally able to write out the Internship Arc little by little. Fat Gum is My Hero.


Fat Gum isn&#39;t a particularly major character within the series, although he does play a critical role in some of the larger operations, such as the Shie Hassaikai raid, where he made his debut. It seems likely that Fat Gum&#39;s role may have been expanded as a result of Horikoshi&#39;s feelings towards him, as Fat Gum is perhaps most prominent in this arc. As a character, Fat Gum is known for having a Kansai accent (akin to a rural or &#34;country&#34; accent) and generally being a little goofy due to his fat-based Quirk, so he definitely helped to bring some levity to the otherwise deadly serious Shie Hassaikai arc.




Fans may never have guessed that they owe the well-received Shie Hassaikai arc to Fat Gum in particular, but it seems the character&#39;s presence was vital to finishing the storyline for Horikoshi. Fat Gum would go on to join the stable of pro heroes that the series uses regularly, and would later appear in the Paranormal Liberation War arc and the Final War arc in important ways. It turns out that when My Hero Academia itself was in need of a hero, that hero ended up being Fat Gum, against all odds.
