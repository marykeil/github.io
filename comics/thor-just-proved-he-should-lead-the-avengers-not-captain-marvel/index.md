# Thor Just Proved He Should Lead the Avengers (Not Captain Marvel)


## SUMMARY 



  Thor demonstrates strong leadership by recognizing when not to fight and prioritizing the safety of his teammates.   Captain Marvel&#39;s confrontational mindset and focus on direct action may not always be the most efficient approach.   Captain Marvel can learn from Thor&#39;s example and adapt her leadership style to consider alternative solutions and strategies.

## Literature Review

While Captain Marvel would fight forever, Thor is wise enough to know when to walk away - a vital skill for someone who would lead the Avengers.




Warning: Spoilers for The Avengers #8 ahead!Captain Marvel may lead the current iteration of the Avengers, but Thor has recently shown why he would be an excellent leader, too. When trapped in a scenario where surrender is the only way to win, Thor is the only one of the Avengers to understand that some fights are just not worth fighting.




In Jed MacKay and C.F. Villa&#39;s The Avengers #8, Scarlet Witch and Vision are left to defend Kang from the Twilight Court (a super-team based on Arthurian legend) while the rest of the team is trapped in Nightmare&#39;s hellish dreamscapes. Although Thor is able to gather the Avengers together, Nightmare declares that none of them will be able to wake up until the Avengers acknowledge their defeat at his hands.

          

While Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Iron Man immediately reject Nightmare&#39;s demands, Thor understands that the Avengers have more important things to do than struggle their way out of Nightmare&#39;s dark dreams. The Go of Thunder immediately tells Nightmare that he has indeed defeated the Avengers, at which point Nightmare promptly lets them go.




                  After 18 Years, Avengers&#39; New Roster Pays Off a House of M Plot Thread   Carol Danvers has always been a fan-favorite, but her current status quo has finally let her reach her true potential as Captain Marvel.   


 The Avengers Need To Learn When Not To Fight 
          

When thinking about the lineup for her Avengers in The Avengers #1, Captain Marvel describes the Avengers as firefighters: &#34;[flying] into the blaze, whatever it is...we&#39;re the ones who can, so we&#39;re the ones who have to.&#34; This fits with her largely confrontational mindset: the problem at hand must be fought before it can spiral out of control. However, when every conflict is viewed as a fire, there is little room for nuance or negotiation. This has led to the immediate conflict with the Twilight Court, ostensibly heroic figures who seek to take Kang the Conqueror into custody. While Kang is currently assisting the Avengers, both groups wish to see him pay for his crimes across the timeline; there should be no immediate reason for the two teams to fight.




Thor seems to be the only one in this Avengers lineup who recognizes that not every super-problem requires a fight to solve. Given his origins and how he was first banished from Asgard for his pride, it makes sense that Thor is the first one to set his aside for the greater good; he sees that there is no sense wasting their energies fighting Nightmare when the Scarlet Witch and Vision are in danger. The Avengers need leadership that will help them solve problems more efficiently, not through displays of overwhelming force.



 To Lead The Avengers, Captain Marvel Must Follow Thor&#39;s Example 


          

It is highly unlikely that Thor will take over the Avengers from Captain Marvel: his obligation as King of Asgard leaves him far too busy to be solely concerned with protecting Earth. If this is the case, then Captain Marvel must show that she can find other ways to fight (metaphorical) fires than with her fists. While Thor has learned this lesson after many humbling years, Captain Marvel&#39;s very slogan (&#34;Higher, Further, Faster, More&#34;) emphasizes that her approach to problem-solving is much more direct. While Captain Marvel is one of Marvel&#39;s bravest heroes, she&#39;ll need to slow down and look to Thor&#39;s style of leadership if she truly wants to head the Avengers.
