## Literature Review

The ground is set for Green Lantern to join Superman’s film canon after Christopher Reeves’ Clark rescues a pilot that remarkably favors Hal Jordan.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Superman &#39;78: The Metal Curtain #2!The 1978 Superman movie mythos just got a little bit bigger with the surprising introduction of Green Lantern. For the first time, Christophe Reeves&#39; Man of Steel is facing off against a version of his kryptonite-powered nemesis Metallo, and caught up in the battle is Earth-789&#39;s version of Hal Jordan.




In Superman &#39;78: The Metal Curtain #2 by Robert Venditti and Gavin Guidry, Superman takes Lois Lane to the Fortress of Solitude to meet his Kryptonian parents. As he prepares to tell her his secret identity, Superman hears a pilot being shot down. Thankfully, Superman rescues the pilot, referred to only by his call sign &#39;Highball&#39;.

          

The perpetrator behind the attack is the Russian super-soldier Metallo, armed with a kryptonite-powered suit. Metallo attacks Superman and easily has him on the ropes. The pilot, revealed to be a brunette man, tries to fight back against Metallo. Unfortunately, the villain is too strong and effortlessly knocks the pilot out of the way.


 Superman &#39;78 Just Rescued His Version of Green Lantern Hal Jordan 
          




The Superman &#39;78 series is an expansion of the Richard Donner Superman franchise which featured actor Christopher Reeve in the starring role. Set in the Donnerverse, the series has added new characters that never appeared in the original films. In Superman &#39;78: The Metal Curtain, Clark&#39;s powerful villain Metallo has just been introduced. Rather than a discharged member of the United States Army, Metallo has been reinvented as a Russian soldier selected to become his nation&#39;s equivalent to Superman. With a powerful war suit that utilizes kryptonite, Metallo has been sent to crush Superman in a show of Soviet strength.

Granted, the pilot seen in this issue isn&#39;t called Hal Jordan, nor is he shown to be a member of the Green Lantern Corps. However, Jordan is a pilot and often uses the call sign &#39;Highball&#39;. Not to mention the pilot&#39;s brown hair and lantern jaw make him strongly favor the Emerald Knight. Not to mention, the pilot shows strong displays of heroism, attacking Metallo when it&#39;s obvious the pilot is greatly outclassed. The Superman &#39;78 series has previously introduced Hawkman to its continuity. The arrival of Green Lantern hints that the stage is potentially being set up for a future Justice League.






 Superman &#39;78 is Building Up a Justice League 
          

Superman &#39;78 is set in the same universe as Batman &#39;89 (Earth-789). So it&#39;s known that Batman does, or will, exist on this Earth. But now that Hal Jordan is potentially around, there&#39;s a solid chance he could be getting his Power Ring soon. And if Green Lantern joins Batman and Superman, its just a matter of time until more heroes debut, giving the Superman film canon it&#39;s very own Justice League. Of course, this is all dependent on whether the pilot is actually Hal. But given his similarities, it&#39;s safe to say that Green Lantern has just joined Superman &#39;78&#39;s continuity.

Superman &#39;78: The Metal Curtain is on sale now from DC Comics.
