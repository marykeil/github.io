# Batman s New Laser Gauntlets Are the Power Upgrade He s Always Needed


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s new laser gauntlets give him a fighting chance against his toughest opponent, but they&#39;re not enough to defeat him.   The gauntlets can cut through tree trunks like tissue paper, making them a formidable weapon against Batman&#39;s enemies.   While they may be overkill for most of Batman&#39;s rogues gallery, the gauntlets would be a great asset when facing more powerful opponents, like those he faces with the Justice League.

## Literature Review

As Batman goes to war with his most dangerous foe ever, he builds an awesome new gadget that deserves to be a permanent addition to his cache.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #141!A powerful pair of laser-projecting gauntlets is the coolest crime-fighting upgrade Batman has always needed. While battling the toughest opponent the Dark Knight has ever faced, Bruce Wayne is forced to pull out every trick he has in the book to beat him, including an awesome new set of weapons.




In Batman #141 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge Jiminez, Bruce has been captured by the &#39;new Batman&#39;, his dangerous backup personality, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh, who&#39;s now in Failsafe&#39;s robotic body. Batman escapes his foe, but Zur-En-Arrh is simply too powerful for Batman to evade for long. Thankfully, Bruce discovers Zur-En-Arrh&#39;s workshop and prepares a plan of attack.

          

When Zur-En-Arrh catches up, Batman attacks him, wielding a pair of gauntlets that project blade-like lasers. The weapons do some damage to Zur-En-Arrh&#39;s new body and are even sharp enough to cut through tree trunks like tissue paper. Unfortunately, as powerful as his new gauntlets are. Zur-En-Arrh is simply too mighty for Bruce to defeat.


 Batman&#39;s Laser Gauntlets Nearly Helped Him Beat His Most Dangerous Foe 
          




Batman has faced a lot of danger in his life, but nothing as bad as Zur-En-Arrh. For months now, the backup persona has been subtly influencing Bruce&#39;s thoughts and behaviors, even making him go so far as to put his family at risk during &#34;Gotham War&#34;. After Batman&#39;s conflict with Catwoman passed, Bruce severed his ties with the Bat-Family, allowing Zur-En-Arrh even more sway over Batman&#39;s life. Batman eventually decided to track down the Joker and end his chaos for good. However, that adventure ended with Zur-Enn-Arrh assuming control of Batman&#39;s body, that is before Zur-En-Arrh decided Failsafe&#39;s robotic body was a much better form.

While Batman technically didn&#39;t create the laser-projecting gauntlets, they&#39;d make a fine permanent addition to his cache of weapons. Bruce doesn&#39;t defeat Zur-En-Arrh&#39;s upgraded body, but the new gauntlets do manage to get the Failsafe form on the ropes. Defeating Zur-En-Arrh was always going to be an uphill battle. But the new gauntlets gave Bruce a fighting chance when he was otherwise out of options. While they didn&#39;t exactly help him in this scenario, Zur-En-Arrh is an extreme case compared to Batman&#39;s other rogues. In a battle with any of the Caped Crusader&#39;s other foes, these badass blades could be a serious asset.






 Batman&#39;s Villains Wouldn&#39;t Stand a Chance Against His New Weaponry 
          

Sure, Zur-En-Arrh could stand up to a couple of hits from Batman&#39;s laser gauntlets. But how would they do against other technology-using villains like Mister Freeze? Bane&#39;s size and strength would almost certainly be of no use if Bruce pulled these gauntlets out in their next battle. Most of, if not all of Batman&#39;s enemies would be running scared the moment they saw Batman bust these weapons out. Granted, it&#39;s probably overkill for much of the Dark Knight&#39;s villains, but they&#39;d be a great asset to have when Bruce takes on more powerful opponents in his adventures with the Justice League. Whatever villain he fights, Batman adding these gauntlets into the mix is something the hero should strongly consider.

Batman #141 is on sale now from DC Comics.
