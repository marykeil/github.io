# This X-TREME X-MEN Villain is Long Overdue To Return (With a Twist)


## SUMMARY 



  One early 2000s X-Men villain&#39;s potential for a return lies in a small but significant update to his motivations, which would open up a wide range of storytelling possibilities.   Vargas&#39; debut in X-Treme X-Men made him a major antagonist at the time; his killing of Psylocke in the series second issue etched his name in readers&#39; memories forever.   If resurrected, Vargas&#39; character would be completely different, with the potential to become an ally to the X-Men, or return as an even stronger and more determined villain.

## Literature Review

Chris Claremont has been a gamechanging X-Men writer for over four decades; one of his 2000s creations, X-TREME X-MEN&#39;s villain, is due to return.




At one time, the villain known as Vargas threatened to be one of the worst enemies ever faced by the X-Men – while he ultimately proved not to be as sustainable a threat as he initially seemed, and subsequently faded from prominence, the character has great potential for a return, with one small but significant update to motivations opening up a wide range of storytelling potential.




X-Treme X-Men #1 – written by legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont, with art by Salavador Larroca – introduced Vargas as the book&#39;s central antagonist. In possession of one of Destiny&#39;s diaries, containing her visions of future events, Vargas sought to circumvent his own foretold death, which was apparently to come at the hands of Rogue.



          

Vargas&#39; early appearances were gamechanging for the X-franchise at the time; while his eventual fate was left ambiguous, a potential off-screen death and resurrection for the character could completely redefine him, potentially allowing him to return in the future and fulfill a completely different role in the Marvel Universe.

 Vargas Carved His Name In X-History With One Brutal Act 
          



X-Treme X-Men #1 debuted in July 2001. The initial volume of the series ran for 46 issues.




X-Treme X-Men #2 featured the shocking death of fan-favorite mutant Psylocke at the hands of the newly introduced villain, Vargas. Aside from being beloved by readers, the mutant ninja and her psionic sword were immensely powerful –

the ease with which Vargas dispatched her indicated to readers at the time that he was a major antagonist. X-Treme was writer Chris Claremont&#39;s exciting new X-title, following his departure from the signature X-books of the era. Coupled with the franchise&#39;s editorial policy against character resurrections at the time, Psylocke&#39;s death was a huge deal, forever etching Vargas&#39; name in readers memories – even if he wouldn&#39;t remain a prominent figure for long.




Following an ambiguous ending to his climactic confrontation with Rogue in X-Treme X-Men #17, Vargas was dropped completely. Only a throwaway reference in an issue of X-Men from five years later indicated that the villain had been killed off-panel – though not by Rogue, but in fact by agents of Mr. Sinister. After everything he did to try to prevent his own death, Vargas&#39; final opinion, that fate was set in stone, was proven right, in a sense. Though not by the exact circumstances from Destiny&#39;s diary, his interactions with the X-Men, and the diaries themselves, were ultimately terminal for him.



 A Resurrected Vargas Would Be Completely Different 


          





X-Treme X-Men #17 – by Claremont and Larroca – was released in August 2002. Vargas was referenced in 2007&#39;s X-Men #202, by Mike Carey and Humberto Ramos, and has not appeared since.







As with any comic book character, Vargas has only been forgotten about until he hasn&#39;t anymore – until some writer pulls him out of the archives and reintroduces him in a new, exciting way. Above all else, Vargas&#39; was motivated by a fear of death, a desire to prevent himself from dying; if the character was in fact killed on the orders of Mr. Sinister, and were to be brought back, it would result in a significant shift in his character. His character motivations, and consequently, his role in the story, would be completely different, creating a thrilling set of new narrative opportunities for a resurrected Vargas.

No longer trying to prevent his own death – having experienced it and then returned – Vargas may have no reason to come into conflict with the X-Men. He could attempt to stay out of danger entirely, trying to preserve his precious second attempt at life. Alternatively, he could now have a vendetta against Mr. Sinister, in all his forms, which could in fact make him a useful ally for the X-Men, in a classic role reversal. Of course, he could certainly return as a villain once more, even stronger, even more determined to destroy the X-Men – fulfilling the potential of the character, as introduced by Chris Claremont in his early X-Treme X-Men run.
