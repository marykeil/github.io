## Literature Review

Jump GIGA resumes Black Clover&#39;s story that initially began in Shonen Jump with a massive battle that showcases the best version of the Black Bulls.




Warning: Spoilers for Black Clover chapter #369Black Clover&#39;s first chapter in Jump GIGA features the first two Black Bulls members to use the Anti-Magic powerup that Asta gave them during the series&#39; last chapter in Shonen Jump. Since Jump GIGA is a quarterly publication, fans won&#39;t get to see how Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic augments the other Black Bulls&#39; magical powers for another three months, but how relevant Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic makes Magna and Luck in Black Clover&#39;s latest installment proves that it will be worth the wait.




In chapter #369 of Black Clover by Yuki Tabata, Magna and Luck unleash their Anti-Magic-enhanced powers on one of Lucius Zogratis&#39; many clones that the villain created using the magic he took from his siblings. Luck first casts Black Lightning Battle Fiend to get some of Lucius&#39; Paladins out of the way.

          

Then Magna uses Dark Black Flame Magic: Soul Chain Team Death Match to equally split the magic of Lucius&#39; clone between the three of them before the two Black Bulls combine their magic to defeat their opponent with Black Flame Black Lightning: Exploding Cannon.

Black Clover had already hyped up this match because Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic made the Black Bulls relevant again after their usefulness had fallen off. Earlier chapters already established that Anti-Magic was the only way to defeat Lucius, and none of the Black Bulls possessed any such power except for Asta. However, chapter #369 delivers something just as exciting.

Much earlier in chapter #293, Magna cast what would turn out to be one of the most important spells in Black Clover. It first highlighted one of Black Clover&#39;s darkest messages, that no matter how hard someone tries, sometimes the world&#39;s injustices are just insurmountable. As was the case with every peasant, Magna had to take a much longer amount of time than his higher-class colleagues to create a spell that would still be inferior to theirs. The spell also broke a stagnant shonen trope since a relatively irrelevant, weak character like Magna was able to defeat one of the Dark Triad. Now in chapter #369, Magna casts the Anti-Magic version of that very spell to the same surprising effect.




Black Flame Black Lightning: Exploding Cannon is also important because of how Magna and Luck initially used the regular version of that very attack without Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic. The first time they cast the combo spell was against Vetto in chapter #64. However, Vetto blocked it and the two collapsed without defeating him. It is appropriate that they are now unleashing the same spell against their overpowered opponent with Asta&#39;s Anti-Magic. As Magna and Luck said during their battle against Vetto, the reason they didn&#39;t give up was that they felt like they wouldn&#39;t be able to face Asta again if they gave in. With the added context of this latest fight, Asta&#39;s magic symbolizes the positive effect that Asta has had.

So while Black Clover&#39;s debut chapter in Jump GIGA is consequently the first time that the Black Bulls showcase their Anti-Magic-enhanced powers, it has already proven to represent so much more. Black Clover is not only revisiting one of shonen&#39;s most consequential powers with the Black Bulls&#39; Anti-Magic powerup, but once again uses magic as a metaphor to showcase one of the series&#39; most powerful messages.
