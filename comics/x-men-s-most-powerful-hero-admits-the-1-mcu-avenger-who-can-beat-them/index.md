# X-Men s Most Powerful Hero Admits the 1 MCU Avenger Who Can Beat Them


## SUMMARY 



  In Original X-Men #1, the Phoenix of Earth-696 brainwashes Tony Stark so that there&#39;s nothing in the way of her conquering the world.   Tony Stark&#39;s independent streak and creative genius make him a formidable opponent for the Phoenix, as seen in his Phoenix-Buster armor in Avengers vs. X-Men.   The true threat in this story is Onslaught, disguised as the Dark Phoenix, and Jean assembles a team of Wolverines to stop it in the upcoming Weapon X-Men miniseries.

## Literature Review

When the Phoenix conquers Earth, the world&#39;s strongest heroes fight back, and there&#39;s one Avenger who needs to dealt with so she can reign.




Warning: Spoilers for Original X-Men #1 ahead!When the original five X-Men travel to a world overrun by the Phoenix, only one Avenger stands in the way between the fiery cosmic entity and total world domination: Iron Man. By taking out Tony Stark, the tyrannical Phoenix is able to hold onto her power without much of a challenge.




In Original X-Men #1 by Christos Gage, Greg Land, Jay Leisten, and Frank D&#39;Armata, Professor X&#39;s first five X-Men are sent to another reality by one version of the Phoenix to stop another. At first, the second Phoenix doesn&#39;t seem too bad: she&#39;s brought peace to her world, and mutants don&#39;t live in fear. However, that peace came at the cost of her conquering anyone who threatened her control, including the X-Men&#39;s allies in the Avengers. The real shock comes when Beast of this new world (Earth-696) introduces the young team to a babbling, bearded man in the lab: a brainwashed Tony Stark.

          

Beast explains that Jean said she&#39;d just &#34;suppress the independent streak&#34; in Tony. This evokes the real-world medical practice of lobotomy: a surgery that promised to only shut down the &#34;bad&#34; parts of the brain but was typically wielded as a weapon against anyone society deemed unworthy. With her unlimited power, this shows that even Phoenix knew she couldn&#39;t kill Tony Stark without repercussions, and instead promised a more gentle approach that was just as cruel.




                  The X-Men&#39;s Phoenix Force Is Earth&#39;s Last Chance   A Dominion is coming to Earth to absorb all living creatures into its collective consciousness, and only the Phoenix Force is able to destroy it.    


 Tony Stark&#39;s Creative Genius Could Beat the Phoenix 
          

Marvel is full of geniuses - Hank Pym, Reed Richards, Lunella Lafayette. What sets Tony Stark up for greatness is his personality paired with his smarts. His intelligence can invent tech and solve equations, but his independent streak is what allows him to take those a step further to make him the man he is today. It would also drive him to stand up to the Phoenix if she was looking for world peace by way of bringing everyone under her control. In 2012&#39;s Avengers vs. X-Men, when the Phoenix Force is headed to Earth, but the two teams are divided as to whether it spells salvation or destruction. Tony leads the charge against it with his Phoenix-Buster armor.




It&#39;s easy to see how the X-Men of Earth-696 have accepted this attack on Tony. They&#39;re used to being hated, trying to do the right thing, and then hated even more as people they care about die. When Jean can make things peaceful, the cost of her brainwashing seems worth it. Who needs Tony Stark when there&#39;s intergalactic peace? As this older version of Angel says:



&#34;You compromise. Just a little. Just this once. Then you do it again. After a while, you tell yourself it was for the best, the only way. And you actually believe it. Until your teenage self shows up...and all it takes is one look to see just how much of a hypocrite sellout you are.&#34;




When Iron Man stood against the Phoenix in this universe, Jean&#39;s friends were so far gone that they reasoned he must be in the wrong. In actuality, he was fighting a tyrant and hoping he could win.



 Phoenix&#39;s Greatest Weapon May Be Weapon X 


          




Ultimately, the Dark Phoenix of Earth-696 is revealed to not be a Phoenix at all, but Onslaught, biding its time and building up power while using the Phoenix Force as a disguise and sapping Jean&#39;s powers. The young X-Men accomplish their mission, uniting their alternate selves to stop Jean, but the Phoenix who sent them admits that Onslaught is too big of a menace for them to handle.

Jean doesn&#39;t want to fight it directly out of fear that Onslaught will absorb her powers and become truly unstoppable. Thus, she needs a team who&#39;s the best at what they do: a multiversal team of Wolverines. This story sets up March&#39;s Weapon X-Men miniseries, where James Howlett of Earth-295 forms a team of his variants across the multiverse to handle Onslaught. Now that the Phoenix knows what the X-Men are truly fighting, she doesn&#39;t need to stop Iron Man first.
