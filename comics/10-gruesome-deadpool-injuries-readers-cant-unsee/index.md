## Literature Review

Deadpool has one of the most impressive healing factors in comic book fiction, which means his injuries can be the most gruesome. Here&#39;s the 10 best! 




Deadpool’s healing factor might be the most impressive out of everyone with superhuman healing powers in the Marvel Universe, given the extreme level of gruesome injuries he suffers during nearly every mission he undertakes, yet is still able to recover from.
Wade Wilson is effectively immortal, as even decapitation and complete dismemberment have absolutely no effect on him. However, even if they don’t cause death, Deadpool is not immune to the injuries themselves. He’s not invincible, he takes damage, he just heals from that damage. But before the healing process takes effect, Deadpool still has to suffer the grisly consequences of the horrific violence he has just experienced - and Marvel Comics readers are exposed to every detail, front and center. Here are 10 of the most gruesome Deadpool injuries readers can’t unsee.
            
 
 10 Deadpool Moments That Prove He&#39;s Way Smarter Than He Pretends 
Deadpool is a nearly immortal mutate who&#39;s an incredibly skilled killer, but also more intelligent than he lets on. Here are 10 moments that prove it!












 








 10  Deadpool Was Cut In Half With Captain America’s Shield 
Uncanny Avengers #4 by Gerry Duggan and Javier Garrón
        

While fighting alongside the Uncanny Avengers against the worldwide evil Orchis and its Sentinels represent, Deadpool finds himself on the wrong side of Captain America’s shield after it was stolen by Captain Krakoa (aka Hydra Cap) and thrown at Wade with all the strength of the original super-soldier Avenger.
He seemed more annoyed than anything, but the sight of Deadpool cut in half by Captain America’s shield - with his top half slowly sliding to the side, his guts falling to the ground - is one that’s hard to forget.





 9  Deadpool Was Pushed Through Jail Cell Bars By Conan The Barbarian 
Savage Avengers #17 by Gerry Duggan and Kev Walker


 







After Conan finds himself in a holding cell with Deadpool following his magical trip to the future (which is what sparked this series to begin with), he quickly learns that Deadpool has a healing factor much like Wolverine - having fought alongside Logan in a previous issue. So, Conan comes up with a brutal idea for escape: push Deadpool through the bars.
What fans get is a mess of crushed bone and explicit gore, as if Deadpool was literally put through a meat grinder and came out mashed on the other side.





 8  Deadpool Got Fried By Cyclops &amp; Storm Possessed By The King In Black 
Savage Avengers #19 by Gerry Duggan and Kev Walker
        

Deadpool, Conan, and the rest of the Savage Avengers accept the job the other X-Men offered them: save their possessed comrades. The King in Black possessed a great many heroes during his short-lived reign, including Storm and Cyclops. When the Savage Avengers tried to free them, Cyclops and Storm used their abilities to literally fry Deadpool as he stood atop a skyscraper, falling to the ground half disintegrated and completely charred.
Deadpool’s injuries were alarmingly gruesome, even for him, and they were definitely a horrific sight to behold.





 7  Deadpool’s Body Gets Stabbed &amp; Invaded By Carnage’s Tendrils 
Deadpool vs Carnage #2 by Cullen Bunn and Salva Espin
        

While Deadpool is watching TV, he seemingly gets a sign from the universe (aka his own insanity), that he needs to track down Carnage and put him down for good. Wade eventually finds Cletus, and initially takes him off guard with a rocket launcher attack, taking out Carnage’s front porch. However, the tables quickly turn on Deadpool, as Carnage shoots his tendrils through Wade’s body, and allows them to explore his insides in an agonizing display of sadism.
The pain Deadpool experiences is almost as disturbing as the pleasure Carnage gets out of causing it, making this whole scene absolutely skin-crawling.





 6  A Deadpool Variant Starts Killing Every Deadpool In The Multiverse 
Deadpool Kills Deadpool by Cullen Bunn and Salva Espin


 







While the individual deaths in this limited series are truly shocking - including one instance of Deadpool getting stabbed with a chainsaw - it’s the entire event that is really disturbing for fans. It isn’t just Deadpool getting injured in absurd ways, it’s the mean, violent genocide of every Deadpool in the multiverse.
The pain brought to the collective embodiment of Deadpool is beyond compare, with countless variants suffering grisly fates that they aren’t going to come back from.





 5  Deadpool’s Head &amp; Spine Are Ripped From His Body By The Hulk 
Deadpool: Black, White, &amp; Blood #2 “Pool of Death” by Daniel Warren Johnson
        

This extremely meta story shows Deadpool pitching Deadpool story ideas to the writer/artist of this very storyline, Daniel Warren Johnson. Or, more accurately, Johnson is pitching Deadpool Deadpool story ideas. Wade wants to do something a bit more original than teaming up with Cable or fighting Wolverine. So, Johnson suggests that Deadpool fight the Hulk, at which point the comic jumps to that potential battle, showing Deadpool getting his head and spine ripped from his body by the founding Avenger.
Deadpool promptly shoots down this idea, but not before it was depicted in the comic itself, allowing the brutal image the opportunity to be burned into the minds of readers everywhere.





 4  Deadpool’s Head Gets Popped Like An Over-Inflated Balloon By Sue Storm 
Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe #1 by Cullen Bunn and Dalibor Talajic
        

When Deadpool goes mad at the notion that he’s a fictional character, as is everyone in his entire reality, he decides to put them all out of their misery before eliminating the very existence of the Marvel Universe itself by killing the writers of Marvel Comics. But, before he can go too cosmically meta with this murder-mission, first thing is first: Deadpool has to kill every main character in the Marvel Universe personally. High on that list was Marvel’s First Family themselves, the Fantastic Four, though killing them was easier said than done. Upon his initial attack, Sue Storm used her powers to create a force field inside Deadpool’s skull before rapidly expanding it, causing his head to pop like an over-inflated balloon.
Deadpool absolutely deserved this horrific (albeit a bit comical) injury, as his entire mission in this comic is that of the most deranged level of supervillain imaginable. But, deserved or not, this injury was truly a shocking one.





 3  Deadpool Got His Head Crushed By A Swinging Anvil 
Deadpool Team-Up #885 by Rick Spears and Phillip Bond
        

Deadpool is a fairly cartoonish character by nature, especially when he exists in a self-contained story separate from the rest of the more grounded Marvel heroes/antiheroes - and this story pushes that point to the extreme. Without even getting into the ‘Looney Tune-esque’ nonsense that occurs afterward, this comic opens with Deadpool walking through the street and triggering a booby trap that releases an anvil tied to a rope, causing it to swing down from its perch and nail Deadpool right in the face, splattering his brains all over the pavement.
Deadpool may operate on cartoon logic during a number of his adventures, but not this time, as what should have been a pretty cartoonish injury actually had a very real (and painful) result.





 2  Deadpool Had All His Bones Removed (&amp; Was Made Into A Literal Cape) 
Deadpool #11 by Skottie Young and Scott Hepburn


 







Deadpool being ‘made into a literal cape’ was admittedly only for the sake of the cover art for this issue, but that absolutely could have been his fate in the book itself, as the murderous vigilante Good Night did remove all his bones. Good Night is the ‘cliché’ vigilante that resulted from Deadpool killing his parents when he was just a kid, sparking an epic tale of vengeance and bloodshed. To make Deadpool suffer for what he did, Good Night removed Wade’s bones and dragged him around the city.
The idea of having one’s bones removed from their body with surgical precision and then sewn back up, thereby being reduced to a sloshy sake of wet meat, is truly vomit-inducing, and is not an idea fans will be able to free from their minds any time soon.





 1  Deadpool Got Ripped In Half By Luke Cage &amp; Thor 
Deadpool Annual 2013 #1 by Ben Acker, Ben Blacker, and Evan “Doc” Shaner
        

As Deadpool is attempting to assassinate Matt Murdock, he’s approached by a character no one had ever seen before - one who was even more crazy and meta than Deadpool himself: Madcap. Turns out, Madcap was just a weird extension of Deadpool’s fractured psyche all along, and the only way to ‘free’ Madcap from Deadpool’s body was for the Merc with the Mouth to quite literally be torn in two. So, with Luke Cage and Thor already sharing a rooftop with Deadpool at the moment Wade and Madcap come to this realization, the two promptly rip Deadpool in half, thereby fulfilling the unhinged request of an alarmingly insane antihero.
Just because Deadpool wanted it to happen, doesn’t make this injury any less gruesome, which is why it is prominently featured among the 10 Deadpool injuries readers can’t unsee.
