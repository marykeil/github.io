The joy among fans was palpable when news broke that it wasn’t the end of the Spider-Verse after what many thought was the epic conclusion to Spider-Man&#39;s multiverse back in 2022. The highly anticipated return is set to kick off with Edge of Spider-Verse (2024) #1, crafted by the talented team of Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, Nilah Magruder, Travel Foreman, and Eric Gapstur, hitting the shelves on February 21. This inaugural issue promises the introduction of the enigmatic Weapon VIII and the thrilling return of the tech-savvy Spider-Byte. Building on the suspense, issue two will unveil the debut of the mysterious Spooky-Man and bring back the fan-favorite Cyborg Spider-Man.




Edge of Spider-Verse (2024) #2 takes readers to the perilous halls of Spider-High, considered the most dangerous high school on Earth. The narrative centers around Gluemy Miller, the new kid at Spider-High, navigating the challenges of his first year amid a faculty of villainous teachers actively trying to bring about his demise. As if that weren&#39;t enough, the looming threat of Spooky-Man adds an extra layer of danger, with little information available about this sinister new character other than his lethal nature. The emergence of Spooky-Man suggests a pivotal role in the unfolding series, promising suspense and intrigue for fans of the Spider-Verse.



 Venom Vibes: Spooky-Man&#39;s Character Design Shares Striking Similarities 
          

The resemblance between Spooky-Man and Marvel&#39;s iconic symbiote, Venom, is unmistakable, with both characters donning a full-body inky black appearance adorned by the characteristic white spider symbol prominently placed on their chests. The striking similarities continue with their large milky eyes and menacing mouths filled with razor-sharp teeth, traits that have long been associated with the notorious Venom. However, Spooky-Man introduces a unique twist, showcasing a more lithe and angular form with deadly protrusions and a distinctive set of pinches. As the latest Spider-Verse narrative unfolds, the question arises whether there&#39;s a deeper connection between Spooky-Man and Venom beyond their aesthetic resemblance, adding an intriguing layer to the unfolding tale.




Edge of Spider-Verse (2024) #2 will be available on March 27, 2024, from Marvel.
