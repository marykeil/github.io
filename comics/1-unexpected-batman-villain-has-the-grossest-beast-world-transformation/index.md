## Literature Review

One Batman villain&#39;s &#34;Beast World&#34; transformation is just the latest, greatest, and grossest metamorphosis he has experienced over the years.

One lesser-known Batman villain has consistently managed to transform over the years – and his latest transformation is his most disgusting yet. As DC&#39;s latest crossover event, &#34;Beast World&#34; wreaks havoc on the company&#39;s heroes and villains alike, transforming them into animalistic versions of themselves. For Gotham rogue Killer Moth, this not an unfamiliar experience.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham features the story &#34;Wild Thing&#34; – written by Kyle Starks, with art by Kelley Jones, Jose Villarrubia, and Lucas Gattoni – starring Kller Moth. The world is currently under attack by Beastboy and his Beast spores, resulting in a viral version of his powers spreading throughout the DC Universe.



          

One of the most disturbing transformations to result from this befalls Killer Moth, who is transformed not into a moth, but rather a giant cockroach. Cockroach-Killer Moth breaks into a food bank and begins devouring everything, before being confronted and stopped by Stephanie Brown. Strangely though, this isn&#39;t the first monstrous transformation Killer Moth experienced.

The events of &#34;Beast World&#34; follow after Beastboy transformed into Starro and had his human mind erased. Now running on pure instinct, &#34;Garro&#34; is trying to take over the world, unleashing Beast spores that transform people into monsters. Drury Walker is one of Batman&#39;s least intimidating villains; Batman admitting he doesn&#39;t plan for Killer Moth because of how insignificant he finds the villain to be. Neither villains nor heroes tend to take him seriously. Despite these shortcomings, Killer Moth has managed to persist as a Batman antagonist for quite a while, and has been transformed into a horrific monster once before.




When Neron began making deals with villains around the DC Universe in the storyline Underworld Unleashed, one of the villains he struck a bargain with was Killer Moth, who wanted to be feared by all who saw him. After Moth sold his soul, Neron transformed Killer Moth into the demon Charaxes. While Charaxes still wasn&#39;t given much more respect, he was definitely significantly more dangerous than Month was previously, turning Killer Moth into a scarier villain. While Killer Moth eventually lost his Charaxes form, it seems he&#39;s found another transformation that&#39;s just as horrifying with his new &#34;Beast World&#34; transformation into a cockroach.

Not only is his costume remarkably garish, but the name of &#34;Killer Moth&#34; doesn&#39;t exactly inspire fear in all those who hear it.. Still, the character has managed to persist throughout Batman&#39;s history, despite being a fairly low-level criminal. Part of the reason is that Killer Moth gives DC writers the perfectly opportunity to experiment with a character. Drury Walker is far from an A-list villain, so transforming him into the demon Charaxes, or a cockroach beast, is a good way to keep readers invested when he appears. That&#39;s why Batman villain Killer Moth has had multiple horrifying transformations over the years, including the grossest so far in DC&#39;s &#34;Beast World.&#34;
