## Literature Review

One Justice Leaguer is still shaking off a devastating attack, but a future solicitation makes it sound like this older legacy is calling it quits.




The time for one member of the Justice League is coming up faster than fans expected. No one likes seeing a hero end their career early, but recent events might have pushed one iconic Leaguer to his breaking point. That is unless two of his closest allies can convince him otherwise.




2024 has finally come and fans have a look at what they can expect in the coming months thanks to DC&#39;s recently released batch of solicitations. In March fans have a bunch of unexpected events happening, including the debut of the Jungle League. But DC fans may have noticed a particularly grim line in Blue Beetle #7&#39;s plot. Ted Kord, Jaime Reyes&#39; predecessor, is having trouble readjusting to the hero life after Blue Beetle&#39;s recent attack. Reyes consults Ted&#39;s best friend Booster Gold to get the elder Blue Beetle back in fighting condition. But by the sound of things, it may be time for Kord to step down.

 Ted Kord is Hanging Up His Blue Beetle Goggles? 
          

Blue Beetle is a legacy title that began with Dan Garrett before being passed down to Ted Kord and later Jaime Reyes. While Kord never used the Scarab that empowered Garrett and Jaime, Ted more than made up for it with his technological prowess. Ted has served as a mentor to Jaime, especially as Palmera City began hosting the Horizon, a peaceful splinter of the villainous Reach. However, it wasn&#39;t long before the Horizon settled that Ted was attacked by a mysterious villain known as the Blood Scarab. Kord survived, but he was placed in critical care as his friends searched for his attacker.

The second Blue Beetle hasn&#39;t been seen much since his attack as he&#39;s still recovering. While Ted is in far better condition than when he went up against Maxwell Lord, it was a something that nearly claimed Ted&#39;s life. Thankfully, he&#39;s got the best care possible, but the extent of the Blood Scarab&#39;s attack isn&#39;t known yet. Kord could be suffering from something that physically prevents him from returning to superhero life. Or he could have lingering psychological trauma from his near-death experience. Whatever the damage, Ted might just not be in the right condition to continue his work as Blue Beetle.






 Jaime Reyes, the DC Universe&#39;s Sole Blue Beetle? 
          

Jaime Reyes looks up to Ted and has been working closely with him and his sister Victoria to help the Horizon adapt to Earth. While Jaime has grown into a fine hero on his own, he still consults with Ted for Jaime&#39;s more ambitious projects. But if Ted is really retiring from the hero game, then this is going to be huge for Jaime. He&#39;s not going to have his mentor there to assist him when things get too heavy on the battlefield. Sure, Jaime has his new team of other Scarab-using heroes. But Jaime is going to have some big things to resolve on his own if his trusted Justice League ally is hanging it up for good.

Blue Beetle #7 is available from DC Comics on March 5th.
