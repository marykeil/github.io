## Literature Review

Jim Davis&#39; cartoon cat Garfield may be famous for his laziness and wisecracks, but when Jon actually irritates him, the claws come out.




Garfield can have his lovable moments where he is a loyal and fun pet for his owner, Jon. However, this is the exception rather than the rule with the lasagna-loving cat. He makes fun of Jon constantly, teasing him about his unique clothes and his less than packed social schedule. And when that isn&#39;t enough, Garfield has a surprisingly frequent habit of beating up his owner.
Garfield loves finding excuses to strike Jon, from waking him up to swatting a pesky fly. Other times, he beats up Jon just to mess with him. However, Garfield isn&#39;t just being malicious - he&#39;s being realistic. Cat owners will recognize that sometimes, loving a feline comes with a moderate risk of violence. Here are the 10 funniest Garfield comics where the cat pounces on his human companion.









 








 10  &#34;Bad Cat!&#34; 
Garfield May Make Fun of Jon, But He Still Wants His Attention
        

Garfield loves sleeping and eating, and often expresses frustration with his nearest and dearest, so it&#39;s easy to forget that he really does care what they think. In this strip, Garfield simply wants his owner&#39;s attention, smugly getting it by swatting Jon around the head and throwing him into a seething rage. As funny as this strip is, it&#39;s also a classic pet owner gag, where an animal expresses their needs in an utterly confusing way.
The strip is also a great candidate for &#39;Garfield Thrown Out the Window&#39; - a fan creation where classic strips are rewritten by replacing the last panel with Garfield being hurled through a window, adding a violent conclusion to every disagreement.





 9  &#34;You&#39;re Delirious&#34; 
Garfield&#39;s Obsession with Food Moves Him to Violence
        

In this strip, Jon makes the mistake of depriving Garfield of food. While Garfield attacks in response, it turns out he really is worried about Jon, as the prospect of missing dessert is so unthinkable. In a smart end to the joke, it turns out that after considering his position, Jon agrees. This strip really shows how Jim Davis&#39; art perfectly expresses slapstick violence, as Jon&#39;s simple design lends itself to being slapped, shaken, and left totally disheveled.





 8  &#34;Your Favorite Pet&#34; 
Garfield May Love to Sleep, But That Doesn&#39;t Mean He Respects Jon&#39;s Rest
        

Yet again, the humor of Garfield comes from having the sarcastic cartoon character put his own spin on normal cat behavior. He&#39;s demanding, rude, and can be outright annoying - but he&#39;s also simply a pet keen to wake up his owner for another day of fun (and likely to fill his food bowl.) Unlike in other strips, Garfield does at least try other options before getting violent, but sadly nothing can compare to an outright attack.





 7  &#34;A Face Lift&#34; 
Garfield Tries His Hand At Plastic Surgery
        

 Garfield tries his hand at plastic surgery in this hilarious strip. When Jon bemoans his looks, Garfield takes action and does a makeshift face lift and tummy tuck on Jon, but it really just looks like it&#39;s a cover to beat him up. After putting Jon through the wringer, Garfield states that now his owner looks awful. It&#39;s a classic vaudeville joke, as Garfield&#39;s initial statement makes it seem like he&#39;s trying to make Jon look better, when actually he&#39;s providing context for what &#34;awful&#34; actually looks like.





 6  &#34;Wrath of the Chicken&#34; 
Garfield&#39;s Imaginary Friend Gets Violent
        

 Stretch the rubber chicken is a recurring &#39;character&#39; in Garfield, as the cat uses his imaginary animal friend to commit acts of violence while dodging responsibility. Fitting for Garfield&#39;s personality, he uses his rubber chicken in the most obnoxious way possible, first demanding that Jon shows it respect, then attacking him with the toy when he refuses. To be fair, Jon does greet Stretch with aggression, but that&#39;s because he&#39;s experienced the &#34;wrath of the chicken&#34; before - as has Odie the dog, who&#39;s also often the target of Garfield&#39;s violence.





 5  &#34;Change the Channel&#34; 
Garfield May Be Violent... But He&#39;s Also a Hypocrite
        

Garfield generally considers himself the king of the castle, so it&#39;s not surprising to see him taking up the sofa while he and Jon watch TV. However, when violence comes on the screen, Jon also turns into Garfield&#39;s remote control, as the cat hypocritically doesn&#39;t like watching violence (just carrying it out.) This early strip showcases Garfield&#39;s bad attitude, but also Jon&#39;s seeming understanding of exactly where his cat is coming from, as he immediately understands what the &#39;signal&#39; meant.





 4  &#34;Master of the House&#34; 
A Wake Up Call, Garfield Style
        

 In this strip featuring Garfield&#39;s original design, Jon gets a rude awakening while Garfield monologues about a cat&#39;s place in the home. Sadly, Jon failed to see the sign of things to come, giving in to Garfield&#39;s early morning demands and confirming to the cat that surprise attacks are an effective way to communicate.





 3  &#34;I Wanna Sign&#34; 
Garfield Gets Jealous of a Dog
        

Garfield is one high-maintenance cat. He wants what he wants, and he is not afraid to make it known. When Garfield sees that a scary-looking dog has his own &#34;Beware of Dog&#34; sign, he gets green with envy. He tries to placate himself by claiming that cats don&#39;t need signs because people just know to look at cats suspiciously. However, he obviously does not believe his own lies when he slaps Jon in the face to get a sign. Given that Garfield does not hesitate to slap his owner, he proves a sign denoting his danger wouldn&#39;t exactly be wrong.





 2  &#34;Come  r&#34; 
Garfield Gets Sensitive About His Age
        

Age is a sensitive topic for many - apparently including tabby cats. When Jon is poking fun at Garfield, he takes it too far for Garfield&#39;s liking. As much as Garfield likes to make fun of Jon and Odie as well as play pranks, his reaction to Jon&#39;s gentle ribbing shows that he can dish it, but he can&#39;t take it.





 1  &#34;Hold Still&#34; 
Garfield&#39;s Nemesis Makes Jon&#39;s Life Harder
        

In another running gag, Garfield causes havok while chasing down an irritating fly. In this case, it truly doesn&#39;t seem like he&#39;s trying to attack Jon, but he also isn&#39;t exactly careful about turning his owner into collateral damage. In one of Jon&#39;s funniest injuries, he goes head first into his cereal, but the worst is kept for last, as the strip ends with Garfield preparing for a finl, gargantuan swing.
Garfield has been offering gentle humor for decades, but while the strip doesn&#39;t touch on sensitive topics, that doesn&#39;t mean its characters are safe from slapstick violence. Jon Arbuckle has been at Garfield&#39;s mercy since 1976, and hopefully will continue suffering at his paws for years to come.
