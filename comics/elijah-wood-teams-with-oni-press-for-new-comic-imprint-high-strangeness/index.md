## Literature Review

Oni Press will join forces with Elijah Wood&#39;s SpectreVision to develop a new comic imprint focused on paranormal storytelling: High Strangeness.




Oni Press&#39; future comic offerings will include a new partnership with Elijah Wood&#39;s production company, SpectreVision. This newly unveiled partnership is resulting in the creation of a new comic imprint: High Strangeness. The imprint will focus on telling paranormal stories, leaning heavily into its name and pushing the boundaries of traditional sci-fi and horror in its explorations.




Elijah Wood and Daniel Noah co-founded SpectreVision in 2010, under the name The Woodshed, before rebranding in 2013. The company produces psychological and thriller films, but has decided to branch out into the comic industry with its newest expansion. This new project, shared by Oni Press will also include Jim Perry, a podcaster known for Euphomet, which shares paranormal experiences, befitting SpectreVision&#39;s latest plans.



          

SpectreVision&#39;s previous projects include the films Toad Road (2012), LFO (2013), Cooties (2014), Open Windows (2014), Daniel Isn&#39;t Real (2019), and Archenemy (2020), among others. Several of the company&#39;s films have been nominated for or won awards at various film festivals. The latest project will continue the storytelling themes that the company has prided itself on in the past as it dives into a new multimedia future.





 SpectreVision &amp; Oni Press Will Bring Paranormal Thrills Based on the Supernatural 


          

Thus far, none of the imprint&#39;s comics have been revealed, though more news is likely to be announced soon. Currently, the project is in the early stages of announcement. SpectreVision&#39;s founders are looking forward to exploring paranormal and supernatural phenomena via comics. These experiences are described as an &#34;interconnected narrative,&#34; which could be exactly why this comic imprint is the perfect venue to explore the themes and mysteries.

High Strangeness is described as being &#34;Influenced by real, documented cases of paranormal phenomena dating back to the mid-20th century, HIGH STRANGENESS will surveil the liminal spaces where reality, hallucination, science and mythology give way to cosmic wonder and existential terror, bending perception far beyond the bounds of traditional science fiction and horror.&#34; On the upcoming project, Elijah Wood says, &#34;Comics feel uniquely suited to explore this wide-ranging spectrum of paranormal phenomena, utilizing the limitless possibilities of the medium to give shape to the often gaussian accounts of what cannot be explained through traditional means.&#34;




Daniel Noah adds, &#34;Accounts from experiences of the paranormal suggest a vast, interconnected narrative unfolding at the farthest reaches of human experience - from UFOs, to cryptid sightings, to patterns of synchronicities that point to an invisible architecture underlying our reality. As an experiencer myself, I know firsthand that the world of high strangeness can have profound implications. We&#39;re galvanized to explore this remarkable space with our partners at Oni.&#34;



 Oni Press&#39; Latest Partnership is One of Its Most Promising 
          

Oni Press has engaged in several partnerships to provide readers with thrilling new comics. However, this new cooperative endeavor could prove to be one of the most promising. With the storytelling prowess of SpectreVision and the comic publishers&#39; experience in the industry, comic readers could have some thrilling and haunting new stories to enjoy in the near future. Though no details have been revealed, the teaser art from Malachi Ward hints at an eerie future lying ahead.




Hunter Gorinson, President &amp; Publisher of Oni Press says, &#34;Over the past decade, so many members of the Oni team and greater comics community have been inspired and influenced by SpectreVision&#39;s extraordinary body of work. Together, we share a mutual fascination with the extremities of human understanding - where aliens, poltergeists, demons, fairies, and other entities all seem to extend like fingers from a hidden hand. Through the uniquely powerful lens of comic storytelling, we intend to tell an array of stories exploring these multiple manifestations, but rooted in the same common understanding: Reality is thin around the edges...and if we press hard enough in exactly the right places, it just might shatter.&#34;

High Strangeness will announce further news on December 3 at L.A. ComicCon at 12 PT in Room 304.
