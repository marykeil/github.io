# An Isekai With an Isekai New Manga Pushes Isekai to Its Breaking Point in the Best Way


## SUMMARY 



  I Got Reincarnated as a Cat, but Since I&#39;m Bored, I Play VRMMOs With Gamer Girls is an isekai manga where the protagonist is reborn as a cat and escapes into a gaming world.   The series goes beyond the title&#39;s premise, exploring the protagonist&#39;s need to communicate with his friend in the real world, which is why he is reborn in his original world.   The unique goal of reaching his friend justifies the series&#39; subversive and trendy setup, creating a fun &#34;isekai within an isekai&#34; dynamic.

## Literature Review

I Got Reincarnated as a Cat, but Since Iâ€™m Bored, I Play VRMMOs With Gamer Girls is everything this new manga&#39;s title promises and so much more.




Like most series nowadays, the outrageously long title of this new isekai manga says it all, I Got Reincarnated as a Cat, but Since I&#39;m Bored, I Play VRMMOs With Gamer Girls. It can be referred to as an isekai within an isekai because the protagonist is reborn as a cat named Nanahoshi, and then escapes into a gaming world.




          

By Amano Hisana, I Got Reincarnated as a Cat, but Since Iâ€™m Bored, I Play VRMMOs With Gamer Girls could have easily followed the same blueprint as most isekai. The protagonist Hokuto Kurokawa could have been reborn into the VRMMO world that he later plays as the cat Nanahoshi in the real world. Instead, Kuroawa gets isekai&#39;d into the same world he died in, forcing him to do the extra work of having to manually connect to a VRMMO.

Rather than being subversive just for the sake of it, the series helps readers conclude that there&#39;s more on why Kurokawa starts a new life in his own world aside from what the title conveys. He needs a way to communicate with his friend who&#39;s still alive in the real world. The fact that he is reborn in his original world is important, because there&#39;s a chance that Kurokawa can communicate with him since he&#39;s most likely still there. Similarly, the series also explains why Kurokawa is reborn as another animal beyond the fact it&#39;s trendy. A cat&#39;s inability to speak to humans complicates any chance of communication, which makes Kurokawa&#39;s goal of reaching his friend more difficult. This gives credence to the VRMMO&#39;s role in the series because it has a special feature that gives users who can&#39;t speak in the game a voice to communicate with.




Of course, all these examples only set up the series&#39; overly convoluted and ridiculous isekai premise. To be a truly effective and innovative isekai, the series would have to use these various elements (i.e. the protagonist is a human who gets isekai&#39;d into the same world, but as a cat, and tries to communicate with his friend in that same world via a VRMMO) to drive and enhance the plot. Unfortunately, only two chapters have been translated by fans thus far, so there aren&#39;t many opportunities for this. That said, there is potential in the fact that Nanahoshi can only play the VRMMO when his human owner is away, so if he has to disconnect every time she comes home, that would serve as further justification beyond the premise. The series will just have to follow through on this.

          




So, not only does I Got Reincarnated as a Cat, but Since I&#39;m Bored, I Play VRMMOs With Gamer Girls create a fun &#34;isekai within an isekai&#34; dynamic, but it provides a unique goal for the protagonist that justifies its trendy and subversive setup.
