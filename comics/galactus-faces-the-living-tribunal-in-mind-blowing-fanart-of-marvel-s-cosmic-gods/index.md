## Literature Review

In an epic new piece of fan art from BossLogic, Galactus takes on the Living Tribunal in a battle sure to destroy the Marvel Universe.




A stunning new piece of fan art pits Galactus against the Living Tribunal in a showdown between two of Marvel’s gods. The cosmic beings of the Marvel Universe exist far beyond the comprehension of mortals, working on a truly epic scale. Now, a new piece of fan art from acclaimed artist BossLogic brings to life what is sure to be a titanic struggle between two of the Marvel Universe’s two most powerful beings.




BossLogic unveiled the piece in an Instagram post. Invoking the forthcoming Secret Wars movie, BossLogic prefaced the piece by saying: “speak to my lawyers.” The fan art shows Galactus standing on an asteroid before the Living Tribunal somewhere in deep space. No context is given for the piece, but Galactus stands in a defiant pose, as if he is daring to oppose whatever pronouncement the Tribunal is about to hand down.


 

BossLogic’s piece perfectly communicates the vast size and otherworldly, cosmic nature of the two beings.


 Galactus and the Living Tribunal Opened Up a New Side of the Marvel Universe 
          




Cosmic “gods” such as Galactus and the Living Tribunal sprung from the fertile imaginations of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko during the 1960s. “The Coming of Galactus,” in which the Fantastic Four must turn back the giant planet killer, is rightfully regarded as one of Marvel’s greatest stories. Likewise, the Living Tribunal debuted around the same time, in the pages of Doctor Strange’s feature in Strange Tales. Doctor Strange seeks the Tribunal to help him stop Dormammu. Both of these characters featured designs unique for their time, and helped Galactus and Tribunal stand out among the other amazing concepts coming out of Marvel in the 1960s.


 

A potential conflict between Galactus and the Living Tribunal could devastate the universe. Both Galactus and the Living Tribunal are beings of immense power, with the ability to destroy entire worlds. When such powers come into conflict with one another, the results would be catastrophic, and could destroy half the universe. The various civilizations of the Marvel Universe would not be able to withstand the carnage such a fight could unleash. Galactus would need to consume the energies of one world after another in order to sustain his fight against the Tribunal. Once the dust settles, the Living Tribunal will stand triumphant.

While Galactus is a fundamental force of the universe, the Living Tribunal is second in power only to the One-Above-All, putting him in a power class beyond Galactus and even Eternity. Such power cannot be fathomed by human minds, but BossLogic’s new piece does an amazing job of showing what such a conflict could look like. The Tribunal towers over the already enormous Galactus, a stark reminder of the different power levels at play. The Living Tribunal does not seem moved by whatever Galactus is saying, ensuring some sort of conflict is around the corner–a battle that could easily destroy the Marvel Universe.
