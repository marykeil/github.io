## Literature Review

The battle against Sukuna in Jujutsu Kaisen takes an interesting turn as the series sacrifices a fan-favorite character to redeem its protagonist.





Summary

  Higuruma passes the torch to Yuji, giving him the power to kill Sukuna in the latest chapter of Jujutsu Kaisen.   Higuruma&#39;s fate is ambiguous, but his death opens up the possibility of increasing Yuji&#39;s chances against Sukuna.   Yuji may be able to wield the Executioner&#39;s Sword even after Higuruma&#39;s death, which could potentially end up strengthening his technique.  







The thrilling battle against Sukuna has reached a turning point as Jujutsu Kaisen kills off one of its most interesting characters to give Yuji and his new power-up a chance to shine. The latest chapter reveals fans may have to bid farewell to their beloved law-abiding sorcerer, Higuruma, as he quite literally passes the torch to Yuji, handing him the power to kill Sukuna.

Chapter #247 of Jujutsu Kaisen reveals that Higuruma has taken heavy damage from the battle against Sukuna. Intent on fulfilling his role and taking down Sukuna, Higuruma throws the Executioner&#39;s Sword to Yuji, who stabs Sukuna in the back, as Higuruma falls after taking a direct slash from Sukuna.

          

Despite the excitement and anticipation surrounding Higuruma, it appears that Yuji will be the one to fight Sukuna next. Though the chapter leaves Higuruma&#39;s fate ambiguous, it is evident that Higuruma has most likely handed Yuji his biggest power-up yet, as the Executioner&#39;s Sword is presumed to be the strongest weapon at the sorcerers&#39; disposal at present.




                  Jujutsu Kaisen Has Already Revealed Yuji&#39;s Cursed Technique   Jujutsu Kaisen may have already left all the clues to Yuji&#39;s true Cursed Technique and it may be completely different than fans expected.   


 Higuruma Leaves Sukuna&#39;s Execution to Yuji 
          

While it isn&#39;t clear whether Higuruma is dead just yet, the final panels of the chapter do not paint a hopeful picture as Higuruma falls surrounded by a massive splatter of blood. The chapter even makes a cruel callback to Nanami&#39;s death in Shibuya as Yuji is reminded of Nanami&#39;s final moments as he makes eye contact with Higuruma for what could be the very last time. Having said that, Higuruma&#39;s death opens up the possibility of increasing Yuji&#39;s chances against Sukuna.

Chapter #247 includes a peculiar piece of a conversation between Kusakabe and Higuruma right before he throws the Executioner&#39;s Sword to Yuji. The two discuss how some curses get stronger instead of weaker after death, implying that Yuji may be able to wield the Executioner&#39;s Sword for a brief time, even after Higuruma&#39;s death.




          

In fact, Higuruma&#39;s technique may even be strengthened after his demise owing to the strong connection between death and cursed energy. Higuruma may have planned to die from the very beginning of the battle, as he often mentions fulfilling his role and dying in the same capacity throughout the battle.

                  &#39;Talent Equal To Gojo&#39;: Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s Next Strongest Hero Will Shock Fans   Jujutsu Kaisen has been looking for Gojo&#39;s replacement since his death in battle against Sukuna, and an unlikely sorcerer could step up.   

Either way, it seems Jujutsu Kaisen may be finally giving Yuji a chance to face Sukuna head-on, that too with a truly terrifying power in his arsenal. While this may not be enough to redeem Yuji as the series&#39; protagonist just yet, Higuruma&#39;s death has certainly made the battle all the more unpredictable.
