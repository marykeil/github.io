# 10 Marvel Villains the Predator Would Absolutely Hunt


## SUMMARY 


 Marvel villains with high levels of insanity, such as the Green Goblin, would attract the attention of Predators due to their unpredictable behavior and potential for mayhem. 
 Predators would be drawn to hunting villains like Sabretooth, who possess similar attributes to Wolverine, such as animalistic tendencies and a healing factor. 
 Above all else, Predators would want to hunt the seemingly unkillable villains like Juggernaut and Thanos, even if they would likely lose.

## Literature Review

Given the Predator&#39;s recent conflict with Wolverine, anyone in Marvel Comics could be next, including super-villains. Here are the 10 best choices! 




One of the defining characteristics of a Predator is their complete and total apathy when it comes to the cultural politics or designations of the worlds they choose to conduct their ritualistic hunts, and the same has already proven true in Marvel Comics. Predators are hunting Wolverine in the Predator vs Wolverine series by Benjamin Percy, Ken Len Lashley, Greg Land, and Andrea Di Vito, and his status as a prominent heroic figure means nothing to them.
It doesn’t matter that Wolverine is a superhero on this planet, and has proven himself essential to its protection and survival (indeed, Wolverine has helped take down a number of detrimental threats, both as an X-Man and an Avenger), the Predator will hunt him all the same - and they’d do the same to a Marvel Comics villain any day. Here are 10 Marvel Comics villains the Predator would absolutely decide to hunt as easily as they decided to hunt Wolverine.

 10  Green Goblin’s Insanity Would Be A Fun Challenge For A Predator 
        

This image is a part of Marvel Comics&#39; &#39;Vs Predator&#39; variant cover initiative by artist Gabriele Dell&#39;Otto, depicted on the cover of Amazing Spider-Man #8. 

Green Goblin is one of the most impactful villains within Spider-Man’s cadre, a spot he cemented after killing Gwen Stacy in Amazing Spider-Man #121 and then - after faking his own death - orchestrating the entire Clone Saga, effectively tearing Spider-Man’s life apart all over again. Not only is the Green Goblin an iconic villain for Spider-Man, but he’s also an utter menace to everyone in New York City. During the height of his prominence, the Green Goblin would fly around the city on his glider, blowing stuff up with his pumpkin bombs, and causing general mayhem just for a laugh - and the Predator would undoubtedly be drawn to that level of insanity.
The inability to track logical movement while also accounting for advanced technology and explosive weaponry would make the Green Goblin a fun hunt for any Predator. Plus, the Amazing Spider-Man ‘Vs Predator’ variant cover already teased the hunt.





 9  Sabretooth’s Primal Ferocity &amp; Healing Factor Makes Him Ideal Prey 
        

It’s a safe bet that the Predators would want to hunt Sabretooth for the same general reasons they were so attracted to Wolverine in Predator vs Wolverine, as Victor Creed is nearly identical to the X-Man, though a tad more animalistic and ferocious. Indeed, Sabretooth killed his entire family over a slice of pie (as shown in X-Men: Origins - Sabretooth by Kieron Gillen and Dan Panosian), and that was just the beginning of his hyper-violent depravity.
Hunting Sabretooth would be too tempting for the Predator to ignore, even if just for the challenge of hunting someone with a healing factor right after fighting Wolverine. Plus, Sabretooth had already had a brief encounter with the Predator hunting Wolverine, so it would only make sense that he’d be next.





 8  Mystique Would Give The Predator A Master Class In Tracking 


 







Mystique is a shapeshifter, master martial artist, and weapons expert, not to mention absolutely brilliant and utterly ruthless. Proof of her ability is shown in Uncanny X-Men #177, where Wolverine launches a surprise attack against her in the first pages of the comic, and Mystique takes him down with little effort, then disappears before doing the same to the rest of the X-Men. If a Predator wanted to hunt Mystique, the experience would be a master class in tracking, with no actual conflict being guaranteed unless either Mystique wanted to take the time and fight the alien creature stalking her, or the Predator actually managed to get the jump on someone as skilled as she is.
Either way, a Predator would assuredly love to test their tracking and hunting skills on Mystique, and her aforementioned conflict with Wolverine proves she’d be a worthy adversary.





 7  Bullseye Would Make Predator’s Cloaking Device Pointless 


 







Bullseye is a villain who’s one defining feature is that he never misses his target, no matter how seemingly impossible the shot is. If he were to be hunted by a Predator, just the slight shimmer of the cloaking tech, or the brief flash of yellow eyes would be enough for him to pinpoint not only the Predator’s exact location, but also the precise placement of the perfect kill-shot. This was proven true in Bullseye: Greatest Hits #3 by Daniel Way and Steve Dillon, when Bullseye was being tracked by the Punisher (a threat not too dissimilar to a Predator), and just the tiny reflection of light off the Punisher’s white skull emblem was enough for Bullseye to throw a knife and hit him right on target.
Someone as deadly as Bullseye would be a perfect candidate for a Predator hunt, and may even require an entire team to take him down.





 6  Killmonger Is The Perfect Contender For A Hand-To-Hand Final Fight 
        

Almost every Predator hunt ends with the Yautja and its prey engaging in honor-bound hand-to-hand combat, and if the ‘prey’ in this case was Killmonger, then he’d have a major advantage given his near unparalleled combat skills. Killmonger managed to take down Black Panther while the Avenger was wearing his suit, and Erik wasn’t (shown on the opening page of Killmonger #1 by Bryan Hill and Juan Ferreyra).
Black Panther alone is easily as deadly as a Predator - if not more so - meaning Killmonger’s victory over him means he’d likely come out on top if his hypothetical fight with a Predator came to blows, making him an enticing Marvel villain for a Predator to target.





 5  Juggernaut Claims To Be Unstoppable, &amp; A Predator Would Accept That Challenge 


 







The entire purpose of the Predator species is to seek out and hunt the deadliest prey in the universe, so for a potential target on Earth - a planet already familiar to them - to claim he’s ‘unstoppable’ would absolutely grab the Predators’ collective attention. Unfortunately, it’s doubtful that any Yautja would actually be able to take down the Juggernaut, no matter how detrimental their attacks proved to be (and that includes their ‘wrist nukes’).
Even when the Juggernaut is defeated, his healing factor is magic based, and can allow him to heal even if he’s reduced to a skeleton (which happened in Juggernaut #1 by Joe Kelly and Duncan Rouleau). So, while the Predators would definitely want to hunt him, the Juggernaut is a bit out of their league.





 4  Thanos Would Be Well-Known To Predators As A Conqueror, AKA The Ultimate Prey 
        

If one thought the Juggernaut would be an enticing target based on his reputation, then Thanos would be right at the very top of the Predator’s ‘kill list’. Predators seeking out otherworldly creatures that are effectively cosmic gods is nothing new to their lore, as the Dark Horse Comics’ Fire and Stone crossover event chronicled a team of Predators hunting Engineers across the galaxy, as they wanted to find these ‘space gods’ and kill them, proving their superiority. The same logic and action would be applied to Thanos in the Marvel Universe.
Unfortunately - again, like with the Juggernaut - Thanos is way out of the Predators’ league. Even at his base level, without the Infinity Gauntlet or the Cosmic Cube, Thanos is effectively a cosmic god in ways the Engineers couldn’t even fathom, and a species of alien warriors isn’t even close to being enough to kill him (indeed, the Predators wouldn’t be the first to have tried).





 3  Carnage Is A Parasitic Alien Horrorshow, Just What Predators Are Used To 
        

Symbiotes aren’t unlike Xenomorphs in the sense that they are a parasitic alien creature that requires a host to live, and is able to mold its environment to its liking on a planetary scale. Well, what’s one alien race whose culture is essentially molded around killing such creatures? The Predator. Upon hearing about the Klyntar race, the Predators would be planning a hunt moments later, and there arguably isn’t a stronger symbiote than Carnage - something that’s effectively been cemented in the Death of the Venomverse crossover event.
Not only would the symbiote catch the eye of the Predator, and assuredly result in an epic battle, this fight would also create an opportunity for a ‘Venomized’ Predator, which would be unarguably amazing to see.





 2  Taskmaster Can Learn Anyone’s Fighting Style - What About A Predator’s? 
        

While other potential prey are skilled fighters in their own right, Taskmaster is a skilled fighter in his opponent’s own right, as he learns their technique as he’s fighting them, and then surpasses them in real time. Not only that, but Taskmaster is a brilliant strategist and weapons expert, which he proved without question when he single-handedly took down the Avengers in Avengers #195-196 by David Micheline and George Pérez. This means that his potential conflict with a Predator would absolutely end in that iconic hand-to-hand, honor-bound final fight, at which point it’s fair to say that Taskmaster would claim the victory.
This would be an interesting fight, as it’s not a guaranteed loss for the Predator like the fights against Juggernaut or Thanos, but it’d be a valiant battle that would be fun for fans to see, and even more fun for the Predator to experience.





 1  Kraven the Hunter Is A Hunt The Predator Would Regret 
        

Kraven’s Last Hunt by J.M. DeMatteis and Mike Zeck proved Kraven’s proficiency in hunting a target as elusive as Spider-Man, and succeeding (at least seemingly). The skills, tactics, and unadulterated genius that was on display in this storyline proves that, if a Predator chose to hunt Kraven, the tables would be turned on the Yautja fairly quickly. In fact, Kraven is so impressive that this particular conflict may not even end in death at all.
Predators are no strangers to taking in humans that are worthy of their clan, meaning this hypothetical hunt could very well end in Kraven the Hunter becoming Kraven the Predator, which is enough to excite any fan, and is why Kraven the Hunter is one of the 10 Marvel Comics villains the Predator would definitely hunt.
