## Literature Review

The One Sith rejected the Sith Rule of Two in the Star Wars: Legacy era, meaning there were a lot featured Sith Lords. Here are the 10 most badass! 




Star Wars: Legacy is the distant future sequel to the original adventures of Luke, Leia, and Han (including all the Legends continuations), and a stand-out aspect of this Dark Horse Comics series is the One Sith. The One Sith is the total and utter rejection of the previously upheld Sith Rule of Two, as its doctrine dictates that there be one Sith who will rule over a plethora of lesser followers.
The ideology of the One Sith gave Star Wars fans an exciting change to the franchise, one that - in many ways - kind of resets the status quo of the Old Republic’s Sith Empire. By doing so, it also allowed for the introductions of a great number of Sith all at once, without having to wait for one to fall and another to take their place (which fans of the prequel trilogy are very familiar with). But, out of them all, which members of Star Wars&#39; One Sith are the most badass?









 








 10  Darth Krayt was the Original Leader &amp; Founder of the One Sith 
First appeared (as A’Sharad Hett) in 1998’s Star Wars #10 by Timothy Truman and Rick Leonardi


 







Originally a Jedi during the Clone Wars era named A’Sharad Hett, Darth Krayt fell to the dark side and secretly built the One Sith until the time came when all his greatest threats had fallen (including the likes of the Skywalker family and even the remnants of Palpatine’s Empire), and he was free to rise up and claim the galaxy for himself. Using dark side magic and forbidden sciences, Darth Krayt managed to unnaturally elongate his life far behind his natural expiration, and he even managed to return from the grave during the events of Star Wars: Legacy.
Darth Krayt was the One Sith, not just because he founded the new Sith Empire, but because he was truly unmatched in terms of power and malignance. More than a few Jedi have fallen to the dark side (especially during the Clone Wars), but Krayt was the only one who went ahead and founded a new Sith regime with which he’d rule the galaxy - and that’s about as badass as one can be.





 9  Darth Talon was the Hand of Krayt (&amp; Even Outlived Her Master) 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #2 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema


 







Darth Talon was the Hand of Krayt - an extension of his will and perhaps the highest honor in the One Sith - and is often recognized as his most iconic apprentice who was fully committed to both Darth Krayt and the ways of the Sith as a whole. Talon’s first heartlessly badass moment had to be when she killed her master - someone she’d known her whole life - just to prove herself to Krayt. Then, Talon continued to impress during her many missions trying to kill Cade Skywalker - the descendant of Luke Skywalker - which gave fans a number of impressive lightsaber duels that only highlighted her sheer awesomeness.
Darth Talon even managed to outlive her master, as she is still out there in the Star Wars galaxy, waiting for the resurgence of the One Sith.





 8  Darth Nihil was Darth Krayt’s One Sith Successor 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #1 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

Like Darth Talon, Darth Nihil was another Hand of Krayt, only he didn’t stay that way. While, yes, he would eventually take over Krayt’s position as the One Sith (a position he still holds to this day), Krayt actually exiled Darth Nihil and even replaced him, as Nihil and Talon failed too many times in capturing and/or killing Cade Skywalker, and Krayt blamed Nihil for that failure.
This makes Nihil’s eventual ascension in the ranks that much more impressive, and truly speaks to his badass nature as an immensely powerful Sith Lord.





 7  Darth Stryfe was Darth Nihil’s Original Replacement as a Hand of Krayt 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #16 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

Darth Stryfe was the Sith who replaced Darth Nihil as Hand of Krayt, and he didn’t waste any time in proving himself as a worthy recipient of such a high honor. Indeed, Stryfe was promoted from the position of Darth Krayt’s Fist, which is reserved for only the most brutal warriors in the One Sith. As Hand, Darth Stryfe was sent to the Jedi Temple with the sole purpose of decimating it.
While Stryfe would be killed by Jedi Master Wolf Sazen during that strike on the Temple, his reputation had already been firmly cemented in Star Wars lore as a true, unadulterated badass.





 6  Darth Wyyrlok (III) was Darth Krayt’s FIRST Successor 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #1 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

The Voice of Darth Krayt, Darth Wyyrlok’s job was to be just as knowledgeable - if not more so - in the ways of the dark side than even his master. This is why Wyyrlok was the obvious choice for Krayt’s replacement following Krayt’s first apparent death (some time before his second, permanent death that would see Darth Nihil ascend the throne). Not only was his knowledge of the dark side his greatest source of power, but Darth Wyyrlok was also ruthless in his quest for power, as it was he who ‘killed’ Darth Krayt in order to take his place.
After Darth Krayt’s resurrection, however, the two dueled and Darth Wyyrlok was killed - a fitting end for a badass Sith.





 5  Darth Reave Underwent Horrific Sithspawn Mutation 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #29 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

This Sith is a definite standout, as he’s not so much a major badass because of what he’s done, but because of what happened to him. During a duel with Cade Skywalker, Darth Reave was shockingly bitten by Sithspawn that were believed to be extinct, which allowed Cade Skywalker to make his escape. Not only did the Sithspawn prevent Reave from killing Skywalker, but it also did something much more horrific (and badass): the bite mutated him.
Darth Reave’s body started to undergo disturbing mutations due to the venom of the Sithspawns’ bite as his mind was flooded with agony, prompting Darth Stryfe to put him out of his misery.





 4  Darth Havok was an Imperial Knight Who Fell to the One Sith 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #48 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

Unlike most members of the One Sith, who were kidnapped by Krayt and his early followers as children/infants and then raised in the dark side on the planet Korriban, Darth Havok sought out the dark side after having already been trained in the ways of the Force as an Imperial Knight. Imperial Knights were essentially Gray Jedi, as they practiced in the light side of the Force, but were wholly loyal to their Empire rather than to the Force itself. Havok was one such soldier, until his lust for power led him to the dark side.
Just his origin story alone makes Darth Havok one of the most badass members of the One Sith in Star Wars: Legacy, with every one of his violent escapades only adding to his personal legacy that much more.





 3  Darth Maladi Malincha was a Master in Mental Manipulation &amp; Torture 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #1 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

Darth Maladi is absolutely terrifying. A Sith scientist within the One Sith, Maladi regularly practiced horrific experimentations on basically anyone she could, and has no moral qualms about what level of pain and suffering she inflicted on her patients (she is a Sith Lord, after all). Plus, Darth Maladi was essentially the One Sith’s leading authority on torture methods and mental manipulation, making her a master interrogator that no one wants to meet.
Not only that, but Darth Maladi oversaw her own Sith assassins, and she had the authority to send them on missions of her own design - including the assassination attempt of Emperor Fel.





 2  Darth Luft was a One Sith Member Who Became a Space Pirate 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy #8 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
        

While most members of the One Sith proved their mettle during the age of the new Sith Empire under Darth Krayt, it was after Krayt’s permanent death that Darth Luft really became a badass. Upon the apparent fall of the One Sith, Darth Luft abandoned the remnant Darth Nihil tried to hold together, and decided to venture into space piracy.
Darth Luft even managed to set up a fairly lucrative operation on the decimated planet Dac while leading his own band of pirates in a manner not too dissimilar to the previous exploits of Darth Maul, or even the Knights of Ren.





 1  Darth Wredd was a One Sith Who Worked To Reinstate the Sith Rule of Two 
First appeared in Star Wars: Legacy Vol. 2 #1 by Corinna Bechko and Gabriel Hardman


 







Perhaps the most badass member of the One Sith was the same one who wanted to watch the One Sith burn and reinstate the Sith Rule of Two: Darth Wredd. Darth Wredd - like most of the One Sith - was raised in the dark side, which gave him a lot of time to ponder how he could make the order stronger. After witnessing the failings of Darth Krayt’s One Sith, Darth Wredd saw Krayt’s final death as the perfect opportunity to erase the Sith Lord’s legacy from the face of the Star Wars galaxy by killing every member of the One Sith and then ushering in a new age for the Sith Rule of Two, with himself as the one master who just needed to find his apprentice.
Darth Wredd slaughtered his fellow Sith Lords, making him one of the most terrifyingly powerful members of the One Sith in Star Wars: Legacy - and easily in the top 10 of the most badass.
