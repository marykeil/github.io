## Literature Review

Superman relies on his many powers to help him fight crime, but the iconic Arkham Asylum in Gotham removes one of his major Kryptonian powers.


Summary

  Superman&#39;s X-ray vision is completely useless in Arkham Asylum due to lead pipes, preventing him from seeing dangerous inmates.   The tight corridors and odd angles of Arkham pose a threat to Superman, as there are inmates who could seriously harm or even kill him.   Dangerous villains like Solomon Grundy and Dr. Phosphorus, who possess unique abilities, could be a serious challenge for Superman in Arkham Asylum.  





The iconic Gotham location of Arkham Asylum completely prevents Superman&#39;s X-ray vision from working. This is a major problem, considering that while most enemies in Arkham Asylum wouldn&#39;t pose a threat to Superman, there are definitely some people lurking in the Asylum who could harm the Man of Steel.




When the villain known as the Key actually breaks into Arkham Asylum, Batman and Superman arrive on the scene to stop him in Justice League #9 by Geoff Johns, Jim Lee, Scott Williams, Alex Sinclair, Pete Pantazis, Gabe Elateb, and Pat Brosseau. Superman then reveals the biggest weakness he has in DC&#39;s darkest location: he can&#39;t actually see anything with his X-ray vision in Arkham.

          

Due to the decades-old lead pipes that snake all throughout the building, Superman is completely unable to use his X-ray vision to look around and see where the inmates are. This is a major problem considering that there are several inmates inside Arkham Asylum who could do serious damage to Superman if they got the drop on him.

                  Superman&#39;s Heat Vision vs Godzilla&#39;s Atomic Breath: Which Is More Powerful, Officially Confirmed   Godzilla has come to the DC Universe and only Superman can stop him. But whose power wins out? Godzilla’s atomic breath or Superman’s heat vision?   





 Arkham Inmate Solomon Grundy Could Potentially Kill Superman 
          

Superman&#39;s powers have always struggled in Gotham due to the absurdly high amount of lead and pollution in the air. When he&#39;s in the city itself, this isn&#39;t usually a problem due to his ability to fly and the wide open skies. In Arkham Asylum, things get a bit more dangerous. The Asylum is made up of nothing but tight corridors and odd angles, and it&#39;s full of dangerous villains who would love to bring down the Man of Steel. While most of Batman&#39;s rogues gallery wouldn&#39;t pose any serious threat to Superman, this isn&#39;t true of all of them. There are several beings who are often housed in Arkham who could very seriously hurt Superman — if not outright kill him.

Arkham Asylum has dozens of dangerous people in it. Usually, these are serial killers and other non-powered people who only pose threats to other humans. But there are a few characters who could really harm Superman if they managed to sneak up on him. Solomon Grundy is an incredibly powerful individual who is a fusion of science and magic — even Batman is concerned about Grundy fighting Superman. There are other characters — like Dr. Phosphorus, who emits radiation — who have proven in the past to be a problem for Superman as well, especially if they have magic-based abilities. The Ten-Eyed Man, for example, seems to be able to completely bypass all the rules of reality in his current iteration, which would certainly let him bypass Superman&#39;s invulnerability.






 Arkham Inmate Ten-Eyed Man Could Definitely Hurt Superman 
          

Superman is incredibly powerful and can&#39;t really be harmed by conventional means. Part of what keeps Superman so free from harm is his absurdly large set of abilities, but without his X-ray vision and being trapped in a dangerous location like Arkham, Superman could be in very real danger. Without his ability to fly or the ability to see what is around each corner, Superman has a very real disadvantage inside Arkham Asylum.
