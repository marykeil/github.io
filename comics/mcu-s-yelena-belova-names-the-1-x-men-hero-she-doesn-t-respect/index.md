## Literature Review

White Widow has struck out on her own, figuring out who she is when not under someone&#39;s control. And she&#39;s decided she can&#39;t stand this X-Men hero.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for White Widow #1The White Widow Yelena Belova is finding out who she is as a person, trying new things and keeping track of her likes and dislikes, a list that includes one member of the X-Men. Yelena has been controlled by others for her entire life, but in her new series, White Widow has gone freelance, becoming an assassin mentor and consultant.




In White Widow #1, written by Sarah Gailey with art by Alessandro Miracolo, Yelena focuses on two ways to find out who she is: &#34;There are things you discover, and there are things you decide.&#34; She&#39;s made a home for herself in small town Idylhaven, and taped up a huge piece of paper, categorizing her new opinions into &#34;Love,&#34; &#34;Like,&#34; &#34;Neutral,&#34; &#34;Dislike,&#34; and &#34;Hate.&#34;

          

While she loves &#34;Hott Summers Habanero Sauce,&#34; she&#39;s less hot on its namesake, X-Men leader Scott Summers aka Cyclops.


 White Widow Clashed with Cyclops 
          




Cyclops has a long history of not getting along with other heroes. As leader of the X-Men, he&#39;s often had to do what is best for the team, even when making hard choices. Scott and Wolverine are famously at odds, whether over how to get things done, or who should be included on missions, or who Jean Grey should be smooching. He recently had two showdowns with Captain Marvel, and the upcoming Fall of the House of X series will see Cyclops on trial, facing the death penalty. However, as shown in White Widow&#39;s note, none of this has anything to do with her feelings for him. The reason Yelena dislikes Cyclops is clear - he refused to gossip with her.

This version of Yelena feels inspired by Florence Pugh&#39;s portrayal of the White Widow in Black Widow and Hawkeye. She&#39;s charming and charismatic, but very blunt. When she finds out that her favorite local coffee shop, Beans n&#39; Jeans, has been replaced by soulless corporate conglomerate Armament, she goes looking for answers from one of her neighbors. She bursts through her doors, says hello, and heads right into the interrogation. When her neighbor tries to greet her back, Yelena interrupts, &#34;Yes, I said hello, too, enough small talk.&#34; It&#39;s no wonder that Cyclops may have felt put off by her trying to chat with him. Also, as an assassin and spy, her idea of &#34;gossip&#34; may have better fallen under &#34;top-secret information about the X-Men,&#34; further explaining why he wouldn&#39;t want to talk with her.






 Yelena Spends Time With Her Best Friend: Herself 
          

Yelena has decided to be a good neighbor, frequenting local businesses, and making friends with people in her community. She&#39;s even gotten a dog, named Bint Clarton (she loves her, though Hawkeye himself is listed under &#34;Neutral.&#34;) She&#39;s also discovering how she feels about many things, ranging from hairstyles to nationalism to the Spice Girls. In White Widow #1, her list has 48 entries on it, and Yelena hopes to one day have 1,000 opinions of her own. In many ways, this is a sad reflection of how much of her life was stolen away, that she&#39;s never previously realized that she dislikes borscht and loves braids. In this comic, it&#39;s a fun way of establishing this character as she leaves her old life behind and discovers who she really is on her own. As White Widow continues, it will be exciting to see what other Marvel heroes Yelena likes (she does think Kate Bishop is funny), and who doesn&#39;t want to share good gossip like the X-Men&#39;s leader.






White Widow #1 is available now from Marvel Comics.
