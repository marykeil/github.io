## Literature Review

The Spider-Verse is a sprawling multiverse full of unique versions of Spider-Man, with this cosplay image uniting creators from across the community!




In the exciting world of comics, the Spider-Verse has become synonymous with Marvel’s Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, his countless variants spread out across the multiverse, and the vast number of friends and family members making up his heroic gang of spider-people on Earth-616. And now, in a jaw-dropping spider-studded cosplay image, the Spider-Men of the Spider-Verse come together to save the Marvel Universe!




Recently shared on Instagram by username @wens.1998, this account is a jack of all trades when it comes to being a creative talent, as they not only cosplay as Spider-Man and his various alter-selves but also photographs, designs and edits each image to practical perfection all by their lonesome.


 

Creating and wearing multiple Spider-Man outfits in the past, like Ben Reilly’s Scarlet Spider, Black Suit Spider-Man, Negative Zone Spider-Man, Spider-Man’s monstrous doppelgänger form, and more, @wens.1998 also brings iconic Spidey moments from the page to the real world, giving fans live-action comic book scenes that always impress.

                  Spider-Man Cosplay Proves His Spider-Armor MK1 Costume Is Underrated   Spider-Man&#39;s alt-costumes don&#39;t usually last long in comics, with a one-and-done 90s armored design getting a cosplay treatment that fans need to see!   





 Spider-Man&#39;s Spider-Verse Comes To Life In New Marvel Cosplay Image 
          

Gaining popularity after the original Spider-Verse comic event from 2014, by Dan Slott, Olivier Coipel, and Giuseppe Camuncoli, threw Peter Parker into a multiversal battle against vampiric villains dubbed the Inheritors, the Spider-Verse as a concept allowed for multiple versions of Spidey from across space and time to occupy to same place, and more importantly, fight for the Spider-Verse’s survival together. Birthing multiple spinoff series and two other events, including this year’s End of the Spider-Verse, this arachnid multiverse also made the jump to the silver screen in the award-winning Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse films, showing no signs of stopping in either medium.

A poster only made possible by the almost thirty other Spider-Man cosplayers tagged in the photo, it’s @wens.1998’s comment on how each of their Instagram profiles is an “alternative universe” that sells the idea of this piece even more. Showcasing each cosplayer’s impeccable ability to create comic-accurate Spider-Man designs, it&#39;s @wens.1998’s photo editing skills that turn this one into a veritable who’s who of Spidey variants. Featuring @wens.1998’s version of Marvel’s Web-Head, this photo also adds the trio of live-action movie Spider-Men, Miles Morales, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Man 2099, Fantastic Four Spider-Man, Cosmic Spider-Man, and more, solidifying the love this community has for the character and his countless iterations.






 Dozens of Cosplayers Unite In Jaw-Dropping Spider-Verse Image 
          

Unfortunately, it’ll be a while yet before fans get to see the concluding chapter of the Oscar-winning Spider-Verse trilogy in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, but thanks to @wens.1998 and the dozens of cosplayers putting in the work to make this cosplay image possible, fans at least have something to tide them over with. Spider-Man and his sprawling Spider-Verse aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, so here’s to the cosplay community and its talented members who keep creating new and exciting live-action Spidey designs that might one day get the big-screen treatment themselves!
