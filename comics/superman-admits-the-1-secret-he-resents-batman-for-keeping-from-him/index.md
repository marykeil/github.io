## Literature Review

Batman has kept a lot of secrets from his friend Superman, but Clark can’t seem to forgive one surprisingly festive part of Bruce’s past.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman - Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2!The most perplexing secret Batman&#39;s ever kept might be a bridge too far for Superman. It&#39;s the holiday season and a plague of monsters is out to destroy the world. But all the Man of Steel cares about is how his friend hid the existence of one iconic holiday figure.




In Batman - Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2 by Jeff Parker, Michele Bandini, and Trevor Hairsine, DC&#39;s heroes make their moves to stop the monsters the Krampus is unleashing on the world. The team finds the killer Draug and uses Miss Martian to bait them before Black Canary takes many of them out with a sonic scream.



          

After Black Canary&#39;s initial attack, Green Arrow assists Batman and Robin in defeating the rest of the vampiric monsters. A blur swoops in, causing Black Canary to think more Draug is attacking. But the blur is actually Superman who has a serious look on his face. But that look softens as Clark looks betrayed that Batman kept Santa Claus&#39; existence from him.

The most festive time of the year has come to the DC Universe, but evil isn&#39;t taking a holiday. A swarm of vampire-like monsters known as the Draug began haunting and killing innocent people in Gotham. Fortunately, DC&#39;s heroes were joined by someone skilled in hunting the monsters: Santa Claus. Not only is Saint Nick a real person in the DCU, but Batman once trained with him. Together, Santa and the heroes began an investigation and discover that the entity responsible for releasing the Draug is Claus&#39; old companion, the Krampus, who is set on turning Christmas into a day of darkness.

It&#39;s interesting that Superman, someone who&#39;s traveled all across the multiverse, has seemingly never met Santa Claus or even knew he was real. But then again, Santa is magic and that&#39;s always been one of Superman&#39;s classic Achilles&#39; heels. However, Clark&#39;s real issue isn&#39;t so much that Santa is real, it&#39;s that Bruce knew and worked with Santa and never told him. It&#39;s not like Bruce has been keeping it top secret, as he repeatedly told Nightwing when he was growing up about meeting Santa on Batman&#39;s travels across the world. But Bruce never relayed this information to Superman, which hurts him more than any other secret Batman&#39;s ever kept.

Batman has kept plenty of secrets from Superman over the years (like protocols to stop Clark if he ever goes rogue_. This secret isn&#39;t nearly as bad as some of Batman&#39;s others, but it cuts Superman deeper than most. Clark is totally the kind of guy who&#39;d love to know that Santa Claus exists and Bruce most certainly knows that. Batman&#39;s secret-keeping speaks to larger problems with him, namely that he doesn&#39;t know how to communicate or simply have fun with his friends. Clark isn&#39;t angry that Bruce hid this kind of information, he&#39;s just hurt Batman can&#39;t recognize how Superman would appreciate knowing Santa exists.
