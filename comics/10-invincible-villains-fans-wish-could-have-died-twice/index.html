<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are plenty of antagonists in Invincible, but only 10 are so particularly vile that fans wish the worst possible fates would come to them.</p>
<p>Warning! Major spoilers ahead for Invincible!Throughout Invincible, the titular villain faces a lot of supervillains, many of whom are downright despicable. As Mark Grayson grew as a hero, he tried to approach his opponents with empathy and understanding. Unfortunately, Invincible’s words of kindness often fell on deaf ears when facing his more sinister foes. Invincible is not a story that’s shy about killing villains, and many of Mark’s enemies meet a grisly fate. But the following 10 villains are so heinous that some fans wish they’d of died twice.</p>
<p>10  David Hiles Went After Innocent Students
First appearance: Invincible #1</p>
<p>David Hiles was one of the first villains Invincible ever encountered and he was a lot closer than Mark Grayson expected. Hiles was a teacher at Invincible and Atom Eve’s high school and he was secretly kidnapping their peers and killing them with explosives. Hiles was driven to villainy after the suicide of his son, which led him to punish teenagers he felt were wasting their youth. He attempted to kill Atom Eve and Invincible with a bomb, but he only managed to take out himself. Hiles&rsquo; unnecessary slaughter of innocent high school students may pale in comparison to other villains, but it&rsquo;s detestable behavior all the same.</p>
<p>9  Battle Beast Lived Only to Kill Others
First appearance: Invincible #19</p>
<p>Though not a Viltrumite, Battle Beast was one of the fiercest warriors in Invincible. He’s first seen working for Machine Head when Titan and Invincible tried to take down the criminal’s empire. Battle Beast easily bested the duo and nearly killed Guardians of the Globe members Bulletproof and Black Samson. Battle Beast later becomes an ally to the Coalition of Planets to defeat the Viltrum Empire. However, he perishes after an incredibly long battle with the Empire’s leader, Grand Regent Thragg. Battle Beast only desire was battle and many fans weren’t sad to see him finally meet his end.</p>
<p>8  The Sequids Tried to Destroy the Universe
First appearance: Invincible #18</p>
<p>The Sequids are a parasitic hive-mind that has destroyed countless planets across the universe. While it seemed like their days were numbered on Mars, an unlucky astronaut named Rus Livingston became host for the Sequids, and put Earth in his sights. Under the control of the Sequids, Livingston tried to take control of the planet and nearly succeeded thanks to the sheer number of Sequids in his ranks. However, Invincible put an end to the invasion by killing Livingston. While Rus was an innocent victim, the Sequids and their insidious body-jacking make them some of the series’ worst antagonists.</p>
<p>7  D.A. Sinclair Created Monsters Out of Unwilling Subjects
First appearance: Invincible #20</p>
<p>D.A. Sinclair is one of the most devious minds in Invincible. His career in villainy began with the construction of his ReAnimen, mechanized zombies he’d made out of kidnapped college students. His work sickened Invincible, who apprehended Sinclair and put an end to his reign of terror. However, Sinclair was put to work by Cecil Stedman and was forced to create more powerful ReAnimen as weapons to protect the world. Though Sinclair ultimately admits wrongdoing, the lack of punishment for his crimes makes him one of the more reviled villains Invincible ever faced.</p>
<p>6  Anissa Violated Mark in an Unforgivable Way
First appearance: Invincible #44</p>
<p>Anissa is a Viltrumite who was sent to Earth to monitor Invincible’s takeover of Earth. She routinely battled Mark, but over time became quite drawn to him. Unfortunately, this culminated in Anissa forcing herself on Mark in an attempt to have a child. Her assault left Mark traumatized, but Anissa got what she wanted and later gave birth to her and Mark’s son, Marky. Anissa later joins Mark to rebel against Thragg, but she dies when fighting his children. While she does apologize for raping Mark, some fans felt that what Anissa did to Invincible was simply unforgivable.</p>
<p>5  Dinosaurus Helped Kill Thousands of People
First appearance: Invincible #68</p>
<p>Dinosaurus was the split personality of David Anders. By all accounts, David was a normal guy, but Dinosaurus was a highly intelligent being with one goal: To save the world at all costs. Dinosaurus coordinated several attacks to ultimately help humanity. Amazingly, Invincible joins up with Dinosaurus, thinking the villain had a point. However, Dinosaurus bombed the North Pole, causing tsunamis that wind up killing thousands of people. Invincible kills his former partner, but the damage was already done. Though Dinosaurus wanted to help the world, all he succeeded in doing was racking up a huge body count.</p>
<p>4  Angstrom Levy Made It His Goal to Make Invincible Miserable
First appearance: Invincible #16</p>
<p>Angstrom Levy hates Invincible more than anyone else in the entire series. Levy was horribly mutated in an accident he blamed Mark for and spends most of his time seeking revenge on the hero. Not only does Levy torment Mark by hurling him through alternate dimensions, but he threatened the lives of Mark’s mother, brother, and eventually his wife, Atom Eve. Though he spends most of his time bitter at Mark, he ultimately decides to move on from his grudge (until he’s kidnapped by an evil variant of Mark). Though Levy ultimately pays for his actions, it’s not enough for the evil he bought into Mark’s life.</p>
<p>3  Conquest Was Invincible&rsquo;s Most Brutal Opponent
First appearance: Invincible #61</p>
<p>Few villains did as much damage to Invincible as Conquest. Conquest is one of the Viltrum Empire’s most seasoned warriors and was sent to Earth to replace Mark, who refused to prepare the Earth for a Viltrumite invasion. Conquest brutalized Mark, far more than most other villains. He also nearly killed Eve, who would have died if not for her powerful regenerative abilities. Conquest and Invincible had a rematch later on, which was even more savage and saw Mark being disemboweled. Invincible killed Conquest, but one death was simply too good for this unbelievably bloodthirsty Viltrumite.</p>
<p>2  Thragg Wanted Nothing More Than To Exterminate Mark
First appearance: Invincible #11</p>
<p>Thragg was the leader of the Viltrum Empire and as such, was a brutal and unforgiving tyrant. Not only does Thragg make it his personal goal to wipe out Earth and Omni-Man’s bloodline, but he drags his own people down to do so. When Thragg is deposed, he spends years siring an army of half-Thraxan children to help him defeat his enemies. Thragg was even willing to use his children’s bodies as weaponry to kill his opponents. Mark defeated Thragg by fighting him on the surface of the Sun, but for some, burning to death just wasn&rsquo;t enough for this villain.</p>
<p>1  Robot Betrayed Everyone Who Ever Trusted Him
First appearance: Invincible #2</p>
<p>Sadly, one of the worst and arguably most heinous villains was a close ally to Invincible. Robot was a Guardian of the Globe, but in the latter half of the series, he launched a plan to save the world by taking it under control. He slaughtered and imprisoned anyone who presented a threat to him, including his former teammates. Disgusted with Robot, Invincible left Earth but returned to stop Robot. He killed Robot’s body, but his brain was left alive and locked away. Even though Robot winds up utterly alone, some feel his actions were deserving of a much harsher punishment.
There&rsquo;s no lack of terrible villains in Invincible, but these 10 stand out as the series&rsquo; most vile.</p>
