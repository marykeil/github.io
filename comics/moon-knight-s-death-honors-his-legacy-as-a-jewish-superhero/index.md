## Literature Review

Moon Knight has long grappled with his Jewish identity, but his final moments are a significant tribute to his relationship with his faith.





Summary

  Moon Knight&#39;s final moments showcase his Jewish heritage through the recitation of the Shema, a significant prayer in Judaism.   The careful handling of Moon Knight&#39;s death and his connection to Judaism is a welcome surprise in pop culture, where Jewish elements are often underrepresented or stereotyped.   Moon Knight&#39;s recitation of the Shema before sacrificing himself emphasizes his role as a stand-out Jewish superhero and honors his legacy within the Marvel universe.  







Moon Knight&#39;s identity as a Jewish hero has been both a source of comfort to the character as well as a major point of contention at times throughout his career. Regardless, Moon Knight honors his Jewish heritage by properly reciting the Shema - one of the most important prayers in Judaism - in his final moments.

Jed MacKay and Alessandro Capuccio&#39;s Moon Knight (2021) #30 recounts Moon Knight&#39;s last minutes: betrayed by his former friend Robert Plesko (who has been orchestrating events as the Black Spectre), Moon Knight has been fatally shot and left to die. Mustering the last of his strength, Marc - with the help of his alters - crawls toward Plesko&#39;s doomsday device and, in the ultimate act of self-sacrifice, prepares to blow it up.

          

Before he does, Moon Knight recites the Shema: an important prayer in Judaism that, among other things, is to be one&#39;s final words. Thus prepared, Moon Knight detonates the device and perishes in the explosion.




                  Long Live the Knight: Marvel Trailer Teases the New Moon Knight After Marc Spector&#39;s Death   Marvel has unveiled a new trailer for Vengeance of the Moon Knight #1, giving fans a tantalizing glimpse at the new Fist of Khonshu.    


 In His Death, Moon Knight Reaffirms His Judaism 
          

The recitation of the Shema is a significant part of Jewish practice. The prayer itself is fairly simple: transliterated, it is &#34;Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad,&#34; or &#34;Hear, O Israel: Adonai is God; Adonai is one&#34; (Deuteronomy 6:4). The Shema is to be recited upon waking (during morning prayers) and before sleeping (during evening prayers), as well as being part of the final words before death.

Moon Knight&#39;s relationship with his Judaism has long been fraught. While canonically the son of a rabbi, Marc distinctly repudiated his faith during his mercenary years as well as during his service to Khonshu; from a meta-perspective, the descriptions of his father&#39;s faith and his own Judaism throughout Moon Knight (2021) have earned criticism for potentially invoking antisemitic stereotypes about Jewish passivity vs. Christian action. This is why it is such a welcome surprise to see his death handled so carefully: despite being a critical Jewish element, the Shema does not usually appear in pop culture outside of acting as a general stand-in for Jewish prayer. The moment is further compounded by the Egyptian god Khonshu&#39;s inability to save Moon Knight, with Marc finding solace in the words of his faith instead: words that affirm one god above all others.






 Moon Knight&#39;s Legacy Is That Of a Stand-Out Jewish Hero 
          

Comics in general (and Marvel in particular) have been a haven for Jewish authors and characters; despite this, it is relatively uncommon to see a character&#39;s Judaism brought up in comics, let alone to see it handled with the level of tact displayed in Moon Knight&#39;s final moments. The recitation of the Shema before death is a small moment, but one of monumental importance, and one that truly honors Moon Knight&#39;s legacy as a Jewish superhero.
