# Marvel is Laying the Seeds for Miles Morales to Get His Own Sinister Six


## SUMMARY 



  Miles Morales is facing the possibility of his villains teaming up against him, much like Peter Parker&#39;s Sinister Six.   The issue introduces low-grade villains teaming up, hinting at a potential escalation with deadlier adversaries in the future.   As Miles becomes a better superhero, his enemies are getting fed up and may resort to teaming up as their only option to take him down.

## Literature Review

Miles Morales might finally get his own version of the Sinister Six as the young Spider-Man proves he&#39;s too tough for just one villain to take down.




Warning: Spoilers for Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13!As Miles Morales gets better at his job, this Spider-Man is paving the way for his own Sinister Six. When Peter Parker got better at his job, it convinced the six worst villains in his rogues&#39; gallery at the time - Doctor Octopus, the Vulture, Mysterio, the Sandman, Electro, and Kraven the Hunter - to join forces just to destroy him.




Miles Morales is on course to receive the same treatment from his foes, as teased during Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13 by Cody Ziglar, Federico Vicentini, Bryan Valenza, and VC&#39;s Cory Petit. The prospect of his villains teaming up is first raised by one of Miles&#39; mentors. Later in the issue, it comes to fruition with a couple of low-grade villains joining forces, teasing a point where that prediction could escalate even further with more, deadlier villains involved.

          

Much like how Peter Parker being at his peak performances as Spider-Man set up his villains to plan for a worst-case scenario, Miles could be reaching the same point in his superhero career. Villains are starting to get fed up with Miles to the point that teaming up against him may be their only option.




                  &#34;He Hasn&#39;t Been There For Me&#34;: Miles Morales Drops an Insulting Bombshell That Would Break Spider-Man&#39;s Heart   Miles Morales states that Peter Parker hasn&#39;t truly been there for him in recent issues, but that doesn&#39;t mean the Spider-Men&#39;s friendship will end.   


 Villains Are Starting to Team Up Against the Newer Spider-Man 


          

As Marvel&#39;s Gang War spreads across New York City, the event makes its way to Miles Morales&#39; resident Brooklyn in this issue. Bumbler, Vespa, and Frost Pharaoh leading a horde of Ank-Colytes are the latest street criminals attempting to make their mark on the city during this time. They&#39;re not the toughest of enemies individually, but like the Sinister Six, they risk being a force to be reckoned with once they become one unit. Luckily, Miles&#39; recent training has prepared him for this exact scenario, hence why he&#39;s able to dispose of the new-fangled trio with relative ease.




During the fight, the issue flashbacks to a training session pitting Miles against teachers Colleen Wing and Misty Knight. Their double-team against Miles compels the latter to say that it isn&#39;t fair, but Misty reminds him his villains won&#39;t be fighting fair either. She adds that although Miles is a natural on his feet, it&#39;s becoming more likely that street-level criminals will want to start teaming up to take him down the more often he starts causing problems for them.



 This Spider-Man is Getting Too Good at His Job 
          

This prospect shows how a superhero improving their game can be both a blessing and a curse. Getting better at one&#39;s job is always a plus, but it becomes a net negative once getting better means the job starts to get harder. For Miles Morales, and for Peter Parker years prior, the job becomes harder once their antagonists start brainstorming new ways to defeat their opposition. Miles Morales got lucky for now that his opposition arrived in the form of easy-picking D-list villains, but when his A-List enemies decide it&#39;s time to form their own Sinister Six, the young Spider-Man is going to be in trouble.
