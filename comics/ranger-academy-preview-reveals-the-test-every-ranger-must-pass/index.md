 The Ranger Academy Cadets Are in a Race Against Time 
         

Ranger Academy centers around Sage, a lonely teen living in a small moon colony with her father. When some Ranger Academy cadets crash-land on the moon, they whisk her off to a whole new world to learn the ropes of being a Power Ranger. So far, the experience has been eye-opening - if not overwhelming - for Sage as she tries to get acclimated into Ranger culture. But as she learned in the last issue, her father was a former cadet despite being so against the thought of her attending the school.

This issue will offer Sage and company the biggest test of their academic careers yet. The first trial takes place on the planet Chromia, the home of the Bandorian monks. After Sage is made fun of for her lack of experience in space, the readers learn that the trial demands that the Ranger cadets reach Prism Peak in time or else the gate to the Zeo Chamber will close for another year. The summary for the issue also mentions that the class bully gets himself into some trouble and Sage is tasked with the choice of saving him and risking her test results, or leaving him behind.
