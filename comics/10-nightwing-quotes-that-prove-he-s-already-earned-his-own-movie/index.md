## Literature Review

Nightwing&#39;s bona fides as a DC hero are as extensive as Batman&#39;s; James Gunn&#39;s upcoming slate of DC films should put him front &amp; center.




As a new iteration of DC&#39;s cinematic Universe starts to bloom, it&#39;s time for the most eloquent member of the Bat-Family, Nightwing, to finally get his own movie. James Gunn is overseeing creative control of the pending DCU, and for all the characters who have been teased for the rebooted movieverse thus far, one character who fans continue to eagerly anticipate is Dick Grayson, Batman&#39;s original ward and sidekick.
While Nightwing&#39;s presence in live action form has been witnessed on the small screen, thanks to DCEU&#39;s Titans series, the former Boy Wonder still has yet to make it to the big screen – which is a shame, because he continues to be one of DC&#39;s most popular heroes in the comics today. It has gotten to the point that fans are starting to prefer Nightwing over Batman. Nightwing&#39;s skyrocketing acclaim is thanks in large part to his action-packed character journey, made so engaging because he&#39;s consistently written to have a way with words, which connects with readers. The 10 quotes below reflect the kind of stand-out wordsmith that Nightwing is.

Nightwing&#39;s animal form is revealed as Titans: Beast World begins, but beyond the transformation, DC promises &#34;a lot of pain to come.&#34;












 








 10  &#34;What You See In Other People ... It&#39;s Your Own Reflection.&#34; 
Nightwing (Vol 4) #14
        

Dick&#39;s way with words was pivotal in his confrontation with James &#34;Jimmy&#34; Nice, leader a supervillain support group called the Run-Offs. Jimmy claimed he wanted to hold a mirror up to people, and show them the monsters they truly are. When he tried to do this for Nightwing, Dick said he didn&#39;t see a monster in himself, just &#34;a human.&#34; Flipping the script on Nice, Dick said: &#34;What you see in other people...it&#39;s your own reflection.&#34; Despite being attacked by Jimmy, Nightwing saw Jimmy for who he really wa, a deeply disturbed man who needed help, and, as such, he wanted to talk him down rather than hurt him back.

 9  &#34;I Get It. Guns Make Things Go Faster. But What&#39;s The Damn Rush?&#34; 
Grayson #3
        

In Grayson, Dick was removed from the superhero context, and re-envisioned as Agent 37, a secret agent. The third issue of the series found him entangled with Christophe Tanner, a.k.a. the Old Gun. In their first encounter, Tanner nearly killed Grayson, and his team, despite Dick urging everyone to put their guns down. Even as a spy, he was not comfortable using guns, keeping Batman&#39;s code close to his chest. In their next encounter, Dick displayed his rhetorical skills when he urged the Old Gun to talk, instead of shooting. &#34;I get it. Guns make things go faster,&#34; Dick said. &#34;But what&#39;s the damn rush?&#34; Amazingly, Christophe agreed, saving Dick&#39;s life.
Grayson #3 was written by Tim Seeley and Tom King, with art by Mikel Janin. It first came out in 2014. 






 8  &#34;You Will Never Know If You Can Fly Unless You Take The Risk Of Falling.&#34; 
Secret Origins (Vol 2) #13
        

This issue of Secret Origins featured Dick recalling his origin story, ending with the wonderful phrase, &#34;You will never know if you can fly unless you take the risk of falling.&#34; If one line could perfectly summarize Dick Grayson&#39;s entire journey, this is among the top candidates. From the moment he decided to put on a mask for the first time, as Batman&#39;s sidekick, his entire hero career has been about soaring through obstacles, no matter how many times he has nearly fallen. Whether it be leading his own team in the Titans, to leaving Batman&#39;s side to become Nightwing, Dick has taken countless risks in his life, but rather than fall, he continues to fly.
Released in 1987, Secret Origins Vol 2 #13 was written Dan Mishkin, with art from Erik Larsen. 






 7  &#34;I Have To Admit, I Learned To Love Falling, Too.&#34; 
Nightwing (Vol 2) #142
        

In a perfect companion quote to the previous one, this one involved Nightwing reminiscing about just how much he loves taking flight. &#34;Whenever someone&#39;s asked what power they wish they had, flying is always at the top of the list,&#34; he narrated in Nightwing #142. &#34;But I have to admit. I&#39;ve learned to love falling too.&#34; While the previous quote had Dick Grayson ruminating on falling as a risk of flying, here he acknowledged that he&#39;d come to enjoy the thrill. This also reflects Grayson&#39;s mindset on failure. While not a literal fall, his one-time rift with Batman was a fall from grace – but one that ultimately led to him soaring as Nightwing.
Published in 2008, Nightwing (Vol 2) #142 was written by Peter, Tomasi and drawn by Rags Morales. 






 6  &#34;If There Is No Bruce Wayne, Then Who Is Dick Grayson The Adopted Son Of?&#34; 
Batman #600
        

It&#39;s often debated who the real Batman is: the mask or the man behind it. The crossover storylines &#34;Bruce Wayne: Murderer?&#34; and then &#34;Bruce Wayne: Fugitive&#34; highlighted just how important the human Bruce Wayne is to balancing out the hero Batman. When Batman himself started to suggest to his family that Bruce Wayne was always his real mask, Nightwing challenged that theory, begging him to answer a blunt but necessary question: &#34;If there is no Bruce Wayne, then who is Dick Grayson the adopted son of?&#34;. If anyone understands the duality of Batman and the importance of that duality, it&#39;s his first adoptive son, Dick Grayson.
Batman #600 was written by Ed Brubaker, with art by Scott McDaniel. It came out in 2002. 






 5  &#34;Batman Is Not Dead ... Batman Lives. Always.&#34; 
Batman #687
        

Batman #687 concluded the &#34;Battle for the Cowl&#34; storyline, with Dick Grayson accepting his responsibility to don the Batman identity in Bruce&#39;s absence, after the latter was presumed dead. Alfred urges Dick not to hold a funeral for Bruce, and Dick obliges, justifying the decision to the heroes who mourn Batman. As Dick explains, Batman isn&#39;t dead. With him assuming the identity, the public could not know that Batman was dead. Gotham&#39;s criminals needed to keep believing, and fearing, the Dark Knight was out there, ready to spring from any corner. By honoring Bruce&#39;s legacy in this way, keeping his symbol alive as if it was infinite, then as Dick declared: &#34;Batman lives. Always.&#34;
Released in 2009, Batman #687 was written by Judd Winick, and drawn by Ed Benes. 






 4  &#34;I&#39;m The Stuff Of Nightmares.&#34; 
Batman #416
        

Nightwing has never been afraid to acknowledge his similarities to his mentor, even at a time when he was trying to edge himself out of Batman&#39;s shadow. When a young and careless Jason Todd, the current Robin at the time, swooped down on some gang members, only to get ambushed, it was Nightwing who rescued him. For a second, the thugs believed that Batman had come charging through the roof, but instead, it was Nightwing with a warning: &#34;I may not be the gent you were expecting, but let me assure you ... like him, I&#39;m the stuff of nightmares.&#34; Well known for his charisma and leadership, it can be easy to forget how dangerous Nightwing can be.
Batman #416 was written by Jim Starlin, and drawn by Jim Aparo. It was published in 1988. 

            
 
 Nightwing Just Proved He&#39;s Become a Better Fighter Than Batman 
Nightwing is Batman&#39;s oldest student, yet the Dark Knight&#39;s actions in the Gotham War left the two at odds - and Dick Grayson came out on top. 








 3  &#34;If I&#39;m Going To Lead, I&#39;m Going To Need Your Guidance More Than Ever.&#34; 
Nightwing (Vol 4) #100
        

Nightwing #100 established a new shift in the DC Universe, where Nightwing and the Titans became the focal point of the new Dawn of DC. Nightwing and Batman had a heartwarming moment together where Nightwing expressed his willingness to have Batman&#39;s guidance while he leads the way. &#34;If I&#39;m going to lead, I&#39;m going to need your guidance more than ever,&#34; he told Bruce. This was a huge moment for a character who – particularly in his earliest days as Nightwing – tried explicitly to become his own distinct hero, outside his adopted father&#39;s shadow. Now, the character is in a position to accept his mentor&#39;s help and guidance, while still maintaining his independence.
Released in 2023, the milestone Nightwing (Vol 4) #100 was written by Tom Taylor, with artwork by Bruno Redondo, Scott McDaniel, Rick Leonardi, Eddy Barrows, Javi Fernandez, and Mikel Janin, and more. 






 2  &#34;That Is Our Legacy.&#34; 
Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7
        

Dark Crisis #7 is monumental in the character development of Nightwing, with the character especially standing out during the final battle against Deathstroke. Deathstroke goes on a rant about how the new generation of the heroes and villains don&#39;t deserve to follow in the footsteps of the old guard, nor are they worth the older heroes&#39; time. &#34;We&#39;re not following in anyone&#39;s footsteps,&#34; Nightwing intervenes, putting an end to the villain&#39;s revisionist history with a perfect summation of how heroism operates across eras. &#34;All of us walk together. No matter the world or generation, we embrace our history alongside the new to bring hope to everyone. That is our legacy!&#34;
Dark Crisis on Infinite Earths #7 was written by Joshua Williamson, with artwork by Daniel Sampere, Jack Herbert, Giuseppe Camuncoli, Cam Smith, and Rafa Sandoval. It came out in 2022. 






 1  &#34;Don&#39;t Ever Let Me Forget The Golden Rule, Alfie. The Show Must Go On.&#34; 
Batman and Robin (Vol 1) #2
        

Dick Grayson struggled to be Batman early in his time under the cowl, until Alfred explained to him that the problem wasn&#39;t unique to Dick. The problem was that Grayson was trying too hard to emulate the man who originated the role. Alfred told Dick that the secret to surpassing Batman is to make the role his own, no different from how the latest actor to play James Bond or Hamlet must find a way stand out from the rest. With his confidence rebuilt, Dick Grayson was reminded that in all things, &#34;the show must go on,&#34; a line which he repeats back to Alfred, smiling in a way that emphasizes Nightwing&#39;s reinvigorated desire to be his own hero.
Batman and Robin (Vol 1) #2 was written by Grant Morrison, and drawn by Frank Quitely. It was released in 2009.
