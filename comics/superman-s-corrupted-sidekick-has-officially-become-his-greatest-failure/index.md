## Literature Review

Fate comes full circle as Supermanâ€™s former sidekick Boy Thunder becomes the dark hero Magog, a failure the Man of Tomorrow may never get over.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22!Without a doubt, Superman&#39;s most recent failure will go down as his greatest. Clark tried his hardest to save his lost sidekick Boy Thunder from a twisted and tragic future. But even Superman can&#39;t fight fate, leaving Clark&#39;s partner to become one of the most infamous figures in DC history.




In Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 by Mark Waid and Dan Mora, Clark and Bruce are still stuck in the Kingdom Come world and face off against several variants of their allies. Unfortunately, the two are taken captive and brought to Gog, the Old God who has taken an interest in the DC Universe.

          

After Batman and Superman are thrown in prison, Boy Thunder, now calling himself Thunderman, speaks with Gog. Thunderman expresses concern that Gog&#39;s ultimate plan will fail. But Gog reminds David that they have too much at stake to not press forward. Gog bestows new power unto David, telling him that from this day, he shall be known as Magog.


 Superman&#39;s Sidekick Finally Becomes the Villain He Was Destined to Be 
          




David Sikela, a boy from an alternate Earth, came to the DC Universe after his home dimension was destroyed. Superman took David in and the lad became the Man of Steel&#39;s protege, Boy Thunder. Despite some emotional issues, Boy Thunder strongly desired to be a hero like Superman. However, after the harrowing experience of being tortured by the Joker, David was transported to Earth-22, the setting of Kingdom Come. As David grew, he changed his heroic identity to Thunderman and became a much more violent anti-hero. However, Superman traveled to Earth-22 to rescue David, only for Thunderman to angrily attack his former mentor.

It&#39;s been known for some time that David was the younger version of Magog, one of the central characters in Kingdom Come. However, Superman was determined to save David from the dark future that was in store for him. It seemed unlikely, but Magog&#39;s past wasn&#39;t explored in the original story. There was a slim chance that Superman could save his sidekick and keep him from going down the path that awaited him in Kingdom Come. Unfortunately, that&#39;s not the case and David is now condemned to live out his fate. It was bad enough that Superman couldn&#39;t save Boy Thunder before. Now Clark&#39;s failure is worse knowing the upcoming disaster fated to happen on Earth-22.






 Superman&#39;s Failure Indirectly Causes Kingdom Come&#39;s Worst Tragedy 
          

Fans who have read Kingdom Come know that Magog helps kick-start a war by trying to apprehend the Parasite, an event that winds up killing millions of people. If Superman had been able to rescue David and bring him back to the Prime DC Universe (or at the very least, help temper his rage), then David never would have done that, likely sparing Earth-22 of one of its biggest tragedies. Unfortunately, the future was set in stone the moment Superman lost David to the multiverse. Superman has a few black marks on his record, but failing to save David from becoming Magog stands out as one of his worst.

Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22 is on sale now from DC Comics.
