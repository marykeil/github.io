Warning! Contains Spoilers For Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #23!




One of the worst decisions anyone in DC Comics can make is picking a fight with Darkseid. He is one of the most powerful, dangerous villains in DC. However, rather than cause to avoid him, one often overlooked DC God is picking a fight with him for precisely this reason. The Old God Gog desires a glorious end, so he can enter Heaven, and he&#39;s seeking out Darkseid to get it.

Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #23 – by Mark Waid and Dan Mora – features the catastrophic confrontation between Gog and Darkseid. Gog wants nothing more than to force a confrontation between him and Darkseid, so that he might die a worthy death.

          

Gog doesn&#39;t have any intention of beating Darkseid in a fight, and only wants to find death from the New God. Unfortunately, dying in battle with Darkseid would be terrible for everyone, since Gog has something Darkseid wants very much: the Anti-Life Equation.




                  10 Most Important Darkseid Moments That Defined DC History &amp; Lore   One of the DC Universe&#39;s most powerful villains, Darkseid has played a role in several major stories. Here are the Lord of Apokolips&#39; biggest moments.   


 Gog Fully Intends To Die Fighting Darkseid 


          

God is a member of beings known as the Then-Gods, from the world of Urgrund. For reasons unknown, a bloody war broke out in Urgrund, with Gods fighting against Gods. Gog was the only one who advocated for peace, begging for his people to stop. This caused the others to cast Gog out into the void of space, as they continued their war. Eventually, the Then-Gods destroyed themselves, and were welcomed into Heaven due to their mighty battle. Gog now desperately seeks entry into Heaven, and he plans to get it by dying in battle against Darkseid.




Gog wants to lead the Justice League against Darkseid and be killed by this worthy foe. As long as Gog puts up a good enough fight, he believes he will be welcomed into Heaven. This explains why Gog would want to go to war against Darkseid, but Darkseid&#39;s reason for fighting Gog is far more terrifying. It&#39;s been revealed that Gog has the Anti-Life Equation, something Darkseid has long sought. Darkseid doesn&#39;t care at all about Gog&#39;s desires, but if killing Gog will get Darkseid the Anti-Life Equation, he&#39;ll happily comply, and destroy Gog.



 Darkseid Has Arrived To Confront Gog 


          

Gog and Darkseid are both incredibly powerful Gods in their own right, and they now have the perfect reason to fight one another. Gog wants nothing more than to die in a blaze of glory, and Gog also has the one thing that Darkseid has been seeking for years. There&#39;s no possible way that Darkseid can lose this fight; instead, he stands to gain absolutely everything, which is why DC Comics&#39; heroes have the impossible task of trying to prevent Darkseid and Gog from fighting.
