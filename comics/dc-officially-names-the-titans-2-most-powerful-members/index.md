## Literature Review

As “Beast World” rages on, two Titans are recognized for their strengths. But a new development in the unfolding chaos hints at the danger they’re in.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World #2!When it comes to powerhouses in the Titans, two members stand out above the rest. The younger generation of heroes are dealing with their first worldwide calamity since stepping up to replace the Justice League. As animal hybrids are turning savage across the Earth, two of the strongest Titans are in the most danger.




In Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis, the world is under attack by Beast Boy, who has lost his mind and is sending out spores across Earth. All over the globe, cities are falling as animal hybrids run wild. After discovering a transformed Black Adam is destroying Kahndaq, Oracle sends Donna Troy and Starfire to stop him.

          

Meanwhile, after Batman is infected, Nightwing realizes that the spores instinctively move to stronger hosts and communicates his discovery to Oracle. In turn, she relays that information to Starfire and Donna and cautions them to not get infected, lest they become &#34;the biggest problems&#34; they have.


 Starfire and Donna Troy are the Titans&#39; Most Powerful Members 
          




The Titans took on a lot of responsibility when they became the leading superhero team in the DC Universe. But they weren&#39;t prepared when a monster known as the Necrostar attacked the Earth. After discovering the Necrostar was vulnerable to Starro the Conqueror, Beast Boy stepped up and went beyond what his powers were capable of. He became a Starro-like being and successfully repelled the invading alien. Unfortunately, the victory was short-lived as Amanda Waller sent the mysterious Doctor Hate to mind-wipe Beast Boy. Now the hero is stuck in his form and is unleashing spores that are turning innocent people into animal monsters.

To the Titans&#39; credit, they&#39;ve got a lot of powerful members in their organization like Wally West, arguably the fastest member of the Flash Family, and Cyborg, a tech wizard powered by a Mother Box. Even Beast Boy showed how powerful he&#39;s grown by turning into his &#39;Garro&#39; form. But Donna Troy is an Amazon and they&#39;re some of the finest warriors in the DCU. Not to mention Starfire can project heat as strong as the sun. Out of all the Titans&#39; members, it makes sense that Starfire and Donna are considered the most powerful. But that designation paints a dangerous target on their backs.






 Donna Troy and Starfire are Most At Risk in &#34;Beast World&#34; 
          

Beast Boy&#39;s spores are opportunistic parasites that root out and convert the strongest people in the world. Not only does this create an even more chaotic situation, it distracts the heroes from dealing with the root cause of the spores: Garro. As Oracle points out, the team can&#39;t afford to lose either Donna or Starfire right now. Heroes all over the world are running wild and the only shot they have is by keeping the Titans on top of their game. If either of the most powerful heroes is turned, then the Titans will have to divert all their attention to stopping their friends rather than ending the nightmare of &#34;Beast World&#34;.

Titans: Beast World #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
