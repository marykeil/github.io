## Literature Review

The Arkham Knight is a Batman villain who is loved by some and hated by others, but one thing everyone can agree on is that this cosplay is badass.




Arkham Knight stands as one of DC&#39;s most polarizing villains, eliciting either fervent disdain or ardent admiration from fans since making his debut in the Batman: Arkham Knight game and comics. Yet, a dedicated enthusiast has undertaken the task of commanding respect for this antagonist with a cosplay so remarkable that it leaves fans in awe, no matter their previous opinions of the character.




SupermanFitt has taken Instagram by storm with his remarkable portrayal of Arkham Knight through a series of captivating pictures showcasing his impeccable cosplay. The intricately crafted suit exudes a realism that suggests it could withstand a showdown with Batman himself.


 

In a standout second picture (featured below), digital artist Ryan Sims enhances the cosplay by adding stunning edits to it. Sims&#39; skilled touch brings the Arkham Knight to life, making the eye slits of the helmet glow and infusing a dynamic element by depicting the knight&#39;s guns emitting smoke as if they had just been fired in a battle against an opponent that won&#39;t be getting back up again.


 Cosplayer Brings to Life Jason Todd’s Version of Arkham Knight (Not Astrid Arkham’s) 

 




Despite two characters adopting the Arkham Knight moniker, it&#39;s clear that SupermanFitt is embodying Jason Todd&#39;s version, given the tags featured in his post and the visual parallels. In the games and comics, Jason Todd, Batman&#39;s second Robin, assumes the identity of Arkham Knight after enduring torture and being presumed killed by the Joker, only to resurface with a vengeful determination to destroy his former mentor. Notably, another character in the DC universe, Astrid Arkham, the daughter of Jeremiah Arkham, also embraced the same codename. Astrid assumed the alias of the Arkham Knight and founded the Order of the Sun, a cult with the singular mission of obliterating Batman.



Astrid Arkham’s first appearance was in Detective Comics #1004 by Peter Tomasi and Doug Mahnke.




Astrid&#39;s rendition of the Arkham Knight served as redemption for those who held disdain for Jason&#39;s iteration. However, SupermanFitt&#39;s portrayal has now officially redeemed Jason&#39;s Arkham Knight in the eyes of many, as it&#39;s hard to harbor animosity toward a character exuding such undeniable badassery. Whether fans were already enamored with this version or had reservations, there&#39;s no denying this tribute is epic. The cosplay itself is a masterpiece of detail and professionalism, inviting fans to immerse themselves in its intricacies for hours. Notably, the scuff marks add an authentic touch, creating the appearance of a suit worn in countless intense battles, further enhancing the overall authenticity of the portrayal.




                  Arkham Knight&#39;s Batman Officially Gets the Downer Ending the Game Needed   A recent trip through the multiverse reveals what happened to Batman after the conclusion of the Arkham game series, and it&#39;s pretty dark.   



 Hey, Arkham Knight! Where’s Deathstroke and Scarecrow? 

 

SupermanFitt&#39;s Arkham Knight cosplay sets the gold standard for the art form—exceptional in every aspect. The suit&#39;s impeccable quality, pristine weapons, and the uncanny alignment of poses and countenance with Jason&#39;s Arkham Knight make it almost conceivable that Jason himself might be concealed beneath the mask. Yet, there&#39;s a singular factor that could elevate this cosplay to unparalleled heights: reuniting the Batman: Arkham Knight baddies. Imagining Dr. Jonathan Crane, Slade Wilson, and Jason Todd coming together in a cosplay reunion for the ultimate Batman: Arkham Knight tribute would undoubtedly be a fandom dream, adding an extra layer of excitement to an already phenomenal portrayal.
