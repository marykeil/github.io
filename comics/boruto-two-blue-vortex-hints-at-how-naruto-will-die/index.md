## Literature Review

Naruto is in more danger than ever, with Boruto: Two Blue Vortex&#39;s latest chapter revealing that he is being targeted by the new main villain.




Warning: spoilers for Boruto: Two Blue Vortex chapter 5.




It was assumed that the fate of Naruto wouldn&#39;t result in death when Kawaki sealed him away, but the latest chapter of Boruto: Two Blue Vortex shows that the seventh Hokage is still in grave danger. This chapter had many explosive revelations, but Naruto still being targeted was by far the biggest.

Chapter #5 picked up where the previous one left off, where the Ten-Tails Grimes became sentient beings and made the extremely powerful Boruto retreat. With thoughts, feelings, and personalities, each one of the Grimes decides on a target to consume their chakra and kill them.

          

The leader of the Grimes, Jura, has decided to seek out Naruto Uzumaki and devour his chakra, thereby killing him. Once thought to no longer be relevant to the story, this chapter just brought him back into the fold.




                  How Old is the Cast of Naruto in Boruto?   From a child orphan to Seventh Hokage, until now itâ€™s been hard to track the age of Naruto and the other members of the Old Guard in the new series.   


 Naruto Is In Danger Again 
          

After being sealed alongside his wife Hinata by Kawaki in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations chapter #77, Naruto was completely removed from the plot, being stuck in a dimension where time doesn&#39;t move. This set the stage for Boruto to take over, however, it seems like Naruto could make his appearance again after Jura, the leader of the new villain group, declares that he wishes to kill Naruto and take his chakra. This turn of events shows that Naruto is still in huge danger despite Kawaki&#39;s best efforts to protect him, and with him being weaker than ever, there is a huge possibility that he might die.




This twist forces readers to ask who exactly is Juro is, and although there is virtually nothing known about him and whose chakra was used to create this particular sentient Divine Tree, fans can at least piece together some information regarding his previous connection to Naruto. This is because each of the Grimes targeted someone they had a connection with: Sasuke&#39;s Grime targeting Sarada, Bug&#39;s Grime targeting Eida, and Moegi&#39;s Grime targeting Konohamaru. The Grimes also bears a striking resemblance to their host, and Jura looks a lot like Kawaki and Jigen, who both have a strong connection with Naruto.



 Boruto&#39;s New Big Villain Could Have Been Born From Kawaki Or Jigen 
          

There isn&#39;t much known about the villain or even what he plans to do in Naruto, but Jura&#39;s look and mannerisms are both reminding of Kawaki, and in smaller measure of Jigen. As Kawaki has not been devoured by a Claw Grime, it remains to be seen how the Ten Tails absorbed his chakra. What is certain is that Boruto and Kawaki will have to put aside their differences to protect their father. With an exciting battle that is about to ensue, Boruto&#39;s latest chapter has just set the series on a path that will see a partnership between mortal enemies to take down Boruto: Two Blue Vortex&#39;s strongest villain yet.
