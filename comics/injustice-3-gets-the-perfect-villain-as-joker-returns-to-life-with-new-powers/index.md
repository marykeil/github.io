## Literature Review

The Injustice franchise is one of DC&#39;s best alternate universes, and Joker&#39;s return just gave it the new lease on life it needs.




For years now, fans of the Injustice comics and games have been hoping for the announcement of a new entry in the franchise - and as the Joker is resurrected, the theoretical Injustice 3 finally has a worthy villain to follow the corrupted Superman and alien conqueror Brainiac.




In the recent Batman #135 by Chip Zdarsky, Mike Hawthorne, Jorge Jimenez, Mikel Janin, Adriano Di Benedetto, Tomeu Morey, Romulo Fajardo, and Clayton Cowles, DC&#39;s main-continuity Batman embarks on a multiversal adventure. In this story, the villain Darwin Halliday - aka the Red Mask - charges from reality to reality, resurrecting or empowering every version of the Joker. The Jokers return with blazing red eyes and new supernatural powers that haven&#39;t yet been fully explored.

          

Fans see the Joker return in the world of Michael Keaton&#39;s movie Batman, Adam West&#39;s TV Caped Crusader, and the Arkhamverse games&#39; Dark Knight. Near the end of the chase, the Batman of Injustice finally appears, confirming that the much-loved universe just got its Joker back. That&#39;s an even bigger deal than other realities, given it was Joker&#39;s death that tore this world apart.

The universe of Injustice sees Superman turn into a dictator after Joker tricks him into killing Lois Lane and simultaneously setting off a bomb that destroys Metropolis. Superman responds by killing the Joker and this drives a wedge between him and Batman. Superman then goes on and takes over the world, intending to enforce his sense of justice on everyone to prevent a criminal like Joker from ever existing again, while Batman founds a resistance movement to stop his regime. This war between the two former friends lasts half a decade and causes dozens of deaths on both sides. The story plays out in the Injustice: Gods Among Us and Injustice 2 games, as well as multiple comic tie-ins and prequels fleshing out the war between Batman and Superman&#39;s forces year by year.




Despite the extensive story that already exists, Injustice&#39;s narrative isn&#39;t over - Injustice 2 sees Batman and Superman clash, but the Man of Steel is neither killed nor redeemed in the aftermath of Brainiac&#39;s attack on Earth. Recent comics have revisited the Injustice universe, however only in the time period before the first game. While there&#39;s likely going to be a third Injustice game eventually, no-one knows when it will arrive, however Joker&#39;s resurrection means it needs to happen.

The Joker is the reason the Injustice universe went so dark so fast, but he never really got to enjoy what he created. While a Joker from another universe did end up in the Injustice universe, it wasn&#39;t his actions that caused Superman&#39;s fall from grace. Given that Injustice&#39;s reality only gets a minor appearance in Batman #135, it would seem unusual for DC to bring back the franchise&#39;s Joker without a plan to use him, suggesting some kind of Injustice project is on the horizon.




Given the Injustice fighting games pit dozens of DC heroes and villains against each other, they need a major villain to revolve around, and a resurrected Joker (possibly with demonic powers) fits the bill - especially since Injustice&#39;s Superman would fight his way out of Hell itself to stop the villain returning. For now, there are no official plans for more Injustice stories, but the return of Joker is an unavoidably game-changing event in the franchise, giving fans a major reason to expect more news in the near future...
