# Green Arrow Officially Replaces Batman as DC s Anti-Justice League Contingency Plan


## SUMMARY 



  Green Arrow takes a page out of Batman&#39;s book by spying on his fellow Justice League members to uncover the truth behind their disbandment.   Oliver&#39;s son questions the wisdom of spying, but Oliver is determined to uncover potential threats and doesn&#39;t buy the League&#39;s voluntary disbandment.   Like Batman&#39;s Brother Eye, Oliver&#39;s surveillance could lead to severe consequences if the League members are uncompromised and discover the spying, potentially alienating Oliver from his friends.

## Literature Review

Holy paranoia, Batman! It looks like Green Arrow is officially replacing the Caped Crusader as DC&#39;s Anti-Justice League Contingency Plan.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Green Arrow #7!Batman is notorious in the DCU for his Justice League Contingency Plan, and it now looks like Green Arrow is taking a page out of Bruce&#39;s book, devising his own strategy to monitor and potentially neutralize his fellow League members. Despite Oliver&#39;s noble intentions and sound reasoning, his actions could result in severe consequences.




Joshua Williamson, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Trevor Hairsine&#39;s Green Arrow #7 sees Green Arrow&#39;s triumphant return to Earth-0 after his time-traveling odyssey. Anticipating a warm reception or at least some acknowledgment from his fellow heroes of his return, Oliver is left in shock to discover the Justice League has disbanded during his absence.

          

Green Arrow is instantly suspicious about the League&#39;s dissolution, firmly holding onto the belief that things are not as they seem. In response, Oliver begins spying on his fellow heroes and friends to uncover the nefarious forces that he believes may have influenced the Justice League&#39;s disbandment.


 Green Arrow Builds His Own Version of Batman’s Brother Eye 
          




In the pages of Green Arrow #7, Oliver embarks on a quest to unravel the mystery surrounding the disbandment of the premier hero team. After tracking down each former League member and probing into the reasons for the dissolution, Green Arrow returns to his hideout. There, alongside his son, Connor Hawke, who has been monitoring the unfolding conversations, they reach a consensus that everyone appears to be acting relatively normal. Despite this apparent normalcy, Oliver maintains a deep-seated disbelief that the Justice League would disband voluntarily. Determined to uncover the truth, he resolves to persist in monitoring their fellow heroes.

Connor questions his dad about the wisdom of spying on the Justice League. Oliver responds, “I don’t like it either, but we need to be sure, son. Disbanding the Justice League? I don’t buy it.” The uneasy decision to monitor the League echoes Batman&#39;s Brother Eye, an all-seeing artificial intelligence orbiting Earth, initially created by Bruce to assuage his distrust of the other heroes. Consequently, it appears that Green Arrow has taken on the spy-master mantle, replacing Batman. Driven by a determination to uncover potential threats, Oliver is prepared to resort to surveillance, even if it means betraying the trust of his friends.




                  DC&#39;s Loneliest Hero: 1 Justice League Member Admits They Regret Never Having a Sidekick   The Justice League&#39;s loneliest hero admits their regret of never having kids or a sidekick, revealing an extremely rare show of vulnerability.   



 Green Arrow Spying on the Justice League Could Lead to Severe Consequences 
          

Up until now, Batman stood as the sole League member who harbored such deep distrust in his fellow heroes as to resort to spying on them. Despite Oliver&#39;s valid reasoning, the act of monitoring his friends is not without potential consequences. If it turns out that the League members are uncompromised, and Oliver has been conducting surveillance without their knowledge, it could result in inciting the anger of his fellow heroes and a breakdown of trust between Oliver and his friends. Much like what happened when the League discovered Batman&#39;s secret surveillance and contingency plans. Hence, Green Arrow finds himself in a precarious position.
