## Literature Review

General Zod is one of Superman&#39;s most dangerous enemies, and now that he&#39;s gotten everything he&#39;s ever wanted, he&#39;s begun building an army to keep it.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Action Comics #1060!




Superman&#39;s most powerful nemesis, General Zod, is returning once more, according to previews of upcoming issues of Action Comics. The Kryptonian warlord has been a perennial threat to the Man of Steel and his adopted homeworld of Earth – and now he might prove to be too strong for Superman to handle.

AIPT shared preview pages for Action Comics #1060 story &#34;Past is Prologue&#34; – by Joe Casey, Dan McDaid, and John Kalisz – which will explore General Zod&#39;s new army, and his larger plans. Previews depict Zod arguing with the leader of the United Planets. Ever since General Zod began leading the planet of New Kandor, he&#39;s taken an isolationist stance and kept his activities hidden.



          

The fact Zod seems to be hiding something worries the representatives from the United Planets, and they press him for answers. While Zod doesn&#39;t reveal what he&#39;s doing, readers get to discover that he&#39;s created an army of new Kryptonians. 




                  Superman&#39;s New Kryptonian Enemy Makes General Zod Look Pathetic   Superman&#39;s battles with his enemies are always more interesting with a moral conflict, and Kryl-Ux far outpaces General Zod in his righteousness.   


 General Zod Is Creating A New Kryptonian Army 
         

General Zod has always been one of Superman&#39;s more dangerous enemies. Zod is a trained military soldier, a member of Krypton&#39;s military guild who rose to the rank of general. When the City of Kandor was restored, and all the Kryptonians were released on Earth, it was General Zod who took control of the situation, doing his best to lead his people, with the help of Superman. Zod&#39;s end goal has always been the restoration of Krypton and its people, and he couldn&#39;t care less about how many planets or people he needs to destroy to achieve this, which is what makes him so dangerous.




Part of keeping the peace with General Zod included giving him his own planet, which he could try to restore the Kryptonian people on. Zod has lived on New Kandor with his wife and child for a long time, and readers haven&#39;t really seen much of him lately. However, now it seems that Zod will once more be a major force in the DC Universe, as the preview for Action Comics #1060 features Zod seemingly genetically engineering new Kryptonians for his planet. At the same time, his son, Lor-Zod, seems to be training the planet natives to work as foot soldiers for the Kryptonians.



 General Zod Appears Set To Come Back In A Major Way 


          

Kryptonians are feared throughout the universe due to their absurd levels of power. Their strength is so terrifying that Krypton banned all space travel, partly due to religious reasons, and partly for the safety of everyone else. It&#39;s unlikely that General Zod will keep those old rules intact if he manages to create a new army of Kryptonians, and as a result, nowhere in the universe will be safe. Zod has always wanted Kryptonian supremacy above all else, and now it&#39;s very likely that General Zod will be getting an army not even Superman will be able to easily stand up to.






Action Comics #1060 will be available December 12, 2023 from DC Comics.
