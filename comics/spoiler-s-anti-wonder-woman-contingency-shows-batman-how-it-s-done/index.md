## Literature Review

Someone in the DC Universe has finally come up with a contingency plan for Wonder Woman that works, something even Batman has yet to do. 




Warning: Spoilers for Birds of Prey #4!Black Canary of the Birds of Prey has done what Batman couldn&#39;t: come up with a contingency plan for Wonder Woman that actually works. Batman has struggled in the past to figure out a plan to stop Wonder Woman in a worst-case scenario. The closest Batman had to a contingency plan for Wonder Woman was disrespectful to her culture, and worse than that, wasn&#39;t even successful in his attempt.




Black Canary comes up with a smarter, more successful attempt in Birds of Prey #4 by Kelly Thompson, Leonardo Romero, Jordie Bellaire, Clayton Cowles, Marie Javins, and Ben Abernathy. Romero and Bellaire&#39;s cover art, along with a preview of the issue, can be found below. Birds of Prey #4 officially goes on sale on December 5.

         

Ever since the very start of the series, Black Canary has actually been planning out the proper way to attack Wonder Woman. As this issue goes to show, Black Canary&#39;s method of taking down Wonder Woman proves far more effective than anything Batman has previously attempted in contingency plans of his own.


 Black Canary Has a Contingency Plan for Wonder Woman 
          




Dinah&#39;s sister, Cynthia Lance, is currently a prisoner of Themyscira. Dating back to the first issue, Black Canary has been slowly building herself a team and a plan to get on Themyscira grounds to get her sister back. She acquires the help of Cassandra Cain, Big Barda, Zealot, and Harley Quinn to retrieve her adopted sister from the Amazon island, as Meridian (Maps from the future) foretells that the Amazons could accidentally bring about the end of the world if Sin isn&#39;t rescued.

In Birds of Prey #4, the plan finally comes into play. They get Sin back, but before they know it, they have to fight their way through Amazons and, most importantly, Wonder Woman. A part of Black Canary&#39;s plan calls for her to bring two warriors who are capable of pushing Diana to the limit, in the form of Lady Zannah aka Zealot and Big Barda, the latter of whom especially can be seen nearly pummeling Diana into the ground. In addition, all the Birds are equipped with custom weaponry in their arsenal to make escaping all the more possible.






 Black Canary is Just as Good a Strategist as Batman 


          

Looking back at Batman&#39;s aforementioned contingency plan for Wonder Woman, all it did was make her mad and ensure that Diana was ready to give Bruce a bigger beating than she would have given him otherwise. Meanwhile, Black Canary goes into her plan far smarter than Bruce does. Black Canary has made it clear in past issues that she does not want to kill Wonder Woman or any of the Amazons, but merely to (at best) distract them long enough to allow her and her sister to escape the island. Black Canary&#39;s plan of having two warriors by her side who can physically test Wonder Woman is the best way to distract and hold back Diana.



Birds of Prey #4 goes on sale from DC Comics on December 5.
