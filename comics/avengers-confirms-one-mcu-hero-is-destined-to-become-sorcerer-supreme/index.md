# Avengers Confirms One MCU Hero Is Destined to Become Sorcerer Supreme


## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Strange lost the title of Sorcerer Supreme in the MCU, and it&#39;s likely that Clea will claim the title in the future.   Doom Supreme maqkes Clea&#39;s case, having killed multiple variants of Sorcerer Supremes, including Stranges, Agamottos, and Cleas.   Clea is not only a standard and fitting choice for the next Sorcerer Supreme, but is officially a multiversal constant in comic canon.

## Literature Review

Doctor Strange is the most recognizable Sorcerer Supreme, but the comics have confirmed which Marvel character should take the title in the MCU. 




While Doctor Strange is the one person to bear the title of Marvel&#39;s Sorcerer Supreme in the MCU, there is one other magic user who is officially destined to claim the title for themselves. And with the Avengers comics confirming they&#39;re a perfect fit for the role, there&#39;s no reason the Marvel movies shouldn&#39;t do the same.




Doctor Stephen Strange&#39;s origin story is the same in both the comics and the MCU, healing from tragedy to master sorcery. But unlike the comics, Doctor Strange lost the title of Sorcerer Supreme to Wong (Benedict Wong) in the MCU, after he fell victim to Thanos’ life-eliminating Infinity Snap. And even if he gets the title back, it’s more than likely he’ll lose it yet again to someone who just so happens to have recently made their MCU debut.

          

In Avengers Assemble: Alpha #1 by Jason Aaron, Bryan Hitch, Andrew Currie, and Alex Sinclair, the Avengers face off against &#39;Doom Supreme.&#39; Doom Supreme is a version of Doctor Doom who has traveled to different universes, absorbing the power of his variants while also stringing together a team of the most powerful super-villains in the multiverse. During his villainous travels, Doom Supreme has witnessed nearly every conceivable version of every single superhero in the issue. According to Doom, the vast majority of sorcerers who have claimed the title of Sorcerer Supreme are consistently three people: Doctor Strange, Agamotto, and Clea.

 Clea is as Much A &#39;True&#39; Sorcerer Supreme as Doctor Strange 
          

Doom Supreme casually tells Agamotto (as he’s killing him) that he likes to murder Sorcerer Supremes in horrific ways that are specific to them as people, and he names off Stranges, Agamottos, and Cleas as the top three Sorcerer Supremes he kills most often. The idea that Clea could take up the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme is not a new one, as she recently filled the role following the Death of Doctor Strange story arc. While that may have been shocking for some in-universe entities, this Avengers issue confirms that Clea being Sorcerer Supreme is not only a normal occurrence, but is nearly a multiversal constant.

Given how often Doom Supreme comes across Cleas who have become Sorcerer Supremes throughout the multiverse, it is more than likely she will fill that role in the future of the MCU (following her recent debut in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness) just as she has done so many times in the comics–something many fans may not have believed if not for the information given in this Avengers issue.
