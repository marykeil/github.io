## Literature Review

A new What If...? series is giving heroes like She-Hulk, Moon Knight and Wolverine their own official symbiote forms in a rewrite of Venom&#39;s origins.




Iconic Marvel heroes like She-Hulk, Moon Knight and Wolverine have unveiled their official Venom forms in a new series that will rewrite the symbiote&#39;s history. Venom has continued to be one of Marvel&#39;s most popular characters ever since he first debuted in The Amazing Spider-Man #299 and #300. His vengeful personality tied to Eddie Brock made him a fan-favorite for years, turning him from a full villain into one of Marvel&#39;s most defined antiheroes. However, a new series is looking to redefine the symbiote&#39;s classic origins as he finds himself coming face-to-face with some of Marvel&#39;s most notable heroes.




According to Marvel, What If...? Venom is a brand-new series by Jeremy Holt, Jesús Hervás, Tadam Gyadu, Manuel Garcia and Diogenes Neves that will give fans a glimpse into how things would change if the symbiote bonded with other Marvel heroes after being rejected by Spider-Man. Each exciting issue of this limited series will see the Venom symbiote &#34;be given to the likes of She-Hulk, Wolverine, Doctor Strange, Loki and Moon Knight.&#34; The first issue&#39;s cover showcases the five variants being brought together into one Venomized form.



          

&#34;Having the opportunity to play within the Venom sandbox is cool. Having the opportunity to bond five iconic heroes to the alien parasite is cooler,&#34; Holt said. &#34;In doing so within the What If...? concept, I’ve had an absolute blast crafting a linear revisionist history that’s provided me the latitude to introduce distinct versions of the anti-hero that we’ve all come to love.&#34;





 Venom Finds New Hosts Among Heroes Like She-Hulk 
         

As part of the What If...? franchise, each gripping issue revolves around Venom, giving fans a glimpse at what would happen if the symbiote latched itself onto a different hero instead of Eddie Brock. The first issue&#39;s artwork by Jesús Hervás shows that She-Hulk is first out the gate as she merges with Venom. Joining forces with a member of the Hulk family is a perfect way to kick off this series, as the destruction they could cause together makes them more powerful than fans could ever imagine.



 New Venomized Designs Show Epic Potential for Marvel&#39;s Heroes 
         

Along with a look at She-Hulk&#39;s first outing with the Venom symbiote, Marvel also supplied a series of designs that are set to be featured throughout the limited run that are sure to get fans excited. She-Hulk&#39;s new Venomized look is an interesting one as it appears that Venom&#39;s features have replaced her human face while retaining her green skin. Wolverine&#39;s redesign is much more pronounced, though, with monstrous claws and symbiote flares leaking around the edges to give it a cooler look.




Venomized Moon Knight enhances the mystery of his character. Both Moon Knight and Mr. Knight get completely new looks, hinting that Venom is tethered to all of Marc Spector&#39;s personalities. Then there&#39;s Doctor Strange, who undoubtedly has the best appearance of the bunch. The symbiote cloaks the Sorcerer Supreme in black, retracting from his head like a Venus Fly Trap to unveil his face. These new designs are absolutely incredible and could open up potential new stories in Marvel&#39;s multiverse should fans enjoy their debut stories.

The first issue of What If...? Venom is expected to hit comics stands on February 28, 2024. Last year was a huge year for fans of Venom, with the Summer of Symbiotes event and Death of the Venomverse completely disrupting the Marvel universe as Carnage defeated the King in Black. Now, it looks like 2024 is going to have even more in store for fans of the chaotic symbiote, as Venom finds news hosts in She-Hulk, Wolverine and Moon Knight across the multiverse.
