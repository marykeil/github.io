Summary

  The Justice League has fallen to Garro&#39;s spores, leaving the Titans to take control in DC&#39;s new era.   Amanda Waller refuses to acknowledge the shifting generational tides and tries to maintain old power structures.   The Titans must show that they have surpassed their mentors and take charge in the Beast World event.  







With Beast Boy now the mindless &#34;Garro the Conqueror,&#34; the Titans find themselves locked in the conflict of a lifetime. But the fight isn&#39;t between the Titans and Beast Boy; rather, it&#39;s a struggle for control of DC&#39;s new era, as the Justice League falls to Garro&#39;s beast spores — and falls from prominence in the DC Universe.

Although the assault by the Necrostar has been successfully halted, Titans: Beast World #2 by Tom Taylor and Ivan Reis shows the true cost of the conflict as Garro and his spores wreak havoc among the heroes of Earth, transforming them into powerful beasts. Powerhouses like Black Adam and Power Girl fall under Garro&#39;s control in short order, and Batman is the next to succumb. While the Titans do their best to halt the tide of infected heroes, Amanda Waller visits the President in her latest bid for power.

          




In pressuring the President, Waller hammers home an important point: &#34;We&#39;re not dealing with the Justice League. They have stepped aside.&#34; She is also quick to disparage the Titans by asking the president an extremely pointed question: &#34;Do you really want the planet in the hands of a group of twenty-somethings?&#34;

                  Justice Titans: DC&#39;s Absolute Strongest Justice League was a Perfect Fusion of 2 Teams   The DC Universe is full of powerful characters, but DC&#39;s strongest team is a fusion of two iconic teams: the Titans and the Justice League.   


 The Era of the Justice League Is Over 
          

The Justice League officially disbanded after the events of Dark Crisis, stepping down in favor of the Titans. This follows the trend of the Titans continuing to &#34;grow up&#34; over the past several years: characters like Nightwing, Jon Kent, Wally West, and more — including Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter Trinity in one future timeline — have stepped up to handle their mentors&#39; roles, while stories such as 2021&#39;s YA graphic novel I Am Not Starfire by Mariko Tamaki, Yoshi Yoshitani, and Aditya Bidikar and the recent run on The Flash by writer Jeremy Adams emphasize that the Titans can now be seen as parents and caretakers themselves. No longer sidekicks, the Titans are slowly becoming DC&#39;s primary heroes.




This is why Amanda Waller is the perfect antagonist for Titans: Beast World. As one of the League&#39;s greatest opponents, Waller and her machinations represent an older generation of power (political and otherwise) that refuses to step aside and to acknowledge the shifting generational tides. Having orchestrated Beast Boy&#39;s fall alongside Doctor Hate, Waller is doing her best to hold on to old power structures, using the Titan&#39;s youth to justify her increasingly tyrannical grip on power. After having spent so long sculpting the political landscape to her liking, she refuses to cede control despite her heroic peers (the Justice League) recognizing that the time has come to step down.



 Beast World Belongs to the Titans 
          

With the Justice League largely fallen to Garro&#39;s spores, the Titans can no longer turn to their predecessors for advice and aid; rather, it is now their turn to show that they have surpassed their mentors. In ways both metaphorical and literal, the Justice League generation is over; now it is the time of the Titans.
