## SUMMARY 



  Gambit discovers that when he charges Captain America&#39;s shield with his kinetic energy powers, it causes an unbelievable explosion due to the shield&#39;s unique composition.   Gambit&#39;s powers are capable of far more than just charging playing cards - he has shown the ability to destroy zombie Galactus and can achieve immense explosive force in a matter of seconds.   Captain America&#39;s shield is one-of-a-kind and Gambit&#39;s powers works better on it than any other object, making it a rare reusable weapon for Gambit.

## Literature Review

While Captain America is no slouch at using his shield to take down bad guys, the iconic weapon is even more dangerous in the hands of one X-Men hero.




While Captain America is no slouch at using his shield to take down bad guys, the iconic weapon is even more dangerous in the hands of iconic X-Men hero Remy LeBeau, aka Gambit. When the two fought, not only did Gambit manage to take Cap&#39;s shield for his own, but he discovered it interacts with his powers in a shocking way.




The battle takes place in Steve McNiven&#39;s &#39;Captain America vs Gambit&#39; from the Avengers vs X-Men tie-in AVX: Vs #2. As a distracted Steve Rogers takes on Gambit, Remy manages to wrestle away his shield, charging it with his kinetic energy powers.



          

When Gambit throws the shield at Captain America, it lands with an unbelievable explosion, as the narration notes that its unique composition means that unlike other objects, it remains stable even when charged.



Captain America&#39;s shield causes a way bigger explosion than normal...

In X-Men lore, Gambit&#39;s powers allow him to take any non-biological object&#39;s potential energy and turn it into kinetic energy, charging it with explosive power. The explosions that result are generally in line with the object&#39;s size, though Captain America&#39;s shield causes a way bigger explosion than normal - likely because it retains stability throughout the process. While Cap&#39;s shield is made of Vibranium in the MCU, in the comics it&#39;s a unique alloy known as Proto-Adamantium. Apparently, when combined with Gambit&#39;s powers, Proto-Adamantium is the gift that keeps on giving.



 Gambit&#39;s Powers Are a LOT More Powerful Than You Think

Since his powers rely on having &#39;ammo&#39; to hand, Gambit usually carries a deck of cards, which he can quickly charge with explosive energy. However, he&#39;s also shown himself to be capable of far more powerful feats - in Marvel Zombies: Resurrection, his powers are used to destroy the zombie Galactus. What&#39;s remarkable here, however, is just how fast he&#39;s able to charge Captain America&#39;s shield with so much energy. In a matter of seconds, Gambit achieves immense explosive force, perhaps because he has access to a theoretically limitless amount of energy. Captain America&#39;s shield perfectly redirects kinetic force by nature and has deflected Thor&#39;s blows in the past - charging it could therefore result in a god-level explosion.

Captain America&#39;s shield is one-of-a-kind in Marvel&#39;s reality, and there&#39;s no way he&#39;d allow Remy LeBeau to have it full time. However, their fight revealed that Gambit can do things with the shield that no-one else can and, crucially, that his powers work better on the shield than any other object in existence. It&#39;s also the rare reusable weapon for Gambit, whose explosive powers tend to obliterate whatever he uses them on - as happens when he charges Steve Rogers&#39; costume later in the fight.




Fans may think they know what Captain America&#39;s shield can do, but his battle with the X-Men&#39;s Gambit revealed that there are many uses for its unique composition still to be discovered, including the power to detonate it like a bomb without leaving a scratch.
