## Literature Review

My Hero Academia just teased that Deku&#39;s final battle may be completely different than fans anticipated with one simple yet unexpected twist.





Summary

  Shigaraki steals Deku&#39;s Danger Sense quirk, introducing the possibility of Deku being quirkless for the final battle.   Deku&#39;s potential return to being quirkless brings his character full circle and could see him truly become a great hero as teased.   The purpose of One For All in My Hero Academia is undecided, and saving Shigaraki may come at a great cost for Deku.  







As the spotlight once again shifts to Deku and Shigaraki, My Hero Academia&#39;s genius new twist suggests its final battle may be completely different than fans anticipated. Despite Deku having only recently mastered all of One For All&#39;s quirks, the latest chapter hints that fans may soon witness Deku return to his former quirkless self from the beginning of the series.

Chapter #410 of My Hero Academia reveals that Shigaraki has unexpectedly managed to steal Danger Sense from Deku. Although not stated explicitly in the chapter, it appears that Shigaraki&#39;s strong hatred is what has allowed him to do so, just as All For One predicted. Shigaraki will likely go on to steal the remaining quirks within One For All as well, leaving Deku quirkless for the final battle.

          




Seeing as Deku has decided to try and save Shigaraki, he will likely not be able to use Danger Sense against Deku as the quirk is only triggered in the presence of malice or ill intent, of which Deku bears none. However, things certainly do not bode well for Deku, who at best may be left with only the base stockpiling quirk factor of One For All.

                  My Hero Academia&#39;s Final Battle Gets Release Date With Explosive First Trailer   My Hero Academia reveals the release date for Season 7, alongside an enthralling trailer that hints this season could be the last.   


 Becoming Quirkless Again Brings Deku&#39;s Character Full Circle 
          

The possibility that Deku may end up quirkless once again by the end of the series has been quite a common theory among fans of My Hero Academia, with many believing Deku should have remained quirkless. Deku&#39;s story begins with him acknowledging the inequalities of quirk society and questioning whether he can become a hero regardless of whether he has a quirk or not. As sad as it would be to see Deku lose One For All, there couldn&#39;t be a better way for Deku to become the great hero he claims he becomes in chapter #1 than for him to save everyone as the quirkless, powerless kid he started out as.




Arguably, Deku could also become a great hero using One For All. However, that would simply make Deku a symbol like All Might, which has already proven to be too much of a burden for Deku to bear as seen during the Dark Hero Arc. Moreover, creating another symbol of peace would only end up repeating the same vicious cycle of problems, especially given how critical society within My Hero Academia has become towards pro-heroes and the institution as a whole.

                  &#39;One Quirk is Enough&#39;: My Hero Academia Reveals The Strongest Hero May Not Be Deku   Bakugo&#39;s latest victory in My Hero Academia proves he never needed to compete with Deku as he finally discovers his true strength in his only quirk.   



 One For All&#39;s Purpose in My Hero Academia is Undecided 
          

All things considered, whether or not Deku becomes quirkless truly boils down to One For All&#39;s intended purpose within My Hero Academia. From one perspective, One For All appears to exist solely to counter All For One, or rather to maintain the counterbalance as it has thus far in the story as the only power capable of standing a chance against All For One. If so, in theory, there would be no need for an unfathomable power like One For All once All For One ceases to exist.




Nevertheless, defeating Shigaraki may prove to be more challenging than Deku anticipated, especially without Danger Sense and the threat of losing his other quirks looming over him. This final battle could very well end up taking away everything Deku has worked hard to achieve throughout his journey in My Hero Academia. Losing One For All is sure to be a bittersweet experience for Deku and fans alike, but it might just be the cost Deku has to pay to finally redeem Shigaraki.

               My Hero Academia   Summary:   In My Hero Academia, some humans have superpowers called quirks. Izuku Midoriya, nicknamed Deku, is not one of them. Deku has always idolized heroes like the number one hero, All Might, and since he was a child, he has always wanted to be a hero. However, his lack of a quirk has always held him back, but a chance encounter with All Might after discovering a classmate in danger sets Deku on the path to becoming a true hero. My Hero Academia centers around Deku and a class of heroes-in-training at UA. This school shapes young quirk users into future heroes through fake rescue missions, combat training, and other hero-tempering tasks. With young Deku inheriting the &#34;One-For-All&#34; quirk, he will learn what it means to be a true hero while facing off with dastardly supervillains.
