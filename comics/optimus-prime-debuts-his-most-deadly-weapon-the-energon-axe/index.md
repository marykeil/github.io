## Literature Review

Optimus Prime ignites his classic Energon Axe for the first time in the Energon Universe&#39;s new Transformers series, and the results are epic.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Transformers #3




The Energon Universe just debuted one of Optimus Prime’s deadliest weapons, giving old-school Transformers fans a treat by paying homage to the past. The Autobot leader ignites his Energon Axe for the very first time in the new continuity as he fights the Decepticon Skywarp to a standstill, and the results couldn’t be any more awesome.

The moment occurs in Transformers #3, coming from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten. The story picks up from where the previous issue left off, as the Decepticons continue their campaign of terror against humanity.

          

Skywarp is ordered by new Decepticon leader Starscream to go out and find more raw materials for their repairs, bringing the Seeker into contact with the local townspeople. Standing in his way is Optimus Prime, who lights up his Energon Axe in preparation for laying the smackdown on Skywarp.





 The Energon Axe Is A Classic Optimus Prime Weapon 
          

Optimus’ Energon Axe has a long history in the franchise, even though it only really appeared once in the original cartoon. In the two-part opening episode “More Than Meets the Eye,” a climactic moment sees Optimus igniting his axe for the first time as he battles Megatron, who replaces his hand with his own Energon Mace. Although neither Optimus nor Megatron ever used these weapons again in any subsequent episodes, the scene struck a chord with fans, and the two Energon weapons have gone on to be an integral part of both characters’ arsenals in the decades since.

Although Optimus ignites his axe in his fight against Skywarp, he never gets the chance to actually use it. The humans, led by Spike Witwicky&#39;s father Sparkplug, fire a rocket at Optimus, thinking he means them just as much harm as Skywarp. The damage nearly takes the Autobot leader’s arm off, hampering him severely in his fight against the Seeker. Optimus winds up finishing the job, tearing his own arm off entirely and using it as a weapon to beat Skywarp into submission in a brutal standoff.






 Optimus Prime Loses His Arm In Battle With Skywarp 
          

Even though he’s now missing an arm, fans can assume Optimus will be repaired at some point in the future, and readers will hopefully get to see the Autobot leader use his Energon Axe in battle before all is said and done. Even if this is the only appearance of the axe in the new continuity, it still makes for a striking image thanks to Daniel Warren Johnson’s dramatic renderings, which give Optimus Prime an almost mythic quality. And who knows: perhaps Optimus Prime and Megatron ignite their respective Energon Axe and Mace in the Energon Universe to do battle once more on the Sherman Dam. Transformers fans will just have to keep reading to find out.
