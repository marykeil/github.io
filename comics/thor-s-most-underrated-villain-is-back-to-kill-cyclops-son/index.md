## Literature Review

Get ready for the resurrection of a forgotten adversary, as Thor&#39;s most underrated villain emerges with the deadly agenda to kill Cyclops&#39; son Cable.




Thor&#39;s most underrated and forgotten villain stages a dramatic return, but this time, the God of Thunder isn&#39;t the target, but rather Cyclops&#39; son, Cable. The high stakes of this clash are palpable, as it threatens the very existence of a fan-favorite X-Man. However, the repercussions may extend even further, sparking speculation of a potential epic Marvel crossover.




Marvel&#39;s February solicitations bring exciting news, as Cable is set to engage in a fierce showdown against the classic Thor villain Grey Gargoyle. The clash of good and evil is slated to unfold within the pages of Cable #2, crafted by the dynamic duo of Fabian Niciezan and Scot Eaton. The forthcoming comic promises an intense narrative, hinted at by both the synopsis and cover art (found below), where Cable and Grey Gargoyle are depicted in a gripping struggle—a mere glimpse of what is poised to be an epic battle. The anticipation will build as fans prepare for this thrilling encounter between Cyclops&#39; time-traveling son and the iconic Thor adversary.

 Cable #2 (2024)                 Release Date:  February 28, 2024    Writers:  Fabian Nicieza    Artist:  Scot Eaton    Cover Artist:  Whilce Porrtacio   THE FUTURE MAY NOT BE SET IN STONE—BUT CABLE MIGHT BE! Cable and his younger counterpart are racing to try to stop the rise of the Neocracy before it can take root and exterminate all life on Earth as they know it—but when their investigations sends them crashing into the Grey Gargoyle, Cable and young Nate will have to battle for their lives or risk being turned into stone!   







 Marvel is Threatening to Kill Nathan Summers Twice 


          





Grey Gargoyle&#39;s shift from an Avengers villain to an X-Men villain may be teasing a potential crossover between the Avengers and X-Men.




Cable #2 follows Cable and his younger self, Nate aka Kid Cable, who find themselves on a mission to thwart the ominous rise of the Neocracy—an existential threat that could spell doom for all life on Earth, mutants included. However, their noble quest takes an unexpected turn when they cross paths with the formidable Grey Gargoyle, a notorious Thor and Iron Man villain armed with the power to turn things (and people) to stone. The collision with this stone-manipulating antagonist propels Cable and Nate into a life-or-death struggle, where avoiding petrification becomes paramount for their survival and the fate of humanity itself.






While Marvel is unlikely to dispatch both versions of Nathan Summers, given the continuation of the series, the narrative introduces the tantalizing possibility of one of them meeting their demise.




The inclusion of Grey Gargoyle as a central antagonist in this X-Men comic marks a captivating departure, especially considering his more traditional role as an Avengers villain. Adding to the intrigue is the unique threat he poses: the prospect of not just one, but two potential fatalities for Nathan Summers. While Marvel is unlikely to dispatch both Summers characters, given the continuation of the series, the narrative introduces the tantalizing possibility of one of them meeting their demise. Such an outcome, if realized, is poised to unleash a cascade of repercussions that promise to further convolute the already high-stakes narrative.



 There Could Be an Avengers and X-Men Crossover on the Horizon 


          




Grey Gargoyle&#39;s shift from an Avengers villain to an X-Men villain may be teasing a potential crossover between the Avengers and X-Men, which would undoubtedly be a monumental development for the Cable series and any subsequent storylines. Imagining an epic storyline where the Avengers and Cable cross paths adds an extra layer of anticipation for fans, offering the prospect of dynamic interactions between these two iconic Marvel factions. If this crossover does come to fruition, it has the potential to reshape the narrative landscape, providing a fresh and thrilling direction for both Cyclops&#39; son Cable and the broader Marvel Universe.

Cable #2 will be available from Marvel on February 28, 2024.
