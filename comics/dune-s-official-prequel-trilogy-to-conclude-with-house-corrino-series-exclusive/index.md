## Literature Review

Boom Studio&#39;s line of graphic novel adaptations of the Dune prequels comes to a conclusion with House Corrino. 




Boom Studio’s graphic novel adaptation of Dune’s prequel trilogy will conclude with a House Corrino series. For the last several years, Boom has partnered with Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson to produce a line of graphic novels based on the duo’s prequels to the original Dune, written by Brian’s father Frank. These adaptations have been well received by fans. Now, this March they will conclude with Dune: House Corrino, and ScreenRant is pleased to present an exclusive first look.




Dune: House Corrino will feature a script by Herbert and Anderson, based on their novels and will be drawn by Simone Ragazzoni. Boom’s synopsis for the book reads as follows:


House Corrino, once the deadliest House in the known universe as the Imperial family, set up the final pieces leading into the events of Dune and the fall of House Atreides.
While conflicts escalate between the Fremen and House Harkonnen on Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit keep a close eye on Jessica’s pregnancy, and House Atreides takes part in the plan to seal Ix’s fate…


Boom had previously adapted Herbert and Anderson’s other prequel novels. The previous entry in the series, Dune: House Atreides, won a Dragon Award.

         

The first installment of the eight-issue miniseries will ship with covers by Raymond Swanland, Veronica Fish and Rebeca Puebla.





 Boom&#39;s Dune Prequel Adaptations Honor the Original Novels 
          

Brian Herbert, who co-manages his father’s estate, expressed his happiness with Boom’s series of adaptations, saying: “it’s always great to reach the grand finale.” He praised both Boom and the wide range of artists who have worked on the graphic novels. Artist Ragazzoni was also excited to work on the project, citing David Lynch’s 1984 live-action adaptation as sparking his love of the franchise. Ragazzoni told fans to “brace” themselves as they returned to the world of Dune.


 




Dune is widely regarded by critics and readers as one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written. The book inaugurated a multi-media franchise that spanned a series of sequel novels as well as three live-action adaptations. In the early 2000s, Herbert and Anderson collaborated on a series of novels that functioned as prequels to the original masterpiece. Dune was already noted for being a master class in world-building and Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson’s novels added to this, showing the events leading up to the original book. Likewise, Boom’s adaptations of the prequel novels have also been well received, winning industry awards.



 House Corrino Promises Great Things for Dune Fans 
          

And now, the Dune prequel graphic novels line will be coming to an end with House Corrino. About what fans can expect from House Corrino, Anderson said: “it’s time for everything to come together.” The previous adaptations laid the groundwork for House Corrino, showing the machinations of the various Houses, schemes that will ultimately conclude with the fall of the House Atreides and the rise of the Muad’Dib–an event that will change the galaxy forever. The Dune prequel graphic novels from Boom have been greeted with enthusiasm by fans, and now they will come to an unforgettable end with House Corrino.
