# DC Just Turned Santa Claus into Its Answer to Thor... And It Actually Works


## SUMMARY 



  Santa Claus in the DC Universe is depicted as a mythical craftsman who rode alongside the Norse gods during the Wild Hunt.   DC&#39;s version of Santa Claus has a strong connection to Odin, similar to Marvel&#39;s Thor, and has a mischievous associate in the Krampus.   The introduction of Santa Claus as a Thor-like character with a rich backstory filled with gods and battles is an inspired idea that adds depth to the character in the DC Universe.

## Literature Review

The DC Universe gets a new Thor-like hero in the most surprising form of all: A Santa Claus who rode with Norse gods long before he handed out toys.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1!Santa Claus isn&#39;t just real in the DC Universe, he&#39;s pretty much its answer to Thor. As the holiday season gets in full swing, a plague of monsters is unleashed on the world. Saint Nick arrives to lend a hand, leading to a stunning reveal about his past in the DCU.




In Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 by Jeff Parker and Michele Bandini, Batman, Robin and Zatanna are saved by Santa Claus from a group of monsters known as the Draug. Zatanna pulls a book from her archives to explain the secret origin behind the DC Universe&#39;s version of Father Christmas.

          

Santa was once a mythical craftsman who rode alongside the Norse gods during the Wild Hunt. However, Santa was accidentally left behind on Earth after the BifrÃ¶st was destroyed during Ragnarok. Unable to return home, Santa became the gift-giving legend who worked alongside his companion, the more mischievous and frightening Krampus.


 DC&#39;s Santa Claus is an Ally of the Norse Gods 
          




While Santa Claus has been a canonical figure in the DC Universe for some time now, it&#39;s never been addressed what his origin is. In the real world, there are dozens of holiday figures similar to Santa, each with their own backstory. One of the most commonly accepted origins for Santa is that he was based on the real-life figure Saint Nicholas, a kindly, 3rd-century monk who traveled the world helping the sick and the poor and eventually became the patron saint of children. But as far as the DCU is concerned, it&#39;s never been specified where its version of Santa came from.

Various pantheons canonically exist in the DC Universe, such as the Greek and Egyptian gods, all of whom exist under the ultimate creator, the Presence. So while the DCU already has a Thor, Santa has a few similarity to Marvel&#39;s God of Thunder. Like Thor, Santa has a strong connection to Odin (referred to as &#39;Wotan&#39;) and was separated from the realm of the gods. And also like Thor with his brother Loki, Santa has a trickster associate in the Krampus, who schemes behind Santa&#39;s back. It&#39;s not the most conventional take on Santa Claus, but it&#39;s definitely unique. It sets him apart from numerous other versions of Santa Claus and makes him a part of a grander mythos.






 Santa Claus Gets His Best Reinvention Yet as DC&#39;s Thor 
          

It would have been easy to just throw Santa into the DC Universe and call it a day. But Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 goes the extra step and gives him a backstory filled with fantastic battles, gods, and awe. It also raises the possibility that fans may see more of Santa&#39;s time with the Norse gods in later parts of the story, or potentially another book down the line. Giving Santa Claus a backstory that makes him a Thor-like character is an inspired idea that will hopefully be followed up on as the holiday epic continues.

Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
