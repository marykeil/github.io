# Marvel Made Civil War Smarter By Undermining It with 4 Simple Words


## SUMMARY 



  Ultimate Iron Man&#39;s suggestion that register, license, and regulate the Hulk would be a &#34;terrible&#34; idea highlights the inherent problems of the Superhuman Registration Act, championed by the Earth-616 version of Tony Stark.   The reversal of stances between Iron Man and Captain America&#39;s Ultimate variants shows that they could have better understood each other&#39;s sides, meaning the Civil War conflict that tore apart Marvel&#39;s heroes could have been avoided.   Iron Man and Captain America are close friends in many different timelines – making it all the more tragic that they led opposite sides in the Marvel&#39;s original Civil War.

## Literature Review

Steve Rogers and Tony Stark don&#39;t always agree, but their Ultimate counterparts prove that Marvel&#39;s most controversial conflict could&#39;ve been avoided.




One of Marvel Comics’ most controversial and impactful storylines is the heroes&#39; infamous Civil War over the piece of legislation called the Superhuman Registration Act. This document split the hero community right down the middle, with Iron Man leading the Pro-Registration forces and Captain America fighting against him. However, not every Tony Stark thinks the same way, and one Iron Man variant recontextualized the entire war with four simple words.




Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #4 – by Damon Lindelof, Leinil Francis Yu, Dave MCaig and Chris Eliopoilos – featured Betty Ross confronting the Ultimate variants of Iron Man and Captain America over Logan’s mission to kill Banner. During the heated exchange, Tony points out how useless the law is for beings like them.

          

Taking it a step further, Iron Man suggests the government register, license, and regulate the Hulk. Unlike his Earth-616 counterpart, Captain America schime in saying it’s not a bad idea – only for Tony to definitively respond, “It’s a terrible idea,” highlighting just how tragic the actual Civil War event truly was.

                  &#34;World War III&#34;: Why Marvel &amp; DC&#39;s Lost Crossover Will Probably Never Be Seen Again   Very few comic book fans would remember this forgotten Marvel/DC crossover from 1997. It&#39;s never been reprinted, and likely never will.   





 Tony Stark Knew He Was On The Wrong Side Of Marvel&#39;s &#34;Civil War&#34; – But He Realized It Too Late 
          

With the events of the Civil War event series pitting Tony Stark against Captain America in the titular conflict, the two Avengers icons quickly became figureheads for their respective alliances, as most of Marvel&#39;s heroes, and some of its villains, came down on either side of the argument. The freedom-loving Steve Rogers refused to help his government trample over civil liberties as he saw them, while the notoriously independent Iron Man considered those freedoms to be the price of security. In that story, the two were diametrically opposed, but this reversal of their stances in the viewpoints of their Ultimate variants proved that they didn’t really have to be.



Civil War was by the creative team of Mark Millar, Steve McNiven, Dexter Vines, Morry Hollowell, and Chris Eliopoulos.







Ultimate Cap and Tony were notably different from their mainstream versions in some ways – depicting Steve Rogers being markedly more nationalistic and Iron Man being even more of a reckless playboy. However, in many ways, they were still fundamentally the same icons that fans know and love. Their disagreement in Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #4 shows that, had things been slighty different, the two heroes could have better seen each other’s sides, and maybe come to a more peaceful resolution. Unfortunately, the rapid escalation of the Civil War itself couldn&#39;t be avoided, and it wasn’t until the dust settled that Iron Man realized what his Ultimate counterpart intrinsically knew – he was wrong.



 Earth-616&#39;s Superhero &#34;Civil War&#34; Was Avoidable 
          

In most timelines, Tony and Steve are great friends, but it’s clear that they don’t always agree. Given enough time and the right circumstances, it’s more than possible for the two Avengers legends to eventually see eye to eye. As Tony&#39;s commentary on his own idea in Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk #4 proves, it only takes minimal reflection to realize the idea of superhero registration is tricky at best, and deeply problematic at worst. Captain America and Iron Man’s Ultimate counterparts went a long way toward showing just how easily the pair could convince one another to consider their point of view, without Marvel Comics having to endure another Civil War.






Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk is available in its entirety from Marvel Comics.
