# Invincible s Apocalyptic  THE INVINCIBLE WAR  Is Impossible to Adapt Without Huge Changes


## SUMMARY 



  &#34;The Invincible War&#34; in Invincible #60 features an army of alternate Invincibles and a lineup of Image Comics guest stars.   The TV adaptation will likely have to make significant changes since the guest stars are owned by their respective creators.   Despite the absence of guest stars, the story still delivers dramatic moments and a strong narrative.

## Literature Review

The Invincible War was a huge event in the original Invincible comics, but it will be almost impossible to adapt for the Amazon TV series.




Invincible has successfully made the jump from comics to TV, but one story may prove impossible to adapt without making some rather huge changes. “The Invincible War” features a staggering amount of Image Comics guest stars, but it’s precisely for that reason that it would have to be vastly changed whenever it makes the jump to the small screen.




Coming from the creative team of Robert Kirman, Ryan Ottley, Cliff Rathburn, FCO Plascencia and Rus Wooten, Invincible #60 attempts to fit an entire crossover event into one single issue. The story sees Invincible&#39;s enemy Angstrom Levy traveling the multiverse and gathering versions of Mark Grayson in order to get revenge on Invincible for nearly killing him in their previous encounter.

          

The heroes of Image Comics rally together to take on the army of alternate Invincibles, with the likes of Spawn, Savage Dragon, Youngblood, Madman, Firebreather, Witchblade, the Darkness, Jack Staff, Pitt and many more joining the fight before the issue ends.


 The Invincible War&#39;s Guest Stars Make It Hard to Adapt 
          




While Angstrom Levy and the concept of alternate universe Invincibles have already appeared in the TV series, it’s highly unlikely that “The Invincible War” will be adapted - at least, not like it is in the comics. Nearly all of the characters appearing in the issue are owned by their respective creators, which makes their appearance in the Invincible show highly unlikely. While somewhat disappointing, the lack of guest stars is probably for the best, overall. While it’s a shame that fans will never get to see Invincible share the screen with Spawn or the Savage Dragon, it’s not like those characters would get a chance to do much other than pop in for a quick cameo.

The issue is still packed with dramatic moments that would be great to see realized on-screen, such as Mark having to rush Atom Eve off to the hospital during the battle, or the heroic sacrifice of longtime Invincible mainstay Rex Splode. The story ends in a dramatic moment where Mark decides he has to kill Levy to prevent anything like this ever happening again, only for Levy to escape at the last minute. It&#39;s dramatic stuff, and a strong enough story on its own that it doesn’t require any guest stars to appear.






 The Invincible War Has A Slew of Image Comics Guest Stars 
          

While longtime fans would love to see characters such as Madman or Pitt finally appear on-screen for the first time, it isn’t likely or even really all that necessary. Given that Invincible already has an entire universe of superheroes to draw from, any additional guest stars would likely do nothing more than clutter up the narrative. The Invincible War may be coming to the small screen eventually, but the classic Invincible story will be absent its prominent Image Comics guest stars.
