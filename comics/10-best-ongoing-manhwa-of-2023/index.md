 10  Eleceed Proves That Cats Can Be Humans&#39; Best Friends 
Created by Son Jae-Ho and Zhena


 







Eleceed follows the adventures of Jiwoo Seo and a stray cat he picked up named Kayden. What the reader soon comes to find out is that Jiwoo and Kayden are not a normal pair. Jiwoo has the speed and quickness of DC&#39;s The Flash, and Kayden was a top-level Loid Forger-esque master spy who was transformed into a cat, as a way of hiding from sinister forces who want to do him harm. With nothing else to do while he waits until the coast is clear, Kayden takes Jiwoo under his paw to help him be the best he can be.
What makes Eleceed good is its fascinating plot of teaming up a super-powered kid with a grizzled, hard-as-nails, but experienced mentor who happens to be an overweight cat. While the story is chock-full of humorous situations that such a pairing demands, that&#39;s just an overlay for a well-written and tightly drawn journey.

 8  Viral Hit Follows a Streamer&#39;s Wild Life 
Created by Park Tae Joon and Kim Junghyun


Viral Hit tells the story of Hobin Yoo, a high school student geek who, thanks to the class bully, figures out how to monetize his hobbies into an actual wage. This all starts when the bully, Jihyeok Woo, who wants to become a streamer himself, forces Hobin to let him live stream on his mom&#39;s computer. When Hobin accidentally spills food on Woo, he curses Hobin and his mom. This throws Hobin into a rage where he beats down Woo with a ferocity nobody knew he had. Unbeknownst to both, the fight was being live-streamed and the next day, Hobin is considered a hero. After begrudgingly agreeing to work together, Hobin and Woo begin a streaming collaboration where they&#39;ll fight anyone as long as it promises to be good content.
In addition to sharing the same manhwa universe as the popular Lookism manhwa, Viral Hit has all the elements of a great series. There&#39;s a little bit of something for everyone, and more than enough interesting characters to sustain a reader&#39;s attention without overwhelming them. One of the most interesting elements is the series&#39; take on the streamer phenomenon and the willingness to do anything for content.

 7  Villains Are Destined To Die Is a Unique Spin On Isekai 
Created by Gyeoeul Gwon and SUOL
        

Villains Are Destined to Die tells the story of Cha Siyeon who finally gets away from her dysfunctional family life by attending her dream university. Her happiness soon turns to fear as she is mysteriously transported into the video game Daughter of the Duke Love Project that all her classmates have been playing. The game requires the heroine to meet and find her prince among a group of suitors and live happily ever after.

Beautifully written, it keeps the reader interested in seeing if Cha/Penelope can overcome the odds and stay alive.

 6  The Greatest Estate Designer Is a Surprisingly Fresh Comedy Isekai 
Created by Moon Bak-Kung and Kim Hyunsoo
        

The Greatest Estate Designer is another isekai tale that follows modern-day civil engineer Kim Soo-ho who one day wakes up as a questionable character in Iron-Blooded Engineer, a novel he was reading the night before. Naturally, having read the novel, Soo-ho knows what happens in the end, and uses that knowledge and his civil engineering experience to change the novel&#39;s sad ending into a happy one.
The series itself has all the elements of a classic isekai manhwa. Moreover, rather than the death-defying action that is common to the genre, this story focuses on the design, planning, and construction of real estate developments in ancient times. While this may not strike potential readers as particularly exciting, the author&#39;s approach not only makes it interesting but utterly addictive. Readers not only want to see if Soo-ho&#39;s plans work out but also whether his designs are as great as he believes they will be. Along the way, Soo-ho transforms himself from a misfit to a hero.

 5  Omniscient Reader Proves that Bookworms Can Be Heroes 
Created by sing N song and Sleepy-C


 







As the title implies, Omniscient Reader is a story about an avid reader, average office worker Kim Dokja. Outside of work, Dokja spends most of his time reading his favorite web novel, Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, which stars his favorite character, Yoo Joonghkyu, who is everything Dokja isn&#39;t. As it turns out, Dokja is the only person in the world who has read the story to the end. This works out well because when the world is suddenly thrown into an apocalyptic situation that mirrors the one explained in the novel, only Dokja knows how it will end and, most importantly, what to do – with the help of his new friend Joonghkyu – to avoid the end and save humanity.
Flipping the script of the traditional isekai story, Omniscient Reader brings an alternative world to reality and the story is better for it. A well-written saga with a plethora of interesting characters surrounding protagonist Dokja, it&#39;s an adventure that never loses its thrill.

 2  After School Lessons For Unripe Apples Is an Intricate Coming-of-Age Tale 
Created by Soonkki
        

After School Lesson for Unripe Apples follows the story of teenagers Mi-ae Hwang and Cheol Kim, who years earlier were friends but lost touch with each other during elementary school. However, they are reunited in middle school. Mi-ae is a typical kid who likes comics and music and hanging out with her friends. With her laid-back personality, Mi-ae doesn&#39;t like to attract attention. Cheol, conversely, has become quite the delinquent since they last played together. As the new kid at Mi-ae&#39;s school, his size and unfriendly attitude scare a lot of his classmates. Mi-ae is the only person he seems to have a connection with. Naturally, this leads to a lot of unwanted attention as others begin to think Mi-ae and Cheol are a couple – which is the last thing both want – or so it seems.
This is a fun and humorous series that identifies and explores how Mi-ae and Cheol develop and mature during their adolescence, but it&#39;s not a typical school slice-of-life tale. As the two navigate being a teenager and their relationship, they discover a lot about themselves and the world around them. It&#39;s that process of discovery that makes the story so endearing.
