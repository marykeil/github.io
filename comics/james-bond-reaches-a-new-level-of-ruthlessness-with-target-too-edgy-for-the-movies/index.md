## Literature Review

James Bond&#39;s 007 is returning to comics with a brand new series next year, including ruthless violence too extreme for the movies.




James Bond is getting an all-new comic series next year, and he’ll be bringing superstar writer Garth Ennis along with him. Next January’s James Bond 007 arrives just in time to celebrate ten years of Dynamite Entertainment publishing comics based on Ian Fleming’s most famous character, and promises to pit Bond against his greatest challenge yet.




Coming from the creative team of Garth Ennis and Rafa Lobosco, James Bond 007 #1 sees the preeminent British superspy tasked with hunting down a former Double-0 agent, one who is carrying a grudge against his former employers. Check out the preview below, shared by AIPT:

         

As can be seen in the pages above, Bond is more ruthless than ever, as the preview begins with 007 wiping out an entire crime family all in one go. Ennis and Lobosco don’t pull any punches with their characterization of Bond, even going so far as having the superspy wipe out the family’s elderly matriarch, just to be thorough.

 James Bond 007 #1                 Release Date:  January 10, 2024    Writer:  Garth Ennis    Artist:  Rafa Lobosco    Cover:  Dave Johnson   Codename: Stalvoda Translation (from Russian): Steel Water A relic of the Cold War, the deadly compound Stalvoda has a long buried connection with MI6. So when it mysteriously reappears in disturbing circumstances, the agency naturally assigns its best operative to get to the bottom of things – 007 himself, James Bond. But Bond isn’t the only one to have carried the Double O rank, and with it MI6’s secrets. Former agent Archibald Tyron is another, and he’s also carrying a grudge – one that’s aimed squarely at the heart of His Majesty’s Secret Service!   






 : James Bond&#39;s New Superweapon Was Designed to Counter a Major Movie Cliché

The new series looks to be continuing the fine work Dynamite has done in bringing Bond to the comic book page, and Garth Ennis is the perfect writer to celebrate the anniversary. Titled &#34;Your Cold, Cold Heart,&#34; the story sounds worthy of the classic Bond tradition, as 007 must deal with a relic of the Cold War in Stalvoda, a deadly chemical superweapon that leaves no trace. Artist Rafa Lobosco is well trained in the world of 007, as the artist has already provided the artwork for a previous Dynamite story, James Bond: Black Box. Rounding things out is cover artist Dave Johnson, whose clean style and retro renderings lend themselves to the James Bond series.




Ever since acquiring the license in 2014, Dynamite Entertainment has put out a slew of James Bond comics, from adaptations of Ian Fleming’s original novels, to the origins of a young Bond in WWII, to new, updated adventures in the present day. Dynamite has even expanded the world by publishing comics featuring supporting characters in the 007 world, with Felix Leiter, Miss Moneypenny and M getting their own comics throughout Dynamite’s run. Garth Ennis looks to be adding to that proud tradition, including flirty banter with Moneyponey and Bond’s dressing down at the hands of M.



 Garth Ennis&#39; James Bond 007 Promises To Be A Dark Ride 
          

Known for his dark, oft-times controversial stories, it will be interesting to see where Garth Ennis takes the character of Bond in the upcoming series. The Boys, Preacher and his run on Marvel’s The Punisher all featured copious amounts of violence and bad behavior, much of it delivered with pitch-black humor. Judging by the preview released thus far, Ennis isn’t holding anything back, as Bond is just as ruthless as ever in this opening scene. However things play out, fans will certainly be in for a darkly comic ride when Garth Ennis gets his hands on James Bond.
