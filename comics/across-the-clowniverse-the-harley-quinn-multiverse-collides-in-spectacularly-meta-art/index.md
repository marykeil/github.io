## Literature Review

Harley Quinn pulls herself together in an amazing cover that sees her team up with an army of her variants for an epic multiversal fight.




As her multiverse shenanigans hit their apex, Harley Quinn is uniting a team of variants to end her cosmic battles once and for all. Harley has had her fill of being the multiverse&#39;s most sought-after woman and she&#39;s about to end things with the only people she can trust: Copies of herself!




The new year is almost here and DC Comics is giving fans a look at what they can expect for their favorite characters. Next February, Harley Quinn #37 by Tini Howard, Sweeny Boo, and other artists will be released and it seems to be the culmination of Harley Quinn&#39;s epic adventures across DC&#39;s numerous alternate Earths. The solicited text reveals that Harley is going after Brother Eye and she&#39;s recruiting numerous variants of herself. The standard cover shows an army of variants charging together as they set out to defeat the threat presented by Brother Eye.



          



  Harley Quinn #37   Release Date: 2/27/24   Writer: Tini Howard   Artist: Sweeney Boo and various   Cover Artist: Sweeney Boo and various   Variant Cover Artists: Jorge Fornes, DaNi, and Sebastian Fiumara   Plot: Honka honka! That nogoodnik Brother Eye has soured my reputation across the whole dang multiverse and it’s gonna take me, myself, and I to put things right. Join me, Tini, Sweeney, and a panoply of clown girl artist extraordinaires as we go across the clowniverse! If you don’t buy this comic then my lawyer P.P. Thompson is gonna sue you!!!! Plus: In 1999 two teenagers went into the woods with a video camera and my twin sister Erica Henderson came out of the woods with a comic book about me that’s got real four-quadrant appeal (I wanted ta make a pun usin’ a word for butts instead of appeal but the lady who’s forcing me to write these told me not to).  





 Harley Quinn is Recruiting Variants to Stop Brother Eye 
          

Harley Quinn quickly found herself being thrust onto the multiversal stage thanks to the development of some unexpected powers. Harley gained the ability to breach dimensions, something that caught the eye of Lady Quark, who became concerned with the threat that Harley&#39;s power posed. However, Quark also believed that Harley&#39;s new power could be replicated and used for the betterment of the universe in Quark&#39;s hands. She had an army of O.M.A.C.s assemble an AI copy of Harley to study her, but upon meeting her, the construct attempted to &#39;resolve&#39; the errors in Harley.

Eagle-eyed fans may recognize many of the Harley Quinn variants on the upcoming issue&#39;s cover. Her Heroic Harlequin persona from Knight Terrors can be seen flying over the ensemble. And her barbarian counterpart from the upcoming Harley Quinn #36 is wielding her warhammer as she charges along the numerous doppelgangers. Many of the variants appear to be the non-canonical Harleys that have debuted in Harley Quinn&#39;s back-ups. While it seemed that these variants were simply one-offs, they&#39;re going to be Harley&#39;s best shot and defeating Brother Eye and getting her life back on track. But is an army of Harleys going to be enough to stop an out-of-control villain like Brother Eye?






 Harley Quinn is Assembling Her Most Chaotic Team Ever 
          

Harley Quinn thrives in chaotic situations, and what&#39;s more chaotic than a team of Harleys fighting to stop one of the most dangerous villains in the multiverse? While the Prime Harley is powerless (sans for her dimensional breaching powers), some of her copies do have powers like enhanced strength or other useful skills that will help Harley take out Brother Eye for good. Of course, gathering so many different doppelgangers in one place could be a seriously bad idea. But if Harley Quinn wants any shot at defeating her nemesis, she&#39;s going to have to put a lot of trust in herself.

Harley Quinn #37 will be available from DC Comics on February 27th, 2024.
