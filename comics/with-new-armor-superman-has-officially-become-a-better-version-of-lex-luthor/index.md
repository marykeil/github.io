## Literature Review

Summary

  Superman, forced into Lex Luthor&#39;s role in Metropolis, fights super-powered enemies on his own turf in a suit of armor, experiencing a surprising role reversal.   The Blue Earth movement steals Superman&#39;s powers and runs rampant across Metropolis, forcing Superman to resort to armor to protect the city.   With Superman in charge of Supercorp and wearing an armored suit, he finally sees things from Lex Luthor&#39;s perspective and understands him better than ever.  







Despite being iconic rivals, Superman might finally see from Lex Luthor&#39;s perspective, as he&#39;s been forced into Lex&#39;s role in Metropolis. Superman has always believed that if Lex truly wanted to save the world, he could&#39;ve easily done so by now. Lex Luthor believes that Superman is more of a hindrance to humanity than a help and that Superman&#39;s presence will ultimately doom humanity. But now, with a new armored suit, Superman has to fight super-powered enemies on his own turf â€” just like Lex has been fighting Superman all this time.

This surprising role reversal takes place in Action Comics #1059 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, and Eber Ferreira. In this story, the Blue Earth movement has stolen Superman&#39;s powers and are using them to run rampant across Metropolis. With Superman&#39;s own powers weakened from the theft, Superman has resorted to armor to be able to stand up to these threats.

          




This has resulted in Superman fighting against Kryptonian-level threats in a suit of armor to protect Metropolis, which is shockingly similar to what Lex Luthor has been doing for years.
