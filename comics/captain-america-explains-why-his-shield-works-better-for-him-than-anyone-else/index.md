## Literature Review

Captain America&#39;s iconic shield is great at defense and offense, but only because its wielder knows how to use it to its full potential.




The shield Captain America wields serves as both his primary defense and offense. Captain America #4 (2023) reveals a more in-depth reason for the iconic accessory&#39;s various capabilities. It is not just because of the shield&#39;s composition or design, but also due to the way the titular hero capitalizes on those aspects.




Undergoing numerous design changes over the years, Captain America&#39;s shield is a critical component of not just his uniform, but his combat style. Currently, crafted using a vibranium-alloy, its circular shape makes it handy as a projectile with &#34;blowback&#34; aspects. However, with some users, the effectiveness of the shield would significantly diminish.

          

The shield is at its optimum functionality when Steve Rogers is handling it. After years of wielding a wide variety of shield types, Marvel&#39;s super soldier is a masterful user of this weapon and protective tool. While there are still things he&#39;s learning about his shield, Cap has proven that it&#39;s only as good as the person controlling it.

                  Captain America Reveals His Underrated Super-Senses Give Him a Major Advantage Over Tech   Captain America is a man with a unique set of skills, but his most underrated applies to his senses, which give him an advantage against technology.   





 Captain America Excels With His Shield Because He Knows It Better Than Anyone Else 
          

The creative team of Captain America #4 includes J. Michael Straczynski, Lan Medina, Espen Grundetjern, and Joe Caramagna. The issue continues the titular hero&#39;s fight against a supernatural foe that is giving him more trouble than his usual enemies thanks to a newly uncovered weakness. However, Captain America provides important details about how his shield works, revealing his personal strengths as its user. The shield is capable of throwing back some of the energy it stores up from attackers onslaughts, which Steve can then &#34;activate&#34; and use against them. This energy is channeled and is limited only by how much is thrown against the hero. He can&#39;t re-channel energy that hasn&#39;t been exerted against him.

While Captain America&#39;s shield has proven effective against the majority of his foes, this efficacy has come from the way Steve has chosen to wield it. He &#34;activates&#34; the protection he needs from it and knows when he has enough energy stored in it to use against his enemies. This awareness and expertise aren&#39;t things that just anyone can intuitively know. It isn&#39;t common knowledge. These assertions and applications have come with the super soldier&#39;s long-term use and experience, as well as his own combat prowess. This highlights how Steve&#39;s age and experience are more impressive assets than they initially appear to be.



 Steve Rogers is the Key to His Shield&#39;s Success 
          

Captain America&#39;s shield is good for offense and defense, but it is only as useful as its wielder allows it to be. Steve Rogers has proven he is currently best-suited for long-term use of the shield. Other heroes may have worn the mantle and may be great at combat, but only the original Captain America has such intensive knowledge of the vibranium-alloy shield and its capabilities. This knowledge is what allows him to come out on top time and time again in multiple eras of conflict. Steve Rogers has not only the spirit and determination to be a great soldier, but also the know-how and experience to make the most of his weapon of choice.
