## Literature Review

One of DC&#39;s more recent characters, Dreamer, has been underutilized since she was brought into DC continuity; the new year seems set to change that.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Action Comics #1060!




The Supergirl character known as Dream is poised to play a pivotal role in DC Comics moving forward, as the company appears ready to take the rarely used Nia Nal and thrust her into the center of its overall narrative, positioning her extremely important in DC&#39;s 2024 slate of major storytelling events.

Action Comics #1060 contains the backup story &#34;Squad Dreams&#34; – by Nicole Maines, Steve Orlando, Fico Ossio, Luis Guerrero, and Rob Leigh – in which Nia Nal&#39;s true role in the DC Universe is made clear.

         

In the story, Nia is contacted by Amanda Waller and blackmailed into going after a rogue precognitive meta-human. While Nia is hesitant, she can&#39;t outright turn Waller down, due to Waller threatening to expose Nia&#39;s hometown, which she&#39;s using to house alien refugees. With no other choice, Nia hunts down the meta-human Waller wants, which Waller was using as a test to see just how easily Nia can be controlled.




                  DC&#39;s Knight Terrors Forgot the One Hero Who Could Have Changed Everything   DC just wrapped up one of their biggest events of the year, but it seems they forgot to invite the one character who could&#39;ve helped the most.   


 DC&#39;s Dreamer Is Ready To Take On A Larger Role 


          

Nia Nal is a half-Naltorian, a race of aliens who can foresee future events through their dreams. She is also able to travel through people&#39;s dreams to reach their location. Recently, Dreamer has begun showing the ability to see the future even while awake, which makes her a remarkably powerful precognitive hero. Using her abilities, she&#39;s managed to save the world several times. When the evil dictator Bendix had a master plan to wipe out all superheroes, it was only Dreamer using her powers that managed to prevent him from succeeding. Now, it Amanda Waller has taken note of Nia&#39;s incredible abilities and intends to use them for herself.




Amanda Waller has been gearing up recently to wipe out all superheroes and retake Earth&#39;s future for humanity. She has been manipulating things behind the scenes for quite a while now, having most recently orchestrated the Beast World event. She&#39;s also been stocking up on power and resources, using several different means to either gather artifacts to fight the Justice League or gather people with useful abilities. This eventually turned her attention to Dreamer, as Waller believes that Dreamer could be manipulated into serving her. If she&#39;s right, Dreamer would make Waller more powerful than ever before, as her precognition abilities, combined with Waller&#39;s genius, would make Amanda Waller utterly unstoppable.



 Waller Admits Nial Nal Is Her Secret Weapon 


          

Dreamer is a prominent example of a character that first appeared in another medium before being brought into the DC Universe. Since first appearing on the Arrowverse show Supergirl, the character has entered the main DC continuity, and been featured in increasingly prominent storylnes. As the ever-evolving DC Universe continues to move forward, it&#39;s time for characters like Dreamer to get the opportunity to shine in a main DC event. While Dreamer may have missed out on her chance during Knight Terrors, it seems she&#39;ll be getting another chance in DC&#39;s 2024 slate. Only then will readers see exactly what Supergirl character Dreamer&#39;s new place in the DC Universe is.
