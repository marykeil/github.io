## Literature Review

Superman’s daughter Otho-Ra is in the hands of a villain and she’s in serious danger of abandoning her father’s ways for a life of villainy.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1060!The newest member of Superman&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery just might wind up being his daughter. Otho-Ra, one-half of the Super-Twins, has been kidnapped and taken to a dark, alternate Earth. But the Man of Steel&#39;s daughter may have bigger problems as she sees what her future potentially holds.




In Action Comics #1060 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Eddy Barrows, Fico Ossio, and Eber Ferreira, one of Superman&#39;s adopted children, Otho-Ra, has been kidnapped by Janan al Ghul, Batman&#39;s daughter from the Dark Multiverse. Otho-Ra tries to fight back against Janan, now calling herself Sister Shadow, but Otho-Ra is out of her depth compared to the twisted Wayne progeny.

          

However, Sister Shadow hasn&#39;t stolen Otho-Ra to hurt her, but rather recruit her. Janan tells Otho-Ra that there are other versions of her in the multiverse and that they are all conquerors. The young girl begins falling to Sister Shadow&#39;s influence as Otho-Ra hears stories of her being a warrior and the soulbearer of the Old God Olgrun.


 Superman&#39;s Daughter is Being Turned into His Next Enemy 
          




Otho-Ra and her twin brother Osul-Ra came into Superman&#39;s life when he went to Warworld to free its inhabitants from the iron rule of Mongul. After Clark liberated the planet, he took the two orphans into his home and officially adopted them. And thanks to their Phaelosian powers, they were able to join their father as the Superman Family&#39;s newest heroes, the Super-Twins. However, it hasn&#39;t been all easy for the kids, particularly Otho-Ra. As xenophobic hate speech became increasingly common thanks to the hate group Blue Earth, Otho-Ra&#39;s anger began bubbling to the surface, leading her to attack Blue Earth protesters.

Otho-Ra&#39;s anger has been simmering for some time, but there&#39;s never been any indication that she&#39;d ever betray her father. If either of the Super-Twins were going to go rogue, it was assumed it&#39;d have been Osul-Ra, who has one of the mythical aspects of Olgrun inside him. Osul-Ra died on Warworld and Superman used the Fire of Olgrun to revive him. Ever since then, numerous people such as Cyborg Superman and the New Gods have warned Clark that the Mad God could return using Osul-Ra as a vessel. But Osul-Ra shows no signs of turning bad, unlike his sister, who is slowly being converted by someone who absolutely hates Superman.






 Can Superman Save His Daughter From a Life of Evil? 


          

There&#39;s a chance Janan al Ghul is lying to Otho-Ra. More than anything else, Sister Shadow just wants to make Superman suffer, and turning his daughter against him would undoubtedly do that. But even if Otho-Ra is a conqueror in other universes, that&#39;s not to say she&#39;ll turn out the same way. Superman is one of the best influences in the DC Universe and he&#39;s not going to let a villain corrupt his daughter&#39;s mind so easily. But al Ghul has powerful magics and is determined to turn Otho-Ra against Clark. If Superman doesn&#39;t act fast, then he risks losing his daughter for good.

Action Comics #1060 is on sale now from DC Comics.
