## Literature Review

Spider-Woman lives in fear of her powers going berserk, and now in a Nightmare variant by Peach Momoko, she finally loses control. 




Spider-Woman is transformed into pure nightmare fuel as her powers finally go haywire. Marvel has tapped acclaimed artist Peach Momoko to draw a series of “Nightmare” variant covers, showing some of the publisher’s biggest characters in horrifying situations. In the Nightmare variant of Spider-Woman #2, Momoko works her magic on the heroine, forcing Jessica Drew to confront her worst nightmare: losing control of her powers.




Peach Momoko unveiled the Nightmare cover for Spider-Woman #2 in a post on Instagram. The piece gives an otherworldly, almost insect-like quality to Spider-Woman, who stands in the middle of a web. Other insects are caught in it. Spider-Woman’s facial expression is unsettling as well. It is difficult to discern what she is thinking, leaving fans wondering if she will attack.


 

Spider-Woman #2 will be written by Steve Foxe and drawn by Carola Borelli.


 Spider-Woman Had a Strange Beginning 
          

Spider-Woman began as a way to secure a trademark and ended up becoming a Marvel institution. According to legend, Marvel feared that someone else would trademark the name “Spider-Woman,” and hence created a character with that name. Despite the throw-away nature of her origin, Spider-Woman has had a long history at the publisher, even joining the Avengers in the 2000s. Her time on the team led to a resurgence of interest in the character, and she has been a consistent fixture of the Marvel Universe since. Recently, Marvel commissioned Peach Momoko to tap into the horror aspects of their characters, and she delivered with Spider-Woman.




Since Spider-Woman’s debut, her origin has gone through several iterations. In the most recent version, her parents were scientists whose research was about to be compromised. They injected their daughter Jessica with a special serum, derived from spiders, that gave her super-powers. However, the serum was unstable and Spider-Woman nearly lost control of her powers several times. Spider-Woman is extremely powerful, with powers beyond Spider-Man, and if she lost control, it could be very bad indeed. Spider-Woman’s struggles with her powers have driven some of her best stories.

 Spider-Woman&#39;s Worst Fear is Now Everyone Else&#39;s Problem 
          

Unfortunately, Spider-Woman has finally lost control in Peach Momoko’s Nightmare variant. Momoko shows Spider-Woman using her powers in creepy and downright disturbing ways. For example, the webs Spider-Woman has spun around her are no doubt for catching prey, but where she draws the line is left up to fans’ imaginations. Furthermore, Spider-Woman’s body looks different, as if it is undergoing some sort of metamorphosis, but into what is again for fans to decide. Whatever Spider-Woman is changing into is irrelevant, as she has turned into pure nightmare fuel as her worst fears are realized.
