## Literature Review

After months of mystery, events from Green Lanternâ€™s past come to light as Hal Jordan reveals he played a part in the death of his friend Kilowog.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #6!Thanks to Hal Jordan, a fan-favorite Green Lantern has met an unfortunate end. For months now, Hal Jordan has been trying to move past some harrowing events out in space. But the hero is forced to confront the past and how Green Lantern&#39;s actions played a part in the death of Corps&#39; drill sergeant, Kilowog.




In Green Lantern #6 by Jeremy Adams, Xermanico, and Scott Godlewski, Hal Jordan&#39;s most bitter nemesis Sinestro has just become a Red Lantern. Green Lantern fights back against his former mentor, but Sinestro&#39;s new powers make him more aggressive and unhinged than ever before. Thankfully, Green Lantern uses his new Power Ring to create a mecha construct.

          

After stopping Sinestro from destroying the world, Hal returns home to his trailer and talks with Kilowog before their old ally Razer drops by. The shoe finally drops as Razer reveals that the Kilowog living with Jordan is a construct. Worse, Jordan reveals that Kilowog is dead and that it&#39;s because of him.


 Kilowog is Dead and Green Lantern is Involved 


          




For some time now, former Green Lantern Corps member Hal Jordan has been stuck on Earth. The Guardians of the Universe are missing and in their place, the United Planets have taken control of the Corps. However, unseen circumstances saw Hal leave the Corps and return to Earth, which was placed under a heavy quarantine. Hal somewhat returned to his former life, awestruck at how much had changed since he was last on Earth. Aside from a job at Ferris Air, the only thing Hal had going for him was his life with Kilowog, who had begun living with Jordan in his trailer.

There&#39;s been a lot of ambiguity in the current Green Lantern run. No one knows where the Guardians of the Universe went, nor how the United Planets assumed control of the Corps. There have also been repeated mentions of a disaster happening on Korugar, Sinestro&#39;s home planet. The revelation that Kilowog is dead and that Hal blames himself for it could explain why Hal&#39;s been grounded. It&#39;s been assumed his relocation to Earth was voluntary. But now that it&#39;s known that one of the most beloved Corps members is dead, its possible that Hal was kicked out of the Corps for his part in Kilowog&#39;s death.






 The Green Lantern Corps Lost a Valuable Resource in Kilowog 
          

However Kilowog died, it can&#39;t be stated enough how his death will impact the Green Lantern Corps. Kilowog was responsible for training the Corps&#39; recruits and he helped mold some of the greatest warriors ever to wear a Power Ring. But somehow, Hal Jordan led Kilowog to his death. He could just be blaming himself for an event that was no one&#39;s fault in particular. But the death of the Corps&#39; drill sergeant would explain why Hal is no longer a part of an organization he sacrificed his life for. Whatever the case may be, Kilowog is gone and the Green Lanterns are worse off without him.

Green Lantern #6 is on sale now from DC Comics.
