## Literature Review

Green Lantern finally cures himself of his corruption with a new Power Ring that has a bonus power to help him defeat his dangerous new enemies.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern: War Journal #4!The new Power Ring on Green Lantern&#39;s finger is giving him a surprisingly dark superpower. For all their might, the terrifying Radiant Dead failed to convert John Stewart into their ranks. Thanks to his new ring, not only is Stewart safe, but he&#39;s got a way of turning the tide against his newest enemies.




In Green Lantern: War Journal #4 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Montos, John takes the Power Ring that once belonged to the Green Lantern Varron (now a member of the Radiant Dead). Though the ring is cut off from the main power source, it can be restarted by a new source like Genesis.

          

After some brief trouble, the Power Ring is restarted and John takes it, purging him of his Radiant Dead infection. Not only that but thanks to the recent development of Green Lantern&#39;s Soul Trek ability, he can now spy on Varron and the rest of the Radiant Dead. Now that John can track them, the Lantern heads out to take down the Radiant Dead.


 Green Lantern&#39;s New Ring Can Track His Most Powerful Enemies Yet 
          




The Radiant Dead is an army of undead soldiers, all operating under the thrall of the Revenant Queen. The evil force came to the DC Universe from a parallel world where they nearly extinguished the Green Lantern Corps save for a variant of John Stewart and a young Lantern named Shepherd. The Radiant Dead escaped to the Prime DC Universe and began spreading their influence to add to their ranks. After the Green Lantern Varron fell to the Radiant Dead&#39;s sway, he attacked and infected John Stewart. The clock began ticking as John was forced to find a way to purify himself of his corruption.

Up until now, Green Lantern has been playing defense against the Radiant Dead. He didn&#39;t even know who they were until the converted Varron came and infected John. Thankfully, John was able to purify himself of his infection with his new Power Ring. And as a bonus, the ring is still connected to Varron, even though he&#39;s now a part of the Radiant Dead&#39;s sinister hive mind. That means Stewart can finally start playing offense. Rather than wait for the Radiant Dead to come to him, he can track down and hopefully eliminate the sinister forces.






 Green Lantern is Using the Radiant Dead&#39;s Hive Mind Against Them 


          

Being able to peer into the Radiant Dead&#39;s shared essence does provide a major advantage to John and his allies, but it&#39;s not exactly without risk. The Radiant Dead want John dead and they can track him as easily as he can track them. However, the Green Lantern has years of military experience and is used to being in dangerous situations like this before. John may only have the same information that the Radiant Dead have, but with his skills and prowess, this new power could give Green Lantern the asset he needs to take the army down once and for all.

Green Lantern: War Journal #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
