## Literature Review

Eric Powell and Harold Schechter reunite to bring Dr. Werthless: The Man Who Studied Murder (And Nearly Killed the Comics Industry) to Dark Horse.




True crime and comic book history come together in Dark Horse Comics&#39; latest graphic novel, Dr. Werthless: The Man Who Studied Murder (And Nearly Killed the Comics Industry). An award winning creative team reunites for a new story detailing the history of one of the most controversial figures in pop culture.




Screen Rant has the exclusive first look at Dark Horse Comics&#39; upcoming graphic novel, which reunites Eric Powell and Harold Schechter, the creative team behind Did You Hear What Eddie Gein Done?. Dr. Werthless: The Man Who Studied Murder (And Nearly Killed the Comics Industry) is a true crime story about the polarizing figure Dr. Fredric Wertham.



          

Dr. Fredric Wertham was the infamous book Seduction of the Innocent whose research led the charge in the development of the Comics Code Authority. Powell and Schechter&#39;s book takes a look at Wertham&#39;s research, as well as his relationship with the notorious killer Albert Fish, in a poignant and dark character examination of Wertham.

Some readers well-versed in history may already be familiar with Wertham&#39;s influence on the comic medium. Wertham was a psychiatrist who studied comics in the Golden Age and published his findings in the infamous book, Seduction of the Innocent. Wertham&#39;s book heavily critiqued the comic book industry, accusing comics of promoting juvenile delinquency and homosexuality in minors. Wertham also testified his findings before a Senate subcommittee and his work is largely credited with helping usher in the Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body that lasted for nearly 60 years.

While Fredric Wertham holds a controversial place in comic book history, his work extended beyond comics. Wertham also opened up a clinic in Harlem for disadvantaged African-American patients and worked towards desegregation of public schools. Schechter and Powell&#39;s book will not only touch on the role he played in comics, but also his studies on the mental and social roots behind violence. However, it won&#39;t shy away from the darker side of Wertham as someone who exploited his patients for his own commercial ends. By the sound of things, Dr. Werthless will be the most balanced portrayal of the infamous figure.

Like everyone else, Dr. Fredric Wertham was a complicated individual. His regressive and misguided views had drastic effects on the comic book industry that nearly made it collapse. But he was also someone who was progressive in other ways and had a legitimate desire to improve the lives of people by studying the causes of violence. Schechter and Powell&#39;s upcoming graphic novel will hopefully get into what made Wertham tick and what drove him to do the things he did. Perhaps everyone will walk away from the Dark Horse graphic novel with a better understanding of Wertham and the great impact he had on the comic book world.

Dr. Werthless: The Man Who Studied Murder (And Nearly Killed the Comics Industry) is available from Dark Horse Comics this summer.
