## Literature Review

The Thundercats are in for the shock of their lives in Thundercats #2 as they discover another Thunderian survivor on Third Earth!




Thundercats lore changes forever with the introduction of another survivor of their homeworld of Thundera. One of the most endearing cartoons and toy lines of the 1980s, the Thundercats are poised to make a massive comeback, courtesy of Dynamite Entertainment. Dynamite is taking the franchise back to its roots, exploring the Thundercats first days on Third Earth. Now, in Thundercats #2, Lion-O and his team learn they are not alone.




Dynamite shared the solicitation for Thundercats #2 with League of Comic Geeks. The issue, written by Declan Shalvey and drawn by Drew Moss, will see Lion-O attempt to contact his mentor, Jaga, with the legendary Sword of Omens. However, rather than find Jaga, he and the rest of the team are shocked to discover another Thunderian survivor on Third Earth.

          

Dynamite did not provide any additional information on the survivor’s identity.


 The Thundercats Are on the Move Once Again 
         

The Thundercats hail from the planet Thundera, where they were part of the nobility. The planet was dying, and its inhabitants escaped, only for most of them to be slaughtered by the Evil Mutants. The Thundercats were spared, but their ship was damaged and crash-landed on the mysterious planet known as Third Earth, where they encountered the evil sorcerer Mumm-Ra, who became their mortal enemy. This dark premise became the basis for every incarnation of the franchise: the Thundercats were the last of their kind, and fought for their existence daily.




The addition of new Thunderian(s) to the Thundercats roster would help them greatly in their battle against Mumm-Ra. Shortly after their arrival on Third Earth, the Evil Mutants landed as well, and joined forces with Mumm-Ra. New recruits to the team, and whatever skills they bring to the table, could tip the odds in favor of the Thundercats. That is, of course, assuming this new Thunderian (or Thunderians) are good, like Lion-O and the rest of the Thundercats. Dynamite could truly shake up the Thundercats formula by introducing an evil Thunderian, one who could join Mumm-Ra’s forces.

                  He-Man &amp; Thundercats&#39; Official Crossover Settled Whose Weapons Are Better   Fan debate over who has the best weapons - the Thundercats or He-Man - was settled by their first official crossover (and the loser wasn&#39;t happy.)   



 The Thundercats Have Met Other Thunderian Survivors Before 
         




In the original Thundercats continuity, three additional survivors of Thundera were introduced: Lynx-O, Bengali and Pumyra. It stands to reason that the survivor the team will meet in Thundercats #2 could be one of these three. However, their first appearances were later in the timeline, and not that soon. Declan Shalvey and Drew Moss could very well be inserting one of these characters earlier than anticipated, a move that could provide fresh stories and situations. Assuming the new Thunderian survivor is not some trick by Mumm-Ra or a new villain, this greatly alters Thundercats lore forever.
