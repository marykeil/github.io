 Green Arrow’s Uniform and Car Upgrade Kicks Off His New Era in the DCU 
          

Green Arrow #7 stands out as a pivotal installment in the ongoing Green Arrow series, signifying Oliver&#39;s return to Earth-0 storylines. Following the Justice League&#39;s liberation from dream universes created by Pariah, Green Arrow, conspicuously absent, found himself lost in the vast expanse of time and space. His return emerges as a monumental development in his personal narrative, reuniting him with fellow heroes and family. Upon his comeback, Oliver seizes the opportunity to raid his now available funds and treat himself to buying a new ride and uniform. These purchases become tangible representations of Ollie&#39;s imminent new era in the DC Comics realm.




Over the years, Green Arrow has donned various costumes, some more questionable than others, including his Golden Era attire that resembled a blend of Robin Hood couture and childen pajamas. However, his latest uniform stands out as potentially his best. Departing from the traditional cloth-like costume, it places a greater emphasis on armor elements, creating a look befitting a non-meta hero. The design exudes sheer badassery. Meanwhile, Green Arrow&#39;s fresh ride is as cool as it is quirky, featuring a car that effortlessly channels the distinct appearance of the 1940s. Despite its vintage allure, there&#39;s no denying that this car is thoroughly souped up.



 Green Arrow&#39;s Next Upgrade? The Arrow Plane! 


          

With Oliver&#39;s return, it seems he&#39;s in the market for upgrades to enhance his hero-ing escapades, and the Arrow Plane may very well be part of those upgrades, especially considering its teased appearance in Green Arrow #5. In this issue, Oliver forms an alliance of sorts with what appears to be his older self. When the older Oliver drives the car off a cliff to escape the animal humanoids chasing them, it seamlessly transforms into the Arrow Plane. Green Arrow is thoroughly impressed, admitting he wished he had thought of that first, raising the exciting possibility of the Arrow Plane making a return in future issues.
