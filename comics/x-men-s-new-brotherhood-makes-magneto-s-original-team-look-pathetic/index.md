# X-Men s New Brotherhood Makes Magneto s Original Team Look Pathetic


## SUMMARY 



  Storm&#39;s victory over Genesis in X-Men Red #18 sets the stage for the creation of a powerful new Brotherhood, led by Genesis and her children War and Famine.   Unlike Magneto&#39;s original Brotherhood, Genesis&#39; team is composed of Omega-level mutants who have trained and fought together for centuries, making them an unstoppable force.   Orchis, the current antagonist, is unprepared for the strength and unity of the new Brotherhood, positioning them as the mutants&#39; last hope in the upcoming battle to save their kind.

## Literature Review

Genesis ushers in the newest era of the Brotherhood, and they&#39;re far more advanced than the original team - possibly spelling doom for Orchis. 




Contains spoilers for X-Men Red #18!!Orchis&#39; relentless onslaught and the Genesis War, which has kept several powerful mutants occupied elsewhere, have the X-Men and mutantkind running on empty. Now, Storm has officially defeated Genesis and freed her from Annihilation&#39;s influence, allowing Apocalypse&#39;s other half to start yet another new chapter in the fight against Orchis. With two of her children at her side, Genesis has created the newest, most powerful iteration of the Brotherhood.




X-Men Red #18 by Al Ewing, Yildiray Çinar, and Federico Blee brings an end to the bloody Genesis War. Storm and her forces come out victorious after she destroys the staff that has kept Genesis trapped beneath Annihilation&#39;s whispering and corruption. As punishment for the civil war, Arakko&#39;s Great Ring chooses to exile Genesis.



          

Even in exile, Genesis is hardly ready to give up on battle. She announces her new Brotherhood, along with her children, War and Famine. As the three of them prepare to face Orchis, who &#34;aimed [them] like a weapon&#34;, they make up the most powerful version of the team thus far - easily outstripping Magneto&#39;s original lineup. 


 Genesis&#39; Brotherhood is the Fiercest in History 
          




When Magneto formed the original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, he recruited a cast of rejected mutants like Toad and indebted (yet unseasoned) fighters such as Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Although they had a range of impressive abilities between them, they were largely untrained when it came to fighting as a team. In addition, Magneto tended to use violence and intimidation to keep them in line (a tactic he later admitted to regretting), rather than work to inspire real loyalty. While they proved to be a thorn in the X-Men&#39;s side, the team eventually fell apart and multiple members went on to be far more successful under different leadership and causes. Genesis&#39; new Brotherhood faces none of the same roadblocks.

Instead, she is joined by two of her children with Apocalypse. War and Famine, along with their mother, are Omega-level mutants. They both possess incredibly long lifespans, like their parents. War has demonstrated impressive fire-based abilities, even forging an entirely new hand from flame following a battle with Wolverine, while Famine has similar skill with water. Genesis has formidable control of plants - and so much more. Beyond what their mutant abilities grant them, they&#39;ve both fought at their mother&#39;s side in an endless succession of battles. Their loyalties have been tested and proven time and time again, as has their prowess in battle. They rank among the most powerful mutants still alive and act as extensions of Genesis, making the new Brotherhood one solid unit of war.






 Orchis is Not Prepared for the New Brotherhood 


          

Since Magneto&#39;s original lineup, the Brotherhood has evolved and changed. Mystique brought Destiny, Rogue, and others to the team, and its members have come and gone over the years. Still, none have hundreds of years of endless fighting under their belts, and the might of three Omega mutants acting as one is unmatched. Genesis nearly brought ruin to Arakko and its people, but now she can turn that same energy and skill toward bringing down Orchis. Given the damage Orchis has already done to mutantkind, the mutants need the win. As the X-Men gear up to face Orchis and save their people, Genesis and her Brotherhood could be the unexpected cavalry.
