# Star Trek Confirms Starfleet Has Finally Rescinded Its Brutal General Order 7 Death Sentence


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek: Defiant #10 confirms that Starfleet has repealed General Order Seven, a brutal law that put to death anyone attempting contact with the Talosians.   The law seemed out of step with Star Trek&#39;s progressive ideals, but it was implemented due to the harrowing experience Captain Pike had with the Talosians, who intended to use him to sire a new slave race.   While General Order Seven has been repealed, not just anyone can freely visit Talos IV. Permission must be obtained from the highest echelons of Starfleet. Starfleet is cautious about opening up contact with the Talosians.

## Literature Review

Starfleet&#39;s General Order 7 was a weird rule in the Star Trek universe, but now it has been repealed--with interesting results.




Warning: contains spoilers for Star Trek: Defiant #10!




Star Trek has confirmed that Starfleet finally rescinded its most brutal rule: General Order Seven. This law, which put to death anyone attempting contact with the mysterious Talosians, was, at the time of the Original Series, the only such law left on the books. Yet even then, the law seemed out of step with Star Trek’s progressive ideals, but in Star Trek: Defiant #10, it is confirmed the rule has been repealed.

Star Trek: Defiant #10 is written by Christopher Cantwell and drawn by Mike Feehan and Pow Rodrix. Worf and the crew of the Defiant are hunting Berlinghoff Rasmussen, who has absconded to Talos IV, seeking to harness its inhabitants&#39; mental powers for his own ends.

          

Readers learn that by the 24th century, not only had General Order Seven been struck down, but Starfleet even permitted limited contact with the Talosians. 





 Starfleet Meant Business With General Order Seven 
          

No details were given on exactly when General Order Seven was rescinded, but it would have been between Kirk’s first five-year mission and the late 24th century. Kirk’s predecessor, Captain Pike, made first contact with the Talosians, and it was a harrowing experience. The Talosians held Pike prisoner, intending to use him to sire a new slave race. As a result of the encounter, and the fear of what the Talosians could do, Starfleet quarantined the system, implementing General Order Seven, which threatened the death penalty on anyone visiting it. Now, Starfleet has reversed course on General Order Seven, which is fortunate for Worf and his crew.

Curiosities such as General Order Seven litter the franchise, particularly during its early years as Gene Roddenberry and his collaborators fleshed the mythos out. At the time of the production of the Original Series, capital punishment was still very much a fact of life in America. A majority of Star Trek’s audience were familiar with the death penalty and many of them may have even supported it. Viewers in the 1960s were not as shocked at such concepts, including Star Trek’s creative staff, so they thought nothing of Starfleet doing it too.




                  Star Trek Confirms a Classic Element of UFO Lore Exists in Its Universe   1998&#39;s Star Trek: The Untold Voyages revealed a key race from real-world UFO lore exists in its universe, and they are a galaxy-sized threat.   



 General Order Seven Was a True Star Trek Anomaly 
          

Star Trek has taken great strides to present an inclusive and progressive vision of humanity’s future, and such a harsh law is incongruous with this world view. For Starfleet to have put General Order Seven into place shows how the organization viewed the Talosians. Starfleet would rather kill someone than let the Talosians’ power fall into potentially the wrong hands. Pike’s first meeting with the Talosians was a disaster, but time apparently heals all wounds, as Starfleet has repealed the rule. However, a text piece reveals that not just anyone can go, and must obtain permission from the highest echelons of Starfleet. Starfleet is not ready to open Talos yet.
