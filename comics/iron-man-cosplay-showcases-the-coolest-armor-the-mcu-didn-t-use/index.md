## Literature Review

From the comic book pages to the cosplay stage, a cosplayer debuts one of Tony Stark&#39;s coolest Iron Man suits that the MCU neglected to use.




An exceptionally talented cosplayer unveils one of Tony Stark&#39;s coolest Iron Man suits that Marvel left untouched in its cinematic universe. Despite the slim chances of this elite suit gracing the silver screen anytime soon, it appears fans are satisfied with preserving the armor&#39;s legacy through cosplay. In terms of canonical appearances, there&#39;s optimism that this one-of-a-kind suit might stage a comeback in the pages of comics.




CarnageCosplay has recently graced Instagram with an extraordinary Iron Man costume that is undoubtedly one of the coolest and rarest to date. This cosplay masterpiece brings to life Tony&#39;s Model-Prime Armor, also known as the Model 51, displayed in its stealth mode.


 

First introduced in Free Comic Book Day 2015 (Avengers) #1 by Mark Waid and Mahmud Asrar, the Model 51 has now resurfaced almost a decade later, captivating the cosplay community. The remarkable quality of this portrayal serves as a stark reminder that Marvel missed a golden opportunity by not featuring this spectacular suit in its cinematic universe.


 Cosplayer Debuts Iron Man’s Model-Prime Armor in Stealth Mode 

 




While the still photos of CarnageCosplay&#39;s Iron Man cosplay are undeniably breathtaking, the true badassery of this rendition takes center stage in the uploaded video. This video elevates the costume to an entirely new level, offering a proper showcase of the suit&#39;s impeccable craftsmanship. Witnessing the suit illuminated and in action is what genuinely breathes life into it, highlighting the intricacies of its stealth mode design. This larger-than-life cosplay was unsurprisingly a collaborative effort, featuring the contributions of four other exceptionally talented artists. Walsh3D provided the helmet, Neon contributed the arc, Rust-Oleum executed the flawless paint job, and Ethan Persinger skillfully crafted the sword and shield for the suit.

Bringing the Model 51 to life in its stealth mode through cosplay highlights the overlooked potential of Marvel not incorporating this suit into the MCU. Surprisingly, a model considered by many fans as Iron Man&#39;s greatest suit never found its way into Marvel&#39;s cinematic universe. Despite the numerous Iron Man suits featured in the movies, it&#39;s astonishing that this fan-favorite didn&#39;t make the final selection. Fortunately, CarnageCosplay has skillfully filled the void left by Marvel, presenting an exceptional rendition of this beloved suit that not only pays homage to its greatness but also showcases the creativity and talent within the cosplay community.






 If the MCU Isn’t an Option, Iron Man’s Model 51 Suit Should Return in Comics 

 

Given Tony is still dead in MCU continuity, the chances of witnessing this suit on the silver screen remain unlikely. Fortunately, dedicated cosplayers like CarnageCosplay have stepped in, breathing life into the suit and offering fans the next best thing. As interest in the Model 51 suit grows through cosplay, there&#39;s hope that the MCU takes notice, potentially integrating the suit into future Iron Man MCU projects or in the ongoing Iron Man comic runs. CarnageCosplay&#39;s portrayal has reignited fascination with Iron Man&#39;s Model-Prime Armor, leaving fans eagerly anticipating more glimpses, whether through stunning cosplays or the pages of comics.
