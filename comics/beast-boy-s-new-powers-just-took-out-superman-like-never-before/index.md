# Beast Boy s New Powers Just Took Out Superman Like Never Before


## SUMMARY 



  Beast Boy&#39;s spores are turning people into animal/human hybrids, and even Superman isn&#39;t safe from their influence.   Superman is constantly on the move to avoid attracting Beast Boy&#39;s spores, while Lois directs him to people in need.   Superman can&#39;t fight Beast Boy directly or turn himself into a target, but he is still protecting others from being infected by the spores.

## Literature Review

The now-villainous Beast Boy is ravaging the DC Universe and thanks to his power-seeking spores, the one person who canâ€™t save the day is Superman.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis #1!With Beast Boy&#39;s monstrous new form endangering the world, even a hero as mighty as Superman isn&#39;t safe. Garfield Logan has just lost his mind and has become a rampaging beast known as Garro. Nothing is able to stop him and even the Man of Steel is at risk of falling to Beast Boy&#39;s influence.




In Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis #1&#39;s story &#34;Don&#39;t Stop: A Tale From Beast World&#34; by Zipporah Smith, Joshua Williamson, and Edwin Galmon, Lois Lane is hiding in the Fortress of Solitude as Beast Boy&#39;s spores are wreaking havoc on the world.

          

Superman, on the other hand, is constantly on the move. The spores are attracted to power, meaning Clark can&#39;t stay in one place for too long. So Superman travels around the world saving whomever he can while Lois directs him to people in need. Unfortunately, the Garro spores swarm the Fortress of Solitude, mistaking its Kryptonian power sources for Superman.


 Beast Boy&#39;s Spores Are Attracted to Power Like Supeman&#39;s 
          




The DC Universe came under attack by a terrifying monster known as a Necrostar, and the only person who could stop it was Beast Boy. Gar turned himself into a Starro the Conqueror-like monster to fight off the violent alien and actually succeeded. Unfortunately, Amanda Waller sprung into action and sent her latest weapon, Doctor Hate, to mind-wipe Beast Boy. Now all that remains is Garro, an asteroid-sized monster out to destroy Earth. Making the situation worse is Beast Boy&#39;s spores, which have spread throughout the planet and begun turning people into animal/human hybrids.

Thankfully, the radically changed Beast Boy hasn&#39;t yet taken control of Superman. But because his spores are drawn to power, he&#39;s effectively taken the Man of Tomorrow off the board. Lois says it herself: the Earth can&#39;t risk someone with Superman&#39;s powers risk being corrupted. As it stands right now, Clark can&#39;t fight this threat head-on and turn himself into a target for power-seeking spores. But he also can&#39;t sit on the sidelines. The best thing for Clark right now is to keep moving from place to place, saving as many people as he possibly can. It&#39;s not perfect, but the DCU needs as many hands as possible playing defense, and unfortunately, that&#39;s all Superman can do right now.






 Superman Can&#39;t Stop Moving or Fight Back 
          

When calamity strikes, it&#39;s in Superman&#39;s nature to stop whatever threat has come around. But Clark knows he&#39;d be imperiling his world even more if he turned into an animal hybrid like the others. The only thing that could make this bad situation worse is if someone as powerful as Clark became a wolf (like how Batman&#39;s about to). Thankfully Superman can still be put to use by protecting others from being infected by the spores. It&#39;s not ideal, but as long as Beast Boy&#39;s endangering the world, Superman has to limit himself to protect the world.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Metropolis #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
