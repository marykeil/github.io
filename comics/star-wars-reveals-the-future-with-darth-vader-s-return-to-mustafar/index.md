Star Wars is about to reveal the future as Darth Vader returns to Mustafar once more following the events of The Empire Strikes Back.

To that end, it certainly looks like there&#39;s a lot to be excited about in 2024.

Revealed by StarWars.com, Darth Vader is returning to Mustafar and his imposing castle. 2023&#39;s Star Wars: Revelations #1 will also feature six other stories coming from a variety of talents such as Charles Soule, Andrea DiVito, Cavan Scott, Marika Cresta, Alyssa Wong, David BaldeÃ³n, Greg Pak, and Salvador Larroca, each of them connecting to the main Star Wars series, The High Republic, Darth Vader, and more.

 Star Wars Revelations Will Offer A First Look At 2024 Stories 
Including The New Mace Windu Series
          

Coming from Marc Bernardin and Will Silney, 2024&#39;s upcoming Mace Windu series should prove to be very exciting, offering new details into the life of the Jedi Council&#39;s leading Jedi Master alongside Grandmaster Yoda. As teased by this new preview for Revelations, it looks as though Windu is undercover, giving Star Wars fans a new opportunity to see the Jedi Master in action, hopefully wielding his iconic purple-bladed lightsaber. That said, the teasers for Jango Fett and Jabba the Hutt should prove to be very exciting as well.




That being said, there&#39;s a lot to look forward to from Marvel&#39;s ongoing Star Wars series set in between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. With the Dark Droids crossover nearing its end, it will be exciting to see what&#39;s next in 2024 for both Star Wars and Darth Vader. Likewise, The High Republic has just begun its third phase of stories, revealing the aftermath of Starlight Beacon&#39;s destruction. As a result, Star Wars: Revelations #1 (2023) is a one-shot fans won&#39;t want to miss.

Star Wars: Revelations #1 (2023) releases December 20th from Marvel Comics.
