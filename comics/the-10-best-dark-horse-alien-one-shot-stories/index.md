## Literature Review

Some of the greatest Alien stories ever told were published under Dark Horse Comics, and a great number of those were one-shots. Here&#39;s that 10 best! 




There has been no shortage of Alien stories told outside the continuity of the films, especially after Dark Horse Comics championed an entirely new continuity stemming from 1986’s Aliens, and then branched off into increasingly wild and interesting storylines.
While a number of those were limited series that would be woven together into an enormous tapestry of incredibly rich lore, some Alien storylines didn’t need more than a single comic issue (or stand-alone storyline) to adequately tell their tale. Here are the 10 best Alien one-shot stories from Dark Horse Comics!

 10  An Entire Xenomorph Hive Is Taken Out… By A Pig 
Aliens: Pig by Chuck Dixon and Flint Henry


 







When a team of space pirates and their pig come across a Xenomorph hive on a distant world containing valuable materials they can make a profit off of, every member of the crew gets the same crazy idea: strap a bomb to the pig and send him in. While the plan goes a bit off the rails, the original idea ends up working perfectly (though none of the crewmates survive to reap the rewards).
The pig goes in, the Xenomorphs chase him around, and he eventually detonates, marking the first time in Alien history that an entire horde of Xenomorphs was taken out by a single pig.





 9  Alien’s Xenomorphs Can Be Used To Grow Hybridized Synthetics 
Aliens: Purge by Ian Edginton and Phil Hester


 







There have been a number of Xenomorph hybrids throughout the Alien franchise, including hybridizations of Synthetics. However, the hybrid in this Alien one-shot stands above the rest as being the most unique of the bunch, as she wasn’t a Synthetic infused with and mutated by Xenomorph DNA, she was a Synthetic grown from the altered reproductive system of a Xenomorph Queen.
Aliens: Purge also leaned into the idea that Xenomorphs communicate through a psychic link as opposed to pheromones or any other proposed form of communication, and that this link could be exhibited in humans infected with a Xenomorph embryo.





 8  Ancient Humans Gave Xenomorphs A Terrifying New Name 
Aliens: Stalker by David Wenzel
        

Long ago, during the age of the Vikings, a Xenomorph found its way to Earth and terrorized the ancient people who came across it. These warriors fought this supposed demon for years, training entire generations of soldiers specifically to undertake the quest of killing it once and for all. They even came up with a new name for the Xenomorph, one that arguably more accurately captures the true essence of the creature: the Crawler.
This story is unlike any Alien comic ever written, and perfectly embodies what a unique and creative standalone one-shot should be.





 7  Aliens Meets ‘Stand By Me’ In This Kid-Led Adventure 
Aliens: Wraith by Jay Stephens and Eduardo Risso


 







A group of kids who are the fourth generation of an off-world agricultural colony gather around a fire and tell each other scary stories of their alien world. One of those stories was about a ‘pale skeleton’ creature called the Wraith that lives in the cave systems under their feet. So, another kid leads the charge to investigate. In the caves, these kids come face-to-face with a Xenomorph, one that’s grown pale and sickly in its isolation, as it was the last of its hive.
This one-shot was a fun and exciting coming of age adventure at first, until all the children were gunned down by company-owned soldiers maintaining secrecy surrounding the Xenomorph - a grim reminder that Alien is not a family-friendly franchise.





 6  A Primitive Colony Sacrifices Babies To A Xenomorph 
Aliens: Sacrifice by Peter Milligan and Paul Johnson
        

A space farer crash lands on a primitive colony and is taken in by the locals. They’re plagued by visions of their spaceship on fire, and their fellow crew members burning to a crisp before their very eyes. After two days, they’re able to walk around the village and meet the other settlers, only to uncover a dark secret being kept by the whole community. There’s a lone Xenomorph plaguing them in this world, and to satiate it, the villagers ritualistically sacrifice an infant. Horrified by this truth, the survivor comes up with a plan to kill the beast, and finally convinces the other settlers to go along with it.
In the end, they were able to stick a grenade in the Xenomorph’s mouth and blow its head to smithereens. Unfortunately, however, the Xenomorph’s blood splashed in their eyes, leaving them in a world of darkness, once again plagued by the horrific visions of their past.





 5  Alien’s Best Video Game Installment Got A Dark Horse Comics Prelude 
Aliens: Isolation by Dan Abnett and Dion Lay
        

Alien: Isolation chronicled the suspense-filled adventure of Amanda Ripley - the daughter of Ellen Ripley - aboard Sevastopol Station as she tries to avoid getting killed by a rogue Xenomorph. This comic is a prelude to the events of the video game, showing the inner workings of one man’s mind as he has a Facehugger firmly attached to his face, implanting the genetic material necessary for the growth of a Xenomorph embryo - and to call his dreams ‘disturbing’ would be a vast understatement.
This comic was initially given away for free at SDCC 2014 at the Alien: Isolation booth as a promotion for the game, though this story is far more than just a long-form advertisement, it’s a one-shot that’s well worth any Alien fan’s time.





 4  Aliens’ Newt Gets The Horror-Filled Origin Story She Deserves 
Aliens: Newt’s Tale by Mike Richardson and Jim Somerville
        

Anyone who’s seen 1986’s Aliens is familiar with Newt, the little girl on Hadley’s Hope who managed to be the only survivor of the off-world settlement following a Xenomorph outbreak sparked by her own parents. However, what those fans don’t know is what happened between her dad getting impregnated by a Facehugger and Newt being found all alone by Ripley - and that’s where this one-shot comes in.
This suspenseful thriller injects some much-needed horror into the otherwise action-heavy storyline of Aliens, while also giving fans some vital information regarding one of the franchise’s most iconic characters.





 3  Dark Horse Published The Unproduced Screenplay Of An Alternate Alien 3 
William Gibson’s Alien 3 by William Gibson, Johnnie Christmas, and Tamra Bonvillain
        

While it has gained a bit of a cult following over the years, it’s well known that there were issues behind the scenes. Constant rewrites and direction changes resulted in a fairly choppy and inconsistent film that even someone as expertly skilled as David Fincher couldn’t entirely salvage. What’s even more interesting, though, is that the movie fans got wasn’t the only version of it that was written, as an entirely different Alien 3 existed in the mind of William Gibson, and Dark Horse Comics decided to turn it into a reality. This version of Alien 3 didn’t unceremoniously kill Newt and Hicks off-screen, but instead continued their story while also evolving the very nature of the Xenomorph creature itself.
William Gibson’s Alien 3 is an ambitious followup to the fan-favorite Aliens, and while it may not have worked as a movie, it’s an absolutely amazing graphic novel.





 2  The Original Alien Film Almost Looked Very Different 
Alien: The Original Screenplay by Dan O’Bannon, Cristiano Seixas, and Guilherme Balbi
        

Alien 3 isn’t the only film in the franchise with an alternate version that found new life with Dark Horse Comics. In fact, the original 1979 Alien film almost looked very different from what fans got, something that becomes obvious upon reading Alien: The Original Screenplay. While the broad-stroke plot points are basically the same, the standout differences between the produced film and the unproduced screenplay-turned-comic was the aesthetic of the Xenomorph (and Facehugger), along with some differences in the characters.
As a standalone story, this alternate version of Alien is a treat for hardcore fans, as it’s very similar, yet shown through a completely different lens - as if watching a version of the movie from another timeline.





 1  Dark Horse Comics Gives Alien Fans A Comprehensive Guide Through Giger’s Brilliance 
Giger’s Alien - H.R. Giger
        

This is more than just a behind-the-scenes book or a graphic novel detailing an alternate storyline within the meta Alien omniverse, Giger’s Alien is a peek into the creative genius behind the iconic aesthetic of the entire Alien mythos: H.R. Giger. This book contains the concept art for the Xenomorph, the Space Jockey, and the alien world on which the crew of the Nostromo unfortunately found themselves. Giger was able to depict a strange biomechanic hell filled with uncomfortable imagery of sexual deviancy with violent undertones.
Giger’s Alien is a comprehensive guide through the genius of H.R. Giger, and perhaps the most significant one-shot from these 10 Dark Horse Comics Alien stories.
