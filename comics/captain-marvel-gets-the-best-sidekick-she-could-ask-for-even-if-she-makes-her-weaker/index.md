## Literature Review

Ever since they started teaming up together, Yuna Yang has simultaneously made Captain Marvel stronger (internally) and weaker (externally).




Warning: Spoilers for Captain Marvel #2!Even though she makes Captain Marvel weaker, the hero has seemingly found the best possible sidekick. Her name is Yuna Yang, who Captain Marvel met when the two became inexptricably linked through the Nega-Bands. The start of the latest Captain Marvel arc has found the pair becoming perfectly in sync with each other.




Captain Marvel #2 – by Alyssa Wong, Jan Bazaloua, Bryan Valenza, and VC&#39;s Ariana Maher – further exhibits the exciting dynamic of Carol and Yuna&#39;s newfound chemistry. Granted, the issue also highlights how Captain Marvel is limited in how much power she can use in order to compensate for working with her new sidekick.

          

Despite the physical restriction placed on Carol by her proximity to Yuna, the way that they are able to work together in unison to compensate for those limitations showcases just how this new sidekick is able to bring the best out of Captain Marvel, even while weakening her.


 Captain Marvel and Yuna Yang Make Perfect Partners 
          




In the first issue of this current Captain Marvel run, Yuna Yang is introduced as a petty thief, who gets caught in the middle of a fight between Genis-Vell and Omen for the Kree Nega-Bands. Omen severs Genis-Vell&#39;s hands at the wrist in an attempt to secure the Bands, but before she can retrieve them, Yuna steals the powerful weapons for herself. The Bands inexplicably bond to Yuna&#39;s wrists, and in turn, she becomes intrinsically linked to Captain Marvel. Whenever Yuna activates the Bands, she and Captain Marvel (currently in the Negative Zone) switch places – creating a fascinating set-up for the series moving forward.

Captain Marvel #2 finds Carol and Yuna learning to navigate the setbacks of this arrangement. While fighting off a newly zombified Genis-Vell – under Omen&#39;s control – Captain Marvel tries to preserve her energy to avoid Yuna switching back with her at a time that immediately puts her in danger. She has to literally pull her punches to sustain her time in the real world a little bit longer. Thankfully, when Carol is outnumbered, after Omen gets involved in the fight directly, she and Yuna find a way to link their minds to help each other get out of this mess with minimal damage.






 Yuna Yang Makes Captain Marvel Stronger (and Weaker) 
          

Although Yuna&#39;s bond with Captain Marvel forces the latter to be physically weaker in fights like this, it also makes her stronger in other ways. For starters, it compels Carol to think more critically in combat, to be more strategic in what she does. Instead of solving every problem with force, she has to think more about what her next move can be, without doing something that wears her out too early. In addition, her situation supports a unique means of teamwork that emphasizes her psychic link to Yuna. This strategy wouldn&#39;t work for everyone, but Captain Marvel makes it work with the best possible sidekick for her current adventure. 



Captain Marvel #2 is on sale now from Marvel.
