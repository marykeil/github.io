# Jujutsu Kaisen Has One Power That Can Kill Sukuna Higuruma s Cursed Technique Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Higuruma Hiromi, a Grade 1 Sorcerer, has the potential to kill Sukuna and end his reign of terror.   Higuruma&#39;s innate technique uses a domain expansion and a shikigami called Judgeman to determine guilt and deliver justice.   While Higuruma&#39;s technique may be a threat to Sukuna, defeating him will not be easy and Sukuna may have a plan to counter it.

## Literature Review

While the King of Curses must be feeling good after Gojo’s defeat, he faces a more pressing problem in Higuruma Hiromi’s cursed technique.




Jujutsu Kaisen is setting up Hiromi Higuruma as the one character who could kill the almighty Sukuna, despite his scarce appearances in the series. While the main cast of Jujutsu Kaisen always get the lion&#39;s share of attention, of late, it&#39;s been the supporting and secondary characters who have proven themselves to be essential to the story&#39;s progression. It is now time to shine for Grade 1 Sorcerer Higuruma Hiromi.






A Grade 1 Sorcerer is the second-highest formal rank in the Jujutsu Sorcerer community - just under the rank of Special Grade Sorcerer.




Higuruma Hiromi does not appear in Jujutsu Kaisen until Chapter #158 during the Culling Game arc. Megumi and Yuji identify him as one of the few sorcerers in the game who can change the rules, which they need to do to save Megumi&#39;s sister Tsumiki without giving into the rule of the game that they must kill others to continue participating in the game.

          

Indeed, as a criminal defense lawyer in his real life, Hiromi was always interested in rules and guidelines, or their lack of ability to get people to act properly. Accordingly, he volunteered to participate in the Culling Game to ensure that the rules were followed to the letter as doing so - in his mind - would ultimately lead to a better world. As Megumu and Yuji found, when his crack analysis of a person&#39;s guilt is combined with his sorcerer&#39;s skills only a few can escape Higuruma&#39;s judgment.





 Higuruma&#39;s Cursed Technique Delivers Perfect, Inescapable Justice 
          

​​​​Higuruma is the perfect opponent for Sukuna in a number of ways. First, there&#39;s their personalities: one of the most deviant, lawless sorcerers in the history of the world and one who believes that law and justice are everything. It&#39;s no wonder Higurama accepted the challenge of determining Sukuna&#39;s fate. Second, Higuruma&#39;s innate technique can truly end Sukuna&#39;s reign of terror if he is found guilty of the heinous crimes he has been charged with committing.

As explained in Jujutsu Kaisen Chapter # 164, Higuruma&#39;s innate technique has two primary elements. It begins with his domain expansion, which sets up an area of operation where his rules are supreme. The domain is like a courtroom and people trapped inside it are - like a real-life courtroom - forced to abide by the rules that require them to refrain from violence while the hearing is in session. As the domain&#39;s prosecutor, Higuruma must determine - beyond a reasonable doubt - whether the accused is guilty. The defendant also gets a chance to plead his case, but with Higuruma&#39;s expert-level lawyering skills, coming forth with a death-defying testimony rarely occurs.






 Higuruma Alone Probably Won&#39;t Be Enough to Kill Sukuna 
          

The second element of Higuruma&#39;s innate technique is the shikigami known as &#34;Judgeman&#34;. It performs the role of judge and jury in the hearing. Based on the arguments presented, the Judgeman can impose three judgments. First, it can find the defendant innocent -which means they go free. Second, it can find the opponent guilty of a lesser crime. This results in the confiscation of the opponent&#39;s innate technique. Lastly, the Judgeman can find the opponent guilty of a capital or death penalty crime, wherein the punishment is the confiscation of their innate technique and a sentence of death.

If the Judgeman finds the opponent guilty of a capital crime, Higuruma becomes the executioner. His gravel then transforms into the Executioner&#39;s Sword, which can kill anyone with one hit. This would be the best way to get rid of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s strongest villain, but there is still a good chance Sukuna will win his battle with Higuruma. As the sorcerer himself explained, Sukuna may only be found guilty of a minor offense, and he possesses different cursed techniques at the moment, meaning that confiscating one would not necessarily spell his defeat. Also, even if Sukuna is sentenced to death, Higuruma still has to hit him with the Executioner&#39;s sword, which is not an easy feat.




While Sukuna&#39;s physical skills are enough to hold off Higuruma, Yuji is also present, and the two have likely come up with a detailed plan. It will be interesting to see if Higuruma&#39;s cursed technique will really cause the downfall of Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s worst villain Sukuna.
