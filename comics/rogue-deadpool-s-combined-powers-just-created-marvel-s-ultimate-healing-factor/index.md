Uncanny Avengers #5 – by Gerry Duggan, Javier Garron, Morry Hollowell, VC&#39;s Travis Lanham – featured the latest Rogue-Deadpool team-up, putting the duo in their most heated situation yet. Rogue has had to borrow Wade&#39;s powers previously – which shockingly led her to declare the Merc With a Mouth a better kisser than her husband Gambit.



          

What makes this particular instance so significant is how it tests the limitations of Rogue&#39;s powers, while displaying the full potential of Deadpool&#39;s powers.

                  10 Gruesome Deadpool Injuries Readers Can’t Unsee   Deadpool has one of the most impressive healing factors in comic book fiction, which means his injuries can be the most gruesome. Here&#39;s the 10 best!    





 Rogue Doesn&#39;t Need Skin to Absorb Deadpool&#39;s Powers 


          

Currently, Captain America&#39;s Avengers Unity Squad are in conflict with the Mutant Liberation Front, Orchis&#39; mutant terrorist organization led by Captain Krakoa. Those on the team blindly follow the man they think is Scott Summers under the mask, but is soon revealed to be Captain America&#39;s evil HYDRA clone brother, Grant Rogers. He leads the MLF in orchestrating a plan to destroy Empire State University with a nuclear weapon. In Uncanny Avengers #5, Rogue nearly sacrifices herself, flying the bomb to the isolated Area 51. Steve Rogers tries to be optimistic, hoping for Rogue&#39;s survival, but with less than a minute to detonation, her chances are slim.

In a last-ditch effort to save their teammate, Quicksilver runs a legless Wade to Area 51, getting Deadpool to Rogue in time to use his healing factor to save her life, before fleeing the scene himself. As the nuclear bomb detonates, peeling the skin from Rogue&#39;s deteriorating body nearly instantaneously, Deadpool arrives not a microsecond too late, clutching her hand, with his own skin melting off, just before it can kill her. Due to the nature of Wade&#39;s powers, the two skeletons miraculously live through the blast. Rogue thanks Wade, who can&#39;t help but make jokes about Gambit in the moment.






 Deadpool And Rogue&#39;s Combined Powers Make The Ultimate Healing Factor 
          

Deadpool&#39;s healing factor has allowed him to survive some incredulous feats of near-death, so the fact that it can allow him to survive a nuclear blast should not come as a huge surprise. What is a significant revelation is both that Rogue can absorb Deadpool&#39;s powers even without needing skin. It is also worth noting that Deadpool can transfer his powers to Rogue while technically in mid-death. She&#39;s in the process of dying in the middle of the blast, but can enjoy the fruits of Wade&#39;s powers just before her life ends. It&#39;s impressive all across the board, but truly shows how powerful the combined forces of Deadpool and Rogue can be.
