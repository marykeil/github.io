## Literature Review

Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate Universe gets its Black Panther early next year, and two new character redesigns promise a Wakanda like readers have never seen.




A new Black Panther is joining Marvel&#39;s new Ultimate Universe that kicked off in Jonathan Hickman and Bryan Hitch&#39;s Ultimate Invasion series, and he&#39;s bringing with him new versions of Storm and Killmonger. Ultimate Black Panther promises not just a new take on T&#39;Challa, but also a brand-new Wakanda and new versions of everyone&#39;s favorite characters there. Written by Bryan Hill (Blade) with art by Stefano Caselli (Ultimate Universe), Wakanda and its people will be the last force standing against Moon Knight&#39;s takeover of all of Africa.




Readers have already seen a preview of Black Panther&#39;s new Ultimate Universe costume. However, Killmonger and Storm&#39;s new looks just dropped, designed by Marvel&#39;s hardest-working artist, Peach Momoko. She said of the redesigns, &#34;Getting to design for Storm and Killmonger, I wanted to respect the characters and also put in my soul and unique vision into them.&#34; The pair show up as freedom fighters who have been trying to stop Konshu and Ra throughout the rest of Africa.



          

The couple arrive in Wakanda, the last holdout on Earth not controlled by a figure on the villainous Maker&#39;s council, to convince King T&#39;Challa to step out of the shadows and fight.


 Storm and Killmonger Are Two of Black Panther&#39;s Most Vital Characters 
         




Storm has long been T&#39;Challa&#39;s on-again, off-again love interest. In some of Ororo&#39;s origin stories, Black Panther saves her when she&#39;s still a teen, and this crush is the catalyst for their relationship. They eventually married, though massive the events of Avengers vs. X-Men caused them to face off against each other. Killmonger sometimes starts alongside T&#39;Challa, acting as a peer or teacher, but eventually shows his true colors and challenges him - for his throne, for the Black Panther name, or for the future of Wakanda itself. However, Storm and Killmonger don&#39;t have as much interaction with each other, so introducing them together is one of the many ways the new Ultimate Universe builds on the unexplored in Marvel stories.

As established in Ultimate Invasion, the Maker traveled to the new Ultimate Universe, Earth-6160, and conspired to rid the world of all of its superheroes. Due to Wakanda&#39;s reclusive nature, it&#39;s likely that Black Panther still exists because the Maker couldn&#39;t penetrate the nation&#39;s defenses. However, Wakanda&#39;s isolationism also means that Black Panther hasn&#39;t stepped up at all to put a stop to him. When Storm and Killmonger arrive in Ultimate Black Panther #3, it will mark a huge turning point for this universe&#39;s T&#39;Challa, and show how powerful the pair have become to evade capture or death from the Council and Moon Knight.






 Recruiting Ultimate Black Panther Will Be a Huge Win for the Ultimate Avengers 
          

The Ultimate Avengers are trying to set their world right while the Maker is temporarily incapacitated. Iron Lad and Doctor Doom have freed Thor from an Asgardian prison, and have Captain America on ice, but no way to thaw him yet. Not only is Black Panther a strong fighter, he&#39;s a brilliant strategist and comes with a technologically-advanced nation&#39;s army. If Killmonger and Storm can convince him to step onto the world stage, they may also be able to get him to work with the Avengers. Considering he has more to offer them than they have to offer him, Black Panther may need some convincing from character like Storm and Killmonger to team up.
