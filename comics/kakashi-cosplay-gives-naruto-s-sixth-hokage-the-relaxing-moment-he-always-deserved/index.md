## Literature Review

In an awesome new cosplay, Naruto fan-favorite Kakashi Hatake finally finds time in his busy schedule as Hokage to enjoy a favorite meal.




There are few jobs in Naruto as demanding as the Hokage, a position made all the more burdensome when you&#39;re as relaxed, introverted, and responsibility-averse as Kakashi Hatake. But in a slick new presentation of Naruto cosplay, the Sixth Hokage can finally enjoy a few moments of rest and relaxation with a steaming hot bowl of savory soup ramen.




As shared on Reddit&#39;s /r/Cosplay page, cosplayer Nightcrawler11 brings Kakashi to life posing as the talented shinobi in the customary Jonin uniform of a green flak jacket, over a black long-sleeved shirt with the standard red Uzumaki patch, and matching black pants. This cosplay outfit also includes Kakashi&#39;s telltale personal accessories - cut-off black gloves and black neck wrap/face mask.


 

What makes the cosplay even more striking is Nightcrawler11&#39;s physical resemblance to Kakashi - a fact made even more mesmerizing by the spiky white-silver hair sticking out over and under Kakashi&#39;s ever-present forehead protector. As one commentator of the cosplay says, this is exactly what fans imagined Kakashi would look like in real life, and the cosplayer taking the picture in an actual ramen shop makes it even more realistic.





 Kakashi&#39;s Hard Knock Life As Hokage 

 

Kakashi was one of the most talented shinobi of his generation, but unlike his contemporaries such as Might Guy, Kakashi shunned attention. He preferred to keep to himself and operate in the background. This was one of the reasons he excelled as a Konoha Anbu covert agent. However, due to his immense talent and skills, it was hard to avoid the attention of senior shinobi and Konoha government officials. Accordingly, when the Fifth Hokage Tsunade decided to retire, her choice for replacement was Kakashi. Despite having no interest in the position, Kakashi ultimately relents for the love of the village and his fellow shinobi citizens.

Naturally, a public-facing job, like the Hokage, with a busy daily schedule of meetings, speeches, outings, and face-to-face conversations with villagers is anathema to Kakahshi&#39;s natural introversion. Indeed, being Hokage was an energy-draining, mind-numbing, exercise in perseverance for Kakashi. Accordingly, as Nightcrawler11&#39;s cosplay makes clear, getting away from the office for a bit of &#34;self-time&#34; amidst all the pressure of the positions was probably Kakashi&#39;s favorite part of the role. Away from the responsibilities of office, he could once again enjoy the pleasure of being left alone in the privacy of his own company.






 Kakushi Loves A Good Bowl Of Ramen 
          

Nightcrawler11 truly showcases his talent as a cosplay artist by not only embodying Kakashi&#39;s character but also placing him in a setting that fans of the story would easily recognize. In this case, he portrays Kakashi about to enjoy a bowl of ramen. Although Naruto is mainly known as the ramen-loving character among fans, Kakashi&#39;s fondness for the savory noodle dish is just as intense, if not stronger. Like Naruto, Kakashi can often be found having a bowl of noodles at Chef Teuchi&#39;s Ichiraku Ramen shop. Indeed, some of Naruto&#39;s funniest stories, such as Naruto Episode #101, revolve around Kakashi eating ramen. Nightcrawler11&#39;s focus on Kakashi&#39;s love of noodles is the perfect detail in an otherwise stellar cosplay.
