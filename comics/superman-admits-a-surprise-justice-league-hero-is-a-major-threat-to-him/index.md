## Literature Review

Superman witnesses a grand display of power and reveals the one member of the Justice League that has a legit chance of taking him down.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Green Lantern #6!Out of all the members of the Justice League, one hero presents a surprising threat to Superman. A battle between two nemeses is rocking the DC Universe. But the Man of Steel can&#39;t get involved thanks to one set of powers that could do some serious damage to him and other Kryptonians.




In Green Lantern #6 by Jeremy Adams, Xermanico, and Scott Godlewski, Hal Jordan is fighting his greatest enemy Sinestro, who has started channeling Red Lantern energy. Across the globe, Superman, Superboy, and Supergirl witness the surge of power as Conner notes how hard it is for him to think.

         

Superman reminds his allies that the Emotional Spectrum&#39;s energies can give off radiation similar to kryptonite. Rather than getting involved, Clark suggests that they focus more on saving innocent civilians in the area while Hal focuses on taking down Sinestro. Unfortunately, Green Lantern seems in over his head facing off against his unrestrained archenemy.


 Superman Confirms Green Lantern&#39;s Energy Can Replicate Kryptonite Radiation 
          




When it comes to Superman, there are very few people in the DC Universe, hero or villain, that have the power to stop him. Several of Clark&#39;s allies in the Justice League, most notably Batman, have revealed contingencies or moves that they could use to stop Superman if need be. However, Clark&#39;s overwhelming Kryptonian power is simply too powerful for most other heroes. The only surefire way of stopping someone like Clark is to utilize several of his proven Achilles&#39; heels such as red solar rays or magic. But even then, it&#39;d be hard to do some major damage to Superman without at least using kryptonite.

Fortunately for Green Lantern, he doesn&#39;t need the irradiated space rocks at all. Apparently, the Green Light of Will can do everything that kryptonite can do without needing the actual thing. There&#39;s actually a precedence for this as Green Lantern&#39;s Power Ring used to be able to make kryptonite in the Silver Age. However, this ability hasn&#39;t been seen in some time and it was up in the air whether Hal or other Lanterns retained this power. But if the radiation given off by Sinestro and Hal&#39;s fight was enough to impair Superboy&#39;s thinking, then Green Lantern could replicate that radiation intentionally to harm Superman.






 Green Lantern is the Best Anti-Superman Contingency 
          

While Superman has proven time and time again that nothing can stop him from being the stalwart hero that he is, it doesn&#39;t hurt to know that there&#39;s a way of countering his immense strength and powers. All Green Lantern would need to do is create a construct of kryptonite that generates the same kind of radiation and Superman is done for. Not to mention constructs are generally more powerful the greater the user&#39;s willpower is, and if anyone has tremendous willpower, it&#39;s Hal Jordan. There are lot of capable heroes in the Justice League, but if anyone has the power to take down Superman, it&#39;s Green Lantern.

Green Lantern #6 is on sale December 12th from DC Comics.
