Now, with the spirit of Toctolissica inside her, and her demon sister Quispe beside her, Mercy heads to 1930s Hollywood - a different golden age with gods of its own. Will Mercy&#39;s newfound star power be enough to hold the past at bay, or will the power of the gods force her into the bloody center of a conflict even she can&#39;t survive?







 Mercy&#39;s Journey Mirrors Elements of Game of Thrones &amp; Quantum Leap 
                  It&#39;s a Very Sci-Fi Christmas in Exclusive Preview for Top Cow&#39;s ANTARCTICA #6   Despite the hot chocolate and Christmas movies, all is not as it seems in this preview for ANTARCTICA #6, as exclusively shared by Screen Rant.   

          

Discussing the series, EP1T0ME Creative Director Lee Thomas compares St. Mercy: Godland to popular fantasy series, saying, &#34;Mercy&#39;s journey feels unique and unexpected, and reminds us of the eclectic journeys of Game of Thrones&#39;s Arya Stark or Quantum Leap&#39;s Sam Beckett.&#34; This comparison is fitting of the journey Mercy has had thus far, thanks to her time-traveling and surprising combat skills. This series&#39; heroine is determined and has taken her challenges on throughout multiple centuries. It has been a bloody story with plenty of horror elements thus far, with Hollywood&#39;s Golden Era set as the next destination.




Series writer, John Platten says, &#34;No matter where Mercy goes or what era she&#39;s in, she can&#39;t escape her curse. In GODLAND, while the setting shifts from the Wild West to what was then called Hollywoodland, Mercy&#39;s unwanted duty remains the same - protect the Incan gold, death be damned.&#34;

Atilio Rojo adds, &#34;Mercy is relentless; we cannot wait for readers to reunite with her, to see our vision of 1930s Hollywood, to meet the new cast from that era, and to experience the wild action scenes.&#34;

St. Mercy: Godland #1 will be available on April 10 from Top Cow Productions, Inc.
