## Literature Review

Wolverine is finally getting the live-action look he deserves in next year&#39;s Deadpool 3, but until then, this cosplay design is the next best thing!




Hugh Jackman’s iconic take on Wolverine is officially getting a comic-accurate yellow and blue costume in next year’s Deadpool 3. But before Wade Wilson and Logan can partake in their usual superhero shenanigans in their transition to the MCU proper, a new Marvel cosplay has brought to life a look that beats the debut of Wolverine’s latest live-action appearance by months, showing fans what’s in store for their favorite X-Men character on the big screen come 2024.




Shared on social media via Reddit and posted on the r/cosplay channel, username u/mikedastardly is no stranger when it comes to creating stunning homemade cosplay designs, with his favorite go-to character being the only superhero who’s the best at what he does, Wolverine.


 

Also dressing in different Wolverine costumes like his dark-toned X-Force threads, skimpy Weapon X outfit, and even his “cowboy” look complete with a cowboy hat and jeans, u/mikedastardly has found success cosplaying as Captain America, Thor, Shadowman, and more, and always seems to find ways to impress with each new custom creation.

                  Wolverine Cosplay Gives Him a Midnight Suns Costume Marvel Needs to See   Someone get Marvel on the phone. They need to see this kickass Wolverine cosplay, which reimagines his Midnight Sun design even better than canon.   





 Wolverine Cosplay Brings His Deadpool 3 Design To Life Before The Movie 
          

A signature yellow and blue costume that Wolverine first wore way back in his 1974 debut — a design that’s now synonymous with the character thanks in part to 1975’s Giant Size X-Men #1 and the fan-favorite X-Men: The Animated Series show from the 90s — Logan has had more than few changes in wardrobe over the years, yet always reverts to this iconic look sooner rather than later. And while no live-action design has come close to adapting this comic outfit, Deadpool 3 released a sneak peek of Hugh Jackman donning the costume to much acclaim, with u/mikedastardly now giving his own take on a look that fans can’t get enough of.

Substituting the blue in the costume for black, u/mikedastardly nails the transition from comic panel to real world with a cosplay that already comes across as Hollywood-ready. Photographed close in the first image of the post, u/mikedastardly shows off his adamantium claws as they snikt out of his black-gloved hand, hiding his helmeted Wolverine behind razor-sharp weapons of destruction. Seen head-to-toe in all of his glory in the following two photos, the stark contrast between u/mikedastardly’s yellow suit and black accents and accessories really helps this design pop off the screen. Assuming a berserker position in the final image, u/mikedastardly gives his best Wolverine snarl, solidifying this cosplay as one of the best takes on Logan’s character ever seen in the community.






 Wolverine&#39;s Classic Costume Gets A Cosplay Design The MCU Needs 
          

So although a true comic-accurate outfit for Wolverine is almost upon us, it’s good to know that talented creators like u/mikedastardly are around to help satiate fans patiently waiting for a live-action design they’ve wanted to see brought to life on the big screen for decades now. Wolverine has been rocking his orange and brown costume in X-Men comics as of late, so a return to form with a cosplay look adapting his classic uniform is not only a treat for fans of the character, but an exciting tease for what’s in store for the MCU.
