This four-issue series will feature four interlocking tales from a variety of writers and artists.

The primary cover for the series&#39; debut issue has already been revealed, but Oni Press has provided Screen Rant with an exclusive look at its variant covers.





 Barry Gifford&#39;s Acclaimed Novel Comes to Comics with Stunning Art &amp; Covers 
         

Variant cover artists Oni Press has announced for Night People include J.H. Williams III, Joëlle Jones, Jacob Phillips, and Brian Level. Williams is known for his work on Sandman: Overture and Promethea. Jones has worked on numerous comics including Wonder Girl and Lady Killer. Phillips&#39; previous works include That Texas Blood and Newburn. Level&#39;s work has been seen in Poison Ivy and Lazarus. The newly revealed covers above highlight their artistic talents and ability to capture the thematic thrills that lie in wait for readers of Night People. This series serves as a parable punctuated by smears of lipstick, sweat, and blood. Check out the debut issue&#39;s synopsis here:


In our first tale of desperation, fanaticism, and murder, as told by Gifford, Condon, and Level, two ex-convicts - a pair of inseparable lovers named Big Betty Stalcup and Miss Cutie Early - are out on parole using their newfound freedom to purify the world of men&#39;s evil influence...and leave a trail of mutilated bodies in their wake. As the psychotic dimensions of their star-crossed romance - and the twisting paths that first led them to their fateful meeting at the Fort Sumatra Detention Center for Wayward Woman - come into full view, their experiment in righteousness culminates in the kidnapping of Rollo Lamar, a kindly attorney whom Betty and Cutie abduct just to see if they can reeducate at least one man on the planet before the demise of civilization.







 Night People Provides Unique Artistic Approaches to Each Issue 
          

Barry Gifford says:


Night People is beyond noir, a parable that embodies both a revision of the past and riddle for the present, informed by the Church on the One Hand and the Church on the Other Hand that portends a future wherein whomever is left on the planet are cast forth on an even more mysterious and perilous voyage on a ghost ship sailing into the Sea of Red. As evidenced by this powerful graphic representation of my novel, the quest for a safe harbor is neverending.


Chris Condon, writer of Oni Press&#39; new adapted series, adds:


Each issue is unique in terms of story, so it makes sense to have each issue have a different, unique artistic approach. I&#39;m so thrilled to see the artistic powerhouses Oni Press has brought onboard to tackle this adaptation with me. The way Barry&#39;s book works is that you never know what turns it will take or what characters you&#39;ll be following in any particular chapter. We&#39;ve utilized that approach in this adaptation, and I think we&#39;re crafting something that should be exciting for readers and will have them coming back issue after issue to see where this wild story is going to go next.





Night People #1 will be available March 6, 2024 from Oni Press.
