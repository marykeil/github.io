# Batman Finally Admits The Bat-Signal Does the Exact Opposite of What He Wanted


## SUMMARY 



  Batman realizes that the Bat-Signal is counter-intuitive as it reveals his location to criminals, giving them time to commit crimes elsewhere.   The Bat-Signal, while iconic, has a major flaw - it lets criminals know where Batman is heading, allowing them to act with impunity elsewhere.   Batman acknowledges that the Bat-Signal doesn&#39;t make much sense, as it goes against his ninja-like stealth and reliance on fear.

## Literature Review

The Bat-Signal is one of the most iconic symbols in Batman&#39;s entire mythos, but only recently has he realized how it might backfire on him.





Summary

  Batman realizes that the Bat-Signal is counter-intuitive as it reveals his location to criminals, giving them time to commit crimes elsewhere.   The Bat-Signal, while iconic, has a major flaw - it lets criminals know where Batman is heading, allowing them to act with impunity elsewhere.   Batman acknowledges that the Bat-Signal doesn&#39;t make much sense, as it goes against his ninja-like stealth and reliance on fear.  







From his Bat-suit to the Batmobile, Batman has many classic symbols and gadgets, but the most iconic is without a doubt the Bat-Signal. Whenever there&#39;s a major crime going on — or Gordon just wants to scare some criminals — the Commissioner will flash the Bat-Signal in the sky to get Batman&#39;s attention. Recently, Batman has finally noticed how counter-intuitive the Bat-Signal actually is.

As Batman is training to regain his memory after a bout of amnesia in the story &#34;Pygmalion&#34; by Guillem March and Arif Prianto from Batman: The Brave and the Bold #7, he ends up seeing the Bat-Signal in the sky. Still wanting to function as Batman despite the memory loss, he heads over to the Bat-Signal to see what Gordon wants. This results in the amnesiac Batman commenting on what a potentially bad idea the Bat-Signal is.

          




Since Batman cares about his secret identity, he can&#39;t exactly give the police a phone number or something, but what he has done is instead give criminals an exact way to know where he is. While it&#39;s meant to strike fear in the hearts of criminals, it instead lets every criminal know that Batman is busy at the GCPD headquarters.

                  Batman&#39;s Bat-Signal Has Been Transformed Into A Deadly Weapon   In DC vs. Vampires, Batman&#39;s Bat-Signal was just turned into a deadly weapon, as its activation is the perfect vampire killer in the dark universe.   


 Batman Realizes the Bat-Signal Tells Criminals He&#39;s Occupied 


          

The Bat-Signal has existed for decades in Batman&#39;s mythos and functions as both a symbol of hope and a way to summon Batman. The signal is supposed to send a message to criminals that Batman is on his way and a message to civilians that help is coming. While these are nice ideas, an amnesiac Batman has a fresh pair of eyes to look at this concept and has noticed a massive flaw. While it&#39;s certainly necessary to be able to summon Batman, the Bat-Signal being on means Batman isn&#39;t actively on the streets; he&#39;s heading to the GCPD, which allows criminals to act with impunity for a period.




When the Bat-Signal hits the sky, every criminal knows exactly where Batman is heading. This means criminals across town have plenty of time to rob a bank or commit some other crime, since Batman is busy at the GCPD. Even if he&#39;s somehow aware of a crime happening across town, there&#39;s no way he could possibly get there in time. This is a huge oversight, considering what the Bat-Signal is meant to do. It&#39;s supposed to strike fear into the hearts of criminals by letting them know Batman is actively moving around the city, but everyone knows where he&#39;s moving to.



 Batman&#39;s Bat-Signal Has One Huge Flaw 
          

The idea of the Bat-Signal never really made much sense on closer scrutiny. Batman is essentially a ninja who relies on fear to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. But he also uses a giant flashlight that announces his presence to everyone to communicate with the police. While there&#39;s no denying that the Bat-Signal is an iconic and important part of Batman&#39;s history, Batman himself has pointed out that it really doesn&#39;t make much sense.
