## Literature Review

Savage Dragon has been one of Image Comics&#39; coolest titles since the &#39;90s, despite being shamefully underrated. Here are 10 stories that prove it! 




Image Comics’ Savage Dragon is a series that is woefully underrated, yet still widely recognized. Even people who have never picked up an issue will find the titular Dragon recognizable. Whether fans were exposed to the character through his action figures or the short-lived ‘90s animated series, the fact that most comic fans know Savage Dragon only speaks to the wider impact the series had on the comic book community as a whole, especially in the collective Image Comics catalog.
While the iconic nature of the character makes the Dragon recognizable even without needing to know a single story arc, that shouldn’t suggest that the comic series itself isn’t worth reading - quite the opposite. Savage Dragon is a rarity in comic book fiction, as it has a cohesive storyline that stretches for decades, with every arc more exciting than the last (and with more than a few other recognizable comic book characters making cameos along the way). Here are 10 stories that prove Savage Dragon is Image Comics’ most underrated series, and why it’s well worth the read!

Spawn is a series rooted in supernatural horror, and the artwork on many of the covers makes that abundantly clear. Here&#39;s the 10 most spine tingling!












 








 10  Savage Dragon’s First Story Arc Establishes An Exciting Mystery 
Savage Dragon #1 by Erik Larsen


 







The very first issue - as all debut issues do - set the stage for the rest of the series, and Savage Dragon did it better than most by immediately establishing an exciting mystery that’s not only initially intriguing, but also keeps readers coming back for more. The Dragon (as the protagonist is known) wakes up in a field on fire, completely unaware of who he is or where he came from, before he’s found by a Chicago Police Officer, and is offered a job on the force.
This mystery wastes no time in making the Dragon an interesting character, with his heroic exploits only perpetuating readers’ collective interest.





 9  Savage Dragon Quickly Introduces a Perfect Arch Enemy for the Dragon: the Fiend

The Fiend is a demonic entity who was originally a man named Arnold Dimple, debuting as a regular (albeit criminally insane) human who killed Dragon’s girlfriend, Debbie Harris. Dimple and Harris used to date, so when he found out she was with Dragon, he killed her in a fit of jealous rage. Dimple then proceeded to make a deal with the devil, gaining demonic powers and becoming the super-villain, the Fiend.
Not only is the Fiend a powerful enemy, but he has a personal connection with the Dragon that only makes their rivalry even more genuine and exciting.





 8  Savage Dragon Gave Fans a Fist Fight Between God and the Devil 
Savage Dragon #31 by Erik Larsen


 







This is perhaps the greatest thing to ever happen in comic book fiction, if not the most irreverent. When Dragon goes to hell, God himself shows up and says that he doesn’t belong there. But the Devil isn’t going to release him without a fight, so - naturally - God sucker-punches Satan right in the face, and the two have a bare-knuckle brawl that ends with God soundly kicking the Devil’s butt and saving the Dragon’s soul.
There are truly no words for this, as it’s something that just needs to be experienced by readers themselves, and - alone - is enough to justify picking up the Savage Dragon series.





 7  Savage Dragon Had an Epic Team-Up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

Fans can be sure about a certain character depending on how well they get along with other iconic characters, and the Dragon proved he could get along with the best of them after teaming up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. This crossover came during the brief period when the TMNT series was being published by Image Comics, and the publisher didn’t waste any time familiarizing the Turtles with its own cast of characters - including and especially the Dragon.
This two-part crossover was fun, action-packed, and a perfect introduction to the Savage Dragon series through one of the most widely recognized properties in the world, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.





 6  Savage Dragon Helps Build an Image Comics Universe with Spawn Crossover

This crossover wasn’t just a fun matchup like the Dragon’s run-in with the TMNT, but an epic attempt at establishing a cohesive Image Comics universe. Spawn and Dragon didn’t just go on an adventure together, Spawn played an active role in Dragon’s story arc, as Savage Dragon #30 was the precursor to the aforementioned God/Devil fist-fight.
This crossover wasn’t a self-contained story, it was the literal crossing-over of two intersecting stories in the purest sense. Publishers like Marvel and DC do this kind of thing all the time, but Image Comics was built on separate, creator-owned properties, which makes crossovers like this so rare, and so awesome when it does happen.





 5  Savage Dragon/The Maxx Crossovers Let 2 Underrated Image Comics Characters Shine 
The Maxx #6 by Sam Kieth and Bill Messner-Loebs &amp; Savage Dragon #28 by Erik Larsen
        

Just like Savage Dragon, The Maxx is a shamefully underrated Image Comics series. Not only is the artwork by Sam Kieth put on full display with no restrictions, but the storylines are as intriguing as they are badass. In a way, Savage Dragon and the Maxx have a lot in common in terms of hardcore outcast heroes with brutal forms of vigilante justice - which is why their crossovers are absolutely perfect.
Seeing these two fight side-by-side in these issues just makes readers want to know more about both of them in their respective series, as the true, underrated awesomeness of both characters is highlighted perfectly.





 4  Savage Dragon Proves It’s an A-List Series with Superman Crossover 
Superman/Savage Dragon - Chicago by Erik Larsen &amp; Superman &amp; Savage Dragon - Metropolis by Karl Kesel and Jon Bogdanove
        

These two crossover issues prove that Savage Dragon can tangle with the likes of Superman. Image Comics is no stranger to the occasional DC crossover, with Spawn/Batman being perhaps the most iconic. But this one in particular arguably stands out the most, as it features one of the most popular comic book characters in history side-by-side with one of the most underrated comic book characters in history.
Savage Dragon crossing over with Superman is more of a statement than just a fun adventure. It says that maybe this series isn’t as well known as the ongoing Superman titles, but it should be, and here’s the proof.





 3  Savage Dragon’s Savage World Event is a Brutal Jumping-On Point 
Savage Dragon #76 by Erik Larsen
        

After Savage Dragon goes back in time and kills a villain named Darklord, he returns to the present only to find the world in a state of post-apocalyptic chaos. The world he knew was gone, and now the Dragon had to rebuild his life in the wasteland of his own creation. This issue is marked as a ‘new #1’, advertising that it’s the first issue of an all-new chapter of Savage Dragon.
This is a perfect jumping-on point for readers who are familiar enough with Savage Dragon, but are fans of post-apocalyptic stories as opposed to cop/superhero dramas, as this is effectively a hard reset for Savage Dragon continuity.





 2  Savage Dragon Reveals The Series’ Hero was Originally a Villain 
Savage Dragon #0 by Erik Larsen
        

The first issue of Savage Dragon presented the reader with a mystery: who is the Dragon? Readers see who the Dragon became, but the secret as to his origin remained a mystery for years. That is, until it was finally revealed - and it was shocking, to say the least. The Dragon was originally an alien called Emperor Kurr, who led a nomadic race of space travelers looking for a new home. When Kurr found Earth, he wanted to eradicate humanity and conquer the planet for his people, but the other members of his race didn’t agree with his heartlessness.
Kurr’s own people gave him amnesia, and left him on Earth to live the rest of his life among the very people he was so callously going to exterminate. This origin is absolutely brilliant, as it reveals that fans have been bearing witness to an epic redemption story this whole time, without even realizing it.





 1  Savage Dragon Creator Has the Longest Tenure as Writer/Artist in Comic Book History 
Savage Dragon by Erik Larsen
        

At the time of this article being written, the latest issue of Savage Dragon was just released on January 17, 2024, with no end in sight, and the writer/artist is still Erik Larsen. Erik Larsen created Savage Dragon back in the ‘90s, made his original character a standout superhero through captivating storytelling, jaw-dropping artwork, and exciting crossovers with other iconic characters, and has since become the CFO of Image Comics itself. And even after all these years and all those accolades, Erik Larsen is still the main writer/artist of Savage Dragon.
This level of commitment to a comic book character is rarely seen anywhere, which makes this point alone the perfect reason to read Image Comics’ most underrated series, Savage Dragon.
