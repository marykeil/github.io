## Literature Review

Thor finally understands a hard lesson about humility that his father tried to teach him dating back to the God of Thunder&#39;s origin story. 




Warning: Spoilers for The Avengers #8!More than 60 years after his origin story, Thor finally understands a lesson that Odin tried to teach him. Thor&#39;s definitive origin is summarized in Thor Annual #11 by Alan Zelenetz and Bob Hall, making sense of his comic book debut in Journey Into Mystery #83. Chapter VI of the Annual, &#34;The Humbling of Thor,&#34; reveals Odin stripping Thor of his powers and memory (turning him into the feeble Donald Blake with no memory of his godhood) and sending him to Earth to learn humility.




in The Avengers #8 by Jed MacKay, C.F. Villa, Federico Blee, and VC&#39;s Cory Petit, Thor gets to showcase how he&#39;s actually learned humility from the experience. Thor&#39;s overwhelming hubris and pride is what forced Odin to cast him out of Asgard and onto Midgard years ago.

          

However, the humbling experience helped Thor learn to cast his pride aside when bigger things are afoot. This comes in handy in this new issue where Thor must forgo his pride in order to escape a dreamscape created by Nightmare and to save the world from the Twilight Court.


 Thor Submits to Nightmare on Behalf of The Avengers 
          




Nightmare traps the Avengers - except Scarlet Witch and Vision, the only ones capable of breaking Nightmare&#39;s hold on them - in an actual shared nightmare. The experience is not dissimilar from the Knight Terrors event the DC Universe just went through. Things worsen as while they sleep, the Twilight Court invades Earth. Once the Avengers finally understand that they are in a dream, they demand that Nightmare release them. Nightmare agrees to do so only on the condition that they admit he&#39;s won. All the Avengers are quick to refuse, except Thor, who laughs at the wager before telling Nightmare he&#39;s won.

Even Nightmare is confused at the notion. &#34;I do not understand,&#34; the villain says. &#34;I humble you, all of you, and you laugh?&#34; Thor explains that he has more important obligations outside of this dream to tend to, too important to let his pride get in the way. Knowing that Wanda and Vision are fending off the Twilight Court by themselves, Thor knows he&#39;s needed elsewhere. His teammates&#39; pride may not allow them all to share the same humble sentiment, but Thor has no problem submitting to Nightmare on their behalf.






 Thor Puts Odin&#39;s Lesson Into Practice 
          

It&#39;s hard to think that Thor would have come to this same realization to put his pride aside if he had not endured the lesson that Odin put him through dating back to his origin story. In fact, had Thor been faced with this same ultimatum from Nightmare before his exile to Midgard, he&#39;d still be in that dream to this day. Not only does Thor&#39;s past with Odin affect the present in a major way, but it&#39;s also a simple solution to defeat the bad guy. After all, Thor is a God and, therefore, he has nothing to prove to anyone, thus it makes perfect sense for him to be the one Avenger to put his pride aside.



The Avengers #8 is on sale now from Marvel.
