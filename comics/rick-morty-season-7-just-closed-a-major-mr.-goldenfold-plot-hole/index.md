Warning: Spoilers for Rick and Morty season 7!




Rick and Morty season seven has been a reinvention of the series, recasting its two main characters, killing the final boss, and upending its own narrative traditions. It also finally sealed the deal on a forgotten plot hole from the comics. The 2023 comic series revealed that, across the multiverse, Mr. Goldenfold is a mathematical genius on par with Rick. The C-137 version seemed to be just a dud.

In Season 7, Episode 8, &#34;Rise of the Numbericons: the Movie,&#34; the Alphabetrians - including Ice-T - ramp up their 80&#39;s action cartoon-influenced war with the Numbericons. In addition to seemingly solving the Goldenfold plot hole, this episode picks up a narrative thread left dangling since Season 2&#39;s &#34;Get Schwifty.&#34; When Ice-T, now rechristened Water-T, inherits the relic that could end the war and save his people, he goes to the one man he knows to be a mathematical genius: Mr. Goldenfold.



          




The multiversal Goldenfolds thought their C-137 brother was a reject, but he proved himself to be a genius, though still very odd.

                  Rick &amp; Morty: How Morty Keeps Surviving Rick&#39;s Adventures (Hint: He Doesn&#39;t)   Morty has survived a lot of Rick&#39;s dangerous adventures, with a Rick &amp; Morty comic revealing he technically almost never lives through them at all.   


 Even An Average Mr. Goldenfold Is Dedicated to Math 
          

Early in the episode, C-137 Mr. Goldenfold is up to his usual antics, suggesting that without math, the Russians would have all Rubik&#39;s Cubes, and elephants would forget. When Ice-T arrives with the Eye of Harmony, needing his old high school teacher to decipher it, Mr. Goldenfold becomes this episode&#39;s Rick when he takes Morty on an intergalactic detention adventure to stop the war. Things even seem to go better with Mr. Goldenfold than Rick: the math teacher is good at keeping both Water-T and his captive, 7, calm, and helps them understand each other. He gets along with the ancient pre-alphanumeric glyph race they meet, and encourages Morty to learn how to teach others.




This reflects the storyline from the 2023 comic series that showed Goldenfolds as equals to Ricks. In the universe that the main Goldenfold antagonist hailed from, Rick Sanchez was a mild-mannered science teacher. This enemy Goldenfold soutght to replace all of C-137 Earth&#39;s science with mathematics, which riled up Rick to fight him. C-137&#39;s Goldenfold, assumed to be useless by his evil variant, followed the villain version of himself, taking part in his evil plan, which summoned literal gods to Earth, ending in a race to the edge of the universe. This exciting comic arc left a huge plot hole that season seven finally answered: was C-137 Goldenfold hiding how smart he could be?



 The Rick and Morty Comics Are Having Their Biggest Event Ever in 2024 
          

Viewers may have thought the episode was a funny turn for a joke character, but comics readers know this isn&#39;t the first time the Rick and Morty comics affected the show â€“ and it won&#39;t be the last. In 2024, Oni is launching a yearlong Rick and Morty event called &#34;Finals Week&#34;: five interconnected adventures, each taking place during one day of Morty&#39;s finals week at school. The event promises to change the franchise forever, meaning longtime fans that haven&#39;t picked up the comics yet may want to start in 2024. Rick and Morty has a fandom that loves inside jokes, intricate lore, and clues hiding in plain sight that solve riddles no one had yet asked. By catching up with the comics, a brand new level of information about Rick and Morty is unlocked, especially about side characters like Mr. Goldenfold.
