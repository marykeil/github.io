# Nightwing Should Have Been Green Lantern s Sidekick - &amp; Even Batman Knows It


## SUMMARY 



  Surprisingly, Batman compares Nightwing to Green Lantern Hal Jordan, stating they have more similarities than commonly assumed.   Both Nightwing and Hal Jordan have grown past their traumatic experiences and have powerful wills, making them suitable candidates for Green Lantern rings.   Nightwing and Hal Jordan share leadership qualities and a comfort with being in the air, making them more alike than initially believed.

## Literature Review

Nightwing is one of the most well-respected heroes in the DCU, which is made perfectly clear when Batman compares him to a Justice League icon.




Most might assume that the hero Nightwing is most like is actually Batman, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case despite their close relationship. Batman himself admits that there&#39;s one hero in the Justice League that Nightwing reminds him of, and it&#39;s none other than the Green Lantern Hal Jordan.




Batman makes this surprising comparison in Superman/Batman #60 by Michael Green, Mike Johnson, Francis Manapul, Brian Buccellato, and Rob Leigh. In this issue, Batman is dealing with a fusion of his world and Superman&#39;s, meaning there are a ton of mashup characters between both of their social lives â€” including Hal Grayson, a fusion of Hal Jordan and Dick Grayson.

          

While the two are alone on a jet, Batman remarks just how similar Hal Jordan and Dick Grayson actually are, and how he&#39;d never noticed it before. Batman admits that he only now notices just how much Dick and Hal actually have in common, despite his very different relationships with the both of them.

 Nightwing Becomes a Green Lantern Mash Up Character 


          




One of the major things that&#39;s required to be a Green Lantern is having an incredibly powerful will and the ability to move past trauma. While Batman has an absurdly powerful will, he&#39;s never been able to move past the trauma of his childhood, which has inhibited him from using Lantern rings in the past. Nightwing, on the other hand, has been shown to have grown past the darkness of his childhood. Nightwing has managed to become a bright and cheerful character despite the trauma he went through. This shows he definitely could use a Green Lantern ring, but his similarities to Hal Jordan aren&#39;t just the fact they can both use power rings.

Hal Jordan is a former Air Force pilot, meaning he&#39;s gone through military training. Hal&#39;s knowledge of military tactics is so great that it even lets him outsmart General Zod. This means that Hal is a taught and natural-born leader. Nightwing is exactly the same: Nightwing&#39;s kindness has made him someone people instantly trust and want to follow. This is why he&#39;s been the leader of several teams, most notablly the Teen Titans. There&#39;s also the fact that both characters are more comfortable being in the air. With Hal Jordan as a pilot, he naturally enjoys flying, be it through his ring or in a vehicle. Similarly, Nightwing grew up in a circus. He&#39;s a trained world-class acrobat and can easily spend a great deal of time in the air just through his own skill.






 Nightwing Is More Similar to Green Lantern than First Glance 
          

Nightwing and Hal Jordan have a lot more in common on closer inspection than most fans would think. Even Batman, the world&#39;s greatest detective, didn&#39;t notice how similar they were until he was met face-to-face with a fusion of the two people. While Nightwing and Hal Jordan haven&#39;t interacted much in comics, it&#39;s possible they could become good friends if that ever changes. While most people might assume Nightwing is very similar to Batman, the Justice League hero he&#39;s closest to in terms of personality is actually Green Lantern Hal Jordan.
