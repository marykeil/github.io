## Literature Review

Batman is known as the world&#39;s greatest detective, but there are some characters that even Batman comes to when he needs help.




Batman has a ton of titles, but one of the most famous is the &#34;World&#39;s Greatest Detective&#34;, yet despite being called this, early in his career, he had to resort to asking an iconic villain for help. When faced with a puzzle left by an unknown serial killer, instead of buckling down and trying to solve it himself, Batman called in the Riddler and asked him to solve it.




Batman: Dark Victory #2 – by Jeph Loeb, Tim Sale, Richard Starkings, and Gregory Wright – featured Batman hunting a serial killer known as the Hangman. This killer would use a noose and hang their victims, before leaving a Hangman game at the scene of the crime.

          

Batman thought that there might be a hidden clue that&#39;d lead to their identity or their next victim, and in order to make sure he didn&#39;t miss anything, Batman brought in the Riddler to look over the evidence. Considering Batman&#39;s reputation as being the world&#39;s greatest detective, bringing in a second pair of eyes is a big thing, especially when it&#39;s a villain.

                  Batman &amp; Riddler Get Eye-Popping Redesigns Like You&#39;ve Never Seen   In a preview for the upcoming Batman #133, the Dark Knight and the Riddler get all-new redesigns that fans have never seen before.   





 Batman Enlists The Riddler&#39;s Help To Solve A Puzzle 


          



Time and again, Batman has solved seemingly impossible mysteries and even outsmarted the likes of Lex Luthor. Batman is also known as the man who can defeat anyone if he has enough prep time. Coming up with brilliant plans to take down his enemies and allies alike requires a lot of intelligence and planning, he&#39;s also usually the first one in the Justice League to discover everyone else&#39;s secret identities. Yet despite all of these achievements, sometimes there&#39;s a puzzle or a mystery that Batman requires a fresh set of eyes for. During a time with limited allies, Batman ends up turning to the Riddler for help.

Edward Nigma is without a doubt one of the smartest villains that Batman has ever faced. Riddler&#39;s intelligence is so high that even the Joker admits Riddler is smarter in most scenarios. Riddler has always been held back by his compulsions and attention-seeking. If Riddler dropped the gimmick, he&#39;d be unstoppable; since he&#39;s unable to do that, he frequently finds himself caught. Part of Riddler&#39;s M.O. is leaving clues to his crimes, if he didn&#39;t, it&#39;s unlikely Batman would ever catch him. When Riddler used a Lazarus pit and was cured of his compulsions, he figured out Batman&#39;s secret identity in just a few minutes, proving how brilliant he is.






 Riddler Solves The Puzzle Batman Leaves Him 


          



Batman is a genius, but often times looking at a grander picture can make people fail to see the smaller details. This is where a fresh pair of eyes often comes in; while Alfred usually plays that role, sometimes the puzzles Batman looks at are a bit above his pay grade. Ultimately, it is one more testament to Bruce Wayne&#39;s determination that he so quickly identified his need for help, and who to turn to. Because of this, with no other allies this early in his career, Batman had to resort to bringing in the Riddler to use his intelligence to help solve a mystery that had the world&#39;s greatest detective stumped.
