## Literature Review

Batman’s tragic beginnings become darker than ever before with a twist that sees Bruce hunt down his parents’ killer and get violent revenge.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2!The awful night that helped usher Batman into the world has just gotten a brutal and shocking update. Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham has showcased an even more twisted version of the Dark Knight&#39;s city. But nothing is more perturbing than a twist that makes Bruce Wayne the villain of his own origin.




In Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2 by Rafael Grampa with Mat Lopes, Detective Gordon is tracking a killer who is going after former patients treated by Dr. Charles Quinton in Arkham Asylum children&#39;s wing. Gordon is concerned for Bruce Wayne, who was on the list of patients. Bruce, however, has no memory of ever being in Arkham.

          

Alfred Pennyworth tells Bruce about the night his parents died and reveals that Bruce ran away afterward to track down the killer. Bruce found the culprit and viciously beat him with a nightstick until he was paralyzed. Bruce spent some time under Dr. Quinton&#39;s care, which caused Bruce to forget about the horrid experience.


 As a Child, Bruce Wayne Found His Parent&#39;s Killer and Paralyzed Him 
          




Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham is set in its own continuity and takes place in a much darker and unsettling Gotham City. This version of Batman&#39;s home turf lacks the colorful villains like Joker, Riddler, or Penguin. However, Gotham is beset by numerous horrific crimes like serial killings, slavery, and a drug trade. This story&#39;s Batman has devoted his life to improving Gotham, but the worsening state of his home is causing him to take some dramatic steps. Batman has established protocols to have himself publicly declared dead so he can focus all his attention on Gotham&#39;s criminal element.

This brutal update to Batman&#39;s origin no doubt fits with the much more harsh reality of Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham. To make matters even more uncomfortable, the story plays with the idea the person Bruce found and paralyzed wasn&#39;t even his parents&#39; killer, but an innocent homeless man. However, Bruce visits the man he assaulted and determines that he is the killer when the man (presumably this world&#39;s Joe Chill) mentions Martha Wayne&#39;s pearl necklace. But whether the man was innocent or guilty, the twist of Bruce tracking down Chill and paralyzing him makes Batman&#39;s already tragic origin story even more grim.






 Batman&#39;s Origin Could Have Been Much Worse 
          

That terrible night in Crime Alley was the worst thing to happen to Bruce Wayne, but this new take on the classic origin shows how much worse it could have been. Rather than taking those feelings of anger at Chill and using them to forge himself into one of the DC Universe&#39;s best heroes, Bruce gave into his worst instincts and irreparably harmed someone. Yes, Chill admits to shooting and killing Thomas and Martha Wayne, but other continuities show Bruce growing and learning to forgive. This younger Batman gave into the darkness almost right away, a disconcerting update to the hero&#39;s infamous origin.

Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
