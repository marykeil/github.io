## Literature Review

Spider-Man and Daredevil may be two of the greatest street-level Marvel heroes, but Daredevil has one slight advantage over Spider-Man.




Spider-Man and Daredevil are a great duo and both spend a lot of time protecting the same corners of New York City. While they both have superpowers, most people would assume Spider-Man is the stronger of the two, but that&#39;s not actually true. While Spider-Man&#39;s spider-sense is absurdly powerful, Daredevil&#39;s radar sense seems to edge it out in one specific area that could just save their lives.




The surprising difference between Radar Sense and Spider-Sense is revealed in Daredevil #9 by Charles Soule, Goran Sudzuka, Matt Milla, and Clayton Cowles. In this issue, Daredevil and Spider-Man team up to steal a briefcase from a criminal. The heist goes wrong, and the criminal is alerted, very nearly escaping with the briefcase.



          

As Spider-Man and Daredevil give chase, Daredevil&#39;s radar sense alerts him to snipers lying in wait, but Spider-Man nearly runs into them, despite his spider-sense. This shows a major difference in their powers, despite how similar they might seem on the surface.

                  Daredevil Predicted Spider-Man&#39;s Worst Decision Ever 4 Years Early   Spider-Man and Daredevil have gone through a lot of tragedy in their lives, but there&#39;s one tragedy Daredevil always knew Spider-Man would go through.   





 Daredevil&#39;s Radar Sense Is So Much Stronger than Spider-Man&#39;s Powers 


          

When Matt Murdock was a young child, he saved an old man from being hit by a truck. This resulted in an accident where Matt was struck by a radioactive isotope, blinding him for life. The rest of his senses were massively enhanced, though, and Daredevil gained his radar sense superpower. This ability grants Matt a form of 360-degree &#34;vision&#34; and significantly heightened hearing, sense of smell, and sense of touch. These abilities make it almost impossible for anyone to sneak up on him and are very similar to Peter Parker&#39;s iconic spider-sense — but there&#39;s one major difference between them that shows Matt has a slight advantage.

When Peter Parker was a young child, he was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a school field trip. This spider bite ended up giving Peter superpowers, such as enhanced strength, enhanced agility, and his iconic spider-sense. Peter&#39;s spider-sense warns him of incoming danger, making it almost impossible to sneak up on him and giving him a huge advantage in just about any combat encounter. But the difference between these two similar powers is how specific they are. Peter&#39;s spider-sense only goes off when he&#39;s in imminent danger, but the power doesn&#39;t tell Spider-Man what the danger is. It simply warns him that it&#39;s there. Matt&#39;s radar sense, on the other hand, allows Daredevil to &#34;see&#34; everything, allowing him to quickly determine the exact threat.






 Daredevil Saves Spider-Man&#39;s Life with His Radar Sense 


          

Daredevil and Spider-Man are great friends and are both absurdly powerful heroes in their own way. While Spider-Man has more &#34;super&#34; powers than Daredevil, such as enhanced strength and agility, this comes at a cost of awareness. While Spider-Man&#39;s spider-sense doesn&#39;t tell him exactly what the threat is, he tends to get past that by relying on his super agility. Daredevil doesn&#39;t have superhuman agility — he can&#39;t dodge bullets or the like — but his radar sense makes sure he never has to. While Spider-Man&#39;s spider-sense is iconic, Daredevil&#39;s radar sense is just slightly better due to how specific it is.
