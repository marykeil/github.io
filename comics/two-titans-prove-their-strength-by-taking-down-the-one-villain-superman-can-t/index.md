## Literature Review

Superman is one of the most powerful characters in DC Comics, but two Titans recently took down a villain he historically struggles with.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Titans: Beast World #3!




Superman is a DC Comics powerhouse, and there are few villains that he can&#39;t go up against, but two iconic members of the Titans managed to bring down a foe that has historically given Superman problems. Adam has always been a problem for the Man of Steel, due to his magical abilities, but Starfire and Donna Troy have no issues taking him down.

Titans: Beast World #3 – by Tom Taylor, Lucas Meyer, Romulo Fajardo Jr, and Wes Abbott – featured Donna and Starfire taking on an animalistic Black Adam. As Garro&#39;s Beast spores rain down on Earth, many different characters are infected and transformed into monsterous versions of themselves.



          

One of the most terrifying transformations in the crossover event so far is Black Adam transforming into a lion, rampaging through Kahndaq. With everyone else occupied, Starfire and Donna Troy take on the feral dictator, and surprisingly, easily subdue him. While Donna has to focus on saving people, Starfire is able to beat Black Adam into submission.

Superman&#39;s most famous weakness, of course, is Kryptonite, but it is not the only thing DC&#39;s most powerful superhero is vulnerable to. Superman&#39;s other big weakness is magic, and Black Adam is one of the most magically powerful characters in the DC Universe. While they haven&#39;t fought that often, Black Adam has always posed a significant threat to the Man of Steel, in the instances where the two have come to blows. Now that Black Adam is transformed into a feral beast, all of his constraints have been removed while keeping all of his power. This makes him nearly unbeatable for Superman, but not for the Titans.




Starfire and Donna Troy are both unbelievably physically strong. Donna herself is comparable to Wonder Woman, who, in her own right, is a character who has often given Superman a run for his money, when it has been necessary for the two to trade blows. Starfire is an immensely physically powerful character in her own right and has powerful energy attacks that she can use. The most important part, though, is the fact that neither Donna nor Starfire have any real set weaknesses. The duo are incredibly strong and don&#39;t have anything like Kryptonite or magic that can bring them down. This allows the duo to take on Black Adam while Superman can&#39;t.

Superman is one of the most powerful heroes that comic books have to offer. Essentially, that is why he has such predefined weaknesses to help temper that out. Other DC characters, such as the Titans, aren&#39;t as famous as Superman outside of comic book readership, but they can still be just as strong as him, and at times are even more capable of getting the job done than the Man of Steel. This was the case in Titans: Beast World #3, as Starfire and Donna proved they were two of the strongest Titans when they beat Black Adam, an opponent that even Superman struggles with.
