Summary

  The Nihil, the Jedi&#39;s primary villains in the High Republic Era, continue to gain more powerful weapons and technology.   The Nihil&#39;s technology, such as lightsaber deactivators and Stormwalls, raises questions about their absence during the future Skywalker saga.   The ultimate fate and legacy of the Nihil, as well as the potential banning of their technology, remains to be revealed in the High Republic publishing initiative.  







The Jedi Order&#39;s new villains during The High Republic Era have become extremely powerful in the Star Wars canon. Wielding a variety of impressive weapons and unique technology, the Nihil marauders have certainly become a force to be reckoned with. However, their existence centuries before the events of the Skywalker saga has generated some problematic questions regarding the overall Star Wars timeline and canon.

As seen in Star Wars: The High Republic: Shadows of Starlight #3 by Charles Soule and Jethro Morales, newly elevated Jedi Knights Jedi Bell Zettifar and Burryaga are assisting Grandmaster Pra-Tre Veter on a mission near the Nihil&#39;s Occlusion Zone, an entire region of space they&#39;ve walled off using their new Stormwall technology. Likewise, the trio of Jedi&#39;s lightsabers get deactivated thanks to the Nihil as well, proving just how powerful the marauders have become in this early era of the galaxy far, far away.

         




Combined with the Nameless and their Path Engines, the Nihil has so many impressive weapons and tech that have never been seen before in the established canon. While entertaining, the problem comes with the fact that the High Republic Era is set before the Skywalker saga. Keeping that in mind, what happened to all of this powerful technology by the time of the prequel trilogy and beyond?

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 The Nihil Keep Getting More Powerful 
Even The Jedi Are Afraid
          

As seen in the first two phases of the High Republic publishing initiative as well as the current third phase, the Nihil continues to debut more and more powerful weapons. First came the Path Engines, allowing the Nihil&#39;s ships to uniquely travel through hyperspace, utilizing incredibly short jumps and navigating special routes, allowing them to outflank rival ships and conduct raids without pursuit. It was also the Path Engines that brought about the Great Hyperspace Disaster which kickstarted the High Republic&#39;s first phase.




The Nihil also seeded the Outer Rim with the carnivorous plant species known as the Drengir, causing thousands of deaths. Thanks to their leader Marchion Ro, the Nihil also had control of the deadly Force predators known as the Nameless, powerful beasts capable of paralyzing even the strongest Jedi with fear before their life forces were drained. These creatures were instrumental in the Nihil&#39;s attack and subsequent destruction of the Jedi Order&#39;s Starlight Beacon. Now, Phase III has debuted the &#34;Stormwall&#34;, powered by devices known as seeds, preventing ships from entering their new Occlusion Zone at lightspeed and blocking any communications from getting in.



 Where Was All The Nihil Tech During The Skywalker Saga? 
Was It All Banned Before The Prequels?
          

Combined with teases from upcoming issues that the Nihil likely played a part in the creation of military walkers such as the future AT-ST, why hasn&#39;t their other technology been featured centuries later during the Skywalker saga? For example, the Nihil&#39;s lightsaber deactivators could have been incredibly useful during the Clone Wars or during Order 66. A new Stormwall could have been generated to protect the Death Stars.




All in all, it&#39;s clear that more of the Nihil&#39;s history and ultimate fate will need to be revealed as the High Republic publishing initiative continues. Considering all the horrors they unleashed and the lives they took, perhaps their legacy was erased by the Republic. A mass banning of the vast majority of their technology and weapons would certainly explain their absence during the Star Wars films and shows, though that&#39;s currently just conjecture.

Star Wars: The High Republic: Shadows of Starlight #3 is available now from Marvel Comics.
