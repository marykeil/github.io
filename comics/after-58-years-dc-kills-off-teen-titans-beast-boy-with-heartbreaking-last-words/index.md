## Literature Review

As Titans: Beast World begins, Beast Boy meets a horrific end - not just killed, but turned into a weapon against his friends and allies.




Warning: contains spoilers for Titans: Beast World #1!As Titans: Beast World begins DC&#39;s latest superhero event story, the beloved hero Garfield Logan - aka Beast Boy - is officially no more. The shock moment comes at the height of the Titans&#39; triumph, with Beast Boy defeating the deadly Necrostar, only to become an even more dangerous threat. Introduced in 1965&#39;s Doom Patrol #99, Beast Boy later found a home with the Teen Titans, appearing in countless stories and adaptations as the beating heart of the team.




In Tom Taylor, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki, Brad Anderson, and Wes Abbott&#39;s Titans: Beast World #1, Beast Boy transforms into a member of the alien &#39;Star Conqueror&#39; species to defeat the Necrostar, which was summoned to Earth by Titans villain Brother Eternity. While Beast Boy saves the day by forcing the Necrostar through a teleportation gate, he&#39;s then attack by new villain Doctor Hate. Hate uses the power of the Nightmare Stone to erase Beast Boy&#39;s mind, leaving only the predatory instincts of the Star Conqueror.

          

While Beast Boy&#39;s physical body remains, the narration and god-tier empath Raven confirm that Gar is gone for good. Doctor Hate has killed off the human side of Beast Boy. Now, Gar is a true Star Conqueror, attacking the Earth with starfish-like drones which turn heroes and villains into animal/human hybrids. The story makes it abundantly clear that Gar is dead, as the hero murmurs, &#34;Please... I don&#39;t want to go. I don&#39;t... want to...&#34; before being erased by Doctor Hate. Here at Screen Rant, we think this seeming Doctor Who reference is a clue to what will happen next.






Please... I don&#39;t want to go. I don&#39;t... want to...

I don&#39;t want to go.

 : Titans Upgraded Beast Boy&#39;s Powers Right Before His Death


 Beast Boy Is Gone - Now There&#39;s Only Garro 
Doctor Hate Has Permanently Removed Garfield Logan&#39;s Identity
         

Fans knew that Beast Boy would become &#39;Garro&#39; in Beast World (a pun on the most famous Star Conqueror in DC lore, Starro the Conqueror), but most had assumed that becoming such a vast creature would simply overtax his body, allowing its animal instincts to take over. Had that been the case, someone like Raven could have entered his mind and forced him to turn back. Instead, Doctor Hate is the one to wipe Gar&#39;s mind, turning a moment of immense heroism into a terrifying loss.




Solicit information for Titans #8 (releasing after Beast World) shows the Titans branded as traitors by the public, assembled in front of Titans Tower without Beast Boy. This supports the idea that Garfield really did just meet his ultimate end, and shows that Doctor Hate&#39;s mission in attacking the pure-hearted hero was a major success.



 Amanda Waller&#39;s Villains Are Using Beast World to Destroy the Titans 
Amanda Waller&#39;s Anti-Superhero Plans Have Already Started
         

Introduced in Knight Terrors, Doctor Hate is a mysterious foe whose true identity is unknown - though Beast World confirms he&#39;s someone Beast Boy recognizes. Empowered by Amanda Waller, Doctor Hate possesses immense magical power, and is yet another agent in her plan to discredit and kill DC&#39;s heroes. Recently, Waller was stopped from claiming another reality as her own (in the War for Earth-3 crossover), and she&#39;s returned with a vengeance ever since. Dawn of DC Primer #1 (Joshua Williamson and Leandro Fernández) confirmed the Suicide Squad&#39;s former leader is assembling a villain army to kill off Earth&#39;s heroes, while series like Green Arrow, Penguin, and Doom Patrol have shown her gathering allies and finding new ways to target metahumans.




During the Knight Terrors event, Waller made it clear that the Titans were her next target, with the team of former sidekicks having officially replaced the disbanded Justice League as Earth&#39;s protectors. Now, it&#39;s clear that Beast World won&#39;t just be about a planet of animal/human hybrids, but will also see Waller attempting to seize power as humanity loses faith in its heroes. In a heartbreaking twist, Beast Boy wasn&#39;t just killed, but turned into the ultimate weapon against his friends and allies - a monstrosity Waller can use to show the public that heroes can&#39;t be trusted. However, as that Doctor Who reference hints, Garfield Logan&#39;s story may not be over...



The rest of this article contains speculation which may include spoilers for the Beast World event.






 Beast World Sets Up Beast Boy&#39;s Replacement 
Was Titans&#39; Doctor Who Reference a Clue?
         




While the Garro entity no longer contains any part of Garfield Logan, Titans: Beast World #1 does set up a way to resurrect him - one that&#39;s incredibly smart. During the fight against the Necrostar, Cyborg opens a Boom Tube portal to the Boomerang Nebula - a location 5,000 light-years away from Earth. While the mission is successful, one of Beast Boy&#39;s arms freezes and is pulled off by the portal, ending up trapped in the Nebula with the Necrostar. Beast Boy shrugs it off, noting he can grow back the limb. Garfield also mentions that as a Star Conqueror, his brain is literally the size of a country.



The Boomerang Nebula is a real location in the constellation Centaurus, but can also be read as a clue that Beast Boy will return, given a boomerang&#39;s tendency to leave but eventually come back.




In real life, starfish are notable for being able to grow back an entire body from a single severed limb. While Star Conquerors are their own alien species in DC lore, many of their physiological traits are similar to starfish, including being able to quickly grow back limbs (as Beast Boy does here.) While Doctor Hate erases Beast Boy&#39;s consciousness from his original body, it&#39;s possible that his frozen arm will naturally grow back a whole new Gar. If his brain was spread evenly throughout his body, it might even possess his original personality and memories (real starfish don&#39;t have a centralized brain, making this even more possible.) It would be very much in line with Taylor&#39;s writing style to bring Beast Boy back with such a smart fact from the animal kingdom.




What makes this particularly satisfying is it would pay off Beast Boy&#39;s last words as a subtle Doctor Who reference. In the sci-fi show, David Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor also says &#34;I don&#39;t want to go&#34; prior to dying. However, another version of the Time Lord survives thanks to his previously severed hand being used to grow a new version. This would seem to be a major clue as to how Beast Boy can effectively be replaced by his own regrown &#39;clone,&#39; using his severed limb as a &#39;save point&#39; created prior to Doctor Hate&#39;s attack. ​​​​​Of course, the Titans would still have to find a way to retrieve Beast Boy&#39;s limb from the Boomerang Nebula, which may be how Beast World ends or could even be a future Titans arc on its own.



 Beast Boy&#39;s Death Is Handled Perfectly 
Death Is a Rite of Passage for Heroes, and Garfield Logan Goes Out a Titan
          




Even if Beast Boy does eventually return, that won&#39;t make his death any less affecting. Garfield Logan sacrificed himself to save Earth, pushing his way through intense pain and challenging himself like never before, only to die alone in space, calling for his love. It&#39;s a dark, heavy way to begin Titans: Beast World, and sets the tone for a story that - as the creative team had promised - is set to go far darker than its apparent premise.

Hopefully, fans will see Beast Boy again, but for now, his death was a heartbreaking way to begin Titans: Beast World, setting up an event that&#39;s clearly not going to be taking it easy on its titular superhero team.

Titans: Beast World #1 is available now from DC Comics.
