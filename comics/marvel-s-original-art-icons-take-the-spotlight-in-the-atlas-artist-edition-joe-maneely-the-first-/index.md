## Literature Review

Marvel and Fantagraphics will release the first look at the career of Marvel icon Joe Maneely, and ScreenRant has an exclusive first look.




Marvel’s original art icons will take the spotlight in the new Atlas Artist Editions, and the first will feature the legendary Joe Maneely. Before becoming Marvel Comics, the company went through other names, including Atlas. Now, Fantagraphics looks back on this unique era in a new series of gorgeous hardcovers, and the first in the new Artist Edition line shines a light on the little known but highly accomplished Joe Maneely, and ScreenRant is pleased to bring fans a first look.




Atlas Artist Edition: Joe Maneely will give fans a comprehensive look at the artist’s impressive body of work. Coming in at 256 pages, the book features a cross-section of genres, including westerns, pre-Code horror, funny animals and Cold War thrillers. Maneely provides art for all of them, with Stan Lee scripting 11 of the book’s stories. Fantagraphics has shared an exclusive first look at one of the book’s most memorable stories: “Thru the Lens.”

         

This punchy, four-page story is a twisted look at Earth’s demise, and is reprinted in Atlas Artist Edition: Joe Maneely.


 Joe Maneely Should Be a Household Name Among Comic Fans 
          




Only the most die-hard of comic fans know Joe Maneely’s name, but this book looks to change all of that. Entering the industry during a lull in superheroes, Maneely gained a reputation as a solid and reliable artist, and was regarded as even more accomplished than others in his cohort, which included Steve Ditko and Gene Colan. While Maneely may have never drawn a superhero proper, one of his creations, the Black Knight, would have a second life in the Marvel Universe. Maneely died at the age of 32, before the Marvel Age of Comics began.

This means Joe Maneely never got the chance to illustrate any of Marvel’s superhero titles that would emerge just a few years after his untimely passing. Maneely was well respected among his peers, and his loss was felt throughout the industry. Because Maneely never got the chance to draw Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and others, his art never received the exposure of Kirby, Ditko or Romita. Stan Lee was particularly haunted by Maneely’s loss, and was once famously quoted as saying Maneely could have been another Jack Kirby. All of this has made Joe Maneely one of the biggest “what could have beens” in comic history.






 Joe Maneely&#39;s Time Has Come at Last 
          

With this in mind, the release of Atlas Artist Edition: Joe Maneely is a cause for celebration, and the story reprinted here encapsulates why. “Thru the Lens” is pitch perfect, pre-Code science fiction, in the vein of EC Comics. It darkly explores the human condition, namely humanity’s desire for self-destruction. Maneely’s art pops off the page, and is brought to beautiful life. Atlas Artist Edition: Joe Maneely is the perfect occasion for fans to discover this long-lost Marvel icon for the first time.

Atlas Artist Edition Volume One: Joe Maneely is on sale January 16 from Fantagraphics!
