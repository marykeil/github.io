# Kick-Ass  Hit-Girl Just Died in Official Continuity (&amp; Gets an Unexpected Replacement)


## SUMMARY 



  Hit-Girl is killed in Big Game #5, shot by Wanted protagonist Wesley Gibson, aka the Killer.   Hit-Girl used time travel to save every other Millarverse hero, bringing heroes like Kingsman&#39;s Eggsy back to life.   She&#39;s replaced by the Mindy McCready of the new timeline in what feels like a betrayal of the character.

## Literature Review

Kick-Ass&#39; assassin superhero dies a gory death in Big Game, and Chloë Grace Moretz&#39;s superhero is replaced by an unlikely candidate.




Contains spoilers for Big Game #5!In a tragic twist, Kick-Ass&#39; Hit-Girl has just been killed. A deadly assassin trained by her superhero-obsessed father, Mindy McCready was played on-screen by Chloë Grace Moretz in Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2. However, she&#39;s been far busier in the comics, debuting in Kick-Ass but going on to her own globe-trotting comic series, and acting as the central protagonist in the recent Big Game crossover.




In Big Game #5 by Mark Millar and Pepe Larraz, Wesley Gibson&#39;s supervillain group the Fraternity finally meet their match. Having stolen time-travel technology, Hit-Girl goes back and prevents the world&#39;s heroes from being assassinated, gathering them together as a single fighting force. Sadly, as the battle reaches its crescendo, Hit-Girl is shot dead by Wanted&#39;s Gibson, aka the Killer.

          

Thankfully, in a final twist, it&#39;s pointed out that there are actually two Hit-Girls in Big Game canon - the version who went back in time to save the heroes, and the version who now exists in the altered timeline. This leaves one Hit-Girl still alive in Millarverse&#39;s ongoing shared universe.



It&#39;s a cheap death for an ultra-skilled hero...

 Hit-Girl Is Killed by the World&#39;s Ultimate Villain 
But Time Travel Shenanigans Mean the Millarverse Still Has a Hit-Girl
          

Introduced in Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.&#39;s Kick-Ass, Hit-Girl was raised as an expert killer by her father, the vigilante &#39;Big Daddy.&#39; Since then, Mindy has traveled the world killing the planet&#39;s most despicable criminals, and was one of the Fraternity&#39;s main targets when they came after Earth&#39;s heroes. While Kick-Ass gains real superpowers to join in the final battle, Hit-Girl relies on her skills and weapons. Unfortunately, she finally faces a villain with a similar level of skill, as the Killer shoots Mindy through the head and is killed in return by the other Mindy McCready.



 Hit-Girl&#39;s Death Is Still a Tragedy 
Kick-Ass&#39; Ultra-Competent Hero Deserved Better
          




While Hit-Girl&#39;s death/survival is a fun final joke based on the event&#39;s time travel premise, the character deserved a lot better. It&#39;s not yet clear which Hit-Girl died - the time-traveling savior or the new timeline&#39;s Mindy - but either way it&#39;s a true tragedy, and could even be described as the Millarverse breaking its own narrative rules. Hit-Girl is the most competent killer on the heroes&#39; side, hence why she&#39;s able to escape through time and bring down the Fraternity. However, this also means that having her be the only major fatality in the grand hero vs villain battle is a betrayal of how she&#39;s been portrayed in every other appearance. Taken by itself, it&#39;s a cheap death for an ultra-skilled hero who has spent a lifetime honing her abilities.

Big Game pulled every comic under Millarverse&#39;s umbrella together in a huge confrontation pitting heroes against villains. While the series killed off many heroes over its run, Hit-Girl&#39;s time travel mission means she&#39;s the only victim by the time of its conclusion. For casual fans, very little just changed, and Hit-Girl will likely return in future stories. However, for those who have been following Hit-Girl since 2008&#39;s Kick-Ass #1, it&#39;s a grim way for Mindy to lose her life, especially as she&#39;s immediately replaced with so little fanfare.




Big Game #5 is available now from Millarworld.
