## Literature Review

Leave Me Alone – I Want to Enjoy Cheat Life with My Familiar is similar to series like I Shall Survive Using Potions! but it&#39;s somehow sinister.






This manga is also known as Hottoite Kudasai - Juuma To Cheat Life Tanoshii Mitai!







An ongoing isekai manga called Leave Me Alone – I Want to Enjoy Cheat Life with My Familiar appears to be another cute and relaxing slice of life series where the isekai&#39;d protagonist lives a casual life instead of adventuring. However, there are enough subtle moments scattered throughout the first few chapters that evoke an ominous feeling in readers that suggests maybe this new world isn&#39;t as innocent as it seems.

This isn&#39;t the first time that there&#39;s been an isekai&#39;d protagonist who wants to live a slow life in their new world but keeps getting dragged out on adventures because of their ubiquitous cheat skill. In fact, there&#39;s a new series from Crunchyroll&#39;s fall 2023 lineup called I Shall Survive Using Potions! that encomposes these types of stories.

          




The difference, however, is that the protagonist&#39;s reluctance to get involved in heroics is usually much more comical like it is in like I Shall Survive Using Potions! The same can&#39;t be said of Leave Me Alone – I Want to Enjoy Cheat Life with My Familiar by Misono Nanashi and Naruki Rio.


 Characters Keep On Making Unsettling Comments About Mizuki&#39;s Powers

Leave Me Alone does begin innocently enough, and the initial premise is quite touching albeit heart-wrenching. All Mizuki ever wanted was to spend more time with her beloved dog, Gin, rather than waste her life in her overly demanding job. So when she reincarnates next to a Fenrir who reminds her of Gin, Mizuki decides to make do and names him the English version of Gin, Silver. Even after the series devotes its debut chapter to adorable cuddling scenes, the cuteness somehow persists when she and Silver get swept into the human realm. Luckily, her soon-to-be guardian named Baker along with other characters shower Mizuki with love and attention. The fact that Mizuki reincarnated into the body of a young girl adds to the manga&#39;s cute factor considerably.




Moreover, later chapters create the impression that the series will strictly follow a cozy slice-of-life that Mizuki yearned for, as she shops with and even cooks for Silver. But all throughout these scenes, Baker, and even other characters make unsettling comments that imply the world Mizuki got reincarnated into isn&#39;t all what it&#39;s made out to be, suggesting Mizuki&#39;s life could be in danger if people learn about her special isekai powers. Even the most innocuous spells from the vast majority of isekai series, like storage magic, have negative implications associated with them, which creates an unsettling atmosphere that&#39;s rare in comedy series like this. Sure enough, the end of chapter #3 gets official by introducing a very unpleasant situation, especially for a character like Mizuki who is trapped in a child&#39;s body.

          




Leave Me Alone – I Want to Enjoy Cheat Life with My Familiar masterfully undermines the cuteness and innocence that deceptively permeate the series&#39; earliest scenes, which wrongfully categorize it as a slice-of-life series, but veteran isekai fans will especially appreciate how the series subverts both the cozy isekai trope, and the tone of popular anime like I Shall Survive Using Potions! into something wholly unique.
