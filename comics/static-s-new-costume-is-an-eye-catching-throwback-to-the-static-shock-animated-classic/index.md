## Literature Review

Static: Shadows of Dakota #7 will conclude the hero&#39;s current adventures, but will segue into his next alongside a suit that blends his history.




A new costume has dropped for Static, harkening back to his days in Static Shock. Static: Shadows of Dakota #7 will not only close out the current run of the hero&#39;s adventures, but will also be the debut of his epic new suit. From his beginnings to his animated era, the recent reboot has nodded back to everything fans love about the character.




On X, artist Nikolas Draper-Ivey shared a look at the design and concept art for Static&#39;s newest superhero suit. It combines elements from the outfit he has been wearing in Static: Season One with the upcoming future he will have as a new creative team takes over the character&#39;s next journey. As usual, he&#39;s looking incredible and ready for action while still being easily recognizable.


 

Static: Shadows of Dakota #7 has the creative team of Vita Ayala and Nikolas Draper-Ivey. It is likely to feature the return of Rubberband Man, who has been a key component of this series. The issue will conclude this opening portion of the hero&#39;s adventures, bringing the current conflicts to a head. Static has been investigating the disappearance of Bang Babies, while simultaneously struggling with his own personal issues and losses.

 Static Re-Enters His Static Shock Era For Next Adventure 
          

This new era of Static comics began with Static: Season One in 2021. That series spanned six issues and led into Static: Shadows of Dakota, which started publishing this year. It will conclude with its seventh issue on November 28. DC has been revitalizing its Milestone comic heroes and Static may arguably be its most successful endeavor so far. Presently, an official announcement has not revealed the next stage of the young hero&#39;s journey, as there are no signs of a new series in the present solicitations for January or February 2024. More news is likely to come once Static: Shadows of Dakota concludes, just ahead of December.

Static&#39;s first outfit, which he made himself in Static: Season One was a throwback to his debut suit, complete with an iconic Malcolm X hat. As the story progressed, the hero gained additional suits and had variations on his outfit. While several elements were reminiscent of the Static Shock animated series from 2000, the latest iteration is a great homage to it with far more similarity. The blue cape component is fully back, contrasting beautifully with the black and yellow. This look also keeps some of the newer elements, such as his yellow goggles and the traditional black mask, foregoing the white. Static&#39;s current era is a perfect blend of where he has been before and where he is at now - and so is his suit.

Static: Shadows of Dakota #7 releases November 28 from DC Comics and Milestone.
