## Literature Review

Frank Miller&#39;s lightning bolt cover for The Dark Knight Returns is iconic, but what is Batman actually doing in the famous silhouette?




A Batman-themed optical illusion has swept across social media, as comic fans debate whether Frank Miller&#39;s iconic cover for The Dark Knight Returns shows the titular Caped Crusader facing towards or away from the reader. With the image compared to the white &amp; gold/blue &amp; black dress that created a similar uproar in 2015, there&#39;s strong evidence for both sides of the debate.




The debate was summarized by X user Matt Ferguson, whose post shares the image - which shows Batman totally in silhouette with a lightning bolt behind him - while asking &#34;Is Frank Millerâ€™s Batman front or back facing?&#34;


 

While Ferguson has admitted &#34;it does work both ways,&#34; comic fans have been arguing back and forth, with the most creative answers offering hilarious new explanations for the pose, which has been parodied and homaged relentlessly since its first appearance.

Miller&#39;s The Dark Knight Returns redefined the superhero genre when it released in 1986, heralding what has been retrospectively named the Dark Age of Comics - grim and gritty stories starring heroes who were often as cruel and violent as their enemies. It includes the most iconic &#39;Batman vs Superman&#39; fight in comics, where Bruce Wayne uses a specially-built suit of armor to beat down the Man of Steel. Now, it&#39;s back, likely because of Miller&#39;s recent variant cover art for Marvel, where he draws Captain America in a similar pose for Avengers: Twilight. In that piece, Steve Rogers has his back to the reader, suggesting that&#39;s how Miller sees his Batman.



          



That would seemingly end the discussion, however this apparently wasn&#39;t always Miller&#39;s intent. X user KaptainKraken points out that in the original sketches for the cover, Miller shows that Batman is facing towards the reader, confirming that whatever the answer, either interpretation fits into the silhouette.

Some users took the debate as an opportunity to get a little more creative. On Instagram, artist Caio Oliveira depicts Batman as facing away from the reader... but also suspended upside-down, with his fist forming the silhouette&#39;s &#39;head.&#39; Meanwhile, X user Louie Joyce fits Superman into the silhouette, showing he and Batman kissing, complete with &#34;smoochy smoochy&#34; sound effects.


 





 

Unlike the black and blue dress, there&#39;s no real &#39;correct&#39; answer to which direction Miller&#39;s Batman is facing, though the kiss is the only one that satisfactorily explains the strange &#39;split&#39; in Batman&#39;s cape. Whatever the answer, Frank Miller&#39;s Dark Knight Returns cover continues to be one of the most iconic images in modern comics, even if fans can&#39;t actually agree which direction Batman is facing.
