Screen Rant is excited to announce and provide an exclusive look at Deathstalker, Vault Comics&#39; upcoming comic collaboration with Slash from Guns N&#39; Roses and Shout! Studios. A glimpse at the covers and pages from the comic has been provided by the comic publisher responsible for series like Barbaric and These Savage Shores. This new title brings back the cult classic movie franchise of the same name.

Vault Comics&#39; Deathstalker will adapt the cult classic sword-and-sorcery film franchise, Deathstalker, which originally released in 1983, creating a new story. The film starred Rick Hill, Lana Clarkson, Bernard Erhard, and Barbi Benton, following the titular hero on his quest to acquire a sword, chalice, and amulet. It spawned three sequels, including Deathstalker II (1987), Deathstalker and the Warriors from Hell (1988), and Deathstalker IV: Match of Titans (1991).






          

This updated take on the original story comes from the creative team of Slash, Steven Kostanski, Tim Seeley, Jim Terry, and Kurt Michael Russell. Previous comic credits for these assorted creators include West of Sundown, Grayson, Hack/Slash, Come Home, Indio, Money Shot, and Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Dark One. The project is set to deliver a thrilling and nostalgic fantasy story.


 Vault Comics Reveals Variant Covers &amp; Preview for Upcoming Deathstalker Comic 
         

The preview for Deathstalker #1 provides a look at the titular hero and his triumphant return. A new mission was granted to him that he has seemingly failed to complete adequately, complicating the journey he and his companions are on. This early glimpse shows that the pulpy elements of the genre have been included in the newest iteration of Deathstalker. The world has been established here, as well as some of the core plot elements. Also seen here are the variant covers from Nathan Gooden (co-creator of Barbaric) and Conor Boyle. Other variant cover artists include Boris Vallejo (original movie poster artist for the film), Jim Terry, Patrick GaÃ±as, and Angela Wu. This issue will be 48 pages long. Check out the synopsis here:





The cult-classic warrior-hero Deathstalker bursts into the comics scene from an all-star lineup of creators including Slash (Guns N&#39; Roses) and writer-director-creature-FX-wizard Steven Kostanski (Psycho Goreman, The Void)!
Deathstalker finds himself once again caught between forces larger than himself-a virgin worshiping cult, a sorcerer hell-bent on saving the world through mad science, and the pissed-off army of the Abraxeon kingdom...not to mention his ex-lover, Princess Evie. Monsters, magic, and mayhem abound...can&#39;t a guy just swing his sword anymore?

 Deathstalker&#39;s New Legacy Begins with Vault Comics, Mixing Nostalgia &amp; Modern Storytelling 
          




Slash, Guns N&#39; Roses guitarist, says:


I&#39;m excited to be kicking off a new era of Deathstalker. From Tim Seeley, artist Jim Terry, writer-director-creature-FX-wizard Steven Kostanski, and myself, our Deathstalker is a reimagining of that fine specimen of 80s sword and sorcery. With fantasy, you get a little of everything: horror, magic, sex, thrills, blood, guts, swords and weirdness. You know - all those things you can&#39;t look away from. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re bringing. So - please - if you share my love of all things wicked, check it out!


Vault Comics CEO, Damian Wassel, adds:


We obviously adore sword and sorcery at Vault. So, when Slash approached us with the opportunity to relaunch a cult classic of genre together with Steven Kostanski, and our friends at Shout! and Raven Banner, we couldn&#39;t say no. The whole idea of this project is to balance nostalgia for the so-bad-it&#39;s-good fantasy filmmaking of the 1980s with the storytelling sensibilities of our time. There&#39;s no one we could trust more to turn that into a wickedly hilarious, fantastically epic comic than Tim Seeley and Jim Terry.





Jim Terry, artist for the upcoming Deathstalker comic says:


Some went to church, some had friends, I had the video store. Being young at the birth of the VHS explosion was magic, and it felt like a time when folks were telling incredibly imaginative stories with limited resources - that charm and creativity would be hard to recreate today but it&#39;s a thrill to bask in that energy with Deathstalker. I&#39;m already enjoying myself, and very much looking forward to wandering in a world I&#39;m very familiar with and making something that we hope will be an absolute blast to read. Thanks to all the folks involved and to my pal Tim Seeley for inviting me along to hang out in this universe for a while.


Deathstalker #1 will be available in March 2024 from Vault Comics.
