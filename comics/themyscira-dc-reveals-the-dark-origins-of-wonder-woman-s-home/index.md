Warning: Potential spoilers for Amazons Attack #3!




DC has officially retconned the origins of Themyscira, bestowing Wonder Woman&#39;s home with a darker origin than previously known. This newfound revelation carries severe implications that could potentially impact the ongoing Wonder Woman and Amazons Attack storylines.

Amazons Attack #3 by Josie Campbell and Vasco Georgiev continues to follow Queen Nubia, Wonder Girl Yara, Faruka, and Mary Marvel as they fight to restore peaceful cohabitation between the Amazons and humans. Amid the ever-evolving situation, DC has taken a step back to shed light on a facet of Themyscira, revealing that the Amazons&#39; home was a place born of hate and fear, retconning previous canon.

          

Given the heightened interest in Wonder Woman’s sisters with DCU projects like the ongoing Amazon Attacks comic series and the upcoming Paradise Lost TV series, it&#39;s not surprising that DC is tweaking fundamental Wonder Woman lore.





 DC Retcons Themyscira’s Origins, Giving Wonder Woman’s Home a Darker History 
          

In Amazons Attack #3, Queen Nubia and Faruka stumble upon the Amazon Refugee Camp in Greece. It is during a conversation with Ismene Dimakos, the Greek ambassador and head of the refugee camp, that the topic of Themyscira surfaces. Here, readers discover that Themyscira only exists because the original Amazons were so despised that they had to flee and establish their own civilization. This imparts a darker twist to the origins of Wonder Woman’s home and underscores how history appears to be repeating itself with the ongoing conflict between Amazons and humans in the current Amazons Attack storyline.

This revelation about Themyscira&#39;s origin deviates from the current canon surrounding Paradise Island. According to the original lore, Zeus entrusted his son Ares, the god of war, with the creation of a warrior race to propagate peace and justice. Unfortunately, Ares corrupted the Amazons, leading to conflict. To curb the warrior women&#39;s violent tendencies, the goddesses of Olympus intervened, establishing Themyscira as a hidden island paradise where the Amazons could live removed from the world of men. This interpretation suggests that the Amazons actively and knowingly played a role in their own banishment, in contrast to the current narrative of warrior women seeking refuge from unjustified prosecution.




                  Wonder Woman’s Dark Reboot Revealed Fate of Male Babies on Themyscira   DC&#39;s New 52 reboot revamped Wonder Woman&#39;s origins, revealing the darker side of the Amazons and how Themyscira deals with male babies.   



 The Amazons Dark History is Repeating Itself 
          

The Wonder Woman and Amazons Attack storylines primarily revolve around the same crisis event: the expulsion of Amazons from the United States and other countries after what seems to be an Amazon-incited massacre and subsequent attacks. Both Diana and the other Amazons are seeking to reignite peaceful cohabitation. However, history seems to be repeating itself with the new development of the Amazon Refugee Camps in Greece. This isn’t the first time the Amazons have fled the wrath of the man’s world and congregated in a singular place. Hence, Wonder Woman and her sisters may be on the verge of creating a new Amazon territory born once again from fear and hate.
