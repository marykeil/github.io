# Like It Or Not, Batman Now Learned to Fight Crime from Santa Claus


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s canonical backstory reveals that Santa Claus was one of his mentors, teaching him skills he still uses today.   The addition of Santa Claus to Batman&#39;s training may seem odd, but it fits within the larger, fantastical world of the Dark Knight&#39;s adventures.   This unique twist adds a fascinating layer to Batman&#39;s mythos, demonstrating the diverse range of influences on his crime-fighting abilities.

## Literature Review

Yes, Virginia, Santa Claus is seriously one of the mentors who trained Batman and helped turn Bruce Wayne into the crime-fighter he is today.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1!It&#39;s true, one of the mentors who trained Batman was the holiday icon, Santa Claus. As a terrifying collection of monsters is unleashed upon the world, Father Christmas has come to help put an end to them. But the jolly gift-giver&#39;s arrival adds a curious wrinkle to the Dark Knight&#39;s canon backstory.




In Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 by Jeff Parker and Michele Bandini, Batman and Robin investigate the mysterious deaths of carolers and bring in Zatanna to help. Zatanna confirms that the carolers were killed by vampiric monsters known as the Draug, who suddenly return to drag Robin away.

          

Fortunately, the Boy Wonder is saved by Santa Claus, who shoots the monster through the heart. Batman greets Santa, calling him &#39;Kris&#39; while Santa mentions he&#39;s followed Batman&#39;s adventures. As Zatanna is pleasantly surprised at Santa&#39;s existence, Robin expresses disbelief at the idea. But Batman confirms that not only is Santa real, but he taught Batman moves he still uses to this day.


 Santa Claus is Real and He Canonically Trained Batman 
          




Before Bruce Wayne ever donned the cape and cowl, he traveled the world learning as many skills as he could. He trained to fight and investigate, anything that would help him become the crime-fighting force that could save his city&#39;s soul. Much of Bruce&#39;s travels during his years wandering the globe have been unexplored, though various stories have shed light on some of the mentors he trained under prior to returning to Gotham. But despite the mysteries of his travels, it&#39;s known that Bruce trekked nearly all across Earth and that he saw things that defied comprehension.

It&#39;s not that it&#39;s ridiculous that Santa is real in the DC Universe since other stories already confirmed he existed. However, Batman learning skills from Kris Kringle is something that might have fans doing double takes. That said, previous examinations of Bruce&#39;s travels before becoming Batman have added surprising chapters to his history, like his first meeting with Clark Kent as seen in Superman #710. While Batman doesn&#39;t say what exactly he learned from Santa Claus, it&#39;s likely he picked up infiltration skills given Santa&#39;s ability to visit billions of homes in a single night. And for any naysayers, DC Comics billed this miniseries as in-canon, meaning that Santa Claus really was one of Batman&#39;s canonical mentors.






 Santa Claus Has a Canon Place in Batman&#39;s Backstory 
          

Is it a bit odd that Batman learned skills from Santa Claus? Maybe. But it&#39;s no more ridiculous than the rest of Batman&#39;s history. Bruce Wayne is friends with aliens and monsters and has seen dozens of strange cosmic happenings over the course of his life. Meeting and training under Santa Claus isn&#39;t that outlandish for a man who regularly fights a legion of immortal ninjas and a man of living clay. It&#39;s certainly out of left field, but Batman training under Santa Claus is a fascinating and unique addition to the character&#39;s mythos.

Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
