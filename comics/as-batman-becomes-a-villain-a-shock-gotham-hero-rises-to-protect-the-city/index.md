## Literature Review

Batman has been defeated and Gotham City is under the control of the Orgham Family — and so one iconic villain must step up and become a hero.





Summary

  Batman has been defeated by the Orgham family, leaving Gotham without protection. Mr. Freeze steps up to save Batman and teams up with Catwoman.   The Orghams have taken over Gotham using hypnosis and Azmer demons. Their control over the villains has created discontent among them.   Mr. Freeze&#39;s motivation to save Batman stems from his desire to preserve his own experiments and ultimately save his wife. Batman&#39;s rogues unite to rescue their worst enemy.  







Batman has been captured and defeated by the Orgham family, and there&#39;s no one left to protect Gotham — which is why Mr. Freeze has stepped up to save the Dark Knight. The Orgham family has taken over Gotham through the use of large-scale hypnosis and their Azmer demons, which have subjugated Batman&#39;s rogues gallery. The Orghams have become enemies of pretty much everyone, and it might just be their undoing.

Mr. Freeze first teams up with Catwoman to save Batman in Detective Comics #1077 by Ram V, Jason Shawn Alexander, Dave Stewart, and Ariana Maher. In this story, Catwoman is assembling a team to save Batman from the Orghams. Batman is set to be publicly executed in a few days, which will destroy the legacy of Batman forever. Naturally, Catwoman isn&#39;t going to stand by and allow the man she loves to be killed, and the most surprising member of her team is Mr. Freeze.

          




With the Orghams working to control Gotham, the mysterious family has interrupted Victor Fries&#39; experiments to save his wife Nora. Mr. Freeze finally realizes Gotham needs a Batman — if only to preserve his own experiments.

The Orgham family taking over Gotham has proven to be a problem for almost everyone involved. Batman and his family have tried fighting against the Orghams, but they&#39;ve been slowly losing the war. With Batman captured, it seems defeat is inevitable. While some might think the villains would be overjoyed with a defeated Batman, it doesn&#39;t seem like their lives have improved under the rule of the Orgham family in Gotham. Two-Face was one of the first infected with an Azmer demon and strongly resents having to serve them because of it. Mr. Freeze requires something that the Orghams have, but he&#39;s unable to defeat them himself. This means Mr. Freeze needs Batman.




A lot of Batman&#39;s villains are single-minded in their desire for destruction. The Joker is a perfect example, as he is not someone who can be reasoned with, because his goals are purely destruction-based. But this isn&#39;t true for all of Batman&#39;s villains. Characters like the Penguin and Mr. Freeze have clearly defined goals that allow them to be reasoned with. Mr. Freeze wants nothing more than to save his wife Nora. Mr. Freeze will do whatever it takes to save his wife — even if it means teaming up with a group of heroes to rescue his worst enemy.

Batman has often been forced to team up with his villains to battle a greater threat. But a villain coming to Batman&#39;s rescue is much more unusual and hasn&#39;t happened nearly as much over the course of the character&#39;s decades-long history. While most of Batman&#39;s rogues would likely be happy to leave the Dark Knight to die, his legacy forever erased from Gotham City, it&#39;s Mr. Freeze who ends up being the one hero that Batman needs most.
