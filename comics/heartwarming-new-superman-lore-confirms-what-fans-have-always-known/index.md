## Literature Review

A new piece of Superman&#39;s backstory reveals that Clark Kent has always been kind and giving, even in a moment when it&#39;s okay to be a little selfish.




Warning: Spoilers for Batman - Santa Claus: Silent Knight #3 and #4!




Superman&#39;s origin story is one of the most well-known in all of modern storytelling. However, new information about his younger days just dropped, reinforcing to readers just how good of a boy the Man of Steel has always been – and it comes from the most authoritative source possible: Santa Claus.

The must-read holiday series Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight – written by Jeff Parker with art by Michele Bandini and others – reveals that most of the Justice League made it onto Santa&#39;s nice list in their youth. While almost all the heroes have shown shock at discovering that Santa is real, Santa sees through their disguises, remembering every one of them and their childhood addresses.



          

At first Superman was devastated that Batman kept Santa&#39;s existence a secret, but he was starstruck upon meeting the man himself. Santa went above and beyond Clark&#39;s expectations, remembering his Smallville home address, and the letter he wrote when he was only 6 years old.




                  Santa Claus Becomes a True DC Hero with a Genuinely Cool Take on the Fortress of Solitude   Forget the workshop at the North Pole – Santa Claus reveals his inner DC hero with a refreshingly cool take on Superman&#39;s Fortress of Solitude.   


 Superman Didn&#39;t Need Great Power to Feel Great Responsibility 
         

Before Clark Kent even knew he had superpowers, he had a big heart and loved those around him dearly. Santa reveals that when Clark was only 6 years old, his Christmas wish list was for Jonathan and Martha Kent to get a new coffee maker. As a little boy on a rural farm, he didn&#39;t ask for anything for himself - he even already knew he hated coffee - but wished for something that could be given to his parents. To borrow the phrase from Spider-Man&#39;s Uncle Ben, he had a sense of responsibility even without any powers. It&#39;s a heartwarming story about a little boy who grew up to be a good man.




The joy of this series has been seeing how all the heroes react to meeting Santa, and as Santa reveals their childhood wishes. Green Arrow apologizes for always eating the cookies left out for him, young Batgirl asked for a complete set of Nancy Drew, and even Damian Wayne, raised by assassins to murder and rule, wrote Santa a letter when he was five. (He asked for satellites to track his enemies, which is less of a surprise.) The danger and action are real throughout all 4 issues, but the humor and joyful wonder are equally strong, revealing the childish wishes of DC&#39;s biggest heroes.



 Superman Is Best When He&#39;s a Good Man 


          

This holiday miniseries started as a Batman book, but encapsulated what makes a good Superman story, too. Robin is flabbergasted that Santa still delivers Christmas gifts, even if he says the holiday runs itself without him. DC&#39;s big three take turns answering why they think he does it, revealing more about themselves than Santa: Batman thinks it&#39;s because Santa can&#39;t forget the children whose wishes he couldn&#39;t grant, and Wonder Woman says it&#39;s to seek out the good and hope in the world. Superman answers with the knowledge he&#39;s had since he was six years old: &#34;Nothing feels better than giving.&#34;
