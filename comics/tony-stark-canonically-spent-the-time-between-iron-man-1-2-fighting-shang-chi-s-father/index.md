## Literature Review

In between the events of the MCU’s Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Tony Stark spent his time taking down the Ten Rings led by the REAL Mandarin.




Iron Man made a lot of enemies within the MCU, but few were as menacing as the Ten Rings&#39; leader, the Mandarin. During Tony&#39;s history in the MCU continuity, a lot of dangerous men like Obadiah Stane take note of Tony&#39;s contributions to technology with his multiple Iron Man suits and the Arc Reactor. After Stane fails in his scheme to weaponize Tony’s tech, the billionaire prepares himself to face the wrath of Shang-Chi’s father: Xu Wenwu aka the Mandarin.




The 2010 miniseries Iron Man 2: Public Identity by Justin Theroux, Joe Casey, and Ron Lim takes place after Tony publicly reveals his identity at the end of the first Iron Man film.

          

The comic sees Tony Stark suit up as Iron Man to continue his ongoing blood feud against the Ten Rings. The Mandarin has been controlling the criminal underground for millennia with the Ten Rings. He used the Rings to expand his power and reach across the globe, terrorizing cities and governments. Wenwu is also obsessed with strength through absolute power, including special technology. With his eyes and ears worldwide, the Mandarin has always had Tony Stark on his list of special talents who could serve him and his army. But Tony seemingly digs his own grave by uttering the words, “I am Iron Man,” to the public.




                  Black Widow Canonically Spent the Time Between Iron Man 2 &amp; Avengers Fighting Shang-Chi&#39;s Father   While it was a mystery what Black Widow was doing between Iron Man 2 and The Avengers in the MCU, fans now know: she was fighting Shang-Chi&#39;s father.    


 Iron Man Revealing His Identity Makes Him Public Enemy #1 


          

Revealing his identity as Iron Man to the world, makes Tony an easy target for the Ten Rings and others. Tony had a complicated history with the Ten Rings during his weapon-inventing days. During an arms deal, it was the Ten Rings who ambushed and kidnapped Tony. They forced him into making weapons for them, which sets up his journey to becoming Iron Man. After escaping their clutches with the Iron Man Mark-1 suit, Tony knew eventually the Ten Rings would come back for revenge. Not only that, but in the comic, the U.S. Army wants a piece of Iron Man’s tech, and they won’t stop until they control it and Tony Stark himself.




Tony’s carelessness with his secret identity is his greatest weakness. As Iron Man, he operates on his own time and chases down anyone linked to the Ten Rings. However, General Thunderbolt Ross decides Tony needs to be put in check by the U.S. government, and he calls for the assistance of Justin Hammer to even the odds. With the Ten Rings and the U.S. army gunning for him, Tony is forced to battle them as Iron Man. The more Tony continues his heroic but reckless missions around the world, the more chaos and distrust he creates with potential allies.



 Tony’s Lone Wolf Attitude Continues To Anger The Mandarin 
          

If there is one thing the Mandarin won’t tolerate, it’s recklessness. The Ten Rings organization has been obsessed with controlling history itself, but Tony is their single greatest weakness. As Tony hunts down the Ten Rings and disrupts their plans, such as killing mine-sniffing dogs, he sends a direct message to the Mandarin. No one, not even the Ten Rings, Justin Hammer’s machines, or the U.S. Army, will stop Tony Stark from being his own hero. Thanks to Iron Man, the Mandarin is reminded of how he could have had access to the greatest technological advancement in human history.
