## Literature Review

One of the Joker&#39;s worst crimes is killing Jason Todd — and it turns out he only did it so another villain wouldn&#39;t beat him to the punch.




The Joker famously killed Jason Todd&#39;s Robin — but one villain nearly killed another Robin long before the Joker&#39;s infamous crime. Due to the sheer popularity of the Joker, he&#39;s hurt Batman far more than comic villains usually get to hurt their heroes, and that includes constantly targeting the Bat-Family.




The first time a Robin comes close to death is featured in Robin: Year One #2 by Chuck Dixon, Scott Beatty, Javier Pulido, Robert Campanella, Lee Loughridge, and Sean Konot. This story chronicles the first adventures of Dick Grayson as Robin, including his successes and his failures.

          

While Dick proves to be a capable detective and an amazing crime-fighter, he underestimates some of Batman&#39;s more dangerous enemies. This results in Dick Grayson&#39;s Robin nearly being beaten to death by Two-Face, which the Joker is not happy about. This event seems to be what convinces the Joker to kill Robin before anyone else can.

                  Joker Just Got His Own Robin - &amp; Their Identity Is Heartbreaking   Joker finally has his own Boy Wonder, as a vulnerable character from earlier in his story is pulled into the Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s evil.   





 


 The Joker Promises To Kill Robin 
          

While Dick Grayson survives this potentially deadly encounter with Two-Face, the event is traumatic enough that Batman immediately fires him from the role. Dick doesn&#39;t get to be Robin again for several weeks — until he proves that he would never stop fighting crime. Eventually, Dick is fired from Robin again — for the final time — when the Joker nearly kills Dick by shooting him with a gun, causing him to almost fall off a building. This event causes Batman to finally retire the role of Robin — until he finds another Robin literally two days later in Jason Todd.

After the Joker discovers that Two-Face nearly killed Robin, he ominously tells Batman that he called dibs first. The Joker tries to make good on this promise when he shoots Dick, nearly killing the original Boy Wonder, but he didn&#39;t succeed. He finally achieves his goal of killing Robin when the Joker manages to kill Jason Todd in a scene no comic book fan will ever forget. This is a major moment in the Joker&#39;s history and has made him one of the most popular villains in the DC Universe, and it only happens because the Joker was once worried that Two-Face would kill a Robin before he ever got the chance.






 Two-Face Nearly Kills Dick Grayson (and the Joker Isn&#39;t Pleased) 
          

Killing Robin is a major feat for any Gotham villain — to the point that it&#39;s almost become a game to see who can do it next and achieve that badge of honor. Two-Face very nearly was the first villain to ever claim a Robin, but the Joker managed to be the first with the brutal killing of Jason Todd, which changed the mantle of Robin forever. Since then, other Robins have been killed, including Damian Wayne and Stephanie Brown. While these are all tragic deaths, the first Robin will always have been killed by the Joker.



Robin: Year One #2 is available now from DC Comics!
