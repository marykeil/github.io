## Literature Review

The new Transformers series is teasing the return of one powerful Decepticon. But could it be Megatron... or a Depecticon much, much worse?




WARNING! Potential spoilers ahead for Transformers #5




The Transformers are back thanks to new publisher Skybound and the Energon Universe line, but one character has been noticeably absent. Megatron has yet to make his Energon Universe debut, but the recently released solicitation for Transformers #5 promises the return of one major Decepticon. A major clue on the issue’s cover points to it being none other than the baddest Decepticon of them all, but is it possible there is more than meets the eye going on the image?

Releasing on February 14th of next year, Transformers #5 will continue the story of the Transformers on Earth as &#34;Starscream revives one of the most powerful Decepticons to eliminate the Autobots once and for all.&#34;. Before their spaceship crashed on Earth, Decepticon leader Megatron attacked Optimus Prime and the Autobots, and disappeared after the battle.

          




The cover for Transformers #5 features artwork from series artists Daniel Warren Johnson and Mike Spicer, and features Optimus reaching down towards a massive pile of armaments. Sitting on top of that pile is a very distinctive gun: Megatron’s famed fusion cannon, which is typically mounted on his forearm.


 Is Megatron Truly Returning In Transformers #5? 
          

In spite of the appearance of Megatron’s fusion cannon on the cover, there are a few reasons to doubt that the Decepticon leader will be making his appearance in the actual issue. Chief amongst them all is the fact that the Decepticon brought back in the issue is resurrected by Starscream, who has already declared himself the Decepticons’ leader in Megatron’s absence. Given Starscream’s constant schemes to steal power away from Megatron in the classic G1 continuity, it seems highly unlikely that the leader of the Seekers would bring back his former boss now that he’s finally secured his power base amongst the surviving Decepticons on Earth.




Also, the presence of Megatron’s signature weapon by itself leads credence to the popular fan theory that Megatron is already on Earth, in the possession of none other than Cobra Commander. The Commander can be seen holding a gun that looks exactly like Megatron’s alt-mode in the cover images revealed thus far, and it is noticeably missing the scope that becomes Megatron’s fusion cannon when he transforms into a giant robot. Given that the cannon seen on the cover for Transformers #5 has clearly been ripped off of Megatron’s arm, it gives further credence to the idea that Cobra Commander found a damaged Megatron and is using him for his own ends.



 Which Decepticon Will Starscream Resurrect? 
         

If not Megatron, then which Decepticon will Starscream resurrect? His fellow Sky Brother and Seeker Thundercracker made a brief appearance in Transformers #1, so it is always a possibility that Starscream would want to bring him back to complete the classic Sky Brothers trio with he and Skywarp. The revelation that he will bring back “one of the most powerful Decepticons” creates several tantalizing possibilities, everyone from Scorponok, Blitzwing or the combined form of the Constructicons, Devastator. Fans will just have to keep reading the Energon Universe Transformers series to find out which Decepticon will make their grand return.




Transformers #5 is available February 14th, 2024 from Skybound Entertainment
