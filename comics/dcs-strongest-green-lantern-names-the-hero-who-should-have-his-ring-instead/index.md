## Literature Review

John Stewart is one of the Green Lantern Corps&#39; brightest lights, but the Master Builder knows who deserves his ring more than he does.





Summary

  John Stewart admires his mother so much that he believes she deserves his Green Lantern ring more than he does.   John Stewart&#39;s mother, Shirley Stewart, is a Civil Rights leader in the DC Universe, making her a prime candidate for a power ring.   John Stewart&#39;s opinion carries great weight in the Green Lantern Corps, and if he looks up to his mother, she must be worthy of respect and would make an ideal Green Lantern.  







As DC’s most powerful Green Lantern, John Stewart has long since proven himself to be one of the greatest heroes the Green Lantern Corps has to offer. But there’s one hero that Green Lantern will always look up to: his mother. John admires the former civil rights leader so much that he thinks she deserves his ring even more than he does.

Green Lantern: War Journal #3 by Phillip Kennedy Johnson and Montos finds John Stewart recovering from a battle against the mysterious Radiant Dead — only to learn that he’s the only man who can defeat this new villainous force, much to his disappointment. Hesitant to leave his ailing mother, he visits her in the hospital as she recovers from the creatures’ attack and tries to make peace with breaking the promise he made never to leave her again.

          




Telling his unconscious mother just how much she inspires him, John admits he’s never quite felt like he’s been worthy of the hero title she gave him. Praising her for the example she set for him and his sister, he even tells her: “You’re the one who shoulda got that ring, not me.”

 Green Lantern John Stewart Has to Live Up to a Big Legacy 
          

Based on everything John Stewart has said about his mother in the past, it’s no surprise that he thinks her worthy of the Green Lantern title. After all, the primary directive of a Green Lantern is to overcome fear. And there are few individuals more courageous in or out of comics than Civil Rights leaders like Shirley Stewart. Her notable past as a Civil Rights activist in the DC Universe makes her a prime candidate for a power ring.




Having proven his worthiness of the Lantern’s Light countless times, the Master Builder John Stewart is one of the Corps’ greatest beacons, even without his ring. Because of that, his opinion holds great weight. John has spoken of his mother’s influence on his heroism since his earliest appearances. And with her history and their relationship, it’s easy to see both how she would have inspired him to become a hero and how he may feel like he can never measure up to her example. Fortunately for the DCU, John has already measured up — on multiple occasions — even before he became the most powerful Green Lantern.



 Green Lantern Takes After His Mother 
          

John Stewart is one of the greatest members of the Green Lantern Corps and long-established as its most powerful. Anyone that the Master Builder looks up to is clearly worthy of respect within the DCU. And if Shirley Stewart is anything like her son, she would make the ideal — and super powerful — Green Lantern.
