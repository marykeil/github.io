# Tony Stark s Last Words to His Father Totally Explain His MCU Personality


## SUMMARY 



  Tony Stark&#39;s personality in the MCU was shaped by his last conversation with his father, as revealed in an official tie-in comic.   Howard Stark&#39;s comment about Tony being brilliant but immature became Tony&#39;s default personality as an adult.   The conversation also hides a major easter egg, as Tony fulfills his father&#39;s unfinished work in Iron Man 2, giving him closure.

## Literature Review

The last words Tony Stark ever said to his father were revealed in 1 MCU tie-in comic, and that conversation completely explains his MCU personality. 




Tony Stark’s personality in the MCU reshaped how the world saw Iron Man, as the arrogant jerk so often seen in the pages of Marvel Comics became a brilliant yet semi-narcissistic man-child with a heart of gold in the MCU. This was exclusively due to the unparalleled performance from Tony Stark actor Robert Downey, Jr., but an actor’s performance is only the meta explanation for the reason a certain character acts the way they do within any given continuity. As far as an in-world explanation goes, Tony Stark’s MCU personality can be attributed to his last conversation with his father.




Stark’s quippy wit, heroic spirit, and genuinely good heart made fans care deeply about him as a character, despite the fact that Tony’s more personal character development wouldn’t be totally fleshed out for many years following his MCU debut - including and especially his relationship with his father. While fans did get a peek into Tony and Howard Stark&#39;s relationship in the direct sequel, Iron Man 2, the true nature of that relationship wouldn’t be revealed until Captain America: Civil War, as that’s when fans learn when Tony’s parents died, and what kind of impact that had on him.

          

But, as it turns out, even that film failed to scratch the surface of how impactful Tony’s last interaction with his father truly was. Thankfully, Marvel Comics released an official MCU tie-in comic that gave fans much more meaningful insight into Tony’s relationship with his father, as well as a key piece of information that would be paid off in Iron Man’s personal MCU saga.





 Iron Man MCU Tie-In Comic Actually Shows Tony Stark’s Last Conversation With His Father 
         

In the canonical MCU prelude comic Iron Man 2: Public Identity #3 by Justin Theroux, Joe Casey, and Ron Lim, readers are shown the unadulterated final interaction between Tony Stark and his father, as opposed to the imperfect memory generated by Stark Industries’ B.A.R.F. system as shown in Captain America: Civil War.

Tony Stark is floating in his pool after coming home from college. His father, Howard, tells Tony that there is a lot about what he does that he’s never told Tony, and that they need to have that conversation when he gets back from a &#39;business trip&#39;. Howard also says that he hopes Tony doesn’t stay as immature as he is forever, only for Tony to claim that he ‘knows what he’s doing’.



 Tony Stark’s Last Conversation With His Dad Hides A Major MCU Easter Egg 
          




Howard Stark calls his son brilliant but immature during their final conversation, which is why ‘brilliant but immature’ basically becomes Tony’s default personality into adulthood. Tony’s reaction to this comment is also a major aspect of the person he’d grow into as an adult, as he’s always trying to prove to himself and those around him that he does, in fact, ‘know what he’s doing’. But beyond that, this last conversation also hides a major easter egg: the element Tony Stark would succeed in creating in Iron Man 2. The conversation Howard wanted to have with his son comes to fruition after his death during the events of Iron Man 2, as Tony finishes the work his father started so many years earlier, thus giving him a level of closure movie fans weren’t even aware of at the time.

The final conversation Tony had with Howard Stark was shown to be incredibly impactful in the MCU films alone, for the sole reason that that was the last time the two of them ever spoke. However, this tie-in comic shows that it was much more meaningful than the B.A.R.F. memory revealed in Captain America: Civil War, as Tony Stark’s last words to his father totally explain his MCU personality, while also making the events of Iron Man 2 that much more impactful.
