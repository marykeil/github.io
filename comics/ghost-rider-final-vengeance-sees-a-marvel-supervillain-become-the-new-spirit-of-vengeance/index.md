## Literature Review

The forthcoming Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance #1 will see a super-villain become the new host for the Spirit of Vengeance--but who will it be?




The forthcoming Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance sees a Marvel villain become the new Spirit of Vengeance. Writer Benjamin Percy has put Ghost Rider through his paces over the past two years, giving him a sidekick and sending Johnny Blaze down a horrifying path. Now, the Spirit of Vengeance has departed from Johnny, bonding itself to a villain–which could spell bad news for the Marvel Universe.




Marvel shared a first look at Ghost Rider: Final Vengeance #1’s cover on their website. The book will be written by Percy and drawn by Danny Kim, with Benjamin Su providing a special foil cover. Marvel did not reveal which villain would bond with the Spirit of Vengeance, assuring fans it would be revealed soon.

          

Likewise, Su’s cover does not clear the matter up either–fans must wait patiently to discover the new Ghost Rider’s identity.


 Ghost Rider Has Seen a Lot in 50 Years 
          

Ghost Rider has been a staple of the supernatural side of the Marvel Universe since his first appearance in the early 1970s. There have been many Ghost Riders throughout history, with several in the 20th/21st centuries alone, but Johnny Blaze remains the best known. After a brief stint as the King of Hell, Johnny Blaze returned to the role, and has barely had time to stop since his return. First, he fought off an evil demon threatening a small town. Along the way, he meets Talia Warroad, a former SHIELD agent and mystic, who becomes Ghost Rider’s unofficial sidekick. Benjamin Percy has given Ghost Rider his groove back.




Now, Johnny Blaze’s entire world has been upended as he has been separated from the Spirit of Vengeance. To add insult to injury, the Spirit has bonded with a villain. Marvel is still being coy over the identity of the new Ghost Rider, not even offering hints in the press release. While the most logical candidate would be a supernatural-based character, other types of villains cannot be ruled out. How exactly a Spirit of Vengeance, a tool of revenge and justice, could bond with an evil villain remains to be seen too. This could also tamper with powers such as the Penance Stare.

                  Ghost Rider&#39;s True Speed Revealed as Marvel Puts a Number on the Hell Cycle&#39;s Power   The Hell Cycle has always been a source of intrigue for Ghost Rider fans and has begs the question: how fast can the bike really drive?   



 A Villain Can Corrupt Ghost Rider&#39;s Mission 
          




Regardless of the new Ghost Rider’s identity, a villain possessing the Spirit of Vengeance is a terrifying notion, and Johnny Blaze will have to work quickly to stop them. The potential for destruction and violence is great, as they could flip the script on Ghost Rider’s iconic powers, such as Hellfire and the Penance Stare. In the wrong hands, these powers could cause serious damage and trauma, in the process, flipping the script on everything Ghost Rider stands for.
