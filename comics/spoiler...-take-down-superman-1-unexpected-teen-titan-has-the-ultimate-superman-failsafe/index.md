## Literature Review

Superman is one of the most powerful characters in comic books, but one surprising young DC Comics hero was able to take him down with ease.




Warning! Contains Spoilers For Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #4!




One of the most powerful characters to ever grace comic books is Superman – but recently, Blue Beetle managed to take Superman down surprisingly easily. Battling Superman is practically a hopeless challenge for the majority of villains and heroes in the DC Universe, which made it all the more surprising when Blue Beetle got the best of him.

Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #4 – written by Jeff Parker, with art by Danny Kim, Stephen Segovia, Alex Sinclair, and Pat Brosseau – finds Superman possessed by wayward spirits after he rushes to save Santa Claus. These spirits forced Superman to join the side of the Krampus, which resulted in the Justice League needing to find a way to quickly bring the Man of Steel down.



          

The surprising hero to step up to the task though was Blue Beetle, as his scarab armor allows him to do a ton of different things, and apparently, the hidden skill that Blue Beetle has is the ability to generate Kryptonite radiation on command.




                  BLUE BEETLE #1 Gives Hero the Fresh Start He Deserves (Review)   Blue Beetle #1 brings Jaime Reyes back to into the spotlight with an exciting new story that promises fun, adventure, and big changes for the hero.   


 Superman Goes On A Rampage Against The Justice League 


          

Jamie Reyes was a young boy when he came into contact with the Blue Beetle scarab, which is Alien technology from the race known as the Reach. Jamie found the scarab one day after school by sheer chance, and the scarab ended up bonding with him. This granted Jamie major powers and made him an almost instant superhero. From that day on, Jamie tried to understand his new abilities and use them to help others. The scarab offers Jamie a ton of powers, and apparently, one of these powers makes Blue Beetle a major threat to Kryptonians, such as Superman.




The Scarab grants Jamie a whole host of powers, and as such, it&#39;s not unusual to see Jamie firing off energy blasts from a hand cannon while he&#39;s fighting villains. What is unusual is the fact the Blue Beetle scarab can apparently create all different kinds of radiation on command as well. The best example of this was when Blue Beetle was able to generate Kryptonite radiation to hurt Superman. This ability completely took Superman by surprise and shut him down fairly quickly. Blue Beetle does admit that doing this took a great deal of energy on his part, but he was still able to do it.



 Blue Beetle Takes Superman Down With Kryptonite Radiation 


          

Kryptonite is pretty difficult to come by, so the ability to simply mimic its radiation on command is absurdly useful. Blue Beetle is a young hero who doesn&#39;t always get the respect he deserves, but managing to bring down Superman is a major feat in the boy&#39;s favor. Superman is an absurdly powerful being and one of the greatest heroes on Earth, the Justice League has worked pretty hard to reduce Kryptonite on Earth for his safety. This makes Blue Beetle one of the greatest heroes to stand up against a rogue Superman, due to his ability to generate Kryptonite radiation from his own armor.
