## Literature Review

Shonen Jump&#39;s Dandadan keeps getting sidetracked, but chapter #129 continues a controversial storyline that&#39;s the reason why the series is R-Rated.




Warning: Spoilers for Dandadan chapter #129A highly controversial storyline in Shonen Jump&#39;s Dandadan is resuming after getting sidetracked numerous times. Best of all, the series&#39; most ridiculous character, Turbo Granny, is leading the charge, which is appropriate given she&#39;s the reason for the series&#39; plot in the first place.






Although officially published in Shonen Jump&#43; in Japan and Manga PLUS worldwide, Shonen Jump features Yukinobu Tatsu&#39;s Dandadan on its app and website.




Way back in chapter #9 of Dandadan, the once hostile yokai Turbo Granny blackmailed Okarun and his friends to spare her life by stealing Okarun&#39;s &#34;family jewels.&#34; Of course, she lost possession of them, and, although the first was recovered soon afterward, the second has been missing ever since.

          

After a few back-and-forths, the search for the second jewel has finally resumed in the latest installment, chapter #129. The jewel had been at a local police station, but a currently undisclosed entity recently claimed it. And since Okarun and Momo already tried and failed to get more information from the police a few chapters ago, the two have tasked Turbo Granny, whose consciousness is trapped inside a cat statue, with infiltrating the police station and masquerading as a lost-and-found item to search police records to see who claimed it.





 Dandadan&#39;s R-Rated Hunt For Okarun&#39;s &#39;Jewels&#39; Continues at Last 
          

The first time Okarun and his friends thought they had found the second jewel was in Dandadan chapters #63 and 64 when an object that looked like it suddenly appeared. However, the target turned out to be something else entirely and launched a whole other story with the new character and alien Vamola. That story only recently concluded after the subsequent defeat of a major alien invasion during an all-out war, which almost culminated in Vamola&#39;s death.

It wasn&#39;t until much later in chapter #123 that a new soon-to-be member of the gang named Rin Sawaki points Okarun in the direction of the aforementioned local police station. However, much like Vamola, Rin&#39;s own drama soon dragged Okarun and his friends into helping her with something else entirely for the next few chapters. Now that Rin&#39;s problem has been sorted out, Okarun and the gang can focus on gathering more information about his second jewel.




Based on past precedent, it&#39;s likely that whatever Turbo Granny finds at the police station will send Okarun and the gang on another goose chase. Regardless, it&#39;s still a big deal that Turbo Granny will serve a more important role in this capacity since she has mostly been nothing more than comic relief who makes humorous comments in absurd poses. The only recent time she&#39;s played a more consequential role was when she briefly helped Okarun train to fight yokai composers in Dandadan chapter #57.



 Dandadan Continues to Be Shonen Jump&#43;&#39;s Most Ridiculous Manga 
          

For now, fans will have to wait an additional week before the story continues, since the series is taking a rare but well-deserved break. Yukinobu Tatsu has somehow been able to stick to the same demanding weekly schedule as other Shonen Jump series even though he draws at least one amazingly detailed spread each chapter and isn&#39;t even in the main magazine. Regardless, Dandadan chapter #130&#39;s twist will sure to be just as ridiculous as everyone is expecting, if not more so.
