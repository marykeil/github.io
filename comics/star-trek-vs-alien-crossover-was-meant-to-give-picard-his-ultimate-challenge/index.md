# Star Trek vs Alien Crossover Was Meant to Give Picard His Ultimate Challenge


## SUMMARY 



  Star Trek and Alien crossover would have given Captain Picard his biggest challenge, with Xenomorphs, the Borg, and the Romulans involved.   The scrapped book, Acceptable Losses, had the potential for an explosive and epic story that fans were deprived of.   While Starfleet has advanced technology and weaponry, a crossover would have posed a significant fight, especially with the presence of the deadly Xenomorphs, Romulans, and the Borg.

## Literature Review

A proposed Star Trek/Aliens crossover would have pit Captain Picard against his biggest challenge: assimilated Xenomorphs.




A scrapped crossover between Star Trek and Alien would have given Captain Picard his biggest challenge. Star Trek has crossed over with several other pop culture franchises, and in the 2010s, fans nearly got to see the crew of the Enterprise encounter the deadly Xenomorphs. The book, titled Acceptable Losses, was announced, and preliminary art was created, gunning for a 2017 release. However, the book was scrapped, depriving the world of what promised to be an explosive crossover.




Rich Handley, a noted Star Trek comics historian, had details about the project on his website. Timed to coincide with Star Trek: The Next Generation’s 30th anniversary, Acceptable Losses would have been jointly published by IDW and Dark Horse, the latter of which held the Aliens comic license. Plot details are scarce, but according to Handley, not only would the book have featured Xenomorphs, but the Borg and the Romulans as well. While nothing else is known of the story, preliminary art also exists that paints a gruesome picture of what could have been.

         

The project was unceremoniously scrapped, with some attributing it to the objections of Alien director Ridley Scott.


 A Star Trek and Alien Crossover Could Be the Stuff of Legends 
          




Star Trek’s crossovers with other franchises have been sparse, but memorable. Beginning with 1996’s Star Trek: The Next Generation/X-Men, various crews have met the likes of Green Lantern and the Doctor, and have traveled to the Planet of the Apes. These franchises, like Star Trek, are science fiction-based, making for the perfect crossover. With this in mind, a meeting between the Enterprise and a Xenomorph or two makes perfect sense. 

Acceptable Losses’ was canceled before it ever got to print, depriving fans of what could have been an epic story. The crew of the Enterprise has met many fascinating alien species in their day, but the Xenomorphs are unlike anything they have encountered before. They would give Starfleet major problems, as Xenomorphs could get loose on starships and bases. However, given the Federation’s highly advanced technology, particularly in terms of scanning/analytical devices, Xenomorphs would not stay hidden in their hosts for long. Furthermore, Starfleet possesses more powerful weapons than Weyland Yutani, weapons that could easily dispose of a Xenomorph. They would give the Federation a hard time, but not for long.

This is not to say that it would be a total cakewalk. In fact, it could be one of the biggest, and deadliest, fights of Picard’s career. Xenomorphs alone are bad news, but factor in the Romulans and the Borg somehow, and the situation becomes even more dire–as well as more intriguing. The presence of the Borg alone raises numerous questions, such as the Borg’s ability to assimilate a Xenomorph or their ability to implant a face hugger in a drone. A crossover between the Star Trek and Alien franchises could be the stuff of legends, but, thanks to corporate politics, will likely never happen.
