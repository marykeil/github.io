Warning! This article contains spoilers for Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe #1 Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is an undeniably epic Sci-Fi action/adventure series with the first film installment - Netflix’s Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire - already proving as much. One of the more captivating aspects of the film was the initially mysterious Bloodaxe family, and even after Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe appeared, there was still a great deal unsaid about who they are, who their family is, where they came from, and how they got involved in the war. But now, all those questions and more are about to be answered, as the hit Netflix film Rebel Moon is getting its own prequel series delving specifically into the Bloodaxe family: Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe.




The four-part miniseries Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe is published by Titan Comics, is written by Magdalene Visaggio and drawn by Clark Bent. A trailer for the first issue of Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe was released by Titan Comics, one which highlights the captivating art style while showing fans what they can expect from the upcoming storyline.


 


As war is looming on the horizon on the planet Shasu, the leader of the Bloodaxe family is conflicted between living up to his father’s domineering legacy and maintaining the peace. It is up to him to settle the conflicts within himself, and his family, before the entire planet erupts in war.


The preview and official description of Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe confirms that this story will do more than simply expand on the origin of Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, but the origin of their entire people, as well as the events leading up to the planet of Shasu getting itself involved in this galactic war to begin with.

 House of the Bloodaxe Prequel Will Explain The Origins of Rebel Moon’s Rebels 
          




In Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire, the Bloodaxe family is a high-priority target for the Imperium, as they are the leaders of the Rebellion. While it wasn’t made explicitly clear in the film why or how this particular family held such a high standing in the galactic rebellion, viewers saw first-hand why they were considered so dangerous, as the climactic battle of the film saw both Devra and Darrian slaughter a number of Imperium soldiers single-handedly. Now, with the release of the House of the Bloodaxe prequel, fans will see that Devra and Darrian were all but thrusted into their roles as rebels, as their entire planet of Shasu is seemingly waging war on the Mother World itself, a war led by the Bloodaxe patriarch, pressured by the legacy of the Bloodaxe family to defeat the Imperium - a legacy Devra and Darrian are seemingly forced to continue in Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire.

While there is still mystery surrounding this entire series, including exactly what fans can expect to see, the one thing that is clear is that war is looming in Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe, as the official prequel to Zack Snyder’s Sci-Fi universe promises to flesh out the world of Rebel Moon even further.
