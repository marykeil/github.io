## Literature Review

Behind every great man is a great woman, as the saying goes. For Kingpin in the MCU, Vanessa is his calming force, but his new wife riles him up.




Warning: Spoilers for The Amazing Spider-Man #41!




Marvel is starting to show off exactly how Kingpin&#39;s new wife is the dark opposite of his previous wife. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s live-action shows, Wilson Fisk&#39;s on-screen wife was depicted as Vanessa Fisk, the character most associated with being married to Kingpin. Much like how she is often portrayed in the comics, the MCU Vanessa serves as a calming influence, existing to quell the raging storm that is her husband.

Kingpin&#39;s new wife, Typhoid Mary, proves to be the exact opposite in The Amazing Spider-Man #41 by Zeb Wells, John Romita Jr., Scott Hanna, Marcio Menyz, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna. Typhoid Mary is a mutant with a fractured psyche who was once frequently featured as a Daredevil villain. More recently, she&#39;s settled down as Wilson Fisk&#39;s second wife and one of the most dangerous assets on his roster.



          




She&#39;s not only dangerous for what she&#39;s capable of, but for the worst she brings out of Kingpin. While his last wife would help simmer down Kingpin&#39;s temper, Mary intentionally riles him up to make him a better fighter.


 Typhoid Mary Acts Weird to Set Up Tombstone vs. Kingpin 
          

The Marvel Universe is currently in the midst of a &#34;Gang War&#34; in which all the resident criminal crews of New York are interlocked in warfare with each other over newly opened territories, spreading chaos throughout the city in the process. To calm the fires, Spider-Man has had to make some unusual alliances, including with frequent rival Tombstone. Tombstone&#39;s daughter, The Beetle, is currently feuding with the Kingpin&#39;s son, The Rose, over who can claim new territory uptown. Alongside She-Hulk and Spider-Man, Tombstone sets up a meeting with Kingpin, his wife, and their Hellfire Club to extend an olive branch of sorts with their children on the line.




It soon becomes apparent that the two parents aren&#39;t exactly seeing eye to eye. As tensions between Wilson and Tombstone continue to grow during their conversation, Typhoid Mary starts acting strangely in the background. She won&#39;t stop smirking and pointing at She-Hulk and Spidey, much to the confusion of the heroes. Wilson snaps at his wife, asking why she keeps acting like this, to which she says, &#34;Because it makes you crazy. And you fight so good when you&#39;re crazy.&#34; She is proven right moments later when a fight breaks out between Kingpin and Tombstone, one that Kingpin wins after his wife drives him so crazy.



 Kingpin Is a Better Fighter When He&#39;s Crazy 
          

Typhoid Mary continues to motivate Kingpin in different ways. During the X-Men&#39;s Fall of X storylines, Wilson Fisk has proven to be an unexpected ally to mutantkind. He attended the Hellfire Gala last year as a genuine supporter of the festivities and then emerged as a human witness to speak in support of mutantkind about the massacre. The former NYC mayor&#39;s support of mutants all boils down to his relationship with his wife, a mutant. Whether it is helping him improve as a fighter or showing an uncharacteristic amount of empathy, Typhoid Mary makes Kingpin simply better in ways Vanessa never could.
