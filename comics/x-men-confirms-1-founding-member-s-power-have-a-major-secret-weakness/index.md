# X-Men Confirms 1 Founding Member s Power Have a Major Secret Weakness


## SUMMARY 



  As revealed in The Original X-Men #1, Angel&#39;s wings can be easily grounded by removing crucial &#34;flight feathers&#34;.   Warren&#39;s wings are visually stunning but impractical and easily injured, as his history has made clear time and again.   Warren has compensated for his weakness for the years, most notably when his original wings were amputated and replaced with steel wings, granted by Apocalypse in exchange for serving him as a Horseman.

## Literature Review

The original X-Men each possess incredible abilities, but they&#39;re not without their flaws, and one founding member has one surprising weakness.




Contains spoilers for The Original X-Men #1!!




The five original X-Men possessed extraordinary abilities and an insurmountable will to protect the rest of mutantkind. They were hardly without their limitations, however, and one founding member had a startlingly simple weakness. Angel&#39;s magnificent wings carried him through the skies, but all it takes to ground him is the removal of crucial &#34;flight feathers.&#34;

The Original X-Men #1 – by Christos Gage, Greg Land, Jay Leisten, and Frank D&#39;Armata – features younger versions of the O5 as they step outside their own timeline to set things right in a world ruled by a power-hungry incarnation of the Phoenix. As they attempt to reach Iceman, Angel interferes, ending up in a short-lived battle in the skies with his younger self and Beast.

          




The first X-Men squad knows each other incredibly well. As a result, Beast is poised to recognize one of the numerous glaring flaws in Angel&#39;s mutant wings. Losing just a feather or two yanks Warren from the air.


 Angel&#39;s Mutant Ability Is Easily Thwarted 
          

Every mutant has some type of weakness, but some are easier to exploit than others. It took years of hard work for the original X-Men team to unlock and use the potential of their powers. Unfortunately, all that training didn&#39;t make Warren&#39;s wings any sturdier. All it takes to bring him down is a well-placed grab. Hank specifically mentions that he removed flight feathers, which seem to be the key. Warren isn&#39;t bothered by the idea of losing some feathers, as he notes that Hank has a few in his mouth, so it takes some finesse to get to the right ones. Still, Angel&#39;s wings are out on full display when he uses them, leaving them ripe for the picking.




Flight feathers are hardly Angel&#39;s only problem, either. There&#39;s already an incredible degree of impracticality to his power. As visually stunning as it is to see his wings unfurl, they&#39;re an enormous target, especially in their original form. He can&#39;t fly with them bound, they&#39;re easily injured, and upon being removed, he has no way to regenerate them on his own. Warren is hardly O5 X-Man with a weakness, but the delicate nature of his wings remains the easiest to exploit. Fortunately, though training and drills don&#39;t make them more physically resilient, they do make Warren better at using them, and guarding himself. Hank&#39;s move in The Original X-Men #1 just caught him unaware.



 Warren Has Had To Compensate For His Weaknesses 
          

As easily dismantled as his iconic white wings are, they&#39;re not the only ones. Warren has possessed through the years. The steel wings granted by Apocalypse, in exchange for Warren becoming one of his Horsemen, don&#39;t sport the same weakness. They may be impractical for different reasons, but they&#39;ll keep him aloft beyond someone removing a single blade. Only Warren&#39;s closest friends seem to know about the flight feathers, since Hank takes advantage of it, meaning he&#39;s largely safe so long as it&#39;s a well-kept secret. It&#39;s also unknown how quickly the flight feathers regenerate, so even though it grounds him, the condition is temporary. Angel&#39;s particular weakness is debilitating,, but the X-Men are experts at making the most of disadvantages.
