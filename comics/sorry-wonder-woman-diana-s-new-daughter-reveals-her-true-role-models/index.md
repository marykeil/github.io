## Literature Review

Though Trinity loves and admires her mother, a new story reveals that Wonder Woman&#39;s daughter really wants to be like Jon Kent and Damian Wayne.




Warning: Contains spoilers for Wonder Woman #4As Wonder Woman, Princess Diana of Themyscira has spent decades as a role model for the DC Universe, including most recently for her new daughter, Trinity. After getting a look at her greatest desire, however, Trinity reveals that there are actual two heroes who inspire her even more than her own mother.




Wonder Woman #4&#39;s back-up story &#34;World&#39;s Finest Part 2&#34; by Tom King, Belén Ortega, Alejandro Sánchez and Clayton Cowles features Lizzie Prince as she is once again babysat by Jon Kent and Damian Wayne. When Lizzie&#39;s babysitters leave her unaccompanied in the Fortress of Solitude, she makes use of the Black Mercy, a parasitic alien planet that shows people their greatest desires.

          

Though Lizzie&#39;s Black Mercy vision starts with the Super Sons bowing to her might, she quickly realizes it&#39;s a fake reality. Her one true wish, Lizzie tells them, is &#34;to be like you. Good like you. The best like you.&#34;

 Wonder Woman&#39;s Daughter Sees Superman and Robin as Her Brothers 
          

When Lizzie is being babysat in the Fortress of Solitude, she gets her hands on Black Mercy, a plant with its roots in the lore of DC&#39;s original trinity of heroes. The alien plant first appeared in 1985&#39;s Superman Annual #11 in a story titled &#34;For the Man Who Has Everything.&#34; The story by Alan Moore, Dave Gibbons, and Tom Ziuko, features Batman, Wonder Woman, and Robin visiting Superman on his birthday to discover the warlord Mongul is trying to kill Kal-El with the parasitic plant. Meanwhile, Clark dreams of a world where he lives with a wife, children, and his parents on the still-surviving planet Krypton.

Though the original Black Mercy story is well known as a DC tear-jerker (one famously adapted for the animated series Justice League Unlimited), Trinity&#39;s experience with the Black Mercy is decidedly more lighthearted and optimistic. The back-up story has a largely comedic tone, as Jon and Damian fight over the best ways to free Lizzie (using Robin&#39;s pessimism to their advantage becomes their best solution). Meanwhile, Trinity revels in beating up Jon and Damian, who she views as her big brothers, showing she is growing into a fearsome warrior equal to her mother. At the same time, the reveal that Lizzie truly wants to be like Jon and Damian is hopeful and heartwarming, unlike Superman&#39;s Black Mercy dream.






 DC&#39;s Newest Trinity Is a Fun Departure from Their Parents 
          

The new Black Mercy story, like the &#34;World&#39;s Finest&#34; back-up in Wonder Woman #3 and Lizzie&#39;s debut in Wonder Woman #800, further establishes Diana&#39;s daughter as the third member of a new DC trinity (herself, Jon&#39;s Superman, and Damian&#39;s Batman/Robin). In the new story, King continues to set the new trio apart in fun ways. Damian and Jon are the bickering Super Sons they long have been, while Lizzie, with enough will power to remove the Black Mercy herself, shows she both admires her brothers and wants to be better than them. Unlike Trinity&#39;s mother Wonder Woman and her teammates, this trinity grew up together — for better or worse.

Wonder Woman #4 is available now from DC Comics.
