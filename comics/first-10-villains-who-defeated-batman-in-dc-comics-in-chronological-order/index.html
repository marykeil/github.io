  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Batman&rsquo;s earliest major losses helped shape him into the character he is today, in addition to contributing to the shift in superhero narratives, as heroes now more frequently face sustained adversity.   Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul, Bronze Tiger, and the Reaper were among the earliest villains to defeat Batman, teaching him valuable lessons and pushing him to his limits.   Bane&rsquo;s defeat of Batman during the &ldquo;Knightfall&rdquo; story arc is considered his most decisive defeat, as Bane outsmarted and brutally beat Batman in a fight that changed the Dark Knight forever.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Batman is one of the best fighters in the DC Universe, but even the World&rsquo;s Greatest Detective has taken a few Ls in his long, history career.</p>
<p>Batman&rsquo;s earliest adventures saw him rarely on the losing side of a fight – but then again, the same could be said about most superheroes during the early days of the comic book industry. The earliest comic stories rarely saw the hero with their back against the wall, at least for too long. Golden Age era comics sought to satisfy their readers by giving them a positive, definitive ending, with the hero proving triumphant over their nefarious opponents. Batman&rsquo;s earliest major losses, in fights against his enemies, stand out as exceptions to the rule, which eventually to the current era of stories, where heroes more frequently face sustained adversity.</p>
<p>Heroes still tend to vanquish the opposition in the end, thought it isn&rsquo;t as easy a process as it used to be in the past. To see the villain be the one to come out on top is a relatively recent development to see in the last few decades. As such, despite being created in 1939, Batman didn&rsquo;t really start taking significant losses from his rivals until closer to the 1970s. He&rsquo;s taken several major losses in more recent years, even losing his fortunes and billionaire status, but his earliest losses are the ones that were substantial in shaping The Dark Knight into the character he is today.</p>
<p>Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul
The Master Embarrasses His Student</p>
<p>Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul is a big reason why Batman is such a skilled fighter. As such, the master was at one point compelled to humble his student, and remind him of where he came from. The Dark Knight was so outmatched by the Demon&rsquo;s Head that Talia Al Ghul begs Batman to run away as &ldquo;no mortal man can stop my father.&rdquo; Batman learns this hard way, admitting that he&rsquo;d never hit anyone harder than he hit Ra&rsquo;s that day &hellip; and it proved to no avail. He&rsquo;d return for a rematch with Ra&rsquo;s later, which resulted in Ra&rsquo;s once again leaving Batman for dead, this time in the middle of the desert.</p>
<p>Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul beat the Caped Crusader in Batman #244 by Dennis O&rsquo;Neil, Elliot S. Maggin, Neal Adams, Irv Novick, and Dick Giordano.</p>
<pre><code>              Ra's al Ghul Is About To Prove He's Batman's True Nemesis   Another notorious villain, the immortal Ra's al Ghul, will be getting a Batman: One Bad Day one-shot written by Tom Taylor with artwork by Ivan Reis.   
</code></pre>
<p>Bronze Tiger
Batman&rsquo;s Most Egregious Defeat</p>
<p>Bronze Tiger defeated Batman in Detective Comics #485 – written by Dennuis O&rsquo;Neil, with art by Don Newton.</p>
<p>Ra&rsquo;s al Ghul plays a large part in one of the worst times of Batman&rsquo;s career, orchestrating his second major defeat, after handing him his first. Ever the puppet master, Ra&rsquo;s Al Ghul manipulated the Sensei and his apprentice, Bronze Tiger, into getting a conflict with Batman. Ra&rsquo;s lied to Sensei, claiming the original Batwoman, Kathy Kane, was a threat to him. This compels Bronze Tiger to incapacitate Batman – incredibly, all it took was one kick – allowing Sensei to leave with Kathy Kane, who was ultimately killed. Bronze Tiger leaving Batman too weak to save Kathy set the death of the first Batwoman in motion.</p>
<p>The Reaper
Batman&rsquo;s Year Two Gave Bruce His Biggest Challenge Yet</p>
<p>Twenty years after first beginning his killing spree as a nightmarish vigilante, the now-elderly socialite Judson Capsian resurfaces as The Reaper during Batman&rsquo;s second year as a crimefighter protecting Gotham. Equipped with a scythe for a hand, and still as spry as he was decades prior, the Reaper managed to mangle Batman almost to death. The encounter was so traumatic for Bruce that he decided the only way to combat a killer of the Reaper&rsquo;s magnitude was to reluctantly join forces with Joe Chill, the man who killed his parents. That goes to show just how much of a threat Batman considered the Reaper to be.</p>
<p>The Reaper first appeared in Detective Comics #575 by Mike W. Barr, Alan Davis, and Paul Neary. If the Reaper&rsquo;s backstory and design seem amiliar, that&rsquo;s because the Reaper heavily influenced the title antagonist of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm.</p>
<p>Deacon Blackfire
Batman Succumbs To Brainwashing</p>
<p>Many villains on this list beat Batman in physical altercations, but Deacon Blackfire is one of the few to break Batman mentally. In Batman: The Cult, the Dark Knight sunk to his lowest depths, as the result of an encounter with Deacon Blackfire. This deacon was a self-proclaimed 100-year-old preacher, determined to force his legion of homeless followers into seeing the light his way. After capturing Batman and holding him prisoner for a long time, Batman found himself brainwashed into becoming a member of the cult. Even when he was freed, Bruce struggled to recover from the mental hold Blackfire had on him.</p>
<p>Batman: The Cult was a four-part miniseries from Jim Starlin and Bernie Wrightson.</p>
<p>Deathstroke
DC&rsquo;s Terminator Leaves Batman Down For The Count</p>
<p>Deathstroke the Terminator #7 – by Marv Wolfman, Steve Erwin – featured Batman&rsquo;s defeat at the mercenary&rsquo;s hands, in the second part of the &ldquo;City of Assassins&rdquo; storyline.</p>
<p>Batman is considered one of the best fighters in the DC Universe – despite debatably only being the third best fighter in his own family – but Deathstroke cemented himself as being an even better fighter during one of their early altercations. When a federal witness for the FBI became a target for Deathstroke, Batman was forced to take on the role of the informant&rsquo;s protector, leading to a fight between the Caped Crusader and Slade Wilson that raged all across Gotham City. By the end of their brawl, only Deathstroke was able to walk away, leaving Batman down and out on the ground.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Bane
By Far Batman&rsquo;s Most Famous Defeat</p>
<p>Bane broke the Bat in one of DC Comics most iconic moments, which occured in Batman #497 by Doug Moench, Jim Aparo, and Dick Giordano.</p>
<p>When most readers think of devastating defeats suffered by Batman, his loss at the hands of Bane during the &ldquo;Knightfall&rdquo; story arc ranks among the most memorable. In fact, out of any other loss on his record, this might be Batman&rsquo;s most decisive defeat. Exhausted after several nights of wrangling escaped Arkham Asylum – stemming from a mass breakout orchestrated by Bane – Batman returns to Wayne Manor to find the villain waiting for him. Not only does Bane outsmart Batman, but outclasses him in a fight. Truly, it was not even much of a fight, as Bane utterly brutalized Batman in ways never before seen up until that point, or since.</p>
<pre><code>              20 Bane Quotes That Would Strike Fear Even in Batman   A deadly combo of brains and brawn, Batman villain Bane is just as good when striking fear or striking a foe. These 20 quotes are his best.   
</code></pre>
<p>Clayface
A Power Upgrade Gave Clayface An Unexpected Advantage</p>
<p>As formidable of an adversary as the villain known as Clayface can be, he usually isn&rsquo;t ranked among Batman&rsquo;s tougher opponents, since Batman always has a ready-made plan for him. The one time that Batman did not have a plan in place for combating Clayface came at a point when the villain had gained new electric powers, during the &ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land&rdquo; storyline. Emerging from the ground when Batman least expects, having just apprehended Mr. Freeze, Clayface, cleanly took Batman out, leaving him a bloody mess. Karlo would likely have finished the job, if he hadn&rsquo;t gotten caught up bickering with Freeze over who should kill Batman.</p>
<p>Clayface got the best of Batman in Shadow of the Bat #75 –by Alan Grant, Mark Buckingham.</p>
<p>Prometheus
The JLA Almost Didn&rsquo;t Recover From This One</p>
<p>When Prometheus was first introduced as an adversary to the Justice League in the late 90s, he made his presence known not only by beating Batman, but by nearly dismantling the entire League. Best described as Batman&rsquo;s dark opposite, Prometheus&rsquo; name was never revealed, beyond being the son of two hippie spree killers. Equipped with mercenary training as an adult, Prometheus developed a killer instinct that made him a formidable opponent. In JLA #17 –by Grant Morrison, Arnie Jorgensen, Mark Pennington, and David Melkis – Prometheus infiltrated the Watchtower while it was on the moon. If not for the heroics of a disguised Catwoman, Prometheus would have done far more damage than he did, after taking out several JLA members, including Batman.</p>
<p>1998&rsquo;s JLA #16 saw the character take on a prominent antagonistic role following his reintroduction in New Year&rsquo;s Evil: Prometheus, from earlier that year.</p>
<p>Red Hood
When The Student Surpassed The Master</p>
<p>Over time, Jason Todd has progressed into more of an anti-hero capacity in his ongoing role in DC Comics, but when Red Hood first emerged in DC lore, he was a full-blown antagonist to Batman. The former Robin was hellbent on vengeance after his post-death resurgence. The &ldquo;Under the Hood&rdquo; arc overall is arguably best remembered for the climax, in which Jason gave Bruce the ultimatum: either kill the Joker or kill him. However, to get to that pivotal moment, Jason had to win a fight against Batman. The Caped Crusader nearly beat Jason, but a gun proved to be the X-factor Bruce wasn&rsquo;t expecting.</p>
<p>Batman and Red Hood had a knock-down-drag-out brawl in Batman #650 by Judd Winick, Eric Battle, Rodney Ramos.</p>
<pre><code>              Red Hood’s Superman-Like Sacrifice Proves Batman Was Wrong About Jason Todd   Batman may think otherwise, but Red Hood summons all his courage to overcome the most terrifying moment of his life and proves he’s a hero.   
</code></pre>
<p>Darkseid
Even In Defeat, Darkseid Gets the Last Laugh Vs. Batman</p>
<p>The Final Crisis storyline is one that concludes with no winners at the end of it all. The arc itself uncharacteristically positions the supervillain as a victor for much of the story. Things grew so dire that Batman broke his code, concluding that Darkseid was a problem that needed a permanent solution, via a Radion bullet. Batman gets the shot off, opening the door for Darkseid&rsquo;s defeat, but first Darkseid fired his own Omega Beams at Batman. Presumed dead, Bruce was really sent back in time. The Beams turned Bruce into a sort of temporal bomb, closer to detonating the closer he got to the present, giving Darkseid the last laugh.</p>
<p>Lady Shiva
Leaves a Violent First Impression Meeting Batman</p>
<p>Lady Shiva defeated Batman in Nightwing #0 by Tom DeFalco, Kyle Higgins, Eddy Barrows, and Eber Ferreira.</p>
<p>At a time when Batman was investigating a missing local politican, he wound up in the direct path of Lady Shiva. When the Caped Crusader least expected it, a shuriken pierced his chest, before the emerging assassin mercilessly beat him down. The violent altercation got so bad that Dick Grayson entered the battlefield, wearing his Robin suit for the first time in DC&rsquo;s chronology. Naturally, he was not experienced enough to stop her, but Shiva expressed that she far more impressed with the new protégé than she was with Batman, and ultimately, Dick&rsquo;s action led to Batman surviving the encounter.</p>
