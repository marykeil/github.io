## Literature Review

Doomsday is one of Superman&#39;s most terrifying enemies; over the years, DC has introduced many versions of the villain, all of them highly dangerous.




Doomsday is one of the most terrifying antagonists in the entire DC Universe, being literally one of the few characters to install fear in Superman, even outright beating him to death. Naturally, the idea of one Doomsday is bad enough, but with things like the Multiverse, there are plenty of Doomsdays to go around, each more terrifying than the last.
Superman has fought dozens of absurdly powerful characters over the years; literal gods like Darkseid, and brilliant minds like Lex Luthor. But none of these have pushed him to the absolute brink of death like Doomsday did. Doomsday was something Superman had never seen before, he was a monster that couldn&#39;t be reasoned with on an empathetic level, and seemingly couldn&#39;t be stopped on a physical one. This meant Superman had no choice but to give absolutely everything in the attempt to stop this monster. All the versions of Doomsday that have popped up since have been just as dangerous and some of them have been even more dangerous.









 








 10  Doomsday 


 







The original Doomsday first appeared in Superman: The Man of Steel #17 by Louise Simonson, Jon Bogdanove, Dennis Janke, Glenn Whitmore, and Bill Oakley. 

Doomsday got his name from the fact his appearance seemed to herald the end of the world. He wrought destruction all across America as he marched towards Metropolis, defeating every single member of the Justice League as he went. Eventually, Doomsdays rampage ended with a final fight with Superman which, after hours and hours of a brutal battle between the two characters, Doomsday eventually killed Superman. While Doomsday himself was defeated, plenty of new versions of him would appear over the years. And despite this incredible reputation, the original Doomsday isn&#39;t the most dangerous version Superman has ever come up against.





 9  Jimmy Olsen Doomsday 
        

While it might be surprising to think, the Jimmy Olsen version of Doomsday proved he was stronger than the original Doomsday in one major way. After Superman was infected with black kryptonite and started to turn evil, it was up to Jimmy Olsen to stop him. Jimmy managed this by injecting himself with a serum that transformed him into Doomsday, albeit with his intelligence still intact. Jimmy then proceeded to knock Clark out pretty quickly. When the original Doomsday fought Superman, it took hours to bring Superman down, but Jimmy did it with just a few blows. Despite Jimmy&#39;s reputation as a geeky sidekick, he proved himself more capable than the original Doomsday.
Jimmy Olsen as Doomsday was first seen in All-Star Superman #4 by Grant Morrison, Frank Quitely, Jamie Grant, and Phil Balsman. 






 8  Alfred Pennyworth Doomsday 

        

There are many different universes in the DC Multiverse, and not everyone is always a hero like they are in the main universe. For example, there are a few universes where Alfred Pennyworth is willing to commit murder. In one such universe, Martha Wayne is an evil controlling woman, and Alfred serves her as her right hand and muscle. Alfred primarily uses venom to increase his physical prowess. However, after Superman defeats this evil Alfred, he decides to up his game by using a Doomsday serum to transform into a Doomsday variant. Considering he was strong enough to take a punch from Superman just on venom, transforming into Doomsday would surely make him far more powerful.
The Alfred Pennyworth incarnation of Doomsday appeared in Batman/Superman Annual #2 by Gene Luen Yang, Paul Pelletier, Mick Gray, Hi-Fi Design, and Troy Peteri. 






 7  Doomzarro 
        

Bizzaros are some of the stranger beings in the DC Universe, coming from a multitude of areas. Bizzaro World is a cubed planet that revolves around a blue sun, which Bizzaro lives on. Due to the blue sun increasing his powers, Bizarro created other Bizzaros to live with him, which included Bizzaro Doomsday. This was ultimately a mistake, as Bizzaro Doomsday went berserk and began slaughtering everyone, including Bizzaro Superman, despite his blue sun power-up. The strangest thing about Doomzarro was that, despite being a bizarro version of Doomsday, he functioned exactly the same. This seemingly proved that Doomsday&#39;s hatred of life is so intense that an inversion of it is still a murderous monster.
This truly bizarre Doomsday variant was first seen in Action Comics #856 by Geoff Johns, Richard Donner, Eric Powell, Dave Stewart, and Rob Leigh. 






 6  Doomslayer 

        


Doomslayer first appeared in Action Comics #901 by Paul Cornell, Jesus Merino, Kenneth Rocafort, Brad Anderson, and Rob Leigh. 

One of the saving graces of fighting Doomsday has always been the fact that Doomsday is little more than an animal. He has no real sense of intelligence, just acting purely on animal instinct to destroy any and all life he comes across. This all changed with the introduction of Doomslayer, a clone of Doomsday made by Lex Luthor. The Doomslayer clone was highly intelligent though, perfectly capable of speech and complex planning, as well as the use of technology. The Doomslayer was so dangerous that Doomsday joined the Justice League to stop him. This historic team-up led to Doomslayer&#39;s eventual defeat, and he hasn&#39;t been seen since.





 5  Doomstroke 


 







Doomstroke was introduced in Superman/Batman by Michael Green, Mike Johnson, Francis Manapul, Brian Buccellato, and Rob Leigh. 

One of the most dangerous men in the DC Universe is Deathstroke, who often goes up against the Titans or the Justice League and has even managed to defeat both on separate occasions. Deathstroke is one of the greatest mercenaries with a pretty enhanced healing factor and combat skills to match Batman. When Deathstroke was combined with Doomsday, it created a villain so absurdly dangerous, that even Superman admitted they had no time to plan, that they simply had to attack. Doomstroke was so dangerous that neither Superman never actually defeated him, instead having to rely on destroying the reality Dr. Destiny had created.





 4  Brainiac Doomsday 
        

Doomsday is Superman&#39;s most physically imposing enemy, and Brainiac is without a doubt his most intelligent. This led to a terrifying combination when Brainiac possessed Doomsday&#39;s body. With his new intelligence, Doomsday was able to easily destroy the entire Justice League, and Superman wasn&#39;t able to help. He even forced Superman to primarily avoid confrontation with him. Superman only defeated Brainiac Doomsday by managing to separate the two beings. While fighting them together, Clark was completely outmatched, and had absolutely no hope of winning. This trend continues to show that the most dangerous Doomsday&#39;s are, in fact, the ones that are actually intelligent.
Brainiac Doomsday appeared in the Superman: The Doomsday Wars miniseries by Dan Jurgens, Norm Rapmund, Gregory Wright, and John Workman 






 3  Doombreaker 


 







The Doombreaker was version of Doomsday born out of a mutated construction worker by the name of Lloyd Crayton. Lloyd witnessed Superman&#39;s battle with Doomsday in person. After Doomsday was killed, Lloyd took some of Doomsday&#39;s broken bones home with him. Over time, the bone exuded a gas that transformed Lloyd into the Doombreaker. Doombreaker is one of the most dangerous versions of Doomsday ever depicted. He seemed to mutate far more rapidly than the original, as he was able to do things such sprouting wings, and even growing multiple arms. Perhaps the most dangerous part of Doombreaker was the implication that anyone can be turned into a Doomsday by exposure to the original.
Doombreaker was first seen in The Death of Superman: 30th Anniversary Special by Dan Jurgens, Brett Breeding, Brad Anderson, and John Workman. 






 2  The Devastator 
        

Batman&#39;s Doomsday form was first seen in Batman: The Devastator #1 by Frank Tieri, James Tynion IV, Tony S. Daniel, Danny Miki, Tomeu Morey, and Tom Napolitano. 

Batman has plenty of plans to take down Superman, in case the Man of Steel ever goes rogue, but the darkest anti-Superman plan Batman has is using Doomsday serum. Batman is already one of the most dangerous men on the planet, but with Doomsday&#39;s strength, he became an entirely new level of danger. Batman&#39;s version of Doomsday had Kryptonite breath and was shown as capable of easily killing Superman in several seconds. This version of Batman would later go on to join the Dark Knights and threaten the entire universe. This version of Doomsday was eventually brought down by Superman in full Element-X armor.





 1  Superdoom 
        

There are few characters with as much power as Superman, which is why Superman having Doomsday&#39;s powers on top of that, was truly the most powerful a Doomsday variant has ever been. In this story, after killing Doomsday, Superman was infected with a virus that slowly transformed him into the next Doomsday. Clark&#39;s rage began to go out of control, and he even exiled himself from Earth to avoid hurting anyone. Eventually, Clark was cured by the powers of Brainiac. Still, for a brief moment, the DC Universe collectively trembled, as Superman became the most powerful Doomsday variant to ever live.
Superdoom first appeared as part of the Superman: Doomed storyline by Charles Soule, Greg Pak, Scott Lobdell, Ken Lashley, Sunny Gho, and Carlos M. Mangual.
