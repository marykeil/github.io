Summary

  Darkwing Duck&#39;s hero team, the Justice Ducks, will be getting their own spin-off comic series in 2024.   The Justice Ducks have had rare appearances, making this series highly anticipated for Disney fans.   The team will be facing a new threat from a team of aliens.  







Darkwing Duck&#39;s hero team is reuniting with Dynamite Comics&#39; upcoming series, Justice Ducks. After the return of the team in Darkwing Duck #10, they will combine forces in their own spin-off comic. The caped hero may not love his teammates and the way they steal his spotlight, but he&#39;ll be needing all the help he can get.

Darkwing Duck #10 saw the titular Disney Afternoon hero teaming up with his friends, bringing together the Justice Ducks once more. Now, the heroic team will be getting its own group comic book series to kick off 2024. This will be the first time the Justice Ducks star in their own dedicated comic. Previously, they debuted in the Darkwing Duck animated series and have only had rare occurrences in the comics focused on and named after Darkwing himself.

 Justice Ducks #1 (2024)                 Release Date:  January 24, 2024    Writers:  Rodger Langridge    Artists:  Carlo Cid Lauro    Cover Artist:  Mirka Andolfo    Variant Covers:  Ricardo Tomaselli, Roger Langridge, Trish Forstner   In this thrilling maiden issue: Flying saucers descend from the skies, to (maybe) wreak (possible) havoc upon the (mostly) innocent citizens of St. Canard! All that&#39;s stopping these aggressive alien agitators is STEGMUTT, GIZMODUCK, NEPTUNIA, MORGANA, and (most important, in his opinion) DARKWING DUCK! Written by the Eisner and Harvey Award-winning ROGER LANGRIDGE and illustrated by celebrated Darkwing Duck artist CARLO LAURO, this latest chapter in the ongoing saga of St. Canard&#39;s web-footed wonders is surely destined for greatness - just like DD himself!   






Previously, the team debuted in the Darkwing Duck animated series and have only had rare occurrences in the comics focused on and named after Darkwing himself. This makes it a very exciting series for Disney fans to keep an eye out for. AIPT Comics shared a preview of the upcoming debut issue, providing a look at the foe the Justice Ducks will be facing.


 Dynamite Comics Delivers First Ever Justice Ducks Comic Series 
         

The preview above shows a monster strolling through St. Canard, resulting in Stegmutt calling his fellow Justice Ducks members for help. This new foe appears to be part of a new team of aliens who could pose a major threat to the Disney superhero team. Contrarily, they could just be hunting for something specific and their unorthodox method will cause more trouble than they originally intended. Either way, the Justice Ducks will likely also be facing their usual nemesis simultaneously: Darkwing Duck&#39;s ego. This preview already highlights the annoyance the hero is feeling towards Neptunia for her taking the lead on this adventure.




The Justice Ducks have a wide range of skills at their disposal, but they rarely get to come together thanks to Darkwing&#39;s love of the spotlight. His willingness to work with them in Darkwing Duck #10 could have been a one-off he isn&#39;t willing to repeat very often. By the end of this series, he could be the cause of the team drifting apart once again - or he could learn to work with them as a team for an extended period of time. Neptunia and Gizmoduck usually irk Darkwing the most, as he gets along well with Morgana and Stegmutt, but it&#39;d be interesting to see all their egos be set aside for the sake of St. Canard.



 Disney Comic Offerings Continue to Expand Under Dynamite Comics 
          

Dynamite Comics has been publishing several new Disney comics, resulting in a wide variety of options during the entertainment giant&#39;s 100th anniversary. This has included the Darkwing Duck series that spawned this one, the Negaduck spin-off, and several Disney Villain titles with new, original stories. Justice Ducks #1 will be the latest, releasing in the same month as the publisher&#39;s upcoming series, Lilo &amp; Stitch. Dynamite has also been publishing two Gargoyles titles, rounding out its Disney Afternoon offerings with spin-offs like Gargoyles: Dark Ages and the Gargoyles Halloween Special. The Justice Ducks rarely get the spotlight, making the newest Disney hero offering one that should be highly anticipated.




Justice Ducks #1 releases January 24, 2024 from Dynamite Comics.
