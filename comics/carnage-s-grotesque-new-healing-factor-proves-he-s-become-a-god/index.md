## Literature Review

Carnage has done a lot of disturbing stuff over the years, but his newest feat not only proves how gross he is, but also the fact he is a god.




Warning! Contains spoilers For Carnage #1!Carnage was already the most brutal serial killer in Marvel Comics, but he just proved without a doubt that he&#39;s also a god with his grossest healing factor to date. Carnage has many impressive feats under his belt, but what he&#39;s done recently leaves no doubt that he&#39;s one of the strongest and hardest-to-kill villains in comics. Cletus Kasady has always been the perfect host to the Carnage symbiote, so when the symbiote finds itself without Cletus, it simply remakes him.




The absurd lengths that Carnage&#39;s healing factor can go to are revealed in 2023&#39;s Carnage #1 by Torunn Gronbekk, Pere Perez, Erick Arciniega, and Joe Sabino. When the Carnage symbiote is returned to Earth by a foe, it finds itself back in prison. It longs to reunite with Cletus Kasady. But considering Kasady is dead, the symbiote simply consumes the flesh of a nearby prisoner.



          

As Carnage says, the prisoner is just &#34;raw materials&#34; and can be &#34;re-formed.&#34; This is proven when Carnage consumes the prisoner and then vomits out a brand-new version of Cletus Kasady. This Cletus has all the memories of the old one due to the symbiote&#39;s influence, and he quickly adjusts to being alive again.

 Carnage Regenerates Cletus In The Most Absurd Way 


          

The Carnage symbiote has several absurd feats, like allowing Cletus to fly, something the Venom symbiote needed to connect to a Hive to learn to do. Carnage has even survived the vacuum of space while fatally wounded, for months. Cletus&#39; codex has haunted Eddie Brock from beyond the grave and now the Carnage symbiote has outright regenerated Cletus from practically nothing. While Cletus has always been difficult to kill, this latest feat proves that he&#39;s borderline immortal.

Carnage has been getting stronger and stronger in comics lately as he&#39;s journeyed across the multiverse killing various versions of Venom. Recently, Carnage even defeated the King in Black in one universe. Carnage has just kept getting stronger since that moment, with each new feat he pulls off being more absurd than the last. He&#39;s shown himself to be capable of infecting other people with his symbiote and was even capable of taking on the Hulk and winning with relative ease. This latest feat of regeneration proves that he&#39;s practically immortal. Unless someone is able to destroy the Carnage symbiote entirely, Cletus Kasady will never truly be gone.






 Carnage Proves Himself To Be A God Among Symbiotes 


          

There are tons of dangerous characters in the Marvel Universe and, in extreme situations, the heroes that face them have resorted to lethal force. While Carnage has been killed several times by various heroes in the Marvel Universe, it seems that he&#39;ll never truly be gone. As long as the Carnage symbiote itself exists, Cletus Kasady will always be able to regenerate from death. This absurd and gross feat proves that Carnage really has reached god status.
