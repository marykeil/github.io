# Sonic Almost Sacrificing a Chaos Emerald Shows How He s Grown as a Hero


## SUMMARY 



  Sonic&#39;s recent actions show that he is more considerate of others and willing to act on their behalf, even if it goes against his own goals.   In contrast to Sonic&#39;s growth, Tails is shown to prioritize science over respecting the privacy of others, highlighting Sonic&#39;s heroic nature even more.   Other characters, like Tangle and Rouge, prioritize obtaining a Chaos Emerald over anything else, making Sonic&#39;s ability to give up the Emerald even more impressive.

## Literature Review

What Sonic the Hedgehog does in the latest issue of IDW Publishing&#39;s series would have never happened in the earliest issues of the comic.




Warning: Spoilers for Sonic the Hedgehog #68A recent incident where Sonic the Hedgehog actually puts the fate of a Chaos Emerald in the hands of a neutral third-party reveals just how much more of a hero the blue hedgehog has become since the start of his current comic book series by IDW Publishing. Sonic also makes other surprisingly heroic decisions during the same mission that he most likely never would have done earlier in the story. Sonic&#39;s actions are even more impressive when compared to the choices of his many friends - including Tails.




After an extreme gear malfunction sends them tumbling into the home of an overprotective giant salamander, Sonic and Tails find a Chaos Emerald nearby. However, it is Sonic who asks the salamander if it would be okay if he took it, in Sonic the Hedgehog #68 by writer and artist Evan Stanley, colorist Josh Burcham and letterer Shawn Lee, with inks also by Stanley and Matt Froese.

          

Sonic later holes up the entrance to the salamander&#39;s home to protect its privacy, much to the dismay of a distraught Tails, who wants easy access to this unique ecosystem for future discoveries.


 Sonic&#39;s Heroic Act Shows What He Values Even More Than Chaos Emeralds 
          




These instances clearly show that Sonic is cognizant of how others feel and that he&#39;s fully capable of acting on their behalf, even if it comes at the detriment to his own goals. This case is especially impressive when considering the fact that he has just met the salamander, and it also initially attacks him and Tails for invading its home. Sonic may have once empathized with Whisper the Wolf when she first met Sonic&#39;s friends and felt overwhelmed by their attentiveness in an earlier issue, but it was only because he could relate to her. He, too, understood the need to be alone.

The only downside to Sonic&#39;s growth in issue #68 is that it comes at the expense of Tails, who&#39;s shown to be more concerned about science than respecting the privacy of an innocent bystander. Regardless, this event contrasts greatly with how Sonic was originally portrayed in IDW. He was initially a selfish character who was more concerned about being free than acting for the greater good. He constantly rejected his friends&#39; attempts to recruit him to the then-named Resistance to help them fight off the remainder of Dr. Eggman&#39;s army.






 Sonic&#39;s Allies Serve As A Stark Contrast To Him 
          

Another comparison that makes Sonic&#39;s already impressive actions look even more heroic is how other characters have prioritized their goal of obtaining a Chaos Emerald over others. This can be seen in the story &#34;Rough Patch&#34; by Aaron Hammerstrom and Valentina Pinto from the Sonic the Hedgehog Annual 2022. Sonic&#39;s companions Tangle and Rouge actually rob a local museum by stealing a Chaos Emerald being showcased there. While it&#39;s not shocking for Rouge to steal, Tangle is a heroic and not a morally conflicted character. The comparison is even more relevant when considering how similar Sonic and Tangle are. During a mission led by the new attack squad the Diamond Cutters, both Sonic and Tangle rush headlong into the fray without considering how their actions could jeopardize the group&#39;s efforts. This effectively positions the two characters as like-minded individuals who don&#39;t think before they act. However, the fact that Sonic has now been able to give up a Chaos Emerald when someone so similar to him hasn&#39;t just underscores how much he&#39;s grown even more.




Regardless, it&#39;s rather appropriate that Sonic&#39;s stunning transformation is showcased in this particular issue, seeing as it marks the beginning of the main continuity&#39;s short hiatus, while the potentially lore-shattering Fang: The Hunter miniseries fills the void. It&#39;s the perfect time to sit back and reflect on how much Sonic the Hedgehog has truly grown as a hero.



Sonic the Hedgehog #68 is available from IDW Publishing
