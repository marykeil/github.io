## Literature Review

The signature pet (and weapon) of Power Rangers S.P.D. gets an update that nearly takes down the most dastardly villain of the comic series.




R.I.C. from Power Rangers S.P.D. has received an upgrade that makes him powerful enough to take down the franchise&#39;s most dangerous villain. Abbreviated to Robotic Interactive Canine, R.I.C. was the Rangers&#39; multi-use pet robot. Initially defective, he was upgraded to R.I.C. 2.0, allowing him to be used as a weapon for the Rangers in battle. He was first utilized as the team&#39;s Canine Cannon, then as the Red Ranger&#39;s Battlizer.




The multi-purpose dog gets one more upgrade that helps ward off Lord Drakkon and his forces in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Annual 2018 #1. The story &#34;Power Rangers: SPD&#34; by Caleb Goellner, Patrick Mulholland, Raul Angulo, and Ed Dukeshire, shows R.I.C. boasting a bigger, almost wolf-like appearance. It truly comes in handy as R.I.C. 3.0 destroys half of Drakkon&#39;s army before almost eating Drakkon himself alive.

          

This new upgrade for R.I.C. doesn&#39;t just tell readers about the future of R.I.C. and the S.P.D. unit, but the future of tech operations in the Power Rangers franchise as a whole.


 RIC 3.0 Saves the Power Rangers &amp; Almost Kills Lord Drakkon 
          




In the midst of the &#34;Shattered Grid&#34; story arc, an evil version of Tommy Oliver from an alternate timeline travels the multiverse to kill Rangers and collect their Morphers, all in an effort to supplement his ever-growing power from the Morphin Grid. His latest attempt takes him and his army to the year 2025, where the potentially immortal S.P.D. Commander Anubis &#34;Doggie&#34; Cruger is leading a training session between his usual B-Squad and the C-Squad. When Lord Drakkon attacks and his forces become too great to ward off, the Rangers explore their options to combat this unexpected terror. That&#39;s when resident tech guru Boom has an idea.

He explains that a new upgrade to R.I.C. might be helpful right now. Using the C-Squad&#39;s help to open its door, the B-Squad unleashes R.I.C. 3.0 (or R.I.C. 3-Point-Omega) onto Drakkon&#39;s operations. R.I.C. is now the size of a Zord as it tears Drakkon&#39;s army to shreds using its laser eye beams. Under Boom&#39;s orders, it&#39;s time for R.I.C. to &#34;fetch the bonehead in charge.&#34; To avoid being devoured by a giant robot dog, Lord Drakkon admits defeat and that he might&#39;ve underestimated this era&#39;s Rangers before teleporting himself and whatever&#39;s left of his army out of this time.






 The Future of Power Rangers Weaponry is Bright 
          

The foundation of Power Rangers franchise was often rooted in the team receiving Zords and weapons that existed eons ago. In the Mighty Morphin days, whenever the Rangers wanted more up-to-date technology, as opposed to the ancient works provided by Zordon, they had to make it themselves, like Billy creating the communicators. The actual ancient weaponry from Zordon, meanwhile, can&#39;t be updated as easily as something more modern would. As Power Rangers S.P.D. makes clear, the future of Ranger weaponry is far more advanced, allowing for their technologies like R.I.C. to constantly be updated and improved upon over time, rather than being stuck with the usual ancient weaponry.
