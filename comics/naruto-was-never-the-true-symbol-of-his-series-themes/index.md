# Naruto Was Never The True Symbol of His Series  Themes


## SUMMARY 



  Rock Lee, despite not having the ability to use ninjutsu and genjutsu like other shinobi, overcame all obstacles to become an amazing ninja through taijutsu.   Rock Lee&#39;s success is due to his incredible willpower and refusal to give up on his dreams, even with a significant disadvantage.   Compared to Naruto, who had advantages like the Uzumaki clan&#39;s chakra and the power of a jinchuriki, Rock Lee&#39;s journey to become a shinobi was much more difficult and exemplifies the themes of the series.

## Literature Review

One of the main themes in Naruto is that hardships can be overcome through effort and determination, and one ninja represents this better than Naruto.




One of the main themes in Naruto is that through hard work and determination, even the greatest hardships can be overcome, but there is one shinobi that represents this better than the protagonist himself. In a community full of exceptional shinobi, Rock Lee stands out as Konoha&#39;s most amazing. When considered alongside the abilities of Naruto and Sasuke, Lee&#39;s resume may look underwhelming. However, he is actually a talented ninja whose path to greatness was harder than anyone else&#39;s.




Despite the amazing amount of diversity in power and abilities, almost all the shinobi in the Naruto universe share one common bond: they all have the ability to use ninjutsu and genjutsu. Both practices use chakra - the supernatural force passed to humans thousands of years ago by Kaguya Otsutsuki through her sons Hagoromo and Hamura. Ninjutsu and genjutsu are specialized applications of chakra that eventually became the primary ways Naruto shinobi have been able to accomplish their extraordinary feats of legend.

          

There is only one shinobi in Konoha, however, who cannot use these extraordinary abilities: Rock Lee. Despite that, and thanks to the guidance of his master Might Guy, Lee managed to overcome all the obstacles in his path.


 Rock Lee, Not Naruto, Best Embodies The Saga&#39;s Themes 
          




Rock Lee has chakra like everyone else, but unlike other shinobi, he lacks the ability to access and &#34;harness&#34; it into ninjutsu and genjutsu. Despite these barriers to becoming a shinobi, Rock nevertheless continued to pursue his dream of becoming one through taijutsu - the one special physically-based, martial arts-oriented ninja skill that does not require the manipulation of chakra. It&#39;s a mindbogglingly difficult path that requires a grueling training regimen, and even with that, Lee has to rely on his fists to fight against people who can summon elements, teleport, and manipulate minds.

Outside the brutal physical training that Rock experienced, to successfully complete a shinobi, perhaps the most important element of his success is his willpower. Indeed, it takes a high level of mental toughness to refuse to give up on one&#39;s dreams after starting with such an incredible disadvantage. Naruto obviously became famous for never giving up on his seemingly impossible dream of going from shunned and feared orphan to Hokage, but considering the circumstances, this was much easier to obtain. After all, Naruto was blessed at birth with the Uzumaki clan&#39;s great chakra and stamina, was the son of a genius shinobi like the Fouth Hokage, and also had the power of a jinchuriki thanks to Kurama.




          

Lee, on the other hand, had none of these advantages. He is not even a genius at taijutsu like his master Guy, who was recognized even by Uchiha Madara. The only thing that Lee is a genius at is &#34;effort&#34;. His willpower drove him to take on the test to be a ninja, and succeed despite the odds being stacked against him. After that, he had to overcome even greater hardships after his battle with Gaara, and continued to evolve until he became a jonin in the sequel. Considering how disadvantaged his start was, Rock Lee proved to be not only one of Naruto&#39;s best shinobi, but the one who personifies the series&#39; themes in the best possible way.
