## Literature Review

The Autobots and Decepticons have gone to war once again in the new Energon Universe, but this time, the conflict has deadly consequences.




WARNING! Spoilers ahead for Transformers #3The Transformers are back and better than ever thanks to Skybound’s Energon Universe, but now, the clash between the Autobots and Decepticons has very real consequences. In the recently released Transformers #3, Optimus Prime and Skywarp have a throwdown of epic proportions, as the human characters of the story attempt to make sense of this centuries-long war they have no context for.




The cost of the Cybertronian War on Earth has already been high, as human teenager Carly learned her father was killed in Transformers #1. Transformers #3 by writer and artist Daniel Warren Johnson, colorist Mike Spicer and letterer Rus Wooten picks up where the previous issue left off, with Spike Witwicky’s dad Sparkplug tooling up with his VFW buddies to take on these new alien invaders.

          

Carly tries to explain that not all of the transforming robots are out to do them harm, but Sparkplug refuses to listen. As Autobots Cliffjumper and Optimus Prime attempt to stop Skywarp from rampaging through the town, Sparkplug and his buddies unload on all three, and that’s precisely when Spike arrives on the scene and winds up catching a ricochet in the crossfire.





 In The New Transformers, War Has A Very Human Cost 
          

Spike getting wounded is the perfect way to remind readers that the battles here in the Energon Universe aren’t without consequences. While the issues released thus far have featured massive smackdowns between the Autobots and Decepticons, writer/artist Daniel Warren Johnson is keen to give the action weight and meaning by showing the after-effects of battle. Under Johnson’s pen, the action is more than just robots smacking each other around, but rather consequential story events that have genuine stakes. The human perspective is crucial to this new era of Transformers continuity, and having Spike wounded by the bullets fired by his own dad and his allies is a powerful reminder of everything that’s at stake in the Energon Universe.

This is highlighted by Optimus Prime’s reaction to the wounded Spike, as the Autobot leader is reminded of the emotional moment from the previous issue where he accidentally killed a deer. It’s another reminder that Prime carries the weight of several worlds on his shoulders, as he not only is still dealing with his perceived failure of protecting his Autobots on Cybertron, but also now feels responsible for humanity, as well. After using his own damaged arm as a weapon to subdue Skywarp, Prime transforms back into his truck mode to speed the wounded Spike away and get help, offering a ride to a still skeptical Sparkplug on the way.






 Optimus Prime Feels Responsible for Humanity 


          

It’s another momentous issue filled with massive consequences going forward, as the stage is set for another epic confrontation in next month’s Transformers #4 as Optimus rushes to get Spike to safety. It will also be interesting to see where Sparkplug’s arc goes from here, as the war veteran will have to reckon with how his own trauma from war and the loss of his oldest son has led to Spike getting wounded. Whether he learns to fully trust the Autobots remains to be seen, but given the response to the Energon Universe thus far, fans won’t want to miss an issue of the new Transformers series to find out what happens next.
