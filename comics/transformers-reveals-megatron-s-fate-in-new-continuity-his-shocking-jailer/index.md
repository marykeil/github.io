## Literature Review

Fans finally learn where Megatron has been the last few centuries with the release of Cobra Commander #1, as the Decepticon leader makes his debut...




WARNING: spoilers ahead for Cobra Commander #1!Transformers fans finally got an answer to where Megatron has been with the release of the fourth issue of that series, as the Decepticon leader was revealed to be frozen somewhere in the arctic. Now, the Energon Universe is thickening the plot by showing what happened next in the pages of Cobra Commander #1, where it’s revealed that the future enemy of G.I. Joe has been keeping Megatron under lock and key.




Coming from the creative team of Joshua Williamson, Andrea Milana, Annalisa Leoni and Rus Wooten, Cobra Commander #1 deepens the lore of the Energon Universe with the introduction of the titular character, who is revealed to be developing weapons from Transformers tech.

Cobra Commander #1 reveals that the Commander hails from the hidden civilization of Cobra-La, and is a member of a species of serpent people who live deep in the arctic. The Commander is a scientist causing a stir with his new weaponry, which readers learn is the result of experiments upon his prisoner: Megatron.

It’s a pretty huge reveal, and further sets up the interconnected web that makes up the Energon Universe. Never before have the G.I. Joe and Transformers properties been so closely tied together right from the beginning. Cobra Commander using Megatron to develop new weaponry adds a further wrinkle to the Energon Universe, as fans already know that Energon is being used to create Cobra weaponry by his future rival/partner Destro. It’s exciting to see the pieces being set up on the game board, as the nascent Cobra organization is slowly being built from the ground up.




The fact that Megatron will be a part of Cobra Commander’s plan is an excellent bit of world-building detail, and it will be interesting to see how the story plays out from here, especially since the Cobra organization doesn&#39;t yet exist. A rampant fan theory before the release of the issue involved Cobra Commander actually wielding Megatron in the Decepticon leader’s alt-mode as a pistol, and that would certainly be a smart way to keep Megatron involved in the plot without handing him total control of Earth&#39;s small group of Decepticons too early.



In current Transformers canon, the Decepticons are being led by Starscream, with Megatron&#39;s full return seemingly being saved until later in the story.

Perhaps most tantalizing of all is the prospect of what happens when Megatron breaks free from Cobra Commander. The final grin the Decepticon leader gives before being locked away again shows that Megatron is very much aware of what is going on, and more than likely plotting his own schemes for the future now that Cobra Commander is being sent out into the wider world in search of more Energon. With the G.I. Joe and Transformers reboots being well-received both critically and commercially, it’s never been a better time to be a fan of both franchises - especially now that the franchise&#39;s biggest villains are &#39;working together&#39; in such an unexpected way.
