# Batman Only Scares Criminals Because Santa Claus Did It First (Yes, Really)


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s scare tactics were influenced by Santa Claus and Krampus, who used similar techniques to scare naughty children into behaving.   Santa Claus and Krampus have a centuries-old tag-team approach to rehabilitating bad children, which predates Batman&#39;s fear-based techniques.   The connection between Batman, Santa Claus, and Krampus shows that their tactics in fighting evil are universal and effective.

## Literature Review

Batman, Santa Claus, and Krampus are currently crossing over in DC Comics, with Batman learning he has far more in common with them than he thinks.




Spoilers for Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2!Batman has made his mark on Gotham City as a terrifying and brutal vigilante who scares the daylights out of criminals in ways that deter them from committing further crimes in the future. And now, it’s revealed that not only does The Caped Crusader have a previously unknown connection to Santa Claus and the frightening Christmas-time creature known as Krampus, but his specific scare tactics originate from the pair’s own naughty-negating ways!




In DC Comics, Santa Claus aka Kris — “a mighty woodsman, a crafter” — and Krampus — “a fierce beast-man” — are offshoots of Ancient Viking lore that tells tales of how Kris would use toy gifts to make up for Krampus teasing and terrorizing children for its own amusement.

          

A back-and-forth that eventually morphed into a well-rehearsed game where Krampus would scare naughty kids, and Kris would use presents to reward nice ones while teaching them all a few much-needed lessons, it’s here where Kris and Krampus’ tag-team rehabilitation plan matches up with Batman’s patented superhero shtick of scaring criminals straight.

                  &#34;I&#39;m More Than Batman&#34;: DC Declares the Best Batman Across Movies, Games &amp; Comics   Of all the Batman variants in the vast DC omniverse, one version of Bruce Wayne stands above the rest and reveals what makes him the best Dark Knight.   





 Batman, Santa Claus, and Krampus Use The Same Techniques Against Evil 
          

Taking a page out of Kris and Krampus’ playbook in Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2, by Jeff Parker, Michele Bandini, and Trevor Hairsine, this connection is made when Batman, Nightwing, and the rest of the Bat-Family witness a centuries-old memory of Krampus tormenting some village children. Striking fear into their hearts with pointed terror after they tease an undeserving little girl, Krampus is soon met by Kris, with the pair going on to play “bad cop, worse cop,” resulting in the naughty kids swearing to be good from that moment forward. Exclaiming that their methods work, Krampus and Kris are observed by Nightwing for bringing “order to chaos by scaring the wicked,” something that sounds right up Batman’s alley.




Well-known in the comic space for being an overly cruel superhero thanks to his ruthless crime-fighting techniques, Batman also uses his frightening persona to terrify and scare his foes straight in the hopes of them realizing their wicked ways and subsequently turning over a new leaf because of the experience. Similarly, Kris and Krampus teaming up to help redeem bad children with a fine-tuned performance of punishment under threat of terror is a routine that predates Batman’s fear-based techniques by centuries and goes to show that no matter when these tactics are used, they’re still wildly effective enough for Batman and Santa Claus/Krampus to use consistently.



 Batman Scares People Straight Just Like Santa and Krampus 
          

So while it’s crazy to think that Batman has any overlapping similarities to Santa Claus or Krampus before reading this issue, the pair’s “scared straight” approach to keeping kids off the naughty list shows that their tactics in fighting wickedness in the world are universal, something that The Dark Knight has taken to heart and made an entire superhero career out of. Santa Claus and Krampus exist in the DC Universe, and it’s clear that Batman owes them more than he’s letting on, especially when it comes to scaring the daylights out of the superstitious and cowardly lot of his city.






Batman/Santa Claus: Silent Knight #2 is now available from DC Comics.
