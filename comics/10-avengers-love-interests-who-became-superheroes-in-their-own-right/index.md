# 10 Avengers Love Interests Who Became Superheroes In Their Own Right


## SUMMARY 


 The love interests of many Avengers are becoming superheroes themselves, taking center stage and showcasing their own spectacular abilities. 
 Modern comics are correcting past wrongs by giving more depth and agency to female characters who were previously depicted as mere love interests or victims. 
 Several Avengers&#39; love interests, such as Mary Jane Watson, Gwen Stacy, Sharon Carter, Peggy Carter, Pepper Potts, Jane Foster, Liz Allan, and Betty Ross, have all embraced their superhero identities, proving to be powerful and capable heroes in their own right.

## Literature Review

On top of housing some of Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers sports some of the best love interests who make even better superheroes. 




When they&#39;re not saving the world from Kang or Thanos, several Avengers have been romantically linked to people who themselves go on to become superheroes. The Avengers roster boasts some of the greatest heroes within the Marvel Universe, and given the caliber of their love interests, they also boast some of the best partners within the Marvel Universe. In more recent times, these same love interests have started to take center stage in their own right to become the heroes they were destined to be.
It&#39;s becoming a trend for modern comics to attempt to correct the wrongs of comics past. The Golden Age of comic books often saw heroes&#39; romantic interests either never carve identities for themselves outside of being a hero&#39;s lover or fall into worse stereotypes, like the Women in Refrigerators trope where horrible things tend to happen to the (usually female) love interest in hopes of trying to motivate the (usually male) hero to do spectacular things. Now, women refuse to be refrigerated any longer and are ready to do spectacular things themselves. And in the Marvel Universe, there is no better way for a character to showcase themselves as spectacular as to become a superhero, as so many romantic partners of the Avengers have been doing.









 








 10  Mary Jane Watson Becomes Jackpot 
The Amazing Spider-Man #31 (2023)
        

This is the most recent addition to the list, so much so that Mary Jane Watson&#39;s superhero costume was only just unveiled recently. Thanks to a bracelet created by her new boyfriend, Paul, Mary Jane has access to practically any power she wants, but not necessarily whichever power she wants whenever she wants it. Her bracelet works much like a slot machine, hence the name, as the bracelet generates casino symbols to determine which power she gets at any given moment. So far, her young superhero career looks promising as MJ held her own in a fight with Peter Parker, saving Paul from a fateful fall, something Spider-Man couldn&#39;t do for Gwen Stacy.





 9  Gwen Stacy Becomes Spider-Gwen 
Edge of Spider-Verse #2 (2014)


 







Speaking of Gwen Stacy, her run as the Ghost-Spider (or, as some fans affectionately call her, Spider-Gwen) has endeared her as arguably the most beloved entry on the list. One of the lasting remnants of the Spider-Verse story arc, this version of Gwen is from Earth-65, where she was the teenage drummer for a band called the Mary Janes when she was bitten by a radioactive spider. In classic comic book lore, Gwen is one of the original examples of a damsel in distress, doomed after being dropped to her death by the Green Goblin. Spider-Gwen is a modern attempt to revitalize a character who was given virtually no character outside of being Spider-Man&#39;s girlfriend, and the attempt has been a rousing success.





 8  Sharon Carter Becomes the Destroyer 
Captain America: Cold War Omega #1 (2023)
        

Even before becoming a love interest to Steve Rogers, Sharon Carter was already a capable heroine thanks to her time with S.H.I.E.L.D., but it&#39;s only recently that she&#39;s been newly envisioned as a full-blown superhero. She recently became close to Roger Aubrey aka Destroyer as a part of Captain America&#39;s team of recruits. When she watched Roger die, it deeply affected Sharon to the point that she decided to adopt his name, along with a new costume, in hopes of carrying his memory. Her efforts proved useful in helping Steve take down the Outer Circle, and she&#39;s set to keep the ball rolling as the new Destroyer on the latest incarnation of the Thunderbolts.





 7  Peggy Carter Becomes the Dryad 
Captain America #12 (2019)
        

From one Carter to another, Kobik - a sentient Cosmic Cube - inadvertently brought back to life Peggy Carter while simultaneously creating a Steve Rogers clone for HYDRA. Not letting her second chance at life go to waste, Peggy immediately reunited with her granddaughter to lead the Daughters of Liberty, an all-woman superhero team. Naturally, in adopting the role of a superhero, Peggy adopted the codename Dryad. Of course, her recent betrayal of Captain America complicates her hero run, but outside the official Marvel canon is an even more successful hero run for Cap&#39;s former lover. On Earth-101, she&#39;s better known as Captain Britain.





 6  Pepper Potts Becomes Rescue 
Invincible Iron Man #10 (2009)
        

There are several instances where Tony Stark uses one of his Iron Man suits to come to Pepper Potts&#39; rescue. Still, it eventually became time for Pepper to start coming to her own rescue in Invincible Iron Man #10 by Matt Fraction, Salvador Larroca, Frank D&#39;Armata, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna, when the Rescue suit was unveiled for her. After Ezekiel Stane fired a shot that destroyed the Stark Dynamics building with party guests inside, Pepper was one of the few survivors, but she didn&#39;t escape uninjured. A chest plate similar to Tony&#39;s was surgically implanted to keep her alive.





 5  Jane Foster Becomes Thor 
Thor: God of Thunder #25 (2014)


 







Jane Foster has found new life in the Marvel Universe lately as Valkyrie, but her superhero journey first began as the Mighty Thor. During Jane&#39;s bout with breast cancer, Thor lost the ability to lift Mjolnir. The hammer sought Jane out specifically until she had Heimdall escort her to the moon where the hammer lay. Upon lifting it, she gained the powers of Thor as the Goddess of Thunder. However, the transformation was powerful enough to destroy the chemotherapy treatments within her body, worsening her cancer whenever she transformed, until she eventually died. Although admiring her sacrifice, Odin would help Thor bring Jane back to life.





 4  Liz Allan Becomes Misery 
Cult of Carnage: Misery #1 (2023)
        

Liz Allan had a brief run in Spider-Man&#39;s earliest adventures. Both as a love interest to Peter Parker and Flash Thompson, respectively, Liz&#39;s time on-panel is best remembered as a minor character in the grand scheme of Marvel lore, but a lot has changed since the 1960s. Rising up the ladder from former Osborn Industries exec to the CEO of Alchemax, a collaboration with the Life Foundation has put Liz into direct contact with a symbiote fusion of the Carnage and Anti-Venom symbiotes, turning her into Misery.





 3  Bucky Barnes Becomes Captain America 
Captain America #34 (2008)
        

Bucky Barnes was already a hero when originally introduced as Captain America&#39;s sidekick, but he effectively became a villain following his apparent death and modern-day resurfacing as the Winter Soldier. For all the evil he committed as the Winter Soldier, including assassinating President John F. Kennedy, Bucky had a lot to atone for when it was all said and done. His redemption arc included a partnership (both romantic and professional) with Black Widow. His efforts to make up for his past misdeeds were so successful that, upon the death of Steve Rogers, Bucky picked up the shield and mantle to become the new Captain America.





 2  Porcupine Becomes a Hero 
Spider-Woman #9 (2015)
        

In contrast to the rest of this list, Roger Gocking did not adopt a new identity upon becoming a superhero, but he did recontextualize his preexisting villain identity as the Porcupine to become the hero he was destined to be. The Porcupine name was always tied to villainy, dating back to when Alex Gentry was the Porcupine, until Gocking bought the rights to the name and armor. He used it to unleash his (admittedly disrespected) brand of evil until Spider-Woman saved his life, along with his family&#39;s lives when his estranged wife and daughter were kidnapped. He&#39;d become Spider-Woman&#39;s sidekick, and then a romance blossomed.





 1  Betty Ross Becomes Red Harpy 
Immortal Hulk #16 (2019)


 







The majority of fans best understand Betty Ross to be the beauty to the beast within Bruce Banner. In the comics, though, she&#39;s become a superhero as of late. As the Red Harpy, Betty has resurfaced in the most recent addition of Bruce&#39;s new series, The Incredible Hulk #5, but her Red Harpy persona dates back to Immortal Hulk #16. Betty is shot by the Bushwacker, but it doesn&#39;t kill her for good. Years prior, M.O.D.O.K. infuses Betty with enough gamma radiation to turn her into the Harpy. Still maintaining gamma mutates in her system long after the transformation was reversed, Betty&#39;s fatal shooting mutates her into a crimson version of the Harpy character.
Though she initially fights against the Hulk, the two eventually make up. When Doctor Strange begins assembling a new team of Defenders, Red Harpy is one of his recruits. Betty&#39;s transformation is arguably the most surprising superhero change for the love interest of an Avengers member.
