# “Everyone Thinks Youre So Stoic” Doctor Strange Calls Out Blade  Cool  Reputation


## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

While Blade may have a reputation as a cool-headed badass, Doctor Strange disagrees, calling out the vampire hunter&#39;s notoriously &#34;stoic&#34; personality.




Warning: Spoilers for Blade #5!Doctor Strange is no fan of Blade&#39;s ultra-cool personality. Blade fits into a mold filled by a bevy of protagonists across media who are often described with the word &#34;stoic.&#34; Stoic characters like Blade are normally too cool to emote and are defined by their calm and collected nature. Their stoic presence is usually why readers view them as badasses.




The title character&#39;s cool demeanor finally gets called out in Blade #5 by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, KJ Diaz, and VC&#39;s Cory Petit. Although readers may view Blade as a super cool, stoic badass, the characters around him may not share the same sentiment. Doctor Strange most certainly does not share that sentiment, and he picks a harsh time to rag on Blade about it.

          

As Blade makes demands on Strange to help them fight their latest foe, the Sorcerer Supreme does not hide his frustration with the Daywalker. He points out that Blade is not as cool and level-headed as his reputation might suggest.


 Doctor Strange is No Fan of Blade&#39;s Stoic Attitude 
          




The well-documented friendship between Doctor Strange and Blade has already been on the outs as of late thanks to the arrival of the Adana, along with the inadvertent role that Blade played in her arrival. Doctor Strange&#39;s last straw with Blade may have been when Strange&#39;s friends were killed by the Adana, courtesy of a twisted version of Ghost Rider&#39;s Penance Stare. Nonetheless, Strange helps Blade retrieve Lucifer&#39;s sword as the only tool capable of killing the Adana. However, Blade fails to defeat Adana in their final battle, letting the sword loose into her hands.

The confrontation becomes personal after the Adana put an agonizing demon inside of Blade&#39;s friend, weapons dealer, and sometimes lover, Tulip. As a result, Blade demands that Strange use a spell that gets him right next to the Adana for a face-to-face. Strange is having none of Blade&#39;s demands, nor his attitude and threats. &#34;And everyone thinks you&#39;re so stoic,&#34; Strange retorts after Blade suggests he&#39;ll destroy everything in the room if he doesn&#39;t get what he wants. &#34;Steve Rogers is stoic. You&#39;re a jacka--.&#34;






 Blade&#39;s Stoic Attitude Does Him No Favors 


          

On one hand, this is another instance of Blade and Doctor Strange&#39;s relationship with each other fracturing. On that basis, maybe that&#39;s how this exchange should be treated, just a case of one hero being increasingly bitter with another and saying things out of spite rather than fact. On the other hand, this is a moment of Marvel dismantling the stoic archetype that so many different readers have found themselves adoring. Readers have their favorite &#34;cool&#34; characters, but the issue goes to show how someone who actually has to exist around such a character will just find their qualities insufferable. Both Blade and Captain America may be stoic, but Marvel characters like Doctor Strange can only tolerate one of them.
