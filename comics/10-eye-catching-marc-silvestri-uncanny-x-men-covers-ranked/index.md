## Literature Review

Marc Silvestri created stunning covers for Chris Claremont’s Uncanny X-Men during the late 1980s; these 10 stand out as the best of a terrific bunch.




Marc Silvestri’s covers for Uncanny X-Men Vol. 1, from the late 1980s, are some of the series&#39; most iconic, with the ten featured below standing out as the best of the best. These covers, all of which also feature invaluable work from inker Dan Green, run the gamut of Silvestri’s time on Uncanny X-Men, providing a detailed insight into his stellar contributions to the monumental run.
During Marc Silvestri&#39;s time on Uncanny X-Men, the X-Men went underground, died, moved to Australia for the fan-favorite ‘Outback Era’ when they were believed dead, and then found themselves facing the forces of Limbo during the mega-event Inferno, before finally splitting up across the globe after an attack by  the Reavers. 

Silvestri was the regular penciler on the Chris Claremont-penned Uncanny X-Men in the era shortly after the Mutant Massacre. Silvestri continued to do terrific work on both the X-Men and other series in the decades following, but his time on Uncanny X-Men remains his best-loved work for fans of Marvel’s merry Mutants, and a tour de force of his artistic skill. The covers selected for this list represent the peak of his work on Uncanny during the late 1980s, with his covers being the first X-Men images that many long-time readers would encounter, in the pre-internet era of comic book fandom.

 10  Mister Sinister Is Depicted As A Huge Threat 
Uncanny X-Men #239 (Cover by Marc Silvestri and Dan Green)

        

Silvestri’s cover for &#34;Vanities&#34;, the prologue issue of Inferno, features a gloating Mister Sinister in the villain’s first ever cover appearance. The use of contrast in size, with Sinister portrayed as huge, with Madelyne Pryor and Havoc in the palm of his hand, is a classic technique for visually depicting a villain&#39;s influence in a story. Silvestri uses this to great effect on Uncanny X-Men #239’s cover, with Sinister looking directly at the viewer as if he can see them. Silvestri’s art also partially covers the series’ logo, making the cover appear more three-dimensional, a stylistic touch that is employed in nine of the ten covers on this list.





 9  The X-Men&#39; Outback Era Begins In Style 
Uncanny X-Men #229 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

Uncanny X-Men #229 is the first issue of the X-Men’s &#34;Outback era.&#34; Artists Silvestri and Green make perfect use of reddish and dark orange earth tones to illustrate this setting. Uncanny #229’s giant sun background also serves to spotlight and frame the action on the cover, drawing the viewer’s eye to the team at its center. The coloring of the bottom half of the image in a darker blue has the same effect, letting the eye know to focus instead on the orange of the sun, and the steel and white tones of Storm and Colossus’ powers as they fight the Reavers.





 8  Havok Brings Energy To X-Men&#39;s Covers 
Uncanny X-Men #221 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

Since the introduction of his unique costume design, artists have leaned into the concentric circles of Havok’s plasma powers to spectacular effect – and Uncanny #221’s cover is no different. Here, Havok’s power creates a sense of perspective. He is depicted in the background of the fram, with the energy beams emanating from his body connecting him to Wolverine in the forground which, with Alex and Logan’s respective positioning effectively creating perspective, as well as a sense of active movement in this cover. The light blue of Havok’s outburst also contrasts nicely with the warmer tones of Wolverine’s costume and the fire covering Logan.
Havok&#39;s costume debuted on Neal Adams and Sam Rosen’s cover to X-Men vol 1 #58 – written by Roy Thomas, penciled by Adams, inked by Tom Palmer and lettered by Artie Simek. 






 7  Inferno’s Demonic Forces Get The Spotlight 
Uncanny X-Men #241 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

Silvestri’s covers for the Uncanny X-Men sections of Inferno are all classics, with each giving a group shot of characters involved in the story set against a single-colored background. The strength of Uncanny #241’s cover, which focuses on the demonic forces of Limbo and the Goblin Queen, is its framing. Maddie Pryor’s cape is mirrored by the demon N’astirh’s wings, and together, cape and wings form a satisfying shape, with a clear delineation between figures and solid background. – stylistic feature that gives all of Silvestri’s Inferno covers a movie poster-style look. Silvestri also draws the Goblin Queen like no-one else, and this is perhaps the most famous image of Madelyne Pryor ever.

Writer Chris Claremont, whose work defined modern X-Men storytelling, remains critical of the decision to retcon Madalyne Pryor as a Jean Grey clone. 








 6  Polaris’ Pain Is Portrayed Perfectly 
Uncanny X-Men #250 (Cover by Silvestri, Green and Joe Rosen)

        

The cover of Uncanny X-Men #250 does as much work as a panel inside the book to show the mental anguish of Polaris as she’s possessed by Malice. From the beams shooting from Lorna’s brain, to the lightning emanating from Malice’s eyes, to the eye-catching black and orange background, the cover is full of different flourishes to draw the viewer’s attention. It is these touches that elevate this cover into the upper echelons of Silvestri’s Uncanny X-Men work. The cover also features work from, and explicitly credits, letterer Joe Rosen, a reminder of a time when putting text on comics covers was much the norm than it is today.





 5  Wolverine&#39;s Grotesque Transformation 
Uncanny X-Men #234 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

Uncanny X-Men #234 – one of several classic Silvestri covers featuring Wolverine – is unforgettable, with its image of a Brood-posessed Logan. Silvestri once again uses color to its fullest potential, with a moody dark blue-green palette setting the mood and positioning Logan as a dark tortured figure. Silvestri’s Uncanny X-Men covers are often group shots, making issue #234 a particularly great reminder that the artist is just as skilled at single-character studies. He takes this opportunity to really impress, with an iconic character drawing against a striking purple backdrop. Silvestri emphasizes Logan’s musculature, and this level of detail continues in his Brood-transformed face, which is made all the more unsettling thanks to the image&#39;s level of realism.





 4  X-Factor Storm Onto The Scene 
Uncanny X-Men #242 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

Uncanny X-Men #242 is another of Silvestri’s classic Inferno covers. Once again, the colors are immaculate, with the royal blue background being especially striking. While covers with fully drawn backgrounds are often more realistic, issue #242’s cover shows that a level of artifice can have just as stunning an effect. While it’s not an exact replica, this posing of the heroes also clearly homages Gil Kane, Dave Cockrum and Danny Crespi’s iconic cover to Giant-Size X-Men #1 (written by Len Wein, penciled by Cockrum, inked by Cockrum and Peter Iro, colored by Glynis Oliver and lettered by John Costanza), one of the most-referenced X-Men covers of all time.  





 3  The Marauders Get Their Hero Shot 
Uncanny X-Men #240 (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

The cover to Uncanny X-Men #240 highlights Inferno’s villains, centering them against a bright red background, a deliberate contrast to Uncanny #242’s cover. Both issue #240’s opposing color, and the posing of its figures, intentionally mirror the subsequent issue&#39;s cover. The X-Men were portrayed against a backdrop of heroic royal blue, while the villains get bright red. What is also fun about this cover is that the villains are hero-coded. Since this cover mirrors issue #242, and by extension Giant-Size X-Men #1, the Marauders get a classic ‘X-Men running at the viewer’ moment of their own, emphasizing their central role in the epic crossover storyline.

 2  Wolverine&#39;s Most Striking Cover Ever 
Uncanny X-Men #251: (Cover by Silvestri and Green)

        

The crucified Wolverine on the cover of Uncanny X-Men #251 remains one of the most famous, most lauded, images of Logan ever. The shading Dan Green uses to simulate rain gives the cover a texture that’s near-unmatched in comics, before or since. The green-blue-purple palette, reminiscent of Uncanny X-Men #234’s cover, is used to even better effect here, in order to create a despondent mood, emphasize Logan’s isolation. The series’ logo itself is transparent, so as not to detract from this mood, and every aspect of the cover works in sync to bring the viewer into the scene, create the atmosphere of hopelessness few X-Men covers have ever matched.





 1  The X-Men&#39;s Bold New Era Begins With A Gorgeous Cover 
Uncanny X-Men #227 (Cover by Silvestri, Green and Alex Jay)

        

Uncanny X-Men #227, the final issue of the X-Men’s section of the Fall of the Mutants event, has a perfect cover. The flying team of X-Men set against a spectacularly rendered sun isn’t just a great illustration of the X-Men heading to the Australian outback, but also a metaphor for the issue itself. The team literally die in the issue but are brought back to life. In concert with this, the sun on the cover is both setting and rising at the same time, death and rebirth at once. This cover, above all others, shows how incredible Marc Silvestri and Dan Green are, and what a gift their time on the X-Men was.
