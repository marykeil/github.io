# In 2023, Marvel Began Assembling A Twisted Version of the Avengers


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel has introduced evil counterparts of its most recognizable characters, creating a potential villainous version of the Avengers.   Characters like Toranos, General Strange, and Hydra-Cap are direct correlations to Thor, Doctor Strange, and Captain America.   Feilong&#39;s takeover of Stark Industries and use of Iron Man tech represents the malformation of everything Iron Man stands for, and to this point he has done everything short of suiting up in his own armor.

## Literature Review

Marvel introduced bad versions of Thor &amp; Dr. Strange in the past year, brought back Steve Rogers&#39; evil clone and put Stark tech in a bad guy&#39;s hands.




The past year has been an ambitious period for Marvel, as they have relaunched a number of titles, rebooted the Ultimate Universe, and introduced a number of exciting new characters – including a slate of twisted Avengers analogues that the Marvel Universe should hope don&#39;t find reason to come together and form a team.




Across titles including Captain America, Iron Man, The Immortal Thor, and Uncanny Avengers, Marvel has introduced, or reintroduced characters who correspond to some of the company&#39;s highest-profile heroes, including several that are synonymous with the &#34;Avengers&#34; name.

         

These new threats include Toranos, the Elder God of Thunder, and General Strange, a vengeful version of Doctor Strange. The infamous Captain America clone from Secret Empire was reintroduced as Captain Krakoa, before becoming the latest incarnation of Flag Smasher. Also notable, X-Men antagonist Feilong performed a hostile takeover of Stark Industries, putting Iron Man tech at the disposal of anti-mutant organization Orchis.


 Marvel&#39;s Evil Avengers Are Ready To Come Together 
         






Immortal Thor is written by Al Ewing, with art by Martin Coccolo.




Marvel – and comic book storytelling in general – is no stranger to antagonists who reflect their protagonists in one way or another. One of the criticisms of the early phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was that the villains were almost exclusively inversions of the hero. This has proved to still be a popular narrative move in 2023, as a number of titles have dealt with evil, or corrupted, counterparts for its most recognizable characters. As a result, Marvel has – intentionally or not – introduced a nearly full roster for a potential villainous version of the Avengers.



General Strange was created by Jed McKay and Pasqual Ferry. His first full appearance was in Doctor Strange (Vol. 6) #5.







This year, Doctor Strange faced off against a corrupted part of his psyche, General Strange, which had been separated from him and imprisoned for thousands of years. Recently, in Uncanny Avengers, &#34;Stevil,&#34; the villainous Hydra clone of Steve Rogers, returned as an agent of of Orchis, leading a new incarnation of the Mutant Liberation Front, intended to sow further discord in human-mutant relations. Perhaps the most interesting example of this trend is Toranos, introduced in Immortal Thor #1, is the Utgard-God &#34;of the superstorm,&#34; with Thor being posited as a derivative of this primordial character, rather than the other way around.

         



Uncanny Avengers (Vol. 4) is written by Gerry Duggan, with art by Javier Garron.







Toranos, Hydra-Cap, and General Strange are all direct, one-to-one correlations to Thor, Captain America, and Doctor Strange, respectively – but other potential &#34;twisted Avengers&#34; have been represented in the past year. Most notably, Orchis leader Feilong has been a thorn in Tony Stark&#39;s side in Invincible Iron Man, taking control of Stark Industries, and using Iron Man tech to create mutant-hunting Stark Sentinels. It is unlikely this story will play out and not feature Feilong suiting up in some form of Iron Man armor before it is said and done. While not a direct correspondence to Tony Stark, Feilong certainly represents the malformation of everything Iron Man stands for.

Feilong was created by Gerry Duggan and Pepe Larraz. He first appeared in X-Men (Vol. 6) #1.

There are certainly other evil Avenger-analogues lurking in the Marvel Universe who could complete a potential team-up. Notably, the mutant Fenris twins – similar in many ways to long-time Avengers Wanda and Pietro Maximoff – were members of Hydra Cap&#39;s Mutant Liberation Front, and paid dearly for it at the hands of Psylocke. They could certainly return, more determined than ever to make Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes pay, and elevate themselves to another level of villain in the Marvel Universe in the process. Though this may not have been Marvel&#39;s endgame this year, a twisted, villainous version of the Avengers may very well be on the horizon.
