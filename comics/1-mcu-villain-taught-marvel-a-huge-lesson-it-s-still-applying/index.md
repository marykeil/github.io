# 1 MCU  Villain  Taught Marvel a Huge Lesson It s Still Applying


## SUMMARY 



  J. Jonah Jameson remains a constant character in multiple universes, including the MCU and Marvel Comics.   The upcoming Ultimate Spider-Man comic introduces a new version of Peter Parker with a family and new villains, but J. Jonah Jameson is still exactly the same.   The fan outcry about keeping J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson in the MCU seemingly influenced Marvel Comics&#39; decision to maintain the character&#39;s consistent portrayal.

## Literature Review

J. Jonah Jameson may be one of the MCU&#39;s softer villains, but he proved to be one all the same, and he also taught Marvel Comics one major lesson. 




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Ultimate Spider-Man #1While it may seem a bit unfair to classify J. Jonah Jameson as a Marvel Comics villain in any universe, it can’t be disputed that the character not only made Spider-Man’s life a living hell in the MCU, but he also put him and his entire family in danger with the constant negative press. But, beyond how he’s classified in the MCU or any other reality, the one thing in particular that stood out about JJ is also the most obvious: he’s the same. J.K. Simmons plays J. Jonah Jameson in both the MCU and the ‘Raimiverse’, suggesting that the iconic journalist is the same in every universe - something Marvel Comics is still applying.




Marvel Comics is rebooting the Ultimate Universe with the launch of a number of comic titles set within this new alternate reality. Rather than revitalizing the original Ultimate Universe of Earth-1610, Marvel’s new Ultimate Universe is set within Earth-6160, which means there are no constraints when it comes to character development or direction. One new upcoming title is Ultimate Spider-Man, the trailer for which can be viewed below.


 

In this trailer, fans are introduced to a new version of Peter Parker, one with a wife, two kids, and a seemingly high-paying job. Plus, the Ultimate Green Goblin is shown to be his arch rival in this universe as well. And of course, no Spider-Man continuity can be complete without the aforementioned iconic journalist: J. Jonah Jameson.





 Ultimate Spider-Man Preview Proves Marvel Will Never Change J. Jonah Jameson 
          

In the trailer for Ultimate Spider-Man by Jonathan Hickman and Marco Checchetto, fans are shown the Peter Parker of Earth-6160 fighting familiar villains like the Kingpin and the Green Goblin, while also donning some of Spider-Man’s more iconic suits from Marvel Comics&#39; main continuity, like the Symbiote Suit and the Spider-Man 2099 costume.

What fans also see is the familiar face of J. Jonah Jameson screaming in his newsroom - presumably at Parker, but really it could be at anyone - just as the preview’s drama begins to build with heart-pounding music and jaw-dropping visuals. This universe is experiencing a superhero renaissance, of sorts, and Jonah is there to lead the coverage on this phenomenon as it relates to New York City - just like he always does.






 J. Jonah Jameson Is Marvel’s True Multiversal Constant (The MCU &amp; Comics Prove It) 
          

The fan outcry about having J.K. Simmons cast as J. Jonah Jameson in the MCU was abundant, to say the least, before he made his official debut in Spider-Man: Far From Home and his full debut as a main character in Spider-Man: No Way Home. This made it abundantly clear that - as far as JJ goes - fans do not want him to change. No matter what’s going on with Spider-Man or his villains across the multiverse (in both the comics and the MCU), fans want J. Jonah Jameson to stay exactly the same. And his latest depiction within the Ultimate Universe proves this won’t change anytime soon.

J. Jonah Jameson, one of the softer villains in Spider-Man’s cadre (though a villainous pain-in-the-butt all the same), is a true multiversal constant in the MCU and Marvel Comics, something that was arguably sparked by the fan outcry to keep J.K. Simmons as the character in the MCU. This means that this one MCU ‘villain’ taught Marvel Comics a huge lesson that it’s still applying.




Ultimate Spider-Man #1 by Marvel Comics is available January 10, 2024.
