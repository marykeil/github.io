## Literature Review

Joker once wore his own batsuit during a failed attempt at bringing Gotham to its knees, with this DC cosplay nailing that live-action look perfectly.




During Batman’s most recent war against the Joker, The Dark Knight faced off against an arch nemesis who would stop at nothing to burn his city to the ground while simultaneously doing his best to defend Bruce Wayne’s legacy from utter devastation. And now, in a new DC Comics cosplay, The Clown Prince of Crime’s Joker War batsuit gets the real-world treatment it deserves, showing what a Joker Batman could and should look like up on the big screen.




Posts recently uploaded to social media via Reddit and shared on its popular r/cosplay channel, username u/Cosplayben is no stranger to creating comic-accurate cosplay designs, especially when bringing to life heroes and villains clad head-to-toe in superhero garb.


 

Having previously created impressive homemade looks for other DC characters like Jaime Reyez’s Blue Beetle, Aquaman’s Black Manta, Arkham Knight from the Batman: Arkham Knight video game, Eobard Thawne aka Reverse Flash, and more, u/Cosplayben has also worn outfits based on Marvel’s Iron Man and Spider-Man, with a surprise My Hero Academia crossover costume called Spider-Deku doing both fictional heroes justice.

 DC Cosplay Brings The Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s Joker War Batsuit To Life 

 




Released in 2020, the Joker War event, by James Tynion IV and Jorge Jimenez, was a story that not only stripped Bruce Wayne of his billions and ruined his reputation but also saw Harley Quinn take her first steps toward becoming the hero she currently is while pushing Joker’s latest girlfriend, Punchline, into the spotlight with ruthless abandon. Donning The Dark Knight’s then-new metallic teal outfit originally meant to be worn while fighting crime during the day, Joker’s modified version of this batsuit falls right in line with his brand of evil, with u/Cosplayben’s homemade design nailing this now iconic look perfectly.

Filmed at this year’s Anime NYC, u/Cosplayben’s first post shows his Joker batsuit in all of its visually stunning glory as he struts down a flight of stairs like the bat-clown he is. Brandishing a pistol that u/Cosplayben waves around and gestures wildly with, this Joker War cosplay is made complete by a flowing purple cape, shiny teal armor and cowl, glowing eyes, graffiti chest smile, multiple “ha-ha” scrawls, and, of course, a wide white grin. Showing a still-in-progress build of this Joker costume in the second post, it’s made immediately apparent just how much work went into creating this unique cosplay design, with this behind-the-scenes peek being something that fans of the character and the Joker War storyline in general can truly appreciate.

So while it’s almost certain the Joker won’t be wearing this suit again in the world of comics, there’s always a chance it could make an appearance in the next iteration of DC Comics’ shared cinematic universe, especially considering the next version of The Clown Prince of Crime has still yet to make his big screen debut. Joker had the chance to don his own version of Batman’s batsuit in Joker War, and now, thanks to u/Cosplayben, this comic design has been proven to work not only on the page but in real life, too.
