Summary

  Sith lightsaber crystals are just as unique as normal kyber, defined by the pain and emotions poured into them by their wielders.   Healing a Sith&#39;s corrupted kyber requires empathy and understanding of their individual pain.   Luke Skywalker faces a new villain from the past as he tries to heal a red kyber, leading to an intriguing storyline that&#39;s only just begun.  







Star Wars has revealed that all Sith lightsaber crystals are incredibly different despite all sharing the same red color. According to the established Star Wars canon and timeline, Sith kyber is a crystal that once belonged to a slain Jedi. The dark side wielders then take those living kyber crystals and make them bleed by infusing them with all of their dark emotions. However, it&#39;s since been revealed that pain plays a key role in this corruptive transformation.

In the new Star Wars #42 from Charles Soule and Steven Cummings, Luke Skywalker wants to learn more about the red kyber he was given by Doctor Cuata, a kyber specialist who worked on the Death Star before escaping the Empire. Wanting to learn how to purify and restore the kyber, Luke seeks the help of the Fallanassi Gretta and her aunt, Force adepts belonging to an order gifted in the art of kyber purification that has nearly been wiped out.

          




Eventually agreeing to help Luke heal this red kyber from its corruption, Gretta&#39;s aunt reveals some key truths about the darkened crystals. As a result, the lore of Sith lightsaber crystals has become even more expansive thanks to this new Star Wars issue.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Red Kyber Is Defined By Its Wielder&#39;s Unique Pain 
Everyone&#39;s Pain Is Different, And Red Kyber Is The Same Way
          

According to Auntie Feez, healing kyber is a dangerous practice that requires much from the one attempting to bring about the healing process. This is because dark wielders pour all of their pain and anguish into a kyber crystal, meaning that the path to healing a Sith&#39;s kyber is always different. It&#39;s &#34;a unique exercise in empathy&#34; as one Sith&#39;s pain and past trauma is obviously unique to their individual experience.




This means that each piece of Sith kyber that has been bled crimson is distinctly unique as well. While they may all look the same compared to all the various lightsaber colors wielded by the Jedi, the dark connections binding corrupted kyber to their Sith wielders are just as powerful and unique. As such, it&#39;s a darkly satisfying explanation that further confirms dark kyber is just as complex and fascinating as normal kyber, even if they all share the same blood-red coloring.



 What Kind Of Pain Behind Star Wars&#39; New Rogue Sith? 
Luke Faces An All-New Villain From A Past Era
          

In the final pages of Star Wars #42, Luke indeed tries to heal the red kyber he was given by Doctor Cuata, though he likely got more than he was bargaining for. Experiencing the painful past of the presumed Sith Lord who corrupted the kyber in the ancient past, Luke finds himself inside what appears to be a living memory of the past, one where the spirit of this &#34;Rogue Sith&#34; is well aware of Luke&#39;s presence in his Sith fortress, just as he was the first time Luke tried connected with the kyber back in Star Wars #35.




Having told Luke the first time that he wouldn&#39;t find any pain in his hall, it appears as though this Rogue Sith has a very different relationship with pain and anguish than typical Sith lords. As such, it should be very interesting to learn more about this Sith and his past, especially now that he&#39;s locked Luke in his dungeons at the issue&#39;s end.

Star Wars #42 is available now from Marvel Comics.
