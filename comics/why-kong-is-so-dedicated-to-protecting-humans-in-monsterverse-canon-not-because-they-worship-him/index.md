# Why Kong Is So Dedicated to Protecting Humans in MonsterVerse Canon (Not Because They Worship Him)


## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

Kong is humanity&#39;s true champion in the MonsterVerse, as he always tries to save people when fighting monsters. Here&#39;s why he cares about humanity! 




Within the established continuity of the MonsterVerse, there are no greater heroes than Godzilla and Kong, with Kong arguably being an even more committed champion of humanity as opposed to Godzilla, who keeps humans in-check the same way he does the Titans around the planet. And now, it’s revealed exactly why Kong is so dedicated to protecting humans, and it’s not because the indigenous people on Skull Island have been worshiping him for generations.




Upon his introduction in Kong: Skull Island, Kong displayed a shocking level of protectiveness over humans, choosing to save them many times throughout the film rather than allowing his fellow Titans to kill them as they pleased. Kong was even able to differentiate between the humans who were good-hearted amid the team of invaders blasting charges all over his island - that’s how empathetically intuitive Kong was.

          

This could be easy to explain away as Kong protecting those who worship him while still killing humans who give him trouble, but that’s not actually the case. Kong is inherently protective of any human who isn’t actively a threat to him or his island, regardless of their worship. So, why does he do it? Why does Kong care so much about people that he’s willing to fight his fellow monsters and put his own life on the line just to protect them? The answer lies in Kong’s absolutely heartbreaking origin story.




                  &#34;It Makes Him Invincible&#34;: Kong&#39;s MonsterVerse Origin Reveals Why He&#39;s So Powerful   Kong&#39;s origin within the MonsterVerse exposes why he&#39;s such a powerful Titan, as well as his shocking connection to Skull Island&#39;s Titan War.   


 Kong’s Tragic Origin Made Him The MonsterVerse Hero He Is Today 
         

In the four-part miniseries Skull Island: The Birth Of Kong by Barnaby Legg, Arvid Nelson, and Zid, Kong’s origin story is told slowly, through fragmented visions experienced by the ultimate antagonist of the series, and it’s just as tragically depressing as one could imagine.

Kong’s parents were the last two members of his entire species, and they died fighting Skullcrawlers the day Kong was born. In fact, Kong was born during that fateful battle, meaning the first thing he ever saw as an infant was the sight of his parents getting slaughtered by Skullcrawlers.






 Kong Experienced A Great Loss, &amp; Wants To Protect Humans From Experiencing The Same 
          

Kong and his entire species of ape-like Titans are perhaps the closest monsters to humans in the entire MonsterVerse (including Godzilla). This means that Kong likely feels closer to humans than he does with other Titans, especially those who live on Skull Island, like Psychovultures, Mother Longlegs, and - of course - Skullcrawlers. There is a level of emotional and intellectual development within Kong that makes him far more than just a giant monkey, and his ability to empathize with humans completely proves it. That’s the reason Kong protects humanity from monstrous threats. He knows humans process feelings the same way he does - including and especially immense loss - and he wants to save them from that pain.

Kong’s empathy separates him from the other monsters, including Godzilla, as he doesn’t fight the Titans to keep the world in balance, he does so specifically to save humans. He knows what it’s like to feel incomparable sorrow - something the more primitive Titans do not - and he wants to protect the comparably helpless humans from experiencing the sadness he felt upon seeing his parents killed by monsters. Empathy, not worship, is why Kong is so dedicated to protecting humans in MonsterVerse canon.
