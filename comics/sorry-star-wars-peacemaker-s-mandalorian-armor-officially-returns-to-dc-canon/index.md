## Literature Review

Peacemaker has a lot of different armors and helmets he uses to bring peace to the masses, with his Mandalorian-like design returning to DC Comics.




Spoilers for Batman/Superman: World’s Finest #22!The DC Comics hero known as Peacemaker has more helmeted looks at his disposal than Batman has specialized batsuits, with some of his most iconic designs giving him unique abilities that he wouldn’t usually have access to while waging his ceaseless war for peace. Now, in a return to the Kingdom Come universe, Peacemaker has been spotted sporting a set of Mandalorian armor, a suit he hasn’t worn in over two decades.




More recently becoming popular thanks to John Cena’s live-action portrayal of the character in the DCEU&#39;s Peacemaker show, Peacemaker debuted in 1966 as part of Charlton Comics then was acquired by DC Comics in the late 80s, and from there became a lesser-known but still important member of DC’s sprawling comic book universe.

          

Having a quick cameo as a member of Magog’s Justice Battalion during the events of 1996’s Kingdom Come, by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, Peacemaker is seen wearing a full-faced Mandalorian-esque helmet, Beskar-like shoulder and chest armor (the latter having Peacemaker’s dove logo on it), jetpack, and brandishing a futuristic blaster, all of which have just made their comeback in DC canon proper.

                  Peacemaker Gets His Own Iron Man Armor In Ultimate Fan Service Upgrade   As Peacemaker gets a huge upgrade to kill DC&#39;s superheroes, fans get to see what Christopher Smith would look like as Iron Man.   





 Peacemaker&#39;s Kingdom Come Mandalorian Armor Gets Another DC Comics Cameo 
          

A set of armor glimpsed in Batman/Superman: World&#39;s Finest #22, by Mark Waid and Dan Mora, Peacemaker makes his return as a faux Mandalorian during a scuffle with Batman and Superman after they inexplicably land in the Kingdom Come universe. Much like the quick one-and-done appearance of this armor in the original Kingdom Come graphic novel, this returning version of Peacemaker is only seen on panel twice, once as the fighting breaks out as he rushes helmet-first to take on Batman and a second time soon after where he has his back turned to viewers, a familiar-looking jetpack firing off mid-battle.

A design accused of visually ripping off Star Wars’ Boba Fett character thanks to a look that’s practically a 1:1 recreation of his iconic Mandalorian armor, Kingdom Come artist Alex Ross more likely drew Peacemaker wearing this remixed costume because he was the only character at the time who could have realistically made the look work, allowing Ross to easily give props to an influential franchise that’s inspired thousands. What’s more, this armor is a nice reminder for DC fans that before Star Wars became synonymous with Marvel exclusivity and Disney’s jam-packed new era of content, DC could have some fun with the brand, something that isn’t as prevalent nowadays.






 Peacemaker&#39;s Best Look Returns In A Kingdom Come Prequel Story 
          

So while Peacemaker’s Mandalorian armor hasn’t been shown outside of the Kingdom Come universe as of yet, it’s hands down one of his best-looking designs that not only pays homage to Star Wars in the best way possible but makes Peacemaker an even more formidable player on the field of battle thanks to its multiple offensive upgrades. Peacemaker will undoubtedly get a new armored look the next time he faces a situation that calls for a specialized solution, so the official return of this Mandalorian outfit hopefully bodes well for its debut in DC Comics’ “main” continuity, jetpack, and all.



Batman/Superman: World’s Finest #22 is now available from DC Comics.
