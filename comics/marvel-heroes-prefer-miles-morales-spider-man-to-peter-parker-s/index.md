## Literature Review

Two people are Spider-Man in the state of New York, but only one has the New York stamp of approval.




Warning: The Amazing Spider-Man #39!




There are two versions of Spider-Man active in New York, but the city&#39;s other heroes definitely prefer one over the other. Miles Morales and Peter Parker are both iconic Webslingers – and Marvel&#39;s current &#34;Gang War&#34; crossover event is forcing them to work more closely together than they have in some time, while at the same time exposing how their hero peers feel about them both as individuals.

The Amazing Spider-Man (2022) #39 – by Zeb Wells, John Romita Jr., Scott Hanna, Marcio Menyz, and VC&#39;s Joe Caramagna – reveals Miles Morales to be the favored Spider-Man of NYC&#39;s hero set. Miles has had a series of team-ups lately, which have served to validate the idea that many heroes in the area have warmed up to the younger Spider-Man, to the point where they prefer him over Peter Parker.

         




Recent events have revealed how the original Spider-Man is only getting further and further away from being in the good graces of the local heroes, with Peter quickly falling out of favor with numerous superheroes, including Miles himself.


 Marvel&#39;s Heroes LIke Miles Morales More Than Peter Parker 
         

As Marvel&#39;s &#34;Gang War&#34; commences, Peter Parker compiles a team of superheroes to help him quell the fires happening across New York. As Tombstone recoveries from his shooting injuries and Hammerhead is presumed dead, the remaining gangs of New York are fighting for territory, causing chaos. Peter tries to give orders to his newly assembled squad, but all of the heroes he&#39;s recruited ignore him, in favor of doing their own thing. Miles is no exception, as he remains upset with Peter for ghosting him recently. As Miles leaves, with his Venom Saber in hand, only a visibly annoyed She-Hulk is left behind with Peter, and their dynamic is clearly tense.




She-Hulk seems noticeably more impressed with Miles Morales than Peter in Amazing Spider-Man #39, and she isn&#39;t the first hero recently to be impressed with Miles recently. Not long before, Miles gained Blade&#39;s respect during their team-up, enough for Marvel&#39;s premiere vampire fighter to gift Miles his own anti-vampire costume. Similarly, Iron Man showed that he likes Miles enough to give him an Iron Spider suit of his own. As more heroes continue to take a liking to Miles, those same heroes have seemingly to start harbor disdain for Peter – or maybe the seeds of that disdain were there for many of them, and they&#39;re only just now starting to show it.



 The Original Spider-Man Has A Likability Problem 
          

The Amazing Spider-Man: Gang War First Strike #1 included Miles calling out Peter for his toxic traits, some of which the character has exhibited since his introduction over sixty years ago. Peter has spent years not showing up for his superhero friends, in the same way he failed to show up for Miles. If Miles thinks he&#39;s a bad friend for it, it is possible the rest of the Marvel Universe agrees. Further, if Miles is sick of those traits, other heroes might be too. With two Spider-Men in the picture, heroes are witnessing Miles be the Spider-Man that Peter should be, and that is leading them to finally become fed up with the original.
