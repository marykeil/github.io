# Iron Lad, Illuminati, and The Parkers Every Promise Marvel Needs To Keep From 2023s Ultimate Universe Reboot


## SUMMARY 


 Marvel&#39;s New 
Ultimate 
Universe, with Jonathan Hickman at the helm, has built up a lot of anticipation, with the 
Ultimate Invasion 
miniseries making a lot of promises that the new slate of ongoing 
Ultimate
 titles should strive to keep. 
 The new 
Ultimate 
Universe is irrevocably tied to the memory of the original incarnation of the imprint (2000-2015) – as a result, it should consciously work to be its own, distinct version of the Marvel Universe. 
Ultimate 
Marvel should strive to not only distinguish itself from the mainstream Marvel Universe, as the original did in 2000, but for each title to have its own unique, engaging tone, distinct from one another.

## Literature Review

The new Ultimate Universe launches its first ongoing titles in 2024, and fans have many expectations for these books, from plot, to tone, to themes.




Marvel’s freshly rebooted Ultimate Universe comes with some high expectations. Not only have the first stories out of the Universe promised a lot, these new incarnations of classic Marvel heroes are irrevocably tied to readers memories&#39; of the original incarnation of the Ultimate Universe, which launched in 2000, and ended in 2015.
Ultimate Invasion is written by Jonathan Hickman, penciled by Bryan Hitch, inked by Andrew Currie, colored by Alex Sinclair and lettered by Joe Caramagna. 

Readers were introduced to this new universe with the miniseries Ultimate Invasion, and now its first ongoing titles are set to premiere. This was followed by the Ultimate Universe #1 one-shot, which further established the new status quo that the upcoming books will operate within. There are numerous expectations to meet with these series, whether story hooks that are already planted, expectations based on book solicits, or trends which will hopefully inform the broader feel of the universe and carry throughout the line. These are the ten most important of these promises, the things Marvel should focus on giving readers with this new version of its Ultimate imprint.
Ultimate Universe #1 is written by Hickman, illustrated by Stefano Caselli, colored by David Curiel and lettered by Joe Caramagna. 










 








 10  Take The Parker Family Seriously 
Ultimate Spider-Man


 







The new Ultimate Spider-Man, written by Jonathan Hickman and illustrated by Marco Checchetto, will focus on an older Peter Parker, one who is already married with a family when he gets his Spider-Powers. This series needs to take this set-up seriously, with a Peter who has a responsibility to not just the world, but to his family. Married superheroes with families so rarely last, so this series needs to show why they can work. This isn’t to say, however, that the family shouldn’t have conflict or drama that threatens to tear them apart; on the contrary, this should be a constant worry, a core part of the book.





 9  Pay Off What Ultimate Invasion Set Up For Tony Stark 
Ultimate Iron Lad
        

After Ultimate Invasion, Earth-6160’s Tony Stark is clearly set up to become Kang the Conqueror, so his fate should be one of this universe’s defining arcs. Tony’s taken the moniker of Iron Lad, a title held by a young, heroic Kang in mainstream Marvel, and is already using time travel technology, so he’s already part of the way to becoming Kang. There’s still a possibility that this is a fakeout, since Kang’s identity is never explicitly confirmed in Ultimate Invasion, but Tony’s journey should feel important irrespective, and the potential for him to become Kang should hang as a narrative weight over his head.





 8  Play With Familiar Stories And Readers’ Expectations 
Ultimate Reboot V2.0
        

One strength of the original Ultimate Universe was that it was often informed by classic Marvel stories, but then would put twists on them, instead of feeling beholden to do the same thing readers had already seen. This new Ultimate Universe has already set the expectation that this trend will continue through showing warped versions of both Iron Lad’s story, as well as the discovery of Captain America. It’s crucial this universe keep up the trend of being playful with classic stories without being overly reverent to them, since otherwise there’s no point in making a new version of them whatsoever.





 7  Make The Illuminati A Sustainable Threat 
Ultimate Conspiracy


 







Ultimate Invasion, and especially Ultimate Universe #1, set up the Maker’s evil council of supervillainous world leaders, as the perfect threat to the burgeoning heroes, so this council needs to be a major threat throughout all the new books, even if they’re not the primary villains in every arc. From previews, Ultimate Black Panther – written by Bryan Edward Hill and illustrated by Stefano Caselli – is already set to fulfill this promise, with the new Moon Knight(s) as the inciting antagonist, even as it also introduces a new Killmonger. How the villainous council, the Ultimate version of the Illuminati, might fit in Ultimate Spidey and X-Men, however, remains to be seen.





 6  The Return Of The Maker Will Be A Massive Moment 
Ultimate Ticking Clock
        

At the conclusion of Ultimate Invasion, the evil Reed Richards known as the Maker and his forces are timelocked inside the City, the Maker’s high-tech base, for 2 years, thanks to Howard Stark. Due to time dialation, thousands of years will occur for them while trapped trapped inside. The return of The Maker needs to be a huge deal for this universe, and what will be most fascinating will be seeing exactly how the Maker has changed over this long period of time. This plot point gives the newv Universe a major ticking clock, and his return must then feel massive when it happens.





 5  Keep The Barrier Between Earth-6160 &amp; Earth-616 Loose 
Ultimate Crossover
        

Ultimate Invasion #1 laid some obvious groundwork for a big Earth-6160/Earth-616 crossover, with the Maker gifting Miles Morales a mysterious blank business card, as a way to contact him, even potentially across universes. It seems inevitable that either Miles, the Maker, or even the mainstream Marvel Universe’s Illuminati will use this card to cross between universes, just as the Maker did in Ultimate Invasion #1. This is only more likely since the Earth-616 Illuminati are unaware that the Maker was defeated in Ultimate Invasion, and are still just as motivated to find out where he’s gone – especially Reed Richards, for whom this fight is personal.





 4  Captain America Must Get A Shot At Redemption 
Ultimate Second Chance
        

Ultimate Universe #1 worked to establishing a new version of the Ultimates, the Ultimate equivalent to the Avengers, with the major &#34;Chekov’s Gun&#34; of Captain America being discovered, though still in ice by the end of the issue. Writer Deniz Camp will be writing an Ultimates book which will be set up in FREE COMIC BOOK DAY 2024: SPIDER-MAN &amp; THE ULTIMATE UNIVERSE #1 – written by Camp and Zeb Wells, with art by Ryan Stegman and Juan Frigeri. Cap’s debut needs to be big, but what exactly it will mean for the Universe is still uncertain, especially since his original Ultimate counterpart is infamously one of the least well-received from the original Ultimates run.





 3  These New Books Must Have Distinct Tones 
Ultimate Variety
        

Each announced new Ultimate title so far promises something very different in terms of tone, from the family drama of Ultimate Spider-Man to the horror that Peach Momoko demonstrates in the very first preview pages for her Ultimate X-Men. Even Ultimate Invasion and Ultimate Universe #1 feel very different despite both being written by Jonathan Hickman, with Universe #1 being much more typically superheroic than the sci-fi politicking of Ultimate Invasion. These books are clearly each their own thing, and these differences should set them apart, giving readers a wide variety to choose from, even as they crossover or reference each other.





 2  The tUniverse Must Be A Reflection Of Now 
Ultimate Relevance
        

The core conceit of the original Ultimate Universe was that it was contemporary, with stories happening in a recognizable and relevant modern day. This new universe needs to be able to the same role, a fact which architect Jonathan Hickman has talked about himself. Ultimate Invasion already has thematic parallels to the real world, with Howard Stark lamenting how it’s easier to ignore the world’s problems than actually do something about them, an all-too-familiar sentiment. It’s these sorts of ideas that should inform the modernity of this new Ultimate Universe, real thematic and emotional connections instead of just references to modern things readers might recognize.





 1  This Ultimate Universe Must Be Something New 
Ultimate Opportunity


 







Many readers were surprised by Ultimate Invasion, which didn’t feel like the Ultimate Universe they might have been expecting. While this new universe bears both design similarities to Bryan Hitch’s era-defining work on the original Ultimate Universe, as well as similarities to Jonathan Hickman’s work on earlier Ultimate stories, it still feels very, very different. This difference should be carried throughout the line. It would be counterintuitive to make a new contemporary universe, if it were to feel exactly the same as what Marvel did two decades ago. For the new Ultimate Universe to feel relevant, to distinguish itself from mainstream Marvel, it has to be something new.
