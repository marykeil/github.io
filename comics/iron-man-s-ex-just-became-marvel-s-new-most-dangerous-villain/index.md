## Literature Review

As Marvel&#39;s Gang War begins, a surprising face reveals that they&#39;ve been pulling everyone&#39;s strings all along, and they&#39;re ready to take over.




Warning: Spoilers for The Amazing Spider-Man: Gang War First Strike #1!Ladies&#39; man Iron Man has had his share of bad romance in his 60-year history, but one of his old flames is about to burn New York to the ground. She&#39;s gone by many names in her life, but some know her as Ms. Frost - and no, it&#39;s not Tony&#39;s current mutant wife. This ex rules the mafia with an iron fist and a gold mask: Madame Masque.




Madame Masque was seemingly killed in The Amazing Spider-Man #31 by Zeb Wells, John Romita Jr., Emilio Laiso and Ze Carlos, at the crashed wedding of Janice Lincoln, the daughter of another crime boss, Tombstone. An assassin sends Tombstone into a coma, and with two bosses down, Kingpin Wilson Fisk in jail, and masked heroes banned, the crime families of New York are ready to tear the city apart. Hammerhead, who takes out Madame Masque with a car bomb, and has Janice&#39;s fiancÃ© Randy Robertson shot, sees himself sitting pretty atop New York&#39;s underworld, and looks to gain everything once the other families take each other out. He tells all of his plans to the unnamed woman he brings as a date to the wedding, forgetting that all&#39;s fair in love and war. But in The Amazing Spider-Man: Gang War First Strike #1, written by Zeb Wells with Cody Ziglar and art by Joey Vasquez with Julian Shaw, it&#39;s revealed this woman is the very much alive Madame Masque.

         




Hammerhead is playing chess with the mob families of New York, but never considers that Madame Masque is doing the same - and using him as just a pawn.


 Madame Masque is the Real Catalyst to Spider-Man&#39;s Gang War 
          

Tombstone, fearing betrayal if all of his fellow bosses aren&#39;t present at his daughter&#39;s wedding, seals his own fate. Madame Masque is in attendance, but her disguises work best when she takes her mask off. In The Amazing Spider-Man: Gang War First Strike #1, she explains to Janice how she&#39;s still alive. She hired a patsy to wear her mask at the wedding, while the actual Madame Masque cozied up to Hammerhead, playing the role of a sexy mafia moll. She might not have known Hammerhead would try to take her out with a car bomb at the wedding, but she correctly suspected that something would go down.




Now, Big M is believed to be dead, putting her right where she wants to be to manipulate the crime families. She&#39;s the person who hired Shotgun, the assassin who put Tombstone into his coma, and she kills Hammerhead by beating him to death with an adamantium femur. The mob bosses, already discontent with each other, are itching to go to war; she&#39;s lit the spark to the powder keg by playing up their fear and suspicions. As she brags to Janice, Madame Masque says she&#39;ll give the families so much war, &#34;that they won&#39;t even notice when I start to take.&#34; A master manipulator, she knows she doesn&#39;t have to take out all the bosses to take over their territories; she just has to get the rest started to take out each other.



 Marvel&#39;s Gang War Will Transform New York City 


          



New York is already having a tough time in the Marvel Universe: Limbo has set up an embassy, Rek-Rap was gleefully causing chaos, and superheroes have been outlawed to the point that a cop threatens to shoot Mayor Luke Cage for even thinking of chasing a suspect. Marvel&#39;s Gang War event promises to shake up the New York criminal landscape for its heroes. Spider-Man needs all the allies he can get, and he ends this issue by promising to build his own team for this war. No one can say how it will turn out once the dust settles, but Iron Man&#39;s ex Madame Masque might have the best odds.
