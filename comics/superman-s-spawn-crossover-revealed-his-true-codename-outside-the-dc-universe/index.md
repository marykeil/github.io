## Literature Review

Superman had an infamous &#34;crossover&#34; with Spawn, one that revealed his true codename outside of the DC Universe.




Superman’s crossover with Spawn revealed the Man of Steel’s codename outside the DC Universe. Superman has crossed over with a number of non-DC characters throughout his 85-year history, but one of his most memorable, of sorts, was in 1993’s Spawn #10. In this story, Superman gets an intriguing new nickname, one that shows just how important he is, not only in the DC Universe, but in comics as a whole.




In the story “Crossing Over,” written by Dave Sim and drawn by Todd McFarlane, in Spawn #10, the titular hero meets Cerebus the Aardvark, and the two embark on a trippy, meta-textual journey through comics&#39; history. The story discusses the issue of creator’s rights, one of the big debates of its day. In one memorable scene, Spawn “meets” Superman. He is never identified as such, and indeed his trademark “S”-shield and red and blue outfit are obscured in the shadows to avoid trademark infringement. Interestingly enough, Spawn refers to Superman as “He-Who-Came-First.”

          

This Superman pastiche then gives Spawn the powers he needs to escape the limbo he is stuck in.


 An Iconic Indie Creator Nailed Superman&#39;s Role 
          




Spawn #10 is one of the most infamous issues of the book’s 30-plus year run. Todd McFarlane, realizing he was in over his head a little with running his own book and studio, brought in acclaimed creators to write for Spawn. He managed to enlist some heavy hitters, including Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman and Dave Sim, creator of Cerebus the Aardvark. Sim, an important figure in the indie comics scene of the 1980s and 1990s, crafted a surreal story addressing the injustices of the comics&#39; industry, including the shoddy treatment creators received at the hands of the “Big Two.”


 

Superman’s “appearance” in Spawn #10 serves two purposes. First, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were poster children for creators rights, and Superman’s appearance is an acknowledgement of this. Second, it calls to attention the role Superman plays in both the DC Universe and the industry as a whole. Superman’s appearance in 1938’s Action Comics #1 kicked off the superhero craze that would help the comics&#39; industry flourish in the late 1930s/early 1940s. By the Golden Age’s peak, there were hundreds of characters from dozens of publishers. Superman started a trend, one that is still going to this day and has made the leap to other media as well.

 Superman Holds It all Together 
          

DC Comics has played around with the idea of Superman as the glue that holds their universe together, such as in 2005’s Infinite Crisis, but here Dave Sim and Todd McFarlane extend it to the entire comics&#39; industry. By referring to him as “He-Who-Came-First,” they acknowledge that Superman is the reason they are all there, and have careers in the industry in the first place. So much of the modern American comics scene can trace their roots back to Superman, and this got a shout-out in his crossover with Spawn.
