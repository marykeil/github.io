## Literature Review

Daredevil has teamed up with countless heroes across the Marvel Universe, but the most surprising team-up was with Marvel&#39;s version of Batman.




Being a street-level hero like Daredevil often leads to tons of team-ups with other characters. It&#39;s not unusual to see Daredevil teaming up with Luke Cage or Spider-Man, but his strangest team-up was with Marvel&#39;s very own version of Batman: the Shroud. When trying to track down the Owl, Daredevil has to team up with a shadowy vigilante who is out to avenge the death of his parents.




Daredevil&#39;s darkest team-up takes place in Daredevil #3 by Mark Waid, Chris Samnee, Javier Rodriguez, and Joe Caramagna. While trying to take down the criminal known as the Owl, Daredevil and the Shroud team up. Their relationship started off rocky at first, with the Shroud intending to defeat Daredevil as a &#34;resume-builder&#34; to get him an audience with Owl.

          

Daredevil was able to convince the Shroud that working together to take the Owl down was a much smarter plan. This led to Daredevil and Marvel&#39;s very own Batman teaming up to bring down a major criminal in San Francisco. Along the way, Daredevil learns that the Shroud has also lost the use of eyes, and his vision isn&#39;t dissimilar to Daredevil&#39;s radar sense.

                  Batman&#39;s New Gadget Finally Makes Him Daredevil&#39;s Equal   Unlike Matt Murdock, Batman has always been just a normal man. But, thanks to his brand-new gadget, Batman can finally match Daredevil&#39;s powers.   





 The Shroud&#39;s Backstory Takes Inspiration from Batman 
          

Batman is one of DC&#39;s greatest heroes, and plenty of heroes have been based on him to try and capitalize on his success. Batman&#39;s backstory is a classic origin of a young boy who had everything in the world suddenly ripped away from him. Bruce Wayne was the child of two of the richest people in Gotham, and unfortunately, his parents were killed by a criminal one fateful night after leaving the Monarch Theatre. The death of Bruce Wayne&#39;s parents put Batman on a course to fight crime no matter where he finds it. He traveled the world to learn everything he could and eventually returned to Gotham. Batman&#39;s backstory is remarkably similar to Marvel&#39;s Shroud — except for one important detail.

Batman is an absurdly effective vigilante, one of the best in superhero comics, but he isn&#39;t superhuman. As amazing as Batman is, he doesn&#39;t have powers. The Shroud&#39;s trip around the world to learn how to fight crime resulted in him meeting with a cult who branded him. This caused him to lose his sight, but he gained a similar Radar Sense to Daredevil&#39;s. This allows him to see through darkness and navigate the world much the same way Daredevil does. Not only does he see with his own form of Radar Sense, but he&#39;s also able to control darkness, either teleporting through it or commanding it to attack his enemies.






 The Shroud&#39;s Vision Powers Are Similar to Daredevil&#39;s 
          

Daredevil has teamed up with countless characters over the years, even teaming up with DC&#39;s Batman on several occasions. But when he moved to San Francisco, he never expected to find an off-and-on again ally in Marvel&#39;s very own version of Batman — the Shroud. The Shroud is a brutal loner who fights crime in the name of his dead parents, and he literally commands the darkness while he does it. While their partnership wasn&#39;t long-lived, there&#39;s no doubt that Daredevil won&#39;t forget the time he teamed up with Marvel&#39;s version of Batman.

Daredevil #3 is available now from Marvel Comics!
