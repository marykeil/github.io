# Charlie Brown Art Fixes How Every Movie Misunderstands His Design


## SUMMARY 



  Charlie Brown&#39;s iconic (and puzzling) hairstyle finally makes sense, thanks to a charming piece of fan art showing a more accurate depiction.   The original Peanuts strips and Peanuts Movie misinterpret Charlie&#39;s hair as one long strand, leading to assumptions about him being bald.   Jokeb0i&#39;s fan art clarifies Charlie&#39;s hair, giving him a more average haircut (while still maintaining his familiar and beloved appearance).

## Literature Review

Charlie Brownâ€™s luck is turning around, as one amazing piece of fan art finally gives him a haircut that explains how the character should look.




After Charlie Brown has stumped the world for decades, one piece of inspired fan art has done the impossible, and finally made sense of the Peanuts star&#39;s iconic and baffling, one-stranded hairstyle.




Charles Schulz&#39;s Peanuts stars a collection of colorful characters, and aside from Snoopy, is best known for its central character, Charlie Brown, a beleaguered boy who battles daily misfortunes, misunderstanding from his peers, and an utter lack of self-confidence. Charlie Brown is known for a lot of things: his crush on the Little Red-Haired Girl, his battles with the Kite-Eating Tree, and his gullibility when it comes to thinking Lucy won&#39;t pull the football away when he goes to kick it. But the most unfortunate thing Charlie Brown is known for is his unique and inexplicable haircut. Until now.


 

While Brown&#39;s hair has been the subject of (justified) debate, one amazing piece of fan art has settled how the character&#39;s hair should actually look. On Twitter, artist @Jokeb0i responded to a post questioning what Charlie Brown&#39;s hair is supposed to actually look like. The original question notes even The Peanuts Movie interpreted the hair on Charlie&#39;s forehead being one long strand. Jokeb0i replied with an image showing how they interpret the haircut, including a profile look.





 Charlie Brown Fan Art Shows How His Hair Should Look 
          

Rather than one long strand of hair, Jokeb0i&#39;s Charlie has a high and tight cut with a small tuft of hair right on his forehead. From the front, he looks like the Charlie Brown everyone knows and loves. But from the side, Charlie has a haircut that doesn&#39;t look that unusual.

While Peanuts&#39; creator Charles Schulz has gone on record that Charlie Brown&#39;s hair is meant to be very light-colored, it hasn&#39;t stopped the character from being described as bald in the past few decades by ignorant fans. Admittedly, it&#39;s hard to tell how Brown&#39;s hair is supposed to look, especially in strips that don&#39;t have the privilege of being in color. The Peanuts Movie also didn&#39;t do the poor boy any favors by interpreting the hair on his forehead as one wispy strand.






 Charlie Brown Isn&#39;t Bald, He Just Has... Very Short Hair 
          

The simple style of Peanuts might be iconic, but less complex designs can lose things in the translation. At a glance, it really does look like Charlie Brown is bald save for one squiggly strand of hair (even the character designers of The Peanuts Movie thought so). But Jokeb0i&#39;s design provides a more accurate depiction of what Charlie is meant to look like according to Charles Schulz. It keeps the core of what Charlie Brown looks like but gives it more detail to make it seem like he has an average haircut.

While the original Peanuts strips don&#39;t do him any favors, Charlie Brown comes out looking pretty good in Jokeb0i&#39;s fan art.
