## Literature Review

Jason Todd might be the Robin who had the worst fate possible, but he’s not the only one of Batman’s partners who met an extremely tragic fate.




Few comic book heroes met as grizzly an end as Jason Todd did in his final days as Robin. During the iconic “Death in the Family” storyline, Jason was beaten by the Joker with a crowbar and then trapped in an exploding building. The event shook the Bat-Family for years and to this day remains one of the most infamous killings in comics. However, while Jason Todd’s fate was undoubtedly horrific, it’s not the only awful thing to happen to one of Batman’s partners. Across the DC multiverse, there are plenty of dark fates for people who served in the Robin role.









 








 10  Dick Grayson&#39;s Identity Was Revealed Before Being &#39;Killed&#39; 
Forever Evil #1, Geoff Johns, David Finch
        

The DC Universe came under fire when the Earth was invaded by the Crime Syndicate, who wasted no time in leading a hostile takeover. The Syndicate took Nightwing hostage and as a show of their power, unmasked Nightwing in front of the entire world. While imprisoned by the Syndicate, Nightwing was secured to a bomb that couldn’t be disarmed as long as Dick was alive. Lex Luthor killed and revived Nightwing to free him, but the damage had been done. With his identity exposed, Nightwing abandoned his costumed life and began a short-term career with the secret intelligence network Spyral.





 9  Batman Completely Gave Up on His First Robin

In Robins, the five people who served as Batman’s sidekicks discover that before any of them served in the role, Batman had another partner. Anita Jean was the adopted daughter of Cormac Dodge, the Escape Artist. Batman convinced Anita to work with him in exchange for taking Dodge down. However, the young girl killed Dodge after he threatened to expose Batman’s identity. Batman rejected Anita and refused to work with her, warping the girl’s mind. Anita faked her death and later returned as the evil Jenny Wren, ready to break Batman and everyone he deemed worthy of working with him.





 8  Dick Grayson Became A Vampire King 
DC vs. Vampires, James Tynion IV, Matthew Rosenberg, Otto Schmidt
        

The DC Universe fell to a wave of vampirism in DC vs. Vampires and those who weren’t turned were all wondering how the undead were spreading so fast. It turned out that Nightwing was the first hero to become infected and was secretly leading the vampire’s crusade against the world. Tie-in material elaborated on Dick’s transformation, which revealed he was converted to vampirism by a vampire named Pandora to destroy the vampire queen. Nightwing assumed control of the undead legion and turned on his friends and allies. He even personally took Batman out of the picture by punching him through the chest.





 7  Batman Who Laughs Army of Jokerized Robins 
The Batman Who Laughs #1, James Tynion IV, Riley Rossmo
        

On the worst world in the Dark Multiverse, the Joker tried driving Batman insane by recreating the Wayne murders. The villain killed numerous parents and infected their children with Joker venom. Enraged, Batman snapped Joker’s neck, killing him, only to be poisoned by Joker Venom. This Earth’s Bruce Wayne became the Batman Who Laughs and after he fully transformed into his worst self, he took the Jokerized children and turned them into his Robins. All of them were mindless and feral, save for his Damian, who willingly became the Batman Who Laughs’ mad Boy Wonder.





 6  Several Robins Became Zombies Before Dying 
DCeased #1, Tom Taylor, James Harren, Trevor Hairsine
        

In DCeased, the Anti-Life Equation turned the world upside down by turning heroes and foes alike into zombies. One of the first few to turn was several members of the Bat-Family, namely Dick and Tim. The two heroes attacked Batman and managed to infect him. Though not shown, Nightwing and Robin were put down by Batman in order to protect the uninfected Alfred. Unfortunately, Alfred was charged with the task of killing Batman when the Anti-Life virus claimed him. In one fell swoop, several Bat-Family members met their grizzly ends.





 5  Dinesh Babar&#39;s Mind Was Fractured to Believe He Was Damian Wayne 
Nightwing #18, Tim Seeley, Javi Fernandez, Minkyu Jung
        

Dinesh Babar was never an official Robin, but being the Boy Wonder was all the child remembered after Professor Pyg surgically altered him and gave him Damian Wayne’s memories. Despite not being a ‘real’ Robin, he tried helping Damian and Dick take down the man who corrupted him. Unfortunately, Dinesh was killed by Deathwing, one of Professor Pyg’s Dollotrons who erroneously believed it was the real Nightwing. While Dick and Damian brought Pyg to justice, this other Robin life ended before he ever really had a chance to live.





 4  Jason Todd&#39;s Other Death Was Just as Violent 
The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade #1, Frank Miller, Brian Azzarello, John Romita, Jr., Peter Steigerwald
        

Interestingly enough, before Jason Todd was killed in the Prime DC Universe, he was killed in another universe a few years earlier. The Dark Knight Returns mentions that Jason was Batman’s last Robin before Bruce retired. The circumstances behind Jason’s death weren’t elaborated on until The Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade #1. Jason went out one night to prove that he had what it took to replace Batman by finding a recently escaped Joker. Unfortunately, Jason Todd was overwhelmed and beaten to death by the Joker’s henchmen. It’s not as famous as “Death in the Family”, but it&#39;s arguably just as brutal.





 3  Damian Wayne Was Murdered by His Own Clone 
Batman Incorporated #8, Grant Morrison, Chris Burnham


 







When Damian Wayne chose to side with his father, Talia al Ghul didn’t take it well. Using advanced technology she cloned and artificially aged a copy called the Heretic to serve as her elite attack dog. In a dramatic battle against Talia’s terrorist organization Leviathan, Damian fought the Heretic head-on. But Damian&#39;s clone-brother was much too powerful for the Boy Wonder and he stabbed Robin in the gut with a sword. Though Batman managed to defeat the Heretic, he was too late to save his son, who succumbed to his injuries. Damian did come back to life, but it was a harrowing experience all the same.





 2  Stephanie Brown Got Tortured While Trying to Prove Herself 
Batman #633, Bill Willingham, Kinsun Loh
        

Stephanie Brown had the shortest tenure of any Robin and her career ended as horrifically as one could imagine. Steph came in to replace Tim Drake, who had been benched. Batman agreed to take on Stephanie as his new sidekick, but he held her to a much higher standard than his previous Robins. Steph was desperate to prove she was up to the task and went after Black Mask to show she had what it took. Unfortunately, Stephanie Brown only got herself tortured. Stephanie faked her death and got away to recover, but the pain she endured from Black Mask was all too real.





 1  Joker Executed Robin in Front of the World 
JLA: The Nail #1, Alan Davis


 







As violent as Jason Todd’s death was, it’s nothing compared to what happened to Robin and Batgirl in JLA: The Nail. In this world, there was never a Superman and the world is much darker for it. Nothing showed how bleak this reality was more than the moment when Joker leads an outbreak at Arkham Asylum. Using a pair of powerful gauntlets, Joker traps Batman and forces him to watch as Joker executes Robin and Batgirl on live television. The event breaks Bruce completely, causing him to kill the Joker and nearly destroy his and the Justice League’s image.
There’s no doubt that Jason Todd’s fate is one of the worst in the history of comics. But these 10 outcomes for the various Robins are just bad, if not worse, than Jason&#39;s ultimate fate.
