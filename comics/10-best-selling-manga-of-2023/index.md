4.9 million copies in circulation
        

Takehiko Inoue&#39;s hit manga ended many years ago, but it seems that it is still extremely popular.

This exhilarating series is a pioneer in the genre, has inspired many sports series, and is a must-read for all fans of the medium.Buy On Viz

The manga received more than 5 million new sales, all thanks to the incredible adaptation that has been confirmed for a second season.

The second season of the anime is also currently airing, but the manga sales would still be high even without it.

 1  Blue Lock By Muneyuki Kaneshiro &amp; Yusuke Nomura 
10.5 million copies
        

It&#39;s almost unheard of for a non-Shueisha manga to be the overall top-selling manga in a year, but Blue Lock has defied expectations. The last time a sports manga was best-selling was Slam Dunk in 1996. Blue Lock has always been a well-known manga, but there are two main factors for the surge in mainstream popularity. The first is obvious: the anime adaptation was super successful, leading to a movie and a second season announcement immediately after. The timing of the anime, though, made a world of difference. The anime aired during the World Cup, which is the entire premise of the manga. In addition to the fact that the author designed the Japanese national team&#39;s jersey, Blue Lock gained a lot of new attention.
Blue Lock is about a project of the same name where a coach named Ego Jinpachi recruits 300 football players, specifically strikers that he sees potential in and trains them to their limits. There are many stages in the project, all leading up to one player surviving and helping the Japanese national team to win a World Cup after years of humiliation on the global stage.
