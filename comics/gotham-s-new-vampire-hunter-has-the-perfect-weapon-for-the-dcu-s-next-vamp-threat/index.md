Santa&#39;s journey began as a valiant member of the Wild Hunt, a distinguished group dedicated to capturing and slaying beasts across the vast expanse of the multiverse. However, during one of Santa&#39;s missions, his path back home was destroyed, stranding him on Earth. Undeterred, he embraced his new mission on Earth, defending the innocent and confronting formidable foes like the Draug, whom he once successfully vanquished in Northern Europe.

However, the prowess of vampire slayers doesn&#39;t end with Santa alone; his loyal reindeer companion, Prancer, emerges as a formidable force against the undead. Prancer, with his sturdy antlers, transforms into a potent weapon capable of impaling vampires with remarkable precision. In the comic, Santa notes that Prancer&#39;s antlers function as traditional wooden stakes against vampires, making him an ideal mount and weapon in the battle against the Draug. As the series unfolds, the prospect of more extraordinary vampire-slaying escapades awaits Prancer alongside Santa, promising readers a riveting and action-packed continuation of this thrilling and holiday-themed narrative.
