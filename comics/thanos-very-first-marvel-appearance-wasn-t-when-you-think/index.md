# Thanos  Very First Marvel Appearance Wasn t When You Think


## SUMMARY 



  Thanos&#39; real first appearance in Marvel Comics was in Captain Marvel #26, not Iron Man #55.   Iron Man&#39;s encounter with a robot duplicate of Thanos actually led to a new storyline in the comic Thanos: Death Notes #1.   The mislead of Thanos&#39; debut added an interesting twist to his origin story and posed a personal threat to Tony Stark.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s widely believed that Thanos made his Marvel Comics debut in an Iron Man comic, but that may not actually be the case (and that&#39;s a good thing). 




Thanos is perhaps the most iconic Avengers villain in Marvel Comics, not just because of his role as the MCU’s ‘big bad’ through Phases 1-3, but because of how impactful he’s been in the original comic books themselves, including and especially the events surrounding his debut. While most fans know exactly how and when Thanos was introduced in Marvel Comics, they’d probably be shocked to hear that - more than likely - they are mistaken as to when his real first appearance actually was (hint: it wasn’t in Iron Man).




The ‘first appearance’ of Thanos fans will likely point to was in Iron Man #55 by Jim Starlin and Mike Friedrich. In that issue, Iron Man was kidnapped by Thanos’ minions and brought to Titan, where Thanos was to deal with the founding Avenger. Meanwhile, Drax the Destroyer was given life by Kronos and was immediately sent to kill Thanos and save Iron Man in the process.

         

When it comes time for the final showdown, Iron Man punches Thanos’ head, which immediately explodes into pieces of robotic machinery and electrical circuitry. Thanos was a robot all along, a perfect copy of the original Mad Titan who hadn’t even bothered to show his face - something that wouldn’t officially happen until he appeared in an issue of Captain Marvel.




                  Thanos&#39; Strongest Enemy Beat Hulk, Juggernaut &amp; the Thing Without Breaking a Sweat   Thanos has a plethora of enemies, but none of them can match this one, especially after they beat Hulk, Juggernaut, and the Thing like it was nothing.   


 Thanos Didn’t Debut In An Iron Man Comic, But A Captain Marvel Comic 
          

In Captain Marvel #26 by Jim Starlin and Mike Friedrich, Captain Marvel is hunting down the Super-Skrull, as well as all those who helped him in his villainous plot from the previous issue. As it turned out, it was Thanos who was behind it all, as he and his gang of the toughest alien pirates in the galaxy wanted to capture Captain Marvel.

When Captain Marvel (and the Thing, who was also chasing Super-Skrull at the time) uncovered Thanos’ hideout and confronted the puppeteering villain, that was the first official time Marvel Comics fans ever saw Thanos in-person, meaning this issue was his actual debut, not Iron Man #55.






 Thanos’ Debut Mislead Actually Made His Origin Story More Interesting 
          

While fans might be disappointed to learn that Iron Man didn’t meet Thanos for the first time, but instead a robot duplicate, they really shouldn’t be. In fact, that seemingly innocuous aspect of that issue continued into an entire new story in the more recent comic Thanos: Death Notes #1. Death Notes reveals that Iron Man actually kept the Thanos robot with the intention of melting it down. However, the Thanos robot tells Tony that if it was totally destroyed, that would trigger a future where Thanos would rule all of time. So, Iron Man opted to play it safe and keep the robot functional (though disassembled), which is something he kept from the rest of the Avengers for years.

The Thanos who fans thought they were introduced to in Iron Man #55 not only turned out to be a robot, but one that posed its own threat to the Marvel Universe, including and especially Tony Stark on a personal level. So, while his very first appearance may not have been when fans thought it was, it&#39;s fair to say that this mislead actually enhanced Thanos’ origin story.
