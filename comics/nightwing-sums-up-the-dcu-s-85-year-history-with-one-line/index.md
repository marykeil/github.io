## Literature Review

For all of its hijinks and adventures, family is the core theme of the modern DCU, and no one emulates that better than Nightwing, DC&#39;s &#34;first son.&#34;





Summary

  Nightwing exemplifies the theme of found family in the DC Universe through his relationships with Batman, the Titans, and the Bat-Family.   The DC Universe prioritizes family dynamics, with characters like Superman, the Flash, Green Arrow, Aquaman, and the Green Lantern Corps showcasing the concept of found family.   The concept of found family is integral to DC&#39;s storytelling, with characters like Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman embodying the idea of forming bonds beyond blood relations.  







The subject of family has become a major recurring theme during Nightwing&#39;s quest to help his old flame, Beatrice Blüd. Reassuring her during a moment of doubt, Nightwing delivers a poignant speech that not only sums up his own character but can also be seen as describing the entire thesis of the modern DC Universe, even after 85 years of history.

In Nightwing #109 by Tom Taylor and Stephen Byrne, Nightwing and Bea plan their assault on Dirk Blüd, who has declared Bea&#39;s claim to the captaincy as illegitimate and so has stolen her ship and crew. When Bea begins to doubt herself as Captain Ruben Blüd&#39;s rightful heir, Nightwing provides a blistering retort in her defense.



          

As Nightwing says, &#34;Dirk&#39;s not Ruben&#39;s son. He&#39;s just some violent @#$% who happens to be related to him,” following with “You’re the one Ruben chose…the one he loved.&#34; Citing his own experiences, Nightwing is quick to reassure Beatrice that it takes more than sharing a bloodline to make someone family.




                  Wonder Woman, Power Girl, Poison Ivy: DC&#39;s Iconic Women Reshaped the DC Universe in 2023   Between a slew of new titles and major status quo changes, 2023 was a banner year for DC&#39;s iconic women, including Wonder Woman, Lois Lane, and more.   


 Nightwing Is the Perfect Conduit for DC&#39;s Found Family Themes 
          

If there is anyone in the DC Universe qualified to speak about found family, it&#39;s Nightwing. From being raised by Batman, to finding his own peers in the Titans, to returning as the &#34;big brother&#34; of the Bat-Family, every stage of Nightwing&#39;s life affirms that family are the people who support you and raise you up, regardless of blood relations. Although Nightwing may be its most emblematic member, the entire Bat-Family speaks to this lesson, being composed of like-minded orphans (Dick Grayson and Jason Todd), vigilantes (Bluebird and Batwoman), former protégés of super-villains (Stephanie Brown, Cassandra Cain, and Damian Wayne), and the like who have all found common ground with one another.




The family dynamics are so clear and present that they inspired the webcomic Wayne Family Adventures, whose wholesome take on the Bat-Family&#39;s family dynamics catapulted the series to immediate success. But it&#39;s not just the Bat-Family, either: in contemporary DC comics, just about every member of the Justice League now boasts an extensive family tree of sidekicks, misfits, and outcasts. From Superman to Aquaman, the DC Universe has long prioritized family dynamics, and that&#39;s more true now than ever — but the history behind this trend is just as important.



 Superman and the Flash Subvert the Classic &#34;Nuclear Family&#34; 
         

While Superman’s family more closely resembles the traditional Western nuclear family — at least when compared to Batman’s Gotham crew — it’s still a found family at its core. While Clark, Lois, and their son Jon may be the family&#39;s center, Kara Zor-El (Supergirl) and Paige Stetler (Power Girl) are still refugees from different Kryptons; meanwhile, Conner Kent and Kenan Kong, both the progeny of scientific experimentation, have found a welcome home in the House of El as Superboy and the Super-Man of China, respectively. The newest members of the family – super twins Osul-Ra and Otho-Ra – are another pair of refugees, rescued from Mongul’s Warworld.






To see the Superman family dynamics at play, check out Phillip Kennedy Johnson, Rafa Sandoval, Matt Herms, and Dave Sharpe&#39;s Action Comics #1051 and onward.




The Flash’s family is simultaneously the most domestic and one of the most diverse in all of DC. United by their shared link to the Speed Force, there is once again a nuclear family core – Wally West, Linda Park, and their twins Jai and Irey – but now with a unique web of allies, which includes Kid Flash Wallace West, legacy heroes like Barry Allen, Jay Garrick, Max Mercury, and Johnny and Jesse Quick, as well time-displaced friends Impulse and Gold Beetle. In this case, they form a family of students and mentors, with the older generation of Speedsters doing their best to help and guide the younger; if you’re a Flash, then you are family.



This family connection is central to The Flash: One-Minute War arc (The Flash #790 - #796), in which four generations of speedsters act as one to protect Earth from invading forces from outside time itself.









 Green Arrow, Aquaman, and Green Lantern Unite Houses of Misfits 
         

By contrast, if there were ever a family of misfits to rival Batman’s, it would be Green Arrow&#39;s. Roy Harper is arguably DC’s prodigal son, having returned from both addiction and death, while Connor Hawke has similarly struggled to earn his father’s approval. 2023&#39;s Green Arrow series by Joshua Williamson, Sean Izaakse, and Romulo Fajardo, Jr., perfectly codifies the interpersonal struggles between family members as Black Canary, Roy, Connor, and Roy&#39;s once-missing daughter Lian search for the missing Oliver Queen. By staying together, they are able to find redemption in one another despite the traumas of the past. Regardless of how they break apart, the Green Arrow family will always find their way back to one another.




Even the much-maligned Aquaman has his own found family. Not only is his marriage to Mera a union of two warring houses, both of his mentees and former Aqualads — Garth and Jackson Hyde — are functionally adopted, with Jackson’s relationship with Aquaman providing an uneasy bridge between the king of the sea and his nemesis (and Jackson’s birth father), Black Manta. Despite complications from Atlantean politics that are downright Shakespearean in scope, Aquaman’s family transcends both lineage and paternity, especially as they all work to take care of Arthur and Mera&#39;s baby daughter, Andy.



For more about the Aquaman Family legacy, see Chuck Brown, Brandon Thomas, and Sami Basri&#39;s miniseries Aquamen.




Then there is Earth&#39;s many Green Lanterns, who, despite lacking even traditional families, have arguably the greatest found family of all: the entirety of the Green Lantern Corps. While the rest of the Lanterns aren’t as close as the Flash Family, they are a family united by a shared purpose – often despite the orders of their superiors. Hal Jordan, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, Simon Baz, Jessica Cruz, Jo Mullein, and countless others are comrades-in-arms from across the galaxy who have all found solace and purpose alongside one another.






 The Beloved &#34;Found Family&#34; Trope Is Integral to DC&#39;s Storytelling 
         

Fans might wonder why DC stories focus so strongly on family — and found family in particular. Partly, it is the natural consequence of decades of storytelling. In a medium like comics where new characters are constantly introduced, the ones who survive and are liked by readers will continue to show up and be part of the lives of their respective franchises. One of the greatest criticisms of 2011’s New 52 reboot was the number of popular characters who were pruned from canon for the sake of slimming down DC’s profile.

Given how unpopular that era was among fans, trimming characters is a mistake that DC is unlikely to repeat, and the publisher has since begun returning those characters to continuity. But it bears keeping in mind that DC has had the found family narrative as a core part of its identity from the very beginning. Superman’s tale is arguably the greatest story of found family in all of comic-book history: an orphan who is not only adopted and raised as the Kents&#39; own child, but who later grows to see the entire planet and population of Earth as his own kin.




For her part, Wonder Woman leaves an island paradise to form bonds of friendship and family among the mortal world. Even Batman’s history has long been &#34;about&#34; found family, with Alfred’s rearing of young Bruce sowing the seeds for Bruce’s willingness to take in the multitudes of Robins and Batgirls that have become the Wayne family legacy — including Dick Grayson, the original Robin and Batman&#39;s first sidekick. As DC&#39;s &#34;first son,&#34; Dick Grayson in all his heroic iterations will always represent the idea of legacy more than any other character.



 Nightwing Embodies the Entire DC Family 
          

In fact, no character is more emblematic of the entire modern DC Universe than Nightwing, and Nightwing is inseparable from the concept of found family. It’s no surprise, then, that DC has shaped itself around his image, especially in recent years: from the Titans to the Justice League, the DCU has become a place where countless families of heroes open their arms to those in need. Family is about both love and choice; that is the thesis of the entire 85-year history of the DC Universe, and no one knows it better than Nightwing.
