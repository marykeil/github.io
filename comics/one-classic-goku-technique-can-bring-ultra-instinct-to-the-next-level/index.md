Summary

  Goku combines Instant Transmission with Ultra Instinct to stay out of his opponent&#39;s line of sight and render her time magic useless.   Instant Transmission with Ultra Instinct is a brilliant tactic that can surprise godly opponents and requires them to access their own Ultra Instinct to keep up.   Constant movement through Instant Transmission is beneficial in a fight and could even be used to dodge the destruction energy of Destroyer gods.  







In the world of Dragon Ball, there are few heights known to be greater than Ultra Instinct, but Goku can easily take this divine form to the next level by employing one of his old favorite techniques: Instant Transmission. Goku proved the viability of this combo by easily avoiding the attacks of a divine being, showing how the two skills can synergize exceedingly well.

In Super Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultra God Mission, many alternate timelines have been competing in the so-called &#34;Super Spacetime Tournament,&#34; which was designed by the former Supreme Kai of Time in order to facilitate the erasure of losing timelines. Goku&#39;s team is winning, but in chapter 10, Goku goes to see the former Supreme Kai of Time, Aeos, in order to convince her not to destroy the other timelines. When she refuses, he challenges her to a fight, saying the winner will decide.

          




He launches a Kamehameha, but is shocked to find it vanishes after Aeos uses her magic. When she tries to use it on him directly, however, it&#39;s Aeos who&#39;s surprised by what happens.


 Goku&#39;s Instant Transmission is Perfect for Ultra Instinct&#39;s Incredible Reflexes 
          

Goku entered Ultra Instinct after losing the Kamehameha, and when she turned her attention to freeze him in time, he was able to use Instant Transmission to teleport behind her. By combining the instinctual, reflexive speed of Ultra Instinct with the Instant Transmission technique, Goku is able to stay out of her line of sight, rendering her time magic useless against him. This combo is a brilliant use of the two abilities together, and there&#39;s no reason that this tactic wouldn&#39;t work on just about any other opponent as well. If it can surprise a godly being like the former Supreme Kai of Time, an opponent would need to access their own Ultra Instinct to keep up.




Instant Transmission has always been a somewhat underutilized trick in Goku&#39;s arsenal, even though it&#39;s one of his favorites. One might argue that the hand gesture needed for Instant Transmission takes him out of a fighting stance, but with Ultra Instinct&#39;s reflexes, that disadvantage is easily mitigated. Aeos has to depend on her ability to see the future in order to counter this, which left her otherwise unable to attack, and Goku was still able to fool her by moving sufficiently fast. Goku ultimately wins the fight, stopping short of delivering a final blast that would&#39;ve surely taken the goddess out.

When it comes to battling godly opponents, it seems like Instant Transmission and Ultra Instinct is one combo that just can&#39;t go wrong. Constant movement is a major benefit in a fight, and if that constant movement is instantaneous teleportation, then all the better. This technique might even be useful for taking on Destroyer gods, should that ever become necessary, allowing Goku to dodge their destruction energy with pinpoint precision. Hopefully, future Dragon Ball media will remember this little trick of Goku&#39;s and make Instant Transmission a key part of his Ultra Instinct fighting style.
