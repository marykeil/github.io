## Literature Review

Deadpool&#39;s newest era will see his mutant daughter Ellie Camacho taking a central role, as her and Wade try to evade his new villain, Death Grip.




After the upcoming Fall of the House of X, which will see the X-Men&#39;s Krakoan Era ending, the despicable Deadpool will enter a new era of his own, once again acting as a free agent not tied to a team in an upcoming relaunch of his solo title. Deadpool will feature the beloved Merc With a Mouth fighting for his life against a new villain called Death Grip and will feature his mutant daughter Ellie Camacho in a starring role.




For much of the Krakoan Era Deadpool was trying to get onto the mutant&#39;s X-Force team, and eventually he did, working with the wetwork team on many missions before joining Captain America&#39;s newest iteration of the Unity Squad in the bombastic Uncanny Avengers.

          

Now, Deadpool and his daughter Ellie will embark on a daring father-daughter adventure, in a new Deadpool series from writer Cody Ziglar (Miles Morales: Spider-Man) and artist Rogê Antônio (Carnage, Venom). Marvel&#39;s announcement of the relaunch also revealed a stunning cover for Deadpool #1 by Taurin Clarke, featuring Wade Wilson taking on agents from Hydra, A.I.M., and the Hand.


 Ellie Camacho Will Finally Take Center Stage In A Deadpool Series 
          




Eleanor Camacho debuted in 2013&#39;s Deadpool Vol. #19 as the secret daughter of Wade and Carmelita Camacho, revealed to Deadpool after Carmelita tracked him down, although at first, Wade refused to believe Ellie was his because of how beautiful and innocent she was. Eventually, Carmelita is killed by The Butler, and Ellie is placed with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and Deadpool ally Emily Preston, who has raised Ellie alongside her own family since. Ellie&#39;s introduction into the Deadpool mythos has helped to humanize Wade in a meaningful way, while also giving him inspiration to act as an antihero and protect the future for his daughter whom he loves.

Ellie was last seen in this year&#39;s FCBD: Avengers/X-Men #1 issue, where the Preston family was accosted by Stark Sentinels and Orchis agents because of Ellie&#39;s identity as a mutant. Unfortunately, this plot didn&#39;t go anywhere, with Deadpool joining the Unity Squad to fight Orchis, but not mentioning Ellie during Uncanny Avengers. The upcoming Deadpool series will feature Ellie playing a &#34;pivotal role&#34; in Wade&#39;s newest era, but there are no other details about what part she will play. Ellie could be kidnapped by Deadpool&#39;s mysterious new villain, Death Grip, or she could somehow partner with her father to help take Death Grip down.






 Ellie From The Year 2099 Is A Fierce Fighter 
          

There is also a chance that the Ellie in the upcoming Deadpool may not even be the young Ellie that Deadpool knows and loves, but instead her future self from the world of Marvel 2099. In Deadpool 2099 it is revealed that Ellie&#39;s mutant ability, which has not been shown in current continuity, is immortality, allowing her to return to life only after death, resurrected with her memories but inhabiting her teenaged body from when her powers first manifested. Ellie spent years becoming a fierce fighter so she could rescue her father from his crazed daughter with the demonic Shiklah, Warda Wilson, eventually reuniting with Deadpool and saving him.

It would be really amazing if this 2099 iteration of Ellie traveled back in time to help her father fight Death Grip, but regardless it will be a blast to see Deadpool having more meaningful interactions with his daughter. The writer of Deadpool, Cody Ziglar, says that the series will partly focus on an exploration of Deadpool and his family, so hopefully it will cement Ellie as a more permanent fixture in upcoming Deadpool stories, and also bring back Deadpool&#39;s iconic love interest Valentine Vuong into his life.




Deadpool #1 from Marvel Comics debuts on April 3rd, 2024.
