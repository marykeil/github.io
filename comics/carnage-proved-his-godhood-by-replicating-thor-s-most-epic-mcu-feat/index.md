# Carnage Proved His Godhood By Replicating Thor s Most Epic MCU Feat


## SUMMARY 



  In Carnage #10, the deadly symbiote proved his incredible strength and durability by surviving an event greater amount of cosmic heat than nearly killed Thor in the MCU.   Carnage&#39;s quest to become a god leads him to forge a powerful sword, but he is tricked into being hit by the full force of the forge&#39;s energy...which ultimately proves ineffective against him.   Despite the immense amount of energy unleashed on him, Carnage is saved by the arrival of Jon Shayde, who contains a piece of Carnage symbiote, and is able to escape and launch a counterattack.

## Literature Review

Carnage is one of the more dangerous villains in the Marvel Universe and he just proved how powerful he is by replicating a major MCU Thor feat.




Carnage has proven one of most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe; of the many displays of terrible might that have occured during the symbiote&#39;s quest for godhood, one that stands out is the repetition of one major feat made famous by the MCU&#39;s Thor. The Asgardian proved capable of withstanding the heat of a star in Avengers: Endgame,




and now Carnage has proven capable of doing the same.

Carnage #10 – by Ram V, Francesco Manna, Erick Arciniega, and Joe Sabino – featured Carnage matching this iconic display of strength and durability. On a quest to become a new God-Butcher, the story finds the Carnage symbiote assembling powers from various sources, before traveling to a forge to have a new weapon created.



          

Carnage intends to force Drorin to create Carnage the All-Blood sword, so that he can slaughter the gods. Drorin manipulates Carnage into being hit by the full force of the forge, which Drorin describes as &#34;the heat of a hundred falling stars.&#34; It certainly seems like Carnage is done for, but shockingly, he manages to survive.

                  Carnage&#39;s Grotesque New &#39;Healing Factor&#39; Proves He&#39;s Become a God   Carnage has done a lot of disturbing stuff over the years, but his newest feat not only proves how gross he is, but also the fact he is a god.   





 Carnage Can Withstand The Full Force Of 100 Stars 


          



Carnage is one of the stronger villains in the Marvel Universe, and he&#39;s demonstrated this time and time again by being seemingly unkillable. No matter what Marvel&#39;s heroes throw at Carnage, he always seems to come back stronger than ever. In Carnage #10, one person took their attempt to kill him to the next level. Carnage took his dangerous behavior to the next level when he attempted to forge the All-Blood, a powerful sword that would help him become a God-Butcher. Drorin, the dwarf Carnage captured to forge the All-Blood for him, eventually betrayed him, raining down hundreds of stars on Carnage, in a moment shockingly similar to Thor&#39;s most iconic MCU feat.

This showed Carnage surviving the same conditions that very nearly killed the MCU Thor. When Thor needed to craft the Stormbreaker to fight Thanos, he traveled to a forge just like the one seen in Carnage #10 and had to allow the heat of a star to pass through him. Carnage was tricked into entering the forge, and very nearly died due to the extreme amount of energy that Drorin unleashed on him. Unfortunately, Carnage was able to escape certain death due to the untimely arrival of Jon Shayde, who had a piece of the Carnage symbiote in him. Carnage was able to use this to escape the forge, and immediately launched a counterattack against Drorin.






 If Cosmic Heat Can&#39;t Kill Carnage, What Can? 


          

Carnage has done a lot of absurd things in comics, but surviving the full force of a hundred stars is certainly high up there on his list of achievements, especially since a single star almost killed the MCU&#39;s version of Thor. Carnage wants to become Marvel&#39;s next God, and considering the unbelievable cosmic feats he&#39;s pulled off so far, there&#39;s no doubt that he might actually be able to do it. Carnage has always been absurdly difficult to kill, but how easily he managed to survive something that nearly killed one of Marvel&#39;s most powerful gods further proves how dangerous Carnage is truly becoming.



Carnage #10 is on sale now from Marvel Comics!
