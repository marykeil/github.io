Summary

  Azrael makes a dramatic return to Gotham wearing his Knightfall-era batsuit, bringing chaos to both the Orghams and Gotham City.   As Batman faces public execution, Catwoman and Gordon launch a rescue attempt, but it may fall to Azrael to protect Gotham and don the Batsuit.   Azrael&#39;s reemergence as Batman signals dark times for Gotham, with the city in a particularly dark place and the Orghams threatening to erase Batman from memory.  







With Batman set to face public execution at the hands of the Orghams, a wild card reemerges in Gotham after being gone for thirty years. Azrael finally returns to wearing his Knightfall-era batsuit, promising chaos for the Orghams and Gotham alike.

Detective Comics #1078 by Ram V and Jason Shawn Alexander opens with the Orghams leading Batman to the gallows; simultaneously, Catwoman and Gordon launch their rescue attempt. As the Orghams dispatch some of their forces to deal with Cassandra Cain and Mr. Freeze in the sewers, a truck comes barreling into the assembled blockade before exploding. A moment later, Azrael slashes his way out of the wreckage before the stunned soldier&#39;s eyes.

          

Whether as a distraction or tribute, Azrael appears in his old armored batsuit, which has its origins in the 1990s. Cutting a terrifying figure and brandishing his flaming sword, he tears his way through the Orgham&#39;s forces before squaring off against Gael Tenclaw.




                  Azrael Is Returning to Gotham as DC&#39;s New Batman - Theory Explained   With Batman captured by the Orghams, it may fall to Azrael to don the Batsuit and protect Gotham, but could this time go better than last?   


 Azrael Returns as Batman for the First Time Since Knightfall 


          

Azrael&#39;s claim to the cowl is not unfounded: during 1993-1994&#39;s Knightfall story arc, Azrael took over as Batman after Bane broke Bruce Wayne&#39;s back. Made by Azrael in Batman #500 by Doug Moench, Jim Aparo, Terry Austin, Mike Manley, Adrienne Roy, and Ken Bruzenak, this new batsuit was built to the System&#39;s specifications and designed to take out Bane, utilizing bladed, shuriken-launching gauntlets and a distinctive cape design. While Azrael wore armor similar to his batsuit in Detective Comics #962 by James Tynion IV, Álvaro Martínez Bueno, Raúl Fernández, Brad Anderson, and Sal Cipriano, the mechanized wings and differences in coloration mark that armor as Lucius Fox&#39;s separate creation.




This particular batsuit stands as a symbol of the &#34;grim and gritty&#34; aesthetic of &#39;90s-era comic books, and the fact that it shows up at this moment bears significant weight. Gotham is in a particularly dark place, with the Orghams threatening to make the city forget Batman entirely. Instead, acting as Catwoman&#39;s distraction, Azrael forces the city to remember a different Batman: one more suited to the chaos and violence, the brink of which Gotham once more teeters. It is not the first time a Batman has risen to fill the void left by Bruce Wayne&#39;s absence, but that Azrael&#39;s particularly violent Batman is the one who answers this call speaks to a very difficult future ahead.



 Azrael&#39;s Reemergence as Batman Signals Dark Times for Gotham 
          

Catwoman first comes to Azrael needing a distraction for her heist, and there&#39;s certainly no distraction quite like &#39;90s overkill. But with Bruce Wayne being exiled from Gotham one way or another, it remains to be seen if Azrael will continue to wear the mantle of the Bat in a city that has lost its protector. Gotham City now has a wildcard Batman it hasn&#39;t seen for thirty years, and with Azrael in his batsuit again, all bets are off.
