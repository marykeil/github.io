## Literature Review

Wolverine&#39;s healing factor has been shown to help him recover from deadly injuries, with Marvel finally confirming what it needs to work properly.




Spoilers for X-Men #29!One of the most popular members of the X-Men, Wolverine, is world-renowned for his highly advanced healing factor: a mutant power that has kept him alive and kicking for far longer and after far more potentially life-ending injuries than he can count. And while it’s often speculated as to what fuels this incredibly helpful skill, Marvel hasn’t officially confirmed what that “power source” might be, with the latest issue of X-Men finally making this elusive but ultimately obvious fact known.




Regenerating after any number of particularly bad clashes with Sabretooth, being incinerated down to his adamantium skeleton, or being shot, stabbed, poked, prodded, and beat down ad nauseam, Wolverine’s healing factor is arguably more important than his iconic bone claws, especially in a fight against someone more powerful than him.

          

While this specific mutant power is shared by more than a few other iconic characters like Deadpool, Laura Kinney’s Wolverine, Mystique, and more, Wolverine’s version is by far the most efficient and effective, with Marvel finally confirming Logan needs as many calories as possible to make his healing factor work properly.

                  Ultron Would Lose His Mind Over Wolverine&#39;s New Adamantium Weapon   As a death-defying member of Marvel&#39;s X-Force, Wolverine has Forge make him a new weapon out of adamantium (and the MCU&#39;s Ultron would be furious).   





 Wolverine&#39;s Enhanced Healing Factor Uses Calories To Work 
          

Confirmed in an offhand remark by Wolverine in X-Men #29, by Gerry Duggan and Joshua Cassara, this issue sees the current incarnation of the team travel to Latveria to try and recruit Doctor Doom’s Legion of Mutants to fight back against the anti-mutant organization known as Orchis. Treated to a buffet of gourmet food during a brief ceasefire with the Legion, Logan scarfs down as much as he can as fast as he can, saying, “I need a lotta calories when I heal, and they rolled us,” outright telling fans that not only does he need calories to fuel his healing ability, but he needs them now considering he was beaten down pretty badly in the earlier fight.

Similar to how DC’s Flash needs to keep eating to fuel his speedster superpowers, Wolverine also needs an enormous amount of calories for his metabolism-boosting mutation to work, explaining why he’s always throwing back six-packs and chowing down like a savage whenever there’s anything edible in front of him, with how many calories Logan consumes directly influencing its strength. If Wolverine is waging a one-man war on nothing but a ham sandwich, it’d be reasonable to assume he wouldn’t have the energy to help himself bounce back from injury as quickly. Alternatively, if Logan has eaten his fill — like how he’s trying to do here in case of another fight with Doom’s Legion of Mutants — he’s more likely to tap into his full healing power.






 Wolverine Needs To Eat And Drink A Lot To Fuel His Mutant Power 
          

Wolverine’s healing factor can seemingly bring him back from the brink of death no matter the situation, so it’s good to finally be able to confirm this unique power is only possible if he keeps the calories coming. Logan’s constant intake of food and drink is an important part of what makes him the best at what he does, so maybe Wolverine should look into meal-prepping a little more often to keep himself at the top of his game at all times.



X-Men #29 is now available from Marvel Comics.
