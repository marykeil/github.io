## Literature Review

TMNT vs Street Fighter has been a treat for 90s kids throughout the series, and it reached its peak with the final epic matchup: Shredder vs M. Bison!




Warning! This article contains spoilers for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vs Street Fighter #5 The epic crossover of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter has just come to an end with the release of the fifth and final issue, and while the overall storyline wrapped up in incredibly satisfying fashion, it’s no secret that the true stars of this particular series were the fight scenes, and this final issue saved the best for last with Shredder vs M. Bison - a fight ‘90s arcade kids always wanted.




The build-up to this fight was felt throughout the crossover event, beginning with Street Fighter’s M. Bison kidnapping TMNT’s Shredder and forcing him into a classic Street Fighter fighting tournament. When it was revealed to Shredder who his real enemy was, the leader of the Foot Clan didn’t hesitate to find M. Bison to destroy him - and the battle that followed did now disappoint.

         

M. Bison and Shredder fought atop a New York City rooftop (a perfect location for an arcade-style fight), and the two didn’t hold anything back. Signature moves, brutal finishers, and all-around awesome combat were put on full display. No amount of button mashing could bring about the same level of video game-like carnage these two brought upon each other, and in the end, the fight didn’t even end. The big-bads of their respective franchises continued to fight even after the overarching storyline had come to an end, making this battle truly a gift that keeps on giving.




                  TMNT vs. Street Fighter Gives Raphael a Dark &amp; Powerful Upgrade   Raphael is a powerful fighter in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles continuity, but Street Fighter is about to make him even stronger with a dark power-up.    


 Shredder vs M. Bison Wasn’t The Only Iconic Mash-Up TMNT vs Street Fight Offered 
          

Shredder vs M. Bison may have been the ultimate fight in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vs Street Fighter #5 (by Paul Allor and Ariel Medel), but it was far from the only one of note throughout the limited series. From Raphael punching Guile in the face on the opening page of the first issue, to Michelangelo going toe-to-toe with Chun-Li only a few pages later, there was no shortage of increasingly brutal moments for fans to enjoy.

In fact, that first issue alone wasted no time in allowing fans the chance to see what an actual TMNT vs Street Fighter crossover game might look like, and the rest of the limited series promptly followed suit. Which makes a lot of sense, given that both the Street Fighter and TMNT franchises boasted some of the greatest arcade games of all time.






 ‘90s Kids’ Arcade Dreams Came True With TMNT vs Street Fighter Crossover

While Street Fighter originated as an arcade game - with Street Fighter II still considered by many to be the best one-v-one fighting arcade game of all time - TMNT had its fair share of widely popular games itself. For instance, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles In Time is perhaps the most memorable of the many TMNT games. Even early-2000s kids have memories of playing Turtles In Time at their local Chuck E. Cheese, well after the age of arcade popularity had passed. TMNT games like that one are what made the property so versatile and beloved by an entire generation, and why that love perpetuates to this day. And, upon its initial release, games like Turtles In Time were right there next to games like Street Fighter II, limited by the constraints of physical separation to only be enjoyed by gamers one at a time. At least, until now, as this comic series shows fans what that crossover would look like, while also giving them the matchup any two gamers would assuredly choose: Shredder vs M. Bison.




Even aside from their arcade game counterparts, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Street Fighter are incredibly popular franchises with lore that stretches well beyond any video game, including and especially in this particular limited series. And the standout moment within the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles vs Street Fighter series has to be the final fight between Shredder and M. Bison, as it’s truly one ‘90s kids always wanted.
