## Literature Review

Godzilla might have won his first bout with Superman, but two Justice League members team up to successfully get revenge for the Man of Tomorrow.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3!Godzilla may be strong, but the combined strength of two Justice League members has what it takes to bring the legendary kaiju down. The King of the Monsters made waves when he faced off against Superman, but a pair of Clark&#39;s allies aren&#39;t going to let Godzilla get away with his destruction.




In Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3 by Brian Buccellato and Christian Duce, Superman is down for the count after his battle with Godzilla. Elsewhere, Flash and Green Lantern deal with a outbreak in Iron Heights Penitentiary brought on by the Titan Scylla.

          

Back in Metropolis, Billy Batson has had enough of Godzilla and approaches the monster. He cries &#34;Shazam!&#34;, causing a bolt of Living Lightning to strike through Godzilla. The now-empowered Shazam plans to lead the monster out of the city, but not before getting revenge for Superman. He&#39;s joined by Supergirl, who also wants payback and together, they knock the monster flat on his back.


 Shazam and Supergirl Have Taken Down Godzilla 


          




After the Toyman used the Dreamstone to transport the Legion of Doom to the MonsterVerse, he discovered the Titans and decided to use them to destroy the Justice League. The powerful kaiju invaded the DC Universe&#39;s most iconic locations, forcing every hero to spring into action. While Batman, the Bat-Family and several Justice Leaguers took care of the bat-like Camazotz in Gotham, Superman, Hawkgirl, and Shazam dealt with Godzilla in Metropolis. Unfortunately, Shazam returned to his mortal form in the middle of the fight, forcing Superman to shield Billy Batson&#39;s body, critically injuring the Man of Steel.

It was a shock to fans online when they saw Godzilla beat Superman in their very first battle, especially since it seemed like the two were about evenly matched in power. But after Godzilla roasted Superman, it became a question of who, if anyone, in the Justice League could stop the out-of-control Titan. But if there&#39;s anyone who could, it&#39;d be Supergirl and Shazam. Kara is just as strong as her cousin and Superman has recognized that Billy has a comparable power level to a Kryptonian. Individually, Shazam and Supergirl might not be able to beat Godzilla, but together they had what it took to defeat him.






 Supergirl and Shazam Can Help the Justice League Beat the Titans 
          

As powerful as the Justice League is, they&#39;re finding it difficult to rein in the rampaging Titans. However, Shazam and Supergirl&#39;s combined efforts could go a long way towards helping the team defeat the monsters. After all, Godzilla is the king of his fellow kaiju for a reason. If Kara and Billy have the strength to flatten Godzilla, then the rest of the MonsterVerse leviathans shouldn&#39;t be a problem. Granted, they&#39;ll still need to find some way to get the monsters back to their home universe. But the Justice League&#39;s two heavy hitters will go a long way to ending this crisis.

Justice League vs. Godzilla vs. Kong #3 is on sale now from DC Comics.
