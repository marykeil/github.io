 10  &#34;She&#39;s Angry With You Again.&#34; 
Published August 28, 2005


 







In the Garfield comics, it&#39;s usually Jon Arbuckle who finds himself caught in the crossfire of Garfield&#39;s antics and Mrs. Feeny&#39;s wrath. While Garfield may be the mastermind behind Mrs. Feeny&#39;s woes, poor Jon invariably bears the brunt, answering her irate phone calls and grappling with the aftermath of his mischievous cat&#39;s escapades.
One of Garfield&#39;s favorite methods of antagonizing Mrs. Feeny involves pilfering her belongings. In this comic, the cat goes above and beyond in his sticky-finger escapades as it&#39;s humorously suggested that Garfield spirited away Mrs. Feeny&#39;s bloomers, dog, and even her husband, each item being more absurd than the last.
Mrs. Feeny never appears in-panel in the Garfield comics. She is usually on the phone with Jon complaining about Garfield’s latest slight against her. 






 9  &#34;I&#39;m Sorry, Mrs. Feeny...&#34; 
Published January 29, 2002
        

Continuing the theme of Garfield&#39;s light-fingered exploits, an absurd situation unfolds when Jon Arbuckle receives a call from Mrs. Feeny reporting her missing wig. Like a good neighbor, Jon assures Mrs. Feeny that he&#39;ll investigate the matter, only to discover upon hanging up that Garfield is the wig-stealing culprit.
In a stroke of comedic genius, Jim Davis weaves absurdity and visual gags into a hilarious comic strip. The scene ends with Garfield sporting a monstrous tangle of blonde curls—the unmistakable result of pilfering Mrs. Feeny&#39;s wig. This collision of absurd situations and Davis&#39; knack for visual humor is a prime example of why Garfield comics are celebrated.





 8  &#34;How Many?!&#34; 
Published September 15, 2001


 







With signature humor, this comic strip showcases the franchise&#39;s inclination toward the absurd and surreal when the famously lazy Garfield manages to acquire fifteen howler monkeys and unleashes them upon the unsuspecting Mrs. Feeny.
While the chaotic scene itself isn&#39;t visually depicted in the comic, the mere suggestion of Garfield orchestrating such pandemonium is enough to tickle the reader&#39;s imagination. The mental image of fifteen howler monkeys wreaking havoc on an elderly woman compensates for the absence of a visual representation, amplifying the comedic impact. This clever play of absurdity exemplifies the unique and enduring humor embedded within the world of Garfield.





 7  &#34;I Swear!&#34; 
Published August 1, 1999


 







Garfield elevates his antagonism of Mrs. Feeny to unprecedented levels when he glues her dog to a cross-town bus, employing epoxy as his adhesive of choice. Even by Garfield&#39;s mischievous standards, this move ventures into morally gray territory, underscoring the character&#39;s willingness to push boundaries in his ongoing feud with the elderly lady.
However, this comic strip&#39;s true brilliance and humor emerge when Garfield, in a bid to maintain innocence, fervently swears to Jon that he had no involvement in the epoxy-infused escapade. Raising his hand in a solemn oath, Garfield&#39;s attempt at deception backfires hilariously as his own mug becomes unwittingly glued to his palm.

 6  &#34;I Think the Woman Secretly Loves Me.&#34; 
Published September 29, 2007
        

In this comedic gem of a comic strip, fans are treated to a glimpse of the inventive and uproarious measures Mrs. Feeny employs to shield herself from Garfield&#39;s ceaseless antics. As Jon and Garfield observe, Mrs. Feeny takes the extraordinary step of stringing her yard with barbed wire, leaving no doubt that it&#39;s a direct response to Garfield&#39;s mischievous endeavors.
The absurdity of the situation is not lost on fans, who can&#39;t help but empathize with Mrs. Feeny&#39;s plight. In her quest for a tranquil and Garfield-free existence, the seemingly over-the-top reaction captures the essence of the longstanding and amusing feud between her and Garfield.





 5  &#34;Mrs. Feeny Brought Us a Cake!&#34; 
Published October 24, 1999


 







In a delightful deviation from the usual dynamic between Mrs. Feeny and Garfield, this comic strip takes a surprising turn as the elderly lady decides it&#39;s high time to serve a dish of revenge. Unlike the typical aftermath of Garfield&#39;s mischievous escapades, Mrs. Feeny becomes the mastermind of comedic retribution.
Her retaliation unfolds in the form of her giving them what appears to be a cake, a seemingly sweet gesture. However, the twist comes to light as Jon cuts into it, only to have the confection pop, revealing it as a disguised balloon iced to resemble a cake. Mrs. Feeny, it seems, is a firm believer in the adage that revenge is sweet.





 4  &#34;That Was Mrs. Feeny.&#34; 
Published May 25, 2005


 







As often seen, a running gag in the Garfield comics that star Mrs. Feeny is Garfield stealing the elderly lady’s belongings. However, in this comic, instead of stealing her underwear or her wig, Garfield steals her dentures.
The absurdity doesn&#39;t end there, though. The comic&#39;s final panel unveils a brilliantly comical twist – Garfield transforms Mrs. Feeny&#39;s dentures into a puppet, creating a visual spectacle as golden as it is absurd. The equally sharp and humorous dialogue adds another layer to the comedy. Garfield slyly informs Jon that Mrs. Feeny will have to engage in an arm-wrestling match with his sock puppet if she wants her teeth back.





 3  &#34;She&#39;s Going Down.&#34; 
Published June 5, 2009
        

This particular strip stands out as a rare moment where Mrs. Feeny manages to get one over on Garfield. Armed with a leaf blower as her weapon of choice, the elderly lady successfully chases off Garfield. However, Jon&#39;s comment hints that this isn&#39;t the first time Mrs. Feeny has wielded her leaf blower against the mischievous feline, adding a humorous layer of familiarity to the scenario.
Garfield&#39;s subsequent vow of revenge, coupled with the visual portrayal of him thoroughly disheveled, exemplifies Jim Davis&#39; mastery in storytelling within the constraints of three succinct panels, which is the format that many of the Garfield comics follow.





 2  &#34;Look, Mrs. Feeny Is Making a Snowman!&#34; 
Published November 30, 2010
        

Jim Davis&#39; exceptional storytelling prowess is on full display in this particular Garfield comic, highlighting his talent for crafting clever and concise narratives within the limitations of a comic strip. The genius lies in his use of witty dialogue that conjures a mental image of pure hilarity.
While the comic doesn&#39;t visually portray Mrs. Feeny loading a colossal snowball into a catapult aimed at Garfield and Jon&#39;s house, readers can&#39;t help but envision the absurd and comical scene in their minds. It highlights the enduring charm of Garfield&#39;s humor, where the punchline isn&#39;t just in the visuals but in the vivid scenarios painted through clever wordplay.





 1  &#34;Nice Calligraphy&#34; 
Published December 1, 2007


 







This Garfield comic stands as the crowning jewel of the collection, seamlessly capturing both the beloved pettiness of Mrs. Feeny and the apex humor characteristic of Garfield strips. The setup is deceptively festive, as Mrs. Feeny sends a Christmas card to Jon and Garfield, only for Jon to unveil a handwritten restraining order upon opening the card.
However, the punchline&#39;s true brilliance lies in Garfield&#39;s nonchalant response. Instead of acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Garfield, in his irreverent fashion, casually remarks, &#34;Nice calligraphy,&#34; completely sidestepping the fact that their neighbor has just issued a restraining order against them.
