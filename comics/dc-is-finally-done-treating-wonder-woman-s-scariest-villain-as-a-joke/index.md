## Literature Review

Amanda Waller plots to take out Wonder Woman using her greatest foes and reaffirms just how dangerous the villain Doctor Psycho really is.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Wonder Woman #4!An unexpected Wonder Woman antagonist is finally being treated like the genuine threat he is. After recent events have made the Amazons public enemy number one, the powers that be are about to handle the situation using Diana&#39;s rogues, including one that even Amanda Waller finds a bit disconcerting.




In Wonder Woman #4 by Tom King and Daniel Sampere, the intense paranoia surrounding the Amazons is only increasing as the President of the United States prepares to issue a statement about Wonder Woman. Advising his speech is Wonder Woman&#39;s new villain and the secret king of America, the Sovereign.

          

Elsewhere, Amanda Waller discusses a new plan to rein in Wonder Woman: assembling a team of her greatest nemeses. Waller&#39;s associate Sarge Steel cracks a joke about Doctor Psycho, causing Waller to remind Steel to take Psycho seriously. She tells Steel that Psycho&#39;s mental abilities could easily make someone like Steel lose his mind.

Wonder Woman and her sisters paid a terrible price for the actions of one rogue Amazon. After a warrior named Emelie killed a pool hall filled with men, the United States passed legislation that banned Amazons from American soil. Despite the government&#39;s creation of the Amazon Extradition Entity, Wonder Woman refused to leave and has been investigating Emelie herself. It hasn&#39;t been easy as Sarge Steel has made it his personal mission to have Wonder Woman arrested after she destroyed his cybernetic hand in combat. Also working against Diana is the Sovereign, who is subtly making moves to turn the public against her.

The telekinetic foe might not be the most physically imposing member of Wonder Woman&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery, but he&#39;s been a recurring threat for a reason. Doctor Psycho is a powerful psychic who uses his abilities to torment women due to his strong misogynistic beliefs. Waller is correct when she says whoever crosses Doctor Psycho runs the risk of having their entire personality wiped. But if that&#39;s the case, why are Waller and Steel trying to recruit him? It&#39;s because the government has already thrown weapons and armies at Diana to no avail. Now they need to use her most powerful and despicable villains to stop Wonder Woman.






 Does Doctor Psycho Present a Threat to Wonder Woman? 
          

Generally, Wonder Woman doesn&#39;t concern herself much with Doctor Psycho and in most situations, she could easily beat him. However, Waller and Steel are assembling a murderers&#39; row of her worst antagonists to attack Diana at once. Sure, she could deal with Psycho no problem in a one-on-one battle. But can she fend off his devious mental attacks when also dealing with villains like Giganta or Circe? Even someone as hardened as Waller recognizes that Psycho is more dangerous than he seems and that could spell trouble in the future for Wonder Woman.

Wonder Woman #4 is on sale now.
