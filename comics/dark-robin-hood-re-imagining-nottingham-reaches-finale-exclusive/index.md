Summary

  Robin Hood is portrayed as a murderer, looking out for himself and King Richard in Nottingham from Mad Cave Studios.   The third and final volume of Nottingham will serve as the finale to the series, pitting the Sheriff against Robin as they battle for Nottingham.   The creative team, including acclaimed letterer Justin Birch, has put in years of work to complete the series, promising action, twists, and new revelations in the concluding arc.  







Robin Hood and his Merry Men are returning in Mad Cave Studios&#39; upcoming finale of Nottingham. The dark twist on the legendary hero will also bring the return of Everard Blackthorne, the sheriff of Nottingham. The city is no longer the same, and the King is on his way back home as a final confrontation looms ahead.

Nottingham has spanned two volumes, as well as a spin-off series, Tales from Nottingham. Collectively, these stories lead into the third and final volume, which begins with Nottingham #11. The finale has the creative team of David Hazan, Shane Connery Volk, Luca Romano, and Justin Birch.

          

This dark twist has rewritten the story of Robin Hood, turning him from a hero of the poor to a selfish man looking out for himself and King Richard the Lionheart. His goals cause him to forcefully remove obstacles from his path, whether they be the noble class or the law.

 Mad Cave Studios Returns to Its Dark Vision of Nottingham in Concluding Volume 
         

Beginning April 10, the third arc will serve as a finale to the series. Titled The Last Tithe, this arc will pit the Sheriff against Robin once more as they battle for Nottingham. The series has already garnered attention, being a winner of the 2019 Talent Search. It is also adding acclaimed comic creators to the team, like Ringo Award-nominated letterer Justin Birch. Already, the series has turned the legend of Robin Hood around, making the hero more of a villain. The finale will span five issues, which will be released monthly. The synopsis is as follows:





The Changing of the Guard. Everard Blackthorne, the Sheriff of Nottingham, returns home to find a city he barely recognizes. With the Merry Men in charge and Robin and the King closing in, blood, panic, and treachery flow in equal measure.

 Nottingham&#39;s Creative Team Reflects on the Upcoming Finale, Promising More Grim Storytelling 
          

Chas! Pangburn, Mad Cave Studios&#39; editor, says:


From the 2019 Mad Cave talent search to the present, David Hazan and Shane Connery Volk have poured blood, sweat, and ink into numerous panels of the Nottingham franchise. With Luca Romano and Justin Birch in tow, these Merry Men are closing out their tale with a quiver full of action, twists, and new revelations. In the indie world, it can be hard for a series to make it to a single volume, so we&#39;re beyond proud of this team for telling their complete story in a way that will appease both first-time readers and longtime fans. This is the beginning of the end!





David Hazan, series writer, adds:


This is it! Volume 3! It&#39;s incredibly gratifying to be able to do this once again and I&#39;m thankful to all the fans who took a chance on what was our first book. This is the culmination of all of our work on this series over the last 4 years, so get ready for more of our Sheriff, and more of your favorites, but...as always...don&#39;t get too attached, because in The Final Tithe, Nottingham will burn and heads will roll!


Nottingham artist Shane Connery Volk says, &#34;It&#39;s bittersweet knowing this is the end, but if you&#39;re gonna go out - go out with a bang! Nottingham Vol. 3 is the Sheriff&#39;s worst day on the job yet. Time to burn the whole thing down!&#34;

Colorist Luca Romano reflected on the character of the Sheriff of Nottingham:


Ah, poor Ev - A life in servitude to others. Beaten and beater, over and over. Is it guilt that brought you back to the usurped lion&#39;s den, even though you had a once in a lifetime chance to walk away with a clean slate? Is it duty? A misplaced sense of honor? No matter now, the Lion is back, and all you&#39;ll find for certain in the streets of Nottingham are misery and death.





Nottingham #11 will be available on April 10 from Mad Cave Studios.
