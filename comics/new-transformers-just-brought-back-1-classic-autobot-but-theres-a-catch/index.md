## Literature Review

After only a few issues, this Autobot just made their Energon Universe debut: a classic character most fans didn&#39;t expect to see this early on.





Summary

  Jazz makes a surprise appearance in the Energon Universe, helping Optimus Prime and Cliffjumper in their fight against the Decepticons.   Jazz&#39;s addition to the team relieves some of the pressure on Optimus Prime and adds firepower to the Autobot ranks.   Unfortunately, Jazz&#39;s revival is short-lived, running out of power after the battle, but Optimus Prime discovers a potential source of more power.  







The Energon Universe era of Transformers has been one of the most exciting periods in the franchise’s storied history, and Skybound Entertainment is keeping fans excited by including one famous Autobot. The new arrival comes at a crucial time for Optimus Prime, as the Autobot leader finds himself backed against the wall in his fight against the Decepticons on Earth.

Coming from the creative team of Daniel Warren Johnson, Mike Spicer and Rus Wooten, Transformers #4 finds Prime rushing a wounded Spike Witwicky to the hospital. He’s then assaulted by Starscream, which leads him to call on chief medic Ratchet for help.



          

Working on repairing Wheeljack, Ratchet stops working to find an Autobot with more serious firepower to help Prime and Cliffjumper as the two must fight off Starscream and Soundwave. Ratchet then repairs Jazz, who comes flying into the battle just in the nick of time to help his friends.





 The Transformer Jazz Makes His Energon Universe Debut 
          

Jazz’s arrival is a pretty big twist, as this Autobot wasn’t in the initial line-up announced last summer. Of course, Transformers #1 revealed that many Autobots and Decepticons crashed on Earth centuries ago and were lying in wait until the arrival of Jetfire. Unfortunately for the Autobots, Starscream was the first &#39;bot resuscitated by the Ark’s super-computer, Teletraan I. Starscream immediately began destroying the comatose Autobots, and a newly-revived Optimus Prime barely escaped with his comatose Autobots in tow. Due to a lack of Energon and the destruction of Teletraan I, only a handful of Autobots have been revived, which makes Jazz’s surprise appearance all the more exciting.

Jazz is a strong choice for the new line-up of Transformers, as the music-loving Autobot was one of the initial robots released in the original line of toys from 1984. Jazz has traditionally been portrayed as Optimus Prime’s first lieutenant, so having him on the team will help take some of the crushing weight of responsibility off of Prime’s shoulders. Jazz also acts as the head of Special Operations, leading various Autobot agents on deadly missions against the Decepticons; Jazz, however, usually reserves the most dangerous missions for himself.






 The Autobot Ranks Grow as Jazz Joins the Fight 
          

Sadly, Jazz’s newfound lease on life is short-lived, as Ratchet only had enough power to revive Jazz for a short burst to help out with the fight. Jazz runs out of power almost immediately after the battle, leaving Prime and the surviving Autobots in the same place as before. The issue ends with a glimmer of hope, however, as Optimus Prime learns of a way to get more power from Spike Witwicky’s dad, Sparkplug. Whoever shows up next, Energon Universe fans definitely won’t want to miss an issue of Transformers to see what happens.
