## Literature Review

Shazam gets a boost in one of his six god-given powers, but this latest upgrade could be driving a wedge between Billy Batson and the Captain.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Shazam #6!An internal schism within Shazam could be driving Billy Batson away from his heroic alter ego. After taking on the gods to regain his independence, the Captain is finally taking back control of his powers. But an upgrade to one of his divine gifts might lead to a devastating inner struggle.




In Shazam #6 by Mark Waid and Dan Mora, Freddy Freeman and the rest of the Shazam Family spring into action to save Shazam from becoming the gods&#39; servant. During the fight, Billy talks with Solomon, who expresses regret for helping the gods try to control Billy&#39;s alter ego.

          

Billy asks Solomon for a boost in wisdom to overcome the gods&#39; influence and end this fight. Solomon agrees but mentions that there&#39;s a growing divide between the two identities, each referring to the other as a different person. Solomon gives Billy additional wisdom but cautions that this could wind up making the divide between Billy and the Captain worse.


 Shazam&#39;s Enhanced Wisdom is About to Tear Him Up Inside 
          




For some time now, Billy Batson has been at odds with the gods he draws his Shazam powers from. Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury were displeased that the world had forgotten them. They decided to take control over Batson&#39;s powerful alter ego, the Captain and remind the Earth&#39;s mortals of their power. Fortunately, Billy wasn&#39;t under their influence as his regular self. But any time he said his magic word, the Captain became a puppet for whichever god was controlling him at the time, causing him to say and do things he ordinarily never would.

When Billy transforms into the Captain, he&#39;s becoming a grown version of himself imbued with the power of six legendary figures. By all accounts, they&#39;re the same person. But both Billy and the Captain seem to be viewing themselves as independent entities entirely. After all, Billy can&#39;t use his powers when he&#39;s in his normal body, so it&#39;s no wonder he sees his alter ego as someone else. Solomon is right, an increase in wisdom is just going to make the Captain more aware that he can do things Billy isn&#39;t capable of. And that knowledge could lead the Captain to making a difficult, and pretty shocking decision.






 The Captain is Going to Get Rid of Billy Entirely 
          

If the Captain has Solomon&#39;s wisdom, he very well could come to the conclusion that he could do more good for the world by not changing back into his mortal form. If he sees Billy&#39;s body as his and not theirs, then he&#39;ll have no reason to revert to normal. What&#39;s going to happen if the Captain decides not to transform back into Billy Batson? Billy obviously won&#39;t be able to do anything, and his family might be out of luck as well. If Billy&#39;s not careful, then the Champion of Shazam&#39;s newfound wisdom could ultimately cause the Captain to betray his mortal half.

Shazam #6 is on sale now from DC Comics.
