# Star Wars Officially Brings Legends  Most Aggressive Jedi Force Power Back into Continuity


## SUMMARY 



  Star Wars reintroduces the ancient Force combat technique called Shon-Ju in &#34;The High Republic,&#34; allowing Jedi to fight without lightsabers by channeling the Force through their hands.   Shon-Ju was previously a rogue Padawan in Legends continuity, but its new origins in &#34;The High Republic&#34; make more sense in the Star Wars timeline while still honoring the character.   The live-action &#34;Ahsoka&#34; series seemingly features Jedi Ezra Bridger using his own form of Force combat similar to Shon-Ju, further connecting it to the canon.

## Literature Review

Summary

  Star Wars reintroduces the ancient Force combat technique called Shon-Ju in &#34;The High Republic,&#34; allowing Jedi to fight without lightsabers by channeling the Force through their hands.   Shon-Ju was previously a rogue Padawan in Legends continuity, but its new origins in &#34;The High Republic&#34; make more sense in the Star Wars timeline while still honoring the character.

Star Wars has brought back an impressive new Force power from Legends, making it canon once more, albeit with all-new origins. Amid the High Republic Era set hundreds of years before the prequel films, the Jedi Order is facing key rivals known as the Nihil marauders. To that end, there have been moments where the Jedi have been unable to wield their iconic lightsabers, instead having to rely on the Force itself.

With the High Republic entering its third publishing phase, Charles Soule&#39;s Shadows of Starlight reveals the aftermath of the Nihil&#39;s attack on Starlight Beacon, a satellite meant to be a shining symbol of hope for the Republic. Now, even the Jedi have grown fearful of the Nihil and all the power they possess, especially seeing as how many of their weapons specifically target the Jedi themselves such as the Force predators known as the Nameless. However, a unique style of Force combat has returned from Legends when the Nihil successfully deactivates the lightsabers belonging to a group of Jedi in Shadows of Starlight #3 from Soule and artist Jethro Morales.

 Shon-Ju In Star Wars Legends Explained 
Shon-Ju Was A Rogue Jedi
          

In the pre-existing Legends continuity, Shun-Ju was a Padawan during the prequel era who was obsessed with turning the Force into a weapon of attack and aggression. As such, he was never knighted by the Jedi Council leading to his departure from the Jedi Order. However, Shon-Ju was encouraged by Count Dooku to continue his studies on his own. As a result, Shon-Ju strengthened his connection to the Force, eventually discarding his lightsaber as he successfully developed a means of wielding the Force through his hands as a new fighting style as seen in Jeremy Barlow&#39;s The Clone Wars: Deadly Hands of Shon-Ju.




Shon-Ju then went in search of other rejected Padawans and Force sensitives who&#39;d been overlooked by the Jedi. He then created his own school/cult heading into the Clone Wars. However, Shon-Ju eventually encounters Aayla Secura whom he initially rescued yet later betrayed. During their showdown, Secura cut off his hands with her lightsaber, though she was unaware that Shon-Ju had ultimately survived their encounter and the destruction of the facility they&#39;d been fighting in. As such, it was later revealed that Shon-Ju received cybernetic hands as even deadlier replacements.

 Shon-Ju&#39;s New Origins in The High Republic 
An Ancient Force Technique
          




Although Shon-Ju has finally returned to the official Star Wars canon and timeline, it&#39;s debuting as an ancient fighting style predating even the High Republic Era. Now, Shon-Ju is the name of this particular Force combat technique rather than a rogue Padawan during the Clone Wars. It&#39;s undoubtedly been named after him in spirit, a fun meta-connection for Star Wars fans as a nod to the old Legends continuity.

As seen in Shadows of Starlight #3, Jedi Grandmaster Pra-Tre Veter is joined by the newly knighted Bell Zettifar and Burryaga who are attempting to protect a group of townspeople from the Nihil. The marauders have claimed a vast portion of the galaxy in the wake of Starlight&#39;s fall, walling it off behind their &#34;Stormwall&#34; technology which prevents ships from entering their Occulsion Zone at lightspeed. As such, those on the edge of the zone have been in grave danger, necessitating the need for the Jedi&#39;s protection. However, the Nihil implements their lightsaber nullifier which temporarily deactivates any lightsaber in proximity.




As a result, Grandmaster Veter instructs Bell and Burry to flee with the townspeople while he fights the Nihil on his own, calling upon the ancient art of Shon-Ju to take on the marauders with his bare hands. As such, it&#39;s quite an impressive display of power, one that&#39;s perhaps allowed for use by the Jedi only in the most extreme circumstances, such as this. Although Veter is ultimately defeated and captured by the Nihil thanks to a controlled repulsor blast from their ship overhead, there&#39;s no denying that Shon-Ju makes quite an epic return to the canon in this new issue.



 Shon-Ju Makes More Sense Now In The Star Wars Timeline 
Did Shon-Ju Precede Lightsabers?
          

Overall, Shon-Ju&#39;s new status as an ancient Force combat technique makes a lot more sense considering the full scope of the Star Wars timeline. Rather than a single Padawan learning how to channel the Force into his hands for fighting ahead of the Jedi Order&#39;s fall, it&#39;s logical that Shon-Ju has instead been around for much longer and much closer to the dawn of the Jedi themselves. Likewise, perhaps Shon-Ju was developed by the First Jedi before the first lightsabers were even constructed.




Furthermore, one could argue that this new version of Shon-Ju could be more focused on defense, to be used only when a Jedi finds themselves unarmed and in danger. This would be in contrast to Legends&#39; Shon-Ju whose Force combat was likely tinged with the dark side while being overly aggressive. However, Grandmaster Pra-Tre Veter absolutely decimates several of the Nihil using Shon-Ju all the same, making the ability in both continuities inherently aggressive (though perhaps it all comes down to intention).

 Did Ezra Bridger Use Shon-Ju In Ahsoka? 
He May Have Developed His Own Style
         

There&#39;s also a potential Shon-Ju connection to be made with Jedi Ezra Bridger in the live-action Ahsoka series. Having been found by Sabine Wren following a ten-year exile on Peridea, Ezra and Sabine fought a collection of Grand Admiral Thrawn&#39;s Night Troopers and Shin Hati, the dark apprentice of Baylan Skoll. Because Ezra had been without his lightsaber for that entire time, the Jedi is notably shown fighting the troopers and Shin using nothing but the Force and his bare hands.




This sequence included a few close-quarter moments that could be considered a form of Force combat not unlike Shon-Ju. As such, it&#39;s quite possible that Ezra spent his exile in the Star Wars canon developing his own technique as a means of survival. Now, this scene is even more dynamic now that the High Republic has since brought back the concept of Shon-Ju and Force combat from Legends.
