# Why Spider-Man &amp; Captain America Aren t Close in the MCU - 1 Quote Solves This Change from the Comics


## SUMMARY 



  Peter Parker admires Steve Rogers because he recognizes similarities between the fabled Avengers leader and his late Uncle Ben.   Without Uncle Ben in the MCU, Peter doesn&#39;t have a reason to look up to Steve Rogers as much as he does in the comics.   Peter&#39;s affiliation with Iron Man in the MCU is influenced by the absence of Uncle Ben and his admiration for Tony Stark&#39;s scientific interests, rather than the deeper respect he has for Captain America in the comics.

## Literature Review

Though Spider-Man idolizes Captain America in Marvel Comics, the two aren&#39;t close in the MCU. A scene from Amazing Spider-Man #521 explains why.




Though Spider-Man has been known to idolize Steve Rogers&#39; Captain America in Marvel Comics, this relationship has been notably present for both characters&#39; appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One Spider-Man quote from the comics perfectly highlights why Peter Parker looks up to Steve Rogers so much – and why this admiration may be largely absent in the MCU.




The Amazing Spider-Man #521 – by J. Michael Straczynski, Mike Deodato Jr., Joe Pimentel, and Tom Palmer – features Spider-Man living in Avengers Tower, alongside Aunt May and Mary Jane, following the destruction of their homes. When Peter suspects a recent fight against HYDRA was a diversion, he shares the information with new roommate and teammate, Steve Rogers.



          

Though Captain America hesitates to believe HYDRA has once again become a formidable threat, he encourages Peter to dig deeper find the truth of the situation. Here, Peter notes, the Man out of Time sounds like another hero of his: Uncle Ben.

                  Captain America Admits the Secret Reason Spider-Man Creeps Him Out   Captain America and Spider-Man have frequently worked side-by-side, as two of Marvel&#39;s most iconic heroes – all while Cap was secretly arachnophobic.   





 Captain America Reminds Spider-Man Of Uncle Ben 


          

After fighting a HYDRA team resembling some of the Avengers (Captain America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, and Thor), Spider-Man begins to suspect that the attack was merely a feint for some greater plan. He brings this information to Rogers, whose speech patterns strongly resemble Uncle Ben&#39;s: &#34;Tough as nails, but quietly idealistic and resolute.&#34; Spider-Man remarks that their similarities may be generational, as both Steve and Ben &#34;looked into the greatness darkness in history, and came out appreciating the light more than anyone who came after them&#34; following their service in World War II. In the previous issue, May mentions how meaningful Captain America was to Ben during the war.



Without [Uncle] Ben&#39;s presence, there is nothing to set Steve apart in Peter&#39;s mind from the other Avengers of that world... As such, Peter&#39;s affection swings more toward Iron Man, a hero and celebrity who was prominent for much of Peter&#39;s lifetime and shared in his scientific interests.







Though the two are teammates at the time, Spider-Man still struggles with being the new kid on the block, as he adapts to working alongside a man whom he has long admired. He&#39;s a friendly neighborhood hero trying to prove himself among living legends. Hearing Uncle Ben&#39;s voice in Steve&#39;s words only makes Peter revere Captain America more, positioning him as a titanic beacon of good, reminding the new Avenger of the reason he&#39;s Spider-Man in the first place. It&#39;s a touching context through which to consider their relationship, explaining why Peter looks up to Steve. In many ways, Captain America embodies Uncle Ben&#39;s morals and philosophy, given powers and a shield.



 Spider-Man&#39;s Comic Book Dynamic With Captain America Explains Why They Aren&#39;t   In The MCU 


          



Though Spider-Man outwardly idolizes Captain America in the comics, Peter and Steve have only a brief relationship in the MCU. This can partially be narratively explained by the MCU&#39;s lack of an Uncle Ben. Without Ben&#39;s presence, there is nothing to set Steve apart in Peter&#39;s mind from the other Avengers of that world. Even if Ben were around, he would not have been of an age to serve in World War II, thus hampering Ben&#39;s idolization of Steve as well. As such, Peter&#39;s affection swings more toward Iron Man, a hero and celebrity who was prominent for much of Peter&#39;s lifetime and shared in his scientific interests.




This dynamic between Spider-Man, Captain America, and Iron Man would be heavily explored soon after their fight against HYDRA in Marvel&#39;s Civil War storyline. During Civil War, Spider-Man initially sides with Iron Man (much like in the MCU) out of respect for Tony, who helped Peter, MJ, and Aunt May after their homes were destroyed. This decision quickly haunts him, however, as he realizes he cannot bear to fight against Captain America and arrest other heroes. Knowing Steve Rogers reminds Peter of Uncle Ben makes this decision all the more haunting. When Spider-Man sided with Iron Man, he didn&#39;t just let Captain America down; he let Uncle Ben down too.
