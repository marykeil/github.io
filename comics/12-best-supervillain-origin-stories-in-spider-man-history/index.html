  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From Doc Ock to Kraven the Hunter, these iconic Spider-Man adversaries have origin stories that are impossible to not get engrossed in.</p>
<p>Spider-Man has a slew of awesome, intriguing villains with some incredibly absorbing origin stories. From the Hollywood past of Mysterio to the Fortune 500 beginnings of the Green Goblin&rsquo;s Norman Osborn, these Spider-Man villains have backgrounds that feature an enthralling mix of tragedy and corruptibility.
While many Spider-Man villains could qualify as having the best origin stories, there are a select few who have such complicated and fascinating histories that they rank among the greatest in all of comics. Although there is the saying that Marvel has the best heroes while DC has the most engaging villains, the best Spider-Man villains prove that adage wrong.</p>
<p>15 Most Likable Spider-Man Villains in Marvel History (Ranked)
Some of Spider-Man&rsquo;s villains have attempted redemption and their stories have made them temporary heroes, long-term heroes, or more likable villains.</p>
<p>12  Mysterio Turns from Hollywood to Villainy
Debuted in 1963</p>
<p>Born Quentin Beck, Mysterio was an MIT graduate with a passion for special effects. A stuntman and special effects expert that was hungry for stardom, Beck tried his hand at acting but was unsuccessful. After working on a project where an actor got inured from Beck&rsquo;s special effects, he was blacklisted.
With limited options, he turned to criminal enterprises, working with Phneas Mason by creating a diversion when stealing from the government. However, Spider-Man interrupted the scheme, causing Beck to seek revenge. He turned to his knowledge of technology and special effects as well as satisfying his desire for fame, and became a Spider-Man villain.</p>
<p>11  Scorpion is Hired for a Job and Driven Insane
Debuted in 1964</p>
<p>Unlike many villains, Scorpion&rsquo;s attempt on Spidey&rsquo;s life did not start out as personal, rather it was business. Mac Gargan was a private investigator that was hired by J Jonah Jameson to find out how Peter Parker was able to get the exceptional shots of Spider-Man. Things escalated and Gargan, recruited by Jameson, ended up becoming a test subject.
Dr. Stillwell, the head of the study, created a suit that was intended to give the wearer the powers of the scorpion, since the creature is a predator of spiders. The suit worked a little too well because the treatment drove Scorpion insane, which caused him to seek vengeance against Spider-Man and Jameson while pursuing a life of crime. The personality change and unfortunate circumstances make the Scorpion&rsquo;s origin story one to remember.</p>
<p>10  Kraven The Hunter Seeks the Ultimate Prey
Debuted in 1964</p>
<p>A child of the Russian aristocracy, Sergei Kravinoff became a big game hunter when his family nobility was lost. On a hunt in Kenya, he took a herbal potion from a witch doctor that gave him the superpowers of strength, speed, enhanced senses, and extended longevity.
The powers Kraven the Hunter gained are reputed to be so strong that he is actually stronger and faster than Captain America. His past as a hunter, who went so far as to kill big game animals with his bare hands, mixed with his enhanced superphysiology created an antagonist to Spider-Man that was indomitable. Determined to use his powers to hunt the ulitmate game, he journeyed to New York and set his sights on Spider-Man.</p>
<p>9  The Punisher Wages a One-Man War After Losing His Family
Debuted in 1973</p>
<p>Commonly recognized as an antihero, the Punisher was actually a villain of Spider-Man&rsquo;s because he thought that Spidey was a crook instead of the hero he actually is. The pair would eventually team up, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that they did not clash at the beginning of their encounters.
The Punisher, or Frank Castle, was immersed in violence from a young age, inflicting injuries on bullies and even setting a murderous mafioso on fire. Returning to Queens after being overseas in the Marines, Frank and his family witnessed a mob hit. As a result, the mafia killed his family to avoid witnesses. Because of the tragedy, Frank swore revenge and, along with his world-class weaponry, launched a one-man war on crime.</p>
<p>8  Morbius, The Living Vampire is Driven By a Thirst for Blood
Debuted in 1971</p>
<p>Afflicted by a rare blood disease, Dr. Michael Morbius was a Nobel Prize winner for advancements in biochemistry and a medical doctor with a degree in hematology. With his lifelong friend and fellow scientist Emil, Morbius devised an experimental treatment for his blood disorder that relied on vampire bat DNA and electroshock. The treatment had unforeseeable consequences, and Morbius became a living vampire.
Spider-Man was one of the first people Morbius encountered when he came to America from Greece. He tried to kill Spidey, who had six arms at the time, by sucking his blood, but Dr. Curt Connors interrupted, saving him. Interestingly, Dr. Connors and Peter discovered that Morbius&rsquo;s blood could cure their Lizard transformation and extra arms, respectively.</p>

<p>7  Green Goblin II Blames Spider-Man for His Father&rsquo;s Death
Debuted in 1965</p>
<p>Harry Osborn, the son of Norman Osborn, had a complicated life from the beginning. His father used Harry&rsquo;s soul as a bargaining chip in a deal with Mephisto so that Norman himself could have a financially successful life. Things were not off to a great start for Harry.
Later, Harry became close friends with Peter Parker, unknowingly befriending his father&rsquo;s enemy. Things took a turn for the worse when Harry swore revenge against his friend after the Green Goblin had died while killing Gwen Stacy. As a result, Harry became the Green Goblin II, taking off where Norman left off.</p>
<p>6  Venom Receives Spidey&rsquo;s Discarded Symbiote
Debuted in 1986</p>
<p>Arguably one of Spider-Man&rsquo;s most famous villains, Venom has now gained the status of antihero. Regardless, Venom and Spider-Man have a complicated and intertwined past that has seen them as both foes and allies. The whole reason Eddie Brock became Venom was inadvertently because of Spider-Man when the web-slinger cast aside the symbiote he had been wearing as a costume.
The symbiote, wanting a host, clung to a despairing Eddie. It merged with Brock&rsquo;s anger and hatred for Spider-Man, which stemmed from Brock blaming Spider-Man for his life falling apart and losing his job as a journalist. With the symbiote infecting his mind, Venom&rsquo;s desire for revenge against Spider-Man was set in motion.</p>
<p>5  Black Cat&rsquo;s Life of Crime is Interrupted by a Love for Spider-Man
Debuted in 1979</p>
<p>The daughter of an infamous cat burglar, Felcia Hardy would follow in her father&rsquo;s footsteps. After she was assaulted by someone she thought was a friend, Felicia sought to kill him for revenge but found she was too late when he died in a car accident. Rudderless and angry, Felicia used her genetic gift for thievery and her training as a fighter to become a cat burglar.
She was instantly successful and accrued a large fortune in stolen goods when she adopted the Black Cat persona. Her first act as the Black Cat was busting her dad out of prison, which is when she met Spider-Man. Operating on opposite sides of the law, Spider-Man was a natural adversary to the Black Cat. However, they would eventually have an on-again off-again romantic relationship as well as become allies.</p>
<p>4  Electro Sets Out on a Life of Crime After an Act of Heroism
Debuted in 1963</p>
<p>A founding member of the Sinister Six and the leader of the Emissaries of Evil, Electro has not just one, but two evil organizations dedicated to eradicating Spider-Man. However, he was not always the evil villain he became.
Working as an electric company lineman, Maxwell Dillon was struck by lightning when he tried to save one of his coworkers from falling. Dillon, instead of dying from the strike, was gifted electrical powers through the complete transformation of his nervous sytem that would cause him to have electrostatic energy. Deciding that using his powers for good was for suckers, Dillon turned to criminal acts due to his greed and love of money.</p>
<p>3  Lizard Becomes a Tragic Monster After a Science Experiment Gone Wrong
Debuted in 1963</p>
<p>Dr. Curt Connors was a surgeon in the U.S. Army when an explosion resulted in his arm needing to be amputated. Dr. Connors dedicated himself to researching a serum that regenerated limbs. Taking inspiration from reptiles, who can regenerate body parts, he used reptile DNA in his creation.
With himself as the first test subject in a risky procedure, the serum saw Dr. Connors&rsquo; arm grow back. However, the DNA of the reptiles altered his own, making him turn into the Lizard, a monstrous creature. In a twist of fate, his own creation was his downfall, turning him into a violent and hateful beast. However, Peter Parker eventually helped his past mentor get back to his normal self.</p>
<p>2  Doctor Octopus is a Brilliant But Egomaniacal Scientist
Debuted in 1963</p>
<p>One of Spider-Man&rsquo;s most well known foes, Doctor Octopus was Otto Octavius first. He was a studious researcher for the U.S. Atomic Research Center. There he created an invention that allowed handling radioactive substances from a safe distance through a chest harness with tentacle arms.
After a fight with his mother caused a heart attack, he was so consumed with guilt at work that his distraction caused radioactive chemicals to explode. Consequently, the radiation enabled him to mentally control the harness arms. However, the chemicals from the explosion also altered his brain in a change that saw him go from a devoted scientist to a narcissistic supervillain.</p>
<p>1  Green Goblin Goes from Fortune 500 CEO to Deranged Criminal
Debuted in 1964</p>
<p>Norman Osborn&rsquo;s change from the leader of a gigantic corporation to the sociopathic Green Goblin is one of the most interesting origin stories of a Marvel villain. Originally the co-founder of the chemical company Oscorp, Norman used the notes of his former co-founder who was caught embezzling and booted from the company to make a serum that would grant immense power.
Unbeknownst to him, his young son Harry messed with the serum, causing it to explode. The serum and explosion resulted in Norman having enhanced abilities like super strength and regenerative healing. Mixed with his new abilities and his existing high intelligence, Norman&rsquo;s superpowers were gained at the cost of his sanity. As a result, the Green Goblin was born and remains the greatest threat in Spider-Man&rsquo;s rogues&rsquo; gallery.</p>
