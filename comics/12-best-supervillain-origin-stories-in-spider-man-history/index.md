Born Quentin Beck, Mysterio was an MIT graduate with a passion for special effects. A stuntman and special effects expert that was hungry for stardom, Beck tried his hand at acting but was unsuccessful. After working on a project where an actor got inured from Beck&#39;s special effects, he was blacklisted.

Debuted in 1964
        

Unlike many villains, Scorpion&#39;s attempt on Spidey&#39;s life did not start out as personal, rather it was business.

Things escalated and Gargan, recruited by Jameson, ended up becoming a test subject.
Dr. Stillwell, the head of the study, created a suit that was intended to give the wearer the powers of the scorpion, since the creature is a predator of spiders. The suit worked a little too well because the treatment drove Scorpion insane, which caused him to seek vengeance against Spider-Man and Jameson while pursuing a life of crime. The personality change and unfortunate circumstances make the Scorpion&#39;s origin story one to remember.

The Punisher, or Frank Castle, was immersed in violence from a young age, inflicting injuries on bullies and even setting a murderous mafioso on fire.
