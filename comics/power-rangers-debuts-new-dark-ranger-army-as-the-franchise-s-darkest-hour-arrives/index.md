## Literature Review

As the year-long Power Rangers &#34;Darkest Hour&#34; storyline event kicks into full gear, the villainous Dark Specter has made his deadliest moves yet.




Warning: Spoilers for Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #114!As the &#34;Darkest Hour&#34; dawns upon the Power Rangers universe, their biggest threat has formed an army of evil, corrupted Rangers. The Big Bad in question is Dark Specter, the main antagonist of Power Rangers in Space, who has been repurposed in BOOM! Studios&#39; Mighty Morphin Power Rangers ongoing series to become the Thanos of the franchise. Now, he has reached his ultimate form, and is further building his resources.




Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #114 – by Melissa Flores, Simona Di Gianfelice, Raul Angulo, and Ed Dukeshire – reveals an army of evil Rangers is among the villainous Dark Specter&#39;s weapons. Throughout the past few issues, Dark Specter and his forces have been traveling to Rangers from past, present, future, and throughout the multiverse, using dark magic to turn these Power Rangers into mindless zombies.



          

The last issue saw Dark Specter and Mistress Vile (formerly known as Rita Repulsa) turning the Dino Charge Power Rangers into their latest minions, but this new issue reveals just how far and wide Dark Specter&#39;s army stretches.

In the comics, the &#34;Recharged&#34; story arc saw Rita Repulsa rebrand herself as Mistress Vile, a much stronger and far more dangerous version of her past self. As Mistress Vile, she became hellbent on bringing the all-powerful Dark Specter back into power and back into this world. After capturing Zordon&#39;s physical corpse and using it as a Vessel for Dark Specter, the ultimate baddie returned, bringing about the newest year-long arc, the Darkest Hour for the Power Rangers. Mistress Vile and Dark Specter don&#39;t stop there as to strengthen their forces, they start hopping from universe to universe, timeline to timeline to strengthen their army.

Using Vile&#39;s dark magic, they have transformed numerous Power Rangers into their personal henchmen. Any Ranger they find who they haven&#39;t turned, they simply imprison. The beginning of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #114 shows that Dark Specter&#39;s army currently have countless Rangers in their captivity, including from familiar teams like Wild Force, Lost Galaxy, Ninja Steel, Dino Charge, SPD, Mystic Force, and, of course, Mighty Morphin. Rocky, Adam, and Tommy Oliver – who may be the Power Rangers last hope against Dark Specter – are included among the prisoners. The final page concludes with a look at Dark Specter&#39;s Ranger army.

Dark Specter and co.&#39;s plan is so diabolical, that it&#39;s almost ingenious. In her days as Rita Repulsa, Mistress Vile knows better than anyone that the Power Rangers usually always come out on top in the end. There is always a Ranger from around the corner ready to foil her plans. Ergo, before any Ranger from any era or multiverse gets the change to spoil what she and Dark Specter have in store, she forces these Rangers on their side. Meanwhile, they imprison anyone who doesn&#39;t become a minion of there&#39;s. They made it a priority to neutralize their Ranger problem before any of the Power Rangers have the opportunity to intervene.
