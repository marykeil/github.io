# Naruto Only Kills One Villain in the Entire Series


## SUMMARY 



  Naruto, despite being a violent series, rarely kills its villains and promotes kindness and teamwork.   Naruto only directly kills one person throughout the series, a Sand Village jonin named Yura.   There is speculation that the death of Yura was actually caused by Pain, allowing Naruto to maintain his moral superiority.

## Literature Review

Naruto Uzumaki is involved in plenty of fights in the Naruto series, but he actually only kills a single villain during the entire story.




WARNING: The following contains SPOILERS for Naruto and Boruto.Despite defeating many a villain, Naruto&#39;s title character only directly kills one person in both the original series and Shippuden. It&#39;s no surprise that Naruto is violent and has included its share of blood, gore, and impalement. Fortunately, Naruto himself favors a far kinder philosophy that gives villains the chance to redeem themselves. Still though, Naruto did end up taking a life on his journey toward Hokage.




Shōnen Jump protagonists are rarely portrayed as murderers, often taking the high ground or showing their enemies mercy, promoting the magazine&#39;s values of kindness and teamwork. When villains do bite the dust in Shonen manga and anime, the story usually works around the issue, so the protagonist is not directly responsible for the death.

          

Naruto does exactly that after the fight against Pain, where the exuberant young lead ninja changes the villain&#39;s outlook and prompts Pain to sacrifice himself and revive all his previous victims. Even Kaguya Otsutsuki, the final villain of Naruto, was safely sealed away, rather than destroyed outright. It&#39;s this response to major threats that makes Naruto&#39;s one confirmed kill so surprising.


 Naruto&#39;s Only Killed One Person: A Sand Ninja Named Yura 
          




Despite defeating numerous enemies throughout his story, Naruto Uzumaki has only killed one person – a single Sand Village jonin named Yura. Yura was initially believed to be a trustworthy member of the Kazekage&#39;s council. However, it later was revealed that he was a secret agent acting on behalf of the Akatsuki. His memory was reactivated on the arrival of Sasori and Deidara. After Yura&#39;s espionage ends, Pain transforms him into an Itachi clone. Under the guise of the brother of Sasuke, Naruto, Kakashi, Sakura, and Chiyo face off against Yura, who eventually is killed by Naruto&#39;s Giant Rasengan technique. Viewers later see Yura&#39;s corpse, confirming his death.

                  Naruto &amp; Sakura&#39;s Only Date Proves Why They Deserved to Be Together   While Sakura finally ended up marrying Sasuke, fans believed she’d be better off with Naruto. But how would they get past their platonic connection?   

For a series that actively avoids showing Naruto as a killer, it&#39;s odd that the aspiring Hokage finishes off Yura when bigger, more despicable villains walk away with their lives intact - even if Naruto was under the impression he was fighting Itachi. Perhaps the Akatsuki puppet was considered a minor enough character that Naruto could destroy him without his morals being questioned, or maybe the death was meant to highlight Naruto&#39;s increased maturity after the time skip since the fight occurs at the very beginning of Naruto Shippuden.






 Naruto Has Killed More Than Yura in the Anime 
          

While Yura is the only canon kill under Naruto&#39;s belt, delving into the realm of filler opens up a few additional possibilities. For example, the Hidden Mist ninja Raiga was sent flying off a cliff by Naruto&#39;s signature jutsu Rasengan. Raiga actually committed suicide while falling, probably realizing the fall would kill him anyway, so Naruto perhaps isn&#39;t entirely responsible for Raiga&#39;s death. Furthermore, Naruto had a hand in the defeat of Urashiki Otsutsuki. This villain travels to the past in a Boruto filler arc to attack Naruto&#39;s younger self. Urashiki was destroyed thanks to the combined efforts of Naruto, Sasuke, Boruto, and Jiraiya, making Naruto jointly responsible for the character&#39;s demise in this non-canon adventure.






 Naruto&#39;s Helped Kill Many Villains But Rarely Dealt The Finishing Blow 
          

Ignoring the deaths caused by Naruto in filler material, Yura&#39;s death is an exception to the unwritten shonen rule that protagonists shouldn&#39;t be killers. Because of this, there has been some speculation that Pain&#39;s Shapeshifting jutsu had already claimed Yura&#39;s life and Naruto&#39;s big Rasengan merely broke the transformation and left a corpse behind. Although nothing in canon suggests this is the case, Yura being killed by Pain rather than Naruto would allow the title character to maintain his moral superiority by not landing the final blow. In official Naruto canon, however, Yura is the only character whose death was directly administered by Naruto himself.
