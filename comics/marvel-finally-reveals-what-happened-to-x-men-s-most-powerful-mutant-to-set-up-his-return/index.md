## Literature Review

Since Sons of X, Legion has been hiding from the Dominion-seeking Mother Righteous, and Uncanny Spider-Man #5 finally reveals where he escaped to.




Warning: contains spoilers for Uncanny Spider-Man #5After more than six months of not knowing the whereabouts of the X-Men&#39;s most powerful mutant, the reality-warping hero called Legion, David Haller finally reveals where he has hidden himself in the pages of Uncanny Spider-Man #5. After weeks of haunting Kurt Wagner, the white Bamf spirit that has accompanied Nightcrawler through his time as the Uncanny Spider-Man finally admits what Kurt has always known, that he is a piece of Legion.




Nightcrawler left Krakoa after a major confrontation with Mother Righteous, which ended with Legion disappearing into the aether, and since then has been operating as a vigilante in NYC, saving innocents and fighting Orchis.

          

Uncanny Spider-Man #5, from writer Si Spurrier and artists Lee Garbett and Simone Buonfantino, is a beautiful ending to a thoughtful limited series, reaffirming Nightcrawler&#39;s faith in the world, and finally revealing that Legion has been hidden in plain sight.


 Legion Is Hiding Within Nightcrawler&#39;s Heart &amp; Hopesword 
          

David Haller is a mutant with limitless powers and potential, a reality-warping Omega-level who can rewrite and shape the universe to his will, which he used to be a major villain when his mental illness was not under control. Gaining access to his vast powers was a major ploy by Mother Righteous in her attempt to reach Dominion, after confirming that one of the Sinisters will be the one to evolve to this cosmic state. In X-Men: Before the Fall - Sons of X Mother Righteous attempts to absorb Legion and his power after he thanks her, which gives her near complete power of someone.




Instead, Legion resisted and enacted a plan with his love Blindfold to escape from Mother Righteous and hide from her immense power. Furious, Mother Righteous declared this was impossible and that nothing was more powerful than faith... to which Nightcrawler corrects her, stating that hope is more powerful. Now, in Uncanny Spider-Man #5, it is revealed that this was literal, with Legion somehow hiding himself within Kurt&#39;s heart, and his Hopesword. Since Sons of X a mysterious all-white Bamf creature has been following - and annoying - Nightcrawler, and while he has guessed it was Legion, the Bamf finally admits that he is a fragment of one of Legion&#39;s many personalities.



 David Haller May Play A Major Role In Saving Mutantkind From Dominion 
          

Mother Righteous was convinced that David Haller&#39;s incredible power would be integral to her gaining Dominion status, beating her Sinister siblings, and evolving into a deity outside space and time. With Legion gone, Righteous has instead been attempting to gain power through manipulation of the White Hot Room and Jean Grey&#39;s Phoenix Force connection. If Mother Righteous was right, and Legion could have helped her reach Dominion, that means he could also play a major role in stopping the rise of Dominion, or at the very least the end of mutantkind through ascension.




Legion must remain hidden from Mother Righteous and other evil forces during the X-Men&#39;s brutal war with Orchis because the looming threat of Dominion is more dangerous than anything Orchis can throw at the mutants. Now that Nightcrawler knows that Legion is hiding within his heart, he knows that within him resides a powerful resource for the X-Men&#39;s cause, and potentially their only salvation if the Dominion forms and begins its world-ending ascension.

Uncanny Spider-Man #5 from Marvel Comics is available now in stores.
