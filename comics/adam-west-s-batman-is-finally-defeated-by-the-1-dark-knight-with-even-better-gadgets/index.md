## Literature Review

The Adam West version of Batman may be the most prepared Caped Crusader, but he meets his match when facing one Batman with an outrageous gadget.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman #140!Adam West&#39;s Batman may be known throughout the DC multiverse for his highly innovative gadgets, but he&#39;s finally been defeated by one more-prepared Dark Knight. A battle of wills explodes in Bruce Wayne&#39;s mind when he&#39;s forced to fight sinister variants of himself. But Batman defeats his 1966 doppelganger with an extremely specific gadget.




In Batman #140 by Chip Zdarsky and Jorge JimÃ©nez, Bruce is trapped in his mind and fighting dozens of Zur-En-Arrh variants of famous Batmen from across the multiverse. The evil doppelgangers have the upper hand and try to convince Bruce to join their crusade.

          

Batman chooses to fight and takes them down one by one. Eventually, he faces off against a corrupted version of Batman &#39;66, who utilizes his Bat-Shield in combat. But Bruce is several steps ahead of his opponent and uses a specialized weapon: Anti-Bat-Shield Razors. The razors effortlessly destroy the shield and bests Adam West&#39;s version of Batman.


 Adam West&#39;s Batman is Defeated with Specific Bat-Weaponry 
          




For some time now, Batman has been plagued by his backup personality, the Batman of Zur-En-Arrh. The sinister alter ego has been pushing Batman, driving him to isolate himself from the Bat-Family, which he succeeded in after the events of &#34;Gotham War&#34;. With Bruce on his own, Zur-En-Arrh pushed Batman even further to track down and finally kill the Joker. However, once the Caped Crusader tracked down the Clown Prince of Crime, Zur-En-Arrh took over, leaving Bruce trapped in his mind. However, he wasn&#39;t alone as Bruce&#39;s mind contained Zur-En-Arrh counterparts of nearly every Batman in the multiverse.

Batman previously met Adam West&#39;s Caped Crusader when Bruce was journeying across the multiverse chasing down the Joker variant, Red Mask. Bruce even complimented Batman &#39;66, highlighting how prepared he was with the foresight to include anti-shark repellent in his utility belt. While the Adam West that Bruce faces here isn&#39;t the same Batman &#39;66, but rather a twisted copycat, he utilizes similar gadgetry, such as the Bat-Shield. This version of Adam West&#39;s Batman is taken down by an extremely specific gadget, making this victory for the Prime Batman not just a decent feat, but an ironic one at that.






 Batman Uses Adam West&#39;s Best Trick Against Him 
          

The beloved 1966 Batman show often had the hero use extremely specific weaponry that helped him get out of any jam he encountered. Amusingly, he&#39;s taken down the same way by the Prime Batman pulling out razors specifically designed for the Bat-Shield. It&#39;s not that Bruce actually had those razors specially designed (this battle is in Bruce&#39;s head, after all). But he recognized that Batman &#39;66 could only be defeated in the same way that Adam West&#39;s Batman defeated his opponents: with unbelievably particular weapons. It might be a ludicrous battle, but it worked and gave Batman a victory over his Adam West variant.

Batman #140 is on sale now from DC Comics.
