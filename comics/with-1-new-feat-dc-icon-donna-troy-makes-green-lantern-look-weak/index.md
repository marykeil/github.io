## Literature Review

In a display of unmatched willpower, Wonder Girl Donna Troy outshines Green Lantern&#39;s abilities with a single feat, proving she&#39;s worthy of a Ring.




Warning: Potential Spoilers for Titans: Beast World #3!




In a stunning display, Wonder Girl Donna Troy has showcased a level of willpower that would undoubtedly put all Green Lanterns to shame. This remarkable feat solidifies her standing as one of the strongest heroes, both mentally and physically, in the expansive DC Universe and also serves as a compelling argument for why Donna should be the next Green Lantern in DC.

In Titans: Beast World #3 by Tom Taylor and Lucas Meyer, the ongoing narrative unfolds with DCU&#39;s heroes relentlessly combating the human-animal hybrids that have emerged in DC&#39;s latest crisis event, Beast World. This crisis witnessed Beast Boy&#39;s transformation into Garro, a manifestation of the intergalactic beast Starro, to confront the malevolent Necrostar.

          

Unfortunately, Beast Boy lost himself during this transformative process and is now trapped in the Garro form, unleashing spores that transform heroes, villains, and civilians into uncontrollable and volatile animal hybrids. As Garro approaches Earth, Donna Troy emerges as the singular hero capable of holding him at bay.





 Wonder Girl Proves She Has a Will Stronger Than Green Lantern 


          

In his Garro form, Beast Boy has already disseminated his transformative spores across Earth from space, signaling his imminent touchdown. As other DC heroes grapple to thwart Beast Boy&#39;s approach, Raven calls upon Donna to face the colossal threat. Armed with her formidable Lasso of Persuasion, Wonder Girl accomplishes the seemingly impossible feat of single-handedly restraining Garro, stalling his impending descent to Earth. This awe-inspiring moment leaves no doubt that “Donna Troy’s will is iron” and also positions her at a level that rivals even the indomitable will of a Green Lantern, a testament to her unparalleled strength of character.

This exceptional feat establishes Donna as an unparalleled force, accomplishing what even a dozen A-List heroes, including a Green Lantern, could not achieve. Prior to Wonder Girl&#39;s intervention, powerhouses like Superman, Raven, Green Lantern Alan Scott, Shazam, and others were engaged in a formidable battle to hold Garro at bay. Despite their combined strength and powers, Beast Boy continued to inexorably inch his way toward Earth. However, in a display of immense willpower, Donna manages to single-handedly halt Garro&#39;s progress. This pivotal moment shakes the foundation of the established hierarchy of DC&#39;s superheroes and prompts contemplation about Donna&#39;s standing among her peers.

 Donna Troy Could be DC’s Next Green Lantern 
          

While some may attribute Wonder Girl&#39;s jaw-dropping display of willpower to the intrinsic power of her Lasso of Persuasion, it&#39;s essential to note that the lasso&#39;s strength is inherently tied to the will of its wielder. Acknowledging that Alan Scott, with assistance, couldn&#39;t successfully hold off Garro, Donna&#39;s unprecedented level of willpower becomes even more apparent. This revelation positions her as an ideal candidate to assume the mantle of a Green Lantern. Considering the ongoing crisis event, marked by potential casualties, the likelihood of Wonder Girl stepping into the role of the next Green Lantern is now more plausible than ever.
