## Literature Review

Cosplayer J9lives shared a throwback Rogue look on Instagram, showcasing why the Avengers recruited the mega-powerful mutant hero into their ranks.




Rogue is one of the most powerful members of the X-Men, leading to her recruitment into the ranks of the Avengers – in a throwback post on Instagram, cosplayer Janine (@j9lives) showcased Rogue&#39;s powerhouse abilities, with her rendition of the character triumphantly posing atop the head of a destroyed Sentinel.

Before she was an X-Man or an Avenger, Rogue was a villain. First appearing in Avengers Annual #10 – by Chris Claremont and Michael Golden – Rogue used her energy absorption powers on Ms. Marvel Carol Danvers, permanently giving Rogue the power of flight, super-strength, enhanced speed and invulnerability. Rogue proved to be a formidable opponent when fighting the X-Men alongside Mystique and Destiny, but would later seek Charles Xavier’s help, with the remnants of Carol Danvers’ psyche still trapped in her head. Rogue was eventually granted membership into the X-Men, and had to prove herself to her former enemies in an effort to win their trust.




Following the conflict that broke out between the two teams in Avengers vs. X-Men, Rogue joined the Avengers Unity Team – the merged team created in the aftermath to improve X-Men/Avengers relations – in the pages of Uncanny Avengers. Working alongside heroes like Captain America and Thor, Rogue’s journey officially came full circle: having started out as a villain fighting the Avengers, Rogue now joined the team, cementing her as one of the most prominent heroes in the Marvel Universe. More recently, Rogue has joined the newest iteration of the Avengers Unity Squad, formed in the aftermath of the Hellfire Gala massacre to fight the Orchis organization.

While Rogue&#39;s look has changed over the years, the Jim Lee design embodied by cosplayer Janine is certainly her most enduring, memorable style – and Janine&#39;s rendition of the character&#39;s classic outfit more than does its source material justice. More than that, her epic collaboration with photographer Ryan Sims firmly depicts Rogue&#39;s power level, and her confidence in her strength, by having Janine standing on the severed head of a Sentinel, lit by the flaming wreckage of the rest of the mutant-hunting machine in the background. With no other heroes in sight, it is apparent Rogue took this one down singlehandedly, an ability which makes her a much sought after member of the X-Men and Avengers alike.
