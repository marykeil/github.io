## SUMMARY 



  Superman&#39;s Chinese counterpart, Super-Man, is brought back to life thanks to Clark Kent&#39;s secret death-defying life force.   Superman&#39;s secret identity has caused psychic attacks for anyone who learns it, almost killing Perry White.

## Literature Review

If it were ever in doubt how powerful Superman is, his ally Super-Man confirms it by using Clark Kentâ€™s power to escape an untimely death.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1059!DC Comics has once and for all confirmed that Superman is an immortal being. The Man of Steel&#39;s Chinese counterpart Super-Man nearly buys the farm after a psychic attack puts him in grave danger. But Kenan Kong manages to return to life all thanks to Clark Kent&#39;s secret death-defying life force.




In Action Comics #1059&#39;s story &#34;Secret Identity Part Two&#34; by Gene Luen Yang and Viktor Bogdanovic, Super-Man is in a state between life and death thanks to the mental attack brought on by learning Superman&#39;s secret identity. In this state, however, Kenan meets his old mentor, I-Ching.

          

After fooling Super-Man into believing he was actually dead, I-Ching reminds Kenan that his American counterpart has conquered death numerous times before and Kenan&#39;s life force is intrinsically tied with Superman&#39;s. Kenan guides his qi through the Eight Trigrams of Bagua as he did when he first became Super-Man and comes back to life, much to the relief of the Super-Family.


 Super-Man Just Secretly Confirmed Superman&#39;s Immortality 
          




In a moment that stunned the world, Superman revealed his identity as Clark Kent. Heroes and villains alike were shocked, but none more than Lex Luthor. After stewing for a bit, Lex decided to put the genie back in the bottle by using Manchester Black&#39;s psychic abilities to make the world forget Superman&#39;s real name. However, now anytime someone is confronted with that information, they experience a strong psychic attack, something that nearly killed Superman&#39;s old boss Perry White. Unfortunately, Kenan found that out the hard way when he accidentally discovered Superman&#39;s identity, triggering a psychic attack in his mind.

When Kenan gained his powers, he was infused with Superman&#39;s qi, or life force. This gave him Clark&#39;s powers (though Kenan had to master his abilities by channeling his own qi through the Eight Trigrams). During Kenan&#39;s brief time with his former mentor, I-Ching raised a good point: Superman has defied death plenty of times, including his infamous revival after fighting Doomsday. While it&#39;s never been officially listed as one of Clark&#39;s powers, the event presented here is one of the strongest arguments that Clark is immortal. After all, if Super-Man&#39;s power is strong enough to prevent him from crossing into the afterlife, then so is Superman&#39;s.






 DC Confirms That Superman is Virtually Unkillable 
          

Superman&#39;s longevity has never really been in doubt as alternate Earths and potential futures have shown Clark easily living centuries if not thousands of years. But Kenan&#39;s near-death experience highlights an important aspect of Superman&#39;s abilities. It&#39;s not just that Clark has an extended lifespan, it&#39;s that Superman has the power to will himself back to life. A shocking discovery, sure, but a welcome one. This means no matter what an enemy throws at Clark, no matter how gravely he&#39;s injured, Superman is just too powerful to cross into the afterlife.

Action Comics #1059 is on sale now from DC Comics.
