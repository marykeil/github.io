# Chainsaw Man s Most Breathtaking Moment Has an Incredibly Dark Origin


## SUMMARY 



  Chainsaw Man uses the image of praying astronauts to evoke the fear of space and darkness, drawing a connection to real-life tragedies like the Apollo 1 incident.   The bisected astronauts represent humanity&#39;s lack of control over the unknown darkness of space, emphasizing the theme of fear in the manga.   The image of fallen astronauts serves as a warning about the horrors of space and the importance of taking them seriously, aligning with Chainsaw Man&#39;s overall thematic exploration of fear.

## Literature Review

The Darkness Devil&#39;s debut panel may be connected to a photo of the Apollo 1 astronauts praying over a miniature space shuttle.




Tatsuki Fujimoto&#39;s Chainsaw Man is known for its over-the-top action and brutal scenes of gore, yet it has always maintained a sense of thematic layering beneath its eye-catching panels. Chainsaw Man tackles various themes including love, change, and most of all, fear. Nowhere is that clearer than the series’ most jaw-dropping panel, which makes no attempt to hide Fujimoto’s message about fear.




In chapter 64 of Chainsaw Man, the international assassin known as “Santa Claus” succeeds in using her former apprentice to fulfill a contract with the Darkness Devil, who is one of Chainsaw Man&#39;s mysterious Primal Devils.

          

Since the entire cast was transported to Hell prior, the Darkness Devil manifests itself completely. As it makes its debut, the Darkness Devil is preceded by a hall of bisected astronauts with their hands joined in prayer. This image is horrifying and may seem completely random at first glance, but it likely references an extremely dark event in human history.


 Chainsaw Man&#39;s Most Iconic Panel is Based on Apollo 1 
          




It&#39;s possible this page is referencing an image of the Apollo 1 crew, consisting of Ed White, Gus Grissom, and Roger B. Chaffee. In the photo, the three astronauts hold their hands in prayer as a joke over a miniature of the Apollo 1. On January 27, 1967, these three astronauts were tragically killed when the shuttle caught fire during a test launch. This wouldn&#39;t be the first time Chainsaw Man based its controversial villains in real-world tragedies. It seems unlikely that Fujimoto using the imagery of praying astronauts is a coincidence.

All devils in the world of Chainsaw Man are powered by the fear that humanity has for the aspect of reality they represent, and the image of fallen astronauts is seemingly intended to evoke the fear of space and, by extension, darkness. The explosion and destruction caused by a failed space shuttle test conjurs all of humanity&#39;s fears associated with space - the idea of being trapped, being alone, and being struck down in the attempt to even reach a void that will ultimately consume everything.




                  One Popular Chainsaw Man Hero Was Actually Inspired By South Park   Chainsaw Man has a lot of Western influences and references, and a surprising South Park character was inspiration for one of the heroes.   

Space is treated as the final frontier yet is also the ultimate darkness that surrounds humanity at all times. The Darkness Devil being heralded by the appearance of fallen astronauts is a warning, just like Chainsaw Man Part 2&#39;s Primal Devil&#39;s introduction was heralded by people falling. Fujimoto uses the image of praying astronauts to drive home the idea that space and the horrors it holds are not to be taken lightly.



 Chainsaw Man&#39;s Bisected Astronauts Represent Fear of the Unkown 
          

Metaphorically, Chainsaw Man&#39;s astronauts are adventurers into darkness who hoped for the best and found the worst. Space contains the unknown, and the Darkness Devil&#39;s entourage represents the idea of humanity&#39;s lack of control of the vast night, whether it references the Apollo 1 photo or not.




Chainsaw Man’s most famous panel is connected to the manga&#39;s themes of fear. The most common devils in Chainsaw Man are ones that represent physical weapons, yet the powerful devils are more abstract. These include Chainsaw Man&#39;s Four Horsemen Devils of Famine, Control, Death, and War as well as Primal Devils like the Darkness Devil. The fear of darkness is intrinsic to the human experience, and seeing as how the Chainsaw Man’s Darkness Devil is the terrifying culmination of that fear, it makes sense for it to be represented by referencing a real-life tragedy that saw those fears come true.
