# X-Men s New Era Needs to Address The Plot Thread of Marvel s First Ever Mutant


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel&#39;s first ever mutant, Tad Carter, debuted in Amazing Adult Fantasy #14, possessing fantastic powers such as flight and telepathy.   Tad&#39;s character was forgotten and later brought back in X-Men: The Hidden Years, where he joined a mutant group called the Promise.   Tad&#39;s powerful abilities could greatly benefit the X-Men, but his current whereabouts and status remain unknown, leading to speculation that he may be dead.

## Literature Review

The X-Men are entering a new era, one that needs the help of Marvel&#39;s first mutant (it&#39;s not Apocalypse or the Sub-Mariner).




The X-Men’s new era needs to address the plot thread of Marvel’s first ever mutant. While mutants such as Apocalypse or Namor the Sub-Mariner are often regarded as forerunners of mutants, they are not the first Marvel characters to be called such. That honor goes to ordinary Tad Carter, who first appeared in 1962’s Amazing Adult Fantasy #14, roughly a year before the X-Men debuted and changed the face of comics forever.




Tad Carter debuted in a five-page story, written by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, titled “The Man in the Sky,” appearing in Amazing Adult Fantasy #14. Tad’s parents had been exposed to radiation during trials for the atomic bomb, which caused Tad to be born with fantastic powers, such as flight and telepathy. Tad is hated by those around him, despite his good intentions. “The Man in the Sky” ends with a mysterious presence reaching out to Tad, telling him he is a “mutant” and they are “the future.”

          

The presence offers Tad a place to call home until humanity “comes of age.”


 Tad Carter Should Occupy A Larger Role in Marvel History 
          




After this story ran, it was promptly forgotten. In interviews, neither Lee nor Ditko ever mentioned it. Marvel history is littered with characters, created just before the dawn of the Marvel Age, that would serve as prototypes for the icons to come. For instance, Doctor Droom (later Doctor Druid) was a Doctor Strange prototype, right down to the origin. Many of these characters would later carry over into the Marvel Universe, and Tad Carter was no exception, returning in the pages of X-Men: The Hidden Years, almost thirty years after his first appearance.

X-Men: The Hidden Years, written and drawn by John Byrne, brought Tad back, revealing that the mysterious voice who beckoned to him was another mutant named Tobias Messenger. Messenger recruited Tad to his group, called the Promise, and later tried to use Tad to recruit Havok and Polaris. Messenger’s plan backfired, and Tad turned on him. After Messenger’s defeat, Tad was offered a spot on the X-Men, but he declined….and has not been seen since. A great deal has happened to Earth’s mutant community since Tad last appeared, such as M-Day and the rise (and fall) of Krakoa. Through it all, Tad has not been seen.

 Tad Carter Could Be a Huge Asset to the X-Men 
          

Tad’s brief appearances established that he was a very powerful mutant, with many fantastic powers that would be of great benefit to the X-Men. In the wake of the attack on the Hellfire Gala, Earth’s mutants are in full survival mode, and Tad’s powers could tip the odds in the X-Men’s favor. He made it clear in his appearance in X-Men: The Hidden Years he wished to spend time on his own, and he has managed to somehow remain off their radar ever since.

It is possible that Tad Carter is dead, which would explain why the X-Men have shown no interest in finding Marvel’s first mutant, despite his great power.
