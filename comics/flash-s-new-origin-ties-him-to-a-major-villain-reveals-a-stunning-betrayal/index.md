## Literature Review

In a huge retcon to the Flash&#39;s origin, Jay Garrick&#39;s mentor is revealed to be a villain, and the entirety of S.T.A.R Labs is implied to be corrupt!




Warning: Spoilers for Jay Garrick: The Flash (2023) #4 ahead!




Jay Garrick - the original Flash - has just seen his origin story undergo a major retcon that has dire implications for the greater DC Universe. Not only is his original mentor, Professor Hughes, revealed to be the villainous Dr. Elemental, but it turns out that S.T.A.R Labs has been corrupt from the very beginning.

Jay Garrick: The Flash (2023) #4 by Jeremy Adams, Diego Olortegui, and Luis Guerrero explores the journal of Professor Hughes, the man whose experiment first transformed Jay into the Flash. Not only does it turn out that the &#34;accidental&#34; chemical spill that gave Jay his powers was in fact deliberate sabotage on Hughes&#39; part, but Hughes&#39; role as the villainous Doctor Elemental is confirmed.

          

Worse yet, Hughes is shown to be a silent partner who funded S.T.A.R Labs, quietly leeching off their metahuman research to conduct his own twisted experiments.




                  Jay Garrick: The Flash #1 Is the Loving Reinvention DC&#39;s Original Speedster Deserves (Review)   Jay Garrick: The Flash #1 by Jeremy Adams and Diego Olortegui brings a long-lost pair of heroes together for a heartwarming tale about family.   


 DC&#39;s Biggest Metahuman Research Center Is A Lie 


          

First appearing in Len Wein, Curt Swan, and Murphy Anderson&#39;s Superman (1939) #246, S.T.A.R Labs has been the center of metahuman research in the DC Universe for more than half a century. Not only is it a tech company that rivals LexCorp, Kord Industries, and Terrifitech, it is often the first resource Earth&#39;s heroes turn to for solving superscience and metahuman-based problems. While it has long appeared in the background doings of DC Comics, S.T.A.R Labs rose to even greater fame due to its prominence in The CW&#39;s Arrowverse shows (The Flash in particular).




This retcon implies that each time S.T.A.R Labs has helped DC&#39;s heroes, whether with recovery after a long battle or working on tech to enhance their abilities, all of that research has gone straight to Doctor Elemental. Considering that S.T.A.R Labs most often works with such powerhouses as the Flash Family and Superman, it goes a long way to explain the incredible breadth of Doctor Elemental&#39;s powers: he&#39;s had decades of research into DC&#39;s most powerful heroes to perfect his abilities. Every time there&#39;s a crossover or Crisis that requires S.T.A.R Labs&#39; aid, he grows more powerful.



 S.T.A.R Labs Is No Longer The Crown Jewel of DC Science 
          

While the loss of S.T.A.R Labs is a terrible blow to DC&#39;s superhero community, it is not one that has gone unheralded or unanswered: instead, Supercorp and Steelworks appear poised to take its place as DC&#39;s main metahuman research centers. Regardless of what fills the vacuum, this breach of trust has absolutely shattered everything readers have known about not only the first Flash&#39;s origin, but a beloved DC institution as well.
