## Literature Review

Twenty years after Peanuts premiered, creator Charles Schulz was still improving his formula, creating new characters and reinventing his best gags.




Iconic America comic strip Peanuts debuted in 1950, and continued until 1999 – meaning the seventies represents the mid-point of the strip&#39;s enduring run, a time when creator Charles Schulz&#39; strip can be said both to have found its form and hit its stride. The &#39;70s was a decade of expansion for Peanuts, as gave Snoopy new brothers and sisters, fleshed out Franklin, and introduced more classic characters.
By the 1970s, Peanuts was already beloved comic strip, but Charles Schulz&#39;s stories from the decade kept his fandom from the 1950s and 1960s reading, while bringing in new young fans, setting him up for a huge boom of success in the 1980s. The comic showed no signs of slowing down or stopping, still introducing new characters, new situations, and keeping old gags feeling fresh. There&#39;s a reason that the series still has a lot of love seventy years after its start, and decades after it ended. Below are 10 classic Peanuts strips from the 1970s, featuring one hilarious punchline after another.









 








 10  Tomorrow Is Already Today, Charlie Brown 
August 12, 1972 One of the great balances of Peanuts that keeps it fresh is a balance between heart-warming, family-friendly comedy, and, for lack of a better word, nihilism. This 1972 panel finds the perennially unlucky Charlie Brown attempting to have some optimism, telling himself that &#34;maybe tomorrow will be a better day.&#34; The possibility of this is dispelled, however, by his friend Linus van Pelt, who provides an existential response to Charlie, which brings them right back to pessimism. &#34;In some parts of the world, tomorrow is already today, and today is yesterday,&#34; he says, &#34;if tomorrow is already today, Charlie Brown, there&#39;s no way that tomorrow can be a better day.&#34;





 9  Sally Brown Is A Critics&#39; Critic 
June 27, 1976
        

Charlie Brown&#39;s little sister Sally loves practicing her handwriting. She is featured writing cards and letters in many Peanuts comics. Here, she&#39;s on a letter-writing campaign against all the media critics she knows who disagree with her youthful opinions. While sometimes Sally seems uneducated, at other points she can be depicted as being wise beyond her years. In this strip, she&#39;s preoccupied with sending rude letters to critics, insulting their intelligence in the process, which is very childish. However, when she turns to her brother, she asks if there&#39;s anyone she can blast for him, suggesting that she knows exactly what she&#39;s doing.

 8  Charlie Brown Insults Lucy For Once 
November 29, 1978
        

Lucy van Pelt insults Charlie Brown every chance that she gets. She pulls away the football, she steals his money during unlicensed psychiatric sessions, she foils him during baseball games, she even puts her dirty hands in his glass of milk. Poor Charlie Brown has accepted this abuse over the years, but rarely gets a chance to strike back. Here, he does so accidentally. In the previous comic, he asked Lucy if she had self-doubts as he does, which gave her a good laugh. Here, the usually confident Lucy realizws that not everyone thinks she&#39;s as perfect as she finds herself, which proves to be the ultimate insult. 





 7  It&#39;s A Rain Delay, Charlie Brown 
April 9, 1972
        

Peanuts strips often take the reader for a ride, but this strip is truly a journey. Everything going wrong at a Charlie Brown baseball game is nothing new. In fact, rain canceling the game is sometimes a mercy for his team, who are known for their less-than-stellar record. After arguing with his teammates regarding whether they should call the game, or keep playing, Charlie Brown takes Lucy&#39;s advice and goes to see his psychiatrist – Lucy. While it is still raining, Charlie Brown pours out his heart, only to get interrupted. Instead of her telling him an insult, Lucy is upset that she&#39;s out in the middle of such a downpour.





 6  Peppermint Patty Beats The Boys 
Septemberr 27, 1979
        

Charles Schulz was a close friend of female tennis icon Billie Jean King, and supported Title IX, a law from 1972 establishing equality in women&#39;s sports in American schools. Even before the 1970s, Peanuts featured girls and boys playing alongside each other in the comics, with Charlie Brown&#39;s baseball team almost equally split in gender. Peppermint Patty was the definitive sporty girl of Peanuts, who could easily wipe out the boys in any competition, as she does here. The setup makes it sound like Charlie and Linus are concerned that girls would get hurt playing with the boys, but with Patty on the field, the punchline reveals that they&#39;re the ones in danger.

 5  Lucy Thrives On Schroeder&#39;s Encouragement 
March 15, 1972
        

In her time on Charlie Brown&#39;s baseball team, Lucy has been more of a thorn in his side than MVP. This comic suggests she really can score a run if given the appropriate motivation. In the next few comics after this one, Lucy really does get that home run, and Schroeder puckers up at home base, just like he promised. However, she turns him down, telling Schroeder that if he is only kissing her for the bet, she&#39;ll pass. It bears remembering in any Peanuts baseball story, Lucy is much better than she tends to let on, suggesting that she just needs an incentive to actually play.





 4  Charlie Brown Actually Kicks The Football...Almost 
August 2 1979
        

The football gag is undoubtedly one of Peanuts&#39; most famous. In July 1979, an entire month was dedicated to a storyline about Charlie Brown getting sick and needing to stay in the hospital. While all of the characters missed him, sending him flowers and visiting, Lucy seemed to have been hit the hardest by his absence. Lucy even publicly swore that if Charlie Brown got better, she&#39;d let him kick the football. Upon his discharge, the van Pelt home was Charlie&#39;s first visit. Of course, because he&#39;s Charlie Brown, his one chance at glory still goes awry – he kicks Lucy instead, proving her altruism misguided.

 3  Charlie Brown&#39;s Idea Of &#34;Riotous Living&#34; 
January 16, 1970
        

Older generations often speak nostalgically about how far money used to go, but a quarter still wasn&#39;t worth much in 1970. It might have bought Charlie Brown a comic book or a candy bar. In this context, his reply in this strip, that he would immediately spend 25 cents on &#34;riotous living&#34; is particularly hilarious. Either he thinks getting himself a single treat is absolute hedonism, or he has delivered straight-faced sarcasm at its finest. Appropriately enough, it may be a coin flip: humble Charlie has always appreciated the most minor of compliments, but he also regularly performed elaborate sarcastic rituals when feeding Snoopy.





 2  Linus Tries To Recruit For The Great Pumpkin Cult 
October 29 1973
        

Marcie was introduced to the comic just two years before this 1973 strip, making friends with future best friend Peppermint Patty at summer camp. A kid from across town, along with Peppermint Patty and Franklin, Marcie didn&#39;t interact as much with other characters beyond Charlie Brown. This rare conversation between Marcie and Linus shows that while he&#39;d love for the lore of the Great Pumpkin to travel far and wide, the gossip about him is actually what&#39;s spreading. With her perfect unassuming tone, Marcie cuts him short. Four years after this, in 1977, Marcie actually would sit with Linus in the pumpkin patch on Halloween night. Her parents quickly came and got her, and she joked about being &#34;deprogrammed&#34; afterward.





 1  Lucy Actually Does Have Some Answers 
January 19, 1974
        

Given the nature of a lot of her psychiatric advice, it&#39;s clear Lucy is in practice for money, rather than helping people. However, this comic, where she counsels Snoopy, actually has some good advice. In a monologue that still feels relevant today, Lucy says that Snoopy is nervous because he lives in a world where people can know so much that they can&#39;t control, feeling like they know everything and yet nothing important. Decades before doomscrolling became a phenomenon, people still struggled with the feeling that the world was full of nonstop bad news. Naturally, before this classic Peanuts comic gets too heavy, Lucy makes sure to try to collect her fee from her patient, a dog.
