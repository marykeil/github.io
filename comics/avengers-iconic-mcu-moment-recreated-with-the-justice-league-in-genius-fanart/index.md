## Literature Review

In genius art, the Justice League take over the Avengers&#39; iconic MCU pose, offering a glimpse into a world where DC got to the movies first.




While the Avengers are household names today, Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes began life as a clear attempt to recreate the success of their DC predecessors, the Justice League. Now, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman&#39;s group is getting its own back by swiping the most famous cinematic pose of Marvel&#39;s Mightiest Heroes.




In a post shared to Instagram, comic creator Kerry Callen revealed a commission in which the Justice League adopt the iconic MCU group shot from 2012&#39;s The Avengers. The art builds on an earlier creation from Callen which depicted the Avengers pose but with each of the heroes in their original comic costume, showing how drastically they have changed over the years and for their big-screen debuts.


 

There are some genuinely fun details in Callen&#39;s art, which goes above and beyond in capturing the pose from the movies. Green Arrow replaces fellow archer Hawkeye, while the Martian Manhunter takes the Hulk&#39;s place as the team&#39;s towering green hero. Superman swaps places with the godly Thor, while Wonder Woman takes Black Widow&#39;s position - with her iconic bracers replacing the super-spy&#39;s gun.

 Justice League Art Reimagines the MCU with DC Heroes 
Neither Team&#39;s Original Roster Made It to the Big Screen
          

Interestingly, neither the Justice League or Avengers teams shown are accurate to comic history. The Justice League officially launched with seven members - Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter, and Aquaman - here, the King of Atlantis is missing while Green Arrow replaces his fellow Hard-Traveling Hero. In contrast, the original Avengers were Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, the Wasp and Ant-Man, with Captain America joining soon after, Hawkeye gaining membership in the team&#39;s iconic second roster (nicknamed Cap&#39;s Kooky Quarter), and Black Widow only officially joining later, after initially encountering the team as a villain.




Neither original roster fully survived to their respective movies, with 2017&#39;s Justice League bringing in Cyborg (more famous as a member of the Titans) while jettisoning the Martian Manhunter and Green Lantern, and the MCU never having the original Wasp and Ant-Man (Janet van Dyne and Hank Pym) officially join the Avengers roster, instead aging them into mentor figures for the next generation.

It&#39;s surprising that in their big movie shared universes, neither team&#39;s original roster made it through unscathed, despite proving themselves capable of sustaining decades of successful stories. However, this makes Callen&#39;s art even more fun - it&#39;s easy to imagine this image as coming from a different world where the Justice League hit big screens before the Avengers, birthing an MCU-level movie franchise that wasn&#39;t shaped as a deliberate alternative to Marvel&#39;s style.
