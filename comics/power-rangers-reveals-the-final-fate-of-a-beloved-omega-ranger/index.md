## Literature Review

A future timeline reveals that the first non-human member of the Omega Power Rangers eventually earns a rank well beyond just being a Ranger.




Warning: Spoilers for Ranger Academy #3!Yale of Saard, the fourth Omega Blue Ranger, is destined to lead a life beyond just being one of the Power Rangers in the future. Yale is the feline-esque alien unexpectedly connected to the Morphin Grid, who first met Trini, Zack, and Jason in Go Go Power Rangers #31. Yale eventually replaces Kiya as the Omega team&#39;s Blue Ranger in Power Rangers #10.




Those wondering what will happen to Yale once his Ranger days are behind him need to look no further than Ranger Academy #3 Maria Ingrande Mora, Jo Mi-Gyeong, Fabiana Mascolo, and Ed Dukeshire. The series follows a group of new-age teenagers with attitude as they go to school to become the next generation of Power Rangers.



          

More interesting than this unexpected turn of events for Yale is just how perfectly it ties into his journey as a whole. Anyone familiar with the origin story of the first four-legged Power Ranger will know how his unexpected role as teacher is an example of Yale once again rising from adversity.

Yale&#39;s tragic origin began when he was born as the runt of his litter. This made him small and meek, but helped him gain a sense of peace and love by being doted on by his mother. His family were captured by hunters, and he blamed himself for failing to protect them. He&#39;d soon care for a young boy until his parents shunned Yale for scaring them. His connection to the Morphin Grid gained the attention of Trini, Zack, and Jason. When he lost that connection, he was forced to simply roam their ship, practically as their pet, until he was finally called to complete the Morphin Grid&#39;s circle, dubbing him the Blue Ranger. There he became a valuable member of the team, taking part in fights and even piloting Zords.

Flash forward to several centuries into the future, where surprisingly enough, Yale is still alive, likely thanks to his alien physiology. Ranger Academy&#39;s main character, Sage, is investigating her father&#39;s mysterious past as a former Ranger Academy resident. It takes her to the library, where, in an attempt to talk to the head librarian, she interrupts a conversation between him and two familiar professors: Anubis &#34;Doggie&#34; Cruger of Power Rangers SPD fame and Yale (whom Sage mistakes for a pet, as so many others have in the past).

Yale was always someone who has been underestimated since the moment he was born. His biggest tragedy is that he carries the burden of constantly losing the people he loves time and time again, but as Yale is referred to in Power Rangers #10, he&#39;s &#34;the missing piece of the puzzle&#34; for the Omega Rangers. Now, the four-legged hero is a missing piece for Ranger Academy. Often viewed as a mere pet, Yale of Saard has proven he can be a Blue Ranger, pilot Zords, and as a professor, carry the next generation of Power Rangers into the future.



Ranger Academy #3 is available now from BOOM! Studios.
