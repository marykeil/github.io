# Spider-Verse s Most Disturbing  Hero  Is Reborn in Nightmare Fuel Miles Morales Redesign


## SUMMARY 



  Miles Morales now has his own version of a disturbing hero called Spiders-Man, who is made up of a collective hive mind of spiders.   The cover art for Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13, created by Peach Momoko, showcases the darker side of the Marvel Universe.   This new iteration of Spiders-Man, with spiders comprising the costume itself, adds an even creepier spin to the concept and could potentially become a permanent addition to the Spider-Verse.

## Literature Review

Spiders-Man - the Spider-Verse antihero literally made of spiders - gets an even grosser transformation thanks to Miles Morales.




After a tragic death early this year, one of the Spider-Verse&#39;s greatest (and most disturbing) heroes has been given a new life, this time as a variant of Miles Morales&#39; Spider-Man rather than Peter Parker&#39;s. As revealed in chilling new art, Miles Morales now has his very own version of Spiders-Man - a collective hive mind of spiders that make up a singular superhero.




Miles Morales&#39; own version of Spiders-Man can be seen in a variant cover for Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13. The cover is one of a collection of variants by revered artist Peach Momoko (who shared the art on Instagram), highlighting the darker side of the Marvel Universe.


 

Momoko&#39;s Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13 cover is part of a collection of Nightmare variant covers which hit shelves over December. In the variant series, Momoko portrays dark, creepy renditions of some of Marvel&#39;s most important heroes in her signature style. Other heroes getting the Nightmare treatment include the Incredible Hulk, Doctor Strange, the Immortal Thor, and Black Panther in their own flagship titles.

The Hero Made of Spiders Makes a Triumphant Return
          

Spiders-Man was introduced in Spider-Geddon, the sequel to the original massive Spider-Verse event. In Spider-Geddon #3 by Christos Gage, Dan Slott, Carlo Barberi, Todd Nauck, JosÃ© Marzan Jr., and David Curiel, readers were first introduced to the Web-Slinger made up of numerous tiny wall-crawlers. Spiders-Man was born when the Peter Parker of Earth-11580 toured Horizon Labs, where he fell into a giant colony of radioactive spiders. Though Peter was eaten alive, the spiders underwent a strange transformation in the process: they became a hive-mind carrying Peter&#39;s personality. The spiders then donned a Spider-Man suit, becoming a hero of their own - seemingly with no clue they were no longer human.

Momoko&#39;s design of a Nightmare version of Miles Morales&#39; Spider-Man strongly resembles Peter Parker&#39;s Spiders-Man with one strong distinction: this time, rather than being a collection of spiders stuffed inside a costume, the spiders comprise the costume itself. The design is a massive construct of smaller spiders resembling Miles&#39; black-and-red Spider-Man costume. It&#39;s an unnerving look, with the spiders broken up by streams of blood red and large, gooey eyes that resemble those of Venom or Carnage. Momoko&#39;s cover puts a twisted spin on an already unnerving hero, making the concept of Spiders-Man that much more unsettling. Of Momoko&#39;s Nightmare covers, it is certainly a standout.

Following the recent death of many of the spiders comprising the original Spiders-Man (only a handful remain after the End of the Spider-Verse event), now would be the perfect time for Miles Morales&#39; own Spiders-Man to establish himself in the Marvel Universe. Spiders-Man quickly became a fan-favorite character due to his strange, disturbing concept. Now that the hive-mind is all but gone, an even creepier spin on the concept could move beyond a variant cover and into the Spider-Verse at large (after all, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time a cover initiative spawned a new canon character.) Spiders-Man&#39;s original form may be a thing of the past, but Miles Morales&#39; transformation proves there is a new life just waiting for Marvel&#39;s creepiest Spider-Man.




Miles Morales: Spider-Man #13 is available now from Marvel Comics.
