## Literature Review

Doctor Strange, keeper of the Time Stone and known prognosticator of possible futures, couldn&#39;t see Blade&#39;s latest enemy coming in time.




Warning: Spoilers for Blade #5!Blade&#39;s newest rival has proven to be immune to Doctor Strange&#39;s Time Stone abilities. Marvel&#39;s Earth-616 canon has established that Doctor Strange can see into the future without the need for the actual Time Stone – in fact, this was established in the previous issue of Blade. Now, the latest issue has made it clear that the protagonist&#39;s new major threat cannot be detected in time by Strange&#39;s magic.




Blade #5 – by Bryan Hill, Elena Casagrande, KJ Diaz, and VC&#39;s Cory Petit – depicted Strange&#39;s powers as useless against the Daywalker&#39;s newest rival. Throughout the series&#39; early issues of the series, recently introduced villain the Adana has been firmly established as the most dangerous demon Blade has ever faced, ranking among the most powerful demons in the Marvel Universe.



          

Blade #5 continues to showcase how far the Adana&#39;s power extends, including how she can apparently bypass Doctor Strange&#39;s augury abilities, elevating her to yet another level of threat above any threat Blade has encountered before in his hero career.

                  &#34;You Are An Abomination&#34;: Blade Finally Gets the R-Rated Nemesis He Deserves   Blade is on a collision course with a new supernatural threat, Adana, who finally gives the vampire hunter the R-rated foe he so richly deserves.   





 Doctor Strange Can&#39;t See The Adana In His Future 


          

Blade accidentally unleashed this latest, greatest threat upon the world at the beginning of the new Blade series, and since then, the Adana has been on an all-out rampage. Doctor Strange became involved once the Adana destroys his friends using a dark alternative to Ghost Rider&#39;s Penance Stare. Strange helped Blade retrieve the one weapon that could kill her, Lucifer&#39;s sword, but refused to help him further. In Blade #4, Strange viewed far enough into the future to know he can&#39;t accompany Blade into his final battle with the Adana, instead opting not to interfere with the nature of time itself.

However, Strange later sees the damage and destruction that the Adana&#39;s caused and is shocked at the sight, suggesting he saw none of this in his fortunes. Blade fails in the battle, and the sword falls into the Adana&#39;s hands, allowing her to open a gateway to her hellish homeworld, in turn forcing Earthlings at random to turn into monsters. &#34;Even in meditation, I couldn&#39;t have foreseen ... this,&#34; Strange admits in horror at the sight of the Adana&#39;s destruction. The Adana&#39;s prowess doesn&#39;t stop there, as later, she&#39;s shown to be able to create her own personal Hell dimension just so Blade and her have a place to chat.






 The Adana Is Marvel&#39;s Most Unpredictable Threat Right Now 
          

As if it wasn&#39;t evident enough, the Adana is an all-powerful being, but this issue showcases just how she truly may be as unstoppable as she appears to be. The Adana is an unpredictable force of evil, so much so that even Doctor Strange can&#39;t predict her next move. To this day, even after everything she&#39;s committed so far, supernatural experts like Blade and Doctor Strange struggle to put into words exactly what the Adana is. She can&#39;t be comprehended by knowledge or time. It remains to be seen how Blade can find a way to defeat her – especially as he begrudgingly teams up with Dracula to do so – but as Doctor Strange has proven, no one can tell what the Adana will do next.

Blade #5 is available now from Marvel Comics.
