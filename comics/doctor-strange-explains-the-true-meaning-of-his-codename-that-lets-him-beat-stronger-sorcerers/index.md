# Doctor Strange Explains the True Meaning of His Codename (That Lets Him Beat Stronger Sorcerers)


## SUMMARY 



  Doctor Strange explains the true meaning of his codename, which allows him to defeat stronger sorcerers like General Strange.   General Strange is a formidable foe, but he has forgotten the qualities of a doctor, such as empathy and compassion, that Doctor Strange possesses.   Doctor Strange&#39;s compassion and empathy have made him one of Marvel&#39;s greatest heroes and enable him to defeat powerful sorcerers lacking these traits.

Doctor Strange explains the true meaning of his codename, and how it allows him to beat stronger sorcerers. The Sorcerer Supreme is currently in the fight of his life against General Strange, an evil variant of himself. General Strange, devoid of all that makes Doctor Strange who he is, is a formidable foe. Yet in a preview for Doctor Strange #10, he reveals the hidden truth behind his title–and how it will help him defeat the General.

Doctor Strange #10 is written by Jed MacKay and drawn by Pasqual Ferry. Doctor Strange is locked in combat with the General, and the Sorcerer Supreme is getting the upper hand. Doctor Strange reminds the general of the times he (the General) has boasted about burning away his good qualities, such as empathy and compassion, and leaving only a warrior. These qualities, which Strange points out are those of a doctor, are something the General has forgotten–and it may spell his defeat.

         




The preview ends with Doctor Strange firmly having the General firmly in his grasp.


 General Strange is All of Doctor Strange&#39;s Worst Fears Brought to Life 
          

General Strange closed the book on a hidden chapter in the life of Doctor Strange. The Vishanti, Strange’s benefactors, drafted him to serve in the War of the Seven Spheres–a war that stretched out for 5,000 years. During this time, Doctor Strange, hardened by the constant conflict, becomes General Strange, a ruthless killing machine. After the dust from the war settles, the Vishanti separates General Strange from the Doctor, creating two different beings. Doctor Strange was returned to our plane of existence with hardly any memories of the War, and General Strange was imprisoned, growing bitter over time. The General finally broke free and is making life miserable for Doctor Strange.




General Strange was everything Doctor Strange was not. Doctor Strange has devoted his life to saving people, both in his life as a physician and his time as Sorcerer Supreme. Stephen began as a surgeon, a field that saves lives on the regular. Even though this time was marred by vanity and self-interest, it showed Strange had a side that cares. When he became a sorcerer, Strange truly found himself. The qualities of a doctor that he so long denied himself were finally able to blossom, and they served him well when he became Sorcerer Supreme. Doctor Strange’s compassion and his empathy have made him one of Marvel’s greatest heroes.

And it is these qualities that allow him to continually defeat more powerful sorcerers such as General Strange. The many sorcerers Doctor Strange has defeated over the years are numerous, including the likes of Dormammu. Some of these beings were ancient when humanity did not even exist, and yet Strange repels them every time. These sorcerers lack the personality traits that make a good doctor, such as empathy and compassion. When Stephen Strange transitioned from physician to sorcerer, he kept the “Doctor” title, and this codename explains why he is so successful at defeating Dormammu and other powerful magic users.

Doctor Strange #10 is on sale December 20 from Marvel Comics!
