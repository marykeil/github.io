## Literature Review

Catwoman seems to almost have more costumes than The Dark Knight himself, with a new cosplay bringing a fresh new look to her iconic purple design.




In DC Comics, Catwoman is a slippery supervillain who loves stealing and thieving anything she can get her claws on, with her cat-burglar career translating perfectly into the various cat-themed outfits she prowls the rooftops of Gotham wearing. And in a new cosplay design predicting the recent comic book return of Catwoman’s 90s purple design, fans get more than they bargained for with a slight tweak on an iconic look that DC needs to take note of.




Posted on social media via Instagram, @cutiepiesensei is a cosplayer with well over a dozen different live-action designs under her creative belt, with more always being uploaded for her almost 500k followers to enjoy.


 

Having dressed as more characters from nerd fiction than fans can count, @cutiepiesensei has cosplayed as DC’s Starfire, Wonder Woman, and Batgirl, Marvel’s Black Panther, She-Hulk, and Valkyrie, Katara and Korra from Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra, Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Ahsoka from Star Wars, and more, with there simply not being enough space to list every impressive design @cutiepiesensei has come up with and worn.

                  Catwoman Cosplay Proves Everyone Underestimates Her as a Gotham Villain   Catwoman is a thief who scales the skyscrapers of Gotham on the lookout for her next haul, with this cosplay nailing that villainous nature perfectly.   





 DC Comics Cosplay Shows Off A Unique New Look For Catwoman 
          

Technically considered to be dead after the explosive events of the recently concluded Gotham War storyline, Catwoman #59, by Tini Howard and Stefano Raffaele, acts as a new jumping-on point for fans of the character where Selina has once again donned a 90s outfit that has become a popular fan-favorite look. Clad head-to-toe in purple save for a pair of black boots and gloves, this design sees Selina tuck her flowing black locks into her cat-cowl, making it the only significant departure from a returning design that still works just as well as it did when it first premiered decades ago.

Predicting this return to form for Catwoman well over a year ago when this cosplay originally debuted, this more recent clip from @cutiepiesensei gives fans a new look at this unique design, one that brings together Selina’s sleek purple catsuit and her more tactical outfit as seen in Darwyn Cooke’s 2002 redesign for the character. Keeping the purple and black color scheme but wearing a more textured zip-up catsuit with a collar instead of a spandex onesie, it’s @cutiepiesensei’s very Batman-like utility belt, sleek black gloves, purple cat-cowl, curly black hair, and confident criminal attitude that sells a design which perfectly marries two of Selina’s best looks.

So while it remains to be seen what kind of mischievous adventures Selina will get up to now that she’s back in her iconic 90s threads, it’s good to know that this decades-old design can inspire others to create something never seen before in the comic or cosplay community. One thing’s for certain, if Catwoman ever needs another new outfit to help her in her quest to steal anything of value not nailed to the floor, DC needs to look no further than @cutiepiesensei’s inspired remixed design.
