## Literature Review

One of the deadliest substances in the Marvel Universe has accidentally been unleashed in the course of the supervillain Gang War: Hulk blood.




Warning: Spoilers for Amazing Spider-Man (2022) #41 ahead!Just when it seems Marvel&#39;s Gang War event couldn&#39;t get any more chaotic, recent developments hint that a new Hulk may be joining the fray. During a brawl between She-Hulk and Typhoid Mary, the villain succeeds in spilling Jen&#39;s gamma-irradiated blood - with dire implications.




Zeb Wells, John Romita, Jr., Scott Hanna, and Marcio Menyz&#39;s Amazing Spider-Man (2022) #41 largely consists of a brawl between Tombstone, his heroic allies, and Kingpin (supported by his wife, Typhoid Mary) as the two crime lords refuse to cede their territory to the other&#39;s child. As She-Hulk and Typhoid Mary square off, Jen is shocked when the mutant&#39;s new adamantium-dipped sword bites deeply into her normally impenetrable skin.

          

Mary continues to draw blood throughout the fight, to the point where her blades are constantly shown to be covered in green. Between She-Hulk&#39;s dripping wounds and Mary losing her sword in the battle, gamma-irradiated blood is everywhere.

                  Spider-Man Proves a Forgotten MCU Team are Marvel&#39;s Most Pathetic Villains   These MCU villains was always thought of as a joke, but their appearance in The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s Gang War story shows what pushovers they are.   





 Hulk Blood Complicates An Already Chaotic Gang War 


          

Jen Walters is the poster child for the dangers posed by gamma-irradiated blood, as it&#39;s what transformed her into the Sensational She-Hulk in the first place. Jen&#39;s blood is particularly potent: Rainbow Rowell, Takeshi Miyazawa, and Rico Renzi&#39;s She-Hulk (2022) #8 introduces the recurring villains of Mark and April Booth, who wind up with uncontrollable gamma transformations after stealing and experimenting with a serum derived from She-Hulk&#39;s blood. The pair&#39;s failure to control gamma blood proves that it is an incredibly dangerous substance in even the best laboratory settings - let alone being strewn about in a gang brawl.

There appears to be a deliberate focus on She-Hulk&#39;s blood throughout the fight with Typhoid Mary. While it makes sense to show the blood in the first panel when she is cut, in order to emphasize the threat Mary poses, Mary&#39;s blade is consistently coated green during the rest of the issue. Whether it be from Mary&#39;s sword or Jen dripping over a pile of Kingpin&#39;s goons, everyone in this fight has just been exposed to the dangerous, transformative properties of She-Hulk&#39;s blood.






 Who Will Be The Gang War&#39;s New Hulk? 
          

While there are many possibilities in play, the nature of the fight suggests that Kingpin may have control of a new Hulk by the time Gang War is over: he has access to the blood on his wife&#39;s sword, as well as command over any of the Hellfire Club troops who may have been exposed to She-Hulk&#39;s bleeding. Alternatively, She-Hulk&#39;s blood may find its way to the Rose (Kingpin&#39;s son), or his henchman, the gamma-reanimated Digger. Whatever the case may be, the potential for She-Hulk&#39;s blood to add a new Hulk to Marvel&#39;s Gang War only adds more fuel to the fire.
