# Carnage Proved He Was Worse Than Joker With One Dark Feat


## SUMMARY 



  Carnage proved himself worse than the Joker by driving a therapist violently insane, leaving no hope of recovery, ultimately leading to the man&#39;s death.   While the Joker manipulated Harley Quinn with lies, Carnage showed Dr. Kurtz an honest look into his worldview, driving him completely insane as a result.   Unlike Harley, Dr. Kurtz didn&#39;t stand a chance at redemption or recovery. This demonstrates that Carnage&#39;s treatment of therapists is far worse than Joker&#39;s, who consideres them more like toys to be played with.

## Literature Review

Carnage is one of the worst serial killers in comic book history; while often compared to DC&#39;s Joker, Carnage has proved he&#39;s worse in one major way.




Carnage and the Joker are often compared due to the fact they&#39;re the worst serial killers that Marvel and DC have to offer. However, despite some major similarities the two might have, Carnage indisputably proved himself to be worse in one major area. While the Joker has certainly tortured and twisted multiple therapists in his time, Carnage is the only one who drove a therapist completely and utterly, violently insane.






The end result of Joker&#39;s manipulation of Harley Quinn wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as what Carnage did to Dr. Kurtz.




Carnage: Mind Bomb – written by Warren Ellis, with art by Kyle Hotz, Jon Babcock, Mike Higgins, and Marie Javins – featured Carnage&#39;s major achievement over the Joker, when the Ravencroft Institute brought in Dr. Kurtz, a highly skilled government psychologist, to analyze Cletus Kasady.



          

The results of this attempt proved disastrous – most notably, for Dr. Kurtz himself, who arguably suffered a fate worse than death, as Kasady and the Carnage symbiote destroyed his mind entirely, seemingly leaving no hope of recovery. This incredible moment showcased that while Joker might view therapists as playthings, to be toyed with, Carnage hates them beyond comparison.




                  Carnage is Evolving and Taking a Page from Joker&#39;s Book   Carnage and the Joker are two of the most deadly serial killers to ever exist, and now it seems Carnage is learning a lesson from the Joker.   


 Carnage Drives Dr. Kurtz Violently Insane 


          

As depicted in Carnage: Mind Bomb, the doctors of Ravencroft were at their wit&#39;s end with Kasady; they figured there was no harm in letting government psychologist Dr. Kurtz try. Kurtz was surprisingly effective at first, managing to separate the Carnage symbiote from Kasady, as well as managing to get Kasady to open up and talk about his life and childhood. Things seemingly went well until Kasady turned the tables, rejoining with the Carnage symbiote – and literally pumping his worldview into Kurtz&#39;s brain. Carnage shared his lethal outlook on life with Dr. Kurtz, literally, driving Kurtz insane as a result.




The most infamous example of the Joker driving a therapist out of their mind is, without a doubt, Harley Quinn. However, there&#39;s a difference between what the Joker did to Harley and what Carnage did to Dr. Kurtz. Harley Quinn was already a bit of a fan of the Joker, and he portrayed himself as a victim – of both Batman and society at large –which led her to sympathize with him. Because of this, the Joker was able to manipulate Harley, eventually driving her over the edge; yet, Harley wasn&#39;t completely lost. She still knew who she was, and eventually was able to break free from Joker&#39;s control.



 Dr. Kurtz Didn&#39;t Get A Shot A Redemption 


          

The end result of Joker&#39;s manipulation of Harley Quinn wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as what Carnage did to Dr. Kurtz. Using the Carnage symbiote, Cletus was able to plug himself directly into Dr. Kurtz&#39;s brain, pushing his worldview into Kurtz&#39;s brain, literally showing Kurtz how Carnage views the world. This drove Kurtz instantly and irreversibly insane. Kurtz immediately stripped naked and began attacking people at random. Ultimately, Kurtz was shot and killed by security at Ravencroft because of what Carnage did to him, making it clear his suffering at Carnage&#39;s hands was far worse than what the Joker did to Harley Quinn.




No matter how messed up Harley Quinn became, she was eventually able to rediscover herself and make a fairly full recovery. Despite the damage done to her, the only reason Harley got as messed up as she did was because Joker lied to and manipulated her. Carnage did no such thing. Carnage showed Dr. Kurtz a completely honest look into how he sees the world, and that was what drove Kurtz completely insane, leading to his untimely and unfortunate death. This is why when it comes to their respective treatment of therapists, Marvel&#39;s Carnage has proved far worse than DC Comics&#39; Joker.



Carnage: Mind Bomb was released in 1996. It is available now from Marvel Comics!
