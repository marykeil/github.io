The Imperial Knights challenged the notion of Jedi and Sith, as elite Force-wielders loyal to their Emperor who exclusively use the light side of the Force.
The series redefined Force healing, revealing that it can be used to turn minor injuries fatal, and showcased the potential impact of Darth Krayt on the original and prequel trilogies - and these are just some of the wild moments/ideas introduced in Star Wars: Legacy.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Star Wars: Legacy is set more than a century after the OT, which allowed for a lot of freedom with its storytelling. Here&rsquo;s the 10 wildest moments!</p>
<p>By its very nature, Star Wars: Legacy is a truly wild continuation of the Star Wars mythos. The main character himself, Cade Skywalker, is basically just a more badass version of Luke, as he’s a space-faring, Force-sensitive smuggler who is the galaxy’s last hope in defeating the ultimate evil of this distant future reality, the One Sith - specifically Darth Krayt. The Legacy era gives Star Wars a gritty tone that every other iteration of the series sorely lacked, which contributed to the massive cult following the series cultivated within the larger Star Wars fandom.
Not only is Star Wars: Legacy a grittier and more intense look at the iconic world of Star Wars, but it also introduced a number of interesting ideas into the series canon. From expanding upon pre-existing abilities and technology, to upping the ante on some of the most iconic aspects of the original storyline, Star Wars: Legacy has no shortage of wild moments, with 10 that seem to stand out among the rest.</p>
<p>Star Wars: 15 Most Powerful Members of The One Sith
The One Sith was established in Star Wars Legends, and introduced fans to some of the strongest Sith Lords in history. Here are the 15 most powerful!</p>
<p>10  Star Wars: Legacy Introduced Imperial Knights
Star Wars: Legacy #1 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>From the beginning of Star Wars, it always seemed like there were only two sides to the proverbial coin of the Force: Jedi and Sith. While that’s a gross oversimplification, that’s the impression the series only recently began moving away from in the current canon. However, Star Wars: Legacy challenged that notion back in the early 2000s with the introduction of the Imperial Knights, which are a team of elite Force-wielders who exclusively use the light side of the Force, but who are loyal to their Emperor above all else - including the Force itself.
While it could be argued that the Jedi were little more than Knights of the Republic (especially during the Clone Wars), that’s not their function in the galaxy, as they’re meant to act only through the will of the Force. Not only that, but the only Force-users who worked for the Empire were exclusively dark siders. The Imperial Knights utterly flipped that notion on its head, which - alone - is truly wild.</p>
<p>9  Cade Skywalker Reveals Force Healing Ability Has A Deadly Alternate Use
Star Wars: Legacy #16 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>Force healing is a power that’s been put on display in more recent Star Wars projects (with Rey and Grogu seemingly having mastered this power), but it’s one that’s been around for a lot longer within the wider Star Wars universe - including in Star Wars: Legacy. However, in the Legacy era, Star Wars challenges the idea of what Force healing means, and what it can do.
In a moment that assuredly shocked readers, Cade Skywalker - who was inherently adept in Force healing - reveals that his power comes from being able to see the weaknesses in others, and making a conscious choice to reach out through the Force and heal them. However, he also says that he could just as easily do the opposite, and use the Force to turn a minor injury fatal. This moment redefined the very nature of Force healing itself.</p>
<p>8  Darth Krayt Could Have Undone The Entire Star Wars Prequel &amp; Original Trilogies
Star Wars: Legacy #16 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>Darth Krayt is one of the most powerful and significant villains in Star Wars lore, and his existence alone could qualify as one of the wildest aspects of Star Wars: Legacy. The reason that’s the case can be pinpointed in instances where Krayt wasn’t just a unique villain, but where he could have impacted the wider universe. In fact, there are a few moments that show he could have effectively undone the classic Star Wars universe as it existed in the original and prequel trilogies.
When he was a Jedi named A’Sharad Hett during the Clone Wars, Darth Krayt could sense the influence of the dark side all over Anakin Skywalker, and he even regrets not doing or saying something that would have neutralized Skywalker before Order 66. Then, after Order 66, Darth Krayt fights Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine, as Krayt becomes the leader of a band of Tuskens that was on its way to raid a moisture farm - the one on which Luke Skywalker was raised. Krayt had the opportunity to kill both Anakin and Luke Skywalker, which would have undone the entire original and sequel trilogies - a truly wild prospect introduced in Star Wars: Legacy.</p>
<p>7  Star Wars’ Sith Are As Committed To Art As They Are To Conquest
Star Wars: Legacy #17 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>The greatest misconception in Star Wars is the nature of the Sith, as some incorrectly believe a Sith is nothing more than a fallen Jedi, or a corrupted Force-user. Being Sith is much more than just using the dark side or trying to take over the galaxy, it’s a culture. The Sith have specific rituals, practices, body modifications, and even works of art specific to their culture, and they’re ferociously passionate about every facet of it.
In this issue, Darth Talon shows Cade Skywalker a piece of art that a Sith Lord poured his literal life force into, as when it was finished, he asked his apprentice to kill him in front of it, so that it may absorb his living Force, and he may leave traces of himself within it for all time. This moment was more than just wild, it was perhaps the purest example of how the Sith’s obsession with violence and power is perhaps the least interesting thing about them.</p>
<p>6  Star Wars: Legacy Introduces A Villain With A New Kind Of Dark Side Army
Star Wars: Legacy #28-31 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>While Darth Krayt is the overarching villain in Star Wars: Legacy, he certainly isn’t the only one. Karness Muur - like Krayt - was once a Jedi who fell to the dark side. However, Muur did not adopt the ways of the Sith. Instead, Muur committed his life to dark side alchemy, including the study of ancient magic and forbidden sciences. In the end, Muur was able to link his spirit to a dark side Talisman, which allowed him to possess anyone who wore it, so long as they weren’t strong enough in the Force to resist.
Not only that, but this Dark Jedi also created perhaps the most unique army in the history of Star Wars: the rakghoul. The rakghoul were Sithspawn, and their saliva carried a venom that would mutate anyone they bit into rakghoul themselves (a horrific fate suffered by Darth Reave). The moment Karness Muur’s threat level was put on full display was truly wild, and even threatened to overtake that of Darth Krayt himself.</p>
<p>5  Darth Vader’s Suit Is Put To Shame By Star Wars: Legacy Armor That Cheats Death
Star Wars: Legacy #35 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>The suit worn by Darth Vader is meant to keep him alive following the immense injuries he suffered while fighting Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. However, the suit itself has some obvious limitations and weaknesses (most of which were implemented by the Emperor deliberately). Plus, the suit is designed to keep an injured person alive, not perpetually reanimate someone who’s already dead - not like the suit introduced in this issue of Star Wars: Legacy.
The suit worn by Azlyn Rae after she has effectively died is basically like a walking bafta tank with other components that actively forces her body to keep living. Not only that, but the armor is nearly indestructible, as though Din Djarin’s Mandalorian armor was merged with a vastly upgraded Darth Vader suit. While someone is wearing this, they cannot die, making it one of the wildest inventions in Star Wars history.</p>
<p>4  Star Wars: Legacy Teased An Interesting Step In Sith Corruption
Star Wars: Legacy #39 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>In this issue, Cade Skywalker has a vision where he gets corrupted by Darth Krayt, and his Sith form has red skin and tattoos. This mixed with the fact that practically every member of the One Sith has red skin despite their species only added more evidence to the idea that having one’s skin turned red was just another step in Sith corruption, which was a wild possibility that not only could have changed the history of the Sith forever, but it nearly redefined Darth Maul’s entire origin.
When Darth Maul was introduced in Episode I, some fans wondered if his red skin and Sith tattoos (later confirmed to be Dathomirian in origin) were a product of his species or his Sith corruption. While fans now know that both his skin and his tattoos were from his homeworld culture - totally separate from the Sith - that distinction was not established in Star Wars: Legacy, which attributed both of Darth Maul’s distinguished physical features exclusively to the Sith.</p>
<p>3  The Death Star Looked Kind Compared To The Final Protocol (&amp; Other Viral Attacks)
Star Wars: Legacy #47-49 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>The Final Protocol is a way of killing all life on an entire planet without destroying the physical world itself. While, on the surface, this seems like a preferable way to purge a world with the possibility of repopulating it later, the Final Protocol is so much worse than the Death Star. The Death Star kills a planet in an instant. Terrifying, but quick. The Final Protocol, however, kills a planet slowly through sickness and plague, effectively making the whole world suffer before the inevitable end.
The Final Protocol isn’t even the only super-virus threat in Star Wars: Legacy, as there’s also Omega Red, which is a virus created by the One Sith that kills everyone except Sith. There was also the Vongspawn, which was a mutated strain of Yuuzhan Vong origin that caused one’s body to grow horrific and painful spikes before they slowly died in agony.</p>
<p>2  Cade Undergoes Truly Wild Force Training From Luke Skywalker &amp; Darth Vader
Star Wars: Legacy #39 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>Star Wars: Legacy is set more than a century after the original trilogy, meaning Luke Skywalker has long since become one with the Force. However, like Obi-Wan and Yoda before him, Luke Skywalker used his presence as a Force Ghost to train one of his own descendants who needed his help: Cade Skywalker. While training done by Force Ghosts is usually purely instructional in nature, Luke takes things a few steps further with Cade, sending him through cascades of Force visions to help teach him the reason why he needs to choose the light, and the importance of eliminating the One Sith from the galaxy.
Cade’s Force training with Darth Vader (which happened in issue #11) is similar in nature, as it also takes place within a Force vision, and its purpose is to teach Cade how to focus his feelings in a way that translates to strength and understanding of the Force. Plus, like with Luke Skywalker, Cade’s lightsaber duel with Darth Vader is undeniably badass, making these training sessions obvious standouts.</p>
<p>1  Star Wars: Legacy Finally Paid Off The ‘Skywalker’ Name (Literally)
Star Wars: Legacy - War #6 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema</p>
<p>Out of everything that happened in the first volume of this series, the single greatest and wildest moment had to be when Cade Skywalker paid off the promise his family name implied by quite literally becoming a sky-walker. While some of the more hardcore fans may think this has something to do with the Chiss Ascendancy and their methods of traversing hyperspace through the Force, it&rsquo;s actually much less subtle than that.
In the final issue of Star Wars: Legacy - War, Cade Skywalker flies his ship into a sun, as it contained the body of Darth Krayt, and that seemed the best way to avoid another resurrection. Before the ship was vaporized, Cade jettisoned himself into space wearing a space suit. While he moved steadily through the stars, Cade said - in so many words - that he was now a true ‘sky-walker’, making this perhaps the wildest of the 10 standout moments from Star Wars: Legacy.</p>
