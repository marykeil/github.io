## Literature Review

The Marvel Universe is full of powerful god-like beings, and now the hierarchy of power has changed with the introduction of a new god.




Warning: contains spoilers for Immortal Thor #5!Marvel officially updated its ranking of gods with the introduction of the Demiurge Primordial. Among the many cosmic beings populating the Marvel Universe, the Demiurge is one of the most powerful, having seeded life on a primitive Earth. Yet now, in Immortal Thor #5, fans learn there is far more to the Demiurge than originally believed—including a revelation that forever changes the hierarchy of Marvel’s god-like beings.




Immortal Thor #5, written by Al Ewing and drawn by Martin Coccolo, introduces the Demiurge Primordial. An unidentified narrator recounts the history of the Demiurge: there have been others in previous realities and one yet to come, but it was the Demiurge Primordial that breathed life into a nascent Earth.

          

Described as the “Godcreator whose name and knowledge cannot be known,” this Demiurge Primordial is prime among them all.


 The Demiurge is an Important Figure in Marvel&#39;s Cosmos 
          

The Demiurge, named for a figure in several ancient schools of philosophy, is one of Marvel’s lesser-known cosmic beings, but arguably one of its most important. First appearing in 1982’s Thor Annual #10, the Demiurge is responsible for not only sparking life on Earth, but also creating the Elder Gods, one of which, Toranos, fights Thor in this issue. These Elder Gods waged a war that nearly destroyed the infant Earth, had the Demiurge not intervened once again. The Elder Gods flee our reality, but continue to intervene in the affairs of mortals, such as Toranos and Chthon, the author of the Darkhold.




The Marvel Universe is full of other cosmic gods, some of which are more powerful than the Demiurge. Among them are the Living Tribunal, Eternity and the One-Above-All. While the Demiurge’s powers allowed it to create life, these beings are truly “gods,” who could easily snuff the Demiurge if they wished. Likewise, the Demiurge would not fare well against Galactus. Galactus and the Demiurge are two sides of the same cosmic coin: the Demiurge creates life and Galactus destroys it, creating a balance. Furthermore, there is always someone who fulfills the roles of Galactus and the Demiurge in each universe, giving them another connection.

 Who is Now the Most Powerful Marvel God? 
          

But the coming of the Demiurge Primordial changes all of that. The Demiurge Primordial exists outside the multiverse, and is more powerful than the rest, having sparked life on Earth and sired a race of gods. Where this new Demiurge stands in the hierarchy of power in the Marvel Universe has not been revealed yet, leaving fans to wonder if it could take down Galactus or Eternity. The Demiurge Primordial’s power could put it into the same class as Eternity and its status as a multiversal being puts it on par with the One-Above-All–and thus leads to a major change in the rankings of Marvel’s “gods.”
