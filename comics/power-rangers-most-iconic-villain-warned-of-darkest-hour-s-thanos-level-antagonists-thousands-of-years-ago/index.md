## Literature Review

One of the Power Rangers franchise&#39;s classic villains has been warning everyone about the universe&#39;s greatest threat, Dark Specter, for centuries.




Classic Power Rangers villain Lord Zedd has been warning everyone about the universe&#39;s darkest threat for centuries. Dark Specter has emerged out of the Power Rangers&#39; &#34;Darkest Hour&#34; storyline as its main antagonist; further, he has been promoted as the overarching puppeteer behind all the Rangers&#39; previous misfortunes, much like Thanos was to the Avengers during the MCU&#39;s Infinity Saga.






The thought that the Power Rangers creative team may have planned such a large role for Dark Specter years in advance is impressive at the creative level; in-universe, it means that Zedd had spent thousands of years warning others of Dark Specter&#39;s potential reign over the galaxy, and no one listened.




In the comics, Dark Specter&#39;s presence in the Power Rangers franchise was foreshadowed dating back as early as Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Annual (2016) #1, in the story &#34;Only the Strong.&#34; A surprising source – Lord Zedd – gave readers a taste of just how much fear and anger someone like Dark Specter can strike into anyone, including himself, at the mere mention of the cosmic antagonist&#39;s name.

          

Beyond that, in the Eltarian War prequel arc, depicting Zedd&#39;s origin, he forewarned just how dangerous Dark Specter could be to the galaxy if he wasn&#39;t stopped, a warning that went unheeded for centuries, until it was too late.

 Lord Zedd Recognized The Threat Of Dark Specter Long Before &#34;Darkest Hour&#34; 


          





&#34;Only the Strong&#34; was by the creative team of Trey Moore, Terry Moore, HI-FI, and Jim Campbell.




&#34;Only the Strong&#34; focused on Goldar&#39;s first meeting with Lord Zedd, at a time when he still ran in a pack of warriors. By his side was his pack&#39;s best fighter, Goldar&#39;s brother, Silverback. Zedd – cloaked to hide his scars from losing his skin to the Zeo Crystal – called both beasts into his chambers, assigning them to hunt Zordon before he made it to Earth. Insulted that they&#39;d be asked to leave their planet unprotected to find one Eltarian, Silverback suggested he and his brother find a new master in Dark Specter. Zedd was so furious hearing Dark Specter&#39;s name that he blasted Silverback away, before forcing Goldar to finish the job.




Lord Zedd&#39;s apprehensions about Dark Specter date back to his origin as Zophram, the Supreme Guardian of Eltar, thousands of years beforehand. In 2020&#39;s Mighty Morphin #2, Zophram spoke to the elders of Eltar as he was being promoted to Supreme Guardian. His first request was asking to expand Eltar&#39;s forces throughout the deepest parts of the universe. Even though the elders doidn&#39;t share his sentiment, the future Zedd believed this is the best means of survival for his race against Dark Specter. Ominously, the elders warned Zophram not to become a monster to stop a monster – a tragic prognostication of his inevitable fall.



Mighty Morphin #2 came from the creative team of Ryan Parrott, Marco Renna, Walter Baiamonte, Katia Ranalli, and Ed Dukeshire.






 No One Listened to Zedd; Now It&#39;s Too Late 
          




Across the Power Rangers&#39; eight-year run at Boom! Studios, there have been several references to Dark Specter, long before he ever appeared for &#34;Darkest Hour,&#34; – with these mentions taking on much greater significance in retrospect. The thought that the Power Rangers creative team may have planned such a large role for Dark Specter years in advance is impressive at the creative level; in-universe, it means that Zedd had spent thousands of years warning others of Dark Specter&#39;s potential reign over the galaxy, and no one listened. Now that Lord Zedd is officially a Ranger, he&#39;ll be forced to work with the Power Rangers to stop the current hour from getting any darker.
