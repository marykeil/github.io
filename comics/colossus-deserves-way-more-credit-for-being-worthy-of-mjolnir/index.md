# Colossus Deserves Way More Credit for Being Worthy of Mjolnir


## SUMMARY 



  Colossus&#39; ability to wield Mjolnir shows that he is pure of heart and ultimately good, despite recent actions calling into question his integrity.   Colossus&#39; heroic nature is evident in his willingness to sacrifice himself for others, as seen in the Legacy Virus storyline.   Although Colossus has recently fallen from grace, his kind-hearted warrior nature makes him one of Marvel&#39;s most worthy heroes.

## Literature Review

Colossus just spent four years being puppeted and manipulated by his brother, but beneath that experience is a heart of a hero worthy of Mjolnir.  




Long-time X-Men fan-favorite Colossus has been at the lowest point of his life, with his actions – whether he is in control of them or not – calling into question the character&#39;s integrity. However, one version of Piotr has been depicted as being able to wield Mjolnir, Thor&#39;s mighty weapon. The act itself is a testament to the fact that at his core, Colossus is pure of heart and, ultimately, good.




In A-Force (2015) #3 – by Marguerite Bennett, G. Willow Wilson, Jorge Molina, and Laura Martin – Colossus was seen among Doom&#39;s Thor Corps. This version of the Corps had a deep roster, but Piotr was easily at home among their ranks. The Piotr Rasputin of this continuity was notably capable of lifting Mjolnir, signifying his incredible heroic fortitude.

          

Although the Thor Corps doesn&#39;t occur within the main timeline, there are no glaring differences between the two versions of Colossus. One&#39;s worthiness easily translates to the other, and Piotr has often displayed the characteristics many consider as &#34;worthy&#34; of lifting Mjolnir.


 Colossus&#39; Recent Tribulations Shouldn&#39;t Define Him 
Lifting Mjolnir Is Just One Example Of Piotr&#39;s Hero Credentials



Colossus&#39; most heroic moment occurred in Uncanny X-Men #390 – by Scott Lobdell, Salvador Larroca, Danny Miki, and Tim Townsend – when he sacrificed himself to safely disperse the cure for the mutant-targeting Legacy Virus among the global mutant population.







Wielding Mjolnir is about far more than strength. Although Piotr possesses that in abundance, it doesn&#39;t define him. Beneath the near-impenetrable organic steel skin, Colossus has always had a good heart. His earnest nature and willingness to protect others make him trustworthy and respected, even if recent events have begun to tarnish that reputation. He never backs down from stepping into a conflict, no matter how complicated, if it&#39;s the right thing to do. When it involves someone he loves, he&#39;s willing to go even further. Colossus won&#39;t just go to the ends of the Earth – he&#39;ll give his life if that&#39;s what it takes to finish the job.

The greatest examples of Piotr Rasputin&#39;s willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good came at the climax of the X-franchise&#39;s devastating Legacy Virus storyline. After losing his beloved sister, Illyana, to the virus, Colossus was willing to do whatever was necessary to protect others. The cure essentially required the first person to die, and Piotr took that sacrifice upon himself – giving his life and using his mutant ability to disperse the cure in the process. His knack for sacrifice and rushing forward into danger to save others is so strong, it has even created tension with close friends and former lovers alike. 






 Being Worthy Doesn&#39;t Keep Colossus From Falling 
Piotr&#39;s Recent Dark Storyline Has Set The Stage For Him To Rise Again
          

Thanks to dark influences from his brother, Mikhail Rasputin, and the Chronicler, Colossus has recently fallen from grace. He lost the trust of his X-Force team, and hurt many who depended on him, though he wasn&#39;t in control of his own actions. Part of wielding Mjolnir comes with believing oneself to be worthy. Currently, Piotr likely couldn&#39;t muster that sort of confidence, but that doesn&#39;t negate the fact that at his core he has always been a kind-hearted warrior, ready to defend the world with his life. Although it&#39;s unlikely he&#39;ll get a chance to test his mettle and life Mjolnir any time soon, Colossus remains one of Marvel&#39;s most worthy heroes.
