## Literature Review

A new Transformers variant cover from artist Jonboy Meyers features an epic homage to the classic &#39;86 movie, as Optimus Prime proves he has the touch.




The Transformers have just been rebooted as a part of the Energon Universe, but new publisher Skybound Entertainment isn’t above looking to the past when building the new continuity. A variant cover for January’s Transformers #4 pays homage to the classic 1986 animated movie, providing an excellent Easter egg for longtime fans of the franchise.




Coming from artist Jonboy Meyers, the variant cover was shared on the Skybound website. It recreates the iconic moment from Transformers: The Movie when Optimus Prime arrives on Earth in time to help his Autobots against a surprise attack from Megatron.

          

The famed moment from the movie sees Optimus Prime launch himself into the air, blasting away at the Decepticons while Stan Bush’s song “The Touch” blares on the soundtrack. Meyers’ cover captures the moment in all of its glory, featuring Optimus in the classic, leaping pose.

The cover is the latest in line of nods to the ’86 movie in the Energon Universe, which started with the debut title Void Rivals. The third issue of that series features an appearance from a Quintesson Prosecutor. Later issues feature the multi-headed Quintesson Judge, the villain who passes sentence on innocent victims in Transformers: The Movie. Void Rivals writer and Skybound publisher Robert Kirkman has noted the impact the ’86 movie had on him ever since first seeing it, citing the death of Optimus Prime as a seminal moment of his childhood.

Given that pedigree, there’s always the possibility that the homage on Meyers’ variant cover could be more than just that. The Energon Universe has been teasing the return of Megatron ever since the line-up of Transfomers appearing in the new series was revealed, with Decepticon leader nowhere to be found. Skybound seems to be teeing up an epic showdown with Optimus Prime if and when Megatron makes his grand return, and the results could be absolutely game-changing. Is it possible that fans could be in for another shocking death when Megatron finally appears? Only time will tell.

Whatever the case, it’s nice to see the new publisher paying homage to the franchise’s storied past in such a way. Transformers: The Movie is still beloved by fans all these decades later, so it’s smart for the creators to homage the animated movie’s most classic moments. The new Transformers series has been a smash hit both commercially and critically, and a large part of that is thanks to a “back to basics” approach that sees the franchise paying homage to the G1 era that started the whole phenomenon in the first place. One thing’s for sure: it’s never been a better time to be a Transformers fan.
