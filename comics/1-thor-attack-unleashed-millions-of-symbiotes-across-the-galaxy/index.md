## Literature Review

Venom #4 revealed the God of Thunder&#39;s integral role in helping spread the dangerous alien entities known as the Symbiotes across the Marvel Universe.




The Symbiotes are the most dangerous aliens in the Marvel Universe, and part of what makes them so dangerous is because of Thor. Long before the Venom symbiote landed on Earth, Thor accidentally unleashed the symbiotes across the universe. When Thor fought a Grendal symbiote, his lightning severed the Knull&#39;s connection to the Hive, causing the billions of symbiotes around the universe to go on a rampage.




Venom #4 – by Donny Cates, Ryan Stegman, JP Mayer, Frank Martin, and Clayton Cowles – depicts the ancient history of the Symbiotes, revealing Thor&#39;s shocking role in their backstory. As seen in the issue, the symbiotes were running rampant across the universe, conquering planet after planet; when they arrived at Earth, they were stopped by Thor. Seeing a Grendal attacking a group of Norse villagers, Thor unleashed his lightning and knocked the Grendal out cold, but his attack had an unexpected side effect.



          

The lightning completely interrupted Knull&#39;s connection with the Hive, which allowed the symbiotes to begin bonding with random races all over the universe.

 Thor&#39;s Lightning Caused More Damage Than He Could&#39;ve Imagined 


          








Venom #4 was released in July, 2018. After first appearing in the previous issue, Venom #3, Knull subsequently went on become a major antagonist in the Marvel Universe.




When Knull unleashed his symbiotes on the universe, he did it to conquer every planet, so he could return them to darkness. He really didn&#39;t care about the things that symbiotes are known for today, like bonding with hosts. Under Knull&#39;s command, his symbiote army marched through the stars, killing every single living being they could find, in order to snuff out the light. When the army eventually made it to Earth, Thor was there to stop them. But Thor&#39;s interference had the unexpected outcome of disrupting Knull as the host; this caused the Symbiotes to go wild, and begin bonding with anyone they could find.

While Thor&#39;s attack prevented the destruction of all life, having the symbiotes across potentially billions of planets suddenly bonding with new, alien hosts wasn&#39;t exactly better. Because of what Thor did, potentially billions of people were forcefully bonded with symbiotes. In the long-run, this also led to Spider-Man eventually becoming bonded, in turn eventually leading to the creation of Venom. While Thor clearly had to stop the King in Black&#39;s army, his solution wasn&#39;t a lot better. Because of Thor&#39;s actions, Earth would eventually have to deal with Venom and later Carnage. The latter proved to be a world-ending threat several times.






 Thor Set Knull&#39;s Symbiotes Loose On The Universe 


          

While the symbiotes were eventually defeated, or redeemed on Earth, this doesn&#39;t exactly absolve Thor of the potentially billions of other symbiotes who went rampant across the universe. Thor is one of the most powerful heroes that Marvel has to offer, and he wasn&#39;t wrong in defending the Norse people from the Grendal. However, with a universe as big as Marvel&#39;s, sometimes even the best actions can have unintended consequences. While Thor saved the universe from Knull wiping out all life, he may very well have damned countless planets to a symbiote apocalypse that no one ever came to save them from, and eventually gave rise to Venom.
