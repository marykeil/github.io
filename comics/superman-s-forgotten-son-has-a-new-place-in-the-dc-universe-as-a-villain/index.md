## Literature Review

Superman has worked with, and even adopted many children over the years. Now his long-forgotten son is finally returning... with a dark new purpose.




Superman&#39;s current family is full of characters, such as the Super-Twins and his biological son, Jon Kent. But these aren&#39;t the only children Superman has had: there was one kid that came before all of them, and now Chris Kent is returning to comics in a dark way.




Chris Kent is returning to comics in a permanent way in Sinister Sons #1 by Peter J. Tomasi and David Lafuente. This issue promises to follow the first meeting of Lor-Zod and Sinson, the children of Zod and Sinestro respectively. The pair will team up to travel into the very &#34;heart of darkness&#34; and likely get into some major mischief.

 SINISTER SONS #1 (2024)                 Release Date:  February 13th, 2024    Writers:  PETER J. TOMASI    Artists:  DAVID LAFUENTE    Cover Artists:  BRAD WALKER and ANDREW HENNESSY    Variant Covers:  DAN MORA, JAMAL CAMPBELL, KEN MARION, DANNY MIKI, RAMON PEREZ, PETE WOODS   They’re bad to the bone, ready to brawl, and the sons of two of the deadliest villains in the galaxy: they’re the Sinister Sons and the DC Universe will never be the same! When the son of General Zod was cast off of his adopted homeworld of New Kandor, Lor-Zod runs afoul of a kid on a mission: Sinson is out to prove he’s got what it takes to live up to the family name of Sinestro! But all is not as it seems, and the sons’ journeys will take them into the heart of darkness in this sensational first issue! Superstar Super Sons scribe Peter J. Tomasi returns to the world of DC youth once again—joined by fan-favorite artist David Lafuente—to craft one of the most dynamic debuts of a duo in DCU history!   



The two characters were clearly designed as evil counterparts to the Super Sons team of Damian Wayne and Jon Kent, and, while Sinson is a new character, this is a dark direction for Lor-Zod. In DC&#39;s previous continuity, Lor-Zod was also Chris Kent — Superman&#39;s first adopted son.




 : DC’s Super Sons Get Their Perfect Evil Opposites in New Team-Up


 The New Sinister Sons Are a Duo Unlike Any Other 
          

While most fans are aware of Jon Kent&#39;s status as Superman&#39;s son, fewer are aware that he wasn&#39;t the first. The first Super Son was Lor-Zod, the child of General Zod, who escaped the Phantom Zone. Clark and Lois ended up adopting him and helping him adjust to his Kryptonian powers on Earth, something they&#39;d later repeat with their biological son Jon decades later. Chris Kent was a legitimately good child who wanted to escape the shadow of his father, and when Zod ended up invading Earth, it was Chris&#39; sacrifice that stopped his evil father. It seems, though, that DC&#39;s latest version of Lor-Zon is perfectly happy to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps.




          

Chris Kent was a hero in pretty much every sense of the word: not only did he sacrifice himself to stop his evil father&#39;s plans for world domination, but he later came back and even took on the mantle of Nightwing. Chris was Superman&#39;s first attempt at having a son and Chris did absolutely everything he could to embody the idea of being Superman&#39;s son. But despite this, this new version of Chris Kent is how he would&#39;ve turned out if he truly was raised by Zod instead of the Lane-Kents.



 Will Superman&#39;s Forgotten Son Take Down His Father? 


          

Superman is no stranger to secret enemies returning from his past. Just recently, Superman has had to deal with the return of Jax-Ur, an old Kryptonian villain. So, while Superman might be familiar with villains from his past returning, there&#39;s no doubt someone who used to be his former son appearing as a villain will take the Man of Steel by surprise. While Chris Kent used to be a hero — and proof that one wasn&#39;t defined by his parents — now readers are seeing just what Chris would&#39;ve become under Zod&#39;s influence.






Sinister Sons #1 is on sale February 13th from DC Comics!
