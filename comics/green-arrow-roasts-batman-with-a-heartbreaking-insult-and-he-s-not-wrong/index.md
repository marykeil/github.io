## Literature Review

Green Arrow lands a devastating verbal blow on Batman with a heartbreaking insult that promises to send the Dark Knight into sulk mode.




Warning: Potential spoilers for Green Arrow #7!




Green Arrow isn&#39;t just a Queen; he&#39;s also the newly crowned and undisputed King of Roasts after impaling Batman with a verbal spear that hit The Dark Knight right where it hurt the most – his feelings. What elevates this verbal strike from devastating to gut-wrenching is the brutal truth embedded within the insult – a truth so painfully accurate that even Bruce Wayne&#39;s own children can&#39;t refute it.

In Green Arrow #7, crafted by Joshua Williamson, Carmine Di Giandomenico, and Trevor Hairsine, the story kicks off with Green Arrow returning to Earth-0 after being lost in time and space. However, the homecoming takes an unexpected turn as he discovers the disbandment of the Justice League.

          

Determined to get answers, he seeks out former League members, including his best bud, Green Lantern Hal Jordan. As the two catch up, the conversation takes an interesting turn to the topic of parenting and eventually leads to Green Arrow making an off-handed yet scalding remark about Bruce&#39;s parenting skills, or more accurately, lack of.





 Green Arrow and Green Lantern Think Batman is a Bad Father 
          

During a heart-to-heart, the subject of children surfaces between the two friends when Green Lantern confesses that his greatest regret was never having kids. Transitioning to Oliver&#39;s own family, Hal inquires about the weight of responsibility that comes with raising multiple children. Oliver acknowledges the concerns but asserts that, for him, the challenges are undoubtedly worth it. Hal shifts the focus to Batman, noting, &#34;Bruce has all those kids, too. And look what happened there.&#34; Quick to defend, Oliver counters, &#34;Bruce has... issues. My kids all love me. Not a one of them would ever take a shot at me.&#34;

While Oliver&#39;s statement serves as an epic burn, it also encapsulates a straightforward truth. Bruce undeniably has a plethora of offspring, yet his connections with most of his children remain strained, a reality emphasized in the current continuity marked by a full-scale conflict within the Bat-Family in the Gotham War storyline. Notably, Batman&#39;s relationship faces its most significant strain with his second eldest son, Jason Todd, the former Robin turned Red Hood. Nevertheless, Bruce grapples with issues across the board with all his children, with his least strained connection likely being with his daughter Cassandra Cain, though even they have encountered their share of challenges.




                  Black Adam Calls Out the Justice League Hero He&#39;ll Never Respect   Black Adam just unleashed the most scorching (and humorous) insult on one Justice League member, who is sure to be left with a bruised ego.   



 Green Arrow and Roy Harper’s Relationship Struggles 
          

Despite Green Arrow&#39;s accurate observation of Batman&#39;s tumultuous relationships with his children, the saying &#34;those who live in glass houses shouldn&#39;t throw stones&#34; rings true, especially for Oliver. While Oliver proudly touts healthy relationships with all his kids, it wasn&#39;t always smooth sailing. This is particularly evident in his history with Roy Harper, his once sidekick and now son and partner. Over the years, their relationship experienced its fair share of ups and downs, mainly revolving around Roy&#39;s struggles with addiction and Oliver&#39;s challenges with providing the necessary support. While the Arrow-Family is currently in a positive place, Green Arrow would do well to recall his own familial hurdles before calling out Batman&#39;s.
