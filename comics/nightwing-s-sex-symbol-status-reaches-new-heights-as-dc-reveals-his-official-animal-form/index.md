## Literature Review

Nightwing&#39;s animal form is revealed as Titans: Beast World begins, but beyond the transformation, DC promises &#34;a lot of pain to come.&#34;




As DC&#39;s Titans: Beast World event officially begins, heroes and villains across the DC Universe are taking on new animal forms - including Dick Grayson&#39;s Nightwing. However, while there&#39;s a lot of fun to be had with DC&#39;s iconic heroes suddenly sprouting claws and tails, the creative team behind the event are warning fans that it&#39;s going to get really, really dark.




Following comments revealing Nightwing&#39;s animal form, Beast World, Titans and Nightwing writer Tom Taylor has taken to X to showcase Dick Grayson&#39;s transformation. It&#39;s revealed that during Beast World, Nightwing will stalk the city of Blüdhaven as an anthropomorphic fox.


 

The form is a clear play on Nightwing&#39;s sex symbol status. Ever since he graduated from being the first Robin, Dick Grayson has grown into one of DC&#39;s most iconic heart throbs, with a running joke where his butt is the talk of the superhero (and supervillain) world. Now, DC&#39;s foxiest hero is making that accolade very, very literal.



There is a lot of pain to come for our characters in Beast World.

 Nightwing Becomes a Fox for Titans: Beast World 
Dick Grayson&#39;s Animal Form Is Finally Revealed


          

In the Titans&#39; first official comic event story, the group (who recently replaced the Justice League as DC&#39;s premier superteam) will face an alien being known as the Necrostar. To fight back, Beast Boy will use his powers to become a member of the &#39;Star Conqueror&#39; species, causing his abilities to go haywire. As a result, Beast Boy will release an army of spores which transform all those they touch into animal monstrosities.

Fans had speculated that as a leader figure to the Titans, Nightwing wouldn&#39;t experience an animal transformation - he&#39;ll be at the forefront of shutting down Beast Boy&#39;s horrific new form, so it made sense he&#39;d be fighting the animal plague, not joining it. However, Taylor&#39;s release of Sweeney Boo&#39;s cover for Titans #6 - as well as the release of Clayton Henry&#39;s art for Titans: Beast World #6 - shows Nightwing in full feral form. In a smart move, Beast World has given tie-in creative teams a lot of latitude with each animal form, allowing for some funny, some scary, and some insightful transformations.






 Beast World&#39;s Animal Forms Have a Lot to Say About DC&#39;s Heroes 
The Bat-Family Transformations Are a Fascinating Choice
         

Images of the Beast World heroes and villains have been steadily released over the past few months, with each new hero acting as a fascinating reinvention - the regal Black Adam will become a lion, the chaotic Harley Quinn is a muscular rabbit, and Power Girl will become a Phoenix in seeming reference to the Kryptonian legend of the Firebird. Meanwhile, the Bat-Family are adopting mainly canine forms - as well as Nightwing&#39;s fox, Batman and Red Hood are becoming wolves, while the always independent Damian Wayne has been revealed as a cat. Several villains will also transform - Flash villain Godspeed is a deadly hornet, while Black Manta becomes his underwater namesake.



There&#39;s a lot more going on in this story than it looks on the surface level.


– Tom Taylor







There seems to be some kind of psychological component about what animal each character becomes, which makes it even funnier that the debonair Nightwing - who recently crossed the boundaries of reality to flirt with The Office&#39;s Karen Filippelli - sees himself in orange. However, as fun as it is to expose the subconscious animal identities of DC&#39;s heroes, Taylor has also promised a dark edge to a story which, at its heart, is about a hero losing control and jeopardizing the entire world.

 Beast World Isn&#39;t Just About the Animals 
The Titans Event Will Rewrite DC&#39;s Power Structure, with a Villain on Top
         

Comic events often use a &#39;bait and switch&#39; approach where the threat that starts the story isn&#39;t necessarily the threat that ends it - see Marvel&#39;s Age of Ultron or DC&#39;s recent Shadow War as obvious examples. In the case of Beast World, Beast Boy&#39;s transformation will be a major problem - and the event&#39;s World Tour tie-in issues will explore how each hero deals with the animal outbreak in their own city - but Amanda Waller and Doctor Hate are behind the scenes, working to seize power and destroy the Titans&#39; legacy. In an interview with AIPT, Taylor says:





I think a lot of people are going to go into this expecting to see like a romp with a bunch of beast people - a bunch of people who are turning to otters and kangaroos and stuff, but it’s kind of not that for a lot of this. There&#39;s a lot more going on in this story than it looks on the surface level. Yes, you do get Nightwing turned into a fox because we’d be inhuman monsters not to do that. People want to see that. And, yes, somebody in the Gotham group turned Harley Quinn into a giant, muscle-bound bunny. There is a lot of pain to come for our characters in Beast World.


Indeed, Ivan Reis, Danny Miki and Brad Anderson&#39;s cover to Titans: Beast World #5 confirms the return of Doctor Hate - a powerful magic-user who has been tasked with getting the world to hate and fear its heroes. As revealed in Dawn of DC Primer #1 (Joshua Williamson and Leandro Fernández), Amanda Waller has a new mission to kill off every superhero. Over the last year, she&#39;s been steadily growing in influence thanks to the efforts of her various thralls, from Peacemaker to the Penguin to the mysterious Doctor Hate.




Taylor has confirmed Waller will have a major part in Beast World, and promises the event will genuinely realign DC&#39;s status quo, telling AIPT &#34;Amanda Waller is a very large part of that.&#34; It seems that while fans&#39; attention has been on details like Nightwing&#39;s new fox form, Titans: Beast World isn&#39;t quite as playful as it appears, beginning with Beast Boy&#39;s tragic fall into villainy, and the ascension of the Suicide Squad&#39;s heartless leader, Amanda Waller.

Titans: Beast World #1 is coming from DC Comics November 28.
