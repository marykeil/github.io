## Literature Review

Forget about kryptonite. A misunderstanding causes Batmanâ€™s ally to reveal an improved batarang that uses magic to take down Kryptonians.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Action Comics #1059 ahead!China&#39;s Batman might not be as famous as his Western counterpart, but he&#39;s refined one classic weapon to take down any Kryptonian. As a mysterious case nearly claims Super-Man&#39;s life, the Bat-Man of China returns to the DC Universe to aid his friend and reveals a surprisingly effective weapon that could even harm Superman.




In Action Comics #1059&#39;s story &#34;Secret Identity Part Two&#34; by Gene Luen Yang and Viktor Bogdanovic, Kenan Kong, the Super-Man of China, has suffered a psychic attack after learning Superman&#39;s secret identity. However, while in between life and death, Kenan manages to channel his qi and heals himself.

          

Just as Super-Man revives himself, Bat-Man arrives, worried that Kenan is in danger. Bat-Man, erroneously believing Superboy had harmed Super-Man, gets into a fight with Conner. Superboy breaks Bat-Man&#39;s Robinbot, leading Bat-Man to pull out a strange green batarang. After throwing it at Superboy and cutting him deeply, Bat-Man reveals that this batarang was forged from the scales of a magic snake.


 Bat-Man&#39;s Magic Batarang is a Lethal Anti-Superman Weapon 
          




While Batman is the de facto Dark Knight of the DC Universe, he&#39;s not the only one around. New Super-Man revealed that China&#39;s Ministry of Self-Reliance had several facilities to create equivalents of Western superheroes. One such facility was the Academy of the Bat, an elite training program where cadets all vied for the greatest honor: Becoming the Bat-Man of China. The honor went to Baixi Wang, an extremely capable fighter and detective. Baixi is also a great inventor and personally programmed his robotic crime-fighting assistant, Robinbot. Though some of his tools aren&#39;t as field-tested as Batman&#39;s, Bruce found Baixi&#39;s tech impressive enough to give him membership to Batman Inc.

If anyone knows how to develop anti-Kryptonian tech, it&#39;s Batman. Over the years, the Dark Knight has created plenty of weapons to counter Superman&#39;s strength, many of which feature kryptonite. However, Bat-Man chooses to exploit another Kryptonian weakness for his contingency. Baixi recognizes that Kryptonians are just as vulnerable to magic and has crafted a pretty effective weapon that does serious damage to Superboy. It&#39;s also an ingenious way of modifying one of Batman&#39;s classic toys. Kryptonite can be hard to come by, but the DC Universe is lousy with magic and offers plenty of material for anti-Superman weapons.






 Bat-Man&#39;s Batarangs Prove Kryptonite is a Waste of Time 
          

The irradiated pieces of Superman&#39;s homeworld are effective, but they&#39;re incredibly hard to come by. Magic, on the other hand, is quite commonplace. Baixi could have easily gotten the magic snake scales from his girlfriend Wonder-Woman (whose true form is a giant snake). Magical artifacts are so much easier to come by and in the right hands (like Bat-Man&#39;s), they can be turned into powerful anti-Kryptonian tech. While most anti-Kyptonian tech isn&#39;t necessarily needed, Dark Knights like to be prepared and this Batman&#39;s batarangs make for quite the impressive contingency.

Action Comics #1059 is on sale now from DC Comics.
