## Literature Review

The Green Power Ranger returns in the form of Tommy and Kimberly&#39;s daughter, Olivia Hart, in a new story by original Pink Ranger actor Amy Jo Johnson.




The debut of Olivia Hart is looming as Power Rangers&#39; new alternate universe just teased the arrival of Tommy and Kimberly&#39;s daughter. The romance between the original Green and Pink Rangers is often hailed as one of the most beloved of the franchise, despite the fact that Tommy ultimately ends up with Kat instead of Kimberly. However, the upcoming Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return series will examine if Tommy and Kimberly never broke up, and if the original team of Rangers never disbanded either.




The original Pink Ranger herself, Amy Jo Johnson (who has crafted Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return with Matt Hotson and Nico Leon) gives a special preview of what&#39;s to come via X. Below, readers can find character designs drawn by Dan Mora for a brand-new character being introduced into the series, Olivia Hart.


 

Not much is known about Olivia Hart&#39;s role in the story yet and there are still few elements about the story itself that readers actually know so far. However, the introduction gives readers a further glimpse into the potential that the story can offer.

The original canon of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers sees Jason, Trini, and Zack all replaced by new Rangers, with Kimberly&#39;s exit coming soon after. In this universe, the original core group remains intact with no one leaving. This produces a domino effect of tragedy to come, but Kimberly remaining with the team also means she and Tommy never break up. They go as far as to get married. The story eventually flashes forward in time to the Rangers as adults. With Zordon and Alpha dead, everyone has long put their superhero ambitions behind them, except Jason, whose vigilante heroics as the Red Ranger lead to him going missing, forcing a reunion between the surviving members of the team.

Among the surviving members is Kimberly, who has kept busy raising her daughter, Olivia. Her character designs showcase her in and out of her Ranger uniform. When she&#39;s not in Ranger mode, Olivia&#39;s civilian clothes include a green jacket with pink trim, paying homage to the colors her parents sported proudly once upon a time. Meanwhile, in Ranger mode, she makes her father proud by following in his footsteps and sporting the outfit of the most iconic Green Ranger that the franchise has ever known.

Again, there remains much to be revealed about this upcoming series, so one can only speculate for now. In releasing character designs for the other Rangers, two designs that are noticeably absent are those for Trini and Tommy. This would seem to suggest that, like their real-life actor counterparts, the characters have passed away in this universe. This seems to be confirmed as past summaries allude to the former Rangers having to &#34;mourn the losses of beloved friends.&#34; This in itself suggests that Olivia Hart is more than just an act of fan service for fans of the Tommy/Kimberly pairing, but a means to pay tribute to the Tommy Oliver character, as well as the late, great actor Jason David Frank.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the death of Zordon likely means that all the core Rangers still have their morphers and never had to give them up to anyone. While most of the Rangers have chosen not to use them, Jason has actively continued being a Ranger. When he goes missing, this may open the door for Olivia to obtain Tommy&#39;s old morpher. Whether she&#39;s given Tommy&#39;s old morpher or opts to take it, Olivia Hart will need to join the Power Rangers to save Jason.




Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Return can be supported through Kickstarter.
