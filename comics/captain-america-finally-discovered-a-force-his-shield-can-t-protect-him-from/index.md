## Literature Review

Captain America&#39;s shield can protect him from the attacks of most of his enemies, but his latest foe is surpassing his strongest defense.




Despite the strength of Captain America&#39;s shield, it isn&#39;t perfect, as proven by Captain America #4 (2023). It has one glaring weakness that could cause the super soldier some major complications. While it can withstand the majority of physical attacks, it doesn&#39;t hold fast against a particular type of foe.




Captain America&#39;s iconic shield has overgone a few changes over the years, first being made of steel and now consisting of vibranium. It has occasionally also been reimagined as an energy shield. Cap is adept at using the defensive tool as his primary weapon apart from his fists. This shield and weapon combination is capable of absorbing most energy waves thanks to its vibranium construction.

This hero typically faces foes who use standard types of weaponry as well as base combat. He fights extremists and soldiers most of the time, as well as a few aliens. However, there are some forces that the shield can&#39;t withstand and defend against very well, including demon fire.




                  Captain America&#39;s Brother Returns to Marvel Continuity - As the 1 Villain Who Can Outfight Him   Steve Rogers finally has a brother again, as Captain America faces a reborn Grant Rogers in a battle for the title of Marvel&#39;s greatest fighter.   


 Captain America is Prepared for Standard Foes, Not Supernatural Ones 
          

Captain America #4 has the creative team of J. Michael Straczynski, Lan Medina, Espen Grundetjern, and Joe Caramagna. The series has shown more about the titular hero&#39;s young life and current struggles as he takes over ownership of his apartment complex. Despite having a more grounded story, a looming threat of a supernatural nature could push Captain America to his limits - especially since his shield appears unlikely to protect him from his newest foe: a demon set on destroying him before he can continue to do more good for others. Captain America doesn&#39;t go up against demons very often, making this encounter with the being Asmoday extra dangerous and revealing about a weakness vibranium has.




The shield Cap wields typically reverses forces it takes or diffuses them. This comes in handy for physical attacks from typical mercenaries or foes with energies that it can handle. Against magic it isn&#39;t as effective as some defenses and against demon fire it has failed. Instead of being able to withstand Asmoday&#39;s attack, Captain America is blown back into water and unable to launch any counterattack, landing in the hospital. The shield&#39;s usual capabilities are inaccessible when facing this kind of power, which could prove fatal to Marvel&#39;s super soldier if he doesn&#39;t get an upgrade or find a way to outsmart his latest foe.



 Captain America Needs to Change Tactics or His Fate Will Be Sealed 
          

Given the shield&#39;s weakness to demon abilities, particularly demon fire, it&#39;s no wonder that other heroes tend to face demons more frequently. Captain America is not equipped to exchange blows with them, being on a different playing field - and not for the positive. Like with magic, he has to adapt to the combat style and outsmart his enemy. This could prove very difficult against Asmoday, explaining why he is trying to turn to Doctor Strange for more guidance. The Sorcerer Supreme has fought numerous supernatural beings and demons, making him far more knowledgeable about the dangers Captain America could face ahead. With his shield becoming a weakened defense, Captain America needs to change strategies quickly to defeat Asmoday and save himself from a torturous fate.
