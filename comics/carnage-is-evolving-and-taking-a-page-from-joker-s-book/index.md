## Literature Review

Carnage and the Joker are two of the most deadly serial killers to ever exist, and now it seems Carnage is learning a lesson from the Joker.




Warning! Contains spoilers for Carnage #1!The two most dangerous serial killers in comic books are Carnage and the Joker, but they actually have very different ideas on how to go about killing people...until now. While they both have body counts in the thousands, the Joker and Carnage don&#39;t agree exactly on how murder should happen, which leads to their one and only team-up eventually breaking down due to this difference in belief. But now, decades later, it seems Cletus Kasady aka Carnage is finally coming around to Joker&#39;s way of thinking.




Carnage&#39;s approach to killing changed in Carnage #1 by Torunn Gronbekk, Pere Perez, Erick Arciniega, and Joe Sabino. In order to drum up worshipers, so he can become a literal god, Carnage has begun killing people in ways that grabs attention and send a message. Instead of just slaughtering people indiscriminately, Carnage is intentionally setting his victims up to be killed slowly and in public places, without his direct involvement.



          

Cletus is hoping this will get people to begin worshiping him, turning them into his cult, so he can attain godhood. And while that&#39;s a main motivator for him, the seed of this idea might&#39;ve been planted long ago by the Joker.

 Carnage Kills A Single Person In A Very Specific Way 


          

Carnage, as his name implies, has always preferred to slaughter people indiscriminately. All Carnage has ever wanted is pure bloodshed and bodies on a mass scale. Never before has he cared about sending a message or killing people in theatrical ways. All he wants is the most death in the shortest time possible. While this has certainly given Carnage an infamous reputation, it hasn&#39;t really driven anyone to worship or pray to him, and considering he&#39;s looking to become a god, those are things he needs. Now, instead of just killing for the sake of it, he&#39;s changing his methods to make people see his views on the world, and potentially bring them to his side.



 Joker and Carnage Argue Over Murder 
          




In one of the many DC/Marvel crossovers, 1995&#39;s Spider-Man and Batman: Disordered Minds by J.M. DeMatteis, Mark Bagley, Scott Hanna, and Mark Farmer, Cletus Kasady decides to join up with the Joker. Cletus is impressed with Joker&#39;s views on life and states that Joker seems to be the only person who actually understands him. But despite this, when the two actually team up, they quickly turn on one another due to their different opinions on murder. While Carnage wants sheer numbers as fast as possible, the Joker wants theatrics. Joker wants to send a message, and views killing as a form of art that takes skill. This disagreement leads the two to trying to murder one another, but decades later it seems Carnage is finally seeing the value of how Joker kills people.

This newest Carnage series from Marvel follows him trying to become a god. But in order for someone to be a god, they need worshipers, they need people who pray to them in their time of need. Carnage doesn&#39;t have this, but he&#39;s working on it. By killing people in Joker&#39;s more flamboyant and theatrical way, Carnage hopes to cement himself in the public consciousness and gather new followers to his way of thinking like never before, in order to finally become a god.
