# Mark Millar Explains Why He Doesnt Want to Create a Shared Universe With His Netflix Adaptations…Yet


## SUMMARY 



  Mark Millar prefers to see his characters adapted as stand-alone franchises before considering a crossover.   Netflix is currently focusing on developing Millarworld titles like Magic Order, Huck, and Prodigy.   Millar hopes to eventually see a crossover in the future, with subtle connections between his franchises laying the foundation over the next decade or more.

## Literature Review

Mark Millar recently discussed his upcoming projects at Netflix, explaining why he&#39;d rather build to an on-screen crossover than start with one.




Mark Millar sold his Millarworld company to Netflix several years ago, with his many titles in production for the streaming service ever since. With the recent success of the author&#39;s Big Game comic crossover series, which unified his characters in a single continuity, many have asked whether this was how his characters would be adapted for the screen – recently, Millar explained on X why that won&#39;t be the case.




Millar responded to fan questions on X, providing updates on the various Millarworld projects in development at Netflix, as well as teasing his hopes for the future, envisioning the &#34;next decade&#34; of superheros on the platform as coming from his roster of creations.


 

Millar explained that he would like to build up successful, individual franchises, before merging them together in a crossover – similar to what he did with the comic book versions of his characters. While this is certainly a patient, and idealistic, plan, it does raise some questions about the realistic chance of seeing a crossover come to fruition.

                  Kingsmen&#39;s Eggsy Returns - Super-Spy Hero Resurrected in Mark Millar&#39;s &#34;Big Game&#34; Finale   Much of Mark Millar&#39;s Big Game miniseries was a brutal slaughter; the final issue of the series delivers a cathartic ending, including Eggsy&#39;s return.   





 Mark Millar Suggests A Netflix Crossover Event Is &#34;A Decade&#34; Away 
Is A Long-Term Plan To Build Millarworld On Screen Sustainable?
         

&#34;I don&#39;t feel shared universe are a strength in live action anymore,&#34; Millar explained on X. Following the recent conclusion of the labor strikes in Hollywood, work on various TV and movie properties is set to resume – with a number of Millarworld titles among those that will go back into production. The creator noted that Netflix is &#34;mainly focusing on Magic Order, Huck, and Prodigy&#34; right now, citing three of his popular creations that are priorities for the company. He stated that two more projects, the teen vampire series Night Club and the crime story Supercrooks, are in development &#34;in [the] background.]

The question fans should have about this approach is whether Netflix can commit to patiently building multiple series over years, if the numbers don&#39;t ultimately bare it out. The streamer has become increasingly merciless with its cancelation decisions in recent years. Even if multiple Millarverse series make it to screen, all of them would likely have to be major hits, running for multiple seasons, to enable a crossover. Then the question becomes not of success, but of budget. Of course, with Millar functioning as the president of the &#34;Millarworld Division&#34; at Netflix, the series will certainly have the best advocate possible at every stage of development.






 Fans Will Have To Enjoy &#34;Subtle Connections&#34; For Now 
The Seeds Of A Crossover Will Be Planted In Millarworld Adaptations

 

&#34;I&#39;d love Chrononauts too at some point,&#34; Millar added, referencing his time travel series, which played a key role in the Big Game crossover. The recently concluded series – which combined many of the creator&#39;s titles in a battle between good and evil that sprawled across not only the boundaries of different previously distinct narratives, but time and space, life and death as well. With Mark Millar advocating for stand-alone franchises containing &#34;very sublte connections&#34; proceeding a crossover, fans should be excited for the future of Millarworld at Netflix.
