## Literature Review

DC&#39;s Knight Terrors event gave fans some of the scariest artwork of the past year, as heroes and villains alike navigated their worst nightmares.




DC&#39;s biggest summer event, Knight Terrors, gave fans some of the most terrifying variant covers in years. 2023 was a big year for events for Marvel and DC. From the rise of a Gang War started by Spider-Man, to the Dawn of DC, which kicked off a major reboot for DC&#39;s characters, both publishers served up major crossover storylines. However, none were as gripping as Knight Terrors.
This summer-long event dropped some of DC&#39;s most iconic heroes and villains into the world of horror as they navigated their worst nightmares at the hands of the villain Insomnia. The surreal nature of the series gave fans some of the creepiest stories surrounding the characters yet, but what made it stand out most of all was its artwork. The art for each miniseries placated the market to show just how major this horror event was for the DC Universe, paving the way for some of the most terrifying variant covers to advertise the event in DC&#39;s long history. These are some of the scariest variants the event had to offer.









 








 10  Harley Quinn Experiences An Arachnophobe&#39;s Worst Fear 
Riccardo Federici, Knight Terrors: First Blood #1

        

The first wave of variants that kicked off the Knight Terrors event had the important job of grabbing fans attention, which many did by playing on real-world fears. Riccardo Federici took one of the most common phobias, fear of spiders, and made it absolute nightmare fuel with this realistic variant cover. The artwork depicting Harley Quinn covered in spiders is unsettling because of how life-like it looks. There&#39;s no separation between the comic world and the real world here, as Federici attempted to make Harley look as real as possible, to resounding success. The sheer look of terror on Harley&#39;s face is haunting, making it one of the most iconic covers from the Knight Terrors event.





 9  The Flash Faces Cosmic Terrors 
Daniel Bayliss, Knight Terrors: The Flash #1

        

Sending the Flash into his worst nightmares without finding a way to incorporate the Speed Force would have been a wasted opportunity during the Knight Terrors event. Daniel Bayliss&#39; variant for Flash&#39;s Knight Terrors story perfectly plays on this concept with this terrifying design that taps into the world of cosmic horror, giving the speedster a Lovecraftian spin. The use of purple in the background feels otherworldly, as Flash attempts to evade an eerie number of hands pulling him back. It&#39;s all tied together with the terrifying image of the Flash&#39;s costume housing an empty vessel, with no one actually wearing it. It&#39;s an eerie image that taps into what makes cosmic horror so terrifying.





 8  Shazam Gets A Bloody New Look 
Hayden Sherman, Knight Terrors: Shazam! #1

        

While Billy Batson himself wasn&#39;t the main dreamer in the Shazam! side story, he still got a frightening new look in the form of his twisted alter-ego Teth-Shazam, where he took gained the ruthless personality of Black Adam. To showcase this updated look for the hero, artist Hayden Sherman created an incredible variant cover with Shazam front-and-center. However, his suit is a little off. Rather than the costume being his traditional red, it&#39;s covered in blood, indicating to fans just how ruthless he can be in his new Black Adam-inspired costume. With the blood of his enemies replacing fabric for the red color, this cover emphasizes the potential horror of an evil Shazam.





 7  Harley Quinn Channels Stephen King&#39;s Carrie 
Tula Lotay, Knight Terrors: Harley Quinn #1

        

Harley Quinn is no stranger to tackling popular culture in her stories, given how universal she has become as a character. Therefore, it&#39;s no surprise that one variant for her Knight Terrors story would feature an homage to horror&#39;s most popular author, Stephen King. The artwork by Tula Lotay actually spans across both issues of the mini-story, as it&#39;s revealed that Harley herself is the culprit behind dousing one of her variants in pigs&#39; blood. However, the actual recreation of the iconic moment itself is hauntingly beautiful. The use of reds, highlighting Harley covered in blood shortly after a happy moment, is a loving homage to one of King&#39;s best stories.





 6  Punchline Succumbs To The Unknown 
Ejikure, Knight Terrors: Punchline #2

        

Not even the newest Joker was safe from Insomnia&#39;s wrath during DC&#39;s massive summer event. Ejikure&#39;s contribution to Punchline&#39;s story in the Knight Terrors saga is about as uncanny as horror can get, as she literally finds herself being pulled into a clay-like cover by bodyless arms and watchful eyes. Based on the story within the pages, it&#39;s likely that this represents Punchline being pulled into the internet, though it never entirely clear, leaving fans with the horror of what truly lies past the cover. Ejikure&#39;s cover is a brilliant depiction of how the scariest thing about horror can be the unknown, as it leaves what lies beyond the veil up to the reader&#39;s imagination.





 5  Nightwing And Two-Face Prove Sometimes Less Is More 
Jason Shawn Alexander, Knight Terrors: Nightwing #2

        

Artist Jason Shawn Alexander&#39;s variant cover for Knight Terrors: Nightwing #2 isn&#39;t as surreal as most of the others in the 2023 horror event. However, this doesn&#39;t mean its simplicity counts it out as one of the most terrifying of the year. This basic concept for a cover excels in depicting dread with its brilliant use of shadows and expressions as it features Two-Face grasping Nightwing&#39;s head. The linework, along with the use of dark colors, make this cover more terrifying than it has any right to be, as it runs with its simplicity to make one of the scariest covers in the Knight Terrors event.





 4  Beast Boy Becomes One Of Horror&#39;s Scariest Movie Monsters 
Christian Ward, Knight Terrors: Titans #1

        

DC&#39;s follow-up to Knight Terrors, the Beast World story event, began with the tragic death of Beast Boy. Before that, his shapeshifting abilities were given a dark treatment, as artist Christian Ward delivered a ferocious redesign with a perfect homage to John Carpenter&#39;s 1982 film The Thing. The design of Beast Boy&#39;s wolf amalgamation is a perfect callback to the iconic dog creature scene from the cult horror movie, faithfully replicating what made the iconic film feel so terrifying. There are elements that are familiar, but as a whole the beast is something otherworldly, making it absolutely terrifying to look at.





 3  Zatanna Takes On A Disturbing Eight-Legged Form 
Chuma Hill, Knight Terrors: Zatanna #2

        

Zatanna may have been one of the few heroes to resist the sleep spell placed by Insomnia, but that doesn&#39;t mean she was safe from artists depicting her biggest nightmares. This cover crafted by Chuma Hill transforms the mystical Zatanna into one of her creepiest forms ever, as she becomes more spider-like than human. She is depicted as growing spindly legs out her back, as well as a hinged jaw, brimming with fangs, eager to consume her prey. What&#39;s even worse are the eyes that pop up around her, making this arachnid form one of the most terrifying transformations throughout the Knight Terrors saga.





 2  Cyborg Meets A Fate Worse Than Death 
Christian Ward, Knight Terrors: Titans #2

        

Christian Ward had more inspired work to share for DC fans, in the Knight Terrors story featuring the Teen Titans. This time, Cyborg takes the spotlight, in what could be his biggest nightmare. Cyborg has always feared become more machine than man, following the accident that led to his father recreating his body. This horrific artwork depicts his worst fear come to life, as he&#39;s plugged into what is likely Titans Tower, serving as a living battery. The only remnant of his humanity is his skin, slowly decaying, being kept alive just so he can continue to be used as a power source. Ward&#39;s nightmarish image will certainly remain burned in readers&#39; minds for years to come.





 1  Batman&#39;s Biggest Fears Erupt From Within 
Puppeteer Lee, Knight Terrors: Batman #1

        

One of the most common themes present throughout the Knight Terrors event was that the most horrific imagery often emerged from the minds of fan-favorite heroes. Not only is artist Puppeteer Lee&#39;s bone-chilling take on Batman the best, but it&#39;s also the scariest variant cover of the whole event. Lee reached deep into gothic imagery for this creation, as a terrifying batlike creature, with Joe Chill&#39;s handgun as a head, emerges from a young Bruce Wayne&#39;s mouth. The cover for Knight Terrors: Batman #1 is an image that constitures pure nightmare fuel, and shows that Batman has the darkest fears of all lying inside of him, making this DC&#39;s most terrifying Knight Terrors variant cover.
