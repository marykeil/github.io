# Gotham s New Villain Is a Terrifying Reimagining of an Underrated Killer


## SUMMARY 



  Moth-er, a new villain in Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham, takes a creepy twist on Killer Moth&#39;s schtick.   The Gotham in this storyline is devoid of Batman&#39;s usual rogues&#39; gallery, but it&#39;s just as twisted.   Moth-er is far more unsettling and sinister than Killer Moth, with his ferocious attacks and wicked claws.

## Literature Review

An unsettling new villain comes to Gotham that vastly improves a motif popularized by one Batman rogue. Witness the debut of the creepy foe, Moth-er!




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2!A new villain has come to the DC Universe, and he&#39;s a horrifying update to a surprising Batman villain. Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham is set in a world that lacks many of the Dark Knight&#39;s usual foes. But a new enemy takes one B-list baddie&#39;s schtick and gives it a seriously creepy overhaul.




In Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2 by Rafael Grampa with Mat Lopes, Detective Gordon is continuing to track down a serial killer in Gotham and believes anyone ever treated by Arkham Asylum psychiatrist Dr. Charles Quinton is at risk. Gordon visits one potential victim, a local priest named Vincent Strasbourg III.

          

Unbeknownst to Gordon, Strasbourg is part of a secret society known as Stadtgeist. Strasbourg excuses himself and puts on a sinister-looking moth costume. Calling himself Moth-er, he attacks Gordon with a sharp pair of claws and a swarm of black-winged moths. Moth-er nearly kills Gordon, but the villain is attacked by an unnamed woman, causing Moth-er to flee.


 Moth-er is Gotham&#39;s New Creepy Villain 


          




Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham takes place on a radically different Earth from the Prime DC Universe. While Batman still protects Gotham City, the new metropolis is devoid of the usual rogues&#39; gallery that haunts the standard one. However, this Gotham is just as, if not more twisted than the one fans are accustomed to. Not only is it plagued with horrifying social ills like slavery, but it also has villains that make the Joker look sane. One such villain is Crytoon, a constantly weeping criminal who is obsessed with an old-school cartoon character and kills victims in over-the-top, dramatic ways.

This world may not have Batman&#39;s usual rogues&#39; gallery, but Moth-er does seem to take after one notable Dark Knight villain. In the Prime DC Universe, Batman has his own moth-themed foe in Killer Moth, a professional villain who originally got into the game to be the criminal version of Batman. While Killer Moth isn&#39;t exactly an A-lister like Joker or Two-Face, he is quite the capable villain and has been plaguing Gotham for years. Moth-er, however, seems to take the moth element a bit further than Drury Walker ever did. Not only does his costume look more like a demented moth, but Strasbourg actually uses moths as weapons, a much more creepy MO than Killer Moth ever had.






 Moth-er is Far More Unsettling Than Killer Moth 
          

Killer Moth is an interesting villain, if only for his amusingly garish outfit. But despite the name, he could hardly be called one of Batman&#39;s more intimidating foes. Moth-er, on the other hand, just looks downright sinister. He attacks with ferocity and those sharp claws of his look positively wicked. It&#39;s not known how he&#39;s controlling his moth collection, but the image of Gordon being enveloped by the swarm shows just how disturbing that kind of attack is. While Killer Moth has carved out his own unique place in the DC Universe, Moth-er is already giving the Batman foe a run for his money.

Batman: Gargoyle of Gotham #2 is on sale now from DC Comics.
