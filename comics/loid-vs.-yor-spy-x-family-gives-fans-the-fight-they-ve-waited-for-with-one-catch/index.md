## Literature Review

Yor and Loid from SPY x FAMILY are certain to clash once they discover each other&#39;s identities and the manga is showing what that may look like.




Warning! Contains spoilers for SPY x FAMILY Chapter 79!Since SPY x FAMILY first established the premise of its fake central family, fans have anticipated what a fight between Loid and Yor may look like, and the manga actually delivered on that promise... with a catch. Tatsuya Endo&#39;s SPY x FAMILY has long teased a fight between Yor and Loid given that they secretly work for rival factions. What fans of the anime might not know is that the manga delivered on the promise of a brawl between the two leads, with a big caveat.




A version of Loid Vs. Yor played out in chapter #79 of the manga, translated by Casey Loe. After Yor helps some of her coworkers with their work, they all go out drinking together, and in her drunken state, she comes to think that it&#39;s weird to have no complaints about one&#39;s spouse. Because of that, Yor decides to kill Loid in order to preserve the apparent normalcy of their relationship, leading to an intense confrontation between them as Twilight and Thorn Princess.

          

Ultimately, Yor and Loid&#39;s fight was all in Yor&#39;s imagination, but it is almost believable at the moment, given how the series has laid the groundwork for their potential confrontation before this.

A true fight between Loid and Yor would be a big event in SPY x FAMILY, and the series has already shown how that would go. Episode #5 of the anime had a drunken Yor fight Loid as part of a show Loid put on for Anya, and Yor had completely overpowered Loid from the very start, the only reason she didn&#39;t win being that she tripped over herself and fell asleep. Granted, Loid wasn&#39;t trying to hurt Yor, but it still implies that if a true fight did break out between them as teased in chapter #79, Yor would likely win, but it would be interesting to see, nonetheless.

 Yor&#39;s Imaginary Clash Hints At SPY X FAMILY&#39;s Future 
          




While neither Loid nor Yor seems to suspect each other&#39;s secret, circumstances beyond their control may be setting the two against each other. When Yor previously mentioned Loid&#39;s interest in the Desmond family to the Shopkeeper, her mysterious supervisor, the Shopkeeper didn&#39;t seem very pleased, implying that he may consider eliminating Loid in the future. Beyond this immediate threat, Yor&#39;s brother Yuri is always trying to prove Loid to be a traitor in order to prevent him from getting closer to Yor. And there is always the risk that Anya, who knows both of her parents&#39; secrets may slip given that she is a child with very little filter.

No matter how this showdown between Loid and Yor occurs, the chapter gave fans a great preview of what it may look like. While SPY x FAMILY tends to lean more towards comedy than serious drama, chapter #79 shows which side their fight would fall under, and with the work that was already done to show how a fight between them would go, seeing that in a more serious light would be the biggest event in the series. Whether or not SPY x FAMILY decides to follow through on that is another story, but there&#39;s plenty of reason to be excited about it, regardless.
