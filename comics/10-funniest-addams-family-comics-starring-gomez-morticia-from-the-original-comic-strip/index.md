## Literature Review

Gomez and Morticia Addams are madly in love and completely unhappy together and that all started with Charles Addams&#39; original hilarious comics.




While each member of The Addams Family has their own charms, the parents, Gomez and Morticia Addams, have been the perfect match in every version of the gothic characters across comics, television and movies. Charles Addams started drawing the characters who would become The Addams Family in 1937. While his macabre sense of humor is all over every comic, his heart is also there for all to see.
Having been married three times in his life, each of his wives was a pale, dark-haired woman who could easily be compared to Morticia Addams. Putting pictures of Gomez and Charles Addams side by side, one can also see the resemblance. Of course, Morticia and Gomez are seriously in love, but the way they express that affection is very funny for fans. Read on for 10 of the perfect couple&#39;s funniest moments.
            
 
 11 Funniest Addams Family Comics Starring Wednesday (From the Original Comic Strip) 
The fan-favorite daughter of the Addams Family, Wednesday had some great moments in the original comics - including jokes used in later adaptations.












 








 10  Morticia Addams Is in &#34;A Strange Mood&#34; 
September 25, 1948

        

An important part of romance that will last you to the cemetery and back is understanding the other person&#39;s hobbies. Here, Gomez knows his wife so well that when she spends some time arranging living flowers with full, white blooms, he knows something is up. Maybe Morticia really wants to change things up; or maybe she wants to make sure she has an excellent graveyard bouquet for a relative.





 9  Pugsley Joins the Scouts 
November 3, 1945

        

Children need to be given space to try new things and find out who they really are. However, parents don&#39;t always agree with the things their kids try. This can be seen in this comic where Gomez and Morticia are horrified to discover that their son Pugsley has joined the Boy Scouts. Though the couple are always a loving team, here they try to pinpoint where Pugsley could have gotten this ghastly idea.





 8  The Addams Family Believes in Santa Claus 
December 27, 1952

        

The charm of The Addams Family is that they have many of the same traditions as &#34;normal&#34; American families, but just a little twisted. Gomez delights that his children are still young enough to believe in Santa Claus and wait up for him on Christmas Eve. However, the kids are waiting with a roaring fire to burn him as he comes down the chimney. The Thing also watches excitedly from upstairs, staying up to catch the man in red. Gomez and Morticia are so proud.
In the original comic, &#34;The Thing&#34; was a strange creature often drawn spying on the Addams from cracks in the wall or the stair banisters. For the TV show, it was decided &#34;Thing&#34; would become just a helping hand. This iteration of the character stuck. 






 7  Morticia Misses Gomez Madly 
August 6, 1949

        

Absence makes the heart grow fonder. While little is known about what Gomez Addams&#39; actual business is, a business trip separates him from his love, and she writes him a sweet letter letting him know she misses him. With updates on all of their poisonous plants and garden pests, she shares all the important details of their crumbling, gothic manor and asks him to return. There&#39;s no French, as Gomez&#39;s adoration of Morticia speaking the language of love was added in the TV series, never the comics.





 6  The Addams Family&#39;s Best Baby Names 
August 9, 1958

        

There are many jokes about future Addams babies in the comic, though it took until Addams Family Values for baby Pubert to finally appear. Here, Morticia has a nighttime knitting session with Grandmama Frump, talking Biblical baby names. In case it surprises anyone that Gomez and Morticia would pull baby names from a religious book, Cain and Ananias are two very Addams names. Cain killed his brother Abel after God likes Abel&#39;s sacrifice more. The Ananias that Morticia is likely referencing here is a wealthy man who joined the church, but lied about how much money he had and was instantly struck dead. Surely both are proud and noble names to the Addams Family.
&#34;Pubert&#34; was the name Charles Addams wanted to give to the previously unnamed family son when the 1964 TV series was in development. Network censors wouldn&#39;t allow it, so the boy became Pugsley. 






 5  Family Photo Day for Pugsley and Wednesday Addams 
June 9, 1951
        

Some families have trouble getting their children to smile in pictures. Here, the Addams parents have trouble getting their kids to put on a nice sneer for the family photo. While Gomez is often shown smiling, Morticia usually has a dour, strained look on her face. As this comic shows, maybe that expression is her way of showing how much she loves her husband and children.





 4  Gomez and Morticia Are Proud of Pugsley 
February 12, 1949

        

While both Addams children were ooky, kooky, and altogether spooky, Pugsley was a little more outgoing with his subversive and deadly behavior than Wednesday in the comic. Here, Morticia and Gomez couldn&#39;t be more proud of how their boy is handling school. Opposite of their reactions in &#34;The Cub Scout&#34; comic, they&#39;re so happy to learn their boy is raising hell with the other kids and some teachers. &#34;Extraordinary morbid ingenuity&#34; will give them bragging rights at family functions for years to come.





 3  Morticia Knits a Baby Sweater Fit for an Addams 
From the book Monster Rally, 1950

        

 This comic was immortalized in the end of the 1991 Addams Family movie, setting up the sequel Addams Family Values. For such a glamorous, nocturnal woman, it seems Morticia Addams is always knitting. As mentioned above, Gomez and Morticia never had more children than Wednesday and Pugsley in the comic, but using this moment to expand the family in the films was ingenious.





 2  The Addams Family Gets a Babysitter 
January 28, 1956

        

Morticia and Gomez may love dead flowers and gloomy weather, but their romance together always thrives. Here, they&#39;re heading out for a wonderful date night and leaving Wednesday and Pugsley with a babysitter. It&#39;s not clear if poor Miss Weems has been there before, but at least they warn her to keep her back to the wall and watch out for traps in the Addams manor.





 1  Gomez and Morticia Are Completely Unhappy, and That&#39;s Wonderful 
November 14, 1942
        

Some couples seem to have their own language that people on the outside will never understand. Of course, the eternally in love Gomez and Morticia would frame their romance in terms of devastation and unhappiness. Their particular ways are what drew them to each other and have kept them at the height of couple goals for more than 80 years. Flowery promises of love are temporary; the best romance is to find someone to be completely unhappy with forever. Above all, Morticia and Gomez Addams&#39; romance in The Addams Family shows that the best lifelong partnerships are with someone who can always make the other person laugh.
