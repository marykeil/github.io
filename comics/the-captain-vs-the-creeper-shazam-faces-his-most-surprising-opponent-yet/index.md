# “The Captain vs The Creeper” Shazam Faces His Most Surprising Opponent Yet


## SUMMARY 



  Shazam is set to face his strangest opponent yet: the Creeper, in the upcoming issue of Shazam #9.   Despite the Creeper being a street-level character with moderate strength, it&#39;s unclear if he will receive a powerful upgrade to challenge Shazam.   It is speculated that the Creeper may possess a magic relic or be under a spell to enhance his strength in order to stand a chance against Shazam.

## Literature Review

Solicitations reveal that Shazam is about to face off with the most unexpected DC superhero around, the Creeper! But does the odd hero stand a chance?




The Champion of Shazam is about to fight his most bizarre and creepiest opponent in years. Since Billy Batson reclaimed his Captain title, he&#39;s been plagued by gods and other strange foes. But the Earth&#39;s Mightiest Mortal&#39;s latest battle is set to be the oddest challenge he&#39;s faced yet.




The New Year has arrived and thanks to solicitations, fans know what they can expect in 2024. A sneak peek at DC Comics&#39; March offerings reveals the latest challenge awaiting Shazam and his family in Shazam #9. After facing the gods Shazam gets his powers from, an enraged Black Adam, and an army of space dinosaurs, the Captain is taking on DC&#39;s weirdest antihero, the Creeper. The solicited text emphatically points out that the Captain will be doing battle with Jack Ryan&#39;s wacky, yellow-skinner alter ego. Dan Mora&#39;s cover also gives a glimpse at the fight. The Creeper has a mad look in his eyes as he perches on the Captain&#39;s shoulders, much to Batson&#39;s annoyance.



          



  Shazam #9   Release Date: 3/5/24   Writer: Mark Waid   Artist: Emanuela Lupacchino   Cover Artist: Dan Mora   Variant Artists: Bernard Chang, Chris Samnee, Ricardo Lopez Ortiz   The Captain has thwarted a cadre of space dinosaurs, talked the gods into being reasonable for five little minutes, and managed to look A-OK doing it. So what’s left? WELL WE CREEP. YEEEAAAHHH, WE KEEP IT ON THE DOWN-LOW. It’s the fight of the century: THE CAPTAIN VS. THE CREEPER!  





 Shazam is Taking On DC&#39;s Odd &#39;Hero&#39;, the Creeper 
          

Ever since Billy Batson finally escaped from the Rock of Eternity, things have been one chaotic adventure to the next. After the events of Lazarus Planet, Billy&#39;s magic alter ego the Captain fell under the influence of the gods he draws his power from. Zeus, Atlas, Mercury and others all took turns taking control of Batson when in his powerful Champion form, all for the sake of using him to remind Earth&#39;s mortals of the true power the gods wielded. However, thanks to a side deal with Solomon, the Captain has enough wisdom to overcome the gods&#39; influence and resume his duties unaffected.

While the cover seems to promise an interesting battle, it&#39;s hard to imagine a fight where Creeper wins out over Shazam. After all, Billy&#39;s Captain form is as strong as Superman (the Man of Steel even said so during a Final Crisis tie-in). Creeper, however, is a street-level character with moderate strength. He may have been magic during the New 52 when he was reinvented as an oni, but that hasn&#39;t been the case for Jack Ryder&#39;s alter ego in some time. Of course, not every bit of information has been released yet, so the question must be asked: Is the Creeper getting a powerful upgrade?






 How Can the Creeper Take on Shazam? 
          

While the Creeper has fought some unbelievable threats in the past, it&#39;s a pretty big ask of him to challenge Shazam. One can assume that Ryder may stumble his way into possessing a magic relic or falling under a spell that enhances his strength enough to take on someone as powerful as the Captain. It&#39;s really the only way someone like him can fight Shazam without being knocked out almost instantly. Regardless, seeing the Creeper take on someone as powerful as Shazam is sure to be an interesting and chaotic sight.

Shazam #9 is available from DC Comics on March 5th.
