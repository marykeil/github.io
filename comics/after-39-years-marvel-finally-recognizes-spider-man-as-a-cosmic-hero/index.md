## Literature Review

Despite his reputation as a street-level superhero, Spider-Man has been to space tons of times. Now he&#39;s finally getting recognized as a cosmic hero.




Warning: Spoilers for Wolverine #40!Finally, Marvel has given Spider-Man the proper respect he deserves as a cosmic hero. Typically, Spidey is considered by most to be a street-level hero, which makes sense. After all, someone doesn&#39;t gain a reputation as a &#34;friendly neighborhood Spider-Man&#34; without spending most of his time in the neighborhood. That doesn&#39;t mean he doesn&#39;t have skills elsewhere, namely outer space.




The best of Spidey&#39;s space skills are showcased in Wolverine #40 by Benjamin Percy, Ibrahim Moustafa, Frank D&#39;Armata, VC&#39;s Cory Petit, Tom Muller, and Jay Bowen. Spider-Man is no stranger to having adventures in outer space. Not only was he a focal point of Marvel&#39;s 1984 Secret Wars event, but he also had a secret adventure during Secret Wars that has never been revealed until now.



          



All things considered, Spider-Man should be viewed as an expert when it comes to space missions. It looks like Marvel agrees, and this issue showcases the best of what he is capable of in the deep unknown.


 Spider-Man Helps Wolverine on a Mission in Space 
          




Wolverine left Krakoa just in time before the Mutant Massacre at the Hellfire Gala this year. In the immediate aftermath, he has been preoccupied with tying up loose ends regarding a conflict with Beast, who Wolverine was convinced was going to kill him. On top of that, he&#39;s had clones of himself to chase after throughout the world that have also been distracting him. But now, he&#39;s finally free to set his sights squarely on the organization that is singlehandedly trying to wipe mutants off the face of the Earth: Orchis.

When Wolverine needs help flying out to find and destroy an Orchis space station, Spider-Man is the first person he asks for help. Even Peter is surprised, but he more than earns his stripes once he gets the position. He uses his webs to seal cracks in the shipâ€™s hull and heat exhaust from the ship to survive in space, along with finding a way to stick to the surface of a jet in the middle of outer space. He also shows some skill at flying a spaceship and programming the autopilot to fly off to Iowa and lead Orchis on a wild goose chase. He even saves Wolverine&#39;s life at one point.






 Spider-Man Earns His Status as a Cosmic Hero 
          

As stated earlier, Spider-Man isn&#39;t viewed as much of a space hero as he is a street-level hero, but he&#39;s proven to be equally efficient in both realms. With all the intergalactic experience he&#39;s had at his disposal, he&#39;s an actual ace-level expert at this point. It shows that Spider-Man isn&#39;t just a street-level hero, but a well-rounded hero who can successfully adapt to any setting he&#39;s placed in.



Wolverine #40 is on sale now from Marvel.
