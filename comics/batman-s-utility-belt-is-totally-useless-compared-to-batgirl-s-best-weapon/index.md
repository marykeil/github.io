# Batman s Utility Belt Is Totally Useless Compared to Batgirl s Best Weapon


## SUMMARY 



  Batgirl&#39;s boots are her best weapon, as they can&#39;t be easily stolen.   Losing her utility belt doesn&#39;t make Batgirl less dangerous; in fact, she becomes even more powerful without it.   Batgirl is better at thinking on her feet and is more agile than Batman, making her a formidable opponent.

## Literature Review

Batgirl literally puts her foot down when her utility belt is snatched, forcing her to reveal the one weapon greater than anything in Batmanâ€™s belt.




Warning! Spoilers ahead for Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham #1!Sorry Batman, but Batgirl has one weapon that makes any tool in the Dark Knight&#39;s utility belt look pretty lame by comparison. The world is being inundated with animal hybrids during &#34;Beast World&#34; and Gotham City is no exception. But one Batgirl has things handled with an asset that won&#39;t fit in any utility belt.




In Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham #1&#39;s story &#34;Wild Thing&#34; by Kyle Starks and Kelley Jones, Batgirl Stephanie Brown responds to a distress call at a food bank. Thanks to Beast Boy, people all over the world have turned into animal creatures, including Killer Moth, who Stephanie discovers has transformed into a giant cockroach.

          

Despite his insect form, Killer Moth manages to steal Batgirl&#39;s utility belt. Fortunately, Steph still has the only weapon she really needs: Her boots. The battle between the two isn&#39;t seen, but the green goo all over Batgirl&#39;s shoes reveals her success in beating the transformed Killer Moth.


 Batgirl&#39;s Boots are Her Best Weapon 


          




The DC Universe has quickly spiraled out of control ever since an alien known as the Necrostar attacked Earth. Knowing that only a being like Starro the Conqueror could repel the invader, Beast Boy volunteered to transform into a similar creature. His plan was a success and he managed to stop the Necrostar&#39;s attack. Unfortunately, Amanda Waller took advantage of the situation and sent her newest asset Doctor Hate to mind-wipe Beast Boy. Without his personality, the transformed Gar began attacking Earth and sent out spores that turned people into animal hybrids. Worse, they seek out power, putting DC&#39;s strongest heroes like Superman at major risk.

Fans don&#39;t need to be told twice about the numerous weapons kept in Batman&#39;s utility belt. But as this battle clearly shows, it&#39;s not hard to plunder a Bat-Family member&#39;s belt and rob them of the many gadgets and gizmos they keep stored. Batgirl was at a major disadvantage, but the one thing she had that wasn&#39;t so easily snatched was her boots. They&#39;re not as easy to steal, and if Steph is as prepared as the rest of her Bat-Family brethren, then that footwear is no doubt ready for heavy-duty combat. Sure, Batgirl&#39;s boots can&#39;t pick locks or repel sharks, but they&#39;re great for one thing: kicking bad guy ass.






 Batgirl is Even More Dangerous Without Her Utility Belt 
          

Bat-Family members have to be prepared for anything in the field, including losing access to the weaponry they may be carrying. While there&#39;s always a chance Batgirl could lose her utility belt, it&#39;s much less likely she&#39;d have her boots stolen. Which is good because, as the transformed Killer Moth found out, Steph&#39;s boots aren&#39;t just made for walking, but for delivering some truly powerful kicks. Granted, the same could be said for other members of the Bat-Family. But when cornered, Batgirl is much better thinking on her feet than Batman is.

Titans: Beast World Tour: Gotham #1 is on sale now from DC Comics.
