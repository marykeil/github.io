# Star Wars Already Introduced Kenobis Perfect Season 2 Villain (Not Darth Maul)


## SUMMARY 



  Despite being advertised as a limited series, there is still a very real possibility of another season of Obi-Wan Kenobi.   The first season of Obi-Wan Kenobi had a definitive ending, but there is still another adventure Kenobi could embark on before the events of Episode IV: fighting Darth Krayt.   Obi-Wan Kenobi Season 2 could bridge the gap between Star Wars&#39; past and future, with an epic season-long arc introducing Darth Krayt as a future villain and establishing personal stakes for Kenobi.

## Literature Review

No one knows if there will even be a season 2 of Obi-Wan Kenobi, but if there is, Star Wars already has its perfect villain (&amp; it&#39;s not Darth Maul). 




At the moment, it’s entirely up in the air if Disney will greenlight another season of the live-action Star Wars series Obi-Wan Kenobi. It’s advertised as a limited series, but cast members and crew have been teasing the possibility of another season of Obi-Wan Kenobi since the first one dropped, so at this point it’s really anyone’s guess. However, if another season is on the horizon, it wouldn’t be difficult to bring to life, as Star Wars has already introduced the perfect season 2 villain - and no, it’s not Darth Maul.




Obi-Wan Kenobi was filled with solemn introspection, fun action/adventure, and more than a few truly epic lightsaber duels, meaning the desire to make a second season should be obvious. However, there is one thing that could keep that from happening: season 1 had a definitive ending. Darth Vader dropped his obsession with Kenobi, Obi-Wan starts his training on how to become the Force Ghost fans see him as in the original trilogy, and Luke and Leia are safe in their respective homes until the fateful events of Episode IV.

          

Everything wraps up quite nicely, and the stage is set for the original trilogy to play out as it should. At least, presumably, as there’s still at least one more adventure Kenobi could be called to before the events of Episode IV, one that could also be an amazing way to set up a future antagonist in later Star Wars installments: his conflict with Darth Krayt.

 Obi-Wan Kenobi Should Fight Darth Krayt In Season 2, Just Like In Star Wars: Legacy 
Star Wars: Legacy #16 by John Ostrander and Jan Duursema
         

This issue of Star Wars: Legacy revealed Darth Krayt’s entire backstory, including a conflict he had with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Tatooine following Order 66. Before Darth Krayt fell to the Sith, he was a Jedi named A’Sharad Hett, a native to Tatooine who returned to his homeworld after the fall of the Jedi Order. Upon his return, Hett became the leader of a tribe of Tuskens, traveling the planet and raiding moisture farms wherever they found them in the name of taking Tatooine back from ‘foreign invaders’.




A’Sharad unwittingly came across the Lars family farm where he and his raiders planned to claim it just as they had so many others before them. Only this house was under the protection of Obi-Wan Kenobi, who defeated Hett in combat, making him unfit to lead the Tuskens any longer. Hett was forced to leave Tatooine in shame, at which point he founded the One Sith and rose to prominence nearly 150 years later during the Legacy era.



 Obi-Wan Kenobi Season 2 Could Be The Perfect Bridge Between Star Wars’ Past &amp; Future 
          

While this storyline only lasted an issue, it has every element to be an epic season-long arc filled with unexpected twists, exciting visuals, and an all-new link between Star Wars’ past and future. The season could start with Obi-Wan becoming aware of a lightsaber-wielding Tusken leading a new tribe of raiders, and taking it upon himself to investigate. Then, the threat to Luke’s life would become clear, and Kenobi would have to jump into action. After their battle, the truth about this lightsaber-wielding Tusken would be revealed, establishing personal stakes for Kenobi in this conflict with a fellow former Jedi beyond just protecting Luke, while also setting up Darth Krayt as a future villain whenever Star Wars wants to bring him in.




The greatest hurdle Star Wars would have to overcome for Obi-Wan Kenobi season 2 is a villain who’s both worthy of Obi-Wan’s time and who isn’t Darth Vader or Darth Maul - as Star Wars: Rebels already gave Darth Maul the perfect ending. Having Obi-Wan battle Darth Krayt before he’s even introduced as Darth Krayt would fix both of those issues while also creating an exciting villain for future installments. And the kicker? Star Wars already introduced this perfect villain for Obi-Wan Kenobi season 2 within the pages of the Legacy comic series, making this storyline perfect for a live-action adaptation.
