## Literature Review

The fate of Damian Wayne is uncertain as DC teases that an unexpected villain may be the next Gotham Rogue to join the infamous &#39;Killed a Robin&#39; club.




The fate of Damian Wayne takes a chilling turn in a DC revelation, where a provocative variant cover hints at the elusive Man-Bat joining the ranks of villains who have successfully killed a Robin. This is particularly noteworthy given that Kirk Langstrom, the scientist-turned-creature, typically resides outside the realm of A-List villains, with only the most formidable foes having managed to secure a spot in the &#34;Killed a Robin&#34; club.




Kael Ngu&#39;s stunning variant cover for Batman and Robin #7, by Joshua Williamson and Simone Di Meo, hints at the impending doom of Batman&#39;s fifth Robin. The vivid imagery captures a heart-stopping moment, portraying Man-Bat releasing Robin from an unthinkable height above the city&#39;s skyline.

 Batman and Robin #7 (2024)                 Release Date:  March 12, 2024    Writers:  Joshua Williamson    Artists:  Simone Di Meo    Cover Artist:  Simone Di Meo    Variant Covers:  Derrick Chew, Simone Bianchi &amp; Kael Ngu   FLATLINE RETURNS! Batman and Robin are on the hunt for Man-Bat and Shush, but their search is interrupted by the return of Flatline, Damian&#39;s crush from the Lazarus Tournament! But what has followed her to Gotham?!   



In this scene, Damian appears to be in a state of free-fall, devoid of Batman&#39;s presence. The absence of The Dark Knight intensifies the gravity of the situation, painting a bleak picture for the young hero. With the release of this 32-page comic scheduled for March 12, 2024, fans are poised on the edge of their seats, eagerly anticipating the unraveling of Robin&#39;s fate.





 DC Teases Killing Damian Wayne Off in Official Variant Cover Art 


          

​As the anticipation builds for the forthcoming Batman and Robin issue, the comic&#39;s synopsis, courtesy of League of Comic Geeks, unfolds a riveting narrative. Batman and Robin, hot on the trail of Man-Bat and Shush, encounter an unexpected twist as Flatline, Damian&#39;s past love interest from the Lazarus Tournament, resurfaces. The synopsis also hints at an ominous presence trailing Flatline to Gotham, heightening the stakes for this particular comic installment. The inclusion of Man-Bat in the synopsis aligns seamlessly with the variant cover&#39;s suggestion of Robin&#39;s potential demise, fueling speculation that the narrative might indeed take a dark turn for the Boy Wonder.

Having previously been killed at the hands of the Heretic, an adult clone of Damian, in Batman Incorporated #8–by Grant Morrison, Chris Burnham, and Jason Masters–Damian is no stranger to death. But despite his enduring resilience, the variant cover for Batman and Robin #7 hints at the possibility of history repeating itself, presenting a narrative challenge for Williamson to strike a delicate balance between engaging storytelling and avoiding repetition. However, if Damian manages to survive the apparent fall, delving into the aftermath with a focus on extensive recovery and physical therapy could provide a fresh and compelling narrative that avoids the already-told story of Robin&#39;s death and resurrection. 






 Robin’s Death Would Elevate Man-Bat to an A-List Villain 
          

The potential demise of Robin, while risking the pitfall of a somewhat overused narrative, holds significant consequences for Man-Bat&#39;s standing as a villain. If Man-Bat were to successfully eliminate Batman&#39;s highly trained sidekick, it would undoubtedly propel him into the echelons of A-List villains, reshaping his status within Gotham&#39;s rogues&#39; gallery. Achieving such a feat would align Man-Bat with infamous villains like the Joker, who notoriously killed Jason Todd, Talia al Ghul, responsible for Damian&#39;s demise through Heretic, and even Lex Luthor, orchestrator of Dick Grayson&#39;s death before his resurrection. Hence, the notion of Man-Bat joining this notorious league of Robin-slayers adds an unprecedented layer of anticipation for fans.




Batman and Robin #7 will be available from DC Comics on March 12, 2024.
