The film is part of a planned trilogy that aims to continue the success of the original post-apocalyptic movie. 28 Days Later is credited with revitalizing the zombie genre and influencing subsequent zombie movies and TV shows. A 28 Days Later sequel, titled 28 Years Later, is in development from the original writer and director with a new trilogy planned. The 2002 modern horror classic, written by Alex Garland and directed by Danny Boyle, starred Cillian Murphy as a man who wakes up from a month-long coma to find that society has collapsed and London is overrun by humans infected with the “rage virus.” The film was followed by a sequel, 28 Weeks Later, released in 2007, though Boyle and Garland were involved only as executive producers. Now, two decades later, a new sequel is officially in development from the original writer and director. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Danny Boyle and Alex Garland are joining forces again for 28 Years Later with the hopes of launching a new trilogy. Boyle is set to helm the first initial installment, with Garland penning all three, and the budget for each film around $75 million. For now, 28 Years Later isn’t yet attached to a studio or streamer, though it’s expected to hit the market this week.

Perhaps more significantly, *28 Days Later* is widely credited with revitalizing the zombie genre and influencing the next decade of zombie movies and TV shows, despite Boyle not considering it a zombie movie. Because of 28 Days Later, zombies were no longer depicted as slow and lethargic, but fast and ferocious, and there was also an increased focus on character-driven drama. 28 Days Later’s influence can be seen in World War Z, Zombieland, The Walking Dead, and Zack Snyder’s Dawn of the Dead and Army of the Dead. 28 Days Later, equal parts post-apocalyptic horror and sharp political allegory, focused on the nature of pandemics and the fragile structure of society, subjects that struck a chord in 2002 so soon after 9/11. Now, two decades later, the nature of pandemics has never been more relevant due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which inspired many to recently revisit the film. With the sequel plans now in place, it remains to be seen how Garland and 28 Years Later with sharp political allegory and perhaps define another decade of zombie media.

The names of the characters in The Hunger Games reflect the series’ commentary on social concepts and draw inspiration from the Roman Empire. The intricate choice of names in The Hunger Games adds layers of depth and meaning to the characters and their stories. Many of the characters of the Hunger Games franchise have unique names, and the meanings behind them serve to foreshadow their roles in the story. As a series set in the future, it makes sense that most of the names within The Hunger Games or The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes would be unfamiliar to modern audiences. Some are inventions of author Suzanne Collins, while others came from notable Greek and Roman figures of history. Regardless, it seems that Collins took great care in choosing her characters’ names, building in layers of symbolism and connections to their roles or eventual fates. The Hunger Games draws significant inspiration from the Roman Empire, specifically the gladiatorial games. While exploring the totalitarian government of Panem and the brutal Hunger Games themselves, the series creates an impactful commentary on a variety of social concepts. This is driven home, in part, by the characters’ prophetic names. Collins is far from the first author to consider her character’s futures when naming them—it’s a common literary practice going even further back than Shakespeare. However, the prophetic names in The Hunger Games were artfully subtle, adding even more flavor to the stories within.

External factors, such as the pandemic and the upcoming DCU reboot, have affected overall box office performance. The DCEU’s sequel numbers are not as bad as they appear, considering the circumstances surrounding their releases. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom’s low box office performance completes a shocking trend for the DCEU as a whole. As the final film in the interconnected universe before the DCU reboot coming from James Gunn and Peter Safran, Aquaman 2 sees Jason Momoa returning as Arthur Curry’s Aquaman who reunites with his half-brother to prevent a global meltdown, a followup to the first Aquaman which made over a billion dollars back in 2018. However, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has ended up following an unfortunate trend when it comes to all of the DCEU’s sequels. From 2013’s Man of Steel to 2023’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the entire DCEU consists of 15 films within its established continuity. Of those 15, four were produced as direct sequels. While the hope with sequels is always to get a similar level of return and financial success, this was not the case, Likewise, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom continues the unfortunate trend where every direct DCEU sequel made less than the movie that came before it. However, there are some notable external factors explaining why that is.
