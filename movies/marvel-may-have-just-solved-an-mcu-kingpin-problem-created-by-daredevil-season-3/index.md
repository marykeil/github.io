Marvel may have just solved a key problem for Kingpin in the MCU created by Daredevil season 3. Thanks to Marvel&#39;s new Echo series, a dynamic and very exciting future has been set up for Wilson Fisk. However, Kingpin&#39;s ultimate confrontation with Maya Lopez (Alqua Cox) may have taken care of one of the biggest obstacles regarding said future.

Wilson Fisk (Vincent D&#39;onofrio) makes a major return in Marvel&#39;s Echo, much to the surprise of Maya Lopez who shot Kingpin at the end of Hawkeye. Regardless, Kinpin still cares for Maya who had long seen him as an uncle before she learned the truth about Fisk having her father killed. Offering her own criminal empire, Maya chooses instead to embrace the legacy and power of her Choctaw ancestors. This leads to an attempt by Maya to heal Fisk from his suffering and darkness just as she was, an act that may have some exciting implications for Kingpin&#39;s MCU future.

  2:23                       All Marvel Movies Releasing In 2024   The Marvel movies releasing in 2024 offer a range of film experiences - and some confusion, due to the changed dates of several incoming installments.   





 MCU Theory: Echo Erased Kingpin&#39;s Memories (Including Daredevil&#39;s Secret Identity) 
She Was Trying To Heal Fisk&#39;s Past Pain and Rage
         

Placing her hands on Fisk as they glowed with her new ancestral energy, Maya sought to heal Kingpin from his own dark past. This is evidenced by the various flashbacks to Fisk&#39;s past that were first seen in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil season 3. This includes his traumatic childhood where he killed his abusive father with a hammer as well as the white wall he would stare at to calm himself when his father would beat his mother. As such, it&#39;s clear that Maya was trying to use her power to heal Fisk, wanting to help him move on from all of his pain and rage.

Inadvertently or not, it would certainly be interesting if Maya erased certain key memories from Fisk&#39;s mind. This would effectively allow Marvel Studios to pick and choose which parts of Fisk&#39;s past they actually want to use going forward. As such, the most compelling option for a potentially erased memory would be the knowledge of Daredevil&#39;s secret identity, something Fisk learned in Daredevil season 3. After all, Daredevil and Fisk&#39;s last known confrontation was certainly full of both pain and rage. After all, knowing that Daredevil is Matt Murdock right at the onset of the MCU&#39;s upcoming Daredevil: Born Again series could prove to be a more complicated narrative.






 What Did Echo Actually Do To Kingpin? 
Fisk Definitely Resisted Echo
          

Surprisingly, the specifics of what Maya actually managed to do Kingpin at the ending of Echo were not revealed. However, it&#39;s clear that she did do something. Once Fisk&#39;s flashbacks ended, Kingpin was left confused and shaken as he demanded to know what Maya had done to him. He was clearly trying to resist Maya&#39;s efforts, so it&#39;s unclear if Echo was entirely successful. However, Kingpin was so rattled to the point where his men had to escort him away from the Choctaw powwow in Echo&#39;s finale. As such, it certainly seems as though not even Fisk himself knows what was done.

It follows that the effects of Echo&#39;s healing could be saved as a big reveal in Daredevil: Born Again which will presumably be Kingpin&#39;s next appearance in the MCU. Being made to forget that Matt Murdock is Daredevil against his will would certainly be a huge game-changer, while also having a comics precedent as well. On the page, Fisk and the rest of the world was made to forget Daredevi&#39;s identity after it had been publicly revealed, though Fisk found a way to regain the truth he had lost (and it just so happened during his time as New York&#39;s mayor).




                  How To Watch the Marvel Movies In Order (By Release Date &amp; In Order Of MCU Timeline Events)   Want to catch up before the next release, or just revisit the universe for a refresher? Here&#39;s the order to watch the entire MCU timeline.   



 Unanswered Questions Daredevil: Born Again Needs To Answer About Kingpin 
Where Does Kingpin Go From Here?
          

With Echo&#39;s post-credits scene teasing that Fisk will similarly run for mayor in the MCU, there are plenty of questions that need to be asked. Does Fisk even have the ability to run following his prior convictions and jail time seen in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil? How did he even get out of prison in the first place before Hawkeye?

Is the entirety of the Netflix&#39;s shows and Kingpin&#39;s past with Daredevil canon with the MCU, or just the parts that have been seen on-screen like Fisk&#39;s troubled childhood? How did Maya&#39;s power change Fisk, and has he forgotten elements of his painful past as suggested above like learning Murdock&#39;s alter ego in Daredevil season 3? There are plenty of mysteries regarding Kingpin and his new MCU future, and it will be quite exciting to hopefully get the answers with his next appearance.






All episodes of Marvel&#39;s Echo are streaming now on Disney&#43; and Hulu.
