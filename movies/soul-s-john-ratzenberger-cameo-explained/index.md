## Literature Review

John Ratzenberger has been in every Pixar movie, but he is not credited in Soul and his part is not immediately apparent. So who could he be playing?




Soul made its Disney&#43; debut on Christmas Day of 2020, and on first viewing, it seemed as though seasoned Pixar voice actor John Ratzenberger didn&#39;t have a part in the film - but he does. Many voices in Soul are easily recognizable, but it&#39;s somewhat difficult to make out Ratzenberger&#39;s signature gruffness anywhere. After several fans commented on not being able to discern his voice, director Pete Docter confirmed in an interview with CinemaBlend that Ratzenberger does indeed make a very brief appearance in Soul, but declined to give specific details.




While older generations remember John Ratzenberger as Cliff the mailman on the television classic Cheers, younger generations may know him best from his roles - both major and minor - in 22 Pixar films. He&#39;s been lending his voice to the studio since 1995&#39;s Toy Story, in which he played Hamm the piggy bank. Since then, he&#39;s played a ringmaster flea in A Bug&#39;s Life, John in Wall-E, Yeti in the Monsters, Inc. movies, and construction worker Fenwick in Onward, among others. That&#39;s why viewers were concerned when Ratzenberger was seemingly absent from Pixar&#39;s latest feature.


 One Of The Characters In Soul Looks Like John Ratzenberger 


 
Instead of having the prototypical John Ratzenberger cameo, Soul changed up how Pixar utilized the actor. This is because Soul has a character that looks like John Ratzenberger​​​​​​. The character can be seen wearing a tie in one of Soul&#39;s scenes in a New York subway station. According to Pixar Post, co-writer and co-director of Soul, Kemp Powers, has confirmed that it was indeed supposed to be Ratzenberger. However, he did not confirm that Ratzenberger provided an uncredited voice cameo for the character.




Initially, there was speculation that a New Yorker who shouts at Joe sounded like Ratzenberger and that this was his secret uncredited cameo. The blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it scene in Soul occurs when Joe bumps into a fellow passenger on the subway and would be his smallest part yet in a Pixar movie. However, it has never been confirmed that this is Ratzenberger&#39;s voice, meaning it might just be a coincidence that this annoyed New Yorker sounds familiar.



 Soul&#39;s John Ratzenberger Cameo Broke A 22 Movie Pixar Tradition 
          

Before Soul, Ratzenberger had a confirmed voice cameo in 22 Pixar movies straight, making it one of Pixar&#39;s most exciting Easter eggs. The last movie that featured Ratzenberger&#39;s voice was 2020&#39;s Onward, where he played a construction worker. Since then, Ratzenberger has not been confirmed to have had a voice cameo in Luca, Turning Red, Lightyear, and Elemental. It was never confirmed why this cameo streak happened, but there is speculation that it was because of corporate shake-ups at Pixar. At this point, it seems that Toy Story 5 is the best chance to restore the tradition, as Ratzenberger could reprise his role as Hamm.
