## Literature Review

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is making some big changes to the franchise, meaning that it can finally expand beyond the original setting.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has an exciting new possibility, as the story of the film means that it can finally live up to the franchise&#39;s title. The modern Planet of the Apes series has explored the lore of the franchise in a much grander way than ever before, expanding the story of the ape uprising and how they have reconstructed society. However, the Planet of the Apes franchise has still managed to fail to live up to its title until now, but Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes can fix this grave error by showing the ape world on a much bigger scale than previously.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the highly-anticipated upcoming fourth film in the modern Planet of the Apes franchise, building off the back of Matt Reeves&#39; beloved trilogy. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will be a step forward from the series, moving away from the story of Caesar and the initial years of the ape uprising and jumping forward to follow the story of new characters centuries after War for the Planet of the Apes. There is still a lot of mystery surrounding the story and setting of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, but it is known that the film can progress the franchise significantly.

 Planet Of The Apes&#39; New Trilogy Needs To Expand The Story Beyond America 
         




One of the most important things that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes needs to do is to expand the story beyond America. Matt Reeves&#39; Planet of the Apes trilogy explores the downfall of human civilization worldwide, with the Simian Flu wiping out humans and turning them into feral beasts across every continent. Since the Planet of the Apes trilogy focuses on Caesar, the events of the trilogy are almost entirely set in North America, meaning that the scale of the original trilogy is fairly small. While this works for Caesar&#39;s story, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes needs to shake things up a bit.



Expanding the Planet of the Apes story beyond America would be the perfect way to make the new trilogy that is starting with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stand out.




Matt Reeves&#39; Planet of the Apes trilogy fails to expand the franchise&#39;s story beyond America at all, leaving many viewers wondering how other countries and continents are dealing with the Simian Flu outbreak and the ape uprising. Luckily, expanding the Planet of the Apes story beyond America would be the perfect way to make the new trilogy that is starting with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes stand out. Despite the franchise&#39;s name, the trilogy never truly showed off the planet of the apes, an error that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes needs to fix.






 Planet Of The Apes&#39; Next Sequels Can Finally Show What Happened To The Rest Of Earth 
          

In order to truly live up to the franchise&#39;s name, the upcoming Planet of the Apes sequels can finally show what happened to the rest of Earth. There are a variety of ways in which this can be done, and all of them are interesting. For example, the upcoming trilogy could simply use flashback scenes to show how different countries responded to the outbreak, showing off scenes similar to the battle on the Golden Gate Bridge. It could also feature some remaining clusters of human civilization, although they would most likely have turned feral due to the effects of the Simian Flu.

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is set to show off some new ape civilizations, meaning that the Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes cast will most likely be traveling a lot on their journey. The film could see the gang go to different parts of the world and encounter local ape tribes, showing how the apes have adapted to various climates and locations. This would be an incredibly interesting way to explore the sociology and anthropology of the ape world, exploring how apes are similar and different when compared to modern human societies.

 Planet Of The Apes Expanding The Franchise Creates More Possibilities 
          

Using Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to expand the franchise creates even more possibilities than this, making the upcoming trilogy even more exciting. It could show how various landmarks and iconic cities have played into the development of ape societies, something that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes did with San Francisco. It could also possibly explore the attempts that clusters of humans have made to fight back, with the humans&#39; sci-fi technology allowing Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes to set up the story of the franchise&#39;s original films.




              Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes  Set several years after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the next installment in the Apes saga. Ape clans have taken up residence in the oasis that Caesar sought to colonize, but humans have reverted to their animalistic nature in their absence. Now battling between enslavement and freedom, outliers in the Ape clans will take sides in a newly burgeoning society.
