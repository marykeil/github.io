# 10 Marvel Characters Steven Yeun Can Play In The MCU After Exiting Thunderbolts

## Literature Review

Following Steven Yeun&#39;s exit from Thunderbolts, the actor wants to play another Marvel character, and the Sentry was not the only good one for him.




There are some interesting heroes and villains who Steven Yeun could play now that he will no longer be the face of Sentry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Thunderbolts. With filming for Marvel&#39;s Thunderbolts said to start in a couple of months, the news that Yeun had dropped out of playing Sentry in Thunderbolts was shocking. Yeun later explained his decision to leave the upcoming Marvel film, saying, &#34;I think for me, time passing and things shifting kind of pulled me out of it.&#34; While Yeun will no longer play Marvel&#39;s Superman, Sentry, the actor could still join the MCU in the future.
Yeun&#39;s exit from Thunderbolts seems to be unrelated to some fans&#39; fears that the project will not be one of the MCU&#39;s best movies but rather due to scheduling conflicts generated by the delays that were caused by the 2023 Hollywood strikes. Yeun could still have a future at Marvel, with the actor saying, &#34;I wanna do a Marvel movie,&#34; and, &#34;I have some ideas. But I heard if you put it out there, you’ll never get it, so I’ll keep it close to my chest.&#34; While Sentry should be recast for Thunderbolts, here are ten exciting Marvel characters who Yeun could portray in the MCU.

 10  Silver Surfer Could Give Steven Yeun A Cosmic Part 
Silver Surfer Might Debut In Fantastic Four
        

Galactus is rumored to be the main villain of Marvel&#39;s anticipated Fantastic Four movie reboot. Wherever the Devourer of Planets goes, his most famous herald should follow, with Silver Surfer being a great role for Yeun to play in the MCU. Silver Surfer might seem like a simple character at face value, but he holds a complexity that the Best Actor Oscar-nominated Yeun could easily bring to the big screen. Yeun could excel at bringing Silver Surfer&#39;s tragic backstory of sacrifice to life, making the character one to root for in the MCU.





 9  Steven Yeun Could Be A Devious Villain As Mister Sinister 
Mister Sinister Is Rumored To Be The Main Foe Of The MCU&#39;s X-Men
        

While Magneto was the main villain of Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise across two different timelines, a new rumor claims that Marvel is looking at a different foe from the comics to serve as the main antagonist of the MCU&#39;s X-Men. That villain is none other than Mister Sinister. The character is known to act in the shadows, pulling the strings behind several characters and events. Based on his role in Burning, Yeun has shown that he possesses the ability to play the nefarious charm and cunning of Mister Sinister to perfection.





 8  The MCU&#39;s Norman Osborn Could Give Steven Yeun An A-List Role 
Norman Osborn Would Make For A Compelling Addition To The Next Spider-Man Trilogy


 







Yeun has the star power and acting skills to take on some of Marvel&#39;s biggest characters, and one of them could be Norman Osborn. While Willem Dafoe recently returned as the Green Goblin in the MCU, Spider-Man: No Way Home&#39;s use of Osborn does not mean that the MCU will never debut its version of the villain. In fact, Marvel Studios is already playing with a different take on the character in the animated Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man series that debuts this year. Yeun could play either the villainous side of the character or stun audiences as the Iron Patriot version of Osborn in the next MCU Spider-Man trilogy.

 7  Steven Yeun Has What It Takes To Lead The X-Men As Cyclops 
Cyclops Should Be Front And Center in The MCU&#39;s X-Men Reboot


 







While James Marsden was perfect casting for Cyclops in Fox&#39;s X-Men movies, the character was never given the respect he deserved in the franchise — which his rumored role in Deadpool 3 will hopefully fix. The MCU will undoubtedly be looking at doing right by the X-Men&#39;s field leader from the comics, and Yeun could be the one to finally make Cyclops one of the biggest superhero names in live-action. In his later seasons as Glenn in The Walking Dead, Yeun showed the qualities of a veteran leader who would do his all to save others and conclude his mission, just like Cyclops would.

 6  Steven Yeun&#39;s Iron Fist Could Be Different From Danny Rand 
Iron Fist Could Show Up In Daredevil: Born Again Or Spider-Man 4
        

With the return of characters from Netflix&#39;s The Defenders Saga, such as Charlie Cox&#39;s Daredevil and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin, it is possible that the rest of the Defenders will follow. However, Finn Jones&#39; Iron Fist did not achieve the same success as his Netflix co-stars. Based on that, the MCU could replace Danny Rand entirely as its Iron Fist, which would somewhat continue from where his series left off while also allowing Marvel to feature a new Iron Fist among the rest of the Netflix cast. Yeun could play Marvel Comics&#39; new Iron Fist, Lin Lie, with his past charismatic roles showing how he would be perfect for the role.





 5  Doctor Doom Would Make Steven Yeun Marvel&#39;s Biggest Villain 
Doctor Doom Should At Least Cameo In Fantastic Four


 







Doctor Doom is one of the biggest roles an actor could ever play, and Yeun has the talent to do right by the villain. Reportedly, Marvel thought about replacing Kang the Conqueror with Doctor Doom when news about Jonathan Majors&#39; initial arrest broke. Now that the Kang actor has been fired, it is possible that Doom could take Kang&#39;s role as the main villain of the Multiverse Saga. Through his role in Jordan Peele&#39;s The Twilight Zone reboot, Yeun has shown that he can be incredibly frightening when he wants to. Mixing that ability with Yeun&#39;s usual charm would be perfect to deliver a nuanced Doctor Doom in the MCU.

 4  Nova Would Be Steven Yeun&#39;s Perfect Cosmic Hero 
A Nova Series Is Reportedly In Development
        

Richard Rider would be an entertaining role for Yeun. The actor&#39;s early days as Glenn in The Walking Dead have prepared Yeun to deliver a humorous performance as Nova, with Richard Rider being known in the comics to possess similar wise-cracking abilities as Spider-Man. While the character did get a little more serious as he became Nova and went on space adventures, Yeun&#39;s time in the zombie franchise also prepared him to play a confident and selfless hero such as Nova. With a Nova series reportedly in development, Yeun would better make his play for the character soon.





 3  Steven Yeun Could Fight Spider-Man As Mister Negative 
Mister Negative Could Play A Role In Spider-Man 4
        

Martin Li, aka Mister Negative, has gained new popularity after his role in the PlayStation Spider-Man game franchise. Spider-Man: No Way Home already introduced F.E.A.S.T., with Peter Parker&#39;s Aunt May working there and helping Dafoe&#39;s Norman Osborn at the location. In Spider-Man 4, Peter could decide to volunteer at F.E.A.S.T. to continue his aunt&#39;s work, and that could lead to Mister Negative, the community center&#39;s owner, playing a role in the MCU. Yeun could deliver the same nuanced performance as Li seen in the Spider-Man games, making the character more than a simple villain.





 2  Steven Yeun Would Be Perfect As New MCU Hulk Amadeus Cho 
The Rumored World War Hulk Movie Could Introduce Amadeus Cho
        

As a Korean-American actor, Yeun fits the bill to play the MCU&#39;s possible new Hulk, Amadeus Cho. What plays against Yeun getting to portray Amadeus is the fact that the character was introduced in Marvel Comics to be a young alternative to Bruce Banner, and at 40, Yeun is older than Marvel should go for with the character. Still, Yeun has the necessary charisma and acting ability to play the genius who is comfortable with his Hulk side from the get-go. With a rumored World War Hulk movie possibly on the horizon, the MCU could introduce several new Hulks, and Yeun as Amadeus Cho could be one of them.





 1  Steven Yeun&#39;s Beyonder Could Be Avengers: Secret Wars&#39; Main Villain 
The Beyonder Is Rumored As A Possible Kang The Conqueror Replacement
        

Finally, Yeun could leave his role as Sentry in Thunderbolts behind and join the MCU as one of Marvel Comics&#39; most powerful villains — The Beyonder. The character was directly responsible for the first version of the Secret Wars event from the comics, also playing an important role in the version that inspires 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars. The Beyonder is every bit as unpredictable as he is powerful, and Yeun&#39;s roles in Burning and Nope show that he could make the rumored secret villain of Avengers: Secret Wars a foe like no one else. In the end, whatever character Steven Yeun gets to play in the MCU, Marvel will be winning.
