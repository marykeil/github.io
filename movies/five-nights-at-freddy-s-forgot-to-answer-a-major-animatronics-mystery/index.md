# Five Nights At Freddy s Forgot To Answer A Major Animatronics Mystery


## SUMMARY 



  The fate of the animatronics from Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s remains unknown, as the movie never clarified what happened to the ghosts of the children trapped inside them.   The sequel to Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is likely to reveal the animatronics&#39; fates, with the possibility of them returning to seek vengeance on their creator.   Easter eggs in the movie suggest that the animatronics may return in a sequel that mirrors one of the game series&#39; sequels, possibly involving the character Vanessa and the concept of being inside an animatronic exoskeleton for protection.

## Literature Review

The ending of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s provided a satisfying wrap-up for some of its characters, but it left one major question unanswered.




Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s ended with a big reveal that answered a lot of questions raised by the mysterious and menacing denizens that dwelt in Freddy Fazbear&#39;s, but one of the biggest questions about the animatronics remained unanswered after the credits rolled. Based on the video game franchise of the same name, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s featured the familiar ghost-driven animatronic characters from the original game and its many sequels and spinoffs. While the movie showcased that the characters can sometimes be benevolent, the ending saw them return to their murderous ways before disappearing back into the restaurant.




Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s broke many box office records upon its release, so a sequel is all but inevitable, especially given how much source material there is to work with, and the built-in audience made up of those who love the original game series. The sequel will have to address the major mystery that remains after the original movie. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s will likely continue Mike&#39;s story in the sequel, but there are other characters whose fates remain unknown.

 : 1 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Character Fate Is The Key To Making A Great Spinoff


 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Ended Without Revealing What Happened To The Animatronics 
They were last seen dragging Yellow Rabbit back into the depths of the restaurant.


 
After Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s big villain twist was revealed, the haunted animatronics hauled their original tormentor, William Afton, into the depths of Freddy Fazbear&#39;s. The injuries that Afton sustained from the Yellow Rabbit costume were likely fatal, and if they weren&#39;t, it stands to reason that the animatronics driven by the ghosts of his child victims finished the job. However, the fate of the animatronics themselves was never addressed.




The animatronics were not necessarily trapped in the restaurant, as the movie (and games) show that the animatronics are capable of interacting with the outside world occasionally. The movie never clarifies what happened to the ghosts of the children inhabiting the animatronics, so theoretically they are still trapped in their respective characters until something releases them. Abby specifically mentions possibly returning to visit her friends (the animatronics), which is a good indication that they are in fact still in the restaurant, and will return in some capacity in the inevitable sequel.



 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Reveal The Animatronics&#39; Fates 
The franchise&#39;s most famous faces are sure to return.
         

Thanks to the many spinoffs and sequels of the game series, there are many different avenues for the franchise to take in its cinematic sequel. William Afton&#39;s iconic &#34;I always come back&#34; line indicates that, as he does in the video games, William Afton will return. Assuming that he does, the animatronics have a legitimate reason to make their own return. They can return to once again try to seek vengeance on their sick creator, or at least keep him from claiming any more victims.




Many of the Easter eggs included in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s also hint towards the animatronics returning in a sequel that might mirror one of the game series&#39; sequels. For example, the inclusion of Vanessa and the somewhat campy scene where Mike, Abby and Vanessa work with the animatronics to build a sleepover fort could point toward an adaptation of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Security Breach; it was the first game to introduce Vanessa and features the player actually getting inside one of the animatronics&#39; exoskeletons for protection. No matter what direction the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s sequel takes, it will surely address the fate of the animatronics from the 2023 smash hit.
