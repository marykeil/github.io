## Literature Review

A new print of Godzilla Minus One will soon hit theaters in the US, giving audiences an artistic retake of Toho&#39;s latest film on the kaiju monster.




A new version of Godzilla Minus One secures a release date in the United States. From Toho International, Godzilla Minus One is a Japanese rendition of the classic kaiju monster. Its plot focuses on the lives of those in post-war Japan, fighting for their lives as a monster, supercharged by the atomic bomb, emerges and wreaks havoc upon the country.




Now, Deadline announces an upcoming theatrical run for a version of Godzilla Minus One remastered in black-and-white. Coined Godzilla Minus One / Minus Color, the film will begin running in theaters on February 1. This version of the film was already released in Japan on January 12. Director Takashi Yamazaki spoke highly of this version, saying: 



“I was very happy that the North American audience embraced Godzilla Minus One. And now I am very pleased to be able to release a black-and-white version for North America as well. Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color will bring a new and visceral experience to audiences.”




 Godzilla Minus One/Minus Color Proves The Film’s Strength 
         

Godzilla Minus One received incredibly high critical praise upon its release. The film holds a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes, making it one of the highest-rated Godzilla films of all time. The film was praised for its strong characters and highly human quality within a story that also featured violence and cruelty through the kaiju monster itself. 




In addition to critical praise, Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office run was also impressive. The film has grossed over $95 million worldwide, with over $50 million of that coming from the North American box office. As Yamazaki notes, “the North American audience embraced Godzilla Minus One” to a surprising degree, making the film a massive success. 

Godzilla Minus One / Minus Color’s release will allow more audiences to be intrigued and experience the film. Furthermore, the special re-released print shows the artistry and intentionality present in this Godzilla film. Unlike a MonsterVerse effort, the point of Godzilla Minus One is not just guns and action, but rather an entire visual style that merits a black-and-white version. Hopefully, this version of Godzilla Minus One will see success as it is released in United States theaters on February 1.
