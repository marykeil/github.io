# Children Of The Corn Used 1 Trick To Make The Movie Even Scarier


## SUMMARY 


 

Children of the Corn used a clever trick by never showing actual violence on screen, relying on the viewer&#39;s imagination, which made the movie more frightening and helped with the budget.
            

This approach was later employed in Reservoir Dogs and Hostel, which limited violence to glimpses of aftermaths, making the gore feel horrific but surprisingly minimal upon a rewatch.


Despite its potentially silly story, Children of the Corn&#39;s stylistic choice of minimal onscreen bloodshed elevated the movie and made it even scarier than if it had shown explicit violence.
