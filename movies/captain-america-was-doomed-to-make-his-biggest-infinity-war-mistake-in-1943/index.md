# Captain America Was Doomed To Make His Biggest Infinity War Mistake In 1943


## SUMMARY 



  Captain America&#39;s willingness to save everyone led to blunders against Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War, reflecting the immense responsibility on his shoulders.   Captain America&#39;s decision to protect Vision instead of sacrificing him for the greater good was rooted in his morally righteous personality, but it ultimately had devastating consequences.   Iron Man&#39;s emphasis on the greater good and limiting collateral damage would have likely led him to make the decision to eliminate Vision early on, highlighting the difference in leadership styles between the two superheroes.

## Literature Review
Captain America faced a major moral dilemma in Avengers: Infinity War, a decision that can be traced back to his superhero origins. 




Captain America has been an effective leader in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but his willingness to save everyone arguably led to some blunders against fighting Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War. From fighting his best friend Bucky Barnes to waging a civil war against his fellow Avenger Iron Man, Steve Rogers has faced many difficult decisions in most of the early movies on the Marvel timeline. These mental dilemmas reflect the immense responsibility that rests on his shoulders, a far cry from his early years before World War II when he was being bullied in the streets of New York. But as evident from Captain America: The First Avengers, Rogers was always fearless and kind-hearted.




One of the many super soldiers created in the MCU, Rogers adopted the alias Captain America and led valiant war efforts against the Nazis in the 1940s. Wielding the vibranium shield yet again in the 21st century, Captain America has gone on to prove his heroic nature. This is evident from actions like his leadership over Wakandan forces in Avengers: Infinity War. Even if there was an easy way out to prevent Thanos’ ultimate goal of snapping half of the universe out of existence, Captain America relied on his protective instincts to save one specific Avenger. This decision, no matter how controversial it is, was rooted in his very nature.

 Captain America&#39;s Super Serum Led To Infinity War&#39;s Ending 
   Close     




Toward the ending of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos loses out on his chance to collect all Infinity Stones for his gauntlet as Scarlet Vision unwillingly kills Vision, the humanoid android with the Mind Stone embedded in its forehead. But using the Time Stone to reverse time, the mad Titan still gains the Mind Stone for himself, killing Vision for a second time. This situation could have easily been avoided if Captain America had been willing to slay Vision way before Thanos approached closer to Wakanda. But the first Avenger could never have let Vision die for the greater good because of his morally righteous personality.



In some Marvels Comics arcs, the Super Soldier Serum has been portrayed as a virus that can be transmitted rather than a traditional serum.




As seen in Captain America: The First Avenger, compassion and bravery were some of the most unmistakable Captain America traits in the MCU. Ever since he got injected with the super soldier serum, these personality traits have only been enhanced further. The serum doesn’t just accelerate a person’s physical attributes to peak performance, but also their mental ones. Hence, Captain America was always meant to be a natural leader after the serum, explaining why he was willing to protect every member of his team in Avengers: Infinity War. Bearing the brunt of Vision’s sacrifice would have been too much for him.






 Captain America Should Have Sacrificed Vision 
          

From a moral standpoint, Captain America did the right thing by refraining from killing Vision just to prevent Thanos from getting the Mind Stone. But from the perspective of the greater good, he should have eliminated Vision early on. Without Vision’s Mind Stone, Thanos wouldn’t have been able to eliminate millions in a second, and the mass destruction of the event known as “the Blip” could have been avoided. Considering that Iron Man is more tactical and less righteous than Captain America, he would probably have gone ahead with Scarlet Witch’s plan if he were the leader in Wakanda instead.

             Avengers: Infinity War Avengers: Infinity War is the third Avengers movie in the game-changing Marvel Cinematic Universe. This film is positioned as the beginning of the culmination of everything that has transpired in the franchise to date. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo, who previously helmed Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Civil War, have assembled the largest ensemble in a superhero film to date. Nearly every living character in the MCU is included as the Avengers join forces with the Guardians of the Galaxy to take down Thanos in a battle that has massive repercussions for the future of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. A sequel, Avengers: Endgame, was released in 2019 and marked the end of the Infinity Saga.  Release Date   April 27, 2018    Director   Joe Russo , Anthony Russo    Cast   Chris Hemsworth , Anthony Mackie , Elizabeth Olsen , Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlett Johansson , Mark Ruffalo , Sebastian Stan , Paul Rudd , Chadwick Boseman , Don Cheadle , Samuel L. Jackson , Josh Brolin , Tom Holland , Evangeline Lilly , Paul Bettany , Chris Evans , Jeremy Renner    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   149 minutes       




This doesn’t imply that Iron Man isn’t compassionate. After all, he sacrificed himself with a fatal snap in Avengers: Endgame. But before his demise, Iron Man was more susceptible to being thoughtful about the greater good. Without any serum enhancing his heroic qualities, he would have thought of doing the right thing even if it came at a moral cost. His emphasis on the greater good and limiting collateral damage is evident from his previous fights against his former superhero allies in Captain America: Civil War. As for Captain America in Avengers: Infinity War, he was always meant to protect Vision even if that went against the greater good.
