# 6 Reasons Avatar 3 Risks Breaking The Franchise s $2 Billion Box Office Streak


## SUMMARY 


 Avatar 3 may struggle to reach the $2 billion mark due to a downward trend in the franchise&#39;s popularity. 
 A shorter window between releases may not generate enough excitement or offer something significantly new or different. 
 While visually stunning, the movies&#39; spectacular CGI and the declining gimmick of 3D may not guarantee an audience.

## Literature Review

Avatar as a franchise saw a large decrease in the box office between the first and second film, but the third may see the figure drop further still.





Avatar 3 is due to be released in late 2025, but with the franchise already on a downward trend, Avatar 3 may struggle to cross the $2 billion threshold. The first film in the series was released in 2009, and thanks to the breakthroughs in 3D technology and CGI, it quickly grew to be the top grossing film of all time. When Avatar: The Way of Water was released in 2022, it also managed to earn well over $2 billion, but the movie still managed to see a massive drop, earning over $400 million less than the original during its first release (via Box Office Mojo).
There is no doubt that James Cameron continues to be the most bankable director in Hollywood, with three of the top grossing movies of all time having been directed by him, but Avatar&#39;s popularity appears to be in decline. Cameron will almost certainly be able to create a spectacular sequel, but to get audiences to go out and spend their hard-earned cash, he will need to continue to build the franchise up rather than rely on what came before. However, if the same trend continues for the sequels, then Avatar 3 may struggle to get over the $2 billion hurdle.









 








 6  Avatar 3 Doesn&#39;t Have 13 Years Of Anticipation Going In 
Meaning Much Less Excitement
        

Avatar was released in 2009, and due to its enormous success, a sequel was almost immediately announced. However, due to scheduling conflicts and several other delays, Avatar: The Way of Water was pushed back years until it was finally released in 2022, 13 years after the original movie. While releasing popular films close together can keep audiences&#39; attention, there are also benefits to having a long break between films, which sometimes works to build anticipation and excitement about an upcoming project. This gap also allowed the original movie to be re-released in theaters on several occasions, which ballooned the original earnings from $2.74 billion to $2.92 billion (via Box Office Mojo).
Having a shorter window between the releases could go either way in terms of whether audiences still have the story fresh enough in their minds three years later to get excited. If not enough time has passed to see what a new James Cameron Avatar movie will look like, it could see potential audiences choose another film over Avatar, or decide to stay home and stream something instead. Combine this with the fact that Avatar 3 was actually filmed alongside Avatar 2, and it could turn audiences off feeling like there won&#39;t be anything significantly new or different.
            
 
 Every Upcoming Avatar Movie (2025-2031) 
Here&#39;s everything currently known about the four Avatar sequels planned by James Cameron up until 2031, including plots, titles, and casting.








 5  The Story Is Already Getting Old 
After Just Two Lengthy Movies Over 13 Years
        

Pandora is a beautiful planet straight from Cameron&#39;s impressive imagination, but the story isn&#39;t anything new. When the first film was released, many viewers noticed that Avatar bore striking similarities to movies like Pocahontas, Dune, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Of course, most movies draw inspiration from other films, but Avatar&#39;s main draw is not the story, it&#39;s the visuals. With the first movie, the incredible landscape of Pandora was enough to pull in large audiences, and the second movie, moving to the underwater life on Pandora, helped entice some viewers back. Unless Avatar 3 has something drastically new, it&#39;s unlikely the story will attract such large numbers.





 4  Avatar Is Visually Stunning, But Is That Enough? 
CGI Only Takes A Movie So Far


 







There is no debating just how impressive the visuals in Avatar and its sequel are. Even the 2009 movie stands up to CGI from modern films and is incredibly impressive. Cameron has a keen eye and sensational talent for being able to create special effects that withstand the test of time, as can be seen in earlier projects like Terminator 2: Judgment Day. However, as impressive as the visuals may be on a stock display video in the electronics store, no one spends hours watching the video on repeat. Just because the movies are beautiful, that doesn&#39;t guarantee an audience.





 3  The Gimmick Of 3D Is Dead 
RIP 3D
        

When Avatar first came out in 2009, the use of 3D filming equipment was revolutionary at the time, but the trend didn&#39;t stick around for long. In the years following the film, 3D TV became an expensive gimmick with very little content using the technology to its full potential. Games and home releases were made with 3D editions, but as quickly as they came, it all disappeared. The use of 3D was integral in the first movie, and almost as a nod to the earlier film, Avatar: The Way of Water, was also released with the option to watch it in 3D, but it&#39;s now more of a nuisance than a novelty.





 2  The New Family Isn&#39;t Interesting Like Jake Sully 
Jake&#39;s Transformation Was Compelling
        

Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is the central protagonist in Avatar. An ex-marine who retired due to an injury that left him unable to use his legs. Jake was also an identical twin, whose brother was a scientist on the Avatar program before he tragically died. His matching DNA and previous experience working for a government body made him the perfect replacement candidate to fill in and operate the Na&#39;vi body created especially for his brothers&#39; genetic code. Sully is a complex character who finds himself divided between his roots, as a human marine, and his new life, which connects him to his brother and the wider family of the Na&#39;vi.

Avatar 3 could potentially match Avatar: The Way of Water&#39;s box office success, but various factors make this achievement relatively unlikely.



Jake has an instant connection with the Na&#39;vi people, their way of life, and their respect and honor for the dead. Through the course of the first movie, he falls in love with a Na&#39;vi woman, Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), turns his back on the corrupt military forces on Pandora led by Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), and permanently transfers his consciousness into his Na&#39;vi body to integrate with the tribe. The family in Avatar 2 just didn&#39;t stand out in the same way, and as the story transitions to focus on them, it may continue to become less interesting.





 1  The Arc Of Miles Quaritch Is Obvious 
Quaritch Will Have A Redemption Arc


 







Quaritch is the antagonist of the Avatar films. In Avatar, he is a ruthless Colonel who despises the natives of Pandora. Obsessed with completing his mission, even at the expense of countless lives, Quaritch leads a war effort against the natives and is killed in the process. In Avatar 2, Quaritch is essentially resurrected as his consciousness was implanted into a Na&#39;vi body. Quaritch has already started to show signs of a change of heart, and his arc will almost certainly see him turn from the villain to a sympathetic good guy in Avatar 3 and beyond, but this obvious plot isn&#39;t strong enough to take the sequels past $2 billion.
