## Literature Review

Mark Dacasco plays a very important role in John Wick 3, and the film includes an acknowledgment of the most iconic part of his career. 




John Wick 3 found an interesting and unique way to pay homage to Mark Dacasco&#39;s most iconic role of his career. The third movie in the popular franchise follows John Wick trying to navigate life without an international assassin&#39;s guild&#39;s protective services and with a $14 million bounty on his head. It is one of the most intriguing movies in the series and manages to incorporate all of the memorable elements of the first two films, while still presenting a fresh story.




Part of what makes the third movie such a standout within the John Wick timeline is Mark Dacasco&#39;s character. Action-packed movies work best when the characters are engaging and complex, which is exactly what Dacasco manages to deliver. Despite the fact that there have been many villains throughout the John Wick films, Dacasco&#39;s remains memorable. Not only is his ability to breathe life into such an important character a testament to his skill and accomplished career but so is the nod that John Wick 3 includes.


 Zero&#39;s Job In John Wick 3 References Mark Dacascos&#39; Iron Chef Role 
          

John Wick 3 does an excellent job of weaving in references to Mark Dacasco&#39;s most well-known role. Dacasco is famously known for being a part of Food Network&#39;s Iron Chef shows as &#34;the Chairman&#34;. This role had Dacasco MCing each Iron Chef contestant. Previously, this role was played by Takeshi Kaga in the original Japanese Iron Chef, and Dacasco&#39;s character is presented as his nephew (though the actors are not actually related).




John Wick nods to this by having Dacasco&#39;s character be in a similar position. He plays a man named Zero, who is the leader of a small group of assassins who are given the task of killing the infamous John Wick. In addition to being the leader of this group, it is revealed that Zero is also a very talented street-food sushi chef. He has the skills to even safely prepare poisonous blowfish for others to consume. This is a clear reference to Dacasco&#39;s history of being on cooking-related shows and a fun easter egg for viewers to pick up on.
