## Literature Review

Not all thriller books can seamlessly make the jump from page to screen, but some of the genre’s best stories are well suited to movie adaptations.




Thriller books have the ability to captivate readers from start to finish, and many popular offerings from the genre would have the same effect as movies. Films like Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train prove that thriller novels make compelling adaptations. And there are many more stories that could make the jump from page to screen, especially with the number of new thrillers hitting the market every year.
It&#39;s no surprise thriller books have become so popular, as they give readers an opportunity to escape into a story that&#39;s full of drama and suspense. Like good popcorn movies, thriller novels don&#39;t require much from the reader but still deliver entertaining narratives that keep them on edge throughout. Not every thriller book is ideal to be made into a movie, but there are some that would be incredible to see on the big screen.

From tales that venture into the unknown to familial dramas that unfold in the backdrop of grim secrets, many horror novels deserve movie adaptations.












 








 10  Wrong Place Wrong Time By Gillian McAllister 
This Book Would Make For A Fun, Genre-Bending Movie
        

Gillian McAllister&#39;s Wrong Place Wrong Time expertly blends a murder mystery with the concept of time travel, resulting in a thriller book like no other. The novel begins when Jen wakes up to witness her son committing a murder outside their house. She&#39;s then transported back in time repeatedly, forcing her to put together the pieces of what happened that night, as well as how she can prevent it. The time travel element of this novel would make for a compelling, genre-bending movie adaptation. Unlike many other time travel movies, Wrong Place Wrong Time&#39;s sci-fi elements aren&#39;t difficult to understand but still bring everything together believably.





 9  The It Girl By Ruth Ware 
Ware&#39;s Novel Has The Perfect Backdrop For A Film
        

Ruth Ware has a number of thriller novels ripe for adaptation, but The It Girl&#39;s atmospheric backdrop makes it an ideal story to bring to the big screen. Centered on a murder that happens while the main character is attending a prestigious college, The It Girl unravels everything leading up to April Clarke-Cliveden&#39;s death while also following her roommate, Hannah, years later. The college setting is the highlight of The It Girl, but its compelling cast of characters would also make for a fun cinematic romp. Although the pacing might need to be adjusted for a movie, The It Girl&#39;s dark academia vibes and complex characters would certainly land on-screen.





 8  Eight Perfect Murders By Peter Swanson 
A Unique Concept &amp; Eerie Killings Would Stand Out
        

Eight Perfect Murders isn&#39;t Peter Swanson&#39;s best-known thriller, but it&#39;s one of the author&#39;s books that would translate well on-screen. The novel follows bookseller and blogger Malcolm, who finds himself wrapped up in an FBI case after a killer begins copying his blog post of &#34;perfect murders&#34; in fiction. It&#39;s clear the culprit is trying to send Malcolm a message through each murder, and the mystery surrounding that is enthralling from start to finish. The crimes committed throughout Eight Perfect Murders are eerie enough that a movie adaptation would straddle the line between horror and thriller, and the unique concept would stand out in Hollywood.





 7  All The Sinners Bleed By S.A. Cosby 
A Movie Can Raise Necessary Discussions
        

Paramount is adapting S.A. Cosby&#39;s Razorblade Tears, but the author&#39;s 2023 release, All the Sinners Bleed, is an equally strong contender to become a movie. All the Sinners Bleed follows a Black sheriff dealing with a shooting, but the novel goes far beyond its mystery premise. Titus Crown is the first Black sheriff in his Virginia county, and his investigation forces him to grapple with the town&#39;s dark history and the racism that runs deep within its police force. A movie adaptation of All the Sinners Bleed can start important conversations about real-world problems, expanding the reach of Cosby&#39;s commentary beyond readers.





 6  The Only Survivors By Megan Miranda 
Miranda&#39;s Books Are Just Like Summer Blockbusters
        

Megan Miranda&#39;s thrillers are the equivalent of summer blockbusters, and a movie adaptation of 2023&#39;s The Only Survivors would prove their ability to fare just as well on-screen. The Only Survivors follows a group of friends who survived an accident when they were teens and are embarking on their annual trip to commemorate it. As they spend time in the Outer Banks, secrets are unearthed, leading to some shocking revelations. The twists present throughout The Only Survivors would land well on-screen, but the accident itself also makes this book more cinematic than Miranda&#39;s other works. Flashbacks would paint a truly immersive picture of what these characters did to survive.





 5  What Lies In The Woods By Kate Alice Marshall 
A Movie Adaptation Would Be Eerie &amp; Chilling
        

Clearly inspired by the Slender Man stabbing in 2014, What Lies in the Woods puts a fascinating spin on the true story and explores the whimsy and darkness of childhood. The book follows Naomi, who survived a stabbing as a child, though she doesn&#39;t remember the attack. She returns home after the man she sent to prison dies — and starts to question whether he was really responsible. As Naomi digs into her past, she realizes her small town is full of people with secrets and ulterior motives. The multiple twists would make What Lies in the Woods a thrilling screen adaptation, and its eerie childhood flashbacks would be chilling on-screen.





 4  The Overnight Guest By Heather Gudenkauf 
A Claustrophobic Snow Storm Makes Ideal For Adaptation
        

Another thriller novel with an atmospheric backdrop, Heather Gudenkauf&#39;s The Overnight Guest would make a perfect movie adaptation to snuggle up with in the dead of winter. The book follows two timelines: one that sees a writer receiving a surprising — and potentially deadly — visit while staying at a remote farmhouse in the midst of a snow storm. The earlier storyline chronicles a tragedy that unfolds around two young girls, with the book eventually bringing both narratives together. Each story has its strengths, and both timelines would hold viewers&#39; interest in a screen adaptation. The storm would also add an element of claustrophobia that&#39;s worked for other horror and thriller releases.





 3  The Writing Retreat By Julia Bartz 
The Perfect Setting For On-Screen Scares
        

The Writing Retreat is a suspenseful and fun — if outlandish — addition to the thriller genre, and a movie adaptation would be just as entertaining. Julia Bartz&#39;s book follows five writers who have won the opportunity to attend a writer&#39;s retreat at famous author Roza Vallo&#39;s estate. The estate itself presents plenty of opportunities for a film to shine, as the setting infuses a bit of horror into Bartz&#39;s story. With a tragic history and the possibility of ghosts, the setting will leave viewers just as scared as the characters once people start disappearing. The exploration of toxic friendships, secrets, and ambition also elevate this story, making it ripe for adaptation.





 2  When No One Is Watching By Alyssa Cole 
A Thriller That Tackles Gentrification
        

​​​​​​​Alyssa Cole&#39;s When No One Is Watching tackles the topic of gentrification through its thriller premise, and a movie adaptation could make for a compelling narrative that raises awareness about a real-life issue. When No One Is Watching follows Sydney, who lives in a Brooklyn neighborhood that sees people constantly coming and going. However, when Sydney and her neighbor Theo begin looking more deeply into the area&#39;s history, they start to question whether the people leaving are doing so of their own volition. There might be more going on behind the scenes, leading to a sense of fear that&#39;s different from most other thriller novels.





 1  The Family Upstairs By Lisa Jewell 
A Wild Ride With Sequel Potential
        

Lisa Jewell is an iconic thriller author, and The Family Upstairs is often regarded as one of her best works. The Family Upstairs opens with Libby Jones receiving word that she&#39;s inherited her birth parents&#39; home, and the narrative goes off the rails from there. The Family Upstairs is a wild ride best entered with no information, and a movie would undoubtedly grip viewers from start to finish. There&#39;s also a sequel, so a film that does well could spawn a series based on Jewell&#39;s best-selling hit.
