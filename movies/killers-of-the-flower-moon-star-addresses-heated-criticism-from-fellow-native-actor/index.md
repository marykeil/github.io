## Literature Review

Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s Lily Gladstone addresses Reservation Dogs star Devery Jacobs&#39; biting criticism of the Martin Scorsese movie.




Killers of the Flower Moon’s Lily Gladstone reacts to Devery Jacobs’ criticism of the movie. Gladstone plays Mollie Burkhart in the Martin Scorsese adaptation of the non-fiction novel, the female lead who is the Osage country tribe member who marries Leonardo DiCaprio’s Ernest Burkhart in the story. Jacobs is a fellow Native American actor, who is best known for her work playing Elora in the acclaimed show Reservation Dogs, as well as recently starring in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Echo.




Speaking with Rolling Stone, Gladstone responds to the heated criticism from Jacobs surrounding Killers of the Flower Moon. Gladstone maintained that she and Jacobs are “friends” and “her reaction is hers,” thus she did not want to “bring heat back on her” for anything that Jacobs had said. Gladstone did maintain though that “Ultimately, Osage reaction is what [she] care[s] about the most.” Check out the full quote from Gladstone below:


We’re friends. I crashed on her couch in Toronto when ‘Certain Women’ played at TIFF. I don’t want to bring heat back on her for this because I think that’s unfair. Her reaction is hers. Her reaction is a response to a lot of trauma that, particularly, Native women feel seeing these things for the first time. I had a lot of time acclimating myself to the script. The Osage people have had their lives to understand this history. The process of making this movie gave a lot of people a chance to speak. Ultimately, Osage reaction is what I care about the most.






 Devery Jacobs’ Killers of the Flower Moon Criticism Explained 
          

Gladstone’s commentary comes months after Jacobs first came out with her biting criticism of Killers of the Flower Moon. Shortly after it was released, Jacobs took to social media to deliver a long rant against the Martin Scorsese movie, wherein she referred to the drama as “unrelenting and unnecessarily graphic.” More specifically, she wrote that she “believe[s] that by showing more murdered Native women on screen, it normalizes the violence committed against us and further dehumanizes our people.” Within her complaints about the movie, Jacobs still praised Gladstone’s performance, calling her “an absolute legend.”

Gladstone is not unaware of the kind of trauma that Killers of the Flower Moon can cause. Back in November, Gladstone urged Native women and youth to “See it when and only if [they] feel ready.” Alongside this message of caution and support regarding the film, Gladstone shared a number of mental health and other support resources targeted towards Native people, and especially towards women.




                  Killers Of The Flower Moon’s Title &amp; Osage Meaning Explained   Martin Scorcese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon has an enigmatic title. Here&#39;s what it means to the Osage Nation and to the historical drama&#39;s plot.   

The actor is equally as respectful in her most recent response, where she acknowledges the genuine “trauma” that seeing Killers of the Flower Moon can cause people. Gladstone and Jacobs’ disparate reactions show just how complicated the ethics of the movie are. On the one hand, there was consultation from the Osage tribe while making Killers of the Flower Moon, and many of its members support it, and on the other hand, Native women like Jacobs may feel retraumatized by the way Scorsese portrays the horrors. There is no right way for people, especially Native actors, to respond to such a heavy and complex film, and it is good that Gladstone leaves room for this discourse.
