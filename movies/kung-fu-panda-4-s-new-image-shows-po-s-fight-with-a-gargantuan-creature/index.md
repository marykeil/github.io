Summary

  A new Kung Fu Panda 4 features a fight between Po and a giant creature.   The film boasts an impressive voice cast including Jack Black, Awkwafina, Bryan Cranston, and Viola Davis.   Kung Fu Panda 4 will see Po searching for his replacement as the Dragon Warrior.  





A new image for Kung Fu Panda 4 shows a fight between Po and a new giant creature. The long-awaited sequel stars a stellar voice cast of Jack Black, Awkwafina, Ke Huy Quan, Bryan Cranston, Viola Davis, Ian McShane, Dustin Hoffman, and James Hong.




Now, Total Film reveals an exclusive new image for the upcoming Kung Fu Panda 4.




The image shows panda protagonist Po in action as he faces up against a new challenger. Said rival is an enormous being that appears to be some manta ray-like sea creature.

 Kung Fu Panda 4’s Cast of Characters Will Make for an Epic Adventure 
          

As Kung Fu Panda 4 sees Po become the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace, the film brings back the characters from the original trilogy while also introducing new characters. New cast introductions include Awkwafina, Davis, and Quan, all of whom were confirmed to be joining the cast late last year. This huge cast will allow the film to develop Po’s journey while still working within the framework of the characters that audiences have grown to love.




The Kung Fu Panda 4 trailer included a big surprise: the return of Tai Lung. Tai Lung was Po’s original villain in Kung Fu Panda who was presumed to be dead after Po defeated him. Through the film’s expansion to the spirit realm, however, Kung Fu Panda can bring back Tai Lung alongside Po’s other former antagonists.

By reuniting Po with his former rivals, Kung Fu Panda 4 sets up a bold premise that will undoubtedly lead to some impressive adventures. If the newest image from the film is any indication, these adventures will culminate in some interesting battles as Po trains to become the next Spiritual Leader. Hopefully, Kung Fu Panda 4 can live up to the promising early predictions as it prepares for release in March.
