## Literature Review

Netflix is gearing up for another year of great original movies in 2024, including Damsel, Good Grief, Lift, Orion and the Dark, and The Old Guard 2.




Netflix is bringing subscribers another year of great original movies in 2024. Movies including Maestro, Nimona, and May December were among the best Netflix movies of 2023. This year, the streaming giant will once again deliver in a variety of genres and mediums.
New movies from A-list actors and directors, directorial debuts, legacy sequels, and adaptations of fan-favorite source materials all inherently draw attention. While movies like Lift, The Old Guard 2, Rebel Moon: Part Two, and Damsel are slated in the action-adventure genre, expected rom-coms include Good Grief and A Family Affair. Trailers have already been released for some of Netflix&#39;s most anticipated 2024 movies, while the dates for others are still unconfirmed.









 








 15  Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F 
Release Date: Summer 2024
        

Eddie Murphy will return as Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F sometime in the summer of 2024. The character has not been seen since Beverly Hills Cop III&#39;s release in 1994. While the first Beverly Hills Cop movie was praised by critics, its two sequels failed to achieve the same acclaim. Still, a long-awaited sequel to a popular franchise always merits audience anticipation. Cast members from the original trilogy Judge Reinhold and Bronson Pinchot are also returning for the Beverly Hills Cop legacy sequel, with Kevin Bacon and Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing new characters.





 14  Lift 
Release Date: January 12


 







Kevin Hart stars in Neftlix&#39;s new heist comedy Lift, one of the streaming service&#39;s first original movies of 2024. Netflix&#39;s upcoming movie depicts a master thief (Hart) and his crew attempting to rob a vault while on a plane 40,000 feet in the air. Starring alongside Hart is Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Hart&#39;s character&#39;s ex-girlfriend who is an FBI agent, as well as Sam Worthington and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio. Heist movies have been popular ever since Ocean&#39;s Eleven, especially when there are some famous names attached to them, and Lift will surely have an eager audience.







 13  Spaceman 
Release Date: March 1
        

Adam Sandler had a successful Netflix release in 2023 with the animated movie Leo, but he will be starring in an entirely different Netflix original in 2024. Based on Jaroslav Kalfař&#39;s science fiction novel Spaceman of Bohemia, Spaceman follows the Czech Republic&#39;s first astronaut Jakub Procházka (Sandler) as he undertakes a dangerous mission to Venus. In addition to Adam Sandler, Spaceman also stars Carey Mulligan, Kunal Nayyar, and Isabella Rossellini. Only a short teaser for Spaceman has been released, and sci-fi fans will have to wait until March to see this new mysterious space adventure come to life.

 12  Orion And The Dark 
Release Date: February 2
        

Dreamworks appears to be entering a new era of partnership with Netflix and the studio&#39;s new animated movie Orion and the Dark is expected early in 2024. The title character Orion is a fearful boy who is approached by a personified character known as &#34;Dark,&#34; who takes him on an adventure to overcome his fears. Jacob Tremblay voices Orion, while Paul Walter Hauser voices Dark. Orion and the Dark is contending with mixed expectations because of Dreamworks&#39; 2023 box office bomb Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken, and Neftlix&#39;s success with Nimona.







 11  The Old Guard 2 
Release Date: TBC


 







2020&#39;s fantasy action movie The Old Guard, starring Charlize Theron as the leader of a team of immortal mercenaries, received good reviews. Theron, KiKi Layne, and Chiwetel Ejiofor will all be returning for The Old Guard 2, with Henry Golding and Uma Thurman playing new characters. The Old Guard&#39;s screenplay was written by Greg Rucka, who also wrote the graphic novel that the movie is based on. Because the original movie was successful and there is still source material to be adapted, The Old Guard movie series could potentially become a trilogy.





 10  The Piano Lesson 
Release Date: TBC
        

Anticipation is always high for a movie adaptation of an acclaimed source material. The Piano Lesson is set during the Great Depression and depicts the Charles family, who possess an heirloom piano covered in carvings made by an enslaved ancestor. Malcolm Washington&#39;s adaptation of August Wilson&#39;s 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning play stars Samuel L. Jackson and John David Washington. While Netflix has not confirmed a release date, The Economic Times reportedly said that &#34;it is safe to assume that the movie will be released sometime in the latter half of 2024.





 9  Wallace &amp; Gromit 
Release Date: TBC
        

Almost 20 years after the beloved claymation movie Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, the Aardman animation company is releasing a new Wallace &amp; Gromit movie on Netflix in 2024. This follows the success of Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget in 2023, as well as Aardman&#39;s collaboration with the Cartoon Museum in London to create an exhibit of never-before-seen Wallace &amp; Gromit artwork to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the characters&#39; debut. Amid the return of multiple milestone Aardman properties, the characters that made the studio famous will hopefully have an equally successful sequel.

 8  Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story 
Release Date: TBC
        

Jerry Seinfeld is co-writing, directing, producing, and starring in a 2024 comedy movie about the creation of the Pop-Tart, inspired by Seinfeld&#39;s joke about Pop-Tarts in his Netflix stand-up special 23 Hours to Kill. Unfrosted: The Pop-Tart Story was co-written by Seinfeld veteran Spike Feresten and comedian Barry Marder. Netflix describes (via whats-on-netflix.com) the movie as, “Michigan, 1963. Kellogg’s and Post, sworn cereal rivals, race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever. A tale of ambition, betrayal, sugar, and menacing milkmen.” A movie this bizarre created by multiple comedy icons is unsurprisingly garnering attention.





 7  Hit Man 
Release Date: TBC
        

Richard Linklater&#39;s new movie Hit Man was an audience favorite at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals in 2023 and has now been acquired by Netflix. Hit Man follows Glen Powell&#39;s Gary Johnson, an undercover cop posing as an assassin to catch the people who would employ him. However, he abandons his mission to help Adria Arjona&#39;s character escape her abusive husband and falls for her himself. Marketed as an action comedy, Hit Man is based on a true story recounted in a Texas Monthly article by Skip Hollandsworth.





 6  The Electric Stat 
Release Date: TBC
        

The Russo Brothers are returning in 2024 with their new sci-fi movie The Electric State, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Simon Stålenhag. If the Avengers directors are not enough to bring attention to the movie, the star-studded cast including Millie Bobby Brown, Chris Pratt, Stanley Tucci, and Ke Huy Quan certainly will. The Electric State follows an orphaned teenage girl traveling with a robot across the American West to find her missing brother. The graphic novel is set in an alternate reality of 1997, the year of its release. Additionally, this is only one of two 2024 Netflix original movies starring Brown.





 5  Good Grief 
Release Date: January 5


 







Making his directorial debut, Schitt&#39;s Creek showrunner Dan Levy writes, directs, and stars in the new comedy-drama Good Grief. Good Grief is about an artist who goes on a self-discovery trip to Paris with his two best friends after the unexpected death of his husband. Ruth Negga, Himesh Patel, Arnaud Valois, and Luke Evans star alongside Levy. Screen Rant interviewed Patel and Valois about Good Grief, discussing the relationships among the characters and working with Levy.







 4  The Kitchen 
Release Date: January 19
        

Get Out and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse star Daniel Kaluuya is also making his directorial debut this year with his movie The Kitchen, set in a dystopian London. Rapper and songwriter Kano stars as Izi, who is a resident of one of the city&#39;s last social housing projects known as &#34;the Kitchen.&#34; The story follows Izi as he takes the 12-year-old orphan Benji (Jedaiah Bannerman) under his wing. It will be interesting to see if and how Kaluuya drew upon his experience making movies with Oscar-winning director Jordan Peele while directing The Kitchen.





 3  A Family Affair 
Release Date: November 17
        

Fans of Netflix&#39;s rom-coms will be drawn in by the wild story and stacked cast of A Family Affair. Zac Efron is playing a fictional movie star, while Joey King plays a young woman who works for him. King&#39;s character&#39;s life is thrown into chaos when her boss begins a relationship with her mother, who is played by Nicole Kidman. A teaser trailer for A Family Affair shows King literally screaming and running into a wall when she finds Efron and Kidman together – audiences are probably in for a lot of funny moments like this. Cathy Bates also stars in the movie.

 2  Rebel Moon Part Two – The Scargiver 
Release Date: April 19
        

Zack Synder continues to divide the movie world with his new Rebel Moon series. Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, depicting a futuristic settlement threatened by invaders, holds a Rotten Tomatoes score of 24% but an audience score of 60%. Rebel Moon: Part Two – Scargiver will likely also be met with poor reviews but immense popularity. As of Jan. 2, Part One is still the most popular movie on Netflix (via Deadline), proving the anticipation for Part Two.







 1  Damsel 
Release Date: March 8


 







Millie Bobby Brown will star in the new fairytale-inspired movie Damsel in 2024, also starring Angel Bassett, Robin Wright, Nick Robinson, and Ray Winstone. Brown&#39;s character Elodie believes she is marrying a handsome prince, but is actually being sacrificed by the royal family. Elodie is thrown into a dragon&#39;s cave and must fight for survival, and it appears that most of the movie will focus on her trial. Recent movies like Princess and Rosaline demonstrate moviemakers&#39; interest in the subverted damsel-in-distress. The main premise combined with the return of one of Netflix&#39;s biggest stars makes Damsel Netflix&#39;s most anticipated movie of the year.
