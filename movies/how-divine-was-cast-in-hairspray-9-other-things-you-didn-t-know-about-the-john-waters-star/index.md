## Literature Review

Divine is one of the most interesting performers of the 20th century, best known for his collaborations with Hairspray director John Waters.




Harris Glenn Milstead, known by his stage name Divine, was an American actor, drag queen, and singer best known for his role in Hairspray. He rose to fame through his work with independent filmmaker John Waters, performing primarily female roles in both cinematic and theatrical productions. Divine&#39;s early interest in drag developed while working as a women&#39;s hairdresser, leading him to the countercultural scene of Baltimore where he met Waters. His portrayal of bold, often controversial characters, alongside his unique drag persona in his music career, made him an iconic figure in American counterculture. His career was still thriving when he passed away on March 7, 1988, at age 42.
Divine&#39;s collaboration with John Waters began in the mid-1960s when he joined Waters&#39; acting troupe, the Dreamlanders. He starred in Waters&#39; experimental films such as Roman Candles (1966), Eat Your Makeup (1968), and The Diane Linkletter Story (1969). His breakthrough came with Waters&#39; Pink Flamingos (1972), a cult classic that brought him fame in American counterculture. Divine continued to work with Waters, starring in films like Female Trouble (1974), Polyester (1981), and Hairspray (1988), the latter marking his entry into mainstream cinema and earning him a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.









 








 10  Divine Was Considered To Play Both Edna &amp; Tracy In Hairspray 
Divine still played two characters in the 1980s classic.
        

Divine, a prominent figure in Waters&#39; cinematic universe, was originally considered for two Hairspray central roles: Tracy Turnblad and her mother, Edna. This unique casting idea highlighted Divine&#39;s versatile talent and the daring creativity of Waters&#39; filmmaking. However, the film&#39;s distributor, New Line Cinema, was not in favor of this concept (via John Waters: Interviews), leading to its eventual abandonment. Divine still portrayed Edna Turnblad in Hairspray, a role that became one of his most memorable performances. Additionally, Divine played Arvin Hodgepile, the racist TV station manager. This film, which was Divine&#39;s last to be released during his lifetime, showcased his ability to captivate audiences with diverse and challenging characters.





 9  The Little Mermaid&#39;s Ursula Was Inspired By Divine 
Producer Howard Ashman was an admirer of Divine&#39;s work.


 







Divine&#39;s influence extended far beyond the boundaries of cult cinema, leaving a lasting impression in the world of mainstream animation. His flamboyant and commanding presence inspired one of Disney&#39;s most iconic villains, Ursula the sea witch, in The Little Mermaid. Howard Ashman, the executive producer of the film and a native of Baltimore like Divine, was a great admirer of the drag queen&#39;s work (via Cultura Colectiva). Ashman played a pivotal role in shaping Ursula&#39;s character, infusing Ursula with Divine&#39;s distinctive style and personality. This creative decision not only honored Divine&#39;s impact on popular culture but also brought a piece of his legacy to a new generation of audiences.

 8  Divine’s Appearance Is A Mix Between Jayne Mansfield &amp; Clarabell The Clown

Divine&#39;s striking appearance, a key element of his larger-than-life persona, was a deliberate and intricate creation by John Waters. Waters envisioned Divine as a fusion of the glamour of Jayne Mansfield, a 1950s Hollywood sex symbol, with the bizarre, exaggerated features of Clarabell the Clown (via The Quietus), a character known from early American television. This unique blend was vividly showcased in the film Pink Flamingos, where Divine&#39;s exaggerated blonde bombshell look became iconic. The movie featured Divine with a dramatically receded hairline and bold, excessive eye makeup, a style that became synonymous with his public image. This distinct look cemented Divine&#39;s status as an avant-garde icon.





 7  Divine Inspired Andy Warhol

Divine&#39;s unique persona and influence transcended the realm of film and theater, capturing the attention of iconic artist Andy Warhol. Warhol, known for his fascination with celebrity culture and the avant-garde, found a muse in Divine. He created portraits of Divine (via The Guardian), capturing the essence of his dramatic and flamboyant style. These artworks are a testament to Divine&#39;s impact on the contemporary art scene, showcasing how his distinct image and character resonated with leading artists of the time. Warhol&#39;s portrayal of Divine not only immortalized him in the pop art movement but also highlighted the intersection of drag culture with mainstream art, illustrating the influence of Divine&#39;s unconventional persona.





 6  Trouble In Mind&#39;s Gangster Hilly Blue Was Written With Divine In Mind 
Hilly Blue is one of Divine&#39;s few male characters.


 







In the excellent 1980s neo-noir film, Trouble in Mind, Divine took on a role that was a significant departure from his usual performances. He played the character of Hilly Blue, a gay male gangster. This role was specifically written with Divine in mind (via My Son Divine), showcasing the filmmakers&#39; recognition of his unique talent and ability to bring depth to diverse characters. Although Hilly Blue was not a major character in the film, Divine was eager to take on the role, as it allowed him to explore the portrayal of male characters, a contrast to his more frequent appearances in drag roles.





 5  Divine Isn’t Harris Milstead’s Only Alias 
Though his passport stated &#34;Divine&#34; as his real name.
        

Harris Glenn Milstead, famously known as Divine, had a versatile persona extending beyond his stage name. While Divine was the name given to him by John Waters, and one he fully embraced in his professional life, he was also known as Glenn among his close friends. The name Divine was not just a stage name but became a significant part of his identity, reflecting the transformation and impact he had in the world of entertainment and drag culture. However, while Milstead insisted Divine wasn&#39;t what he went by in his personal life, he did have Divine as his name on his passport at one point (via Not Simply Divine!).





 4  How Harris Milstead Got The Name Divine 
Waters named Milstead &#34;Divine&#34; when they started collaborating.
        

Harris Glenn Milstead&#39;s transformation into the iconic figure known as Divine was catalyzed by his close association with filmmaker John Waters. Waters, recognizing Milstead&#39;s unique persona and talent, bestowed upon him the name &#34;Divine&#34; (via Far Out). This name was more than just a moniker; it represented a new identity and an artistic vision. Waters described Divine as &#34;the most beautiful woman in the world...almost,&#34; a phrase that encapsulated the blend of glamour and irreverence that would come to define Divine&#39;s character. This naming was a pivotal moment in Milstead&#39;s life, marking the birth of an alter ego that would become legendary in the worlds of drag, film, and counterculture.





 3  Did Divine Really Steal Steaks During The Pink Flamingos Production? 
Waters confirmed that Divine was caught stealing.


 







Divine played many memorable John Waters characters, the most notable of which was in Pink Flamingoes, and rumors about Divine&#39;s behavior during the filming of the cult classic have long been a topic of interest. One such story involves Divine allegedly stealing steaks, just like the character did in the movie. While the full details of this specific incident are elusive, it&#39;s known that Divine was caught stealing in stores. Waters has spoken about Divine&#39;s various antics (via Vogue), noting:
&#34;Divine sometimes stole things like steaks, but I don’t think he did it that way. Once he walked into a store and got caught stealing the covers off a director’s chair. I said, &#39;You don’t even own a director’s chair! What were you thinking?&#39;&#34; 






 2  Divine’s Musical Career Was Successful In The UK 
&#34;You Think You&#39;re a Man&#34; reached no. 16 on British Magazine&#39;s dance charts.
        

While Divine is predominantly remembered for his iconic roles in film, he also had a notable career in music, particularly in the UK. Encouraged by his manager, Bernard Jay, to supplement his income, Divine began performing in nightclubs, which led to the recording of several disco singles. His distinctive gravelly voice, combined with thudding disco beats, produced hits like &#34;I&#39;m So Beautiful&#34; and &#34;You Think You&#39;re a Man.&#34; Although his music initially had limited success in the U.S., it found a significant audience in Britain. Divine&#39;s single &#34;You Think You&#39;re a Man&#34; reached number 16 on the UK Top 75 chart.





 1  People Named Divine “Drag Queen Of The Century” 
Divine had a huge impact on the drag community in the 20th century.
        

Divine&#39;s legacy extends beyond his filmography. His impact on the drag and LGBTQ&#43; communities has been profound, leading to his recognition as the “Drag Queen of the Century” (via Them). This title reflects the significant influence Divine had in shaping the perception and acceptance of drag culture. His bold, unapologetic style and fearless approach to his art broke boundaries and challenged societal norms. Divine&#39;s persona, characterized by its extravagance, defiance, and flair, became a symbol of empowerment and liberation within the queer community. His enduring influence continues to inspire drag artists, cementing his status not just as a remarkable entertainer but as an icon of cultural and social significance.
