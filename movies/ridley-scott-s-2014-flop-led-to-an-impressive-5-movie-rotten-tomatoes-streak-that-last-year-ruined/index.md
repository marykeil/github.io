## SUMMARY 



  Ridley Scott&#39;s 2014 film, &#34;Exodus: Gods &amp; Kings,&#34; was a flop, but it led to a streak of successful movies on Rotten Tomatoes.   Scott&#39;s next five films, including &#34;The Martian&#34; and &#34;Alien: Covenant,&#34; were all certified as &#34;fresh&#34; on Rotten Tomatoes.   Scott&#39;s streak ended in 2023 with his film &#34;Napoleon,&#34; which received mixed reviews, but he may start a new streak with his upcoming project, &#34;BOMB.&#34;

## Literature Review

Ridley Scott is quite the accomplished filmmaker, and his 2014 flop ended up setting him on an impressive and exciting Rotten Tomatoes Streak.




Ridley Scott is widely known to be one of the most accomplished filmmakers and directors of modern times, and his 2014 flop film ended up starting a winning streak for him. Scott is best known for being behind a number of classic films including Blade Runner, Alien, and American Gangster. He is highly regarded as a creative for giving actors the space to utilize their talent and abilities to improvise, which ultimately serves his projects well and allows for those involved to feel un-stifled.




Though Scott is quite the success story, like everyone else, he has had his missteps. In 2014, he released a film that was declared a failure on most accounts and was anticipated to be a hindrance to his future career. Scott was able to turn his luck around, though, and ended up beginning an impressive 5-year Rotten Tomatoes streak that proved his continued dominance in the entertainment space. This streak did come to an end in 2023, but it is highly possible that another one will begin for Scott following the announcement of his newest project.

                  Every Movie With A 0% Rating On Rotten Tomatoes   Even the worst movies still have their apologists, but these films don&#39;t have a single critic backing them, leading to a 0% Rotten Tomatoes score.   


 After Exodus: Gods &amp; Kinds, Ridley Scott Had 5 &#34;Fresh&#34; Movies On Rotten Tomatoes 
          




Ridley Scott directed Exodus: Gods &amp; Kinds, which was released in 2014. The movie follows Egyptian Princes and brothers Moses and Ramses as the latter becomes the pharaoh and banishes his sibling to the desert. The movie is widely regarded as a flop and only received a 31% rating on the Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes. Exodus: Gods &amp; Kinds only received a 35% audience score on the site, further confirming that the movie is &#34;rotten&#34;. While disappointing for Scott, the movie did lead to a streak of &#34;fresh&#34; movies.

Following the failure that was Exodus: Gods &amp; Kinds, Scott had a successful streak of &#34;fresh&#34; on Rotten Tomatoes. The next five of his films were at least &#34;fresh&#34;, even if some of them were only able to scrape by. The Martian had a 91% rating, followed by All The Money with 79%, Alien: Covenant with 65%, The Last Duel with 85%, and House of Gucci with 61%.



 Napoleon Broke Ridley Scott&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Streak 
Ridley Scott&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes streak is undeniably impressive, but it came to an end in 2023. Napoleon was not well-received by critics or audiences. This led to the film only receiving a 58% score on the Tomatometer and a 59% audience score. This is the first film in years of Scott&#39;s that has not been certified &#34;fresh&#34; on the site. With Scott confirmed to direct a new helm action thriller called BOMB, it is possible that he will begin his success streak once again.
