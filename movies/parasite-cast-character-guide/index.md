## Literature Review

Bong Joon-ho satirically explores class differences in Parasite, the cast of which includes acclaimed movie actors and popular K-drama stars.




The Parasite characters feature Bong Joon-ho&#39;s most renowned cast, thanks to the global success that the 2019 thriller garnered. From winning the Palme d&#39;Or at Cannes to creating history as the first non-English-language film to receive the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite introduced its acclaimed writer-director and its Korean-language-speaking cast to a larger audience. Revolving around a poor family&#39;s deceptive scheme to gain employment in a rich household, Parasite doubles as an anti-rich satire and an anxiety-inducing thriller. As is the case with Bong Joon-ho movies, Parasite is characterized by drastic tonal shifts, and the SAG Award-winning ensemble makes the best use of these transitions.




From capturing the amusement of mundane everyday activities to going down a dark path of homicidal chaos, the Parasite characters go through a lot. The sheer unpredictability of its plot makes Parasite one of the best movies to switch its style halfway through. Bong&#39;s cast plays a pivotal role with their nuanced performances not foreshadowing any of the final shocks. Reuniting with his frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho, the filmmaker assembled a stellar group of acting veterans and then-new faces from his home country. Here&#39;s a guide to the Parasite characters, the actors who play them, and what else each actor is known for.

Song previously collaborated with Bong Joon-ho on three films before being cast in Parasite, playing Detective Park Doo-man in the crime thriller Memories of Murder, snack vendor Park Gang-du in the monster film Host and train designer Namgoong Minsoo in the sci-fi action thriller —and Bong&#39;s English-language debut — Snowpiercer.
