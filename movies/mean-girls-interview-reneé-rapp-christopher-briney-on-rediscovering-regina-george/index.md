Summary

  Mean Girls (2024) is a reimagining of the classic comedy film as a musical, directed by Samantha Jayne and Arturo Perez Jr.   The movie follows Cady Heron as she moves from Africa to the United States and experiences a culture shock in public high school.   Cady gets involved with the popular clique, the Plastics, but things become complicated when she develops feelings for Regina&#39;s ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels.  





Tina Fey is taking another crack at the Plastics in Mean Girls (2024), an adaptation of the Broadway musical which is in turn an adaptation of her hit 2004 movie of the same name. While the new movie updates many of the references and plot points of the original, it also remixes several of the songs (which were written by Jeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin) from the stage production. Directed by Samantha Jayne &amp; Arturo Perez Jr., the new iteration even pays homage to the original by having Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles as Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall.




Mean Girls (2024) follows Cady Heron, who leaves her home in Kenya to move back to the U.S. with her mother. Her late entry into public high school experiences gets a boost from her newfound friendship with Janis (Auli&#39;i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), but she is soon catapulted into the orbit of the school&#39;s most popular clique: the Plastics. Led by Regina George (Reneé Rapp), the Plastics rule the teenage population and are happy to make Cady part of their group — that is until Regina learns that Cady has a crush on her ex-boyfriend, Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney, The Summer I Turned Pretty).

                  Mean Girls 2024 - Release Date, Cast, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Tina Fey is bringing Broadway to the big screen in the Mean Girls (2024), and there&#39;s already much to discuss before the movie releases.   

Screen Rant interviewed Reneé Rapp and Christopher Briney about their roles in the new Mean Girls, transferring Regina George from the stage back to the screen, and the difficult position of selling a love triangle.





 Reneé Rapp &amp; Christopher Briney Talk Mean Girls (2024) 
         

Screen Rant: Reneé, you were already fabulous as Regina on Broadway. Now you&#39;ve got to reinterpret her for the screen. What was it that you most wanted to bring out for her?


Reneé Rapp: I think I wanted to just do it again and do it again in a [new] version of myself. I&#39;m more comfortable in my person now. I&#39;m like doing the things that I always really wanted to do, and I think along with that comes a lot of new insecurities, absolutely. But I also think it comes along with a lot of newfound confidence and self-assuredness that I don&#39;t think I had when I was a teenager. That was my first job, let alone acting job. So it was exciting at the time and it was really exciting now.


Christopher, between Conrad and now Aaron, you&#39;re kind of cornering the market of teen heartthrob in a love triangle. How do you carry that burden?





Reneé Rapp: Oh, that&#39;s so true. What the hell? God, it&#39;s hard. Holy s--t, your life is so hard.
Christopher Briney: I&#39;ve developed back trouble in the last few years. I don&#39;t know. I appreciate that, but I also feel like not my burden to carry in some ways. I think for a while or I think it&#39;s really easy to habitually be like, how can I help people love this story? But I don&#39;t really think that&#39;s my approach to acting. I think my approach is how can I service the story? So yeah, I mean, both of these characters are part of a love triangle, but that&#39;s not [all].
Reneé Rapp: Have you ever been in a love triangle?
Christopher Briney: I don&#39;t think so.
Reneé Rapp: Is that true?
Christopher Briney: Probably not.


Obviously, the OG Mean Girls is infinitely memeable and hopefully we will see new memes sprout from this version. But do you each have a moment from the original that sticks with you or that is your favorite go-to?





Reneé Rapp: Everything.
Christopher Briney: Yeah, it&#39;s really good. The gym scene&#39;s really funny.
Reneé Rapp: The gym scene&#39;s hilarious. The gym scene is hilarious. I like Coach Carr’s, “You will get pregnant in that and die.” I always thought that was so funny.
Christopher Briney: I think it&#39;s funny that we can quote it and laugh.”
Reneé Rapp: Yeah, you&#39;re always saying some s--t and you&#39;re like, “Yeah, f--king hilarious.” I don&#39;t know, honestly, all of it. The script is like...
Christopher Briney: It&#39;s okay.
Reneé Rapp: It&#39;s fine.
Christopher Briney: It&#39;s fine.
Reneé Rapp: A few edits could have been made. No, it&#39;s really lovely.




 About Mean Girls 
          




From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic Mean Girls. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets out to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.
