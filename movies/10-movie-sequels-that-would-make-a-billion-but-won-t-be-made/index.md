# 10 Movie Sequels That Would Make A Billion (But Won t Be Made)


## SUMMARY 


 The Dark Knight 4 will never happen due to Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale&#39;s decision to bow out after their trilogy, prioritizing storytelling over box office success. 
 Tom Hanks refuses to make Forrest Gump 2, stating that he will only do it if there&#39;s a compelling reason, not just for commercial purposes. 
 Back to the Future 4 is unlikely to be made as director Robert Zemeckis admits he doesn&#39;t have an inspiring idea for a fourth film and is focused on producing Back to the Future: The Musical instead.

## Literature Review

Many unmade sequels stand to make over a billion in the box office - but it takes more than potential commercial success to green-light any follow-up.




Movie sequels that would make a billion - but won&#39;t be made - underscore the constant push and pull between the creative and commercial sides of the film industry. Capitalizing off the success of previous movies, the Hollywood sequel machine has consistently churned out billion-dollar follow-ups in the 21st century. On the other hand, even some of the most commercially successful sequels have also massively failed to live up to the expectations of both audiences and film critics.
Indeed, there are some planned movie sequels that thankfully never happened. Though certain sequel ideas are sure to break the billion-dollar box office ceiling, producing them could greatly hurt the legacy of the previous film, which is why many directors and actors have refused to make follow-ups to their highly successful movies. On the other hand, billion-dollar sequel plans that were actually great have also been killed by corporate decisions, or the directors or actors themselves fumbling the ball in the latest franchise installment. Whatever the case may be, even though these sequel concepts all have the potential to become blockbusters, they are unlikely to ever get made.









 








 10  The Dark Knight 4 
The Dark Knight Rises (2012) Global Box Office: $1.085 billion


 







  The Dark Knight Rises  


  Release Date    August 16, 2012     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Christian Bale , Anne Hathaway , Michael Caine , Gary Oldman     Runtime    2h 45m    


There are several reasons why The Dark Knight 4 will never happen, but it all boils down to Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale having made a pact to bow out after making their trilogy. On one hand, Bale has also kept the doors open by saying, &#34;if Chris Nolan ever said to himself, ‘You know what, I’ve got another story to tell.’ And if he wished to tell that story with me, I’d be in.” Indeed, Nolan is much more concerned about storytelling than box office goals. To actually make The Dark Knight 4, Nolan would need a much more compelling reason than potentially making over $2 billion worldwide.





 9  Forrest Gump 2 
Forrest Gump (1994) Global Box Office: $678.2 million


 







  Forrest Gump  


  Release Date    July 6, 1994     Director    Robert Zemeckis     Cast    Mykelti Williamson , Gary Sinise , Tom Hanks , Robin Wright , Sally Field     Runtime    142 minutes    


While Forrest Gump star Tom Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis did discuss the possibility of a sequel, Hanks capped off the discussion after just 40 minutes. &#34;A smart thing I did is I’ve never signed a contract that had a contractual obligation to a sequel,&#34; explained Hanks. &#34;I’ve always said, ‘Guys, if there’s a reason to do it, let’s do it. But you guys can’t force me. There is that natural inclination that is one of pure commerce that says, ‘Hey, you just had a hit, so do it again and you’ll have a hit.&#34; It&#39;s clear that Tom Hanks himself sees no reason to make Forrest Gump 2.

Tom Hanks says that the possibility of a sequel to Forrest Gump was put to bed after only 40 minutes of discussion with director Robert Zemeckis.








 8  Back To The Future 4 
Back to the Future Part III (1990) Global Box Office: $245.1 million
        

  Back to the Future Part III  


  Release Date    May 25, 1990     Director    Robert Zemeckis     Cast    Michael J. Fox , Christopher Lloyd , Mary Steenburgen     Runtime    118minutes    


Back to the Future trilogy director Robert Zemeckis has admitted that he simply didn&#39;t have an idea that was inspiring enough to warrant making a fourth film. According to Zemeckis, &#34;If I had an idea that I could have pitched to Bob [Gale] with a straight face, we would have made it.&#34; Moreover, both Zemeckis and Back to the Future franchise co-writer Bob Gale have outright dismissed the notion of Back to the Future 4 ever materializing. In fact, the two franchise creators have already put their focus on producing Back to the Future: The Musical, the success of which further kills the chances of Back to the Future 4.





 7  E.T. 2 
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) Global Box Office: $792.9 million
        

  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial  


  Release Date    June 11, 1982     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Drew Barrymore , Henry Thomas , Robert MacNaughton     Runtime    1h 55m    


E.T. screenwriter Melissa Mathison and Steven Spielberg actually wrote a sequel titled E.T. 2: Nocturnal Fears, a sci-fi horror that could&#39;ve dominated the sub-genre in the &#39;80s. However, Spielberg didn&#39;t want to “rob the original of its virginity” - Nocturnal Fears would&#39;ve been too dark a continuation for his blockbuster. Notably, E.T. held on to the title of highest-grossing movie of all time for over a decade, until Spielberg surpassed himself through Jurassic Park in 1993. With the Jurassic Park franchise having allowed Spielberg to explore his own version of sci-fi horror - and make more money than E.T. - Spielberg will never risk spoiling E.T.&#39;s legacy ever again.

 6  Godfather 4 
The Godfather Part III (1990) Global Box Office: $136.9 million
        

  The Godfather Part III  


  Release Date    December 25, 1990     Director    Francis Ford Coppola     Cast    Al Pacino , Andy Garcia , Diane Keaton     Runtime    142 minutes    


“In my mind there is only 1 film known as The Godfather (Parts I and II) and an epilogue or ‘coda’ The Death of Michael Corleone.” The Godfather trilogy director Francis Ford Coppola had this to say when he was asked on Instagram whether he would be interested in pursuing Godfather Part 4. Coppola is referring to The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, his final cut of the third film, which seems to have sealed the story for the director permanently. Someone else could make a sequel after Coppola and the IP rights have passed, but without Coppola&#39;s blessing, Godfather Part 4 is highly unlikely to get produced.





 5  Inception 2 
Inception (2010) Global Box Office: $839 million


 







  Inception  


  Release Date    July 16, 2010     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Tom Hardy , elliot page , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Cillian Murphy , Ken Watanabe , Marion Cotillard , Leonardo DiCaprio     Runtime    148 minutes    


The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises are the only two sequels in Inception director Christopher Nolan&#39;s filmography, which only materialized because Nolan and Christian Bale already had a plan for the trilogy. Although Nolan himself has avoided commenting on the matter, it&#39;s safe to assume that Inception 2 will never happen because the original already neatly tied up the story. In order to break Nolan&#39;s pattern of avoiding Hollywood&#39;s sequel machine, he would have to come up or be presented with more than just a billion-dollar idea to justify making Inception 2 - especially as the director has already clearly moved on to other worlds and successful projects.

Were the rumors that Christopher Nolan&#39;s sci-fi Tenet is a secret Inception sequel true? How do the movies link together and how do they differ?








 4  Titanic 2 
Titanic (1997) Global Box Office: $2.264 billion
        

  Titanic  


  Release Date    December 19, 1997     Director    James Cameron     Cast    David Warner , Kathy Bates , Billy Zane , Bill Paxton , Bernard Hill , Kate Winslet , Leonardo DiCaprio , Gloria Stuart , Frances Fisher , Victor Garber     Runtime    3h 14m    


Even after all the knockoff movies that have tried to capitalize off the box office record-breaking fame of Titanic, James Cameron making Titanic 2 could still potentially surpass the original&#39;s success. However, Cameron neither entertained the notion nor has he commented extensively on the possibility of Titanic 2 because it&#39;s obvious that the story ended with Titanic. The only real material left for the sequel would be the life of Rose after the first movie, which hasn&#39;t warranted nearly enough public interest to justify a sequel. Moreover - today and for the foreseeable future - Cameron is much more focused on creatively and commercially outdoing himself in the Avatar sequels.





 3  Spider-Man 4 
Spider-Man 3 (2007) $895 million
        

  Spider-Man 3  


  Release Date    May 4, 2007     Director    Sam Raimi     Cast    Tobey Maguire , James Franco , Topher Grace , Bryce Dallas Howard , Kirsten Dunst , Rosemary Harris , J. K. Simmons , Thomas Haden Church , James Cromwell     Runtime    139 minutes    


Spider-Man trilogy director Sam Raimi won&#39;t get the chance to break the $1 billion box office ceiling with Spider-Man 4 because the Marvel Cinematic Universe has already taken the reins from Raimi with 2021&#39;s Spider-Man: No Way Home. After No Way Home not only grossed $1.922 billion worldwide, but also merged the worlds of Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield&#39;s versions of Peter Parker, the MCU Spider-Man 4 movie is already in development and expected to make over $2 billion. Moreover, with the critically and commercially acclaimed Spider-Verse movies cornering the IP&#39;s presence in animated films, there&#39;s even lesser room for Raimi&#39;s original Spider-Man 4 plans to materialize.





 2  Twilight 6 
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 (2012) Global Box Office: $848.6 million
        

  Breaking Dawn  


  Release Date    November 18, 2011     Director    Bill Condon     Cast    Kellan Lutz , Jackson Rathbone , Michael Sheen , Robert Pattinson , Taylor Lautner , Kristen Stewart , Nikki Reed , Elizabeth Reaser , Ashley Greene , Peter Facinelli , Dakota Fanning , Billy Burke     Runtime    117 minutes (Part 1), 115 minutes (Part 2)    


After Breaking Dawn, which concluded the story of Edward and Bella, Stephenie Meyer didn&#39;t make any succeeding books or stories, leaving the movie franchise without any material left to adapt for more sequels. Meyer did release a more recent book called Midnight Sun - but it&#39;s basically just The Twilight Saga told from Edward Cullen&#39;s perspective. Moreover, while it&#39;s true that The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn – Part 2 had an open-ended finale, franchise star Robert Pattinson notoriously hated The Twilight Saga. In fact, after stars Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have reinvented themselves in the years following Twilight, they&#39;re very unlikely to agree to any Twilight 6 plans.





 1  The Lord of the Rings 4 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) Global Box Office: $1.764 billion
        

  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  


  Release Date    December 3, 2003     Director    Peter Jackson     Cast    Elijah Wood     Runtime    210minutes    


Following the critical and commercial failure of The Hobbit trilogy, LOTR trilogy director Peter Jackson has wisely avoided discussions regarding any sequel plans for the original fantasy franchise. As J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s story was concluded in The Return of the King, there&#39;s also no more material to adapt for LOTR 4. Furthermore, the changes made to J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s work by The Hobbit and Rings of Power have also soured the expectations of audiences when it comes to non-canon interpretations of Tolkien books. While the animated The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim could give the franchise new life, it is actually a prequel set before LOTR.
