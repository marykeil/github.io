## Literature Review

James Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe begins in 2024, and there are some exciting actors who could play a hero who was missing in the old DCEU — Green Arrow.




Green Arrow could be one of the heroes who will be part of the new DC Universe, and if James Gunn chooses to include Oliver Queen, there are some great choices to play the character. While the Arrowverse made Green Arrow an extremely popular figure over Arrow&#39;s eight seasons, with Stephen Amell&#39;s Oliver Queen being the founding hero of the DC TV universe, the DCEU never used the character. There were rumors that Green Arrow could have made his movie debut in the once planned Black Canary movie that would have starred Jurnee Smollett.
While those rumors were never confirmed, it seems like DC was at one point thinking about bringing Green Arrow to the big screen, as Charlie Hunman revealed that he turned down the offer to play Green Arrow. Hunman has been the favorite choice among fans to play Oliver Queen for years. With the actor revealing that he had the chance to do so but passed, the door is open for other names to gain momentum among fans to play Oliver Queen as the new DCU gets off the ground. Here are some exciting actors who could play Green Arrow in the upcoming DC movies.
            
 
 26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far  
James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.












 








 10  Taron Egerton Could Be A Great Oliver Queen Or Roy Harper 
Known For: The Kingsman Franchise, Rocketman, Black Bird, And More


 







Taron Egerton is one of the few actors who could excel as a younger Oliver Queen or as his protégé, Roy Harper, if the DCU ends up introducing an older Green Arrow. As Eggsy in the Kingsman franchise, Egerton has shown that he has impeccable comedic timing and physicality, both traits that are important for whoever gets cast as Green Arrow in the DCU. While Amell&#39;s Oliver was somber like Bruce Wayne, the hero is usually lighter in the comics, having a breezy view on life. In Black Bird, Egerton showed that he has Oliver&#39;s billionaire persona down, with a rough edge that also screams Roy Harper.





 9  Jamie Dornan Has Played A Billionaire Before 
Known For: The Fifty Shade Franchise, Belfast, The Fall, And More


 







If the DCU ends up going for a darker version of Green Arrow similar to how Amell portrayed the character on Arrow, then Jamie Dornan would be a great pick. In the Fifty Shades franchise, Dornan showed that he could easily pull off a charming billionaire with a secret to hide, which in Oliver Queen&#39;s case would be his double life as Star City&#39;s protector. In Once Upon a Time, Dornan even fired a few arrows as the Huntsman from Snow White&#39;s story, giving fans a peek at what he could look like as the DC Robin Hood-like hero.





 8  Garrett Hedlund Is The Spitting Image Of Oliver Queen 
Known For: Tron: Legacy, Tulsa King, Eragon, And More


 







In recent years, Garrett Hedlund has started to look like the comic book Oliver Queen jumped off the page into real life. Beyond the actor&#39;s impressive physical similarity to the DC hero, Hedlund has the acting skills to play Green Arrow in Gunn&#39;s DCU. In Tulsa King, the actor has shown his dramatic ability, with the power to deliver a nuanced performance as the character. Hedlund is most known for his work on Tron: Legacy, and with the franchise making a return without the actor, playing Green Arrow in the DCU could make up for his wasted potential in the sci-fi franchise.





 7  Austin Butler Has A Connection To Green Arrow 
Known For: Elvis, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood, Arrow, And More


 







Austin Butler is best known for his work in awards season movies such as Elvis and Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood. Butler&#39;s high-profile roles, which will continue with a role in Dune: Part Two, show that the actor is one of the most talented prospects for the new DCU. At 32, Butler would be a great choice to play Green Arrow for the next ten years, and the actor even has a connection to the character. Before he exploded in popularity, Butler appeared in a few episodes of Arrow as Chase, who was secretly sent by Malcolm Merlyn to kill Thea Queen.





 6  Wyatt Russell Could Go From Marvel To DC 
Known For: Black Mirror, The Falcon And The Winter Soldier, Monarch: Legacy Of Monsters, And More


 







Wyatt Russell is already part of the superhero world. With Gunn planning to cast some Marvel Cinematic Universe actors in his DCU, Russell would make for an interesting choice. The actor plays John Walker, aka U.S. Agent, in the MCU, with his next appearance set to happen in Marvel Studios&#39; Thunderbolts. Russell&#39;s franchise roles in the MCU and in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters evidence the actor&#39;s complete dedication to delivering nuanced, compelling characters that stand out in their cinematic universes. Given Green Arrow&#39;s huge potential, casting Russell as Oliver Queen would be a surefire way of getting the character to become a DCU fan-favorite.





 5  Chris Pratt&#39;s Ideal DCU Role Could Be Green Arrow 
Known For: The Guardians Of The Galaxy Franchise, The Jurassic World Franchise, Parks And Recreation, And More


 







It is all but set that Chris Pratt will have a role in the DCU. Gunn has talked about bringing actors from his Guardians of the Galaxy films to the DCU before, specifically talking about Pratt and Pom Klementieff when he said, &#34;There are reasons I wouldn’t want either of those actors to play themselves in the DCU!&#34; There are plenty of DC roles for Pratt; however, Oliver Queen might be the best of them. Green Arrow would allow Pratt to use both his excellent comedic timing and his physicality while also providing a very different hero from the MCU&#39;s Star-Lord, giving Pratt some street-level adventures in the DCU.





 4  Hayden Christensen Is The Perfect Green Arrow For An Extended Family 
Known For: The Star Wars Franchise, Jumper, Little Italy, And More


 







Hayden Christensen is making a career comeback after returning in multiple Star Wars projects as Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader. Christensen&#39;s hot streak could continue with Green Arrow in the DCU. As the actor behind one of the most famous characters of all time, Christensen would be able to handle the pressure that the first few releases in the DCU will face. In Ahsoka, Christensen showed many Oliver Queen qualities, with the actor being able to balance levity with more serious moments, as well as being the perfect person to bring a mentor Oliver Queen to the DCU if Roy Harper, Connor Hawke, and more are part of Gunn&#39;s plans.





 3  Zac Efron&#39;s Long-Awaited Superhero Role Could Be Green Arrow 
Known For: The High School Musical Franchise, The Iron Claw, The Greatest Showman, And More


 







Zac Efron commented on his desire to join the MCU in 2022, saying, &#34;I love the Marvel universe. I&#39;ve been a fan of Marvel since I started walking. If the right character comes along, and they want me to jump in, I would jump at the opportunity.&#34; While Efron might have yet to show any interest in DC, having Gunn as the DCU&#39;s creative chief could help bring in the actor. Efron is known for his hilarious roles, as well as his imposing physique and movie star charm. With his acclaimed dramatic performance in The Iron Claw, Efron could make Green Arrow a DCU star.





 2  Chace Crawford&#39;s The Boys Role Could Inform His Green Arrow 
Known For: The Boys, Gossip Girl, The Covenant, And More


 







Chace Crawford would be an interesting choice for the DCU&#39;s Green Arrow. Crawford already plays a superhero, giving life to the pathetic but hilarious The Deep in The Boys. Crawford has the charm, the physicality, and the comedic skills to portray a comic book-accurate version of Green Arrow in the DCU. Despite his roles in popular series like The Boys and Gossip Girl, Crawford is still not a major name. That could help his casting in the DCU, as Superman: Legacy&#39;s David Corenswet was once in a similar place. Crawford would be perfect for an outlandish Oliver Queen who relies on boxing glove arrows and whatnot.





 1  Ryan Gosling Is The DCU&#39;s Perfect Green Arrow 
Known For: Barbie, La La Land, The Notebook, And More


 







Finally, Ryan Gosling is the perfect choice to play Oliver Queen in the DCU. Gosling is one of the most talented and popular actors working today, which would instantly drive up interest in the DCU. Gosling has also shown that he has the credentials to play Green Arrow through many roles. The actor&#39;s turn in The Gray Man showed Gosling&#39;s action movie star quality, as did Blade Runner 2049. Gosling&#39;s undeniable charm also made Barbie and The Notebook major successes. As Oliver Queen, Gosling could potentially deliver the most charismatic character of the DCU, elevating Green Arrow to a new status, similarly to what the MCU did for Iron Man.
