## Literature Review

Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, the Coen brothers, and more lose to a hit 2014 film in a new ranking of the Top 10 Sundance films of all time.




Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, the Coen brothers, and more lose to a hit 2014 film in a new Top 10 ranking for the Sundance Film Festival. Founded in 1978 by Robert Redford, the Sundance Film Festival is held annually in Utah as a platform for showcasing independent filmmakers. Now the largest independent film festival in the United States, Sundance has launched the careers of many successful filmmakers, including Tarantino, Nolan, the Coen brothers, and many more who would go to be nominated for and win Academy Awards.




Ahead of the 40th Sundance Film Festival, kicking off on January 18, a survey was conducted to determine the Top 10 films that have screened at the festival. According to the results, Damien Chazelle&#39;s 2014 film Whiplash emerged as the winner. Check out the full Top 10 list below:


 

Whiplash beat out the likes of Tarantino&#39;s Reservoir Dogs at #2, Nolan&#39;s Memento at #5, and the Coen brothers&#39; Blood Simple at #10.

                  Every Damien Chazelle Movie, Ranked From Worst To Best   Damien Chazelle is an acclaimed and fascinating director with a filmography spanning multiple genres, from musical to epic Hollywood drama.   


 Breaking Down The All-Time Sundance Top 10 Ranking 
         




The Sundance Top 10 list is littered with debut features from great filmmakers who went on to lead successful careers in Hollywood. Starting at the top, Blood Simple was Joel and Ethan Coen&#39;s debut feature film, which won the festival&#39;s Grand Jury Award in 1985. Over the ensuing decades, the Coen brothers went on to cultivate a diverse filmography and win multiple Academy Awards, including Best Screenplay for Fargo and Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay for No Country for Old Men.

Richard Linklater is the only filmmaker with two titles in the Top 10 – Boyhood at #8 and Before Sunrise at #7. At #6, sex, lies and videotape was Steven Soderbergh&#39;s debut feature film, which won the festival&#39;s Audience Award. Both Linklater and Soderbergh have new projects debuting at this year&#39;s festival – 2023&#39;s Hit Man and Presence, respectively. Memento wasn&#39;t Nolan&#39;s debut feature film (which was 1998&#39;s Following), though it did win the festival&#39;s Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. In the top three, Get Out and Reservoir Dogs were the debut feature films of Jordan Peele and Tarantino.




Taking the top spot is Chazelle&#39;s Whiplash, an intense drama about an ambitious drumming student (Miles Teller) and his abusive instructor (J.K. Simmons). Whiplash won both the Grand Jury and Audience Awards at Sundance, and went on to win three Oscars, including one for Simmons. With his next movie, La La Land, Chazelle went on to become the youngest winner of the Academy Award for Best Director. Perhaps there is no better example than Whiplash to represent the power of the Sundance Film Festival in elevating independent filmmakers.



The 2024 Sundance Film Festival takes place from January 18 to 28.
