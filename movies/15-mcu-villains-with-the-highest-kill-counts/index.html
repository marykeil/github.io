Other villains, like Black Panther&rsquo;s Killmonger, are responsible for thousands of deaths.
But some MCU villains have claimed the lives of million, billions, and even trillions of living creatures.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From Gods to Titans to AI, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has witnessed some truly destructive villains. Here&rsquo;s a look at them, ranked by kill count.</p>
<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe often tones down the bloodshed to fit within a PG-13 rating but that doesn’t mean the franchise doesn’t boast villains with some shocking kill counts. From the invasion of New York in The Avengers to the fatal Infinity Gauntlet snap in Avengers: Infinity War&rsquo;s ending, the MCU has witnessed dark and unexpected moments of mass destruction. While some villains have the blood of hundreds on their hands, others can be attributed to killing billions or maybe even trillions, thanks to their efforts to reset entire timelines and dimensions. Considering the multiversal nature of the MCU, the victims include not just humans but also aliens and celestial beings.
But who is the bloodiest villain of the MCU timeline? With some kill counts incorporating the deaths of entire planets (or at least half of them), estimated numbers can help if not precise figures. This would explain why MCU fans on social media forums keep arguing over the MCU villain with the highest kill count. But still, the rankings can be adjusted after considering visual cues from the movies and the Disney+ shows, and additional materials. With the multiverse of the MCU only expanding with future releases, some more terrifying villains can be expected to ramp up the overall kill count.

Every Marvel Villain Confirmed For MCU Phase 5 (So Far)
Phase 5 of the MCU is set to introduce several new villains, with a number of them already confirmed as part of the franchise&rsquo;s upcoming projects.</p>
<p>15  Loki
Kill Count: At least 177</p>
<p>Loki might have changed his ways in his self-titled TV series but Thor’s step-brother was one of MCU’s first ruthless villains, and this is more than evident from his invasion of New York in The Avengers. Stabbing multiple SHIELD officials and police officers to death, Loki and his Chitauri army terrorized many civilians. In fact, the god of mischief was responsible for at least 154 civilian deaths within a matter of two days, as confirmed by Black Widow before the invasion of New York and in Captain America: Civil War by General Ross. And then there&rsquo;s Agent Coulson, of course.
Beyond The Avengers, Loki also killed four Dark Elves and disintegrated Algrim The Strong in Thor: The Dark World and once he had given up being a villain, he even killed 14 guards and three Berserkers in Thor: Ragnarok.</p>
<p>14  Ultron
Kill Count: 177 humans and 2 robots.</p>
<p>Created by Tony Stark and then gaining sentient consciousness of his own, Ultron and his robotic minions caused the loss of 177 civilian lives in the country of Sokovia (according to the official MCU handbook). This massacre was crucial to the future of the MCU as its aftermath included the Sokovia Accords in Captain America: Civil War, a U.S. government-backed treaty to control superhero collateral damage. The speedster Quicksilver’s death in Avengers: Age of Ultron was also caused by the Artificial Intelligence supervillain. Interestingly, the movie also found Ultron ripping apart a rogue Ultron MK#3 and prompting a robot sentry to self-explode to attack Hawkeye and Wanda Maximoff.
Sokovia lies somewhere between Slovakia and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>13  Hela
Kill Count: 371 people (plus countless thousands)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The surprise villain of Thor: Ragnarok was Odin’s firstborn child and the Goddess of Death, Hela. One can argue that as Hela contributed to Asgard’s end in the movie, she carries the burden of the death of thousands, but considering most of Asgard’s annihilation was brought about by Surtur, Hela’s actual kill count comes down to a little more than 300 people. Wielding the Necrosword, she also slayed all members of the Warriors Three (Volstagg, Fandral, and Hogun) and her minion-turned-defector Skurge the Executioner. Hela also laid waste to the 9 Realms under Odin&rsquo;s command before he imprisoned her, but it&rsquo;s unclear exactly how many victims she is responsible for.</p>
<p>12  Gravik
Kill Count: 2,059 Humans and 6 Skrulls</p>
<p>Gravik, the radical Skrull leader waging war on Earth, served as the main villain in Secret Invasion. With his plans to manipulate humanity into starting a self-destructive nuclear conflict, Gravik orchestrated several covert operations such as the Unity Day Bombing at Russia&rsquo;s Vossoyedineniye Square. This explosion alone killed 2,000 people as the show implied. His most prominent kills include S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Maria Hill and the friendly Skrull Talos. While he shot the former in the chest, he allowed Skrull Resistance member Pagon to shoot Talos first and then Gravik to stab him to death. Gravik later fatally stabs Pagon too using replicated Groot tentacles to do the deed.</p>
<p>11  Killmonger
Kill Count: 2,207 humans</p>
<p>Even before Erik Killmonger set foot in Wakanda, he already had a confirmed kill count of 2200 during his military service. This number can be determined from the number of self-inflicted scars that adorn his body, each scar being a marker of a victim whom he killed as a soldier. The number of scars was revealed by Killmonger actor Michael B Jordan himself, as revealed by Cinema Blend. While all of these deaths take place off-screen, Killmonger kills a total of seven people in Black Panther. His targets include weapons dealer Ulysses Klaue, Klaue&rsquo;s criminal associate Limbani, and fellow black-ops operative and lover Linda, whom he betrays and kills.</p>

Michael B. Jordan made a creative choice for his return as Killmonger in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which made his MCU cameo even more powerful.</p>
<p>10  Surtur
Kill Count: 9,720 Asgardians</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Signifying the Scandinavian apocalyptic event known as Ragnarök the gargantuan beast Surtur was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Asgardians. The Fire Demon who dwells in the realm of Muspelheim, is introduced in Thor: Ragnarok alongside a skeleton of an unknown species. Including this decimated victim, a TVA file in Loki revealed that Surtur killed 9,718 Asgardians as he fulfilled the apocalyptic prophecy of Ragnarök. His most high-profile kill is the Death goddess Hela, who is crushed to death by his Twilight Sword. Surtur’s wrath offered a major blow to the population of Asgard as they had to migrate to Earth (aka Midgard) to seek refuge.
Surtur is voiced by Clancy Brown who also voiced Red Hulk in Marvel&rsquo;s animated shows.</p>
<p>9  Ego
Kill Count: Unknown, but anywhere between thousands to millions</p>
<p>Ego is a Celestial with god-like powers whose expansionist policies kill off hordes of people on thousands of planets. Over the billions of years that he had lived, Ego had always wanted to experience what it was like to live as a mere mortal. This led him to the conclusion that he wanted to embrace the entire cosmos. He matched with partners one by one and produced offspring with nearly every species. He succeeded in sowing his seed on numerous planets. And while Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 didn&rsquo;t offer an exact number, it&rsquo;s possible that Ego&rsquo;s spores killed hundreds of thousands if not millions.
Ego The Living Planet first appeared in Thor #132 and was created by Marvel legends Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.</p>
<p>8  Kang The Conqueror
Kill Count: Unknown, but likely in the billions?</p>
<p>Nathaniel Richards aka Kang the Conqueror, one of the many variants of Kang introduced in Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, joins the billion kill club of MCU villains. But because both the TV series and the movie suggest that the 31st-century scientist destroyed multiple worlds and timelines, the exact number of his kills cannot be determined as of now. It is still easy to deduce that he might have killed billions and was more brutal than the Council of Kangs in Quantumania, explaining why the variants exiled Kang to the Quantum Realm.</p>
<p>7  High Evolutionary
Kill Count: 4.4 billion</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The High Evolutionary makes for quite a deranged villain in the MCU, thanks to his obsession with genetic perfection in the worlds that he creates. A gifted scientist with a God complex, he is responsible for the deaths of 4,458,003,512 Humanimals (human-animal hybrids) on Counter-Earth after he became dissatisfied with the planet&rsquo;s inhabitants. He is also quick to kill any potential enemies who can overthrow his power, which explains why he also kills allies like High Priestess Ayesha and Recorder Vim. The High Evolutionary&rsquo;s fatal rage is particularly painful to watch in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 as he kills Rocket Raccoon&rsquo;s friends and fellow test subjects like Lylla.</p>
<p>6  Supreme Strange
Kill Count: Over 7 billion</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Within the multiverse, a rogue version of Doctor Strange ended up killing 7.4 billion humans, 15 demonic entities, and Dormammu, the primordial lifeform of the Dark Dimension. Christened as Supreme Strange, he was introduced in What If…? where he is misguided in his quest to save Christine Palmer (whom he accidentally disintegrated later). His relentless pursuit of saving her leads to reshifting timelines and annihilating the entire planet and the 7 billion people along with it. Additionally, he kills and absorbs the powers of multiple demons, dragons, and goblins. This version of Strange also clearly doesn’t bargain with Dormammu and instantly kills him as he ends the universe.</p>
<p>5  The Celestials
Kill Count: At least 32 billion</p>
<p>True to their origins in comics, Eternals accurately showcased the damaging processes through which Celestials are born. Celestial embryos are often implanted within the core of a planet and millions of years later, these Celestials are born by consuming the entire planet. This would explain why the four Celestials (Arishem the Judge, Jemiah the Analyzer, Nezarr the Calculator, Hargen the Measurer) in the movie collectively led to the death of billions. With an average of 8.1 billion people dying on each of the four planets, the Celestials are some of the most menacing villains in the MCU even if all of these deaths are referenced off-screen.</p>

<p>4  Infinity Ultron
Kill Count: 77 billion</p>
<p>MCU’s original Ultron pales in comparison to his Infinity Gauntlet-wearing counterpart in What If…?. Driven by a plan to take over the entire universe, he defeats the Avengers in this alternate timeline and instantly wipes out all of humanity. Once he’s done with Earth, Infinity Ultron plans on killing people from other worlds as well. For instance, Infinity Ultron killed 50,000 Asgardians, 10,000 zombies, 7.3 billion people on Sakaar, 12 billion people on Xandar, and 36 billion others from numerous unnamed planets. Even superior beings like Thanos, Grandmaster, and Ego were killed by this Earth-29929 variant of Ultron.
Infinity Ultron killed 50,000 Asgardians, 10,000 zombies, 7.3 billion people on Sakaar, 12 billion people on Xandar, and 36 billion others from numerous unnamed planets.</p>
<p>3  Sinister Strange
Kill Count: 1 trillion</p>
<p>The Earth-TRN954 version of the Sorcerer Supreme introduced in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, has had a jaw-dropping kill count of one trillion two deaths. Rejected by Christie in a post-Thanos-world, this variant of Doctor Strange killed two alternate versions of himself out of self-hatred while also looking for an alternate world&rsquo;s Christine to settle down with. After he eventually discovered a universe in which he and Christine were happy, he accidentally caused an incursion between the two realities, bringing both of them to ruin and chaos and leaving them in a post-incursion condition. The destruction of these realities killed off Christine and 999,999,999,999 individuals.</p>
<p>2  Thanos
Kill Count: Over 5 trillion</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The Mad Titan who collected all the Infinity Stones, Thanos was responsible for the death of billions even before he finally laid his hands on all the stones in Avengers: Infinity War. But for those seeking an exact number, the deadly snap in the movie’s first act is enough to give him an upper hand over other MCU villains who have killed the most. Assuming that the universe of Earth-199999 has 10 trillion lifeforms, Thanos’ snap reduced half of the universe with him being responsible for 5 trillion deaths in a second. While Avengers: Endgame resurrected most of the victims, Thanos did set an unbeatable kill count at the time.</p>
<p>1  The TVA
Kill Count: Possibly trillions</p>
<p>The Time Variance Authority (TVA) was introduced as guardians of the multiverse in Loki season 1. But by the end of this season, it was clear that the TVA officials were ready to go to any extent to maintain balance in the timelines, even if it meant decimating entire populations in those timelines. Their genocidal tendencies were more than evident in the sophomore season when the TVA pruned various branches that were destabilizing the Sacred Timeline. The Loki villains made Thanos’ snap look insignificant as the Mad Titan decimated half of his universe at random, while the TVA purposely killed off entire universes.
