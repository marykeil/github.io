<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe has killed off several characters from its history, only for them to dramatically return in future installments.</p>
<p>Warning! This article contains spoilers for the Disney+ series Echo.The Marvel Cinematic Universe has repeatedly fooled audiences into thinking that central characters were dead, only to shockingly reveal that they had in fact survived. The MCU timeline has featured several apparent character deaths, often drawn straight from the comics. While those familiar with the source material know how certain characters will inevitably return in the MCU&rsquo;s upcoming releases, for many audiences, various character returns proved incredibly surprising.
Marvel Comics is infamous for killing characters and subsequently resurrecting them. The phenomenon has slowly become more prevalent in the cinematic franchise and is often more surprising. The franchise has exploited the apparent permanence of cinematic deaths to fool audiences and offer a surprising character return, sometimes years later. This malleable approach to its characters&rsquo; mortality will be helpful considering the issues surrounding Jonathon Majors&rsquo; Kang and could prove vital in allowing fan-favorite characters to return to the franchise in the future.</p>
<p>10  Loki Has Cheated Death On Several Occasions In The MCU
Loki Was Killed By Thanos In Avengers: Infinity War</p>
<p>Loki has cheated death in the MCU on numerous occasions. His first purported demise was in Thor when he fell into the abyss, which led to a surprise return in The Avengers. In Thor: Dark World, Loki&rsquo;s sacrificial act during the movie&rsquo;s climax proved to be another deceptive maneuver, as he faked his death, orchestrating a complex plan to assume the Asgardian throne. Loki&rsquo;s death in Avengers: Infinity War was far more definitive, seemingly killing the MCU&rsquo;s Loki for good. However, a version of Loki subsequently escaped during the Avengers: Endgame time heist, continuing the character&rsquo;s story once more. This Loki variant led the Disney+ series Loki for two seasons, leading to profound character evolution.</p>
<p>9  Kingpin Was Supposedly Killed In Hawkeye
Kingpin Was Revealed To Have Survived In Echo</p>
<p>Vincent D&rsquo;Onofrio&rsquo;s Kingpin from Netflix&rsquo;s Daredevil proved so compelling and popular that the actor reprized his role in a surprising twist in the MCU&rsquo;s Hawkeye miniseries. Kingpin, real name Wilson Fisk, emerged as the criminal mastermind behind several key events, which culminated in him being shot by Echo at point-blank range. The implication was that Kingpin died in Hawkeye​​​​​​, but the actual shooting occurred off-screen - much like Echo&rsquo;s confrontation with the villain in Marvel Comics. Incredibly, Fisk survived and returned in the Disney+ miniseries Echo to terrorize the MCU and the eponymous antihero. Fisk was depicted recovering from his injuries in Echo season 1, episode 1 &ldquo;Chafa,&rdquo; where he sports a bandaged eye and continues as the series&rsquo; primary antagonist.</p>
<p>Has Marvel Retconned Kingpin’s Netflix Backstory For The MCU?
Kingpin’s latest MCU appearance in Echo delves into the character’s backstory, begging the question of whether this was changed from Daredevil.</p>
<p>8  Yellowjacket Was Seemingly Killed In Ant-Man
Darren Cross Was Resurrected As MODOK In Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania</p>
<p>Darren Cross was the primary antagonist in Ant-Man. He was Hank Pym&rsquo;s former protégé, who designed his own shrinking suit, dubbed Yellow Jacket. However, Cross&rsquo;s Yellowjacket costume malfunctioned during the climactic battle with Ant-Man and violently shrunk. Cross was seemingly killed in the process, receiving brutal injuries and disappearing into the Quantum Realm. Darren Cross survived, however, and would resurface as a controversial version of MODOK in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Kang the Conqueror found and transformed Cross into the Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, giving him his distinct armor to accommodate his contorted body. Cross&rsquo;s return was short-lived, ultimately sacrificing himself to help defeat Kang.</p>
<p>7  Groot Sacrificed Himself In Guardians Of The Galaxy
Baby Groot Is Subsequently Born In Guardians Of The Galaxy</p>
<p>In Guardians of the Galaxy&rsquo;s emotional final scene, Groot sacrifices himself to shield his friends from harm. Growing his tree-like limbs into a ball around the eponymous heroes, Groot appeared to perish in a tragic twist. The movie stunned audiences, however, with a heartwarming surprise when a small sprout emerged, revealing the next generation of Groot - often referred to as Baby Groot. Baby Groot became an iconic member of the Guardians, and age would age throughout each of his subsequent appearances in the MCU, maintaining his legacy as an immensely valuable hero following his initial noble deed.</p>
<p>6  Janet Van Dyne Was Thought To Be Lost Forever In Ant-Man
Janet Van Dyne Was Rescued From The Quantum Realm In Ant-Man And The Wasp</p>
<p>Tragic flashbacks revealed Janet Van Dyne&rsquo;s fate in Ant-Man. As the original Wasp and wife to Hank Pym, Janet disappeared while on a mission in 1987, sacrificing herself to bring down a Soviet nuclear missile. Janet shrunk down to a subatomic level and was thought to be trapped in the Quantum Realm. After Scott Lang safely returned from a similar predicament during the movie&rsquo;s climax, Hank Pym restarted his efforts to rescue his wife. Janet Van Dyne is finally recovered from the Quantum Realm and was confirmed to be alive in Ant-Man and the Wasp, with drastic ramifications - instigating the MCU&rsquo;s future narrative regarding Kang and the Quantum Realm.</p>
<p>5  Phil Coulson Was Fatally Stabbed By Loki in The Avengers
Coulson Subsequently Returned In Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>
<p>In The Avengers, the death of Phil Coulson, S.H.I.E.L.D.&rsquo;s dedicated agent, served as a poignant moment, rallying the team against Loki. However, Coulson&rsquo;s journey did not conclude there. The character experienced an unexpected resurrection in the television series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. The show revealed that through advanced medical procedures orchestrated by SHIELD and Nick Fury, exploring the repercussions of his revival. This twist delighted audiences and deepened the character&rsquo;s narrative, illustrating the clandestine efforts of both Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.​​​​​ While it seems Agents Of SHIELD is now likely not canon to the main MCU - especially as movies have carefully skirted around addressing it - Coulson&rsquo;s return became a central element in the show, fostering a dynamic relationship between its cinematic and televised realms and expanding the character&rsquo;s legacy.</p>
<p>4  Bucky Barnes Fell To His Death In Captain America: The First Avenger
Bucky Returned In Captain America: The Winter Soldier</p>
<p>In Captain America: The First Avenger, Bucky Barnes, Steve Rogers&rsquo; loyal friend and comrade, met his apparent demise during a perilous mission - falling from a moving train. The impact of Captain America&rsquo;s loss echoed throughout the narrative, leaving an emotional void. However, the MCU delivered a riveting twist in Captain America: The Winter Soldier as Bucky resurfaced. Barnes was brainwashed and transformed into the formidable Winter Soldier, an agent of HYDRA. The revelation of Bucky&rsquo;s survival shocked viewers and became a linchpin in the unfolding storyline. The character&rsquo;s return brought a complex layer to the narrative, exploring themes of identity, memory, and the cost of war.</p>
<p>3  Nick Fury Faked His Death In Captain America: The Winter Soldier
Nick Fury Was Subsequently Revealed To Be Alive</p>
<p>In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the MCU stunned audiences when it was revealed that Nick Fury had faked his death. The movie previously depicted Fury being assassinated in a deadly attack orchestrated by the mysterious Winter Soldier. This clever ruse unfolded as part of Fury&rsquo;s strategy to expose a deep-rooted conspiracy within SHIELD and allow him to operate off the grid. The revelation not only showcased Fury&rsquo;s resourcefulness but also heightened the suspense and intrigue surrounding the unfolding narrative. His survival provided a pivotal turning point, influencing the subsequent events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>2  Half Of The Avengers Turned To Dust In Avengers: Infinity War
The Characters Were Restored In Avengers: Endgame</p>
<p>Avengers: Infinity War depicted the MCU&rsquo;s most seismic event, as Thanos proved victorious and enacted his devastating plan to wipe out half of all life with a snap of his fingers. This catastrophic event resulted in the deaths of several key Avengers, including Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Doctor Strange. The unexpected climax of Infinity War delivered a devastating blow to audiences as several beloved heroes turned to dust, leaving a somber and uncertain atmosphere. For those unfamiliar with the source material, the Snap was completely unexpected and tragic. Of course, the surviving Avengers managed to resurrect their fallen comrades in Avengers: Endgame, concluding the MCU&rsquo;s first phase.</p>
<p>1  Red Skull Mysteriously Vanished In Captain America: The First Avenger
Red Skull Reappeared In Avengers: Infinity War</p>
<p>Red Skull&rsquo;s apparent demise in Captain America: The First Avenger occurred when he grabbed the Tesseract, leading to a dazzling display of cosmic energy that seemingly disintegrated him. Red Skull&rsquo;s fate remained shrouded in mystery, until his unexpected return in Avengers: Infinity War. It was revealed that the Tesseract transported Red Skull to the planet Vormir, where he was cursed to become the guardian of the Soul Stone. Red Skull&rsquo;s reappearance served as a surprising and satisfying connection between the earlier and later chapters of the MCU, demonstrating the franchise&rsquo;s intricate and interconnected narratives. Red Skull&rsquo;s return was one of the most unexpected in the complex history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
