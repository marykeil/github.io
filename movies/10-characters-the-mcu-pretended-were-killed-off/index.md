## Literature Review

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has killed off several characters from its history, only for them to dramatically return in future installments.




Warning! This article contains spoilers for the Disney&#43; series Echo.The Marvel Cinematic Universe has repeatedly fooled audiences into thinking that central characters were dead, only to shockingly reveal that they had in fact survived. The MCU timeline has featured several apparent character deaths, often drawn straight from the comics. While those familiar with the source material know how certain characters will inevitably return in the MCU&#39;s upcoming releases, for many audiences, various character returns proved incredibly surprising.
Marvel Comics is infamous for killing characters and subsequently resurrecting them. The phenomenon has slowly become more prevalent in the cinematic franchise and is often more surprising. The franchise has exploited the apparent permanence of cinematic deaths to fool audiences and offer a surprising character return, sometimes years later. This malleable approach to its characters&#39; mortality will be helpful considering the issues surrounding Jonathon Majors&#39; Kang and could prove vital in allowing fan-favorite characters to return to the franchise in the future.









 








 10  Loki Has Cheated Death On Several Occasions In The MCU 
Loki Was Killed By Thanos In Avengers: Infinity War


 







Loki has cheated death in the MCU on numerous occasions. His first purported demise was in Thor when he fell into the abyss, which led to a surprise return in The Avengers. In Thor: Dark World, Loki&#39;s sacrificial act during the movie&#39;s climax proved to be another deceptive maneuver, as he faked his death, orchestrating a complex plan to assume the Asgardian throne. Loki&#39;s death in Avengers: Infinity War was far more definitive, seemingly killing the MCU&#39;s Loki for good. However, a version of Loki subsequently escaped during the Avengers: Endgame time heist, continuing the character&#39;s story once more. This Loki variant led the Disney&#43; series Loki for two seasons, leading to profound character evolution.





 9  Kingpin Was Supposedly Killed In Hawkeye 
Kingpin Was Revealed To Have Survived In Echo


 







Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Kingpin from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil proved so compelling and popular that the actor reprized his role in a surprising twist in the MCU&#39;s Hawkeye miniseries. Kingpin, real name Wilson Fisk, emerged as the criminal mastermind behind several key events, which culminated in him being shot by Echo at point-blank range. The implication was that Kingpin died in Hawkeye​​​​​​, but the actual shooting occurred off-screen - much like Echo&#39;s confrontation with the villain in Marvel Comics. Incredibly, Fisk survived and returned in the Disney&#43; miniseries Echo to terrorize the MCU and the eponymous antihero. Fisk was depicted recovering from his injuries in Echo season 1, episode 1 &#34;Chafa,&#34; where he sports a bandaged eye and continues as the series&#39; primary antagonist.

Cross was seemingly killed in the process, receiving brutal injuries and disappearing into the Quantum Realm. Darren Cross survived, however, and would resurface as a controversial version of MODOK in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania.
