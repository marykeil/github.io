## Literature Review

In the world of science fiction films, anything is possible. This leads to a large number of theories that totally change iconic movies.




Due to the alternative worlds and fantastical nature of sci-fi movies, there are so many theories that totally change iconic films. The endless possibilities within the sci-fi genre mean that absolutely anything is possible and those with inquisitive and idiosyncratic thought processes are quick to pontificate about a whole host of theories that end up leading to incredible alternative understandings of beloved movies. These theories can range from one lone audience member who has a unique take on a classic film, large sections of the viewing audience who discuss major theories, or even the filmmakers and stars themselves who give their own take on what could be possible in iconic sci-fi movies.
There are some sci-fi theories that at first seem like small details that when properly explored have major consequences on the overall understanding of a movie and are plenty of theories that end up being better than the actual story. Other theories don’t have as much of an effect on the actual plot points of films but carry more weight when it comes to the thematic or symbolic power of a film. There are even theories that bring together two different sci-fi worlds entirely and give credit to the idea that different alien races may be aware of each other’s existence.









 








 10  Neo Is Not The One And Just Another Part Of The Matrix 
The Matrix (1999)


 







In The Matrix, Keanu Reeve’s character of Neo was believed to be The One who will lead humanity&#39;s victory over machines, so much so that his name is even an anagram for this role. While there are plenty of hints Neo was not the first One, a more interesting theory is that Neo is a creation of the Matrix itself, a subsystem computer program created by the Oracle intentionally to perpetuate control. This theory subverts the hero’s journey narrative of The Matrix and positions Neo not as a saviour, but just another cog in the machine.





 9  Rick Deckard Is A Replicant 
Blade Runner (1982)
        

  Blade Runner  


  Release Date    June 25, 1982     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Harrison Ford , Rutger Hauer , Sean Young , Edward James Olmos , M. Emmet Walsh , Daryl Hannah , William Sanderson , Joe Turkel     Runtime    117 minutes    


Whether Rick Deckard from Blade Runner was a replicant the entire time has been an ongoing debate for decades. Director Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford have admitted their belief that Deckard was a replicant; however, it is not so clear cut as the multiple versions of the original Blade Runner film make it tougher to give a definitive answer, and Deckard was a human in the Philip K. Dick novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? that it was based on. The mystery around Deckard’s true identity is one of the most important themes of Blade Runner as it brings out philosophical questions about what makes a person truly human.





 8  Everything Is A Dream Within A Dream 
Inception (2010)
        

  Inception  


  Release Date    July 16, 2010     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Tom Hardy , elliot page , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Cillian Murphy , Ken Watanabe , Marion Cotillard , Leonardo DiCaprio     Runtime    148 minutes    


One of the most popular Inception theories proposes that everything was a dream. This was backed up by its famously open-ended conclusion where Cobb’s spinning top continues to spin, insinuating a possibility that he was still dreaming. If this were the case, audiences would be forced to reckon with the unreliable nature of the movie and the possibility that there are zero moments in Inception that were not set in a dream world. However, Cobb’s satisfaction as he was seen playing with his children at the end of the film showcased that for him it no longer mattered, if he could be happy then he would allow himself to live in a false reality.





 7  John Connor Orchestrated His Own Existence 
The Terminator (1984)
        

  Terminator  


  Release Date    October 26, 1984     Director    James Cameron     Cast    Michael Biehn , Linda Hamilton , Lance Henriksen , Paul Winfield , Arnold Schwarzenegger     Runtime    107 minutes    


The time-travel nature of The Terminator created a paradox where John Connor must have orchestrated his existence. When a cybernetic assassin was sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor, her son John sent a Kyle Reese to protect her and ensure she would survive, and he would be born. As a result, Kyle became John’s father, meaning that if John knew about his real parentage, then John was the instigating factor in his birth, creating an endless loop with no origin. Considering this, The Terminator brings up more questions than it answers as, if Skynet never sent the T-800, then there would be no John Connor at all.





 6  E.T. Is A Jedi 
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)


 







  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial  


  Release Date    June 11, 1982     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Drew Barrymore , Henry Thomas , Robert MacNaughton     Runtime    1h 55m    


There was a theory that the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial was an extragalactic time-traveling Jedi from the Star Wars universe. While this may seem outrageous, there’s quite a lot of evidence to back up this surprising crossover of iconic sci-fi films. The first clue was that E.T.’s telepathic powers are simply him utilizing the Force. The second was a scene in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial where E.T. seemed to recognize Jedi master Yoda when a child was dressed as him on Halloween. But the most damming piece of evidence is that an alien of E.T. species is seen in the senate in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.





 5  Jones The Cat Is Actually An Android 
Alien (1979)
        

  Alien (1979)  


  Release Date    June 22, 1979     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Sigourney Weaver , Ian Holm , John Hurt , Veronica Cartwright , Harry Dean Stanton , Tom Skerritt , Yaphet Kotto     Runtime    117 minutes    


While Ash turned out to be a killer android in Ridley Scott’s Alien, a Reddit fan theory suggested that Jones the cat may have also been a secret android in disguise. This theory adds new layers of meaning to Alien and hints that there could be plenty of secrets audiences have yet to uncover. In the Alien series, Xenomorphs have a tendency to kill all living things and tend to leave androids alone. Considering this, in Alien the Xenomorph does not kill or harm Jones. If this was the case, then the reasons for Jones signal a secret security measure, an information gathering protocol, or an unknown mysterious scheme.





 4  The Aliens Are Actually Demons 
Signs (2002)
        

  Signs  


  Release Date    August 2, 2002     Director    M. Night Shyamalan     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Mel Gibson , Cherry Jones , Rory Culkin , Abigail Breslin     Runtime    106 minutes    


A theory about M. Night Shyamalan’s Signs suggested that the movie’s antagonists aren’t aliens but in fact demons. This theory fits in well with Signs exploration of faith and religion and gives a much better explanation for the idea that a race of aliens could be taken down with glasses of water. The aliens being demons was an apt metaphor for the inner demons that the Signs characters are facing, and as such as manifested as physical demons. When the supposed aliens are eventually destroyed by water, the theory states it was holy water that they were weak too, due to the house in Signs being a priest’s home.





 3  Cooper’s Tesseract Fall Caused Every Anomaly 
Interstellar (2014)
        

  Interstellar  


  Release Date    November 7, 2014     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Anne Hathaway , Matthew McConaughey , Jessica Chastain , Ellen Burstyn , Michael Caine , Bill Irwin     Runtime    2h 49m    


Cooper&#39;s fall into the Tesseract in Interstellar establishes that he sent Murph the coordinates, but according to one theory, Cooper was also responsible for all the other anomalies that occurred at the start of the film. While it is known that Cooper was Murph’s ghost all along, the Tesseract’s five-dimensional structure meant he could affect the past, present, and future and the theory suggests when Cooper bounced off the walls he caused multiple events seen throughout the film like the book knocking off the shelf, the gravitational anomaly that attracted the drone, and the disrupted GPS and compasses.





 2  Donnie Darko Represents Jesus Christ 
Donnie Darko (2001)
        

  Donnie Darko  


  Release Date    October 26, 2001     Director    Richard Kelly     Cast    Jake Gyllenhaal , Holmes Osborne , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Daveigh Chase , Mary McDonnell , James Duval     Runtime    113 minutes    


While lots have been written about Donnie Darko being a biblical allegory, one Reddit theory suggests Donnie Darko was a Christ-like figure who sacrificed himself to save those around him. In this theory Frank the Bunny is God convincing Donnie to do everything he does, with bunnies acting as a symbol for Easter and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. This theory is just one of many Reddit fan theories about Donnie Darko which highlighted to intense potential for discussion and analysis in this cult favourite film.





 1  The Dinosaurs In Jurassic Park Are Fake 
Jurassic Park (1993)


 







  Jurassic Park  


  Release Date    June 11, 1993     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Richard Attenborough , Sam Neill , Laura Dern , Samuel L. Jackson , Jeff Goldblum     Runtime    127 minutes    


While Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park blew audiences away with its incredibly groundbreaking CGI, there are still those who weren’t taken away by the movie magic and are convinced the dinosaurs were fake. One fan theory suggests that the dinosaurs were not clones of dinosaur DNA but amalgamations made from different animals. This theory is supported by faulty science in Jurassic Park, such as finding DNA from mosquitos who drank dinosaur blood is practically impossible and modern science now states that dinosaurs likely had feathers and would look nothing like they do in Jurassic Park.
