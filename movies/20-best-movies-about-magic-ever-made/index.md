## Literature Review

From the charm of old Disney animated films to the thrills of Guillermo del Toro&#39;s work, these are the best movie about magic and illusion.




Magic comes in many forms and the best movies about magic explore them all. Magic, sorcery, and illusion pop up most often in fairy tales and family movies, but that&#39;s not necessarily always the case. Films broaching these subjects rarely indeed attain more than a PG-13 rating, but magic pertains to much more than just Mary Poppins. From the awe of Studio Ghibli productions to the sinister wonder of Pan&#39;s Labyrinth, magic is a broad concept that can open quite a few creative avenues. Whether they&#39;re set in a high-fantasy otherworld or a secretive castle in the near-modern day, something is amazing about movies featuring magic and illusion.
Magic has been a key component of storytelling since fiction first formed millennia ago, and the concepts of witches, wizards, spells, and sorcerers will likely appear in movies for the remainder of the medium&#39;s relevance. Be it Mickey Mouse charming a bunch of brooms or a bold quest to document the existence of the Blair Witch, magic crops up in many forms across just about every genre. While most immediately jump to the Harry Potter movies or Hocus Pocus, there&#39;s much more to magic than just those series, and many great movies of the current day include plenty of magical elements. Here are the best movies about magic.









 








 20  Now You See Me (2013) 
A Group Of Magicians Pull Off Heists


 







        


  Now You See Me  


  Release Date    May 31, 2013     Director    Louis Leterrier     Cast    Woody Harrelson , Mélanie Laurent , Jesse Eisenberg , Michael Caine , Dave Franco , Morgan Freeman , Common , Isla Fisher , Mark Ruffalo     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    115 minutes

Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson reunited after Zombieland to star in Now You See Me. This movie revolves around four magicians who call themselves the Four Horsemen and pull off elaborate heists in the hopes of getting into an order of “actual magicians” called The Eye. The film features many great sleight-of-hand tricks and blink-or-you’ll-miss-it moments.
The supporting cast features Mark Ruffalo as the FBI agent tracking the Robin Hood-inspired Four Horsemen along with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. While the performances aren&#39;t disagreeable and the magical elements inspired, the script is unintentionally silly at best. Now You See Me&#39;s ending is complex, but it is excellent popcorn entertainment, and it went on to inspire a franchise.





 19  Willow (1988) 
A Magical Journey By Ron Howard
        

        


  Willow  


  Release Date    May 20, 1988     Director    Ron Howard     Cast    Jean Marsh , Val Kilmer , Joanne Whalley , Patricia Hayes , Warwick Davis     Rating    PG     Runtime    126 minutes

Ron Howard’s Willow certainly has its merits and is one of the best movies about magic. The fantasy film stars Warwick Davis as a farmer named Willow who must babysit a child destined to defeat the evil Queen Bavmorda. On his journey, Willow masters his powers of sorcery, helped by broonies, fairies, and Val Kilmer as the swordsman Madmartigan.
The newly confident Willow defeats Bavmorda and learns that good triumphs over evil — because this is a fantasy film, after all. The movie was not well-received at the time, but it has since developed a cult following. With a score from James Horner and effects from ILM, it’s a match made in fantasy heaven. Thanks to its cult following, a Willow spinoff series aired on Disney&#43; with Warwick Davis reprising the role of the titular Willow.





 18  Practical Magic (1998) 
Two Sisters Seek Love Despite A Magical Curse
        

 Rent now on Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

\Though Nicole Kidman starred in a disappointing Bewitched adaptation by Nora Ephron, there was a time when she played a witch with Sandra Bullock in the rom-com Practical Magic. Based on the eponymous novel, Practical Magic is the story of two sisters with magical powers that come with a curse: any man who falls in love with them dies. There are plenty of spells and hexes to entertain the most hardened cynic, and, while the film isn’t a masterpiece by any stretch, it uses magical elements to successfully tell a potent and enjoyable love story.





 17  Lord of Illusions (1995) 
Directed By Horror Author Clive Barker
        

Stream now on Max
Clive Barker’s work varies from incredibly grotesque and horrific to mildly terrifying and still a little gross. His Hellraiser and Nightbreed rank among the best that the horror genre has to offer. One of his lesser-known adaptations is the 1995 movie Lord of Illusions. Scott Bakula played Barker’s iconic Harry D’Amour in the film, marking the character&#39;s first appearance on the silver screen. Barker wrote and directed the film, which is about a man who can use pure magic, called “The Puritan.” Detective D’Amour takes a case involving a murdered psychic and the film benefits from spectacular practical make-up and effects, and magic unique to Barker’s imagination.





 16  Hocus Pocus (1993) 
One Of The Most Iconic Witch Movies


 







        


  Hocus Pocus  


  Created by    David Kirschner , Mick Garris     First Film    Hocus Pocus     Cast    Bette Midler , Sarah Jessica Parker , Kathy Najimy , Omri Katz , Jason Marsden , Thora Birch , Vinessa Shaw , Whitney Peak , Belissa Escobedo , Lilia Buckingham

The Sanderson Sisters are some of the most beloved characters in Halloween-themed cinema, and the trio are the most memorable characters in one of the best movies about magic. Played by the talented Sarah Jessica Parker, Bette Milder, and Kathy Najimy, the witches have one goal: to be young and pretty again. Hocus Pocus is a great Halloween movie for kids of all ages.
Filled to the brim with extravagant costumes, silly spells, and buck teeth, it’s hard not to smile while watching the film. The performances are perfectly campy, though they work better for those with a bit of nostalgia. Fans of Sabrina the Teenage Witch or Halloweentown won’t be disappointed. Viewers are also treated to Bette Milder performing “I Put a Spell on You” as a bonus. The film spawned a sequel nearly 20 years later in which the Sanderson sisters reprised their respective roles.





 15  Stardust (2007) 
Based On The Story By Neil Gaiman
        

        


  Stardust (2007)  


  Release Date    August 10, 2007     Director    Matthew Vaughn     Cast    Claire Danes , Charlie Cox , Sienna Miller , Ricky Gervais , Jason Flemyng , Rupert Everett , Peter O&#39;Toole , Michelle Pfeiffer , Robert De Niro     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    128 Minutes

Stardust is a film about a trio of witches who want to remain beautiful. In Matthew Vaughn’s adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s novel, there&#39;s also a pirate (Robert de Niro), unicorns, and a star personified as a woman (Claire Danes). The story involves a man named Tristan Thorn who falls in love with the star and becomes the master of his destiny. Stardust’s supporting cast is spectacular and includes Michelle Pfieffer, Mark Strong, Peter O’Toole, Ricky Gervais, Ian McKellen, and Henry Cavill. The magic on display by Gaiman is colorful and imaginative with strong world-building and cute characters. It’s largely unfocused, but, for a family-friendly magical experience, Stardust is ideal.





 14  The Craft (1996) 
A Teen Coming-Of-Age Magic Movie


 







        


  The Craft  


  Release Date    May 3, 1996     Director    Andrew Fleming     Cast    Neve Campbell , Fairuza Balk , Robin Tunney , Rachel True     Rating    R     Runtime    101 Minutes    


 Stream now on Paramount&#43; 

One of the most popular movies about witches since the 80s, The Craft is notable for its realistic portrayal of the consequences of spell-casting. While any decidedly un-sinister movie about witches makes room for a morality tale, The Craft is not afraid of getting dark and staying there. Following the story of four intelligent high school girls with incredible powers, The Craft features curses, spells, and more than one murder. This teenage coven is not to be messed with. The Craft is an absolute blast with fun performances and effects and a killer soundtrack to boot. It was a huge success, grossing $55 million off of a budget of $15 million.





 13  The Witch (2015) 
One Of The Most Disturbing Movies About Magic
        

        


  The Witch  


  Release Date    February 19, 2016     Director    Robert Eggers     Cast    Kate Dickie , Wahab Chaudhry , Ellie Grainger , Ralph Ineson , Sarah Stephens , Lucas Dawson , Anya Taylor-Joy , Bathsheba Garnett , Harvey Scrimshaw , Julian Richings     Rating    R     Runtime    92minutes    


Stream now on Max
Heralded by horror fans as a modern-day classic, 2015&#39;s The Witch, the directorial debut of Robert Eggers, features a decidedly dark take on magic and witchcraft. Seen through the lens of a fanatically religious seventeenth-century family, magic in The Witch is presented as an omen of death and horror. Much of the film asks viewers to question if the events taking place are genuine or the byproducts of religious zealotry, but the final segment makes it clear that the film&#39;s occult occurrences were very real. It&#39;s far removed from the cozy depiction of magic seen in most films and is one of the best movies about witches.





 12  The Illusionist (2006) 
Starring Edward Norton &amp; Jessica Biel
        

 Stream now on Peacock&#43; 

Starring Edward Norton and Jessica Biel, The Illusionist is set in nineteenth-century Vienna, and the film tells the story of the illusionist Eisenheim and how he will go to be with his true love, Sophie. Because Sophie is a duchess and Eisenheim a peasant, their love is forbidden, and Sophie is set to marry the despicable Prince Leopold. The lovers hatch a plan to use the powers of illusion to free Sophie from her arranged engagement and the city of Vienna of Leopold’s reign. The Illusionist features excellent scenes of magic that range from typical stage acts to summoning dead spirits.





 11  Labyrinth (1986) 
David Bowie Stars As The Goblin King


 







        


  Labyrinth  


  Release Date    June 27, 1986     Director    Jim Henson     Cast    Christopher Malcolm , Toby Froud , Shelley Thompson , Jennifer Connelly , David Bowie     Rating    PG     Runtime    101 minutes    


 Stream now on Atom 

An undeniable fantasy classic, Labyrinth combines the best that the 1980s had to offer and is definitively one of the best movies about magic. Between musician David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, fantastical puppets from Jim Henson Creature Shop, and beautiful sets, the film is a sight to behold. Hoggle and Sir Didymus are both incredibly memorable and entirely practical puppets. The only human actors in the fantasy world are Bowie and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah. The story, which follows Sarah on a coming-of-age quest to rescue her infant brother Toby from the evil Goblin King that captured him, is filled with magical beasts and wears its heart on its sleeve.





 10  Pan&#39;s Labyrinth (2006) 
Guillermo Del Toro&#39;s Masterpiece
        

        


  Pan&#39;s Labyrinth  


  Release Date    January 19, 2007     Director    Guillermo del Toro     Cast    Sergi López , Doug Jones , Ivana Baquero , Ariadna Gil , Maribel Verdú     Rating    R     Runtime    118 minutes    


 Rent now on Apple TV &amp; Prime Video 

A 2006 Spanish-language dark fantasy film directed by Guillermo del Toro, Pan&#39;s Labyrinth contorts typical magic tropes into something uniquely macabre, resulting in one of the best movies about magic. Taking place during the Spanish Civil War of the 1940s, it tells the tale of a young girl who is tasked by magical creatures with completing three challenges to claim her place as a ruler of the Underworld. Often compared to The Chronicles of Narnia, Pan&#39;s Labyrinth explores the corrupting influence of war and hatred on the pure-hearted, and, unlike many films boasting distinct fairy tale aesthetics, the film opts for an ending that&#39;s simultaneously beautiful and melancholic.





 9  Spirited Away (2001) 
Hayao Miyazaki’s Magical Masterpiece
        

        


  Spirited Away  


  Release Date    July 20, 2001     Director    Hayao Miyazaki     Cast    Rumi Hîragi , Daveigh Chase , Miyu Irino , Jason Marsden , Aoi Nakamura , Bob Bergen     Runtime    125 Mins

One of the best movies about magic is the award-winning animated fantasy film Spirited Away. Hayao Miyazaki’s movie is the tale of Chihiro, a young girl trapped in the spirit world. After her parents are transformed into pigs by the witch Yubaba, Chihiro must work in her bathhouse to free her family and return to the human realm. In Japan, it became the highest-grossing movie of all time, beating Titanic, and it later won the Best Animated Feature Oscar. Chihiro’s liminal journey through the spirit world is populated by shikigami (ghosts), dragons, witches, and No-Face, a creature that eats people. The film is truly a magical work of art and one of Studio Ghibli’s best.





 8  Harry Potter And The Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) 
When Harry Potter Movies Grew Up


 







        


  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  


  Release Date    May 31, 2004     Director    Alfonso Cuarón     Cast    Gary Oldman , David Thewlis , Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , Rupert Grint , Robbie Coltrane , Timothy Spall , Maggie Smith , Michael Gambon , Richard Griffiths , Fiona Shaw , Alan Rickman     Rating    pg-13     Runtime    144 Minutes

The only Harry Potter film not to feature Lord Voldemort is oft-considered the strongest. By director Alfonso Cuarón, Prisoner of Azkaban truly raises the stakes for the characters, crafting a much darker world than before. The Dementors and their deadly kiss, the noble giant Hippogriff, and a professor with a full-moon problem expand on Rowling’s already huge magical mythology. The casting of Gary Oldman as Sirius Black was an excellent decision, and the young Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint all see steady improvements in their performances.





 7  The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice (1940) 
Part Of Disney&#39;s Movie Fantasia
        

Stream now on Disney&#43;
Conceived in 1937 and debuted in 1940 as part of Disney&#39;s orchestral epic Fantasia, The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice stars Mickey Mouse as the hapless helper of a mysterious wizard in one of the best movies about magic. When his master is away, Mickey attempts to replicate one of his spells to help with his chores, but things quickly grow out of hand. Easily one of the character&#39;s most iconic appearances, The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice is a timeless classic that showcases the majesty and potential malignity of magical powers, while also showcasing Disney&#39;s astounding feats in animation at the time.





 6  The Prestige (2006) 
Christian Bale &amp; Hugh Jackman In A Magical Tale Of Revenge
        

        


  The Prestige  


  Release Date    October 20, 2006     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Michael Caine , Christian Bale , Hugh Jackman , Scarlett Johansson , Piper Perabo     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    130 minutes    


 Stream now on Paramount&#43; 

Though the film features no real magic at all, The Prestige is far and away the most awe-inspiring film about the craft. Christopher Nolan followed up Batman Begins by collaborating with Christian Bale once again in this 2006 film. The Prestige tells the story of rival magicians and their quest to pull off the greatest trick. Starring Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Michael Caine, while featuring David Bowie, there are truly dramatic and highly intelligent moments in the film. The twists and turns of the narrative are some of Nolan’s greatest, and the many scenes of magic with sleight-of-hand and escape artistry rank far above most films with magicians.





 5  The NeverEnding Story (1984) 
The Iconic Family Movie From The 1980s


 







        


  The Neverending Story  


  Release Date    July 20, 1984     Director    Wolfgang Petersen     Cast    Patricia Hayes , Noah Hathaway , Barret Oliver , Sydney Bromley , Gerald McRaney , Tami Stronach     Rating    PG     Runtime    94 minutes    


The NeverEnding Story wormed its way back into public consciousness after Suzie&#39;s NeverEnding Story theme song request in Stranger Things. In director Wolfgang Peterson&#39;s first English-language film, a young bullied boy named Bastian steals a mysterious book from bookseller Mr. Coreander titled The NeverEnding Story, and the novel is much more than it seems. It tells the tale of a mythical land called Fantasia that is being slowly consumed by The Nothing.
The child Empress has fallen ill and the child warrior Atreyu is tasked with finding a cure using a medallion called the Auryn to assist in his quest. The NeverEnding Story is full of incredible creatures and became a beloved kids&#39; adventure story of the &#39;80s. Based on the eponymous novel by Michael Ende, it won multiple awards and turned into an entire film series.





 4  The Dark Crystal (1982) 
A Dark Jim Henson Magical Production
        

        


  The Dark Crystal  


  Release Date    December 17, 1982     Director    Jim Henson     Cast    Jim Henson , Frank Oz , Dave Goelz     Rating    10&#43;     Runtime    93minutes    


 Rent now on Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

Jim Henson is one of the greatest creative forces of the 20th century and his film The Dark Crystal is one of the best movies about magic. Drawing away from his typical happy-go-lucky muppets, Dark Crystal is a much darker fantasy film than Henson&#39;s previous family-friendly entries. The animatronics used in the movie were considered groundbreaking technology for the time, and fantasy illustrator Brian Froud used his work with Henson in this film to grease the wheels for Labyrinth. The Dark Crystal turned out to be such a classic that a prequel series was made for Netflix in 2019 and won an Emmy.
The Dark Crystal has deep lore surrounding the story, but the basics see a young Gelfling named Jen who is tasked with a large quest. Jen is burdened with healing a long-shattered crystal to fulfill a prophecy that will see order to their homeland restored after the evil Skeksis race has wreaked havoc. Jen goes on a long winding journey full of extraordinary creatures and spell-binding magic. While it received mixed reviews upon its release, The Dark Crystal amassed a large cult following and the film has spawned the aforementioned TV series, books, and comics.





 3  Sleight (2016) 
An Indie Magical Movie
        

        


 Sleight 


  Release Date    April 28, 2017     Director    J.D. Dillard     Cast    Cameron Esposito , Dule Hill , Frank Clem , Brandon Johnson , Seychelle Gabriel , Jay Walker , Michael Villar , Storm Reid , Andrew Fitzpatrick , Jacob Latimore , Sasheer Zamata    


Stream now on Netflix
Slight is quite a unique entry into the action-drama genre and sees a young Storm Reid shortly before rocketing to fame thanks to Euphoria. It was able to amass $4 million at the box office against a $250,000 budget. The magical mystery film saw positive reviews from critics and premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. With a medium-sized cast and a wholly original story, Sleight may be the magical movie genre&#39;s best-kept secret.
Sleight follows street magician Bo (Jacob Latimore), who moonlights selling drugs at night after he is tasked with taking care of his younger sister Tina (Storm Reid) due to the untimely death of their parents. Using magnets, Bo can perform a trick where he can make anything float in midair. Things get hairy for Bo when a drug kingpin moves in on his turf and soon finds himself in over his head when Tina is kidnapped. Sleight successfully subverts its genre, resulting in a film that is truly one of a kind.





 2  The Witches Of Eastwick (1987) 
Starring Cher, Susan Sarandon, and Michelle Pfeiffer As A Witch Coven
        

 Rent now on Apple TV &amp; Prime Video 

The Witches of Eastwick features an outstanding cast, starring Cher, Susan Sarandon, Michelle Pfieffer, and Jack Nicholson in the main roles. Based on John Updike&#39;s novel of the same name, The Witches of Eastwick is a dark fantasy-comedy that, despite never attaining outright love from critics, was nominated for two Academy Awards and won a BAFTA for Best Special Effects.
The Witches of Eastwick see three unsatisfied and unhappy women — Alex (Cher), Jane (Sarandon), and Sukie (Pfieffer) — begin meeting together once a week to discuss their ideal men. What they don&#39;t know is that they&#39;re witches who have unwittingly formed a coven. When the mysterious and affluent Daryl Van Horne (Nicholson) rolls into town, he quickly fulfills the separate women&#39;s desires, but it turns out he&#39;s harboring a dark and terrifying secret of his own.





 1  Suspiria (2018)

  Suspiria

Stream now on Prime Video
Based on Dario Argento&#39;s famous Italian horror flick, the Suspiria reboot is one of the best movies about magic. With creeping suspense and stunning visuals, Suspiria explores the darker side of magic as it revels in gore and gruesome displays of horror. Suspiria follows young American dancer Susie (Dakota Johnson) who was raised in a Mennonite family and attends the Markos Dance Academy in West Berlin. However, the Academy is in a state of panic after student Patricia goes missing when she tells her therapist that the Academy is a coven of witches.
Susie quickly rises up the ranks as a talented dancer, becoming the scrupulous Madame Blanc&#39;s star protégé and lead of the company&#39;s next production, Volk. However, a sinister ritual is soon at hand and the ending of Suspiria features a twist that needs to be seen to be believed. The reboot is what kicked off Mia Goth&#39;s career in the horror genre, and the reboot was praised for its arthouse horror aesthetics and reinterpretation of witchcraft as a whole.
