## Literature Review

While final girls are common in horror movies, final boys are much more rare, but several examples prove it should be a more common thing in horror.




Final girls in horror movies are a trope of the genre, but the much less common final boy has proven to be an equally interesting concept that deserves more attention. Horror movies are full of tropes, with jump scares, thunder and lightning at night, and characters separating to look for trouble, but changing the tropes sometimes leads to fascinating stories. The final girl trope is a time-honored tradition, and it has led to some of the most iconic characters in cinema, like Laurie Strode in the Halloween films and Sidney Prescott in Scream.
Horror movies often leave just a few survivors to tell the story or open up a way to more sequels. Many franchises then build on these primary characters and their ongoing relationships with the killers to build more depth and tension in the following stories. Characters like Ash from The Evil Dead franchise and Cole in The Babysitter movies then go on to play a protagonist who often takes on a heroic role in fighting back the forces of evil and helping others to avoid potentially brutal fates at the hands of terrible villains.









 








 8  Ash Williams 
The Evil Dead (1981)


 







Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi formed an ongoing relationship when they created the first The Evil Dead movie back in 1981. With Campbell&#39;s Ash Williams facing off against the evil Deadites that possess the living and cause havoc everywhere, the franchise went from strength to strength with its intense and exaggerated horror and gore. Ash has appeared in every movie directed by Raimi and also the spin-off series, Ash vs. Evil Dead. Campbell is perfect as the leading man and a great example of what a final boy can be in horror.





 7  Jesse Walsh 
A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy&#39;s Revenge (1985)
        

Mark Patton plays Jesse Walsh in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy&#39;s Revenge and the supernatural slasher is packed with terrifying moments culminating in a final battle of the wills between Jesse and Freddy. In the movie, Freddy starts to come through the nightmare world and into reality by taking over Jesse&#39;s body, and at first, Jesse struggles to stop him, but when Lisa confesses her love for him, he manages to overcome Krueger&#39;s power and break free of the nightmares. Jesse appeared to be losing himself to the demon, but thanks to his accompanying final girl, he overcame him to become a final boy.

 6  Sam &amp; Michael Emerson

Sam and Michael struggle to fit in, especially after moving to the odd city of Santa Carla, California in The Lost Boys. Throughout the movie, they become intimately familiar with the dangerous secrets that plague the town and its residents as they meet the vampires that run the place. Michael displays his desperation to fit in by undergoing challenges put in place by the vampires and, eventually, he undergoes a transformation that guarantees his eternal fate as one of the undead. Fortunately, grandpa jumps in to save the day and manages to kill the head vampire, returning Michael to normal and leaving him and his brother as the surviving final boys.





 5  Alex Browning 
Final Destination (2000)
        

Alex is the central character in the first Final Destination movie where he and a group of friends cheat death and face the consequences. The group tries to evade death as it rears its ugly head and takes each of them one by one, but almost none of them survive, except for Alex and Clear. Alex, Clear, and Carter even appeared safe from the curse and celebrated six months after the horrific incidents that killed their peers, only to have Carter save Alex from another tragic incident, losing his life in the process. Alex does not survive into later movies, but he made it through the first movie at least.





 4  Jim 
28 Days Later (2002)


 







Cillian Murphy stars in the British horror film, 28 Days Later, as Jim, a bicycle courier who wakes up 28 days after a viral outbreak sends the world into a violent rage. While Jim manages to survive as the final boy along with Hannah and Selena in the theatrical release of the film, the movie has three alternative endings where Jim is killed in 28 Days Later. Fortunately, he survived and became one of the most iconic final boys in the genre thanks to the spectacular performance by Murphy.





 3  Shaun 
Shaun Of The Dead (2004)
        

Edgar Wright&#39;s first installment in the Cornetto trilogy, Shaun of the Dead, is a hilarious horror comedy that sees Shaun (Simon Pegg) wake up after an awful hangover to find the world overrun by zombies. Shaun manages to rally together a small group of local survivors to fight back the impending zombie invasion, and miraculously, along with ex-girlfriend Liz, Shaun manages to survive until help arrives in the form of the British Army. The final scene, which reveals his now zombified best friend Ed (Nick Frost) chained up in the shed and playing video games, is hilarious and a last hurrah for the final boy of the film.

 2  Chris Washington 
Get Out (2017)


 







Jordan Peele&#39;s directorial debut also happens to be one of his very best movies with the terrifyingly brilliant Get Out. Daniel Kaluuya stars as Chris, a photographer who goes to visit his white girlfriend&#39;s family for the first time. While there, he picks up on several odd things that are brushed off as ignorant racism, but things get a lot more sinister when the whole truth is revealed. Chris manages to escape the home and the people who threatened to make him their latest experiment just in time, becoming one of the most iconic final boys of all time.





 1  Cole 
The Babysitter (2017)
        

Another horror comedy, The Babysitter is focused on telling Cole&#39;s (Judah Lewis) story of a night when his babysitter, Bee (Samara Weaving), and her occultist friends attempt to use him as a sacrifice to make a deal with a demon. The movie sees the young pre-teen, Cole, fight off a group of high schoolers with a series of traps that resemble those in Home Alone, but far more brutal. Cole manages to take down his attackers one by one during one terrifying night and comes out the other side as the final boy who earned his survival.
