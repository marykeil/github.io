## Literature Review

This hilarious Star Wars video shows Anakin and Obi-Wan&#39;s friendship and how they could have fun anywhere, even during the Battle of Coruscant.




A Star Wars video has gotten traction on social media for hilariously showing what Anakin Skywalker&#39;s and Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s entrance to the Battle of Coruscant in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith would have looked like. Obi-Wan was Anakin&#39;s former master at the time, but the two had a friendly relationship the video brilliantly showcases. After years of fighting together, the pair had a chemistry that allowed them to have fun in even the most serious of situations, even the Battle of Coruscant.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   

The video, posted by Nude Gunray, highlights how Anakin and Obi-Wan should have brought a bit more seriousness to one of the most important battles of the Clone Wars and one of the most pivotal moments in any Star Wars movie in the timeline.


 

The video features two men rollerskating together, highlighting the jokes and antics Anakin and Obi-Wan got up to during the battle. Even in the face of extreme danger and high stakes, the two always had time to play around. The video shows the special relationship they had, something that could be shown more in a potential Obi-Wan Kenobi season 2.





 Anakin &amp; Obi-Wan&#39;s Pride Came Before A Fall 
          

During the Battle of Coruscant, Anakin and Obi-Wan were on top of the world. Even though the Separatists had invaded Coruscant and the Clone Wars were dragging on, they had secured numerous victories and never lost hope. Even with Chancellor Palpatine in Count Dooku&#39;s custody, they both thought that they could take on anything. The odds were certainly stacked against them, but rather than approaching the situation with an appropriate amount of seriousness, they viewed it as a prime opportunity to take down both Dooku and General Grievous.

Their confidence would prove to be their undoing, though, as the Battle of Coruscant proved to be a trap set by Palpatine. The two sensed this coming, but confidently decided to spring the trap anyway, believing they could handle anything Dooku threw at them. This pride is what allowed Palpatine the chance to have Anakin kill Dooku, his first step on the path to the dark side. If Obi-Wan and Anakin weren&#39;t as good friends, the situation might have played out in a very different way.




The video humorously shows how close Anakin and Obi-Wan were in the final days of the Clone Wars and how lightly they took even the most dire of situations. The two had one of the closest friendships in all of Star Wars, and the video shows how well they worked together because of it. Their friendship made them overly confident, though, and was one of many reasons Anakin became Darth Vader in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith.

              Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith  Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith is the sixth film in the Star Wars franchise and chronologically the third in the Skywalker Saga. Set three years after the events of Attack of the Clones, Anakin Skywalker is tasked with keeping an eye on Chancellor Palpatine while other Jedi battle across the galaxy. In the background, however, a mysterious Sith lord begins to make their move to destroy the Jedi once and for all.
