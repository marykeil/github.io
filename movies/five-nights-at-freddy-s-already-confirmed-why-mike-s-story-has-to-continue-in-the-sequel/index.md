## SUMMARY 



  Mike Schmidt&#39;s return is pivotal in the sequel to Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, despite not playing a role in the video game.   The film franchise has aligned somewhat with the game&#39;s plot, but there are changes that require the story to shift in the sequel.

## Literature Review

Though the Five Nights at Freddyâ€™s video game does not include Mike Schmidt, the second movie must bring Mike back because of this unfinished story.




When it comes to Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, it is pivotal that the first movie&#39;s protagonist, Josh Hutcherson&#39;s Mike Schmidt returns in the second movie, despite the fact that, in the video game, he does not play a role at all. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is a video game franchise that first began in 2014 and has since spawned approximately 20 sequels and spinoff games. In 2023, the franchise was adapted into a feature film of the same name, and a sequel may be in the works. The story follows the haunted happenings at an abandoned pizzeria called Freddy Fazbear&#39;s, wherein the animatronics come to life and commit murderous acts.




So far, the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s film franchise has been somewhat aligned with the plot of the video game. The film followed Mike Schmidt, a young man who begins working as the night security guard at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizzeria. Furthermore, Mike must figure out what is going on with the animatronics, and essentially, survive the night. However, there are some aspects of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s that diverge from the game, and one such change is a big reason why Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2&#39;s story must change as well.


 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Teased There Is More To Garrett&#39;s Story 
          

One of the big mysteries that is apparent in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is the disappearance of Mike&#39;s younger brother, Garrett. Throughout the movie, Mike consistently searches his memory for any hints as to what happened to his brother. The day he disappeared, Mike was supposed to be watching Garrett at their campsite, however, the last time he saw his brother was through a window of a car as he was being kidnapped. Therefore, Mike spends much of the movie trying to discover what happened, and even when he gets some answers, they aren&#39;t quite enough.




In Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, Mike discovers that William Afton killed a series of children at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s and put their bodies in the animatronic suits, causing them to become haunted by the childrens&#39; spirits. He also discovers that Afton was the one that kidnapped Garrett all those years ago. However, Mike never finds out what happened to Garrett or why Afton did it. Garrett is not one of the children in the animatronics, and therefore, his fate is virtually unknown. In this way, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s hints that Mike&#39;s search for his brother is not over quite yet.



 Garrett&#39;s Story Continuing In Five Night At Freddy&#39;s 2 Means Mike Must Return 
          

Since Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s did not wrap up Garrett&#39;s story, then that means it needs to continue into Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2, and that means that Mike needs to return. As much as audiences are curious about what happened to Garrett, the person that needs to know the most is Mike. In this way, Mike needs to return to Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, even though that goes against the video game&#39;s storyline, so that he can figure out what exactly happened to his brother. This will be a more satisfying ending for both Mike and viewers of the first movie.
