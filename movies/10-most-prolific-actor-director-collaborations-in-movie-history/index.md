## Literature Review

From Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese to John Wayne and John Ford, these are the most prolific actor/director collaborators of all time.




It&#39;s common for directors to collaborate with the same actors frequently, and specific pairings have distinguished themselves as prolific in the film industry. 2023 saw several long-time collaborators find success with new releases. Director Todd Haynes brought a fantastic performance out of Julianne Moore in May December. Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy joined forces for their sixth film together, with the actor playing the starring role for the first time. Martin Scorsese worked with two long-time collaborators on Killers of the Flower Moon, uniting Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro for the first time in decades.
Directors and actors return to each other, not only out of comfort for a safe work environment but because they know how to bring great work out of each other. Samuel L. Jackson has been in dozens of iconic films, but the roles he&#39;s shined the most in have been those written by Quentin Tarantino. Some of the most prolific actor/director duos have set gold standards for entire genres, such as the classical Western, samurai films, and mafia crime movies. These collaborators have changed the cinematic landscape with their continuous work, partnering for some of the best movies of all time.









 








 10  Cillian Murphy &amp; Christopher Nolan 
Six films between 2005 and 2023.


 







  Film   Year    Batman Begins   2005    The Dark Knight   2008    Inception   2010    The Dark Knight Rises   2012    Dunkirk   2017    Oppenheimer   2023    
Of course, Cillian Murphy and Christopher Nolan&#39;s most prolific collaboration is 2023&#39;s Oppenheimer, which has brought the star actor a Golden Globe Award and serious Oscar buzz. The historical epic was the sixth film from the actor/director duo and the first in which Murphy starred. Cillian Murphy famously auditioned for Batman in Nolan&#39;s The Dark Knight trilogy, and while he wasn&#39;t suitable for the part, Nolan cast him as Scarecrow, a role he reprised twice. Murphy also joined Nolan&#39;s ensemble cast in Inception and Dunkirk. Given Christopher Nolan&#39;s mass commercial popularity, his collaborations with Cillian Murphy are prolific and influential on modern filmmaking.





 9  Bill Murray &amp; Wes Anderson 
Nine films between 1998 and 2021.
        

  Film   Year    Rushmore   1998    The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou   2004    Fantastic Mr. Fox   2009    Moonrise Kingdom   2012    Isle of Dogs   2018    
Like with Murphy and Nolan, Wes Anderson has primarily cast Bill Murray in supporting roles in his films. He&#39;s a main character in classics like Rushmore, Moonrise Kingdom, and The Life Aquatic, where Murray&#39;s deadpan humor perfectly contrasts Wes Anderson&#39;s vibrant aesthetic. Murray is best known for his comedic roles, but in the 21st century, he&#39;s relied primarily on working with frequent collaborators like Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Jim Jarmusch, who continuously bring special performances out of him.





 8  James Stewart &amp; Alfred Hitchcock 
Four films between 1948 and 1958.
        

  Film   Year    Rope   1948    Rear Window   1954    The Man Who Knew Too Much   1956    Vertigo   1958    
Though most widely recognized for starring in It&#39;s a Wonderful Life, James Stewart had a phenomenal career in Westerns, gangster movies, and, of course, the films of Alfred Hitchcock. While audiences recognized James Stewart for his everyman persona, Hitchcock brought something else out of him, and their collaborations had a lasting impact on the crime/thriller genre. Over the span of a decade, Hitchcock and Stewart worked together on Rope, Rear Window, The Man Who Knew Too Much, and Vertigo, some of which are considered some of the greatest crime movies ever made.





 7  Tom Hanks &amp; Steven Spielberg 
Five films between 1998 and 2017.

Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are two of the most beloved names in Hollywood, which adds weight to their collaborations. While the two have only made five films together, the list includes Saving Private Ryan, one of the best war movies of all time, and classics like Catch Me If You Can. Hanks and Spielberg&#39;s partnership has extended beyond their actor/director relationship, as the pair have co-produced the HBO series Brand of Brothers and The Pacific.

With three Academy Awards for Best Actress, Frances McDormand is one of the most impactful and celebrated actresses ever, and her most well-known roles are in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen. The 66-year-old actress has appeared in nine of their films, including &#39;80s classics Blood Simple and Raising Arizona, which helped launch her career. The 1996 crime thriller Fargo is their best collaboration, winning the actress her first Academy Award.





 5  Samuel L. Jackson &amp; Quentin Tarantino 
Six films between 1994 and 2016.
        

  Film   Year    Pulp Fiction   1994    Jackie Brown   1997    Django Unchained   2012    The Hateful Eight   2016    
From Star Wars to the MCU to Goodfellas, Samuel L. Jackson has left his mark all over modern cinema, and his best work has been in the films of Quentin Tarantino. Most notably, Jackson played Jules Winnfield in Pulp Fiction, earning him the only Academy Award nomination in his career. He&#39;s also had significant roles in Jackie Brown, Django Unchained, The Hateful Eight, and made minor contributions to Kill Bill: Volume 2 and Inglourious Basterds. Samuel L. Jackson is one of the most entertaining actors ever, and Tarantino&#39;s dialogue brings him to another level.

Leonardo DiCaprio has built a career working with accomplished directors like Baz Luhrmann, Quentin Tarantino, and the great Martin Scorsese. Beginning in 2002 with Gangs of New York, DiCaprio helped Scorsese venture into 21st-century filmmaking, starring in some of the director&#39;s most significant commercial hits. The two have collaborated on films in different genres, from The Departed, which finally earned Scorsese an Academy Award for Best Director, to The Wolf of Wall Street, one of Scorsese&#39;s most extravagant and commercially appealing movies, to Killers of the Flower Moon, one of the best drama movies of 2023.

Akira Kurosawa is one of the best directors of all time, best known for samurai films like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, and The Hidden Fortress. Each of these classic movies starred Toshiro Mifune, an actor who&#39;s become synonymous with the Jidaigeki genre. Their collaborations have influenced films for decades, including iconic American Westerns, Star Wars, and recent films like The Last Duel and Rebel Moon. But beyond those samurai masterpieces, Mifune and Kurosawa worked together on contemporary films like High and Low, showcasing an impressive range.

The two had an unbelievable run of 18 films, among which movies like Rio Bravo, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, and The Searchers are all considered some of the best Westerns ever made.
