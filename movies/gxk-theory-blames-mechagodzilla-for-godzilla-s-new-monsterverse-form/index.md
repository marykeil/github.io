# GxK Theory Blames Mechagodzilla For Godzilla s New Monsterverse Form


## SUMMARY 



  Godzilla&#39;s new pink atomic power in Godzilla x Kong indicates a greater level of power and potential unbeatability.   Godzilla&#39;s transformation is likely a response to his defeat by Mechagodzilla and a need to maintain his authority and balance on Earth.   Godzilla&#39;s new form, with sharper dorsal plates and increased agility, suggests that he may be the most powerful form he has ever assumed in the Monsterverse.

## Literature Review



Godzilla will undergo a transformation before the events of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and his battle against Mechagodzilla at the end of Godzilla vs. Kong may be the cause. The Godzilla x Kong trailer shows the Alpha Titan sporting a brand-new look, which appears to be the result of some sort of evolution that the radioactive lizard undergoes. It seems unlikely that Godzilla&#39;s transformation is coincidental, and the reason for his evolution will surely be a major element in the setup for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.




When Godzilla was last seen in the Monsterverse&#39;s current timeline, he had just been beaten to the brink of death by Mechagodzilla. In fact, it took an assist from Kong and his powered-up axe for Godzilla to even survive the encounter. That could point to why Godzilla needed to power up once again before teaming up with Kong again to take on their new ape foe, Skar King and whatever Titans he has under his control. Godzilla&#39;s new form may be the most powerful that he&#39;s ever assumed in the Monsterverse, and Mechagodzilla could be the reason it exists.

 Why Godzilla Has A New Look In Godzilla X Kong 
Godzilla&#39;s radioactive blue glow has changed to pink.
   Close     

Godzilla&#39;s atomic power is pink in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and as the trailer shows, the new color will lead to a greater level of power. In addition to the new color, Godzilla&#39;s dorsal plates look sharper and more numerous, and he will be somewhat slimmer than he has been in the Monsterverse. Big G&#39;s slimmer, sharper appearance also leads to elevated agility; while Godzilla has run at opponents in a lumbering fashion before, he has never sprinted at a speed that matches Kong like he does in the new Godzilla x Kong trailer.




The color change of Godzilla&#39;s internal power source indicates that in the course of his transformation, Godzilla&#39;s very internal chemistry changed. He is an evolved form of the creature that fought with Kong against Mechagodzilla at the end of Godzilla x Kong. As the strongest Titan on Earth, the notion of Godzilla becoming even stronger is hard to fathom, but his battle against his robotic archenemy may be the key to Godzilla unlocking nearly unlimited power.



 Mechagodzilla Could Explain Why Godzilla Transforms 
Godzilla&#39;s robotic enemy could be the cause for Godzilla&#39;s new evolution.
          

As the Alpha Titan, Godzilla is responsible for maintaining balance on the planet. In order to properly maintain balance, Godzilla&#39;s authority needs to remain unchallenged. His battle against Mechagodzilla proved that he can be beaten, which could have devastating repercussions for the world at large. To be fair to the King of Monsters, he had just finished a grueling battle against Kong when Mechagodzilla attacked. That may not matter to Godzilla, and his evolution may very well be a response to his loss to Mechagodzilla.




The Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire trailer even hinted at the voluntary nature of Godzilla&#39;s transformation. A brief image of Godzilla encased in some form of crystal cocoon was revealed, which could indicate that Godzilla chose to undergo the change, as the crystal structure is fairly reminiscent of the cocoon that the MUTOs grew in. Following his battle with Mechagodzilla, Godzilla could have chosen to enter a regenerative state that not only healed the injuries he sustained but to elevate his power levels to a previously unseen intensity.



 What Godzilla&#39;s New Form Means For His Power Level 
The Alpha Titan may soon become unbeatable.
          

Considering Godzilla&#39;s strongest attacks, like his atomic breath and nuclear pulse, are devastating to Titans of all shapes and sizes, powering up yet again may make him unbeatable. Since 2014&#39;s Godzilla, his atomic breath has evolved from a billowing blast of cold blue fire into a laser-like supercharged beam. As of the events of Godzilla vs. Kong, Godzilla&#39;s internal atomic power was strong enough for him to blast his atomic breath through the crust of the planet into the Hollow Earth. If Godzilla&#39;s latest transformation makes him even stronger, it&#39;s going to be difficult for any Titan to beat him one-on-one.




Past versions of Godzilla have shown how a change in color equates to a nigh-unstoppable power level. Godzilla&#39;s power level was similarly elevated in Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla II when a dying Rodan gives Godzilla his life essence. Godzilla&#39;s blue atomic breath changes into a vibrant orange, which makes it strong enough for him to completely destroy Mechagodzilla. If his new pink powers help him elevate his strength again in the Monsterverse, then Godzilla may become all but unstoppable by the end of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.
