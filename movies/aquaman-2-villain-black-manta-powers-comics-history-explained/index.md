## Literature Review

Black Manta returns as the main Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom villain, and the two arch-rivals have a long history throughout DC Comics.




Black Manta, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, is the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom villain, with a long and storied history in the comics and DCEU. While the aquatic villain was a side antagonist in the previous film, he is the central threat in the sequel and is more powerful and intimidating than before. Black Manta and Aquaman have a brief history within the DCEU, but their connection in the comics goes back many decades. The villain is a common enemy of Aquaman, who has fought the hero dozens of times throughout the comic book character&#39;s history and continues as Arthurâ€™s bitter rival by the time of Aquaman 2&#39;s climactic ending.




In 2018&#39;s Aquaman, Black Manta introduced himself as a menacing archrival to Arthur Curry. While he does not possess Aquaman&#39;s ability to communicate with the aquatic world, he was still a solid match for Curry despite being ultimately defeated. Both Black Manta and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II returned for vengeance in Aquaman 2&#39;s cast of characters, possessing a powerful weapon from the comics that made him one of Curry&#39;s most formidable opponents yet. Here is everything to know about Black Manta, the villain of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

                  Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom Post-Credits Scene Explained   We discuss whether Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has a credits scene and explain what it means, how it concludes the DCEU and sets up the DCU.   


 Black Manta&#39;s DC Comics History Explained 
Black Manta&#39;s DC Comics story stretches back almost 60 years.
          




David Kane/Black Manta made his DC Comics debut in 1967 in Aquaman #35. While he was introduced as an enemy to Aquaman, little else was known about the character besides his high-powered suit and formidable opposition to the King of Atlantis. More was revealed about his character when he finally took off his helmet in Adventure Comics Vol. 1 #452. Readers learned Kane was a Black American who wanted Black people to take over the sea after facing oppression on land. The comic also featured his darkest deed against Aquaman when he killed his infant son which many thought Aquaman 2 would connect to via a tragic Easter egg.

                  Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom: 21 Easter Eggs &amp; DC Movie References   Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom is the final movie in the DC Extended Universe, featuring a collection of fun Easter eggs and movie references.   

 Black Manta&#39;s backstory was finally revealed in 1992&#39;s Aquaman #6. This comic introduces Manta as a child born in Maryland near the Chesapeake Bay. While playing near the ocean, he was kidnapped by pirates and forced to serve them as a slave. One day, Manta saw Aquaman swimming alongside a pack of dolphins near the ship. He begged the hero to save him, but his pleas went unnoticed. He eventually killed his captors and escaped, but held a grudge against the Atlantean king for leaving him to suffer. He became Black Manta and was determined to defeat Aquaman and become master of the seas.






 Black Manta&#39;s Powers Explained 
Aquaman 2 provides Black Manta with an entire arsenal of new abilities.
         

 Black Manta doesn&#39;t have any natural superpowers, but he is still a formidable warrior outside his suit. He is a gifted fighter as he has trained since he was young to be a threat on both land and sea. He is also one of the deadliest assassins in the DC universe and a gifted strategist. While born on land, he has a natural understanding of the sea and is an expert diver and undersea scavenger. However, what mainly makes Black Manta such a threat to Aquaman is his suit. It&#39;s not clear what makes his suit so powerful, but it&#39;s nearly impenetrable, even from the world&#39;s most powerful metahumans.



In Aquaman, the Manta suit is a gift from Ocean Master, Aquaman&#39;s brother, who gives Manta the suit so he can kill Arthur







It&#39;s equipped with several deadly weapons, including daggers, harpoons, and a double-bladed gun. His helmet allows him to breathe underwater and comes with two massive eyes that not only give him the ability of infrared and scope vision but also to emit powerful beams that can injure or kill metahumans like Aquaman. The suit also comes with a jetpack that gives him the ability to speed up underwater and shoot out quickly. Additionally, the suit grants him superhuman strength, meaning just one punch can do dramatic damage. In Aquaman, the Manta suit is a gift from Ocean Master, Aquaman&#39;s brother, who gives Manta the suit so he can kill Arthur.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom then provided Black Manta with even more abilities via the power of the Black Trident. In the film, the Trident empowers Manta beyond what was shown in the first movie. This allowed Manta to go toe-to-toe with Aquaman and other Atlanteans, overpowering them in his quest to revive the Lost Kingdom of Necrus. The Trident gave Manta enhanced speed, reflexes, endurance, and strength while allowing him to emit more blasts of energy than those of his suit.






 Black Manta&#39;s Comics Changes Explained 
Over the years, Black Manta&#39;s DC Comics story has changed for different reboots and universes.
While Black Manta is a consistent villain for Aquaman, his origin has changed many times. While 1992&#39;s origin is the first given to readers, it changed in #8 of the 2008 Aquaman series. In this version, Black Manta was a troubled autistic child who was held in Gotham City&#39;s Arkham Asylum. He was subject to many harsh experimental treatments but found comfort in water and was fascinated by Aquaman when he saw him on television. One experiment appeared to work on him, but it made him violent and he killed the experiment&#39;s conductor and escaped from the asylum.

Manta&#39;s backstory changed again in the New 52 era with this version being the closest to his origin in the 2018 Aquaman film. In this version, Black Manta was a mercenary hired to find a young Arthur Curry and steal a sample of his blood. During the attempt to steal his blood, Thomas, Arthur&#39;s father, intervened and died from a heart attack. Arthur blamed Manta for his father&#39;s death and attacked a boat he thought Black Manta was on, accidentally killing his father instead. After killing each other&#39;s fathers, Arthur and Manta became intertwined in a vicious cycle of vengeance and hatred with Aquaman 2 somewhat adapting this.






While Black Manta did not kill Thomas in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, he at least attempted to take his life in retribution for Arthur letting his own father die in the first movie.






 Black Manta&#39;s Black Trident Explained 
The Black Trident imbues Black Manta with Atlantean abilities.


 
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom includes the Black Trident, Black Manta&#39;s mysteriously dominating weapon. The weapon has a historical past with dark mystical abilities and the capability to corrupt those around it. In Aquaman 2, Orm explains that during Atlan&#39;s reign, there were seven kingdoms and the Black Trident was a curse among them all. During the time of Atlan&#39;s kingship, the Black Trident was wielded by Kordax, the brother of King Atlan. Black Manta finds the Trident buried beneath ice caps and sets out to free Kordax and the titular Lost Kingdom of Necrus from Atlan&#39;s imprisonment as a means to an end to killing Aquaman.



 Black Manta&#39;s Role In Aquaman 2 Explained 
Black Manta plays a major role in the final DCEU movie.
          




In Aquaman, Black Manta&#39;s suit was severely damaged by Aquaman and he was sent flailing into the sea. He was saved by Randall Park&#39;s Dr. Stephen Shin but was left wounded and humiliated. David is now on a path of vengeance and wants to destroy not only Arthur but his family and his kingdom. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom portrays this revenge-filled plot with Manta being more powerful than ever while also leading a group of mercenaries on a mission to destroy Atlantis via the unleashing of Kordax and the armies of Necrus.

Arthur is now a father, husband, and king who has a seemingly perfect life before Black Manta returns. After coming to terms with Manta&#39;s renewed threat, Arthur seeks help from his brother who is imprisoned for his actions in the previous film. Arthur and Orm put their bitter rivalry aside to team up and save the world from Black Manta&#39;s fury. This sequel is the final DCEU film before the universe is rebooted by James Gunn in 2024. As such, the film is Jason Momoa&#39;s last adventure as Aquaman with Black Manta providing an adequate opponent in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
