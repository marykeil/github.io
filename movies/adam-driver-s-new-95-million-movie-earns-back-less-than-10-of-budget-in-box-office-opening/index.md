The film&#39;s earnings represent just 7% of its $95 million production budget so far.   Ferrari&#39;s performance at the box office was overshadowed by other major releases and holdover films.

## Literature Review
The new Michael Mann movie Ferrari, which stars Adam Driver, turns out a disappointing opening week box office in the face of its $95 million budget.




Ferrari has experienced a crushing defeat during its opening week at the box office. The new movie from director Michael Mann stars Adam Driver as Enzo Ferrari, following the entrepreneur&#39;s attempt to stave off bankruptcy by entering a team into the 1957 Mille Miglia race. The ensemble cast of the movie also includes Penélope Cruz, Shailene Woodley, Sarah Gadon, Gabriel Leone, Jack O&#39;Connell, and Patrick Dempsey.




Per Deadline, the Ferrari release, which began on Christmas day, has closed out the week with a 4-day domestic total of $6.8 million. This places it at No. 9 on the domestic chart, behind all six of the other major wide releases that premiered over the holiday weekend as well as two holdover releases, Wonka and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. This domestic gross represents just a fraction of the movie&#39;s reported $95 million production budget, earning back roughly 7% of that total.


 Adam Driver&#39;s Rough 2023 Explained 
          

It remains to be seen if the Ferrari movie can shake off the theatrical doldrums and turn a profit. However, that would be a considerable achievement, considering the fact that it will likely have to earn somewhere in the realm of $190 million to reach the break-even point, based on its budget. That total also doesn&#39;t take into account the fact that Neon paid upward of $15 million for the distribution rights for the movie, which was originally planned to be a Showtime streaming exclusive.




This theatrical performance is also more bad news for Ferrari star Adam Driver. The two-time Oscar nominee&#39;s 2023 has been challenging, as he opened the year with the science fiction flop 65, in which he played a space pilot who found himself stranded on a dinosaur-ridden Earth 65 million years in the past. That movie earned a Rotten 35% approval rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and only made $60.7 million off its $45 million production budget, failing to make a profit.



65 is the 59th highest-grossing movie of the year worldwide, behind anniversary re-releases including Frozen and Titanic.




It remains to be seen if any upcoming Driver projects can reverse his 2023 trajectory after Ferrari. The most high-profile project featuring Driver that has been officially announced is Megalopolis. The upcoming movie, which is a passion project of legendary director Francis Ford Coppola, would have to be a major hit to make a profit off its reported budget of $120 million, but it could nevertheless help raise Driver’s profile as he finds new projects in which to star that could propel his financial prospects further.
