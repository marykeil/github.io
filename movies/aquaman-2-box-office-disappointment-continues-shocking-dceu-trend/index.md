Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s low box office performance completes a shocking trend for the DCEU as a whole. As the final film in the interconnected universe before the DCU reboot coming from James Gunn and Peter Safran, Aquaman 2 sees Jason Momoa returning as Arthur Curry&#39;s Aquaman who reunites with his half-brother to prevent a global meltdown, a followup to the first Aquaman which made over a billion dollars back in 2018. However, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has ended up following an unfortunate trend when it comes to all of the DCEU&#39;s sequels.

From 2013&#39;s Man of Steel to 2023&#39;s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the entire DCEU consists of 15 films within its established continuity. Of those 15, four were produced as direct sequels. While the hope with sequels is always to get a similar level of return and financial success, this was not the case, Likewise, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom continues the unfortunate trend where every direct DCEU sequel made less than the movie that came before it. However, there are some notable external factors explaining why that is.
