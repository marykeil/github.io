The Funko Pop figurines confirm that the horned monster, first glimpsed in the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire trailer, is named Garraka.

 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire&#39;s New Ghosts Explained 
          

The Ghostbusters: Afterlife ending saw the new and old characters coming together to defeat Gozer, the villain from the original 1984 film, once and for all. In turn, the sequel is set to introduce a new adversary, with the trailer revealing the mysterious and evil force known as the Death Chill that envelops New York City and threatens to cause a second Ice Age. Additionally, the trailer briefly reveals a tall, ghostly figure floating among the icicles, who is likely responsible for unleashing the Death Chill on the city.

The Funko confirms the main villain&#39;s name is Garraka, who appears in toy form as a more standard demon with horns. In all likelihood, Garraka will replace Gozer in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire as the franchise&#39;s next big bad. The toys also reveal a new ghost named Pukey who, based on their comical name and appearance, won&#39;t act as a formidable villain at all. In all likelihood, Pukey is a mischievous ghost similar to Slimer whose running gag is puking on people.






Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire releases in theaters on March 29.
