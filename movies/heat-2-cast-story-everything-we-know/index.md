## Literature Review

Heat 2 is the sequel to Michael Mann&#39;s intense 1995 heist thriller, and there&#39;s already much to discuss before the release date arrives.




Heat 2, the sequel and prequel to 1995 crime epic Heat, is on the way from director Michael Mann. Based on the novel of the same name by Mann and Meg Gardiner, the sequel to Heat will pick up the story of Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino), Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), and Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) both before and after the ill-fated bank heist in the first movie.




The first movie received multiple accolades and is now regarded as a classic, with Pacino, De Niro, and Kilmer all giving noteworthy performances. While the Heat 2 release date is still unclear it will be arriving around three decades after the original (or more), meaning anticipation is incredibly high. The fact that Ferrari star Adam Driver is reportedly in talks to join the cast of the Heat sequel as a young Neil McCauley certainly helps, too.

After Michael Mann confirmed his next movie would be the long-awaited sequel, the latest news finds Heat 2 getting an urgent filming update from the director. According to Mann, Heat 2 will most likely go into production in 2024 though he is unable to provide many details. The script is still being worked on at this juncture, but Mann suggests that Warner Bros. is making the movie a high priority. &#34;I get...very pleasant calls from Warner Bros. saying, ‘Is there anything we can do to help?’ which translates into, ‘Where’s the screenplay?&#39;&#34; Mann said, meaning the studio is just as excited about the project as fans.

The Sequel Is On The Way
          

Heat 2 was given the green light in 2023, with the Heat sequel publicly confirmed as going ahead in April 2023 (via Deadline). It was revealed on the announcement that Adam Driver was reportedly in talks to play Neil McCauley, and that Warner Bros. was looking at being involved.

No Names Have Been Confirmed Yet
          

There have been no official announcements about the Heat 2 cast. However, Adam Driver (Ferrari, Marriage Story) was reportedly in talks to play the younger version of Neil McCauley - the professional thief played by Robert DeNiro in the cast of Heat. Adam Driver has spoken about starring in Heat 2, but the in-demand Hollywood star has not confirmed or denied that he will appear.




The Heat 2 story is based on the novel of the same name by Michael Mann. It serves as both a prequel and sequel to Heat, which means there are clues about which roles need to be cast. Vincent Hanna and Chris Shiherlis both feature in the story alongside McCauley, so younger versions of all three of the core trio in Heat would need casting in Heat 2. Parts of the plot of the Heat sequel also take place after the original, and it&#39;s unclear if Pacino, De Niro, or Kilmer will be reprising their roles.

The Heat 2 movie will be an adaptation of the August 2022 novel of the same name by Michael Mann and author Meg Gardiner. The plot of Heat 2 takes place both before and after the events of Heat. The sequel segments of the story detail the aftermath of the first movie, whereas the prequel sections reveal that Neil McCauley, Vincent Hanna, and Chris Shiherlis have a past that’s much more intertwined than they realize.




Both McCauley and Hanna are after one man in the prequel segments of the Heat 2 story — Otis Wardell, a brutal killer with a reputation for savagery. For Hanna, Wardell is a vicious psychopath who needs to be taken off the streets. For McCauley, he’s a dangerous presence in Chicago’s criminal underworld - a disruption to the master thief’s plans, and one he nearly finds himself a victim of more than once.

Wardell returns five years after the events of Heat, and this is where many of the sequel segments of the story take place. Hanna, Wardell, and Chris Shiherlis all find themselves in L.A. once more, leading to a brutal shootout on the 105 highway. While the Heat 2 movie may make a few alterations to the plot this is largely the story it’s expected to follow, as Michael Mann has been clear that the success of the novel is what’s prompting him to make the movie.
