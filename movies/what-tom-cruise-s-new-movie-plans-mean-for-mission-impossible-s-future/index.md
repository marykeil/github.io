## Literature Review

Tom Cruise has landed a new deal at Warner Bros., and his new movie plans could have a major impact on the Mission: Impossible franchise&#39;s future.




Tom Cruise has been the star of the Mission: Impossible franchise for decades, but the actor&#39;s new movie plans could have a significant impact on the franchise&#39;s future. Thanks to the renewed popularity of the Mission: Impossible movies over the last decade, Tom Cruise has remained one of the biggest movie stars in the world and a prized partner for Paramount Pictures. The strength of their partnership was further solidified with Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s record-breaking success at the box office in 2022. That is what makes news of a new deal between Tom Cruise and Warner Bros. to create new movies and franchises quite surprising.




Since Warner Bros. is not in possession of the Mission: Impossible franchise, Tom Cruise&#39;s deal is likely to create plenty of questions about the nature of what comes next. There are few confirmed details about what the bankable action star and major Hollywood studio have planned at the moment. However, it is expected that this new partnership will command a great deal of Cruise&#39;s attention and creativity. The fact that this comes after Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1&#39;s box office underperformed is all the more confounding and could mean a shake-up for the Mission: Impossible franchise&#39;s future.

                  Mission: Impossible - Every Movie In Chronological Order   The Mission: Impossible movie franchise debuted in 1996 and has received five sequels thus far; here&#39;s the franchise&#39;s chronological order.   


 Is Mission: Impossible 8 Still Happening? 
         




The revelation of Tom Cruise and Warner Bros.&#39;s deal might cause concern that the Mission: Impossible franchise is immediately dead. That is certainly not the case, as Mission: Impossible 8 is still happening. The sequel to Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part 1 is already over halfway through production. Filming is expected to continue throughout 2024 ahead of the movie&#39;s new 2025 release date. While Tom Cruise might now be working with WB on a number of different projects, his immediate priority should remain on making Mission: Impossible 8 as big, exciting, and satisfying as possible.

Mission: Impossible 8 is the only sequel confirmed to be in development at this point, though. Cruise and longtime franchise director Christopher McQuarrie have teased the possibility of Mission: Impossible 9 before. Paramount has never confirmed that the ninth entry is going to happen. That means that as of right now, Mission: Impossible 8 is the only new Mission: Impossible movie audiences are guaranteed to get. It might be taking longer than expected, but the film will eventually be released and wrap up the two-part narrative that Dead Reckoning began.






 Tom Cruise&#39;s WB Deal Doesn&#39;t Mean Mission: Impossible Has To End 
          

The good news for Mission: Impossible&#39;s future is that Tom Cruise&#39;s Warner Bros. deal does not mean the franchise has to end. According to Variety, the deal between the actor and the studio does not have an exclusivity clause. This means that Cruise can, and surely will, continue to develop projects at other studios. Cruise currently has movies set up at Paramount and Universal that he still intends to make even as the Warner Bros. collaboration begins. If Cruise&#39;s deal was for his exclusive involvement in WB productions, that would immediately signal the end of the Mission: Impossible franchise or at least Cruise&#39;s involvement in it.

Without any major restrictions in place, Tom Cruise and Paramount are free to continue developing more Mission: Impossible movies if that is what both sides want. It is unlikely that any further plans will be announced before Mission: Impossible 8&#39;s release at this point, as Paramount will likely want to monitor the film&#39;s box office performance. However, if the movie rebounds and proves to be a massive hit, all parties involved can rest assured that Tom Cruise could return for Mission: Impossible 9 and beyond even after signing the WB deal. Whether that happens is a completely different matter.






 Tom Cruise&#39;s Deal Does Fuel Mission: Impossible 8 Send-Off Rumors 
          

Tom Cruise having the freedom to make more Mission: Impossible movies is great, but the deal does make previous reports about the franchise&#39;s future seem more credible. Early on during the development of Mission: Impossible 7 &amp; 8, reports surfaced that the plan was for the two-part movie to serve as the finale of Tom Cruise&#39;s time as Ethan Hunt. Mission: Impossible 8&#39;s story reportedly was designed to work as a send-off to the IMF agent, allowing Cruise to begin pursuing other interests and franchises. For the record, Cruise and McQuarrie have both downplayed the accuracy of those reports.

It is difficult not to see Tom Cruise&#39;s Warner Bros. deal as a potential sign that these Mission: Impossible 8 plans are true. Whether they were correct at the time and ideas for Mission: Impossible 9 were genuine, the performance of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning could have altered the plans again. Tom Cruise certainly does not want to see the franchise come to an undesirable end where it loses its box office reputation and hurts the star&#39;s track record. That could have led Cruise, McQuarrie, and Paramount to agree that Mission: Impossible 8 needs to be the end, leaving the star to begin thinking about what he&#39;ll do next.






 Tom Cruise&#39;s Warner Bros. Partnership Likely Signals The End Of Mission: Impossible 
          



Tom Cruise is clearly planning for life without Ethan Hunt and the expected commitment of making a new Mission: Impossible movie every other year or so.




Due to the current standing for the Mission: Impossible franchise, re-analyzing previous reports, and taking Tom Cruise&#39;s new deal into account, it certainly looks like the action series is coming to an end. In all fairness, the writing for this looked to be on the wall a few years ago. Back in 2022, it was reported that Cruise had started developing several new movies with Christopher McQuarrie. This included plans for a musical, a new action franchise, and a Tropic Thunder spinoff for Les Grossman. He&#39;s also continued to work on Edge of Tomorrow 2, which notably is a Warner Bros. production, and a movie set in space.




By adding the Warner Bros. deal to Tom Cruise&#39;s plate, his workload is set to be busier than possibly ever before. It only makes sense for the actor to begin lining up this many upcoming movies if he knows that he&#39;s going to have more time than before. Losing the Mission: Impossible franchise would certainly create the space needed to make many of these films and ensure he and Warner Bros. get the most out of their new partnership. Tom Cruise is clearly planning for life without Ethan Hunt and the expected commitment of making a new Mission: Impossible movie every other year or so.

If the Mission: Impossible franchise is coming to an end, it will be fascinating to see if these intentions are confirmed ahead of Mission: Impossible 8. It is possible that the film&#39;s official title will speak to the finality that the new installment has. However, all parties involved could also elect to not specify that Mission: Impossible 8 is the end if doing so would too heavily foreshadow a significant spoiler about the film&#39;s ending, such as Ethan Hunt dying. That is why audiences might have to wait until 2025 to officially know if Mission: Impossible is ending, but Tom Cruise might be planting the seeds for the reveal already.
