## Literature Review

Director Adam Wingard hypes the Skar King, the formidable new kaiju threat featured in upcoming Monsterverse sequel, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.




Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire director Adam Wingard teases what&#39;s to come from the film&#39;s big bad, the Skar King. After teaming up during the Godzilla vs Kong ending to take down Mechagodzilla, the two titular titans are set to join forces once again in the upcoming sequel to face off against the biggest threat the world has ever faced. The Skar King was teased in the first marketing materials for the film and has also featured in trailers, but remains a mostly mysterious monster villain.




Now, ahead of the Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire release date, Wingard teases in an interview with Total Film (via GamesRadar) what audiences can expect from the Skar King. According to the director, the new villain will be very different from any monster previously featured in the franchise. Check out his full comment below:


&#34;What’s interesting about this new film is that we go in a direction that I don’t think this series has ever seen before, which is that the Skar King is, in a way, the closest that the human threat has ever been juxtaposed onto a titan itself. 
&#34;The Skar King almost represents an upscaled version of the worst parts of humanity, just as Kong represents some of the best parts of humanity. I would say the Skar King is the greatest threat that we’ve seen in these movies. It’s really going to take a full team together to bring it down because it’s too big for just one titan!&#34;



 Why Godzilla X Kong&#39;s Latest Villain Reveal Is So Exciting 
          




An argument could be made that Godzilla vs Kong&#39;s Mechagodzilla already served as a representation of the darker side of humanity, specifically touching on greed and the weaponization of technology, but the fact that the upcoming sequel is leaning further into this idea with the Skar King is intriguing. The villains in most of the other Monsterverse movies are forces of pure destruction and, while entertaining, aren&#39;t always mined for thematic power.



As briefly seen in trailers, the Skar King wields an interesting new weapon called Whiplash, which is comprised of the spine and mandible of a defeated Titan.




With Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&#39;s Skar King serving as a representation of the worst parts of humanity, the new movie could potentially address larger criticisms of the Monsterverse regarding the movies&#39; lack of substance. Of course, the main draw of any Godzilla or King Kong movie will always be the spectacle of it all, something that Godzilla vs Kong certainly delivered on, but if this spectacle can accompany an exploration of deeper themes with compelling characters, the latest sequel could elevate itself beyond other franchise installments.




It remains to be seen how Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will fare with audiences, but trailer for the movie has already teased that some interesting changes are in store, including a brand new appearance for Godzilla. With a release date only a few months away, it won&#39;t be long before more is revealed.
