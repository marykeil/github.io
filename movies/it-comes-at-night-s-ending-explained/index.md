## Literature Review

Trey Edward Shults post-apocalyptic indie horror It Comes At Night left a lot of people scratching their heads; here’s the movie’s ending explained.




The Trey Edward Shults post-apocalyptic drama It Comes At Night explained, albeit subtly, the many themes at play in its story of a family trying to survive in a world ravaged by an unexplained virus. This mysterious virus kills off a large swathe of the population, and a family (Paul, Sarah, and teenage son Travis) has been surviving in a ramshackle cabin in the woods cut off from fellow survivors — that is until Will (Christopher Abbott) breaks in. After making sure he’s virus-free, Paul (Joel Edgerton) reluctantly allows Will and his family inside. Unfortunately, the living arrangements turn violently sour by the time It Comes At Night&#39;s ending arrives.




Throughout A24&#39;s virus outbreak movie It Comes At Night, Travis (Kelvin Harrson Jr.) is plagued by nightmares about the virus and his grandfather’s death that blur the line between reality and hallucination. One night, Travis finds Will&#39;s son Andrew (Griffin Robert Faulkner) sleeping in his grandfather’s old room and discovers their missing dog, Stanley, gravely wounded and infected at the cabin’s supposedly secured front door. Distrust mounts between the two families as they blame each other for the security breach and suspect each other of bringing the virus into the home, with the tension reaching a boiling point in It Comes At Night&#39;s ending.

                  How To Know You&#39;re Watching An A24 Horror Movie   A24 films are best known for their slow-burn narratives infused with arthouse aesthetics. What are the defining traits of an A24 horror movie?   


 Why Paul Didn&#39;t Let Will&#39;s Family Leave 
Paul Believed He Had To Kill Will And His Family To Protect His Own
          




In It Comes At Night&#39;s ending, Paul — believing Andrew is sick — forces Will and his family out of the cabin. A fight breaks out that ends with Sarah (Carmen Ejogo) shooting Will, and Paul shooting Andrew and Will&#39;s wife Kim (Riley Keough). Later, a visibly infected Travis lies in bed and is comforted by his mother. The horror film closes with a scene showing a devastated Paul and Sarah seated at a table, presumably having put Travis out of his misery and seemingly succumbing to the virus themselves. On the surface, It Comes At Night explains that Travis was the one infected all along and Will and his family die for nothing, but viewers looking for firm answers will be frustrated.

Paul won&#39;t let Will and his family leave because of a line he mentioned in a previous conversation with Sarah and Travis. Paul says that if Will&#39;s family leaves, they&#39;ll want to take half of their supplies, and there&#39;s always the possibility of the family coming back with nefarious intentions. Throughout It Comes At Night, Paul&#39;s lack of trust, which borders on paranoia, greatly informs his decision-making. When Paul believes that Will&#39;s family is sick with the deadly horror movie virus he feels that it&#39;s his responsibility to put them out of their misery, and in an act of self-preservation, he kills them all.

 What Travis&#39;s It Comes At Night Nightmares Mean 
The Visions Travis Has Are Probably Fever Dreams
          

Until It Comes At Night&#39;s ending, Travis experiences several surreal and terrifying nightmares. While these may seem complex and nonsensical, they act as the film&#39;s biggest form of foreshadowing. One of the first nightmares that Travis has involves seeing Will with hugely dilated pupils, basically meaning that Will has the mysterious sickness. This, along with his dream about Kim dripping bile into his mouth, foreshadows the events It Comes At Night explained in its ending.

If one interprets the ending as meaning that Will and his family are the ones who are sick, then Travis&#39; nightmares perfectly encapsulate and play into the final moments of the movie. This is highly likely in the underrated psychological horror, considering Kim&#39;s impassioned plea to her son Andrew not to let Paul &#34;see his eyes.&#34; However, if one interprets It Comes At Night&#39;s ending with Travis being the one who has been sick the entire time, then the nightmares could be fever dreams brought on by the illness. Travis&#39; nightmares still act as a narrative device in this instance, ultimately teasing his fate in the movie&#39;s ending.

 What Comes At Night? 
The Movie Reveals Very Little About Its Zombies
         

It Comes At Night&#39;s ending doesn’t give away who infected who, nor does the movie offer much information about the virus or what it does to people, which necessitates the infected being killed. Similarly, the audience never discovers what the “It” of the title is or why it comes at night. The ambiguous ending is by design too, which is probably why It Comes At Night left critics so divided. Director Trey Edward Shults explained in an interview that his goal was to leave the ending with some unanswered questions (via Thrillist). 





&#34;A lot of questions are left unanswered. That is intentional. I will say I left things the way they are for a reason and I hope it sticks with you. I hope it doesn&#39;t frustrate.&#34;


Ultimately, what comes at night is never truly explored in It Comes At Night&#39;s ending, but audiences can ascertain that the virus&#39; effects are enough to warrant killing someone. The most obvious answer is zombies and, based on what happened to Travis&#39; dog, this could be the most likely conjecture. Otherwise, there&#39;s no reason to kill someone after the virus takes hold. Masks and gloves seem to protect their wearers, and it&#39;s doubtful that family members would kill one another over a regular virus.

Instead, it makes more sense if it was to be a Night of the Living Dead-type sickness. The answer could simply just be the illness itself may be traced back to Travis&#39; nightmares. The nightmares could be a symptom of the sickness, with the fever dreams letting the infected know beforehand what is about to happen to them. It Comes At Night doesn&#39;t let audiences know what &#34;it&#34; is, but these are the two most viable options.

 The Real Meaning Of It Comes At Night&#39;s Ending 
It Comes At Night Is About The Fine Line Between Self-Preservation And Paranoia
          

It Comes At Night explained that Paul&#39;s paranoia and mistrust revealed the movie&#39;s true meaning. Ultimately, it&#39;s a film about self-preservation, how strict Darwinism hardens those against trust, and how paranoia leads to false if not detrimental assumptions. American culture has essentially boiled down to a &#34;survival of the fittest&#34; mentality, and when this adage is applied, it strips humanity along with it. It Comes At Night&#39;s changing aspect ratio marks Travis&#39; slow descent from being numbered among the &#34;fittest&#34; and his subsequent death. When one takes Darwinism to the highest degree, it leads to an ultimate focus on self-preservation.




Self-preservation, while necessary at times, is then taken to extremes, and it&#39;s usually at the cost of one&#39;s humanity, as well as that of other people. When someone is solely honed in on themselves, it creates a lack of trust in others and paranoia that someone else could rise to the top of the food chain. Trey Edward Schultz hopes the movie will stick with audiences, and his criticisms of capitalism are in It Comes At Night&#39;s ending. Both the ending and pretty much the whole premise of It Comes At Night, are open to individual interpretation and that’s precisely why it works so well.
