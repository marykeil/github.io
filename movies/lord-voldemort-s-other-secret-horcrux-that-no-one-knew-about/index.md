# Lord Voldemort s OTHER Secret Horcrux That No One Knew About


## SUMMARY 



  Lord Voldemort created seven Horcruxes but there was another, secret Horcrux revealed in the first book that is often ignored.   Professor Quirrell was a temporary type of Horcrux while Voldemort inhabited his body, which is confirmed in the Wizarding World.   It is possible that Voldemort created more temporary Horcruxes, such as the animals he possessed while in ghostly form.

## Literature Review



The Harry Potter saga introduced the audience to a variety of magical terms, spells, objects, and more, among them the Horcruxes, as Lord Voldemort infamously created seven, but there’s another one that is often forgotten. The Harry Potter saga follows the quest of the title wizard to stop Lord Voldemort’s evil plans against the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, but what neither Harry, his allies, and the audience were expecting was Voldemort taking his search for power and immortality to extremes.




Lord Voldemort rightfully earned the title of the darkest wizard thanks to his evil plans against the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, his thirst for power, his mastery of the dark arts, and his creation of Horcruxes. The process of creating a Horcrux is one of the darkest ones in the world of Harry Potter, so much so that the exact steps and details of it haven’t been fully revealed as they are reportedly too disturbing. Still, Voldemort created a total of seven Horcruxes that had to be destroyed in order to effectively defeat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, but there was another, secret Horcrux revealed in the first book and movie that is ignored when talking about Voldemort and his Horcruxes.

  2:48                   Related   All 7 Horcruxes In Harry Potter &amp; How They Were Destroyed   Harry Potter villain Lord Voldemort intended to become immortal by putting pieces of his soul into seven Horcruxes, but each one was destroyed.     


 Professor Quirrell Is Confirmed To Have Been A Type of Horcrux 
          




By the time of the events of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, Lord Voldemort had already been defeated, but he wasn’t dead. Voldemort lost his powers and physical form but his Horcruxes allowed him to continue living, though now in ghostly form, but he was still able to possess other living beings. Professor Quirrell was too gullible and succumbed to Voldemort’s manipulation, becoming his human host. Voldemort latched onto Quirrell’s body, his face appearing on the back of the professor’s head, and he used him to search for the Philosopher’s Stone and infiltrate Hogwarts during Harry Potter’s first school year.

Although Voldemort didn’t have to split his soul to possess Quirrell, the professor was a Horcrux while Voldemort inhabited his body, though a temporary type of Horcrux. This was confirmed in Wizarding World in an entry dedicated to Professor Quirrell, and the piece of Voldemort’s soul was able to exist without its container (Voldemort’s body) because it was the “master” soul that served as Voldemort’s awareness and consciousness. Harry Potter was able to defeat Quirrell by touching him thanks to the protective power Lily left in his skin when she sacrificed herself for him, prompting Voldemort to flee Quirrell’s body and leaving the professor to die.






 Could Voldemort Have Created More Temporary Horcuxes? 
          

To make a Horcrux, the wizard or witch has to detach a fragment of their soul and put it into an object or living being – and the only way to fragment the soul is by committing murder, as it’s the worst act of evil. Aside from the Horcruxes intentionally created by Voldemort (the diary, the ring, the locket, the cup, the diadem, and Nagini), there are also pseudo-Horcruxes, as is the case of Harry Potter, as he wasn’t intentionally turned into a Horcrux by Voldemort, and instead, it was the result of the killing curse rebounding on him. Quirrell is the only confirmed temporary Horcrux in the Harry Potter saga, but following the logic of this type of Horcruxes, the animals Voldemort possessed while in ghostly form would have also been temporary Horcruxes, but they couldn’t handle Voldemort’s soul for long.
