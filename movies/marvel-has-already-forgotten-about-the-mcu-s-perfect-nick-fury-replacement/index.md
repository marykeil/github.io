## Literature Review

The perfect replacement for Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was presented in Phase 4, though has since been forgotten about by Marvel.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to find a proper replacement for Nick Fury, and Marvel Studios has already forgotten the perfect one. When watching the Marvel movies in order, Samuel L. Jackson has more MCU appearances than anyone besides Stan Lee in the Marvel creator&#39;s various cameo roles. However, it became clear after Avengers: Endgame that Nick Fury would be less utilized in Phases 4 and 5 now that the Avengers are less of a focal point in the franchise.




Besides Secret Invasion and The Marvels in 2023, Nick Fury&#39;s MCU role has been somewhat diminished. This will likely be the case concerning the Marvel releases of 2024 as none are expected to include the one-eyed superspy. Therefore, other upcoming Marvel movies will need to find a replacement for Nick Fury as the Multiverse Saga moves closer to the need for an Avengers team to be formed for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. Ironically, the MCU accidentally provided the best candidate for Fury&#39;s Multiverse Saga replacement in Phase 4, though the franchise has since forgotten about the character.

 Marvel Accidentally Set Wong Up As The Multiverse Saga’s Nick Fury 
          




The character who would have been perfect to replace Nick Fury in the Multiverse Saga is Wong. In Phase 4, Wong went through a stretch of consecutive MCU appearances which was likely a happy accident from Marvel Studios. In 2021, Wong appeared in his first post-Avengers: Endgame project through a cameo role in the post-credit scene of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.

Only a few months later, Wong appeared in Spider-Man: No Way Home. 2022 then included two more roles for Benedict Wong in the MCU, with the actor first appearing in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Shortly after this, Wong&#39;s role in She-Hulk: Attorney at Law delighted fans with the more humorous portrayal of the Sorcerer Supreme. These disparate projects allowed Wong to impact various facets of the MCU and tied him intrinsically to some huge characters going forward. Through this, the MCU had an accidental Nick Fury replacement on its hands.



 Wong Hasn’t Appeared Since She-Hulk - What’s Next For The MCU’s Sorcerer Supreme? 
          




That said, despite this perfect albeit unintentional setup, Wong has not appeared since She-Hulk. Marvel could have realized the potential of Wong&#39;s interconnected nature in the MCU and given him more roles in Phase 5 to foreshadow his involvement in the Multiverse Saga going forward. However, Wong&#39;s lack of recent appearances begs the question of what is next for the Sorcerer Supreme.

Given the importance of Wong&#39;s role in Shang-Chi&#39;s post-credit scene, it is likely that his next appearance will come in Shang-Chi 2 which is confirmed to be in development by returning director Destin Daniel Cretton. Also, should Doctor Strange 3 be confirmed soon, it is likely that Wong will have a role to play in the next adventure starring Stephen Strange. The final possibility that is most likely to include Wong is Avengers 5, which will hopefully capitalize on the accidental teases of the MCU&#39;s Phase 4 and make Wong a vital part of the story.
