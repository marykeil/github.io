## Literature Review
While 2023 was buoyed by hits such as Super Mario Bros. and Barbenheimer, 2024&#39;s lack of major Hollywood releases may lose the box office $1 billion.




The 2024 box office could be in enormous trouble. The year will see the release of quite a few new installments in big tentpole franchises, including Dune: Part Two, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Deadpool 3, and Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. However, its slate of blockbusters has been impacted by quite a few factors, including the 2023 Hollywood strikes, during which writers and then actors took to the picket lines to fight for fair pay, resulting in quite a few 2024 movies being delayed to 2025.




Per Deadline, the domestic box office is expected to crash a huge 11% in 2024, landing $1 billion below the roughly $9 billion gross of 2023. A major driving factor in these projections is the fact that there are only 107 2024 movies slated to hit wide release next year, as compared to the 124 that premiered throughout 2023. In fact, there are so few titles that there are six weekends that are still completely bare of wide-release movies as of the time of writing, with one each in January, March, May, and October, followed by two in December.


 Are Any Surprise Hits In Store For 2024? 
          

Ultimately, 2024 is going to need some major blockbuster hits if there are any hopes of the domestic box office keeping up with 2023. That&#39;s not entirely out of the question, as 2023 itself saw a number of record-breaking surprise successes. This was particularly the case with the &#34;Barbenheimer&#34; double feature weekend, which saw the simultaneous releases of Barbie and Oppenheimer cause both movies to eventually rise into the worldwide Top 3 for the year.






Barbie is the No. 1 movie of 2023 with a worldwide gross of $1.44 billion, while Oppenheimer is No. 3 with $952 million.




It can be difficult to predict what upcoming movies will become hits, as the splashy failures of 2023 franchise movies like Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny proved throughout the year. However, there are any number of titles that could prove to be a huge boost for 2024. This includes the upcoming Blumhouse horror movies Night Swim and Imaginary, which are occupying the early-in-the-year release window that saw the company&#39;s previous title M3GAN turn into a surprise hit in 2023.

              Related   Every Horror Movie Releasing In 2024   2024&#39;s horror movies include sequels like Beetlejuice 2 and MaXXXine and new movies by Jordan Peele and M. Night Shyamalan. Here&#39;s when they release.    

Other 2024 movies could possibly prove to be surprise hits or perform better than expected. For instance, while the Marvel Cinematic Universe has hit severe diminishing returns this year, the upcoming Deadpool 3 could prove to be a smash, as it is bringing back beloved X-Men character Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in addition to being the popular title character&#39;s first entry in the MCU. Dune: Part Two could also significantly outstrip the original thanks to its theatrical-only release and its date coming in the wake of star TimothÃ©e Chalamet&#39;s 2023 hit Wonka, though 2024&#39;s ultimate hits remain to be seen.
