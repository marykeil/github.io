## Literature Review

Relative to their respective settings, these movies had happy endings. But what happens after the third act unfolds as an entirely different story.




For as long as film criticism has existed, audiences and critics alike have had a fascination for movie happy endings that definitely didn&#39;t last long. Also known as secretly dark happy endings, these are the finales that favor the protagonist - but only for a short amount of time during or after the third act. While these movies ended happily in their own ways, deeper analysis reveals that their final moments of triumph, justice, or peace are ultimately short-lived.
Indeed, when viewed from a critical lens, happy endings aren&#39;t always what they seem. From groundbreaking rom-coms like 500 Days of Summer, to films like Mad Max: Fury Road, Snowpiercer, and other epic action adventures, short-lived happy endings can be found in nearly every genre. Whether intentionally or not, these endings challenge viewers&#39; expectations for the characters they&#39;ve bonded with throughout the film. Though it challenges the intended narrative, audiences can resonate more deeply with a movie&#39;s overarching themes and messages by examining a movie&#39;s world - and the fate of its characters - beyond the third act.









 








 10  500 Days of Summer (2009) 
Tom Hansen would&#39;ve continued his obsessive behavior towards Autumn.


 







  500 Days of Summer  


  Release Date    August 7, 2009     Director    Marc Webb     Cast    Zooey Deschanel , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Chloe Grace Moretz , Matthew Gray Gubler , Geoffrey Arend , Clark Gregg     Runtime    95 minutes    


The third act of 500 Days of Summer sees Tom and Summer not ending up together - but still being on good terms. However, with Tom coming to the conclusion that true love doesn&#39;t exist, the ending also underscores how Tom&#39;s newfound peace is short-lived. Indeed, as the true villain in 500 Days of Summer, Tom exhibited very little personal growth over the course of the movie, continuously idealizing the concept of having a relationship with Summer even though the latter clarified she wasn&#39;t interested. While the ending implies that Tom will treat the new girl Autumn differently, he&#39;s likely to repeat the same toxic patterns he showed with Summer.





 9  Duel (1971) 
David Mann couldn&#39;t have survived alone in the desert.


 







The Steven Spielberg TV movie Duel culminates with protagonist David Mann finally winning the fight with the unseen truck driver trying to run him off the road. After a tense chase and confrontation, the truck goes over the edge of a cliff, seemingly killing David&#39;s menacing adversary. Moreover, the ambiguous nature of the truck driver&#39;s identity and motives adds an eerie touch, leaving viewers with lingering questions about the nature of the pursuit. What&#39;s less ambiguous is that David has no car, phone, or any other means of getting out of that desert alive. While Duel&#39;s finale can be considered a happy ending, it definitely didn&#39;t last long for David.

The viewers - both within the film and the actual audience - witness Truman&#39;s historic liberation. However, Truman is bound to be staggered by his own celebrity in the real world.

As Stereotypical Barbie transcends the limitations of her nature to develop her own identity beyond her intended branding, Barbie ends with the titular protagonist making the decision to become a real human woman. The movie also concludes with the executives of Mattel seeking a better and more grounded understanding of its target market. Yet, this happy ending is but a short-lived chapter in Barbie&#39;s tale of cultural revolution and upending gender stereotypes. As Barbie gets to know what it&#39;s like to become a real woman, she will only be more radicalized than before, and will likely be involved in more huge changes both in Barbieland and the real world.

Whiplash surprises viewers with a rare moment of warmth between the two in the ending, suggesting that they continued an amicable relationship. In reality, Andrew stepping up to the plate only vindicates Fletcher&#39;s toxic mentoring style.
