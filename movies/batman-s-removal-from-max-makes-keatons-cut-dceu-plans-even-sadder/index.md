## Literature Review

Batman 1989 is no longer available to stream, and this abrupt removal is making Michael Keaton&#39;s cut DCEU plans after The Flash even worse.




Max has made major changes to its catalog with the removal of several movies from different genres, including Tim Burton’s Batman, which makes the DC Extended Universe’s cut plans for Michael Keaton’s Batman even sadder. Despite starting strong with Man of Steel, the DCEU failed to connect with the audience and had to go through a major reboot, scheduled to officially begin in 2025 with Superman: Legacy. Even after the announcement of the DC Universe reboot, the DCEU still had four movies to be released, the most anticipated one being Andy Muschietti’s The Flash.




The Flash reunited viewers with Barry Allen (Ezra Miller), who, after discovering that he could use his powers to go back in time, decided to use them to prevent his mother’s death. What Barry chose to ignore was that changing the past was going to change his present, and he ended up in a timeline where he met his alternate, younger version, as well as another Bruce Wayne – none other than Michael Keaton, from Burton’s Batman timeline. The Flash was the long-awaited return of Keaton’s Batman, but the DCEU abruptly ended all hopes for more of him, which is now worse after Max removed Batman 1989.


 Batman 1989&#39;s Max Removal Means You Have To Buy It To Watch It 
          

As mentioned above, Max has been removing several movies in the last months, with many of them ending up on other streaming services. Unfortunately, that hasn’t been the case for many popular movies, and among them is now Tim Burton’s Batman. The movie that kicked off the Burton-Schumacher Batman universe isn’t available to stream anymore neither on Max nor any other streaming service, as well as Batman (1966), the film adaptation of the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin. The sequel to Burton’s Batman, Batman Returns, can still be streamed on Max.




To watch Batman 1989, viewers will now have to buy it or rent it, with platforms like Apple TV&#43;, Amazon, and Google Play offering different prices depending on whether it’s bought or rented. The sudden removal of Batman 1989 from Max and its absence from other streaming services is made even worse by Keaton’s final movie as Batman, The Flash, still being available to stream, and while it was the long-awaited return of Keaton’s Batman, it was a major disappointment.



 How Batman 1989&#39;s Max Removal Makes The DCEU&#39;s Cut Keaton Story Worse 
          

When the audience met Keaton’s Batman in Burton’s 1989 movie, he was already a well-established vigilante in Gotham City, and though there were flashbacks to the night his parents died, Burton mostly skipped Batman’s origin story. His story continued in the sequel Batman Returns, which was darker than the previous movie, and even though it&#39;s now widely regarded as one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, the different and darker tone of Batman Returns led to the end of Burton and Keaton’s time in Gotham City.




Although Batman Forever and Batman &amp; Robin are considered continuations of what Keaton’s Batman started, his story was left incomplete, which is why his return in The Flash was so exciting. The Flash answered the question of what happened to Keaton’s Batman after Batman Returns, revealing that he retired and had been living as a recluse in Wayne Manor after having stopped “all crime” in Gotham. Bruce was thrown back into action when he agreed to help both Barry Allens stop General Zod (Michael Shannon), but The Flash ended all hopes for more of Keaton’s Batman by killing him during the battle.

With Michael Keaton’s Batman now dead, the DCEU over, and Batman 1989 removed from all streaming services, the audience won’t be getting more of an older Bruce Wayne nor do they have the option of revisiting his very first movie. It’s to be seen if Batman 1989 will be picked up by another streaming service soon, but for now, its removal from Max just made his cut DCEU future even worse.
