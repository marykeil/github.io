# Scream 7 s Opening Kill Scene Can Eliminate The Biggest New Character Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Scream 7 could fix complaints about not killing off major characters by having Mindy and Chad die in the opening scene.   Killing off Mindy and Chad would remove the younger group and popular figures from the franchise, but it would show that nobody is safe.   Mindy and Chad&#39;s deaths could refocus the narrative on Sidney and Gale, potentially providing a proper end to their story and the franchise as a whole.

## Literature Review
Scream 7â€™s future is still unclear, but the opening sequence can follow a franchise tradition while also ending the reboot character issue.




Scream 7 will undoubtedly feature a twisted opening kill scene to follow the franchise&#39;s formula, but two specific deaths could subsequently eliminate a new character complaint linked to the recent reboot. Through the first six Scream movies, franchise installments used their respective opening scenes to feature Ghostface killing unsuspecting victims. After the original Scream killed Drew Barrymore&#39;s Casey Becker in the opening sequence, the sequels played off that shocking opener with various other twists. Whether it was unknown victims or established targets, the Scream movies set the tone with opening kills.




In Scream 5, however, Ghostface terrorized Jenna Ortega&#39;s Tara Carpenter, and for the first time, an opening scene victim survived the attack. This started a trend with the modern reboot-sequel, or &#34;re-quel,&#34; where characters who seemingly suffered serious wounds ended up surviving. The same happened in Scream 6, fueling the complaint that the 2023 sequel was afraid to kill off major characters. However, that can change with Scream 7&#39;s opening scene. Due to Melissa Barrera&#39;s firing and Jenna Ortega&#39;s Scream exit, Scream 7&#39;s future is already in doubt, but the movie could still use the opening kill as a strong statement.


 Scream 7 Killing Mindy &amp; Chad In The Opening Scene Could Fix A Core Four Problem 
          

Sam, Tara, Mindy, and Chad, or the &#34;Core Four&#34; as they are known, became the central unit in the modern Scream reboot. With Dewey dead, Sidney not around, and Gale pushed more toward the sideline, this younger group essentially took over against Ghostface. While the Core Four might have brought a lot of heart to the recent installments, plans for a satisfying reboot trilogy are now ruined for Scream 7 with the cast exits. The notion of the Core Four has also been squashed. While the movie likely won&#39;t kill Sam and Tara offscreen, Scream 7 can put the Core Four to rest by killing off Mindy and Chad Meeks-Martin in the opening scene.




Combined, Mindy and Chad were attacked five times during Scream re-quels. Chad should have likely died from the severity of his wounds in both cases. Instead, the twins, played by Jasmin Savoy-Brown and Mason Gooding, were kept around, with Chad&#39;s surprising Scream 6 survival mirroring that of his fate in Scream 5&#39;s ending. Scream 7 can change this by killing off Mindy and Chad right away, reversing their survivals in Scream 6, and setting the tone for the new chapter without Sam and Tara. This would also fix any complaint that the more recent installments were too afraid to kill off key characters after Dewey&#39;s tragic demise.



 Mindy &amp; Chad&#39;s Deaths Are Risky For Scream 7, But It Could Make Sense 
          

Killing off Mindy and Chad in Scream 7 would undoubtedly be a major risk. It not only removes the remaining younger group but also removes two popular figures. Whereas Chad had become more like a protective Dewey-like character, Mindy had grown into the comedic relief, taking over for her uncle Randy&#39;s franchise role. Conversely, taking the risk of killing off two central characters in the opening moments of Scream 7 could be a fantastic twist to show that nobody is truly safe in this franchise. It would also make sense from a narrative standpoint.




With Scream 7 re-tooling without Barrera and Ortega, it&#39;s unclear how much Savoy-Brown and Gooding will be involved in the upcoming sequel now that the focus can&#39;t be on the Core Four. It&#39;s also possible their respective roles will diminish unless they find a way to exit the project altogether due to the recent changes. The deaths of Mindy and Chad could be used to re-center the focus on Sidney and Gale if Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox agree to return for Scream 7. Putting them back in the spotlight could serve as a proper end to their story and possibly even this iteration of the franchise as a whole.
