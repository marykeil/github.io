## Literature Review

Margot Robbie recently made comments that implied she was done with Harley Quinn, but according to James Gunn, fans might have reason to celebrate.




James Gunn has shared a positive update about Margot Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn future in the new DC Universe after the actress&#39; worrying comments. While the DCEU had bad and good movies, Robbie&#39;s portrayal of Harley Quinn was a constant source of praise, no matter how the movie she appeared in performed. As arguably the most popular casting of the DCEU, Robbie&#39;s recent Harley Quinn update, where she seemingly teased she was done with the character, got DC fans preoccupied. However, there might be no reason to worry.




On Threads, Gunn revealed that he would love for Robbie to continue as the DCU&#39;s Harley Quinn.

          

According to Gunn, who worked with Robbie in The Suicide Squad, &#34;There are no plans at this time for anyone else to play Harley&#34; in the main DCU. While the character could be played by other actresses in future DC movies and animated shows, such as Lady Gaga in Joker: Folie à Deux, it seems like Gunn wants Robbie to stick around as Harley for his DCU.

                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.

A Few Announced DCU Projects Could Include Harley Quinn
          




Gunn confirmed he has not talked to Robbie about playing Harley Quinn in some time, and the actress&#39; comments show she has no DC project lined up. However, that does not mean that Robbie could not appear as Harley in one of the already-announced projects for the new DC Universe. In fact, one of them would make a lot of sense for Robbie&#39;s DCU debut.

Multiple DCEU stars have been confirmed to return as their characters in the new DC Universe. One such case is that of Viola Davis as Amanda Waller. Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn has some history with Waller from the DCEU&#39;s two Suicide Squad films. The last time the duo interacted was in Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad, in which Harley and her team betrayed Waller&#39;s orders to return home in order take out Starro.

With Gunn having confirmed a Waller series for Max, Robbie could return as Harley Quinn there. Waller could be looking for revenge against the defective Suicide Squad members, assembling her own team to take them out. If Harley is not in Waller, Robbie could also make her DCU debut in Peacemaker season 2, continuing her interactions from The Suicide Squad with John Cena&#39;s DC anti-hero, who killed Rick Flag, a close friend to Harley. While Harley&#39;s DCU future might not be fully clear, fans of Robbie&#39;s portrayal can at least rest easy knowing that Gunn wants the actress to play the DCU&#39;s Harley Quinn.
