## Literature Review

The international teaser for Back to Black gives a look at the biopic about singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse, who died of alcohol intoxication in 2011.




The new international teaser trailer for Back to Black gives a look at the upcoming biopic about Amy Winehouse. Winehouse was an acclaimed singer behind hit songs such as “Rehab,” “Valerie,” and the titular “Back to Black.” She is also the subject of the acclaimed 2015 documentary Amy, which chronicled her rise to fame and struggles with addiction until her tragic 2011 death by alcohol poisoning at the age of 27.




Now, Studiocanal UK releases the international trailer for Back to Black, giving a look at the upcoming Winehouse biopic. Featuring the music of Winehouse throughout, the Back to Black teaser trailer begins by showing Winehouse’s intense passion for songwriting.


 

Throughout, audiences then see glimpses of the singer’s performances as the young talent experiences her rise to fame. In addition to the trailer, Studiocanal UK also released a poster for the film:


 

The caption for the poster describes Winehouse as “A magnetic voice. Timeless music. A true icon.” The post also revealed that the film will hit theaters in the US starting on May 10.





 What To Expect from Back to Black 
          

Back to Black stars Marisa Abela as Winehouse, alongside a supporting cast of Jack O’Connell and Lesley Manville. Its screenplay is written by Matt Greenhalgh (Control, Nowhere Boy), and it is directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson. The film’s producers include Nicky Kentish Barnes, Ron Halpern, Daniel Hank, Debra Hayward, Joe Naftalin, Alison Owen, Tracey Seaward, and Elizabeth Small.



The teaser is an enticing glimpse at how the film will show the spectacle of Winehouse’s finite life, while exploring the darker elements as well




At first glance, Back to Black’s director seems like a bit of an odd choice to helm the biopic. Taylor-Johnson is best known for directing the erotic book adaptation 50 Shades of Grey, which is far afield from a Winehouse biopic. Prior to 50 Shades of Grey, however, Johnson directed the darkly comedic John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy. The film received decent reviews, and showcased Taylor-Johnson’s competency in the realm of music biopics.




                  10 Actors Who Could Play Amy Winehouse In Back To Black   These actors could play an amazing Amy Winehouse in the upcoming Back To Black biopic, a surely coveted role as the musical icon, gone too soon.    

This filmography will serve the director well as she takes on Back to Black. While the trailer showed little in terms of the entire plot for Back to Black, the teaser is an enticing glimpse at how the film will show the spectacle of Winehouse’s finite life, while exploring the darker elements as well. Hopefully, the film will balance these elements successfully as Back to Black prepares for its spring release.
