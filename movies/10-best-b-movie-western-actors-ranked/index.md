## Literature Review

Looking at the best actors who portrayed cowboys, gunslingers, and outlaws across the incredible B-movie Western genre, and ranking them.




Throughout the heyday of the B-movie Western, several stand-out stars made a name for themselves playing cowboys, gunslingers, and outlaws. While the popularity of the Western may have declined since the mid-20th century, the B-movies that were produced during that period stood as some of the most enjoyable, action-packed, fun-loving films ever screened. Without the major stars and actors who led them, they would not be nearly as acclaimed, and its important to shine on the best actors of this genre.
There are some B-movie Western stars, such as Lash LaRue, whose talent comes not primarily from their acting skill but from their incredible abilities as real-life cowboys. Other stars got their start as stuntmen during the silent film era but managed to stick around and make a name for themselves as stars of feature films. Some surpassed their humble origins and made a name for themselves in mainstream Hollywood pictures. These are the best B-movie actors of all time.
