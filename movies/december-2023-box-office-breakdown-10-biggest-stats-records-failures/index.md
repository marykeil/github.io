Summary
 The December 2023 box office had a favorable run with high-grossing movies like Wonka, Migration, and Godzilla Minus One. 
 The United States domestic box office is set to pass $9 billion, making 2023 a standout year for the industry. 
 Paramount had the worst box office performance in 2023, while Universal and Disney were the top performers, nearly earning $2 billion each domestically. 




The December 2023 box office has had a mostly favorable run, especially considering the recent slump over the last three years. A high volume of December theatrical releases played a significant role in the current surge in going back to the movies, including popular blockbuster titles Wonka, Migration, and Godzilla Minus One. With awards season rapidly approaching, a number of awards contenders were also released in December such as Poor Things, The Iron Claw, Ferrari, and The Color Purple.
2023 saw a heavy slate of franchise sequels and blockbusters that included Fast X, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, John Wick: Chapter 4, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and more. In such a saturated year that also featured lengthy industry-halting strikes by the WGA and SAG, 2023 has been eventful, to say the least. The December 2023 box office looks to wrap up the stacked year in movies on a high note.

 10 Upcoming Movie Sequels That May Struggle To Beat The Previous Movie&#39;s Box Office 
The box office highlights the overall success of a franchise and whether or not the series is in decline, several upcoming releases are at risk.







 10  Wonka Reclaims No. 1 Box Office Spot In Final 2023 Weekend 
        

After opening up with the number one spot at the December 2023 box office in its opening weekend, Wonka reclaimed its rank after Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom took it in its opening weekend on Christmas Eve. Wonka will surely win the New Year&#39;s box office race against Aquaman 2, The Color Purple, and Migration. The Timotheé Chalamet starring Wonka is set to surpass $142 million at the domestic box office and is currently on course to hit $32 million over the four-day New Year&#39;s holiday period (via The Hollywood Reporter).


 9  United States Domestic 2023 Box Office Passes $9 Billion 


Close







The United States domestic box office is set to pass $9 billion in total revenue through the New Year&#39;s holiday weekend, which will run through Monday, January 1, 2024. The landmark year is a massive improvement from the roughly $7.37 billion in 2022 and has much to do with a massive slate of theatrical releases in 2023. According to Deadline, 2024 is already projected to see a decrease of $1 billion due to a shortage of wide theatrical releases, making 2023 a true industry outlier of the decade.


 8  Godzilla Minus One Becomes Highest-Grossing Japanese Godzilla Film 
        

Godzilla Minus One has set a new record as the highest-grossing Japanese Godzilla film ever made. After earning $42 million domestically and $35 million globally since its December 1 wide release, the impressive and outperforming Godzilla Minus One is set to surpass an $80 million box office performance worldwide by the end of the New Year&#39;s holiday weekend window. The movie is already considered a massive success based on its modest budget of just $15 million.


 7  Aquaman 2 Opened With $27.7 Million, Less Than Half Of Aquaman 1 
        

The follow-up to the DCEU&#39;s successful Aquaman from 2018 has had a relatively abysmal opening, earning just $27.7 million in its opening weekend. The original Aquaman had earned nearly $68 million in its opening weekend, making the future of Aquaman 2 seem incredibly bleak. Aquaman is the only DCEU movie that surpassed $1 billion at the global box office, racking up a total of $1.14 billion. Despite its whopping $205 million budget and being released in many major markets including China, Aquaman 2 has only amassed just north of $250 million worldwide.

The only predictable thing about the box office is that it&#39;s unpredictable. These recent movies became smash hits seemingly out of nowhere.






 6  Universal &amp; Disney Both Nearly Earn $2 Billion At Domestic Box Office 
        

Universal and Disney were both the top performers at the 2023 box office, with each of them passing $4 billion globally and nearly scraping the surface of $2 billion in domestic revenue. Universal enjoyed the massive box office successes of The Super Mario Bros., Oppenheimer, and Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s while Disney had several significant box office performers such as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, The Little Mermaid, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.


 5  Paramount&#39;s Domestic Box Office Total Is Down By 35% From 2022 
        

The December 2023 box office reveals that Paramount has had the worst box office performance out of any studio in what has been a largely successful year for Hollywood. Paramount did not put out nearly as many revenue-driving titles as its competitors, resulting in a 35% drop in box office revenue from 2022 for the entire year. This is in part due to the massive financial impact of last year&#39;s Top Gun: Maverick. Paramount&#39;s most successful 2023 titles include Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts.


 4  Universal/Illumination&#39;s Migration Is Poised To Outperform Disney&#39;s Wish 
        

The newly-released animated movie Migration from Universal/Illumination is set to upset Disney&#39;s Wish at the December 2023 box office. After just being released on December 22, 2023, Migration has already skyrocketed to the number 10 spot in Universal&#39;s 2023 slate of movies and is likely to surpass Cocaine Bear and The Exorcist: Believer and potentially give Trolls Band Together a run for its money. Meanwhile, Wish has only amassed roughly $60 million at the domestic box office since its November 22 release, which Migration should surpass with ease.

 2023’s Christmas Box Office Winner Just Broke A 9 Year Record 
The film that dominated Christmas Day 2023&#39;s box office not only beat every other new opener, but it also broke a 9-year Christmas record at theaters.






 3  The Color Purple Generated More Than $18 Million On Christmas Day 
        

The Color Purple broke a nine-year box office record on Christmas Day, becoming the first non-franchise movie since 2014&#39;s Unbroken to win the Christmas Day box office. The musical remake generated more than $18 million on its opening day alone, which is impressive considering the Christmas Day box office title typically belongs to major franchise releases such as Star Wars Episode VIII - The Last Jedi, Aquaman, and Avatar: The Way of Water.


 2  Poor Things Has The Third Best Limited Release Of 2023 
        

Upon its December 8, 2023 release, Poor Things has found incredible success at the box office after generating $2.2 million in a limited release at just 82 theaters. It quickly became one of the highest-grossing films per-theater average of 2023, falling short only to Wes Anderson&#39;s Asteroid City and Ari Aster&#39;s Beau Is Afraid. Poor Things is slated to be released in Ireland and The United Kingdom in January, which should add to its already impressive box office run.


 1  Warner Bros. Became First Distributor With Top 3 Films In Any Week 


Close







Warner Bros. set a new record that&#39;s unrelated to Christmas Day by having the first-ever top 3 films in any given week, which is the first time that has ever happened with any distributor. Warner Bros.&#39;s three films, Wonka, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and The Color Purple were the top 3 films of the last week in December, which is the first time that has ever happened in Hollywood history. This certainly sends off the December 2023 box office on a high note.
