# The Most Powerful Jedi That Live-Action Star Wars Hasn t Used Yet (&amp; How It Can In The Future)


## SUMMARY 



  Cal Kestis, a powerful Jedi featured in Star Wars video games, is yet to appear in live-action projects despite his popularity among fans.   His absence raises the question of where he could potentially appear, with a continuation of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s story being the most likely option.   Cal&#39;s connection to the Hidden Path network established in the Obi-Wan series could bring him and the character together, providing a potential opportunity for his live-action debut.

## Literature Review
Live-action Star Wars projects have utilized several of the franchiseâ€™s most powerful Jedi, yet there is one who has failed to appear thus far.




Star Wars&#39; various live-action projects have utilized a vast number of the franchise&#39;s most powerful Jedi, but there is one who has been frustratingly absent thus far. Across the nine Skywalker Saga installments, its two spin-offs, and several live-action TV series, every Jedi in Star Wars&#39; movies and shows has been used to great effect. From the heroes of the original trilogy like Luke Skywalker and Yoda to the Jedi survivors of Order 66 like Ahsoka Tano and Kelleran Beq, Star Wars is no stranger to utilizing Jedi characters across the franchise&#39;s many live-action projects.




Through these various projects, both Star Wars&#39; strongest and weakest Jedi have been highlighted. These strengths and weaknesses of the Jedi Order are present across all three Skywalker Saga trilogies, something that is even better represented when watching the Star Wars movies in order. However, despite the iconic Jedi featuring at length in almost every single live-action Star Wars project, one of the Order&#39;s most powerful is yet to be featured in live-action canon stories.


 Cal Kestis Is The Strongest Canon Jedi Outside Of Star Wars&#39; Movies &amp; Shows 
          

The powerful Jedi in question is Cal Kestis, the Padawan-turned-Jedi Master whose story is told in the Star Wars Jedi video games. Through Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and its sequel Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, Cal Kestis has become a fan-favorite character and an incredibly powerful Jedi in his own right. From taking the fight to the Empire during the Dark Times to facing off against High Republic dark siders, Cal Kestis&#39; power has been highlighted to a sufficient effect in the two video games featuring the character.




Despite these feats of strength and the reception of Kestis among Star Wars fans, he is yet to appear in a live-action story. This is somewhat of a surprise given that the character&#39;s video game model is identical to actor Cameron Monaghan which makes his transition from game to live-action that much easier. However, Star Wars&#39; live-action canon stories have neglected Cal thus far, regardless of his power level ranking higher than most Jedi outside of Star Wars&#39; various movies and shows.



 How &amp; Where Cal Kestis Can Appear In Live-Action Star Wars 
          

Cal&#39;s absence from live-action Star Wars begs the question of where the character could appear in the future. The most likely option would be a continuation of Obi-Wan Kenobi as a connection between the Disney&#43; show and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was established. In the former, Obi-Wan encountered the Hidden Path, a network designed to help Force-sensitives and their families escape the clutches of the Empire. In Jedi: Survivor, it was established that Cal&#39;s close friends also work to aid the Hidden Path.




If Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s story were to continue, it would likely feature the character further helping those associated with the Hidden Path and could bring him and Cal Kestis together. Cal operates in the Dark Times of the Star Wars timeline, making this section the most likely option for his live-action appearance. That said, Cal Kestis&#39; ending is not yet written, meaning the character could live on past the original trilogy and appear in future Star Wars movies, be it as an opponent of Thrawn&#39;s in Dave Filoni&#39;s The Mandalorian film or an old, wise Jedi Master in Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie.
