 Tom Wilkinson&#39;s Rich Legacy In Hollywood 
          

Throughout his career, Wilkinson developed a worthy legacy in both theaters and on TV. Wilkinson began acting professionally in Britain, where he became such a prolific actor that he would eventually be appointed to the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, an extremely high honor that few individuals ever achieve. His wide-ranging career made him a natural fit for the Order.



Wilkinson also starred in the occasional video game, as he voiced characters in Batman Begins and Sleeping Dogs.







Wilkinson starred in a variety of movies, including Sense and Sensibility (as Mr. Dashwood), Shakespeare in Love (as Hugh Fennyman), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (as Howard Mierzwiak), and Selma (as President Lyndon B. Johnson). He also appeared as Carmine Falcone in Batman Begins. At the Academy Awards, he was nominated for Oscars for Michael Clayton and In the Bedroom, which is a mark of his talent and high esteem as an actor.

On TV, Wilkinson&#39;s career was just as rich. He worked on David Copperfield (as the Narrator), The Kennedys (as Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.), and most recently, he appeared in The Full Monty (as Gerald Cooper), the sequel to the 1997 movie. Wilkinson starred in the original The Full Monty, which made his return for the show such a rewarding moment. While Wilkinson&#39;s family has asked for privacy, the rest of the cast is likely to respond as word of his passing spreads.
