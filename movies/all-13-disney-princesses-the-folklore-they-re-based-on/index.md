# All 13 Disney Princesses &amp; The Folklore They re Based On


## SUMMARY 


 Disney princesses are often based on centuries-old fairy tales and other sources. 
 Some Disney princess movies, like Snow White and Cinderella, are based on dark and violent stories, but Disney&#39;s versions are more colorful and romanticized. 
 Each Disney princess has unique origins, such as Snow White being based on a German fairy tale, Ariel coming from a Danish story, and Moana drawing inspiration from various Polynesian folk tales.

## Literature Review

Disney princesses can trace their origins back hundreds of centuries, all across the world, and some are based on shockingly violent fairy tales.




Although Disney princesses have had a huge impact on Western culture, many of them borrow from centuries-old fairy tales and other sources. There are 13 canonical Disney princesses. Asha, the princess from Wish, is likely to join this exclusive club, but Disney will include princesses if their movies are commercially successful enough, and they don&#39;t start their own franchises. This is most likely why Elsa and Anna from Frozen are excluded. Of the 13 canonical Disney princesses, 10 are based on characters from fairy tales, other folklore, or real life.
Some of the origins of Disney princesses are common knowledge. For example, Rapunzel was already a globally famous character well before Disney&#39;s Tangled. But some of the other folk tale inspirations for Disney princesses are far more surprising. Disney&#39;s colorful, romanticized musicals often hide dark alternative versions. Many classic Disney movies are based on violent stories which would be deemed inappropriate for children by today&#39;s standards. Most Disney princesses can trace their roots back hundreds of years, and their places of origin are scattered across the globe.









 








 13  Snow White 
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)


 







  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs  


  Release Date    December 21, 1937     Director    David Hand , Perce Pearce , William Cottrell , Larry Morey , Wilfred Jackson , Ben Sharpsteen     Cast    Adriana Caselotti , Roy Atwell , Pinto Colvig     Runtime    83 Minutes    


Snow White was the very first Disney princess, making her screen debut back in 1937. Snow White is based on the German fairy tale Schneewittchen, which was recorded by the Brothers Grimm in the early 19th Century, although its roots are much older. The fairy tale has most of the key elements that would eventually make up the Disney movie, including the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, and the glass coffin, but a Broadway adaptation in 1912 also influences Disney&#39;s production. Disney&#39;s upcoming live-action Snow White remake is slated for release in 2025.





 12  Cinderella 
Cinderella (1950)
        

Disney&#39;s Cinderella is primarily based on French author Charles Perrault&#39;s 1697 fairy tale of the same name, but the story goes back many centuries. Versions of the fairy tale have existed in different cultures around the world, stretching back at least as far as the first century AD. The ubiquitous nature of the rags-to-riches story has parallels in Egypt, Italy, China, Persia, and Korea, to name just a few. Walt Disney was interested in adapting Perrault&#39;s version in the 1930s, but he put the project on hold when he realized it should be a feature-length movie.
            
 
 The Most Important Disney Princess Trend Actually Began With Cinderella 
Over the past century, Disney has created an ever-evolving tradition of princesses, with Cinderella establishing a key trend for the princesses.








 11  Aurora 
Sleeping Beauty (1959)
        

  sleeping beauty  


  Release Date    January 29, 1959     Director    Clyde Geronimi , Wolfgang Reitherman     Cast    Mary Costa , Bill Shirley , Eleanor Audley , Verna Felton , Barbara Jo Allen , Barbara Luddy , Bill Thompson     Runtime    75minutes    


Like with Cinderella, Walt Disney also based Sleeping Beauty on Charles Perrault&#39;s version of the fairy tale. The first recorded version of the myth comes from the anonymous French chivalric romance Perceforest, published in 1340. This version went through many different changes over the years, including Italian poet Giambattista Basile&#39;s much darker retelling. Fortunately, Disney used Perrault as his inspiration rather than Basile. Otherwise, Aurora would have had an evil queen trying to eat her children and then burn her alive.





 10  Ariel 
The Little Mermaid (1989)


 







  The Little Mermaid  


  Release Date    November 17, 1989     Director    Ron Clements , John Musker     Cast    Jodi Benson , Samuel E. Wright , Rene Auberjonois , christopher daniel barnes , Pat Carroll , Jason Marin     Runtime    63 Minutes    


The Little Mermaid is based on a fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen, originally published in 1837. Disney&#39;s version of The Little Mermaid changes Andersen&#39;s original story to remove some of the darker elements. The idea of a mermaid giving up her life underwater is the same, but in Andersen&#39;s version, the mermaid&#39;s transformation is extremely painful. Andersen describes the pain of her walking as if she is walking on knives, and the ending is less cheery too. The mermaid doesn&#39;t end up with the prince, and her soul enters a different plane of existence where she must serve humanity for 300 years.





 9  Belle 
Beauty and the Beast (1991)
        

French novelist Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve first wrote Beauty and the Beast in 1740. Her story was edited for concision and rewritten by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1757, and it&#39;s Beaumont&#39;s version which went on to influence future retellings of the fairy tale. Disney&#39;s adaptation also borrows heavily from the seminal French movie of the same name, created in 1946. Walt Disney tried to make an animated version of Beauty and the Beast several times throughout his life, but he was ultimately unsuccessful.





 8  Jasmine 
Aladdin (1992)
        

Disney&#39;s Aladdin draws inspiration from a popular Middle Eastern folk tale from One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of stories from the Islamic Golden Age from the 8th Century to the 13th Century. The collection was first published in English as Arabian Nights in the early 18th Century. In this version, Jasmine is known as Princess Badroulbadour. The original story is set in China, and there is some uncertainty as to the authenticity of the folk tale. Due to different translators and writers adapting One Thousand and One Nights, the story of Aladdin may not have originated alongside the others.





 7  Pocahontas 
Pocahontas (1995)
        

Pocahontas is the only Disney princess who is based on a real person, rather than a mythical figure. Born on the land that is now known as Virginia, the real Pocahontas was the daughter of Powhatan, the powerful leader of an alliance of local tribes. Disney altered Pocahontas&#39; story to make it more palatable for younger audiences, but these changes also misrepresent Pocahontas&#39; treatment by the European settlers. In reality, Pocahontas suffered intense hardships, and she was never romantically involved with John Smith.





 6  Mulan 
Mulan (1998)


 







Hua Mulan is a legendary folk heroine, with her origins dating back to between the 4th and 6th centuries. Mulan&#39;s story is generally believed to be fictional, although there is some doubt. With different versions of Mulan existing in songs and poems, it is difficult to separate fact from fiction. Nevertheless, many of the details in the Disney movie are certainly fictionalized. Mulan incorporates other aspects of Chinese mythology and culture into the story of the female warrior, like the belief in dragons and spirits.





 5  Tiana 
The Princess and the Frog (2009)
        

  The Princess and the Frog  


  Release Date    December 10, 2009     Director    John Musker     Cast    Anika Noni Rose , John Musker , Keith David     Runtime    97minutes    


The Princess and the Frog is a subversion of the fairy tale The Frog Prince, collected by the Brothers Grimm. The most well-known version of the story features a prince who has been cursed to inhabit the body of a frog until a princess agrees to kiss him, upon which he is transformed back into a human. Tiana is more closely based on E.D. Baker&#39;s 2002 novel The Frog Princess, in which a kiss transforms the princess into a frog. Disney took this concept, but changed the princess&#39; cultural background and incorporated aspects of Creole mythology.





 4  Rapunzel 
Tangled (2010)
        

The story of Rapunzel is one of the most popular fairy tales in European folklore. It was most notably told by the Brothers Grimm, but different versions existed centuries before theirs. In most versions of the story, Rapunzel is kept locked in a tall tower with no means of escape, until she is cast out by the sorceress who imprisons her there. Tangled gives Rapunzel more agency, and the movie&#39;s different name is one attempt to distance itself from the well-known story. The prince in the fairy tale is replaced by a thief in Tangled, and she doesn&#39;t have children in the movie.





 3  Merida 
Brave (2012)
        

  Brave  


  Release Date    June 21, 2012     Director    Mark Andrews , Brenda Chapman , Steve Purcell     Cast    Kelly Macdonald , Billy Connolly , Emma Thompson , Julie Walters , Robbie Coltrane , Kevin McKidd     Runtime    1h 33m    


Merida is the first Pixar princess, and the first Disney princess not to be based on a pre-existing character, either from folklore or real life. However, Brave explores Scottish culture and mythology. There are references to the supernatural Will o&#39; the Wisps, clan tartans, and the Highland Games, which still exist today. Merida is based on broad archetypes from Scottish folklore of brave warrior women, although she is supposed to tame her wild instincts and settle for a marriage instead.





 2  Moana 
Moana (2016)
        

  Moana  


  Release Date    November 23, 2016     Director    Ron Clements , John Musker     Cast    Dwayne Johnson , Temuera Morrison , Auli&#39;i Cravalho , Rachel House , Nicole Scherzinger , Alan Tudyk , Jemaine Clement     Runtime    1h 47m    


Moana isn&#39;t directly based on a character, but her story borrows heavily from a variety of Polynesian folk tales. The demigod Maui, voiced by Dwayne Johnson, is the most globally well-known character. He describes some of his feats in the song &#34;You&#39;re Welcome,&#34; and his tattoos tell part of his story, but these snippets only scratch the surface of Maui&#39;s legend. Many different cultures tell slightly different Maui myths, and Moana stitches together the character from many different sources across Polynesia. Moana&#39;s island of Motonui is meant to be a conglomerate of a few different places.





 1  Raya 
Raya and the Last Dragon (2021)
        

  Raya and the Last Dragon  


  Release Date    March 5, 2021     Director    Carlos López Estrada , Don Hall     Cast    Awkwafina , Kelly Marie Tran , Thalia Tran , Daniel Dae Kim , Alan Tudyk , Izaac Wang , Ross Butler , Patti Harrison , Gemma Chan , Sandra Oh , Benedict Wong , Lucille Soong     Runtime    112 minutes    


The team behind Raya and the Last Dragon traveled all over South East Asia, visiting Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. The splintered land of Kumandra is an amalgamation of these diverse cultures. Sisu, the last dragon, is based on the Naga, a mythical species found in many different cultures in the region which can transform into humans or serpents. Raya herself doesn&#39;t have a mythological equivalent, and she was created for the movie.
