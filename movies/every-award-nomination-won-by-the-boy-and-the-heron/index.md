## Literature Review

Miyazaki&#39;s latest masterpiece could vie for a Golden Globe or Oscar, but that hasn&#39;t stopped it from gathering other awards along the way.

Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s [***The Boy and the Heron\***](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-boy-and-the-heron/) is already getting plenty of awards and nominations, adding another feather in the acclaimed director&#39;s cap. While the likes of the Florida Film Critics Circle is nothing compared to the Academy Awards, it still shows the vast international appeal Ghibli&#39;s movies continue to have. Between the awards and its massive box office success, Miyazaki remains one of Japan&#39;s best filmmakers even today.

*The Boy and the Heron* made headlines when it was nominated for an Oscar in &#34;Best Music&#34;, and, more importantly, a Golden Globe for &#34;Best Picture - Animated&#34;. But beyond those awards, the movie has already received various film accolades since last December.



The movie&#39;s positive reception thus far seems to promise that these are only the beginning of more nominations further down the line.

As originally reported by [Anime News Network,](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-01-05/the-boy-and-the-heron-receives-eda-awards-best-animated-film-award/.206171) Miyazaki&#39;s latest directorial work netted a variety of prizes and nominations:

| **Awarding Group**                          | **Award or Nomination**                                      |

Joe Hisashi&#39;s work in composing *The Boy and the Heron&#39;s* score has already been shortlisted for the Oscars, while the movie is also eligible for the Animated Feature category, alongside 33 other films. The movie will be facing stiff competition, not only against other international films, but other anime movies, too. Its nomination for Best Animated Film at the Golden Globes also pits it against Makoto Shinkai&#39;s *Suzume*, where the two have [made history by filling the category with two anime movies](https://screenrant.com/golden-globe-two-anime-films-boy-heron-suzume/). But despite the pressure, the critics have already made the film one of Studio Ghibli&#39;s most internationally recognized.



Ghibli&#39;s last critical success of this magnitude was *Spirited Away* in 2001, which swept up countless awards between 2001 and 2003, including the Oscar for Best Animated Feature in 2003; to date, it is the only foreign, hand-drawn film to receive the prize. While Ghibli&#39;s prior films have received recognition, *The Boy and the Heron&#39;s* massive box office success and bevy of early rewards, alongside the remarkable Golden Globe situation, seems to perpetuate the idea that Miyazaki&#39;s directing talents seem to never fade. The same can be said of Joe Hisashi, who is considered the source of the music for Ghibli&#39;s best movies.



With a dozen more award ceremonies coming in the next few months, ***The Boy and the Heron\* is certain to turn up to earn a few more trophies. Regardless of the wins or losses, this is still easily the most awards offered to a Ghibli film since \*Spirited Away\***. The last Ghibli film to win a prize was *When Marnie Was There*, which only got seven nominations and one win for &#34;Best Animated Feature Film&#34; at the 2015 Chicago International Children&#39;s Film Festival. Suffice to say, Miyazaki continues to be an anime legend thanks to *The Boy and the Heron.*
