# Predicting The 10 Highest Grossing Movies Of 2024


## SUMMARY 


 Animated movies and superhero films have proven to be highly lucrative and anticipated, making them prime candidates for the highest grossing movies of 2024. 
 Franchises and sequels also have built-in advantages for box office success, increasing the likelihood of them making it to the top grossing list. 
 Despite changing viewing habits and the impact of the pandemic, there is still anticipation and demand for big-screen experiences, as evidenced by the success of recent highest grossing films.

## Literature Review

There are plenty of major releases in 2024 aiming for box office glory, but only ten of them will be the year&#39;s highest grossing box office hits.




2024 brings a brand new slate of exciting films that audiences are eager to see, but only ten of them will eventually become the highest grossing movies of 2024 at the year&#39;s box office. The financial side of Hollywood has been in a state of flux over the last several years thanks to decisions made during the COVID-19 pandemic. Audiences have become more accustomed to waiting for streaming to see certain releases, but 2023&#39;s highest grossing movies proved that there are still plenty of events that will bring flocks of viewers to cinemas around the world. That creates room to predict which 2024 movies will do the same.
Although the box office and viewing habits have changed a lot, there are still some constants that remain. Animated movies remain highly lucrative for studios, while superhero movies are also still incredibly valuable and anticipated, even if not all of them are guaranteed to succeed. Meanwhile, sequels and franchises have built-in advantages to finding box office success in many cases. That means that not every one of 2024&#39;s most anticipated movies will manage to secure a spot among the year&#39;s highest grossing films.









 








 10  Sonic the Hedgehog 3 
Predicted box office total: $500 Million
        

  Sonic the Hedgehog 3  


  Release Date    December 20, 2024     Director    Jeff Fowler     Cast    Ben Schwartz , Colleen O&#39;Shaughnessey , Lee Majdoub , Idris Elba , James Marsden     Distributor(s)    Paramount Pictures    


The Sonic the Hedgehog franchise delivered two financially successful installments during the chaos of the pandemic. This makes the outlook for Sonic the Hedgehog 3&#39;s box office appear quite promising. After the first movie made $302 million worldwide, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 jumped up to over $400 million two years later. A similarly large increase could arise for the threequel thanks to excitement from Shadow&#39;s introduction to a more family-friendly December 2024 release. This should allow Sonic the Hedgehog 3 to dominate the box office at the end of 2024 and make itself among the year&#39;s biggest performers.





 9  Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire 
Predicted box office total: $525 Million
        

  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  


  Release Date    March 29, 2024     Director    Adam Wingard     Cast    Dan Stevens , Rebecca Hall , Brian Tyree Henry , Kaylee Hottle , Fala Chen     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


The Monsterverse should get back on track at the box office in 2024 with Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire. After Godzilla vs. Kong made $470 million, the return of the two Titans and seeing them work together against Skar King has created great anticipation. The film could also benefit from the great run that Godzilla has been on between Godzilla Minus One and Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. A slight increase from what Godzilla vs. Kong made is to be expected at this point and should ensure the sequel earns a place among 2024&#39;s highest grossing movies.





 8  Kung Fu Panda 4 
Predicted box office total: $575 Million
        

  Kung Fu Panda 4  


  Release Date    March 29, 2024     Director    Mike Mitchell , Stephanie Stine     Cast    Jack Black , Awkwafina , Viola Davis , Dustin Hoffman , James Hong , Bryan Cranston , Ian McShane , Ke Huy Quan     Distributor(s)    Universal Pictures    


Kung Fu Panda 4&#39;s release in 2024 can bring DreamWorks&#39; animated movie franchise back to a prominent place at the box office. The first three films made around $600 million on average, with Kung Fu Panda 3 making the least at $521 million. With eight years passing between when audiences have had the chance to see Po on the big screen, there is certainly a pent-up interest in going on another adventure in this franchise. That should work in favor of Kung Fu Panda 4&#39;s box office, allowing it to come rather close to the franchise average if everything goes right.





 7  Venom 3 
Predicted box office total: $675 Million
        

  Venom 3  


  Release Date    November 8, 2024     Director    Kelly Marcel     Cast    Tom Hardy , Juno Temple , Chiwetel Ejiofor     Distributor(s)    Sony    


Venom 3 is well positioned to end Sony&#39;s villain franchise on a great note financially. The original movie was an unexpected smash hit in 2018 as it made over $850 million worldwide, and Venom: Let There Be Carnage still made over $500 million in the midst of the pandemic. The massive following for the character and Tom Hardy&#39;s portrayal is obvious, and that will certainly continue with Venom 3. There is even a chance that the film does far better than currently predicted if it has any major multiverse surprises, like a Tom Holland or Andrew Garfield Spider-Man cameo, that has larger ramifications for audiences to process.





 6  Dune: Part Two 
Predicted box office total: $715 Million
        

  Dune: Part Two  


  Release Date    March 1, 2024     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Timothee Chalamet , Zendaya , Florence Pugh , Austin Butler , Rebecca Ferguson     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


There is every expectation that Dune: Part Two will be among 2024&#39;s highest grossing movies, and it is easy to predict it will surpass the original&#39;s performance. When Dune came out in 2021, it made $402 million, which was impressive by any metric. However, it was even more surprising considering Warner Bros. released the movie simultaneously on streaming and in theaters. Dune 2 will not have a simultaneous streaming release to potentially take away from its box office total, and its repeated delays have not deterred interest. This prediction would call for a $300 million increase between installments, which is doable given Timothée Chalamet&#39;s rise as a box office star.





 5  Mufasa: The Lion King 
Predicted box office total: $750 Million
        

  Mufasa: The Lion King  


  Release Date    December 20, 2024     Director    Barry Jenkins     Cast    Seth Rogen , Billy Eichner , Kelvin Harrison Jr. , Aaron Pierre , John Kani     Distributor(s)    Disney    


Disney&#39;s prequel to the live-action The Lion King should be poised to be a big success, even if it does not come close to the heights of its predecessor. The 2019 version of the animated classic made $1.6 billion by assembling a star-studded cast and pulling on the nostalgia of the original. Mufasa: The Lion King does not have the same nostalgia to pull from, and Disney&#39;s live-action remakes have taken a dip financially in recent years. This should mean that the Mufasa-focused prequel ultimately becomes a major hit that pales in comparison to how well 2019&#39;s The Lion King did at the box office.





 4  Joker: Folie à Deux 
Predicted box office total: $825 Million
        

  Joker: Folie a Deux  


  Release Date    October 4, 2024     Director    Todd Phillips     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Lady Gaga , Brendan Gleeson , Zazie Beetz , Catherine Keener , Jacob Lofland , Harry Lawtey     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


DC&#39;s only movie in 2024 is Joker: Folie à Deux, and the standalone sequel is expected to be a hit. 2019&#39;s Joker was a surprise box office success as it made over $1 billion worldwide. While the sequel has the potential to do even better considering the addition of Lady Gaga&#39;s Harley Quinn, there is also a chance that the DC film takes a step back. Joker 2 does not carry a similarly controversial nature and DC&#39;s poor box office performances in 2023 are two factors behind this predicted drop. However, the sequel will still be an unmitigated success if it hits this projected box office total.





 3  Inside Out 2 
Predicted box office total: $875 Million


 







  Inside Out 2  


  Release Date    June 14, 2024     Director    Kelsey Mann     Cast    Amy Poehler , Tony Hale , Maya Hawke , Liza Lapira , Lewis Black , Phyllis Smith , Diane Lane     Distributor(s)    Disney    


Pixar&#39;s box office struggles in recent years have been well chronicled, but that should all come to an end with Inside Out 2. The original move made over $850 million at the box office in 2015. History with Pixar pre-pandemic would predict that Inside Out 2&#39;s box office goes well beyond that total and easily eclipses the $1 billion mark. However, since the studio and Disney are still recovering from the damage done to multiple movies getting exclusive Disney&#43; releases, it is more difficult to predict that. Inside Out 2 might ultimately only have a small increase over the original movie at the box office as a result.





 2  Deadpool 3 
Predicted box office total: $1.1 Billion


 







  Deadpool 3  


  Release Date    July 26, 2024     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Ryan Reynolds , Hugh Jackman , Morena Baccarin , Brianna Hildebrand , Jennifer Garner     Distributor(s)    Disney    


Deadpool 3 is about as guaranteed to be among 2024&#39;s highest grossing movies as a film can get. It is Marvel Studios&#39; only new movie releasing this year, so anyone wanting a Marvel Cinematic Universe experience in theaters will have to go here. Furthermore, the long-awaited proper team-up between Ryan Reynolds&#39; Deadpool and Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine has made anticipation levels sky-high. Considering Deadpool 3&#39;s multiverse rumors and potential cameos, the R-rated film could be a proper send-off to 20th Century Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise too. That makes predicting Deadpool 3&#39;s box office to cross $1 billion and set a new franchise record feel rather safe.





 1  Despicable Me 4 
Predicted box office total: $1.3 Billion


 







  Despicable Me 4  


  Release Date    July 3, 2024     Director    Chris Renaud , Patrick Delage     Cast    Steve Carell , Kristen Wiig , Miranda Cosgrove , Steve Coogan , Pierre Coffin     Distributor(s)    Universal Pictures    


After nearly having 2023&#39;s biggest movie in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Illumination could secure that title in 2024 with Despicable Me 4. The Despicable Me franchise has always been a huge success for the animated studio, with all but the first film making over $940 million worldwide. Now that Gru and the Minions are returning once again, the box office prospects of Despicable Me 4 should be quite enormous. Predicting it will be the highest grossing movie at the 2024 box office is one thing, but this prediction also calls for it to set a new record high for the Despicable Me franchise overall.
