## Literature Review

A non-wrestling scene from The Iron Claw exhibits one of Zac Efron&#39;s greatest talents and proves he needs to end a seven-year movie genre streak.




One scene from Zac Efron&#39;s new movie, The Iron Claw, is solid proof that the multi-talented actor needs to end a seven-year genre streak in his career. Written and directed by Sean Durkin, The Iron Claw is based on the true story of the Von Erichs, a family of pro wrestlers from Texas who rose to fame in the 80s. The Iron Claw chronicles the Von Erich brothers&#39; wrestling careers as well as the string of unspeakable tragedies their family endured.




Efron plays Kevin Von Erich, the eldest living Von Erich brother in The Iron Claw, and the only surviving brother today. Efron&#39;s harrowing performance as Kevin Von Erich in The Iron Claw has received praise from critics and audiences alike. The Iron Claw certainly demonstrates Efron&#39;s abilities as a dramatic actor and his impressive physical prowess as the onscreen wrestler, but the sports biopic also unexpectedly highlights one of his most prominent talents.

                  The Iron Claw Ending Explained   The Iron Claw has great performances as it follows the true story tragedies of the Von Erich family. We break down the details of the film&#39;s ending.   


 The Iron Claw Surprisingly Shows Zac Efron Needs To Make Another Musical 
Efron hasn&#39;t starred in a musical since 2017
          

There&#39;s one scene in The Iron Claw that proves how badly Efron needs to do another musical. At Kevin and Pam&#39;s wedding, the other Von Erich brothers join the newlyweds on the dancefloor to line dance to John Denver&#39;s &#34;Thank God I&#39;m a Country Boy.&#34; The rest of the actors are all doing a great job hitting the choreography, but Efron clearly out-dances them all. His steps are clean and seamless yet effortless, which comes as no surprise considering his musical roots.





 

Throughout his career, Zac Efron has starred in six musicals in total. His breakout role was playing Troy Bolton in Disney&#39;s High School Musical trilogy from 2006-2008, during which he also starred as Link Larkin in the 2007 film adaptation of the Broadway musical, Hairspray. Efron took a break from live-action musicals for a while before revisiting the genre in 2017 with the circus spectacle The Greatest Showman, but he hasn&#39;t made a musical since.

He may have stepped away from the genre for the time being, but Efron&#39;s musical roles actually prepared him for The Iron Claw. It turns out his extensive dance training from his musical background helped him pick up the demanding wrestling choreography in The Iron Claw much more easily. It certainly paid off, as Efron looks like a natural in the ring throughout The Iron Claw, but the wedding scene is a great reminder of how much of a natural he is on the dancefloor, too. Efron&#39;s dance moves in The Iron Claw prove that he needs to break his seven-year streak and do another musical soon.






 Will Zac Efron Make Another Musical? 
Efron&#39;s musical future is uncertain
         

Unfortunately, Efron does not have any musical projects lined up in the near future. His upcoming films include the Netflix romcom A Family Affair with Nicole Kidman, a 2024 reboot of the Three Men and a Baby films, and the fantasy comedy Ricky Stanicky, none of which are musicals. He doesn&#39;t seem to be against the idea of returning to the musical genre, but at the moment, Efron appears to be focusing on other types of acting roles.

Efron has expressed interest in returning for a potential High School Musical 4 in the past. Although it would be incredible to see him reprise his role as Troy Bolton in another High School Musical sequel, it would also be great to see Efron play a new character in either an original musical or another screen adaptation of a stage musical, like Hairspray. Efron could take on something like Timothée Chalamet&#39;s role in Wonka—an iconic existing character in a new story, like a prequel. Whatever Efron&#39;s next musical role is, The Iron Claw proves he can still nail any dance choreography he&#39;s given.
