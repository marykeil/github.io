Warning! Spoilers below for Saltburn




Jacob Elordi bathwater candles inspired by Saltburn are not available online for purchase, though his co-star jokes he scooped them up. Starring Elordi alongside Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, Richard E. Grant, and Carey Mulligan, Saltburn tells the story of Oliver (Keoghan), a working-class boy who is invited to stay in his mega-wealthy friend Felix’s (Elordi) mansion for the summer holiday.

The candles from one of Saltburn&#39;s most controversial sequences are now available for purchase. According to Variety, one can now purchase candles inspired by Elordi’s bathwater in the notorious bathtub scene on Etsy (for $27.91) or Amazon ($36). The candle is available in three aromas — vanilla, comfort spice, and sea breeze — and has a product description that reads “There’s nothing quite like the smell of a quality candle, particularly when that smell is inspired by Jacob Elordi and what we imagine His Highness to smell like.” When asked about the candle, Saltburn star Keoghan joked that he “already [has] 10 of them,” in a quote that is realized below:





I already have 10 of them. They’re all burning at my house right now.



 Saltburn’s Controversial Bathtub Scene Explained 
          

Arriving in the film’s second act, the bathtub scene is a two-part sequence that shocked many Saltburn viewers. First, Oliver glimpses Felix masturbating in his bathtub, but instead of looking away, his gaze lingers. Soon, the scene cuts to Oliver lying prostrate on the floor of the tub, sensually slurping up the bathwater (and anything it might contain) that Felix had just used. The scene was one of several unusual moments of eroticism within Saltburn, leaving it as one of the most talked-about sequences from the film.

Part of what makes this particular Saltburn scene so disturbing is its contribution to the vague sexual tension between Felix and Oliver. From the opening frames of Saltburn, it is established that Oliver loved Felix, but was not in love with him. However, Saltburn&#39;s ending reveals Oliver&#39;s true feelings. Oliver’s attraction towards Felix is questioned throughout the film through several tense scenes between the pair, and through the gazes Oliver gives towards Felix’s physique. The bathtub scene then serves as a microcosm for how this attraction is played out as a whole; Oliver’s attraction to Felix is always twisted, and mostly witnessed when Felix is left unaware.




                  10 Biggest Unanswered Questions &amp; Mysteries After Saltburn   Saltburn&#39;s wild ending leaves several questions and mysteries surrounding Ollie, the Saltburn estate, and the Catton family altogether.   

Elordi commented on the bathtub scene, noting that audiences were “gasping” and “yelling at the screen” during screenings that he attended. For Elordi, this was an exciting response as he felt the scene was a way to “push those boundaries” that normally limit mainstream films. Saltburn’s bathtub scene may have been shocking, but it has enough interest to warrant Elordi’s bathwater-inspired candles.
