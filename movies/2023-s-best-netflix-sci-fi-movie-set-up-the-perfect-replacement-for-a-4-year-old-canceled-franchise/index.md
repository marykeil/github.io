## Literature Review

It has been four years since Netflix canceled a popular science fiction franchise, but 2023&#39;s best Netflix sci-fi movie can now finally replace it.




One 2023 sci-fi movie was not only the best offering of the genre on Netflix but also a potential replacement for a 4-year-old canceled franchise. A myriad of science fiction movies premiered in 2023. While some, like Wes Anderson&#39;s Asteroid City, brought something completely novel to the genre, others, like Brian Duffield&#39;s No One Will Save You, gave familiar sci-fi tropes a new spin. There were also sequels and franchise films like Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse and Godzilla Minus One that left their mark with their spectacular visuals and rich narratives.




A Netflix original science fiction film also quietly rose in ranks and found its place among 2023&#39;s science fiction epics. Although it did not attain the same level of fame as Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse and Godzilla Minus One, its critical ratings proved that it stood tall among its peers and brought something unique to the overly saturated genre. A close look at this Netflix sci-fi film, its themes, and its ending suggests it could be the perfect replacement for another canceled Netflix franchise.

                  The Oldest Science Fiction Movie Has A Surprising Connection To Avatar   James Cameron&#39;s Avatar and the oldest science fiction movie, Georges Méliès&#39; A Trip to the Moon (Le Voyage dans la Lune), share a shocking connection.   


 They Cloned Tyrone Is The Perfect Replacement For Netflix&#39;s Altered Carbon 
         

Netflix canceled Altered Carbon after two seasons, even though the streamer had previously tried to expand it into a full-fledged franchise by releasing its anime movie in 2020. Considering how Altered Carbon&#39;s season 2 was arguably better than season 1, its premature end was disappointing. However, Netflix&#39;s best 2023 science fiction movie, They Cloned Tyrone, might be the perfect replacement for Altered Carbon, given how it shares many narrative and thematic similarities with the Netflix original series. Unlike Altered Carbon, which is set several centuries in the future, They Cloned Tyrone unfolds in a unique timeline that combines elements from several different eras.




However, like Altered Carbon, They Cloned Tyrone adopts a cyberpunk noir setting where death almost becomes a relative concept because consciousness can be transferred to new bodies. Many characters in They Cloned Tyrone&#39;s twisted narrative turn out to be clones like the &#34;sleeves&#34; in Altered Carbon, who had their consciousness transferred to them from their &#34;parent&#34; bodies. Even when it comes to the movie and the show&#39;s themes, both use their science fiction narratives to highlight socioeconomic disparities and the dire consequences of unchecked technological developments. They Cloned Tyrone may not have evolved into a full-blown franchise yet, but its ending proves it has potential.



 How They Cloned Tyrone&#39;s Ending Sets Up A Bigger Sci-Fi Franchise 
          

They Cloned Tyrone&#39;s ending reveals that even though Slick, Yo-Yo, and Fontaine exposed the underground experiments of their neighborhood, a bigger conspiracy is at play, where similar experiments are being conducted in several other neighborhoods. The movie&#39;s closing arc also shows how another Fontaine clone, named Tyrone, exists in another neighborhood, oblivious to the fact that he is a clone. With these story elements as cues, They Cloned Tyrone could easily become a bigger sci-fi franchise, where it could explore everything from the lives of other clones to the adventures of Slick, Yo-Yo, and Fontaine in another neighborhood. As director Juel Taylor joked (via USA Today), They Cloned Tyrone 2 could also be a completely different genre where Slick, Yo-Yo, and Fontaine try &#34;to start a pizza shop.&#34;
