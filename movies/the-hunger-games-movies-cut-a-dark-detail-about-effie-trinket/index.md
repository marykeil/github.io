# The Hunger Games Movies Cut A Dark Detail About Effie Trinket

## Literature Review

Effie Trinket&#39;s role in Katniss&#39; The Hunger Games story was changed from book to screen, especially regarding her questionable loyalties.  




The Hunger Games movies changed Effie&#39;s involvement in the war between the Capitol and Districts, cutting one of the darkest details about her character. Effie was always seen as a well-meaning but slightly clueless member of Katniss Everdeen&#39;s Capitol entourage, but her actual role in the Girl On Fire&#39;s story varies from book to screen. Effie&#39;s loyalties and morality were solidly understood in the movie, but in the novel by author Suzanne Collins, she was a little bit more of a question mark.




Katniss had spent years watching Effie Trinket come to District 13 and reap children to enter the Hunger Games, but she didn&#39;t get to know the woman until it was her turn to travel to the Capitol. The Hunger Games movies reveal Effie to be highly insensitive to the tributes&#39; plights, which at first made her seem despicable. However, as time went on, she slowly grew on Katniss. In the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 movie, Effie Trinket joined the rebels in District 13 and helped Katniss take her stand against the Capitol. However, the Capitol escort&#39;s experience during the war was far darker in the Hunger Games movies.

                  Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes Sequel: Is It Happening? Everything We Know   The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes explores the world of Panem before Katniss Everdeen but will there be a sequel to the prequel?    


 Effie Trinket Never Came To District 13 In The Hunger Games Books 
Katniss Was Left Unsure Of What Happened To Effie
          




When Effie Trinket was brought to District 13 to continue serving as Katniss&#39; escort in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 movie, she was clearly out of place. Still, she accepted the lack of make-up, wigs, and grand parties to support the girl she had come to love, and it was thanks to her meticulously kept schedule that Katniss fulfilled her duty as Mockingjay. However, this was not the case in the Hunger Games books, where Katniss had no idea what had happened to Effie after her second Games until much later.

Katniss said goodbye to a teary Effie Trinket just before entering the arena for the Quarter Quell in the Catching Fire book and didn&#39;t see her again until the preparations for President Snow&#39;s execution in Mockingjay. Katniss was thrilled to be reunited with her old escort, primarily since she had heard that Effie had been held captive by the Capitol during the war and that Plutarch Heavensbee had to work hard to convince Coin that she had been on the side of the rebels. Katniss found this laughable, since the idea of Effie participating with District 13 was outrageous – a far cry from the events of the movies.






 The Hunger Games Books Hint That Effie Had Been Tortured By The Capitol 
That Made The Books Even Darker Than The Films
          

Though Katniss was sure in the Hunger Games books that Effie Trinket wouldn&#39;t have gone along with the rebels, she was still horrified to think about what the Capitol might have done to her after the arena break-out. Though Effie seemed her usual, bubbly self before what was supposed to be President Snow&#39;s execution, Katniss noticed a different quality in her eyes. She described them as blank and disconnected: a sign that Effie had not been receiving the luxurious treatment she was used to in the Capitol.

At the end of the Hunger Games books, Effie is noted to be one of the last surviving escorts from the Hunger Games. Her peers, as well as the Hunger Games stylists and mentors, had been killed either by the Capitol because of suspicion of treason or by President Coin&#39;s new regime. Thanks to Plutarch, Effie was spared death. However, Katniss&#39; observations during their brief reunion at the Capitol hint that Effie was tortured by one side or the other. Still, what part she played and who she was loyal to, was never made clear.






 Was Effie A Rebel Or Loyalist In The Hunger Games Books? 
It&#39;s Much Clearer In The Movies
         

Though the Hunger Games movies showed Effie outraged by the Capitol, this wasn&#39;t the case in the books. When Katniss met Effie, she was loyal to President Snow and the Panem government. This made her a thoroughly disgusting character to Katniss, but Effie slowly began to grow on her over time. Still, this was only because the escort truly cared whether Katniss lived or died. Her efforts before the Games were aimed entirely at this goal — but she was always careful not to say anything against the Capitol of Panem. This is why Katniss found it ridiculous to think of Effie being a rebel.

Katniss had never asked her escort whose side she was on. Not only was there never a safe time to do so, but Katniss didn&#39;t want to know. She was frequently conflicted by her feelings of affection toward a select few clueless Capitol citizens. Their upbringing had so brainwashed them that it hardly seemed fair to blame them for their behavior. Still, it&#39;s possible that Effie was rooting for the rebels but was just too smart ever to say so. This could also be why she switched her loyalty to President Coin without a second thought. Like everyone else in The Hunger Games, Effie just knew how to survive.
