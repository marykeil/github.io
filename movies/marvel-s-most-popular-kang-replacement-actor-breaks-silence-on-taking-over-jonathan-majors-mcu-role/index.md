## Literature Review

Fear the Walking Dead Star Colman Domingo addresses the recent rumors of his Kang recasting for Avengers 5 and 6 following Jonathan Majors&#39; firing.




As his name swirls as a potential replacement in the role, Colman Domingo addresses the rumors of a Kang the Conqueror recasting in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars. Jonathan Majors played the next big bad of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in both seasons of Loki and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, all of which was intended to build up to the next two crossover movies much like Josh Brolin&#39;s Thanos before him. Following his guilty verdict in his assault and harassment trial by ex-girlfriend Grace Jabbari, Marvel fired Majors, though is reportedly still moving ahead with the next Avengers movies as planned.




While details remain unclear for Kang&#39;s potential MCU future, Domingo recently addressed the rumors of his potential recasting in the next Avengers movies during a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight. The Fear the Walking Dead alum revealed that he has heard &#34;talk and conversations&#34; of his name being in the mix for the role, though it&#39;s unclear if these have been said rumors or official discussions at Marvel for him to play the big bad, but he is open to the possibility. Check out what Domingo shared below:


I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m always looking at what I have to do right now... I know there&#39;s talk and conversations around, and I don&#39;t know how much is true. I don&#39;t even get that from my team, I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s true or not. The fans are passionate. Somehow my name is out there in the world [and] I like the idea of just having your name called and someone speaking lovingly and kindly about something is a beautiful thing.



 How Domingo&#39;s Recasting Could Save Kang&#39;s MCU Future 
         




Majors&#39; firing has led to much discussion among MCU fans over how to approach the future of The Multiverse Saga, with some pointing towards a direct recasting of Kang to others calling for a new villain, namely Doctor Doom, to become the new big bad. John Boyega was one name thrown around for a potential Kang recasting, though he had expressed disinterest in doing so a month before Majors&#39; dismissal. Domingo, on the other hand, has previously expressed interest in playing a villain in either the MCU or DC Universe, feeling he was &#34;ready now&#34; to take on such a role: 



I’m worked out, I&#39;m fit... I think I want to play a villain. I just want to be a villain. I don’t want to be the good guy. I actually want to do some really dirty, nasty work.




While Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&#39;s mid-credits scene established that most variants of Kang don Majors&#39; appearance, there are still ways for the MCU to explain around this. Something like Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, which has reportedly dropped the subtitle internally at Marvel, could introduce a new variant played by Domingo or another actor with the reveal that he wiped out the Council of Kangs off-screen, subsequently eliminating any potential canonical issues. With Deadpool 3 rumored to feature the Time Variance Authority, it could similarly be reasoned that the multiverse-hopping threequel will explain this issue. 




Should Marvel move forward with Domingo as a recasted Kang for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars, it could also serve as a more promising launchpad for the character heading into the MCU&#39;s future. Thus far, the villain has lost in every one of his appearances, being killed in the Ant-Man threequel and Sylvie killing his multiversal variant, He Who Remains, in the Loki season 1 finale, a drastic change from the slow buildup to Thanos&#39; power in Infinity War and Endgame. By offering a more powerful Kang with a new actor, and someone who has seen more in life akin to an actor like Domingo, who would be in his mid-50s should he be cast, it would open the door to a more layered and tense exploration of the villain even outside of the next two Avengers movies should Marvel stick the landing of recasting.
