## Literature Review

Quan Chi will be in Mortal Kombat 2, suggesting the sequel will explore more of the franchise’s lore and might fix the reboot’s Scorpion mistake.




Quan Chi is in Mortal Kombat 2, which is good news not only for the sequel but to Scorpion’s character. Despite heavily featuring Scorpion and Sub-Zero in trailers and posters, Mortal Kombat (2021) skipped some important elements regarding two of the franchise’s most important characters. The upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 is expected to fix the reboot’s mistakes and lean more into the game’s rich lore. Fortunately, this seems to be what is happening, with the sequel including famous characters and locations from the Mortal Kombat canon.




Mortal Kombat 2’s cast includes a lot of game characters who did not appear in the first movie, from massive villains to new heroes who are set to steal the show in the sequel. Now that the Earthrealm champions have been introduced, Mortal Kombat 2 can focus more on the wider lore of the saga, especially with the addition of characters like Shao Kahn and Quan Chi. That said, Quan Chi’s addition can help improve the character of Scorpion, greatly played by Hiroyuki Sanada in Mortal Kombat (2021).


 Mortal Kombat 2 Can Show Scorpion’s Origin Story The 2021 Film Skipped (Thanks To Quan Chi) 
         

A Mortal Kombat 2 set picture recently shared by game producer Todd Garner offered a first look at Quan Chi in the upcoming sequel. This will be the first proper live-action interpretation of the character, who first appeared in the 1996 Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm. A demon who comes from Netherrealm, Quan Chi is directly tied to Scorpion’s origin story. More specifically, in most renditions of the MK lore, Quan Chi is the one who claims Hanzo Hasashi’s soul and brings the warrior back to Earthrealm as the vengeful spirit of Scorpion.





 

While Mortal Kombat (2021) showed the death of Hanzo and his return as Scorpion at the end of the movie, it skipped over everything else that happened in between. For those not familiar with Mortal Kombat lore, it can be even difficult to comprehend how could Hanzo be back centuries after his death. Why Mortal Kombat skipped over Scorpion’s rebirth is unclear, but the fact that Quan Chi will be in the sequel is good news for the iconic anti-hero. With Quan Chi involved, Mortal Kombat 2 can revisit Hanzo’s backstory and even include flashbacks of his transformation into Scorpion.



 Mortal Kombat 2 Visiting Netherrealm Is Also Good News For Scorpion’s Character 
          




Not only will Mortal Kombat 2 include Quan Chi, but the sequel will also feature Nethrrealm. The addition of the famous underworld realm was all but confirmed by an official Mortal Kombat 2 set photo, suggesting the live-action franchise will finally explore Scorpion’s full lore. The easiest way for the sequel to improve Scorpion’s character would be to include flashbacks set after Hanzo’s death at the hands of Bi-Han but before his return as Scorpion in 2021. That said, the sequel can and should explore Netherrealm in the modern day too.

                  10 Most Exciting Things To Expect From Mortal Kombat 2   Mortal Kombat included plenty of details in the 2021 reboot. Although a lot was left out, the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 can correct those mistakes.   

Mortal Kombat (2021) only had a couple of scenes in Outerworld and none in Netherrealm, with most of the movie taking place on Earth. Assuming a tournament will happen, it will be interesting to see how the sequel will balance classic tournament movie tropes with the lore-heavy aspect of the new characters. It must also be noted that, in some versions of MK, Quan Chi is the one who actually killed Hanzo’s family and made it seem like Bi-Han was responsible. How much of Quan Chi and Netherrealm will be explored in Mortal Kombat 2 remains to be seen.
