# Up s Original Villain Death Would Have Ruined Pixar s $735 Million Box Office Hit


## SUMMARY 



  Pixar considered a redemption arc for the villain, Charles Muntz, in Up, but ultimately decided against it due to the potential for a long, dialogue-heavy scene.   The creators also considered trapping Muntz in Carl&#39;s house as it floats away, but realized it would undermine the story of Carl&#39;s relationship with his late wife Ellie.   The chosen ending, where Muntz falls to his death after his foot gets tangled in balloon strings, provides closure for Carl and allows the story to end on a positive note.

## Literature Review

Charles Muntz was the main antagonist in Pixar&#39;s Up but it took a while for the creators to come up with the right ending for him.                   




Pixar&#39;s 2009 animated movie Up proved to be a cinematic masterpiece, but the struggle to bring an end to its lead villain caused problems behind the scenes. Directed by Pete Docter, the movie tells the story of an elderly man, Carl Fredricksen, who ties thousands of balloons to his house to fulfill a lifelong dream to travel to South America; a young wilderness explorer named Russell and a talking dog named Dug get swept up along the journey. Up was released to critical and commercial acclaim, grossing $735 at the box office, and is often regarded as one of Pixar&#39;s best-animated movies. 




As shown in the film, Carl idolized famed explorer Charles Muntz and when he and Russell travel to South America, he finally meets his idol for the first time. But Carl&#39;s worship soon turns to horror when Muntz unveils his true mental instability and the lengths he intends to go to retrieve the famed bird and restore his reputation. In the DVD bonus section of Up, the directors spoke about how they tried to bring about Muntz&#39;s ending, an aspect of the story that caused several problems for the movie.

Up is one of only three animated films to ever receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Toy Story 3 (2010) also received nominations.








 Pixar Almost Redeemed Muntz At The End Of Up 
          

In the DVD extras of Up, the director and producers discussed the issues they faced in finalizing Muntz&#39;s ending. In the extra, &#34;The Many Endings of Muntz&#34;, director Pete Docter talks about how Muntz represented what Carl and Ellie wanted to become, and how he was an adventurous person who made mistakes in his life, similar to Carl after losing Ellie. Seeing the similarities between the two men, the creators of Up considered the idea of giving Muntz a chance to redeem himself by the movie&#39;s end.

The redemption version of the story depicts Carl and Muntz talking about what they lost in life; Muntz lost his public reputation and Carl lost his wife. Carl reveals to his idol that he knows what it feels like to lose everything and that is why he came to Paradise Falls, allowing Muntz to see that the two men are not so different, and he can come to an understanding with Carl. As interesting as the redemption concept was, Docter decided that it wouldn&#39;t work as it would merely depict the two men standing and talking for a long time, which could have been considered boring by audiences. 






 Pixar&#39;s Original Muntz Death Would&#39;ve Hurt Ellie&#39;s Story 
         

Once the redemption arc was dismissed, the creators returned to the idea of killing Muntz. In &#34;The Many Endings of Muntz&#34;, they discussed the struggle they faced with finding the best way to kill Muntz. They examined the idea of having Muntz lost forever in the labyrinth before deciding to bring about his end during the showdown on the Spirit of Adventure zeppelin.

At the climax of the showdown, the creators thought about having Muntz trapped in the flying house as it floats away. They ultimately decided this was the wrong ending as, during production, they realized that the house represented Ellie and the happy life she shared with Carl during their marriage. As producer Jonas Rivera explained in the extra, this ending made it look like Muntz was now with Ellie, which had the potential to undermine her story with Carl, so the idea was scrapped.

 Why Pixar Chose The Right Ending For Up&#39;s Villain 
          

After much deliberation, it was finally decided to keep Muntz&#39;s demise simple. In the final moments of the movie, just as Muntz is about to kill Russell, Dug, and Kevin, Carl lures the bird out of the house with chocolate. Muntz rushes after them, only to have his foot tangled up with several balloon strings; his weight causes the strings to snap, leaving the disgraced explorer to fall thousands of feet to his death.

Docter felt that this simpler ending proved the best for Up&#39;s villain, as it confirmed to viewers that Muntz was dead and allowed the writers to return the story&#39;s focus to Carl. Muntz&#39;s death also gave Carl a sense of closure and marked the end of his grief; throughout the movie, Muntz represented the person that Carl could have become, had he not chosen to let go of his loss and move on with his life. This simple yet effective demise for Muntz proved to be the right choice by the movie&#39;s creators; it allowed the story to conclude on a happy note for Carl and Russell and helped solidify Up as one of the greatest animated movies ever made.
