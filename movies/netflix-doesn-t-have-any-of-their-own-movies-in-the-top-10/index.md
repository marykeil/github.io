## Literature Review

Netflix&#39;s Top 10 movies has just made an interesting change, as it currently doesn&#39;t have any of Netflix&#39;s original movies in the ranking.




As of the writing of this article, Netflix doesn&#39;t have any of their own movies in the Top 10, and this is a bad way for the streaming service to start 2024. Netflix has invested a lot into their original programming, with all-new Netflix original movies getting released all the time. It would be expected that Netflix&#39;s own movies would be some of the most popular on the platform, but the current Netflix Top 10 suggests otherwise.




Netflix original movies have been one of the staples of the streaming service for years now, with the company investing in their original content like no other platform. Netflix&#39;s Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is one of the company&#39;s biggest recent releases, but it is far from the only one. 2023 films like Maestro, May December, and Rustin are major awards season contenders, while long-lasting blockbusters like Red Notice and The Adam Project have been fan-favorites for a while now.

 Netflix&#39;s Top 10 Trending Movies Don&#39;t Include Any Of The Streamer&#39;s Own Movies 
         

As of the writing of this article, Netflix&#39;s Top 10 trending movies doesn&#39;t include any of Netflix&#39;s own movies, and this is a big deal. The current top 10 from most popular to least popular are The Equalizer 3, Aquaman, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Meg 2 The Trench, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum, John Wick, Elvis, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The First Purge, and Justice League. These are all major movies, but notably, none of them are Netflix originals.




All of the movies currently in the Netflix Top 10 are acquired programming, leaving the Netflix original movies out to dry. Netflix has recently gotten a big boost to its acquired programming from Warner Bros., with several major franchises making the jump back to Netflix. However, this change has had the adverse effect of overshadowing the streamer&#39;s own movies, and this may end up hurting Netflix.



 Why Netflix&#39;s Trending Movies Are A Bad Way To Start 2024 
          

Considering Netflix&#39;s recent release strategy with their original movies, the current Top 10 not having any of the streamer&#39;s own movies is a bad way to start 2024. Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire was one of Netflix&#39;s biggest movies of 2023, with the film having a massive marketing campaign. The film has only been out for a few weeks now, and Netflix was undoubtedly hoping that it would have longer legs than it did.




                  Rebel Moon Just Proved How Big Another Netflix Release Truly Was   Rebel Moon has been a big success for Netflix, but its place in the streaming charts highlights just how much more successful another movie was.   

Netflix also has a ton of recent releases that should be more popular than ever due to the awards season, with films like Maestro and May December being exclusive to Netflix. However, even these films are being overshadowed by DC projects, John Wick, and other popular films. Netflix is going to have to up their original game if they want to take back their own Top 10.
