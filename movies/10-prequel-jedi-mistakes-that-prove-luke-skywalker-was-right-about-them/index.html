  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>10 mistakes the Jedi Order made in the Star Wars prequel trilogy prove that Luke Skywalker&rsquo;s The Last Jedi criticism of the Order was accurate.</p>
<p>Throughout the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the Jedi Order made 10 major mistakes that proved Luke Skywalker was right in Star Wars: The Last Jedi when he accused the Jedi of a legacy of hubris and failure. In The Last Jedi, while training Rey on Ahch-To, Luke says, &ldquo;Now that they&rsquo;re extinct, the Jedi are romanticized, deified. But if you strip away the myth and look at their deeds, the legacy of the Jedi is failure. Hypocrisy. Hubris.&rdquo; Although the Jedi Order in the prequel Star Wars trilogy have incredible power, they made many decisions that support Luke&rsquo;s assertions.
When Rey disagrees with Luke&rsquo;s assessment, he doubles down, arguing, &ldquo;At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.&rdquo; While aspects of these claims are complicated, they all, to some degree, hold true. Darth Sidious was also Chancellor Palpatine, and he took over the Senate and established the Empire under the Jedi Order&rsquo;s nose, and, of course, Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi, became Darth Vader. These errors stem in part from the Jedi&rsquo;s moral shifts and clouded perspectives in the Clone Wars, and here are 10 of their biggest mistakes.</p>
<p>How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.</p>
<p>10  The Jedi Didn&rsquo;t Address Anakin&rsquo;s Anger, Sadness, &amp; Fear
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace</p>
<p>Anakin openly displayed issues with anger, frustration, and fear throughout the Star Wars prequel trilogy, which makes it surprising that the Jedi Order did not step in earlier or much at all. When he arrives on Coruscant, Anakin expresses sadness about and a longing for his mother. Of course, he was new to the Jedi and was raised with typical familial bonds, so it made sense, but it&rsquo;s unclear how the Jedi actively worked with Anakin to move past those feelings; seemingly, they didn&rsquo;t. After The Phantom Menace, Anakin&rsquo;s behaviors only became more pronounced, with him consistently lashing out even in front of the Council.
When Anakin yells that the Council&rsquo;s decision to not grant him the rank of Jedi Master is &lsquo;outrageous&rsquo; and &lsquo;unfair,&rsquo; the Council does little more than tell him to take a seat. When Anakin brings intense paranoia about losing a loved one to Master Yoda, Yoda tells him to let go of his fear but does not address that this demonstrates a dangerous attachment. It&rsquo;s unclear why the Council didn&rsquo;t take more action. In The Clone Wars series, Yoda assigns Anakin a Padawan, Ahsoka Tano, perhaps to improve these behaviors, but she becomes another attachment. It&rsquo;s possible the Council simply gave too much weight to the Chosen One prophecy.</p>
<p>9  The Jedi Didn&rsquo;t Sense The Dark Side In Palpatine
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>A common critique of the Jedi Order is their oversight in regularly working alongside a Sith Lord, and while Palpatine was powerful enough to conceal his use of the dark side from the Jedi, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely effective. In Revenge of the Sith, Mace Windu says, &ldquo;The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor,&rdquo; signaling that it was somewhat perceivable. It&rsquo;s odd that the Jedi didn&rsquo;t take that one step further and identify Palpatine as the Sith Lord Count Dooku warned Obi-Wan about. Based on their incredulity at the idea, though, it&rsquo;s possible they believed the Sith were truly gone thanks to the Jedi—lending to the &lsquo;hubris&rsquo; argument.</p>
<p>8  The Jedi Accepted The Clones Without Fully Understanding Their Origin
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>One of the most confounding plot points in all of Star Wars is the fact that the Jedi accept the clone troopers, having previously had no awareness of their creation. The circumstances around the clones seem suspicious at best, and throughout his trip to Kamino, Obi-Wan makes it clear that he trusts neither the Kaminoans nor Jango Fett. Despite the mystery remaining largely unsolved—while it comes to light that Master Sifo-Dyas had a hand in it, the serendipity of the clone trooper creation aligning with The Clone Wars is a bit too convenient—the Jedi accept the army as their own.
This proved to be a fatal decision, as the clones came with inhibitor chips that, with their proximity to the Jedi and the trust they built with them, enabled Palpatine to carry out Order 66, wiping out the Jedi. It&rsquo;s likely that, as Palpatine wanted, the Jedi were painted into a corner with the emergence of the Clone Wars, and the clones offered a path forward. Part of the issue was that the Jedi overstepped their role in that decision; they weren&rsquo;t meant to be soldiers working for the Republic, and by undercutting what should have been their role in the galaxy, they brought their own end.</p>
<p>7  The Jedi Became Soldiers, Not Peacekeepers
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Along with their acceptance of the clone troopers came the Jedi&rsquo;s acceptance that they would be engaging in the Clone Wars as soldiers, essentially working for the Republic. This was contrary to the Jedi way and their legacy as peacekeepers in the galaxy, and that showed in how lost many of the Jedi, particularly Padawans, became during the war. Ahsoka Tano, Anakin Skywalker&rsquo;s former Padawan, specifically reflected on this in the Clone Wars era flashback in the Ahsoka series. Her years as a youngling in the Order, before the war, had simply not prepared her for the life of a soldier because that wasn&rsquo;t what Jedi were meant to be.</p>
<p>6  The Jedi Didn&rsquo;t Heed Barriss Offee&rsquo;s Warnings
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>Aligned with this issue of Jedi becoming soldiers, betraying what they were meant to be, was the emergence of Barriss Offee as a Jedi Padawan who fell to the dark side in The Clone Wars series. Interestingly, Barriss&rsquo; rationale for turning to the dark side was not dissimilar from the anxieties Ahsoka voiced in the Ahsoka series flashback scenes. When Barriss is found guilty of the murder Ahsoka had been accused of, she shares that many have lost faith in the Jedi because of their participation in the war. In front of the Senate, she explains:
I did it. Because I’ve come to realize what many people in the Republic have come to realize. That the Jedi are the ones responsible for this War. That we&rsquo;ve so lost our way that we have become the villains in this conflict. That we are the ones that should be put on trial, all of us! And my attack on the Temple was an attack on what the Jedi have become. An army fighting for the Dark Side, fallen from the Light that we once held so dear. This Republic is failing! It’s only a matter of time.
Had the Jedi listened to this perspective, they may have been able to undo some of the damage done throughout the Clone Wars, if not change their fate. While Palpatine&rsquo;s plan had already been very much set in motion, these opinions by Barriss are ultimately echoed by Anakin on Mustafar when he is justifying his own turn to the dark side, telling Obi-Wan, &ldquo;From my point-of-view, the Jedi are evil.&rdquo; Anakin was present when Barriss made this case, and this, combined with the Jedi turning away from Ahsoka, certainly contributed to his shift in perspective. Unfortunately, perhaps solely because Barriss was a dark side user, the Jedi ignored her pleas.</p>
<p>5  The Jedi Held Too Tightly To Their Rule Against Attachments
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Anakin is perhaps the most pronounced example of the issues with the Jedi&rsquo;s rule against attachments because his need to conceal his marriage to Padmé, compounded with his paranoia about losing her, sends him directly toward the dark side, but he is certainly not the only example. In fact, shockingly, in The Clone Wars series, Satine Kyrze, Duchess of Mandalore, declares her love for Obi-Wan, and he reveals that he would have left the Order for her. The Jedi Order put themselves at odds with the Jedi who had these connections despite the fact that it was likely time for a modernized update to the rule.
It&rsquo;s interesting to compare this rule against attachments from the prequel era&rsquo;s Jedi Order to the type of attachments Luke Skywalker went on to have after the events of the original trilogy, both in canon and in Legends. In the original trilogy, it could be argued that Luke has an attachment, at minimum, to his twin sister Leia. While it&rsquo;s certainly not the type of possessive relationship Anakin had with the people he loved, it&rsquo;s a familial connection that was concerning to the prequels&rsquo; Jedi Order. In Legends, Luke Skywalker even had a wife, Mara Jade, showing that Jedi can have attachments without falling to the dark side.</p>
<p>Every Member Of The Jedi Council During Order 66 (&amp; What Happened To Them)
At the time of Order 66 and the Great Jedi Purge, there were several major members of the High Jedi Council. This is what you need to know about them.</p>
<p>4  The Jedi Abandoned Ahsoka
Star Wars: The Clone Wars</p>
<p>The Jedi Council&rsquo;s decision to remove Ahsoka from the Jedi Order when she was falsely accused of murder contributed significantly to Anakin&rsquo;s lack of faith in them and demonstrated the Order&rsquo;s flaws. Although Ahsoka had proven herself time and again to the Order, fighting valiantly in the Clone Wars and embodying Jedi compassion for those she encountered throughout the galaxy, when she was accused of murder, they cast her aside. This ultimately led to Ahsoka leaving the Jedi Order and created doubt in Anakin&rsquo;s mind; he, like the Council, knew Ahsoka well, but in contrast, he never doubted her and worked tirelessly to find the true murderer and clear Ahsoka&rsquo;s name.
In addition to the effects on Ahsoka and Anakin, though, the Jedi exposed one of their biggest flaws with their decision. By removing Ahsoka from the Order, the Jedi had made it so that the Senate had jurisdiction to prosecute her; she had previously been protected by her status as a Jedi Padawan. This seemed to have been done in large part because there was pressure from the Senate to hand Ahsoka over. While they may have thought her guilty, it&rsquo;s more likely that this was a reflection of how much the Jedi had begun to prioritize the Republic over their own Order and their ideals.</p>
<p>3  The Jedi Became Too Political
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>The Jedi regularly met with Chancellor Palpatine and permitted him enough involvement in the Jedi Order that he was able to insist that Anakin be put on the Jedi Council. Palpatine, as the Chancellor of the Republic Senate, should never have had that level of influence on the Jedi, but because of the Jedi&rsquo;s role in the Clone Wars and their associations with the Senate, those lines were blurred. The Jedi were effectively working for the Senate, involving themselves in what should have been solely a political war. In so doing, they transformed what the Jedi and the Order were for, entering politics rather than focusing on keeping the peace.</p>
<p>2  The Jedi Didn&rsquo;t Act Even As Palpatine Grew More Powerful
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Even without knowing that Palpatine was a Sith Lord, the Jedi should have been aware that, as Chancellor, he was gaining more and more power and was therefore becoming a threat. Although Palpatine frequently gave lip service to the fact that all his power was temporary and he would happily relinquish that power once the war ended, his rise should have been more alarming to the Jedi. In Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan expresses to Anakin that Palpatine has too much power and has managed to hold onto it, but it was too late; the Jedi had stood by and, as Luke said, allowed Palpatine to rise to power.</p>
<p>1  The Jedi Never Sensed The Dark Side In Anakin
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Palpatine may have had the skills to conceal his status as a Sith from the Jedi and blind them to his use of the dark side, but Anakin did not. In fact, Yoda even sensed pain and death connected to Anakin after he slaughtered the Tuskens. Yoda seemingly never questioned Anakin about what he sensed, though, as a further demonstration of the Jedi&rsquo;s pattern of looking the other way. While the Order also represented how important the Jedi can be, Luke&rsquo;s criticisms hold true. Rey&rsquo;s new Jedi Order will face that history in the upcoming Star Wars film, hopefully addressing these pitfalls to avoid history repeating itself.
