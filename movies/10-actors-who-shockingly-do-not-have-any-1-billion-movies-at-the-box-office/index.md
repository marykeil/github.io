# 10 Actors Who Shockingly Do Not Have Any $1 Billion Movies At The Box Office


## SUMMARY 


 Despite their success in Hollywood, major actors like Gal Gadot, Jennifer Lawrence, and Ryan Reynolds have yet to star in a $1 billion box office hit. 
 Even with roles in successful franchises like Fast &amp; Furious and DC Extended Universe movies, these actors have fallen just short of the billion-dollar milestone. 
 While they have achieved box office success in other films, such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, these actors have yet to find their first $1 billion hit.

## Literature Review



Billion-dollar box office hits have become much more common over the last few decades, but there are still several major actors who shockingly do not have any $1 billion movies. In the years after Titanic became the first $1 billion box office hit, it was not until the 2010s that this milestone became much more popular and achievable by blockbusters. The result has seen several major Hollywood stars become quite synonymous with billion-dollar success stories, as the likes of Zoe Saldaña, Chris Pratt, Dwayne Johnson, Vin Diesel, and others constantly added new hits to their filmographies.
With a handful of franchises and their stars becoming accustomed to the significant box office achievement, most of the biggest names in Hollywood have at least one such hit attached to their name. Leonardo DiCaprio, Sigourney Weaver, Tom Cruise, Margot Robbie, Daniel Radcliffe, Daniel Craig, Margot Robbie, Christian Bale, and Mark Wahlberg are just a few of the major box office stars who have achieved this goal. However, there are still quite a few major actors that have yet to find their first $1 billion hit. Whether that&#39;s due to franchises underperforming or a lack of opportunities, several names stand out.

Only a handful of Hollywood actors get to claim they are part of a billion-dollar franchise, but these stars managed to do it more than once.













 








 10  Gal Gadot 
Highest grossing movie: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice


Close







Gal Gadot has been at the center of a few major franchises, but her involvement in them has not led to $1 billion box office hits yet. Her role as Gisele in the Fast &amp; Furious movies gave her a good shot early on. She left the franchise, though, to play Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe. This brought her the closest she&#39;s ever come to hitting the milestone, as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice made $874 million worldwide in 2016 and remains her highest-grossing movie. Ironically, she would have hit the milestone the year prior if Gadot&#39;s Furious 7 cameo was not cut from the final edit.





 9  Jennifer Lawrence 
Highest grossing movie: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire
        

Jennifer Lawrence has experience with some successful franchises and films, but the $1 billion milestone has still eluded her. Her time in the Hunger Games and X-Men franchises both failed to help her surpass that benchmark. The closest she ever came was with The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, which made $865 million worldwide back in 2013. The following year was a great attempt to surpass that total, as 2014 included her appearances in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 and X-Men: Days of Future Past, which made $755 million and $746 million respectively. Lawrence has not surpassed those figures in the years since.





 8  Ryan Reynolds 
Highest grossing movie: Deadpool 2
        

Ryan Reynolds is no stranger to starring in franchises and sequels, so it is surprising that he has yet to find a $1 billion box office hit. The Deadpool franchise has brought him the most success so far, as both movies made nearly identical amounts worldwide. Deadpool 2 holds Reynolds&#39; record for highest grossing movie as the 2018 sequel made $785 million worldwide, a mere $3 million more than the original. He nearly surpassed both films with his cameo in Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, which made $760 million. Despite also appearing in possible franchises like Green Lantern and Detective Pikachu, neither crossed the $1 billion mark.





 7  Ben Affleck 
Highest grossing movie: Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
        

Ben Affleck experienced plenty of box office success early in his career, but he has even failed to appear in a movie that made over $1 billion. His DCEU debut as Batman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice came the closest, but his subsequent DC appearances could not follow suit. Suicide Squad, Justice League, and The Flash all made less at the box office than Affleck&#39;s previous DC movies. Outside of the DCEU, Ben Affleck&#39;s box office successes included Armageddon and Pearl Harbor near the turn of the millennium. The former made over $550 million worldwide, and the latter made right around $450 million, both short of a billion.





 6  Matt Damon 
Highest grossing movie: Oppenheimer


Close







Matt Damon is no stranger to franchise films, but it is his non-franchise appearances that have brought him the most box office success. Despite appearing in multiple Ocean&#39;s and Bourne movies, none of those franchise installments even managed to surpass $500 million worldwide. Damon&#39;s biggest box office hits have come with The Martian ($630 million), Interstellar ($731 million), and Oppenheimer ($950 million). The latter collaboration with Christopher Nolan brought Matt Damon agonizingly close to being his first $1 billion box office hit, and there is a chance it will one day reach that milestone through re-releases.





 5  Sylvester Stallone 
Highest grossing movie: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2
        

Sylvester Stallone was one of the biggest action movie stars from the 1970s to the 1990s. His franchise leading roles have brought him plenty of box office success over the years, but none of them have ever managed to come close to the $1 billion milestone. On one hand, Stallone&#39;s closest attempt was The Expendables 2 as it made $314 million worldwide. However, it was later on when he partnered with James Gunn for a role in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 that he experienced his biggest box office hit. His small role as Stakar Ogord puts the MCU sequel&#39;s $863 million performance on his résumé.
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 made $845 million at the box office in 2023 






 4  Arnold Schwarzenegger 
Highest grossing movie: Terminator 2: Judgment Day
        

Similarly to Stallone, his action movie rival Arnold Schwarzenegger has not experienced the highs of being in a $1 billion box office hit. His best attempts to hit that milestone has come with the Terminator franchise. After the original movie&#39;s rather small box office total, Terminator 2: Judgment Day became the blockbuster of 1991 and made $520 million worldwide. Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s appearances in future Terminator sequels have not brought the same level of box office success, while even his roles in The Expendables or Batman &amp; Robin came up short.





 3  Angelina Jolie 
Highest grossing movie: Maleficent


Close







Angelina Jolie is a franchise stalwart and someone very familiar with experiencing box office success. However, she has not managed to be in a $1 billion hit to this point. The closest she&#39;s come is through Disney&#39;s live-action Maleficent, which made $759 million in 2014. Jolie also has starred in three Kung Fu Panda movies, two Tomb Raider movies, and joined the MCU for Eternals, along with playing the lead role in other action movies that did well financially. She has had no luck finding a movie that could make over one billion dollars so far.





 2  Brad Pitt 
Highest grossing movie: Deadpool 2
        

The lack of a $1 billion movie from Brad Pitt is quite surprising given the amount of success his movies saw at the box office in the 2000s. He had a great run of financial hits that included the Ocean&#39;s trilogy, Troy, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith, but none of them made more than half of the billion-dollar threshold. Technically speaking, Brad Pitt&#39;s biggest box office hit came with Deadpool 2, as his blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it cameo as The Vanisher was enough for him to be credited with an appearance. If not for the Marvel movie&#39;s $785 million box office, Pitt&#39;s highest grossing movie would be World War Z&#39;s $540 million.





 1  Denzel Washington 
Highest grossing movie: American Gangster
        

Denzel Washington is one of Hollywood&#39;s most recognizable stars, so it could be easy to think that he must have had a major box office hit, one that possibly even made $1 billion. However, his movies have not come close to hitting that record. Even with the success of the Equalizer trilogy, Washington&#39;s biggest box office hit actually came in 2007 with American Gangster. Ridley Scott&#39;s movie managed to make $269 million. It is quite shocking that Denzel has never had a movie make more than this. The lack of a massive box office hit makes his icon status in Hollywood all the more impressive, though.
