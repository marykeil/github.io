## Literature Review

These 3 movie franchises created the perfect storm to lead them to huge box office success and maintain it over multiple installments.




The $1 billion mark is a high hope for films&#39; box office performances, but it can be hard to keep a streak, as there are only three trilogies and franchises where every installment reached 10 digits in revenue. Breaking into the list of movies that have overcome that threshold is no easy task, as only 53 movies have ever done it. Having three consecutive movies from the same franchise hit the mark is an even more impressive and exclusive list.
Making a $1 billion movie requires a very precise recipe for success. Top box office earners usually need to be family-friendly movies, as only one R-rated movie, Joker, has ever passed $1 billion at the box office. An even more difficult ingredient to achieve is creating a cultural event around the movie&#39;s release. Many of the highest-earning franchises of all time achieved huge cultural significance, and the hype around their releases became a social necessity to be in on the conversation. It is a unique blend of appealing to the widest audience possible while also telling a unique story that makes viewers want to talk about the movie.
            
 
 25 Highest Grossing Movies Of All Time 
From the biggest entries in the MCU to sci-fi epics by way of unexpected animated box office successes, here are 25 movies that made the most money.












 








 3  Jurassic World 
$3,983,981,820


 







The Jurassic World trilogy had everything going for it to propel it onto the list of franchises with multiple billion-dollar installments. Jurassic World featured a star-studded cast, with Chris Pratt at the height of his fame and fresh off his Guardians of the Galaxy success. It had an already established, beloved, and immensely popular predecessor to use as a stepping stone and make the concept familiar to audiences. It could draw on nostalgia from Jurassic Park to bring in viewers who wanted to relive the prehistoric magic. It also had dinosaurs, an incredibly cool concept that appealed to children and adults alike and drew in entire families to the theater.
Making a full trilogy that stayed above 1 billion dollars in revenue is one of the most prestigious achievements in box office history. However, the Jurassic World trilogy was the closest to missing the mark. The trilogy started off strong with Jurassic World and over $1.6 billion at the box office, making it the 8th highest grossing movie of all time. It began to lose steam from there, though, with each subsequent film becoming less profitable. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom earned Universal Pictures $1.3 billion, with Jurassic World: Dominion finishing the trilogy making just over $1 billion. The trilogy suffered from weaker characters and stories than its source material, and the allure of new dinosaurs only lasted so long.





 2  Star Wars 
$4,482,740,296
        

Star Wars also had nostalgia to its advantage. The franchise began in 1977 with Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope and had been building a following of devoted fans ever since. 2015 saw the franchise&#39;s first return to the big screen in over a decade, and it became a movie event. The Star Wars sequel trilogy had a cast of characters that was bolstered by prominent cameos from the main cast of the original trilogy and a universal story of light versus dark. Nostalgia alone wasn&#39;t enough to turn the sequel trilogy into box office gold, though. It also benefited from a change to the classic Star Wars formula by introducing a female main character and the best visual effects the franchise had ever seen.
Star Wars had a similar problem to Jurassic World, as it simply lost steam as the trilogy progressed. Star Wars: Episode VII -The Force Awakens earned over $2 billion and became the 5th highest grossing movie ever. By the time Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker finished its box office run, it had grossed just over $1 billion. This was partly a problem with directorial vision, as Rian Johnson&#39;s film, Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi lacked cohesion with the other two in the trilogy. The nostalgia factor also began to work against the films in the long run, as they began to be seen as using fan-favorite characters as safety wheels to ensure their success, such as bringing Emperor Palpatine back from the dead for the finale.





 1  Avengers 
$7,777,410,723
        

The Avengers movies stand alone in this list, both by being the top-earning franchise and because their success was largely self-made with no nostalgia to bolster earnings. Marvel characters rarely departed from comic book pages before the dawn of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and when they did, their movies were largely underwhelming. This meant that average moviegoers didn&#39;t have a base of knowledge about the film ahead of time, and other movies in the MCU had to build up the reputation and hype of the crossover events, which they did beautifully. Over the course of its creation, the Avengers franchise became one of the most highly anticipated movie events ever, fueling its box office success.
Unlike the other movies on this list, the Avengers franchise improved its box office performance over time. The Avengers began the franchise&#39;s box office dominance in 2012 with over $1.5 billion in revenue. The most recent installment of the franchise, Avengers: Endgame, blew its predecessors away with almost $2.8 billion at the box office. The series&#39; main advantage was having an entire franchise of successful movies that planned to use Endgame as their climax from very early on. It used the independent success of those movies well, asAvengers: Endgame had the most characters of any movie on this list. While the franchise does have four movies in total, it still outshines the other contenders on this list by several billion dollars.
Box office success requires a huge variety of variables to be just right, and passing the $1 billion mark requires a movie to be nearly perfect in all of them. Maintaining that level of revenue success over a series of movies is incredibly challenging, and only 3 franchises have ever achieved it. They all had unique advantages that set them apart from the rest of the competition, and they played to their strengths extremely well. New additions could be made to the list in the future, but for now, these franchises stand alone at the top of the box office records.
