## Literature Review

One Ethan Hawke film that depicts the 1972 Andes plane crash includes one important part of the story that Society of the Snow glosses over.




While Society of the Snow is, for the most part, a faithful depiction of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 disaster, the story also leaves out a few significant details from the true story that one Ethan Hawke-led movie included. The 2023 Netflix thriller film revolves around the Andes plane crash in the 1970s, which resulted in the deaths of many but also the survival of 16 of the victims. This story has been adapted for the screen (and has inspired numerous movies and television shows) many times since it happened, meaning that some portrayals leave out facts about the crash that others do not.




Following its release on Netflix, Society of the Snow received a lot of praise for its accurate storytelling of the horrific 1972 disaster. Many consider the survival movie one of the most truthful adaptations of the crash, partly due to its all-South American cast, language, and the fact that part of it was filmed at the Valley of Tears (the disaster site in the Andes). However, even though Society of the Snow&#39;s praise is well-deserved, another film contains a part of the story that the Netflix feature glosses over.


 The 1993 Movie Alive Focuses More On Nando &amp; Roberto&#39;s 10-Day Mountain Trek 
          

Alive, starring Ethan Hawke as Nando Parrado, depicts the 1972 Andes plane crash. Unlike Society of the Snow, a significant chunk of the 1993 movie focuses on Nando and Roberto Canessa&#39;s trek through the mountains that led to a rescue. In real life, the remaining survivors decided to take matters into their own hands and search for help instead of waiting for help to find them. Ultimately, Nando and Roberto climbed over the peak and completed the journey. They trekked for ten days through the mountains before finding civilization and guiding the Chilean Air Force to the crash site to save the other passengers (more than two months after the disaster).




The 2023 Netflix movie focuses more on the passengers&#39; time on the mountain and their lives after being rescued. Meanwhile, Alive spends much more time portraying Nando and Roberto&#39;s miraculous journey to safety. Many differences exist between Society of the Snow and Alive, but this is undoubtedly one of the most significant ways the two films vary.

                  10 Biggest Details Society Of The Snow Leaves Out From The True Story   Society of the Snow is considered to be very authentic to the 1972 Andes plane crash and accounts of survivors, but some key aspects were left out.   



 Why Society Of The Snow Barely Shows Nando &amp; Roberto&#39;s Journey To Finding Rescue 
          

Even though Society of the Snow and Alive both depict the same plane crash, the two movies focus on different components of the true story. The 1993 biographical drama centers around the survivors&#39; tales and is told from their point of view. However, Society of the Snow focuses on the stories of the dead, which is why the film is told from Numa Turcatti&#39;s point of view.






Society of the Snow is now streaming on Netflix, and Alive is available to rent or buy on Amazon Prime Video.
