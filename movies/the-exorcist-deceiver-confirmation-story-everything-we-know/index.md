## Literature Review

The Exorcist: Deceiver is the upcoming second chapter in Blumhouse&#39;s rebooted Exorcist trilogy, and here&#39;s everything we know so far.




The Exorcist: Deceiver is the upcoming second chapter in Blumhouse&#39;s rebooted Exorcist trilogy, and when it arrives it will continue the chilling tale after Believer&#39;s harrowing ending. Halloween reboot director David Gordon Green turns his attention to another horror franchise with his plans to create a new sequel The Exorcist trilogy, starting with The Exorcist: Believer, which followed Leslie Odom Jr. (Hamilton) as Victor, a father whose daughter Angela (Lidya Jewett) and her friend Katherine (Olivia Marcum) disappeared into the woods for three days, only to come back possessed.




They enlist the help of Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn), who claims that more than one form of exorcism may be necessary to rid the girls of evil spirits. Sadly, by the end of Believer, the demon Lamashtu&#39;s venture from Hell manages to claim one of the girls â€” an unexpected and sorrowful finale that sets up the story of The Exorcist: Deceiver. The first movie in the rebooted trilogy both brought back characters like Chris from the original 1973 The Exorcist and fleshed out the lore, leaving the door wide open for The Exorcist: Deceiver.


 The Most Recent The Exorcist: Deceiver News 
          

After initial reports indicated that Universal was displeased with The Exorcist: Believer, the latest news sees The Exorcist: Deciever lose its director and release date. Director David Gordon Green, most famous for helming the recent Halloween trilogy, was in charge of Believer, but he has now stepped away from directing duties on the sequel. In an indication that the movie will be undergoing a major reworking, The Exorcist: Deciever has been removed from the calendar and will no longer be released on April 18th, 2025. 






 The Exorcist: Deceiver Is Confirmed 
          

The sequel to The Exorcist: Believer is confirmed. Blumhouse and Universal first announced The Exorcist: Deceiver in July 2023, when the trailer for the first movie in the rebooted trilogy arrived, alongside its release date. However, now the future of the trilogy is a bit more cloudy with the January 2024 announcement that Green has stepped away from the project, and Deceiver has been removed from Universal&#39;s release calendar. This is likely due to The Exorcist: Believer&#39;s critical and commercial failure, something Universal was not expecting from the sure-fire hit.



 The Exorcist: Deceiver Cast 
          




The Exorcist: Deceiver cast has yet to be revealed officially, but could see Leslie Odom Jr. (Central Park) return as Victor, Lidya Jewett (Good Girls) as Angela, newcomer Olivia Marcum as Katherine, and Ellen Burstyn (Requiem for a Dream) as Chris MacNeil. Jennifer Nettles (The Righteous Gemstones) could return as Katherine&#39;s mother Miranda along with her husband, Tony, who is portrayed by Norbert Leo Butz (Dan in Real Life). However, until any official announcements are made, the cast of The Exorcist: Deceiver is entirely speculative.

                  The Exorcist: Believer&#39;s Cast &amp; Character Guide - The Handmaid&#39;s Tale Actor Joins New Reboot   Led by Leslie Odom Jr., The Exorcist: Believer has a talented cast. But what characters are they playing in the new reboot?   



 The Exorcist: Deceiver Story Details 
          




The Exorcist: Deceiver plot is still being kept under wraps. David Gordon Green does reportedly have a story plan for the rebooted The Exorcist trilogy mapped out. However, that all seems in jeopardy considering his departure. The ending of Believer also revealed a few potential plot beats for The Exorcist: Deceiver. Katherine, the daughter of Miranda and Tony, was dragged to Hell by the demon Lamashtu. Tony&#39;s attempts to save his daughter by &#34;choosing&#34; her backfired, as Lamashtu&#39;s offer was a trick. 

Tony and Miranda could struggle to accept that Angela survived when Katherine didn&#39;t, especially since it was Tony&#39;s choice that sealed her fate. Now that they know demons like Lamashtu exist, and that practices like Voodoo, mysticism, and exorcisms are legitimate, there&#39;s no telling what they may try to get their daughter back. What Universal and Blumhouse have planned for the plot of The Exorcist: Deceiver is unclear, but there&#39;s definitely no shortage of directions the story could take.
