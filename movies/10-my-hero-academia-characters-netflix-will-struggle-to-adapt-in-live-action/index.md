## Literature Review

My Hero Academia is coming to Netflix to join the list of anime shows adapted to live-action, but some MHA characters will be tough to translate.




My Hero Academia is getting a Netflix live-action movie adaptation, but Netflix may struggle to bring some of the popular anime characters into a live-action setting. MHA started airing in 2016 and quickly became one of the most popular anime series for Western audiences. The story takes a look at a world where most people have powers, and these powers can be almost anything, but despite most people having powers, precious few become heroes or villains. With the popularity of superhero stories in film and streaming, it&#39;s no wonder that MHA became so popular so quickly.
The series includes six seasons, with a seventh due to air in 2024, and three tie-in movies. Over that time, the cast of heroes and characters has expanded hugely, which will give Netflix plenty of options for characters to adapt. However, some will definitely be harder to feature in a live-action movie adaptation than others, either due to their unusual and inhuman looks, or even their personalities not being suitable for a non-animated project.









 








 10  Fumikage Tokoyami 
Tsukuyomi
        

Tokoyami looks like an average young man. Apart from one striking difference: he has the head of a bird. The head looks similar to a crow or raven with a yellow beak, but, he possesses a regular human body. In addition to struggling to adapt this look for the live-action show, Tokoyami is one of the most powerful heroes in the series, and his quirk, Dark Shadow, projects a large shadow entity from his body which varies in power depending on external light. This shadow ability would also be challenging and costly to create in live-action, which could result in major changes to the character.





 9  Minoru Mineta 
Grape Juice
        

MHA&#39;s Minoru is a challenging character to adapt due to his extremely perverted personality. Mineta is obsessive, invasive, and downright rude in a way that actively causes everyone around him to be uncomfortable and view him negatively. Despite his being a part of Class 1-A, like Tokoyami, Netflix may avoid adapting Mineta at all. While he is in the leading hero class, his powers are not the most useful or unique, and it would be easy to swap him out for someone a little less controversial.
            
 
 10 My Hero Academia Moments That Won&#39;t Look As Good In Live-Action 
My Hero Academia will have some tricky scenes for Netflix to adapt into live action, relying on beautiful animation or a certain art style to work. 








 8  Principal Nezu 
An Animal With A Quirk
        

Nezu is among a very rare group of creatures who are not human, that developed a Quirk. As a result, Nezu was able to integrate with human society and secure a top position at U.A. High School to help train and grow the next generation of heroes. The difficulty comes from the fact that Nezu is also an unspecified animal, with elements of mice, dogs, and bears all combined to create an unusual and unique creature. Add to this that his Quirk, High Specs, grant him superior intelligence, and it makes for a tough character to adapt in live-action.





 7  Toshinori Yagi 
All Might


 







Mostly referred to by his hero name, All Might was the number one ranked hero in the world for a long time. His Quirk, One For All, granted him incredible powers similar to Superman, with a large array of abilities. While finding someone to tackle the Superman-esque character should be straightforward, the fact that All Might reverts into a very tall, lanky, and lean man who is almost indistinguishable from his counterpart may make casting challenging. It&#39;s possible that All Might could even be played by two different actors to fully acknowledge the difference between the hero and the human sides.





 6  Shigaraki 
All For One
        

On of the primary antagonists in the early seasons of MHA, All For One was All Might&#39;s greatest foe. With his Quirk, for which he was also named, granting him the ability to steal others&#39; powers and use them for himself. His quirk also allowed him to redistribute these powers, but for the most part, he held on to them and became an incredibly powerful villain. While his scarred appearance may be fairly straightforward to adapt, it&#39;s primarily his wide array of powers that will make All For One difficult to translate into live-action.





 5  Koji Koda 
Anima
        

Koji is another student of Class 1-A. While his Quirk, Anivoice, grants him the ability to communicate with animals and have them follow his commands, Koji has an appearance that makes him resemble a skin-toned rock. This is most apparent when looking at his head, which has sharp lines with a large protruding spike from the top. This will be challenging to create in live action, partially because of how unsettling it could be to have a person who looks like their head has been replaced by a small skin-toned boulder.
            
 
 8 Challenges Netflix&#39;s Live-Action My Hero Academia Faces Adapting The Anime 
Netflix is hoping to capitalize on the popularity of My Hero Academia, but its live-action adaptation will have numerous challenges to overcome.








 4  Kugo Sakamata 
Gang Orca
        

Gang Orca is the director of the Okuto Island Aquarium, and he acts in the role of a villain to help train the students at U.A. High School. His Quirk, Orcinus, gives him powers and abilities similar to a killer whale, as well as having mutated his body to make him resemble an anthropomorphized killer whale. In addition to his appearance resembling a killer whale, Gang Orca plays into this with his costume which features a cape, tie, and shirt that enhance the animalistic features even further.





 3  Tomura Shigaraki 
All For One&#39;s Successor


 







Young Shigaraki is All For One&#39;s protégé, the ultimate antagonist of the series, and Izuku Midoriya&#39;s archnemesis. For much of the early seasons of the show, Shigaraki does not show his face, using a disembodied hand to cover his visage. While the concept shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to translate to live-action, the creatives will need to strike the right balance with this character and his costume to ensure he is imposing, and intimidating, rather than ridiculous, as it could be if not done correctly.





 2  Ectoplasm 
The Math Teacher
        

Ectoplasm is never seen without his costume, which makes him look like a demonic creature with a wide, always-present grin. The shadowy figure can multiply himself through his Quirk, Clone, and this presumably connects to his love for mathematics. The fact that Ectoplasm will likely need to be replicated repeatedly to make use of his powers means he would be a more costly hero to bring into the live-action adaptation to play a significant role. Because of this, he may appear briefly, but it&#39;s likely other hero teachers will replace him to save on special effects.





 1  Mina Ashido 
Pinky


 







Mina also attends U.A. High School as a member of Class 1-A. She has pink skin, with black eyes and small yellow pupils, as well as thin yellow horns on her head. Mina can secrete acid from her body to use in a number of ways as she also controls how much she releases, the solubility of the acid, and the viscosity. Her unique appearance may provide a challenge to adapt in the My Hero Academia movie for Netflix, but she is a strong part of the team and should definitely be included despite the potential challenges in creating her unique look.
