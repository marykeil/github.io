## Literature Review

Anyone But You is based on a Shakespeare play, but the Sydney Sweeney/Glen Powell rom-com updates this &#39;90s genre convention with a clever twist.




Not only does Anyone But You revive a rom-com trope from the late &#39;90s and early ‘00s, but the movie improves on this convention with a clever new twist. Anyone But You stars Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell as Bea and Ben. A law student and a stockbroker, Bea and Ben meet by chance and share a magical night only for a mutual misunderstanding to leave them both bitter and regretful the next day. The two steer clear of each other but when Ben’s friend gets engaged to Bea’s sister, it becomes clear that the mismatched duo will be seeing a lot more of each other in the future.




If that plot sounds familiar, that might be because Anyone But You is based on Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing. Like that classic comedy, this rom-com sees Bea and Ben forced to pretend that they are dating so that Ben can win back his ex and Bea can discourage her parents from reuniting her with her former fiancée, Jonathan. As if that weren’t complicated enough, Bea and Ben’s friends are also trying to get them together while Bea’s parents attempt to get her back with Jonathan. This results in a charming, chaotic romantic comedy that calls to mind many of the genre’s best ‘90s offerings, but with a twist.


 Anyone But You’s Shakespeare Riff Is R-Rated 
          

Like 10 Things I Hate About You, She’s The Man, and Get Over It, Anyone But You is a Shakespeare adaptation that brings the bard’s work to life in the form of a contemporary rom-com. However, unlike most of the modernized Shakespeare adaptations of the ‘90s and ‘00s, Anyone But You firmly earns its R-rating with swearing, sex, nudity, and some drug use. Anyone But You’s R-rating is an ingenious way of distinguishing the movie from earlier Shakespeare rom-coms, since none of those teen-centric adaptations could feature the raunchier jokes seen throughout the new movie. This makes Anyone But You’s ‘90s revival feel more innovative.




Whether it is Ben’s romantic rival briefly flashing his bare penis or the supporting characters swearing up a storm, Anyone But You never feels like a PG-13 comedy. This is vital since all the aforementioned Shakespeare rom-coms leaned into the adolescent status of their main characters. In Get Over It, a big school production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream mirrors how the main characters unintentionally re-enact the play’s plot in real life. This approach even went on to inspire Anyone But You director Will Gluck’s earlier hit Easy A, which transplanted Nathaniel Hawthorne&#39;s The Scarlet Letter to a high school setting.



 Why Anyone But You Needed Its R-Rating 
          

Although Anyone But You’s ending acknowledges the movie’s creative debt to Shakespeare, the plot itself limits any direct references to the original play to a few onscreen quotations. Since all the earlier Shakespeare rom-coms highlighted their high school settings, Anyone But You bringing the story into adulthood keeps the well-worn ‘90s formula feeling original. With its strict social code and raging hormones, high school is a natural analog to the world of dramatic, mannered Shakespeare. However, Anyone But You’s more grown-up rom-com story proves that the same formula can be applied to adult characters with just as much success.
