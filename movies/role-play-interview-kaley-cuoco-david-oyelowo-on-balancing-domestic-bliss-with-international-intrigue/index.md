Summary

  Prime Video&#39;s upcoming action comedy Role Play, starring Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo, tells the story of a married couple whose lives are turned upside down when dark secrets from their past come to light.   Cuoco and Oyelowo&#39;s chemistry in the film is described as lovely and wholesome, despite the unusual circumstances they find themselves in.   The movie aims to combine comedy, romance, and action, showcasing Cuoco&#39;s range and Oyelowo&#39;s departure from his more serious roles. Directed by Thomas Vincent and written by Seth W. Owen, Role Play promises to be a refreshing and entertaining watch.  





Prime Video&#39;s upcoming action comedy Role Play, which releases on January 12, finds Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo at an unexpected crossroads in their marriage. Cuoco and Oyelowo play Emma and Dave Brackett respectively, a married couple with two kids who have lived happily for the last 7 years with nothing to disturb them outside of Emma&#39;s work trips. The problem is that Dave has no idea his wife&#39;s trips are to assassinate people rather than business deals.




Role Play also stars Bill Nighy and Connie Nielsen in roles that help to expand Emma&#39;s world of spy intrigue, but the movie is aiming for comedy and romance as much as it is action. Nevertheless, it is a step that builds on the range that Cuoco showed in her thriller show The Flight Attendant, as well as a refreshing departure from Oyelowo&#39;s more serious projects such as Lawmen: Bass Reeves. Thomas Vincent (who has previously directed episodes of Bodyguard and Versailles) helms the project from a screenplay penned by Seth W. Owen.

                  Kaley Cuoco’s 10 Best Movie &amp; TV Roles, Ranked According To IMDb   Kaley Cuoco has been all over our favorite movies and television shows throughout her career but a few stand out as the best of the bunch.   

Screen Rant interviewed Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo about stepping into their onscreen marriage for Role Play, and how the new project differs from their previous work.


 Kaley Cuoco &amp; David Oyelowo Talk Role Play 
         




Screen Rant: You two have such lovely chemistry and the marriage is so wholesome, despite the circumstances. How do you guys step into those seven years of lived experience?


Kaley Cuoco: Isn&#39;t that weird how you join a project or whatever, and you have a background that doesn&#39;t really exist? And you kind of have to create. It&#39;s just such a weird thing, right?
David Oyelowo: Yeah. It either works or it doesn&#39;t.
Kaley Cuoco: Yeah, exactly. We fell in love immediately when we met. We were such buds immediately, and it was so actually very easy to dive into these roles together and have the background or the backstory. It just was kind of naturally there.
David Oyelowo: I think we both have a love of family. A love of love, understand the stakes of that, and what it takes to preserve a marriage. That was a lot of our conversation early on; we want that to be the center of what this film is, combined with Kaley going on to have a child. And I have a bunch of kids as well. So all of that was very much a part of on top of the thrills and spills, the action, the thrill of the film generally.





Screen Rant: Kaley, you are a producer on the film as well. What aspect of the project were you most invested in highlighting?


Kaley Cuoco: I have to tell you, I didn&#39;t feel like I had to really take care of much in that way. I was focused as the actor. I was pregnant the whole time too, so there were a lot of different things on my mind. But I had had the script for a long time actually. Many years before I met David. So, I didn&#39;t know how it was going to turn out, and who was going to fill those shoes.
It was an absolute dream when David signed on that grounded this project in such a beautiful way. And I feel like people started noticing it when we heard you were going to be in it, and I was like, &#34;He&#39;s doing it!&#34; Then we trapped him. We never let him go. I was like, &#34;Make him sign and never let him go.&#34; It was just kind of a dream situation.
But it&#39;s funny how these things take a long time to come to fruition. As a producer, as we both know, it&#39;s a long time coming. So, when they finally do, you&#39;re so grateful.





David, you have been doing a lot of roles where your word is law, but this time maybe Kaley gets to take the reins. What&#39;s it like to step back and be the damsel?


David Oyelowo: That was actually what I really loved; that role reversal, in a sense. For me as an actor, I&#39;m always looking for doing things I haven&#39;t done before, and this character is someone you don&#39;t see that often.
Normally, it&#39;s the guy running around doing the action, saving the damsel. But on top of the nature of that role is the fact that he&#39;s still a guy who&#39;s looking to save his wife. Very unqualified to do so, which is part of the fun as well, but has these admirable qualities of just wanting to preserve his marriage and family life. And so those were all things that I really can relate to and loved in the film.


Kaley, you’re doing incredible work [in Harley Quinn]. And we have much more to come, I feel.


Kaley Cuoco: Hell yeah, we do. We&#39;re already starting a new season, and that&#39;s been such fun. I don&#39;t even know how that happened, and it just keeps going and people love it. I love doing it, and people seem to just love it. So, it&#39;ll go on and on as long as they want it. I&#39;m here for it.





Wonderful. See you in 10 years?


Kaley Cuoco: Okay. You got it. You got it. She&#39;s an icon.
