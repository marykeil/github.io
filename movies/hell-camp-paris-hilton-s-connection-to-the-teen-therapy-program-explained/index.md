# Hell Camp Paris Hilton s Connection To The Teen Therapy Program Explained


## SUMMARY 


 

Netflix&#39;s &#34;Hell Camp: Teen Nightmare&#34; exposes the horrifying reality of child rehabilitation programs like Challenger Camp, where teenagers endured abuse and brutality.


Paris Hilton&#39;s participation in the documentary sheds light on her own experiences in a similar program and her advocacy for survivors. She was taken from her home and subjected to abuse for two years.


Including Hilton in the documentary not only gives a platform for a victim to share their story but also attracts a wider audience to educate them about the dangers of such camps.
