## Literature Review

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour breaks a major box office record three months after opening in theaters, reflecting just how popular the concert movie is.




Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour has broken a major box office record three months after its debut in theaters. The concert film focuses on the famous singer&#39;s Eras Tour. The movie showcases the ten &#34;Eras&#34; of her music that are featured in every concert, showcasing a massive performance celebrating her career.




Now, Variety reports that Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour&#39;s box office records now include the highest-grossing concert movie ever released. As of writing, the movie has earned over $261.6 million worldwide, beating out the previous record holder Michael Jackson&#39;s This Is It. The movie only opened in China last week, meaning there&#39;s plenty of time for its box office numbers to keep rising.


 Why The Eras Tour Is Performing So Well 
          

When the movie was first released, it became the highest-grossing concert film domestically during its opening weekend. Now, that record extends to its worldwide performance, showing just how popular Swift’s music is worldwide. This was also reflected by ticket pre-sales, which reached $100 million globally.

Despite still being in theaters worldwide, The Eras Tour’s theater schedule adds to its ability to perform so well. The movie originally only played on Thursdays through Sundays, making its availability limited. However, this accessibility has changed as the movie is now deep into its theatrical run.




                  Taylor Swift&#39;s New Movie Milestone Sets An Impossible Challenge For Beyoncé   It might be impossible for Beyoncé to beat Taylor Swift at the box office with her concert film, but there are other big milestones she could reach.   

Swift’s career is also undergoing a resurgence as the artist re-records her older albums following a dispute over ownership of her older works. The theme of The Eras Tour coincides with these ongoing re-releases, giving people a way to further support her music. With the singer’s popularity coupled with the movie’s continued availability in theaters, it remains to be seen just how high its box office is going to climb.



While re-releasing her older music, Taylor Swift is still producing new albums, such as 2022&#39;s Midnights.
