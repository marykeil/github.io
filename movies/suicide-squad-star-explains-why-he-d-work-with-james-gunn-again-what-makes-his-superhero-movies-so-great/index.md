## Literature Review

One of the actors in James Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad has championed the director&#39;s talent for superhero movies and said he would work with him again.




One of the main stars of The Suicide Squad has spoken out in praise of James Gunn, suggesting that he would work with him again while clarifying why Gunn&#39;s superhero movies are consistently high quality. So far, James Gunn&#39;s superhero movies span both the MCU and DCEU franchises with the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy and The Suicide Squad, while he also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed Peacemaker series and the non-franchise Super. Now, Gunn is spearheading the DCU - a reboot of DC&#39;s cinematic franchise - as the Co-CEO of DC Studios.




Gunn&#39;s talent in the Superhero genre was affirmed by Peter Capaldi, who starred as Thinker in The Suicide Squad, and stated in an interview with Forbes that he would &#34;absolutely&#34; work with Gunn again while praising his passion for comic book characters. Given Gunn&#39;s track record, it comes as no surprise that the filmmaker has a particular affinity for the comic book characters he works with. This affinity is particularly strong for lesser-known characters, something that may be a boon for the future of the DCU. Capaldi&#39;s full comments can be read below:


&#34;Of course, I would, absolutely. James was lovely; I loved working with him. He creates such a great atmosphere on set and is such a nice person to work with. I honestly think James is gifted, clever, and sharp, but I sometimes feel like he&#39;s making a film in his garage. He feels like a guy who would go off at the weekend and make these films because he has such enthusiasm and sincerity about them.&#34;
&#34;I think that&#39;s what makes this work stand out; he means it. He has a meaningful relationship with all these comic book characters; it&#39;s not a commercial relationship. He cares about them, and that&#39;s wonderful.&#34;





                  Predicting 10 Biggest DCU Announcements Of 2024   With all the changes that the DC Universe has faced in 2023, 2024 will likely produce a litany of announcements concerning the franchiseâ€™s future.   


 What&#39;s Next For James Gunn And The New DCU 
          

The release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom spelled the end of the DCEU, which closed with more of a whimper than a bang following a series of box office and critical disappointments. This has put pressure on James Gunn and his DCU to pick up the slack for DC&#39;s cinematic offerings, but things are looking positive. A year&#39;s reprieve will precede the launch of the DCU, which will open with the release of Superman: Legacy in 2025. Gunn recently confirmed that production for the first DCU movie is well underway, while several of its cast and characters have already been confirmed, including David Corenswet in the titular role. 




The movie will be a part of the DCU&#39;s first &#34;chapter,&#34; entitled Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, which will also include The Authority, The Brave and the Bold, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and Swamp Thing. Evidently, Gunn is still pursuing adaptations of less famous properties, promising a fresh take on superhero movies. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, meanwhile, was the last of a trilogy, with Gunn unlikely to return to the MCU now that he is the head of a rival franchise.
