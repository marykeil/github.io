# How James Gunn s DC Universe Is Avoiding The Trap Of Too Many Origin Stories


## SUMMARY 



  The new DC Universe seems to be focusing more on world-building rather than exploring superhero origin stories in too much detail.   Many of the DCU&#39;s new characters will be introduced as already-active heroes, including Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman.   DC Studios wants to create a unique and complex universe, differentiating itself from the DCEU and Marvel Cinematic Universe.

## Literature Review

James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe will introduce many new DC Comics characters into live-action, but will have a very different focus to the previous DCEU.




Spending too much time exploring origin stories can often be detrimental to live-action superhero franchises, but DC Studios&#39; new DC Universe will thankfully avoid this. After filmmaker James Gunn and producer Peter Safran were hired as co-CEOs of DC Studios in November 2022, they immediately set plans in motion to reboot the DCEU into a new franchise based on the stories of DC Comics. Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck and the other Justice League actors were dropped, while ten projects were quickly confirmed for the new franchise, but the slate for the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34;, proves that Gunn and Safran are trying to avoid typical superhero franchise mistakes.




In June 2023, Hollywood star David Corenswet was cast as the DCU&#39;s Clark Kent, a.k.a. Superman, for the new franchise&#39;s first feature film, 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy. The film will be preceded by the Creature Commandos and Waller shows, while subsequent projects including The Brave and the Bold, The Authority, Paradise Lost, Booster Gold and Lanterns will expand the DCU even further. The wide variety of characters being featured in the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1 suggests that DC Studios is putting more focus on world-building than the DCEU ever did, creating a colorful and complex universe for these superpowered characters to inhabit, which avoids one major issue with recent live-action superhero projects.

                  Which Old DC Movies Are Canon In The DCU   James Gunn has announced the first chapter of his new DCU, which appears to indicate the standing of several DCEU projects in his new canon.   


 The DCU&#39;s Release Roster Builds Up Its World Without Origin Stories 
         




The ten projects confirmed to be set in the new DC Universe by James Gunn in January 2023 seem to prove that the new franchise will be looking to build up the context of the wider world rather than focusing so much on its heroes&#39; backstories. There&#39;s no doubt origin stories will still be explored, but many of the DCU&#39;s new characters are expected to be introduced as already-active heroes. For instance, Clark Kent will be depicted as a reporter in Superman: Legacy, already working for the Daily Planet alongside Rachel Brosnahan&#39;s Lois Lane, so his childhood and early experiences as Superman may not be the focus of the project.

This is also the case for iconic heroes such as Bruce Wayne&#39;s Batman and Diana Prince&#39;s Wonder Woman. Matt Reeves&#39; Arkham Asylum-set series has been confirmed to be part of the DCU, and will presumably release before The Brave and the Bold introduces the new iteration of Batman, and the same goes for the DCU&#39;s Paradise Lost, which will explore Themyscira and the Amazons before introducing Wonder Woman. This means that the worlds of Gotham City and Themyscira will be fully established prior to their signature heroes&#39; debuts. The same goes for the Green Lanterns, the Authority, the Creature Commandos and Supergirl, who will debut in Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.






 Why The DCU Is Better Off Avoiding Using Too Many Origin Stories 
          

The DCEU arguably focused too much on its heroes, without providing enough context to the world they were inhabiting. This is something that Gunn and Safran are actively trying to avoid with the new DC Universe, as locations, events and supporting characters are expected to be developed before the superheroes appear. This will ensure that the DC Universe feels different to both the DCEU and the Marvel Cinematic Universe - which has done a fairly good job of world-building - and avoids becoming a carbon copy of these other franchises. With superhero projects receiving more criticism now than ever before, DC Studios would be smart to try something completely new.
