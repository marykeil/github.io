## Literature Review

Director Chad Stahelski reveals that one impressive shot featured in John Wick: Chapter 4 came together with the help of a real royal figure.




John Wick: Chapter 4 director Chad Stahelski reveals that an actual king had a hand in bringing one of the film&#39;s most breathtaking shots to life. Keanu Reeves&#39; titular assassin returned for a fourth outing last spring, fighting to take down the High Table and earn his freedom in the most action-packed installment yet. The John Wick: Chapter 4 reviews didn&#39;t just praise the movie&#39;s action, however, with the cinematography and on-location shooting also contributing to the sequel&#39;s epic presentation.




During a recent watch-a-long episode of the Happy Sad Confused podcast with Josh Horowitz, Stahelski breaks down the scenes of John Wick: Chapter 4, including the film&#39;s impressive opening desert sequence as Wick hunts the Elder.


 

The director reveals that not only did the sequence involve on-location shooting in the Middle East, but that a royal figure played a role in helping the production capture a desert sunrise. Check out Stahelski&#39;s full comment below:



“That is an actual sunrise in the Jordanian desert outside of Aqaba and Wadi Rum, so that’s not digital. I’m very proud of that. The King of Jordan lent us a helicopter to go out in the middle of the desert to get this sunrise shot.



  





 How John Wick: Chapter 4 Elevates Action 
          

The first installment in the hit action franchise, released in 2014, became a surprise hit, with the film featuring a level and style of action not often seen in Hollywood, and all on a fairly modest budget. It was clear from the first installment, however, that Stahelski had ambitions that went beyond just the action. These ambitions became more prominent in subsequent John Wick films, each more grand and balletic than the last.

John Wick: Chapter 4 is, by far, the most epic installment in the franchise, featuring sweeping vistas, breathtaking real locations, and cinematography and set design not typically featured in the action genre. The film&#39;s opening desert sequence is reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia in its presentation, and other action set pieces use real locations in Japan, Berlin, and France to stunning effect. The Sacré Coeur sequence toward the John Wick: Chapter 4 ending, for example, is entirely built around a 222-step staircase, and it was all filmed on-location.






While many scenes from the film were shot on-location or using impressive sets, the film&#39;s ending pistol duel at sunrise does feature some very obvious VFX work, which has been the source of some criticism.




While so many modern Hollywood action movies rely heavily on green screen, the John Wick: Chapter 4 filming locations make the action feel more epic. Even interior scenes, like those featured during the Osaka Continental Hotel sequence, are elevated by bold set design and effective and inventive use of space. While the action choreography itself is one of John Wick: Chapter 4&#39;s biggest and most obvious strengths, the film is also a testament to how powerful action can be when complemented by masterful cinematography and on-location shooting.
