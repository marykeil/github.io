James Gunn has addressed the new Batman casting rumor for the DC Universe, reacting to a possible Bruce Wayne appearance in Superman: Legacy.

Still, many rumors have come out about the DCU Batman, and the latest of them included a movie star playing Bruce in the Superman reboot.

Jensen Ackles is the leading favorite among fans to play the DCU&#39;s Batman. The actor has shown his desire to play the character on multiple occasions and has the physicality and acting skills for the role. Besides, Ackles is the current voice of Batman in DC&#39;s animated Tomorrowverse continuity. While there is a lot in the actor&#39;s favor, Gunn debunked a rumor that Ackles had been cast as the DCU&#39;s Batman.

Ackles&#39; casting as Batman would not be the only DCU rumor regarding who would play Bruce Wayne to be debunked by Gunn. The DCU&#39;s creative chief also revealed there was no truth to the claim that John Krasinski would play Batman. Gunn explained that The Brave and the Bold had no script yet, which made casting Batman for the film impossible.

Gunn also debunked the possible returns of Batman actors Robert Pattinson and George Clooney as the DCU&#39;s Bruce Wayne. Clooney&#39;s cameo in The Flash ended up generating some confusion; however, it was just a fun moment. In Pattinson&#39;s case, Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman universe will exist as an Elseworlds story, separate from the DCU canon. Lately, rumors about Reacher&#39;s Alan Ritchson playing Batman have gained traction. It remains to be seen if Gosling or any of the rumored actors will play the DCU Batman in The Brave and the Bold.
