# Mattel s Real Weird Barbie Doll Misses The Point Of Kate McKinnon s Movie Character


## SUMMARY 



  Mattel missed the point of Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie with their release of a Weird Barbie doll, which looks like McKinnon&#39;s character.   The release of a doll based on Kate McKinnon&#39;s Weird Barbie character implies that Mattel doesn&#39;t grasp the true meaning of the character and its importance.   Mattel&#39;s selling of a Weird Barbie doll goes against what made the character special, as they treat it like any other doll launch, just like the executives in the movie.

## Literature Review

Mattel is officially releasing a doll based on Kate McKinnon’s Weird Barbie character, but the release shows the company doesn’t understand the movie.




Kate McKinnon&#39;s &#34;Weird Barbie&#34; was a highlight of Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie, but the fact that Mattel is now selling a Weird Barbie doll proves the company completely missed the point of the movie. McKinnon&#39;s character was pivotal in leading Margot Robbie&#39;s &#34;Stereotypical Barbie&#34; down a path of self-discovery involving the real world and Barbieland. Unlike many of the more traditional and notable versions of Barbie, McKinnon&#39;s Barbie was meant to represent iterations of the dolls that have been passionately played with or altered by their owners, considering her chopped spiky hair and marker-printed face and dress.




Even well before Barbie&#39;s July 2023 release, Mattel and Warner Bros. put a lot of effort into advertising. Barbie&#39;s marketing has been one of the most extensive in recent memory, with an array of promotional campaigns, PR stunts, and merchandise tie-ins. Now that Barbie is the highest-grossing movie of the year (via Box Office Mojo), even more merchandise has been hitting shelves and websites, including the &#34;I am Kenough&#34; hoodie worn by Ryan Gosling&#39;s Ken. However, one of the most interesting products being released is an exclusive edition of a doll based on McKinnon&#39;s Weird Barbie character. While it makes sense that the character would inspire toys and merchandise, the release implies that Mattel truly doesn&#39;t understand the point of the character.

 Mattel Selling A Version Of Kate McKinnon&#39;s Character Goes Against What Makes &#34;Weird Barbie&#34; So Special 
Mattel Accidentally Portrayed Themselves Like The Executives In The Movie
          

 The Weird Barbie doll is being sold for $50 (via Mattel) and is being advertised to celebrate McKinnon&#39;s breakout Barbie character. However, the fact that Mattel is selling and profiting off a doll meant to embrace individual creativity and unique qualities proves the point of Weird Barbie went right over the company&#39;s head. Weird Barbie was shown as an outcast living in her own modified Dreamhouse with discontinued dolls since they didn&#39;t fit the norms and standardized looks of traditional Barbies and Kens. Her influence helped the other Barbies learn the value of acceptance and the need for change when it came to Barbieland&#39;s societal norms.

 Barbie Box Office     Domestic  $636,228,022   International  $805,600,000   Gross  $1,441,828,022   






Mattel&#39;s Weird Barbie doll looks almost toned down when it comes to the &#34;weird&#34; factor. It&#39;s as if Mattel made the doll look more traditional, going against what made McKinnon&#39;s character so meaningful in Barbie. By treating Weird Barbie like any other doll launch, Mattel is acting more like the executives featured in the movie, who were more focused on finding new versions of dolls to sell rather than acknowledging the real thematic messages the characters represented.



Barbie is available to rent on Apple TV.






 How Mattel Should Have Released Weird Barbie Instead 
Embracing The Individuality Aspect Of The Character Would Have Been Better
         

If Mattel wanted to truly acknowledge the point of Weird Barbie and sell a doll based on the character, there was a much better way to do it. To encourage individuality and personal &#34;weirdness,&#34; Mattel should have sold a customizable Barbie equipped with markers and safe tools. This would have allowed kids and collectors to customize their own dolls as a way to emulate what made Weird Barbie&#39;s DIY element so special.




Even so, there&#39;s also an argument to be said that Weird Barbie shouldn&#39;t be sold at all because it essentially groups her into the more mainstream dolls. Being sold in the final form customized by someone else isn&#39;t what Weird Barbie represents. Barbie may have passed the $1 billion mark at the box office and earned nine Golden Globe nominations, but Mattel doesn&#39;t need to transform every aspect of the movie into a piece of merchandise, especially when it loses the primary message surrounding the character in the process.
