# What 2024 s SAG Awards Nominations Mean For The Best Picture Oscars Race


## SUMMARY 



  SAG Awards nominations can provide insight into which movies are likely to receive Best Picture nominations at the 2024 Oscars.   Winning the SAG Awards&#39; Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture category often leads to Best Picture success at the Oscars.   While SAG nominations can boost a film&#39;s chances, they do not guarantee a Best Picture nomination, and some nominees may miss out.

## Literature Review

The SAG Awards nominations will have a big impact on the Best Picture Oscars race in 2024. Here&#39;s what it means for the five nominated movies.




The 2024 Oscars are approaching, and the announced SAG Awards nominations provide a better idea of which movies will get Best Picture nominations. The race to win the biggest Academy Award has been largely viewed through the lens that a few different 2023 movies are the main contenders for the prize. Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Barbie are among the titles that have long been seen as frontrunners to be nominated and potentially win. The likelihood of that happening for them, and for other movies, shifts throughout the awards season thanks to the momentum and buzz that precursor awards can create ahead of the 2024 Oscars nominations.




The SAG Awards are typically viewed as one of the strongest Oscars precursors for a number of categories. There is usually plenty of crossover between the acting nominees between the two awards since there is great overlap among the SAG and Oscars voters. A movie getting nominated in any of the four main acting categories is always helpful when making the case for the film receiving a Best Picture nomination too. However, there is a particular SAG Awards category that is often quite predictive, making the newly announced nominations have a significant impact on the 2024 Oscars Best Picture race.

                  Oppenheimer Just Took A Big Step Towards Breaking Nolan&#39;s Oscars Streak (But Has An Unexpected New Challenger)   Christopher Nolan has never won an Oscar from his 12 movies, but Oppenheimer could break his streak with wins for both Best Director and Best Picture.   


 The SAG Ensemble Cast Award Is Most Important For The Oscars 
          




The SAG Awards recognize movies and TV shows in a variety of categories. While the awards show does not have its own designated Best Movie category, Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture is the biggest award offered. The category effectively works as a Best Ensemble Cast award and is used by the SAG Awards to recognize the movies with the best cast. Considering actors, many of whom are part of SAG&#39;s voting body too, make up the largest percentage of Academy Award voters, a Best Ensemble SAG nomination or win typically goes a long way in determining the Best Picture outcome.

Since the SAG Awards implemented the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture category in 1995, the winner has also won Best Picture just over 50 percent of the time. Of the 27 movies to win the SAG Best Ensemble award, 14 went on to also win Best Picture at the Oscars. The success rate of SAG predicting the Best Picture winner has been much stronger in recent years, though, as three out of the last four years have matched. That could be great news for whichever 2024 SAG nominees - Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Barbie, American Fiction, and The Color Purple - win.






 A SAG Cast Nomination Does Not Guarantee A Best Picture Oscar Nomination 
          

The five movies nominated for the SAG Awards&#39; ensemble category should all feel much better about their Best Picture chances. However, this is not a guarantee that all five movies will receive nominations from the Academy. Over the last nine years, at least one movie that was nominated for SAG&#39;s Best Ensemble Cast category did not receive a Best Picture Oscars nomination. One reason for this is that Best Picture nominations are voted on by the entire Oscars voting body, so writers, directors, producers, and other members can significantly sway the field of 10 nominees.

This sets a precedent that Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, Barbie, American Fiction, or The Color Purple are not set in place when it comes to the Best Picture race. These titles would have to break recent historical trends for them all to get in. 2014 was the last time all five SAG nominees got Oscar nominations. In fact, all five SAG Best Ensemble Cast nominees also got Best Picture nominations has only happened three times ever, in 2014, 2010, and 2001. That strengthens the case that at least one movie among the 2024 SAG Awards nominees will miss out on the Oscars&#39; biggest category.






 Which 2024 SAG Awards Nominees Will &amp; Won&#39;t Get Best Picture Nominations 
          

Looking at the five movies nominated for the SAG Awards&#39; Best Ensemble Cast award, there is a fairly clear difference in the films&#39; Best Picture chances. Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Barbie are all seen as locks to be among the 10 nominees in 2024. Christopher Nolan&#39;s film, in particular, is viewed as the frontrunner to win the category, while the live-action Barbie movie is also gaining momentum. Martin Scorsese&#39;s chances of winning Oscars for Killers of the Flower Moon might be dwindling, but the movie is still largely expected to play with Oscar voters and be recognized with a Best Picture nomination.

That leaves American Fiction and The Color Purple as the movies on the bubble of being part of the 2024 Oscars Best Picture race. Between the two movies, American Fiction seems to have a stronger case to earn a nomination. The movie has been praised for Jeffrey Wright and Sterling K. Brown&#39;s performances, as well as Cord Jefferson&#39;s writing and directing. The Color Purple has also been met with favorable remarks, but it currently lacks the expected momentum for a Best Picture nominee, despite coming out right at the end of 2023.




There&#39;s a chance American Fiction and The Color Purple both miss out on Best Picture nominations at the 2024 Oscars. If only one of these SAG nominees misses, it probably would be The Color Purple at this point. American Fiction is coming on stronger, with even its SAG Awards nomination in Best Ensemble Cast coming as a bit of a surprise.
