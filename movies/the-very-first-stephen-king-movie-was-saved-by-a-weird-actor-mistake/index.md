# The Very First Stephen King Movie Was Saved By A Weird Actor Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Piper Laurie&#39;s misunderstanding of the script led to an over-the-top and memorable performance as Margaret White, Carrie&#39;s mother.   The campy and exaggerated tone of the film made the bleak story more digestible and balanced.   John Travolta and Nancy Allen also misunderstood the tone, adding to the film&#39;s unintentional comedic villainy.

## Literature Review

Stephen King&#39;s earliest movie adaptation Carrie was elevated by one superb central performance, but this stellar turn came about entirely by accident.




While Stephen King’s debut novel Carrie was turned into a highly successful adaptation by director Brian De Palma, one of the movie’s best decisions was a fortunate mistake by an actor. Stephen King has played an outsized role in the history of modern horror, and his influence is so vast that it is tough to remember a time when he was an unknown young author. However, in 1974, publishers took a big chance on King when they offered the writer a huge advance for his debut novel, Carrie. King got lucky once again when director Brian De Palma was hired to adapt Carrie as a film a year later.




Although King was paid little for Carrie’s movie rights, the author was still fortunate that De Palma was selected to bring his epistolary novel to life. Carrie was a popular book upon its original release, but the massive success of its movie adaptation made King a household name. Carrie also boosted the career of its leading lady Sissy Spacek, supporting stars like John Travolta, Nancy Allen, and PJ Soles, and the directorial bona fides of De Palma. However, much of the movie’s success came down to a surprising, lucky accident on the part of one major star, who completely misunderstood the movie’s tone.


 Piper Laurie Thought Stephen King’s Carrie Was A Comedy 
          

Piper Laurie’s acclaimed supporting role as Carrie’s religious mother Margaret White was a lucky accident. Margaret is a rare horror murder victim who is worse than the villain, an unhinged zealot who abuses her daughter and uses her faith as an excuse to torment the poor girl. It is no surprise that most audience members celebrate the moment when Carrie finally uses her psychic powers to brutally kill her overbearing, callously cruel mother. Ironically, Laurie misread the tone of Carrie&#39;s script and played the role for laughs, initially hating the script before she considered that Brian De Palma often injected his movies with dark humor. Her misunderstanding made Margaret White the unforgettably over-the-top monster that viewers love to hate.




This exaggerated approach worked much better than might reasonably have been expected, earning the screen veteran a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her part in the adaptation. Laurie’s larger-than-life take on Margaret paired perfectly with De Palma’s flashy filmmaking style, ensuring that Carrie had a campy tone which made its bleak story easier to digest. A straightforward adaptation of King’s novel could easily have become unbearably grim, but the director’s technical bravura and the wild-eyed evil of Laurie’s performance both meant that Carrie never felt too heavy or self-serious. This was a balance that Carrie’s more grounded 2013 remake struggled to repeat.



 Carrie’s Supporting Cast Were Confused By Its Tone 
          

Allegedly, Carrie’s supporting stars John Travolta and Nancy Allen also thought they were playing comic relief characters, not realizing that they were straight-up villains until they saw the finished movie. This is fairly evident in the movie, with both Billy and Chris acting more like overgrown spoiled children than the violent sociopaths that they are. Again, this misapprehension worked to improve both Allen and Travolta’s performances. Since Carrie is sheltered from the outside world and the movie is told from her perspective, it makes sense for her bullies to seem like outlandish, exaggerated monsters. Thus, the first Stephen King adaptation Carrie succeeded in part because of a lucky accident.
