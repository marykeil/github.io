## Literature Review

Detailed new DC Universe fan concept art imagines Jensen Ackles as The Brave and The Bold&#39;s Batman teaming up with David Corenswet&#39;s Superman.




Jensen Ackles becomes Batman alongside David Corenswet&#39;s Superman in exciting DC Universe fan concept art. Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy will be the first among the upcoming DCU movies, starting the shared universe with a fresh take on the Man of Steel. While a Batman reboot will come in the form of DC&#39;s The Brave and the Bold movie, no actor has signed on to play the DCU&#39;s Bruce Wayne. While that does not happen, fans have suggested who should play the DCU&#39;s Batman, and Ackles is the clear favorite at the moment.




Thinking about that, artist @21xfour took to Instagram to share their concept art for what Corenswet&#39;s Superman and Ackles as Batman in the new DC Universe could look like.


 

The fan concept art imagines the DCU&#39;s World&#39;s Finest, with Corenswet&#39;s Superman donning the Man of Steel&#39;s iconic trunks and Ackles&#39; Batman sporting a sleek Batsuit. While James Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy has a set date to introduce Corenswet&#39;s Superman, Batman has no confirmed date to debut in the new DCU.

                  What We Know About Superman&#39;s Costume In The DCU Reboot So Far   Excitement is building for Superman: Legacy&#39;s costume reveal, and with the movie shooting in 3 months, here are all the known details about the suit.   


 When Could Batman &amp; Superman Appear Together In The New DC Universe 
          




Corenswet will debut as Clark Kent in the DCU&#39;s first movie, Superman: Legacy. The Superman reboot film will arrive in 2025. While Superman: Legacy will include DCU heroes such as the Guy Gardner version of Green Lantern, played by longtime Gunn collaborator Nathan Fillion, Edi Gathegi&#39;s Mister Terrific, and more, Corenswet&#39;s Superman debut movie will not include Batman.

Back in January 2023, Gunn announced that the DCU&#39;s introduction of Batman would happen in The Brave and the Bold. The movie will be directed by The Flash&#39;s Andy Muschietti, who will tell the story of Bruce Wayne discovering that he has a young son, Damian, and getting to know him. With other members of the Bat-Family said to be in the film by Gunn, The Brave and the Bold is looking too crowded to feature Batman&#39;s first meeting with Superman.

Going by Superman: Legacy&#39;s 2025 release date and the fact that director Matt Reeves&#39; Elseworlds movie The Batman - Part II already releases that year, The Brave and the Bold could be looking at a 2026 or 2027 release. Without any clear crossover project on the announced DCU slate so far, the DCU&#39;s meeting between Batman and Superman is realistically looking at a 2028 or 2029 date. Either a World&#39;s Finest movie or a Justice League reboot could feature Corenswet&#39;s Superman working together with the DCU&#39;s Batman, be it Ackles or somebody else in the role.






Superman: Legacy releases on July 11, 2025. The Brave and the Bold still has no release date set.
