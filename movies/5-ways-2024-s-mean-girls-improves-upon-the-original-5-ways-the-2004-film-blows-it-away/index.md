## Literature Review

It&#39;s a girl world. While the 2024 Mean Girls movie musical improves on the 2004 version in some ways, some parts are just better in the original.




The new Mean Girls movie musical adaptation is out, and while it surprisingly improves upon a few things from the original, there are other elements from the beloved 2004 movie that just can&#39;t be topped. Twenty years after the release of the original movie, 2024 saw a movie adaptation of the Mean Girls Broadway musical based on the 2004 movie. Both the original movie and the book for the Broadway musical come from the mind of brilliant comedian Tina Fey. 
Fey wrote both versions of Mean Girls and also starred in the original as teacher Sharon Norbury, reprising her role for the 2024 release. While the movie musical version has the same story as the original, the 2024 Mean Girls has its differences beyond the show tunes sprinkled throughout the movie. It&#39;s a risky move to change things; the 2004 movie is still loved by all. Still, while there are parts in the original that were much better, there are some moments in the new musical adaptation that actually improve upon the original movie.









 








 10  Improvement: Ms. Norbury And Principal Duvall Are A Couple 
The first movie hinted at a possible relationship between the two teachers.
        

In the original Mean Girls, one subplot saw a possible relationship between math teacher Ms. Norbury (Fey) and Principal Duvall (Tim Meadows). Like Fey, Meadows also returned to play the role after being a great supporting part of the Mean Girls 2004 cast. The original saw some flirting and tension between the two, which was especially noticeable in one scene that saw Norbury get wet and, while trying to remove her sweater, pull her entire top up with it just as Duvall entered the room.
One small change in the 2024 version ended up making the characters even better than in the original when it&#39;s revealed that the two are married. After the Burn Book is spread across the school, Principal Duvall tries to address the girls of the school, but when he fails to gain control, he begs Norbury to take over with the promise of taking their dog out when they get home. Even though it&#39;s not a huge plot point, it was a nice and refreshing change for a new era of Mean Girls and not one that ruined either of their characters in the process.





 9  Better In The Original: Janis And Regina&#39;s Backstory 
The demise of their friendship is overcomplicated in the new movie.
        

The 2024 Mean Girls saw a change in the backstories of Janis (Auliʻi Cravalho) and Regina (Reneé Rapp). In the original, the two were once friends, but Janis broke away from the head Plastic after she caused her to be ostracized from the rest of the student body by accusing her of being a lesbian. However, the 2024 version saw a different narrative of what caused the breakdown in their friendship, mainly because Janis is canonically a lesbian this time.
Rather than Regina using her words, there is instead an odd story revolving around a plushie that Janis created and Regina mocked by giving it a homophobic nickname. While it didn&#39;t shift the plot and still had the same result, the introduction of this little detail felt farfetched and odd. It put too much focus on the stuffed animal, rather than Regina&#39;s actions, which ruined the moment.





 8  Improvement: Janis Is Officially Gay 
The original Mean Girls hinted at her sexuality but didn&#39;t overtly address it.
        

While the original Mean Girls saw Janis subjected to multiple rumors and implications of being gay, in the 2024 movie, she is a lesbian. Of course, the original did repeatedly imply this, but it was never officially acknowledged. The new version sees Janis as being proudly open about her sexuality, even anchoring one show-stopping song on the Mean Girls soundtrack about how women treat each other. The 2024 Mean Girls made a point to update some of the elements from the original that haven&#39;t aged as well, so it&#39;s no surprise that Janis&#39; sexuality was acknowledged. It&#39;s still exciting to see, however.





 7  Better In The Original: Cady&#39;s Family Structure 
Mean Girls 2024 didn&#39;t include Cady&#39;s dad.
        

The absence of Cady&#39;s (Angourie Rice) father, Mr. Heron, in the new Mean Girls was noticeable. In the original, the role was portrayed by Scrubs star Neil Flynn, but the 2024 movie didn&#39;t include him, only Mrs. Heron (Jenna Fischer). The presence of Cady&#39;s father in the original may not have initially seemed impactful, but he did offer support for his daughter while she went through her rebellious phase. His omission undermines some of the family dynamics of the original. In the 2004 movie, Mr. Heron provided some rather funny moments, such as not realizing that Cady being grounded meant that she wasn&#39;t allowed out of the house.





 6  Improvement: A More Diverse Cast 
The musical adaptation saw more variation in its casting.


 







One of the biggest changes in the Mean Girls movie musical is the diversity seen in the cast. In the original, a majority of the cast was white, with notable exceptions being Duvall and Kevin (Rajiv Surendra). The musical is much more refreshing in its inclusivity, such as Gretchen (Bebe Wood) making references to her Latinx heritage. There are also name changes for some characters, such as Karen (Avantika), who goes from being Karen Smith to Karen Shetty, and Janis, who goes from being Janis Ian to Janis &#39;Imi&#39;ike. Both of these name changes go along with the ethnicities of the actresses, with Avantika being of Indian heritage and Cravalho of Hawaiian.





 5  Better In The Original: The Introduction Of The Plastics 
Karen&#39;s &amp; Gretchen&#39;s first moments were skipped over in the new movie.


 







One of the original&#39;s most memorable scenes is the introduction of the Plastics, which saw the iconic Mean Girls quote about Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) &#34;That&#39;s why her hair is so big. It&#39;s full of secrets.&#34; However, the 2024 version cut Karen and Gretchen&#39;s introductions to focus on Regina. While Regina&#39;s minions still had prominent roles in the film, the lack of Janis&#39; and Damian&#39;s (Jaquel Spivey) descriptions of them dropped the opportunity for a hilarious moment while also fleshing out the rest of the Plastics. Even though Regina is clearly the leader of the pack, the new version&#39;s introduction to the Plastics makes it clear Karen and Gretchen aren&#39;t as important.





 4  Improvement: Cady&#39;s Apology 
Mean Girls 2024 made Cady and Regina&#39;s reconciliation much more sincere.
        

The 2024 Mean Girls ending saw an additional scene that didn&#39;t feature in the original. In the original, Cady (Lindsay Lohan) and Regina (Rachel McAdams) put their drama to bed through Cady&#39;s speech, but the 2024 movie musical had a dedicated scene for this. Following the math competition, Cady and Regina have a one-on-one conversation in the bathroom, brilliantly expanding this part of the story. Cady apologizes for her actions, but what makes this scene so hilarious is Regina accepting it while high on painkillers. While it still resulted in the same outcome, it was great to see a more upfront and genuine attempt from Cady to make things right.





 3  Better In The Original: How Everyone Found The Burn Book 
The Mean Girls climax wasn&#39;t as funny in the 2024 version.
        

It makes sense for social media to be included in the 2024 Mean Girls, especially as it&#39;s set in the present day, where it&#39;s such an essential tool. Unfortunately, however, it made the spreading of the Burn Book pages less impactful. In the original, Regina makes hundreds of copies of the pages and drops them throughout the halls of the high school for everyone to find in a move that sets off chaos throughout the school.
However, in the new movie, just the book itself is left. Through the power of social media, the students then share all the cruel things that have been written in it, and it goes viral. It all ended in the same hurtful gossip as the original. But the new scene doesn&#39;t have the same visual impact as the scene in the original of the pages fluttering through the air as the students fight each other.





 2  Improvement: The Difference In Aaron Samuels 
He has less focus but more character.


 







While Johnathan Bennett&#39;s portrayal of Aaron Samuels was iconic in its own right, Christopher Briney&#39;s interpretation may be even better. The original Mean Girls saw Aaron as a jock whose academic knowledge was lacking at times. However, this wasn&#39;t the worst thing, considering Cady was only seeking tutoring from him to get closer to him.
However, Briney&#39;s Aaron is a lot more sensitive. He is less of an airhead compared to his predecessor and significantly better at math, but still worse than Cady. Even though Aaron is less of a prominent character than he was in the original, this shift in characterization is a refreshing change and makes it feel that Aaron is more of a person rather than just a trope of the male, attractive romantic interest.





 1  Better In The Original: The Future Of The Plastics 
What happens to their friendship after the Spring Fling is left open.
        

While the 2024 Mean Girls was a great film, it lacks the closure that the original gave. The original had scenes dedicated to showing what happened after the events of the Spring Fling, with Cady reuniting with Janis and Damian, Regina refocusing her anger into playing lacrosse, Gretchen finding a new clique to follow, and Karen becoming the school&#39;s weatherperson. However, the 2024 version ended with everyone dancing together after Cady&#39;s speech, leaving the future of the Plastics uncertain. There is a brief post-credit scene in Mean Girls that sees Regina and Karen chatting, but it&#39;s not clear whether this is just a brief moment or the start of true reconciliation.
