# 10 Times The MCU Made Marvel Villains Look Terrible


## SUMMARY 


 Marvel Studios&#39; villains often display moments of weakness, emotion, or empathy, making them seem much less imposing. 
 Examples include Sonny Burch being rendered inept by truth serum and Trevor Slattery being revealed as a bumbling actor in 
Iron Man 3. 
 Even powerful villains like Baron Strucker, Loki, the High Evolutionary and Kingpin have been easily defeated or brought down by their adversaries.

## Literature Review

Many powerful villains have been introduced to the MCU over the years, but some have often been made to seem weak and much less threatening.




Many villains in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have moments that have made them seem incredibly weak and much less threatening. Over the last decade-and-a-half, Marvel Studios has created the most successful and expansive superhero franchise in cinema history, spanning over forty projects, and adapting dozens of powerful superheroes from Marvel Comics into the live-action MCU. However, no good superhero story would happen without formidable villains, and Marvel Studios has also done a brilliant job of delivering some incredibly threatening adversaries, but these foes don&#39;t come without their own glaring flaws.
While the likes of the Mad Titan Thanos and Kang the Conqueror have posed significant threats to the Infinity Saga and Multiverse Saga, respectively, each new project in the MCU showcases their own powerful villains. These enemies can&#39;t display sheer strength all the time, however, and there have been many moments where villains have demonstrated emotion, weakness or even empathy, which often makes them seem far less imposing, and sometimes even scarily human. From Ant-Man and the Wasp&#39;s Sonny Burch to the Asgardian God of Mischief Loki in The Avengers, Marvel Studios&#39; villains have regularly been made to seem small and easily-defeated.
            
 
 Every MCU Main Villain &amp; Whether They&#39;re Alive, Dead, Or Unknown 
The Marvel Cinematic Universe has adapted a number of Marvel Comics villains, but what became of each of them in their MCU appearances?












 








 10  Sonny Burch Was Rendered Inept By Truth Serum 
Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp (2018)
        

After battling Darren Cross&#39; Yellowjacket in his MCU debut, Paul Rudd&#39;s Scott Lang took on a few minor villains in 2018&#39;s Ant-Man and the Wasp. Ghost posed her own set of problems to Ant-Man, but it was businessman and black market dealer Sonny Burch who showcased his own flaws in the Phase 3 palate cleanser. While trying to track down Hank Pym and Hope Van Dyne in their portable laboratory, Burch and his team presented a truth serum, which would turn out to be their downfall when they themselves were given the concoction. This led to them admitting to the crimes they&#39;d committed, incriminating themselves, and making them seem ridiculous.





 9  Trevor Slattery Was A Bumbling Actor, Not The Mandarin 
Iron Man 3 (2013)
        

Iron Man 3 almost paid off years of teases hinting at the introduction of the MCU&#39;s Mandarin, but fumbled at the last minute. Throughout the Phase 2 project, Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Tony Stark fought back against the suspected Mandarin, who had apparently been committing terrorist attacks in the United States. However, upon reaching the Mandarin&#39;s Miami compound, Stark realized the supervillain was actually British actor Trevor Slattery playing the role. While entertaining, this was an incredibly disappointing twist, and while Slattery returned alongside Marvel Studios&#39; real Mandarin in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Iron Man would never get the chance to fight his Marvel Comics archenemy.





 8  Justin Hammer Was Belittled By Ivan Vanko 
Iron Man 2 (2010)


 







Justin Hammer is one of Iron Man&#39;s most persistent enemies in Marvel Comics, as he is the business rival of Tony Stark, and has influence over a number of powerful villains that he aims at the armored Avenger. Unfortunately, Sam Rockwell&#39;s Justin Hammer was constantly undermined and belittled in 2010&#39;s Iron Man 2 by one of the villains he employed to bring down Iron Man. Ivan Vanko made Hammer seem insignificant and inconsequential, and Hammer&#39;s own fate was played off as a joke in the All Hail the King One Shot, but perhaps his return in the MCU&#39;s upcoming Armor Wars could help to redeem him from these past disappointments.
Justin Hammer hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed to be returning for the MCU&#39;s Armor Wars, but his reappearance has been heavily rumored, and Sam Rockwell&#39;s return to voice the character in 2023&#39;s What If...? season 2 could hint at his willingness to rejoin Marvel Studios&#39; live-action storylines. 






 7  Baron Strucker Surrendered To The Avengers 
Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)
        

The post-credits scene of 2014&#39;s Captain America: The Winter Soldier introduced Baron Wolfgang von Strucker to the MCU, debuting as the mastermind behind the experiment that created Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. This moment teased Strucker having considerable power and influence, but his next appearance in 2015&#39;s Avengers: Age of Ultron saw him quickly surrender to the Avengers shortly before he was killed by Ultron. Strucker could have been the face of HYDRA in the MCU&#39;s modern-day storylines, but his hasty surrender made him out to be nothing more than a coward - certainly not a steadfast ruler such as the Red Skull before him.





 6  Crossbones Defeated Himself 
Captain America: Civil War (2016)
        

Frank Grillo has spoken up in recent years about how he feels his MCU character, Brock Rumlow, a.k.a. Crossbones, was wasted by Marvel Studios. The perfect example of this came in the opening moments of 2016&#39;s Captain America: Civil War where, after being teased as a prominent threat in The Winter Soldier, Crossbones was quickly killed off. Rumlow wasn&#39;t only defeated by Captain America, but in a clear show of stupidity and perhaps weakness, he detonated a bomb on himself in an effort to take out Steve Rogers, too. Evidently, Rumlow didn&#39;t realize the other Avengers would stop this from happening, marking a bitter end to his disappointing villain.





 5  Zemo&#39;s Dancing In Madripoor Made Him Less Threatening 
The Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier (2021)
        

Baron Helmut Zemo was one of the MCU&#39;s most innovative and creative villains upon his introduction in Captain America: Civil War, as instead of using brute strength to battle the Avengers, he devised a grand scheme to destroy them from within. This plan worked, setting up Zemo as a terrifying threat, but this status was put in jeopardy in 2021&#39;s The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. While visiting Madripoor with Sam Wilson and Bucky Barnes, Zemo was shown to be dancing (hilariously), perhaps humanizing the villain, but taking away some of the terror and fear surrounding him, as he was supposed to be seen as a brutal and traumatized killer.
Daniel Brühl was expected to reprise the role of Baron Zemo in Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Thunderbolts project, as he leads versions of the antihero team in Marvel Comics, but while he is still rumored to appear, he hasn&#39;t been confirmed to have a role in the Phase 6 film. 






 4  Loki Was Brought Down Easily By The Hulk 
The Avengers (2012)


 







Tom Hiddleston&#39;s Loki was featured as the first villain for the MCU&#39;s original Avengers team, having brought an army of Chitauri and Leviathan to Earth and wreaking havoc in the streets and skies of New York City. Despite being a supremely-powerful Asgardian god, however, Loki is easily brought to his knees on several separate occasions by Tony Stark&#39;s Iron Man, his own brother Thor and Bruce Banner&#39;s Hulk. The latter even proclaims Loki to be a &#34;puny god,&#34; belittling the powerful villain during his conquest on Earth. Loki&#39;s quick defeat proved that he wasn&#39;t cut out to lead, though this has seriously changed in the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga.





 3  Ants Helped Defeat Kang The Conqueror 
Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

After debuting as He Who Remains in Loki season 1, Jonathan Majors appeared as Kang the Conqueror in 2023&#39;s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. While Kang&#39;s future in the MCU has been thrown into jeopardy following Jonathan Majors&#39; December conviction on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault, his depictions of the multiversal supervillain didn&#39;t exactly promote fear anyway. In Quantumania, for instance, the seemingly all-powerful Kang the Conqueror was defeated with the help of a horde of ants in the Quantum Realm, and finished off during a spar with Ant-Man and the Wasp - which wasn&#39;t the villain&#39;s strongest moment.
Following his conviction in December 2023, Jonathan Majors was fired from Marvel Studios. This has led to speculation that Kang the Conqueror will be recast for the remainder of the Multiverse Saga, though it&#39;s also possible that the MCU will simply move on from Kang&#39;s storyline completely. 






 2  The High Evolutionary Was Bested By Rocket 
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

Marvel Studios&#39; Phase 5 delivered one of the MCU&#39;s most sinister and formidable villains in the form of Chukwudi Iwuji&#39;s High Evolutionary. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 explored Rocket Raccoon&#39;s backstory as an experiment of the High Evolutionary, who sought to create the &#34;perfect species.&#34; Unfortunately, his creations lacked imagination, but Rocket was an exception to the rule, as he even worked out a flaw with the High Evolutionary&#39;s machinery that not even the villain himself had figured out, infuriating the High Evolutionary. The fact that Rocket got one up on the High Evolutionary didn&#39;t make the villain look as clever as he presented himself.





 1  Kingpin Cries After Remembering His Past 
Echo (2024)


 







Marvel Studios&#39; most recent release, 2024&#39;s Echo, marked the return of Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. Kingpin, following his appearance in 2021&#39;s Hawkeye. Kingpin had always been depicted as a truly terrifying foe, as Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil, Hawkeye and the majority of Echo proved his criminal influence and sheer strength. However, Echo&#39;s finale saw the villain brought to his knees by Maya Lopez, who used her new abilities to make him relive a traumatic memory, bringing the supervillain to tears. This moment of weakness certainly made Kingpin seem less threatening, but may have helped to push him towards a more dangerous goal in the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
