## Literature Review



The ever-popular streaming service Netflix features a bevy of new content that comes and goes each month, but some key shows and movies are leaving in January 2024. Since its inception, Netflix has positioned itself as the preeminent streaming service, and they were one of the first to delve into the world of original content, which has produced hit shows like Stranger Things and Orange is the New Black. However, the streamer also has a great reputation for hosting other content, and they are a one-stop-shop for everything from classic series to some of Hollywood&#39;s biggest films.




The streamer has to change its lineup from month to month, and that means that shows and movies are leaving the service all the time. While Netflix&#39;s comings and goings aren&#39;t all that unusual, the dropping of certain original content in recent months has represented a major change for the company. Though many of Netflix&#39;s longest-running originals seem to be there to stay, other shows and movies are departing the streamer for new homes or are simply being dropped altogether from the service. While some things might be gone for good, the departures open the door for brand-new content in the coming months.

   Close     




  BlacKkKlansman (2018)   Get Out (2017)   Love Island USA: Season 2   

Two Oscar-winning movies are being removed from Netflix on January 5, both of which have Jordan Peele&#39;s name attached. Get Out was Peele&#39;s directorial debut which became a pop culture phenomenon before winning Peele an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. The movie stars Daniel Kaluuya as a young man who visits his girlfriend&#39;s white family for the first time only for the weekend getaway to spiral into creepy bizarreness.

Peele produced the Best Picture nominee BlacKkKlansman which won Spike Lee his first Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie tells the wild true story of a Black police officer who successfully infiltrated the KKK in the 1970s. These two high-profile departures are joined by the second season of the reality show Love Island.

The First Three Movies In The Spy Kids Series
          

  Spy Kids (2001)   Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams (2002)   Spy Kids 3: Game Over (2003)  

Despite recently attempting to reboot the franchise with Spy Kids: Armageddon, Netflix will be removing the original Spy Kids trilogy from its platform on January 12. The three movies are all directed by Robert Rodriguez and follow a family of spies with the younger kids having to join in the family business when their parents are in danger. The movies saw Rodriguez playing around with early green screen technology which makes for some visual effects that have aged poorly. However, these are fun family-friendly adventures with some great Spy Kids cameos over the franchise from the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Salma Hayek, and George Clooney.

  The Doll (2016)   The Doll 2 (2017)   Uncharted (2022)  

One of the most successful video game adaptations will be leaving Netflix on January 14. Uncharted took a surprising approach to the long-awaited live-action story of Nathan Drake by casting Tom Holland as a young version of the adventurer who joins Mark Wahlberg&#39;s Sully on a treasure-hunting ride with plenty of action and mayhem. While critics weren&#39;t overly impressed with the movie, it was a big enough success at the box office that fans are expecting to see this turn into a new franchise for Holland. Also leaving on this day is the Indonesian horror movie The Doll and its sequel, The Doll 2.

Barry Keoghan is also getting a lot of buzz for his role in Saltburn but he gained a lot of attention earlier in his career for his role in this movie as a disturbed young man who seeks out a relationship with a surgeon (Colin Farrell) which has lasting impacts on the future of the man&#39;s family.
