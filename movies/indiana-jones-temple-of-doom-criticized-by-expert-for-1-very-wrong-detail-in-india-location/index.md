# Indiana Jones &amp; Temple Of Doom Criticized By Expert For 1 Very Wrong Detail In India Location


## SUMMARY 



  The alligators shown in the rope bridge scene of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are actually American alligators, which is an inaccuracy since the scene takes place in India.   Alligators do not eat in a communal manner in the wild, contrary to how they are portrayed in the film. They are known to rip off pieces of prey for immediate consumption.   The inaccurate portrayal of Indian culture and religion in Temple of Doom, including the depiction of the Thuggees and their practices, perpetuates harmful stereotypes and led to the film being banned in India.

## Literature Review

Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has been criticized by a crocodile and alligator expert for a very incorrect detail during an iconic scene.




Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom features a significant error during one of its most iconic scenes. The scene in question occurs when Indy, Short Round, and Willie Scott are being pursued by Mola Ram and the Thuggees, and find themselves cornered on a rope bridge. Indy famously declares, &#34;Mola Ram! Prepare to meet Kali... in Hell!&#34; before cutting the rope bridge and sending many of the Thugges into the waters below where they are devoured by alligators.




In a video from Insider, crocodile and alligator expert Frank Robb explains the inaccuracy of the alligators featured in the scene. The inaccuracy is connected to the scene taking place in India, which is Temple of Doom&#39;s primary setting. It is also connected to the way the alligators eat their prey and chew on the Thuggees&#39; clothing after consuming them. Check out the video and Robb&#39;s comments below:


This is supposed to be in India, and they&#39;re showing American alligators in India. It would either be the Indian gharial or the saltwater crocodile you can find in some places in India as well. So they got the species wrong.
They&#39;re not a communal eater whatsoever. Those animals are used to eating together. Alligators in the wild, you&#39;re not going to find sharing a meal. That does not happen. If they&#39;ve got something and want to rip a piece of it off, that&#39;s how they&#39;ll take their prey and rip a piece off in order to have that right then and there.
Alligators and crocodiles can digest just about anything. They have something we call gastroliths in their stomachs. They&#39;re eating bones. If they can digest bones, then a piece of cloth is nothing. I&#39;d give that a 2/10. If you factored in the way they were eating together, as soon as you saw that you&#39;d immediately know that is not a wild situation. That&#39;s somewhere in a farm system or zoo.






 


 The Alligators Are Part Of A Larger Problem In Temple Of Doom 
          

Temple of Doom is the most controversial Indiana Jones movie, largely because of its problematic portrayal of India. Showing American alligators in India is only part of the larger issue with how the country, its people, and their culture are depicted throughout the film. All the Indian characters in the film are turned into one-dimensional caricatures. The villagers are helpless and can only be saved by Indy, which feeds into a white savior narrative.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Indian characters, including Mola Ram and the Thuggees, are portrayed as nothing more than ruthless villains who literally drink blood and carry out human sacrifices. The true story behind Temple of Doom&#39;s villains is that the Thuggees were a real gang who committed robberies and murdered travelers, but they operated on a much smaller scale than the influential cult in the movie. The Thuggees drinking the blood of Kali and worshiping the deity, who is a prominent goddess in Hinduism, perpetuated harmful and inaccurate stereotypes about the Hindu religion and Indian culture as well.




Along with its Indian characters, the movie has been criticized for the infamous dinner scene at Pankot Palace, in which Indy and the other dinner guests are served chilled monkey brains and live snakes. There is no historical or cultural basis for these kinds of foods being eaten in India, and it is purely based on offensive stereotypes. These insensitive portrayals led to the Indian government not allowing Temple of Doom to be filmed in India, and the film was banned from being released there as well.
