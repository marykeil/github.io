Summary

  Melissa Barrera won&#39;t be in Scream 7, but she stars in a vampire horror movie coming out in April.   Abigail reunites Barrera with the directors of the Scream reboot and features an exciting premise.   Abigail offers a fresh concept for a horror movie that could be even more creative than the Scream franchise.  





Melissa Barrera is no longer starring in Scream 7, but the actor&#39;s perfect replacement movie will come out in just three months. Barrera portrayed Samantha Carpenter in 2022&#39;s Scream and its follow-up, Scream IV, starring alongside Jenna Ortega, who played her on-screen sister. The daughter of Scream 1996&#39;s villain Billy Loomis, Sam was an instant hit with fans. Unfortunately, Barrera&#39;s controversial firing from Scream 7 means she won&#39;t be back for the next Ghostface massacre.




Still, even with Scream 7&#39;s casting shake-up, horror fans haven&#39;t seen the last of Barrera. The former Scream star has another movie coming out this year, and while its premise is vastly different from that of the slasher hit, it continues to showcase her talents within the genre. Barrera&#39;s upcoming vampire movie hits theaters in April, and it promises to be as exciting as another Scream sequel — perhaps even more so.


 Melissa Barrera Is Reteaming With The Scream Directors On Abigail 
          

Barrera is in the cast of the vampire horror movie Abigail, and the project sees her reuniting with Scream reboot directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillet, both of whom are directing the upcoming film. The first trailer for Abigail dropped on January 11, shedding more light on Barrera&#39;s role and the movie&#39;s premise in general. The story revolves around a group of criminals who kidnap a young ballerina in the hopes of ransoming her for $50 million. Little do they know that the ballerina in question is a vampire, a revelation that puts their plan and lives at risk.




Barrera plays one of the kidnappers in Abigail, going by the fake name Joey in the trailer. She seems to be the most empathetic of the bunch, but if the first look is any indication, Abigail won&#39;t take mercy on Barrera&#39;s character for that. The footage sees the young vampire hunting the crew down, with them desperately searching for ways to kill her. It&#39;s a hilarious concept elevated by its star-studded cast, which includes Giancarlo Esposito, Kathryn Newton, Dan Stevens, Kevin Durand, and the late Angus Cloud in addition to Barrera.


 



 Abigail Could Be Even More Creative Than The Scream Movies 
          




With its odd combination of humor and horror, Abigail is Barrera&#39;s perfect replacement for Scream 7 — and the upcoming film could be even more creative than the slasher. While Scream is often praised for its self-awareness, the series has gotten somewhat formulaic. By contrast, Abigail offers a fresh concept for a horror movie that can be mined further in sequels. The trailer alone raises plenty of questions about Abigail&#39;s vampire status and the movie&#39;s lore. And even if it&#39;s a one-off, Abigail could serve as the first of several unique spins on Universal&#39;s classic movie monsters. Unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to say if Barrera&#39;s character will survive to see any others.



Abigail hits theaters on April 19, 2024.
