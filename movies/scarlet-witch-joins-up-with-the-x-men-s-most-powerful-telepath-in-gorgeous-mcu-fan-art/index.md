## Literature Review

The Scarlet Witch gets a bold new look and is imagined with a powerful X-Men team member as the MCU prepares to wholly embrace mutants.




Scarlet Witch may currently be dead in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but that hasn&#39;t stopped artists from imagining her future escapades in the franchise. The official MCU timeline book confirms that Wanda Maximoff did really die at the end of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but a witch as powerful as her could surely find a way to cheat death. If she does return to the MCU soon, she&#39;ll likely get a chance to meet the X-Men.




Few seem to believe that Wanda Maximoff will stay dead, and artist skaiwitch has posted a rendition of the character on Instagram blended with artwork of powerful mutant telepath Jean Grey. See the full piece below:


 

The artwork doesn&#39;t portray a specific potential scene but instead imagines a theoretical poster for the MCU&#39;s next saga after the Multiverse Saga concludes with the upcoming Avengers: Secret Wars. With the X-Men movie in the early stages at Marvel studios and characters like Professor X and Beast already having appeared in different realities of the multiverse, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the MCU Phases 7-9 focus on mutants if the franchise continues its established cadence. While Scarlet Witch and Jean Gray may seem like unrelated characters, the two actually have quite a bit in common.




                  Marvel&#39;s X-Men Movie: Everything We Know   With Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman&#39;s Deadpool 3 announced, MCU fans may be wondering if an X-Men movie will be following after.   


 Why Scarlet Witch And Jean Gray Are More Connected Than They Seem 
         

While the MCU has hitherto presented Wanda Maximoff&#39;s Scarlet Witch as a magic user who had her powers awakened by the Space Stone, her history in Marvel Comics has usually (but not always) categorized her as a mutant. She and her brother Quicksilver are the children of Magneto, a relationship that couldn&#39;t be explored in the MCU while mutant movie rights belonged to Fox. While Evan Peters portrayed Pietro Maximoff in X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse, and X-Men: Dark Phoenix, his twin Wanda didn&#39;t cross franchises. However, Wanda and Jean have another notable similarity beyond their mutant gene.




Notably, both Wanda and Jean have fallen victim to corruption by a powerful force that amplified their internal struggles and led to their temporary heel-turn. Wanda famously turned to the Darkhold after suffering the loss of Vision and her self-realized children in WandaVision, which led to her multiverse rampage in Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness. Similarly, Jean has been imbued with the Phoenix Force in two films: X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men: Dark Phoenix. If the two meet in the MCU, and if it&#39;s a version of Jean who has gone through her Phoenix phase, the two would likely bond over shared experiences.
