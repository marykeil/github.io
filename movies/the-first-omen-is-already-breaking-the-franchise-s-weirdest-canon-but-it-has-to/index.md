# The First Omen Is Already Breaking The Franchise s Weirdest Canon (But It Has To)


## SUMMARY 



  The First Omen is revamping the franchise to capture the creepiness of the original and explore the origin of the evil child Damien.   The prequel will change Damien&#39;s birth origin story, replacing his jackal mother with an inverted Immaculate Conception involving a nun impregnated by Satan.   The change was necessary to add a human element and allow for a compelling story in the prequel. Margaret, played by Nell Tiger Free, will have a significant role in the birth of Damien.

## Literature Review

One of the strangest parts of The Omen&#39;s lore will seemingly be omitted by The First Omen, which will be necessary for the prequel&#39;s narrative.




The First Omen will seek to take The Omen franchise to uncharted territory after a slew of disappointing sequels and a poorly-received remake, and to do it effectively it&#39;s changing the weirdest element of the franchise&#39;s canon. The backwards trailer for The First Omen provided an unsettling look at the franchise&#39;s first entry in more than a decade, and it looks poised to capture much of the creepiness that defined the original 1976 classic. While the sequels expand upon the original movie&#39;s diabolical premise, the prequel will return to the origin of the evil child at the center of the franchise.




As The Omen details the mysterious occurrences that surround the child Damien Thorn, it becomes clear that the child is in fact the prophesied Antichrist. However, no sequel has ever explored exactly how or why the child Damien came to be born, which is unusual for a genre which often relies on origin stories once a franchise progresses far enough down the proverbial rabbit hole. The First Omen trailer promises that it will do just that, but to do it effectively, it needs to change a major element surrounding Damien&#39;s birth.

 Damien&#39;s Original Birth Origin Story &amp; What The First Omen Changes 
Damien&#39;s mother originally wasn&#39;t even human.
          

In The Omen, the child Damien is adopted by an American diplomat whose own recently born child died immediately; he never tells his wife that the child they took home is not, in fact, the one she actually gave birth to. As the movie progresses, it&#39;s emphasized repeatedly that Damien&#39;s real mother was a literal jackal, and his father was Satan himself. This is poignantly highlighted by the discovery of a jackal carcass in what is supposed to be the grave of Damien&#39;s mother.






The First Omen will be released in theaters on April 5, 2024.




The First Omen is set to change the circumstances of Damien&#39;s birth. The plot synopsis for the movie reveals that Damien will be born thanks to an elaborate conspiracy within the Church in Rome, and that while he is indeed the son of Satan, his mother will not be a jackal. Instead, the movie will execute an inverted version of the Immaculate Conception, with a nun being impregnated by Satan and giving birth to Damien. The prequel likely takes place in the months directly preceding the original The Omen, and may even end with the birth of Damien.



 Why The First Omen Had To Change The Canon To Work 
An inverted Immaculate Conception plot brings a necessary human element.
         




Ultimately, for any prequel to The Omen to work, the detail about Damien&#39;s mother being a jackal needed to be changed. If Damien&#39;s parents are an animal and Satan, then there really is nothing for a prequel to explore. A good narrative needs a human element to tell an effective story, and that will be reflected in the evil Immaculate Conception story line of The First Omen. While more specific details about Nell Tiger Free&#39;s character Margaret are not yet available, it&#39;s clear that she will either be closely involved with the nun who will eventually birth Damien, or she may end up giving birth herself.
