## Literature Review

Now that G.I. Joe and Transformers are confirmed to be crossing over, itâ€™s time to think about how the two franchises will help and hurt each other.




In 2023, the latest Transformers movie, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts confirmed that it and the G.I. Joe franchise would soon be crossing over and sharing a universe, which means now is the perfect time to examine how the two Hasbro toy franchises will help and hurt each other at the cinema. G.I. Joe originated as a brand of toy soldier that was first adapted to film in 2009. Transformers is also a toy brand depicting the story of Autobots, or shape-shifting robots, which got its first adaptation in 2007. In the intervening years, both franchises have spawned several movies, and as a result, grown as brand names.
Though there have long been talks about making a G.I. Joe and Transformers crossover movie, the seeds of this idea were only recently planted in 2023. The big change came at the end of Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. In the final scene, the movie&#39;s protagonist Noah goes to an interview for what he thinks is a security job, but as it turns out, is actually a role in the secret military organization, G.I. Joe. In just one scene, the Transformers franchise confirmed that G.I. Joe exists within its universe, and furthermore, that Noah could be the bridge between them. But, what will this crossover actually mean?




























 








 8  G.I. Joe Could Make Or Break The Transformers Franchise 
Combining G.I. Joe and Transformers Is A Risk
        

First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge the fact that bringing G.I. Joe into the Transformers franchise could either be a massive success or a terrible failure. While many are excited to see the two franchises come together, there are others that are still skeptical of the idea or are unsure about how it will work. In this way, both G.I. Joe and Transformers have a big job to accomplish. They must not only maintain the integrity of their separate franchises, but also connect to each other in a way that makes sense and is very cool and interesting.
Therefore, this will be the biggest effect that G.I. Joe will have on the Transformers franchise. After officially combining the two properties, audiences will either be satisfied or disappointed. If they are happy, then the Transformers franchise will likely thrive, and the two together could pick up steam. But, if audiences dislike the crossover, then Transformers and G.I. Joe could both see a downward spiral. Therefore, it is a huge risk, but one that will hopefully work out in everyone&#39;s favor.





 7  G.I. Joe Will Make The Transformers World More Interesting 
G.I. Joe expands the Transformers world


 







Despite the fact that the Transformers franchise has been building up their on-screen world since 2007, there is definitely something to be said for new additions and changes. In many ways, bringing G.I. Joe into the Transformers universe will shake up Transformers in a way that has never been done before, and this will be a good thing. Transformers will no longer be restricted to exploring Autobots; instead, audiences will have the opportunity to see a different side of the Transformers universe. All in all, this will make everything a bit more interesting and easier to dive into.





 6  G.I. Joe Helps Make A Hasbro Cinematic Universe 
G.I. Joe is the start of the Hasbro movie universe
        

One of the most important aspects of combining G.I. Joe and Transformers is that the crossover could be the start of a greater Hasbro cinematic universe. G.I. Joe and Transformers both originated from the toy brand Hasbro, and now that they exist in the same movie world, there is a wide open opportunity for Hasbro to continue expanding this universe. There could be new films surrounding Cabbage Patch Kids, Furbys, or any other Hasbro toy. Considering the past success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and also the rise of toy-related films, this would be a great opportunity.
Plus, audiences would benefit from a Hasbro cinematic universe just as much as Hasbro would. There&#39;s no doubt that audiences would love to see their favorite toys from childhood come to life, especially those that have never gotten an on-screen adaptation before. And, as previously mentioned, having all these toys exist together in one universe creates a much bigger and more exciting movie universe that viewers can jump right into. Every viewer will be able to enjoy a piece of the potential Hasbro cinematic universe.





 5  G.I. Joe Will Expand Transformers&#39; Audience 
G.I. Joe will bring more people to theaters
        

Back on a small scale, G.I. Joe joining the Transformers franchise will likely expand Transformers audience. Since Transformers has been making movies since 2007, it is probable there are a certain amount of viewers for each movie over the years. However, now that Transformers is adding G.I. Joe to its universe, it seems likely that there will be more audience members who are either interested in seeing G.I. Joe or are excited by this new crossover. Either way, the crossover almost guarantees a certain degree of hype, and therefore, more viewers in movie theater seats.





 4  G.I. Joe Means That There Will Be Future Crossover Opportunities 
G.I. Joe is the start of many future crossovers
        

Now that Transformers has introduced the G.I. Joe crossover, there is no going back, and in fact, there is only more to look forward to. After Transformers: Rise of the Beasts confirmed the Transformers and G.I. Joe crossover, that laid the foundation for many more crossover opportunities. While it is important for both Transformers and G.I. Joe to develop their own individual stories, it is equally as important to raise the stakes of their shared universe and give audiences the fun moments that they crave. Furthermore, if a Hasbro cinematic universe really does happen, then the crossovers will snowball even more.





 3  G.I. Joe Might Ruin Its Own Story- And Transformers&#39; 
The crossover could take attention away from previous stories
        

While there are many good changes that the G.I. Joe and Transformers&#39; crossover will bring, one potentially bad route is if the crossover diminishes their individual stories. It can be incredibly exciting to see two long-time franchises come together the way that G.I Joe and Transformers are, but their union won&#39;t be nearly as amazing if the franchises do not keep up with distinct stories. This is especially important for G.I. Joe. If G.I. Joe does not nail down a strong story that gets audiences invested, then there will be no hope for it or the crossover. As a result, Transformers will suffer too.





 2  G.I. Joe Will Boost Transformers Popularity 
The crossover is an automatic popularity boost
        

In a very general sense, the G.I. Joe and Transformers crossover automatically makes Transformers more relevant and more popular. Because the crossover is such a significant moment, there are countless eyes on the project, and even if some of them are skeptical, they are still interested to see what happens. Overall, the crossover is a massive way to market Transformers, and G.I. Joe as well, and more publicity is usually a great thing. Hopefully, this spike in popularity can subsist the two franchises for quite a while.





 1  G.I. Joe Joining Transformers Guarantees More Transformers/G.I. Joe Movies 
G.I. Joe and Transformers will get more movies
        

One final change that G.I. Joe joining Transformers makes is that it guarantees more movies. Though both franchises have had semi-recent releases, this new step towards the crossover is essentially a promise there will not only be more Transformers and G.I. Joe movies, but more movies that are specifically meant to utilize this crossover. In this way, fans of either franchise should prepare for things to heat up as a result of this crossover. If all goes well, Transformers, G.I. Joe, and the Hasbro cinematic universe could get a major boost.
