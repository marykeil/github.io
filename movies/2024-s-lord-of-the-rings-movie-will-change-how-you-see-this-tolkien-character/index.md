## Literature Review

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim will make a major change to the franchise, doing justice to a character from the original trilogy.




A new movie in The Lord of the Rings will be released in 2024, and it will definitely change how you see this Tolkien character. The world of The Lord of the Rings has been fleshed out immensely throughout the history of the multimedia franchise, and the fantasy train is far from stopping. The upcoming film The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is set to give even more backstory to the world of The Lord of the Rings, with it changing how viewers will see this character.




The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is an immensely exciting new entry in the beloved fantasy franchise, with it being the first feature-length film since the conclusion of The Hobbit prequel trilogy. Unlike its predecessors, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is actually an animated film, with it being set around 250 years before the events of the live-action trilogy. The film will explore a corner of The Lord of the Rings universe that the films haven&#39;t touched yet, shining a spotlight on an extremely deserving character.

                  8 Ways Lord Of The Rings&#39; New Movie Connects To The Main Trilogy   Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is set over a century before Jackson&#39;s LOTR trilogy, but these films will still share exciting connections.   


 War Of The Rohirrim Will Do For Rohan What LOTR Did For Gondor 
         




One of the most exciting parts of The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is that it will do for Rohan what Lord of the Rings did for Gondor. One of the most important arcs in The Lord of the Rings has to do with Aragorn becoming the king of Gondor, with this change concluding his character arc. The Lord of the Rings movies explore the story of the former king of Gondor Isildur early in the trilogy, with this setting the stage for why Aaragorn&#39;s time as king is so important.

The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim will pull off a similar trick to Isildur&#39;s story, except this time for a different character: Helm Hammerhand. Helm Hammerhand is the main character of The War of the Rohirrim, with him being the king of Rohan at the time of the story. This will parallel Théoden&#39;s story in the main The Lord of the Rings trilogy, showing what the position was like before he took the throne.



 Lord Of The Rings&#39; New Movie Will Bring Théoden  r To Tolkien&#39;s Books 
          




On top of recontextualizing Théoden&#39;s story, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim will also do a major service to the franchise by bringing him closer to Tolkien&#39;s books. During his time in the live-action movies, Théoden is under the control of one of The Lord of the Rings&#39; most powerful magic users, Wormtongue. Because of this, Théoden wasn&#39;t shown to his full potential as he was in Tolkien&#39;s books.

In the books, Théoden is much more regal than he is presented as in the movies. While he probably won&#39;t appear in The War of the Rohirrim due to its setting, it will explore the ancestry of the king of Rohan. This means that his backstory can be expanded on even further, bringing him closer to his original vision in The Lord of the Rings.

              The Lord of The Rings: The War of The Rohirrim  Set before the events of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim is an animated action-adventure fantasy film that follows a King of Rohan named Helm Hammerhand. When his home comes under siege by Dunlendings, Hammerhand prepares himself and his allies to fight back against them, with the war leading to the eventual establishment of Helm&#39;s Deep.
