## Literature Review

One of 2023&#39;s biggest horror movies, Eli Roth&#39;s Thanksgiving, finally confirms its digital release date as the sequel continues its development.




Following its surprisingly successful run in theaters, the Thanksgiving digital release date has been confirmed. Eli Roth&#39;s slasher movie served as a feature-length adaptation of his faux trailer of the same name from the Grindhouse duology, centering on a killer donning a John Carver mask and killing various people in the town of Plymouth, Massachusetts during the eponymous holiday season.




As development on the sequel continues, Sony Pictures has confirmed the Thanksgiving digital and physical release dates. The slasher movie will officially hit digital platforms on January 16, followed by shelves on Blu-ray and DVD on January 30. Both releases will come with over an hour of bonus material, including deleted and extended scenes, behind-the-scenes footage, and old home movies made by Roth and his co-writer, Jeff Rendell. Check out the full selection of bonus features below:

 How Thanksgiving Became The Sleeper Horror Hit Of 2023 
         

With over 15 years between the faux Grindhouse trailer and the actual movie&#39;s release, expectations understandably weren&#39;t high for Thanksgiving, particularly as the prior two adaptations of faux trailers, Machete and Hobo With a Shotgun, were met with polarized reviews from critics and audiences alike. Roth himself was known for being divisive with critics, with the past decade seeing some of the worst reviews in his filmography with the Keanu Reeves-led thriller Knock Knock and Bruce Willis-starring remake of Death Wish.

Ultimately, though, whether it was the lower expectations or Roth honing much of what made him a successful name in the horror genre, Thanksgiving proved to be one of 2023&#39;s surprise hits. Netting Roth a career-high Rotten Tomatoes score of 83% &#34;Certified Fresh&#34; with him in the director&#39;s chair, critics were largely enthusiastic about his and writer Jeff Rendell&#39;s dark sense of humor on display throughout the movie, with some favorably comparing their approach to similarly well-received holiday horror efforts, Gremlins and Krampus, even if the slasher formula proved a bit too predictable for some.




While it may not have matched the same financial heights of other 2023 horror movies, like Scream VI&#39;s $169 million haul, Saw X&#39;s $111.8 million gross or Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s&#39; record-breaking $294 million haul, Thanksgiving still proved to be a modest success for Sony. Bringing in nearly $46 million against its $15 million production budget, the movie was facing intense competition being surrounded by The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Trolls Band Together, The Marvels and WIsh, and yet it still found its way to tripling its budget, safely netting it a sequel order from the studio. While it remains unclear if Thanksgiving 2 will match the same success as its predecessor, should Roth and Rendell use the same back-to-basics, darkly humorous approach for the sequel as they did the original, the horror property could very well enjoy some longevity in the modern genre.
