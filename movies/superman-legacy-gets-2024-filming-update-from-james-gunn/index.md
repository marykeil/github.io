## Literature Review

The new DCU&#39;s Superman: Legacy has received an update on its production and filming schedule in 2024 by DC Studios&#39; Co-CEO, James Gunn.




With Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom concluding the DCEU for good, new DC Studios Co-CEO James Gunn has wasted no time in delivering a filming update for Superman: Legacy in 2024. Superman: Legacy will be the first movie to debut in Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe, the reboot that aims to reinvigorate and reinvent DC&#39;s cinematic franchise. Details on Superman: Legacy are currently few and far between, but Gunn has graced enthusiastic fans with an exciting update.




In a post via Threads, James Gunn has revealed that production is well underway for the newest Superman movie, with sets being built, costumes being finished, and the confirmed cast studying for their new roles. The news comes just days after Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom drew an underwhelming line beneath the DCEU, which has suffered a suboptimal year overall both financially and critically. The unfortunate conclusion of DC&#39;s first cinematic franchise will have left the door wide open for new movies to capitalize on the lingering desire for something fresh to help do justice to the seminal comic book stories. 

          

                  10 Lessons The New DC Universe Can Learn From DC&#39;s Highest-Grossing Movies Of All Time   James Gunn and Peter Safran will soon begin their new DC Universe, and they may learn some valuable lessons from DC&#39;s prior highest-grossing projects.   





 What DCU Releases Are Happening In 2024 
          

While the DCU&#39;s upcoming projects were announced early in 2023, the new cinematic franchise is still in its earliest stages of production, with Superman: Legacy being the only movie even to have its cast confirmed. Other confirmed projects, like The Brave and the Bold, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and Swamp Thing, have yet to confirm any details about their cast, plot, or release dates. With Superman: Legacy, the DCU&#39;s first movie, slated for release in 2025, 2024 will not feature any DCU canon movie or TV show. This, however, is a good thing for the franchise. 

                  Why James Gunn Is Right About DC&#39;s 2024 Movie Release Schedule   James Gunn has been responding to questions about the DCU, and his response to one about DC&#39;s 2024 movie release schedule is on the money.   




The DCU aims to pick up the pieces of the DCEU&#39;s failures, attempting to reignite enthusiasm for DC&#39;s characters in cinema. 2023 was a rough year for both the DCU and MCU, with both studios suffering historic flops and lackluster responses. A year of reprieve could be what the genre needs as audience enthusiasm is proven to have waned. Meanwhile, the sequel to Todd Phillips&#39; critically acclaimed Joker, Joker: Folie Ã  Deux, is slated to release on October 4, an Elseworlds installment that will precede Superman: Legacy by nine months.
