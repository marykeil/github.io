## Literature Review

The Book of Clarence is a new Biblical comedy from director Jeymes Samuel and star LaKeith Stanfield. There are options for where to watch the movie,




The Book of Clarence puts a new spin on the Biblical story, and there are different options for where to watch the movie. The 2024 film is written and directed by Jeymes Samuel, the acclaimed filmmaker behind The Harder They Fall. It&#39;s an original story set during Biblical times and follows one man, LaKeith Stanfield&#39;s Clarence, as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. The Book of Clarence follows the lead character as he positions himself as a new Messiah and uses his new fame to make a better life for himself. It features an excellent cast that includes Benedict Cumberbatch, James McAvoy, David Oyelowo, and others.




Anticipation for The Book of Clarence has been high ever since the project was first announced thanks to the amount of talent involved. Jeymes Samuel&#39;s western movie The Harder They Fall was very well-received critically, so his take on a Biblical comedy was immediately exciting. Although it was originally set for a 2023 release, delays forced audiences to wait until 2024 to watch The Book of Clarence. While the movie has an exclusive theatrical release to start, it will only be a matter of time before it becomes available to watch at home on streaming.

 When Will The Book Of Clarence Release On Streaming? 
          

It is not yet confirmed when The Book of Clarence&#39;s streaming release date will be. As a Sony production, determining when that will happen is also a bit more challenging. Sony does not have its own streaming service, electing to license out its movies during different post-release windows to various streaming services. This also means the timeline for how quickly the movies release on streaming can fluctuate. What is known is that The Book of Clarence will stream on Netflix first thanks to Sony&#39;s deal with the service. This might not happen until May 2024 based on Sony&#39;s history.






The Book of Clarence will stream on Hulu at a later date thanks to Sony&#39;s deal with Disney






 When Will The Book Of Clarence Release On Digital? 
          

The first chance to watch The Book of Clarence at home should come through the movie&#39;s release on digital. Sony will eventually give audiences an opportunity to buy or rent The Book of Clarence through most major PVOD services. This could happen in March 2024 based on how the studio has handled previous releases. In that instance, The Book of Clarence will receive roughly a two-month exclusive theatrical release before audiences can find alternative viewing options at home.
