## Literature Review
With Max bringing in more movies and TV shows every month, there are plenty of originals and classics coming for subscribers in January 2024.




The lineup of new movies and TV shows on Max in January 2024 is just as packed with known Warner Bros. and HBO classics as ever, alongside a steady stream of slick recent releases. After launching in 2020 as HBO Max, the primary streaming home for Warner Bros. titles, Max changed its name and rebranded in 2023 as a way to show it has more to offer subscribers than known hits. While this also comes with some changes to subscription tiers, Max will still be releasing new hit titles every month, which in December includes some holiday specials and the arrival of classic film franchises.




Thanks to the backing of both Warner Bros. and now the Discovery brand, Max has a massive catalog of original content to offer subscribers — one that has new movies and TV shows added monthly. Many of the best movies in history came from Warner Bros., stretching back to the early days of silent cinema, and with the always great HBO shows still in development, there should be no shortage of great movies and TV shows to catch every month on Max. From the hottest reality shows to some popular movies to exciting Max Originals, there really is something for everyone, including the new movies and shows on Max arriving in January.
