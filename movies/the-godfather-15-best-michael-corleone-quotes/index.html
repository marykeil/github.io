  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Some of the best Michael Corleone quotes from the Godfather trilogy are chilling, while others are very wise. Either way, they&rsquo;re unforgettable.</p>
<p>There are countless memorable The Godfather quotes in the acclaimed mafia movie trilogy, but many of the most impactful ones come from Michael Corleone and highlight his complex journey. Michael was always a tragic figure, one who lost sight of what he’d initially set out to do and ended up alienating everyone around him. Throughout his life, he had many interesting and memorable insights based on what type of character development he was going through at that moment, and the best Michael Corleone quotes chronicle his epic fall from grace.
Though the third and final Godfather movie has never been as well-received by fans or critics as the first two films, the release of Francis Ford Coppola&rsquo;s revised cut of the movie, The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, reinvigorated interest in the trilogy&rsquo;s central character and his legacy. Like most of the truly great crime epics, the Godfather movies invite the audience to psychoanalyze the characters, and fans have always wanted to have a deeper understanding of what made Michael tick. Michael Corleone&rsquo;s best quotes from the Godfather movies are the most useful roadmap for the darkest parts of Michael&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>The 50 Best Movies Of All Time
Screen Rant breaks down the 50 best movies of all time, which are based on original scores weighted by rankings from IMDb and Metacritic.</p>
<p>15  &ldquo;Never Let Anyone Know What You&rsquo;re Thinking.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III</p>
<p>Michael was a master at keeping his emotions to himself, whether talking to loved ones or staring into the eyes of enemies he planned to have murdered mere moments later. When Vincent (Andy Garcia) makes an outburst about wanting to retaliate against Joey Zasa (Joe Mantegna), he gives him this calm advice. Being the hotheaded character that he is, Vincent doesn&rsquo;t take it and Michael&rsquo;s next suggestion is delivered much less calmly. Still, this is an iconic Michael Corleone quote from a much older and wiser Don who&rsquo;s starting to truly resemble his father.</p>
<p>14  &ldquo;I Don&rsquo;t Feel Like I Have To Wipe Everybody Out, Tom. Just My Enemies, That&rsquo;s All.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II</p>
<p>Michael has an incredibly tough time throughout The Godfather Part II, with an assassination attempt made on him early on in the film creating an atmosphere of mistrust that lasts throughout. Michael spends the rest of the film identifying all of his enemies and systematically removing them, showing his prowess as a strategist. Even Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is shocked by the scope of Michael&rsquo;s plans, but as this quote shows, Michael was a surgical operator despite the mercilessness of his actions, which made him all the more formidable.</p>
<p>13  &ldquo;What I Want, What&rsquo;s Most Important To Me Is That I Have A Guarantee. No More Attempts On My Father&rsquo;s Life.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>Michael still had his humanity during most of the original Godfather film, where his initial involvement within the family was to ensure the safety of his father. It had been the attempted assassination of his father, Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), that got Michael involved in the mob war in the first place and Vito’s well-being remained firmly in his mind.
Michael sets up a meeting with Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) and McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) with the express purpose of killing them and shares this veiled truth with them as he plays the part of a negotiator and builds himself up to murder the two where they sit. In Michael&rsquo;s mind, the murders will give him this guarantee that he wants, but it sets him down a dark path from which he is never redeemed.</p>
<p>12  &ldquo;Keep Your Friends   And Your Enemies  r.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II</p>
<p>Michael says this line in The Godfather Part II to Frank Pentangeli (Micahel V.Gazzo), who doesn&rsquo;t understand why Michael doesn&rsquo;t attack Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) immediately now that he suspects that Roth arranged the assassination attempt against him at the beginning of the film. Michael says that his father passed this particular piece of wisdom down to him in the very room of his old home that they are in, and it&rsquo;s certainly one of the most famous and all-around best quotes from the Godfather trilogy. It shows the patience and discipline Michael has that ensures he will triumph over his enemies.</p>
<p>11  &ldquo;Never Hate Your Enemies. It Affects Your Judgment.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III</p>
<p>It’s notable that while Michael and the Corleone family had so many enemies, he responded to them each with a certain degree of indifference. It was a deliberate move on his part, as this stemmed from his thought process that putting too much emotion toward his enemies would form an obsession in his mind. By keeping a certain distance in terms of hatred from those who wanted to harm him, Michael opened his mind up to devising strategies. He knew that giving in to his emotions was what got his brother Sonny (James Caan) killed, so Michael chose to do the opposite.</p>
<p>Every Change To The Original Godfather Part III In Coppola&rsquo;s New Cut
2020&rsquo;s The Godfather Coda has been reconstructed to be more elegiac than The Godfather III. Here&rsquo;s every change in Coppola&rsquo;s new cut.</p>
<p>10  “Senator, We’re Both Part Of The Same Hypocrisy. But Never Think It Applies To My Family.”
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II</p>
<p>Through all of Michael Corleone&rsquo;s many misdeeds, one of the things that keeps the audience invested in his journey and forgiving of his darker side is the fact that Michael truly loves his family and he does protect them from an environment that&rsquo;s hostile to their culture and their very lives. When Senator Pat Geary (G.D. Spradlin) insults Michael&rsquo;s entire family, implying that he judges them for their Italian heritage, a blink-and-miss-it flash of rage enters Michael&rsquo;s eyes, but he quickly quells it and delivers this characteristically frosty quote. Pacino&rsquo;s performance is subtly masterful in moments such as this.</p>
<p>9  &ldquo;You Straightened My Brother Out?&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>After Michael found out Moe Greene (Alex Rocco) had hit his brother Fredo (John Cazale), he did not take the incident lightly and flexed his then-burgeoning powers as the new don of the Corleone family. Michael could never let an insult against his own brother stand, and when he repeats Moe Greene&rsquo;s own description of events back to him with his cold and piercing eyes and the chilling nature of Pacino&rsquo;s delivery, it cements Michael as a truly intimidating figure. A powerful man like Moe Green does not scare him and he refuses to let any disrespect go unaddressed.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;I Know It Was You, Fredo. You Broke My Heart. You Broke My Heart.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II</p>
<p>It was here when Fredo’s fate was effectively sealed as Michael found out that his own brother might have had a hand in an assassination attempt against him. While it&rsquo;s never made clear if Fredo truly did want to get Michael killed, Michael decided to have Fredo killed. Pulling his brother to deliver the kiss of death, Michael showed true emotion after a long period of almost robotic behavior, telling his brother he knew of his role. It was both heartbreaking and terrifying to see Michael this way.</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s My Family, Kay. That&rsquo;s Not Me.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>Years before he became the Don of the Corleone family, Michael tried his best to distance himself from their criminal dealings. Though he would become instinctively secretive, Michael was originally very open with his girlfriend and eventual second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). He demonstrated this by being open and honest about his father’s exploits and dealings, which involved sharing how Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) was used as an enforcer. When Kay seemed shocked by the information, Michael confessed he had shared this with her to tell her he wasn’t like his family, emphasizing that his arc is a tragic one.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;Fredo, You’re My Older Brother, And I Love You. But Don’t Ever Take Sides With Anyone Against The Family Again. Ever.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>One of the scariest things about Michael Corleone was his death stare and Fredo saw it for the first time after Michael’s confrontation with Moe Greene. Fredo was the middle brother in the Corleone family but was passed over by Michael following Sonny&rsquo;s death because it was assumed by everyone that Fredo was too incompetent to protect the business. When Fredo tries to talk sense into his younger brother, he gets a lesson in how Michael would deal with his brother when he had to, and this animosity between the two reaches its boiling point in The Godfather Part II.</p>
<p>5  &ldquo;If Anything In This Life Is Certain, If History Has Taught Us Anything, It Is That You Can Kill Anyone.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II</p>
<p>By the beginning of The Godfather Part II, Michael had become so cold that the thought of killing someone didn’t make him flinch, and he’d firmly established in his mind that killing a person, or several, was often the best solution to his problems. When Tom attempted to argue against assassinating Hyman Roth, claiming that the man was too well-protected and that not even the president was as well-guarded, Michael was completely unfazed. This memorable Michael Corleone quote shows just how ruthless a tactician Michael truly was when he was pushed into a corner.</p>
<p>4  &ldquo;Only Don&rsquo;t Tell Me That You&rsquo;re Innocent. Because It Insults My Intelligence And It Makes Me Very Angry.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>In order to get Carlo (Gianni Russo) to admit that he played a part in Sonny&rsquo;s assassination, Michael assures Carlo that he&rsquo;s being exiled and not killed for his betrayal all the while knowing that he&rsquo;s about to have Carlo murdered if he confesses. It&rsquo;s also entirely possible that Michael would have had Carlo killed regardless of what he said. Michael has somewhat of a sixth sense when it comes to betrayal and here he mostly seems to be toying with Carlo, making this unlikable man who had abused his sister and gotten his brother killed suffer before he&rsquo;s killed.</p>
<p>3  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Ask Me About My Business, Kay.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>This Michael Corleone quote has become one of the more famous lines from the Godfather trilogy as it exemplifies Michael’s turn for the worst. By the end of the film, Michael has lost a part of his soul following the murder of his brother and his first wife. When Kay asks Michael if it&rsquo;s true that he had Carlo killed, he looks her in the eye and lies to her. The soft and caring man that Kay had fallen in love with was gone, and he had been replaced by a ruthless leader who would distance himself from the people he cared about most because he believed it protected them.</p>
<p>Every Godfather Movie Ranked From Worst To Best
The Godfather Saga has evolved into a cultural &amp; artistic milestone over time. Here&rsquo;s every film (&amp; remake) in the trilogy ranked from worst to best.</p>
<p>2  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Not Personal, Sonny. It&rsquo;s Strictly Business.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather</p>
<p>The scene where Michael shoots McClusky and Sollozzo is one of the most famous of the entire Godfather trilogy, and it changed Michael as a character drastically, but sometimes it can get lost that Michael was the one who convinced the others to let him do it. The impressive thing was how he was able to sway opinions about himself and go through with the plan. Michael&rsquo;s cold-hearted ways would soon replace Sonny&rsquo;s hot-headed approach, and this was the beginning of the calculating leader Michael would become as the head of the family.</p>
<p>1  &ldquo;Just When I Thought I Was Out. They Pull Me Back In.&rdquo;
Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part III</p>
<p>Sadly for Michael, he’s always going to be associated with being a gangster despite him always wanting to leave that life behind. Even when he was neck-deep in criminal activities, Michael had intentions to be out of it. Due to this, it&rsquo;s easy to sympathize with him when he realizes he&rsquo;s back in the game in The Godfather Part III. Pacino&rsquo;s delivery of this iconic Michael Corleone quote has often been imitated, several times by Steven Van Zandt in The Sopranos, but it&rsquo;s never been bettered.
