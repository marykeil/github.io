# 8 Star Wars Secrets Artoo Definitely Knew In The Original Trilogy (&amp; Why He Didn t Tell Luke)


## SUMMARY 


 

R2-D2 knew critical secrets about the Jedi, Anakin, and Luke&#39;s lineage but chose not to disclose them.


Artoo&#39;s knowledge of Yoda&#39;s identity and his history with Obi-Wan could have been helpful to Luke, but he remained silent.


Artoo witnessed major moments with PadmÃ© and Anakin, but kept Luke unaware of his mother&#39;s identity, perhaps because it was too painful.

## Literature Review
R2-D2 knew a number of important secrets in the Star Wars original trilogy, but he had good reasons for keeping many of them from Luke.
