# 10 Horror Movie Moments That Never Happened (But You Swear You Remember)


## SUMMARY 


 Many popular horror movie moments are commonly misremembered or misconstrued, leading to widespread misconceptions in pop culture. 
 Examples include Lugosi&#39;s Dracula never saying &#34;I want to suck your blood&#34; and Heather in The Blair Witch Project saying &#34;I&#39;m so sorry&#34; instead of &#34;I&#39;m so scared.&#34; 
 In movies like Halloween and Se7en, the lack of graphic violence and specific imagery leaves much to the viewer&#39;s imagination, fueling false memories and theories.

## Literature Review

Many popular horror moments have been distorted in collective memory, and the truth is that they either happened differently or didn&#39;t happen at all.




Many horror movies have become so popular and influential that there are various misconceptions about them, leading the audience to swear some things happened one way when they were actually very different or didn’t happen at all. It’s not uncommon for memories of specific movie moments to become distorted with time and most viewers remembering them one way, and some of these corrupted memories end up becoming part of pop culture, making it harder to believe that, in reality, they were completely different or, simply, they never happened.
The horror genre is no exception to this, and there are many moments, scenes, dialogues, and details that viewers swear happened in one specific way. The reasons for these misconceptions vary, from misinformation, confusion with other similar works, sequels, or extended media, famous parodies that changed key details, and even urban legends. Many of these wrong memories are now so ingrained in pop culture and collective memory that it comes as a shock to learn or realize that they didn’t happen or happened in a very different way, but in all cases, the truth doesn’t affect the movie’s quality nor its legacy.
            
 
 10 False Horror Movie Myths (&amp; How They Were Debunked) 
Many horror movies were the subject of myths, whether due to the themes in them, on-set tragedies, or rumors about the actors, among other things.












 








 10  Bela Lugosi&#39;s Dracula Never Said “I Want To Suck Your Blood” 
There are many misconceptions around Lugosi’s Dracula


 







Bela Lugosi’s Dracula is, arguably, the most famous version of the famous vampire, but even though he was the inspiration for subsequent portrayals of the Count, many details associated with him are wrong. The biggest one is the belief that Lugosi’s Dracula says “I want to suck your blood”, with his heavy Hungarian accent, but he never says that line. In fact, Lugosi’s Dracula isn’t even shown drinking his victims’ blood, and he didn’t say the line either in his subsequent appearances as the vampire. It’s unclear when and where this idea began, but it might have been in Tim Burton’s Ed Wood, as its version of Bela Lugosi says this line.





 9  Heather Is Sorry, Not Scared In The Blair Witch Project 
Heather’s speech is slightly different
        

One of the most memorable scenes in The Blair Witch Project is when Heather films herself at night, scared and crying, leaving a message for her, Mike, and Josh’s families in case they don’t survive. Heather is believed to say “I’m so scared”, but the real line is “I’m so sorry”, as she apologizes to her colleagues’ families. The confusion might come from what Heather says shortly after about being scared to open and close her eyes, and was only made more popular when Scary Movie parodied the scene with the line “I’m so scared”.





 8  Gremlins’ Antagonist Is Stripe, Not Spike 
Stripe’s physical appearance can be confusing
        

When the rules of how to take care of a mogwai are broken many times in Gremlins, a mogwai antagonist is born. This monstrous creature has a white strip of fur on his head and is named Stripe, but many people believe his name is actually Spike. It&#39;s unclear how this idea began, but it might be that Stripe&#39;s design evokes the name “Spike” rather than “Stripe”, and the former being a name more associated with villains than the latter.





 7  There&#39;s Almost No Blood in Halloween 
Michael Myers didn’t leave a trail


 







Despite being a slasher movie and introducing one of the most popular serial killers in the horror genre, Halloween isn’t a bloodfest, as many believe or wrongly remember. Surprisingly, Halloween lacks graphic violence and blood, which allowed John Carpenter to focus on the characters and the menace that was Michael Myers, who could be hiding in the shadows anytime, anywhere. Surely, subsequent Halloween movies didn’t follow this example and went for blood and graphic scenes, but the movie that kicked off the franchise showed almost no blood and only had one graphic murder (Judith’s).





 6  Billy Never Asks Their Victims To Play A Game In Saw 
Billy will play the game whether you want it or not
        

When the victims of John Kramer (Tobin Bell) a.k.a. Jigsaw wake up and find themselves in one of his traps, they are given instructions and details on a recorder or a TV screen. In the case of the latter, the message is delivered through Billy, a puppet created by Kramer who has become the image of the Saw franchise. Billy is wrongly quoted as beginning his message with “Hello [victim’s name]. Do you want to play a game?”, when in reality, Billy doesn’t ask, he just states that he wants to play a game, giving the victims no option other than going through the game or facing a painful death.





 5  The Inside Of The Box Is Never Shown in Se7en 
The insides are known but not shown
        

David Fincher’s Seven has a disturbing plot twist when serial killer John Doe takes detectives Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and Mills (Brad Pitt) to a remote location where a package for Mills is delivered. Doe was inspired by the seven deadly sins and his “envy” murder consisted of killing Mills’ pregnant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), and sending him her head in a box. Somerset is the one who opens the box and sees what’s inside, but Fincher never shows the audience Tracy’s head inside the box.
Fincher has talked about this wrong idea as he has come across people who insist Tracy’s head was shown, and shared with The Guardian that he once met a woman at a cocktail party who complained to him about showing the head in the box, with Fincher adding that “the imagination, if properly primed, can do more than any army of makeup artists”.





 4  Regan Has A Feeding Tube in The Exorcist 
The feeding tube has always been there
        

Regan MacNeil’s (Linda Blair) condition rapidly worsens in The Exorcist due to Pazuzu possessing her, to the point where, when Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) and Father Karras (Jason Miller) arrive, she’s tied to her bed, her skin is gray and with various cuts, and her eyes are yellow. Before the exorcism begins, Karras meets Regan to see if they are truly dealing with a case of demonic possession, and it’s during this visit that the infamous projectile vomit moment happens. What many don’t remember is that, at that particular moment, Regan has a nasogastric tube. This scene is also wrongly remembered as part of the exorcism, and during the real deal, Regan doesn’t have the feeding tube, so it’s easy to see where this misconception comes from.





 3  When Jason Voorhees Gets His Mask in the Friday the 13th Saga 
Jason didn’t get his hockey mask right away


 







There’s a popular but incorrect idea that Jason Voorhees has always been the villain in the Friday the 13th franchise, when in the first movie, it was his mother, Pamela, who committed the murders, and Jason (as the decomposed corpse of a child) only briefly appeared at the end. Another misconception about Jason Voorhees is about his iconic hockey mask, as he’s believed to have always had it, but it wasn’t until Friday the 13th Part III that he got his hockey mask, which he took from one of his victims. Before this, Jason covered his head with a burlap bag with one eyehole.
            
 
 Friday The 13th: How Jason&#39;s Hockey Mask Changes In Each Movie 
Friday the 13th&#39;s Jason Voorhees is best known for wearing a hockey mask, which has changed a lot through the years. Let&#39;s take a look.








 2  Hannibal Lecter Never Said “Hello Clarice” In Silence of the Lambs 
Hannibal greeted Clarice differently
        

When Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) meets Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the latter gives a simple but chilling greeting, which has been endlessly misquoted as “hello Clarice”. Lecter simply says “good morning” to Clarice when they first meet, and at the end of Silence of the Lambs, when he calls her, he begins with “well, Clarice”. It’s unclear when and how the idea of “hello Clarice” began, though it might have to do with the many parodies of Lecter and the movie.
In the 2001 sequel, Hannibal, Lecter did say “well, hello Clarice”. 






 1  Rosemary’s Baby Is Never Shown 
Luckily, Rosemary’s demonic child was never revealed to the audience
        

All the suspense, tension, and horrors that Rosemary (Mia Farrow) and the audience go through in Rosemary’s Baby culminate with the confirmation that she is giving birth to the Antichrist. At the end of Rosemary’s Baby, Rosemary finds the hidden access to the Castevet’s apartment, where she finds her newborn child in a bassinet draped in black with an upside-down cross hanging over it. Rosemary takes a look and is immediately horrified, asking what’s wrong with the baby’s eyes. The baby is never shown, but many insist on seeing the baby’s face or hooves, which is another example of the imagination filling the blanks after all the anticipation and suspense viewers are put through.
