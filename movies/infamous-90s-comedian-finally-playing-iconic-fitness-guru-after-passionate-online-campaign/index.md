 How Pauly Shore’s Richard Simmons Role Came to Be 
          

Shore’s role as Simmons comes after a long bout of fans campaigning for Shore to play him in something. Fans of Shore pointed out how similar the comedian looked to the famous fitness personality, and thought that he could well-portray him in the role. Shore himself said “I am him” in relation to Simmons, saying that he is “a little over the top as well,” much like the fitness star.

Shore finally accepted the challenge to play Simmons in The Court Jester, which will be directed by Jake Lewis. Lewis is experienced at creating films based on famous people, having made a short film about Robin Williams a few years ago (Robin Test Scene), and making the short film The Cowboy &amp; The Samurai last year, which highlights the relationship between Jack Nicholson and John Belushi. The Court Jester will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival this week.

The Court Jester will take place in the early 2000s as Simmons is preparing to appear on Ellen. Throughout the short, Shore’s Simmons will work with a bumbling PA (played by Jesse Heiman), as he gets ready for his appearance. Based on the trailer for The Court Jester, Shore does indeed bear a starling likeness to Simmons that will serve him well in the much-encouraged role.
