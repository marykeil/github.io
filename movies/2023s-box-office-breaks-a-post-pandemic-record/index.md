## Literature Review

2023 becomes the best box office year since the pandemic as the year rounds out with an impressive estimated domestic total, despite some major flops.




2023’s total domestic box office numbers are the highest yet in the post-pandemic era. While the year saw several big studio flops — including The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny — the year also brought the Barbenheimer phenomenon as well as some surprise end-of-year hits. The top film of the year at the box office went to Barbie, which made $636 million domestically and $1.4 billion total at the worldwide box office.




According to The Hollywood Reporter, 2023’s domestic box office total comes in at just over $9 billion overall. This represents a 20% increase from last year, which came in at a $7.5 billion total. The last year the box office reached this height was in 2019, when the total came out to $11.4 billion. As 2023 rounds out with roughly $9.03 billion to $9.05 billion, this will mark the best box office year after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.


 Will The Box Office Continue To Improve in 2024? 
         

While the box office still has not reached pre-pandemic numbers, crossing $9 billion is a great sign for the film industry overall. A big part of the box office success this year can be traced back to Barbenheimer (the release of Barbie and Oppenheimer), which was thought to bring people back to the movies who had not been in a long time. This summer success was matched with end-of-year surprises in both Wonka and The Color Purple, which showed strong end-of-year box office performances.






The Color Purple opened to over $18 million on Christmas.




Hollywood hopes that this box office momentum will continue forward into 2024, but there may be factors in the way of that. After summer saw huge boosts this year, the fall slowed down significantly while the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes raged on. Both strikes have caused production delays that affect the 2024 release calendar, which could potentially threaten the 2024 box office.

However, 2024 already has some hopeful hits based on early predictions. The sci-fi sequel Dune: Part Two is set for release on March 1, 2024, after being delayed from a fall 2023 release. Spring 2023 will also see the release of the anticipated action film The Fall Guy as well as the long-awaited Mad Max prequel Furiosa. These films and more will work to keep the 2024 box office trending upward, even as strike delays continue to threaten Hollywood.
