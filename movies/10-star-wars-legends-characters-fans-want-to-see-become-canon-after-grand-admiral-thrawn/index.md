## Literature Review

There are many different characters throughout Star Wars Legends that fans would like to see become canon, both Jedi and Sith alike. 




Grand Admiral Thrawn&#39;s live-action Star Wars debut proves Legends characters can easily make the jump into canon, and here are ten characters we&#39;d love to see brought back. Star Wars has always been a transmedia franchise, with countless spinoffs in other mediums. The so-called &#34;Expanded Universe&#34; allowed other creators the chance to play in George Lucas&#39; sandbox, but Disney declared the EU &#34;Legends&#34; (or non-canon) after they purchased Disney in 2012.
Since then, Lucasfilm has mined Legends for some of the best ideas. The most obvious example is Grand Admiral Thrawn, the villain of Ahsoka (and likely the upcoming movie set in The Mandalorian era). Thrawn&#39;s example means it&#39;s entirely possible other characters will be brought back into canon, and here are ten who fans would love to see.
            
 
 Upcoming Star Wars Shows In 2023: Story, Casts &amp; Everything We Know 
2023 will be a busy year for Star Wars on Disney&#43;. Here&#39;s an overview of every Star Wars show expected to premiere on the streaming service this year.












 








 10  The Force-Sensitive Leader Of Rogue Squadron 
Corran Horn
        

There&#39;s a sense in which Obi-Wan Kenobi set up Corran Horn, a Corellian investigator who fled the Empire and became a key member of Rogue Squadron in Legends - only to discover his Force-sensitivity, and become a member of Luke Skywalker&#39;s Jedi Order. Lucasfilm may have canceled Patty Jenkins&#39; Rogue Squadron movie, but the studio is clearly interested in these concepts. It would be thrilling to see Corran Horn become canon.





 9  Darth Bane&#39;s Powerful Apprentice 
Darth Zannah
        

There were many Sith introduced in Star Wars Legends, but none so interesting as Darth Zannah. Possessing the powerful ability to use Force magick, something even her master Darth Bane was incapable of doing, Darth Zannah was most famous for her duel with her master. This duel ended in a draw, showing just how powerful she had become over the course of his teaching. She was the first Sith to carry on Darth Bane&#39;s Rule of Two, instilling the belief that there should only be two Sith at any given time. Zannah has been name-dropped in canon, but she really needs to be brought back as a character.





 8  A Bitter Sith In A Jedi Disguise 
Kreia


 







Appearing as one of the first characters encountered in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II, Kreia can be a difficult person to read. She at first makes herself out to be a powerful Jedi, one who was exiled after her Padawan, the Jedi Knight Revan, eventually became one of the most powerful Sith to ever live. However, after spending time with the Jedi Exile, also known as Meetra Surik, it is revealed that Kreia had long ago fallen to the dark side and become the Sith Lord Darth Traya, disillusioned by the deaths on the planet Malachor V during the Mandalorian Wars.





 7  The Imperial Officer That Became A Jedi 
Kyle Katarn
        

Originally appearing in the 1995 Star Wars: Dark Forces video game series, Kyle Katarn began as an Imperial Officer that began empathizing with the Rebellion after meeting Jan Ors, a Rebel operative who would eventually become his wife. In a similar plot to that of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Kyle Katarn was the one who stole the plans for the Death Star in Star Wars Legends, eventually joining the Jedi and helping Luke Skywalker to rebuild the Jedi Order after the war. Many even believe that Kyle Katarn might be making an appearance in the upcoming video game Star Wars: Outlaws.





 6  Darth Traya&#39;s Apprentice, The Lord Of Hunger 
Darth Nihilus


 







Another famous Sith Lord from the Extended Universe, Darth Nihilus made his debut as one of the main villains of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II. After he survived Revan&#39;s massacre of the Sith planet Malachor V during the Mandalorian Wars he became addicted to consuming Force energy. This compulsion became so powerful and all-consuming that he could ravage entire planets, absorbing the Force energy from every person who was connected to the Force and killing them.





 5  Mandalore The Preserver, Leader Of The Mandalorians 
Canderous Ordo
        

A veteran of the bloody Mandalorian Wars, Canderous Ordo later made a name for himself as a mercenary for the local crime lord on the planet Taris, where he met an amnesia stricken Revan. After assisting Revan in their quest to find the Star Forge he, along with Revan, claimed the Mask of Mandalore. In doing this, Canderous became the leader of the remaining Mandalorians, taking the name Mandalore the Preserver and reuniting his people under one banner.

As the greatest warriors in the Star Wars galaxy, Mandalorians have a rich and expanding history, and this is their full timeline in canon explained.








 4  The Children Of Leia Organa And Han Solo 
Jaina, Jacen, and Anakin Solo
        

Although it seems as though these three have been replaced in canon by the likes of Ben Solo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and beyond, many would still love to see the twins Jaina and Jacen and their younger brother Anakin Solo could come to canon. In Star Wars Legends the three of them served as Jedi in Luke Skywalker&#39;s New Jedi Order, with Jacen eventually turning to the dark side and becoming Darth Caedus much like Ben Solo does when he becomes Kylo Ren. These characters are sadly Legends-only - but that won&#39;t stop some fans dreaming.





 3  Luke Skywalker&#39;s Wife, The Former Emperor&#39;s Hand 
Mara Jade
        

Over the course of her life Mara Jade has played many roles, quickly becoming one of the most important members of the Empire due to her cold demeanor and strong ability to use the Force. When Emperor Palpatine was killed she grew enraged, focusing her hatred on killing Luke Skywalker who the Emperor had ordered her to hunt down and kill on his behalf. However, after being forced to work with Luke by her then employer, the smuggler Talon Karrde, the two of them grew close and eventually married. Mara is a uniquely complex character, and her relationship with Luke Skywalker added another dimension to his character, one currently missing in canon.





 2  Starkiller, Darth Vader&#39;s Sith Apprentice 
Galen Marek


 







Starring in the beloved action game series Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Galen Marek was stolen from his mother&#39;s arms by Darth Vader when he was a child. Trained to use his considerable power in the dark side of the Force, from then on he acted as Darth Vader&#39;s personal assassin, much like the Inquisitors of modern canon. After being betrayed by Darth Vader in his attempt to stop the Rebellion before it even started he turned against the Empire, bringing hope to future Rebels with his eventual death.





 1  The Sith Amnesiac With An Uncertain Future 
Darth Revan
        

Perhaps the single most popular character in the entire Extended Universe, Darth Revan is a multifaceted character with many stories to tell. First appearing as the player&#39;s avatar in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Revan begins their story with amnesia, tasked with finding the Jedi Bastila Shan. It is eventually discovered that the player was once a Sith named Revan, responsible for killing countless people during the Mandalorian Wars. Revan has been officially canonized in Star Wars - courtesy of the Sith legions of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - but they need to become an actual character once again.
