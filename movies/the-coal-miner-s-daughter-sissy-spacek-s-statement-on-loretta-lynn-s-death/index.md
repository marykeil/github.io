## Literature Review

Sissy Spacek plays Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter, a music biopic based on the singer&#39;s life. After Lynn passed, Spacek shared heartfelt words.




Sissy Spacek plays Loretta Lynn, the real-life country music singer in Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter, and the musician&#39;s death left a lasting imprint on Spacek. Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter is an adaptation of the book of the same name by George Vecsey, which is a biography of country music legend, Loretta Lynn. The film tracks Lynn&#39;s journey from her teen years in the 1940s as part of a desperately poor Kentucky family to an influential country superstar by the late &#39;50s. It&#39;s a romantic, inspiring, and heartbreaking film with powerful music that showcases exactly why Lynn was so popular. Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter earned seven Academy Award nominations.




The movie&#39;s sole Oscar win was Best Actress for Spacek. Her performance as Lynn was widely lauded, also earning a Golden Globe win as well as a Grammy nomination for Best Female Country Vocal Performance due to the fact she sang in the movie, including the titular and nominated track, &#34;Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter&#34;. Spacek has had an acting exemplary career appearing in such wildly different movies as Brian De Palma&#39;s Carrie to the comedy spoof Hot Rod. With six Academy Award nominations, it&#39;s hard to choose her best role, but Loretta Lynn may be her most personal.

 Sissy Spacek Is &#34;Heartbroken&#34; Over Loretta Lynn&#39;s Death 
          




On October 4, 2022, Loretta Lynn passed away at the age of 90 in her home of Hurricane Mills, Tennessee (via AP News). In 2017, Lynn suffered a stroke that kept her from touring but the tenacious singer who had never in her life let circumstance define her, released her 50th solo studio album, Still Woman Enough, just a year before her passing. Along with Lynn&#39;s many fans, Sissy Spacek was particularly mournful of her friend. She told Deadline:



&#34;The world lost a magnificent human being. Loretta Lynn was a great artist, a strong and resilient country music pioneer and a precious friend. I am heartbroken. I send my deepest sympathies to her wonderful family, her friends, and her loyal fans.&#34;






 Lynn Announced Spacek Would Be Playing Her On The Tonight Show 
          

When Loretta Lynn heard that there would soon be a film made about her, she knew there was only one person to play her in Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter: Sissy Spacek. She announced as much on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, saying, &#34;Sissy Spacek is going to play me.&#34; This turned out to be as much a surprise to Spacek as it was to the audience because the actress had yet to agree to do the film and was even leaning away from taking the part, figuring it would be too daunting a task. However, Lynn&#39;s endorsement was enough for her to sign on, and a friendship quickly formed.




Spacek and Lynn worked together on Coal Miner&#39;s Daughter so that Spacek could develop the Appalachian accent, singing style, and speech patterns of the singer. It was even Lynn who encouraged Spacek to actually sing rather than lip sync. Spacek later said of Lynn, &#34;When I met her, it was like meeting a long-lost friend.&#34; (via Wide Open Country) Their collaboration led to not only one of the best country music movies but also Spacek&#39;s best performances and expanded interest in Lynn&#39;s singing. However, even more substantial than either of their individual successes was their long-lasting friendship.
