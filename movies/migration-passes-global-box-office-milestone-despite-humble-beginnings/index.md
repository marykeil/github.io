## Literature Review

After a disappointing opening weekend, the animated film Migration has passed a major box office milestone, indicating a potential comeback.




After a weak opening weekend, Migration manages to pass a major global box office milestone. From Despicable Me studio Illumination Entertainment, Migration is an animated feature following an anxious duck family making a migratory trek that leaves them trouncing around on a New York City adventure. The film is directed by Benjamin Renner and Guylo Homsy, and features a leading voice cast of Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Keegan-Michael Key, Danny DeVito, and Awkwafina.




Per Collider, the recently released Migration has crossed a major global box office milestone after New Year’s weekend. As it rounds out its third week in theaters, Migration’s global box office has now surpassed the $100 million mark. This total represents a 40% increase over the film’s opening weekend and leaves it at the number 3 spot for the New Year’s extended box office.

Illumination Entertainment is the massively successful studio behind not only Despicable Me, but its hit spinoff series Minions. There were high hopes for the studio’s next original film, Migration, as it hit theaters close to the holidays. Migration’s paltry opening weekend ($12.3 million) earnings situated the feature as the worst opening weekend for any of Illumination Entertainment’s 14 feature films.




                  Migration Ending Explained   Illumination&#39;s Migration is a sweet story about a family of ducks on a life-changing journey. Here&#39;s what the movie&#39;s heartwarming ending means.    



Migration&#39;s 40% increase from the opening weekend is particularly notable, as films are typically expected to see gradual dips by their third week.




Despite its humble beginnings, Migration seems to be on a recovery path at the box office. Passing $100 million against the current box office competitors is no easy feat. Alongside it in theaters, Migration competes against Wonka, The Color Purple, Anyone but You, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Both Wonka and The Color Purple have seen unprecedented success in their runs thus far, making them formidable competitors for the animated film.

As Migration continues its theatrical run, the film’s box office has ample hope to grow. Its 40% increase from the opening weekend is particularly notable, as films are typically expected to see gradual dips by their third week. Being a holiday season release, Migration has the potential to capitalize on the staying power that is typically offered by this time of year. The recent box office milestone may only be the beginning of Migration’s burgeoning comeback story.
