## Literature Review

Margot Robbie gives a new update on her future as Harley Quinn in the DC Universe, which will be overseen by James Gunn and Peter Safran.




With James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe coming up, Margot Robbie offers a new update as to whether she&#39;ll be back as Harley Quinn. The DCEU timeline may be over, following the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, but some actors are coming back for Gunn&#39;s DC Universe. From Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller to John Cena&#39;s Peacemaker, Gunn isn&#39;t getting rid of everything from the DCEU while rebooting characters like Superman and Batman.




One player who many have been wondering if she will be back or not is Robbie as Harley Quinn, who made her latest appearance in 2021&#39;s The Suicide Squad. In a new Variety profile, Robbie was asked if she is done playing Harley Quinn, with Lady Gaga set to play the character next in Joker: Folie à Deux. Robbie stressed that she was always hoping for Harley Quinn to become a character who gets played by many different actors. She shared the following:


I always wanted Harley to be a character that would get passed on to other actresses to play, the way there are so many iconic male characters. That was always the dream for her. Harley’s so fun and can go in so many different directions. You put her in someone else’s hands, and it’s like, “What are they going to do with her?” The options are endless.


                  Every Suicide Squad Movie That Didn&#39;t Happen &amp; Why   Over the years, several Suicide Squad movies have been planned in various DC franchises that did not come to fruition for one reason or another.   





 Where Harley Quinn Could Appear In James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe 
         

With Gunn&#39;s DC Universe, there are multiple directions that Harley Quinn could go, whether with Robbie or a new actress. Batman: The Brave and The Bold is one DC Studios movie in the works, and theoretically, Harley Quinn could be one of several Gotham City character who pop up in the film. Given that Damian Wayne is being introduced, the primary villain will likely be the Al Ghul family, meaning Harley Quinn would only be able to have a small role.

However, a recent DC Studios TV show that was revealed to be part of the DC Universe is Matt Reeves&#39; Arkham series. If anything, showing Harley Quinn in Arkham Asylum and how she eventually breaks out - as is the case with most Batman villains - could offer a new angle for her character. There could also be flashbacks of her when she was still working there as a psychiatrist prior to her abusive relationship with Joker.






Following Robbie&#39;s comments, Gunn and DC Studios have not responded to whether or not Harley Quinn will be recast.




The DC Universe movie that would be most fun to see for Harley Quinn, however, is Gotham City Sirens, which was one of the many projects Warner Bros. tried to develop during the DCEU era. Given how popular Harley Quinn is, audiences will likely not have to wait too long to see her in Gunn&#39;s DC Universe. Hopefully, DC Studios will clarify Robbie&#39;s DC Universe involvement sooner rather than later.
