Summary

  Julianne Moore&#39;s decision to star in The Hunger Games franchise was influenced by her daughter&#39;s love for the books.   Moore initially bought the books for her son, but ended up being captivated by the story herself and saw a potential role for her.   The possibility of a Hunger Games prequel exploring the backstory of Moore&#39;s character, President Coin, has been suggested, particularly in relation to a fan theory linking her to a character from the latest installment.  






Julianne Moore reveals what prompted her decision to star in The Hunger Games franchise as President Alma Coin. First introduced in 2014’s The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1, Moore played the calculating President of District 13 and a key figure in the second rebellion of Panem that sought to overthrow the tyrannical government of Coriolanus Snow (Donald Sutherland). Hiding her ruthless ambition behind a deceptive mask of carefully measured civility, Coin was assassinated by Jennifer Lawrence’s Katniss Everdeen while she was tasked with Snow’s public execution.

During an interview clip posted to TikTok by People Magazine, Moore revealed that her decision to star in The Hunger Games movies was solely due to her daughter reading the books upon which they were based.


 

Explaining that she had originally bought the books for her son, the actor picked up a copy while on vacation and had nothing else to read and quickly became impressed with the story. Check out her comments below:


I&#39;m only in The Hunger Games because my daughter was reading [them.] I actually bought the books for my son, he&#39;s older than my daughter, and she was reading them. We were on vacation, I had nothing to read, and I picked the copy of this book, and I was like, &#34;This is amazing. Oh, my God, I think there&#39;s a part for me.&#34; And it might have been the only thing my kids ever cared about that I was in. It was fantastic for them.



 How Julianne Moore’s Hunger Games Character Could Return In A Future Movie 
          

Initially portrayed as a more fair and ethically minded counterpoint to ruthless despot Coriolanus Snow, it quickly became apparent that Moore’s President Coin was just as callous and calculating as the man she sought to overthrow. However, as significant as Coin became to the events of the final two Hunger Games movies, much of her backstory is still shrouded in mystery. Much like the tale of District 13’s continued survival as an underground state, Moore’s character represents an untold story ripe for expansion in another potential Hunger Games prequel.

With the recent release of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes reigniting interest in the franchise, viewers are already calling for more movies set in the dystopian world of Suzanne Collins’ Panem. Moreover, with one popular Hunger Games fan theory directly linking Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler) with Moore’s character, a District 13 story focused on a young Alma Coin could also serve as a direct follow-up to the franchise’s latest installment.

Yet before any such movie can happen, Collins herself will need to be the one to craft the story as a book. Director Francis Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson have both stated they will not make another Hunger Games movie without Collins involved, with the former suggesting that it is “better to leave a franchise as something people feel fondly about rather than crank out a sequel for the sake of a sequel.” However, should Collins decide to continue her hit series, introducing a younger version of Moore’s Alma Coin and explaining her possible relationship with Lucy Gray Baird could form an exciting central premise.
