<p>The Boondock Saints<br>
Action
Thriller</p>
<p>Release Date    January 22, 1999     Cast    Willem Dafoe , Sean Patrick Flanery , Norman Reedus , David Della Rocco , Billy Connolly     Runtime    108 minutes</p>
<p>Despite poor reviews upon release, underground hit The Boondock Saints became a defining 90s cult classic. The movie stars Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus as fraternal twins who turn to vigilantism in order to protect their predominantly Irish Boston neighborhood. Boondock Saints was a box office failure when the studio only gave it a bare minimum theatrical release, but the movie found huge success on home video and remains popular over two decades later.

Fight Club (1999)</p>
<p>Fight Club</p>
<p>Release Date    October 15, 1999     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Brad Pitt , Meat Loaf , Edward Norton , Jared Leto , Helena Bonham Carter     Runtime    139 minutes</p>
<p>1999&rsquo;s Fight Club is one of the most controversial films of the 1990s, and is now available to stream on Peacock. Starring Edward Norton as the Unnamed Narrator alongside Brad Pitt as the inimitable Tyler Durden, David Fincher&rsquo;s Fight Club is based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk. It is a scathing takedown of consumerist culture that includes many brutal and unflinchingly violent fight scenes, as well as a quite literally explosive finale. While the shocking twist in Fight Club helped it reach notoriety, the deeply cerebral action movie is among the best available on Peacock thanks to the performances of Norton and Pitt, with Fight Club being a career highlight for both.</p>

Fight Club’s famous rules are far more complex than they first appeared. Some yielded fascinating results, and others reveal the Narrator’s identity.</p>

The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)</p>
<p>The Wolf of Wall Street</p>
<p>Release Date    December 25, 2013     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Margot Robbie , Leonardo DiCaprio , Jonah Hill , Kyle Chandler     Runtime    3hours</p>
<p>With an ensemble cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Margo Robbie, Jonah Hill, and Matthew McConaughey, the 2013 Martin Scorsese drama The Wolf of Wall Street is widely regarded as one of the best movies released in the 2010s. DiCaprio&rsquo;s performance as real-life stockbroker Jordan Belfort won him a Golden Globe.
Despite winning far fewer awards than it was nominated for, The Wolf of Wall Street is a truly inimitable drama with plenty of comedic elements, and the true story it&rsquo;s based on almost defies belief. The movie is included on many critics&rsquo; Top 10 lists, with the American Film Institute ranking it as among the best released in 2013, and the UK&rsquo;s BBC placing it in the 100 greatest films of the 21st Century (via BBC).
Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)</p>
<p>Glengarry Glen Ross</p>
<p>Release Date    October 2, 1992     Director    James Foley     Cast    Al Pacino , Jack Lemmon , Alec Baldwin , Ed Harris , Alan Arkin , Kevin Spacey , Jonathan Pryce     Runtime    100 Minutes</p>
<p>Based on David Mamet&rsquo;s 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name, and boasting one of the most stacked casts ever assembled, Glengarry Glen Ross proves that a movie doesn&rsquo;t need a huge budget and massive explosions in order to be dramatic. Built around breakneck dialogue and powerhouse performances, the movie follows the fortunes of a team of real estate salesmen put under immense pressure after they are informed that they have one week to outsell their coworkers, or else they will be fired. What follows is a cutthroat corporate fight to the death, replete with gloriously inventive profanity and more backstabbing than the average Game of Thrones episode, all resulting in one of the &rsquo;90s best movies.

The Passion Of The Christ (2004)</p>
<p>The Passion of the Christ</p>
<p>Release Date    March 15, 2004     Director    Mel Gibson     Cast    Jim Caviezel , Monica Bellucci , Maia Morgenstern     Runtime    127minutes</p>
<p>Controversial and gripping in equal measure, Mel Gibson&rsquo;s The Passion of the Christ is an undeniably powerful piece of work. The self-financed movie documents the final days and execution of Jesus Christ as laid out in the Bible. The film made over $612 million at the box office (via Box Office Mojo), making it the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time. The Passion of the Christ also secured three Oscar nominations at the Academy Awards, despite its graphic violence and extreme scenes of torture.

Monster (2003)</p>
<p>Director: Patty Jenkins | Runtime: 1h 49m
Cast: Charlize Theron (Aileen Wuornos), Christina Ricci (Selby Wall), Bruce Dern (Thomas), Lee Tergesen (Vincent Corey)
Although director Patty Jenkins would go on to best-known for her superhero hit Wonder Woman, her 2003 crime biopic Monster probably remains her most powerful effort to date. The movie follows the life of serial killer Aileen Wuornos (Charlize Theron), a sex worker who killed seven of her male clients in two years. The movie charts her relationship with another woman, Selby Wall (Christian Ricci), and shows how her tragic life perhaps turned her into a cold-blooded killer. Both Theron and Ricci received praise for their performances, with Theron winning the Oscar, Golden Globe, and SAG Awards for her transformation into Aileen for the movie.

<p>Best Comedy Movies On Peacock
Strays (2023)</p>
<p>Strays</p>
<p>Release Date    June 9, 2023     Director    Josh Greenbaum     Cast    Will Ferrell , Jamie Foxx , Will Forte , Isla Fisher , Randall Park , Josh Gad , Brett Gelman , Rob Riggle , Jamie Demetriou , Sofia Vergara</p>
<p>Like Ted and Sausage Party, Strays may look like a movie for kids, but it certainly is not. It&rsquo;s a raunchy, crude comedy about a Border Terrier named Reggie (voiced by Will Ferrell) who is abandoned by his owner Doug (Will Forte). Officially on his own, Reggie befriends a group of stray dogs who teach him street smarts and agree to accompany him on his quest for revenge against Doug. While it was a box office bomb, what makes Strays so successful is that it knows exactly the kind of comedy it is. However, amidst the filth and foul language is a surprising amount of heart that makes it worth a watch — without the kids.

Happy Gilmore (1996)</p>
<p>Happy Gilmore</p>
<p>Release Date    February 16, 1996     Director    Dennis Dugan     Cast    Adam Sandler , Christopher McDonald , Julie Bowen , Frances Bay , Carl Weathers , Allen Covert     Runtime    92 minutes</p>
<p>Few names in comedy are as widely recognized as Adam Sandler, and one of the highlights of his career, 1996&rsquo;s Happy Gilmore, is one of the funniest movies currently available to stream on Peacock. Happy Gilmore stars Sandler as the titular Happy, a former ice hockey player with significant anger issues. After his NHL dreams are brought to a close, Happy tries his hand at a new sport — golf.
While the powerful slap shot from his hockey days makes him an outstanding golfer, Happy also finds his temperament on the rink doesn&rsquo;t translate well to the green at all. While Happy Gilmore didn&rsquo;t win over critics on release, it resonated with audiences and continues to do so, remaining arguably one of the best Adam Sandler movies of the 1990s.
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)</p>
<p>Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby</p>
<p>Release Date    August 4, 2006     Director    Adam McKay     Cast    Will Ferrell , John C. Reilly , Leslie Bibb , Gary Cole , Michael Clarke Duncan , Sacha Baron Cohen     Runtime    108 Minutes</p>
<p>While Anchor Man: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers may be the most well-known of Will Ferrell&rsquo;s comedy movies in the 2000s, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is an underrated gem starring Ferrell alongside John C. Reilly, Amy Adams, Jane Lynch, and Sasha Baron Cohen. It&rsquo;s one of the funniest movies currently available on Peacock, and despite not being as acclaimed as some of his later works (such as the aforementioned Step Brothers that once again saw him collaborate with John C. Reilly), Talladega Nights delivers Will Ferrell&rsquo;s unique brand of comedy in spades.
Ferrell plays the titular Ricky Bobby in this NASCAR-lambasting sports comedy. The hilarious plot sees Bobby lose everything as his career crumbles around him, and he has to work his way back up to the top to beat rival Jean Girard (Sasha Baron Cohen) — a European Formula 1 driver who&rsquo;s entered the NASCAR circuit just to prove how easily he can dominate it. The cast is packed with many of Ferrell&rsquo;s regular collaborators, including David Koechner and Rob Riggle, and as far as comedy movies on Peacock go, few can elicit more laughs.</p>
<p>Best Romance Movies On Peacock
Meet Cute (2022)</p>
<p>Meet Cute</p>
<p>Release Date    September 21, 2022     Director    Alex Lehmann     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , Pete Davidson , Deborah S. Craig , Sierra Fisk     Runtime    89 minutes</p>
<p>A Peacock original rom-com, Meet Cute asks what would you do if you could create the perfect romantic partner? The movie follows Sheila (Kaley Cuoco), a woman who meets the shy Gary (Pete Davidson) at a bar. The two have a romantic date on the town, but there&rsquo;s a twist: Sheila has been using time travel to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; Gary&rsquo;s past wounds and traumas and mold him into her ideal man.
With the likes of Palm Springs and the forever-classic Groundhog Dog, time travel rom-coms are becoming a popular genre, and though Meet Cute will likely never achieve icon status, it poses some interesting questions about pain, healing, and ethics, and how they relate to love. Cuoco and Davidson are both charming actors, and their easy chemistry makes the movie feel like it passes by in no time at all.

Sliding Doors (1998)</p>
<p>Sliding Doors (1998)</p>
<p>Release Date    April 24, 1998     Director    Peter Howitt     Cast    gwyneth paltrow , John Hannah , John Lynch , Jeanne Tripplehorn</p>
<p>A classic &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; story, Sliding Doors uses an unconventional narrative to explore the romantic possibilities determined by its lead character&rsquo;s success or failure in boarding a train. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Helen, a PR officer fired from her job who faces two divergent paths in life. In one universe, she manages to catch a train home and finds new luck in love. In another, she misses her train and continues to be beset by bad luck. However, it soon becomes clear that all is not as straightforward as it seems. Praised for its complex storytelling and chemistry between its two leads, Sliding Doors is a classic romantic comedy that hits all the right notes.

The Illusionist (2006)</p>
<p>The Illusionist</p>
<p>Release Date    August 18, 2006     Director    Neil Burger     Cast    Edward Norton , Paul Giamatti , Jessica Biel , Rufus Sewell , Eddie Marsan , Jake Wood     Runtime    109 Minutes</p>
<p>Due to its subject, The Illusionist has drawn a lot of comparisons with Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s The Prestige, which was released the same year. However, while Nolan&rsquo;s movie is a complex and intellectual puzzle box, The Illusionist has a much more romantic sensibility. Following Nolan&rsquo;s Eisenheim and his ill-fated love affair with a woman deemed far above his social standing. Both a gripping mystery and heartfelt romance, The Illusionist was unfairly overlooked by many on release and remains one of the best romance movies on Peacock.

<p>Best Fantasy Movies On Peacock
The Twilight Saga (2008 - 2012)</p>
<p>Twilight</p>
<p>Release Date    November 21, 2008     Director    Catherine Hardwicke     Cast    Robert Pattinson , Ashley Greene , Peter Facinelli , Rachelle Lefevre , Elizabeth Reaser , Kristen Stewart , Nikki Reed , Jackson Rathbone , Cam Gigandet , Kellan Lutz , Taylor Lautner , Anna Kendrick , Billy Burke     Runtime    121 minutes</p>
<p>There are few fantasy movies available on Peacock that are as well-known as the Twilight saga. All five movies in the Twilight franchise, from 2008&rsquo;s Twilight to 2012&rsquo;s The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2 can be streamed on Peacock right now, bringing subscribers one of the best fantasy romance epics brought to the screen. Based on the novel series of the same name by Stephanie Meyer, Twilight focuses on a love triangle between vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson), werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner), and the human girl they&rsquo;re both infatuated with — Bella Swan, played by Kristen Stewart.
While it&rsquo;s heavily rooted in romance, every Twilight movie is rich in fantasy elements too, with a deep lore that has kept the franchise&rsquo;s fanbase loyal despite a decade passing since Breaking Dawn - Part 2 was released. While not every movie in the Twilight saga is equal, though even the worst stand head-and-shoulders above the dozens of other fantasy-flavored romance films. The Twilight saga was incredibly successful at the box office, and for big-budget epics full of imagination and the supernatural, Peacock subscribers need look no further.
Highlander (1986)</p>
<p>Highlander</p>
<p>Director    Russell Mulcahy     Cast    Christopher Lambert , Roxanne Hart , Clancy Brown , Sean Connery , Beatie Edney , Alan North     Runtime    116 minutes</p>
<p>The original Highlander kickstarted a popular franchise that never reached the heights of its first installment. In Highlander, Connor MacLeod is an immortal being in a world where a secret war rages to determine who will be the last fighter standing. It is up to Connor to make sure that evil immortals never have the chance to claim true immortality, bringing him into battle with the murderous Kurgan (Clancy Brown). Highlander is a cult classic and spawned several sequels and even a TV series based in the same world with a different immortal MacLeod.

Mortal Kombat (2021)</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat (2021)</p>
<p>Release Date    April 23, 2021     Director    Simon McQuoid     Cast    Jessica McNamee , Matilda Kimber , Mehcad Brooks , Lewis Tan , Sisi Stringer , Joe Taslim , Daniel Nelson , Hiroyuki Sanada , Chin Han , Max Huang , Laura Brent , Tadanobu Asano , Elissa Cadwell , Ludi Lin , Josh Lawson     Runtime    110 minutes</p>
<p>The 2021 video game adaptation Mortal Kombat comes from director Simon McQuoid, and is one of the best movies based on a video game to release over the last several years. Much like the series of classic beat-em-ups, 2021&rsquo;s Mortal Kombat focuses on a grand tournament wherein the greatest warriors of Earth must fight to the death against the champions of other realms - with the prize being that, should they win, the mortal realm will remain safe and unconquered. Loss, however, will spell disaster. With incredible special effects throughout and some standout performances from a relatively unknown cast, Mortal Kombat is one of the most exciting — and violent — fantasy movies currently on Peacock.</p>
<p>Best Family Movies On Peacock
Sing (2016)</p>
<p>Sing</p>
<p>Release Date    December 21, 2016     Director    Garth Jennings     Cast    Seth MacFarlane , Leslie Jones , Scarlett Johansson , Taron Egerton , Jennifer Saunders , Nick Offerman , Reese Witherspoon , Nick Kroll , Matthew McConaughey , Peter Serafinowicz , John C. Reilly , Jay Pharoah     Runtime    110minutes</p>
<p>Hit musical comedy Sing was a highlight of the big-budget animated family movies to arrive in the latter half of the 2010s, thanks in no small part to its all-star cast. Bosting the likes of Matthew McConaughey, John C. Reilly, Scarlett Johansson, Reese Witherspoon, and Seth MacFarlane to name a few, it&rsquo;s difficult to overstate the star power that this family movie on Peacock brings. However, the cast list isn&rsquo;t why Sing became so beloved — it was its incredible musical numbers, laugh-out-loud comedy movies, and heartwarming story about never giving up on one&rsquo;s dreams that ensured it received a sequel and a lasting legacy.
Sing follows talking Koala Buster Moon (McConaughey) in a city full of other talking animals. Buster has one goal in life; to run a successful theater. While he has the theater when the movie begins, the success is still a little ways out of his reach, and much further away than he is from the bank trying to close his venue. Buster decides to risk everything by throwing a talent contest to put his theater back on the map. While the plot unfolds to a relatively predictable conclusion (this is a movie aimed at all ages, after all), the steps Buster takes on his way to getting there are guaranteed to be a surprise.
Megamind (2010)</p>
<p>Megamind</p>
<p>Release Date    November 11, 2010     Director    Tom McGrath     Cast    Will Ferrell , Ben Stiller , Brad Pitt , Jonah Hill     Runtime    96minutes</p>
<p>2010&rsquo;s Megamind isn&rsquo;t the most widely known Dreamworks movie, but it has an incredibly loyal fanbase both thanks to the many memes it&rsquo;s spawned and Will Ferrel&rsquo;s performance as the titular villain. Megamind is an animated superhero-movie spoof aimed at young audiences, though it never leans too far into its parody elements.
Instead, Megamind is a hilarious and incredibly solid story about a supervillain who suffers an existential crisis after defeating his nemesis (Metro Man, played by Brad Pitt), once and for all. Ferell and Pitt are joined by Jonah Hill, Ben Stiller, David Cross, and Tina Fey, with Tom McGrath&rsquo;s direction ensuring that Megamind is currently one of the funniest family movies available to stream on Peacock.
Shrek (2001)</p>
<p>Shrek</p>
<p>Release Date    May 18, 2001     Director    Vicky Jenson , Andrew Adamson     Cast    Cameron Diaz , Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , John Lithgow     Runtime    90 minutes</p>
<p>For a film that was famously a punishment project for animators (via New York Post), Shrek somehow manages to both lampoon and honor its fairytale source material. The movie, much like the rest of the Shrek franchise, follows the titular ogre (Mike Myers) as he sets out on a quest to rescue the cursed and imprisoned Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) for the tyrannical Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).
While there are a lot of great non-Disney fairytale adaptations, Shrek has managed to stand out by mocking their most frustrating tropes and rejecting the idea that goodness and beauty must be connected. Other than being one of the best movies on Peacock, Shrek also has the distinction of winning the first-ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

<p>One of the most culturally significant series ever released, the Harry Potter saga remains a defining story for multiple generations. Following the adventures of an orphaned boy wizard and his friends as they battle against the dangerous dark lord Voldemort, the films are a broadly faithful retelling of J.K. Rowling&rsquo;s seminal novels. Spanning over a decade, the eight films represent an ambitious feat of contiguous storytelling, maintaining an impressive cast across almost all the entries. As popular today as it was when first released, the Harry Potter franchise is a hugely immersive and enjoyable journey.

The Black Phone (2022)</p>
<p>The Black Phone</p>
<p>Release Date    June 24, 2022     Director    Scott Derrickson     Cast    Ethan Hawke , Mason Thames , Brady Hepner , James Ransone , Jordan Isaiah White , Jeremy Davies , Jacob Moran , Madeleine McGraw     Runtime    102 minutes</p>
<p>Ethan Hawke almost turned down the role of The Grabber in The Black Phone, as he didn&rsquo;t want to play a villain, so it&rsquo;s a good thing the script was so strong, as Hawke changed his mind and delivered one of the most terrifying movie killers in recent horror movie history. The movie centers on Finney (Mason Thames), a bullied teen who is kidnapped by the Grabber but can get help from his captor&rsquo;s past victims via the use of a supernatural phone. Along with Hawke&rsquo;s chilling performance, the movie builds its terror with atmosphere and doesn&rsquo;t rely on jump scares. Horror fans among Peacock subscribers will want to dial into The Black Phone​​​​​​, as it&rsquo;s one of the most chilling released in the last decade.

They/Them (2022)</p>
<p>They/Them</p>
<p>Release Date    August 5, 2022     Director    John Logan     Cast    Monique Kim , Carrie Preston , Anna Lore , Cooper Koch , Kevin Bacon , Austin Crute , Quei Tann , Anna Chlumsky , Darwin del Fabro , Theo Germaine     Runtime    90 minutes</p>
<p>Peacock and Blumhouse Productions come together for They/Them (pronounced &ldquo;they slash them&rdquo;), an unforgettable slasher-horror. It follows a group of LGBTQ+ teens at a conversion camp who find themselves stalked by a masked killer. The slasher genre has a disturbing, problematic history of killing off sexually active and minority characters, so it&rsquo;s refreshing to see a movie like They/Them side with the marginalized leads. The story itself may be by-the-numbers, but They/Them makes a bold statement about who the real monsters are — and it&rsquo;s not the killer in the mask.

Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil (2010)</p>

<p>Release Date    September 30, 2011     Director    Eli Craig     Cast    Tyler Labine , Katrina Bowden , Alan Tudyk , Chelan Simmons , Jesse Moss     Runtime    89 minutes</p>
<p>Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is far from the scariest horror movie on Peacock, but it sure is one of the funniest — and smartest, as it has a lot to stay about the genre. The titular main character (Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk) are a couple of good-natured hillbilly friends who want to enjoy a simple fishing trip together when a group of teenagers mistakenly perceive them as deranged killers. From there, the misunderstandings and the bodies continue to pile up with hilarious results. By flipping the &ldquo;backwoods hillbilly killer&rdquo; horror trope on its head, Tucker and Dale vs. Evil delivers a lot of laughs — and a surprisingly poignant message.

<p>Ti West directed two of the most critically acclaimed horror movies of 2022 with X and its prequel Pearl. However, he had shown his immense talent 13 years earlier when he directed the cult-favorite horror movie The House of the Devil. The movie is a typical horror tale about a girl at a house in a remote location who finds herself hunted by a Satanic cult. However, while this is a story that has been told before, West delivers it in a style that&rsquo;s both a throwback to 80s horror classic while still maintaining contemporary relevance.

The movie gained a cult following, and Donnie Darko&rsquo;s ending and timeline are still being analyzed and debated to this day.

<p>Several classic Universal Monster movies were reimagined with varying success in the 2000s, but the best of them is undoubtedly The Invisible Man. Directed by Leigh Whannell (Saw) and produced by Blumhouse, Elisabeth Moss stars as Cecilia, a woman trapped in an abusive relationship. After she escapes from her partner&rsquo;s home and hides out, she learns he took his own life and left her $5 million. However, it soon transpires that he hasn&rsquo;t died at all, and has instead created a way to turn invisible and torment her once more. The movie made $144 million on a $7 million budget (via Box Office Mojo) and was universally acclaimed, winning multiple year-end awards.

<p>All Invisible Man Movies, Ranked Worst To Best
There are many Invisible Man adaptations that expand on the classic character, but here’s a ranking of how they all stack up against one another.</p>
<p>Train To Busan (2016)</p>
<p>Train to Busan</p>
<p>Release Date    July 1, 2016     Director    Yeon Sang-ho     Cast    Gong Yoo     Runtime    118minutes</p>
<p>While zombie movies had started to fall out of favor by 2016, the South Korean horror movie Train to Busan brought something new to the oversaturated genre, revitalizing interest in the walking dead. What helped this movie achieve success was the focus on a father and his daughter at the outbreak of the zombie apocalypse, and their fight for survival together, as well as the movie&rsquo;s innovative setting of a speeding train. The movie won several awards and received almost universal acclaim after its release. It also spawned a franchise, with an animated prequel, a standalone sequel, and an American remake in development.

Night Of The Living Dead (1968)</p>
<p>Night of the Living Dead</p>
<p>Release Date    October 4, 1968     Director    George A. Romero     Cast    Judith O&rsquo;Dea , Kyra Schon , Duane Jones , Marilyn Eastman , Karl Hardman     Runtime    96 minutes</p>
<p>George Romero changed everything about the zombie genre with his 1968 movie Night of the Living Dead. Before this seminal hit, the zombie genre was mostly rooted in misunderstood Haitian voodoo rituals. However, Romero created a new lore of the dead rising from their graves and feeding on the living with this movie, at a stroke creating the modern zombie genre. The movie was also groundbreaking for bringing a Black hero to the lead in a horror movie. Sadly for Romero, he failed in his copyrighting of the movie, immediately bringing it into the public domain following release.

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974)</p>
<p>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</p>
<p>Release Date    October 11, 1974     Director    Tobe Hooper     Cast    Marilyn Burns , Edwin Neal , Jim Siedow , Gunnar Hansen , Paul A. Partain     Runtime    83 minutes</p>
<p>One of the most iconic and unsettling horror movies ever made, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a raw and terrifying peek behind the mask of madness. Filmed on a shoestring, the film takes typical slasher tropes like traveling teenagers, isolated houses, and a power tool-wielding villain to new extremes, pushing boundaries like few films before or since. The heat of the overbearing Texas sun emanates through the screen, contributing to the film&rsquo;s tense and suffocating atmosphere. Gunnar Hansen&rsquo;s Leatherface is one of the scariest antagonists ever conceived, and the movie&rsquo;s central story of a family of cannibals hunting innocent passersby remains truly terrifying nearly five decades after release.

Freaky (2020)</p>
<p>Freaky</p>
<p>Release Date    November 13, 2020     Cast    Misha Osherovich , Vince Vaughn , Celeste O&rsquo;Connor , Kathryn Newton , Uriah Shelton , Dana Drori , Alan Ruck , Katie Finneran     Runtime    101 minutes</p>
<p>The 2020 body-swap movie Freaky is one of the best horrors available to stream on Peacock right now. Directed by Christopher Landon, the creative mind behind Happy Death Day, Vince Vaughn and Kathryn Newton star in Freaky as a serial killer and his would-be victim. However, just as Newton&rsquo;s Millie is about to be killed by Vaughn&rsquo;s deranged Blissfield Butcher, the two switch bodies. What follows is a horror comedy that&rsquo;s just as hilarious as it is gruesome, with Vaughn&rsquo;s performance as a teenage girl trapped in the body of a middle-aged man being especially noteworthy.
American Psycho (2000)</p>
<p>American Psycho</p>
<p>Release Date    April 13, 2000     Director    Mary Harron     Cast    Jared Leto , Reese Witherspoon , Chloe Sevigny , Willem Dafoe , Justin Theroux , Christian Bale     Runtime    101 minutes</p>
<p>Although Bret Easton Ellis&rsquo; original shocking novel was widely considered unfilmable (largely due to its gruesome contents), Mary Harron&rsquo;s American Psycho is an important reminder that some challenges are simply a matter of imagination. Like the book, the movie follows yuppie Patrick Bateman as he juggles his Wall Street banking job with his murderous predilections. Bleakly funny and a damning indictment on consumerism and the superficial nature of the American corporate system, American Psycho might lack some of the novel&rsquo;s shock value, but it is nevertheless a surprisingly successful adaptation and one of the best horror movies on Peacock.
