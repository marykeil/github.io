Summary

  The Iron Claw is a biographical sports drama that tells the tragic story of the Von Erich family, who faced constant battle with death and experienced unimaginable tragedies.   The film accurately depicts the deaths of Jack Adkisson Jr., David Von Erich, Mike Von Erich, and Kerry Von Erich, showcasing the impact of these deaths on the family and their wrestling careers.   While the movie leaves out some details, such as Chris Von Erich&#39;s suicide and David&#39;s possible drug overdose, it still effectively portrays the heartbreaking events and the devastating Von Erich curse.  







Although A24&#39;s The Iron Claw has many moments of joy and humor, there are also many upsetting and tragic moments as well, and the saddest scenes of all are those related to the deaths of several members of the Von Erich family. The Iron Claw is a biographical sports drama starring Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, Harris Dickinson, Maura Tierney, Holt McCallany, and Lily James. The film surrounds the Von Erichs, a family of four boys from Texas that follow in their father&#39;s footsteps and become pro wrestlers, but their dreams are dashed by the tragic Von Erich curse. The Iron Claw is an adaptation of a true story.

What makes The Iron Claw such an outstanding movie is the fact that Kevin Von Erichs&#39; true story is simply unbelievable. Audiences are not unaccustomed to seeing tragedy on-screen, but the Von Erichs experienced much more than just bad times. Their constant battle with death over the course of many years is not only upsetting, but also beyond belief at times. But then again, this is what makes the film so impactful and moving. Notably, The Iron Claw delves into the stories of all the Von Erichs besides one. The Iron Claw left out Von Erich family member Chris Von Erich, however, he also died at a young age via suicide.





 Jack Adkisson Jr. 
         

The first member of the Von Erich family to pass away in The Iron Claw was Jack Adkisson Jr. Although Jack&#39;s death did not occur on-screen, his tragic fate is still imperative to the story. Jack Adkisson Jr. was the first son of Jack Adkisson, otherwise known as Fritz Von Erich, and Doris Von Erich. According to the film, he died when he was very young, and it was unclear what exactly caused his death. Despite this, Jack&#39;s death deeply affects the Von Erichs. Although the other boys barely knew their brother, his death remains important to them, as he is still considered family.

In real life, Jack Adkisson Jr. died on March 7, 1959. While in Niagara Falls, New York, Jack stepped on a trailer tongue and got electrocuted. After that, he fell into a puddle of melting snow and died by drowning. Jack was only six years old at the time of his death. In many ways, Jack&#39;s death, though it happens off-screen, is an early indicator of the Von Erich curse. His tragic childhood death almost acts as an omen for what is to come for the rest of the Von Erich boys.






 David Von Erich 
          

Although Jack Adkisson Jr. was technically the first Von Erich to die in The Iron Claw, the first actual on-screen death is that of David Von Erich. David is the third-eldest Von Erich boy, after Jack and Kevin. In the film, David becomes Kevin&#39;s partner in the wrestling ring, and the two become a popular duo. Later, his younger brother Kerry joins them, creating the formidable Von Erich Family. After Kevin&#39;s wedding to Pam, wherein David appears sick, David travels to Japan to fight Ric Flair for the title of world champion, but while there, he dies of enteritis, or intestine inflammation.

In general, David&#39;s death in The Iron Claw is fairly accurate to the real life series of events. On February 10, 1984, David Von Erich was in Tokyo, Japan when he died suddenly of enteritis. He was 26 years old. However, one aspect of David&#39;s death that the movie does not broach is the theory that David died, not of enteritis, but of a drug overdose. In his autobiography, Ric Flair wrote that fellow wrestler Bruiser Brody found David and flushed his drugs down the toilet. Another aspect of David&#39;s life that the movie did not discuss was David&#39;s two marriages and his daughter, who died in infancy.






 Mike Von Erich 
          

The next member of the Von Erich family to die in The Iron Claw was Mike Von Erich. Mike was the fifth Von Erich child. In the film, he appears to be the black sheep of his family, interested in pursuing music rather than athletics. However, after David&#39;s death, Mike begins training to be a wrestler to take his brother&#39;s place. According to the film, Mike is in the midst of a wrestling match when he falls onto his shoulder and promptly goes into a toxic shock induced coma. Although he survives his injuries, Mike suffers brain damage, and soon after, takes his own life via pills.

Of the four Von Erich deaths depicted in The Iron Claw, Mike&#39;s story is the most changed. Although it is true that Mike took his own life in 1987, the lead-up to this event was quite different. First and foremost, Mike Von Erich did not hurt his shoulder while wrestling, but received the injury while on a tour of Israel. Additionally, this injury did lead to toxic shock syndrome, however it is unclear whether he suffered from brain damage. Like David, Mike was also married before his death, but the movie does not depict this. Mike was 23 at the time of his death.






 Kerry Von Erich 
          

The final Von Erich brother to die in The Iron Claw was Kerry Von Erich. Kerry was the fourth son of Jack and Doris Von Erich. In The Iron Claw, Kerry is set to attend the 1980 summer Olympics, however when the U.S. boycotts the games, Kerry returns home and joins Kevin and David as a pro-wrestler. Notably, after David&#39;s death, Kerry took David&#39;s place in the world champion match against Ric Flair and won. Furthermore, Kerry loses his right foot in a motorcycle accident, and later, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the heart. Kerry&#39;s death is the final tragedy at the end of The Iron Claw.

In real life, Kerry&#39;s tragic end is very similar. In 1986, Kerry got into a motorcycle accident that nearly took his life, but ultimately, led to his foot being amputated. Though Kerry returned to wrestling, he kept the amputation a secret from the public. Some differences from The Iron Claw include the fact that Fritz Von Erich found Kerry at the time of his death rather than Kevin. Additionally, it is unclear whether Kerry told Kevin about his suicidal feelings, but wrestler Bret Hart has stated that Kerry told him about his plans to join his deceased brothers in heaven. Kerry was married and had two daughters.
