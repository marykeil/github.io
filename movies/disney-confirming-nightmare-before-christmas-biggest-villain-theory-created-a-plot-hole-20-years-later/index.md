# Disney Confirming Nightmare Before Christmas Biggest Villain Theory Created A Plot Hole 20 Years Later


## SUMMARY 



  The confirmation that Oogie Boogie is the Shadow on the Moon creates a plot hole regarding his banishment from Halloween Town.   Oogie Boogie&#39;s inclusion in the opening song &#34;This Is Halloween&#34; goes against his exile, as Jack wouldn&#39;t allow him to represent Halloween Town.   Oogie Boogie&#39;s ability to take on two forms, including the terrifying Shadow on the Moon, emphasizes his sinister nature and potential for chaos.

## Literature Review

By confirming a theory about a villain from The Nightmare Before Christmas in 2013, Disney created a plot hole about his role in the movie.




A long-standing theory about The Nightmare Before Christmas’ primary villain, Oogie Boogie, was confirmed in 2013, which created a plot hole regarding his nefarious plans. Produced and based on a story by Tim Burton, The Nightmare Before Christmas focuses on the frightening yet ultimately benevolent world of monsters, creatures, and spooky figures in Halloween Town. While The Nightmare Before Christmas’ Halloween Town characters are takes on classic scary monsters meant to frighten others, the 1993 stop-motion animated movie only has one major villain in the sinister Oogie Boogie.




Since Oogie Boogie was isolated for the majority of the movie until Lock, Shock, and Barrel kidnapped Santa Claus and sent him to the Boogeyman’s lair, various theories have abounded about the villain’s role in Halloween Town. It was confirmed in a video game for The Nightmare Before Christmas that Oogie Boogie was banished from Halloween Town before the 1993 movie’s events, which explained why he was so removed from the spooky community’s events and planning throughout the film. However, when Disney confirmed another theory about the villain’s identity in 2013, it ended up forming a plot hole regarding his banishment by Jack Skellington.

                  Tim Burton Created An Odd Nightmare Before Christmas Plot Hole 18 Years Later   Although Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas came nearly two decades before Frankenweenie, the 2012 film created an 18-year-old plot hole.    


 Disney&#39;s 2013 Villain Special Confirmed Oogie Boogie Is The Shadow On The Moon 
         




In Walt Disney World&#39;s 2013 Unleash the Villains stage show, and later in Disney&#39;s 2015 Hocus Pocus Villain Spelltacular show, a line about the monster revealed that he is, in fact, the Shadow on the Moon. Oogie Boogie being the Shadow on the Moon from The Nightmare Before Christmas’ “This Is Halloween” song had long been debated, but the Walt Disney World performance finally confirmed the theory. The Shadow on the Moon, one of the creatures in Nightmare Before Christmas’ opening sequence, had a silhouette that mirrored Oogie Boogie and was also voiced by Ken Page, yet made no reference to being the Boogeyman in the song.

                  The Nightmare Before Christmas 2: Tim Burton&#39;s Comments, Possible Story &amp; Everything We Know   A sequel to the 1993 stop-motion musical The Nightmare Before Christmas still isn&#39;t here, so where is The Nightmare Before Christmas 2?   

It seems that Oogie Boogie, revealed to be a burlap sack with hundreds of bugs crawling inside of him, has a second scary form with his Shadow on the Moon persona. While the Shadow could also be seen as a separate version of the character entirely, the Disney stage show links them together as one being. Furthermore, The Nightmare Before Christmas’ official social media pages have continued to confirm the Shadow as belonging to Oogie Boogie over the years. Consequently, though it appeared that Oogie Boogie was left out of The Nightmare Before Christmas’ opening song due to his exile, the confirmation that he’s the Shadow on the Moon means he actually was included with his own spooky verse.






 Oogie Boogie Being The Shadow Creates A Plot Hole About His Banishment From Halloween Town 
          

Oogie Boogie being confirmed as the Shadow on the Moon brings to rest a long-standing debate, but it also creates some inconsistencies with the villain’s banishment from Halloween Town. If Oogie Boogie was banished, it wouldn’t make sense for him to still be included in the characters’ celebration of Halloween, especially with his own verse in “This Is Halloween.” While it’s possible that Jack Skellington allows Oogie Boogie to return to Halloween Town only for the song on Halloween night, this doesn’t align with Jack’s other interactions with and antipathy for the Boogeyman throughout The Nightmare Before Christmas.

As the Pumpkin King, Jack wouldn’t want a malevolent figure like Oogie Boogie to represent the creatures of Halloween Town in the opening song. While Halloween Town’s residents are eager to scare others, they’re primarily gentle and well-meaning figures who get along with one another while celebrating the holiday. This isn’t the case for Oogie Boogie, whom Jack specifically tells Lock, Shock, and Barrel to leave out of his plans to take over Christmas. It seems that the only characters from The Nightmare Before Christmas that Oogie Boogie has seen since his banishment are the three trick-or-treaters, who aren’t even featured in the opening song themselves.



 Oogie Boogie Having 2 Forms Emphasizes How Terrifying He Was For Halloween Town 
          

With Oogie Boogie being the only major antagonist in The Nightmare Before Christmas, Jack had to have a strong reason for banishing him from Halloween Town. This may have partially been because Oogie Boogie, who was already more sinister in his intentions, could take on two separate forms in order to scare or harm others, an ability not shared by many other residents. While the vampires could become bats and Jack himself could take on his Pumpkin King persona, they didn’t have any motivation to harm their fellow residents – or even those in Christmas Town. Oogie Boogie, however, could cause significant chaos under his Shadow on the Moon form as well.




Even if Oogie Boogie’s Boogeyman form was banished from Halloween Town, it also seems to be much more difficult to banish his Shadow self from the area. Though he only appears at night, the Shadow on the Moon seems to give Oogie Boogie more power, especially as the only form he can take during the community’s “This Is Halloween” song. If Oogie Boogie could find a loophole in his banishment with the Shadow on the Moon, then he could have caused even more terror in Halloween Town in The Nightmare Before Christmas.
