## Literature Review

New images from Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire reveal a Titan &#34;specialist&#34; teaming up with two returning heroes from the previous movie.




New images from Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire offer a closer look at a Titan &#34;specialist&#34; joining two returning characters from the previous Monsterverse movie. The upcoming film will see its titular monsters team up to fight the Skar King, another ape Titan whose presence threatens the world. Rebecca Hall and Brian Tyree Henry will be reprising their roles as Dr. Ilene Andrews and Bernie Hayes respectively.




Now, Total Film (via GamesRadar) has revealed new images from the upcoming Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, featuring a new Titan expert alongside the returning humans. Portrayed by Dan Stevens (The Guest), the new character, Tracker, is described by director Adam Wingard as, &#34;a specialist in these creatures… If you’ve got a sick titan, Trap is your guy.&#34; Check out the new images below:

         


 What Role Will Humans Play In Godzilla x Kong? 
          

In previous interviews, Wingard has indicated the newest Monsterverse installment will be focusing on the Titans more than the people in the story. While Godzilla x Kong&#39;s human characters will still play a role in the film, it appears their involvement will be reduced compared to prior movies. This will give the movie&#39;s starring monsters a chance to shine as they try to stop the Skar King from terrorizing the world.




However, it&#39;s unclear what this means for the film&#39;s success now that it&#39;s been proven films like it can have engaging human stories. Toho&#39;s Godzilla Minus One had an incredible box office run, proving movies featuring the monster can have emotional, high-stakes stories that make audiences care about the humans involved. It&#39;s unclear if that same level of depth will be translated to the latest American monster movie. An engaging human story has also proven to be successful in the Monsterverse show Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.

Despite the film&#39;s promised deeper focus on the Titans, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire seems like it will still be providing memorable human characters like Tracker. The focus on the monsters also gives the Monsterverse its own identity, focusing on the Titans as the heroes. Perhaps the human story will weave into the Titans&#39; seamlessly, justifying the return of certain characters and the addition of others.



Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire arrives in theaters on April 12, 2024.
