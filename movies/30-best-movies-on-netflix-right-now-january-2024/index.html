With all the streaming content out there, you&rsquo;re bound to find a great horror film to enjoy for the season and Netflix is the best place to look at.</p>
<p>Best Drama Movies On Netflix
Leave The World Behind (2023)</p>
<p>Leave the World Behind</p>
<p>Release Date    December 8, 2023     Director    Sam Esmail     Cast    Julia Roberts , Mahershala Ali , Ethan Hawke , Myha&rsquo;la , Kevin Bacon     Runtime    141 Minutes</p>
<p>Between her work in Homecoming and Gaslight, Julia Robert is proving herself just as adept at taking on dark, dramatic subject matter as she is with feel-good rom-coms, and Leave the World Behind is another prime example. In the film, she plays Amanda Sandford, a wife and mother who takes her family on a spontaneous Long Island vacation. However, things go awry when none of their technology devices work, and a father and daughter show up at the vacation house claiming they live there. As Amanda gets closer to the father, G. H. (Mahershala Ali), she discovers that all these strange occurrences may be the result of a government conspiracy.
Leave the World Behind is written and directed by Sam Esmail, who in addition to being famous for creating Mr. Robot, produced Homecoming and Gaslit, and the movie proves to be another winning collaboration between him and Roberts. Like these other works, Leave the World Behind is a slow burn, which may not appeal to everybody. But Esmail knows how to turn up the dread and menace of technology on society, making Leave the World Behind more than worth the watch.

The Power Of The Dog (2021)</p>
<p>The Power of the Dog</p>
<p>Release Date    November 17, 2021     Director    Jane Campion     Runtime    126 minutes     Genres    Western , Drama</p>
<p>The 2020s have seen a cultural shift as society examines traditional values alongside new ones, particularly within art, and the Western movie genre is no exception. From acclaimed director Jane Campion, The Power of the Dog is the definitive revisionist Western. Based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage, the film stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Phil Burbank, a charming yet cruel rancher who uses toxic masculinity to torment those around him and repress his true desires.
The Power of the Dog landed on a staggering number of 10 best movie lists and its awards nominations were also numerous. Along with Cumberbatch, actors Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, and Kodi Smit-McPhee were all nominated for Oscars for their roles. Campion took home the Best Director statuette, becoming the first woman to win two Academy Awards in that category (her first was for The Piano). With its expert direction, stellar performances, and thought-provoking themes, The Power of the Dog is one of the best movies on Netflix.

All Quiet On The Western Front (2022)</p>
<p>All Quiet on the Western Front</p>
<p>Release Date    October 28, 2022     Director    Edward Berger     Cast    Felix Kammerer , Albrecht Schuch , Daniel Brühl     Runtime    150 minutes</p>
<p>Deservedly handed a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars, Netflix&rsquo;s 2022 adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque&rsquo;s classic novel All Quiet on the Western Front is a remarkable, stark meditation on the reality of war. Telling the story of World War I from the German perspective - typically not the side of the trenches cinema&rsquo;s light shines on - it is the first adaptation to be told in the original German.
It is an important movie, showing the harrowing experience of young soldiers thrown into battlefields, but it is also thoroughly entertaining thanks to its moving central performances. Even with the military genre potentially limiting wider audience interest, All Quiet on the Western Front is a genuinemust-see for Netflix subscribers.

Marriage Story (2019)</p>
<p>Marriage Story</p>
<p>Release Date    December 6, 2019     Director    Noah Baumbach     Cast    Ray Liotta , Merritt Wever , Kyle Bornheimer , Alan Alda , Mickey Sumner , Adam Driver , Mark O&rsquo;Brien , Julie Hagerty , Scarlett Johansson , Laura Dern     Runtime    136 minutes</p>
<p>In a close-run race, Marriage Story is the best Noah Baumbach movie, which hits all of his hallmarks as a filmmaker and is an incredible advert for the craft of directing. Even beyond those achievements, which matter less to Netflix viewers than the simple question of quality, Marriage Story is an incredible, much-watch movie that is easily one of the best movies on Netflix. If not the undisputed champion.
Starring Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson in twin career-best performances, Marriage Story is horribly compelling, showing the harrowing story of a couple whose initially amicable separation becomes a bitter divorce. It&rsquo;s like watching a world crumble in slow motion, with Driver and Johansson&rsquo;s on-screen son the tragic middle ground of a battle that is propelled almost accidentally towards catastrophe. And while it&rsquo;s very, very sad, Marriage Story&rsquo;s overall message about failure and future is a very important one.

May December (2023)</p>
<p>May December</p>
<p>Release Date    December 1, 2023     Director    Todd Haynes     Cast    Natalie Portman , Julianne Moore , Charles Melton     Runtime    113 Minutes     Genres    Drama , Romance</p>
<p>Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore are two of today&rsquo;s most respected actors, and the Oscar winners co-star in May December, directed by Todd Haynes. Loosely inspired by the Mary Kay Letourneau scandal, the film sees actress Elizabeth Berry (Portman) cast in a film to play the controversial public figure, Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Moore), who years earlier was caught having sex with her son&rsquo;s 13-year-old schoolmate, Joe Yoo. 23 years later, Gracie and Joe (Charles Melton) are married, and Elizabeth travels to Georgia to meet them and prepare for her role.
While it&rsquo;s no surprise that Portman and Moore are stellar as their characters, Melton all but steals the show. The Riverdale actor has been picking up awards steam, with Melton winning the Gotham Independent Film Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor. This taut three-hander movie is thought-provoking and uncomfortable, raising serious questions about age differences in romantic relationships. But for such weighty subject matter, May December also has moments of humor and levity, and will surely be talked about come Oscar season.

Whiplash (2014)</p>
<p>Whiplash</p>
<p>Release Date    October 10, 2014     Director    Damien Chazelle     Cast    Paul Reiser , Miles Teller , Melissa Benoist , J. K. Simmons     Runtime    107minutes     Genres    Drama , Music</p>
<p>Whiplash is the movie that made Hollywood and movie-going audiences alike take notice of wunderkind director Damien Chazelle. It stars Miles Teller as Andrew Neiman, an ambitious jazz drummer and first-year student at the prestigious Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Andrew is desperate to impress his sadistic instructor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), who justifies his abusive tactics as necessary for getting his students to produce great art.
Simmons&rsquo; Fletcher is as close to a monster as a human can get, yet his performance is multi-layered and never one-note. He was a lock for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar the moment he stepped on-screen, and he swept awards season as a whole. Whiplash puts forth a serious debate about the price of artistic excellence, while the music itself is intoxicating. Audiences will find their hearts fiercely beating in time to the pieces, as Whiplash is one of the most intense movies on Netflix — and also one of its best.

<p>Best Comedy Movies On Netflix
Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World (2010)</p>
<p>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</p>
<p>Release Date    August 13, 2010     Director    Edgar Wright     Cast    Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Brandon Routh , Kieran Culkin , Aubrey Plaza , Anna Kendrick , Jason Schwartzman , Alison Pill , Brie Larson , Chris Evans , Michael Cera     Runtime    112 minutes     Genres    Action , Romance , Fantasy , Comedy</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s much renewed interest in Scott Pilgrim, as the animated sequel series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off released in 2023 to rave reviews, and is one of the best TV shows on Netflix. Luckily, for fans of the cult film or viewers checking it out for the first time, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is also available on the streaming service. In the movie, Scott Pilgrim is a 22-year-old Torontonian and bassist for the indie band Sex Bob-Omb (Michael Cera). When Scott meets Amazon deliverywoman Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he is smitten. The only problem is that to date Ramona, Scott must defeat her seven evil exes.
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World bombed upon release but developed a cult following. It was universally praised by not just critics but also renowned filmmakers like Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino, particularly for its eye-popping, video game/comic book-esque visuals. The cast is also unbelievably stacked, as Cera and Winstead are supported by Kieran Culkin, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Jason Schwartzman, Brie Larson, and more — all of whom returned for the animated show, making the Scott Pilgrim movie and TV show the perfect binge-fest.

Blockers (2018)</p>
<p>Blockers</p>
<p>Release Date    March 14, 2018     Director    Kay Cannon     Cast    John Cena , Geraldine Viswanathan , Leslie Mann , Ramona Young , Miles Robbins , Ike Barinholtz , Graham Phillips , Kathryn Newton , Colton Dunn     Runtime    102minutes     Genres    Comedy</p>
<p>The sex comedy has come a long way from the days of Animal House and Porky&rsquo;s to even American Pie. 2018&rsquo;s Blockers marks an enormous step forward, and ushers sex-positivity around the subgenre. The film stars Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz as three parents whose daughters are best friends. When the parents discover the girls have made a pact to lose their virginities on prom night, they go on a wild adventure trying to stop them.
It&rsquo;s refreshing to see young women and their sexual desire be the catalyst for the film&rsquo;s events, as the teen sex comedy genre has historically limited female characters to conquered prizes and objects of the male gaze. While Blockers forces the viewer to question the parents&rsquo; actions as their antics get zanier and more desperate, it never leaves any question as to how much they love their daughters. Blockers is a hilarious raunchy comedy with a healthy side of sweetness.

Dolemite Is My Name (2019)</p>
<p>Dolemite Is My Name</p>
<p>Release Date    October 25, 2019     Director    Chelsea Gilson     Cast    T.I. , Keegan-Michael Key , Tituss Burgess , Kodi Smit-McPhee , Eddie Murphy , London Worthy , Wesley Snipes , Craig Robinson , Mike Epps , Chris Rock , Chelsea Gilson     Runtime    118 minutes     Genres    Biography , Comedy , Drama</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy had largely stepped out of the public eye in the 2010s, but he made a resounding, kick-the-door-down comeback with Dolemite Is My Name. In the Netflix comedy biopic, Murphy plays Rudy Ray Moore, a performer who adopts the persona of Dolemite, a foul-mouthed showman who dresses like a stereotypical pimp. Moore looks to break into blaxploitation films as Dolemite, but he&rsquo;s told he doesn&rsquo;t fit the toned physique of the industry standard. Not one to be deterred, Moore seeks to produce and star in his own movie, and he rounds up a crew of friends and misfits to help.
While Dolemite Is My Name is possibly Murphy&rsquo;s best movie, and he was absolutely robbed of an Oscar nomination, it&rsquo;s Da&rsquo;Vine Joy Randolph who steals the show as Lady Reed, a charming woman whom Moore convinces to tour with him and eventually star in his movie. Now gaining much-deserved attention and acclaim for her work in Only Murders in the Building and The Holdovers, this is Randolph&rsquo;s breakout role. A charming underdog story with an even more charming cast, Dolemite Is My Name is one of the best movies on Netflix.

Uncut Gems (2019)</p>
<p>Uncut Gems</p>
<p>Release Date    December 13, 2019     Director    Josh Safdie , Benny Safdie     Cast    Jonathan Aranbayev , Eric Bogosian , The Weeknd , Idina Menzel , Noa Fisher , Kevin Garnett , Tommy Kominik , LaKeith Stanfield , Jacob Igielski , Adam Sandler , Julia Fox , Keith Williams Richards     Runtime    134 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama , Crime</p>
<p>Between The Ridiculous 6 and Hubie Halloween, not every Adam Sandler-Netflix collaboration is a winner, but Uncut Gems knocks it out of the park and proves that the iconic comedy actors should take on serious roles more often. In the film, he plays Howard Ratner, a New York City jeweler with a serious gambling addiction that turns deadly.
Nobody does anxiety like the Safdie brothers, and Uncut Gems is so intense it feels like there&rsquo;s a ticking time bomb in every scene. That time bomb is Howard himself, and his self-destructive behavior is trainwreck level — an appropriate description considering it&rsquo;s impossible to look away. Uncut Gems is the opposite of a relaxing watch, but it&rsquo;s artistic, memorable, and haunting.

John Wick (2014)</p>
<p>John Wick</p>
<p>Release Date    October 24, 2014     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Michael Nyqvist , Willem Dafoe , Jason Isaacs , Keanu Reeves , Bridget Moynahan , Adrianne Palicki     Rating    R     Writers    Derek Kolstad</p>
<p>John Wick has managed to become one of the biggest action franchises of recent cinema, and three of the four films in the franchise are available to watch on Netflix: John Wick, John Wick Chapter 2, and John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum. Starring Keanu Reeves as the titular assassin, the franchise begins as an ex-hitman&rsquo;s dog is killed, and he comes out of retirement to go on a revenge mission that will draw him back into the world that he left behind.
The action sequences throughout are incredible, with impressively realistic approaches to guns combined with seemingly impossible kills by Wick, who is able to take down entire armies with little more than his bare hands. The franchise has become increasingly complex and fascinating, and has even launched a spin-off series, John Wick: Continental.
Enola Holmes (2020)</p>
<p>Enola Holmes</p>
<p>Release Date    September 23, 2020     Director    Harry Bradbeer     Cast    Millie Bobby Brown , Helena Bonham Carter , Sam Claflin , Fiona Shaw , Henry Cavill , Louis Partridge , Burn Gorman , Adeel Akhtar , Susie Wokoma     Runtime    123 minutes     Genres    Crime , Mystery , Drama , Adventure</p>
<p>Millie Bobby Brown became an A-list celebrity thanks to her breakout role as Eleven in Netflix&rsquo;s Stranger Things, so it&rsquo;s only fitting that her biggest and best movie role is also on the streaming platform. In Enola Holmes, Brown plays the eponymous heroine, the youngest sibling in a family that contains renowned detective, Sherlock Holmes. When their mother goes missing, Enola sets out to find her, and may just prove that Sherlock isn&rsquo;t the smartest Holmes after all.
Between movies like Glass Onion and Enola Holmes, Netflix is breathing new life into the murder mystery genre. Brown was casting genius, as films of this genre hinge on how much the audience roots for the detective at the center. The movieproved so successful that a 2022 sequel followed, and Enola Holmes 3 is in the works, proving that Netflix audiences can&rsquo;t get enough of the teenage detective.

RRR (2022)</p>
<p>RRR</p>
<p>Release Date    March 24, 2022     Director    S.S. Rajamouli     Cast    S.S. Rajamouli , Ram Charan , N.T. Rama Rao Jr. , Ajay Devgn , Alia Bhatt , Ray Stevenson     Runtime    187 Minutes</p>
<p>One of the most hotly talked-about international movies in recent years, RRR is the bombastic, brilliant Indian action movie that turned a lot of heads towards Bollywood. Drawing very loosely from real history, RRR follows two politically opposite revolutionaries from different backgrounds who come together to fight the British occupation of India during the 1920s. So far, so straight-forward, but that&rsquo;s really not what RRR is about, or why it&rsquo;s so great.</p>
<p>RRR Movie Ending Explained (In Detail)
Telugu blockbuster RRR has an explosive ending that comments on resisting oppression, and a dance number full of references to Indian history.</p>
<p>Part Braveheart, part superhero epic, RRR was the most expensive Indian movie ever made, and glories in its opulent size and commitment to super-realism. Netflix sadly doesn&rsquo;t have the original Telugu-language audio, but even dubbed it&rsquo;s hard not to get swept up in the momentum of the global box office hit. And if it means more Western attention to more movies like RRR, that can only be a good thing.

The Killer (2023)</p>
<p>The Killer (2023)</p>
<p>Release Date    November 10, 2023     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Michael Fassbender , Tilda Swinton , Kerry O&rsquo;Malley , Charles Parnell , Lacey Dover , Monique Ganderton , Sala Baker     Runtime    118 Minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Crime</p>
<p>David Fincher is a magnet for actors looking to tap into the dark side of their characters, and Michael Fassbender&rsquo;s titular anti-hero in The Killer is going to go down as one of his most memorable characters, which is saying a lot considering Fincher has given audiences Tyler Durden and the English-language version of Lisbeth Salander. Like The Narrator in Fight Club and Nick and Amy Dunne in Gone Girl, The Killer has the protagonist speak to the audience in voice-over, giving them a window into his twisted mind. Based on the French graphic novel of the same name by Alexis &ldquo;Matz&rdquo; Nolent and Luc Jacamon, The Killer centers on the nameless assassin (Fassbender) who deals with the massive fallout after a job goes wrong.
With as much substance as it has style, The Killer is yet another win for Fincher, whose sterling filmography is one of the most impressive of any working director today. The Killer will go down as one of Fassbender&rsquo;s greatest characters, and with any luck, he and Fincher will become frequent collaborators.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)</p>
<p>Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery</p>
<p>Release Date    December 23, 2022     Director    Rian Johnson     Cast    Dave Bautista , Daniel Craig , Edward Norton , Janelle Monae , Kathryn Hahn , Leslie Odom Jr. , Jessica Henwick , Madelyn Cline , Kate Hudson , Ethan Hawke     Runtime    139 minutes</p>
<p>The 2020s are a great time to be a fan of big movie sleuths, with Kenneth Branagh&rsquo;s Poirot carving out his own surprise shared universe and Daniel Craig&rsquo;s Benoit Blanc standing just on the other side of the parody line. Both detectives owe a lot of Agatha Christie, but Blanc is all the creation of Rian Johnson and Craig&rsquo;s performance, with is joyful. After Knives Out&rsquo;s success, Netflix brought the sequel, Glass Onion, to the platform, proving that their expensive acquisition model can still include absolute gems.
Here, Blanc is back as he&rsquo;s invited to a billionaire&rsquo;s personal island (a thinly veiled nod to Elon Musk, played by Ed Norton), to play along with a murder mystery. Naturally, participants — and Glass Onion&rsquo;s cast is another barn-stormer, like its predecessor — start dying for real, and Blanc is called into action. An Oscar nominee, Glass Onion is a great fix for anyone looking for a complex but rewarding mystery to get their teeth into.

Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023)</p>
<p>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</p>
<p>Release Date    June 2, 2023     Director    Joaquim Dos Santos , Kemp Powers , Justin K. Thompson     Cast    Shameik Moore , Hailee Steinfeld , Oscar Isaac , Jake Johnson , Issa Rae , Brian Tyree Henry , Luna Lauren Velez , Jorma Taccone , Jason Schwartzman     Runtime    120 Minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Animation , Superhero</p>
<p>The first movie in the series, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, was revolutionary for its awe-inspiring animation, and became only the sixth non-Disney/Pixar movie to win Best Animated Feature at the Oscars. And the franchise might strike gold again with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. The film picks up with Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) who travels through the Multi-verse with Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), where they happen upon an entire team of Spider-People. But things heat up when Miles and the Spider-People face a new threat and find themselves in conflict over how to defeat it.
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is every bit as beloved as the first film, with its stellar animation and thrilling action scenes. Unlike so many cinematic franchises that release movies to increasingly diminishing returns, Miles Morales has many more adventures in him as Spider-Man, and no matter where he goes, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse will always be remembered as one of his best.

The Deepest Breath (2023)</p>
<p>The Deepest Breath</p>
<p>Release Date    July 19, 2023     Director    Laura McGann     Cast    Alessia Zecchini , Stephen Keenan     Runtime    108 Minutes</p>
<p>A stunning, provocative look at one of the world&rsquo;s most dangerous, barely fathomable sports, the documentary The Deepest Breath is a fascinating profile of free diver Alessia Zecchini. As well as exploring Zecchini&rsquo;s quest to set a world record in free-diving, the documentary chronicles her relationship with her safety diver partner, Stephen Keenan, as well as the personal toll and associated dangers with the sport. The Deepest Breath is the perfect pick for anyone looking for Netflix&rsquo;s best documentary.
The documentary culminates in Zecchini&rsquo;s attempt to free-dive Blue Hole’s arch, a notorious tunnel 56m down into a sinkhole, which previously took the lives of other divers, including Natalia Molchanova in 2015. The shocking tragedy that unfolds is as compelling as the portrait of the sportswoman herself and the sport is intriguing. It&rsquo;s a strangely intoxicating film, whose most important message is arguably the final message Zecchini was sent before her attempt to dive through the arch: “Live for today for you never know what’s coming down the line.&quot;

<p>Tony Award-winning Cynthia Erivo has proven she is just as talented and magnetic on the screen as she is on stage, and Harriet is not only one of her best movies but one of the best on Netflix. In Harriet, she plays abolitionist and freedom fighter Harriet Tubman who escapes slavery and puts her life on the line to help others find freedom through the Underground Railroad.
Erivo was unsurprisingly nominated for a slew of awards for her portrayal of Tubman. In addition to receiving an Oscar nomination for her performance, she was also nominated for Best Original Song for &ldquo;Stand Up&rdquo;. Harriet doesn&rsquo;t reinvent the biopic wheel, but it exquisitely captures the story of one of the most important historical figures in American history, and Erivo gives a winning performance.

Maestro (2023)</p>
<p>Maestro</p>
<p>Release Date    December 20, 2023     Director    Bradley Cooper     Cast    Bradley Cooper , Carey Mulligan , Maya Hawke , Sarah Silverman , Matt Bomer     Runtime    156 Minutes     Genres    Biography , Drama , Music</p>
<p>Bradley Cooper may have first made a name for himself playing obnoxious jerks in raunchy comedies like Wedding Crashers and The Hangover, but he&rsquo;s now on his way to becoming one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most respected filmmakers. He had a splashy directorial debut in 2018 with A Star is Born, and he follows it up with another story about a musician, Maestro, a Leonard Bernstein biopic. Cooper plays Bernstein opposite Carey Mulligan as his wife, Felicia Montealegre. Maestro centers on the couple&rsquo;s tumultuous yet loving relationship as it weathers heartbreaking conflicts due to Bernstein&rsquo;s frequent affairs with men and his substance abuse.
While Hollywood was waiting with bated breath to see what Cooper would follow A Star is Born with, and he&rsquo;s the central figure as Bernstein, it&rsquo;s Mulligan who steals the show. She delivers a heart-wrenching performance, wholeheartedly capturing the trials and tribulations of being married to a successful artist, and is considered an early frontrunner in the 2024 Best Actress race at the Oscars. She and Cooper have layered, mature, and dazzling chemistry, and as a result, Maestro elevates the entire biopic genre.

Tick, Tick&hellip; Boom! (2021)</p>
<p>tick, tick&hellip; BOOM!</p>
<p>Release Date    November 12, 2021     Director    Lin-Manuel Miranda     Cast    Alexandra Shipp , Joshua Henry , Judith Light , Bradley Whitford , Robin de Jesús , Vanessa Hudgens , Tariq Trotter , Andrew Garfield , Mj Rodriguez     Runtime    115 minutes</p>
<p>Hamilton&rsquo;s Lin-Manuel Miranda is widely considered Broadway&rsquo;s latest visionary so it&rsquo;s only appropriate that his feature film directorial debut was about another legendary composer: Jonathan Larson, best known for writing the smash-hit musical Rent. Tick, Tick&hellip; Boom! follows Larson (Andrew Garfield) struggling to finish his musical Superbia before it&rsquo;s workshopped. Larson also puts increasing pressure on himself to become a successful composer before his looming 30th birthday.
Tick, Tick&hellip; Boom! wholeheartedly captures the misery, frustration, and doubt that struggling creatives face, yet they are powerless to resist the siren song of the arts. Andrew Garfield often brings an earnest passion to his roles, and this, along with his striking musical talent, makes him the perfect person to play Larson. Larson tragically passed away at the age of 35, before he saw Rent become a success, but his legacy lives on, and Lin-Manuel Miranda is the perfect person to tell his story.

Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom (2020)</p>
<p>Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom</p>
<p>Release Date    December 18, 2020     Director    George C. Wolfe     Cast    Glynn Turman , Chadwick Boseman , Colman Domingo , Viola Davis , Michael Potts     Runtime    93 minutes     Genres    Music , Drama</p>
<p>The movie that many agree should have won the late Chadwick Boseman a posthumous Oscar, Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom is based on the August Wilson play of the same name and centers on possibly the most dramatic, eventful recording session ever seen on-screen. It takes place on a sweltering summer day in 1920s Chicago in which famous blues singer Ma Rainey (Viola Davis) and her band assemble at Paramount&rsquo;s Recording Studios to record an album, and tension rises faster than the blistering temperature.
One of the greatest, most important playwrights in American history, Wilson&rsquo;s works give an articulate, profound voice to the Black American experience, and Ma Rainey&rsquo;s Black Bottom is a shining example of this. While Boseman&rsquo;s life was tragically cut short, his performance as the charismatic yet hot-headed trumpeter Levee Green deserves to be just as iconic as superhero Black Panther.

Jurassic Park (1993)</p>
<p>Jurassic Park</p>
<p>Release Date    June 11, 1993     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Richard Attenborough , Sam Neill , Laura Dern , Samuel L. Jackson , Jeff Goldblum     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    127 minutes</p>
<p>Among the best movies on Netflix right now is the 1993 Steven Spielberg classic Jurassic Park, which arrived on the platform in January. Jurassic Park spawned multiple sequels, but the original reigns supreme as the best in the franchise to this day. Starring Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and an endlessly memed performance by Jeff Goldblum, Jurassic Park won multiple accolades, including best sound, sound effects editing, and visual effects at the 66th Academy Awards. However, it&rsquo;s the premise of the movie that captured so many hearts and minds.
Jurassic Park answers the simple question of what life would be like if dinosaurs roamed the earth once again. Thanks to some (admittedly questionable) cloning science on the island of Isla Nubar, billionaire John Hammond has brought dozens of the prehistoric reptiles to life with the goal of opening a theme park. As expected, however, mighty beasts like Velociraptors and the fearsome T-Rex have no interest in remaining captive.
Dune (2021)</p>
<p>Dune<br>
5
/ 10</p>
<p>Release Date    October 22, 2021     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Dave Bautista , Rebecca Ferguson , Sharon Duncan-Brewster , Jason Momoa , David Dastmalchian , Stephen McKinley Henderson , Stellan Skarsgård , Charlotte Rampling , Chang Chen , Oscar Isaac , Zendaya , Javier Bardem , Timothee Chalamet , Josh Brolin     Runtime    155 minutes</p>
<p>It took 56 years, multiple failed attempts, and a budget of around $165 million, but Dune finally got the adaptation it deserved in 2021. Well, half of one at least. There&rsquo;s no getting away from the fact that Dune is, at the time of writing, incomplete. Dune&rsquo;s ending confirms it&rsquo;s absolutely a true two-parter, but that does not detract at all from the incredible work from director Denis Villeneuve et al on display here. Dune is a monumental Sci-Fi movie; the kind of film that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t make like this anymore,&rdquo; except Villeneuve clearly does.
Dune is a masterclass of world-building; not since Peter Jackson&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings has a movie begun what feels like such an epic cinematic journey that perfectly combines storytelling and filmmaking. Dune&rsquo;s cast is great, the movie looks and sounds incredible, but it wouldn&rsquo;t mean as much if audiences couldn&rsquo;t invest in the characters, or get their heads around its grander themes and high concepts - the movie ensures that&rsquo;s not a problem, or even close to it. Dune is a thrilling step into a bigger world, one that leaves you desperate for more, yet completely satisfied with what you&rsquo;ve just experienced.

They Cloned Tyrone (2023)</p>
<p>They Cloned Tyrone<br>
8
/ 10</p>
<p>Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Juel Taylor     Cast    John Boyega , Teyonah Parris , Jamie Foxx , Kiefer Sutherland , David Alan Grier , J. Alphonse Nicholson     Runtime    119 Minutes</p>
<p>Marrying high-concept science-fiction with fantasy, satire and all manner of other genres, The Cloned Tyrone is one of the best Netflix Original movies released in 2023. Set in a drab retro-futuristic world, it stars John Boyega as the titular drug dealer, who drags himself through the same cycle of everyday life, in a grim Groundhog Day-style mundane nightmare that not even being shot repeatedly seems to interrupt.
Delightfully twisty, and featuring a walking homage to Blaxpoitation movies in Jamie Foxx&rsquo;s pimp Slick Charles, They Cloned Tyrone is fast-paced, occasionally bizarre and a great way to spend a couple of hours. Come for the sci-fi, but stay for the Mary J Blige elevator scene.

Mamma Mia! (2008)</p>
<p>Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again</p>
<p>Release Date    July 20, 2018     Director    Ol Parker     Cast    Meryl Streep , Andy Garcia , Pierce Brosnan , Christine Baranski , Dominic Cooper , Amanda Seyfried , Julie Walters , Colin Firth , Stellan Skarsgård , Lily James , Cher     Runtime    114minutes</p>
<p>A star-studded cast and an incredible soundtrack of Abba songs take Mamma Mia from the realms of good rom-com to global smash hit. Starring Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgård, and Amanda Seyfried, this summery romance is set on a Greek island, where Sophie (Seyfried) is getting married&hellip; and inviting three different men who could all be her biological father! The movie tells the story of her mother&rsquo;s own romance in Greece (all three of them), as well as Sophie&rsquo;s romance with her fiance, as they break into song and dance in the sunshine with her mother&rsquo;s friends.
Mamma Mia is based on the stage musical of the same name, and has since sparked a sequel, as well as winning a slew of awards. Both Mamma Mia! and the sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, are available on Netflix.
To All The Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before (2018)</p>
<p>To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before</p>
<p>Release Date    August 17, 2018     Director    Susan Johnson     Cast    Lana Condor , Anna Cathcart , John Corbett , Janel Parrish , Israel Broussard , Noah Centineo     Runtime    102 minutes     Genres    Romance , Comedy</p>
<p>In the age of streaming, romantic comedies are being given fewer and fewer theatrical runs, with many going straight to online platforms. While this is unfortunate for cinema-going fans of the genre, Netflix is a rom-com lover&rsquo;s paradise, as it boasts many original titles from Always Be My Maybe to The Kissing Booth, and To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before is one of the best. It sees the romantic yet shy teenage protagonist Lara Jean (Lana Condor) have her worst nightmare come true when the private love letters she wrote to her crushes go public.
Like many great teen movies, To All the Boys I&rsquo;ve Loved Before is based on the book trilogy by Jenny Han, and the two follow-up novels also have Netflix adaptations. Genre stories that have a predominantly female audience, namely rom-com and young adult, are often dismissed, but it&rsquo;s impossible to ignore what a winning movie series To All the Boys is. Even though the film trilogy has wrapped, the franchise has launched a spin-off show called XO Kitty about Lara Jean&rsquo;s younger sister Kitty (Anna Cathcart), proving the enduring popularity of To All the Boys.

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah (2023)</p>
<p>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</p>
<p>Release Date    August 25, 2023     Director    Sammi Cohen     Cast    Sunny Sandler , Samantha Lorraine , Idina Menzel , Jackie Sandler , Adam Sandler , Sadie Sandler , Dylan Hoffman , Sarah Sherman , Dan Bulla , Ido Mosseri , Jackie Hoffman , Luis Guzmán     Runtime    103 Minutes</p>
<p>Adam Sandler tends to make the most at the box office when he&rsquo;s surrounded by those closest to him in real life (whether the critical reception of those movies matches or not). In Netflix Original You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah he goes one step further, starring alongside his wife and daughters, with Sunny Sandler taking center stage. In fact, this is not his movie at all, though he is good in it.</p>
<p>Every Adam Sandler Movie Ranked Worst To Best
The comedian turned filmmaker Adam Sandler is polarizing yet popular, so how does his abundant filmography stack up against one another?</p>
<p>Culturally informed and sensitive, You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah is a smart portrait of a landmark celebration, finding comedy and charm in its authenticity, but also in the universality of teenage life. Crucially, it understands and never talks down to the condition of adolescence, and the younger Sandler is the pick of You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah&rsquo;s cast — a fledgling star who clearly learned a lot from the better comedies of her co-star father.

The Mitchells Vs. The Machines (2021)</p>
<p>The Mitchells vs. the Machines</p>
<p>Release Date    April 30, 2021     Director    Mike Rianda     Cast    Eric Andre , Maya Rudolph , Abbi Jacobson , Beck Bennett , Mike Rianda , Fred Armisen , Conan O&rsquo;Brien , Olivia Colman , Danny McBride , Sasheer Zamata , Charlyne Yi     Runtime    117 minutes</p>
<p>Netflix subscribers looking for a family-friendly animated movie should look no further than The Mitchells vs. The Machines. The comedy stars Abbi Jacobson, Danny McBride, and Maya Rudolph as members of a dysfunctional family whose cross-country road trip becomes tangled up in a plot by an evil AI to take over the world. Particularly pertinent storytelling in 2023. Blending both 3D and traditional animation, The Mitchells vs. The Machines is one of the most visually impressive animations on the platform (and indeed of recent years, generally) and it deservedly picked up an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature.
Full of heart, funny and featuring a wonderfully unhinged villain turn from Olivia Colman, The Mitchells vs. The Machines offers something for everyone. It can surely only be a matter of time before Netflix cements plans for The Mitchells vs. The Machines 2. It can&rsquo;t come soon enough.

Paddington (2014)</p>
<p>Paddington</p>
<p>Release Date    January 16, 2015     Director    Paul King     Cast    Hugh Bonneville , Ben Whishaw , Nicole Kidman , Sally Hawkins     Runtime    95minutes</p>
<p>Given Hollywood&rsquo;s fascination with eking as much money out of nostalgic properties as possible, it was only a matter of time before someone turned their attention to the famous marmalade sandwich-loving bear from Darkest Peru. Luckily, that someone was Paul King, who made Paddington, an achingly British delight that has as much heart as it does slapstick comedy. Essentially a found family comedy, the beloved movie is the perfect answer for anyone looking for a unifying family watch.
Based on the original book series by Michael Bond, Paddington sees the wholesome bear, voiced by Ben Whishaw, invited (somewhat reluctantly by certain parties) to live with a family in Notting Hill. The very definition of a gentle, cozy comedy, Paddington carries a deeper meaning of acceptance and love, and boasts easily one of the highest rewatchability scores of all of Netflix&rsquo;s best movies.

<p>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</p>
<p>Release Date    December 21, 2022     Director    Joel Crawford     Cast    Antonio Banderas , Salma Hayek Pinault , Olivia Colman , Harvey Guillen , Samson Kayo , Wagner Moura , Anthony Mendez , John Mulaney , Florence Pugh     Runtime    102 minutes</p>
<p>It would be perilously easy to dismiss a Shrek movie spin-off from 2022 as a bit of a cash grab, but to do so would be a fatal error when it comes to Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Directed by Joel Crawford and ingeniusly dropping the traditional Shrek animation style for something more dynamic and beautiful, The Last Wish is not only the best Shrek franchise movie, but also one of the best animated movies of all time.
It may have taken a decade to get to cinemas after the first Puss spin-off, but Puss In Boots: The Last Wish proves the age-old adage that good things come to those who wait. It&rsquo;s funny, family-friendly, and packs in Paddington levels of heart, along with a surprisingly deep message about mortality. Once more starring Antonio Banderas as the perfectly-cast feline mercenary, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is the perfect propaganda for the future of the Shrek movie franchise.
