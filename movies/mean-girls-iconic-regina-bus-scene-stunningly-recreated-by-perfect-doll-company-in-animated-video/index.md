## Literature Review

Mean Girls&#39; iconic Regina George bus scene has been stunningly recreated by the perfect toy company in a clever animated video shared to social media.




One of the most iconic scenes from Mean Girls is stunningly recreated through animation with some iconic dolls. The movie follows teenager Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan), who enrolls at North Shore High and becomes entangled with a popular clique known as the &#34;Plastics,&#34; led by Regina George (Rachel McAdams). Along with Lohan and McAdams, the cast of Mean Girls includes Lizzy Caplan, Tim Meadows, Tina Fey, Lacey Chabert, and Amanda Seyfried. Released in 2004, it has become famous for its many quotable lines and sequences, including a moment where Regina is abruptly hit by a school bus.




In a recent TikTok, the official Bratz page recreated that infamous scene from Mean Girls. Check it out below:


 

Using the viral sound, the footage animates Regina and Cady&#39;s interaction in the middle of the street, down to duplicating their outfits, thus making the entire sequence strikingly accurate and giving fans an idea of what Mean Girls would look like as Bratz.


 Why Bratz Is The Perfect Brand To Recreate Mean Girls 
          

With the latest adaptation of Mean Girls, based on the Broadway musical, premiering in theaters, several moments from the original movie have been trending. In particular, the bus scene and Regina&#39;s dialogue leading up to it became a popular sound on TikTok, as many users found creative ways to employ it; some even recorded their own version. When it comes to Bratz, the company has referenced other films and television shows before, especially on social media. Some of the most-watched videos on their TikTok include recreations of Euphoria and Bodies Bodies Bodies scenes.






Bratz animated other sequences from Mean Girls, including the &#34;Jingle Bell Rock&#34; performance, and used a sound of Cady discussing Halloween as well.




Developed by Carter Bryant and MGA Entertainment, Bratz dolls have been around for over two decades, rivaling Barbie for popularity. Known for wearing makeup and unique clothing, along with the slogan &#34;passion for fashion,&#34; Bratz would likely be top of mind when contemplating which doll brand represents Mean Girls and the &#34;Plastics.&#34; Because of their ability to accurately depict that scene from the 2004 movie, there could be some wishing for more crossover content.

It&#39;s interesting to see how Mean Girls&#39; fame has grown over the years, and how certain scenes have become iconic. Even those unfamiliar with the movie will likely know the Regina George bus scene, and can enjoy watching Bratz recreate it. Between this and the new Mean Girls musical, it is clear the teen comedy will remain entrenched in pop culture for a very long time.
