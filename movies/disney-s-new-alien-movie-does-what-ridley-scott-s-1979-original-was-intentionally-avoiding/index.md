Alien: Romulus is the upcoming new Alien movie from Disney, and while there is plenty of excitement, there&#39;s also some trepidation, as the House of Mouse&#39;s take on the Xenomorphs is set to explore an aspect of the franchise that Ridley Scott&#39;s original 1979 film actively avoided. Alien: Romulus, from Don&#39;t Breathe director Fede Álvarez, has reportedly wrapped filming ahead of its 2024 premiere, pushing Disney&#39;s 20th Century Studios to share more information about the movie&#39;s story. However, the press release gives franchise fans a reason to be concerned: it doesn&#39;t seem like the Disney entry is interested in echoing Scott&#39;s classic movie.




Aside from James Cameron&#39;s 1986 sequel Aliens, the franchise has seen more than its fair share of box office bombs and critical disappointments. From action-packed crossovers with the Predator series to more esoteric prequels centering on an android, a number of movies in the Alien franchise have notoriously missed the mark. Audiences haven&#39;t been treated to another Xenomorph encounter on the big screen since the release of the much-maligned Alien: Covenant in 2017, and they might not miss the franchise. But if Prey, the latest installment of Alien&#39;s sister series Predator, is any indication, taking a well-worn franchise in a completely new direction can be both divisive and incredibly successful.

                  Alien: Romulus - Release Date, Story, Cast &amp; Everything We Know   With Fede Álvarez at the helm of the new Alien movie the franchise is heading in a promising direction, but what is Alien: Romulus about?   


 Alien: Romulus Will Have Young Main Characters 
The New Disney Alien Movie Is Moving Away From The Ripley Blueprint
         




 A press release from Disney&#39;s 20th Century Studios shed more light on the plot of the highly anticipated Alien: Romulus. The film is said to follow &#34;a group of young people on a distant world, who find themselves in a confrontation with the most terrifying life form in the universe.&#34; While this focus on young adult characters doesn&#39;t come as a huge surprise given the film&#39;s casting announcements, it&#39;s a stark departure from the original movie. Ridley Scott&#39;s film essentially focuses on truckers in space — ordinary working-class people, like Sigourney Weaver&#39;s Ellen Ripley, who are confronted with extreme circumstances.

So, while grafting a &#34;teens being stalked&#34; premise onto a space setting sounds entertaining, it also betrays some of the core traits that make the original 1979 film an enduring classic. The apparent slasher-in-space that is Alien: Romulus will feature the subgenre&#39;s most essential trope: a group of teens getting picked off one by one. Although Ripley is a kind of horror movie final girl in Alien, the original is an inventive film that borrows from the horror genre without being solely defined by it.




                  Alien: Romulus Will Be The Perfect Next Step For Two Breakout 2023 Stars (&amp; It Honors The Original)   Alien: Romulus is the perfect next career move for two of 2023&#39;s biggest breakout stars – and their casting honors the original Alien movie.   



 Disney&#39;s Young Alien Cast Could Actually Be A Good Direction For The Franchise 
Putting Young Characters Against The Xenomorphs Isn&#39;t Necessarily A Bad Idea
          

A different direction doesn&#39;t necessarily spell trouble for Disney&#39;s new Alien film. In fact, mapping the teen slasher formula onto the series — alongside a familiar, death-dealing monster — can actually reinvigorate the franchise. As it stands, the Alien prequels, which prize philosophical questions above all else, also fail to recapture the original film&#39;s magic. In leveraging the strengths of the action-forward slasher genre and its relatable young cast, Alien: Romulus has a chance to break from all other franchise installments, allowing director Fede Álvarez to craft a film that speaks to modern viewers in the same way Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien spoke to moviegoers in the late &#39;70s.




              Alien: Romulus  Alien: Romulus is the seventh film in the Alien franchise. The movie is directed by Fede Álvarez and will focus on a new young group of characters who come face to face with the terrifying Xenomorphs. Alien: Romulus is a stand-alone film and takes place in a time not yet explored in the Alien franchise.    Release Date    August 16, 2024     Director    Fede Alvarez     Cast    Cailee Spaeny , David Jonsson , Archie Renaux , Isabela Merced , Aileen Wu , Spike Fearn     Writers    Fede Alvarez , Rodo Sayagues     Studio(s)    Scott Free Productions , 20th Century     Distributor(s)    20th Century     Franchise(s)    Alien
