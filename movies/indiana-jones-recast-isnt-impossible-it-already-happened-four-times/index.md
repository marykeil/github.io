## Literature Review

After the Dial of Destiny, many are wondering whatâ€™s next for the Indiana Jones, and though a recast seems impossible, it has already been done.




In 2023, the new Indiana Jones movie, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, had a less-than-stellar performance at the box office, leading many to wonder what is next for the iconic action adventure franchise, and while the concept of recasting the character has often been passed over, the fact is that Indiana Jones has been successfully recast before. Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth installment in the Indiana Jones movies, which began decades ago in 1981. The film series stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist and explorer that saves the world&#39;s treasures from dangerous people.




While the Indiana Jones franchise hasn&#39;t necessarily been &#34;going strong&#34; in recent years, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny bombed compared to past installments. The film followed Indy in his old age in the 1960s, and the way in which he is pulled back into the adventuring business by his goddaughter Helena, played by Phoebe Waller-Bridge. The film had a budget of $295 to $300 million, and it only made $384 million in the box office, making it something of a flop. In this way, the Indiana Jones franchise desperately needs a change, and reframing the cast actually is a very good option.


 Four Other Actors Have Already Played Indiana Jones Besides Harrison Ford 
         

Although many are hesitant to recast the role of Indiana Jones, the truth is that it has already been done before and been successful. In total, Indiana Jones has been played by five actors, which means four other people have portrayed the daring explorer aside from the iconic Harrison Ford. These actors include River Phoenix, Sean Patrick Flanery, Corey Carrier, and George Hall. While Flanery, Carrier, and Hall all played Indy in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, River Phoenix was canonically Indiana Jones in the main movie franchise. In this way, Harrison Ford may be the most recognizable Indiana Jones, but he is not the sole actor.






The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles lasted for one season from 1992 to 1993.




This fact alone completely eradicates fears about recasting Indiana Jones. There may be concerns that another actor cannot compete with what Harrison Ford has done, but the simple answer is that it is OK for a new Indiana Jones actor to be different from Harrison Ford. River Phoenix and the others were not competing with Harrison Ford; they all just existed in the same universe. Furthermore, the fact that each actor portrays Indy at a different age is another good sign. A recast could jump in at any point in Indy&#39;s timeline, and as long as they maintain his essence, be successful.



 Indiana Jones&#39; Previous Young Recastings Have Worked 
          




What is really beneficial about all the actors who have played Indiana Jones is that they have all been successful in their portrayals. Although The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles was only on air for a single season, it received plenty of praise. The series was nominated for Best TV Series- Drama at the 1994 Golden Globes and Corey Carrier was nominated for the Young Artist Award in the category of &#34;Best Young Actor Starring in a Television Series&#34; at the 1993 Emmy&#39;s. In this way, these actors&#39; portrayals were not harshly judged for not being Harrison Ford, but instead, were praised for their accuracy and fresh takes.

Even in the main franchise itself, River Phoenix&#39;s performance as Indiana Jones was successful. Harrison Ford recommended Phoenix himself, citing how similar he looked to Ford when he was young. Ultimately, Phoenix impressed audiences with his ability to capture the soul of Indiana Jones by replicating much of what Harrison Ford did. If anything, this is proof that a new Indiana Jones actor could certainly take inspiration from Harrison Ford&#39;s performances, and in that way, be an Indiana Jones that audiences find familiar and enjoyable to watch. Though it is impossible to be Harrison Ford, a new actor could certainly come close.

Ultimately, this means that it&#39;s time to recast Indiana Jones. After Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, it is clear that the franchise needs a change, and letting Harrison Ford retire is definitely a good way to do that. Although Ford has been a staple of the franchise, he cannot play Indy forever, and if audiences want more Indiana Jones, then this is one of the few ways forward. Though it is risky to find a new actor to portray such an iconic character, it is not an impossible task, and if all goes well, this could be exactly what Indiana Jones needs to stay alive in the 2020s.
