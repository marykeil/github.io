# Wild Se7en Theory Claims John Doe Wasn t The Movie s Real Killer


## SUMMARY 



  A theory suggests that Detective Somerset was the real &#34;seven deadly sins murderer&#34; and John Doe was just a pawn.   Some evidence supporting the theory includes Somerset&#39;s knowledge of Mills&#39; skills and his odd reaction to the &#34;gluttony&#34; crime scene.   If Somerset was the killer, it would change the movie, making Mills&#39; story even more tragic and raising questions about what really happened to Tracy.

## Literature Review

 Although Se7en leaves no doubt that John Doe was the killer, a theory claims he was a cover and the real killer was part of the police department.




David Fincher’s Se7en featured one of the cruelest and most disturbing serial killers in film history, but a theory completely changes the movie by claiming John Doe (Kevin Spacey) wasn’t the real killer. In 1995, David Fincher brought the crime thriller Se7en, starring Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, and Gwyneth Paltrow. Although it got mixed reactions from critics during its initial release, Se7en was a box office hit and it’s now regarded as one of the best thriller and crime movies ever made, as well as one of the best movies of the 1990s.




Set in an unnamed city plagued by crime, Se7en follows detectives Willam Somerset (Freeman) and David Mills (Pitt) as they team up to solve a series of crimes based on the seven deadly sins, committed by a mysterious killer who goes to lengths to not leave any trails. The ending of Se7en is well-known for its darkness and implied violence, as John Doe had one final shocking reveal reserved for his last two murders. When John Doe is first mentioned, Se7en makes it clear that he’s the man Somerset and Mills have been looking for, but one theory changes everything by suggesting John Doe wasn’t the real killer, and he was just a cover for the real mastermind.


 Se7en Theory Claims Detective Somerset Was The Real Killer 
John Doe was just a cover for Somerset’s murders.
         

A theory shared on Reddit gives a twist to Se7en by suggesting Somerset was the real “seven deadly sins murderer”, and John Doe was just a pawn in his plans. Somerset met Mills when he was at a crime scene and the young detective arrived to introduce himself. Somerset wasn’t thrilled to have a new partner, especially as he was about to retire. Somerset tried to be reassigned to another case so he wouldn’t have to work with Mills, despite the latter being an experienced detective. According to the theory, Somerset’s insistence was because, despite what he said, he was well aware of Mills’ experience and knew he could discover his plans.




Another piece of “evidence” that the author of the theory mentions is connected to the “sloth” murder. The victim was a drug-dealing pederast who had been restrained to a bed for a whole year and was found emaciated and surrounded by hundreds of air fresheners. The author claims there’s a scene where air fresheners can be seen on Somerset’s desk, but this piece of “evidence” for the theory has been questioned.

A more believable moment that can support the theory can be found when Somerset and Mills arrive at the “gluttony” crime scene, where Mills asks if the victim’s pulse was taken. Somerset questions Mills for asking that, and later, the “sloth” victim startled everyone when he turned out to be alive. Somerset reacted the way he did when Mills asked about taking the pulse of the victim because he knew one of the future victims would still be alive.

If Somerset was the real killer in Se7en, it means that John Doe was just a cover, and he was a deeply disturbed man who was also easy to manipulate, as he took credit for all the murders and never hinted at anyone else being involved. The most disturbing part of the theory claims that the infamous box at the end of Se7en was actually empty, and Somerset faked finding something deeply disturbing in it while John Doe planted the idea in Mills’ head that the box contained his wife’s head.






 Why Somerset Committed The Seven Deadly Sins Murders 
Somerset was about to retire.
          

The biggest question that this Se7en theory raises is why Somerset would commit the seven deadly sins. It’s quickly mentioned in Se7en that Somerset is about to retire and only has one week left, which he then extends when he becomes involved in the case with Mills. Somerset initially didn’t want to take the case because he didn’t want it to be his final case, and that’s exactly why he could have been the mastermind behind the seven deadly sins murders. Somerset probably wanted to retire with a huge case that pushed everyone to their limits and made headlines, and something like the seven deadly sins, through which he targeted some big people like lawyer Eli Gould, would have definitely been talked about everywhere.

As interesting and shocking as it would be if Somerset was the real killer in Se7en, there’s more playing against it than supporting it. If Somerset was the killer, he wouldn’t have spent a whole night reading books related to the seven deadly sins, nor would he have asked his FBI contact for help. Supposing the theory was true, it would completely change Se7en as it would make Mills’ story even more tragic. Not only would it mean that Mills was used by Somerset from day one, but the man he trusted would have ended up pushing him to kill a man believing he had killed his wife – and, of course, there’s also the question of what truly happened to Tracy, as Somerset could have just lied about her death to push Mills to kill John Doe, which would have huge consequences for Mills if Tracy was alive.
