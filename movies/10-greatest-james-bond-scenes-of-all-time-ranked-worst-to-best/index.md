## Literature Review

It is tough to pick James Bond&#39;s overall best moments when every actor&#39;s version of the super spy has at least one iconic scene to his name.




Although the James Bond movies are full of unforgettable moments, it is still possible to nail down a select number of the most iconic scenes from the franchise. Since 007 first graced cinema screens back in 1962 with Dr. No, the suave super spy has consistently gifted viewers with some of the action genre’s greatest bits. Whether the more cartoonish antics of Roger Moore’s James Bond or the stone-faced stoicism of Craig’s later take on the character, every screen incarnation of 007 can be relied on to pull off staggering stunts, ferocious fights, and awe-inspiring chases.
While the upcoming Bond 26 will endeavor to outdo its predecessors, this will be a tall order for the reboot. From Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan, every version of James Bond has impressed fans with at least a few astounding scenes. Some of these are expensive, lavish action sequences that require months of preparation, while others are more intimate confrontations between Bond and his enemies. However, all of them are a testament to the unique appeal of James Bond as a character, blending 007’s campier side with the grit and gravitas that make his adventures so inimitable.









 








 10  Bond’s Dam Jump In GoldenEye (1995) 
Pierce Brosnan’s debut as James Bond opens with an attention-grabbing stunt.
        

  GoldenEye  


  Release Date    November 16, 1995     Director    Martin Campbell     Cast    Pierce Brosnan , Sean Bean , Izabella Scorupco , Famke Janssen , Joe Don Baker , judi dench     Runtime    130 minutes    


GoldenEye introduced viewers to Pierce Brosnan’s version of James Bond. The outing represented a major tonal shift for the franchise away from the darkness of Timothy Dalton’s movies and toward a more self-aware, comedic 007. Luckily, GoldenEye’s incredible opening scene, which sees James Bond bungee jump off the 720-foot-high Contra Dam, proved that the series wasn’t about to sacrifice jaw-dropping spectacle for jokes. A breathtaking moment that sets up the tense set-piece that follows, this remains a high point of Brosnan’s Bond era.


GoldenEye is available to stream on Prime Video. 






 9  The Icy Car Chase In The Living Daylights (1987) 
Timothy Dalton’s best moment as James Bond is vintage 007 heroics.
        

 The Living Daylights 


  Release Date    July 31, 1987     Director    John Glen     Cast    Timothy Dalton , Maryam d&#39;Abo , Joe Don Baker , John Rhys-Davies     Runtime    130 minutes    


Timothy Dalton’s time as James Bond was marked by a distinctly downbeat, grounded atmosphere. Bond always had darker elements, but Dalton’s movies pumped these up to 11 so that the series could compete with the action movies of the &#39;80s. Despite this, The Living Daylights did include a typically superb, far-fetched action sequence when Dalton’s 007 veered onto an icy lake during a car chase. This wildly ambitious scene is further elevated by Dalton’s hilarious one-liners and Bond’s eventual decision to convert a cello into a sled out of necessity.


The Living Daylights is available to stream on Prime Video. 






 8  The Volcano Finale In You Only Live Twice (1967) 
One of Sean Connery’s best outings as James Bond features an unforgettable villain&#39;s lair.
        

 you only live twice 


  Release Date    June 13, 1967     Director    Lewis Gilbert     Cast    Sean Connery , Donald Pleasence , Bernard Lee , Akiko Wakabayashi , Mie Hama     Runtime    117 minutes    


While the earliest James Bond movies stuck pretty close to their source material, You Only Live Twice benefited from a major rewrite by Roald Dahl. The legendary children’s author added a lot more outlandish details to the novel’s comparatively grounded story, including the endlessly influential volcano lair of the movie’s villain, Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Donald Pleasence). Parodied in everything from The Simpsons to the Austin Powers franchise, this lair plays host to the movie’s brilliant finale. You Only Live Twice’s adaptation scarcely resembles its source material, but pitting Bond against a stream of ninja henchmen in a hollowed-out volcano remains a stroke of genius.


You Only Live Twice is available to stream on Prime Video and MGM&#43;. 






 7  Defending Skyfall Lodge In Skyfall (2012) 
Daniel Craig’s third James Bond movie includes a wild finale.


 







  Skyfall  


  Release Date    November 9, 2012     Director    Sam Mendes     Cast    judi dench , Ralph Fiennes , Naomie Harris , Helen McCrory , Javier Bardem , Daniel Craig , Ben Whishaw     Runtime    2h 23m    


Daniel Craig’s debut as James Bond in Casino Royale proved that 007 could still impress viewers after the Bourne movies made his antics feel outdated and irrelevant. However, his next outing, Quantum of Solace, took things too far, resulting in a grim, muddled thriller that lacked cohesion and fun. Fortunately, Skyfall more than made up for this. The movie&#39;s finale, wherein Bond and M (Judi Dench) defend his titular childhood home from Silva (Javier Bardem), featured brutal action beats, a truly shocking tragedy, and a rare insight into the mysterious character’s youth. This helped elevate Daniel Craig’s James Bond movies above many of his predecessors.


Skyfall is available to stream on Max. 






 6  Ski Chase In The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) 
Roger Moore’s strongest James Bond movie features one impressive action sequence.
        

 The Spy Who Loved Me 


  Release Date    August 3, 1977     Director    Lewis Gilbert     Cast    Roger Moore , Barbara Bach , Richard Kiel     Runtime    125 minutes    


Roger Moore’s time as James Bond is divisive, but even viewers who laugh at the likes of Moonraker and A View to a Kill would be hard-pressed to deny the appeal of The Spy Who Loved Me. An in-name-only adaptation of the novel of the same name, The Spy Who Loved Me began with a goofy but undeniably impressive and striking downhill ski chase. As Moore’s 007 dispatches a series of henchmen while navigating the slopes, all mere moments after kissing his latest duplicitous love interest goodbye, The Spy Who Loved Me proves that the franchise’s campiest elements remain iconic.


The Spy Who Loved Me is available to stream on Max. 






 5  Tracy Bond’s Death In On Her Majesty’s Secret Service (1969) 
George Lazenby’s lone outing as James Bond features one of the franchise’s biggest tragedies.
        

 On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service 


  Release Date    December 19, 1969     Director    Peter R. Hunt     Cast    George Lazenby , Diana Rigg , Telly Savalas , Bernard Lee , Ilse Steppat     Runtime    142 minutes    


George Lazenby only appeared in one James Bond movie, and the actor had the hard job of replacing Sean Connery, the original 007 who, according to many viewers, is still the greatest to ever play the role. However, Connery’s Bond wouldn’t have worked in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, as evidenced by the movie’s strongest scene. When 007 married his love interest, Tracy (Diana Rigg), only for her to be murdered by Blofeld (Telly Savalas), the unstoppable spy experienced his most crushing defeat in the franchise’s history. Poignant and brutal, this scene marked a turning point for Bond’s unflappable screen persona.


On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service is available to stream on Max. 






 4  James Bond’s Death In No Time To Die (2021) 
Daniel Craig’s final movie as 007 pulled off a seemingly impossible feat.


 







  No Time to Die  


  Release Date    October 8, 2021     Director    Cary Fukunaga     Cast    Daniel Craig , Rami Malek , Lea Seydoux , Ralph Fiennes , Lashana Lynch , Jeffrey Wright , Billy Magnussen , Dali Benssalah , Naomie Harris , Rory Kinnear , Ben Whishaw , Ana De Armas , David Dencik     Runtime    163 Minutes    


While On Her Majesty’s Secret Service proved that James Bond wasn’t completely implacable, it would be a very long time before the series tackled his mortality. However, in 2021, the long-awaited No Time to Die did just that by doing the seemingly impossible and killing off Daniel Craig’s version of James Bond. In an ending that was as triumphant and touching as it was crushing, Craig’s 007 welcomed his death after defeating Safin (Rami Malek) and foiling his plan to unleash a lethal virus. Even years later, this scene still surprises.


No Time to Die is available to stream on Prime Video and MGM&#43;. 






 3  The Parkour Chase In Casino Royale (2006) 
Daniel Craig’s debut as James Bond has a bruising action highlight.
        

  Casino Royale  


  Release Date    November 14, 2006     Director    Martin Campbell     Cast    Daniel Craig , Eva Green , Mads Mikkelsen , judi dench , Jeffrey Wright , Giancarlo Giannini     Runtime    144 minutes    


Daniel Craig’s James Bond franchise debut is filled with scenes that could be included here, from Vesper Lynd’s death to Le Chiffre’s bruising interrogation of a smirking, nude Bond. However, it is the early Parkour chase scene that merits such a high ranking. While Craig’s version of Bond did bring new humanity to the character, this showcase of his skills was more reliant on raw athleticism. A pulse-pounding extravaganza that went on for almost `0 minutes, this astounding sequence brought the French athletic discipline of parkour to mainstream attention for the first time. In the process, the scene blew away even veteran action movie viewers.


Casino Royale is available to stream on Prime Video. 






 2  Goldfinger Interrogates James Bond In Goldfinger (1964) 
This iconic scene remains James Bond’s most memorable villain encounter.


 







 Goldfinger 


  Release Date    September 20, 1964     Director    Guy Hamilton     Cast    Sean Connery , Honor Blackman , Gert Fröbe , Shirley Eaton , Tania Mallet , Harold Sakata     Runtime    112 minutes    


While Blofeld is James Bond’s most famous enemy, Goldfinger provides the character with some of his most memorable interactions with a hammy antagonist. The attempt by Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe) to kill Sean Connery’s Bond with a laser aimed between his legs combined many of the elements that make the franchise’s villains great. There is the unnecessary complexity of the trap, the grandstanding arrogance of quotes like “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!” and, of course, the hilarious fury when this needlessly convoluted death trap fails. Altogether, this makes for an unforgettable confrontation.


Goldfinger is available to stream on Max by way of Prime Video or Paramount&#43; by way of Apple TV&#43;. 






 1  “Bond, James Bond” In Dr. No (1962) 
James Bond’s first movie includes his most iconic line.
        

  Dr. No  


  Release Date    October 2, 1962     Cast    Sean Connery , Joseph Wiseman     Genres    Action , Adventure     Director    Terence Young     Runtime    110 minutes    


Since Sean Connery’s James Bond influenced every 007 that came after him, it only makes sense that his screen debut earned the top spot. As simple as it might be, the first time that Bond utters the iconic catchphrase “Bond, James Bond” in Dr. No remains a high point for the series. There is a reason that this scene has been copied, parodied, reinvented, deconstructed, and paid homage to throughout countless action movies over the last six decades. As simple as it seems, Connery’s roguish delivery of the line in the first James Bond movie turned a popular literary character into a cornerstone of modern pop culture.


Dr. No is available to stream via DirecTV.
