# New Karate Kid Movie s Cobra Kai Update Is Disappointing (But It Can Still Work)


## SUMMARY

## Literature Review

News around the new Karate Kid movie could be potentially alarming for Cobra Kai fans. However, despite the update, it actually may not be an issue.




While a new update on the upcoming The Karate Kid movie may disappoint Cobra Kai fans, the development isn&#39;t actually as disastrous as it may seem. Clearly, both the Karate Kid and Cobra Kai franchises are deeply connected. After the lukewarm reception to the 2010 Jaden Smith reboot, Cobra Kai has expertly used legacy Karate Kid characters to craft a future for the story on the small screen. Seeing the likes of Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence not just return but thrive has helped the show gain a cult following and popular acclaim, once again strengthening calls for a cinematic Karate Kid return.




Throughout its run, Cobra Kai has drawn heavily on the legacy of the original films to make the series something much more impactful than simple fan service. Picking up old character arcs, grudges, and plot points, the show has continually used the films as a springboard for its own action, highlighting the showrunner&#39;s deep affection for the source material in the process. While it&#39;s true that Cobra Kai has revitalized The Karate Kid, the show is also dependent on the franchise for its success. However, despite this connection, an update on the new movie suggests that this relationship is not as strong as it seems.

 Cobra Kai’s Creators Are Not Involved With The New Karate Kid Movie 
          




Despite his clear investment in the wider franchise, Cobra Kai co-creator Jon Hurwitz has confirmed that neither he, nor other members of the show&#39;s core creative team, are involved in the new Karate Kid movie. In a statement on X (formerly known as Twitter), Hurwitz wrote, &#34;We are not officially involved in the new Karate Kid movie in any way, but we are friends of the court who hope it kicks ass! Love that guy Ralph Macchio!&#34; This is an unequivocal confirmation that the two projects are very separate.

Considering both Cobra Kai&#39;s critical and commercial success, Hurwitz&#39;s update is a potentially disappointing development. After all, having successfully reintegrated a series of legacy characters, he and the rest of the team would seem like natural choices to continue the rehabilitation on the big screen. The fact that they have no involvement not only suggests that The Karate Kid will take a different approach, but that the lessons learned from Cobra Kai may be lost. While having Cobra Kai&#39;s creators involved would not guarantee success, it would certainly alleviate the concerns of fans who don&#39;t wish to see either the original films&#39; or the show&#39;s legacies tarnished.






The Karate Kid reboot is slated for release on December 13th, 2024






 Karate Kid’s 2024 Movie Might Struggle To Win Over Cobra Kai Audiences 
         

The lack of involvement from Hurwitz and co suggests a change of direction for The Karate Kid reboot movie that could be off-putting for Cobra Kai fans. After all, if the main creative forces behind the successful show are no longer involved, it suggests that many of the things viewers most loved about the series could end up being cast aside. This could have a major impact on everything from tone to story.

                  Karate Kid &amp; Cobra Kai Timeline Explained (Including Season 5)   The Karate Kid and Cobra Kai saga spans Mr. Miyagi&#39;s life and continues with the children of Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence in the 21st century.   




A prime example of how the tone could transform in a big-screen adaptation is The Karate Kid&#39;s attempted reboot. The Jaden Smith movie – while by no means a disaster, represents a radically different approach to the franchise formula than Cobra Kai, prioritizing new stories over legacy characters. While Ralph Macchio&#39;s Daniel LaRusso is confirmed to be returning for the film, Jackie Chan&#39;s Mr. Han is also set to appear, further cementing the link between the 2010 reboot and the new movie. Chan&#39;s involvement and a clear move away from the formula that made Cobra Kai so successful could be an unappealing prospect for both new fans and viewers who came back following the show.



 Why Karate Kid’s New Movie Can Still Work 
          

Although Hurwitz&#39;s Karate Kid update raises some red flags, there is still every chance the new movie can be a success. For one thing, the very fact that Cobra Kai successfully reinvigorated the franchise once proves that it&#39;s perfectly possible to re-imagine and rework the source material to suit a new story. Even though Cobra Kai relied initially on legacy characters, the show has now blossomed in its own right. There&#39;s no reason a movie reboot couldn&#39;t do the same.




A further consideration is that Cobra Kai&#39;s success has made the whole Karate Kid franchise so big that a continuation in some form was an inevitability. The fact that Macchio is still involved at least proves that future stories will share some of Cobra Kai&#39;s DNA, giving The Karate Kid film a potential recipe for success. There&#39;s no doubt that The Karate Kid movie will not be a feature-length episode of Cobra Kai. However, just because the two properties take different approaches to the same story doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t coexist or succeed.
