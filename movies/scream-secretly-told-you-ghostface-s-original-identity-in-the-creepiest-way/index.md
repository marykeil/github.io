## Literature Review

Scream is full of sneaky clues as to the killers&#39; identities. One, however, is even more sinister and disturbing than all the rest.




Wes Craven&#39;s Scream is widely hailed as one of the smartest and most original horror movies ever made. Boasting dozens of hidden Easter eggs and clues that reward repeat viewing, the film remains a fan favorite decades after release thanks to its thrilling central mystery, iconic characters, and a swathe of popular sequels. However, while much of the movie has been thoroughly dissected since 1996, one small detail – hinting at the true identity of the killer before they&#39;re revealed – proves that there&#39;s still more to discover.




Although the whole Scream movie series centers around the ever-changing identity of Ghostface, the original film arguably offers the most intriguing whodunnit. The film, set in the fictional town of Woodsboro, stars Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott, a high schooler who finds herself targeted by a masked, knife-wielding maniac. As connections between the killer and Sidney&#39;s past are uncovered, it eventually becomes clear that friends Stu Macher and Billy Loomis are behind the attacks. However, while this revelation is reserved for the movie&#39;s climax, one creepy detail hints at Stu&#39;s guilt before it&#39;s officially confirmed.

                  Scream Cast: Where The Actors In The Horror Movie Are Now   The original Scream was filled with young actors who went on to have successful careers in movies and television. Here&#39;s where the cast ended up.   


 Hanging Dolls Heads Confirm Stu&#39;s Identity As The Killer 
          




In one of the film&#39;s final chase sequences, Sidney desperately tries to escape Ghostface by running through Stu Macher&#39;s house following a party. Panicked, she tears through different rooms, before being cornered in an upstairs attic. At first glance, the room seems fairly ordinary, filled with various objects that Sidney ultimately uses to try and barricade herself in. However, on closer inspection, it becomes clear that this room also contains multiple bizarre dolls, dangling grotesquely from the ceiling.


 

The dolls in and of themselves are undeniably unsettling. However, what makes them even more alarming is that they appear to mirror the body of Casey Becker, the first victim, who was brutally suspended from a tree following her murder. Coupled with the fact that the dolls are strewn across Stu&#39;s house, this blink-and-you&#39;ll-miss-it moment makes it clear that Stu himself has a connection to at least one death in the movie, marking him out as the real Ghostface before it is officially revealed.






 Other Killer Clues In Scream 
         

While the dolls in Stu&#39;s house are an undeniably significant hint, they&#39;re far from the only breadcrumb in the movie. For instance, in the very same chase sequence, Ghostface startles Sidney by bursting out of a door, implying that he already knows the layout of the house. Further clues as to Scream&#39;s real killer include Stu checking himself for bruises the morning after his first attack on Sydney, Stu and Billy behaving menacingly towards Randy in the video rental store, and Stu attempting to direct blame towards Sidney&#39;s father for the murders. While many of these moments are only identifiable on repeat viewing, they nonetheless highlight Scream&#39;s willingness to tantalize the audience with the truth.
