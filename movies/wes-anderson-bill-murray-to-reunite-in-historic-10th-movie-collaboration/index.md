 What Is Bill Murray’s Best Wes Anderson Film? 
          

Anderson is a distinctive filmmaker for several reasons, among them his bold color palettes and hyper-stylized visual look, but one of them is his cast of characters. Throughout his directing career, Anderson has developed a cast of returning actors, including Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Luke Wilson, and Tilda Swinton. Murray is Anderson’s most frequent collaborator, though the celebrated actor did not appear in the director’s 2023 film, Asteroid City.

                  All 11 Wes Anderson Movies Ranked Worst-Best   Here&#39;s every quirky and eccentric movie by director Wes Anderson, from The Royal Tenenbaums to Fantastic Mr. Fox, ranked worst to best.   

Just as Anderson helms idiosyncratic films, Murray provides distinctively odd performances in these movies. One of the best examples is Murray’s titular role in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, in which Murray plays a mourning ship captain searching for the infamous leopard shark after it kills one of his crew members. Murray provides an oddball charm to what is probably one of Anderson’s most unusual films plot-wise.




While The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is one of Murray’s best Anderson roles, he delivers even more stellar performances in his first two films with the director: Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums. Rushmore was his first collaboration with the director, where he plays Herman Blume, mentor to Max Fischer. In The Royal Tenenbaums, he plays Tenenbaum in-law Raleigh St. Clair, who is a neurologist running experiments on the iconic Dudley Heinsbergen. Both performances are fantastic, though The Royal Tenenbaums may be Murray’s most quintessentially Andersonian role. After so many years of working together, it will be exciting to see what Anderson and Murray come up with in their next project.
