## Literature Review



Many modern blockbusters fall prey to a litany of problems that are commonly levied at the massive films, but one franchise has managed to avoid all of these issues: Planet of the Apes. The Planet of the Apes franchise is a long-running sci-fi series that has been critically acclaimed since the very beginning, and despite how popular many of the movies are, the series has been rebooted several times. The modern Planet of the Apes series reimagined the franchise as a large-scale action blockbuster, bringing the movies tons of success while also proving that blockbusters truly can be done right.




2011&#39;s Dawn of the Planet of the Apes put an entirely new spin on the Planet of the Apes franchise, with the first film in Matt Reeves&#39; trilogy exploring the genesis of the Simian Flu as well as the initial rise of a race of superintelligent apes. The following two films, Rise of the Planet of the Apes and War for the Planet of the Apes, continued chronicling Caesar&#39;s epic story, with the saga being critically and commercially successful throughout. Now the series is returning with 2024&#39;s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, reminding audiences that the Planet of the Apes franchise is a blockbuster series done right.

 The Planet Of The Apes Trilogy Was Blockbuster Done Right 
   Close     




As many fans have recognized, the Planet of the Apes trilogy was blockbuster done right. One of the main reason for this is the consistent talent behind the scenes. Matt Reeves is the director of all three films in the modern Planet of the Apes trilogy, something that is incredibly rare in major blockbuster series. This allows the three Planet of the Apes movies to feel like one cohesive authorial vision, something that is immensely important to the continued success of any movie franchise. Plenty of other talented artists worked on all three films as well, showing that blockbuster and art are not mutually exclusive categories.

The Planet of the Apes franchise also managed to do several other things that proved it knew how to do blockbusters right. While Planet of the Apes is a ridiculous action movie, it never felt the need to wink at the audience, showing that the films were in on the joke. Instead, the Planet of the Apes movies took the subject matter incredibly seriously, showing audiences that it was ok for them to take the films seriously as well. Planet of the Apes also had consistent overarching themes that served as the backbone for all three films, with this clear thematic purpose being lost on many other blockbuster movies.






 How Planet Of The Apes Avoids Other Franchises’ Mistakes 
          

The Planet of the Apes movies managed to avoid the pitfalls of many other blockbuster franchises, further proving that it was a cut above the rest. One of the most common criticisms levied towards the MCU is that there is simply too much to keep track of, with new movies, shows, and spin-offs being announced after the successes of previous projects. The modern Planet of the Apes movies, however, avoided this problem. There aren&#39;t any Planet of the Apes spin-off movies, and the films have large gaps between them, with each one being a mainline film.

DC&#39;s cinematic outings have often been plagued by a lack of poor planning, with the path forward always changing due to differing audience tastes or the failure of some ideas. The Planet of the Apes trilogy managed to avoid this problem by being one consistent character-focused story that seems as if it was planned from the very beginning, with the franchise not wavering due to external factors. Finally, one of the most common criticisms of blockbusters is shoddy rushed CGI, something that clearly doesn&#39;t apply to Planet of the Apes due to it having some of the most critically-acclaimed digital characters ever.

Although Matt Reeves&#39; Planet of the Apes trilogy is over, the franchise is not, as it will be moving ahead. 2024 will see the release of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, a new film that takes place centuries after War for the Planet of the Apes. The film will focus on new characters in a new setting, although it will be in the same timeline as Reeves&#39; trilogy. Since the film isn&#39;t out yet, it is impossible to say if it will live up to the original. However, many fans are crossing their fingers that the film will continue to uphold the immense legacy of the Planet of the Apes franchise.
