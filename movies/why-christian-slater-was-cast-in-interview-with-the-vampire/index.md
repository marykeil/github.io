## Literature Review



Christian Slater was cast in Interview with the Vampire only because of a tragic event. Interview with the Vampire is the 1994 gothic horror movie adaptation of the 1976 novel of the same name by Anne Rice. Starring Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt and Brad Pitt as Louis de Pointe du Lac, Interview with the Vampire is a classic of LGBTQ&#43; vampire movies, a genre that has unexpectedly become the home of many queer TV shows and movies. Rice&#39;s novel is just a part of the 13-novel franchise The Vampire Chronicles, which also ties into her New Tales of the Vampires and Lives of the Mayfair Witches, spin-off franchises.




The 1994 movie is not the only adaptation of Rice&#39;s work. Queen of the Damned was released in 2002 and a TV adaptation of Interview with the Vampire premiered on AMC in 2022. Interview with a Vampire earned two Oscar nominations for Best Art Direction and Best Original Score, and Kirsten Dunst was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress at the age of 12 for her performance as the young vampire Claudia. The film is filled with prolific stars, including Christian Slater, who plays Daniel Molloy, the reporter who conducts the interview with Louis. However, Slater was not the original first choice for the film.

 Christian Slater Replaced River Phoenix In Interview With The Vampire, Who Died Before Filming 
          




Daniel Molloy was actually supposed to be played by River Phoenix, the older, and for a time, much better-known older brother of Joaquin. Phoenix was originally cast as Daniel but tragically died outside the famed LA nightclub, The Viper Room, after a drug overdose on October 31, 1993 (via People). Only 23 at the time, his passing caused an outpouring of tributes, sadness, and love for the actor who had starred in such memorable movies as Stand By Me and Running on Empty. It was only a week before Phoenix was supposed to come on set that he passed, forcing production to scramble to replace him (via Looper).

Despite the attractive nature of the role, film, and co-stars, Slater was very worried about taking on Phoenix&#39;s character. About the role, Slater said, &#34;That was so tragic, and it was really awkward to be stepping into that kind of scenario.&#34; (via The Hollywood Interview) Phoenix&#39;s death was extremely public, and it would have been uncomfortable to attempt to take his place. Slater allayed his worries by donating his entire salary of $250,000 to EarthSave and Earth Trust. Interview with the Vampire is dedicated to River Phoenix with the end-credits message, &#34;In Memory of River Phoenix 1970-1993&#34;.






 Christian Slater Still Wants To Know What Happened To His Interview With The Vampire Character 
          

Interview with the Vampire ends on a cliffhanger. Daniel flees Louis after his interview, only to be attacked and bitten by Lestat. The vampire offers Daniel something he never had, the choice to decide if he wants to become a vampire, and the film ends before Daniel decides. Christian Slater himself wonders what happened to Daniel, saying in an interview with CinemaBlend:



&#34;I felt like, with Interview with the Vampire, I did get bitten on the neck by Tom Cruise and he says at the end of the movie ‘I’ll give you the choice that I never had.’ I’m curious to know what choice did that character make?&#34;




The only movie that followed, Queen of the Damned, did away with the characters and storylines of Interview with the Vampire, inventing its own and leaving what happened to Daniel unanswered. In the novels, it&#39;s Danny who seeks out Lestat but instead finds Armand, Antonio Banderas in the movie, whom he begs to turn him into a vampire. When Daniel is near death, Armand finally relents and turns the reporter into a vampire like he had always hoped.
