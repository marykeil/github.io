## Literature Review
A Quiet Place: Day One brings back a returning character for the prequel story, and it will make A Quiet Place 2 even more tragic as a result.




A Quiet Place: Day One is confirmed to bring back one returning character from the previous movies, and it will make A Quiet Place Part II more tragic as a result. John Krasinski&#39;s sci-fi thriller franchise returns in 2024 with a prequel exploring the first day that the noise-sensitive aliens come to Earth. A Quiet Place: Day One will shift the focus away from the Abbott family, with Krasinski also electing not to direct, but the prequel will not be completely devoid of familiar faces. This is because there has been confirmation that Djimon Hounsou will return in A Quiet Place&#39;s prequel after originally appearing in the second installment.




Djimon Hounsou&#39;s return as &#34;Man on Island&#34; in A Quiet Place: Day One was an exciting reveal for the franchise to make. After having a relatively small role in A Quiet Place 2, the death of Hounsou&#39;s character seemingly eliminated any chance for him to be explored further. A Quiet Place: Day One will surely bring more information about this rather mysterious character and give an actor of Hounsou&#39;s talents more opportunity to shine. The excitement that should stem from this returning character is understandable. However, it also means the prequel movie will likely change how audiences see A Quiet Place 2&#39;s ending.

There is a good chance that Djimon Hounsou&#39;s character&#39;s death in A Quiet Place 2 will feel completely different for viewers after seeing him in A Quiet Place: Day One&#39;s cast. The previous entry in the franchise gave &#34;Man on Island&#34; a tragic end as he died protecting the Abbott children from the aliens. While it was sad to see Hounsou&#39;s character go in this way, the sequel did not exactly give it proper weight due to how little screen time he had. A Quiet Place 2 mostly made him a disposable character who served a purpose in the story of keeping the main characters safe.

Now that A Quiet Place: Day One will bring Hounsou back, there is an opportunity for the prequel to better explore his character. This should include making audiences feel much more invested in his life and backstory before A Quiet Place 2. If the prequel can achieve this, it will certainly make the tragedy of his demise in the sequel that much more impactful for audiences in future viewings. A Quiet Place: Day One can then work to make John Krasinski&#39;s sequel even better four years after its release.






 A Quiet Place&#39;s Prequel Could Include Other Sad Connections

That would mean viewers will be reminded of how characters played by Lupita Nyong&#39;o, Joseph Quinn, and Alex Wolff die on subsequent viewings.
