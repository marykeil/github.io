## Literature Review

Mad-Eye Moody managed to alter the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire by adding Harry Potter as a competitor, but it took an intricate plan.




Alastor &#34;Mad-Eye&#34; Moody managed to alter the Triwizard Tournament in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire as the one who put Harry&#39;s name in the Goblet of Fire, but it took a well-orchestrated plan. Although Mad-Eye served as a key member for the remainder of the Harry Potter franchise, he wasn&#39;t exactly himself in his introductory appearance. In fact, another figure was impersonating him all along. Albus Dumbledore hired the wizard as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. During his only year as the DADA professor, he guided Harry Potter during the Triwizard Tournament but had ulterior motives.




Lord Voldemort needed a pathway for Harry to complete a ritual that would bring back the Dark wizard&#39;s physical body, and that opportunity hinged on the student&#39;s participation in the Triwizard Tournament, leading to who put Harry&#39;s name in the Goblet of Fire. To infiltrate Hogwarts to manipulate Harry, Voldemort enlists the help of a Death Eater named Barty Crouch Jr., who previously escaped from Azkaban. Barty then kidnaps Mad-Eye and disguises himself as the professor by using a Polyjuice Potion. This allows Barty to walk freely around Hogwarts as he concocts a precise plan to give Harry a chance to participate in the Triwizard Tournament.

                  Harry Potter: 10 Differences Between The Goblet Of Fire Book &amp; Movie   The Goblet Of Fire is a turning point in the Harry Potter series, and here&#39;s what changed from the book to the film version.   


 Barty Crouch Jr. Used A Powerful Charm To Put Harry&#39;s Name In The Goblet Of Fire 
The Goblet Of Fire Was Confused By A Confundus Charm
          




The Triwizard Tournament traditionally features one student from each of the three schools in attendance. That trio of Champions has to be 17 based on the age spell Dumbledore put in place. Despite those restrictions, Harry&#39;s name was chosen as the fourth Champion, prompting people to wonder who put Harry&#39;s name in the Goblet of Fire, the impartial judge used to select contestants. While staff and fellow students believe Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire, it was Barty Crouch Jr. disguised as Professor Moody. Barty uses a Confundus Charm to confuse the Goblet of Fire, so it selects Harry&#39;s name as the fourth contestant from an unspecified school.

The plan works, as Harry follows through with the competition against Cedric Diggory, Fleur Delacour, and Viktor Krum. Barty, meanwhile, continues guiding Harry through the three tasks before successfully turning the Triwizard Cup into a Portkey. Voldemort restores his physical body before Barty intends to kill Harry to solidify himself as one of the Dark Lord&#39;s most loyal followers. Instead, Dumbledore and other members of the staff catch on to Barty&#39;s ploy and rescue the real Mad-Eye, allowing for his presence in the succeeding Harry Potter installments.




                  Harry Potter: 10 Hidden Details From Goblet Of Fire   Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire is a jam-packed entry in J.K. Rowling&#39;s franchise, with many easy to miss details that slip through the cracks.   



 Why Everyone Thought Harry Put His Own Name In The Goblet 
Harry&#39;s Ego Meant Putting His Own Name In Didn&#39;t Seem Farfetched
          

There is a Goblet of Fire scene in which Dumbledore basically pins Harry against a wall and asks him roughly, &#34;Harry, did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?&#34; The scene occurs directly after Harry&#39;s name flies out of the Goblet, and Dumbledore calls him out in front of the entire Great Hall. He takes Harry back with the rest of the champions, as well as their respective school&#39;s headmasters, and starts to immediately grill Harry about how and why exactly his name was selected.

Unfortunately, many believe Harry put his name in the Goblet of Fire because they think his ego has gotten the better of him. Many believe Harry wants the glory of winning the Triwizard Tournament all to himself, including, for a brief moment, Dumbledore. There is no question Harry has a reckless streak while attending Hogwarts, but many think this is due to him having something to prove. Fortunately, the question of who put Harry&#39;s name in the Goblet of Fire is found not to be Harry, as Dumbledore recognizes that only dark magic could&#39;ve confounded the Goblet, and Harry isn&#39;t capable of that.




                  10 Harsh Realities Of Rereading Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is many fans&#39; favorite book in the series, but it has a few problems that don&#39;t sit right when rereading it today.   



 What Happened To Barty Crouch Jr. After The Goblet Of Fire 
Barty Crouch Jr. Is Fed To The Dementors
          

Many characters, such as Bellatrix Lestrange and Sirius Black, escaped from the Dementors in the wizard prison Azkaban. However, in the end, Barty Crouch Jr. isn&#39;t able to outrun the Dementors once he&#39;s caught the second time around. The Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ending doesn&#39;t explain what happens to Barty Crouch Jr. after he&#39;s exposed for impersonating Mad-Eye Moody. Rather, he&#39;s simply carted out of the room and is never heard from again. It&#39;s implied he&#39;s taken back to Azkaban, but this would create an Order of the Phoenix plot hole – there&#39;s a mass breakout at the beginning of the film, but Barty Crouch Jr. isn&#39;t there.




While the movie offers zero explanation, the books explain what happened to Crouch Jr. In J.K. Rowling&#39;s novels, it&#39;s said that Crouch is taken to the Dementors to suffer the Dementor&#39;s Kiss, which sucks the soul out of his body. It&#39;s a fitting end for the Harry Potter character, as taking him back to Azkaban would&#39;ve not only created a plot hole but would&#39;ve proved an unworthy punishment for someone who has already broken out once before.

                  Harry Potter: 10 Things From The Goblet Of Fire That Haven&#39;t Aged Well   Harry Potter is an iconic franchise, and Goblet of Fire was an awesome movie — but these things from the fourth installment haven&#39;t aged too well.   



 Why Everyone Was Mad At Harry When He Was Chosen For The Triwizard Tournament 
It Looked Like Harry Was Obsessed With Chasing Glory
         

With many people believing that Harry put his own name in the Goblet of Fire, it causes great strain on some of Harry&#39;s most personal relationships — particularly his friendship with Ron Weasley. However, Ron isn&#39;t the only one upset with Harry about competing in the Triwizard Tournament, as throughout Goblet of Fire it seems like the entire school is against Harry. Ron is personally upset because he wishes Harry would let him in on the secret of how he did it, and he is mad that Harry wouldn&#39;t fess up. In addition, Harry&#39;s inclusion in the tournament fed into Ron&#39;s worst fears of forever remaining second-best to his best friend.




The Triwizard Tournament rules state that one has to be 17 to enter. The Weasley twins prove the consequences of what happens if one tries to put their name in, despite being underage. Most of the school believes Harry secretly found a way to add his name and then refused to tell anyone, making him sneaky and ungenerous. Hufflepuff House, in particular, scorns Harry because they believe he is stealing glory from not only their house but also Cedric Diggory.

Ravenclaw probably followed suit for these reasons, and Malfoy and the Slytherin house never left Harry alone. In the end, Harry&#39;s name is cleared, but that doesn&#39;t stop the incident from making huge waves in Harry Potter.

              Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  The fourth film in the Harry Potter movie franchise, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, sees the titular hero and his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger, return for their fourth school year at Hogwarts. Hogwarts is hosting the International Triwizard Tournament, a friendly sporting contest between several magical schools this year. Despite being ineligible to participate in the event due to being under seventeen, Harry&#39;s name mysteriously appears during the drawing process for the school&#39;s elected champions alongside another, Cedric Diggory. Harry will train and prepare himself for a challenging contest while still trying to find out the truth of how his name was chosen in the first place.
