## Literature Review

Barry Keoghan&#39;s Oliver goes through several memorable costume changes in Saltburn. One, however, is a subtle callback to the actor&#39;s breakthrough.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for SaltburnBarry Keoghan&#39;s role in Saltburn is one of the most memorable of his acting career, but one of his costumes in the movie provides a subtle callback to one of the actor&#39;s earlier, perhaps even more provocative performances. Although he&#39;s only 31, Barry Keoghan has already taken on several challenging parts. In fact, he&#39;s quickly carved out a niche playing unstable, sinister characters, imbuing them with a charisma that&#39;s both beguiling and scary.




This skill is on full display in Emerald Fennell&#39;s twisted black comedy. In Saltburn, Keoghan plays Oliver Quick, a university student who falls under the spell of Jacob Elordi&#39;s captivating Felix Catton. After lying about his family&#39;s circumstances, Oliver is invited to stay at Felix&#39;s Saltburn estate, where he conspires about how he can remain in the house after he&#39;s outstayed his welcome. Given his scheming personality, Keoghan&#39;s Saltburn performance demands the continuation of a career trend that arguably began with his breakout role in another challenging drama. While there is no explicit narrative connection between the two projects, one of Oliver&#39;s costumes suggests a clear thematic link.


 Barry Keoghan&#39;s Antlers Are A Killing Of A Sacred Deer Callback 
         

During a party ostensibly held in his honor, Oliver stalks through the background wearing a pair of deer antlers. While there are other reasons behind this costume choice, the use of antlers provides a clear link between Saltburn and another Keoghan project; Yorgo Lanthimos&#39; The Killing of a Sacred Deer. In that movie, Keoghan plays the similarly unhinged Martin, who forces Colin Farrell to kill a member of his family as revenge for killing Martin&#39;s father on the operating table. Given the similar themes of familial death throughout Saltburn, the callback to The Killing of a Sacred Deer is more than just a coincidence.




Other aspects of Keoghan&#39;s performance also echo the earlier Lanthimos movie. Most obviously, his character in both movies invades a cohesive family unit, leaving havoc in his wake. Additionally, both films explore the idea of justice and fate, albeit from very different angles. While Lanthimos&#39; film is a very clear analogy for action and consequence, Saltburn discusses how society&#39;s notions around inherited wealth play into a wider discussion of class and identity. However, despite these slight differences, the films&#39; similarities are reinforced by Keoghan&#39;s very pointed deer costume.



 What Barry Keoghan&#39;s Saltburn Antlers Really Mean 
          

As in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, the deer metaphor in Saltburn has multiple meanings. Most obviously, it&#39;s a reference to the wider Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream theme of Oliver&#39;s birthday party, which is itself a play about transformation, deception, and multiple identities. Oliver&#39;s deer persona also identifies him as a prey animal, surrounded by vicious predators that circle and mock him. However, with his horns, he also reveals another side to himself – something more dangerous.




                  Saltburn Ending Explained: What Really Happened To Felix   The ending of Emerald Fennell&#39;s Saltburn is built on a web of lies spun by Oliver Quick and reveals the twisted layers of his obsession with Felix.   

The appearance of Oliver&#39;s horns not only makes him seem slightly satanic, but also ties him into one of Saltburn&#39;s many inspirations – the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. In mythology, the horned Minotaur lay waiting in a labyrinth, killing any princes who came to challenge it. Considering that this is exactly what Oliver does to Felix (in the center of a maze, no less), it&#39;s clear that the horns serve both a symbolic and practical purpose. Not only do they establish a connection with Lanthimos&#39; movie, but they add a layer of complexity to Oliver&#39;s character with multiple potential meanings.
