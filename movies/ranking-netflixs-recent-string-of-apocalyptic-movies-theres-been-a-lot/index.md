## Literature Review

Since late-2018, Netflix has released eight separate apocalyptic movies. Here&#39;s how all of them rank against each other and which are worth watching.




While Netflix is now a major movie producer across all genres, the streaming service seems to have a particular fixation with apocalyptic movies. Since the release of Bird Box in late 2018, the platform has produced no less than eight original movies centered around the apocalypse or apocalyptic events. Considering the scale of production needed to realistically bring such environments to life, compared to other more economical genres like romantic comedy, this number of movies about the end of the world might strike some as surprisingly high.
With so many different films from the past few years to choose from, genre aficionados are somewhat spoiled for choice. However, when comparing all eight side-by-side, it&#39;s clear that some stand up better than others. While hits like Sandra Bullock&#39;s Bird Box and Army of the Dead have broken into the mainstream and even started their own franchises, others, such as the anime Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, have been less successful. To help viewers decide how they should their time, here are all eight of Netflix&#39;s recent apocalypse movies, ranked worst to best.
            
 
 10 Realistic Apocalypse Movies That Will Keep You Up At Night 
There are many scary apocalypse movies involving big monsters and adverse weather events, but ones with a touch of realism are often the scariest. 












 








 8  Awake (2021) 
A sci-fi thriller that sent audiences to sleep
        

Despite a potentially intriguing premise and strong acting pedigree, including the likes of Gina Rodriguez and Jennifer Jason Leigh, the 2021 thriller Awake is undoubtedly the least successful recent Netflix apocalypse movie. The film imagines a world where no one can go to sleep, sending the population into a panic and causing sleep deprivation. While lack of sleep and the resulting paranoia could make for a gripping movie, Awake was criticized for its ponderous pacing and superficial approach to the premise. However, despite a paltry 24% on Rotten Tomatoes, the movie did find an audience and was number 1 on Netflix in the days following its release.





 7  IO (2019) 
Ambitious and experimental movie that couldn&#39;t deliver
        

Like many post-apocalyptic science fiction movies, IO is not short of big ideas. The movie imagines an alternate present day in which Earth&#39;s atmosphere has become toxic. This forces most of the population to survive instead on Io, a moon of Jupiter. Instead of seeking easy wins with spectacular action set-pieces, IO is a deliberately contemplative movie that feels undeniably stylish in places. However, critics almost unanimously agreed that the plotting was ponderously slow, ruining the message of the story. It currently sits at 33% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an even worse audience score of 19%.





 6  Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead (2023) 
A squandered Japanese adaptation
        

Based on a popular Japanese manga series, Zom 100 frustratingly fails to deliver on what could be a wacky and entertaining premise. A more irreverent example of the zombie apocalypse sub-genre, Zom 100 centers on a frustrated office worker who sees the world&#39;s end as an opportunity to finally start living life to its fullest. A blend of comedy, drama, and horror, Zom 100 is a live-action remake that consistently struggles to juggle all its disparate components. However, the concept is inventive enough that many viewers found it worth watching.





 5  Bird Box Barcelona (2023) 
Spin-off installment of the Sandra Bullock original


 







        


  Bird Box Barcelona  
7 
/ 10 




  Release Date    July 14, 2023     Director    David Pastor , Àlex Pastor     Cast    Georgina Campbell , Mario Casas , Diego Calva , Michelle Jenner     Runtime    111 Minutes    


Following the worldwide success of the original Sandra Bullock horror movie, Bird Box Barcelona moves the action – unsurprisingly – to Catalonia. Sticking with the same premise, where a mysterious entity causes anyone who looks at it to take their lives, Bird Box Barcelona adds some interesting new elements to the franchise&#39;s lore. However, critics felt that the film was significantly less suspenseful than its predecessor, for all its potentially intriguing ideas. Indicative of this is Bird Box Barcelona&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes score of 51% – significantly worse than the original.

 4  Army of the Dead (2021) 
Zack Snyder&#39;s stylish but flawed return to the zombie genre


 







        


  Army of the Dead  


  Release Date    May 21, 2021     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ana de la Reguera , Samantha Win , Tig Notaro , Matthias Schweighöfer , Huma Qureshi , Omari Hardwick , Michael Cassidy , Theo Rossi , Ella Purnell , Raul Castillo , Hiroyuki Sanada , Garret Dillahunt , Richard Cetrone , Dave Bautista , Nora Arnezeder     Runtime    139 minutes     Genres    Action , Horror , Crime    


Considering that his 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake both revitalized the zombie genre and laid the foundations for his career, expectations were high ahead of Zack Snyder&#39;s Army of the Dead. While the finished movie may not have quite lived up to the hype, it is certainly a worthy addition to Netflix&#39;s roster of apocalyptic movies. The gently comedic heist romp stars a gang of thieves tasked with breaking into a Las Vegas casino vault. The only obstacle is the horde of zombies that have taken over the city. While its script occasionally falls flat, Army of the Dead delivers suitably pulpy visuals and is widely regarded as a return to form for Snyder.





 3  Bird Box 
A scary, but somewhat derivative thriller
        

        


  Bird Box  


  Release Date    December 13, 2018     Director    Susanne Bier     Cast    Machine Gun Kelly , Pruitt Taylor Vince , BD Wong , Danielle Macdonald , Lil Rel Howery , Tom Hollander , Julian Edwards , Sarah Paulson , Rosa Salazar , Parminder Nagra , Sandra Bullock , Trevante Rhodes , Vivien Lyra Blair , John Malkovich , Jacki Weaver     Runtime    124 minutes     Genres    Sci-Fi , Drama , Horror    


Set in a world where seeing your enemy can cause you to die, Bird Box&#39;s greatest strength is also its main weakness. The film&#39;s core conceit, which requires star Sandra Bullock to travel blindfolded, means that this 2018 horror hit certainly delivers on tension. However, with its emphasis on the body&#39;s senses, some critics felt that Bird Box was essentially a retread of an earlier (and more effective) genre release, A Quiet Place. Nevertheless, the movie was generally well-received and proved extremely popular with audiences. Netflix figures suggest that 45 million households watched the film within the first week of release – claimed to be the platform&#39;s best-ever performance for an original movie.

 2  Don&#39;t Look Up (2021) 
A frustrated rallying cry against the climate crisis


 







        


  Don&#39;t Look Up  


  Release Date    December 24, 2021     Director    Adam McKay     Cast    Meryl Streep , Tyler Perry , Himesh Patel , Cate Blanchett , Timothee Chalamet , Tomer Sisley , Jonah Hill , Leonardo DiCaprio , Scott Mescudi , Jennifer Lawrence , Mark Rylance , Rob Morgan , Melanie Lynskey , Ron Perlman , Michael Chiklis , Ariana Grande     Rating    R     Runtime    145 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama , Sci-Fi    


An embittered and acerbic commentary on the media, climate change, and humanity&#39;s unwillingness to engage with disaster, Don&#39;t Look Up certainly doesn&#39;t shy away from relevant issues. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, the film follows a pair of scientists desperately trying to warn the world about the impending impact of a rogue comet. Don&#39;t Look Up was one of 2021&#39;s most divisive releases, with critics torn over whether the movie&#39;s message was too on-the-nose, or whether it was a suitably satirical takedown of modern political and media culture. Either way, Don&#39;t Look Up is certainly thought-provoking enough to rank among Netflix&#39;s best apocalyptic movies.





 1  Leave The World Behind 
A well-acted thriller with an important message
        

  Leave the World Behind  
8 
/ 10 



  Release Date    December 8, 2023     Director    Sam Esmail     Cast    Julia Roberts , Mahershala Ali , Ethan Hawke , Myha&#39;la , Kevin Bacon     Runtime    141 Minutes    


One of the best and most effective thrillers on Netflix, Leave The World Behind makes full use of its all-star cast to craft a compelling and heartbreaking apocalypse story. The movie stars Julia Roberts, Kevin Bacon, Mahershala Ali, and Ethan Hawke as terrified survivors of a mysterious event that is causing technology to fail across the country. The movie&#39;s power comes from its sense of uncertainty, since none of the characters have a full picture of exactly what is going on. However, its simple but effective message about technology dependence and powerful performances across the board help make Leave The World Behind the best of Netflix&#39;s apocalypse movies.
