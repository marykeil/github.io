## Literature Review

This Ben Affleck sequel is highly anticipated, but also extremely important for the actor, who has suffered from seven straight box office bombs.




Although Ben Affleck&#39;s upcoming sequel, The Accountant 2, is exciting all on its own, it also has a lot riding on it, as this movie could be the one to finally break Affleck&#39;s string of box office bombs. The Accountant 2 is the upcoming sequel to Ben Affleck&#39;s 2016 thriller, The Accountant. The Accountant follows Christian Wolff, a mathematics savant that does accounting for major criminal organizations, a job that, once he starts putting the discrepancies together, becomes very dangerous. After eight years, a sequel is finally being made, with Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal reprising their roles. The Accountant 2 likely will not be released until 2025 at least.




The news about The Accountant 2 is exciting for fans of the first film, but it is also especially good for Ben Affleck himself. Since the first The Accountant movie was released in 2016, the actor, writer, and director has only been a part of box office bombs. From Justice League to The Last Duel, Affleck has participated in major blockbusters and important productions, yet all of them have seen disappointment at the box office. Even his streaming films, which have no box office numbers, have been subject to mixed reviews. Therefore, the potential for The Accountant 2 to do well makes it a particularly important movie for the actor.

 The Accountant 2 Could Be A Box Office Hit For Ben Affleck (&amp; He Needs It) 
         




Ultimately, what makes The Accountant 2 so vital for Ben Affleck is that it could finally break his streak of big budget movies that bombed at the box office. The Accountant was his last film to do well at the box office, and that was eight years ago, in 2016. On a budget of $44 million, it grossed $155.2 million. In this way, it is clear that The Accountant has enough interest to garner some impressive box office numbers, and hopefully, The Accountant 2 will do something similar. If this is the case, then perhaps Ben Affleck can start seeing better box office numbers, along with making well-liked movies.

One risk that comes with The Accountant 2 is that Ben Affleck&#39;s movies may be box office bombs, but that does not necessarily mean they are bad or disliked. Films like Justice League were very much appreciated by superhero fans, and yet the film&#39;s massive budget made breaking even especially difficult. The same goes for The Last Duel, which was Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, yet only made $30 million on a $100 million budget. The same could happen for The Accountant 2. Fans may love the film, but if they do not go to the theaters, then this could be another failure for Affleck.






 Why Ben Affleck Has Had So Many Recent Box Office Bombs 
          

There are many unique reasons why Ben Affleck has suffered so many box office bombs since 2016. First and foremost, some of his movies have simply not brought in enough interest from audiences. For example, in 2023 Affleck starred in a mystery action thriller called Hypnotic. Without a well-known cast or an arresting premise, this movie simply did not bring audiences into theaters. However, there are reasons other than the quality of the film. As previously mentioned, many of Ben Affleck&#39;s films like Justice League and The Last Duel have been lauded, yet they still did not bring in enough money.

When it comes to Justice League, the budget was simply too big to easily break even. On the other hand, The Last Duel is a movie that struggled at the box office because historical dramas often do worse than regular dramas or comedies. Furthermore, there are movies like Air, which was nominated for several awards, yet still didn&#39;t do especially well at the box office. This could have to do with the fact that Air premiered at the same time as The Super Mario Bros. Movie. On top of this, Affleck has been a part of various documentaries and streaming projects, which also have not helped his box office dilemma.






Air and The Super Mario Bros. Movie came out on the week of April 5, 2023.

At this point, The Accountant 2 is in the very early stages of development, despite being announced all the way back in 2021. So far, it has been confirmed that the movie is being made, and also that Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal will be reprising their roles as Christian Wolff and Braxton Wolff. Additionally, Gavin O&#39;Connor, who directed The Accountant in 2016 will return to direct The Accountant 2. Besides this sparse info, there is no word on what The Accountant 2 will be about after The Accountant ending or who else will join the cast. Either way, The Accountant 2 is full of very exciting potential.
