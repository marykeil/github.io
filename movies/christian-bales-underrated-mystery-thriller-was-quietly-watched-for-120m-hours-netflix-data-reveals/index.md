## Literature Review

Christian Bale&#39;s underrated and under-the-radar mystery thriller was quietly watched for over 120 million hours on Netflix, new in-depth data reveals.




The Pale Blue Eye was quietly watched for over 120 million hours on Netflix, new in-depth data reveals. Based on the novel of the same name, the mystery thriller stars Christian Bale as a brooding detective investigating a series of murders at the United States Military Academy in 1830, where he enlists the aid of one of the cadets â€“ a young Edgar Allan Poe (played by Harry Melling). The movie was released January 6, 2023 on Netflix and even though The Pale Blue Eye reviews were mostly positive, it managed to fly under the radar on the streaming service.




However, almost a year after its release, new Netflix data reveals that Bale&#39;s mystery thriller was actually a hit. According to the streamer&#39;s new biannual comprehensive engagement report, The Pale Blue Eye was quietly watched for 120.5 million hours from January to June 2023. For context, this is close to what We Have A Ghost (124.4 million hours viewed) and the French-language film AKA (120 million hours viewed) received within the same time frame.

 Why The Pale Blue Eye Became A Sleeper Hit 
          

Though it received little attention upon its release, the new Netflix data reveals that The Pale Blue Eye went on to become a sleeper hit. This can likely be attributed to its lead star, the Oscar-winning and always-entertaining actor, Christian Bale, who received praise for portraying a brooding, secretive character, as he has so many times in the past. The ensemble Pale Blue Eye cast was also praised for their incredible chemistry together, consisting of stars like Gillian Anderson, Lucy Boynton, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Toby Jones, Simon McBurney, Timothy Spall, and Robert Duvall.




The Pale Blue Eye represents Bale&#39;s third collaboration with writer-director Scott Cooper after 2013&#39;s Out of the Furnace and the 2017 Western Hostiles, both of which were box office failures. The Pale Blue Eye, opting instead for a straight-to-streaming release, was able to reach a much larger audience on Netflix, where viewers are much more willing to give a potentially middling movie a chance. Though the story has some soft spots, audiences ended up enamored with The Pale Blue Eye&#39;s creepy atmosphere and its compelling performances, chiefly from Bale.
