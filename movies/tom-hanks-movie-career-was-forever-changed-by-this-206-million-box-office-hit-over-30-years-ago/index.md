## Literature Review

Today, Tom Hanks is regarded as an actor capable of any role, and it was his dramatic performance in a 1993 movie that earned him this reputation.




Tom Hanks has proven that he is up to just about any role, and this started with the $206 million box office hit Philadelphia. Today, it&#39;s difficult to imagine a time in which Hanks&#39; star power didn&#39;t qualify him for just about any film, but like any other actor in Hollywood, there was a time when he was a complete newcomer. In the early days of Hanks&#39; career, he was known predominantly for comedies, but his emotional performance in 1993&#39;s Philadelphia threw the doors wide open.




Philadelphia follows the story of Andrew Becket (Hanks), a former associate at a corporate law firm who believes he has been wrongfully terminated after his superiors discovered he had AIDS. Planning to sue his old employers, Becket is turned down by several attorneys until he is eventually accepted as a client by Joe Miller (Denzel Washington). Of course, AIDs was an especially divisive topic in the 1990s, so Hanks&#39; role in Philadelphia pushed society to engage in a difficult conversation while also educating them on the truths and lies of homosexuality and HIV/AIDS. Ultimately, this meant a turning point in the actor&#39;s career.

                  Tom Hanks&#39; 10 Best Movies, Ranked   Tom Hanks has been in so many classic movies, from Toy Story to Forrest Gump. Throughout his career in Hollywood, these films are his best work.   


 Philadelphia Was The Biggest Proof That Tom Hanks Was A Great Dramatic Actor 
          




Prior to Philadelphia, Hanks played predominantly in romantic comedies, with films like Splash (1984), Big (1988), and Turner &amp; Hooch (1989) gaining him notoriety. These and more certainly showcased Hanks&#39; talent, and Big even earned him an Academy Award nomination. However, comedies are of an entirely different caliber than dramas—an actor specializing in one won&#39;t necessarily excel at the other. Hanks had a couple of dramatic roles leading up to the 90s, but these were negligible compared to his comedies in public opinion—until Philadelphia.

Playing a man dying from AIDS while facing discrimination and ignorance from everyone around him required a level of acting that Hanks hadn&#39;t yet brought to the big screen, and he pulled it off beautifully. Today, it&#39;s easy to take for granted that this isn&#39;t something audiences had been expecting from him at the time. Compared to the levity of his past roles, the controversial topics of Philadelphia came as a shock. However, Hanks&#39; performance earned compassion for a gay character with HIV at a time when neither was well tolerated. From then on, the dramatic roles came pouring in for Hanks.






 Philadelphia Is Still One Of Tom Hanks&#39; Best Movie Performances 
          

Since 1993, Hanks has given a lot of excellent performances. Forrest Gump (1994), Saving Private Ryan (1998), Castaway (2000)—all these films further proved this talented actor could step into the shoes of a variety of characters to breathtaking effect. However, as Hanks&#39; first massively successful drama (earning $206 million at the global box office) and the film that earned him his first Oscar, Philadelphia remains a standout project in the actor&#39;s filmography. Moreover, the movie did more than just demonstrate Hanks&#39; acting chops—it initiated much-needed education regarding HIV/AIDS at a time when it was desperately needed—how many actors can say that about their careers?
