# Rebel Moon Continues A Disappointing 2023 Sci-Fi Trend (But 2024 Could Fix It)


## SUMMARY 



  Rebel Moon and The Creator both fell short in their execution thanks to derivative narratives and plot points.   The disappointing performance of these original sci-fi films may discourage studios from investing in similar projects in the future.   However, there is hope for the genre due to promising 2024 sci-fi releases, like Bong Joon-Ho&#39;s Mickey 17.

## Literature Review

Unfortunately for movie lovers, Rebel Moon continues a disappointing 2023 science-fiction trend — though 2024 seems poised to fix the issue at hand.




Unfortunately for movie lovers, Rebel Moon continues a disappointing 2023 sci-fi trend — though 2024 seems poised to fix the issue at hand. Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire, director and co-writer Zack Snyder&#39;s space opera brain-child, debuted on Netflix to dismal reviews from critics and audiences alike. Not only is the film over-stuffed with slow-motion battles and bogged down by derivative storytelling choices, but Netflix&#39;s Rebel Moon is blurry. Snyder&#39;s stylish-to-a-fault visuals match the rest of the mess. Given the lack of sci-fi blockbusters based on original stories (and not pre-existing IP), it&#39;s an even bigger letdown. 




In Rebel Moon&#39;s first outing, ex-soldier Kora (Sofia Boutella) turns against the imperialistic, galaxy-ruling Motherworld and its army, the Imperium. By gathering together a rag-tag group of rebels who want to save a farming colony on the moon of Veldt from Imperium-caused extinction, Rebel Moon&#39;s Kora becomes Snyder&#39;s Star Wars-inspired hero. Since the director originally pitched the now-Rebel Moon as a more mature, darker Star Wars spin-off, the similarities aren&#39;t all that surprising. Cobbled together from bits of far superior films, Rebel Moon is a Star-Wars-meets-Seven-Samurai mood board. However, its failure could have much further-reaching implications.


 Rebel Moon &amp; The Creator Made Similar Sci-Fi Mistakes 
         

To make matters worse, Rebel Moon isn&#39;t the only original science-fiction epic to fumble its execution in 2023. Director Gareth Edwards received tons of much-deserved praise for Rogue One, the immediate prequel to 1977&#39;s first Star Wars film that painted the rebellion in a more realistic, gritty light. Of course, Edwards was also the filmmaker behind the well-received 2014 Godzilla reboot. That said, his track record for creating compelling spins on pre-established franchises is solid. Unfortunately, Edwards&#39; stab at an original sci-fi feature, The Creator, initially bombed at the box office. In fact, The Creator&#39;s best feature was its brand-new world.




In Hollywood, it&#39;s challenging to get anything green-lit — let alone a completely original concept. In the age of cinematic universes and sprawling franchises built on tried-and-true IP, like Marvel and Star Wars, it&#39;s even rarer to see an original genre film given a blockbuster-movie budget. However, Gareth Edwards&#39; past films inspired confidence, making space for The Creator. Set in 2070, The Creator sees humans engaged in a deadly war against artificial intelligence. Joshua (John David Washington), a former special forces agent, is tasked with hunting down the titular being and their enigmatic, war-ending weapon. Much like Rebel Moon, however, The Creator is dishearteningly derivative.



 Rebel Moon &amp; The Creator&#39;s Problems May Get In The Way Of Future Original Sci-Fi Blockbusters 
         

Despite being unoriginal, The Creator&#39;s reviews were largely positive, thanks to the film&#39;s impressive visuals and thrilling action set-pieces. Even so, the lack of unanimous critical acclaim impacted the movie&#39;s opening weekend performance at the box office — and there was a lot riding on that success. That is, if a big-budget, original idea like The Creator soared, it would help pave the way for other brand-new sci-fi features to get made. While Rebel Moon&#39;s reviews are overwhelmingly negative, it&#39;s holding steady in Netflix&#39;s top 10. For different reasons, neither original sci-fi film is a shining beacon of hope for the future of the genre.




It&#39;s great to see original ideas secure massive budgets, but when the green-lit features feel like stale amalgamations of other genre hits, it creates a worrying trend for sci-fi films. While some may feel that Rebel Moon&#39;s familiar plot was the point of the film, there&#39;s a difference between using a genre&#39;s well-established tropes to further an original idea and fully leaning on those tropes to tell a story that&#39;s all-too familiar. With lackluster returns at the box office for The Creator and a bevy of atrocious reviews for Rebel Moon, studios may be less willing to take risks on original sci-fi projects going forward. 



 2024&#39;s Big Sci-Fi Releases Could Turn Things Around For The Genre 
          

The good news? Rebel Moon might not completely derail the future of original sci-fi films in Hollywood and beyond. In fact, some of 2024&#39;s biggest sci-fi releases could turn things around for the beloved, enduring genre. For starters, Bong Joon-Ho&#39;s highly anticipated sci-fi film, Mickey 17, looks like a fresh entry in the well-worn genre. Given that the Oscar-winning director has crafted other hit science-fiction films, like Snowpiercer, Mickey 17 holds a lot of promise. It&#39;s true that 2024&#39;s most exciting sci-fi movie is based on a novel, but the source material, Mickey7, doesn&#39;t have the kind of reach of, say, Dune.
