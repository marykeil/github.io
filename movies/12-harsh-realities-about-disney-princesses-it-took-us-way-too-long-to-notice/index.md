## Literature Review

Though they&#39;re often meant to inspire children, some harsh realities about Disney princess films have gone ignored for too long. 




Disney princess films have been around since 1937, leaving plenty of time to reflect on these films and question some of the choices made in them. For the longest time, Disney princesses have been seen as role model characters for young children, especially young girls. However, looking at these films and characters through a modern lens provides a different, and often negative, perspective.
Many early Disney films contain things that haven&#39;t aged well since their release. Oftentimes, characters are portrayed in ways that perpetuate racist or sexist stereotypes and the seemingly empowering and inspirational princess films are not an exception. Examining Disney princess films with modern society in mind, it&#39;s easy to spot sour details within the beloved, classic films.
            
 
 All Disney Princess Movies In Order 
Disney has made princess movies for a long time, introducing many popular princesses introduced into pop culture. Just how many are there?












 








 12  Belle Believes The Beast Is Good 
Rather than seeing him as her captor
        

When discussing plots in classic Disney films that don&#39;t hold up by today&#39;s standards, the case of Stockholm Syndrome is often associated with Beauty and the Beast. While the message of the Beast&#39;s kindness and changed heart is important to share in a children&#39;s film, it&#39;s worth questioning how Belle was easily able to put their past behind them. Belle, rightfully so, shuts down any romantic gestures from Gaston, who is extremely self-centered. However, despite the Beast capturing her father and then Belle herself, she&#39;s able to move past it to break the curse that&#39;s transformed him into the Beast.





 11  Ariel Changed Her Life For Eric 
Despite knowing nothing about him


 







Many of Disney&#39;s princess movies are centered around romantic relationships. While there&#39;s nothing wrong with the princesses wanting to be in love, something that hasn&#39;t aged well in The Little Mermaid is Ariel&#39;s willingness to change her whole life for Eric. She acquired legs in place of her mermaid tail and signed a deal with Ursula to extract her voice.
These changes were made so that Ariel could be with Eric on land, despite knowing almost nothing about him. Although this choice is questionable, the live-action version of The Little Mermaid does focus a bit more on Ariel&#39;s quest for adventure and life outside the ocean. Ariel falls in love with Eric after spending time with him, thus the film makes it more clear that he&#39;s an extension of her dreams and goals, not her sole purpose.





 10  Women Are Often Being Rescued 
Changes Aren&#39;t Made Until Recent Films
        

Disney princess films are often portrayed, or seen largely by audiences, as empowering characters and stories for young women. Despite this, many of the princesses are put in positions of needing rescuing - typically by men. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian, activist Melissa Silverstein talked about the importance of creating full and rounded female characters. Silverstein said, &#34;They have to be individuals in the world because that is what girls expect to see.&#34;
Silverstein noted that rejecting the &#34;damsel in distress&#34; trope is important for both young girls and boys because it&#39;s not a realistic view of the world. Taking into account examples of earlier princesses diverting away from the damsel in distress role, such as Mulan, it still hasn&#39;t been until recently that Disney has left this trope behind on a broader level. One example of this is Moana, who, though helped out by Maui, takes it upon herself to save her island.





 9  Lack Of Diversity 
There Aren&#39;t Many Princesses Of Color


 







The Princess and the Frog is most recognized for featuring the first Black Disney princess. However, the film is also criticized because the representation is limited due to Tiana turning into, and remaining, a frog for the majority of the film. A common issue found throughout Disney princess films is the lack of diversity. Some of the latest Disney films with female leads are women of color, such as Mirabel in Encanto and Asha in Wish, but they aren&#39;t Disney princesses. Yet, the 2021 film Raya and the Last Dragon does feature a princess of color, Raya, so there&#39;s still hope for more diversity in future princess films.





 8  Flynn And Rapunzel&#39;s Age Gap 
He Is 26 And She&#39;s 18
        

In Tangled, Rapunzel&#39;s 18th birthday is brought up many times throughout the film. After meeting a thief on the run, Flynn Rider, the two of them start an adventure outside the castle and seek out the floating lanterns. Throughout the film, the two fall in love with one another, but Flynn Rider&#39;s age is never mentioned. It&#39;s only outside the film that it&#39;s confirmed he&#39;s 26. While they don&#39;t get married until later, their age gap is still worth questioning, especially considering it&#39;s not uncommon for Disney princesses to be teenagers.
            
 
 How Old Each Disney Princess Is (Including Frozen&#39;s Anna And Elsa) 
Disney princesses go through a lot of things that sometimes seem too mature, but most of the Disney princess&#39; ages are even younger than you think.








 7  Princes Kissing Sleeping Princesses 
Sleeping Beauty And Snow White
        

Two examples of Disney princesses being kissed whilst in a coma-like sleep are Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. In both of the films, the princes take it upon themselves to kiss the sleeping women in hopes of saving their lives. This in and of itself is well-intentioned, but it&#39;s a detail that&#39;s disturbing once audiences are old enough to realize the acts are non-consensual.





 6  Trouble For Snow White Voice Actress 
She Was Unable To Work


 







Similar to many other Disney films, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has behind-the-scenes details that are unknown to a majority of audiences. One of these details involves the work of Snow White&#39;s voice actress, Adriana Caselotti. It&#39;s been reported that following her work on the animated film, Walt Disney didn&#39;t allow her to do voice work for other projects and her pay was only $970 at the time. Even though it&#39;s not about the film or the Disney princess herself, this behind-the-scenes fact shines a light on actor treatment in early Hollywood and removes some fairytale elements when rewatching the film.





 5  They&#39;re Married Young 
And it&#39;s not always by choice
        

A common theme among three Disney princess films, Sleeping Beauty, Brave, and Aladdin, is the princesses being forced to marry. As princesses, Aurora and Merida are betrothed to marry men they do not know and Jasmine is told legally she must marry someone, whether or not she&#39;s in love with them. However, a positive outlook on this is the princesses&#39; response. The princesses make it clear they are upset or frustrated by the rules set in place. Their opposition is a reminder to use one&#39;s voice and stand up for one&#39;s beliefs.





 4  Pocahontas And John Smith 
The Real Story Vs. The Film
        

One of the harsh realities about Disney princesses that&#39;s difficult to argue about or explain is the story between Pocahontas and John Smith in Pocahontas. The Disney film shares a story between the two that fixates on love. In reality, there&#39;s no historical evidence of a romantic relationship occurring between the two. This false narrative is particularly disturbing considering the real-life role John Smith played in history.





 3  Singular Body Image 
Negative Impact On Young Audiences
        

Another issue of diversity present among many Disney princesses involves their body type. Where children can feel represented through the princesses&#39; race or their journeys in their films, the image of body type is limited. As adults, it&#39;s easy to understand the unrealistic beauty standard, but when kids absorb these images, it impacts their view of the world and their place in it (via Pacific Standard). It&#39;s a common issue found among many pieces of media or entertainment marketed to children, such as Barbie dolls.





 2  Darker Origin Stories 
Are hard to look past
        

Many of the Disney princesses are based on older tales with darker origins. This can make it difficult to watch the animated films without being reminded of the princesses&#39; darker, alternative ending. With The Little Mermaid, for example, Ariel&#39;s human form comes with consequences. She experiences pain with every step she takes, and the story ends, not with her marrying Eric, but instead turning into sea foam. For Cinderella, she does get to marry the prince, similar to the animated Cinderella ending. However, the pigeons get their revenge for her stepsisters&#39; mistreatment of her by pecking their eyes out!





 1  Lack Of Familial Support 
An Important Lesson For Kids That&#39;s Lacking


 







Recent Disney princess films make up for this, but many of the Disney princesses have tragic upbringings. The trope of deceased or singular parental units isn&#39;t uncommon in Disney films, but it&#39;s a factor that isn&#39;t best in hindsight. Much of the support in these films is done by a side character, likely an animal. Having the princesses&#39; families be strong and supportive is something that would benefit young audiences. In addition, they can act as the protagonists&#39; motivation rather than a love interest. For example, Moana is very close to her family and friends on the island and she uses these connections to carry her to the end goal.
