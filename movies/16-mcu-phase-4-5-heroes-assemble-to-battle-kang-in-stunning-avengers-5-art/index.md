## Literature Review

New MCU fan art depicts a huge team of multiversal heroes battling Kang the Conqueror in Phase 6&#39;s Avengers 5, despite rumors Kang could be recast.




16 powerful MCU heroes join forces in a stunning fan-made poster for Marvel Studios&#39; Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, coming together to battle Multiverse Saga villain Kang the Conqueror. After the defeat of the Mad Titan Thanos in Avengers: Endgame and the conclusion of the MCU&#39;s Infinity Saga, the status of the Avengers team has been left uncertain. Marvel Studios has introduced several new candidates to join the MCU&#39;s Avengers, and the team are expected to come together in 2026&#39;s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty to battle Kang the Conqueror, though after recent revelations and controversies, there is widespread speculation that the focus of the upcoming Phase 6 project could be changing.




Since Kang the Conqueror may be recast for the remainder of the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga, a new fan-made poster for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty shared by ANTIZZ avoids focusing on the supervillain&#39;s face. Instead, Kang faces a huge group of 16 major multiversal superheroes, including the likes of Doctor Strange, Wolverine, Thor, Moon Knight, the Fantastic Four and Daredevil.


 

Doctor Strange is front-and-center, which is appropriate as Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s Master of the Mystic Arts is perhaps the most central figure in the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga. Kang the Conqueror&#39;s future, however, is less clear, as Marvel Studios hasn&#39;t made any official comment on what the future holds for the terrifying foe.

  2:00                       Jonathan Majors Breaks Silence On Losing MCU Kang Role   Marvel Studios parted ways with Jonathan Majors after his assault and harassment conviction, and he&#39;s now spoken publicly for the first time since.   





 Will Kang The Conqueror Be Recast In The MCUâ€™s Phase 6? 
         

Jonathan Majors first appeared as a variant of Kang the Conqueror in the season 1 finale of Loki on Disney&#43;, and went on to portray Kang the Conqueror himself in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Victor Timely in Loki season 2. While he was billed as the primary villain of the Multiverse Saga, Kang the Conqueror&#39;s future was thrown into jeopardy following Jonathan Majors&#39; arrest and assault allegations in March 2023. Marvel Studios declined to comment on Majors&#39; MCU future until a definite verdict had been cast, which came in December 2023 when Majors was convicted on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault.

Jonathan Majors&#39; conviction led to him being fired by Marvel Studios, which spurred rumors that Kang the Conqueror would be recast. Popular names such as Denzel Washington, John Boyega and Colman Domingo have been suggested to take over the role, though nothing has yet been officially confirmed. There is also speculation that Kang the Conqueror&#39;s MCU storyline will be dropped altogether, especially after director Destin Daniel Cretton and writer Jeff Loveness departed production of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty. The concept of the multiverse means it may be easy for Marvel Studios to recast Kang the Conqueror, but only time will tell what the future holds for the powerful villain.
