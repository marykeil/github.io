## Literature Review

Because Warner Bros and Tim Burton have remained tight-lipped about the plot and characters in Beetlejuice 2, theories have developed about the film.




Ever since the announcement of Beetlejuice 2, multiple theories have developed about the characters and the plot based on available information and set photos. In 1988, Warner Bros. released the cult classic horror-comedy Beetlejuice, directed by Tim Burton. The movie follows a couple named Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) who die and start haunting their previous home where Charles (Jeffrey Jones), Delia (Catherine O&#39;Hara), and Lydia Deetz (Winona Ryder) move. Eventually, Barbara and Adam enlist a &#34;bio-exorcist&#34; poltergeist called Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) – aka The Ghost With The Most – to get the family out.
After the success of the first movie, rumors swirled for years about a sequel. The cast and crew wanted it to happen from the start, but it stalled in development hell. Beetlejuice 2 was officially confirmed in February 2022 through Deadline. At 2023 CinemaCon, Warner Bros. shared that filming had begun and would release in 2024. The production team has remained tight-lipped about the plot and characters in Beetlejuice 2. As such, theories have developed about the film based on the few details available.

 8  Jenna Ortega&#39;s Character Marries The Son Of Willem Dafoe&#39;s Character 
The Role Filipe Cates Could Play in Beetlejuice 2


Actor Jenna Ortega is set to appear in Beetlejuice 2 as Lydia Deetz’s daughter. Considering the production team hasn’t even shared Ortega’s character’s name, it’s unsurprising that nothing’s known about the character’s personality or storyline. The only hints have come from set photos in which Ortega’s wearing a wedding dress and veil. Based on the photos available, Ortega’s character may marry Filipe Cates’ character. Due to the style of his hair and facial shape, he looks eerily similar to another actor confirmed for the movie – Willem Dafoe. Cates may play the son of Dafoe’s character, though that is speculation as of the time of writing.





 7  Justin Theroux Plays Lydia&#39;s Husband (&amp; Dies Early In Beetlejuice 2) 
One Option For The Death Of A Parent
        

Beetlejuice 2 includes multiple new cast members including Justin Theroux. While nothing is known about his character, he’s about the same age as actor Winona Ryder, making him a prime option for Lydia’s current or former romantic partner. This would provide a father for Jenna Ortega’s character. If this is true, it’s also possible he’ll play an important role in the movie’s plot.
Set photos of a graveyard imply that a character may die in Beetlejuice 2, also explaining how the poltergeist Beetlejuice becomes involved in the plot. While it’s unclear whether Lydia’s mom is alive in the original Beetlejuice, her mom’s death provides the catalyst for the story in the Broadway production Beetlejuice: The Musical. If they follow that trend, a parent’s death may also play the same role in Beetlejuice 2. One of the most likely options is Ortega’s character’s dad.





 6  Charles Deetz Dies At the Start of Beetlejuice 2 
A Second Option For The Death Of A Parent
        

When the director spoke about his motivation for making this sequel, Tim Burton stoked a popular Beetlejuice 2 theory about Charles Deetz. Tim Burton revealed the Beetlejuice questions that made him want to make the sequel like what happened to each member of the Deetz family after the events of the original movie. According to casting announcements, two members of the Deetz family – Lydia and Delia – will appear in Beetlejuice 2. No information has confirmed or denied whether Charles Deetz will also appear in the movie.
Burton’s statements combined with the casting information hints that Charles Deetz might die right before the film or at the start. This aligns with the fact that set photos of a graveyard hint at a death in the movie. It also matches up with the family-centric storyline in Beetlejuice 2 teased by cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos.





 5  Charles &amp; Delia Deetz Divorced &amp; She Got The Iconic Beetlejuice House 
Why The Maitland House Looks Nicer In Beetlejuice 2
        

Beetlejuice 2 will involve the Maitland House if the set photos can be believed. The images show it looks freshly painted, slightly refurbished, and in better condition than the original movie. Since Delia focuses on renovating and updating the house in Beetlejuice, she is likely responsible for the appearance of the house in the sequel. This aligns with the cast announcement which confirms Delia’s return. However, cast lists haven’t confirmed Charles for Beetlejuice 2. If he isn’t dead, there’s a possibility that Charles and Delia divorced with the latter getting the Maitland house.





 4  At Least One Non-Beetlejuice Burtonverse Character Will Appear In Beetlejuice 2 
How Beetlejuice 2 Could Play Into The Connected Burtonverse Theory


 







At the time of Beetlejuice, Tim Burton had only been directing in Hollywood for around five years. Since then, Burton has been constantly working, directing 40 and producing 25 TV shows and movies. Within the vast “Burtonverse,” there’s a theory that all original Tim Burton movies exist within the same universe with similar characters appearing across multiple projects (e.g. Victor Van Dort and Victor Frankenstein). If Burton decides to continue with this trend, at least one non-Beetlejuice character from the Burtonverse will appear in Beetlejuice 2.





 3  Adam &amp; Barbara’s Death Is Revealed As A Murder 
An Unresolved Beetlejuice Theory That Could Appear In The Sequel
        

One of the most popular theories from the original Beetlejuice is the idea that Adam and Barbara were murdered by the relator Jane. After refusing to sell their house multiple times, Jane seems disgruntled. She leaves right before the Maitlands. The theory proposes that she cut the brakes on their car, so they couldn’t stop themselves from going off the bridge. It also explains why they would become ghosts, since unfinished business and foul play cause souls not to move on.
This theory could play a role in Beetlejuice 2, catering to the dedicated fanbase. The movie announcements haven’t confirmed Adam and Barbara as returning characters, but they could address this theory in many other ways without bringing back the original pair. It could be mentioned in the dialogue, or Jane could show up again asking to sell the Maitland house.





 2  Beetlejuice Goes to Hawaiʻi in Beetlejuice 2 
Beetlejuice 2&#39;s Possible Nod To The Original Concept
        

Everything about Beetlejuice 2 indicates it will take place at the Maitland house again. Set photos have confirmed that a renovated version of the house will eventually appear in the movie. This saves viewers from the awful Tim Burton Beetlejuice sequel idea, which includes the Deetzes accidentally building a vacation resort in Hawaiʻi on top of an ancient burial ground which brings Beetlejuice into the story.
Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian – the original sequel – would’ve been both problematic and unbearably kitschy. The new sequel will undoubtedly fare much better. However, there’s still a possibility that Beetlejuice 2 could include a nod to the original idea. Beetlejuice could dream of surfing in Hawaiʻi, or he could go to a neitherworld tropical resort. This would offer a lighthearted moment in the horror-comedy movie.





 1  Beetlejuice Is Still Stuck In the Neitherworld Waiting Room 
A Long Wait For Help In The Neitherworld


 







At the end of Beetlejuice, the Ghost With The Most gets eaten by a sandworm, landing him back in the neitherworld waiting room. His number is nine trillion, nine hundred ninety-eight billion, three hundred eighty-three million, seven hundred fifty thousand. When he looks up, they are calling number three, meaning the ghost with the most will be stuck there for a long time. It seems completely possible that Beetlejuice is still stuck in the waiting room three and a half decades later when Beetlejuice 2 takes place. The screenwriters could make this even funnier by having them call his number right when he gets summoned by a character in the sequel.
