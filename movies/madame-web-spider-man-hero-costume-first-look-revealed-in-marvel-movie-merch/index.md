## Literature Review

Dakota Johnson&#39;s Cassandra Webb finally gets her own Spider-Man-inspired costume as Madame Web, as new Marvel merch gives a first look at it.




New Marvel marketing for Sony&#39;s upcoming Madame Web movie, starring Dakota Johnson, reveals Spider-Man character Cassandra Webb&#39;s superhero suit. This year will be the biggest yet for Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe as they have not one, but three installments coming up this year. The first 2024 movie for the franchise will be Madame Web, featuring Johnson as the titular heroine.




While the first Madame Web trailer revealed the suits for the other Spider-heroines, Sony has been limited in showing Johnson&#39;s suit. With almost a month left to go before Madame Web releases in theaters, Johnson&#39;s costume has finally been revealed, as shared by @SpiderMan_Newz.


 

Featured on Ocean Spray bottles, Johnson&#39;s Madame Web suit is pulled directly from the comics, with some modern upgrades to it. In addition, a more detailed look was shared through the Short Hand Stores website, which can be found below:

          




                  Madame Web Movie Cast &amp; Marvel Character Guide   Madame Web, which is part of Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe, features a star-studded ensemble cast filled with famous actors in surprising Marvel roles.   


 How Madame Web&#39;s Costume Compares To Other Spider-Man Suits 
         

One of the key elements of Madame Web that makes the film stand out from Sony&#39;s previous Spider-Man live-action movies is the exploration of some of the female Spider-heroes who exist in the large Marvel universe. Because they are not Peter Parker, someone like Cassandra has a very different design altogether. One of the things that makes Madame Web&#39;s suit different from the previous Spider-Man suits is that she has a full red bodysuit, with no addition of blue whatsoever.

Madame Web&#39;s spider-theme texture is also vastly different from the other Spider-Man live-action costumes. While all three versions of Peter have a web-texture, Cassandra&#39;s suit has two spider-web-layers, one that is black and a white one that goes around the first one. Cassandra&#39;s costume also has a full spider-web in the middle, with her logo right in it. Right now, the only thing missing from her full costume is Madame Web&#39;s eyes being covered because she is known to be blind in the comics.




              Madame Web      Release Date    February 14, 2024     Director    S.J. Clarkson     Cast    Dakota Johnson , Emma Roberts , Adam Scott , Isabela Merced , Sydney Sweeney     Writers    Burk Sharpless , Matt Sazama , Kerem Sanga      

It will be exciting to see how Madame Web introduces the costume as part of the story, since Cassandra is still coming to terms with her new powers as seen in the trailer. With this being Cassandra&#39;s live-action debut, time will tell how the creative team changed her origin story. Hopefully, at least one more Madame Web trailer is on its way before the movie arrives in theaters in February.
