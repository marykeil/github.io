# Denzel Washington s Highest Paying Role Is For One Of His Worst Movies


## SUMMARY 


 

Denzel Washington&#39;s highest paying role was in the movie The Little Things, for which he was paid $40 million, double his usual salary.


Despite being his most lucrative role, The Little Things received negative reviews and is among the lowest-rated films in Denzel Washington&#39;s career.


Washington&#39;s salary increase for The Little Things was a result of the movie&#39;s change in release strategy due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted its box office performance.
