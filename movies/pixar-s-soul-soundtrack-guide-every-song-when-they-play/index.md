## Literature Review

Pixar&#39;s film, which rereleased in theaters in 2024, is a celebration of Jazz. Here&#39;s a guide to all the songs from the movie.




With a premise centered on the inspirational power of music, it makes perfect sense that the soundtrack for Soul is a celebration of jazz. The 2020 Pixar film, which received a theatrical release in 2024, features plenty of classic tunes of the genre to bolster Joe Gardner&#39;s passion for music. Whether jazz standards, jazz rap, or other styles altogether, the soundtrack assembles a formidable collection of music to underscore a heartfelt Pixar story.




Since Soul protagonist Joe Gardner is so passionate about music, the vibrant jazz culture of New York City makes a prominent appearance, underscoring the film. The music team Pixar assembled features some all-star talent: Jon Batiste (of The Late Show fame) worked to compose songs that paired with a score from veteran film composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (The Social Network, Mank), and The Roots&#39; Questlove served as a music consultant on top of his voice role. The soundtrack for Soul features many established jazz tunes, along with a few tracks recorded exclusively for the Pixar film.

 When Every Song On The Soul Soundtrack Plays In The Movie 
          

&#34;Things Ain&#39;t What They Used to Be&#34; by Mercer Ellington - This is the song being played by Mr. Gardner&#39;s middle-school band at the start of Soul. However, Mercer Ellington&#39;s piece is a little hard to recognize, considering how badly the young musicians are playing it.

&#34;We Get Along&#34; by Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings - As Joe visits his mom in her shop, this 2014 number quietly plays on the radio in the background, demonstrating Mrs. Gardner&#39;s subtle love for jazz.

&#34;II B.S.&#34; by Charles Mingus - The catchy, energetic bassline of this 1963 number is Joe Gardner&#39;s phone ringtone, which goes off when Curly calls to ask Joe to come play with Dorothea Williams.

&#34;Rappin Ced&#34; by Daveed Diggs - Performed by Daveed Diggs (Hamilton) exclusively for Soul, this song is played when Joe and 22 look at an exhibit of Joe&#39;s hip-hop days in his &#34;Hall of You&#34; at the You Seminar.




&#34;Subterranean Homesick Blues&#34; by Bob Dylan - While Joe and 22 are in The Zone, this song plays as Moonwind appears on his ship. This makes a good deal of sense, considering the character&#39;s hippy aesthetic.

&#34;Check the Rhime&#34; by A Tribe Called Quest - This song sets the mood for New York City as 22 experiences the world from Joe&#39;s body (much to Joe&#39;s frustration).

&#34;Body and Soul&#34; by Johnny Green - The classic, soulful jazz piece that plays softly in the background as Joe and 22 again walk the streets of New York after they visit the barbershop.

&#34;Parting Ways&#34; by Cody ChesnuTT - Explicitly written for Soul, &#34;Parting Ways&#34; is the song played by the busker in the subway (which 22 rewards with part of a bagel).

&#34;Apple Tree&#34; by Erykah Badu - When Joe and 22 return to Mrs. Gardner&#39;s shop, this song is quietly playing on the radio (and makes for the perfect backing number to 22&#39;s big kiss with Malba).

&#34;Space Maker&#34; by Walter Norris - A piano piece of just Joe&#39;s flavor, this song plays as Mrs. Gardner and her employees fix up Mr. Gardner&#39;s old suit for Joe&#39;s gig.




&#34;Cristo Redentor&#34; by Duke Pearson - The introductory vocalizations of this song play as Joe makes his way toward the entrance to the Great Beyond.

&#34;It&#39;s All Right&#34; by Curtis Mayfield - After Joe steps back through the doorway to his life, this song starts up, carrying Pixar&#39;s Soul into the ending credits.
