## Literature Review

The release window for the infamous R-rated Rebel Moon director&#39;s cut is revealed by Zack Snyder, after the first film fared poorly among critics.




Director Zack Snyder confirms the release window for the director’s cut of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. Netflix released Snyder’s Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire back in December, which was met with negative reviews but was still popular on streaming. Its sequel, Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver is set for release on April 19.




Speaking with The Playlist, Snyder seems to reveal the release window for the director’s cut of Rebel Moon. Snyder said that this cut would come “later on,” suggesting a summer release window. He describes the director’s cut as “what [he originally] pitched them.” Check out the full quote from Snyder below:


And so that’s going to be later on. In the summer, you’ll get to see what I [originally] pitched them basically. And then you’ll get to pretend to be the studio executive and go, ‘Oh geez, I see what they mean. So that’s the full odyssey.



 Can Zack Snyder’s Director’s Cut Save Rebel Moon? 
          

While numerous directors have released their own cuts of films over the years, Snyder has become infamous for his director’s cuts in recent years. Perhaps the most notable example was Zack Snyder’s Justice League, a four-hour recut of the 2017 version of Justice League that Snyder released in 2021. This tendency is one of the more controversial of the director’s habits, for some find it self-indulgent, while others respect Snyder’s ambition.




                  10 Rebel Moon Theories That Change Zack Snyder&#39;s Sci-Fi Movie &amp; Set Up Part 2   Several prominent Rebel Moon fan theories might change the way viewers might see Zack Snyder&#39;s epic, all while providing compelling setups for Part 2.   

Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child Of Fire fared incredibly poorly among critics upon its release. The film scored a mere 22% on Rotten Tomatoes, with a slightly higher audience score of 59%. Even for Snyder, whose track record among critics has been variable, this performance was startlingly poor for such a high-profile action film. Hopefully, Snyder can at least partially resuscitate this failure with the yet-to-be-released Rebel Moon sequel.

Snyder also has another chance to update the film’s quality with the R-rated director’s cut. While further violence, gore, nudity, and whatever else might have warranted the R rating may not save Rebel Moon, perhaps the fuller version can fulfill at least part of the director’s vision that was lost in Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire.
