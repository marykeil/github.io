After the immense success of the first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is expected to happen, and here are 10 ways that the sequel can be even better than the first movie. The first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie was a box office success as well as a hit with fans of the franchise, with the fanbase appreciating the amount of lore, Easter eggs, and cameos that are featured in the film. However, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s received mostly negative reviews from critics, meaning that there are several ways in which Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 can improve on its predecessor.
Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 has not yet been officially announced, but it is still expected that the sequel will happen eventually. The first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s brought the story of the video game franchise to the big screen while also adding a fresh twist to the narrative, with the film following a security guard as he starts a new job at a haunted pizzeria while attempting to provide for his younger sister. The first film left open a lot of room for expansion in a potential sequel, and Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 can be even better than the original Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s in these 10 ways.
            
 
 9 New Characters We Want In Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 
With the success of the first movie, there’s a good chance Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 will happen, bringing new characters from the games to life.












 








 10  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Introduce Even More Animatronics 


 







One of the most obvious ways that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s can improve on the first film is by introducing even more animatronics. The first film tackled many of the most popular animatronics from the series, including Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, and a few others. However, this barely scratches the surface of what the franchise has to offer. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 could introduce the toy animatronics from the second game, or the film could even introduce the animatronics from Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Sister Location. Tons of animatronics could be introduced, with the possibilities being incredibly exciting.





 9  The First FNAF Movie Already Handled All Of The Setup 
        

One of the biggest problems with the first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie was that it required a lot of setup, with the pacing getting bogged down by all of the groundwork that the film had to lay in the first half. Luckily, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 won&#39;t have to worry about this, as the first film already set up the world, the restaurant, the characters, and how the animatronics work. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 will simply have to introduce some new animatronics and maybe a new restaurant and the film will be good to go.





 8  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Pull From The FNAF Sequels 
        

The first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movies is based on the entire video game franchise, but it is heavily inspired by the first game, with most of the characters, locations, and story beats being pulled from the one that started it all. This makes sense, as the first game is the most popular. However, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 will no longer be confined to just the first game, as it can use the second movie to pull from the various video game sequels, allowing for a more dynamic film.





 7  The William Afton Twist Won&#39;t Have To Be Done Again In FNAF 2 
        

Another big benefit of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is that the sequel won&#39;t have to do the William Afton twist again. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s William Afton twist revealed that Raglan, the guy who hooked Mike up with the security guard, was actually the franchise&#39;s main villain. The end of the film sets Afton up as a recurring villain, meaning that while the first movie didn&#39;t have a main villain for most of the story, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 can have an antagonist from the very beginning.





 6  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Spend More Time With The Animatronics 
        

The iconic animatronics don&#39;t actually get all that much screentime in the first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, with large portions of the film being spent outside the restaurant. However, since Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s got most of the setup out of the way, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 can spend more time in the restaurant with the animatronics. While Mike is the main character, the animatronics are really the stars of the show, and they can finally have a greater spotlight in the sequel.

Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is the next installment in the FNaF live-action movie franchise, although exactly what to expect remains mysterious.








 5  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Expand Beyond The Games&#39; Storylines 
        

Another big benefit of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is that the sequel can finally expand beyond the storyline of the video games. For the first movie, it made sense to stick to the games pretty faithfully, as that is what fans want to see. Now that the first film has told the story of the games, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 can move on to something more original.





 4  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Can Show Off More Restaurants 
        

The Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s video game series doesn&#39;t take place at just one restaurant, as a variety of locations are shown throughout the series. The restaurant seen in the first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie is very clearly based on the location seen in the first game. However, the sequel can show off a new location based on another one of the sequels or spinoff games, or it could even introduce an entirely original restaurant.





 3  FNAF 2 Can Move Away From The First Movie&#39;s Overreliance On Lore 


 







One of the biggest criticisms of the first Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie was that it got really bogged down in lore, with the constant scenes of exposition taking away from the film&#39;s main story. Luckily, the lore has all been established, meaning that the sequel doesn&#39;t have to worry about explaining as many details about animatronics or ghost children.





 2  Even More Cameos Can Appear In Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 
        

Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s had a lot of cameos, with the film featuring several major internet stars that are heavily associated with the game. However, some notable ones were missing, with the absence of the YouTuber Markiplier being something that upset a lot of fans. Luckily, a Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s sequel means that there will be room for even more cameos, giving the film a chance to bring in more celebrities who have popularized the games in the past.





 1  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Won&#39;t Have The First Movie&#39;s Script Problems 
        

The Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie notoriously had a rough time in development, with it being stuck in development hell and going through all kinds of different rewrites. Luckily, now that the first film is out, the studio will most likely want a far quicker turnaround time for the sequel. Because of this, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 will probably have a much tighter script that doesn&#39;t go through nearly a decade of rewrites, meaning that it may not have the problems seen in the first movie.
