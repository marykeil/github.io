## Literature Review

Jean-Claude Van Damme has popularized some incredible martial arts moves over his many films, the best of which being flashy, evasive, and powerful.




Jean-Claude Van Damme has put some truly iconic martial arts moves on the big screen over the years, with an impressive number of iconic forms being wholly associated with him alone. One of the most celebrated figures in Hollywood martial arts, Jean-Claude Van Damme&#39;s run of films in the 80s and 90s left no stone unturned in taking advantage of his athleticism, agility, and trademark flexibility. While his fighting style may not have the most basis in reality compared to other Kung-Fu stars, it&#39;s impossible to dismiss the flashy spectacle and genuine talent of his moves.
It says a lot that Van Damme has an impressive enough body of choreography work to inspire an entire flagship video game character who&#39;s fighting style and personality is based on him alone, the Mortal Kombat series&#39; Johnny Cage. Even though Van Damme had passed on playing Johnny Cage in the original Mortal Kombat movie, it says a lot that his martial arts arsenal is varied enough to be the basis for a complex fighting game character. Over the years, Van Damme&#39;s repertoire of jaw-dropping techniques has left little off the table.









 








 10  The Leg Sweep 
Hard Target (1993)
        

The bane of every fighting game player&#39;s life, the low kick is a necessary, if not particularly flashy, essential in any martial arts master&#39;s tool kit. But Jean-Claude Van Damme&#39;s leg sweep in Hard Target makes the move look downright graceful, evading an opponent&#39;s telegraphed roundhouse kick while simultaneously firing back, knocking his helpless assailant to the concrete. True to the film&#39;s name, Van Damme is a hard target to hit, expertly combining evasion with counterattacks to frustrate his opponents to no end.





 9  The Triple Roundhouse 
Cyborg (1989)
        

The roundhouse kick is a crucial component of Jean-Claude Van Damme&#39;s fighting style, emphasizing power and jaw-dropping spectacle over anything else. Yet in Cyborg, Van Damme proves he&#39;s able to consistently output powerful roundhouse kicks in a quick succession, with alarming speed and accuracy. Van Damme has proven time and time again that he can not only output some beautiful kicks, but keep them coming. Unfortunately, there&#39;s something to be said about the slowness and lack of defense an opponent needs to display in a fight for all three kicks to land, limiting the move&#39;s viability against tougher enemies.





 8  The Flying Kick 
Death Warrant (1990)
        

In Death Warrant, Van Damme faces one of his most vicious opponents yet, a serial killer called the Sandman. In the final face off between the vengeful Van Damme and the deranged killer, he manages to land the killing blow with a textbook flying dragon kick that sends the villain tumbling into an open inferno, leaving him to die a painful death. While this attack stands out for its lethality, it&#39;s hard to ignore the higher mileage Bruce Lee got out of the move, the flying sidekick being overshadowed by some of Van Damme&#39;s more original techniques.





 7  The Hanging Kick 
Double Impact (1991)
        

Always one to use the environment to his advantage as much as possible, one creative technique Van Damme often repeated was to hang by his hands from a ceiling or rafter before kicking with both legs, utilizing the strength of two kicks at once. The best example of this is in Double Impact, in which Van Damme as Alex Wagner manages to use the technique to kick two goons off of a boat at the same time. The effect is so powerful that a third opponent is scared witless by the display, agreeing to take a dive on his own volition after Alex simply grunts and gestures to the water.





 6  The Vertical Hop Kick 
Sudden Death (1995)
        

While having a handhold to hang from is nice, Van Damme has also proven that he doesn&#39;t need the assistance of the environment to kick with both legs at once, utilizing his signature hop kick to overwhelm his foes. By using his impressive vertical leap and touching his toes, Van Damme uses this drop-kick to devastating effect. In Sudden Death, he manages to land this move on, of all things, a terrorist disguised as Iceburgh, the mascot for the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team, making for an unforgettable fight scene.





 5  The Devestating Kick Combo 
No Retreat, No Surrender (1985)
        

Once again, Jean-Claude Van Damme has demonstrated the ability to unleash a frighteningly fast torrent of kicks, staying upright on a single leg while the other gets to work barraging his opponent. In an often-overlooked film earlier on in his career, No Retreat, No Surrender, he makes the best use of this technique, catching his opponent&#39;s own kick in his hands while unleashing the machine gun of blows to their head, before finishing them off with his signature helicopter kick.





 4  The Flash Kick 
Street Fighter (1994)


 







Snubbing Mortal Kombat, in 1994 Van Damme instead chose to play Guile in the Street Fighter movie, managing to land the character&#39;s infamous physics-defying flash kick in the final fight against the villainous M. Bison. Essentially a backwards somersault that ends in an upwards-striking heel kick, Jean-Claude Van Damme manages to pull off the move effortlessly. Previously thought to be only the stuff of video games, while Van Damme may not have created the flash kick, his adaptation of it for the live action film looked plenty painful.





 3  The Held Kick 
Kickboxer (1989)


 







Despite the film being centered around the kick boxing art of Muay Thai, Van Damme brings his own personal flair to the competition in Kickboxer. After knocking out the previously-invincible Tong Po with a vicious-looking straight kick into a stone pillar, Van Damme&#39;s Kurt Sloane holds the final form, slowly stretching his extended leg out. At first, this looks to be simply a stylistic celebration of his victory, but Kurt turns on his heel and lashes out with his foot once again, knocking out a stunned spectator as well, taking down two men with only one foot on the ground.





 2  The Helicopter Kick 
Bloodsport (1988)


 







Truly Van Damme&#39;s breakout role, there&#39;s a reason that the final fight in Bloodsport rocketed the Belgian action star into popularity. Going up against the terrifying Chong Li in the final stage of a deadly underground tournament, Van Damme&#39;s character, Frank, has to pull out all the stops, not the least of which being his signature leaping roundhouse, the helicopter kick. Graceful, elegant, acrobatic, and powerful, there&#39;s a reason that fellow action star Scott Adkins called Van Damme&#39;s helicopter kick the &#34;gold standard&#34; of spinning kicks.





 1  The Nut Punch 
Bloodsport (1988)
        

The final battle against Chong Li in Bloodsport gave audiences not one, but two of Van Damme&#39;s greatest techniques, firmly cementing it as the single best action scene in Van Damme&#39;s filmography. Though all of his best techniques have been kicks up until this point, Frank&#39;s below-the-belt punch following the use of the splits to dodge an incoming attack is so iconic that it&#39;s also become the signature move of Johnny Cage by association. The cheap shot against poor Chong Li has cemented itself as Jean-Claude Van Damme&#39;s single best move, bursting with style, creativity, and unquestionable stopping power.
