## Literature Review

Writer-director Taika Waititi&#39;s new movie, which happens to be one of the lowest-rated of his career, sets a release date for video on demand.




One of Taika Waititi&#39;s lowest-rated movies, Next Goal Wins, sets a release date for video on demand. Based on the 2014 documentary of the same name, the feel-good sports flick follows the true story of the down-on-his-luck, maverick coach Thomas Rongen who attempts to lead the American Samoa soccer team, one of the worst teams in the world, to qualification for the 2014 World Cup. The Next Goal Wins cast includes Michael Fassbender as Rongen alongside Oscar Kightley, Kaimana, David Fane, Rachel House, Beulah Koale, Will Arnett, and Elisabeth Moss.




Now, over a month after the Next Goal Wins release date in theaters, Waititi&#39;s sports movie is coming to digital. According to Collider, Next Goal Wins will be available January 16 on VOD and will be available to purchase on Blu-ray and DVD on February 27. As usual, the home release will include bonus features, including a short behind-the-scenes documentary detailing the making of the movie and a deleted scene of Waititi&#39;s cameo as an American Samoan priest.


 Why Is Next Goal Wins One Of Taika Waititi&#39;s Lowest-Rated Movies? 
          

Generally, Taika Waititi movies have been acclaimed by critics, including his quirky comedies Hunt for the Wilderpeople and What We Do in the Shadows, which have 97 and 96 percent ratings on Rotten Tomatoes respectively, the two highest of his career. His debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Thor: Ragnarok, was equally acclaimed by critics for its comedy, achieving a 93 percent score. From there, Waititi wrote, directed, and starred in Jojo Rabbit, which was nominated for six Academy Awards and won Best Adapted Screenplay.




                  Is Taika Waititi&#39;s New Movie His Worst? 7 Reasons Why Next Goal Wins&#39; Reviews Are So Underwhelming   The new feel-good sports comedy has received tepid reviews from critics. A strange turn for director Taika Waititi who used to be a critical darling.   

It wasn&#39;t until his MCU sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, which perhaps leaned too far into quirky comedy, that Waititi&#39;s work experienced a critical decline, with its Rotten Tomatoes rating dropping to 63 percent. Now, Next Goal Wins is one of Waititi&#39;s lowest-rated movies with a 44 percent score. Instead of a silly comedy, Next Goal Wins aims to be an inspirational sports movie, and most critics agree it misses the mark. Viewers, on the other hand, seem to be enjoying its heartwarming message anyway, evidenced by its 84 audience score.
