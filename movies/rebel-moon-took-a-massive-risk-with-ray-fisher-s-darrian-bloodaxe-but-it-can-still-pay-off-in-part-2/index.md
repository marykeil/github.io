# Rebel Moon Took A Massive Risk With Ray Fisher s Darrian Bloodaxe, But It Can Still Pay Off In Part 2


## SUMMARY 



  Killing off Ray Fisher&#39;s character, Darrian Bloodaxe, in Rebel Moon: Part 1 was a risky move that shocked and outraged fans.   Although the character&#39;s death seemed final, there is a possibility that Bloodaxe could return in Rebel Moon: Part 2, as the director has left his fate ambiguous.   Bloodaxe could potentially return through resurrection or via flashback, as the futuristic sci-fi universe of Rebel Moon allows for such possibilities.

## Literature Review
Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire took a massive risk in killing off Darrian Bloodaxe, but his death could be rectified in the upcoming sequel.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for Rebel Moon: Part 1 - A Child of FireRebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire killing off Ray Fisher&#39;s Darrian Bloodaxe was a risky move, but Zack Synder can rectify his premature death in the Rebel Moon sequel. Fisher and Synder were finally reunited on the set of Rebel Moon after unforeseen circumstances interrupted their work together on 2017&#39;s Justice League. Snyder stepped down from directing the film following a family tragedy, and in turn, Fisher and the rest of the Justice League cast were left under the guidance of replacement director Joss Wheadon, who was infamously accused of being unprofessional and abusive on set by Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and particularly, Fisher himself (via Inverse).




Fisher confirmed his refusal to reprise his Justice League role via X following the incident, but luckily went on to find an even better opportunity in Rebel Moon. Rebel Moon gave Fisher the chance to shine in another heavily anticipated blockbuster, this time, under the far more agreeable direction of his respected colleague, Snyder. Despite their noteworthy reunion, Snyder shockingly killed off Fisher&#39;s Rebel Moon character, leaving fans to wonder if Bloodaxe met his bitter end or if he will have a part in the upcoming Rebel Moon - Part 2: The Scargiver.


 Killing Off Ray Fisher&#39;s Darrian Bloodaxe In Rebel Moon Part 1 Is A Risky Move 
          

Viewer response to the death of Bloodaxe proved that Rebel Moon took a massive risk with the character&#39;s fate. In the Rebel Moon movie, Bloodaxe served as a member of the Black Mountain rebels who fought against the ruthless military regime known as the Imperium. Bloodaxe was recruited to assist in an insurgency against the Imperium by Rebel Moon&#39;s leading protagonist, Kora, and ultimately died in an attempt to stop the onslaught of a military ship.




Fisher&#39;s heroic character was well admired by Rebel Moon&#39;s audience, and the response to Bloodaxe&#39;s death was filled with shock and outrage from fans as a result. In hindsight, Rebel Moon seemingly fumbled both the chance to capitalize off of an exciting Fisher and Snyder reunion and the opportunity to make the most of Bloodaxe as a fan-favorite character. Then again, Bloodaxe&#39;s death could turn out to be an ambitious risk that will come to resolve itself in Rebel Moon - Part 2: The Scargiver, as the director already indicated that Fisher&#39;s character could return in the sequel.

According to Inverse, Snyder confirmed the death of another fallen character but would not verify the status of Fisher&#39;s Bloodaxe. While Rebel Moon&#39;s Kai was said to be &#34;definitely done,&#34; Snyder left the fate of Fisher&#39;s character ambiguous, coyly pronouncing &#34;Bloodaxe, we don&#39;t know about.&#34; Snyder&#39;s statement opens the door for Fisher&#39;s return to the franchise, especially considering that there are numerous ways Bloodaxe could return to Rebel Moon&#39;s futuristic sci-fi universe.




Bloodaxe could return by way of resurrection, as the Rebel Moon franchise has already demonstrated or alluded to instances of the phenomenon. The futuristic space technology that brought Admiral Noble back from the brink of death and the lore about Princess Issa&#39;s power of restoring life to what was once dead are both strong indicators that resurrection is entirely possible. If not resurrection or some other form of sci-fi miracle, then there is also a strong chance that Fisher&#39;s Bloodaxe could return after his Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire death via flashback or some sort of projection in his image.
