  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Paul Mescal&rsquo;s breakout performance in Normal People earned him critical acclaim and he recieved an Oscar nomination for Aftersun, showcasing his subtle and committed acting style.
Mescal&rsquo;s willingness to take risks and choose complex characters is evident in his film choices, including a sci-fi thriller, a musical retelling of Carmen, and a psychological drama.
While some of Mescal&rsquo;s films may vary in quality, his performances remain consistently interesting and committed, solidifying his status as an exciting up-and-coming actor.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Paul Mescal is one of the most exciting up and coming actors working today, this list ranks the Irish actor&rsquo;s short filmography from worst to best.</p>
<p>Paul Mescal has made a name for himself as one of the most exciting up-and-coming actors today, and, despite having only appeared in six feature films, looks set to become a household name for many years to come. With a breakout performance as Connell in the Irish BBC miniseries Normal People, Mescal has already earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role in the emotional drama Aftersun. With an acting that so far has been categorized by subtle and committed performances, at just 27 years old Mescal has already acted opposite the likes of Olivia Coleman, Saoirse Ronan, and Andrew Scott.
While Mescal will enter the world of blockbuster films in 2024, as he stars in the upcoming Ridley Scott sequel Gladiator 2, one important dimension to his career has been a willingness to take risks and a talent for choosing complex characters. Having already displayed a strong emotional range in Normal People, Mescal has cast his net wide and tackled a musical role, showcased his more villainous side, and even tried his hand at sci-fi, LGBTQ+ fantasy, and heart-wrenching drama. While the films of Mescal can vary somewhat in quality, one thing has remained consistent, and that’s his committed and interesting performances.</p>
<p>6  Foe (2023)
Paul Mescal as Junior</p>
<p>Foe</p>
<p>Release Date    November 2, 2023     Director    Garth Davis     Cast    Saoirse Ronan , Paul Mescal , Aaron Pierre     Runtime    110 Minutes</p>
<p>Foe should have been a major cinematic event as it brought together two of the most talked about Irish actors working today. However, this sci-fi thriller, starring Paul Mescal and Saoirse Ronan, did not connect with audiences and was a clunky story that retread psychological themes previously explored in much better movies. With two Oscar nominees at the helm, Mescal gave his all to a story that never fully came together. Foe played out out like a poor episode of Black Mirror, the pairing of Mescal and Ronan was a smart one and, hopefully, they can reunite in a better film, preferably one where they can keep their Irish accents.
Set in a dystopian American future, Mescal played Junior and Ronan was his wife Hen whose lives were turned upside down when a stranger arrived at their farm and told them Junior must go to space as part of a program to save humanity. In essence, Foe was a marriage drama about human behavior, and its two stars gave committed and layered performances that were unfortunately let down by stilted dialogue and a bare-bones plot that never gets off the ground. An unfortunate misstep for both Mescal and Ronan, Foe was a film rife with wasted potential on all fronts.</p>
<p>5  Carmen (2022)
Paul Mescal as Aidan</p>
<p>Carmen (2022)</p>
<p>Release Date    September 11, 2022     Director    Benjamin Millepied     Cast    Melissa Barrera , Paul Mescal , Rossy de Palma , Elsa Pataky     Runtime    116 Minutes</p>
<p>In a musical retelling of the Georges Bizet opera Carmen, Paul Mescal showed his willingness to select roles that, although they may not reach a large audience, have serious artistic integrity. The directional debut of French dancer Benjamin Millepied, Carmen ignored much of the plot and setting of the opera and reimagined the story in the Mexican desert. Using music and dance to express intense internal emotion, Carman showcased Mescal’s musical ability as he played guitar and sang a beautiful heartfelt ballad in this unusual film.
Telling the story of the titular Carmen fleeing to Los Angeles with Mescal as Aidan, Mescal’s performance was both tough and romantic as he showcased his ability to subtly portray heartbreak while also breaking out in emotion through interruptive dance. Carman was an ambitious and unique film that walked a fine line between performance art and narrative feature, and in the process, unfortunately, does not excel at either. Carman was a film never meant for a mainstream audience and one of the most interesting things about it is that it signaled Mescal’s acting future as one filled with unpredictable roles and artistic risks.</p>
<p>4  The Lost Daughter (2021)
Paul Mescal as Will</p>
<p>The Lost Daughter</p>
<p>Release Date    December 17, 2021     Director    Maggie Gyllenhaal     Cast    Peter Sarsgaard , Alba Rohrwacher , Ellie Blake , Paul Mescal , Jack Farthing , Robyn Elwell , Dakota Johnson , Oliver Jackson-Cohen , Olivia Colman , Panos Koronis , Ed Harris , Jessie Buckley , Dagmara Dominczyk , Athena Martin     Runtime    121 minutes</p>
<p>Paul Mescal played a supporting role in Maggie Gyllenhaal’s directional debut The Lost Daughter. Featuring an incredible lead performance by Olvia Coleman as Leda Caruso, a woman with a dark past on a beach vacation in Greece, The Lost Daughter was a probing, psychological, character study that mixed obsession and eroticism with pain and heartbreak. A subtle drama with consistent suspense throughout, The Lost Daughter had a lot to say about abandonment, escapism, and parenthood and used flashbacks to flesh out the troubled backstory of its lead character.
The Lost Daughter was the feature debut of Mescal and after having already demonstrated his skills as a leading man in the television series Normal People, here he showcased he is just as effective in a supporting role. Mescal played Will, a young man working at the Greek beach house, who was having an affair with a married woman and saw the unhappiness and vulnerability of Leda. While Mescal’s part in The Lost Daughter may be a minor one, Mescal brought a level of intensity and insightfulness to the role that made it a memorable and mature performance.</p>
<p>3  God’s Creatures (2022)
Paul Mescal as Brian O’Hara</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s Creatures</p>
<p>Release Date    September 30, 2022     Director    Saela Davis , Anna Rose Holmer     Cast    Emily Watson , Paul Mescal , Aisling Franciosi , Declan Conlon , Toni O&rsquo;Rourke , Marion O&rsquo;Dwyer , Brendan McCormack , Lalor Roddy     Runtime    94 minutes</p>
<p>As Brian O’Hara in God’s Creatures, Paul Mescal demonstrated his ability to tap into the darker side of a person’s psychology while playing a character that gets progressively more unlikable and sinister throughout the film. A painful psychological drama, God’s Creatures tested the limits of a mother’s love as she betrayed the connections in her community to cover up the misdeeds of her previously estranged son. With strong lead performances from both Mescal and Emily Watson, God’s Creatures was an intense and unsettling gothic tale that took its time toward its harrowing conclusion.
Set in a remote Irish seaside village, Mescal’s character hints at a dark past when he returns to the community he grew up in after years of unexplained absence in Australia. After being accused of rape by his teenage girlfriend, in a panic, when questioned by police, Brian’s mother acted as his alibi in a moment of deceit that slowly built toward her realization that her son was morally bankrupt. God’s Creature was a dark story of betrayal, community, and loss, that acted as a perfect vehicle for Mescal to demonstrate his skill at portraying a distasteful and unethical character.</p>
<p>2  All Of Us Strangers (2023)
Paul Mescal as Harry</p>
<p>All of Us Strangers</p>
<p>Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    Andrew Haigh     Cast    Andrew Scott , Paul Mescal , Jamie Bell , Claire Foy     Runtime    105 Minutes</p>
<p>All of Us Strangers was a thoughtful and moving LGBTQ+ fantasy that brought together themes of grief, loneliness, and love in a story that saw Adam, played by Andrew Scott, encountering his parents, who died when he was a child, alive and well. Paul Mescal played the mysterious neighbor Harry and a romance between the two, categorized by both of their lonely nature, developed. However, while this was occurring Adam was also preoccupied with the memories of his late mother and father whom he continued to visit in his childhood home.
All of Us Strangers explored queer identity and the complex emotional pain that stemmed from childhood grief and the things left unsaid. Scott and Mescal also displayed strong onscreen chemistry that was seen in the gentle looks and smiles that signified a growing romantic attachment. At its core, All of Us Strangers was a story of acceptance about the literal loss of Adam’s parents, but also representative of accepting identities and living life without shame or pain. All of Us Strangers was a sophisticated representation of same-sex romance and should stand alongside other mature LGBTQ+ films such as Love Is Strange, Carol, and Portrait of a Lady on Fire.</p>
<p>1  Aftersun (2022)
Paul Mescal as Calum Paterson</p>
<p>Aftersun</p>
<p>Release Date    November 18, 2022     Director    Charlotte Wells     Cast    Paul Mescal , Frankie Corio , Celia Rowlson-Hall , Sally Messham     Runtime    96 minutes</p>
<p>Paul Mescal was rightly nominated for Best Actor at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of Calum Paterson in Charlotte Wells directional debut Aftersun. A haunting and melancholy coming-of-age story about a then 11-year-old daughter reflecting on the holiday she took with her 30-year-old father 20 years earlier, Aftersun melded memory with reminiscence as the now-adult child tried to reconcile the parent she only ever knew through a much younger lens. Aftersun explored themes of depression, loss, and memory, and the power of Mescal’s performance was in its subtly and the slow, calculated, way he portrayed a man struggling to go on.
The effectiveness of Aftersun was just as much about what was left unsaid, and Mescal’s performance took full advantage of his masterful use of subtlety and ability to express suppressed emotional pain. An autobiographical story for the director, the emotional heft of the father and daughter relationship in Aftersun felt real and gut wrenchingly painful to such a level that this takes its place as Mescal’s greatest performance to date. While Paul Mescal did not collect the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance, the sheer power with which he portrayed this role means It will only be a matter of time before he takes home that award.</p>
