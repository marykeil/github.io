## Literature Review

The Walking Dead star Steven Yeun, who was set to play Sentry in the Thunderbolts movie, opens up on why he exited the Marvel Cinematic Universe film.




Following his Marvel Cinematic Universe departure, Steven Yeun breaks his silence on why he is no longer starring in the Thunderbolts movie. While there are only a few Marvel movies being released in 2024, one of the most anticipated MCU films is set to shoot later this year, as Thunderbolts promises to build a whole new team of anti-heroes for the MCU. Set to be Marvel Studios&#39; own version of the Suicide Squad, one of the most-discussed aspects of Thunderbolts was the casting of Yeun as Sentry, only for it to be reported in early 2024 that the actor had left the project.




In a new interview with Variety, Yeun confirmed his Thunderbolts exit, while also detailing why he had to step away from the MCU gig. Fortunately, this statement suggests the matter wasn&#39;t related to creative differences but a matter of scheduling issues and problems created by the film&#39;s delays, given that the Thunderbolts movie was one of the Hollywood projects that got pushed by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes. While Yeun is out of Thunderbolts, he is still hopeful to do an MCU movie down the line, sharing the following:


I think for me, time passing and things shifting kind of pulled me out of it. But Jake [Schreier], I know, is going to do an incredible job. I wanna do a Marvel movie... It took a lot of drafts on email to make sure that I conveyed the sincerity of how sorry I was to have to back out... I think it’s too early to say that [when asked what Marvel movie he would want to do in the future] I probably pissed off too many people leaving, so I’m just gonna say, ‘Thank you for having me.&#39; I have some ideas. But I heard if you put it out there, you’ll never get it, so I’ll keep it close to my chest.





                  Thunderbolts Cast &amp; Marvel Character Guide   Several MCU characters return for Phase 5&#39;s Thunderbolts, a team of antiheroes and reformed villains attempting to follow in the Avengers&#39; footsteps.   


 What Will Happen To Steven Yeun&#39;s Role In Thunderbolts? 
         

At this point, Marvel Studios have not announced yet if they are recasting Sentry for the MCU or not. That raises the question of whether Sentry will even still be in Thunderbolts, or if they are perhaps considering replacing the character and saving him for a different MCU movie - as some have already begun to question who could replace Yeun, placing a potential new actor under further pressures. With Sentry essentially being Marvel&#39;s own version of Superman, the character could well be a major player into the franchise, meaning handling this matter delicately is likely a priority for the MCU.




However, one of the big appeals of Sentry being in Thunderbolts is the potential idea of him being the antagonist. It would also give the team a worthy opponent, as they would have to deal with someone as powerful and unstoppable as DC&#39;s Superman. Because of those elements alone, it seems very likely that Marvel Studios will simply replace Yeun with a different actor as Sentry, and go forward with the plot as it stands instead of making alterations.



In November 2023, Invincible&#39;s Robert Kirkman, who works with Yeun on the Prime Video show, let it slip that he was playing Sentry.




Marvel Studios will likely remain tight-lipped about whoever takes over playing Sentry for some time, especially since the movie is set to release in 2025. However, there&#39;s a good chance more will be revealed when Thunderbolts begins shooting, which could shed light both on this matter and more plot specifics as well. Hopefully, the latest shake-up to Thunderbolts will be dealt with sooner rather than later.
