## Literature Review
26 years after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone was published, HBO&#39;s new show has the chance to fix some problems with the Wizarding World.




It has been 26 years since J. K. Rowling&#39;s debut novel Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone was released, followed by a movie adaptation in 2001, but audiences still have questions about the Wizarding World. &#34;How does magic work?&#34; and &#34;Why is anyone poor?&#34; are common queries. In recent years, the Harry Potter series&#39; inherent problems have become more and more apparent.
HBO&#39;s upcoming Harry Potter TV show has the chance to fix some of the problems with the Wizarding World. The reboot could improve the story with a clearer magic system, a better cast, and a more nuanced wizard society. Rowling&#39;s anti-trans comments have sparked more criticism of the series in general, so HBO has a lot of work to do to make the new Harry Potter show worthwhile.









 








 10  The Wizarding World&#39;s Vague Magic System 
Why do certain Latin terms produce magic?


Close







Of the things that do not make sense about magic in Harry Potter is how spells are created and where magic comes from. The incantations of spells are Latin words, but the only reason for this is so Harry and the other characters have something interesting to say while they are performing magic. Additionally, some wizards can perform spells without saying the words, while others don&#39;t need wands at all. One classroom scene explaining how magic works in season 1, which would coincide with Sorcerer&#39;s Stone in the Harry Potter timeline, would make the magic system much stronger.





 9  One-Note Portrayal Of Slytherin 
Slytherin only has one character archetype.
        

Sorcerer&#39;s Stone immediately characterizes everyone in Slytherin as bad. Harry desperately asks the Sorting Hat not to place him in Slytherin. Most of the characters associated with Slytherin are bullies like Draco Malfoy, if not outright villains like Voldemort. Since Sorcerer&#39;s Stone was published, the Harry Potter fandom has grown to include numerous proud Slytherins. Characters who are exceptions to the Slytherin stereotype are highlighted, including Regulus Black, Horace Slughorn, and Andromeda Tonks. The Harry Potter TV show has the opportunity to develop a more nuanced vision of this Hogwarts house.

Of all the Hogwarts houses in Harry Potter, Slytherins have the worst reputation. Do they deserve it? Let&#39;s examine Slytherin traits, good and bad.









 8  The Dursleys&#39; Abuse Is Mostly Overlooked 
Child abuse is a secondary plot point in Harry Potter.
        

Harry&#39;s aunt and uncle make Harry sleep under the stairs and imprison and starve him. Yet Sorcerer&#39;s Stone frames Harry&#39;s life with the Dursleys as the miserable, mundane reality Harry escapes when Hagrid introduces him to the Wizarding World. The movie and book gloss over the fact that this is not what Harry&#39;s life should have been before Hogwarts. Additionally, the Dursleys become a secondary problem compared to the threat of Voldemort. While Dumbledore&#39;s reasons for leaving Harry with the Dursleys for years are explained later in the series, the show could still take this plot point more seriously.





 7  Stereotypes Surrounding The Goblins 
The Harry Potter Goblin controversy has been widely discussed.
        

Many people have now pointed out that the goblins who are the Wizarding World&#39;s bankers are characterized by many antisemitic stereotypes. Several major publications and news outlets, including Forbes, have published detailed articles on this issue. For the goblins to work in the Harry Potter reboot, they would need to be completely reconceptualized. The showrunners should also expand the presence of goblins in the Wizarding World beyond Gringotts, since depicting all goblins as relegated to one profession is part of the way they are stereotyped.





 6  The Wizarding World&#39;s Underdeveloped Economy 
Why are the Weasleys poor?


Close







Another issue with Harry Potter&#39;s magic system is that its limitations are not clear. Fans have pointed out that it does not make sense for the Weasley family to be poor when magic should eliminate many of their financial problems. Theoretically, there are things in the Wizarding World the Weasleys need money to buy that they cannot create out of thin air. But this is never fully explained: In Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, the Weasleys are simply introduced as the kind family mocked by the wealthy Malfoys. Additionally, while Muggle families exchanging money for Wizarding currency is referenced in the books, it is not clear how Muggle-Borns acquire school supplies in the movies.

 10 Biggest Challenges Harry Potter&#39;s TV Remake Must Overcome 
The Harry Potter TV remake has the potential of being great, but there are various factors working against it, including the franchise&#39;s popularity.









 5  The Story Revolves Around Gryffindor 
The Harry Potter fandom includes members of all the Hogwarts houses.
        

Like with Slytherin, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws (and Gryffindors) proudly declare their houses on social media forums. However, Sorcerer&#39;s Stone centers on Gryffindor characters, with a few antagonistic characters from Slytherin. Some side characters belonging to Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw are introduced in the later books and movies, but the only non-Gryffindor character who is arguably a part of the main cast is Luna Lovegood. This excludes some adult characters whose houses were confirmed outside the books and movies. The Harry Potter TV show could tell a much more complex story if the season coinciding with Sorcerer&#39;s Stone introduces and develops some characters from the other houses.





 4  Gendered Social Structure Of Witches And Wizards 
The Wizarding World is strictly binary.
        

Sorcerer&#39;s Stone introduces a gendered society where the men are wizards and the women are witches, with no gender-nonconforming characters appearing. &#34;Wizards&#34; and &#34;witches&#34; are only labels and all the characters have the same abilities. In contrast, other magic systems categorize all the characters the same way. For example, in The Owl House, they are all witches (one wizard does appear in season 1, episode 2), while in Wizards of Waverly Place, they are all wizards (witches are occasionally referenced). According to Prema Arasu (via uwa.edu.eu), the Wizarding World &#34;is deeply structured around a patriarchal gender binary,&#34; which is something else the show could change.





 3  Lack Of Diversity In The Wizarding World 
Harry Potter has been widely criticized for its primarily straight, white cast.
        

Harry Potter&#39;s few characters who are people of color are all relegated to side roles. The only Hogwarts student of color to appear in Sorcerer&#39;s Stone is Dean Thomas, with some brief references made to Parvati and Padma Patil. According to entertainment insider Jeff Sneider (via CBR), HBO is making a &#34;concerted effort&#34; to cast &#34;more people of color&#34; in the reboot.
However, it is not clear how HBO will handle Harry Potter&#39;s lack of LGBTQ&#43; characters.Dumbledore&#39;s relationship with Grindelwald is never explicitly addressed in the original series but was confirmed after its conclusion. Yet Rowling&#39;s changes to the Harry Potter canon have increasingly annoyed fans. Retconning the series to excuse a lack of diversity does not solve the problem â€“ the show just needs to have a more diverse cast.

 2  Confusing Dynamic Between Wizards And Muggles 
There are supposedly strict laws about revealing magic to Muggles.
        

The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone novel explains that the Ministry is responsible for hiding the existence of wizards from the non-magical world. Families of Muggle-born wizards and witches are an exception, although it is not clear if this applies to just their parents or their extended family. However, some wizards and witches marry Muggles. Most wizards are apparently completely unaware of non-magical technology like phones, cars, and television. Overall, it is not obvious where and how the line between the magical and non-magical worlds is drawn.





 1  Hogwarts&#39; Mistreatment &amp; Endangerment Of Children 
The Forbidden Forest is dangerous and Snape is awful.


Close







Hogwarts permits many dangerous activities, including Quidditch. Teachers also sentence 11-year-olds to detentions in the Forbidden Forest, inhabited by werewolves and man-eating spiders. Meanwhile, professors can mistreat the students as much as they like. Snape bullies his students throughout Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, particularly Harry and Neville, and the sequels show other teachers abusing their power. Hogwarts&#39; administration should be getting droves of letters from angry parents every week. The show has the opportunity to change the dynamics at Hogwarts and other problematic plot points introduced in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, or at least provide stronger justification for them.
