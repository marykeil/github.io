# Star Wars Canon Causes A Bizarre Problem For Rey &amp; Kylo Ren - One That Even Affects The Real World


## SUMMARY 



  Rey and Kylo Ren only have one meeting between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker, and it involves a battle over a Jedi holocron.   The actors who play Rey and Kylo Ren at Galaxy&#39;s Edge have to avoid each other to maintain canon, despite still being enemies at this point.   The only way to fix this issue would be for Disney to add another canon fight between the two, but it may be best for them to keep avoiding each other for the sake of consistent canon.

## Literature Review

Star Wars canon has caused a huge yet somewhat comedic problem for Rey Skywalker and Kylo Ren, and this problem is currently impacting the real world.




Star Wars canon has created a strange problem for Rey and Kylo Ren, and it impacts the real world. As an almost 50-year-old franchise, Star Wars is no stranger to retconning. It is expected that different pieces of canon media will influence and change each other. However, there is one tidbit of canon that has spilled over into the real world.




When Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge opened in 2019, it was a hit with Star Wars viewers. This is no surprise; its immersive rides and designs are impressive. Galaxy&#39;s Edge is a fun experience for any Star Wars viewer. Taking place on Batuu between Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Galaxy&#39;s Edge does its best to adhere to canon. However, this commitment to continuity has created a problem.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Rey &amp; Kylo Ren Only Have One Meeting Between The Last Jedi &amp; The Rise Of Skywalker 
          

Rey and Kylo Ren only have one meeting between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. After the Halcyon starcruiser is blockaded by the First Order for suspected Resistance activity, Captain Riyola Keevan enlists the help of Rey. When the First Order discovers Rey is aboard, Kylo Ren is sent to eliminate her. The two end up battling over a Jedi holocron created by Grandmaster Yoda. In the end, Rey is victorious and escapes with the holocron. While fans could only witness this fight as a live show at Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, a Star Wars-themed Disney World immersive experience that unfortunately closed, it is nevertheless canon.






 Rey &amp; Kylo Ren Can&#39;t Ever See Each Other At Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge 
          

It&#39;s important to remember that Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge is set between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. This creates a problem: the actors who play Rey and Kylo Ren at Galaxy&#39;s Edge have to avoid each other to maintain canon. This means they have to coordinate to ensure they aren&#39;t in the same place at the same time and must walk away if they do encounter each other. This is quite hilarious, given that Rey and Kylo Ren are still enemies at this point. It would make more sense for them to fight each other, but because of both The Rise of Skywalker and the Halycon starcruiser, they can&#39;t.

The only way to fix this issue would be for Disney to add in another canon fight between The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. Star Wars is known for jumping around in time and retconning inconvenient storylines, so it&#39;s quite possible they could add another canon battle between the two, be it through a book, comic, video game, movie, or even another show at Galaxy&#39;s Edge. However, this would feel like just another Star Wars backtrack, and, for the sake of keeping canon consistent, it&#39;s probably best that Kylo Ren and Rey keep avoiding each other.






All Star Wars movies and TV shows are available to stream on Disney&#43;.
