# 10 Recent Actor Pairings We Already Want To See More Of


## SUMMARY 


 When actors have great onscreen chemistry, it&#39;s beneficial for both the audience and the filmmakers. It can lead to successful collaborations and career moves. 
 The popularity of actor duos can be determined by trends on social media, which serves as a good indicator of what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not in the industry. 
 Collaborating with successful acting partners can capitalize on recent success or help actors recover from less successful projects, making it a wise career move.

## Literature Review

From the moment these new duos stepped on screen, it was clear that they were meant to work together and become iconic pairs for the ages. 




Whether these actors have worked together for the first time in the past few years, or are known collaborators, their onscreen chemistry makes them iconic duos that audiences love to watch work. When two actors have the chemistry to carry a film, it&#39;s not just the viewers dying to get them back together, but the filmmakers as well. More often than not, these pairs have a platonic dynamic, eschewing the romantic tension for a bond with much more longevity; comedy, and friendship.
With actors that work so well together, one collaboration is rarely enough, and working together again is often a wise career move. Collaborating would either capitalize on their recent success or pull them out of a slump of less-than-successful projects. With partnerships that have developed in recent years, it&#39;s easy to tell who&#39;s popular and who&#39;s not based on the trends on social media. While this should not sway the decisions of producers too strongly, it is a good indicator of what&#39;s working and what&#39;s not.

 10  Ayo Edebiri &amp; Rachel Sennott 
Bottoms (2023)


 







  Bottoms  


  Release Date    August 25, 2023     Director    Emma Seligman     Cast    Rachel Sennott , Ayo Edebiri , Havana Rose Liu , Kaia Gerber , Nicholas Galitzine , Dagmara Dominczyk , Marshawn Lynch     Rating    R     Runtime    92 Minutes     Genres    Comedy     Writers    Emma Seligman , Rachel Sennott     Studio(s)    Orion Pictures , Brownstone Productions    


The director-actor duo of Rachel Sennott and Emma Seligman co-wrote Bottoms and made the genius decision to cast Ayo Edebiri as Sennott&#39;s partner in crime, and the subtle protagonist of the film. Sennott and Edebiri are a hilarious pair who work off each other effortlessly. Both the actors and the director attended NYU together, and this ingrained camaraderie is clear from the comfort they have with each other. Though Edebiri and Sennott both have busy schedules and are in high demand, making time to work together again would be a treat for everyone involved.





 9  Molly Gordon &amp; Ben Platt 
Theater Camp (2023)
        

  Theater Camp  


  Release Date    January 21, 2023     Director    Molly Gordon , Nick Liberman     Cast    Molly Gordon , Ben Platt , Noah Galvin , Jimmy Tatro , Patti Harrison , Ayo Edibiri , Amy Sedaris     Runtime    94 minutes     Writers    Noah Galvin , Molly Gordon , Nick Lieberman , Ben Platt     Producer    Jessica Elbaum, Erik Feig, Will Ferrell, Noah Galvin, Molly Gordon, Ryan Heller, Nick Lieberman, Ben Platt, Maria Zuckerman     Production Company    Gloria Sanchez Productions, Picturestart, Topic Studios    


Theater Camp was an underrated cult hit in 2023, and part of the reason was the relationship between Molly Gordon and Ben Platt as the main pair of best friends. Also featuring Edebiri and Noah Galvin in a charismatic ensemble cast, the film showcased the talents of both Gordon and Platt without either of them stepping on the others&#39; toes. What makes their partnership so effective is that they are just as funny taking turns being the butt of the joke, or being ridiculous together. It would be intriguing to see how they do in a dramatic project, as they have proven they are capable of serious roles as well.





 8  Paul Mescal &amp; Andrew Scott 
All Of Us Strangers (2023)
        

  All of Us Strangers  


  Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    Andrew Haigh     Cast    Andrew Scott , Paul Mescal , Jamie Bell , Claire Foy     Rating    R     Runtime    105 Minutes     Genres    Drama , Fantasy , Romance     Writers    Andrew Haigh     Studio(s)    Film4 , TSG Entertainment , Blueprint Pictures     Distributor(s)    Searchlight Pictures    


In one of the most heartbreaking films of 2023, Andrew Scott and Paul Mescal play a pair of tragic lovers haunted by their pasts. Each actor brings something unique to their respective roles, and neither performance would be complete without the other. The tremendous empathy and understanding the characters have for each other are fully brought to life by the performances. It&#39;s clear that Scott and Mescal put lots of time into getting to know each other and establishing that intimacy so the film could feel as real as possible, and it would be a waste not to see that intimacy once again in another film that&#39;s just as beautiful.





 7  Emma Stone &amp; Mark Ruffalo 
Poor Things (2023)
        

  Poor Things  


  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Yorgos Lanthimos     Cast    Emma Stone , Willem Dafoe , Mark Ruffalo , Ramy Youssef , Jerrod Carmichael , Christopher Abbott     Rating    R     Runtime    141 Minutes     Genres    Comedy , Romance ,  Sci-Fi     Writers    Tony McNamara     Studio(s)    Film4 , TSG Entertainment , Element Pictures     Distributor(s)    Searchlight Pictures    


Poor Things is inarguably Emma Stone&#39;s movie, but the other actors do an excellent job elevating her performance, especially Mark Ruffalo. His character, Duncan, is a hilarious foil to Stone&#39;s Bella, as, although he has lived in the world longer, he is much less mature and uninterested in learning about life the way that she is. Seeing them love, hate, and annoy each other is one of the best parts of the film, and it shows how well Stone and Ruffalo can communicate within a given scene. If director Yorgos Lanthimos has another film in store for either actor, it would be wonderful for him to cast both.

 6  Zendaya &amp; Timothée Chalamet 
Dune (2021)


 







  Dune  


  Release Date    October 22, 2021     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Dave Bautista , Rebecca Ferguson , Sharon Duncan-Brewster , Jason Momoa , David Dastmalchian , Stephen McKinley Henderson , Stellan Skarsgård , Charlotte Rampling , Chang Chen , Oscar Isaac , Zendaya , Javier Bardem , Timothee Chalamet , Josh Brolin     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    155 minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Science Fiction , Drama     Writers    Frank Herbert , Eric Roth , Denis Villeneuve , Jon Spaihts     Studio(s)    Legendary Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


A continuation of this collaboration is confirmed, as Dune: Part Two will be coming later in 2024. This is a relief, as watching Dune, it&#39;s easy to wish that Zendaya and Chalamet had more time on screen together. Those short moments when they do come together are some of the most intriguing moments of the film. Some of this is due to the mystery surrounding Chani (Zendaya) and her relationship with Paul (Chalamet) and his future, but the mystery only adds to the existing success of the actors&#39; dynamic.
Two of the most popular actors of their generation, it was only a matter of time before they were cast in a film together, and it bodes well for their careers that Dune has had so much success. Due to the nature of the franchise, and the number of books in the series that the film is based on, there could be several sequels that feature the actors together again. However, outside the realm of sci-fi and fantasy, each of them has the talent to lead a quieter, dramatic film, and they would only bring out the best in each other if they worked together.





 5  Jacob Eldori &amp; Barry Keoghan 
Saltburn (2023)
        

  Saltburn  


  Release Date    November 17, 2023     Director    Emerald Fennell     Cast    Barry Keoghan , Jacob Elordi , Rosamund Pike , Richard E. Grant , Alison Oliver , Archie Madekwe , Carey Mulligan     Rating    R     Runtime    131 Minutes     Genres    Comedy , Thriller     Writers    Emerald Fennell     Studio(s)    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , MRC , LuckyChap Entertainment , Lie Still     Distributor(s)    Amazon MGM Studios    


Since its release, Saltburn has caused quite a stir among viewers, and love it or hate it, the film is certainly controversial. What isn&#39;t controversial is the fact that Jacob Elordi and Barry Keoghan became a thrilling duo that the internet can&#39;t get enough of since the making of the film. Though Keoghan&#39;s character, Oliver, doesn&#39;t have the best intentions for Elordi&#39;s Felix, the ever-shifting power dynamic and the vault of secrets each character is keeping laces each one of their scenes with pressure and intrigue. Even if the next characters they portray aren&#39;t hiding as much, Elordi and Keoghan will be able to create just as much drama.





 4  Natalie Portman &amp; Julianne Moore 
May December (2023)
        

  May December  


  Release Date    December 1, 2023     Director    Todd Haynes     Cast    Natalie Portman , Julianne Moore , Charles Melton     Rating    R     Runtime    113 Minutes     Genres    Drama , Romance     Writers    Samy Burch , Alex Mechanik     Studio(s)    Gloria Sanchez Productions , Killer Films , MountainA     Distributor(s)    Netflix    


Two seasoned and fantastic actresses, it&#39;s a shock that Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore haven&#39;t paired up many times before their work in May December. As Portman&#39;s Elizabeth interviews and shadows Moore&#39;s Gracie to play her in a film, the line between the two characters begins to blur, and the questionable, or downright disgusting, morality of each character is put on full display. It&#39;s hard to imagine a film where two actresses need to become as intertwined as in May December, but that effectively solidifies the duo as one that will keep working no matter what parts they play.





 3  Amandla Stenberg &amp; Myha’la Herrold 
Bodies Bodies Bodies (2022)
        

  Bodies Bodies Bodies  


  Release Date    August 5, 2022     Director    Halina Reijn     Cast    Pete Davidson , Maria Bakalova , Rachel Sennott , Chase Sui Wonders , Amandla Stenberg , Lee Pace , Myha’la Herrold     Rating    R     Runtime    95 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Horror , Thriller     Writers    Sarah DeLappe , Kristen Roupenian     Budget    $90 million     Studio(s)    A24    


The horror-comedy Bodies Bodies Bodies showcased some of the best up-and-coming talents of Hollywood&#39;s next generation of stars, as well as introducing the duo of Amandla Stenberg and Myha&#39;la Herrold. In the film, the characters have a romantic past hidden beneath an almost platonic dynamic that causes friction within their friend group and makes for excellent dramatic tension. Equal parts attracted to each other and angry at each other, they&#39;re a great reminder that a duo doesn&#39;t always have to be in love or best friends to be memorable. The fact that they&#39;re at odds for most of the film makes them all the more compelling.





 2  Sydney Sweeney &amp; Glenn Powell 
Anyone But You (2023)
        

  Anyone But You  


  Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    Will Gluck     Cast    Sydney Sweeney , Glen Powell , Alexandra Shipp , GaTa , Hadley Robinson , Michelle Hurd , Dermot Mulroney , Darren Barnet , Rachel Griffiths     Rating    Not Yet Rated     Genres    Comedy , Romance     Writers    Will Gluck , Ilana Wolpert     Story By    523843     Studio(s)    Columbia Pictures , Roth/Kirschenbaum Films , Fifty-Fifty Films , Olive Bridge     Distributor(s)    Sony Pictures Releasing    


It&#39;s easy to see why Ben (Powell) and Bea (Sweeney) end up together in Anyone But You. The two leads may have been written to end up together from the start, but their chemistry is so prominent, that there&#39;s never any doubt that the couple won&#39;t come clean about how they feel. The recent resurgence of classic rom-coms has led to many new romantic on-screen partnerships, but few have gotten the buzz that Sweeney and Powell have.
Their banter is flirtatious, and so believable that it feels like there&#39;s a real danger the pair might fall in love for real. Though the pair have denied the rumors that they are involved, that kind of behind-the-scenes drama, true or not, is often a selling point with romance film co-stars. It&#39;s also proof of how much their chemistry bursts off the screen. Bringing this energy into the next generation of romantic comedies would be a smart way to reel in viewers, and gain critics&#39; approval.





 1  Saoirse Ronan &amp; Florence Pugh 
Little Women (2019)


 







  Little Women  


  Release Date    December 25, 2019     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Emma Watson , Timothee Chalamet , Bob Odenkirk , Florence Pugh , Eliza Scanlen , Abby Quinn , Lilly Englert , Chris Cooper , James Norton , Sasha Frolova , Meryl Streep , Saoirse Ronan , Laura Dern , Louis Garrel     Rating    PG     Runtime    135 minutes     Genres    Romance , Drama     Writers    Greta Gerwig     Budget    $40 Million     Studio(s)    Sony    


Though they play sisters who are often at odds in Greta Gerwig&#39;s Little Women, Saoirse Ronan and Florence Pugh make a talented combination. It&#39;s because of the dynamic between two such skilled actresses, that it&#39;s impossible not to imagine the success they would have if they kept working together. A few of their recent projects, like Foe and A Good Person, did not receive positive critical reception, so both performers require a reset. Returning to a tried and true collaboration that will interest audience members of all types, and allow them to explore new aspects of their partnership.
