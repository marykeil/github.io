## SUMMARY 



  According to a new report, Horizon: An American Saga chapters 3 and 4 are encountering funding issues, with Kevin Coster struggling to find investors.   Chapters 1 and 2 of the Western epic are due out this summer, but the expensive films represent a major risk in today&#39;s theatrical landscape.   It&#39;s possible that the two movies won&#39;t perform, meaning Costner&#39;s planned third and fourth movies don&#39;t happen.

## Literature Review

Kevin Costnerâ€™s two-art epic Western, Horizon: An American Saga, is reportedly facing big problems regarding its planned third and fourth instalments.




Horizon: An American Saga, Kevin Costner&#39;s upcoming two-part Western, is reportedly encountering issues behind-the-scenes with its planned sequels. Costner&#39;s filmography is proof that he&#39;s always been attracted to Westerns, and he&#39;s set to make his biggest foray into the genre yet with a two-part epic due out this summer. Horizon: An American Saga represents a major passion project for the actor, who serves as director, producer, writer, and star.




As the Horizon: An American Saga release date approaches, Hollywood journalist Matthew Belloni reports in his Puck newsletter that Costner&#39;s planned third and fourth installments are running into significant funding issues. While parts one and two are due for release in June and August, respectively, parts three and four haven&#39;t yet entered into production, and the star is apparently having trouble finding financiers for the movies. According to Belloni, Costner is hard at work pitching the threequel to money-holders, but has had no luck so far.

  


 Will Horizon: An American Saga Chapters 3 &amp; 4 Get Made? 
          




The financing situation for the first two Horizon films is somewhat mysterious, with a variety of unnamed investors and Costner himself pumping money into the project. The film&#39;s budgets are reported to be over $100 million for each installment, which makes the films a major gamble in today&#39;s theatrical landscape. It&#39;s possible that Costner will find parties willing to invest, but it&#39;s likely that most financiers will want to wait to see how the first two movies perform in theaters.



Costner&#39;s decision to focus on the Horizon franchise is said to be the main reason behind the actor&#39;s highly publicized Yellowstone exit and falling out with showrunner Taylor Sheridan.




Whether Costner&#39;s new Westerns do well in theaters, however, is currently a big question mark. The recent history of the Western genre isn&#39;t a promising sign, and Horizon: An American Saga Chapter 2&#39;s release date being set for only six weeks after Chapter 1 is a big risk. Westerns like The Magnificent Seven (2016), The Hateful Eight (2015) and 3:10 To Yuma (2007), for example, all underperformed. Others like Django Unchained (2012) and True Grit (2010), however, did end up doing quite well.




The Horizon: An American Saga cast features an array of talented actors, including Sam Worthington, Giovanni Ribisi, Luke Wilson, and Sienna Miller, but Costner is the real draw here, and it&#39;s not clear if he will be enough. While the actor&#39;s role as John Dutton in Yellowstone has certainly been great for his career, he&#39;s now departed the show&#39;s final season, meaning the movie will be without this publicity boost. As Belloni suggests in his newsletter, Horizon: An American Saga being more than two films isn&#39;t looking likely.
