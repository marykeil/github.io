## Literature Review
A mix of Knives Out and Talented Mr. Ripley, this underrated 2022 slow-burn mystery is also perfect for Saltburn fans looking for their next thriller.




This severely underrated slow-burn mystery from 2022 is perfect for Saltburn fans who are looking for their next psychological thriller. Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, the Oscar-winning filmmaker behind 2020&#39;s divisive Promising Young Woman, Saltburn combines elements of black comedy and psychological drama to create an unrelenting, unforgettable thrill ride. In the film, Barry Keoghan stars as Oliver Quick, an Oxford University student who becomes obsessed with his classmate, Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi). Both wealthy and popular, Felix is intrigued by Oliver, especially when the latter reveals his challenging, traumatic upbringing. Pretty immediately, Felix invites his new friend to spend the summer at his family&#39;s rural estate.




Filmed on location at Drayton House, Saltburn&#39;s titular estate plays a crucial role. Not only does it set the scene, but the unique, ornate house with its vast grounds creates a singular, unsettling atmosphere. It&#39;s the perfect backdrop for what unfolds, as Oliver slowly seduces other members of the Catton family, from Felix&#39;s sister, Venetia (Alison Oliver), to his mother, Lady Elspeth (Rosamund Pike). The only one not enamored with Oliver is Felix&#39;s American cousin, Farleigh (Archie Madekwe), but the ever-manipulative Oliver makes quick work of the Cattons&#39; skeptical relative. Even Saltburn&#39;s ending is sure to surprise viewers, making it one of the best thrillers in recent years.


 The Origin Of Evil Is One Of The Best Contemporary Thrillers 
          

While critics and audiences alike have drawn comparisons between Emerald Fennell&#39;s sophomore feature and The Talented Mr. Ripley, 2022&#39;s The Origin of Evil is undoubtedly one of the best movies like Saltburn. Directed by Sébastien Marnier, the French and Canadian thriller (originally titled L&#39;Origine du mal) features a plot that&#39;s quite similar to Saltburn&#39;s — at least on the surface. The Origin of Evil sees a fish cannery worker named Stéphane (Laure Calamy) stumbling upon a long-lost familial connection: she is the biological daughter of Serge (Jacques Weber​​​​​​​), a wealthy businessman who owns a vast estate. Much like Saltburn&#39;s Oliver, Stéphane becomes enmeshed in the family members&#39; lives.






The Origin of Evil is available to rent or buy on streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, and Vudu.




While Saltburn boasts an intriguing cast of characters, The Origin of Evil&#39;s Dumontet family might be even more eccentric. The César Award-winning Calamy deftly plays a woman on the brink: Stéphane is not only frustrated by her job, but dealing with a girlfriend who&#39;s behind bars and a nebulous living situation. By inserting herself into the upper crust, she gets more than just her estranged, billionaire father. Serge&#39;s opulent mansion, filled with taxidermy and other oddities, is just a glimpse into the capitalist&#39;s bizarre world. As Stéphane discovers, Serge&#39;s wife (Dominique Blanc), daughter (Doria Tillier), granddaughter (Céleste Brunnquell), and maid (Véronique Ruggia) all harbor secret agendas.






 Emerald Fennell&#39;s Saltburn &amp; The Origin Of Evil Share Aspects In Common 
          

In the same way every death in Saltburn fits the larger plan, The Origin of Evil is rife with shocking revelations and satisfying turns, though the film isn&#39;t afraid to sprinkle in some tongue-in-cheek humor. Filled with inter-family vendettas, the calculating-yet-desperate Stéphane gets much more than she bargained for — not unlike Oliver. Not only are Saltburn and The Origin of Evil twisty thrillers that center on obsession and deception, but they expertly combine unsettling, psychological elements with dark humor. In that sense, both films are endlessly inventive spins on a well-worn genre, even if they share some familial traits.
