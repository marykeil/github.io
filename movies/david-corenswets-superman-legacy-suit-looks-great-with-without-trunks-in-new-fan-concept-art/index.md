## Literature Review

Amid the debate over whether David Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy suit should have trunks, new DCU fan concept art presents great looks at both options.




David Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy suit gets imagined with different versions in creative fan concept art. James Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy arrives in 2025, with the movie being the first of the new DC Universe. While it has been revealed that Corenswet will lead Superman: Legacy, the actor&#39;s Superman costume remains a surprise, with fans starting a heated debate over what it should look like.




On Instagram, @dcu_updates was inspired by @21xfour&#39;s original Superman: Legacy suit concept art and created a few different versions of what Corenswet&#39;s Man of Steel could look like in the movie.


 

The new Superman movie costume has revived the Superman suit trunks debate, with some DC fans believing the character should wear the iconic trunks in Superman: Legacy and others thinking the look is outdated. The fan concept art imagines both options, and Corenswet&#39;s Superman looks great with and without the trunks.

                  Every Actor Cast In Superman Legacy (So Far)   Superman: Legacy will be the first film released in James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe, and the Man of Steel reboot boasts an impressive cast.   





 Why Superman&#39;s DC Universe Suit Is So Important 
          

As the first movie in the new DCU, Superman: Legacy has a lot riding on it. The new Superman suit will likely be the first major suit reveal of the movie, and because of that, it will set the precedent that the rest of the DCU should follow. That is where the debate over whether the new Superman suit should or should not have trunks comes in.

As the first major suit reveal of the DCU, if Gunn chooses to have Corenswet don the classic Superman look with the trunks, it would be a major statement. Having the trunks would visually set Corenswet&#39;s Superman apart from Henry Cavill&#39;s version of the Man of Steel from the DCEU. As the trunks are related to the classic era of Superman in the comics, the tone of Superman: Legacy and the new DCU as a whole would be expected to mirror that of the Superman suit choice, whether that is the goal or not.




While superheroes often get new suits with each movie/TV show appearance, and the comics have seen many costume changes over the years, Superman is a special case. The Man of Steel&#39;s main suit is so iconic that it has barely changed, so any minor tweak to the costume revealed for Corenswet&#39;s Clark Kent in Superman: Legacy will be sure to make waves. Based on Gunn&#39;s recent comments, the Superman: Legacy suit will remain a secret until the film begins shooting in March.







Superman: Legacy releases in theaters on July 11, 2025.
