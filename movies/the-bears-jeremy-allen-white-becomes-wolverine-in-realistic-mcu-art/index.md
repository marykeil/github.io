Realistic MCU fan art paints a great picture of what White as Wolverine could look like.

## Literature Review
Hugh Jackman might be returning as Wolverine in Deadpool 3, but the MCU&#39;s X-Men will arrive in the future, and Marvel art pitches the perfect Logan.




The Bear&#39;s Jeremy Allen White is the perfect Wolverine for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in new epic fan art. Following his award-winning turn as Carmy in The Bear, White has emerged as a popular actor among fans to join the MCU. While Hugh Jackman will once again play Wolverine in Deadpool 3, he is not expected to give life to the main MCU version of the character, which leaves room for White to portray Wolverine when the new X-Men roster for Marvel&#39;s future movies is announced.




On Instagram, digital artist @21xfour shared a realistic depiction of what The Bear&#39;s White could look like as the MCU&#39;s Wolverine.


 

The fan art takes inspiration from one of Jackman&#39;s Wolverine scenes in X-Men: Days of Future Past, showing how great White could look with Logan&#39;s signature Adamantium claws and style. The actor has shown in The Bear that he can bring the necessary charisma and grit to play the MCU&#39;s Wolverine. Before that can happen, the MCU&#39;s only 2024 movie, Deadpool 3, will see Jackman finally don Wolverine&#39;s yellow costume from the comics.

              Related   Deadpool 3 Will Finally Pay Off The Coolest Line From Wolverine&#39;s Worst Movie   Several Deadpool 3 details have already come to light, and a major recent reveal confirms that the MCU movie will pay off an epic Wolverine film line.    





 When Could The MCU’s Version Of Wolverine Debut? 
          

With Jackman&#39;s return in Deadpool 3, it seems like Marvel Studios&#39; new Wolverine will take some time to arrive in the MCU. There might be a small chance that multiple Wolverine variants appear in the multiverse movie, with Deadpool 3 perhaps casting an actor as the MCU&#39;s Wolverine for a cameo before a bigger role in the future, though that is unlikely. Jackman has a major chance of being the only actor to appear as Wolverine in Deadpool 3.

That possible scenario would leave the MCU debut of Wolverine with a few different options. Given Jackman&#39;s status as a fan favorite and how the MCU has been bringing back actors from Fox&#39;s original X-Men franchise — such as Charles Xavier star Patrick Stewart and Beast actor Kelsey Grammer — it seems like the Fox X-Men might have a role to play in the Multiverse Saga. Avengers: Secret Wars is rumored to bring together MCU heroes and characters from all over Marvel&#39;s live-action history, and that could lead to a finale for the Fox X-Men cast.




The MCU&#39;s version of the X-Men could potentially debut at the end of Avengers: Secret Wars, with a new Wolverine actor taking over the role, signaling the handing of the baton. Alternately, Marvel&#39;s new Wolverine actor could be revealed in a later movie, allowing time to pass between his debut and Jackman&#39;s last time as the mutant, be it in Deadpool 3 or another MCU film. The MCU&#39;s Wolverine could then be introduced either in Marvel Studios&#39; first X-Men movie or a Wolverine solo film, both of which would have to come in either 2027 or 2028 at the earliest.
