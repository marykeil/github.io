## Literature Review

Mean Girls 2024 is a musical adaptation of the 2004 movie. Here&#39;s every song on the Mean Girls soundtrack and when each plays in the movie.




The 2024 Mean Girls musical features a stellar soundtrack of songs throughout Cady Heron and The Plastics&#39; story. Following the success of the original 2004 movie starring Linsday Lohan and Rachel McAdams, Tina Fey gave Mean Girls new life through a Broadway musical adaptation. The new version of the Mean Girls story proved to be so beloved that it only took a few years for Hollywood to decide that a musical remake movie was needed next. The very nature of a musical remake meant adding several song and dance sequences to retell the story in a fresh way.




The Mean Girls 2024 soundtrack is filled with songs that originated from the Broadway musical. However, not every song from Broadway will be heard by those who watch Mean Girls. Musical numbers like &#34;It Roars&#34; and &#34;Fearless&#34; were left out of the movie adaptation, as the set list of 21 songs from the musical is cut down to only 13 songs being featured on the official Mean Girls soundtrack, Mean Girls (Music From The Motion Picture). What the movie might lack in terms of songs from the Broadway musical, it adds several other songs to the experience thanks to the movie format.

 When Every Song On The Mean Girls Soundtrack Plays In The Movie 
          

&#34;A Cautionary Tale&#34; by Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey - Mean Girls 2024 begins with a song from Janis (Auli&#39;i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey). &#34;A Cautionary Tale&#34; begins with Janis and Damian performing the song in a garage and recording themselves with a phone. The song is used to set up the overall story about Cady Heron and the Plastics, teasing forthcoming events like Regina getting hit by a bus.

&#34;What Ifs&#34; by Angourie Rice - Immediately after the conclusion of the first Mean Girls song, the movie transitions to Africa and has Angourie Rice perform Cady&#39;s first song. It is intercut in the movie with Cady&#39;s mom telling her that they are moving to America. This allows &#34;What Ifs&#34; to showcase Cady&#39;s life in Africa and the beginning of her first high school experience.




&#34;Meet the Plastics&#34; by Reneé Rapp - The introduction of the Plastics means they receive their own song performed by Reneé Rapp&#39;s Regina George. The song plays during Cady&#39;s first day at school once she returns to the cafeteria and Regina enters the room. &#34;Meet the Plastics&#34; is more so about Regina than Gretchen (Bebe Woods) or Karen (Avantika), but they are both featured in the background.

&#34;Stupid With Love&#34; by Angourie Rice &amp; Cast of Mean Girls - Cady&#39;s second song in Mean Girls comes directly after she meets Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney). &#34;Stupid With Love&#34; begins during their math class and features a few of Cady&#39;s classmates singing and performing in the background. The song continues as Cady continues to watch Aaron throughout school, leading to a section of the song taking place outside of school.

&#34;Apex Predator&#34; by Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey - The second song from Janis and Damian on the Mean Girls soundtrack is directly about Regina. It happens when everyone is outside of school. Regina begins influencing people so Gretchen&#39;s ex-boyfriend stops flirting with another girl. The purpose of Janis and Damian&#39;s song is to tell Cady about why Regina should not be trusted.




&#34;What&#39;s Wrong With Me?&#34; by Bebe Wood - Gretchen gets a solo song in Mean Girls once she and the rest of the Plastics go to Regina&#39;s house. She finds an old music box that she gave to Regina in her closet and immediately breaks into song. &#34;What&#39;s Wrong With Me?&#34; is Gretchen&#39;s chance to express her insecurities and how much she seeks Regina&#39;s approval.

&#34;Sexy&#34; by Avantika - Karen has her own song in Mean Girls 2024 that begins as she records a video about wishing Halloween was every day and that there was world peace. As evident by the title of &#34;Sexy,&#34; the song is really focused on Karen&#39;s love for Halloween and dressing up in sexy outfits. The song puts Avantika in several different costumes as she prepares for the Halloween party and then transitions to showing her and others at the party.

&#34;I&#39;m That Bitch&#34; by RoRo - &#34;I&#39;m That Bitch&#34; is not a song featured on the official Mean Girls soundtrack, but it is featured in the movie. The song can be heard in the background at the Halloween party that Cady, Aaron, and the Plastics attend.




&#34;Someone Gets Hurt&#34; by Reneé Rapp - One of the standout song and dance sequences in 2024&#39;s Mean Girls comes with &#34;Someone Gets Hurt.&#34; Regina&#39;s song happens during the Halloween party after she begins talking to Aaron and he upsets her. The true purpose of the number is for Regina to win Aaron back and betray Cady&#39;s trust, which she does successfully by the end.

&#34;Revenge Party&#34; by Auli&#39;i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey, Angourie Rice, Tim Meadows &amp; Cast of Mean Girls - The next song in Mean Girls brings most of the cast together. &#34;Revenge Party&#34; begins as Janis and Damian tell Cady how they could get revenge on Regina. It transitions into a brightly colored fantasy musical number set at the high school. This means it is essentially a dream scenario at first, but the song continues as their revenge mission starts, showing them trying to torment Regina and it backfiring. It only ends after the candy cane grams take place.

&#34;Laissex Moi Tout (iCarly Theme Song)&#34; by Kyle Brier - One of the songs featured in Mean Girls that is not on the official soundtrack comes through the North Shore talent show. Damian sings a song in French shot in black and white as part of the talent show. It is only at the conclusion of the short solo that it is revealed that he has been singing the iCarly theme song.




&#34;Kevin G Rap&#34; by Mahi Alam &amp; Ensemble - The talent show provides another Mean Girls song not on the soundtrack thanks to Kevin G. He performs the same rap featured in the original 2004 movie until Principal Duvall stops him for being inappropriate.

&#34;Rockin&#39; Around The Pole Again&#34; by Nahscha - The Plastics perform at the talent show as well, but the song is different in the 2024 movie than in 2004. Instead of dancing to &#34;Rockin&#39; Around The Christmas Tree&#34; like in the original, the Plastics use &#34;Rockin&#39; Around The Pole Again.&#34; They do not sing the song, only dancing to it until Regina falls doing one of the moves.

&#34;Te Botè (Remix)&#34; by Casper Magico, Nio Garcia, Darell, Ozuna, Bad Bunny &amp; Nicky Jam - Another song not on the Mean Girls soundtrack that appears in the movie is &#34;Te Botè (Remix).&#34; The song can be heard in the background while the party at Cady&#39;s house takes place.

&#34;No Dey Tire&#34; by Lord Afrixana - &#34;No Dey Tire&#34; is the second song heard during Cady&#39;s party. The inclusion of the song is a natural fit for Mean Girls and to be played by Cady considering Lord Afrixana is an African artist who she could have heard while living in Africa.




&#34;Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)&#34; by Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey - A short version of &#34;Someone Gets Hurt&#34; happens again following the conclusion of Cady&#39;s party. Janis sings a section of it after seeing that Cady lied to her and Damian and missed her art exhibit.

&#34;World Burn&#34; by Reneé Rapp &amp; Cast of Mean Girls - Regina George gets another song in Mean Girls through the use of &#34;World Burn.&#34; The song begins in Regina&#39;s room as she begins making a page for herself in the Burn Book and continues as it is distributed across the school. This allows it to transition from a small, quiet song to a big and loud musical performance for Reneé Rapp featuring many of the insults from the Burn Book.

&#34;I&#39;d Rather Be Me&#34; by Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Cast of Mean Girls - Janis gets her big solo song in Mean Girls with &#34;I&#39;d Rather Be Me.&#34; It begins following the conclusion of the all-girls gathering in the gymnasium where she admits the plan to ruin Regina&#39;s life. The movie follows Janis as she sings about being herself rather than pretending to be someone else and interacting with different classmates, only for it to end with Regina being hit by a bus.




&#34;Stupid With Love (Reprise)&#34; by Angourie Rice &amp; Brad Freaks - Cady performs a short reprisal of &#34;Stupid With Love&#34; later on in Mean Girls. It happens during the mathlete championship and allows Cady to reflect on how she let her pursuit of Aaron get in the way of her studies. Thankfully, it also allows her to remember enough from math class to correctly answer the winning question.

&#34;Single Soon&#34; by Selena Gomez - Another song featured in Mean Girls that is not part of the soundtrack is &#34;Single Soon&#34; by Selena Gomez. The song can be heard playing at the Spring Fling dance at North Shore.

&#34;I See Stars&#34; by Angourie Rice &amp; Cast of Mean Girls - The final song featured in Mean Girls&#39; ending is &#34;I See Stars.&#34; Cady begins singing the song after she wins Spring Fling Queen and decides that the title and crown are not worth it. She performs the musical number as she breaks the crown, splits it up with other classmates, and makes amends with her friends before finding Aaron again.




&#34;Not My Fault&#34; by Reneé Rapp &amp; Megan Thee Stallion - Although not featured in the actual movie itself, the Mean Girls credits sequence includes another song, &#34;Not My Fault.&#34; Beginning with a snippet of audio of Lindsay Lohan from the 2004 movie, the song plays throughout the credits. The collaboration between Reneé Rapp and Megan Thee Stallion pays off Megan Thee Stallion&#39;s cameo earlier in the movie.
