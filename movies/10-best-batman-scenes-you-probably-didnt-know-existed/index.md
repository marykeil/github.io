## Literature Review

Not every great Batman scene makes its way into the spotlight, with some podcasts, books, and deleted movie scenes sneaking their way past audiences.




Perhaps DC&#39;s single most well-represented character, Batman and his associated villains have been in so many stories that some scenes are bound to escape the eyes and ears of even the most dedicated audiences. Batman has been placed in nearly every situation under the sun, spanning a wide range of media. As a result, some of the best, most curious, or downright strange scenes have escaped the watchful gaze of much of his fandom.
Batman stories come in many different forms, with several notable scenes hidden away as filmed content left on the chopping room floor in Batman&#39;s many live-action films. Others lie in less popular forms of superhero media, nevertheless rife with installments featuring the Caped Crusader, such as podcasts and books. No matter the source, after so many years, Bob Kane and Bill Finger&#39;s iconic characters and the world of Gotham have gone through a lot that most general audiences might not even be aware of.

 10  The Joker Kidnaps A Bus Full Of School Children 
Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind, 2023
        

Podcasts have become increasingly popular as a flexible entertainment format that audiences can enjoy on the go. Be it far from the Batman franchise to miss out on such a rife opportunity for an audience, Gotham City has become a popular setting for a slew of podcasts. Not only that, but Batman isn&#39;t even necessarily the focus of all of them, such as 2023&#39;s Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind.
This audio drama centers on Harleen Quinzel&#39;s fall from grace as a respected Arkham psychologist to the Joker&#39;s sidekick and plaything. One scene from episode 3, &#34;Trust Fund Wonderboy,&#34; sees the newly-escaped Joker escalate his crime spree to the point of kidnapping a school bus. This is made all the better by Harleen&#39;s frantic attempts at convincing investor Bruce Wayne that the psychiatry ward is worth his money despite the chaos they&#39;ve allowed to take place.





 9  The Riddler Convinces Azrael To Set Himself On Fire 
The Riddler: Secrets In The Dark, 2023


 







When it comes to Batman&#39;s rogues gallery, The Riddler poses a threat ranging from the criminal mastermind of Paul Dano&#39;s take on the character to Jim Carrey&#39;s bumbling fool of a comedic villain. Yet some interpretations of the character are oddly charismatic, as explored by Hasan Minhaj&#39;s Edward Nygma. This story has the Riddler teaming up with Batman in an uneasy alliance against a murderous vigilante who had been framing the Dark Knight for murder.
The deadly Batman-esque assassin is revealed to be none other than Azrael, a sword-wielding maniac and lesser-known member of the Batfamily. Much to Batman&#39;s chagrin, Edward&#39;s methods of capturing the mentally vulnerable Azrael are less than delicate, using his powers of suggestion to convince the zealous vigilante to light himself ablaze. This climactic ending to an unlikely partnership is made all the better by Minhaj&#39;s utterly convincing performance and Spotify Studios&#39; world-class foley work.





 8  Bruce Hallucinates A Giant Bat 
Batman Forever, 1995
        

One of the most critically panned films to take a look at Batman, Joel Schumaker&#39;s Batman Forever has long been considered one of the least valuable films to feature The Dark Knight. From the nonsensical plot to the bizarre costume and set design, the film holds a true lack of reverence for its source material, resulting in some hilariously bad scenes. One of the most baffling choices, however, was left out of the final cut.

In a brief sequence that was filmed but never put to theaters, Bruce Wayne loses his memory. Entering the Batcave with no prior knowledge, his psyche and underlying fear gets the better of him, resulting in his mind manifesting a massive 9-foot-tall bat with sharp teeth and laser eyes. Alfred is eventually able to quickly help him snap out of it, making this strange scene a pointless endeavor in jump scares forever regulated to the legendary &#34;Schumaker Cut&#34; of the film.





 7  The Joker Strangles Everyone On The Gotham Softball Team 
Batman: The Audio Adventures, 2021


 







Another Batman series for audiophiles, Batman: The Audio Adventures harkens back to the campy Adam West incarnation of the character with its 50s setting and comedic appeal. Featuring Batman at an earlier point in his career, season 1, episode 2, &#34;The Skylight In The Nursery,&#34; has Batman attending the unveiling of his new Bat-signal. One problem presents itself, however, as the Joker seems to have left a message, wrapping the massive spotlight in colorful gift paper.
The sight of Joker&#39;s influence has Batman recall the Clown Prince of Crime&#39;s first escape from Arkham, in which he strangled the entire staff softball team. Told via flashback against the backdrop of The Joker&#39;s haunting echoed laughter, the gravitas of this scene is undercut by the hilarity of the idea of Arkham Asylum having intramural sports. Jeffery Wright&#39;s matter-of-fact delivery on how he &#34;found that very funny for some reason&#34; ups the dramatic flashback to new heights of comedy.





 6  The Harvester Nearly Makes A Cannibal Out Of Bruce Wayne 
Batman Unburied, 2022
        

The 2020s are proving to be a great time to be a Batman audio drama fan, with last year seeing the release of Batman Unburied. This series provides a darker, thoughtful take on Bruce Wayne provided by the smooth, dulcet tones of Winston Duke as Batman. The series begins in seemingly a very different world, where Thomas and Martha Wayne are alive, and Bruce works as a forensic scientist trapped in a deadly game of cat and mouse with a deranged cannibal.

The very first episode of the series pulls no punches, as the sans-Batman-training Wayne is confronted by the evil Harvester in his lab. Attacking Bruce Wayne with a blade while covered in gore, The Harvester preaches madness during this attack, placing a piece of brain matter on Wayne&#39;s tongue and telling him to taste the fear of his victims. With a start that dark, it&#39;s a relief that the alternate Gotham of Batman Unburied is later revealed to be a hallucination.





 5  Batman Disguises Himself As A Homeless Man 
Batman Begins, 2005
        

Despite being lauded as the World&#39;s Greatest Detective, Batman has historically done little detective work throughout his movies. Yet Christopher Nolan nearly introduced his take on the character with just that in a deleted scene in 2005&#39;s Batman Begins. The start of The Dark Knight Trilogy would&#39;ve had Bruce Wayne disguising himself as a homeless man to enter Gotham&#39;s underworld undetected.
This criminal persona evokes Batman&#39;s historic use of the identity &#34;Matches Malone&#34; in the comics to conduct similar reconnaissance. In this deleted scene, Wayne takes the opportunity to take some incriminating photos of public officials colluding with the mob. The final cut shows Batman giving these pictures to Rachel, suggesting that while the scene didn&#39;t make the theatrical release, it did still happen within the film&#39;s story off-screen.





 4  Batman Gets In A Knife Fight With Joker&#39;s Lieutenant, Bob 
Batman, 1989
        

Tim Burton&#39;s dark re-imagining of Batman with his film of the same name is largely responsible for wider audiences&#39; general expectations for the dark DC flagship hero, eschewing the goofy camp that Adam West had previously linked the character to. Part of what made this take on the character work was how intimidating Micheal Keaton could make Batman seem. No scene does a better job than Batman&#39;s brief confrontation with Joker&#39;s right-hand man, Bob.
In the final cut, Batman scares Joker&#39;s right-hand man away with just one look. But a deleted scene from Batman has the unassumingly named henchman step up his game, challenging Batman to a knife fight. Of course, he is quickly dispatched, but seeing Batman dominate in hand-to-hand combat is always a treat for audiences.





 3  Bane Trains Against The League Of Shadows 
The Dark Knight Rises, 2012


 







Having big shoes to fill, The Dark Knight Rises was given an impossible standard from the very beginning, falling short of recapturing the same perfection of The Dark Knight. Part of the criticisms leveled at the film revolved around the handling of Tom Hardy&#39;s Bane, a menacing villain whose narrative was hurt by some late-movie twists. A deleted scene may have gone a long way in characterizing the brutish threat, helping to explain his history with The League Of Shadows.
Taking place in the depths of the prison Bane grew up in, the scene reveals Bane&#39;s origin as a trainee under the mysterious league of assassins. Bane fights off a whole horde of assassins while restrained by chains, demonstrating his might and cunning in combat. This scene drew parallels between Bane and Bruce&#39;s own training under the League Of Shadows and would&#39;ve helped set up Bane better as a foil to Batman with his similar history.





 2  Batman Meets A Green Lantern In Live-Action 
Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, 2021
        

Tumultuous re-shoots and conflicting schedules led to Justice League being a rather piecemeal entry in the DCEU, resulting in Zack Snyder&#39;s own vision for the film getting a separate edit for release on HBO Max. Alluding to an extended universe that may never come to fruition, the end of the movie teases the future with Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman meeting Martian Manhunter in his first live-action appearance, a portent of things to come. However, it was originally going to be another Justice League hero in the scene.


Originally, Martian Manhunter was meant to be replaced with Green Lantern Jon Stewart, which would&#39;ve marked his first live-action appearance in film as well. Wayne T. Carr was even cast as Green Lantern, showing his excitement for the role by eagerly sharing stills from the shoot on Twitter. Unfortunately, one of Batman&#39;s better friendships in the Justice League would yet to be developed as Warner Brothers held Snyder back from including the character due to their own plans.





 1  Batman Rescues A Child Overseas And Becomes The Chosen One 
Batman: The Ultimate Evil, 1995
        

In 1995, author Andrew Vachss was given the reigns to forge a Batman story using his trademark experience in crime novels, DC higher-ups hoping for a gritty mystery featuring The Dark Knight. Vachss was best known for his novels featuring the private investigator Burke, a P.I. specializing in child abuse cases. The novel used this experience to deliver a dark Batman story.
Sticking to what he knew best, Vachss had Batman taking a sudden interest in the world of child abuse and human trafficking, following his mother&#39;s previous research into an overseas pedophile ring to travel to the fictional Southeast Asian country Urdon Khai. Once there, Batman rescues a young girl who had been trafficked. Upon returning the girl to her village, he is hailed as the village&#39;s legendary warrior, prophesied to overthrow Urdon Khai&#39;s dictator, making for an interesting, if not different, Batman adventure.
