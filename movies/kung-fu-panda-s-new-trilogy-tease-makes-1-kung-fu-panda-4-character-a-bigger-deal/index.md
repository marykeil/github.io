## Literature Review

It has been teased that Kung Fu Panda 4 might be the start of a new Kung Fu Panda trilogy, and that is a big deal for one of the characters.




Kung Fu Panda 4 could be the start of a new trilogy, and that makes one of the movie&#39;s characters a bigger deal. The fourth installment of the Kung Fu Panda franchise comes eight years after the original trilogy concluded. DreamWorks&#39; decision to bring back the incredibly successful animated franchise is hardly a surprise given its $1.8 billion box office. The announcement of Kung Fu Panda 4 already indicated that the studio was not ready to let the IP fall by the wayside. It should not come as a surprise then that there is already talk of a new trilogy.




DreamWorks has yet to confirm that Kung Fu Panda 4 is the start of a new trilogy. However, director Mike Mitchell and producer Rebecca Huntley discussed the possibility that this is in the cards during an interview with Next Best Picture following the release of the Kung Fu Panda 4 trailer. Mitchell said in response to questions about the movie reigniting previous plans for six entries that &#34;Itâ€™s very possible&#34; that a new trilogy is starting. If that does happen, Kung Fu Panda 4 can set the stage for what is to come with a new character.

                  10 Most Exciting Things To Expect From Kung Fu Panda 4   Based on the exciting trailer and star-studded voice cast, Kung Fu Panda 4 is primed to be a franchise highlight, and one of 2024&#39;s best movies.   


 Kung Fu Panda 4&#39;s Zhen Could Become The New Dragon Warrior 
          




The biggest new character in Kung Fu Panda 4 is Zhen, voiced by Awkwafina. The fox is a criminal who winds up working with Po to stop The Chameleon. The Kung Fu Panda 4 marketing has only shown snippets of Zhen and her story to this point, but her importance to the film and the franchise&#39;s future can already be seen. The sequel has pushed the Furious Five to the side in favor of giving Zhen a bigger role. The reason for this is that Zhen might become the new Dragon Warrior in Kung Fu Panda 4.

While this revelation is not clear through the marketing, Jack Black confirmed this Kung Fu Panda 4 story detail back in 2023. He revealed at CinemaCon that the movie was about Po training Zhen to be the new Dragon Warrior. Although animated movies&#39; stories can often change throughout the development process, the other details the franchise star revealed about the sequel have proven to be accurate. The Kung Fu Panda 4 trailer shows Po taking on a new leadership role and leaving the Dragon Warrior title behind, so the idea that Zhen could be his replacement lines up.






 Zhen Being Dragon Warrior Hints At Kung Fu Panda&#39;s New Trilogy Plans 
          

Kung Fu Panda 4 making Zhen the new Dragon Warrior is an early hint at what this new Kung Fu Panda trilogy could focus on. DreamWorks would never completely get rid of Po, but it is possible that he will become less of the franchise&#39;s lead, so future sequels could follow Zhen&#39;s adventures as Dragon Warrior. This might mean the Kung Fu Panda trilogy will remain mostly focused on the bond Po and Zhen form. That could result in smaller roles from the Furious Five moving forward as Kung Fu Panda 4 pushes the franchise in new directions.
