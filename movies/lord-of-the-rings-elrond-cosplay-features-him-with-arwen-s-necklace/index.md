## Literature Review

An impressive new Lord of the Rings cosplay brings Elrond to life, and it includes a stunning recreation of the Evenstar, Arwenâ€™s necklace.




Elrond holds Arwen&#39;s necklace in a detailed new The Lord of the Rings cosplay. Peter Jackson&#39;s trilogy was released from 2001 to 2003, bringing to life the locations and characters from J.R.R. Tolkien&#39;s beloved source material to stunning effect. Hugo Weaving plays an important role as part of the Lord of the Rings cast in all three movies as Elrond, the wise Elf ruler of Rivendell. 




A new cosplay shared by @helicarrot on Instagram now recreates the regal look of Weaving&#39;s Elrond as featured in The Lord of the Rings. Check out the cosplay below:


 

In addition to faithfully recreating Elrond&#39;s robes and wig, the cosplay includes a prop recreation of the Evenstar, Arwen&#39;s necklace, which she gifts to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) in the first film.

Which Version Of The Lord Of The Rings Character Is Best?
          




In addition to featuring in Tolkien&#39;s source material, Elrond has now appeared in three different live-action Middle-earth outings. After Weaving first played the character in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, he would reprise the role for two installments of Jackson&#39;s lesser Hobbit trilogy. Most recently, the character appeared in Prime Video&#39;s divisive The Rings of Power.

The versions of Elrond featured in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are obviously the most similar, but there are some subtle differences between them. In the latter trilogy, for example, Elrond is a little younger and less poised, and he even gets a big action sequence alongside Gandalf (Ian McKellen). The only time audiences see Elrond as anything other than a thoughtful but stern leader in Jackson&#39;s original trilogy comes during The Fellowship of the Ring&#39;s prologue when he is shown fighting the dark armies of Mordor and urging Isildur to destroy the One Ring.

The Rings of Power takes place during the Second Age of Middle-earth, meaning the version of Elrond featured is much younger, with Robert Aramayo taking on the role. This younger Elrond is still thoughtful and wise, but is noticeably more lighthearted and less commanding than the versions played by Weaving. While which version of Elrond is best is, of course, a matter of personal preference, Weaving&#39;s original version featured in The Lord of the Rings trilogy is arguably the most iconic.
