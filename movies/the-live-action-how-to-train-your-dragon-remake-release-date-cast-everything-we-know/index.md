## Literature Review

A live-action How to Train Your Dragon remake is coming from Universal, and there&#39;s already much to discuss on the cast and story of the 2025 movie.




A live-action How to Train Your Dragon remake is in the works with original franchise director Dean DeBlois at the helm, and there’s already much to discuss ahead of the projected 2025 release date. The original How to Train Your Dragon introduced audiences to Hiccup, Astrid, the village of Berk, and of course the adorable-yet-deadly dragon Toothless back in 2010. Since then two sequels alongside numerous TV spinoffs have arrived. DreamWorks and Universal are next taking a nod from Disney and delivering a live-action How to Train Your Dragon reboot.




Like the original animated franchise, the live-action How to Train Your Dragon will be loosely based on the original 2003 book by Cressida Cowell, with which it shares a title. The remake will bring Hiccup and Toothless into live-action, adapting the story of the original for a new audience. With the release date set and cast updates already arriving it’s clear that the live-action How to Train Your Dragon remake could be the start of another box-office-smashing franchise for DreamWorks and Universal.


 Latest Live-Action How To Train Your Dragon News 
          

While details about the live-action remake are scant, the latest news regards the cast, and sees Gerard Butler reprise his role in the How to Train Your Dragon live-action reboot. The established action star voiced the role of Stoick in the animated films, and he will now be returning as Hiccup&#39;s less-than-supportive dad. Stoick the Vast is a major part of Hiccup&#39;s development, and Butler&#39;s veteran presence will bring a bit of familiarity to the reboot. It is still uncertain if any other original stars will return.




In other news, veteran comedic actor Nick Frost has been added to the How to Train Your Dragon live-action cast, assuming the role of Gobber the Belch. The role was previously voiced by Craig Ferguson in the animated films.

 Live-Action How To Train Your Dragon Cast 
          

There have already been several announcements for the live-action How to Train Your Dragon cast. Hiccup, the protagonist of the franchise and first dragon trainer in Berk, will be played by Mason Thames (The Black Phone). Nico Park (The Last of Us) is assuming the role of Astrid, and Gerard Butler has signed on to reprise his role as Stoick the Vast, Hiccup&#39;s father. Additionally, Nick Frost will assume the role of Gobber the Belch, a part originally voiced by Craig Ferguson in the animated trilogy. 






 Live-Action How To Train Your Dragon Story 
          

As a remake, the upcoming live-action How to Train Your Dragon plot is expected to mirror the original 2010 movie closely. The story focuses on Hiccup, a young, clumsy Viking from the village of Berk. The Vikings of Berk have one favorite pastime — slaying Dragons. However, Hiccup doesn’t share their obsession but does want to impress his father, the legendary village chief Stoic the Vast. Therefore, he uses his knack for invention to create novel ways of taking down Dragons.

This leads Hiccup to capture a Night Fury, one of the rarest and most dangerous varieties of Dragon, but Hiccup soon learns that the Night Fury, whom he names Toothless, isn’t as fearsome as he first appeared. He trains Toothless, proving that Vikings and Dragons can coexist. This starts a new age of Dragon Riders in Berk, spawning several sequels and spinoff TV shows from the incredibly successful, yet simple, premise. When the live-action How to Train Your Dragon release date arrives in 2025 the plot will likely follow the same basic structure.
