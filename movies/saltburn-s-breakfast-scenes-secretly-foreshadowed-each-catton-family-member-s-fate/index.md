Warning: This article contains spoilers for Saltburn.






Mention of murder and allusion to suicide.




Saltburn cleverly foreshadows each of the Catton family members&#39; fates through various breakfast and lunch scenes. Over the course of Emerald Fennell&#39;s psychological thriller, Oliver Quick, played by Barry Keoghan, develops an obsession with Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), which results in numerous shocking and dark scenes. Set in the early 2000s, in England, Saltburn includes various references to historical, mythological, and literary figures and tales. This provides a rich fount of hidden meanings and subtle details that allude to the underlying sinister edge to Saltburn&#39;s multi-faceted story meanings and themes.

While Oliver comes across as an innocent loner at first, with family issues and a father who passed away, he has moments throughout the film that suggest the unhealthy and twisted nature of his obsession with Felix and his family&#39;s estate. With his obsession comes the demise of each of the Catton family members, leading to Oliver owning the estate. Aside from other details suggesting Oliver&#39;s true motives, the breakfast and lunch scenes when the Catton family is all together with Oliver perfectly set up each of the family members&#39; fates in covert ways.




                  Saltburn Cast &amp; Character Guide   Since Saltburn&#39;s compelling drama is primarily driven by its well-written character beats, one cannot help but wonder who plays whom in the movie.   


 Felix&#39;s Doppelgänger Walking By The Window Hinted At Death After The Shelley Story 
         

During Oliver&#39;s first breakfast with the Catton family, Venetia tells a story about the British poet Percy Shelley and his housekeeper, who saw Shelley’s doppelgänger walking past a window and waving at her from outside. However, when the housekeeper waves back, she recalls Shelley&#39;s in Italy and that she&#39;s on the top floor. What&#39;s most crucial here is that when Venetia mentions the doppelgänger walking past the window, a Felix double passes by the window behind her. The real Felix is still seated beside Venetia at the time, therefore foreshadowing his death by equating him with Shelley&#39;s doppelgänger.




Shelley&#39;s fate in the story ends with death by drowning. While Felix doesn&#39;t drown, he is found dead the morning after Oliver&#39;s birthday party. Another small detail is that when Felix&#39;s body is brought out of the maze, the butler, Duncan, asks if he should close the curtain so the family doesn&#39;t have to see. This curtain is on the same window the doppelgänger passed earlier and also mirrors Felix&#39;s reaction to the Shelley story since he had covered his ears, shut his eyes, and asked Venetia to stop. Moreover, in the search for Felix, Venetia and Farleigh are shown frantically wading through water, also referencing Shelley&#39;s cause of death.



 Venetia Overflowing Her Cup With Red Wine Foreshadowed Her Bathtub Death 
          

In the first breakfast scene, Venetia&#39;s story about Percy Shelley mentions the cause of death as drowning. This sets up Venetia&#39;s death to also involve water as she dies in a bathtub. But more importantly, during the scene following Felix&#39;s death, Venetia is shown in a dazed state as she fills her wine glass, letting it overflow. Additionally, once the curtains are closed, the rest of the scene is overlaid with red, also foreshadowing the immense amount of blood in Venetia&#39;s death scene.




Later, in Felix&#39;s bathtub, Venetia berates Oliver for his obsession. The next day, she&#39;s found almost entirely submerged in the bath with bloody water spilled on the floor, mimicking her wine glass at the table. While Oliver left razor blades on the bath&#39;s edge in the scene before, this is only revealed later. Venetia&#39;s death is described by Oliver as a result of her not being able to handle living without Felix around. This notion repeats later as a contributing factor in Sir James&#39; death, signifying how each Saltburn death&#39;s timing intentionally fits into Oliver&#39;s plan.

                  Dark Saltburn Theory Reveals Who Was Really Responsible For All Those Deaths (&amp; Gives Oliver A Harsher Fate)   A twisted Saltburn theory casts Ollie&#39;s fate in a sinister light and draws symbolic parallels to the Overlook Hotel in Stanley Kubrick&#39;s The Shining.   



 Elspeth Choking On Her Food Teased Her Death After Oliver Removes Her Ventilator 
          




In the same scene that foreshadows Venetia&#39;s death, Elspeth tries to distract herself from grief by asking Oliver to tell them about his birthday party. This mimics Oliver telling her the story of his time at Saltburn. It&#39;s only revealed that he&#39;s been talking to an unconscious Elspeth in the scene when he kills her. Additionally, while the coroner removes Felix&#39;s dead body, Elspeth is shown choking on her food or gagging.

This is a direct display of how she inevitably dies, namely by choking when Oliver removes her ventilator tube. Additionally, in another scene following Felix&#39;s funeral, Elspeth desperately asks Oliver to confirm he isn&#39;t leaving them or Saltburn when he gets up to go upstairs. Unbeknownst to her - or the audience at the time - Oliver&#39;s return to Saltburn later in the film ultimately leads to Elspeth&#39;s death. Her fondness of Oliver and possible loneliness as a result of Sir James&#39; self-imposed isolation likely inspired her invitation to have Oliver return, further signaling Oliver&#39;s forethought about when the Cattons&#39; deaths would occur.




                  10 Biggest Unanswered Questions &amp; Mysteries After Saltburn   Saltburn&#39;s wild ending leaves several questions and mysteries surrounding Ollie, the Saltburn estate, and the Catton family altogether.   



 Sir James Shuts Out The World Before Dying Alone 
          

While assembled at the dinner table after Felix&#39;s death, Sir James is shown as much more on edge than previously, snapping at Duncan when he struggles to get the curtains closed. Sir James&#39; anger here sets up his later isolation, starting with banishing Farleigh after Oliver mentions the drugs in his room. Sir James tries to shut everything during the scene at the dinner table, starting with the curtains. He even shuts his eyes and blocks his ears as the body is wheeled past the window.

Following Venetia&#39;s death, Sir James asks Oliver to leave the house as he believes he has an unhealthy obsession with his wife. He even asks him how much money it would take for Oliver to leave. Later, Oliver reads of his death in a newspaper. Essentially, Sir James didn&#39;t welcome any new people into his life again, since Elspeth confirms &#34;everything is still the same&#34; as Oliver left it.




Saltburn&#39;s references and hidden details provide clues to the Catton family members&#39; fates in subtle and carefully curated ways. These details acted as hints about their deaths, and the order of their deaths highlights the twisted cunning in Oliver&#39;s plan. Oliver got rid of each family member in the ways that could most effectively unravel the remaining family members until he got what he wanted, thus propelling the story forward.
