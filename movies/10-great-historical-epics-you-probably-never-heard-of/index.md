## Literature Review



Historical epics like Gladiator and Lawrence of Arabia are some of the most celebrated films ever made, but there are many outstanding installments to the genre that have flown under the radar. Historical films have gone through periods of immense appeal and long stretches with little action. The 1950s and 1960s offered dozens of historical fiction films, such as Spartacus, Cleopatra, and Ben-Hur. Similarly, the 2000s saw an uptick in sword-wielding historical epics following the success of Braveheart and Gladiator. Of course, historical epics also include World War II films, which have remained culturally appealing consistently.
The 2020s have been a downtrodden period for the sword-and-sandal historical epic genre, as movies like The Last Duel and The Northman have struggled to bring people to theaters. While many great historical epics have bombed at the box office, even more have become lost in the cultural vernacular. From the Trojan War to the settlement of the thirteen colonies to the Bolshevik Revolution, many of Hollywood&#39;s greatest stars have appeared in historical epics that deserve far more attention.









 








 10  Helen Of Troy 
Directed by John Kent Harrison (2003)
        

2004 saw the release of the commercially successful Troy, a film centered around Brad Pitt&#39;s Achilles and his journey to greatness in the Trojan War. However, in 2003, a British-American miniseries explored Homer&#39;s Iliad from a broader perspective. While it was released on TV in episodic format, Helen of Troy is a feature film-length saga that was subsequently released on DVD as a movie. It lacks much of the high-budget action seen in Troy, but the adaptation boasts a strong cast, including Rufus Sewell, John Rhys-Davies, and Stellan Skarsgård, and offers the full narrative scope of the Trojan War.

 15 Movies That Completely Cover Historical Events From Start To Finish 
While many films focus on historical events, few cover the complete event from start to finish. Here are 15 that provide a full picture of history.









 9  Julius Caesar 
Directed by Uli Edel (2002)
        

Another made-for-television miniseries that can be viewed as a film is 2002&#39;s Julius Caesar, which chronicles the life of the famous Roman general from his early friendship with Gnaeus Pompey to his assassination in 44 BC. With its limited budget, the TNT production assembles a masterful historical drama with an outstanding cast and musical score. Jeremy Sisto stars as Caesar, and Christopher Walken, Chris Noth, and the great Richard Harris appear in supporting roles. Aside from HBO&#39;s Rome, the 2002 film is the best adaptation of Caesar&#39;s life available.





 8  Reds 
Directed by Warren Beatty (1981)
        

A passion project from writer/director/star Warren Beatty, the 1981 romantic historical epic Reds explores the life of John Reed, a journalist who chronicled the Great October Socialist Revolution in 1917. Beatty has unbelievable chemistry with co-star Diane Keaton, who plays a journalist intrigued by Reed&#39;s radical idealism, with whom he becomes infatuated. Jack Nicholson also stars as Eugene O&#39;Neill, forming a love triangle between the three characters. Reds is a fantastically written historical epic, though the film&#39;s highlights are its star performances and romantic aspects.





 7  The New World 
Directed by Terrence Malick (2005)
        

Terrence Malick has made two unbelievable historical epics that deserve more attention. The first is his World War II film, The Thin Red Line, and the latter is The New World. Malick is known for his breathtaking, painting-like visuals, slow-paced poetic language, and focus on the nature and ambiance surrounding his characters. In that sense, The New World is an off-beat, artistic historical epic. Still, it&#39;s a beautiful film with exceptional performances from Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, Christopher Plummer, and Q&#39;orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas.

Like Cillian Murphy&#39;s portrayal of Oppenheimer, there are many films where perfectly cast actors transformed into the historical figures they played.









 6  Land of the Pharaohs 
Directed by Howard Hawks (1955)
        

The 1950s were filled with enormous historical epic productions, including 1955&#39;s Land of the Pharaohs, an epic centered around the Egyptian monarch Khufu. The film was made by director Howard Hawks, who famously made iconic Western classics like Rio Bravo, Red River, and El Dorado. Unlike the proceeding Cleopatra, Land of the Pharaohs suffered due to a lack of famous movie stars in its cast but still offers an ensemble of fascinating characters.





 5  Alexander: The Ultimate Cut 
Directed by Oliver Stone (2014 Blu-ray Edition)


Close







In the wave of high-budget historical epics in the 2000s, Alexander was among the most ridiculed, not even cracking the ten best Oliver Stone films. However, the filmmaker couldn&#39;t let the project go and continued to release a series of director&#39;s cuts, hoping to fix its issues. In 2014, Stone released a Blu-ray edition titled Alexander: The Ultimate Cut. While certain problems are still apparent, it&#39;s a much better version than the original theatrical release, which is still the most widely seen version. Like Alexander, Ridley Scott&#39;s Kingdom of Heaven also has a much stronger director&#39;s cut worth watching.





 4  The Mission 
Directed by Roland Joffé (1986)
        

Robert De Niro&#39;s best movies primarily consist of gangster films, though The Mission is one of his most under-viewed classics. Set in the 1750s, De Niro co-stars with Jeremy Irons as Rodrigo Mendoza and Father Gabriel, two men who join together to defend a South American mission from Portuguese slavers. The Mission is a challenging film with complex historical and religious themes, but it contains two fantastic performances and a historically faithful narrative.





 3  Joan of Arc 
Directed by Victor Fleming (1948)
        

Joan of Arc&#39;s story has been adapted numerous times, most notably in the 1928 silent film The Passion of Joan of Arc. Twenty years later, The Wizard of Oz director Victor Fleming explored the historical figure with Ingrid Bergman in the leading role. Aside from the bonus of the iconic Ingrid Bergman suited up in armor for battle, Joan of Arc has been celebrated for its inspiring, drama and dialogue-filled adaptation, despite lacking much action.





 2  Aguirre, The Wrath Of God 
Directed by Werner Herzog (1972)
        

Directed by iconic German filmmaker Werner Herzog, Aguirre, the Wrath of God follows a Spanish conquistador who explores Peru in search of El Dorado, set after the fall of the Incan Empire. The character Aguirre, who actor Klaus Kinski beautifully portrays, delves deeper into madness as he ventures deeper into the jungle while accompanied by his young daughter. The 1972 film has become a cult classic and is celebrated as one of the director&#39;s best works.

 1  The Bounty 
Directed by Roger Donaldson (1984)


Close







The story of Mutiny on the Bounty has had multiple film adaptations, including an earlier version starring Marlon Brando. However, the 1984 remake has an even more impressive cast and is ultimately a better film. Mel Gibson stars as Fletcher Christian, a man who leads a mutiny against the cruel Lieutenant Bligh, played by Ser Anthony Hopkins. Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Liam Neeson also have supporting roles in the sea-faring epic. The Bounty is an entertaining classic filled with fantastic performances.
