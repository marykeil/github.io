# Charlie Hunnam s 1 Condition For Making Pacific Rim 3 Would Fix The Sequel s Major Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Charlie Hunnam is open to returning to Pacific Rim 3 only if Guillermo del Toro, who directed the first film, also returns.   Hunnam&#39;s enthusiasm for a potential return speaks to the original movie&#39;s quality and the talent involved.   Del Toro&#39;s absence from Pacific Rim Uprising is seen as a contributing factor to its poor performance, and his return is crucial for the success of Pacific Rim 3.

## Literature Review

Although Charlie Hunnam has recently expressed his interest in making another Pacific Rim movie, he&#39;ll only do it under one very specific condition.




Pacific Rim star Charlie Hunnam recently revealed he would be open to returning to the franchise&#39;s Pacific Rim 3 under one very specific condition and it would fix the biggest problem of the sequel. While there&#39;s no official word about Pacific Rim 3 or if it&#39;s ever going to see the light of day, its potential existence is exciting as it could rectify the disappointment that was 2018&#39;s action movie, Pacific Rim Uprising. 2013&#39;s Pacific Rim sees a small unit of highly skilled pilots operate giant robots to combat the threats of vicious underwater monsters who wish to bring about the apocalypse. Pacific Rim is one of the best mecha movies, thus resulting in its sequel and animated series.




Known for taking on drastically different roles, Hunnam has yet to make a sequel, so his enthusiasm regarding his possible return to the Pacific Rim franchise speaks to the original movie&#39;s quality as well as the level of talent involved behind the camera. Furthermore, Hunnam&#39;s possible return to the Pacific Rim franchise along with the proper behind-the-scenes talent could result in an excellent action movie that could make up for Pacific Rim Uprising&#39;s lackluster performance. While Hunnam returning to Pacific Rim is exciting all on its own, Hunnam&#39;s one condition for returning to Pacific Rim 3 is just as compelling.

                  The Real Reason Why Guillermo Del Toro Didn&#39;t Direct Pacific Rim 2 (&amp; Why He Can&#39;t Watch It)   Guillermo del Toro shares the surprising reason he didn&#39;t direct Pacific Rim: Uprising, also revealing why he never watched the sequel.

Charlie Hunnam has been clear that if he were to join Pacific Rim 3, he&#39;d only do it with Guillermo del Toro, who directed the first movie, were to return to the franchise. Pacific Rim is one of Guillermo del Toro&#39;s best movies thanks to his love of kaiju movies, faithful handling of practical effects, and unique vision. Del Toro&#39;s passion for filmmaking gives him a mastery of the subjects he covers, making each of his movies feel special and distinct. Despite the level of talent involved in Pacific Rim: Uprising, the sequel places a heavier emphasis on the action without ever getting audiences on board with the drama of its human characters. With del Toro&#39;s eye for detail regarding absurd and bizarre characters and worlds, he&#39;s the only filmmaker who should be responsible for Pacific Rim 3.



 How Likely Is Pacific Rim 3?

Although del Toro is the only proper option for Pacific Rim 3, it likely won&#39;t ever happen. The most recent Pacific Rim 3 update from del Toro was in 2021 when he stated he had no plans to return to the series. Although Guillermo del Toro has no plans for Pacific Rim 3, Hunnam&#39;s recent statements to Inverse suggest it could happen under the right circumstances. In the interview, Hunnam is asked about projects he&#39;d be interested in returning to, and without any hesitation he remarks that he&#39;d be interested in returning to the Pacific Rim franchise, or anything with del Toro, should the opportunity present itself.



&#34;I would do anything that Guillermo was doing. If Guillermo invites me to do Pacific Rim 3, I&#39;ll be there, or anything else he wants to do.&#34;




While Hunnam&#39;s comments inspire hope that viewers can see the filmmaker return to the Pacific Rim franchise, the poor performance of Pacific Rim: Uprising combined with the filmmaker&#39;s comments clarifying he&#39;s not interested in directing another movie in the franchise strongly suggest audiences won&#39;t get a chance to see Pacific Rim 3. Furthermore, with del Toro&#39;s work on his TV series, Guillermo del Toro&#39;s Cabinet of Curiosities, and his subsequent work producing an upcoming Frankenstein movie, it&#39;s even less likely now that del Toro will return to the franchise. If it doesn&#39;t happen, that&#39;s for the best: del Toro is the only proper choice should Pacific Rim 3 ever happen.
