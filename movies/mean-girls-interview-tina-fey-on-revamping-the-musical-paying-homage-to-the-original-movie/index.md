Summary

  Mean Girls (2024) is a fresh iteration of the classic movie that aims to capture the hearts of a new generation.   Tina Fey focused on making this adaptation of Mean Girls fun, fresh, and surprising, while still bringing beloved characters to the screen.   Reneé Rapp, reprising her role as Regina George, brings a powerful and intimidating presence to the film, with subtle and funny moments that shine on camera.  





Mean Girls (2024) melds Tina Fey&#39;s 2004 screen sensation with the more recent Broadway adaptation, creating a fresh iteration of the classic movie that hopes to capture the hearts of a new generation. Penned by Tina Fey, the movie musical stars a crop of up-and-coming actors taking on the iconic roles of the original — aided by the guidance of Fey and Tim Meadows, returning as Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall.




Angourie Rice (Spider-Man: No Way Home) leads the cast of Mean Girls as Cady Heron, a homeschooled teenager who moves from Kenya to a public high school in the suburban United States. Though she easily makes friends with Janis (Auli&#39;i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she is also thrown into the world of the popular Plastics. Reneé Rapp reprises her role from the stage musical as the leader of the pack, Regina George, while Avantika and Bebe Wood are her minions, Karen and Gretchen respectively.

                  Mean Girls 2024 - Release Date, Cast, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Tina Fey is bringing Broadway to the big screen in the Mean Girls (2024), and there&#39;s already much to discuss before the movie releases.   

Screen Rant interviewed Tina Fey about the goals with which she approached the new Mean Girls adaptation, how some of the song changes came about, and why Reneé Rapp was asked to return as Regina George.


 Tina Fey Talks Mean Girls (2024) 
         




Screen Rant: What was it that you really wanted to have stand out this time around in this adaptation of the stage musical adapting the movie?


Tina Fey: I think the key goals for this version were for it to be fun, fresh, and surprising. Most people who will see this movie have seen the original; a fair chunk of them have seen the musical, but how can we delight and surprise them? What can we give them that they didn&#39;t expect while still bringing them these characters that they have affection for?


The cutting of the songs makes total sense. It flows for the sake of the movie. But I was wondering what your thought process was with changing Cady’s first song?


Tina Fey: I think some of it was that lyrically, this is very, very technical Broadway stuff. Lyrically, a lot of What Ifs, I mean, a lot of It Roars, tells us things that we can see in a film. She&#39;s sort of saying like, &#34;I&#39;m 17, and here&#39;s where I live,&#34; and blah. We realize, oh, it&#39;s cinematic. We can see that. So I think now, and Jeff and Renee, because Renee wrote that song with those guys, I think we thought there was a way to get more of a standalone song.
I&#39;ve been saying that, for me, the template of what kind of movie we should be trying to be from Broadway to the stage was we should be modeling ourselves after the movie Greece, as compared to the stage version of Greece, which they sort of took the temple songs, they added some new songs. So I think that was always my thinking behind that.





And speaking of Reneé, it is an inspired choice to have her reprise the role of Regina. What does she bring to this version that wasn&#39;t present on the stage?


Tina Fey: Reneé can really own a closeup. Her face is so stunning, and also she&#39;s so intimidating when she needs to be. So I think she&#39;s built for the screen. She just is so powerful. At the same time, she has the legit vocal and movement skills of a Broadway star. So, you&#39;re really just getting the best of everything.
But there are some really funny things that she does in the movie that are very subtle and definitely camera-style acting like in the gym when Ms. Norbury almost sings. Please, if you see the movie again, please just watch Renee&#39;s eyes. She&#39;s so funny. She just does this really funny take with her eyes.
As Regina, Reneé has this quality that Regina has to have, which is you&#39;re scared of her, but you also really want her to like you. You want her to notice you. You want her to approve of you. You want her to shine her light on you.







 About Mean Girls 
          

From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic Mean Girls. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets out to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.
