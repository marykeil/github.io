## Literature Review

Avatar wants to be the biggest grand sci-fi epic in the history of cinema. Audiences are looking forward to how James Cameron can execute this vision.




There are plenty of things that viewers are looking forward to seeing in Avatar 3, 4, and 5. Undoubtedly, the Avatar franchise offers some of the most anticipated upcoming movies in the next decade of cinema. From its signature stunning visual effects, to its epic tale of war between humans and the Na&#39;vi, there are several reasons why Avatar is among the highest-grossing sci-fi franchises of all time.
With the release dates of every Avatar movie already assigned until 2031, this trend is likely to continue in the next couple of years. There&#39;s not that much that&#39;s been revealed about the third, fourth, and fifth Avatar films, which are respectively titled Avatar: The Seed Bearer, Avatar: The Tulkun Rider, and Avatar: The Quest for Eywa. However, from these titles and what&#39;s already transpired in the first two films, audiences have speculated heavily about what they can expect from the continuation of director James Cameron&#39;s box office-breaking epic. What are the things we most want to see in Avatar 3, 4, and 5?









 








 10  James Cameron Not Rehashing The Same Stories 
How far can Cameron take this environmental sci-fi epic?
        

One of the most common criticisms faced by the second movie, Avatar: The Way of Water, is how it simply repeated the first film&#39;s plot and themes - but with much more impressive characters, settings, and effects. Thanks in part to the &#34;rare spectacle&#34; effect - and the long preparation time - Avatar 2 was a massive critical and commercial success. The third film, Avatar: The Seed Bearer, will be the real test of James Cameron&#39;s Avatar sequel plans, as it will determine whether Avatar can break away from the established stories and formulae that made it a billion-dollar franchise. Hopefully, Cameron and his crew can rise to this challenge.





 9  Life Back On Earth During The War On Pandora 
What&#39;s really going on back in the human homeworld?
        

The Avatar movies have actually already revealed plenty of what&#39;s happening on Earth as the Resources Development Administration or RDA fight the Na&#39;vi on Pandora. The RDA practically runs what&#39;s left of the planet, much of which has been decimated by climate change and constant war. The movies never actually showing Earth allow the audience to surmise for themselves what life on the dystopian human homeworld is like. All of this is part of the writers&#39; plans to eventually make an impactful reveal of how Earth benefits from the unobtanium and amrita forcibly taken by the RDA from Pandora. Avatar&#39;s return to Earth is already set for the fifth movie.

Avatar 5 will see the Na&#39;vi travel to Earth, and here&#39;s how this storyline can conclude two of the franchise&#39;s most important character arcs.








 8  The Fire Na&#39;vi And The Other 20 Clans In Pandora 
Who and where are the rest of the Na&#39;vi?
        

Combined, the Avatar movies, games, and comic books have revealed the existence of 20 different Na&#39;vi clans. Avatar introduced the deeply spiritual and forest-dwelling Omaticaya, while Avatar: The Way of Water debuted the seafaring Metkayina clan. Avatar: The Seed Bearer will reportedly introduce a never-before-seen clan called the Ash People, also known as the Fire Na&#39;vi. Though this continues the movies&#39; pattern of elemental-themed Na&#39;vi clans, the Ash People could shake things up with a civil war among the Na&#39;vi in Pandora, due to their suggested affinity with the planet&#39;s fiery landscapes. Just like the other yet-unseen clans, Avatar 3&#39;s Fire Na&#39;vi or Ash People are highly anticipated.





 7  Unexpected RDA/Human Schemes And Technologies 
What else is the RDA capable of doing?


 







The first two Avatar movies showed the RDA rapidly colonizing Pandora, looting the planet, and terrorizing the Na&#39;vi using advanced weapons and ships. The Way of Water dove into how the RDA&#39;s scientists developed the Recombinant Program, a corrupted version of the Na&#39;vi&#39;s Tree of Souls ritual which practically enslaves soldiers into potentially eternal combat. Apart from unobtanium which has many tech applications on Earth, the RDA also harvests amrita from Pandora&#39;s Tulkun as an anti-aging medicine. After the ending of Avatar: The Way of Water, the RDA is bound to come up with more shockingly brutal technologies and strategies for stripping Pandora of its resources in the upcoming sequels.

Avatar: The Way of Water&#39;s ending sets up a few storylines for its remaining sequels to tackle. Here&#39;s how the Avatar 2 ending explained what&#39;s next.








 6  Humans And The Na&#39;vi Becoming More Like Each Other 
Will humans and the Na&#39;vi ever find peace?
        

Whether peace can be achieved between humans and the Na&#39;vi remains a question that can only be answered by the last movie in the Avatar saga. However, audiences can definitely look forward to seeing more of the cultural and genetic merging between the two mutually alien species. This was teased by the indigenous four-fingered Na&#39;vi eventually accepting Jake and Kiri who have five fingers, and by characters like Spider and Kiri bridging the two species and cultures amid war. With the introduction of the villainous Ash People in Avatar 3, the franchise is bound to dive deeper into how the Na&#39;vi and humans aren&#39;t actually that different from one another.





 5  James Cameron&#39;s Cinematic Tech Advances 
How else will Cameron revolutionize blockbuster cinema?
        

If there&#39;s one thing that both loyal viewers and harsh critics of the franchise can look forward to, it is that all the upcoming Avatar movies will feature striking visual effects, production design, and action. From the use of the Fusion Camera system in Avatar, to the new motion-capture technology that brought Pandora&#39;s oceans to life in The Way of Water, various cinematic technologies have come together to realize James Cameron&#39;s visionary sci-fi epic. Undoubtedly, the mystery of what new technologies Cameron will employ next is a huge part of the Avatar franchise&#39;s box office appeal, as every sequel is yet another opportunity for the director to revolutionize blockbuster cinema.





 4  New Na&#39;vi Sacred Locations Across Pandora 
What and where are the other magical places in Pandora?


 







Several of the Na&#39;vi&#39;s sacred locations in Pandora have already been revealed. This includes the Tree of Souls, which the Na&#39;vi use to communicate with Eywa, and the Metkayina clan&#39;s Cove of the Ancestors. Any of the sequels could feature the Well of Souls from Avatar: The Game, which is a mysterious location to both the RDA and the native Na&#39;vi. Meanwhile, the Ash People&#39;s debut in Avatar: The Seed Bearer could also take audiences to a sacred volcanic archipelago. Such a setting would be an encompassing metaphor for the natural life cycles on both Earth and Pandora, as lava destroys everything but also plants the seeds for new ecosystems.

 3  The True Destiny of Sigourney Weaver&#39;s Kiri 
Is Sigourney Weaver&#39;s Kiri the key to understanding Pandora and Eywa?


 







Birthed by Grace Augustine&#39;s avatar Na&#39;vi body and also voiced by sci-fi legend Sigourney Weaver - Kiri is poised to become the most pivotal character in the Avatar saga. It&#39;s certainly no coincidence that a Na&#39;vi with five fingers - the sign of an outsider - has an uncanny connection to the planet&#39;s sentient biological network. From Kiri&#39;s backstory to her visions of Grace, Kiri could be the key to understanding and communing with Eywa. She could either become the RDA&#39;s greatest weapon, the Na&#39;vi clans&#39; salvation, or a dangerous messiah who turns the tables on Earth. The sequels are bound to resolve the many unanswered questions about Avatar&#39;s Kiri.





 2  The Future Of Quaritch And Spider&#39;s Relationship 
How will this father-son relationship evolve in the Avatar sequels?
        

The darkly comedic dynamic between the Recombinant RDA soldier Quaritch and his biological human son Spider is one of the most popular parts of Avatar 2. Apart from arguably having the best back-and-forth dialogue in the film, Quaritch and Spider&#39;s relationship is founded on their compelling backstories, with both being birthed by the circumstances of the war on Pandora. Interestingly, audiences have noted that - despite Quaritch still being a despicable villain - his overall penchant for war crimes has decreased after spending time with Spider. Meanwhile, even though Spider returned to the Na&#39;vi, how he saved Quaritch in Avatar 2 suggests that their tense interactions are far from over.

Avatar: The Way of Water debuted Spider, Quaritch&#39;s son and close friend to the Sully&#39;s, and he&#39;ll become an important player in the Avatar sequels.








 1  The True Nature Of Eywa And Pandora&#39;s Sentient Network 
Who or what is Eywa exactly?
        

Also known as the All-Mother or Great Mother, Eywa is the sole deity of the Na&#39;vi people - a sentient force responsible for maintaining Pandora&#39;s natural balance. While Eywa is the most mysterious entity in Avatar, she is clearly a cinematic metaphor for bridging traditional real-world mysticism with evolution theory. Whereas superstition shrouds human spiritual rituals, Na&#39;vi spirituality and biology are inherently linked - ultimately suggesting that Earth&#39;s religions stem from the same well of wisdom as Pandora&#39;s sentient network. For either the Na&#39;vi, the RDA, or the viewers, Eywa&#39;s true nature remains uncertain, and it&#39;s one of the mysteries that audiences are looking forward to solving in Avatar&#39;s sequels.
