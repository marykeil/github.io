## Literature Review

The animated Mortal Kombat movies did plenty of things right that the filmmakers behind the upcoming live-action sequel should consider.




The upcoming movie sequel Mortal Kombat 2 stands to learn valuable lessons from the franchise&#39;s animated films. The success of the animated movies lies in their adept prioritization of the martial arts tournament and the nuanced exploration of character motivations, which significantly deepened their narrative experience. To emulate this triumph, Mortal Kombat 2 should follow the core theme of the tournament but ensure it receives ample focus on producing a story where the outcome genuinely matters to its viewers. Delving into character motivations with care, as demonstrated by the animated adaptations, can further enrich the storyline, forging a stronger connection between the audience and the characters.
The Mortal Kombat reboot&#39;s mistake of neglecting the tournament aspect in favor of other plot elements serves as a cautionary tale for the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2. By learning from the animated films&#39; success and the 2021 reboot&#39;s missteps, the upcoming movie can strike a delicate balance between showcasing thrilling martial arts action within the tournament framework and delving into the deeper motivations of its characters. This strategic amalgamation promises to deliver a Mortal Kombat cinematic experience that honors the franchise&#39;s roots while engaging and resonating with a broader audience.
            
 
 It’s Too Late For Mortal Kombat 2 To Fix The 2021 Reboot’s Missing Tournament Mistake 
Mortal Kombat 2 will correct the 2021 film&#39;s mistake and include the actual tournament, but it&#39;s too late for that to be the sequel&#39;s sole focus.












 








 9  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs To Balance Intense Action With Compelling Plot 
The animated Mortal Kombat films pair fantastic action with a meaningful plot.
        

The animated Mortal Kombat films feature meticulously crafted plots while, in stark contrast, the 2021 live-action reboot sees too much focus on action, which is worsened by its choppy pacing. Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#39;s Revenge is an exemplary model, striking a harmonious balance and offering a superior portrayal of Hanzo Hasashi’s backstory. The upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 developers should heed this lesson, emphasizing equilibrium between action and plot. A seamless blend of the IP&#39;s iconically visceral battle sequences with a strong plot that supports its unique characters will go a long way toward creating a memorable experience for older and newer fans.
            
 
 Mortal Kombat 2 Can Finally Deliver A Fatality To A 28-Year Franchise Record 
Mortal Kombat 2 can finally overcome a 28-year-old franchise record that would see the sequel become the most successful Mortal Kombat movie yet.








 8  Mortal Kombat 2 Should Focus On A Few Characters &amp; Develop Them Well 
The animated Mortal Kombat films focused on only a few characters and invested in them.


 







The Mortal Kombat animated films distinguish themselves by prioritizing character depth without sacrificing the franchise’s legendary bloody violence. Just as important, they give their characters enough time to coalesce into people that audiences care for. The 2021 live-action reboot, on the other hand, grapples with an expansive cast lacking sufficient development, leaving some characters feeling underutilized compared to their animated counterparts. The vital lesson for the creators of Mortal Kombat 2 lies in concentrating on a select few characters and giving them enough time to coalesce into something that genuinely resonates with audiences. Doing so will ensure their stories are developed properly for maximum impact.





 7  Mortal Kombat 2 Should Build Dynamic Relationships Through Chemistry 
The animated Mortal Kombat movies depended on banter and relationships to bring their characters to life.


 







Aside from outstanding character development, the Mortal Kombat animated films flourished by highlighting relationships enriched with authentic and believable chemistry. This is because the characters are developed through their connections with others. The emphasis on such chemistry allows these animated adaptations to narrate stories through characters that leave a lasting impact. Unfortunately, the 2021 live-action Mortal Kombat reboot suffers from stiff interactions that feel contrived. The crucial takeaway for developers working on the upcoming sequel is to prioritize genuine chemistry among characters and strong performances from Mortal Kombat 2&#39;s cast. By doing so, they ensure the emotional impact of those relationships, thus elevating the overall storytelling.

 6  Mortal Kombat 2 Should Include Interesting Subplots To Enhance The Overall Narrative 
The animated Mortal Kombat films use subplots to add dimensions to their narratives.
        

The Mortal Kombat franchise&#39;s animated films expertly layer in interesting subplots that add depth and complexity to the overarching story, elevating character development and enriching the narrative. Characters&#39; personal journeys are interwoven seamlessly with these subplots, providing viewers with a more immersive experience. Conversely, the 2021 live-action reboot suffers from having underwhelming subplots that are inadequately explored or add no value to the main story, resulting in a missed opportunity for narrative richness. The primary lesson for Mortal Kombat 2&#39;s filmmakers is to not only introduce well-crafted subplots but also ensure they are intricately connected, meaningfully contributing to character development and enriching the overall storyline.





 5  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs Better Pacing 
The animated Mortal Kombat films are very well-paced.
        

The animated movies in the Mortal Kombat franchise excel by maintaining a consistent and engaging pace, balancing action sequences with moments of character development for a greater viewing experience. Conversely, the 2021 live-action reboot has uneven pacing, alternating between intense action and slower segments, impacting the movie&#39;s overall flow and coherence. Notably, the animated films Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#39;s Revenge and Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind showcase intentionally measured pacing that enhances the plot’s high points. Remarkably, none of the animated movies demonstrate poor pacing. Developers of Mortal Kombat 2 need to prioritize consistent and engaging pacing to deliver a story that’s both immersive and impactful from start to finish.





 4  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs To Focus On The Tournament &amp; Character Motivations 
The animated Mortal Kombat films capture character motivation, making the tournament more impactful.


 







The Mortal Kombat animated films focus on the martial arts tournament and explore character motivations, thus adding depth to their involvement. Conversely, the 2021 live-action Mortal Kombat reboot insufficiently showcases the tournament with an overwhelmed cast that is easy to forget. The animated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#39;s Revenge effectively integrates both aspects, highlighting character backstories so that their reasons for participating in the tournament make perfect sense. Despite variations in execution, none of the animated movies fail to underscore the tournament and character motivations. The primary lesson for developers crafting Mortal Kombat 2 is to re-emphasize the tournament theme but consider making participation personal, so viewers are adequately invested.





 3  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs To Dive Into Lore, Backstories, &amp; World-Building 
The animated Mortal Kombat films use lore to establish narrative depth.
        

Even though Mortal Kombat is mostly known for its tournaments, the franchise also has a wealth of other material to pull from to ensure its characters and world come to life onscreen. Notably, the animated films Mortal Kombat Legends: Scoprion&#39;s Revenge and Mortal Kombat Legends: Snow Blind excel in exploring the franchise&#39;s lore and expanding its world. In contrast, the 2021 live-action reboot failed to delve deep enough into Mortal Kombat’s surprisingly rich lore and character backgrounds, with perceived limitations in world-building. The key takeaway is that no movie suffers for having a good story, but even a Mortal Kombat movie can suffer for having a bad one.





 2  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs To Be Consistent With Humor &amp; Tone 
The animated Mortal Kombat films use consistent tones to support their engaging narratives.
        

The Mortal Kombat animated films succeed by maintaining a consistent balance of humor and tone, enhancing the overall narrative. The humor is seamlessly integrated, complementing the darker tone without undermining it. In contrast, the 2021 reboot suffers from tonal inconsistencies, where serious and humorous elements clash, creating an uneven balance that detracts from the film&#39;s impact. At least three of the animated films benefit tremendously by peppering humor into their scripts, and none of the animated movies demonstrate poor execution in maintaining a consistent tone. The primary lesson here for developers creating Mortal Kombat 2 is to balance humor and tone for a cohesive and enjoyable cinematic experience.





 1  Mortal Kombat 2 Needs To Include The Right Amount Of Campiness 
The animated Mortal Kombat films respect the source material without taking it too seriously.
        

There’s a certain amount of campiness in the video games that has added to Mortal Kombat’s charm over the years, and the animated movies in the franchise do right by embracing it. They recognize the franchise&#39;s roots and integrate campy elements without compromising overall quality. Conversely, the 2021 live-action Mortal Kombat movie takes itself too seriously, lacking the playful spirit seen in its animated counterparts. Notably, the animated film Mortal Kombat Legends: Cage Match successfully embraces a level of campiness, contributing to rather than detracting from the film&#39;s entertainment value. The filmmakers behind Mortal Kombat 2 need to embrace the franchise&#39;s playful spirit by incorporating the right amount of campiness.
