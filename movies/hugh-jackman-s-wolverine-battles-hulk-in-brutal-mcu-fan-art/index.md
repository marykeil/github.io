## Literature Review

Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine battles the MCU&#39;s Hulk in some shocking new fan art, depicting an iconic battle between the two Marvel powerhouses.




Ahead of his debut in Deadpool 3, Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine has been depicted battling the Hulk in brutal new MCU fan art. Hugh Jackman portrayed James &#34;Logan&#34; Howlett, a.k.a. Wolverine, between 2000&#39;s X-Men and 2017&#39;s Logan in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, and despite retiring from the role after Logan, Jackman was confirmed to be returning as Wolverine for Marvel Studios&#39; Deadpool 3 in September 2022. While Jackman is reprising his iconic role in the MCU&#39;s Phase 5, a new actor is expected to don Wolverine&#39;s claws in the MCU&#39;s future, creating the opportunity for one of Marvel Comics&#39; most iconic battles between Wolverine and the Hulk to be depicted in live-action.




Marvel Comics&#39; The Incredible Hulk #180, released in 1974, saw Bruce Banner&#39;s Hulk battle a Wendigo in a Canadian forest, though the pair are soon interrupted by Wolverine in his debut appearance. This battle has since gone down in history as the perfect introduction to Wolverine, but has never been adapted into live-action, as the characters&#39; film rights previously resided with different studios. However, with Wolverine soon coming to the MCU, the opportunity is finally there for him to battle Mark Ruffalo&#39;s Hulk, and this epic fight has been depicted in some stunning fan art shared by Esheffects, proving the strength and brutality of both of these almost-feral superhuman characters.

 What We Know About Wolverineâ€™s MCU Introduction 
         




The details of Wolverine&#39;s introduction into the MCU proper haven&#39;t yet been revealed, and likely won&#39;t be until Deadpool 3 releases on July 26, 2024. However, with Ryan Reynolds&#39; Deadpool making the move to the MCU permanently after debuting in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, there&#39;s no doubt that Deadpool 3 will be exploring a multiversal storyline that suggests Hugh Jackman will be portraying the same iteration of the clawed mutant from previous projects. This means Deadpool 3 will likely be set before the events of Logan, as the film&#39;s 2029-set storyline ended with Wolverine&#39;s death. However, this fails to take into account the Wolverine teases that the MCU has already showcased.

Phase 4&#39;s She-Hulk: Attorney at Law included several hints at the existence of Wolverine in the MCU&#39;s current continuity, especially when referencing a man fighting with &#34;metal claws&#34; in a bar brawl, and with Nikki&#39;s &#34;SNIKT&#34; moment with make-up brushes. These teases suggest a version of Wolverine is already active in the MCU, prior to Hugh Jackman&#39;s return in Deadpool 3, though Marvel Studios hasn&#39;t yet confirmed who will sport the claws after Jackman finally bids farewell to the role. With an X-Men reboot in development at Marvel Studios, it may not be too long before a new version of Wolverine makes his way into the MCU.
