## Literature Review

While American Fiction&#39;s themes of remaining true to oneself are well-written, there are other movies with similar subjects that are just as good.




American Fiction&#39;s comedic take on the trappings that many Black artists experience in the entertainment industry is the most recent addition to a genre rife with similar movies. While filled with plenty of somber moments, American Fiction is a satirical comedy that sees a Black novelist write a stereotypically Black novel as a tongue-in-cheek critique of the industry in which he&#39;s a part of, and his frustrations associated with the critical and financial success it garners him. Despite American Fiction&#39;s brilliant storytelling, hilarious moments, and stellar acting performances, it isn&#39;t the only movie in the genre to cover similar subjects.
Throughout cinematic history, Black filmmakers have prided themselves on tackling controversial and often avoided issues of race, class, socioeconomic gaps, and America&#39;s early history through the lense of a perspective rarely seen in mainstream Hollywood. As such, cleverly-written films in various genres have invited White audiences to reassess their perspectives on issues of class and race while also encouraging Black viewers to take pride in their culture and history. While American Fiction is the most recent film to analyze controversial subjects through the lense of comedy, plenty of quality satires have come before it that are just as poignant, thought-provoking, and impactful.

 10  Bowfinger (1999) 
Frank Oz&#39;s comedy examines mental health and the hypocrisy of overly ambitious entertainers
        

Written by star Steve Martin and directed by Frank Oz, Bowfinger sees Martin as a downtrodden B-movie filmmaker struggling to finance his upcoming movie, thus forcing him to resort to unscrupulous means to get the film made. Bowfinger examines the seriousness of one&#39;s mental health through Murphy&#39;s perpetually paranoid Kit Ramsey character while simultaneously highlighting the hypocrisy of tenacious filmmakers in a cautionary tale of exploitation. While Bowfinger feels Hollywood is taking advantage of him, he fails to realize he&#39;s doing the same thing with Kit&#39;s meek twin brother, Jiff, thus highlighting Bowfinger&#39;s - and, by relation, American Fiction&#39;s themes of exploitation in a particularly meta manner.





 9  CB4 (1993) 
Chris Rock stars in the satire about rappers and maintaining their image
        

CB4 sees Chris Rock as Albert Brown / M.C. Gusto, a popular rapper who steals the identity of a notorious crime lord to help boost his sales and popularity even further. Despite focusing more on the entertainment industry, CB4 still tackles similar themes of identity and the politics associated with it while weaving in obvious and not-so-obvious references to many popular rap acts and solo artists of the late 80s-early 90s. CB4&#39;s mockumentary style satire also underlines the ridiculous depths that many real-life rap artists will sink to in order to maintain an image that&#39;s ultimately meant to entertain people.





 8  Dear White People (2014) 
Dear White People&#39;s themes center around class, race, and the wealth gap&#39;s impact on education
        

The lives of four Black students are chronicled in writer-director Justin Simien&#39;s satirical black comedy that examines race, class, and the identity politics associated with people of color being accepted into prestigious organizations. As the name suggests, Dear White People is geared toward a White audience just as much as any other, and the film&#39;s sharp wit, clever dialogue, and impeccable visual storytelling aid immensely in getting across its themes. Furthermore, the dynamic relationships between the different Black students underlines an oft neglected conversation in the Black community - the dilemma of being considered Black enough while in pursuit of upward social and economic mobility.





 7  Watermelon Man (1970) 
Melvin Van Peebles&#39;s 70s comedy examines race and identity politics
        

Melvin Van Peebles&#39;s Watermelon Man is a satire that sees a racist White man named Jeff Gerber and the shenanigans that ensue after he gradually turns into a Black man. Rife with many sharp jokes and socioeconomic subtext, Watermelon Man&#39;s absurd plot and overt dialogue is effective in simulating the racist sensibilities that many Black Americans had to endure and overcome during America&#39;s past. Additionally, Watermelon Man challenges Black viewers to examine their station in life with a more critical eye, and consider what role they play in their culture&#39;s checkered reputation. Scathing and hilarious, Watermelon Man is one of Hollywood&#39;s more unique takes on the issue of race.





 6  Blazing Saddles (1974) 
Mel Brooks&#39;s classic comedy examines and critiques race and racism against the Western genre
        

Blazing Saddles is one of the best Western comedies of all time and the distinction is attributable to the film&#39;s superb acting performances, subversion of tropes closely associated with both Westerns and comedies, and because of its witty screenplay. Blazing Saddles sees an unscrupulous White politician devise a plan to hire a Black sheriff for a racist town in an effort to run its citizens out of town, thus granting him access to millions of dollars in real estate. Filled with visual gags and double entendre jokes, underneath the laughs lies a classic that intelligently observes and critiques the ridiculous nature of racism, mob-like thinking, and one&#39;s identity in America.
        


  Blazing Saddles  
Written and directed by Mel Brooks, Blazing Saddles stars Cleavon Little as Bart, a black sheriff appointed in a small frontier town by Hedley Lamarr, a railroad man who believes Bart&#39;s appointment will destabilize the town enough to drive everyone out and allow him to build a new railroad line through it. Instead, with the help of gunslinger Jim the Waco Kid, Bart works to thwart Lamarr&#39;s schemes. Gene Wilder and Harvey Korman star alongside Little.  

  Release Date    February 7, 1974     Director    Mel Brooks     Cast    Cleavon Little , gene wilder , Slim Pickens , Harvey Korman , Madeline Kahn , Mel Brooks     Runtime    93 minutes    







 5  Tropic Thunder (2008) 
Ben Stiller&#39;s Tropic Thunder challenges the impact Hollywood can have on an actor&#39;s mental health


 







Tropic Thunder sees a film crew unintentionally becoming embroiled in a real-life war while shooting their upcoming war movie in Vietnam. Filled with many memorable performances, gags, and violence, Tropic Thunder offers a fresh take on the absurd lengths Hollywood will sometimes go through to get a movie made. Chiefly among the absurdism on display is Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s role as Kirk Lazarus, a White Australian actor, and his borderline obsession with portraying a Black man as accurately as possible. Downey Jr.&#39;s performance is instrumental in the film getting across its points about the dangers of Blackface and underrepresentation in mainstream Hollywood, thus justifying Tropic Thunder&#39;s use of Blackface.





 4  Sorry To Bother You (2018) 
Sorry to Bother You is Boots Riley&#39;s scathing think-piece about capitalism and identity 
  Sorry to Bother You  


  Release Date    July 13, 2018     Director    Boots Riley     Cast    Omari Hardwick , Steven Yeun , Tessa Thompson , Michael X. Sommers , Armie Hammer , Jermaine Fowler , Kate Berlant , Forest Whitaker , LaKeith Stanfield , Terry Crews , Danny Glover , Robert Longstreet     Runtime    112minutes    




 







Sorry to Bother You is Boots Riley&#39;s 2018 critique of capitalism&#39;s impact on an overworked and underpaid society, as well as an examination of Black millennials and their struggle to get ahead in America while also maintaining their Blackness. Filled with homages to the works of Michel Gondry, strong performances from its cast, and plenty of tongue-in-cheek jokes that effectively highlight the film&#39;s themes, Sorry to Bother You is not only one of the best anti-capitalist movies around, but it&#39;s also an excellent cautionary tale about greed and its trappings. As LaKeith Stanfiled&#39;s Cassius Green goes deeper down the socioeconomic rabbit hole, he loses sight of his morals and ethics.





 3  Bamboozled (2000) 
Spike Lee&#39;s 2000 joint compares the modern day stereotypes in Hollywood to Jim Crow-era minstrelsy


 







Spike Lee&#39;s Bamboozled sees the auteur tackle issues of one struggling to maintain his integrity while also in pursuit of status, fame, and riches, by comparing the gradual moral decay of its protagonists to that of Jim Crow-era minstrelsy. Filled with much of Lee&#39;s usual no-filter commentary on racism and racist institutions, Bamboozled is unique in that it doesn&#39;t shy away from the role that its Black characters play in perpetuating negative stereotypes by highlighting the disorganization in the community. While the main issue in Bamboozled still lies in powerful people abusing their position, the movie&#39;s insistence on showing the victims victimizing themselves gives Bamboozled another layer of commentary.





 2  Putney Swope (1969) 
Robert Downey Sr. critiques racism in politics and business in Putney Swope
        

Putney Swope sees a Black man named Putney accidentally inherit the position of chairman at a prestigious ad agency after its all White employees arrogantly vote for the one person they assumed would never win, Putney. Robert Downey, Sr.&#39;s Putney Swope examines the absurdity of the pandemonium that ensues after the company&#39;s White figureheads assume the company won&#39;t last under Putney&#39;s leadership. Despite their worst fears, Putney&#39;s bizarre leadership style earns him the respect of many in a film rife with commentary about the irrational fears of people of color rising to prominence and being effective in roles often seen as best reserved for White people.





 1  Hollywood Shuffle (1987) 
Rober Townsend&#39;s Hollywood Shuffle closes examines the stereotypes Black actors face in Hollywood casting
        

  American Fiction  


  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Cord Jefferson     Cast    Jeffrey Wright , Tracee Ellis Ross , John Ortiz , erika alexander , Leslie Uggams , Adam Brody​ , Keith David , Issa Rae , Sterling K. Brown     Runtime    117 Minutes    


Hollywood Shuffle sees a Black actor named Bobby Taylor gradually become disillusioned with his aspirations of becoming a successful actor after receiving a string of racially insensitive roles rooted in negative stereotypes about Black men. Although Hollywood Shuffle&#39;s failure to properly address the issues pertaining to stereotypes of homosexuals and women in entertainment, the film excels in portraying the potentially damaging impact that Hollywood&#39;s negative stereotypes have on both the Black community and outsider perception of said community. Hollywood Shuffle&#39;s examination of Black creatives maintaining their integrity while pursuing social advancement is not only a trailblazer in Black cinema, but American Fiction&#39;s success at carrying the torch solidifies its legacy.
