## Literature Review

Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s final 2023 movie, Dunki, reaches a major milestone at the global box office, proving a great comeback year for the Bollywood actor.




Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s final 2023 movie, Dunki, has reached a global box office milestone. Hot off the critical and commercial successes of Pathaan and Jawan, SRK&#39;s comeback year concluded with the comedy-drama Dunki, directed by Rajkumar Hirani and also starred Taapsee Pannu and Vicky Kaushal. In the Bollywood film, Khan plays Hardy Singh Dhillon, an ex-army officer who guides a group of people through the &#34;Dunki&#34; route from Laltu to London after they couldn&#39;t secure a visa to immigrate to the United Kingdom legally.




According to Collider, Dunki has now grossed over $50 million at the global box office. While falling short of reaching the $80 million collection that the Prabhas-led Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire grossed, the latest update for the Indian comedy raises Khan&#39;s combined 2023 box office total to $320 million. In addition, Dunki is now the fourth highest-grossing movie of SRK&#39;s career and could overtake the gross of 2015&#39;s Dilwale to become the third highest-grossing film for the Bollywood actor once its theatrical run ends.

 2023 Was A Massive Bollywood Year For Shah Rukh Khan 
          




After a five-year hiatus from acting caused by critical and commercial duds, Khan returned to the big screen with full force in the Siddharth Anand-directed Pathaan, the fourth installment in the highly lucrative YRF Spy Universe. The action blockbuster also saw him re-team with Deepika Padukone, who broke out in Bollywood after appearing alongside him in 2007&#39;s Om Shanti Om. Khan also briefly reprised the character of Pathaan a few months later in Maneesh Sharma&#39;s Tiger 3, where he broke out Avinash &#34;Tiger&#34; Singh Rathore (Salman Khan) from an army prison and is set to go toe-to-toe against him in Tiger vs. Pathaan, which Anand will also direct.

                  Why Shah Rukh Khan Plays Both Father AND Son In Jawan   The Bollywood film Jawan has become a huge success, and it is unique in that it has Shah Rukh Khan playing two huge roles in it.    

In September of last year, Khan led his second blockbuster with Jawan. The action movie obliterated box office records he had set with Pathaan, emerging as the highest-grossing Indian film of 2023 and the highest-grossing of Khan&#39;s entire career. Jawan is also the second-highest-grossing Hindi-language movie ever, only behind Aamir Khan&#39;s 2016 sports movie, Dangal. In the film, Khan plays the dual role of Azad and Vikram Rathore, who team up to take down weapons dealer Kalee (Vijay Sethupathi). The movie was praised by critics upon its release and is regarded as one of Khan&#39;s biggest career achievements.






Jawan was the Hindi-language film debut of director Atlee, who is well-known in the Tamil industry with projects such as Theri, Mersal, and Bigil.




Khan collaborated with 3 Idiots filmmaker Hirani to bring Dunki to life and went head-to-head at the box office with the Prashanth Neel-directed Salaar: Part 1 - Ceasefire. Fresh off of the massive success of K.G.F: Chapter 2, Neel made his Telugu debut with Bahubali star Prabhas, who came back in full force after Om Raut&#39;s Adipurush bombed at the box office. Salaar: Part 1&#39;s total gross beat Dunki at the box office, but Khan still emerged on top with the combined gross of his three films. As a result, the actor reclaimed his throne as the King of Bollywood after his most successful year ever.
