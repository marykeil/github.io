## Literature Review

A new business deal is now in place regarding the future of the John Wick and Highlander franchises as Lionsgate looks to expand both properties.




A new update arrives for John Wick and Highlander, with Lionsgate taking a big step forward with both franchises. Released in 2016, the first John Wick movie ushered in a new era for action cinema, introducing Keanu Reeves as the eponymous assassin, with Chad Stahelski in the director&#39;s chair. Stahelski would return for each subsequent sequel and is considered a big reason for the franchise&#39;s success, and he is now poised to direct a Highlander reboot starring Henry Cavill.




Per a new report from Deadline, Stahelski has now inked a new deal with Lionsgate in what marks a big development for the John Wick franchise and Highlander. Stahelski and his team at 87Eleven action design will oversee the creative aspects of both franchises, with the filmmaker set to design a &#34;comprehensive multi-platform content strategy&#34; for both properties.



The first three John Wick movies are available to stream on Netflix while John Wick: Chapter 4 is streaming on Starz. Highlander is streaming on Prime Video.




  


 Why The John Wick &amp; Highlander Update Is Good News 
          




While Reeves&#39; stoic performance and impressive dedication to doing his own action scenes is certainly a big reason why the John Wick movies have achieved such impressive levels of success, the impact of Stahelski&#39;s direction and creative vision cannot be overstated. The filmmaker, who was once a stunt performer himself, evidently knows how to plan, film, and edit action better than many of his contemporaries, and his executive producer role has allowed him to oversee the larger trajectory of the franchise.

It remains to be seen whether Stahelski and Reeves will reteam for the announced John Wick 5, but the franchise is essentially guaranteed to continue regardless. With that being the case, it&#39;s certainly good news that Stahelski will be a key figure involved creatively moving forward. Even if he&#39;s not necessarily in the director&#39;s chair for future installments (such as with Ballerina, the Ana de Armas-led spinoff), this new deal essentially ensures that Stahelski&#39;s stamp of approval will be on every John Wick project moving forward.






Regarding John Wick 5, Stahelski recently affirmed that he and Reeves are open to another installment, but that a good story idea has not yet presented itself.




The Cavill Highlander reboot hasn&#39;t even entered into production yet (it&#39;s set to film this year), but Stahelski&#39;s new Lionsgate deal suggests that this movie is intended to be a franchise-starter. Whether that comes to pass will depend on how well the film performs at the box office, but Cavill, Stahelski, and John Wick-level action definitely sounds like a recipe for success. Although it&#39;s unclear what Stahelski&#39;s involvement will be as a director in these two franchises over the next few years, this new development means they are both in good hands.
