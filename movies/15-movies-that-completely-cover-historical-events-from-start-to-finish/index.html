  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Movies often focus on specific aspects of historical events, but some films aim to give a complete and accurate interpretation.
Films like &ldquo;Valkyrie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Downfall,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Waterloo&rdquo; provide a detailed and accurate account of historical events, from assassination attempts to battles.
Movies like &ldquo;The Big Short&rdquo; help make complex events easy to understand.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>While many films focus on historical events, few cover the complete event from start to finish. Here are 15 that provide a full picture of history.</p>
<p>Major events have inspired historical movies since the early years of cinema, yet many films fail to give the whole picture. Filmmakers often focus on specific aspects of particular episodes to better illustrate important themes in their wider story, or only explore the narrative from one character&rsquo;s perspective. While this can help make the movies themselves more entertaining, it also means that audiences get an incomplete interpretation of history. Some great history films, however, take a different approach.
Whether it&rsquo;s about dissecting the exact timeline of a battle, unpacking a moment of major social upheaval, or giving full context to what might seem like an isolated spasm of change, a few movies take great care to give the full story. In many cases, such as the dramatic retellings displayed in Waterloo and Zulu, the real stories are so dramatic that simply putting them on screen for all to see is engaging enough. In others, like The Big Short, the events themselves might be so opaque that telling the story from start to finish is the only real way to understand what&rsquo;s going on. Whatever the approach, these 15 films prove that covering historical events completely doesn&rsquo;t have to conflict with great storytelling.</p>
<p>Cleopatra: 10 Historically Accurate Films About Famous Women In History
From politicians to NASA scientists, these films about famous women are some of the best when it comes to factual accuracy.</p>
<p>15  Valkyrie (2008)
The Plot To Kill Hitler</p>
<p>valkyrie</p>
<p>Director    Bryan Singer     Cast    Tom Cruise , Eddie Izzard , Bill Nighy , Kenneth Branagh     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    2h 4m     Genres    War , Thriller , Action</p>
<p>Starring Tom Cruise as real-life figure Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, Valkyrie is a dramatic retelling of one of the few serious internal attempts to overthrow the Nazi regime. Taking its name from the eponymous Valkyrie plot, the film follows von Stauffenberg and his gang of co-conspirators as they attempt to assassinate Hitler at his Wolf&rsquo;s Lair military headquarters and seize the levers of power in Berlin. Valkyrie includes all the key events – including the plot&rsquo;s ultimate failure and the precipitous moments where history could have changed forever – and the movie was generally praised by critics and historians for its accuracy.</p>
<p>14  Downfall (2004)
The Death Of Adolf Hitler</p>
<p>Featuring a powerhouse performance from Bruno Ganz, Downfall is a gripping and realistic window inside the Füherbunker during the final days of the Third Reich. Set largely during the climactic Battle of Berlin, the film sees Hitler slowly realize that his forces are destined for defeat, ultimately deciding to kill himself rather than surrender. Ganz studied the real Hitler for four months to prepare for the role, and Downfall was lauded for its accuracy on release – despite controversy around the decision to humanize some of the most notorious figures in history. However, as a way to understand the events up to and including Hitler&rsquo;s death, Downfall remains unsurpassed.</p>
<p>13  Waterloo (1970)
The Battle That Changed Europe</p>
<p>While many movies take liberties with famous military engagements, comparatively few seek to recreate entire battles exactly as they happened. Waterloo is one such example. Sergei Bondarchuk&rsquo;s wildly ambitious production deployed nearly 17,000 extras from the Soviet Reserve Army, giving the film a sense of genuine scale. The movie matched the timeline of the real battle almost precisely, painstakingly bringing the engagements at Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte back to life. While there are tiny quibbles, such as the failure to record the impact of the Royal Scots Greys&rsquo; cavalry charge (due to legitimate health and safety concerns), the movie is a very accurate account of the real Waterloo from start to finish.</p>
<p>12  Oppenheimer (2023)
The Manhattan Project</p>
<p>Oppenheimer<br>
9
/ 10</p>
<p>Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr. , Rami Malek , Florence Pugh     Rating    R     Runtime    150 Minutes     Genres    Drama , History , Biography</p>
<p>While Christopher Nolan is known for his idiosyncratic approach to storytelling, he is also incredibly adept at painting a complete historical picture. His 2023 release Oppenheimer is a prime example. Although the film is a detailed biopic focusing on many areas of the real Oppenheimer&rsquo;s life, it is also perhaps the most complete account of the Manhattan Project and its infamous results ever committed to the screen. In fact, Oppenheimer is so true to life that many of its scenes are taken word for word from first-hand accounts, with the movie providing a complete overview of the project from genesis to delivery.</p>
<p>11  Apollo 13 (1995)
An Averted Tragedy In Space</p>
<p>Apollo 13</p>
<p>Director    Ron Howard     Cast    Tom Hanks , Bill Paxton , Kevin Bacon , Gary Sinise , Ed Harris , Kathleen Quinlan     Rating    PG     Runtime    140 minutes     Genres    Adventure , Documentary , Drama , History</p>
<p>Whereas a film like Oppenheimer reveals the detail of a significant event within the broader context of a complete life, some movies focus entirely on the event itself – with Apollo 13 a prime example. Ron Howard&rsquo;s 1995 docudrama tells the complete incredible story of the titular spacecraft and its calamitous mission through the eyes of astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise. Using cutting edge techniques, the film painstakingly follows the exact timeline of the real disaster, revealing how an onboard explosion left the trio stranded and alone, forced to use all their ingenuity to avoid certain death. Acclaimed for its realism and commitment to history, Apollo 13 remains one of the most dramatic retellings ever seen.</p>
<p>10  Black Hawk Down (2001)
The Battle Of Mogadishu</p>
<p>Black Hawk Down</p>
<p>Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Jason Isaacs , Eric Bana , Josh Hartnett , Ewan McGregor , Tom Sizemore , Tom Hardy , Hugh Dancy , Orlando Bloom     Rating    R     Runtime    144 minutes     Genres    War , Drama , History</p>
<p>Boasting an incredible ensemble cast, Ridley Scott&rsquo;s Black Hawk Down is a gritty account of the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. Scott&rsquo;s film meticulously recreates the entire incident from start to finish, from the shooting down of the eponymous helicopters to the soldiers&rsquo; eventual escape from the city. Although some scenes attracted criticism for taking liberties with the truth, Black Hawk Down certainly covers all the major moments of the battle, providing a pretty accurate picture from multiple different perspectives.</p>
<p>10 Most Historically Accurate War Movies
Plenty of war movies have played fast and loose with history, but some provide startlingly accurate accounts of humanity&rsquo;s darkest moments.</p>
<p>9  The Big Short (2015)
The 2008 Financial Crisis</p>
<p>The Big Short</p>
<p>Director    Adam McKay     Cast    Brad Pitt , Melissa Leo , Ryan Gosling , Marisa Tomei , Steve Carell , Christian Bale     Rating    r     Runtime    130minutes     Genres    Drama</p>
<p>An excoriating, comedic, and at times terrifying exposé of Wall Street and the global financial system, The Big Short expertly managed to make one of the most complicated events in recent history easily understandable. Adam McKay&rsquo;s movie examines the events leading up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis from the perspectives of multiple outsiders betting against the market. From explaining the market innovations and changes that created the perfect climate for calamity to identifying how greed created an economic firestorm, The Big Short reveals how and why the crisis came to happen. It&rsquo;s humorous asides featuring Anthony Bourdain and Margot Robbie in a bubble bath may be tongue in cheek, but they undoubtedly help tell the full story.</p>
<p>8  Bloody Sunday (2002)
The Derry Civil Rights March</p>
<p>Originally intended to be a TV movie, director Paul Greengrass&rsquo; Bloody Sunday is widely lauded as one of the most harrowing and hard-hitting films about the Troubles ever made. Inspired by the book Eyewitness Bloody Sunday by Don Mullan, the movie recreated the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday massacre in Derry through the eyes of SDLP member Ivan Cooper (James Nesbitt). Originally intended as a civil rights protest, the march soon became a bloodbath when British soldiers opened fire, shooting 26 unarmed civilians and killing 14. The movie tells the full story of the march from the perspective of its leaders, offering a rare insight into a major tragedy.</p>
<p>7  Zulu (1964)
The Defence Of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift</p>
<p>Celebrating one of the most remarkable stories in British military history, Zulu doesn&rsquo;t need to take many liberties as its inspiration is already incredibly dramatic. Recounting the Battle of Rorke&rsquo;s Drift, the movie reveals how 150 British soldiers, including 30 severely injured and sick, held off an attacking force of 4000 Zulu warriors. Not only were the troops considerably outnumbered, but the Zulu forces had just days earlier inflicted a major defeat on a much larger British force at Isandlwana (recreated in the prequel Zulu Dawn). Although details differ from the real battle (such as in the portrayal of Henry Hook), Zulu is largely accurate and tells the story of the engagement from start to finish.</p>
<p>10 Most Realistic &amp; Accurate Scenes In War Movies
From the evacuation in Dunkirk to the church burning in Come and See, some shocking war movie scenes accurately capture the horrors of war.</p>
<p>6  The Death Of Stalin (2017)
The Ascension Of Khrushchev</p>
<p>Replete with writer and director Armando Ianucci&rsquo;s signature acerbic wit, The Death of Stalin is a blackly funny (and very realistic) account of the chaos that followed Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s death in 1953. While the film has a few notable inaccuracies (such as which personnel were in which positions at the time), it nonetheless provides an emotionally authentic account of the climate of fear permeating the Soviet Union, as well as the personal ambition, pettiness, and paranoia that defined its leadership. Furthermore, the film&rsquo;s account of Stalin&rsquo;s actual death is very accurate, drawing the detailed historical accounts available on the subject.</p>
<p>5  Selma (2014)
The Voting Rights March</p>
<p>Selma</p>
<p>Director    Ava DuVernay     Cast    Tim Roth , Carmen Ejogo , David Oyelowo , Tom Wilkinson     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    128minutes     Genres    History , Drama , Biography</p>
<p>A comprehensive recreation of one of the most important moments in American civil rights history, Selma has been rightly praised for its commitment to history. Telling the story of the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, the movie not only paints a detailed picture of the march itself but also provides valuable social context, including controversial figures like Governor George Wallace. Although some criticized the film for its portrayal of President Lyndon B. Johnson, Selma was also lauded for its incredibly faithful recreation of the march, including the aggressive actions of the police and the public response to the footage of the incident.</p>
<p>4  Dunkirk (2017)
The Rescue Mission</p>
<p>Dunkirk</p>
<p>Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Kenneth Branagh , Aneurin Barnard , Mark Rylance , Tom Hardy , James D&rsquo;Arcy , Jack Lowden , Cillian Murphy , Harry Styles , Fionn Whitehead , Barry Keoghan     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    106 minutes     Genres    History , Drama , Action</p>
<p>Another example of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s skill in breathing life into a famous historical event, Dunkirk weaves several separate stories and timeframes together in order to tell a single cohesive story. Focusing on the famous Second World War rescue mission, Dunkirk uses the perspective of the soldiers on the beach, pilots in the sky, and civilian sailors in England to explain who the daring extraction of 400,000 stranded servicemen was successfully carried out. Winning praise for its distinctive narrative approach and commitment to established fact, Dunkirk is widely recognized as one of the most accurate World War Two movies and ranks among Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s best films to date – in no small part thanks to its complete depiction of history.</p>
<p>3  Tora, Tora, Tora! (1970)
The Attack On Pearl Harbor</p>
<p>While the events of Pearl Harbor have been recreated several times in movie history (notably by Michael Bay in his eponymous 2001 blockbuster), no movie has shown the attack as accurately as Tora, Tora, Tora! The epic war movie, which was a shared endeavor by both Japanese and American filmmakers, reveals how the attack took place from the perspective of both sides. Not only are the events of the attack itself very accurately portrayed, but the film also shows how escalating tensions in the Pacific in the years prior made armed conflict almost inevitable. While Tora, Tora, Tora!&rsquo;s overall tone has been criticized as somewhat soulless, few critics can doubt its commitment to historical accuracy.</p>
<p>2  Titanic (1997)
The Infamous Sinking</p>
<p>Titanic</p>
<p>Director    James Cameron     Cast    David Warner , Kathy Bates , Billy Zane , Bill Paxton , Bernard Hill , Kate Winslet , Leonardo DiCaprio , Gloria Stuart , Frances Fisher , Victor Garber     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    3h 14m     Genres    Drama , Romance</p>
<p>Although there are many aspects of James Cameron&rsquo;s beloved romance that take liberties with the truth (Rose and Jack&rsquo;s central love story being just one example), the movie undoubtedly paints a full and complete picture of the actual sinking of the boat itself. Spanning the entire duration of the voyage, the movie explains exactly how the ship broke into two pieces after being struck by an iceberg, making it much more realistic than recreations that had come before. This, plus the inclusion of several real characters, means that Titanic is a far more complete portrayal of history than many viewers may realize.</p>
<p>1  United 93 (2006)
The Attacks On 9/11</p>
<p>In some historical movies, accurately depicting recent events can be more difficult than recreating things from the distant past – often due to the emotions involved. United 93 shows how it can be done. The film is a psychologically intense representation of the events on board United Airlines Flight 93 during the September 11th attacks, showing not only how the plane&rsquo;s passengers prevented it from reaching its target, but also how events unfolded throughout the day. The film makes an effort to be as accurate as possible, even adhering to the real timeline to add to the authenticity. While the events aboard United 93 itself are the main focus, the movie also provides a complete picture of 9/11 in its entirety, making it a gripping and comprehensive account.</p>
