## Literature Review

A sequel to Ben Affleck&#39;s underrated 2016 thriller gets a promising update in a recent report indicating the follow-up will begin filming soon.




A sequel to Ben Affleck&#39;s underrated 2016 thriller The Accountant has received a positive update in a new report, indicating the movie will begin shooting later this year. The action film stars Affleck as Christian Wolff, an autistic accountant laundering money for criminal organizations. In the first movie, he goes on an action-packed crusade involving a conspiracy where tens of millions of dollars have vanished.




Now, Production List reports that The Accountant 2 is in development, with a filming start date listed for March 15, 2024. The page also reveals Affleck returning to star in the movie. In addition, the sequel will seemingly feature the return of Gavin O&#39;Connor as director and Bill Dubuque as writer.


 What Will Happen In The Accountant 2? 
          

The Affleck-led thriller received lukewarm reception from critics, who praised the lead actor&#39;s performance while criticizing the story. However, the movie was a decent box office success, earning $155.2 million against a $44 million budget. This led to talks of a sequel starting in June 2017, though there had been no strong indication as to when it would happen until this recent report.

The Accountant&#39;s ending offered a symbolic presentation of how Christian being on the autism spectrum didn&#39;t hinder him from his actions throughout the movie. The story also presented plenty of twists up until the very end, forming an unpredictable yet engaging narrative for the entire film. A similar approach for the sequel would make it just as much a sleeper hit, drawing from the structure of the original with a new plot.

Since the movie is going to start filming in March, it&#39;s possible concrete details on the story and a release window will arrive later this year. For now, it&#39;s unclear what the new story will bring and how many other actors might return.
