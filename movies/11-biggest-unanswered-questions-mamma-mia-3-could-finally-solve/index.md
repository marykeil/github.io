## Literature Review

Tons of questions remain unanswered from the first two Mamma Mia! movies, but if Mamma Mia! 3 ever happens, these mysteries could finally be solved.




With talk of a potential Mamma Mia 3, all the questions that linger from Mamma Mia! (2008) and especially Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018) could finally be answered. Mamma Mia! follows Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried), a young soon-to-be bride who invites her three potential fathers to her wedding without telling her mother, Donna (Meryl Streep). The first sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, follows Sophie&#39;s grand re-opening of the Hotel Bella Donna after Donna&#39;s death a year prior. Present-day events are interspersed with flashbacks to Donna&#39;s life before Sophie was born, showing how she met each of the three men who became Sophie&#39;s potential fathers.
There have been hints and whispers that the Mamma Mia! franchise will be getting a third installment. If Mamma Mia 3 happens, it could center around Sophie and Sky (Dominic Cooper) raising their son, Donny, who is born at the end of the first sequel.Similar to Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Mamma Mia 3 could also intersperse flashbacks of Sophie&#39;s life up until the events of Mamma Mia! Regardless of the premise, if there ever is a Mamma Mia 3, there are many lingering questions left to be answered and mysteries yet to be solved.
            
 
 &#34;I Know There’s A Trilogy There&#34;: Mamma Mia! 3 Gets Confident Update From Creator 
Mamma Mia! 3 receives a confident update from creator and producer Judy Craymer who says &#34;I know there’s a trilogy there&#34; regarding a third movie.












 








 11  How Did Sophie &amp; Sky Meet? 
Their origin story is never shared in the first two Mamma Mia! movies.
        

In Mamma Mia!, Sophie and Sky&#39;s first time meeting is referenced in the lyrics of their duet, &#34;Lay All Your Love On Me.&#34; It&#39;s implied that they hit it off immediately, as Sophie sings, &#34;A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck,&#34; and,2 &#34;A grown-up woman should never fall so easily,&#34; also confirming that they met as adults. However, the specific details of how, when, and where they met are never revealed.
In the first movie, Sky says that he met Sophie while he was &#34;traveling to find [him]self.&#34; However, when they fell in love and got engaged, he &#34;put everything on hold&#34; for her. If Mamma Mia 3 focuses on Sophie and Sky&#39;s new life as parents, their origin story as a couple could be revealed through flashbacks of Sophie&#39;s life before the first movie.

 10  What Is Sky&#39;s Backstory &amp; Where Is His Family? 
Sky&#39;s past is largely unknown in the Mamma Mia! franchise.
        

Giving context to how Sophie and Sky met would also give Mamma Mia 3 the opportunity to provide more details about Sky&#39;s backstory, like where he&#39;d been traveling when they met, where he&#39;s originally from, and what the deal is with his family. None of Sky&#39;s family members appear to be present at Sky and Sophie&#39;s almost-wedding in the first movie, nor at their newborn baby&#39;s christening in the sequel, and he never mentions his parents, any siblings, or other relatives at all.
It seems odd that none of his family would want to be present for these major milestones in his life. It&#39;s possible that Sky is estranged from his family, or that most if not all of his family members have passed away. Mamma Mia 3 could fill in these gaps in Sky&#39;s backstory, especially if it focuses more on Sophie and Sky&#39;s history and new family.





 9  Did Sophie &amp; Sky Ever Get Married Eventually? 
They bailed on their first wedding in the first Mamma Mia! movie.
        

The first Mamma Mia! centers around Sophie and Sky&#39;s wedding. While Sky just wants to &#34;take a boat to the mainland with a couple of witnesses&#34; to get married, Sophie insists on a &#34;big white wedding.&#34; However, when their wedding day finally arrives, Sophie tells Sky they shouldn&#39;t get married yet and should &#34;get off this island and see the world&#34; instead.
In Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Sophie and Sky are still together, but their relationship is strained.They eventually make up when Sky shows up for the opening and Sophie later reveals that she&#39;s pregnant. However, it&#39;s never established whether they ever officially got married, either before the events of that sequel, or before or after she gave birth to their son. Sophie does wear a diamond ring but on her middle finger, so it may not be a wedding ring. Mamma Mia 3 could clarify this detail and maybe even show Sophie and Sky tying the knot, even if they never had an actual ceremony.





 8  ​​What Happened To Sophie&#39;s Friends From Mamma Mia? 
Sophie&#39;s two best friends do not appear in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
        

In the first Mamma Mia! movie, Sophie&#39;s two best friends, Ali and Lisa, are her bridesmaids at the wedding. However, they&#39;re missing at the hotel opening in the sequel and their absence isn&#39;t acknowledged at all. It seems bizarre that neither of them showed up, especially since Sophie had lost her mother the year before and was still in mourning.
Since they arrive on the ferry in the first movie, Ali and Lisa obviously don&#39;t live on the island, so it&#39;s possible that their flight or ferry was canceled because of the storm. It&#39;s still strange that Sophie doesn&#39;t even mention their absence, so perhaps they all had a falling out, and Ali and Lisa weren&#39;t invited. This could all be explained in Mamma Mia 3, as well as the story of how the three of them met and became friends through flashbacks to Sophie&#39;s earlier life.





 7  How Did Donna Die? 
Her cause of death is not revealed in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
        

The details surrounding Donna&#39;s death are sparse in the sequel, including her cause of death. Ol Parker, the director of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, revealed that Donna died of cancer and that this was included in &#34;various different drafts,&#34; but it is never actually revealed in the sequel (via Business Insider). It had been decided that her cause of death wouldn&#39;t be &#34;sudden&#34; like a &#34;drowning,&#34; but rather &#34;something slow&#34; that her friends and family &#34;had time to get used to it while it was happening.&#34;
In the actual movie, though, all that is known is that she died a year before the events of the sequel. Donna&#39;s cause of death and the aftermath of her passing should be explored in Mamma Mia 3. Now that Sophie has a child of her own, she could tell her son all about his late grandmother, and paint a fuller picture of her final years betweenthe first and second movies.

 6  What Happened Between The End Of Mamma Mia! &amp; Donna&#39;s Death? 
There is a four-year period between the first movie and Donna&#39;s death in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.
        

Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again takes place five years after the end of the first movie, but by the time the sequel begins, Donna has already been gone for a year. At some point during the four years between the end of the first movie and Donna&#39;s death, she was diagnosed with cancer, but not much else is known about what happened during that period. For instance, it&#39;s never mentioned where Sophie and Sky went traveling or when they came back to Kalokairi.
In the first movie, Sam also encourages Sophie to pursue her artistic talents instead of feeling obligated to stay on the island to help Donna run the hotel after she gets married. She does leave to go traveling, but it&#39;s never mentioned whether Sophie ever tried to pursue a career as an artist, and if so, if she had to put her plans on hold to take over the hotel when Donna died. Will she ever try to become an artist for real, or is the hotel her life now?





 5  How Much Time Had Sophie Spent With Her Grandmother Ruby Before Mamma Mia 2? 
Sophie and Ruby did not have a close relationship before Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.


 







At the beginning of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Sophie addresses an invitation to her grandmother, Ruby Sheridan —Donna&#39;s estranged mother (played by Cher) — but she changes her mind and rips it up, claiming that she &#34;never shows up anyway.&#34; However, with Sky&#39;s help, Ruby does show up at the hotel opening and tells Sophie she&#39;s decided to commit to being a grandmother. Sophie points out that she&#39;s &#34;25 years too late,&#34; indicating that Ruby has never made much of an effort to have a relationship with her granddaughter. This much is clear, but there are many questions still lingering about their history.
When Donna got pregnant with Sophie, Ruby didn&#39;t approve and told her &#34;not to bother coming back&#34; home. Knowing this, when did Ruby first meet Sophie? Did she ever come to visit Donna on the islandatany point after Sophie was born? How often did Sophie see Ruby growing up? Did Ruby not even show up when Donna died? How long has it been since Sophie last saw Ruby? All of this can and should be addressed in flashbacks to Sophie&#39;s childhood and adolescence and through Sophie and Ruby&#39;s newfound relationship in Mamma Mia 3,so long as Ruby has kept her word.





 4  Where Is Donna Originally From? 
Her hometown is never revealed in the first two Mamma Mia! movies.
        

Donna has an American accent and speaks vaguely of &#34;home&#34; but never indicates where that is. In the first sequel, after Donna graduates from the University of Oxford, she decides to go traveling instead of going &#34;home&#34; to her mother, but the exact location of &#34;home&#34; is never specified. She later tells Sam that she&#39;s been traveling all her life with her mom who&#39;s always on tour, suggesting that she may not have grown up in the same city she was born.
In the present, Sophie says that Ruby has spent the past few decades in Las Vegas, presumably for her job as a performer, but her invitation is addressed to a residence in Beverly Hills. It&#39;s possible Donna was born and/or grew up in either of these places, but it&#39;s more likely that these are just the different cities in which Ruby resides now. Donna&#39;s hometown, as well as more details about her upbringing and life on the road with Ruby growing up, could be revealed in Mamma Mia 3.
            
 
 1 Reddit Theory Will Change The Way You Look At The Mamma Mia! Movies 
The Mamma Mia! movies are very entertaining films with killer soundtracks, but one theory completely recontextualizes the rom-com musicals.








 3  What Is The Story With Fernando? 
Mamma Mia!&#39;s Señor Fernando Cienfuegos is shrouded in mystery.


 







Fernando Cienfuegos is the manager of the Hotel Bella Donna, though Sophie just calls him Señor for most of the first sequel. Not much is known about this handsome, poetic man until Ruby shows up, and it is revealed that they were once lovers a long time ago. Their romance is hinted at by younger Donna when she tells Harry that her mom &#34;had her heart broken into a million little pieces&#34; in Central America years before.
Upon seeing Ruby, Fernando exclaims &#34;Mi Amor! Mexico, 1959!&#34; which is presumably where and when they met. The lyrics of their duet, &#34;Fernando,&#34; tell the story of how they met and make references to a war. Given the couple&#39;s context, this is most likely the conflict between Mexico and Guatemala in 1959.
Ruby and Fernando rekindle their long-lost love, but few concrete details are revealed about their initial love affair, or Fernando himself. What happened all those years ago? Why did they part ways? Did Fernando really break Ruby&#39;s heart, or is that just Ruby&#39;s version of the story? Is Fernando from Mexico? When and why did he come to Greece? If Ruby and Fernando are still together in Mamma Mia 3, they could reveal these details together, but either way, they must be shared.





 2  What Happened To Donna&#39;s Father? 
Donna&#39;s father is hardly ever mentioned in the Mamma Mia! movies.
        

While Ruby is mentioned many times in both movies and makes her grand appearance in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Donna&#39;s father is hardly mentioned at all. When Donna tells Sam about her life growing up, she mentions that her dad was &#34;never in the picture.&#34; Besides this, there is no further mention of him at all.
It&#39;s unlikely that Donna ever found out who her dad was since it probably would&#39;ve come up at some point given Sophie&#39;s whole father situation. In that case, who is he? Is he still alive? Did she ever meet him, or did he leave before she was born? Does she remember him at all? It&#39;s also possible that Fernando is Donna&#39;s absent father, which would be a fun twist for Mamma Mia 3 to introduce.





 1  Who Is Sophie&#39;s Dad? 
The biggest unanswered at the center of the Mamma Mia! movies


 







Of course, the most prevalent unsolved mystery of the Mamma Mia! universe is who Sophie&#39;s biological father is: Sam, Bill, or Harry? Sophie spends the entire first movie trying to figure this out but ultimately decides that it doesn&#39;t matter and that she&#39;s fine with never knowing for sure. Though Sam marries Donna and becomes Sophie&#39;s stepfather, thus developing the closest relationship with her out of the three possible dads, she is happy to have all three of them as her fathers, and they&#39;re all happy to share her as their daughter.
Still, it remains the biggest lingering question in the Mamma Mia! movies. The fact is that no paternity test has ever been done to determine who her biological father is, and there may never be. It&#39;s hard to say whether Mamma Mia 3would reveal who Sophie&#39;s real dad is, but depending on the story, it very well could.
