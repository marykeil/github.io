## Literature Review

Tom Cruise has signed a brand new deal with Warner Bros., and the terms of it can be what Edge of Tomorrow 2 needs to finally happen.




The long-awaited Edge of Tomorrow 2 might now be closer than ever thanks to a new deal between Tom Cruise and Warner Bros. Tom Cruise continues to be one of the most popular and profitable action stars in the film industry, a spot he has maintained since the 1980s, beginning with his role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell in Tony Scott’s Top Gun. Cruise’s popularity continued throughout the 1990s thanks to Mission: Impossible and other projects outside the action genre, as were the comedy-drama Jerry Maguire and the psychological drama Eyes Wide Shut.




The expansion of the Mission: Impossible franchise has kept Cruise active in the action genre throughout the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s, but in 2014, he explored another side of this genre with Edge of Tomorrow. Based on the 2004 novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka and directed by Doug Liman, Edge of Tomorrow takes the audience to a future where most of Europe is taken over by an alien race. When Major William Cage (Cruise) is forced to join a landing operation against them, he finds himself in a time loop. Despite Edge of Tomorrow’s critical and commercial success, a sequel has been lost in limbo for years, but Cruise’s latest studio deal can finally make Edge of Tomorrow 2 happen.

                  Tom Cruise&#39;s Next Long-Delayed Sequel Needs To Be His Priority Over Top Gun 3   While the idea of Top Gun 3 happening is exciting, Tom Cruise should shift his focus to a long-delayed sci-fi sequel that needs him to move forward.   


 Tom Cruise Has History With Warner Bros. (But Not In A Decade) 
          




Warner Bros. has announced a new deal with Tom Cruise through which they will jointly develop and produce “original and franchise theatrical films” starring Cruise, beginning in 2024. This isn’t Tom Cruise’s first time working with Warner Bros., and this deal marks his big return to the studio. Warner Bros. is the studio behind some of Cruise’s biggest movies, such as Risky Business (which is widely considered his breakthrough role), the horror movie Interview with the Vampire (where he played Lestat), Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, and Magnolia, for which Cruise got an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Cruise’s last project with Warner Bros. was Edge of Tomorrow, in 2014, so his return to the studio could be the push that Edge of Tomorrow 2 needs to finally happen. As mentioned above, Cruise’s new deal with Warner is to make movies both franchise and original, and Edge of Tomorrow being the last big success they had together, it’s a good sign for Edge of Tomorrow 2. Since Edge of Tomorrow, Cruise’s career has been mostly focused on expanding other franchises, mostly the Mission: Impossible one, but having him back again with Warner makes the expansion of Edge of Tomorrow a lot more likely.






 Edge Of Tomorrow 2 Has Been Kicked Around For Years 
          

Despite not having an open ending, Edge of Tomorrow left the door open for a sequel as Cage fulfilled his mission and was thrown back to the past, though with a much brighter future. In 2016, Doug Liman signed on to direct the sequel, and that same year, he said Edge of Tomorrow 2 would “revolutionize how people make sequels” as it was “a sequel that’s a prequel” (via Collider). The following year, the title for the sequel, Live Die Repeat and Repeat, was revealed, and Cruise and Blunt were said to be reprising their roles, but the project began to face a couple of obstacles, mostly the schedules of Blunt, Cruise, and Liman.

Tom Cruise’s deal with Warner Bros. can put an end to the scheduling conflicts that have been delaying Edge of Tomorrow 2, and if Blunt and Liman are still up for it, Live Die Repeat and Repeat could finally be on its way to moving past pre-production hell.
