## Literature Review

Director Michael Mann shares an update on Heat 2, not only teasing one big similarity to the book, but revealing when he expects to film the project.




Heat 2 director Michael Mann provides an update on the highly-anticipated sequel, revealing a filming start window. Released in 1995, Mann&#39;s crime thriller starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino has gone down as one of the best heist movies of all time. The Heat 2 novel was released in 2022, continuing the story of Val Kilmer&#39;s Chris Shiherlis while simultaneously serving as a prequel for De Niro&#39;s Neil McCauley and Pacino&#39;s Vincent Hanna.




Now, with no Heat 2 release date yet in sight, Mann reveals on the Variety Awards Circuit podcast that he expects to film the sequel at some point in 2024. The filmmaker also teases that the movie will feature a big similarity to the novel in terms of its unique timeline approach. Check out Mann&#39;s comments (via The Playlist) below:


&#34;Heat 2 is a prequel and a sequel and is driving into the global future of transnational organized crime as it really moves, it’s kind of a giant step in that direction.
“So I’m busy writing the screenplay, so I get very respectful, very pleasant calls from Warner Bros. saying, ‘Is there anything we can do to help?’ which translates into, ‘Where’s the screenplay?&#39; My plan is to absolutely make it [this] year.&#34;


                  Casting Heat 2’s Young Chris Shiherlis To Replace Val Kilmer   Heat 2 is in development with Adam Driver playing a young Neil McCauley, but which actor should play a young version of Val Kilmer&#39;s Chris Shiherlis?   





 Why Ferrari Is Concerning For Heat 2 
          

While Mann seems very confident that Heat 2 will move forward and enter production this year, the director&#39;s latest film, Ferrari, has been a fairly big disappointment at the box office. Budgeted at $95 million, the film, which has been a long-gestating passion project for Mann, got off to a slow start at the box office on Christmas day, and has now earned only $20.4 million worldwide.



Adam Driver, who plays the titular role in Ferrari, was once reported to be playing a young Neil McCauley, but the accuracy of these reports has recently been called into question.




Ferrari&#39;s disappointing box office, on its own, isn&#39;t necessarily cause for concern, but it does continue an unfortunate box office trend for Mann. 2015&#39;s Blackhat was a major disappointment financially, as was 2006&#39;s Miami Vice. 2012&#39;s Public Enemies ended up doing moderately well at $214.1 million and 2004&#39;s Collateral was a hit at $220, but Mann&#39;s previous two movies, 2001&#39;s Ali and 1999&#39;s The Insider also significantly underperformed.




It would certainly be understandable if this track record gave executives pause when it comes to forking over $70 million or more to make a globe-trotting sequel to a 28-year-old movie. That being said, Heat is widely considered one of Mann&#39;s best movies and the film has garnered a particularly strong following in recent years. That&#39;s not to mention the fact that Heat 2 was a bestseller and critically well-received upon its release in 2022. Hopefully, production on Mann&#39;s highly-anticipated sequel remains on the cards for this year.
