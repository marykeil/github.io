# Mortal Kombat 2s Success Depends On One Character (&amp; Its Not Johnny Cage)


## SUMMARY 


 

The 2021 Mortal Kombat movie got many things right, including violence, gore, important characters, and references to the source material, but it still had some areas of failure.
            

Mortal Kombat 2 should fix its poor handling of certain characters to please the fans of the video games.
            

The inclusion of the Netherrealm in Mortal Kombat 2 suggests that one character will be handled properly this time, redeeming their weak portrayal in the first movie.

## Literature Review
The 2021 Mortal Kombat movie did a poor job with its handling of one key character. Hopefully, the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2 can fix this error.
