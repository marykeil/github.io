# Fast &amp; Furious Did A Much Better Cliffhanger Ending Than Fast X 14 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  Fast &amp; Furious 4 had a better cliffhanger ending than Fast X because it wasn&#39;t teased beforehand with a confirmed sequel.   Fast X&#39;s ending feels forced and artificial as a sequel hook, unlike Fast &amp; Furious 4&#39;s natural tease for the next chapter.   The stakes in Fast X&#39;s cliffhanger are low because important characters are unlikely to be killed off, unlike the suspenseful ending of Fast &amp; Furious 4.

## Literature Review
More than a decade before Fast X ended on a cliffhanger ahead of Part 2, the Fast and Furious saga had already done a much better sequel hook.




Fast X was defined by its cliffhanger ending that sets up Fast X, Part 2, but the Fast and Furious franchise once did a much better sequel hook 14 years ago. Similar to franchises like Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and The Avengers&#39; Infinity Saga, the Fast Saga announced that it would end with a two-part film. Fast X’s villain, Dante Reyes, wasn’t defeated, and the upcoming Fast &amp; Furious 11 is expected to begin where Fast X ended.




Almost every Fast and Furious movie since Dom and Brian reunited offered a great opportunity to end the franchise. For example, Fast Five gives everyone a happy ending, while Furious 7 concludes with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker. However, in addition to Fast X, the Fast Saga has seen another film that ended on a cliffhanger teasing the next installment – and not in a post-credits scene like Fast Five or Fast &amp; Furious 6.

              Related   Fast &amp; Furious Complete Timeline (Including Fast X Flashbacks &amp; Retcons)   Here’s a complete breakdown of the Fast &amp; Furious franchise timeline, including new details provided by Fast X’s flashbacks and Tokyo Drift retcons.    


 Fast &amp; Furious 4 Ends On A Cliffhanger 
          

Fast &amp; Furious (2009), or Fast &amp; Furious 4, was not designed to be the first entry in a two-party story like Fast X. Instead, Fast &amp; Furious 4 was meant to reignite the saga by reuniting Paul Walker’s Brian O’Conner and Vin Diesel’s Dominic Toretto for the first time since The Fast and the Furious (2001). While there would not be a “Part 2”, it seemed likely that, if Fast &amp; Furious 4 worked, there would be more than enough room for a direct sequel in the form of Fast &amp; Furious 5. As such, Fast &amp; Furious (2009) ended on what can be considered a cliffhanger.





 

In the closing minutes of Fast &amp; Furious 4, Dominic Toretto is being transported to a penitentiary after being sentenced to 25 years for multiple crimes. At first, it seemed like Toretto going to jail was going to be the end of his story, perhaps serving as the conclusion of the Fast and Furious saga. However, just before the credits roll, Fast &amp; Furious 4 reveals Mia, Brian, and the rest of Toretto’s crew from earlier in the film showing up for a rescue mission. Despite the obvious implication that Toretto’s family was going to get him free, the movie ends without showing whether they succeeded.



 Why Fast &amp; Furious 4’s Cliffhanger Is Better Than Fast X&#39;s Ending 
          




Just the fact that Fast &amp; Furious (2009)’s cliffhanger ending was not teased beforehand with the confirmation of a “Part 2” sequel makes it instantly better than Fast X’s. Not only that, but Fast X’s ending feels like something too artificially designed as a sequel hook rather than a natural tease for the next chapter of the story. Naturally, Fast and Furious’ potential final movie being split into two parts was a huge part of Fast X’s marketing, and the film was supposed to feel like a must-see event that would lead right into another installment. Still, Fast X’s ending does not work.

After Jakob’s Toretto death, Fast X was never going to kill any other important character – even Jakob could still be alive, given how the franchise keeps bringing dead characters back. As such, when Fast X ends with Dante Reyes attacking Toretto and his son, there is no real sense of stakes. It’s safe to say neither Dom nor Little Brian will be killed off in the opening sequence of Fast X, Part 2, meaning that the cliffhanger is bound to have a predictable resolution. Fast &amp; Furious 4’s ending, however, perfectly set up how Dom would be on the run in Fast Five.
