# This Ultimate Star Wars Snowman Rules With Fear (Not Respect)


## SUMMARY 



  This snowman based on Jabba the Hutt is eerily accurate and captures the creepy details of the Star Wars villain.   Jabba would be proud of the snowman tribute, as he enjoys attention and views it as a sign of respect.   The snowman&#39;s depiction of Jabba is a playful homage, but thankfully, it&#39;s made of snow and not the real, dangerous Hutt.

## Literature Review

This image shows a Jabba the Hutt snowman that perfectly represents the infamous Star Wars villain who ruled with fear rather than respect.




One creative household has built an incredibly lifelike snowman based on the Star Wars villain Jabba the Hutt. Quite a legacy has started to build around Jabba following his debut in Return of the Jedi, with many Star Wars stories confirming his crime syndicate as one of the galaxy&#39;s most dangerous. Despite Jabba&#39;s fate at the hands of Princess Leia Organa, earning her the nickname of &#34;Huttslayer,&#34; he continues to impact Star Wars and the avid viewers of the franchise - even in a galaxy far, far away from his own.




                  Star Wars Original Trilogy Cast &amp; Character Guide   From Mark Hamill to Carrie Fisher to Harrison Ford, the original Star Wars trilogy launched its cast members to stardom with iconic characters.   

Shared by Star Wars Culture, this snowman made in Jabba&#39;s image is uncanny. Complete with Jabba&#39;s facial features, long tail, and domineering presence, the snowman towers over even the surrounding cars, suggesting this snow Jabba might even be to scale. The similarities depart from there; it would be a shock to find Jabba the Hutt out in the snow, given that he resides on Tatooine and doesn&#39;t seem to travel. Snowman Jabba is also notably (thankfully) missing a slave trapped by his side, making this depiction a lot less intimidating and even a bit fun, or as close to fun as Jabba can get


 




Despite the playfulness of the image, the build is eerily accurate, immediately bringing to mind that deep sadistic laugh. The photo captures the little details added by the creators, including colorful snow and the Hutt&#39;s creepy, penetrating stare. The caption adds even more character to the creation, with a (very on-brand for Jabba) taunt comparing this Hutt snowman to other lesser builds.


 Even Jabba The Hutt Would Be Proud Of This 
Jabba Is The Hero In His Own Story
          

Jabba is perhaps the single nastiest Star Wars villain of them all, but it&#39;s clear he thinks highly of himself. The Hutt, who has ruled since the prequel Star Wars trilogy era, surrounds himself with footmen and slaves catering to his whims, and he clearly enjoys the theatrics, with his cruel requirements that slaves dance for him and his contemporaries, literally putting them to death if they resist. It&#39;s easy to imagine Jabba being delighted by this homage to him; he doesn&#39;t seem like one to shy away from additional attention, and he would surely view this as a sign of respect and appreciation.




In fairness to Jabba, to the extent that he deserves fairness, his is a reputation that really does deserve additional notoriety in the galaxy and the franchise. When he appears in Return of the Jedi, he comes across as a lecherous crime lord, but his screen time is relatively limited. He is quickly beaten by the heroes of the original trilogy, with Leia getting justice for her subjugation by strangling the Hutt to death with her chains. In the prequel era, Jabba returns, and it becomes clear that he has a much more significant history than was depicted in the final movie of the original trilogy.

One of the oddest points of connection takes place in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars movie, which reveals that not only did Jabba know Anakin Skywalker, but also that Anakin and Ahsoka worked together to save and return Jabba&#39;s son. This connection offers a fascinating train of thought: Anakin saved Jabba&#39;s son only for Jabba to (unknowingly, certainly) go on to attempt to kill Anakin&#39;s son and enslave Anakin&#39;s daughterâ€”subjecting her, briefly, to a life similar to Anakin&#39;s as a slave. While interesting in thought, it&#39;s a relief that the Jabba in the image is made of snow; the Star Wars galaxy is better off without the real deal.
