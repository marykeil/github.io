# Original Spider-Man Trilogy &amp; Amazing Spider-Man Gwen Stacy Made Into Spider-Verse Heroes Via Marvel Multiverse Art


## SUMMARY 



Every live-action version of Gwen Stacy suits up as Spider-Verse superheroes in new fan art, uniting the cinematic variants.

Gwen&#39;s Spider-Woman version is returning for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, bringing together the actresses who played Gwen in previous franchises.

There is potential for Emma Stone to play Gwen Stacy again, either in a limited-event live-action series or through the power of the multiverse in future Spider-Verse stories.
