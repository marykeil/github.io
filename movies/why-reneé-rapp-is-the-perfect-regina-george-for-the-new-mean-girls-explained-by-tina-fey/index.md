Summary

  Tina Fey praises Reneé Rapp&#39;s ability to own a close-up and be intimidating, making her perfect for the screen.   Rapp brings subtle and funny acting choices to the role of Regina, adding depth to her performance.   Rapp successfully combines the best parts of the original Mean Girls and the Broadway musical, capturing the humor and essence of the character.  





Tina Fey discusses why Reneé Rapp is the perfect Regina George in the new Mean Girls musical movie. Rapp played Regina in the Broadway musical and reprises the role on the big screen. Rapp has risen to prominence from her role in The Sex Live of College Girls and her music career.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Mean Girls, Fey praised Rapp. She broke down how Rapp takes elements from the Broadway musical while brilliantly acting for the camera with thoughtful nuances. Fey also explained how Rapp can key into a core element of Regina, her ability to intimidate, while also making people desperate to win her approval. Check out Fey&#39;s full quote below:


Tina Fey: Reneé can really own a close-up. Her face is so stunning, and also she&#39;s so intimidating when she needs to be. I think she&#39;s built for the screen. She just is so powerful. At the same time, she has the legit vocal and movement skills of a Broadway star. So you&#39;re really just getting the best of everything.
But there&#39;s some really funny things that she does in the movie that are very subtle and definitely camera style acting like in the gym when Ms. Norbury almost sings. Please, if you see the movie again, please just watch Renee&#39;s eyes. She&#39;s so funny. She just does this really funny take with her eyes.
As Regina, Renee has this quality that Regina has to have, which is you&#39;re scared of her, but you also really want her to like you. You want her to notice you. You want her to approve of you. You want her to shine her light on you.






 Reneé Rapp&#39;s Regina George Combines The Best Parts Of The Original Mean Girls &amp; The Musical 
         

Rapp is able to capture the feeling of Regina George embodying her stranglehold over the school and plastics, with people gravitating towards her while still fearing her wrath. Rapp also brings the nuanced comedic timing that is necessary for this role. Fey notes how Rapp brings subtle acting choices to the role that make all the difference. These decisions likely add an unexpected depth to her performance as well.

                  Mean Girls 2024 - Release Date, Cast, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Tina Fey is bringing Broadway to the big screen in the Mean Girls (2024), and there&#39;s already much to discuss before the movie releases.   

Perhaps most impressive is Rapp&#39;s ability to meld the elements of the Mean Girls Broadway show with her ability to act for the camera. Acting on stage versus on screen are very different skill sets. When performing on Broadway, the cast needs to bring a larger-than-life element to the performance in order for the entire theater to have the same experience.






However, the stage style doesn&#39;t quite translate on camera, with close-ups and smaller, more intimate moments being key to a great movie.




Rapp&#39;s prowess as a singer elevates the role, as does her understanding and execution of performance for the medium of film. Rapp fully brings together every aspect of what makes Regina George such a horrible and compelling character in every incarnation. Mean Girls is able to bring together what works so well from the original movie and the Broadway musical while capturing the feel and humor of today, and Rapp perfectly embodies that balance.
