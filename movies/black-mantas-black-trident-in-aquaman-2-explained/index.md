## Literature Review

Black Manta wields the Black Trident in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which is shown to be one of the most powerful DCEU weapons.





Black Manta will carry a black trident in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and there are numerous possible origins for the new DCEU weapon. Black Manta is well-known as one of Aquaman&#39;s arch-enemies in the comics, a sea-faring mercenary who dons a high-tech, Manta-like suit to battle the King of Atlantis in the depths of the ocean. 2018&#39;s DCEU movie Aquaman saw David Kane, a.k.a. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), make his cinematic debut, with David holding Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) responsible for his father&#39;s death and seeking revenge upon him - a premise that is revealed to also make him the main villain of the final movie in the DCEU timeline.




In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s story, Black Manta returns to fulfill his vendetta once more, and poses such a threat that Aquaman has to team up with Orm, a.k.a. Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson), to defeat their common enemy. Black Manta also carries some new tools for battle in the sequel, with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom showing him wielding a black trident against Aquaman that has some major significance for the movie&#39;s plot, and plays a considerable role in the Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom ending.

 The Black Trident&#39;s Aquaman And The Last Kingdom History Explained 
         

 Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom reveals that the Black Trident is crucial to the plot both because it is a weapon able to use dark magic, and because it contains the soul of King Kordan. Kordan was trapped in the weapon after he lost a battle against his brother, King Atlan, which also saw Atlan place a curse upon Kordan&#39;s empire, resulting in Necrus becoming eternally frozen. As a result, the Black Trident is immensely powerful, able to inflict catastrophic physical damage on those it&#39;s used against. However, the corrupting nature of the magic within the weapon - and the unhinged spirit who possesses it - mean the wielder is at great personal risk when trying to use the Black Trident for any amount of it.






 The Black Trident&#39;s Possible DC Comics History Explained 
          

The discussion of the Black Trident using dark magic and threatening a global meltdown led to much speculation as to where the weapon was drawing from when it comes to the comics - with popular bets being between the Dead King&#39;s Scepter, which is also stolen by Black Manta in the comics, and has its own colossal powers, as well as Triton&#39;s trident. Ultimately, though, the reveal that the Black Trident is comprised of Orichalcum instead appears to suggest it&#39;s a version of the trident that Black Manta makes in the comics, which is also comprised of the material - though in Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom, David Kane instead repairs the centuries-broken weapon, instead of crafting it himself.



Orichalcum is one of the strongest materials on Earth and outside of it in DC Comics, and this is suggested to also hold true for the DCEU.









 Is The Black Trident More Powerful Than Aquaman&#39;s Trident? 
          

It is hard to say exactly how powerful Black Manta&#39;s trident is compared to Aquaman&#39;s, especially given that the final fight of the film concludes with Arthur throwing both at King Kordax to save the day - which implies they&#39;re balanced power-wise, but doesn&#39;t conclusively say so. Arthur wields the Trident of Atlan, which gives Arthur his claim to the Atlantean throne and which clearly has strong abilities in combat. With Arthur shattering the trident carried by Orm in Aquaman&#39;s final fight, the Trident of Atlan is an undeniably powerful weapon in the hands of a skilled Atlantean warrior.

At the same time, Black Manta is also quite adept in bladed combat, and it&#39;s clear the Black Trident has posed a real threat to Atlantis before. It also possesses far more flashy powers, but given they&#39;re not enough to beat Aquaman in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - and the Trident of Atlan is shown twice shattering it - it appears the DCEU hero&#39;s weapon is certainly the sturdier choice, even if it perhaps isn&#39;t as magically gifted.
