## Literature Review

Role Play, Kaley Cuoco&#39;s new action comedy from Prime Video, just cannot break her surprising and extremely unfortunate Rotten Tomatoes movie record.




Prime Video&#39;s Role Play hasn&#39;t saved Kaley Cuoco from her painful Rotten Tomatoes record. In the movie, Cuoco plays an international assassin, who is desperately trying to both survive and save her family as other hired killers hunt them down. The action comedy was released on January 12 and stars Cuoco as its lead actor, alongside David Oyelowo, Bill Nighy and Connie Nielsen.




With the movie now on Prime Video, Role Play has found itself struggling with critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the action comedy has earned a paltry 17% Tomatometer score, while audiences offered a somewhat improved 51% score at the time of writing. It is yet another disappointment for Cuoco, who has never been in a single critically renowned movie. While she has starred in successful shows, every one of Cuoco&#39;s movies has scored Rotten on the Tomatometer.


 Kaley Cuoco&#39;s History Of Disappointing Tomatometer Scores 
          

Cuoco&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes page features a bizarre streak of green splatters for every movie that has been reviewed by critics. Many of her movies have not been reviewed at all. Besides Role Play, The Man from Toronto earned a 23%, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip received a 15%, The Wedding Ringer has a 29% score, Hope ended with a 24% and Authors Anonymous earned an abysmal 8%. On the more mixed side of things, 2022&#39;s Meet Cute ended with a 59% rating from critics, while The Last Ride scored a 47% score.

Some of her movies were respected by audiences, at least. Audiences gave Meet Cute a 61% score, and The Wedding Ringer earned a 63%, and Cuoco&#39;s Bratz movies both earned above 70%. Cuoco&#39;s TV record, on the other hand, has been far more successful. Harley Quinn has an impressive Tomatometer score of 97%, while the recently released Based on a True Story has a 76%. The Big Bang Theory, which made Cuoco famous, even has an overall average of 81%.

Unfortunately, Cuoco&#39;s many theatrical projects have simply been disappointing to critics. While it would be reasonable to point to Cuoco as the common element in the failure to earn acclaim, she has some well-respected performances on TV, which indicates that she is not quite the back-breaking common denominator that she appears to be. Whatever the reason behind her disappointing movies, Kaley Cuoco&#39;s Role Play has not saved her Tomatometer record.
