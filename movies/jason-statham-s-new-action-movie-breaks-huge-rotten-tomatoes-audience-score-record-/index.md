The Beekeeper RT Audience Score Climbs To 94%


As more reviews have come in, The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score has only improved, climbing to 94%. This makes the movie Statham&#39;s career-high, topping his early collaborations with director Guy Ritchie.





 The Beekeeper Is A Huge Change For Statham 
          




The Beekeeper is breaking a Rotten Tomatoes trend for Statham. Although the movie holds a critical score of 67%, it still performs better than many of his previous projects, especially in comparison to his 2023 releases. Expend4bles and Meg 2: The Trench disappointed critics, earning a mere 14% and 27%, respectively. Statham&#39;s other 2023 releases, Fast X and Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, fared better with critics with 56% and 51%, respectively, but it otherwise shows a poor trend for the actor in 2023.

In addition to the critical and audience reception, the new action movie is doing relatively well at the box office. The Beekeeper is projected to earn $16.8 million at the domestic box office. This is way above the early estimates of $8 million to $13 million, showing that the movie is performing better than expected. In addition, the action movie is already doing better than Expend4bles, as the 2023 film domestically made $16 million during its total box office run.

                  Are The Beekeepers Real? Jason Statham&#39;s Action Movie Inspiration Explained   Jason Statham&#39;s latest action movie has viewers wondering if The Beekeepers are a real organization. Here&#39;s what to know about the film&#39;s inspiration.   




With The Beekeeper on track to become a success, this has opened the potential for sequels and a rising franchise. Both Statham and director David Ayer have expressed their interest in making more movies to explore the origins of the titular organization and the protagonist, Adam. The Beekeeper ending also opens up those possibilities as Statham&#39;s character survives the movie&#39;s events. With the audience clearly loving the actor&#39;s new action flick, those chances are looking very good.
