## Literature Review

Some of Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League 2 plans have already been revealed, and the director&#39;s lost movie comes to life in an epic new DC fan trailer.




A gritty Justice League 2 fan trailer brings Zack Snyder&#39;s canceled DC movie to life. After Snyder got replaced by Joss Whedon on 2017&#39;s Justice League, the director would get to share his original vision with fans of his Snyderverse in 2021&#39;s Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League. With the conclusion of Snyder&#39;s DC movies, the director&#39;s plans for two Justice League sequels were left in the past.




Screen Culture has revived some of Snyder&#39;s original ideas with a dark Justice League 2 fan trailer.


 

The Justice League 2 fan trailer envisions Snyder&#39;s lost film as one of DC&#39;s upcoming movies. Darkseid is the central antagonist of the film, with a twisted Superman also contributing to the trailer&#39;s chilling tone. While the Justice League 2 fan trailer is exciting, and Snyderverse fans hold out hope for Snyder to come back for a new DC Elseworlds film, the chance of that happening is slim.

                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.   


 What We Know About Zack Snyder&#39;s Canceled Justice League 2 and DCEU Plans 
Many Details Of Snyder&#39;s Plans Have Been Revealed
          




While the DCEU would grow to be a confusing cinematic universe, with important characters missing for years or never debuting and many behind-the-scenes issues, Snyder had a clear plan in mind. The director was looking to develop a Justice League trilogy. In 2023, it was revealed that Ezra Miller&#39;s version of The Flash would have played a major role in Snyder&#39;s DCEU plans.

According to DCEU storyboard artist Jay Oliva, an early version of The Flash was supposed to lay &#34;the groundwork for Zoom as the big baddy of the DC Universe.&#34; Miller was at one point planned to star in a trilogy of Flash movies, which would have ended with Flashpoint. Snyder wanted to use the major comic book event to end and reboot the DCEU, allowing new actors to come in as the most famous DC characters after ten years.

Snyder&#39;s planned Justice League 2 and Justice League 3 would have led to Flashpoint. The director planned to conclude his major Darkseid epic with the universe getting to have several heroes as part of the Justice League, like in the animated Justice League Unlimited. Justice League 2 and the other Snyderverse movies would also be affected by Zoom behind the scenes, leading to the character being revealed as the Snyderverse&#39;s ultimate villain. With a fan campaign for Snyder&#39;s Justice League 2 to be made, perhaps Snyder&#39;s DC plans can be realized some day, even if in another medium.
