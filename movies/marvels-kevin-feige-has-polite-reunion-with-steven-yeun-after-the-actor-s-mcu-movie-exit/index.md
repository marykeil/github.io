## Literature Review

Steven Yeun dropped out of Thunderbolts recently, and the actor has reunited with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige in an interesting photo.




Steven Yeun has reunited with Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige after dropping out of Thunderbolts. The actor was going to play Marvel Comics&#39; Sentry in the movie. While Marvel never officially announced Yeun as part of Thunderbolts&#39; expansive cast or that he was playing Sentry, Yeun&#39;s long-time collaborator Robert Kirkman revealed that he had a costume fitting to play Sentry in Thunderbolts. Later, Yeun confirmed he dropped out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Thunderbolts due to scheduling conflicts.




On Twitter, @marcus_jones shared a photo of Yeun and Feige&#39;s reunion at the Critics&#39; Choice Awards.


 

Feige did have a stern look in the photo, though that could mean anything. When announcing that he had left Marvel&#39;s Thunderbolts movie, Yeun recognized that he &#34;probably pissed off too many people leaving.&#34; However, that might not be the end of the road for the actor with Marvel.

While Yeun will no longer play Sentry in Thunderbolts, with rumors already circulating about who Marvel has chosen as his replacement, that does not mean that the actor has no future at Marvel. When revealing that he had to back down from the MCU film due to scheduling conflicts, Yeun said that he still wants to &#34;do a Marvel movie.&#34; There are a few roles that the actor could play.

Yeun even commented on the possibilities, though he did not want to get specific due to how his abrupt departure from Thunderbolts might have ruffled some feathers at Marvel. According to the actor, he has &#34;some ideas,&#34; but he &#34;heard if you put it out there, you’ll never get it, so I’ll keep it close to my chest.&#34; With the MCU soon introducing the Fantastic Four and the X-Men on the way at a later date, there are plenty of options for Yeun to finally play a Marvel character.

                  10 Marvel Characters Steven Yeun Can Play In The MCU After Exiting Thunderbolts   Following Steven Yeun&#39;s exit from Thunderbolts, the actor wants to play another Marvel character, and the Sentry was not the only good one for him.   




Yeun has the acting range to play important Marvel heroes and villains. Doctor Doom has been brought up as a possible replacement for Jonathan Majors&#39; Kang the Conqueror now that the actor has been fired, and Yeun would bring the gravitas that the role needs. The actor would also perfectly fit Amadeus Cho, the new Hulk, in the rumored World War Hulk movie if that pans out — and if Marvel Studios opts to go older with the character. Other options include Nova, Norman Osborn, Cyclops, and many more. It remains to be seen if Steven Yeun and Kevin Feige&#39;s meeting will lead to another MCU role down the road.





Thunderbolts releases on July 25, 2025.
