# Furiosa Can Improve Upon Mad Max Fury Road s Most Important Theme


## SUMMARY 



Furiosa&#39;s trailer hints at a continuation of the feminist themes seen in Mad Max: Fury Road, showcasing female soldiers leading the charge and fighting against oppressive forces.

Furiosa has the opportunity to improve upon Mad Max: Fury Road&#39;s biggest theme of female liberation, allowing her to shine as the new lead and reinforce her agency as the film&#39;s hero.

Expanding on themes of female empowerment in Furiosa can keep the Mad Max franchise feeling fresh, distinguish it from its predecessors, and introduce other poignant topics in future projects.
