## Literature Review

Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey was a shock success, leading to a sequel getting fast-tracked, and here&#39;s everything we know about Blood and Honey 2.




Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey was a shock success, so it&#39;s no surprise that the slasher movie is getting a sequel, and all the Blood and Honey 2 news indicates the follow-up with be just as gory and bombastic as its predecessor. The 2023 movie came to fruition after the iconic children&#39;s character entered the public domain, meaning that anybody outside of Disney can make any Winnie the Pooh movie they want, even if it&#39;s a grotesque and schlocky horror movie. Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey follows Pooh and Piglet as they massacre anyone who crosses their path during their hunt for Christopher Robin.




Given the novelty of a hard R horror movie featuring the beloved Disney characters, Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey astonishingly became a huge hit relative to its budget. The film had a micro-budget of less than $100,000 and made an impressive $4.9 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo) despite Blood and Honey having 3% on Rotten Tomatoes. Following the movie&#39;s success, a sequel has unsurprisingly been fast-tracked, undoubtedly on a much bigger scale, and there&#39;s already so much exciting Blood and Honey 2 news.


 Most Recent Blood And Honey 2 News 
         

The latest news for the upcoming horror schlock-fest offers the first glimpses at the newly re-designed Pooh in Blood and Honey 2. Due to the sequel&#39;s increased budget, filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield has been able to up the ante and make the blood-thirsty ursine even more creepy with a new look. Though the sneak peek is revealing, fans likely won&#39;t get a fully clear picture until the film&#39;s trailer is released in the future. 






 Blood And Honey 2 Is Confirmed 
          

Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 is confirmed, and even though the first movie is still relatively new, the sequel began filming in Fall 2023 (via Collider). Other slasher movies of beloved children&#39;s characters in the public domain have been discussed too, all of which are in the same cinematic universe as Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey. Bambi: The Reckoning and Peter Pan&#39;s Neverland Nightmare were confirmed following the success of Blood and Honey, and there could be more on the way.



 Blood And Honey 2 Production Status 
          

Even with an increased budget, the release date for Blood and Honey 2 is still coming at a break-neck speed, and the public domain slasher is expected to be released in February 2024 (The Hollywood Reporter). The month is not an accident, and filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield hopes to offer the cheesy horror movie as counterprogramming for Valentine&#39;s Day. A firmer release date is expected soon. 






 Blood And Honey 2 Cast 
          

Not many of the first movie&#39;s actors will return for the Blood and Honey 2 cast, as the Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey kill count was quite high. As such, a host of new names have been announced for the sequel with stunt actor Ryan Oliva taking over the role of the villainous Pooh Bear. Another interesting name joining the cast is BAFTA winner Simon Callow (A Room with a View) who will play Cavendish. Scott Chambers assumes the role of Christopher Robin, with the part originally played by Nikolai Leon. 

The rest of the announced cast includes: 

 Actor  Blood And Honey 2 Role   Tallulah Evans  Lexy   Eddy MacKenzie  Piglet   Lewis Santer  Tigger   Alec Newman  Alan Robin   Peter DeSouza-Feighoney  Young Winnie-The-Pooh   Marcus Massey  Owl   








 Blood And Honey 2 Story 
          

The Blood and Honey 2 story will likely see Pooh Bear hunting Christopher Robin once again. The titular character is still out for revenge after the boy abandoned the animals when he was young. Their abandonment led the animals to eat Eeyore, which effectively turned them into the savages they are today. Given that Winnie the Pooh will have a chainsaw in the sequel, the Blood and Honey 2 story will likely see Pooh Bear using the weapon on most of its victims too. 

With characters like Owl and Tigger joining the mayhem, it&#39;s certain to make Blood and Honey 2 an even more violent spectacle. While the specifics of the story are still being kept under wraps, the sequel isn&#39;t likely to reinvent the wheel when it comes to slasher continuations. Blood and Honey 2 already promises to be a blood-soaked follow-up, regardless of what happens in the story.
