# Where Rogue One s Other Major Characters Are During Andor Season 1


## SUMMARY 


 Andor season 1 takes place five years before the Battle of Yavin, featuring familiar characters from Rogue One like Cassian Andor. 
 Characters like Galen Erso, Bail Organa, and Darth Vader were active during this time, playing crucial roles in the Rebellion against the Empire. 
 However, characters like Leia Organa, Baze Malbus, and Jyn Erso were either too young or had not yet joined the Rebellion during this period.

## Literature Review

Despite the fact Andor follows one of the protagonists of Rogue One, many characters did not make an appearance as they were busy elsewhere.




Andor is something of a prequel to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - but it hasn&#39;t shown where every character is at this point in the Star Wars timeline. Andor season 1 takes place five years before the Battle of Yavin (5 BBY), telling the story of Diego Luna&#39;s Cassian Andor. This naturally means it features several other characters from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, given Cassian&#39;s links to the Rebel Alliance.
The cast of Andor include some familiar faces, such as Genevieve O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Mon Mothma and Forest Whitaker&#39;s Saw Gerrera. Others are absent - either logically so, because they don&#39;t encounter Cassian until the movie, or simply because they haven&#39;t made their Disney&#43; debut yet. Here are where all the various Rogue One characters are at this point in the Star Wars timeline.

 10  The Empire&#39;s Architect, Creator Of The Death Star 
Galen Erso


 







  Played By   Mads Mikkelsen    
Despite the fact that Galen Erso is a member of the Empire, it was made clear over the course of Rogue One that he had been working to sabotage the Empire for many years. Ever since he discovered that Orson Krennic planned to use his research into energy and kyber crystals to build the Death Star, he had been planting the seeds to the Empire&#39;s demise in ways such as including such a glaring weakness in the Death Star&#39;s plans. It is more than likely he was continuing to operate in such a manner while Andor took place, as Orson had already killed Galen&#39;s wife Lyra by this point.
            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.








 9  Senator Of Alderaan And Ally To The Rebellion 
Bail Organa
        

  Played By   Jimmy Smiits    
Working alongside Mon Mothma and the rest of High Command during Rogue One, Bail Organa has been a major player in galactic politics since the time before the Clone Wars. Bail helped to develop the Rebellion when it was still in its infancy and continued to serve as a senator after the Empire took over. 5 BBY was the year that he, along with Mon Mothma and Saw Gerrera, began to rally the rebel factions across the galaxy under one banner. It will be interesting to see whether Bail returns in Andor season 2.





 8  The Princess Who Would Bring Down The Empire 
Leia Organa
        

  Played By   Carrie Fisher / Ingvild Deila    
Although she did not appear for much of the movie, Leia Organa did make a very important appearance at the end of the film when she receives the Death Star plans for the Rebellion, leading directly into the events of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. It may be difficult to believe, but during the events of the first season of Andor, Princess Leia would only be 14 years old. She would not become involved in the Rebellion until two years later, a tale told in Claudia Gray&#39;s Leia: Princess of Alderaan.





 7  Star Wars&#39; Ultimate Villain, The Emperor&#39;s Sith Apprentice 
Darth Vader
        

  Played By   Hayden Christensen / Spencer Wilding / Daniel Naprous / James Earl Jones    
Darth Vader makes a brief, but haunting appearance in Rogue One, at first meeting with Orson Krennic and later appearing in a recreation of his introduction in the first Star Wars movie. During the time Andor takes place, Darth Vader was assisting the Grand Inquisitor with his hunt for Ezra Bridger and the crew of the Ghost. This took place during the television special Star Wars Rebels: Spark of Rebellion, which is set during the same year.





 6  The Imperial Officer Responsible For The Creation Of The Death Star 
Orson Krennic


 







  Played By   Ben Mendelsohn    
Acting as the direct opposite of Galen Erso, Director Orson Krennic was the one responsible for the creation of the Death Star, manipulating Galen and repurposing his work for the superweapon. In 13 BBY before the events of Rogue One in 1 BBY, he tracked down Galen and his family and killed his wife Lyra. Between these two points in time, it is more than likely that he continued to work on and spearhead the Death Star project.





 5  The Guardian Of The Whills Who Became An Assassin 
Baze Malbus
        

  Played By   Wen Jiang    
Not much is known about the past of Baze Malbus before the events of Rogue One. What is known is that at one point he was a Guardian of the Whills that helped to guard The Temple of the Kyber in Jedha City, and at some point he lost faith in the Force and left this life to become an assassin. It is very possible that during the events of Andor, Baze Malbus is still working as an assassin.





 4  Devoted Guardian Of The Whills 
Chirrut Îmwe
        

  Played By   Donnie Yen    
Originally working as a Guardian of the Whills alongside his friend Baze Malbus, unlike his friend Chirrut Îmwe never lost faith. Because of this, he remained as a guardian at The Temple of the Kyber on Jedha until he met Saw Gerrera and later Jyn Erso. It is more than likely that this is where he is during Andor as well.





 3  An Empire Cargo Pilot Turned Rogue 
Bodhi Rook
        

  Played By   Riz Ahmed    
Before he joined the Rebel Alliance and signed on for the Rogue One mission, Bodhi Rook worked as a pilot for the Empire. He worked as a cargo pilot as opposed to becoming an Imperial starfighter pilot, simply because Bodhi could not pass the required exams. It was in the year 5 BBY that he failed these tests after two years of studying, meaning that he would still be piloting cargo ships for the Empire when Andor begins.





 2  The Droid That Broke Away From The Empire 
K-2SO
        

  Played by   Alan Tudyk    
Though many familiar-looking droids have made an appearance in Andor, the repurposed droid seen as Cassian&#39;s sidekick in Rogue One is nowhere to be found in the television series. He may be serving in the Empire, or he might not have even been built yet. Though it is likely K-2SO will return in Andor season 2, his past with the Empire is something that will have to be explored in later content.





 1  Rogue One&#39;s Main Character Still Has Not Made It To Andor 
Jyn Erso


 







  Played By   Felicity Jones    
It may be surprising to some viewers that Jyn Erso, the main character of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, has not made an appearance in what could be considered the Rogue One spin-off series. However, in the year 5 BBY, Jyn Erso was 16 years old; as she was 21 at the time of her death, living with Saw Gerrera after the death of her mother. It was during this year that she went on a mission with Saw, one in which she was abandoned by him and forced to flee the Empire on her own. This would be an incredibly interesting story for Star Wars to bring to screen in Andor season 2.
