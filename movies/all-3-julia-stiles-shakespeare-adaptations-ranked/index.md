## Literature Review

For three years in a row, actress Julia Stiles played roles in three separate Shakespeare adaptations, but which movie was actually the best?




From 1999 to 2001, Julia Stiles appeared in three movies, all of which were modern Shakespeare retellings, so of course, it is only natural to rank these films from worst to best. Julia Stiles is an actress whose career began in 1996 when she played a small role in the film I Love You, I Love You Not. Stiles&#39; first leading role came in 1998 with the thriller, Wicked. However, it was Stiles&#39; prominence in teen romance and comedy movies that boosted her to fame, including Down To You and Save the Last Dance. Since then, Julia Stiles&#39; movies have continued to make their mark.
Julia Stiles&#39; Shakespeare movie adaptation trend happened at a particular high in her career. Just a year after receiving her first starring role, in 1999, Stiles earned the role of Kat Stratford in 10 Things I Hate About You, an adaptation of Shakespeare&#39;s &#34;The Taming of the Shrew.&#34; The following year, in 2000, Stiles played Ophelia in an art house version of Hamlet. And finally, in 2001, Stiles followed up her Shakespeare trend by portraying Desi Brable in an &#34;Othello&#34; retelling entitled, O. Ultimately, these three movies make up Julia Stiles&#39; eccentric run of Shakespeare films, and one in particular, really helped increase her fame.









 








 3  Hamlet 
2000
        

Of Julia Stiles&#39; three modern Shakespeare adaptations, 2000&#39;s Hamlet is likely the worst. Compared to the other two, it certainly has the worst Rotten Tomatoes score, coming in at 58%. Hamlet is a thriller and romance movie that follows the events of Shakespeare&#39;s tragedy, &#34;Hamlet.&#34; In it, Ethan Hawke plays Hamlet, a film student who inherits his father&#39;s production company after his death, but must fight off those who wish to take his power. The film is set in modern-day New York City, and though it maintains Shakespeare&#39;s original dialogue, there is the inclusion of modern technology.
In the end, Hamlet is the worst of Julia Stiles&#39; Shakespeare movies because it is a rather middle-of-the-road film. While others saw Hamlet as being darkly sharp, others felt it to be too stiff. Despite having a modern new setting, the film ultimately didn&#39;t do anything new with the classic story. Ethan Hawke&#39;s performance was also up in the air with critics. So, although Hamlet offered a star-studded cast of Ethan Hawke, Kyle MacLachlan, Bill Murray, and Liev Schrieber, it was not especially impressive, nor did it stand out among other, better modern Shakespeare adaptations.





 2  O 
2001
        

The next best Julia Stiles Shakespeare adaptation is 2001&#39;s O. The film is a modern retelling of Shakespeare&#39;s &#34;Othello.&#34; O is a romantic thriller which tells the story of Odin James, a star basketball player who has everything going for him until his teammate lies and reveals that Odin&#39;s girlfriend is cheating on him, leading to increasingly dramatic and terrible events. Like Hamlet, O takes place in the modern day, and in particular, on the courts of a high school basketball team. It does not use Shakespeare&#39;s original language, and notably, uses a wide variety of music, from rap to opera.
O is a better film than Julia Stiles&#39; Hamlet because it has themes that extend beyond what Shakespeare intended. Aside from portraying the story Shakespeare wrote, O delves into problems of teen violence, which at that time, were quite prevalent. Furthermore, O&#39;s adaptation of Shakespeare&#39;s language was a success for critics. On the other hand, O is not Julia Stiles&#39; best Shakespeare adaptation. O&#39;s high school setting often feels wrong for the greater story at hand, which makes the film feel unsteady and unbelievable at times. O also suffered from a delayed release due to the 1999 Columbine High School shooting.
O included Josh Hartnett who, the following year, had a notable role in the war film, Pearl Harbor.  






 1  10 Things I Hate About You 
1999


 







Without a doubt, Julia Stiles&#39; best Shakespeare adaptation is 1999&#39;s 10 Things I Hate About You. The romantic comedy tells a modern-day version of &#34;The Taming of the Shrew,&#34; in which rebellious and outspoken Kat Stratford is romanced by bad boy Patrick Verona, not knowing that his interest comes out of a bet rather than genuine desire, at least at first. 10 Things I Hate About You has a classic 90s high school setting and a strong cast, including Heath Ledger, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Allison Janney, and Larisa Oleynik. In this case, Shakespeare&#39;s original language is replaced with fun and easy to understand modern-day language.
It is no surprise that 10 Things I Hate About You has the highest Rotten Tomatoes score of the three movies with a 71%. This film is a 90&#39;s rom-com as beloved as Clueless or She&#39;s All That. Not only is Julia Stiles&#39; performance full of energy and spunk, but the movie itself succeeds at being both sweetly romantic and amazingly funny. One big reason why 10 Things I Hate About You was better received than her previous films is likely that it lacks the heaviness of Shakespeare&#39;s tragedies, and instead, is just pure fun with a talented cast. In this way, it is no doubt the best.
