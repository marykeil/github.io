## Literature Review

The Star Wars Legends continuity&#39;s A New Hope radio drama introduced a nemesis for Princess Leia who has a counterpart in the current canon.




The Star Wars Legends continuity gave Princess Leia a prominent enemy before the events of A New Hope, and this villain exists in the current canon as well. Leia’s rival, the sinister Lord Tion, was introduced in the 1981 Star Wars radio drama, which is now a part of Legends. As with many characters, locations, and concepts from Legends, Lord Tion gained a counterpart in the current continuity, though he likely lacks the same background and fate as his original incarnation. In his brief appearances in the Legends timeline, Tion has a significant impact on the narrative of A New Hope.




The original Star Wars trilogy movies each received radio adaptations in 1981, 1983, and 1996, respectively. While largely faithful to the movies, each radio drama also added additional dialogue and entire narrative sequences to expand the movies, which are now canonically part of the Star Wars Legends timeline. The Return of the Jedi changes mention the events of the Shadows of the Empire multimedia project and Mara Jade herself makes a brief appearance. A New Hope has the highest quantity of changes, featuring a vastly expanded opening that follows Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia, providing the latter with a new enemy.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Lord Tion Is A New Hope’s Hidden Third Villain 
Star Wars Radio Drama
         




Lord Tion is introduced early on in the 1981 Star Wars radio drama. As his name implies, Tion is a nobleman born into the House of Tion, a prestigious family that controls the Tion Hegemony, which contains numerous star systems in the Outer Rim. Lord Tion is also a Commodore in the Imperial Navy, with close ties to both Grand Moff Tarkin and Darth Vader, having captained the Imperial Star Destroyer Devastator before Vader. While already a prestigious and powerful member of the Empire, Lord Tion – unsurprisingly – sought to further increase his standing within the Empire’s upper echelons.

Shortly before A New Hope, Lord Tion led the Empire’s brutal subjugation of the Core World Ralltiir, bombarding the planet from orbit before imposing martial law due to its opposition to the Empire and growing sympathy for the Rebel Alliance. Under the pretense of a mercy mission, Princess Leia and Captain Antilles supported Ralltiir’s local resistance with rebel troopers and the Rebellion’s powerful military equipment. Leia then manipulated Tion with his unrequited romantic feelings for her to leave Ralltiir without a cargo inspection, allowing her to escape a suspicious Darth Vader with a rebel spy aboard the Tantive IV.






 Where Is Lord Tion In A New Hope? 
Star Wars Radio Drama
         

Lord Tion appears again on Alderaan, hoping to propose to Princess Leia, though she and Bail Organa use his visit as an opportunity to learn more about the Death Star. While Leia and Bail Organa learned more about the Death Star, they accidentally led Lord Tion to discover their Rebel Alliance membership, leading Tion to threaten them and Alderaan with Imperial subjugation and interrogation. In their ensuing scuffle, Lord Tion’s blaster pistol discharged, killing the Imperial nobleman. Tion’s death was covered up by Bail Organa who framed the incident as a hunting accident in one of Alderaan’s nature preserves.

Despite dying so shortly before A New Hope, Lord Tion has a major impact on the movie, serving as a personal antagonist to Leia and providing her with additional intelligence. This allowed the Rebellion to initiate Operation Skyhook, whose climactic Battle of Toprawa ended with the theft of the Death Star plans. Moreover, the immediate aftermath of Lord Tion’s death shows the Rebellion’s rarely-seen darker side. While Lord Tion was undeniably a contemptible villain who died by his own hand, Bail Organa creating a cover story for his demise was a grim (albeit necessary) action for the sake of the Rebellion.




                  12 Biggest Ways Star Wars Legends Has Changed Lucasfilm&#39;s Disney-Era Canon   The Star Wars Legends continuity was a key part of the franchise for nearly 40 years and changed the Disney-era canon in many key ways.   



 Is Lord Tion In Star Wars Canon? 
The Rebellion Begins
         

Although Star Wars Legends became an alternate timeline in 2014, it continues to inspire elements of the current Star Wars canon. Lord Tion has yet to make a full appearance in the current continuity, but he is mentioned in Michael Kogge&#39;s The Rebellion Begins. Tion retains his title of Lord and serves aboard the Devastator, but is not likely the ship’s captain. The Obi-Wan Kenobi TV show establishes that the Devastator is Darth Vader’s flagship 4 years before this story takes place. If Lord Tion appears again in Star Wars canon, more elements of his Legends-era history could join the new continuity.
