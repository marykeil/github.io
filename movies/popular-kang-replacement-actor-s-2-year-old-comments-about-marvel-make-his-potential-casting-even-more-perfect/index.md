# Popular Kang Replacement Actor s 2-Year-Old Comments About Marvel Make His Potential Casting Even More Perfect


## SUMMARY 



  Colman Domingo&#39;s comments about wanting to play a Marvel or DC villain make the prospect of him playing Kang the Conqueror even more interesting.   Two years ago, Domingo mentioned being interested in taking on a role in a superhero movie, but explicitly stated he&#39;d rather play a villain than be a hero.   The actor has been a popular fan candidate for Kang&#39;s potential recasting, but at this time Marvel has not spoken about what will happen to Kang following Jonathan Majors being let go from the role.

## Literature Review

The rumors that Colman Domingo is replacing Jonathan Majors as Kang in the MCU make the actor&#39;s previous comments on Marvel even more interesting.




The rumors surrounding Colman Domingo joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Kang the Conqueror make a two-year-old quote from the actor all the more perfect. The Multiverse Saga is getting slowed down a bit in 2024 in light of Marvel Studios releasing fewer projects than usual. However, this delay may help with Marvel&#39;s biggest impending change, as the character of Kang is set to be either recast or retconned after Jonathan Majors was let go from the role.




Over the last few weeks, Domingo has emerged as a rumored candidate to replace Jonathan Majors as Kang, although Marvel Studios have yet to comment on those reports. However, Domingo had already previously discussed taking on a Marvel role two years prior in an interview with AwardsWatch, wherein he answered the question of whether he would jump in if offered an MCU role with a resounding &#34;I&#39;m jumping in,&#34; continuing by stating that, &#34;when it comes to Marvel or DC, I think I&#39;m ready now. You know I&#39;m worked out, fit, I think I want to play a villain - I just want to be the villain, I don&#39;t want to be the good guy,&#34; which makes the concept of him joining the MCU as its current biggest villain all the more interesting.

  2:23                       All Marvel Movies Releasing In 2024   The Marvel movies releasing in 2024 offer a range of film experiences - and some confusion, due to the changed dates of several incoming installments.   





 What Is Going On With Kang In The MCU? 
         

In 2023, Majors got into legal turmoil as he got arrested for misdemeanor charges, including assault, resulting in a court case that lasted for the majority of the year. At the time, Marvel Studios didn&#39;t comment on this legal battle, leaving any official response until after the verdict itself. Majors was found guilty of two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault, and is set to be sentenced on February 6. Once the trial verdict came in, Marvel Studios took swift action as they officially fired Majors the same day. While he is a first-time offender, Majors could potentially face up to a year in prison on the counts.



Following Majors&#39; firing, Marvel Studios is reportedly only referring to Avengers: The Kang Dynasty as Avengers 5.







With Majors let go from the role and Kang as a character receiving a mixed reception, it&#39;s currently unclear whether the MCU will simply recast Kang, or whether the villain may be moved out of the spotlight altogether. Hopefully, Marvel Studios will have a statement or update to share regarding this sooner rather than later.
