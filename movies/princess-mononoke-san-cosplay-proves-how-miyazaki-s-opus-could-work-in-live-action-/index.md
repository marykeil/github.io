## Literature Review

The titular character from Studio Ghibli&#39;s masterpiece comes alive in a stunning cosplay look complete with a wolf.




An iconic film by Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke has interesting character designs that are difficult to bring to live-action. However, one fan&#39;s cosplay of the titular character proves that it&#39;s possible. A post shared on Reddit by u/CraftyFox339 shows the user as San in her full warrior gear, including the mask and fur cape.




The photo is credited to Marlo Louden and is taken in a rocky area similar to a location from the film. There are red stains on the white clothing, representing the blood from San&#39;s battles. If this isn&#39;t impressive enough, there is a gray wolf standing on the rock behind the cosplayer. As explained in the comments, the wolf&#39;s name is Eowyn, and she lives at the Ohio Canid Center.


 

Based on their uploads, CraftyFox339 is no stranger to anime cosplay, having recreated amazing looks from anime such as My Hero Academia and Toilet-Bound Hanako-Kun.

 Princess Mononoke&#39;s San Cosplay Represents One Of The Film&#39;s Central Themes 
Princess Mononoke is originally created by Studio Ghibli
          

The 1997 masterpiece is a complex story with nuanced characters and environmentalist messages. The story follows Ashitaka, an Emishi prince from the Muromachi Period of Japan, as he goes on a journey to find a cure for his curse. As he heads West, he comes to a village called Iron Town, which serves as a refuge for people who have been cast out by society. It&#39;s run by Lady Eboshi, whose actions eventually cause a war between humankind and the natural world. Ashitaka discovers that at the center of the conflict is San, a human girl who was raised by wolves.

A recurring motif in Ghibli&#39;s films is the relationship between humanity and nature. Princess Mononoke is the very embodiment of this theme, using the people of Iron Town and the animal deities to show how a war between the two sides will only lead to disaster. It emphasizes that balance is necessary for them to peacefully exist alongside each other. CraftyFox339&#39;s cosplay does an excellent job of illustrating the film&#39;s idea, as it not only pays tribute to the characters but also shows a person immersing themselves in nature. The photo looks to be taken in a forest and features the cosplayer with a majestic gray wolf.




Despite having been released over 26 years ago, Princess Mononoke remains popular among anime fans. Considered one of Ghibli&#39;s most mature releases due to its complex themes and violent subject matter, it was the studio&#39;s first film to receive a PG-13 rating in the US. It does a masterful job of showing the duality in people, particularly through the character of Lady Eboshi, who is both altruistic towards her people and violent towards the animals. Among the film&#39;s most powerful attributes, however, are its environmental messages, which are expertly brought to life by CraftyFox339&#39;s Princess Mononoke cosplay.
