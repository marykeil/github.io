# Indiana Jones VFX Breakdown Reveals Which Parts Of Dial Of Destiny Were Practical


## SUMMARY 



  A new breakdown video shared by ILM reveals just how extensively Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny relies on VFX for its action scenes.   A frequent criticism of the film is that it relies too heavily on digital effects, echoing complaints made about Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.   Compared to iconic sequences from the original trilogy, many VFX-heavy action sequences in the new movies don&#39;t have the same impact.

## Literature Review

A new breakdown video shared by ILM breaks down which parts of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny were VFX and which parts were practical.




Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny gets a new VFX breakdown video, revealing just how much of the movie was accomplished digitally. Directed by James Mangold, the fifth and final installment in the Indiana Jones franchise sees Harrison Ford suit up as the swashbuckling archaeologist to quest after Archimedes&#39; Antikythera mechanism. The film features all the action one has come to expect from the series, including a sequence in which Ford is de-aged by about 35 years.




Now, Industrial Light &amp; Magic has shared a new video on YouTube breaking down notable VFX sequences featured in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, including the de-aged prologue. Check out the video below:


 

The video provides a look behind the curtain at how Mangold and the production mixed practical elements with visual effects, revealing just how crucial digital effects were to bringing the film to life.

The Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny reviews were somewhat mixed compared to past installments, and a central sticking point is the film&#39;s reliance on visual effects. This certainly isn&#39;t a knock against the hard-working VFX artists who helped bring the film to life, just a note that the digital imagery, in this case, doesn&#39;t feel or look the same as the practical, tangible effects that the original trilogy is known for.






As seen in the breakdown video above, the de-aging sequence in Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny uses deepfake technology that pulls from hundreds of hours of Ford&#39;s previous performances. 




Unfortunately, this continues a trend set in 2008&#39;s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That film, which is directed by franchise veteran Steven Spielberg, has been widely criticized for featuring an abundance of ridiculous, VFX-heavy sequences. This includes Indy&#39;s survival of a nuclear blast inside a refrigerator, Mutt&#39;s (Shia LaBeouf) swinging through a jungle on vines with a pack of monkeys, and the ending sequence&#39;s alien and UFO action.

  

While there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with VFX-heavy sequences like these, they arguably don&#39;t belong in this particular franchise. The Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ending, among a host of other scenes, may fit thematically and spiritually with past installments, but it just feels artificial. Compared to the tank chase in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade or the truck sequence in Raiders of the Lost Ark, many sequences in the new movie just don&#39;t have as much of an impact.






Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is currently available to stream on Disney Plus.
