# Star Wars Why Obi-Wan Really Calls Vader “Darth” In A New Hope


## SUMMARY 



  During production of A New Hope, the term &#34;Darth&#34; was initially intended to be Vader&#39;s first name and not a Sith title.   The introduction of the Sith religion in the prequels retconned &#34;Darth&#34; as a title for dark side warriors.   The Disney&#43; series Obi-Wan Kenobi provides a canon explanation for Obi-Wan referring to Vader as &#34;Darth&#34; in A New Hope, that being that Obi-Wan&#39;s conflict with Vader in the series allowed him to realize that Anakin was truly gone.

## Literature Review

Obi-Wan knew very well that Darth was a Sith title, so why does he refer to Vader as &#34;Darth&#34; in a New Hope as if it were the villains&#39; first name?




Among the many mysteries that a chronological watch of the Star Wars saga brings is the question of why Obi-Wan refers to Vader as “Darth” in Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope. Despite being the original Star Wars and one of the best-ranked movies, A New Hope is chronologically the fourth story in the saga meaning that it should be in line with everything established in the prequel trilogy. Despite the 19 in-universe years that separate Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, the latter is supposed to work as a continuation of the stories of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker, and the Skywalker twins.




After Return of the Jedi concluded the original and often best-ranked Star Wars trilogy, George Lucas decided to show the early life of Anakin Skywalker in the prequels. A sequel to the stories of Luke, Leia, and Han would then be made in 2015 under the Disney umbrella, with upcoming Star Wars movies set to go beyond even those tales. Such an odd approach to the chronology of a franchise is bound to create canon inconsistencies such as Obi-Way saying “Only a master of evil, Darth” when the Jedi master should have known that “Darth” was a Sith title and not the villain&#39;s first name after the prequel trilogy.


 The Term &#34;Darth&#34; Was Retconned As A Sith Title For The Star Wars Prequels 
          

The reason behind Obi-Wan dubbing Vader as Darth is that, at the time of production pre-1977, the word was not supposed to be a title that would be used by other villains in the saga. The name “Darth” was essentially intended to be Vader&#39;s first name and only associated with the character himself, holding no connections to any others. As the saga progressed George Lucas introduced the concept of the Sith religion, something that was much more of a focus in the prequel trilogy that began in 2001.




                  All 35 Sith Lords In Star Wars Canon   The greatest villains of Star Wars, the Sith are the Jedi&#39;s most fearsome enemies. Here are all 35 Dark Lords of the Sith revealed to date.   

With this deeper exploration of the Sith religion came more lore elements regarding the dark side zealots. As such, Lucas revived the term &#34;Darth&#34; for the prequels, only now retconned as a title given to the dark side warriors such as Darth Maul, Darth Tyranus, and Darth Sidious among others. Like several of the other Star Wars plot holes and inconsistencies - such as Leia stating she remembers her biological mother when the prequels revealed the latter died in childbirth - Obi-Wan referring to Vader as “Darth” can simply be explained by the fact that Star Wars was not conceived or produced chronologically.



 Obi-Wan Kenobi Provided A Canon Reason For A New Hope&#39;s &#34;Darth&#34; Usage 
          




With the production timeline considered, it is possible to find a canon explanation for the “only a master of evil, Darth” line. This explanation was found in 2022&#39;s Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Disney&#43; series that culminated with Obi-Wan encountering Anakin/Vader for the first time since Revenge of the Sith. In the series finale, Obi-Wan attempts to apologize to Anakin for the latter&#39;s fall to the dark side. Vader retorts that he destroyed Anakin before Obi-Wan realizes that his friend is truly gone for good, bidding him farewell with the words &#34;Goodbye... Darth.&#34;

This scene in Obi-Wan Kenobi is canonically set around nine years before the two eventually meet again aboard the Death Star. As such, by the time of A New Hope, Obi-Wan has had time to reconcile this meeting after realizing that his friend is gone. The use of the word &#34;Darth&#34; in both scenes solidifies this, providing a neat link and a canon explanation as to why Obi-Wan Kenobi calls Vader by his Sith title in the first released Star Wars movie.
