# Henry Cavill s New Spy Movie Could Become A Trilogy Based On Upcoming Books


## SUMMARY 



  Matthew Vaughn plans to create a trilogy of films based on Henry Cavill&#39;s spy movie Argylle, with the first film focusing on Elly Conway and the other two exploring the backstory of the titular spy character.   The Argylle franchise is already ambitious, with the films and books intertwined to create a multimedia experience for viewers and readers.   Cavill&#39;s role in Argylle may be a fakeout in the first film, but future installments could develop his character within the fictional setting, potentially reflecting the actual spy&#39;s first mission.

## Literature Review

Henry Cavill&#39;s new spy movie Argylle could become a trilogy based on upcoming books written by Elly Conway, reveals director Matthew Vaughn.




Argylle director Matthew Vaughn has revealed plans for a trilogy of films based in the world of Henry Cavill&#39;s new spy movie. The upcoming action comedy focuses on Elly Conway (Bryce Dallas Howard), an author targeted by a crime syndicate after her fictional Argylle books predict the future. A series of real books by the real Conway are set to be released.




Speaking with Total Film via GamesRadar, Vaughn revealed that, after the Argylle film focused on Elly is released, there are plans for two other films exploring the backstory of the titular spy character played by Cavill. The director indicates one movie will be an adaptation of the upcoming first book, while the third movie involves details he can&#39;t spoil. Check out what Vaughn had to say below:


Book one is about: how did Argylle become a spy? That will be the next film. And then Argylle 2 is – I don’t want to give it all away, but there’s the young Argylle, and that becomes Henry, because Henry loves the idea of doing a proper Argylle movie as well.



 Argylle Is Already An Ambitious Multimedia Franchise 
          

In October 2023, Vaughn revealed that Argylle is based on a book series that hasn&#39;t been written yet. He explained that, while book 1 will be an in-universe book written by Conway, the first movie is an adaptation of book 4, which won&#39;t arrive until much later. This entwines the experience of the planned books and films, making the meta spy story a multimedia franchise already.




While this means Cavill&#39;s role in Argylle is a fakeout for the first movie, future installments could further develop his character within the fictional setting. Since Elly&#39;s books are predicting real events in her world, it&#39;s also possible the titular spy is real and portrayed by the action star. This means a prequel film exploring his origins could be a reflection of the actual spy&#39;s first mission.

                  Henry Cavill&#39;s New Movie Twist Makes Playing James Bond Even Less Likely   With the character information provided by Argylle&#39;s most recent preview, the possibility of Henry Cavill playing James Bond is essentially at an end.   

Although it&#39;s unclear how successful Argylle will be, Vaughn has plenty of ambitions for the project if it&#39;s able to go beyond the first movie. For now, it doesn&#39;t seem like the mystery of its multimedia aspects will be clear until the books are released. When they do, it may provide some answers to what viewers can expect from this new action-packed franchise.






Argylle arrives in theaters on February 2, 2024, almost a month after the first book is released.
