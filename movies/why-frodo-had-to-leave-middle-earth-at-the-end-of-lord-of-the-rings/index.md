# Why Frodo Had To Leave Middle-earth At The End Of Lord Of The Rings


## SUMMARY 



Frodo leaves Middle-earth for the Undying Lands due to the lasting physical injuries he sustained on his journey, which couldn&#39;t be cured in Middle-earth but would not be fatal in the Undying Lands.

Frodo&#39;s decision to leave Middle-earth is also influenced by his emotional trauma and the annual return of the pain from his injuries, which haunted him every year.

The Undying Lands can be seen as a metaphor for Frodo making peace with his own traumatic experiences, leaving behind the soldier he was and finding a new life free from the horrors of war.
