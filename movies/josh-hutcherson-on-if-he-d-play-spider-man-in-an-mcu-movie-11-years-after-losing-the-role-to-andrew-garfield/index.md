## Literature Review

After losing The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s lead role to Andrew Garfield, Josh Hutcherson states whether he&#39;s open to playing Peter Parker in a Marvel film.




Josh Hutcherson comments on the possibility of joining the MCU as a Spider-Man variant despite not being cast in The Amazing Spider-Man. After Sam Raimi&#39;s Spider-Man 4 was canceled and Sony began developing a reboot, various stars were considered for the starring role of Peter Parker. Some of the actors who were almost cast as Spider-Man back then included Oppenheimer actor Alden Ehrenreich, Billy Elliot lead Jamie Bell, and Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson. Eventually, The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s titular role went to The Social Network actor Andrew Garfield.




In an interview with Inverse, Josh Hutcherson states that he&#39;s open to playing Spider-Man in a future Marvel movie. Hutcherson also explains that he was never informed whether he was cast or not, and that he didn&#39;t receive feedback on his audition. Read Hutcherson&#39;s comments below:


“I was a big Spider-Man fan all my life growing up from the old-school cartoons and stuff. But yeah, I&#39;d be open to it, man. I&#39;d throw some webs around.”



“They just end up hiring somebody else. So I never found out why. I also do know that three weeks or so after I auditioned, I ended up getting Hunger Games, so it kind of worked out.”



 How The MCU Multiverse Can Introduce Josh Hutcherson&#39;s Spider-Man 
          

The MCU&#39;s Spider-Man is unlikely to be recast anytime soon, but Josh Hutcherson can still play the webslinger thanks to the Marvel multiverse. Spider-Man: No Way Home already brought three live-action Spider-Men together on the big screen. Therefore, future multiversal MCU movies like Avengers 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars — if not also the MCU&#39;s Spider-Man 4 and its sequels — could feature cameos by other Spider-Man variants from alternate universes, including Josh Hutcherson&#39;s Peter Parker. For example, Avengers: Secret Wars&#39; interdimensional conflict could allow Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man to reunite with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield&#39;s Peter Parkers once again, this time alongside never-seen-before variants from other alternate realities.




Alternatively, Josh Hutcherson could appear in the animated Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse as a live-action member of the Spider-Society. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse confirmed that Miguel O&#39;Hara and the Spider-Society have identified all three live-action Spider-Men, and Donald Glover&#39;s Aaron Davis made an appearance as a multiversal prisoner. Since adding Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, or Tobey Maguire to Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse could further complicate the connection between the MCU&#39;s multiverse and Sony&#39;s Spider-Verse, Josh Hutcherson could instead make a brief cameo as an alternate version of The Amazing Spider-Man&#39;s Peter Parker.

Another option for Josh Hutcherson&#39;s Spider-Man is in Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe, where he could be revealed to coexist with Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom, Aaron Taylor-Johnson&#39;s Kraven, and Dakota Johnson&#39;s Madame Web. However, Peter Parker isn&#39;t the only Spider-Man Josh Hutcherson could play in a future Marvel movie. Whether in Avengers: Secret Wars, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, or Venom 3, Hutcherson could also be cast as a different Spider-Person. For instance, he could play a live-action Ben Reilly or Kaine Parker, both of whom have taken up the Spider-Man mantle in the comics.
