Summary
 John Wick consistently defies death in intense fights, like surviving being thrown off a balcony and attacked by multiple assailants. 
 He fights through injuries, like being stabbed, to continue battling enemies, showcasing his endurance and willpower. 
 John&#39;s ability to survive dangerous situations is partly due to the support and resources provided by allies such as Marcus and Charon. 


Throughout the John Wick saga, the title character demonstrates an unnatural ability to survive almost any dire situation. John Wick (Keanu Reeves) regularly walks off gunshot wounds, car crashes, and falls that should break bones. As the series goes on, the stakes get higher and the battles John finds himself in become increasingly more intense.
Reeves underwent rigorous training to bring to life a character who is known for his endurance. One of the John Wick movies&#39; most important quotes, which effectively sums up John&#39;s entire character, comes from the first movie&#39;s main villain Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist): “John is a man of focus, commitment, sheer will.&#34; The most famous fights that take place in John Wick movies are the ones where John proves these words time and time again.









 








 10  Gets Thrown Off A Balcony At The Red Circle 
John Wick
        

  John Wick  


  Release Date    October 24, 2014     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Michael Nyqvist , Willem Dafoe , Jason Isaacs , Keanu Reeves , Bridget Moynahan , Adrianne Palicki     Rating    R    


John Wick regularly defies death by taking on twenty assailants by himself. However, when John goes to the Red Circle nightclub in pursuit of Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen), he is also stabbed before being thrown over a balcony by Kirill (Daniel Bernhardt). He hits the ground with nothing to break his fall. While the audience realizes that injuries that should be fatal will not affect John, this sequence also segues into more exposition on the setting and the Continental Hotel. John asks to see a doctor when he gets back to the Continental, demonstrating how the hotel provides everything an assassin might need.





 9  The Opening Sequence Of Chapter 3 
John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum


 







  John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum  


  Release Date    May 17, 2019     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Halle Berry , Mark Dacascos , Cecep Arif Rahman , Keanu Reeves , Angelica Huston , Yayan Ruhian , Laurence Fishburne , Jason Mantzoukas , Ian McShane , Asia Kate Dillon , Lance Reddick , Tiger Hu Chen     Rating    R    


John engages in a continuous string of fights taking place in some odd locations for the first 20 minutes of John Wick: Chapter 3. First, John is attacked by a single hitman while retrieving supplies from a library and is stabbed through the shoulder during this fight. He is also still injured from the events of John Wick: Chapter 2&#39;s ending, powering through wounds to the abdomen and visibly limping. After the library, he runs to “Doc’s” (Randall Duk Kim) office to get stitched up and retrieve some medication.
John then flees and ends up in a shop full of antique weapons and fights several assassins while retrieving knives from display cases. He then runs to the next location – a stable for horses – and fights off several more assailants before riding away on a horse. John is always able to fight off a ridiculous number of enemies, and the meds help him continue despite his injuries. However, this sequence is still an impressive feat of strength and skill.

 8  Fight With Cassian In Rome 
John Wick: Chapter 2
        

  John Wick: Chapter 2  


  Release Date    February 10, 2017     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    John Leguizamo , Ian McShane , Thomas Sadoski , Common , Keanu Reeves , David Patrick Kelly , Lance Reddick , Laurence Fishburne , Ruby Rose , Peter Stormare , Bridget Moynahan     Rating    R    


 John Wick: Chapter 2 introduces Cassian (Common) as a formidable adversary to John. After John &#34;kills&#34; Cassian&#39;s charge Gianna D&#39;Antonio (Claudia Gerini), the two hitmen engage in a brutal fight. During the fight, they both tumble down a lot of stairs around the Rome Continental, which would have killed or broken bones for anyone except these two men. While Cassian is set up as a bigger threat to John than other unnamed assassins, the general circumstances in which they meet are also dangerous. The first time they meet, the setting provides extra barriers. The second time, John is fleeing every other assassin in New York. Yet John survives meeting Cassian both times.





 7  Almost Hanged By The Ruska Roma 
John Wick: Chapter 4
        

  John Wick: Chapter 4  


  Release Date    March 24, 2023     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Hiroyuki Sanada , Clancy Brown , Scott Adkins , Keanu Reeves , Ian McShane , Bill Skarsgard , Laurence Fishburne , Rina Sawayama , Donnie Yen , Lance Reddick , Shamier Anderson     Rating    R    


In John Wick: Chapter 4, John travels to Berlin to get the Ruska Roma to support his duel with the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård). They are not pleased to see him because everyone who is a potential ally of John Wick is being hunted by the High Table. Katia (Natalia Tena) orders John to be strangled with a slowly tightening noose. John manages to speak and proposes his plan. Katia releases him and John goes to his next fight, when almost being strangled would incapacitate most people for some time.





 6  Motorcycle Fight &amp; Crash 
John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum


 







John Wick: Chapter 3 finds another interesting location for a fight as John returns to the New York Continental: on a highway while everyone is riding motorcycles. Zero (Mark Dacascos) and others are pursuing John on bikes and unsheath blades in unison. John not only has the dexterity to adapt quickly to fighting on a motorcycle, but survives crashing in front of the Continental with no helmet. Once John touches the front steps of the hotel, he is declared &#34;safe&#34; by Charon (Lance Reddick) and Zero cannot attack him as he is on Continental grounds.
            
 
 12 Best John Wick Fight Scenes From Across All 4 Movies 
The John Wick franchise is filled with memorable fight scenes, but these stand above the rest, and include some of the best action in modern cinema.








 5  Winston Shoots Him Off The Continental Roof 
John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum
        

After John helps Winston (Ian McShane) and Charon defend the New York Continental from the High Table in John Wick: Chapter 3&#39;s ending, Winston betrays John. The Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) is willing to give the Continental back to Winston, but John’s transgressions against the High Table are still a problem. In order to secure his power, Winston shoots John several times and sends him toppling off the roof of the Continental. 
If the bullets hadn&#39;t killed John, the fall definitely should have. He hits several awnings and a fire escape on the way down and probably should have broken his neck. At least in this instance, the movie doesn’t pretend that John is capable of walking away on his own after this and one of the Bowery King’s (Laurence Fishburne) people picks him up.





 4  Fight With Killa Harkan 
John Wick: Chapter 4
        

Katia says that she will consider allowing John to rejoin the Ruska Roma if he kills Killa Harkan (Scott Adkins), the man responsible for her father&#39;s death. John goes to Killa&#39;s nightclub in Berlin and a fight ensues, during which John is again thrown over a decorative waterfall and endures another bone-breaking landing before getting up and continuing to fight. Killa frustratedly shouts, &#34;Why don&#39;t you just die?&#34; He is not the first nor the last person to ask that.





 3  Marcus Saves Him From Being Suffocated 
John Wick
        

In the first John Wick movie, Marcus (Willem Dafoe) is revealed to have been a steadfast ally all along when Viggo&#39;s men are smothering John. Marcus saves John by shooting one of the men, giving John the chance to fight back. John recovers from being suffocated very quickly and is able to fight off and kill both men, despite being restrained. He then continues to the men outside, defeats them, and corners Viggo. John’s unnatural physical resistance comes into play in this scene, as does the loyalty others have towards him. He would have died if Marcus had not come to his rescue.





 2  Winston Gives Him An Hour To Run 
John Wick: Chapter 2
        

In addition to physical endurance, John has an unnatural ability to sway other characters through sheer gravitas. At the end of John Wick: Chapter 2, when Winston chooses to give John an hour to run before declaring him Excommunicado. In contrast, Winston has Perkins quickly and mercilessly killed for the same crime of “conducting business” on Continental grounds in the first movie&#39;s ending. When John asks, &#34;Why am I not dead?&#34; Winston merely says, &#34;Because I deemed it not to be.&#34; John survives here because he has impressed Winston with his skill and noble intentions, earning some kind of loyalty.

 1  Fight On The Stairs Of Sacré-Cœur 
John Wick: Chapter 4


 







Leading up to John Wick: Chapter 4&#39;s ending, John is trying to get to the Sacré-Cœur in Paris by sunrise for his High Table duel. In one night, he has already defied death several times in multiple car crashes around the Arc de Triomphe. Mr. Nobody (Shamier Anderson) also spares John when John saves his dog. After all this, John finally reaches the stairs leading up to Sacré-Cœur. John looks exhausted at just the thought of walking up all the stairs – before a bunch of people show up to fight him all the way up.
John has almost reached the top when he is kicked hard and is sent brutally rolling down all the stairs. His fall is paused midway when a man throws him into a lamp post – which should have broken his back – and he continues falling. Caine (Donnie Yen) then arrives and encourages John to rise again, and they impossibly fight their way back up in time for the duel. This now-famous scene is just one time in the John Wick franchise when John survives when it seems impossible.
