## SUMMARY 



  Back to the Future pays homage to the 1923 film Safety Last! in its opening and ending scenes, with a clock tower scene from the classic comedy being referenced.   The clock depicting the famous scene from Safety Last! in Doc Brown&#39;s collection foreshadows the similar perilous situation he finds himself in at the end of the film.   The homage to Safety Last! was intentional on the part of the filmmakers, who wanted to connect the climax of Back to the Future to the classic film that inspired it.

## Literature Review

Back to the Future&#39;s opening and ending are two of the movie&#39;s most famous parts, but they also reference a classic film from 62 years prior.




Back to the Future&#39;s opening and ending are two of the most iconic parts of the franchise, but these famous moments actually pay homage to a movie that came out 62 years earlier. Filmmakers often sneak references to their inspirations into their own films, with paying homage to the classics being a trend that can still be found in Hollywood to this day. However, many viewers haven&#39;t caught on to one of the biggest movie references in Back to the Future, with the beginning and end of the film containing a sneaky reference to a classic film that many may have missed.




Back to the Future is one of the most famous sci-fi movies of all time, with the beloved Robert Zemeckis film still having a massive influence on pop culture years later. Despite the film having some dated references, Back to the Future has aged incredibly well, with many of the other jokes and nods to pop culture still working even if it goes over the heads of some audience members. However, one homage to a classic film that inspired parts of Back to the Future has gone almost completely unnoticed by viewers who aren&#39;t fans of classic cinema, and here&#39;s what it is.

                  Back To The Future&#39;s Original Cast &amp; Why 3 Actors Were Replaced   The Back To The Future classic movie would have looked very different if three of the first actors cast as main characters had not been replaced.   


 Back To The Future&#39;s Opening Pays Homage To 1923&#39;s Safety Last! 
          




As it turns out, Back to the Future&#39;s opening pays homage to the 1923 film Safety Last!, which was released 62 years before the Robert Zemeckis classic. The film is a silent comedy starring Harold Lloyd and directed by Fred C. Newmeyer and Sam Taylor, with it following a man who moves and tries to make it in the big city. In an attempt to win a prize being put on by a grocery store, the main character&#39;s pal decides to climb the building as a publicity stunt, although things quickly go awry upon the duo undertaking this exciting task.

Back to the Future opens with a scene that shows off Doc Brown&#39;s massive clock collection, and as it turns out, one of these clocks is a direct reference to Safety Last!. The most famous scene from Safety Last! features a character precariously hanging from the hand of a clock tower, with him dangerously dangling over the city below. One of Doc Brown&#39;s many clocks depicts this scene, and while it isn&#39;t directly commented on by the characters, the prop seems like a pretty clear reference to the classic slapstick comedy Safety Last!. However, this isn&#39;t Back to the Future&#39;s only reference to the film.






 Doc&#39;s Clock Tower Scene From The Movie&#39;s Ending Also Mirrors The 1923 Film 
          

While the Safety Last! clock is a clear nod to the 1923 film, Back to the Future brings back the homage at the end of the film. While attempting to get Marty McFly&#39;s DeLorean struck by lightning, one of the cables comes loose, causing Doc Brown to have to climb the clock tower. Doc Brown slips at one point and is only saved by the hand of the clock tower, with him precariously hanging above the city below. The scene does put Doc Brown in real danger, but it is played for laughs, which is why it&#39;s a perfect homage to Safety Last!.

This moment in Back to the Future&#39;s final scene is an almost perfect recreation of the Safety Last! stunt, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so great. It not only brings the reference back, but it also connects the climax of the film to its original Safety Last! reference. The Safety Last! clock secretly tells you what will happen in Back to the Future&#39;s ending after only a few minutes, with Doc Brown ending up in the same position as the clock that he owns. This causes the reference to act as a brilliant moment of foreshadowing, making it more than just a homage to an old comedy film.






 Why Back To The Future References Safety Last! 
         

Although Back to the Future&#39;s Safety Last! inspirations haven&#39;t been directly commented on, the reference was definitely intentional. According to Back to the Future screenwriter Bob Gale, the crew behind Back to the Future specifically decided to feature the clock due to its connection to the end of the film (via THR). It&#39;s entirely possible that Robert Zemeckis or Bob Gale saw Safety Last! when they were younger, with them realizing the parallels while making Back to the Future and intentionally inserting some nods to the classic film into their own work.
