A startling revelation was made about the Cowardly Lion costume by Redditors thanks to the auction: the costume was &#34;constructed of lion skin and fur&#34;. Redditors were left in disbelief, with mdhunter99 noting, &#34;That..is..disgusting..&#34; However. the Cowardly Lion costume is just one of many troubling aspects of The Wizard of Oz production. Another infamous example is the Tin Man&#39;s costume. Actor Jack Haley, who played the Tin Man, was exposed to toxic aluminum dust from the silver paint used for his costume (via Time). This hazardous material caused severe eye infections and respiratory issues, a stark illustration of the dangerous and unregulated working conditions in early Hollywood.


 

Moreover, Judy Garland endured significant mistreatment during the filming (via Biography). The 13-year-old Garland was subjected to extreme measures to maintain her youthful appearance and slim figure. She was allegedly forced to smoke up to 80 cigarettes a day and took medication to suppress her appetite. Between animal cruelty, unsafe conditions for actors, and child abuse, these distressing stories from the set of The Wizard of Oz highlight the dark side of Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age, where the glamour of the silver screen often came at a high personal cost to those involved.
