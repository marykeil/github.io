## Literature Review

A new video showcases a cosplayer dressing up as Keanu Reeves&#39; Neo from The Matrix and recreating the character&#39;s exploits in a variety of stunts.




The Matrix&#39;s Neo has been brought to life in a new stunt video. Neo is the character played by Keanu Reeves in the 1999 smash science fiction hit The Matrix and its sequels. The original movie followed Neo discovering that he is The One, a figure of prophecy who is meant to tap into the power of and eventually destroy The Matrix, a computer simulation in which humanity is trapped while being used as batteries for machines in a dystopian future of which they are unaware.

The video showcases the man performing various Matrix-inspired stunts while dressed as Neo. This includes ducking and jumping over a moving barricade, balancing inside a spinning ring, and running along the wall of a stairwell.


 The Legacy Of The Matrix Can&#39;t Be Overstated 
          

This recreation of Neo&#39;s feats of power in The Matrix just goes to show how much the movie has permeated the culture in the nearly two-and-a-half decades since its original release. This has been exhibited in many ways, including the expansion of the franchise itself. The Matrix franchise now boasts three feature-length live-action sequels and an animated anthology movie, in addition to tie-in video games, comic books, and more.






The 2003 movie The Animatrix brought together several titans of Japanese animation for a series of short films set in the Matrix universe.




In addition to the official installments in the Matrix franchise, the movies&#39; most iconic moments have been parodied or paid homage to in dozens of different properties over the years. This encompasses a wide range, including relatively minor sequences such as Fiona mimicking Neo&#39;s &#34;bullet time&#34; action in 2001&#39;s Shrek and Granny pulling off a similar stunt in 2021&#39;s Space Jam: A New Legacy. However, the influence of The Matrix can also be seen in the burgeoning popularity of science fiction and kung fu cinema at the turn of the millennium.

The characters and ideology of the franchise have also bled over into real life in many ways, for better and for worse. In addition to The Matrix&#39;s Neo having his stunts so dutifully recreated in this new video, this includes the increasingly popular conspiracy theory that the perceived reality of humankind is a simulation. The franchise is at the center of a huge movement in pop culture, science fiction, and philosophy, which has more than explained why the original movie still has such longevity.
