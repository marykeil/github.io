## Literature Review

After the huge success of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Ghostbusters 5 is on the way, but which characters are returning and where is the sequel set? 




Following the success of the soft reboot Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the sequel was fast-tracked by Sony â€” and the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire news is coming in quickly. The Ghostbusters series started in 1984, and the classic fantasy comedy movie became a huge success thanks to its unique high concept, a hit theme song, and stellar chemistry between its comedic leads. However, following the beloved original film, the Ghostbusters series fell from grace, as Ghostbusters II was generally considered a disappointment when it was released and Ghostbusters III received a mixed-to-negative reception in 2016.




2021&#39;s Ghostbusters: Afterlife saved the franchise and was considered a significant return to form for the Ghostbusters series. The movie was full of energy, excitement, and fantasy, and it was surprisingly emotional too, as it brought back original characters including Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd. The refreshing take was mostly thanks to writer-director Jason Reitman, who was previously known for emotionally resonant indie films, and he injected some of that energy into the blockbuster Ghostbusters franchise. The 2021 movie&#39;s success ensured a sequel of its own, and the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire news is hugely revealing.

After a year full of delays due to the Hollywood strikes, the latest news regarding the much-anticipated legacy sequel is that Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has bumped its release date up and will arrive sooner than originally announced. Initially slated to arrive on March 29th, 2024, the movie will now premiere a week earlier on March 22nd. Though the film is a sure-fire hit, the move is likely to take advantage of the spring break box office surge.
