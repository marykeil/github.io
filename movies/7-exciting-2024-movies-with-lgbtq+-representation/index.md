# 7 Exciting 2024 Movies With LGBTQ&#43; Representation


## SUMMARY 


 LGBTQ&#43; representation in films is important for a more accurate portrayal of the real world, even if it doesn&#39;t define a character entirely. 
 Exciting LGBTQ&#43; films are coming in 2024, with a range of genres and tones, from comedies to dramas. 
 Wicked: Part One has significant LGBTQ&#43; representation in its cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, and may have the most representation among the upcoming films.

## Literature Review

As the world continues to see plenty of LGBTQ&#43; themed films, it proves that representation is more important than ever, with even more coming in 2024.




In recent years, there have been plenty of new films being released featuring LGBTQ&#43; representation, and 2024 is going to be no different. The incorporation of characters with varying genders and sexualities makes for a more accurate portrayal of the real world, whether the plot of the film revolves around these topics or not. It&#39;s worth noting that even though this representation is important, gender and sexuality do not always have to entirely define a character, which is why it is important to have multiple movies from all different genres and tones featuring LGBTQ&#43; characters.
There have already been some brilliant LGBTQ&#43; themed movies in recent years. Some have seen a focus on queer stories within their plots, such as Blue Jean, and some have simply had LGBTQ&#43; leads, such as Can You Ever Forgive Me?. 2024 has some exciting upcoming releases in that aspect, from comedies to dramas and everything in between.









 








 7  Good Grief 
Available on Netflix January 5


 







  Good Grief  


  Release Date    January 5, 2024     Director    Dan Levy     Cast    Dan Levy , Ruth Negga , Himesh Patel , Luke Evans , Celia Imrie    


The end of 2023 saw a lot of hype for Good Grief, starring Schitt&#39;s Creek&#39;s Dan Levy, who made his directorial debut with this film. While there was a very limited theater release of the film, it wasn&#39;t available to the wider public until January and is now available for streaming on Netflix in 37 countries. In this heartbreaking tale, Marc (Levy) is pulled through a period of grief and pain by his friends after the sudden death of his husband of many years, Oliver (Luke Evans).
With themes of love and friendship, Good Grief is already becoming a notable addition to LGBTQ&#43; films. This is not only because of the plot but also within Good Grief&#39;s cast, which not only includes Levy and Evans but also Arnaud Valois, who identifies as gay. It also saw some great non-binary representation with the casting of Emma Corrin, who is best known for playing Princess Diana in The Crown season 4.





 6  Mean Girls 
In theaters January 12 &amp; streaming on Paramount&#43; TBA


 







  Mean Girls (2024)  


  Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    Samantha Jayne , Arturo Perez Jr.     Cast    Angourie Rice , Auli&#39;i Cravalho , Jaquel Spivey , ReneÃ© Rapp , Jon Hamm , Ashley Park , Jenna Fischer , Tina Fey , Tim Meadows    


The remake of the classic teen comedy Mean Girls was released in January, with writer Tina Fey rebooting the film twenty years after the original. 2024&#39;s Mean Girls is an adaptation of the musical, which ran from 2018 to 2020 on Broadway. Mean Girls is remembered in the LGBTQ&#43; community for many reasons, but especially for Damian, portrayed by Jaquel Spivey in the 2024 remake. While the majority of the main characters have been recast, which makes sense given them being high schoolers, there are some from the original who are returning for the remake.
Not only did Fey play Miss Norbury again, but the Mean Girls remake also saw Tim Meadows reprising his role as Principal Duvall. One of the original Plastics did make a brief appearance, however, with Lindsay Lohan making a Mean Girls cameo, with the Cady from the 2004 original playing the moderator of the mathematics competition. Mean Girls has become such a memorable film in popular culture that it&#39;s surprising that it was remade, but given the success of the musical, if any film can hold up to its original, it&#39;s this one.





 5  Ponyboi

However, it will be available to watch from the Sundance Film Festival website.





 4  Drive-Away Dolls 
In theaters February 23
        

  Drive-Away Dolls  


  Release Date    September 22, 2023     Director    Ethan Coen     Cast    Margaret Qualley , Geraldine Viswanathan , Beanie Feldstein , Pedro Pascal , Colman Domingo , Bill Camp , Matt Damon    


Drive-Away Dolls tells the story of Jamie (Margaret Qualley), who embarks on a road trip with her friend Marian (Geraldine Viswanathan), following her breakup with her girlfriend, but the two get caught up in chaos and crime along the way. Drive-Away Dolls&#39; long-awaited release was pushed back from September 2023 following the WGA strikes, but the project has been causing anticipation for even longer, being initially announced back in 2007. While little is known about the details of the plot, and whether Jamie&#39;s sexuality will take a prominent role in the film, there&#39;s sure to be plenty of drama.





 3  Love Lies Bleeding 
In theaters March 8
        

  Love Lies Bleeding  


  Release Date    March 8, 2024     Director    Rose Glass     Cast    Kristen Stewart , Katy O&#39;Brian , Jena Malone , Anna Baryshnikov , Dave Franco , Ed Harris    


Love Lies Bleeding tells the story of a budding relationship between a bodybuilder on her way to Vegas to pursue her dream and a local gym manager. However, things don&#39;t quite go to plan, and the two get caught up with Lou&#39;s crime family. Kristen Stewart stars as bodybuilder Lou, having gotten involved with the project as she was a fan of director Rose Glass&#39; previous work Saint Maud. According to the official synopsis, Lou will identify as bisexual, the same as Stewart, who came out in 2017.





 2  Challengers 
In theaters April 26
        

  Challengers  


  Release Date    April 26, 2024     Director    Luca Guadagnino     Cast    Zendaya , Josh O&#39;Connor , Mike Faist    


Zendaya&#39;s upcoming film Challengers is due to be released in 2024, following the story of a tennis player turned coach, and years later watches as her husband falls into a losing streak. The trailer has already shown queer undertones in Challengers, and a possible love triangle between her character, Tashi, her husband Art (Mike Faist), and her ex-boyfriend Patrick (Josh O&#39;Connor). The high pressure of tennis combined with the pain of the past is sure to provide plenty of anticipation and drama, especially with the success of recent sports-focused media such as the TV series Ted Lasso and boxing films like Rocky and Creed. 
Given Zendaya&#39;s continuous streak of top-quality performances as of late, it&#39;s hopeful that Challengers will be a great watch, and perhaps become one of the best tennis movies of all time. At the moment, there is only a planned cinematic release, due to arrive in theatres on April 26. However, Challengers is a product of Amazon MGM Studios, so there&#39;s a chance it will be available to stream on Prime Video shortly after, much like its recent release Saltburn did.





 1  Wicked: Part One 
In theaters November 27
        

  Wicked  


  Release Date    November 27, 2024     Director    Jon M. Chu     Cast    Cynthia Erivo , Ariana Grande , Jonathan Bailey , Ethan Slater , Marissa Bode , Michelle Yeoh , Jeff Goldblum    


After years of hopefulness and anticipation, 2024 will finally see a film adaptation of the Broadway classic Wicked. Wicked: Part One will come in 2024, and its second part, Wicked: Part Two is due to be released in November 2025. The fictional universe of The Wizard of Oz is a symbol in the LGBTQ&#43; community, with Dorothy actress Judy Garland being one of the biggest queer icons of all time. For a long time, the term &#34;a friend of Dorothy&#34; was used by homosexuals to identify one another in society.
In fact, Garland&#39;s death in 1969 caused such an emotional response within the LGBTQ&#43; community that her funeral led to the events of the Stonewall Riots. The 2024 Wicked adaptation stars several more LGBTQ&#43; icons, including Ariana Grande and Johnathan Bailey, as well as Cynthia Erivo, who plays Elphaba, who identifies as queer and bisexual. While many LGBTQ&#43; films are being released in 2024, Wicked: Part One may have the most representation within its casting.
