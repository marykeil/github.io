 Anna Diop &amp; RJ Cyler Talk The Book of Clarence 
         




Screen Rant: Man, The Book of Clarence is brilliant. It feels so big and epic, but it&#39;s so grounded with its characters and situations, and this movie blew me away. Anna, you play Varinia. Tell us a little bit about her character and the connection that your character has with Clarence.


Anne Diop: Varinia is, for all intents and purposes, Clarence&#39;s love interest in this. She&#39;s a woman who he is in love with and who he wants to win over, but she keeps rejecting him over and over and over again because her mind is telling her he&#39;s not it. He doesn&#39;t have his things together. He doesn&#39;t have his life together. He&#39;s a bit of a mess. He&#39;s best friends with this one, who we love, but they just run around.
RJ Cyler: I&#39;m no good. You ain&#39;t no better, though.
Anna Diop: It&#39;s not that you&#39;re no good. They run around doing nonsense, and so she doesn&#39;t accept him as a partner.


RJ, Elijah is a real character in the Bible, but you do such a great job of grounding this character and breathing new life into him. What did you want to bring to the role of Elijah that wasn&#39;t necessarily on the page?





RJ Cyler: A different view of a relationship with God; a realistic point of it. What he didn&#39;t do was blame Clarence for not believing. He didn&#39;t say, &#34;Oh, well, you need to believe.&#34; He said, &#34;I get it. I understand. Your life is horrible. My life is horrible, but I just got a little bit more faith.&#34;
It&#39;s a realistic standpoint of how most friend groups are. We better each other. A lot of what I lack, my friends have an abundance of. Literally, I wish I could be as communicative as that without sounding like I&#39;m just upset. And my friends are all patient with me, for sure, and I know it comes with, &#34;Okay, RJ, shut up.&#34; &#34;But did you hear me?&#34; &#34;Yeah, we heard you.&#34; &#34;All right, bet.&#34;


Anna, this film on its scale is absolutely epic. Did the costumes in the real location of Matera, Italy add to your performance?


Anna Diop: Yeah, absolutely. As actors, whenever you&#39;re giving as many authentic things, it&#39;s so helpful. We woke up every day in Matera, which is one of the oldest preserved cities in the world, and so it&#39;s cobblestone and the homes and everything are built out of these caves, and it looks like 30 A.D. That&#39;s invaluable. And the costumes, like you said; the set direction. You&#39;re on set. There are camels and just it&#39;s wild. Yeah, you can&#39;t do anything but drop into where you&#39;re around.
RJ Cyler: The foods in the market used to trip me out, because I&#39;m like, &#34;What does that look like cooked? How do you even cook that?&#34; You feel me? Like, wow.
Anna Diop: The detail is crazy with the set design.
RJ Cyler: They went crazy. Our set designers and creators were amazing. And they didn&#39;t cut any corners at all from the props to [the set]. Yeah, they didn&#39;t cut any corners.





James has an extensive music background and, from what I read, he helps give actors direction by giving them playlists to help with their character arcs. Which songs were on your characters&#39; playlists for the shoot?


RJ Cyler: Luckily, I had three tracks that James wanted me to listen to for understanding and bounce, but they mimicked a few of the ones from The Harder They Fall just because of the person that he wanted Elijah to be. He shares a lot of similarities with Jim Beckworth. I&#39;ll let him as the director tell you why that is, because that&#39;s a cool Easter egg too.
Anna Diop: Yeah, that is one of them.
RJ Cyler: Yeah, it&#39;s just like that. They coexist, and so that didn&#39;t really need to stretch too far. James just allowed me to not overthink. You feel me? He saved me from overthinking about the character. He was just like, &#34;Whoa, whoa, whoa, simplify. Keep it cool, big dog.&#34;
Anna Diop: For me, Spartacus. The love theme song from the film was one. It&#39;s so beautiful, and it&#39;s so moving and emotional and romantic. Varinia is this love interest for Clarence, and he also played me some old-school &#39;70s and &#39;80s love tracks. Because that&#39;s what he wanted for Varinia; strong but beautiful and romantic piece for Clarence.







 About The Book of Clarence 
          

From visionary filmmaker Jeymes Samuel, The Book of Clarence is a bold new take on the timeless Hollywood-era Biblical epic. Streetwise but struggling, Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield) is trying to find a better life for himself and his family, make himself worthy to the woman he loves, and prove that heâ€™s not a nobody. Captivated by the power and glory of the rising Messiah and His apostles, he risks everything to carve his own path to a divine life, a journey through which he finds redemption and faith; power and knowledge.

The Book of Clarence arrives exclusively in movie theaters on January 12.
