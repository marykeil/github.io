# Disney s New Alien Movie Cast Is Already Continuing The Franchise s Best Trend


## SUMMARY 


 

Disney&#39;s new Alien movie will feature a young cast of relative unknowns, promising a fresh start for the franchise.


The casting of Cailee Spaeny and Isabela Merced as strong, self-sufficient heroines could fix the problem of relying on Ripley clones, like previous Alien sequels.


Spaeny&#39;s younger age suggests her character will bring a new perspective to the franchise while still honoring its traditions, similar to how Jane Levy&#39;s Mia changed the tone of the Evil Dead series.
