# How A Live-Action Naruto Shippuden Series Can Work - Splitting The Anime Into 7 Movies


## SUMMARY 


 Lionsgate&#39;s live-action Naruto movie will likely start from the beginning of Naruto&#39;s story and could be broken down into approximately four separate films. 
 The central plot of Naruto: Shippuden consists of about 15 individual arcs, but condensing all of them into a few movies will be near impossible. Expect between five and ten movies for Shippuden alone. 
 The final Naruto: Shippuden movie could cover the Kaguya Otsutsuki Strike arc, which is a complex plot that will require its own film, and then end with the peaceful Konoha Hidden arc for a satisfying conclusion.

## Literature Review

The 500 episodes of Naruto: Shippuden will be hard to condense into films, but all the major non-filler arcs could reasonably make a 7-movie series. 




A live-action Naruto movie is in the works, but once the plot gets up to Naruto: Shippuden, covering the story with individual film installments will get far more complicated. It can be assumed that the upcoming Lionsgate movie will start from the beginning of Naruto&#39;s story, and the 220-episode-long anime could be feasibly broken down into approximately four separate Naruto films. However, from there, the original Naruto goes into a time jump, and the subsequent Naruto: Shippuden is a whopping 500 episodes. Condensing all the major plot points into a few movie installments will be near impossible, so we can likely expect between five and ten movies in all for Shippuden alone.
Of course, not all the story arcs of the Naruto: Shippuden anime are central to the plot, and several filler arcs are scattered throughout. It can be assumed that these will not be included in Lionsgate&#39;s upcoming movie franchise—though some key, canon moments could potentially pop up here and there. Still, even without these fillers, the central plot of Naruto: Shippuden is made up of about 15 individual arcs. As exciting as it would be to see each of these get their own live-action film, it&#39;s simply not feasible, and some of these arcs will likely be cut entirely. Still, if Lionsgate wanted to cover the entirety of Naruto: Shippuden&#39;s central story in live-action, it could get it done in about seven movies.
            
 
 Naruto Live Action Movie: Writer &amp; Everything We Know 
A live-action adaptation of the Naruto anime and manga series was announced by Lionsgate but has since gone quiet. What&#39;s happening with the project?












 








 7  The Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission &amp; Itachi Pursuit Mission Arcs Can Combine For A First Shippuden Movie 
        

The Tenchi Bridge Reconnaissance Mission sees the introduction of the all-new Team 7, diving into the Sasuke replacement, Sai, as well as the challenging adjustments faced by Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi. Chronologically, this arc happens after the Kazekage Rescue Mission arc, but since the mission to retrieve Sasuke will be at the forefront of the audience&#39;s minds after the end of the first Naruto movies, the Tenchi Bridge mission would be the best way to start a Naruto: Shippuden film series. It can also be combined with the Itachi Pursuit Mission arc, which would allow audiences to see what Sasuke has been up to since joining Orochimaru and dive right into his ultimate departure to find his brother, likely ending with the Naruto villain&#39;s death at his pupil&#39;s hand.





 6  The Kazekage Rescue Mission &amp; Akatsuki Supression Mission Arcs As The Second Shippuden Movie 
        

The Naruto: Shippuden movie kicks off with the Kazekage Rescue Mission arc, which sees Naruto, Sakura, and Kakashi attempting to rescue Gaara from the Akatsuki. However, since movie audiences are likely to be far more interested in seeing what happens to Sasuke, it may be best for Lionsgate to push this arc off until the second Shippuden movie. Gaara is a fan-favorite character all his own, so diving into this story would reward those who became interested in his story back during the initial Naruto movies. The Akatsuki Suppression Mission doesn&#39;t happen until much later in the anime, but in a movie format, it makes sense to introduce all the Akatsuki at once.





 5  The Tale Of Jiraiya The Gallant &amp; Pain’s Attack Arcs Can Combine For The Third Naruto Shippuden Movie 
        

The Tale of Jiraiya the Gallant is an entire arc meant to set up Pain&#39;s attack on the Hidden Leaf Village, and it&#39;s full of important moments (such as the legendary Shibobi&#39;s death). Still, the Naruto: Shippuden movies won&#39;t have the luxury of time, so this plotline will need to be combined with the Pain&#39;s Attack arc. Since Pain, AKA Nagato is the one who kills Jiraiya, it&#39;s logical that the villain&#39;s full story would be contained within a single film. Additionally, this means that the satisfying moment when Naruto is finally seen as a hero of the Hidden Leaf Village would make for a heartwarming end to a third Shippuden movie.





 4  The Fated Battle Between Brothers &amp; The Five Kage Summit Arcs Can Be the Fourth Naruto Shippuden Movie 
        

The Fated Battle Between Brothers arc chronologically takes place before Pain&#39;s Attack, while the Five Kage Summit arc technically takes place after. However, since both these plotlines have much to do with Sasuke, his goals, and the consequences of his betrayal, it makes sense to lump them together. The bulk of the film could focus on Sasuke&#39;s battle with Itachi and the ultimate revelation that his older brother was never really his enemy. This could be broken up with scenes featuring the Five Kage summit and Naruto&#39;s desperation to earn mercy for Sasuke. Finally, this fourth Shippuden movie would reveal that Tobi is a far greater threat than anyone had anticipated.





 3  The Fourth Shinobi World War Arcs (Countdown, Confrontation &amp; Climax) Can Make Up The Fifth Naruto Shippuden Movie 


 







The Fourth Shinobi World War took up a massive amount of the Naruto: Shippuden anime and consisted of three individual arcs—Fourth Shinobi World War: Countdown, Confrontation, and Climax. A lot happens within this plot, and combining everything into one movie will be tricky. However, with the Ten-Tails Jinchuriki on the way, as well as the Kaguya Otsutsuki Strike arc, it would be difficult to split the war up into more pieces. Therefore, the fifth installment in a Naruto: Shippuden movie could explore the leadup to the war, starting with Sasuke&#39;s determination to seek revenge on the Hidden Leaf Village for his brother&#39;s fate.
From there, the Naruto: Shippuden movie can dive into the actual meat of the war. This would include the formation of the Allied Shinobi Forces, and the reanimation of virtually all the deceased Naruto characters. Finally, this would lead to the Five Kage&#39;s big confrontation with Madara and Tobi, who is, of course, revealed to really be Obito Uchiha.





 2  The Kakashi Gaiden &amp; Birth Of The Ten-Tails&#39; Jinchuriki Arc Can Combine For The Sixth Naruto: Shippuden Movie 
        

If the fifth Naruto: Shippuden movie reveals that Madara and Obito are behind everything, then it will become necessary for the Lionsgate films to finally dive into Kakashi&#39;s past. In the anime, the Kakashi Gaiden arc takes place long before the start of the war, but in film, this may need a far more overt connection to Obito&#39;s story. This installment could serve as something of a partial prequel, detailing Kakashi&#39;s regret at Obito&#39;s death, Madara and White Zetsu&#39;s involvement in the Uchiha boy&#39;s survival, and the series of events that lead to the emergence of the Ten-Tails. Once the timeline catches up with itself, Obito and Madara can officially become the Ten-Tails&#39; Jinchuriki.
If the sixth Naruto: Shippuden movie dives into the fight with the Ten-Tails, it would also serve as the resolution to Naruto and Sasuke&#39;s conflict. This is when Orochimaru&#39;s apprentice finally decides to fight for his friends rather than against them. Of course, there is still a significant arc left to the Naruto anime, which will provide additional explanations for Naruto and Sasuke&#39;s destinies, so one more film—and villain—will be necessary.





 1  The Kaguya Otsutsuki Strike Arc Can Be The Final (Eighth) Naruto: Shippuden Movie 


 







Everything comes together with the Kaguya Otsutsuki arc, which was why it was the perfect final conflict for the Naruto: Shippuden anime (as well as any prospective live-action movies). The plot of this arc, including the backstory and explanation about who Kaguya Otsutsuki is and how she connects to Naruto, Sasuke, and Shinobi as a whole, is pretty complicated and will therefore require a full live-action movie all its own to adapt. Additionally, by making the Kaguya Otsutsuki Strike arc its own film, there will be a bit of room at the end for an epilogue.
The final arc of Naruto: Shippuuden is the Konoha Hidden: The Perfect Day for a Wedding arc, which is only a few episodes long and has no major conflict with any enemies. However, it&#39;s essential in that it wraps up the stories of all the Naruto characters. This is when we see that Naruto truly did become Hokage as he always said he would, and this is only a part of the satisfying resolutions. After the massive conflict with Kaguya, this peaceful ending would be the perfect way to conclude the live-action Naruto: Shippuden movies.
