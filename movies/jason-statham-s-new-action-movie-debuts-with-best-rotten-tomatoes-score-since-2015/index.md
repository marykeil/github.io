## Literature Review

The Rotten Tomatoes score is in for Jason Statham’s latest action movie, The Beekeeper, and it marks the actor’s best score since 2015.




The Beekeeper’s Rotten Tomatoes score has arrived, and it marks Jason Statham’s highest score since 2015. Directed by David Ayer, the actor’s latest action movie sees him playing Adam Clay, a former special ops soldier living a peaceful life as a beekeeper who comes out of retirement to get revenge after somebody close to him is targeted by criminals. Statham is currently one of the most reliable action stars in Hollywood, but many of the actor&#39;s recent films have not been hits with critics.




Now, just ahead of The Beekeeper&#39;s theatrical release, Rotten Tomatoes reveals the film&#39;s score to be 72% with 60 reviews. This marks Statham&#39;s best score since 2015&#39;s Spy, which, at 95%, is actually the highest score of his career. An audience score for The Beekeeper isn&#39;t in yet, but one is sure to be added soon after the film goes wide this weekend. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the critics&#39; score could still fluctuate as more reviews are added. Check out a chart of Statham&#39;s recent Rotten Tomatoes score below:

 Year  Title  Rotten Tomatoes Score   2024  The Beekeeper  72%   2023  Expend4bles  14%   2023  Meg 2: The Trench  27%   2023  Fast X  56%   2023  Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre  51%   2021  Wrath of Man  67%   2019  Hobbs &amp; Shaw  67%   2018  The Meg  47%   2017  The Fate of the Furious  67%   2016  Mechanic: Resurrection  31%   2015  Spy  95%   






  


 The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Score Explained 
          

As evidenced by the score, reviews for The Beekeeper have generally been positive, with critics enjoying Statham&#39;s latest punch-em-up. In contrast to some of his other action-heavy roles, The Beekeeper seems to have struck a mostly effective balance between serious and silly, which is its biggest selling point. The movie, for example, features frequent bee-related puns, jokes, and references even during moments of intense violence.

The main draw for a Statham action movie is, of course, the action. The Beekeeper&#39;s R rating means the film features fight sequences with more blood and bone-crunching hits than the actor&#39;s PG-13 fare, and this has evidently resulted in an entertaining experience. The story may be fairly run-of-the-mill for the action genre, but entertaining action and a film that&#39;s aware of its own ridiculousness is clearly a combination that has garnered some points with critics.




While 72% may be Statham&#39;s best since 2015, it&#39;s still not exactly glowing, however. Many of the generally positive reviews for the film are definitely more of a lukewarm positive. Some critics argue that the story can is predictable and uninspired, and the film&#39;s villain, played by Josh Hutcherson, isn&#39;t elevated above the generic antagonists featured in other movies of the same vein. The Beekeeper may not win any Oscars, but, at the very least, the film&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes score suggests it marks a fun outing for Statham.
