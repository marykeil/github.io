# How Much The Rock Was Paid For 6 Fast &amp; Furious Movies (Including Hobbs &amp; Shaw)


## SUMMARY 



  Fast Five&#39;s success can be attributed to the introduction of Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson&#39;s character, Luke Hobbs, who added a new dynamic to the franchise.   The Rock has earned a reported $65 million from the Fast &amp; Furious movies, not including additional earnings from box office performance.   Johnson&#39;s success as one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood is a result of his marketing prowess, relentless work ethic, and strategic role selection.

## Literature Review

Dwayne Johnson is partly to thank for the success of Fast &amp; Furious since Fast Five, but how many millions was The Rock rewarded with for his effort?




The Rock revitalized the Fast &amp; Furious franchise in 2011 and went on to feature in five more movies in the series, and he&#39;s been rewarded with a fortune as a result. In the late 2000s, the Fast &amp; Furious series had lost steam. Audiences were losing interest in the street-racing backdrop, and the movies were seeing diminishing returns with each consecutive release. That was until 2011&#39;s Fast Five turned the low-stakes series into a high-octane heist movie with huge action set pieces. As a result, the movie made a monumental $629 million worldwide (via The Numbers), which is almost $300 million more than the previous release.




However, switching up the genre and implementing higher stakes wasn&#39;t the only reason Fast Five was so successful. The movie also introduced Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson as Luke Hobbs, a DSS agent tasked with hunting down Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O&#39;Conner (Paul Walker). For years, the franchise had been criticized for being too melodramatic, and Dom and Brian rarely ever dropped their overly serious personas. That&#39;s why Johnson&#39;s smack-talking persona, Hobbs, became an instant hit with audiences. Johnson is partly to thank for the franchise&#39;s success from Fast Five onward, and as a result, Universal has helped Johnson amass tens of millions of dollars.


 The Rock Has Made At Least $65 Million For The Fast &amp; Furious Franchise 
Dwayne Johnson Likely Made More With Backend Points
         

The Rock has reportedly made a total of $65 million for his Fast &amp; Furious movies (via Sportskeeda), and that&#39;s just from the basic salaries, which don&#39;t include anything earned from box office performance. Needless to say, that figure could be a lot more. For Fast Five, Johnson allegedly made $10 million, and that&#39;s reportedly the same figure he earned for Fast &amp; Furious 6. Sources suggest that Furious 7 earned the actor $15 million, which is even more impressive given that Johnson had considerably less screen time than in the previous two movies.




  Fast Five - $10 million   Fast &amp; Furious 6 - $10 million   Furious 7 - $15 million   Fate of the Furious - $10 million (plus backend points)   Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw - $20 million   Fast X - unknown  

It&#39;s rare for an actor to have a lower salary for a franchise movie than the previous film, but that&#39;s seemingly what happened with Fate of the Furious, as Johnson&#39;s salary was reportedly $10 million, $5 million less than his estimated Furious 7 salary. However, in lieu of an extra $5 million, Johnson had backend points negotiated into his contract. Backend points are a percentage of the movie&#39;s gross. It hasn&#39;t been disclosed what percentage Johnson negotiated, but even if it was 1%, the actor could have earned an extra $12.3 million given the movie&#39;s $1.23 billion gross.

Johnson also starred in his own spinoff movie with Jason Statham, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw, which earned him $20 million (via Variety). The actor didn&#39;t return for F9 following his famous Fast &amp; Furious feud with Vin Diesel, which means that the former wrestler likely left another $20 million on the table. However, The Rock did return in Fast X for a post-credits cameo. While he appeared for less than a minute, the performance was likely lucrative for the actor.




It hasn&#39;t been disclosed how much Johnson was paid for the Fast X post-credits cameo, but it&#39;s likely he earned a decent amount of money. While his cameo might be less than a minute long, similar high-profile appearances allegedly came with seven-figure paychecks, including Mark Hamill&#39;s minute-long cameo in Star Wars: The Force Awakens. (via Men&#39;s Health). That, combined with Fast &amp; Furious&#39; notoriously inflated budgets, make $1 million a possible figure for Johnson&#39;s cameo.

                  Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2: Confirmation, Dwayne Johnson&#39;s Fast Saga Plans &amp; Everything We Know   Hobbs &amp; Shaw was a hit spinoff movie from the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but Hobbs &amp; Shaw 2 hasn&#39;t come to fruition. Will the sequel ever get made?   



 How The Rock Became One Of The Highest-Paid Actors In Hollywood 
          

While Johnson tried and failed to become a movie star in the 2000s with a series of flops, in the 2010s, The Rock became one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood. The reason why isn&#39;t so much his approach to acting but his approach to marketing and, ultimately, becoming a brand. Johnson has unrivaled charisma, which stems from his wrestling roots, and he has a relentless work ethic. The actor has an unwavering commitment to every project he&#39;s in, and he&#39;s intensely strategic when it comes to choosing his next role.




Johnson treats marketing a movie like promoting an upcoming wrestling event, and while it didn&#39;t work for Black Adam, it has worked for just about everything else. Despite a series of setbacks like Doom and The Scorpion King, the actor briefly stole Vin Diesel&#39;s thunder when it came to the Fast &amp; Furious franchise. Since then, he has become a more than reliable movie star. Audiences know that any movie starring The Rock might not be a masterpiece, but it&#39;ll still be wildly entertaining.
