# 10 Harsh Realities Of Rewatching The DCEUs 2023 Movies


## SUMMARY 


 Blue Beetle deserved better financial success for its well-done story, cast, and special effects. 
 Knowing the DC Universe reboot was coming dampened excitement for 2023 releases with unresolved set-ups. 
 The Flash had inconsistent CGI, with some impressive scenes but overall disappointing visuals for an A-list superhero.

## Literature Review



With the DCEU officially coming to a close with the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, looking back at the shared universe&#39;s final year makes clear some disappointing truths. It was no surprise when DC announced plans to create an interconnected movie universe, following in the footspeps of Marvel before it. Moreover, while not universally beloved, the DCEU started off strong with Man of Steel, featuring Henry Cavill&#39;s well-liked take on Superman. However, the following years were full of ups and downs, driven by behind-the-scenes changes in direction that resulted in an inconsistent vision and lack of overarching direction.
These problems came to a head with the DCEU&#39;s 2023 movies. It certaily wasn&#39;t all bad - in fact, there are plenty of moments in the DCEU&#39;s final year that stand among the franchise&#39;s best. Hoewever, those moments are tucked away between missed opportunities and confusing creative decisions, resulting in an uneven streak of releases made more disappointing with the knowledge that none of their narrative set-ups will be followed up on after the DC Universe reboots in 2025.

 10  Blue Beetle Is Way Better Than Its Box Office Performance 
Blue Beetle Released Among Critical Disappointments And A Franchise Reboot


Close







Released after The Flash&#39;s historic box office bomb and on the precipice of the DC Universe reboot and featuring a character with little brand-name recognition, Blue Beetle was put in a tough place to find success. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Blue Beetle failed to perform, but it becomes clear on a rewatch that the movie&#39;s poor financial earnings are largely undeserved. Blue Beetle is one of the better films in the DCEU, delivering a simple story elevated by a great cast and well-done special effects. Fortunately, James Gunn has confirmed that Xolo Maridue√±a will return as the character in the new DCU.





 9  Announcing A Franchise Reboot So Early Made It Hard To Get Excited About DCEU Releases 
Know No Set-Ups Would Be Paid Off Ahead Of Time Hurt


Close







It&#39;s completely understandable why the DC Universe reboot was announced back in 2022. As projects have been confirmed and talent signs on, DC has rightfully wanted to drum up excitement for a new franchise and creative vision. That being said, there&#39;s no doubt that it&#39;s stolen some of the thunder from DC&#39;s 2023 releases. While more self-contained stories like Blue Beetle are affected less, an uncertain future makes it hard to completely buy into movies with set-ups pre-determined to not be paid off. Repeat viewings don&#39;t make this any better, instead highlighting future stories that will never come to pass.





 8  The Flash&#39;s CGI Really Is As Bad As It First Seemed 
The Good CGI Is Great, But The Lows Are Quite Low


Close







The Flash&#39;s CGI was the subject of severe criticism on release, but it only looks worse on repeat viewings. There&#39;s no doubt that some scenes, like the majority of the final fight vs Zod&#39;s forces, look good, but sequences like the Chronobowl visions and hospital rescue are oddly underbaked. Confusingly, The Flash director Andy Muschietti has gone on record saying the visuals were an intentional creative choice. Whether the movie looks like it does on purpose or not, there&#39;s no denying that an A-list superhero like The Flash deserved better visuals for his first solo movie outing.





 7  Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Ends The DCEU Without Closure 
Though It&#39;s Not The Movie&#39;s Fault
        

It&#39;s not Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s fault that it ends the DCEU with surprisingly little fanfare. The movie was written well before plans for the DCU reboot came to light, and it was never designed to close a shared universe. That being said, from the viewer&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s still a bit of a letdown that the huge cinematic universe ends with no closure whatsoever. In a perfect world, The Flash could have been released after the Aquaman sequel and been a true multiverse finale, but that&#39;s simply not how things came to pass.





 6  Henry Cavill&#39;s Final Superman Appearance Is A Terrible CGI Cameo 
Cavill Only Appears In The Flash&#39;s Chronobowl
        

Henry was widely regarded as excellent in the role of Clark Kent/Superman, but his on-screen journey in the DCEU is frustratingly incomplete. After announcing Cavill was back following his Black Adam cameo and reversing course weeks later, Cavil&#39;s tenure officially ends with a bizarrely bad CGI appearance in The Flash&#39;s Chronobowl. The figure is very poorly done with CGI, which The Flash director XXXX says is intentional, but it&#39;s sad that such a beloved version of the character has such a disappointing and intangible final showing.





 5  Shazam! Fury Of The Gods JLA Tease Isn&#39;t Going Anywhere 
Though The Team&#39;s Recruiters Will Likely Be Back
        

Shazam! Fury of the Gods ends with a post-credits scene that establishes the titular hero as a new member of the Justice Society of America. On first watch, this was an exciting set-up as the super-team was a positively received part of 2022&#39;s Black Adam. Now, with a better picture of what the DCU reboot really is, the odds of that plotline being followed through on seems incredibly slim. Like much of the late DCEU, the Shazam! Fury of the Gods end scene seems destined to be an empty promise.





 4  Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman Tenure Was Cut Awkwardly Short 
He Almost Had An Appearance In Aquaman 2
        

Ben Affleck delivered continuously great performances as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and it&#39;s easy to see how he could have anchored a successful shared universe franchise had he been given a real opportunity to do so. Unfortunately, Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman solo movie never happened, and the character&#39;s time in the DCEU ends early in The Flash. After playing a notable role early in the movie, Affleck&#39;s Batman is never seen again after Barry travels back in time, leaving his tenure as Wayne to fizzle out and end with a whimper instead of the exclamation point it deserved.





 3  The Flash Wasted The Perfect Justification For The DCU Reboot 
The Flash Creates A New Timeline That Isn&#39;t The New DCU
        

As the number of actors who have played Spider-Man and Batman can attest, superhero movie reboots aren&#39;t rare. What is rare is having the perfect opportunity to justify the do-over in-universe. The Flash is loosely based on DC&#39;s Flashpoint event, which similarly sees Barry Allen go back in time to save his mom. After learning that changing the past leads to too dire of consequences, Barry tries to undo what he&#39;s changed, but the result is a reboot of the entire DC Comics universe.
The DCEU to DCU reboot was perfectly aligned to use The Flash to explain the change to the shared movie universe, but it simply didn&#39;t. Instead, The Flash&#39;s ending does indeed seem to create a new timeline, but it&#39;s decidedly not the new DCU. It&#39;s not shocking, considering The Flash was written before Gunn and Safran were announced as leads to start a new creative vision for DC, but rewatching The Flash still feels like a big missed opportunity.





 2  Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman Suit Went From Excellent To Embarrassing 
Affleck&#39;s Suit In The Flash Looks Markedly Worse Than Batman V Superman


Close







Despite Batman v Superman being one of the more disappointing DCEU movies, there&#39;s no doubt that Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman looks absolutely stellar. His suits - both the standard Batman outfit and the armored get-up to fight Superman - pay homage to different looks from the comics while standing distinctly apart from anything that&#39;s appeared in live-action to date. The cowl, in particular, fit Affleck&#39;s head wonderfully and offered natural and unrestricted movement.
However, things went downhill with each subsequent version, culminating in a Batman suit in The Flash that looks like it was molded to fit someone else. The body sports a divisive waffle pattern, but it&#39;s the awkward cowl that&#39;s a far cry from where the character began years earlier. Most disappointing is that the downgrade is because the designers of the first cowl, Ironhead Studios, were uncredited in the movie, leading them to not return for subsequent DCEU projects.





 1  Shazam! Fury Of The Gods Is Full Of Missed Opportunities 
The Movie Misses Out On Its Predacessor&#39;s Charm
        

Shazam! Fury of the Gods doesn&#39;t do anything actively bad, but it&#39;s hard to deny on repeat viewings that the movie is simply unexciting. The trio of villains, the Daughters of Atlas, are dull and fail to present a memorable central conflict, and the Shazam family isn&#39;t really given anything to do. The movie feels overly safe, which is a shame, given the first movie felt like a fun breath of fresh air. Like much of the DCEU, Shazam! Fury of the Gods ends up being some good ideas that never quite come togeher.
