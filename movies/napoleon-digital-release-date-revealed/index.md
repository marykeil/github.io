## Literature Review

The digital release date has been revealed for Ridley Scott&#39;s historical action epic Napoleon, starring Joaquin Phoenix as the French emperor.




The Napoleon digital release date has officially been revealed. Directed by Ridley Scott and starring Joaquin Phoenix, the historical action epic follows the titular French leader&#39;s ruthless rise to power with a focus on his addictive and often volatile relationship with Empress Joséphine (Vanessa Kirby). In addition to Phoenix and Kirby in the two lead roles, the Napoleon cast also includes Tahar Rahim, Ben Miles, Ludivine Sagnier, Matthew Needham, Catherine Walker, and Anna Mawn.




Now, nearly two months after debuting in theaters, the Napoleon digital release date has officially been revealed. Apple Original Films, in partnership with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, has announced that Napoleon will be available to rent or own on digital starting on January 9. This release on premium video-on-demand predates the movie&#39;s streaming release on Apple TV&#43;, a date for which has yet to be announced.

                  Napoleon Ending Explained   Ridley Scott&#39;s Napoleon highlights the titular subject&#39;s life. From military campaigns to personal tidbits, we break down the biopic&#39;s ending.   


 How Did Napoleon Perform In Theaters? 
          

With it releasing on digital in one day, the Napoleon box office run can officially be declared over. Ridley Scott and Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s historical epic opened in theaters on November 22 over the Thanksgiving weekend and made $20.4 million, finishing second behind the holdover, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes. However, with the Napoleon reviews being mostly positive, (praising its performances and action scenes, but criticizing its comedic tone, long runtime, and historical inaccuracies) the movie had decent legs at the box office, ending its run with $213 million worldwide.




Under strictly a traditional theatrical release, Napoleon needed to make $500–600 million worldwide in order to break even, considering its $130–200 million budget. However, as an Apple original film, its success is not solely measured by its box office performance, but also by how many subscribers are driven to the streaming service. While Napoleon awaits its release on Apple TV&#43;, its on-demand purchases and rentals will give it a second chance to salvage its so-so performance at the box office.
