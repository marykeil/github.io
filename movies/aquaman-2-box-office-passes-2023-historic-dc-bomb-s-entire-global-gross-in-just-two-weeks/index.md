Summary

  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom defies expectations by surpassing The Flash&#39;s total earnings at the box office in less than two weeks.   The Aquaman sequel has already made over $274 million by its fourteenth day in theaters, whereas The Flash&#39;s total earnings in 40 days were $266.5 million.   Despite DC&#39;s recent commercial failures, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom could potentially break even or make a profit.  





Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom achieves an unexpected box office feat, leaving DC movies like The Flash far behind. The DCEU experienced a downward trend in 2023 with three consecutive movies that struggled at the box office. But after Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle&#39;s commercial failure imposed a bad omen for the DCEU&#39;s final movie, James Wan&#39;s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has managed to break free of previously low expectations.




As reported by The Numbers, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has surpassed The Flash&#39;s total earnings in less than two weeks. On its fourteenth day in theaters, the Aquaman sequel has amassed over $274 million, whereas The Flash&#39;s 40-day theatrical run earned the Ezra Miller-led movie $266.5 million in total, according to The Numbers. Considering that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom cost around $215 million, James Wan&#39;s DC film might be on track to break even, or even make a profit despite the DCEU&#39;s recent track record.

  1:50                       Aquaman&#39;s Inevitable DCU Future Isn&#39;t So Grim After The Lost Kingdom&#39;s Box Office   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s box office performance is better than expected, which suggests that the DCU won&#39;t overlook the King of Atlantis.   


 Why Aquaman 2&#39;s Box Office Is Better Than The Flash&#39;s 
          




In theory, The Flash had all the makings of a resounding box office success: The Flash features several multiversal cameos by previous DC actors, deals with the multiverse, includes Supergirl in a supporting role, features two beloved Batman actors reprising their roles as the Dark Knight, and it&#39;s the big-screen solo debut of a famous Justice League founding member. However, these aspects may have achieved the opposite, as they resulted in a disjointed movie that didn&#39;t do any character justice. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom avoids this problem by focusing entirely on Aquaman and Atlantis, which makes it more welcoming to general audiences who aren&#39;t familiar with previous DC projects.

Besides Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s straightforward story, the Aquaman sequel&#39;s VFX and production design are much cleaner than The Flash&#39;s, its action sequences actually move the plot forward, and the characters have clear motivations and character arc. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending also provides a more logical conclusion to the story than The Flash&#39;s. Even the post-credits scenes show a drastic contrast, with The Flash&#39;s post-credits George Clooney cameo coming off as an unintentional set-up and a bizarre nod to an unpopular DC movie and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s post-credits scene simply ending the movie on a lighthearted note.




Aquaman&#39;s box office background also helps Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Unlike The Flash, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom benefits from Aquaman&#39;s 2018 commercial success, which took it to the top of DC&#39;s all-time highest-grossing movies. Just the promise of another trip to James Wan&#39;s Atlantis, combined with the positive reception of the first movie&#39;s visuals and comic accurate suits — not to mention Jason Momoa&#39;s pull — almost assured a much better performance at the box office than other recent DC movies. While Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom couldn&#39;t avoid similar behind-the-scenes controversies to The Flash, it had many positive factors playing in its favor.
