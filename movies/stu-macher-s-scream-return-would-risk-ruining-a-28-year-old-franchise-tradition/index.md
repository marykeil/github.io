# Stu Macher s Scream Return Would Risk Ruining A 28-Year-Old Franchise Tradition


## SUMMARY 



  Bringing back Stu Macher would break the tradition of killing the Ghostface killers in every Scream movie, which is a key element of the franchise&#39;s formula for success.   Stu&#39;s return would be disappointing because it would deviate from the sense of justice that comes from seeing the villains meet their fates in each Scream film.   It wouldn&#39;t make sense for Stu to survive after being squashed by a TV in the original Scream, and the other characters would likely be aware of his survival.

## Literature Review

There’s been speculation about whether the Scream franchise could ever bring back Stu Macher, but doing so would break a long-standing tradition.




There&#39;s been discussion of whether the Scream franchise could ever bring back Stu Macher, but doing so would risk ruining a 28-year-old tradition for the horror series. Played by Matthew Lillard, Stu Macher was one of the two killers behind the original Ghostface murders. He worked alongside Billy Loomis to wreak havoc on Sidney Prescott&#39;s life. He also sought revenge against those who&#39;d wronged him, including Casey Becker and Steve Orth in Scream&#39;s iconic opening scene.




Lillard is an entertaining screen presence, and his character left an impression in the original Scream movie. For this reason, it&#39;s no surprise viewers have questioned whether Stu could make a comeback in a future sequel — a possibility Lillard has addressed with caution and doubt. To be fair, Stu&#39;s fate did appear to be final. And if the Scream franchise were to undo the character&#39;s demise, it would also forego one of its best traditions.

 Stu Macher&#39;s Scream Return Would Undo The Franchise Tradition Of Killing Ghostface 
          

Scream is a franchise that breaks many slasher movie rules, but it does feature conventions of its own — and one of the series&#39; biggest traditions is killing the Ghostface killers at the end of every installment. While Scream has broken its two-killer rule in Scream 3 and Scream VI, each film has always concluded with the heroes prevailing over Ghostface. None of the villains ever make it past one movie, with all getting their comeuppance after their massacre is over. Although some return in other forms, like Billy Loomis haunting his daughter in Scream VI and Richie&#39;s family seeking vengeance for his fate, none survive their movie.




This would make Stu an anomaly if he returned, as he&#39;d be the only Ghostface killer to ever survive beyond a single film. This would be a disappointing break from tradition for the sheer fact that the Ghostface killers deserve their fates, giving the climax of each Scream a sense of justice. However, Stu&#39;s return would also be a letdown for another reason: after the end of 1996&#39;s Scream, it wouldn&#39;t make any sense.



The original Scream is available to stream on Prime Video and Paramount&#43;.






 Stu Macher&#39;s Survival Wouldn&#39;t Make Sense After The Original Scream 
          

Bringing Stu back for a Scream sequel would raise eyebrows for reasons beyond defying the franchise&#39;s long-standing traditions. Stu&#39;s survival would be difficult to justify, as a large television crushes his head in the 1996 film. This is a pretty definitive way to go, and any Scream sequel revisiting the character would need to jump through hoops to get around it. Additionally, Sidney and the other characters from Woodsboro would likely know if Stu somehow survived this fate. Needless to say, it&#39;s best the franchise doesn&#39;t revive Lillard&#39;s character — even if Scream fans want it to.
