## Literature Review

From the mind of Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games franchise is still as prominent as ever, providing some of the most interesting characters in film.




The Hunger Games characters are still as popular as ever, even nearly nine years after the franchise came to an end with Mockingjay: Part Two. A new generation of audiences was introduced to the series after the release of its prequel, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes, in 2023, which delved further into the timeline of Panem&#39;s Hunger Games. The Hunger Games series comes from the mind of Suzanne Collins, with each installment sharing the same name as the novel it&#39;s based on: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, Mockingjay, and The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes.
While there have been plenty of interesting and well-written characters in thefranchise, it&#39;s worth noting that there are differences between The Hunger Games books and films. Of course, with only limited screen time, some details have to be missed and certain characters not fleshed out as well. Despite this, the movie characters have their own ranking, and some of The Hunger Games characters were simply better overall than others.









 








 10  Gale Hawthorne 
Gale Tried To Make His Personal Feelings A Priority
        

While Gale (Liam Hemsworth) was an essential part of The Hunger Games love triangle, his character&#39;s purpose outside of this felt a little antagonistic. Of course, Katniss ended up with Peeta, not Gale, which clearly impacted the young man, but his response to such made him almost unbearable. His focus on trying to keep Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) safe was a great allyship for her, but it was very much on his terms. For example, when he asks Katniss to run away and hide from the Capitol at the beginning of Catching Fire. â€‹
Although it was logical and for the sake of safety, he wasn&#39;t really thinking about the bigger picture and how a Games winner disappearing from society could cause even bigger repercussions. One of Gale&#39;s worst qualities was that he was prone to jealousy and had a bit of a hero complex, so when he got involved in the rebellion in Mockingjay: Part Two, he became blinded by the idea that he needed to be Katniss&#39; savior. Unfortunately for him, that did mean that Gale could be blamed for Prim&#39;s death.





 9  Primrose Everdeen 
An Important Character Who Wasn&#39;t Seen Enough
        

Katniss&#39; sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), was a core element of The Hunger Games series, and without her, the story would have been very different. Despite this, she was unfortunately not used enough in the films and barely appears on-screen in Catching Fire. Of course, Prim&#39;s love for her sister is what drives Katniss&#39; motivation throughout, but other than being a supportive but scared sibling, she has very little characterization. Even though she is supposed to be one of the central characters, she feels more like a supporting character in The Hunger Games, and so her death in Mockingjay: Part Two wasn&#39;t as impactful as in the book.





 8  President Snow 
The Capitol Leader Lacked Complexity At Times
        

The Hunger Games&#39; main antagonist, President Snow (Donald Sutherland), posed many a threat throughout the franchise. At first, the man seems supportive and likable but quickly shows his evil side. However, the problem with his character is that he feels rather one-dimensional, seemingly bored with his power and using his Games for his own personal entertainment.
Of course, that is the idea behind The Hunger Games, but Snow still could have had more character development in general, rather than being just a flat-out villain. Luckily, this is addressed in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. President Snow&#39;s changes in The Hunger Games prequel allow audiences to see him in a different light, a more rounded person in general, although still evil.





 7  Effie Trinket 
Effie&#39;s Character Development Took Too Long To Happen
        

Effie (Elizabeth Banks) had one of the most interesting examples of character development in The Hunger Games, but her downfall was that it simply took too long to happen. When she is first introduced the main focus is the way she speaks, the bright colors from her clothes and wigs, and how she treats the Games like a big, fun fashion show, more than a terrible and sociopathic disaster.
Her constantly telling Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) that their opportunity to partake is a &#34;blessing&#34; shows just how out of touch Effie is, but by the end of the franchise, she has finally addressed and accepted just how messed up the Capitol actually is. For quite a while, Effie truly is the definition of &#34;burying your head in the sand,&#34; which makes her difficult to connect with. In the end, Effie does become quite the ally, and while it was great that her change of heart had a realistic pacing, it&#39;s possible that it still didn&#39;t happen quickly enough.





 6  Cinna 
The Tribute Stylist Had Tricks Up His Sleeve
        

Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) was another one of Katniss&#39; greatest allies, using his power as a stylist in a rather interesting way. He could have easily fallen into the same delusion that many others in the Capitol had, but instead, Cinna used his seemingly small role in designing how the tributes would look to make a statement. Cinna was responsible for one of the best moments in The Hunger Games and didn&#39;t hesitate to be upfront and honest with Katniss and Peeta while still being supportive, which made his death in Catching Fire even more heartbreaking, and is easily one of the saddest deaths in The Hunger Games altogether.





 5  Rue 
The Child Who Started It All
        

Rue (Amandla Stenberg) was another essential character who helped push the plot of the series forward, with her brutal death in The Hunger Games being the moment that sparked Panem&#39;s eventual rebellion. Her comparison to Prim led Katniss to develop a bond with the young girl, with Rue&#39;s sweet and soft demeanor being a beacon of hope in the darkened world they find themselves in. She was also rather clever, using her smarts to distract the Careers, and she was also very observant, something the other tributes lacked. Despite having limited time in the film franchise, Rue is still one of the best characters in The Hunger Games.





 4  Finnick Odair 
The Icon Of District 4


 







Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) was one of The Hunger Games&#39; most dangerous tributes. Despite his physical abilities, he was also charming and intelligent, making him a brilliant ally. Although his initial introduction made him appear to be untrustworthy, Finnick quickly turned this around when he saved Peeta during the Quarter Quell.
Finnick was overall a good person, but he knew exactly how to manipulate the Games to his advantage. Overall, Finnick was able to see the bigger picture, fighting back against the Capitol for the sake of what was right, as well as his love, Annie (Stef Dawson). The Hunger Games killed Finnick off in Mockingjay: Part Two, and while it made sense thematically, it was still an awful ordeal.





 3  Peeta Mellark 
Peeta&#39;s Smarts Were Underrated
        

Katniss&#39; true love, Peeta, ended up being one of the franchise&#39;s most complex characters. In the first film, he seemed to be just a simple baker&#39;s son, but he quickly showed that he was more layered than he appeared. Even though he wasn&#39;t particularly close with Katniss, he wanted to die to let her win the 74th Games, sacrificing himself. He was also clever, thinking on his feet and coming up with the lie that Katniss was pregnant to shake the Capitol and Gamemakers in Catching Fire. One thing the character did lack, however, was the ability to stop himself from being captured quite often.





 2  Katniss Everdeen 
The Girl On Fire Who Led A Rebellion


 







The main hero of the story, Katniss truly went through a ridiculous ordeal across four films. While Peeta&#39;s approach to the Capitol&#39;s ways was more subtle, Katniss faced the likes of Snow head-on and didn&#39;t hesitate to speak out against the mistreatment of Panem as a whole, even if it did land her in trouble a lot. Katniss was brilliant as a lead, even if she sometimes doubted her own capabilities, but she wasn&#39;t perfect, which is why she&#39;s such a strong character. Katniss&#39; courage was unmatched by anyone else in the franchise, and although her impulsivity was a positive for her, it did also cause damage.





 1  Haymitch Abernathy 
The Tribute Turned Mentor Was The Hunger Games&#39; Best Character


 







While each of The Hunger Games characters have their strengths, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) ranks as the best. His backstory was obviously complicated, having been a previous victor, but this made him more interesting. Despite being an unlikeable character at points, especially with his drunken antics, this was done with good reason, and even Katniss could recognize this. He often appeared to be indifferent to the events around him, but deep down he really cared. His behavior, while stand-offish, resulted in Katniss and Peeta&#39;s lives being saved on more than one occasion. Haymitch also knew when it was time to buck his ideas up and help, but was careful and precise in what he did, making him The Hunger Games&#39; smartest character.
