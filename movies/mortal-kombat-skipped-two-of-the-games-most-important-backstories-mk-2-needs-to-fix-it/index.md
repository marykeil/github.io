# Mortal Kombat Skipped Two Of The Games Most Important Backstories (&amp; MK 2 Needs To Fix It)


## SUMMARY 



  Mortal Kombat (2021) failed to properly depict the origin stories of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, prioritizing the backstory of Cole.   The movie excluded important context for Scorpion and Sub-Zero in favor of developing the arcana mechanic.   The possible inclusion of the Netherrealm in Mortal Kombat 2 is crucial to improving the depiction of Scorpion and Sub-Zero and properly exploring their origins.

## Literature Review

2021&#39;s Mortal Kombat improved many things that previous movies failed at. However, it still missed the mark with important things that MK 2 can fix.




Mortal Kombat (2021) failed the origin stories of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero, and it is now up to Mortal Kombat 2 to fix it. One of the most popular video games of all time, Mortal Kombat is renowned worldwide for its graphic depictions of violence, unique aesthetic, and iconic characters who continue to influence the gaming industry decades after its original release. Most live-action video game adaptations have failed to capture the essence of what makes their respective source material great, and while the most recent theatrical Mortal Kombat movie was more game-accurate than the one from 1995, it had problems.




Mortal Kombat has seen plenty of adaptations and, despite the inconsistent reception, the thing that many of them have in common is their faithful adaptations of the fighters and their origin stories. With 2021&#39;s Mortal Kombat, the movie enjoyed praise for maintaining the brand&#39;s signature depictions of violence, but it also failed to properly depict many of its iconic names or their origin stories. Moreover, the movie&#39;s insistence on putting the spotlight on the uninteresting Cole Young and the movie&#39;s arcana mechanic meant less time was available for the legacy characters. With Mortal Kombat 2 in development, there&#39;s hope the sequel will address two of its most important backstories.


 Mortal Kombat (2021) Skipped Most Of Scorpion &amp; Sub-Zero’s Stories 
Cole&#39;s backstory was prioritized over the franchise&#39;s most famous characters
          

Despite being the franchise&#39;s most famous characters, most of the context necessary to properly flesh out Scorpion and Sub-Zero was excluded in favor of developing Cole and Mortal Kombat&#39;s arcana mechanic. While new Mortal Kombat characters are necessary to get casual audiences on board with the events depicted in a long-running franchise, the legacy warriors still need to be treated with a level of respect that doesn&#39;t isolate dedicated viewers. Mortal Kombat excels in depicting the legendary rivalry between Scorpion&#39;s Shirai Ryu clan and Sub-Zero&#39;s Lin Kuei clan, but the movie fails to show the resulting aftermath of their deadly duel on account of developing Cole&#39;s character.




Instead, audiences see Sub-Zero conclude their battle by killing Scorpion during feudal era Japan in the movie&#39;s cold opening before skipping ahead to 2021 and Cole&#39;s MMA career. Live-action adaptations of source material often take liberties with the events to justify the adaptation&#39;s existence, but Scorpion and Sub-Zero sadly feel like afterthoughts in what should essentially be their story. However, with the continuous updates for Mortal Kombat 2 strongly suggesting that the filmmakers behind Mortal Kombat are going to redeem their depictions of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, their onscreen depictions in the sequel look like they&#39;re off to a good start already.



 How Mortal Kombat 2 Can Improve Scorpion &amp; Sub-Zero (Even Though They’re Both Dead) 
The Netherrealm&#39;s inclusion is crucial to improving Scorpion and Sub-Zero
          

Set photos for Mortal Kombat 2 imply that the Netherrealm is going to appear in Mortal Kombat 2, and this is great because it&#39;s one of the most famous locations in the source material that are tied to Scorpion and Sub-Zero&#39;s characters far beyond what&#39;s seen in the first movie. After Scorpion and Sub-Zero perish in the source material, their souls are sent to the Netherrealm, where the original Sub-Zero is reincarnated into Noob Saibot. It&#39;s also where Quan Chi turns Scorpion into the iconic hellspawn he&#39;s known as today, a story that wasn&#39;t properly shown in Mortal Kombat (2021). Assuming both Scorpion and Noob Saibot will be in the sequel, Mortal Kombat 2 needs to properly explore their origins.
