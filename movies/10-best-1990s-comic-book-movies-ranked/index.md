## Literature Review

Comic book movies were much less common in the &#39;90s, but there were still some great ones - we rundown the 10 best 1990s comic book movies.




There are many fantastic comic book movies from the 1990s. Comic book movies have famously become one of Hollywood&#39;s most popular and lucrative genres in the 21st century, with both the MCU and the DCEU bringing the titans of DC and Marvel Comics to life like never before in interconnected cinematic universes, and even cinematic multiverses of generational crossovers like Spider-Man: No Way Home and The Flash. While comic book movies have really caught on in the 21st century, they&#39;ve also achieved success in previous eras.
The 1990s is hardly remembered as a golden age for the superhero genre, with many of the comic book films of the decade achieving little box office success or positive general reception. However, there are still numerous comic book movie highlights from the &#39;90s, with some even standing as among the best comic book movies decades later.

 10  Batman Returns Is A Dark Superhero Christmas Tale 
Tim Burton Takes The Gloves Off On His Version Of The Dark Knight


 







  Batman Returns  


  Release Date    June 19, 1992     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Danny DeVito , Michelle Pfeiffer , Christopher Walken , Michael Gough , Michael Murphy    


Tim Burton&#39;s Batman Returns inspired widespread controversy due to its extremely dark tone, but it has aged well as a Burton-style gothic Christmas tale. In Batman Returns, Michael Keaton&#39;s Dark Knight battles the Penguin (Danny DeVito) and corrupt businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) while finding an unexpected love in the mysterious Catwoman (Selina Kyle). Batman Returns is far more the story of Danny DeVito&#39;s Penguin than it is Batman&#39;s, and it plays best when viewed as a Tim Burton movie first and a Batman movie second. Even still, Burton&#39;s dark and moody sensibilities as a filmmaker make Batman Returns a &#39;90s superhero movie stand-out and a one-of-a-kind DC film.





 9  Batman Forever Takes The Dark Knight Into Lighter &amp; Deeper Territory 
Bruce Wayne&#39;s Character Arc &amp; Jim Carrey&#39;s Riddler Performance Give Batman Forever Life
        

  Batman Forever  


  Release Date    June 16, 1995     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Tommy Lee Jones , Drew Barrymore , Chris O&#39;Donnell , Val Kilmer , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough , Debi Mazar    


Following the backlash to Batman Returns&#39;s dark tone, Joel Schumacher took the Caped Crusader into more colorful, family-friendly territory in 1995&#39;s Batman Forever, with Batman (Val Kilmer) facing the dual threat of the Riddler (Jim Carrey) and Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones). Jim Carrey&#39;s manic performance as the Riddler is an animated treat, while Batman Forever is also the first Batman movie to truly focus on the psychology of Bruce Wayne as he struggles with the guilt of his parent&#39;s murder and tries to guide the vengeful Dick Grayson (Chris O&#39;Donnell) from allowing his darkness to consume.
The release of Joel Schumacher&#39;s original cut of Batman Forever has gained considerable mainstream interest in recent years, especially after the 2021 release of Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, with the hashtag #ReleaseTheSchumacherCut appearing on social media and filmmaker Kevin Smith even reportedly screening the movie in 2023. 






 8  Mystery Men Spoofs Superheroes With Laughs &amp; Zeal 
Mystery Men Got In On The Comic Book Movie Game Very Early
        

Based on the Flaming Carrot comic book series, Mystery Men follows a ragtag group of wannabe superheroes with makeshift powers on their mission to rescue Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) and save Champion City from the wrath of Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush). Mystery Men is the epitome of a movie hitting theaters too early, with the slapstick comic book comedy bombing during its 1999 debut long before the superhero genre had become ripe for parody. Time, nonetheless, has been kind to Mystery Men as a loving send-up of superhero movies, with everyone from Ben Stiller&#39;s irritable Mr. Furious to Hank Azria&#39;s cutlery-tossing Blue Raja getting their moments to shine.





 7  The Phantom Is Pure Superhero Pulp Adventure 
Billy Zane Makes An Endearing Ghost Who Walks
        

Another &#39;90s superhero bomb that has stood the test of time, The Phantom adapts Lee Falk&#39;s &#39;30s comic book strip with Billy Zane portraying Kit Walker, the latest man to assume the mantle of The Ghost Who Walks and finding himself in a race to stop Xander Drax (Treat Williams) from seizing the Skulls of Touganda. The Phantom captures the feel of pulpy adventure well, and with his ever-sardonic screen presence, Zane brings plenty of quippy fun to his portrayal of Kit. The Phantom might not have spawned the superhero adventure franchise Paramount Pictures was hoping for, but it&#39;s still a treasure hunt well worth embarking upon.





 6  Dick Tracy Is An Enthralling Crime Drama 
Warren Beatty&#39;s Direction &amp; The Movie&#39;s Visual Style Make Dick Tracy A Unique Comic Book Movie
        

1990&#39;s Dick Tracy brings an explosion of comic book primary colors to the big-screen in its tale of the titular Dick Tracy (Warren Beatty, who also directed the film) in his war against the criminal underworld led by Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino). Dick Tracy introduces its comic book world with an almost casual attitude, not even bothering with origin stories for bizarre villains like Flattop (William Forsythe) and Pruneface (R.G. Armstrong). Aside from its unique visual style even by comic book movie standards, Dick Tracy remains a joy for Pacino&#39;s hammy performance as Big Boy, truly one of the most perfectly cast comic book movie villains of all time.





 5  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Brings All The Fun Of The Turtles To Life 
The Turtle&#39;s First Movie Still Packs Plenty Of Turtle Power
        

It&#39;s easy to forget that the Heroes in a Halfshell began in comics long before their popular (and much more light-hearted) animated series, but a prospective viewer doesn&#39;t need to have seen either to thoroughly enjoy 1990&#39;s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. While there is plenty of ninja action with Raph, Donny, Mikey, and Leo battling Shredder and the Foot Clan, the quartet&#39;s banter among each other and their human allies April O&#39;Neal (Judith Hoag) and Casey Jones (Elias Coteas) brings plenty of energy to the movie all on its own. Decades after its debut, the Turtles&#39;s big-screen debut remains - in the words of the Turtles themselves - awesome.

 4  Batman: Mask of the Phantasm Captures The Essence Of The Dark Knight 
Batman: The Animated Series Delves Into Bruce Wayne&#39;s Past With Its Big-Screen Spin-Off
        

  Batman: Mask of the Phantasm  


  Release Date    December 25, 1993     Director    eric radomski , Bruce W. Timm     Cast    Kevin Conroy , Dana Delany , Hart Bochner , Stacy Keach , Abe Vigoda , Dick Miller    


Conceived as a big-screen spin-off of Batman: The Animated Series, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm endured a tragic demise in theaters only to rebound on home video with all the vigor of The Nightmare Before Christmas. Kevin Conroy returns to voice Bruce Wayne/Batman as he faces a new threat in the form of the mysterious Phantasm, right as he also reconnects with his old love Andrea Beaumont (Dana Delany). Even without its connections to its televised predecessor, Mask of the Phantasm is a gripping Bruce Wayne character study as Bruce struggles with the weight of being Batman.
Batman: The Animated Series later release another spin-off movie, 1997&#39;s Batman: Sub-Zero, though it debuted straight-to-video. 






 3  The Rocketeer Is A Blast Of Historical Fun 
Disney&#39;s First Superhero Movie Has Aged Very Well


 







Set in Los Angeles in 1938, The Rocketeer follows pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) as he discovers a rocket pack stashed in his hangar and becomes the airborne hero known as the Rocketeer, with Cliff finding himself battling Nazis hoping to use the rocket to conquer the world. Joe Johnston&#39;s direction and the across-the-board perfection of The Rocketeer&#39;s cast of real people and fictional characters alike make it a joy of both superhero and World War II movies. The Rocketeer&#39;s legacy even helped shape the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Johnston boarding as director of the World War II-set Captain America: The First Avenger because of his work on The Rocketeer.

 2  The Crow Tells A Moving Tale Of Vengeance &amp; Love 
Brandon Lee&#39;s Portrayal Of Eric Draven Is Posthumously Powerful


 







  The Crow  


  Release Date    May 13, 1994     Director    Alex Proyas     Cast    Brandon Lee , Ernie Hudson , Michael Wincott , Rochelle Davis , Bai Ling , Sofia Shinas , Anna Levine , David Patrick Kelly    


It is tragic that a movie as focused upon the preciousness of life as The Crow should also be forever linked to the untimely on-set demise of Brandon Lee, and the loss of such a promising rising star only makes the movie&#39;s message that much more potent. The Crow&#39;s plot is set one year after rock musician Eric Dravan (Lee) and his fiancé were murdered, and focuses around Dravan returning from the grave to seek vengeance. Director Alex Proyas shoots The Crow like a music video, and Lee&#39;s moving portrayal of Eric Draven adds pathos and poignancy to an already gripping plot. On multiple levels, The Crow is arguably the most moving &#39;90s superhero movie.





 1  Blade Finally Gave Marvel A Big-Screen Hit 
The Daywalker Set A New Standard For Superhero Action
        

The first big-screen success for Marvel surprisingly came thanks to one of their then-least known characters in 1998&#39;s Blade, in which Wesley Snipes&#39;s titular vampire hunter battles Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) in his plot to unleash the blood god La Magra upon humanity. Just about every element of Blade fires on all cylinders, from its on-the-fly introduction to its hero and the hidden world of vampires to the movie being totally unafraid to dive head-first into the R-rated comic book movie pool long before it was cool. Similarly, Dorff&#39;s scene-chewing portrayal of Deacon Frost is still a highlight supervillain performance of a narcicisstic megalomaniac.
Still, Wesley Snipes&#39;s cool, reserved performance as Blade is what makes the movie work, with Snipes&#39; vampire hunter proves to be a man tortured by his dual nature as a human-vampire hybrid but still able to crack a snarky one-liner whenever the occasion calls for it (one in particular involving ice-skating uphill being an all-timer.) Best of all, Blade brings the electricity of Hong Kong action movies to the superhero genre with blazing martial arts battles that paved the way for 21st century superhero fight choreography. The MCU&#39;s in-development Blade reboot indeed has some big shoes to fill, with 1998&#39;s Blade standing as the greatest comic book movie of the &#39;90s.
