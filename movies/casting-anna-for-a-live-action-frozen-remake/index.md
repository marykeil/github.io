## Literature Review

A Frozen live-action film is inevitable, given Disney&#39;s recent trend of remaking popular movies – who should play Anna in the hypothetical project?




It&#39;s only a matter of time before Walt Disney Studios greenlights a live-action remake of Frozen. Whenever that happens, producers will have a long list of talented actresses who could potentially play Anna. Kristen Bell originated the role of Anna, the princess of Arendelle, in the 2013 animated musical fantasy movie Frozen and returned for the highly-anticipated sequel, Frozen II. Bell is expected to reprise the voice role in the next two installments of the popular Disney film series. But it&#39;s unlikely that Bell would portray Anna in a potential live-action version of Frozen, given that she is more than 20 years older than the character in real life.
Hollywood has many young and talented actresses the casting team of a theoretical live-action Frozen remake can choose from to cast Anna. Of course, the selected performer would have to be able to sing because Disney surely learned its lesson from removing the musical element from the live-action version of Mulan. They would also have to embody Anna&#39;s innocent soul, enthusiasm, and brave spirit as Bell has done and carry on Bell&#39;s legacy. The good news is that many actresses are talented and versatile enough to portray the Disney princess (later the Queen of Arendelle) on the big screen.









 








 10  Florence Pugh 
Pugh has the star power and the talent


 







Florence Pugh is undoubtedly one of the most sought-after actresses in Hollywood due to her unbelievable talent. She has been nominated for an Oscar for Little Women, after all, and will likely win one in the future. Plus, there is no denying that Pugh&#39;s name carries star power, and productions would be foolish to pass on having her in their film. As a result, Pugh should be on the shortlist of performers to play Anna in a live-action remake of Disney&#39;s Frozen.
She is one of the best actresses in Hollywood, and she already has a working relationship with Disney — Pugh stars as Yelena Belova in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Her portrayal of Amy March in Little Women also proves that Pugh can embody Anna&#39;s youthful and stubborn spirit. Although she doesn&#39;t often, Pugh can sing, making her the perfect fit for Anna.

Walt Disney Studios has released numerous live-action versions of some of their most popular animated films, and a Frozen one is inevitable.








 9  Amandla Stenberg 
Stenberg is a versatile actress


 







Amandla Stenberg is most known for her portrayal of Rue in The Hunger Games, but she has been quite busy with other movie roles following the 2012 dystopian action film. Stenberg has also appeared in Everything, Everything, The Hate U Give, The Darkest Minds, Dear Evan Hansen, and Bodies Bodies Bodies. She has won many awards for acting, including an NAACP Image Award, proving her talent. Stenberg&#39;s versatile roles over the years also showcase why she could be the perfect pick to play Anna in a live-action Frozen remake (plus, she can sing, as seen in Dear Evan Hansen).





 8  Sabrina Carpenter 
Carpenter is a fantastic singer and actress
        

Sabrina Carpenter is one of the more obvious choices to play Anna on the big screen — she is known for her singing and acting and excels in both areas. Carpenter got her big break starring as Maya Hart in Girl Meets World, the Disney Channel spin-off of Boy Meets World. Following the end of the series, Carpenter continued acting in various shows and movies, but she also dedicated a lot of her time to making music. Since 2015, the artist has released five studio albums and is now opening for Taylor Swift on the Eras Tour. Carpenter&#39;s career is thriving, and a brief return to Disney would only make sense.





 7  Yara Shahidi 
Shahidi has experience with live-action Disney remakes
        

If Yara Shahidi were to take on the role of Anna in the probable live-action Frozen remake, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time she appeared in a live-action version of a popular Walt Disney Animation Studios film. Shahidi previously starred as Tinkerbell in Peter Pan &amp; Wendy, a remake of the 1953 movie Peter Pan. It debuted on Disney&#43; in 2023, but audiences did not rave over it, so it falls to the wayside when discussing Disney live-action projects. So, Shahidi, also known for her roles in Black-ish, Grown-ish, and The Sun Is Also a Star, should get a second chance with Frozen.





 6  Kiernan Shipka 
Shipka would be perfect in a Disney role
        

Kiernan Shipka is most known for starring as Sabrina Spellman in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix, and most of the other projects on her resume contain the same tone as the supernatural horror television series. It&#39;s time that Shipka took on a less serious and horrifying role, and playing Anna in a live-action version of Frozen would be just that. Although Anna is the complete opposite of the characters that Shipka typically plays, the actress could undoubtedly pull it off, given her talent and singing voice. Plus, Shipka was made to portray a Disney princess based on her looks.

Frozen&#39;s success has already guaranteed two more films in the franchise, though it was a prequel novel that fixed a major backstory criticism.








 5  Grace VanderWaal 
VanderWaal is known for her singing, but she can also act
        

Grace VanderWaal first rose to prominence when she auditioned for America&#39;s Got Talent season 11 at 12 years old. She sang an original song that she wrote — &#34;I Don&#39;t Know My Name&#34; — and blew the judges and the audience away. Howie Mandel used his Golden Buzzer (which each judge got one of and allowed the chosen act to skip the next round of the competition) on VanderWaal, and she went on to win the season.
Her audition and story quickly went viral, and the young star became famous overnight. Since her win, VanderWaal has continued making music but has also tried her hand at acting, proving her talent transcends just music. Consequentially, she would be perfect as Anna in a Frozen live-action movie.





 4  Sadie Sink 
Sink is almost done with Stranger Things
        

Sadie Sink is known for her role as Max Mayfield in Stranger Things. Now that the popular Netflix series is nearing its end, it&#39;s time for the talented kids who got their start on the show to look ahead to new projects, and for Sink, that could be the rumored live-action version of Frozen. The red hair helps, but Sink is, first and foremost, a gifted actress with the range to play almost any part. She can also sing, and portraying Anna could allow Sink to show off her voice.
























 3  Isabela Merced 
Merced is an up-and-coming, talented young actress
        

Isabela Merced has been acting since she was 12, but she has garnered a lot of attention in the past few years due to her appearances in Transformers: The Last Knight and Dora and the Lost City of Gold. Merced is set to star in multiple upcoming highly-anticipated films, like Madame Web, Turtles All the Way Down, and Alien: Romulus. So, if Disney wanted to cast an up-and-coming actress to play Anna in a live-action remake of Frozen, Merced could be the best performer for the job.





 2  Hailee Steinfeld 
Steinfeld has proven she can take on any role


 







Honestly, Hailee Steinfeld should be considered for every and any role possible in Hollywood. Her breakout came in 2010 with True Grit, which garnered her an Oscar nomination, indicating the direction her career was heading. Steinfeld has appeared in numerous critically acclaimed and popular movies and shows, like The Edge of Seventeen, the Pitch Perfect film series, Bumblebee, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Dickinson, and Hawkeye. She is also an accomplished singer, with two EPs released. It would just make sense if Steinfeld is considered for the part of Anna in a live-action version of Frozen.
            
 
 Frozen 4 Already Has A Story Problem (&amp; There&#39;s No Simple Way To Fix It) 
While the Frozen franchise is one of Disney&#39;s most popular of all time, its continuation may run into a significant story problem fairly soon.








 1  Lana Condor 
Condor is known for her acting, but she can also sing
        

The last actress who would be the perfect pick to play Anna on the big screen is Lana Condor. Condor is known for playing Lara Jean Covey in the To All the Boys film series on Netflix. But she has appeared in other movies such as X-Men: Apocalypse, Alita: Battle Angel, Moonshot, and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken. Since acting has been at the forefront of her career, many don&#39;t know Condor also has a fantastic singing voice. By taking into account that she can sing and that she masterfully played Lara Jean (who shares some qualities with Anna), Condor could easily star in a possible live-action remake of Frozen.
Frozen 3 and Frozen 4 are currently in development at Walt Disney Animation Studios.
