Summary

  Admiral Atticus Noble&#39;s choice of not carrying a gun adds to his intimidation factor in Rebel Moon.   Noble&#39;s use of a bone-shaped staff serves as a metaphor for the heavy-handedness of the Imperium.   Noble&#39;s resurrection at the end of the movie explains his confidence and disregard for his own safety.  







Admiral Atticus Noble is one of the main antagonists in Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire, but it&#39;s initially unclear where his ominous presence and intimidation factor stem from. Although there are times when Noble displays the odd burst of intense violence, most of his time on screen is spent in a state of quiet intensity. His aura becomes much more understandable when a certain detail about him is unveiled towards Rebel Moon: Part One&#39;s ending.

Atticus Noble is played by Ed Skrein in A Child of Fire. Before his appearance in the Zack Snyder space opera, Skrein was perhaps most well-known for his role as Ajax in 2016&#39;s Deadpool. In A Child of Fire, Noble is a senior figure in the Imperium, working with Regent Balisarius to further their grasp on the galaxy. Noble displays an impressive amount of confidence both on and off the battlefield in the movie, as well as having an unorthodox fighting style. The Admiral is one of the most compelling members of Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon cast of characters, with one distinct detail regarding the antagonist&#39;s weaponry making him even more terrifying than those around him.




              Related   Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver Release Date, Cast, Story, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon: Part Two will closely follow the first movie in his franchise and here is everything known, including the release date.    


 Admiral Atticus Noble Doesn&#39;t Carry A Gun In Rebel Moon 
The Rebel Moon villain&#39;s choice adds to his intimidation factor
          

Although often flanked by armed soldiers, Admiral Atticus Noble never actually carries a gun himself. However, the fact that Noble is unarmed in no way means he doesn&#39;t have a lust for blood. The opening of the movie sees the admiral in an intense act of violence as he beats Sindri to death with a bone-shaped staff. Speaking with ComingSoon, director Zack Snyder stated that the staff serves as a metaphor for the Imperium itself. Describing the Imperium, the filmmaker voiced his view that they are &#34;very heavy-handed,&#34; and that the Imperium is &#34;not surgical.&#34;




              Related   Zack Snyder Clarifies Details About Rebel Moon&#39;s Director&#39;s Cut   Zack Snyder clarifies just how different the Rebel Moon director&#39;s cut will be from the original release, and he explains why he made those changes.    

As well as serving as a fitting metaphor for the Imperium itself, Noble&#39;s staff acts as a reinforcement agent for his intensely confident demeanor. Even during the final showdown in A Child of Fire, Admiral Noble doesn&#39;t stray from his weapon of choice, despite the film&#39;s array of guns and other lethal arms. Confirming his confidence in his own battle skills and lack of reliance on weapons like guns, Noble&#39;s staff greatly enhances his menacing intimidation. Using only his bone staff, Noble keeps himself alive throughout the battle, and even uses the weapon to coordinate his troops&#39; attacks.



 Admiral Noble Not Carrying A Gun Makes His Fight With Kora Even Better 
The unarmed fight between Noble and Kora is one of the best scenes in Rebel Moon
   Close     




Although Kora&#39;s dark backstory reveals that she has impressive hand-to-hand combat skills, as shown early in the movie, she often opts for arming herself with a firearm when one is available. Noble&#39;s level of prowess with a gun in his hand is unknown, but also irrelevant during his battle with Kora. The fight is fairly evenly matched, despite Noble&#39;s aptitude and experience for combat without a gun. Noble&#39;s skill and stamina allow him to stay in the skirmish even once his signature staff is broken in half, leaving him without any extra weapon to rely on.

The stand-off is a tense scene, and Noble&#39;s chances of victory seem to be greater than Kora&#39;s, especially given his confidence and skill in unarmed combat. When Kora finally defeats Admiral Noble, it comes as a shock. If Noble made a habit of carrying a gun, he could easily have taken Kora down with a single shot, and A Child of Fire would have lost one of its best scenes.



 Rebel Moon&#39;s Atticus Noble&#39;s Confidence Makes More Sense After He Is Resurrected 
The ending of Rebel Moon explains Noble&#39;s demeanor
          




Admiral Noble displays a terrifying lack of fear during various scenes of A Child of Fire, but the reason for his incredible bravado becomes clear near the end of the movie. When Noble falls to his death following his loss to Kora, Rebel Moon reveals that death is not the end for the villainous admiral. Rather, Noble is resurrected in Rebel Moon&#39;s ending and his consciousness is sent to the astral plane. Although Noble is shown to be technologically augmented during certain scenes, the function of said alterations to his body is not initially explained.

Noble seems to almost have a complete disregard for his own safety, and this is not addressed until the end of the movie. Despite his perceived self-recklessness, Ed Skrein&#39;s Noble is a very level-headed villain, which only raises further questions regarding his decision to head into battle with only his staff for protection. When the Imperium recovers Noble&#39;s body, his implants are revealed to be for not only communicating with Balisarius, but also for bringing Noble back from the dead.




              Related   How Many Rebel Moon Movies Will There Be?   The first two Rebel Moon movies are confirmed and will appear on Netflix, but Zack Snyder has plans to expand his new space opera further.    

The fact that Admiral Noble can be resurrected after his death immediately gives weight to his endless confidence in situations that would instill fear into many. Knowing that he can return from the dead means Admiral Noble&#39;s fate is difficult to predict, and the ability acts as a kind of foreshadowing of his temporary death in the movie. Admiral Noble neglecting to carry a gun in Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire also becomes a display of power and undying trust that he will not meet a permanent end should he fail to win.



Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is streaming now on Netflix. Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver is set to hit Netflix in April 2024.
