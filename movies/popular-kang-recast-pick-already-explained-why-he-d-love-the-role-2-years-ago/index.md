## Literature Review

With Jonathan Majors out as Kang the Conqueror, there is a top candidate to replace him, and his past comments bode well for the possible casting.




A rumored candidate to play Kang the Conqueror in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has already proved that he would be perfect for the role. Now that Kang actor Jonathan Majors was fired by Marvel Studios, Kang the Conqueror&#39;s status in the MCU is up in the air. While Marvel could replace the character with Doctor Doom or another major villain as the main bad guy of the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga, Marvel&#39;s upcoming movies are more likely to simply recast Kang rather than let go of the character.




Marvel has spent too much time setting up Kang the Conqueror and his many variants, with the multiversal Council of Kangs likely the main threat of the upcoming Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, to go back now. While all MCU variants of Kang have been played by Majors so far, Marvel could choose to feature multiple actors as different Kang variants and/or set a new star as Kang the Conqueror. Among the popular recast choices for Kang the Conqueror is a high-profile actor whose two-year-old superhero movie coments have made clear would be perfect as Kang.

                  10 Kang Cosplays That Look Ready To Conquer The Marvel Multiverse   Kang the Conqueror is the main villain of the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga, and these cosplays show how his different variants can conquer the multiverse.

According to a major rumor that has been making the rounds online, Colman Domingo is being eyed by Marvel Studios as a possible replacement for Majors as Kang the Conqueror. At 54, Domingo is twenty years older than Majors, whch would mean a big change to how Kang was portrayed in the MCU. However, given the multiverse has revealed several different variants of Kang, the possible new MCU actor&#39;s age should not be a problem. Acting wise, Domingo has everything to nail the character.

As Victor Strand in Fear The Walking Dead, the actor has played a charismatic villain who can go from empathetic to downright despicable with the flip of a switch. If Domingo were to continue Majors&#39; situation of playing all Kang variants, the actor could easily make all the different versions of Kang feel unique, just like Majors did. Marvel&#39;s possible interest in Domingo also comes at the right time, with the actor having a very real chance of being nominated for a Best Actor Oscar this year for Rustin.

I’m worked out, I&#39;m fit... I think I want to play a villain. I just want to be a villain. I don’t want to be the good guy. I actually want to do some really dirty, nasty work.&#34; Domingo&#39;s villain description fits what Marvel Studios is looking for, making the actor the perfect pick to play the new version of Kang the Conqueror in the MCU.
