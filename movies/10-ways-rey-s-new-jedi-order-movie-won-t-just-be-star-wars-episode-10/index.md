## Literature Review

The Skywalker saga has come to an end, and Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie will be far more than just Episode 10 - here&#39;s what we&#39;re expecting!




Rey&#39;s upcoming Star Wars movie will be a whole lot more than just Star Wars 10. The Star Wars sequel trilogy came to an end with 2019&#39;s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and the franchise hasn&#39;t been on the big screen since. Lucasfilm used Star Wars Celebration 2023 to confirm the drought of new movies will soon come to an end, announcing three upcoming Star Wars blockbusters.
One of these exciting projects will see Daisy Ridley return, with Rey launching a New Jedi Order. All the signs are that it won&#39;t be long before there&#39;s more news about this project, but until then there&#39;s intense debate over whether it should essentially be considered Star Wars: Episode X - or whether it&#39;s something completely separate. The latter is surely the case, because Lucasfilm is moving on from the Skywalker saga to something new.

 10  Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order Is The Aftermath Of The Skywalker Saga 
Rey Skywalker Breaks The Series&#39; Chain
        

Although Rey takes the name of Skywalker in a controversial scene at the end of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, she breaks the mold that the trilogies that came before consistently build up. Though she has chosen her family, she is seen burying the lightsabers of both Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, showing that it is time to put the previous generation of Jedi to rest. With a yellow lightsaber in hand, a lightsaber used by the Jedi Temple Guards of the prequel era, Rey shows that she will follow her own path, not the one laid out by the Skywalkers that came before her.
























 9  The Sith Have Been Destroyed By Rey&#39;s New Movie 
Emperor Palpatine Is Gone For Good
        

The Star Wars sequel trilogy ended with the unexpected return of Emperor Palpatine. The Dark Lord of the Sith was the main antagonist of all three Star Wars trilogies, and he celebrated his power by claiming he had become the embodiment of all the Sith. His death means the threat of the Sith is finally over, and Star Wars can move on from that familiar Jedi vs. Sith dichotomy.





 8  Most Legacy Characters Can No Longer Appear In The New Jedi Order Era 
Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, And Han Solo Have All Died


 







Now that the sequel trilogy has finished, so have the stories of some of Star Wars&#39; most iconic characters. Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa, and Han Solo all met their end fighting against the First Order. Even Ben Solo, who was both Rey&#39;s greatest foe as Kylo Ren and her greatest ally after his redemption, died in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The new trilogy will be somewhat removed from those that came before simply because many iconic characters cannot be included.





 7  Star Wars Will Be Forced To Carve A Unique Path 
The Star Wars Galaxy Was Forever Changed After The Rise Of Skywalker
        

After the defeat of the Emperor and the First Order by the Resistance, the galaxy entered a new era of (potential) peace without the threat of the Sith looming over them. It is almost impossible to think of a Star Wars movie without the Sith, and for this reason the trilogy will have to redefine what Star Wars is. More than anything, Rey&#39;s trilogy should be unique and learn from the shortcomings the sequel trilogy had in taking too many notes from the original trilogy.





 6  Rey&#39;s Jedi Code Will Be Different From Before 
Luke Skywalker Taught Rey The Jedi&#39;s Failings


 







When Luke Skywalker was training Rey on Ahch-To, he explained to her the shortcomings of the original Jedi Order. Specifically, Luke tells her &#34;At the height of their powers, they allowed Darth Sidious to rise, create the Empire, and wipe them out. It was a Jedi Master who was responsible for the training and creation of Darth Vader.&#34; Because he explained that the Jedi were also responsible for some of the evil in the galaxy, it stands to reason that Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order and her Jedi Code will change to reflect this in an effort to reduce the amount of harm caused by her version of the Jedi. She will no doubt by helped by ancient texts that predate the mistakes of the prequel Jedi.





 5  This Generation Of Star Wars Could Follow Younger Protagonists 
Rey Could Recruit Younglings To The New Jedi Order
        

Aside from Rey, there is a high possibility that a majority of the main protagonists of the new trilogy could be a bit younger due to the fact they will be new recruits to the Jedi Order. Although it is unlikely that Rey will continue the old Jedi practice of solely recruiting very young children, it&#39;s likely she will end up training either young recruits willing to learn, or prospective Jedi from a variety of different ages. Because of this, there is a possibility that the ages of the protagonists could either skew younger or vary wildly, with the New Jedi Order pulling from all walks of life.





 4  Star Wars Legends Could Be A Major Influence On The New Jedi Order 
The New Jedi Order Appears In The Extended Universe
        

Lucasfilm&#39;s recent Star Wars TV shows and comics have adapted ideas straight from Star Wars Legends - with Grand Admiral Thrawn as the best example. Rey&#39;s new Star Wars trilogy could well do the same, and that&#39;s an exciting possibility given the era&#39;s title. In Legends, the &#34;New Jedi Order&#34; series of novels saw the galaxy invaded by an alien race known as the Yuuzhan Vong. There have been many clues pointing toward the Yuuzhan Vong in canon as well, making this quite possible.





 3  Rey&#39;s Trilogy Will Have A Fresh New Writer And Director 
Steven Knight And Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy Are New To Star Wars
        

One exciting fact about Rey&#39;s new trilogy is that the trilogy&#39;s writer and director, Steven Knight and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, are new to the Star Wars franchise. Steven Knight is responsible for instant classics, such as the series Peaky Blinders and his adaptation of All The Light We Cannot See. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy on the other hand is best known for her award-winning documentary Saving Face as well as her more recent miniseries, Ms. Marvel. It will be interesting to see what these two do with both the trilogy and Rey&#39;s story specifically going forward.





 2  Star Wars Will Have To Introduce A Fresh Set Of Characters 
The New Fledgling Jedi Have Been Thrown Into Chaos
        

According to Lucasfilm&#39;s Kathleen Kennedy, the Jedi will be in &#34;chaos&#34; during Rey&#39;s movie. Whether or not this will be because of Rey&#39;s teachings or an outside force remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain. There will be a new cast of characters joining Rey on her journey. There need to be new Jedi to be thrown into chaos, after all. For now, viewers will have to wait to see what characters will be introduced.





 1  Rey&#39;s Trilogy Will Signify The Future Of The Star Wars Franchise 
A New Star Wars Trilogy Will Set The Standard


 







Regardless of how the new trilogy is received, both by old and new viewers alike, the next Star Wars movie will set the standard for everything that follows. This is far more than Star Wars: Episode X - it&#39;s a whole new direction for the entire franchise. It will be thrilling to see where things go.
