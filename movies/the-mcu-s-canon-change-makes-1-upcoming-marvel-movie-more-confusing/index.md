# The MCU s Canon Change Makes 1 Upcoming Marvel Movie More Confusing


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s Marvel Television shows may now be officially canon to the MCU, according to the MCU&#39;s official timeline on Disney&#43;.   This could complicate the casting of Mahershala Ali in the upcoming Blade reboot, as he previously played a different character in Luke Cage.   Marvel Studios has dealt with double-casting before, so they may either ignore the issue or come up with an explanation for Ali&#39;s identical appearances.

## Literature Review

Marvel Studios may have just made the Defenders canon to the MCU, but this could confuse a major casting choice for an anticipated upcoming project.




A major casting choice for Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Blade reboot might have just been confused thanks to a huge change in the official timeline of the MCU. Long before the days of Disney&#43;, Marvel Television produced its own series of shows for Netflix focused on more mature, street-level stories and characters. Dubbed the Defenders Saga, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, The Defenders and The Punisher have recently been the subjects of dispute concerning MCU canon. Initially, these shows were thought to be set in the world of the MCU, but the development of Marvel Studios&#39; own TV shows for Disney&#43; left this unclear.




Marvel Television&#39;s Defenders Saga saw Charlie Cox, Krysten Ritter, Mike Colter, Finn Jones, Jon Bernthal and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio portray some of Marvel Comics&#39; most iconic street-level characters in live-action. Cox and D&#39;Onofrio have since reprised their roles of Matt Murdock&#39;s Daredevil and Wilson Fisk&#39;s Kingpin, respectively, in the MCU proper, and Bernthal will join them in Marvel Studios&#39; Daredevil: Born Again, but the others&#39; futures are less clear. However, there is hope for these other heroes to return after recent developments in the MCU&#39;s official timeline, but other characters&#39; stories may have been confused by some major changes behind the scenes at Marvel Studios.

                  Daredevil &amp; The Defenders Complete Timeline: What Order To Watch   The Netflix Marvel shows are on Disney&#43;. With Daredevil: Born Again on the way, hereâ€™s the full watch order for The Defenders shows and The Punisher.   


 Marvel Just Made The Defenders MCU Canon 
         




In conjunction with the release of Marvel Studios&#39; Echo series in January 2024, Marvel Television&#39;s Defenders Saga projects were folded into the MCU&#39;s official timeline listed on Disney&#43;. This seems to imply that the six shows that originally aired on Netflix may now be officially canon to the MCU&#39;s overarching story, though Marvel Studios hasn&#39;t yet provided comment on the matter. Echo marked the returns of Daredevil and Kingpin, with the latter confirming that some events depicted in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series occurred in the MCU&#39;s main continuity, though it seems Marvel Studios is picking and choosing which bits to keep and which to rewrite.



 Blade&#39;s MCU Casting Is More Complex After The Timeline Change 
          

While the idea of the Defenders Saga finally being confirmed to be canon to the MCU is exciting for several reasons, not least because it means popular characters may return in the MCU&#39;s future, this could also confuse the status quo of several upcoming MCU projects. Perhaps most notably, Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali has been attached to Marvel Studios&#39; upcoming Blade reboot since 2019, and is set to appear as the film&#39;s titular star, a leading role in the MCU. This is despite his turn as the villain Cornell &#34;Cottonmouth&#34; Stokes in Luke Cage, which was another main role, so his double-casting could be difficult to explain.




This won&#39;t be the first time an actor has portrayed two different MCU roles. Gemma Chan debuted as Minn-Erva in Captain Marvel before assuming the role of Sersi in Eternals, Michelle Yeoh portrayed Aleta Ogord in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Ying Nan in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and Luke Cage alum Alfre Woodard played Cottonmouth&#39;s cousin Mariah Dillard in the Netflix series as well as Miriam Sharpe in Captain America: Civil War. This means that Marvel Studios could ignore the double-casting of Mahershala Ali in Luke Cage and Blade, or perhaps another explanation will be devised to explain his characters&#39; identical appearances.
