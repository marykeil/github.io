## Literature Review

The Book of Clarence&#39;s Jeymes Samuel put together a fantastic soundtrack, which features artists like Jay-Z, Doja Cat, Kodak Black, and more. 




The Book of Clarence&#39;s soundtrack adds a unique flavor to the comedy-drama, allowing the daring film to bring a perfect balance of contemporary comedy to the biblical setting. The 2024 film is written and directed by Jeymes Samuel, who was also responsible for the songs featured throughout Clarence&#39;s story. This required the combined efforts of several big names in the music scene, including Lil Wayne, Kodak Black, Doja Cat, Jay-Z, Yemi Aldi, and many more.




Samuel&#39;s The Book of Clarence, which hit theaters on January 12, 2024, follows the titular Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield), a low-class drug dealer struggling to support his mother and get the girl of his dreams in Biblical-era Jerusalem. Seeing how much money and influence Jesus of Nazareth and his apostles have acquired, Clarence decides to pull off a massive scam in which he would present himself as the true Messiah. This ambitious concept could have quickly fallen flat, but The Book of Clarence managed to set itself up as a cult comedy icon, and this has everything to do with Samuel&#39;s collaboration with prominent Black artists to create an excellent soundtrack.

 When Every Song On The Book Of Clarence Soundtrack Plays In The Movie 
          

“Jeezu” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Kodak Black, Doja Cat &amp; Adekunle Gold - Samuel, Kodak Black, Doja Cat, and Adekunle Gold&#39;s combined efforts meant the perfect song to introduce The Book of Clarence&#39;s unique concept and flavor. &#34;Jeezu&#34; played as Clarence and Elijah entered Jerusalem, juxtaposing the historical look of the ancient city.




“Hallelujah Heaven” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Lil Wayne, Buju Banton &amp; Shabba Ranks - The second song we hear in The Book of Clarence comes as Jesus and his 12 Apostles dramatically enter the square in Jerusalem. Though we don&#39;t see the Messaiah&#39;s face here, the drama of &#34;Hallelujah Heaven,&#34; which features Lil Wayne, Buju Banton, and Shabba Ranks, makes it clear that he is a pretty big deal, setting up Clarence&#39;s eventual plan to imitate Jesus&#39; big &#34;scam.&#34;

“All About You” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Jorge Ben Jor - &#34;All About You,&#34; featuring Jorge Ben Jor, plays twice in The Book of Clarence. First, the song accompanies Clarence and Elijah as they ride in a car around the city, selling their illicit substances. It plays again after the beggar (Benedict Cumberbatch) is cleaned up and begins roaming Jerusalem, handing out coins.

“Godqueen” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Kid Cudi - This song plays as Clarence heads into Jedediah the Terrible&#39;s house, full of dancing women and frightening members of the homeowner&#39;s gang, to woefully announce that he can&#39;t pay back his debt. &#34;Godqueen,&#34; featuring Kid Cudi, has a slow, romantic feel, foreshadowing Clarence&#39;s affection toward Jedediah&#39;s sister, Varinia (Anna Diop).




“I Want You Forever” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. D’Angelo &amp; Jay-Z - After meeting with Jedediah, Clarence has a moment with Varinia that ends with the song &#34;I Want You Forever,&#34; which features D&#39;Angelo and Jay-Z. As this piece plays, the scene transitions from Clarence and Varinia to the beggar on the street.

“Varinia” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Terry Callier - &#34;Varinia,&#34; named for Clarence&#39;s love interest, plays in the background, and the couple discuss the recent changes in the &#34;new Messiah&#39;s&#34; personality. The song ends as the Roman soldiers make their appearance, and Clarence proves how he has matured by running away.

“Magdalene” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Alice Smith - Another song named for one of the characters of The Book of Clarence, &#34;Magdalene,&#34; plays after Jesus saves Mary Magdalene from those who sought to stone her. Directly after, Elijah returns to Clarence to announce that he witnessed the real Messiah&#39;s miracle.




“Champagne” by Jeymes Samuel Feat. Jorja Smith - The party scene is one of the few that features a song not written by Samuel. &#34;Nights Over Egypt&#34; by The Jones Girls

plays as Clarence, Varinia, and the other partygoers perform their choreographed dance. After the couple shares their romantic moment (and a kiss), &#34;Champagne,&#34; featuring Jorja Smith, plays instead.

“Dear Heaven” by Jeymes Samuel - Samuel&#39;s &#34;Dear Heaven&#34; takes an emotional turn compared to the other songs on the Book of Clarence soundtrack, which makes sense considering it plays over Clarence&#39;s burial scene. The lyrics of this song perfectly summarize the central character&#39;s arc—featuring his newfound love and knowledge. The song continues to play as Jesus opens Clarence&#39;s tomb, brings him back from the dead, and fades away as The Book of Clarence fades into the credits.

“Nazarene” -by Jeymes Samuel - &#34;Nazarene&#34; is the song that takes The Book of Clarence into the credits, bringing the energy back up just a notch from the previous piece, &#34;Dear Heaven.&#34;

Even separate from The Book of Clarence, this collection of masterpieces from several of the age&#39;s best Black artists is worth streaming on repeat.

However, The Book of Clarences&#39; writer and director creates songs that perfectly meld these artists and their experiences with that of the titular main character, resulting in a soundtrack that makes just as much a statement on its own as it does from scene to scene in The Book of Clarence.
