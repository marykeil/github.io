## Literature Review

The Godzilla Minus One box office passes a major milestone worldwide, while the Japanese kaiju movie also continues to climb the domestic charts.




The Godzilla Minus One box office has passed a major global milestone. Written and directed by Takashi Yamazaki, who also handled the visual effects, the latest film in the kaiju franchise from Toho Studios follows the emergence of Godzilla in postwar Japan, with the Godzilla Minus One cast including Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada, Munetaka Aoki, Hidetaka Yoshioka, Sakura Ando, and Kuranosuke Sasaki. The movie was released in theaters late last year to surprise success and has become the biggest Japanese-language Godzilla film of all time.




Now, the Godzilla Minus One box office has passed another major milestone globally and is zeroing in on more. According to Collider, the movie has made $90 million globally and is marching towards the coveted $100 million mark worldwide. Before then, Godzilla Minus One should pass the $50 million mark domestically, making it one of the highest-grossing live-action foreign-language films at the North American box office between Guillermo del Toro’s Pan’s Labyrinth ($37 million) and Bong Joon-ho&#39;s Parasite ($53 million).


 Godzilla Minus One&#39;s Box Office Success Explained 
          

Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office has been breaking records since its release in North American theaters on December 1. During its opening weekend, it made $11 million in the United States, finishing behind two American blockbusters – Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé and The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Though $11 million may not sound like much, this broke multiple box office records, including the biggest domestic opening for a foreign-language film in 2023, the second-highest debut for any live-action foreign-language film behind 2002’s Hero, and the biggest domestic debut for a Japanese live-action film.

The kaiju film&#39;s success continued well beyond its opening weekend, eventually passing 2016&#39;s Shin Godzilla to become the highest-grossing Japanese-language Godzilla movie of all time. It&#39;s now set to surpass $100 million worldwide and $50 million in the United States, a feat only accomplished by roughly 50 movies in 2023. In addition to Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office success, it surprisingly made the Academy Awards shortlist for Best Visual Effects and is expected to be nominated at the 2024 Oscars.
