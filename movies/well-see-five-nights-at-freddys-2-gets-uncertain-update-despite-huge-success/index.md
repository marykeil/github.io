Summary

  Blumhouse executive Ryan Turek reveals that Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 hasn&#39;t been greenlit yet, saying of the wait that &#34;it&#39;s just part of the process&#34;.   Although not popular with critics, the film was a massive success at the box office, making a sequel likely.

Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 gets an update from Blumhouse executive Ryan Turek, who explains why the sequel hasn&#39;t yet been given the green light. Released last fall to generally poor reviews, the big-screen adaptation of the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s video game franchise was a big commercial hit. The film stars Josh Hutcherson as a security guard who accepts a job at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza only to find that the establishment&#39;s animatronic mascots come to life at night and attempt to murder anyone inside.

Now, Turek provides an update on Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 during a recent interview with Collider. While it&#39;s somewhat surprising that a sequel hasn&#39;t yet been given the green light, the executive&#39;s comments suggest that Blumhouse is still deciding on how best to proceed with the franchise. Check out the full interaction below:


I don&#39;t think Blumhouse has announced it, but is there gonna be a Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s sequel? I&#39;m assuming. It made so much money.
TUREK: That movie made so much money. It was a huge success, and we&#39;re grateful for that. Emma [Tammi] did such a great job, but we’re still waiting for the green light on that. We&#39;ll see.
Which is crazy.
TUREK: No, it&#39;s not crazy. It&#39;s just part of the process, I think.
Sure. I am surprised that there hasn&#39;t been a date of, like, 7/2/25 on a sequel movie that did that well on both streaming and in theaters.
TUREK: Right, I&#39;m sure Jason&#39;s got some tricks up his sleeve.





  


 What Could Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Be About? 
          

The Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s ending doesn&#39;t directly set up a sequel, but it certainly leaves the door open for another story. Hutcherson&#39;s Mike remains alive at the end of the film, as does Abby (Piper Rubio) and Vanessa (Elizabeth Lail). Steve (Matthew Lilard), aka William Afton, the central Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s villain suffers a grisly fate, and all is seemingly set right at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza.



Although scoring a low 31% on Rotten Tomatoes, Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s was a smash hit at the box office, raking in over $295 million worldwide on a budget of only $20 million. It currently stands as the highest-grossing Blumhouse movie ever.







While it&#39;s certainly possible that Hutcherson and other members of the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s cast return for a sequel, a follow-up could also take things in a new direction. There are now nine games in the mainline franchise, and many of them introduce new characters and settings. Should another movie get the green light, it could take after one of the later games, telling a wildly different story.

In the fourth video game installment, for example, the story essentially takes place entirely in a child&#39;s bedroom. Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s: Sister Location doesn&#39;t take place at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza at all, introducing a new location called Circus Baby&#39;s Entertainment and Rental. If Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 does happen, then, there are a number of different directions the story could go in.
