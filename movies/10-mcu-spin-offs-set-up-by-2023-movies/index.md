## Literature Review

The three MCU movies released in 2023 actually set up a number of exciting spin-off stories that could take place within the wider franchise.




Three movies were released as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2023, setting up several potential spin-offs for the franchise&#39;s future. 2023 saw multiple releases into the MCU, with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and The Marvels all enjoying theatrical runs. The three movies each served as sequels to previous MCU movies, continuing to build upon the MCU’s movie timeline by expanding character arcs and, in some cases, bringing specific stories to a close.
As each MCU release is also part of a much wider shared universe, it’s practically a given that any project has the potential to set up at least one spin-off. 2023 proved to be no exception, with multiple new narrative avenues opening up as a result of its cinematic releases. The movies of the MCU released in 2023 established several potential spin-offs following new or existing characters and settings, with a number of exciting stories now waiting to be told within the franchise. With that in mind, here are 10 spin-offs set up by MCU movies in 2023.

The Marvel movies releasing in 2024 offer a range of film experiences - and some confusion, due to the changed dates of several incoming installments.












 








 10  There Are Many Quantum Realm Stories To Tell 
Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

As Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania delved into the new frontier of the Quantum Realm, it only follows that the film also set up many potential spin-offs set there. The cast of Quantumania featured a number of intriguing new characters who call the Quantum Realm home, thereby establishing several new stories waiting to be told within the franchise. Though very few of the characters in question played a large enough role for Marvel to bank on a spin-off, there are countless narratives that could realistically be explored in the Quantum Realm in the franchise’s future.





 9  Gamora And The Ravagers’ Adventures Would Make A Great TV Show 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

After her death in Avengers: Infinity War, the MCU’s Gamora is now a variant with no memory of her fellow Guardians. This made for an interesting shift in dynamic for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which revealed that Gamora had joined a Ravager crew and embraced them as her new family. The end of the film sees her rejoin her Ravager friends, teasing the possibility that their cosmic exploits might be explored in the MCU’s future. Gamora’s status as a beloved character combined with the space-faring ways of the Ravagers would make an excellent story, especially in an episodic format as a Disney&#43; series.





 8  Monica Rambeau Deserves Her Own Spin-Off Story 
The Marvels (2023)


 







Though Monica Rambeau was a major part of the cast of The Marvels and WandaVision – and is now a full-fledged MCU hero of her own – she has yet to feature in a solo project. Her power level and competence as a hero have now been proven within the MCU, and the character being stranded in an alternate reality means that a Monica Rambeau spin-off is actually imperative for the MCU’s Multiverse Saga. Explaining how Monica is going to return to the MCU proper is important, and it would be a great way to capitalize on her potential in a solo spin-off.





 7  Janet Van Dyne&#39;s Past Is One Of The MCU&#39;s Most Interesting Unseen Stories 
Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

The MCU’s Ant-Man stories have largely been successful for the franchise, but they have neglected one or two key characters. One of these is Janet Van Dyne, the original Wasp, who spent 30 years trapped in the Quantum Realm with Kang the Conqueror. Van Dyne’s lost years were hinted at in Quantumania, and they remain one of the MCU’s most intriguing unexplored stories. Quantumania saw her return to the Quantum Realm, potentially setting up a spin-off chronicling her previous time there.





 6  The Legendary Star-Lord Will Return 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

The MCU has a habit of teasing future stories well in advance, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3’s post-credits scenes did exactly that. As the film saw the franchise’s original Guardians disband and Star-Lord return to Earth, it appeared to be the end of his narrative arc. However, the MCU then promised that Star-Lord would return, teasing a solo spin-off for the popular comedic hero. It’s likely that the spin-off will follow Peter Quill’s return to Earth and continuing role as a hero within the MCU.





 5  A Captain Marvel/Skrull Story Could Iron Out MCU Plot Holes 
The Marvels (2023)


 







2023 was a year with the potential to follow up on Captain Marvel’s interesting promise of a Skrull storyline, although its execution left much to be desired. This has left room for a Captain Marvel spin-off following Carol Danvers as she finally delivers in full on her promise to the Skrull refugees, as both Secret Invasion and The Marvels failed to deliver an adequate ending to the MCU’s loose plot threads involving the Skrulls still on Earth.





 4  Iron Lad Must Be Somewhere In The Multiverse 
Ant-Man and Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

As Quantumania’s post-credits scene featured countless Kang variants, it appears that the film has subtly set up an exciting potential sequel. With so many Kang variants confirmed to exist within the Multiverse, it seems a certainty that Iron Lad also ranks among them. In the comics, Iron Lad is a heroic Kang variant who often works with the Young Avengers, and the scope of Kang’s MCU variants, as established in 2023, opens the possibility that Iron Lad may be introduced in the future.





 3  The MCU Has Set Up An Entire X-Men Universe Of Stories 
The Marvels (2023)
        

As The Marvels’ post-credits scene confirmed that the X-Men exist within an alternate reality in the MCU’s Multiverse, the potential for connected spin-offs is massive. Whether the universe shown in The Marvels is Fox’s X-Men universe or simply features the same characters could be explored in a spin-off, or it could introduce an entirely new universe of X-Men stories. In addition, a spin-off involving the X-Men Universe could establish how the two sets of heroes will cross over into a single MCU continuity, making the spin-off potential seem practically endless.





 2  The New Guardians Of The Galaxy Are Intriguingly Powerful 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 saw the MCU’s original Guardians go their separate ways, but the film also set up their successors. The team comprises multiple MCU characters, including two with staggering power levels. Adam Warlock and Phyla are both immensely powerful in the comics, meaning that a New Guardians spin-off could see the team become a cosmic force to be reckoned with in the MCU, potentially even outdoing the Avengers in terms of raw power.





 1  The Young Avengers Are Now Confirmed For The MCU 
The Marvels (2023)


 







The last hugely exciting spin-off set up in the MCU’s 2023 releases was the franchise’s Young Avengers. Though the introduction of the team has long been suspected, The Marvels confirmed it, with Kamala Khan recruiting young heroes for a new MCU team. The Young Avengers are one of the MCU’s most exciting spin-offs and one that appears to be all but ready to go ahead within the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the near future.
