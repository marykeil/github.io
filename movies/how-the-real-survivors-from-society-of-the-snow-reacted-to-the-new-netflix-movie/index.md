## Literature Review

Society of the Snow director J.A. Bayona reveals how the real survivors of the 1972 Andes flight disaster reacted to the new Netflix survival movie.




Society of the Snow director J.A. Bayona has revealed how real survivors of the 1972 Andes flight disaster reacted to the new movie now streaming on Netflix. The film is a dramatized version of the real-world incident, wherein Uruguayan Air Force flight 571 crashed in the Andes with a rugby team aboard. By the time they were rescued, only 16 of the 33 initial survivors were still alive.




Speaking with GamesRadar, Bayona discussed reactions Society of the Snow&#39;s real-life survivors had to their story being translated to the big screen. The director indicated the strong reaction from them and their families, saying he believes they were happy with how the movie turned out. Check out what Bayona had to say below:


Five days before the world premiere in Venice, I took a flight to Uruguay and I showed the film to all the survivors, the families of the survivors, and the families of the deceased, all together. We were very scared – not only us, but also them. They hadn&#39;t read a single line of the script, so they didn&#39;t know what to expect from the film. But, ultimately, I think the reaction was very positive. And I was very impressed to see people together for the first time in 50 years – suddenly they were there all together watching the film and hugging each other and crying. I was relieved, but the ones for sure who were more relieved were the survivors. I think they genuinely were very happy with the film.






 How Society Of The Snow Captures The Real-World Event 
          

The approval of the film by the real-world survivors indicates how well Bayona was able to depict the harrowing attributes of the disaster. While the focus of the movie is on the actors dramatizing the event, Society of the Snow features survivor cameos as different characters throughout the film. This indicates how some of them had approved of the movie prior to it being completed, showing how much faith they had in its director.

The film acknowledges the difficult experiences of the survivors by depicting them with an emotionally resonant accuracy. While Society of the Snow changed the true story by adding or omitting details for dramatic effect, the movie was still a mostly accurate depiction of what transpired in the Andes. This includes how survivors resorted to cannibalism, consuming those who died of natural causes after the search was initially called off.




As a result of the heavy themes and subject of the event, Bayona&#39;s film getting a positive reaction from survivors shows just how powerful his depiction was. It also means Society of the Snow can be recognized as one of the latest high-quality survival movies about real-world events. This also reflects the importance of the movie in showcasing the event for audiences who may be unfamiliar with what happened in the Andes in 1972.



Society of the Snow is currently streaming on Netflix.
