# MCU s Original Black Widow Replacement Has Narrowly Missed Out On 3 Marvel Movie Roles


## SUMMARY 



  Saoirse Ronan was considered to play Yelena Belova in Black Widow, but turned down the offer as Marvel &#34;has not been her cup of tea.&#34;   Ronan had previously been considered for the role of Scarlet Witch in Age of Ultron and a young Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse.   If Ronan is still interested in joining the MCU, she could potentially play characters like Jean Grey or Kitty Pryde in the future.

## Literature Review

The actress who was first offered the role of Black Widow&#39;s replacement in the MCU has a history with Marvel, missing out on a total of three roles.




Many actors over the years have auditioned for a role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but haven&#39;t joined for different reasons, and the one who was offered the role of Black Widow’s replacement, Yelena Belova, has already missed out on two other Marvel movie roles. The MCU has grown and expanded so much that it keeps introducing new characters – heroes, allies, and villains –, allowing more actors to join this connected universe. Many actors have even played more than one character in the MCU, while others have auditioned more than once to join this universe but still haven’t done it.




With the original Avengers team no longer active and some of its members dead, the MCU has been replacing these heroes with younger ones, and among them is Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Natasha Romanoff died in Avengers: Endgame in order to get the Soul Stone, but the MCU quickly introduced her replacement in the prequel movie Black Widow. Natasha’s replacement is her “sister” Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh, but Marvel initially had its eyes set on another actress who already had a history with Marvel characters, but still hasn’t joined the MCU.


 Saoirse Ronan Almost Played A Superhero In the MCU And Fox X-Men Movies 
          

According to Deadline senior reporter Justin Kroll (via The Town with Matthew Belloni), Saoirse Ronan was Marvel’s choice to play Yelena Belova in Black Widow. However, Ronan turned down the offer as “Marvel has not been her cup of tea”. Ronan’s comment is not surprising as Yelena Belova hasn’t been the only attempt to have her join the MCU, as she had previously been considered for and even auditioned for other Marvel characters. Back when Avengers: Age of Ultron was in development, Ronan was rumored to be Joss Whedon’s “prototype” for Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, and Ronan told The Mary Sue in 2013 that she would be interested in joining a superhero movie.




Scarlet Witch ended up not being Saoirse Ronan’s MCU debut as the role went to Elizabeth Olsen, and Scarlet Witch became one of the most popular and beloved characters in this connected universe. A couple of years later, when X-Men: Apocalypse was in development, Saoirse Ronan was one of the actresses who auditioned for the role of a young Jean Grey, but Sophie Turner ultimately got the role. It’s not clear why exactly Saoirse Ronan turned down the offer to play Yelena Belova in Black Widow, but she might not have been interested in the character, meaning there could still be some interest in her making a Marvel movie at some point if the role is right.



 Who Saoirse Ronan Could Play In The Future MCU 
          

If Saoirse Ronan is still interested in joining the MCU, there are plenty of characters she could play, more so now that the X-Men are being incorporated. With that in mind, Ronan could have a second chance to play Jean Grey, who seems to be the most fitting character as Ronan is still an appropriate age to play Jean Grey and has the look and the acting credentials to take such a big and complex role. Another option is Kitty Pryde, who was supposed to get a solo film before the Disney/Fox merge. Saoirse Ronan could give new life to Kitty Pryde now as part of the MCU, leading the mutant side of this universe that will need some extra push to succeed.
