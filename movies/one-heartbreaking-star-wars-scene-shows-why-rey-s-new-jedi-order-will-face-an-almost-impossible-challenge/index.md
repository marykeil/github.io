## Literature Review

One scene from the Star Wars book The Princess and the Scoundrel shows a broken galaxy, indicating the challenges Rey&#39;s new Jedi Order will face. 




In the upcoming Star Wars movie, tentatively titled Star Wars: New Jedi Order, Rey faces a daunting task: rebuilding the Jedi after the galaxy has been subjected to so much war, dissolution, and lack of faith in the Jedi. Throughout the Skywalker Saga, the galaxy is plagued with war after war, each trilogy bringing its own armies and schisms. From the prequel trilogy to the sequel trilogy, the Jedi went from peacekeepers known throughout the galaxy to mere myth; between Return of the Jedi and The Force Awakens, even Luke Skywalker faded to memory. Upon meeting Han Solo, Rey has to ask whether the stories—only 30 years on—are true.




Each era of Star Wars has been defined by war, and the Jedi have always had a part to play in that. Even the golden age of the Jedi during the High Republic era, the setting for Star Wars&#39; upcoming TV show The Acolyte, turned sour due to the threat of the terrifying Nihil and the Nameless. This isn&#39;t necessarily the Jedi&#39;s fault, however; the galaxy deals its own blows. One Star Wars story reveals the truth about this galaxy and its vicious cycles, and it makes Rey&#39;s new task in New Jedi Order seem almost impossible to overcome.

 One Heartbreaking Image Shows How The Star Wars Galaxy Has Been Broken 
         




One image from Beth Revis&#39; book The Princess and the Scoundrel demonstrates why establishing a new Jedi Order in this galaxy will be an uphill battle. In the book, Princess Leia becomes enthralled by a painting titled &#34;The Broken Galaxy,&#34; which represents the entire galaxy with expanding circles forming a sort of star map. Although beautiful, the painting symbolizes much more. The artist includes a black metal pendulum, meant to strike and damage the painting. Leia&#39;s commentary on this choice eerily reflects the history of the Star Wars galaxy: &#34;It doesn&#39;t have to be broken. All you have to do is not smash the pendulum into it.&#34;

The metaphorical pendulum is one that has afflicted the Star Wars franchise since its inception in A New Hope. In fact, the Skywalker Saga seems to be one defined by war and oppressive regimes. In the prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace culminates in the Battle of Naboo, and that initiation into the trilogy only evolves into more war and violence; in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, the Clone Wars begin, and they continue into Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, only to conclude with the fall of the Jedi and the creation of the Galactic Empire, arguably the most oppressive government in the whole franchise.






The Skywalker Saga, defined by war and oppressive regimes, is a metaphorical pendulum that has afflicted the Star Wars franchise since its inception in A New Hope.




While the original Star Wars trilogy brings the end of the Empire and optimism for the future of the galaxy under the New Republic, by the beginning of the sequel trilogy with The Force Awakens, the galaxy has once again been subjected to a violent evil rising up, this time the First Order, which certainly seems to draw much of its inspiration from the Empire that had reigned only a few decades before. By the conclusion of The Rise of Skywalker, this evil, too, has been defeated. Still, this violent, ever-changing history that seems to constantly circle back to corrupt regimes doesn&#39;t exactly suggest that this peace will last.

As Leia so poignantly says in The Princess and the Scoundrel, the piece of art, like the galaxy, does not have to be broken if those observing it would only stop smashing it. Despite that, the lesson throughout the galaxy seems to never be learned, perhaps by either side. This ambiguity has grown throughout the years of the franchise, with The Last Jedi revealing that the First Order and the Resistance purchase weapons from the same sources, and, more recently, with the Ahsoka series showing how quickly tensions began within the New Republic, repeating old patterns of not heeding warnings in time.






 Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order Is Dealing With A Broken Galaxy 
          

Although taking place fifteen years after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, in New Jedi Order, the galaxy will presumably still be in a healing process. It&#39;s evident from the very existence of the First Order that pro-Empire sentiments did not die off with Vader or (seemingly, at the time) Palpatine. Instead, Imperial sympathizers returned and succeeded in destroying the Hosnian system, home of the New Republic. Conceivably, the remnants of the First Order will be similar, and, of course, the basic tenet of Star Wars is that there must be balance; with Rey representing the light, dark will rise up to meet it.



Rey&#39;s Jedi Order faces significant loss and the lingering shadow of the First Order. In the delicate balance of Star Wars, as Rey embodies the light, the dark threatens to rise once again.







Even without this inevitable emergence of a new evil, Rey&#39;s Jedi Order must build itself up amid significant loss and devastation. When the Resistance sought help from allies in The Last Jedi, no one came. While a fleet arrives on Exegol in The Rise of Skywalker, that previous lack of support reflects a galaxy that feels little hope. It&#39;s difficult to imagine how, especially with heroes like General Leia Organa now gone, the galaxy will feel inspired to pick up and trust that a period of peace will follow. Even more than that, it&#39;s unclear whether the Jedi will be welcomed back by a galaxy so aware of their failings.

 Can Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order Inspire Hope? 
          




The Jedi were once a symbol of hope—one that, particularly at their height in the prequel trilogy, planets and individuals called upon when they were in need. After the Jedi Order fell in Revenge of the Sith, however, the few remaining Jedi were in hiding, relegated to far corners of the galaxy. Although Luke Skywalker emerged as a Jedi in the original trilogy and even began a new Jedi temple prior to the sequel films, the illustriousness of the Jedi did not reach nearly what it once was. By beginning a Jedi Order of her own, Rey will be challenged to reintroduce the Jedi as a source of hope.

Rey has a real chance to succeed in this capacity. As often as the galaxy has been at war, it has had individuals rising up to fight against evil. This has perhaps been done most prominently by the Jedi and the Skywalker line, but this push for good extends far beyond that. Shows like Andor, Star Wars Rebels, and The Mandalorian show that bravery and hope come in many forms and from many storylines; the galaxy, though currently broken, is not devoid of inspiration and optimism. While the future path for Star Wars remains excitingly unclear, New Jedi Order has an opportunity to restore the Jedi to what they once were.
