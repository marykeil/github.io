# Why Fast &amp; Furious  Paul Walker Turned Down $10m Superman Role


## SUMMARY 



  Paul Walker was offered the role of Superman but turned it down because he didn&#39;t see himself as a good fit.   Money wasn&#39;t a determining factor for Walker, as he preferred a toned-down lifestyle.   Brendan Fraser also auditioned for the role but lost it due to &#34;studio politics,&#34; and had reservations about being defined by the character.

## Literature Review

The reasons why Fast &amp; Furious&#39; Paul Walker rejected a $10m role as Superman were recently revealed in the documentary I Am Paul Walker.




The late Paul Walker, best known for his role as Brian O&#39;Connor in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, could have been Superman, but ultimately turned down the $10m role. In the early 2000s, a pre-DCEU DC was looking to reboot Superman&#39;s live-action career following Christopher Reeves&#39; groundbreaking portrayal in the &#39;80s. This gave way to Superman Returns, which ultimately starred Brandon Routh in the titular role - but Walker was offered the position first.




In I Am Paul Walker, a 2018 documentary that recently aired on CW, Walker&#39;s manager, Matt Luber, revealed (via Deadline) that Walker had told him &#34;I’ve got an ‘S’ on, I got a cape, boots, tights … this is not me. I’m getting the f*** out of here. Gotta go. F*** you.&#34; If Luber&#39;s recollection is accurate, then it&#39;s safe to say that Walker&#39;s rejection was certainly emphatic, but speaks volumes. Turning down a DC movie role that reportedly offered $10 million is evidence enough to suggest that Walker did not see himself as the right fit, which the actor himself elaborated on in an interview years prior.

                  Superman: Legacy: Release Date, Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Superman: Legacy is the first entry in James Gunn&#39;s much anticipated new DCU, and here is everything we know from cast to story and release date.   


 What Paul Walker Said About Playing Superman 
          




Superman Returns was released in 2006, but Walker opened up about turning the role down in an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times way back in 2003. In that interview, Walker clarified that his toned-down lifestyle did not require the vast sums of money being offered, stating:


“You know what? I don’t need it. My favorite brand of running shoes costs $23. I rarely pay more than $40 for my jeans. Throw in a T-shirt and that costs me $20 or $10 if I buy it on the beach. I don’t need a gazillion dollars to manage that kind of lifestyle.&#34;


Evidently, Walker considered himself not to be a good fit, and no amount of money was going to change that outlook. The Man of Steel was eventually played by Brandon Routh, who arguably resembles Christopher Reeves&#39; Superman far more closely, and the movie became a critical success.

Brendan Fraser, meanwhile, is another beloved Hollywood actor who recently commented on reading for the same role after recalling Walker&#39;s involvement. While Fraser was hopeful that he would be offered the opportunity, he commented that &#34;studio politics&#34; had an impact on him losing the role. Ultimately, however, he confessed that he was only 98% sure that he wanted to play Superman, fearful that it would come to define him from that point onward and risk painting him as a &#34;one-trick pony.&#34;
