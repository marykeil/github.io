# It s Time For Star Wars To Explore Leia s Forgotten Legacy - And Redeem Return Of The Jedi s Biggest Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Leia&#39;s iconic slave outfit in Return of the Jedi aged poorly and presented problems with sexism and objectification.   Leia&#39;s legacy as the Huttslayer, who killed Jabba the Hutt and inspired a slave rebellion, could be explored and redeemed in a more empowering way.   By showcasing Leia&#39;s power and impact beyond her appearance, Disney can address past mistakes, empower other characters in the galaxy, and address the issue of slavery in Star Wars more broadly.

## Literature Review

Leia Organa&#39;s infamous Return of the Jedi outfit is nothing short of controversial, but rebranding it as the Huttslayer outfit could empower Leia.




One of the biggest mistakes in Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi was how Leia Organa was depicted as Jabba the Hutt&#39;s slave, but that can be remedied by exploring the legacy she made during her captivity. While trying to rescue Han Solo from Jabba&#39;s palace, Leia was captured and forced to wear a revealing metal bikini. The outfit became iconic in pop culture, often referred to as the &#34;slave Leia&#34; outfit. Though it was iconic, it aged poorly, and thus became infamous.




Leia&#39;s outfit in the scene has obvious problems with sexism and objectification, as it turns the leader of the Rebel Alliance into an object of Jabba&#39;s affection for the duration of the scene. In addition to the problems it presented to the narrative, it also had real world effects. Carrie Fisher thought it was a joke initially and found it extremely uncomfortable. In 2015, she also told Daisy Ridley &#34;don&#39;t be a slave like I was.&#34; Though Fisher grew to see the outfit in a more powerful light, it still stands as an offensive low point in the movie. Star Wars could follow Fisher&#39;s example, though, and redeem the moment as empowering rather than objectifying.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Star Wars Has Set Up A Redemption For Slave Leia 
          




In Claudia Gray&#39;s book Star Wars: Bloodline, she uses the term &#34;Huttslayer&#34; to refer to the outfit. Originally coined by a fan, the term references an important point that paints Leia&#39;s time as a slave in a different light. Leia killed Jabba with the very chains she was imprisoned with, and word of that spread across the galaxy. Leia&#39;s feat was impressive, as killing a Hutt was a dangerous act, given the gang&#39;s power over the Outer Rim. As more people heard of Jabba&#39;s death, the Huttslayer began to inspire a slave rebellion. The galaxy did not remember Leia as a sexual object, it remembered her as the woman who killed Jabba the Hutt with her own hands and started the ball rolling towards freedom.

While Bloodline established that Leia inspired the slave rebellion, there is still room to explore exactly how it all went down and what kind of effects it had on the galaxy. Her Huttslayer title was only briefly mentioned in the book, and it deserves a more prominent role in Star Wars. This would not only rectify the mistake, but it would also be an interesting story to tell, as it would give Leia an even more impactful and powerful legacy within the Star Wars galaxy.






 Star Wars Can Give Leia A New Legacy - As The Huttslayer 
         

Disney has begun to leave the Huttslayer outfit in the past entirely, having discontinued all merchandise with the outfit. However, they could do something better. By bringing the story of the slave rebellion Leia inspired into the mainstream, they could transform a dark mark on Return of the Jedi from sexist and objectifying to feminist and empowering. They could show that Leia was more than her body or her outfit, and that even when she was being objectified, she was still powerful.



Disney discontinued Huttslayer merchandise in 2015, but Fisher voiced her opposition to the decision.




While Leia was a strong person, she was also a strong symbol. A story about the slave rebellion she inspired could showcase how much she meant to the entire galaxy. When Leia killed Jabba, she proved that even at the lowest point, people could still fight back against injustice. Anyone who can inspire something as monumental as Leia did is extremely powerful, no matter what outfit they wear. Beyond Leia&#39;s story, showing the effects Jabba&#39;s death had on the galaxy would be a very interesting and rich story to tell.




Empowering Leia in this way would also empower other people in the galaxy and address slavery in Star Wars more broadly. Slaves already exist in the franchise, and the Jedi rarely did anything about it. It would be better to address the issue and show how the practice of slavery ended in the galaxy in a way that prioritizes the enslaved people rather than avoiding it entirely. Disney should point out the mistakes made in the past and boldly show they won&#39;t repeat them.

The original trilogy is a beloved and amazing series of movies, but the Huttslayer outfit used to be one of its biggest problems. Disney has a prime opportunity to change the narrative and do right by Leia. Putting the slave rebellion into a mainstream story would solidify Leia&#39;s legacy as a powerful woman and address the mistakes made in Return of the Jedi without hiding them away.
