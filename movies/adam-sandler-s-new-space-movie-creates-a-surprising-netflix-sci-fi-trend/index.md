# Adam Sandler s New Space Movie Creates A Surprising Netflix Sci-Fi Trend


## SUMMARY 



  Adam Sandler takes on a sci-fi role in Netflix&#39;s &#34;Spaceman,&#34; adding to the streaming platform&#39;s focus on the genre.   Sandler&#39;s character is prominent in the film, floating in space with a spider-like being on his ship.   Despite the mixed reception of Zack Snyder&#39;s &#34;Rebel Moon,&#34; Netflix is heavily promoting both &#34;Spaceman&#34; and &#34;Rebel Moon: Part Two&#34; as part of their sci-fi space movie lineup in 2024.

## Literature Review

Adam Sandler stars in a space film premiering on Netflix in 2024, but it&#39;s not the only movie of its kind to hit the streaming service this year.




Adam Sandler is diving deep into the science fiction genre in his upcoming Netflix film Spaceman, continuing a recent trend for the streaming platform. The 2024 sci-fi drama film stars Sandler as Jakub Procházka, an astronaut with a very lonesome mission who comes across a spider-like being on his ship who tries to help Jakub with his problems. Sandler is known for his comedic roles, so it will be intriguing to see if his talent translates to the sci-fi genre, a facet of movies that Netflix has been heavily leaning into as of late.




Aside from Sandler, the Spaceman cast includes Paul Dano as the voice of Hanuš, Carey Mulligan as Lenka Procházka, Kunal Nayyar as Peter, Isabella Rossellini as Commissioner Tuma, and Lena Olin. Although the sci-fi drama&#39;s cast is stacked with big names, Sandler&#39;s character is seemingly the film&#39;s most prominent one, given that it is just him (and Dano&#39;s extraterrestrial spider) floating around in space (but it likely won&#39;t reach the same solitary vibe as Sandra Bullock&#39;s Gravity). Ultimately, Sandler&#39;s 2024 space movie has potential, based on the talented cast and the intriguing trailer, but it&#39;s an indication of a bigger Netflix fad.


 Adam Sandler&#39;s Spaceman Movie Is Continuing Netflix&#39;s Sci-Fi Space Focus After Rebel Moon 
          

Following the premiere of Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire in late December 2023, Netflix appears to be putting many of its eggs in one basket, with that basket being the science fiction space genre. Rebel Moon received negative reviews and did not perform as well as many expected, given the hype surrounding the film. Nevertheless, what is done is done, and more sci-fi space movies are coming to the streaming service in 2024. Hopefully, they will do better than the first part of Snyder&#39;s epic space opera.




Adam Sandler&#39;s Spaceman and Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver are two space films coming to Netflix in 2024, and the streaming platform is undoubtedly banking on their success by heavily promoting both movies. Of course, Rebel Moon has been a significant project for Netflix, and the company has poured a lot of time and energy into it. Even after the first part&#39;s relatively disappointing release, the second half (and Snyder&#39;s impending director&#39;s cut) could redeem the franchise. As for Spaceman, the drama has a strong cast and story, and if it succeeds, Netflix may continue making more sci-fi space movies.

                  Adam Sandler&#39;s Next Movie Pays Off A 14-Year-Old Joke   Adam Sandler&#39;s next movie sees him play an astronaut for Netflix, and the role actually pays off a 14-year-old joke from one of his previous films.   



 2024 Is Already A Big Year For Sci-Fi Space Projects 
         




Outside the upcoming Netflix science fiction space movies, Spaceman and Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, 2024 is shaping up to be a big year for the sci-fi space genre. Apple TV&#43;&#39;s For All Mankind finished airing its fourth season in January; I.S.S., a movie about astronauts living on the International Space Station, premieres on January 19; Dune: Part Two is coming in March; Bong Joon-ho&#39;s Mickey 17 is expected to release in 2024; and Alien: Romulus is set for an August premiere. Ultimately, Netflix isn&#39;t the only one following the sci-fi space trend.



Spaceman, starring Adam Sandler, premieres on March 1, 2024, on Netflix.
