# Star Wars Actress Replaces Gal Gadot As Wonder Woman In Stunning DCU Fan Concept Art


## SUMMARY 



  Adria Arjona in Wonder Woman concept art sports a similar suit to Gal Gadot&#39;s, with added white stars on the skirt, reminiscent of Lynda Carter&#39;s version.   Arjona looks stunning in the role and deserves a big opportunity like Wonder Woman, especially after her previous superhero film, Morbius, was not the best.   The new DC Universe is taking a different approach with Wonder Woman, with a prequel series called Paradise Lost set to explore Themyscira and the Amazons&#39; history, setting up Diana Prince&#39;s debut.

## Literature Review

With James Gunn&#39;s DCU reportedly recasting the Justice League cast, a detailed fan concept art makes the case for a Star Wars actress as Wonder Woman.




Adria Arjona becomes the Wonder Woman of James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe in new, exciting fan concept art. Arjona became famous worldwide for playing the resourceful Bix Caleen in Andor. Following the cancellation of Gal Gadot&#39;s Wonder Woman 3, the character&#39;s DCU future has yet to be revealed. According to reports, the entire cast of the DCEU&#39;s Justice League is out for the new DCU, which means a Wonder Woman recast should be on the way.




On Twitter, artist @21xfour shared a great peek at what Arjona&#39;s Wonder Woman could look like in the new DCU through detailed concept art.


 

The art gives Arjona a very similar Wonder Woman suit to Gadot&#39;s, with the key difference being the addition of white stars on the hero&#39;s skirt, which is a clear nod to Lynda Carter&#39;s Wonder Woman suit and the comics. Arjona looks great in the role, and given how her only superhero experience has been in the failure that was Morbius, the Star Wars actress deserves a role as big as Wonder Woman in DC&#39;s future movies.

                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.   





 How The DCU&#39;s Wonder Woman Will Be Different To The DCEU 
A Wonder Woman-  Project Has Been Announced
          

The new DC Universe is already addressing Wonder Woman in a different manner from what was done in the DCEU. Gunn&#39;s DCU has yet to announce a Wonder Woman movie or another project for whoever gets cast as Diana Prince to debut. However, that does not mean that the setup for Wonder Woman&#39;s introduction is not underway.

During the January 2023 reveal of the first few projects of the DCU&#39;s Chapter One, Gunn announced that a Wonder Woman-related series, Paradise Lost, would come to Max. While Wonder Woman will not appear in the series, Paradise Lost will set the stage for Diana&#39;s DCU debut by telling the story behind the character, with the show focusing on Themyscira and the Amazons hundreds of years before Wonder Woman was born. That could lead to a major change between the DCU&#39;s version of Wonder Woman and Gal Gadot&#39;s from the DCEU.




The DCEU hardly used Themyscira and some of the famous Amazons from DC Comics beyond a few scenes here and there. With so much rich history to explore, the DCU already seems like it wants to properly build a Wonder Woman corner where both Diana Prince and her supporting cast from the comics can shine. By focusing on the history behind the character, the new DCU could also finally put Wonder Woman&#39;s connection to the Greek Gods in the spotlight, as it was another factor of the hero that was barely explored by the DCEU. As a fan favorite, perhaps Arjona could play Wonder Woman and explore that DCU story.
