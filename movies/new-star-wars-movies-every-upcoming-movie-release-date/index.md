## Literature Review

Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!




The Skywalker saga has come to an end, but there are still a lot more Star Wars movies on the way. Lucasfilm officially began announcing upcoming movies at Star Wars Celebration 2023, signaling that Star Wars is returning to the big screens soon. Development was postponed due to the writers&#39; and actors&#39; strikes, but Lucasfilm has nonetheless recently confirmed that these projects are still in the works.
Lucasfilm has currently booked three release dates:
May 22, 2026 
December 18, 2026 
December 17, 2027 

It is currently unclear which movie is attached to which date, and it is further unknown whether the studio is planning to push any projects back due to the strikes. With these provisos, then, here is every upcoming Lucasfilm theatrical project for the next decade.
            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.












 








 The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu 
Din Djarin &amp; Grogu head to the big screen
        

  Writer   Unconfirmed, presumably Jon Favreau    Director   Jon Favreau    Known cast   Daisy Ridley (Rey)    
Lucasfilm has confirmed The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be the first of this new wave of Star Wars movies. Little is known about The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu at this stage, but it&#39;s reasonable to assume it has been adapted from Jon Favreau&#39;s scripts for The Mandalorian season 4. It&#39;s reasonable to assume Lucasfilm hope this will make the May 2026 date, although this has not been confirmed.

 Rey Skywalker&#39;s New Jedi Order Movie 
Daisy Ridley&#39;s Star Wars return


 







  Writer   Steven Knight    Director   Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy    Known cast   Daisy Ridley (Rey)    
One of the three major announcements at Star Wars Celebration 2023 centered around the return of Daisy Ridley&#39;s Rey to the Star Wars universe. The central Jedi of the sequel trilogy era, Rey will now serve as the founder of the New Jedi Order in a movie set 15 years after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, and written by Steven Knight, this untitled movie will introduce a whole new part of the Star Wars timeline - the so-called &#34;New Jedi Order.&#34;

 Dave Filoni&#39;s The Mandalorian Movie 
Spinning out of The Mandalorian &amp; Ahsoka


 







  Cast   None confirmed, but presumably include Pedro Pascal (Din Djarin), Rosario Dawson (Ahsoka Tano), and supporting cast from The Mandalorian and Ahsoka    
Lucasfilm&#39;s Dave Filoni is rising through the ranks, recently promoted to Chief Creative Officer. George Lucas&#39; protégé, Filoni has worked closely with Jon Favreau on The Mandalorian and Ahsoka. This will build up to a movie set during The Mandalorian era, one featuring Grand Admiral Thrawn as the main villain - although Filoni has promised it&#39;s not just a replay of the traditional New Republic versus Empire dynamic.

 James Mangold&#39;s Dawn Of The Jedi Movie 
The origin of the Force revealed
        

  Writer &amp; director   James Mangold    
Finally, the last movie announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023 will be set over 25,000 years before the Skywalker Saga. Written and directed by James Mangold, this is set in what has been called the &#34;Dawn of the Jedi&#34; era - although it does not necessarily feature any Jedi. According to Mangold, this will be &#34;a kind of origin story of how the Force came to be known.” Mangold clearly built a strong relationship with during his work on Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and he pitched this project directly. It has been described as a &#34;biblical epic&#34; akin to The Ten Commandments.

 Lando 


 







  Writers   Donald &amp; Stephen Glover    Known cast   Donald Glover (Lando)    
Originally conceived as a Disney&#43; TV show, Lucasfilm confirmed that Lando is shifting to a feature film format. Haunted Mansion&#39;s Justin Simien was initially tapped to write and oversee the project, but was replaced by Donald and Stephen Glover shortly before the WGA strike. Withe Donald Glover reprising his role of Lando Calrissian and the brothers overseeing the film&#39;s development, consistency with the character&#39;s portrayal in Solo: A Star Wars Story can be expected. No release date for Lando has been set, but writing will commence after the Hollywood strikes conclude.

 Shawn Levy&#39;s Star Wars Movie 
        

  Writer &amp; director   Shawn Levy    
Writer/director Shawn Levy confirmed he was tapped by Lucasfilm to helm an untitled Star Wars movie. After word was first broken by the trades, Levy shared on social media that the film is a dream project. The film is set to begin production once Levy&#39;s work on Deadpool 3 has concluded, though the Hollywood strikes have complicated matters. Providing an update on the film, Levy stated that his Star Wars project is stuck in a &#34;holding patternI&#34; like much of the industry, and he had only just begun development before the strikes. With substantial work still to be done, Levy&#39;s Star Wars movie is several years out from release.

 Rian Johnson&#39;s Star Wars Trilogy 
        

  Writer &amp; director   Rian Johnson    
Lucasfilm was clearly impressed by Rian Johnson&#39;s work on Star Wars: The Last Jedi. In November 2017, they announced Johnson would launch a new Star Wars trilogy outside the Skywalker saga. Remarkably, Johnson&#39;s pitch didn&#39;t even include a story; he&#39;s still in the early stages of drafting a story, so there isn&#39;t much news about this trilogy yet. Given the divisiveness of The Last Jedi, though, it was rumored that Johnson&#39;s Star Wars trilogy had been canceled, but the writer-director stepped in to debunk those rumors on social media.
In the years since Johnson&#39;s trilogy was announced, both the director and Kathleen Kennedy have addressed whether the films will still be made. As late as Star Wars Celebration 2023, Kennedy was once again asked about the status of Johnson&#39;s trilogy by Variety. The Lucasfilm President reiterated much that has already been said of the films since their announcement: that Johnson is incredibly busy with Netflix making a third Knives Out movie, though both Lucasfilm and Johnson remain eager to work together again in the future. This means that Johnson&#39;s trilogy is still on the table, though likely will not enter active development until the filmmaker&#39;s other commitments are fulfilled.





 Taika Waititi&#39;s Star Wars Movie 
        

  Writers   Taika Waititi &amp; Krysty Wilson-Cairns         
In May 2020, Lucasfilm announced that Thor: Ragnarok and Jojo Rabbit director Taika Waititi is set to helm a future Star Wars movie. Waititi will direct and co-write the project with Oscar nominee Krysty Wilson-Cairns. In December 2020, during Disney&#39;s Investor Day presentation, it was confirmed that Waititi and Wilson-Cairns had begun work on the film&#39;s script and an art concept showcased a diamond-like object in space. Waititi has given occasional updates, most recently stressing that he wants to recapture the joy and wonder of Star Wars, which means this is a high-pressure job that is taking some time.

 Canceled Star Wars Movies 

        

There have been many false starts for Lucasfilm over the years, including a range of Star Wars anthology films that were passed on after Solo: A Star Wars Story - some of which were changed into Disney&#43; TV shows. Boba Fett originally had Josh Trank as director back in 2014, but he left the project around the release of Fantastic Four. Director James Mangold - recently announced as the director for Star Wars&#39; Dawn of the Jedi film - reportedly stepped in after Trank&#39;s exit, but development was stopped a few months later in favor of what became The Book of Boba Fett, released in 2021.
Similarly, in February 2018, Lucasfilm announced that Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss were developing a new Star Wars movie series. However, the duo left the project in October 2019, for unclear reasons. Many rumors circulated that the poorly-written culmination of Game of Thrones was to blame for Benioff and Weiss&#39; project not taking off, with the filmmakers largely disappearing from pop culture since the show&#39;s less-than-satisfying ending.
In April 2023, both Patty Jenkins&#39; Rogue Squadron and a mysterious film by Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige were shelved. Feige&#39;s film and Jenkins&#39; Rogue Squadron were announced in 2019 and 2020 respectively, with both undergoing slow pre-production processes. This time round, the cancelations seem to have been related to Lucasfilm&#39;s recent change in direction.





 Upcoming Star Wars TV Shows
