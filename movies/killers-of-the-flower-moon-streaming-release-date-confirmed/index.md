## Literature Review

After spending time in theaters and being available for rental on PVOD, Killers of the Flower Moonâ€™s streaming release date has now been revealed.




Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s streaming release date has now been confirmed. Hitting theaters last October, Martin Scorsese&#39;s latest film, which is based on real events, serves as an adaptation of David Grann&#39;s best-selling book of the same name. The Killers of the Flower Moon cast features Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone in a story that chronicles the Osage Nation murders that took place in the 1920s after the discovery of oil on their land in Oklahoma.




Now, after becoming available for rental on PVOD platforms in December, IndieWire reveals that Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s streaming release date is set for January 12. As an Apple Original film, the project will be available to stream only on Apple TV Plus.

Should The Martin Scorsese Movie Be Considered a Flop?
          

Scorsese&#39;s new epic premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in May of last year, with the Killers of the Flower Moon reviews praising the film as one of the director&#39;s best. The project was hailed as a &#34;masterpiece,&#34; boasting career-best performances from DiCaprio, De Niro, and Gladstone, and a powerful, harrowing story. The film then got a wide theatrical release on October 20, 2023.




During its theatrical run, Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s box office managed to just sneak past $156 million worldwide, comprising $67.3 million domestic and $89 million internationally. Considering the film&#39;s massive budget of $200 million (which doesn&#39;t include marketing costs), it is most certainly losing tens of millions for Apple and is a financial disappointment. That being said, the movie was a strong performer on PVOD, beating Oppenheimer to occupy the #1 spot upon its digital release in early December.

Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s financial underperformance also may not matter much in the grand scheme of things, and it was clearly more of an awards play for Apple anyway, in addition to serving as an attempt to attract subscribers to Apple TV Plus. Apple is perhaps the last company willing to shell out hundreds of millions for a prestige picture with questionable box office prospects from one of cinema&#39;s greatest living legends, making the movie itself a win.
