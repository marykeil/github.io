# 10 Songs That Have Become Synonymous With Specific Movies


## SUMMARY 


 Songs in movies can create strong associations and bring forth images from the film they were featured in. 
 Songs used in movies are different from scores, which are orchestral arrangements composed specifically for the film. 
 Some songs, like &#34;All Star,&#34; &#34;You&#39;ve Lost That Lovin&#39; Feelin&#39;,&#34; and &#34;Hooked On A Feeling,&#34; are strongly associated with the movies they were featured in and have benefited both the film and the artist who performed the song.

## Literature Review

A certain song can define how memorable a movie is, and the two can become so intertwined that one always sparks memories of the other.




A song can mark a memorable moment in a movie, and the right music can cause an irreversible connection between the two. A song can earn its association with a movie for various reasons. For example, it could add atmosphere to a montage or fight sequence, but sometimes a piece can be performed by the characters themselves. Regardless of how the song works its way into the fabric of a film, hearing it can often bring forth images from the movie in which it was featured. There are even movies where the soundtrack is the best part of the production.
Songs used in movies are not the same thing as a score, which is bespoke and often orchestral arrangements that have been composed to augment large portions of the film in question. It&#39;s not unheard of for a song to be written to be used in a specific movie. However, many of the best cinematic moments involve a song that pre-dates the movie in which it appears.
            
 
 10 Movies That Feature Music Exclusively From One Popular Band/Musician 
Whether it&#39;s songs made exclusively for the film or directors having access to whole back catalogs, popular bands&#39; music have defined some moviess.












 








 10  &#34;All Star&#34; By Smash Mouth 
Shrek (2001)
        

  Shrek  


  Release Date    May 18, 2001     Director    Vicky Jenson , Andrew Adamson     Cast    Cameron Diaz , Mike Myers , Eddie Murphy , John Lithgow     Genres    Animation , Adventure , Fantasy , Comedy , Family    


A fresh take on the fairytale genre, Shrek opens up with a bait-and-switch from dreamy strings to late-90s pop-rock. &#34;All Star&#34; sets the backdrop for Shrek&#39;s morning routine of bathing in mud and brushing his teeth with similarly vile substances. The tone and lyrical content of the song suit the scene well, unintentionally chronicling how content the title character is with being alone.
Smash Mouth released &#34;All Star&#34; in 1999. So, given the length of time it takes to make CGI movies like Shrek, the movie was likely in production long before then. The inclusion of the song benefited not only the movie, but also Smash Mouth&#39;s career. As a result, &#34;All Star&#34; isn&#39;t just strongly associated with Shrek, but rather the band as a whole. Part of the reason for this was the movie&#39;s huge success, along with the fact that Smash Mouthalso contributed a cover of The Monkees&#39; &#34;I&#39;m a Believer&#34; for the movie&#39;s closing sequence.





 9  &#34;You&#39;ve Lost That Lovin&#39; Feelin&#39;&#34; By The Righteous Brothers 
Top Gun (1986)
        

  Top Gun  


  Release Date    May 16, 1986     Director    Tony Scott     Cast    Tom Cruise , Kelly McGillis , Val Kilmer , Anthony Edwards , Tom Skerritt     Genres    Drama , Action    


&#34;You&#39;ve Lost That Lovin&#39; Feelin&#39;&#34; didn&#39;t need a single note of the original recording in order to play a part in one of cinema&#39;s most iconic musical moments. Instead, Tom Cruise&#39;s a cappella performance as Maverick for Kelly McGillis&#39; Charlotte Blackwood takes center stage. The Top Gun scene hits its crescendo as the rest of the bar&#39;s partons lend their voices to the rendition. Maverick&#39;s ploy is successful, and Charlotte asks him to sit with her following the display.
&#34;Danger Zone&#34; is another song that has become strongly associated with Top Gun. 






 8  &#34;Hooked On A Feeling&#34; By Blue Swede 
Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)


 







  Guardians of the Galaxy  


  Release Date    July 30, 2014     Director    James Gunn     Cast    Zoe Saldana , Karen Gillan , Vin Diesel , Michael Rooker , Djimon Hounsou , Lee Pace , Benicio Del Toro , Glenn   , Dave Bautista , ​Chris Pratt2 , Bradley Cooper , John C. Reilly    


Blue Swede&#39;s 1974 hit is used in James Gunn&#39;s first MCU movie, and the upbeat feel of the track juxtaposes the misery of Peter Quill and his fellow Guardians as they&#39;re processed by Nova Corps prison guards. Guardians has a carefully curated soundtrack that also serves as Quill&#39;s mixtape that he received from his mother as a child. &#34;Hooked on a Feeling&#34; is one of the more memorable songs to feature in the movie, but not just because of its placement. The energetic chanting in the song&#39;s introduction makes it stand out from the crowd too.
&#34;Hooked on a Feeling&#34; is a cover of a 1968 song by B.J. Thomas. 

            
 
 The 10 Best Movie Soundtracks of All-Time, Ranked 
Awesome movie soundtracks can turn a good movie like Guardians Of The Galaxy or Star Wars into iconic ones. Here&#39;s a ranking of the ten best ever.








 7  &#34;Send Me On My Way&#34; By Rusted Roots 
Matilda (1996)
        

  Matilda  


  Release Date    June 28, 1996     Director    Danny DeVito     Cast    Danny DeVito , Mara Wilson , Pam Ferris     Genres    Family , Comedy    


Considering how short and simple the pancake scene is in Matilda, it stands above the rest as one of the most iconic parts of the movie. This could arguably be due to Matilda&#39;s culinary prowess being accompanied by Rusted Roots&#39; &#34;Send Me on My Way.&#34; Its repetitive lyrical content and the unorthodox vocal style of Michael Glabicki make the song a difficult one to forget, and the memorable image of freshly made pancakes has locked the piece into the minds of many.
&#34;Send Me On My Way&#34; was also used in 2002&#39;s Ice Age, a movie with which the song is also commonly associated. 






 6  &#34;Afternoon Delight&#34; By Starlight Vocal Band 
Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy (2004)
        

  Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  


  Release Date    July 9, 2004     Director    Adam McKay     Cast    Will Ferrell , Christina Applegate , Paul Rudd , Steve Carell , David Koechner , Fred Willard     Genres    Comedy    


When Ron Burgundy&#39;s news team asked him what love is in this 2004 cult classic, they were obviously aware of the possibility of him giving his answer in the form of a song. The rest of the Anchorman stars quickly join in with Ron to create a four-part harmony, impressively performing an a cappella version of Starlight Vocal Band&#39;s, &#34;Afternoon Delight.&#34; The numerous deceptions regarding when the performance is over keep the audience on its toes as well as adding to the comedy of the scene. Starlight Vocal Band may have performed the original, but Will Ferrell and company make the song their own in the scene.
Will Ferrell often does his own singing in movies, including an operatic rendition of Andrea Bocceli&#39;s &#34;Por Ti Volaré&#34; in 2008&#39;s Step Brothers. 






 5  &#34;Eye Of The Tiger&#34; By Survivor 
Rocky III (1982)
        

The go-to song for a training montage tends to be Survivor&#39;s &#34;Eye of the Tiger&#34; due to its hugely influential use during Rocky III. The piece was written to be the theme song of the 1982 Sylvester Stallone movie, and the synergy between both parties helped elevate their respective levels of success. The song is very relevant to what&#39;s happening on screen, but that makes sense when it&#39;s considered why it was created in the first place.





 4  &#34;Unchained Melody&#34; By The Righteous Brothers 
Ghost (1990)
        

Mentioning the movie Ghost brings to mind the same scene for many, and part of the reason is the perfection of the song that was chosen to play alongside it. Although &#34;Unchained Melody&#34; is actually playing within the world of the movie, it eventually transitions into being the soundtrack for the famous love scene between Patrick Swayze&#39;s Sam Wheat and Demi Moore&#39;s Molly Jenson.





 3  &#34;Sunflower&#34; By Post Malone And Swae Lee 
Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)


 







A movie character singing along to a song is bound to draw attention to the piece, which is what happens in Into the Spider-Verse. Miles Morales, voiced by Shameik Moore, is shown trying his best to rap along to &#34;Sunflower,&#34; but not quite being able to get the words right. The relatable performance of &#34;Sunflower&#34; helps solidify the song&#39;s presence in the world of the show, with the Post Malone and Swae Lee effort perfectly fitting the vibe of the movie.





 2  &#34;Stuck In The Middle With You&#34; By Stealers Wheel 
Reservoir Dogs (1992)
        

  Reservoir Dogs  


  Release Date    October 9, 1992     Director    Quentin Tarantino     Cast    Quentin Tarantino , Tim Roth , Michael Madsen , Harvey Keitel , Steve Buscemi , Chris Penn     Genres    Crime , Thriller    


A torture scene can be a difficult thing to forget, which is especially true when it&#39;s paired with an inappropriately joyous 1972 pop song. This was what Quentin Tarantino did in his debut as a professional director, which created an immovable link between Reservoir Dogs and the Steelers Wheel hit. Tarantino has always had a unique approach to film music, opting to soundtrack his films with songs rather than a traditional score. The use of this technique in Reservoir Dogs contributed to his impressive streak of success and was one of the best uses of music in a Tarantino movie.

 1  &#34;You&#39;ve Got A Friend In Me&#34; By Randy Newman 
Toy Story (1995)


 







  Toy Story  


  Release Date    November 22, 1995     Director    John Lasseter     Cast    Tom Hanks , Don Rickles , Annie Potts , Tim Allen , Jim Varney     Main Genre    Animation    


Randy Newman&#39;s musical footprint was instrumental in establishing the success of this Pixar franchise. The veteran musician was not only responsible for writing the movie&#39;s orchestral scores, but also for every song that appears in Toy Story. Of these pieces, the very first to rear its head is the most memorable. &#34;You&#39;ve Got a Friend In Me&#34; has become a companionship anthem, inspired by the platonic love that exists between Andy and Woody. This piece of music sets the tone for the movie&#39;s opening sequence, as well as becoming forever associated with not just the film, but the Toy Story franchise at large.
