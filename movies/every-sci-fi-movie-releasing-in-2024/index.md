## Literature Review

2024 has the chance to be one of the greatest years for sci-fi movies ever, with exciting originals and a number of huge franchise releases.




Sci-fi movies make up one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest markets, and there are lots of exciting releases to look forward to in 2024. The best sci-fi movies allow viewers to explore vast and imaginative worlds, providing a sense of escapism. 2023 saw a number of successful sci-fi movies debut, from franchise installments like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to the original film The Creator. 2024 will have an upward trend for the genre, with far more releases slated.
2024 will see book adaptations, video game adaptations, original sci-fi films, and the return of major franchises like Alien, Planet of the Apes, Godzilla, and Mad Max. These movies are set to be directed by some of the best talent in the film industry, including Bong Joon-ho and Denis Villeneuve. Due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, many films have seen delayed release dates. While hopefully many of 2024&#39;s films are set now, it&#39;s still possible they could be pushed back again. If all goes as planned, 2024&#39;s sci-fi lineup could make it one of the best years ever for sci-fi films.

Dune: Part Two is one of the most-anticipated sci-fi movies of 2024, especially after its delay from its original November 2023 release date. Directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring an ensemble cast headlined by Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler, and Rebecca Ferguson, Dune has the chance to be one of the biggest films of the year.

 South Korean director Bong Joon-ho received international acclaim for Parasite, building great anticipation for his upcoming sci-fi movie, Mickey 17. The film is set to star Robert Pattinson, Toni Collette, and Steven Yeun. Mickey 17 is one of the few sci-fi movies releasing in 2024 that isn&#39;t connected to a larger franchise. The story follows a disposable human employee named Mickey, who is sent to colonize the ice world Niflheim. Mickey can be regenerated every time he dies, making him the perfect candidate for such a dangerous mission — though it may not go as smoothly as expected.

Reboots aren&#39;t often met with praise, making Ghostbusters: Afterlife&#39;s success a huge accomplishment. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is in the works, with Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Finn Wolfhard set to reprise their roles. The film was delayed from its original December 2023 release date due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, which will likely ramp up anticipation further when it does debut.

  Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  


  Release Date    March 29, 2024     Director    Adam Wingard     Cast    Dan Stevens , Rebecca Hall , Brian Tyree Henry , Kaylee Hottle , Fala Chen     Genres    Action , Adventure    


 Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will be the fifth movie in the MonsterVerse and a sequel to 2021&#39;s Godzilla vs Kong. For fans of giant monster action movies, the film is set to continue in the franchise&#39;s usual brand of storytelling. Godzilla x Kong was delayed to a new release date in order to avoid competing with Dune and the other blockbusters in March. It will see Brian Tyree Henry and Rebecca Hall reprising their roles from the previous installment. For Godzilla fans, the Japanese film Godzilla Minus One will also release on December 1, 2023.

Zack Snyder has become one of the most popular directors in Hollywood in recent years. Rebel Moon Part 1 was released on Netflix on December 22, 2023, and Part 2 will follow shortly after on April 19, 2024. Snyder&#39;s original science-fiction epic is highly anticipated, promising tons of action and a mature tone.

  Release Date    May 10, 2024     Director    Wes Ball     Cast    Kevin Durand , Freya Allan , Peter Macon , Owen Teague , Eka Darville , Sara Wiseman , Neil Sandilands     Rating    r     Genres    Action ,  Sci-Fi    


 While Tim Burton&#39;s Planet of the Apes reboot was a disaster, the 2010s reboot trilogy was a great success due to the direction of Matt Reeves. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is a follow-up to War for the Planet of the Apes, and it will be the first film of a new trilogy. The movie will star Owen Teague as Cornelius, the son of Caesar, as well as The Witcher star Freya Allan.

 Mad Max: Fury Road was one of the best movies of the 2010s, as well as being a great reboot to George Miller&#39;s classic sci-fi films. The primary difference between Fury Road and most reboots is that Miller himself returned to direct it. He&#39;ll also be directing the prequel film, Furiosa, which will release in 2024. The spinoff will follow Anya Taylor-Joy as Furiosa, the character Charlize Theron portrays in Fury Road, as well as Chris Hemsworth as Fury Road antagonist Immortan Joe.

 A Quiet Place was a massively successful debut for John Krasinski as a writer and director, with both the movie and its sequel being commercial and critical successes. A Quiet Place: Day One is a prequel film led by Michael Sarnoski, who previously directed the film Pig. The prequel is set to star Lupita Nyong&#39;o, Joseph Quinn, and Djimon Hounsou.
