## Literature Review

A new DC Universe report has revealed three candidates to lead Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and one of them has already played Kara Danvers twice.




One of the reported candidates to play the title character of Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow has already given life to Kara Zor-El twice before her possible DC Universe casting. While Sasha Calle played a version of Supergirl in the DCEU&#39;s The Flash, the actress will not return as the character for the new DCU, as a new report shared an exciting casting update for the DCU&#39;s Supergirl. According to Deadline, casting for Supergirl will soon heat up, with the character set to make an appearance in a DCU movie or series before Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.




Before the casting report came up, rumors claimed that James Gunn would cast Supergirl for the DCU in a cameo in Superman: Legacy before her solo movie. The new casting update lines up with that. The report also revealed that screen tests for the DCU&#39;s Supergirl will happen within the next month, with three actresses among the names that will test to play Kara Danvers. House of The Dragon&#39;s Milly Alcock, Coda&#39;s Emilia Jones, and The Winchesters&#39; Meg Donnelly are the three actresses reported to be in the mix for Supergirl, and one of them might be a step ahead of the rest, as she has already played Supergirl twice.

                  Supergirl: Woman Of Tomorrow: Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Along with many other DCU projects, James Gunn announced the exciting Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, shedding light on the franchise&#39;s future.   


 DCU&#39;s Rumored Supergirl Casting Has Already Played Supergirl Twice 
          




Meg Donnelly might be ahead of the pack to play the DCU&#39;s Supergirl due to her history with the character. While the actress has yet to play Kara in live-action, Donnelly is the voice of Supergirl in DC&#39;s animated Tomorrowverse continuity. The actress first voiced Supergirl in 2023&#39;s Legion of Super-Heroes. The movie was Supergirl&#39;s introduction to the Tomorrowverse, with Kara feeling out of place in the present and Darren Criss&#39; Superman taking his cousin to the future, where she would find a home with the Legion of Super-Heroes.


 

Donnelly recently returned as the Tomorrowverse&#39;s Supergirl in Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part One, which was released on January 9. The Justice League film is the first of a three-part finale to the short-lived Tomorrowverse. Donnelly, who also played Harbinger in the Tomorrowverse movie, is expected to return as Supergirl for the announced Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part Two and Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - Part Three, which will tell an epic multiverse story that could set up the new DCU&#39;s animated side through another continuity reset.






 Why Meg Donnelly&#39;s DC Supergirl Experience Makes Her The Perfect Casting Choice 
          

In her live-action role in The Winchesters, Donnelly showed that she has the necessary grit and physical prowess to play Kara in Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow and other DCU projects. Through her time as Supergirl in the Tomorrowverse, Donnelly has confirmed that she has the character perfectly in her hands, delivering a charming, strong, and nuanced version of Supergirl, which is exactly how the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow comic book presented the character. Donnelly&#39;s animated Supergirl carried the same feeling of not belonging anywhere that Kara should have in Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, making her the perfect Supergirl for the new DC Universe.
