# When The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Will Take Place In The Star Wars Timeline


## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be set within the New Republic era, specifically around 10-11 ABY, which is about 22 years before the events of the Star Wars sequel trilogy.   The timeline of the Star Wars universe during the New Republic era is not entirely clear due to the number of projects taking place at the same time, including The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka.   The release dates for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu and Ahsoka season 2 have not been announced yet, and more information about the movie&#39;s timeline is expected to be revealed once production begins later this year.

## Literature Review

The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu begins production later this year. Here&#39;s where the franchise&#39;s next movie will land on the Star Wars timeline.




Star Wars just announced that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be going into production later this year, but where the movie falls on the Star Wars timeline hasn’t been explicitly stated. The entire timeline of the New Republic hasn’t been thoroughly defined like in other eras of Star Wars history, which is likely due to the growing number of projects taking place during this time. Between The Mandalorian Disney&#43; TV show and Ahsoka, which is now officially getting a season 2, there are still a lot of unknowns about when certain events take place.




There is a general idea of what the series of events across the multiple Disney&#43; shows is, including The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. The New Republic era of the Star Wars galaxy takes place after the Battle of Yavin, making all the years end with the abbreviation ABY. Everything that took place before the Battle of Yavin, like the Star Wars prequel movies, are all designated with BBY. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will take place within the New Republic era, but here&#39;s when exactly it will be taking place in that designated timeline.

                  Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie   The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.   


 The Mandalorian Era Starts 5 Years After Return Of The Jedi 
         




The Mandalorian season 1 begins five years after the fall of the Empire at the Battle of Endor. Because the events of Return of the Jedi and the defeat of the Empire took place in 4 ABY, The Mandalorian season 1 takes place in 9 ABY. During this time, the New Republic was still finding its footing and hunting down Imperial remnants. While the Empire had officially surrendered and the war ended at the Battle of Jakku in 5 ABY, there were still high-ranking Imperials on the loose, one of which was the antagonist of all three seasons of The Mandalorian, Moff Gideon.

After The Mandalorian season 1, the timeline gets a little fuzzy. While the series of events stays the same, the time between all of these major events is not entirely clear. Some say that The Mandalorian seasons 1 and 2, as well as The Book of Boba Fett all take place within the same year—9 ABY. However, considering Din Djarin’s bond with Grogu and the time Grogu spent training with Luke Skywalker, it seems more likely that the real timeline would put the events of The Mandalorian season 2 in 10 ABY, and Boba Fett’s takeover of Mos Espa around 11 ABY.






 The Mandalorian Season 3 Confused The Star Wars Timeline 
          

The Mandalorian creator and executive producer Jon Favreau further muddied the waters when it came to the Star Wars timeline. Favreau said that “some time” had passed between The Mandalorian seasons 2 and 3, but never defined how much exactly. This leads some to believe The Mandalorian season 3 took place in 11 ABY, or perhaps even later. It’s also possible that The Mandalorian season 3 overlaps slightly with the beginning of Ahsoka season 1, but that is still unconfirmed as well. Based on what Captain Carson Teva said in Ahsoka season 1, it’s known that Ahsoka takes place after The Mandalorian season 3, but it’s unclear how much time has passed.

With Ahsoka season 2 now being confirmed by Lucasfilm, it’s unclear when it will take place in the Star Wars timeline, and if the events will overlap at all with The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. It’s worth noting that Dave Filoni’s untitled The Mandalorian-era movie is still in the works and will wrap up the stories from The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett. With that movie, it’s likely that much will become much more clear about where they lie in the overall Star Wars timeline.






Premiere dates for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu as well as Ahsoka season 2 have not been released.






 How Much Time Is There Between The Mandalorian Movie And The Sequels? 
          

If The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu takes place around 12 or 13 ABY, then it would be about 22 years before the events of the Star Wars sequel trilogy. The events of all three sequel trilogy movies take place within almost a year. Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi take place in 34 ABY, whereas Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker takes place in 35 ABY. Putting the events of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu about 20 years before the events of the sequels is smart, as it fully separates the two eras. Hopefully, more information about the movie&#39;s timeline will be released once The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu begins production later this year.
