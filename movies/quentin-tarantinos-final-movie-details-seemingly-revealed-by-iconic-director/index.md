# Quentin Tarantinos Final Movie Details Seemingly Revealed By Iconic Director


## SUMMARY 



  Tarantino&#39;s final movie, The Movie Critic, is set in the &#39;70s and may feature extracts and recreations of films from that era.

## Literature Review
Iconic director Paul Schrader seemingly reveals new details for Quentin Tarantino&#39;s final movie The Movie Critic, confirming a career trend.




As the filmmaker himself has only slowly shared new information for the project, Paul Schrader has seemingly revealed new details for Quentin Tarantino&#39;s final movie, The Movie Critic. The tenth movie from the Oscar winner is expected to be set in the &#39;70s and revolve around a fictional pornographic movie reviewer, taking primary inspiration from the Martin Scorsese classic Taxi Driver. Production was reportedly set to begin in Fall 2023 before the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes delayed the project, with no cast having been announced at the time of writing.




During a recent interview with French publication Le Monde (via The Playlist), Schrader, who wrote Taxi Driver, seemingly revealed new details for The Movie Critic. The Oscar nominee shared that Tarantino previously approached him for permission to direct a portion of one of his prior movies, reinstating the ending for it that was rewritten during production, and that the movie could feature further recreations. See what Schrader said below:


Quentin will insert extracts from films from the 1970s. And he will also make his own versions of films from that era. He asked my permission to shoot the ending of [Rolling Thunder], by John Flynn, as I had written it in the original screenplay â€” before it was completely rewritten and watered down.



 The Movie Critic Looks To Continue One Of Tarantino&#39;s Best Tricks

Should Schrader&#39;s details prove to be true, this wouldn&#39;t be the first time Tarantino has recreated classic titles for a period-set movie. His most recent project, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, saw Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s Rick Dalton inserted in the Steve McQueen classic The Great Escape, the Ty Hardin-led thriller Death on the Run and replacing Burt Reynolds in an episode of the classic police procedural The F.B.I.. At the same time, the dramedy featured archival footage from various Sharon Tate movies, electing to keep them intact versus digitally altering them to put Margot Robbie&#39;s depiction of the late star in them.

With the movie&#39;s time period and setting confirmed, however, The Movie Critic looks to be continuing one of Tarantino&#39;s best career tricks by exploring real history through fictional characters. His first notable instance of doing so was the Oscar-winning World War II thriller Inglourious Basterds, which centered on a fictional group of Jewish American soldiers setting out on a plot to kill Germany&#39;s leadership. Culminating in the brutal murder of Adolf Hitler, the movie paved the way for Tarantino to take a similar approach to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&#39;s alternate history, in which Brad Pitt&#39;s Cliff Booth and Dalton brutally murder the Charles Manson followers who were intended to kill Tate, thus keeping her alive.




While Inglourious Basterds&#39; ending initially divided some for its historical liberties, and no real-world figures are confirmed for The Movie Critic as of yet, it will be interesting to see if Tarantino takes a similar alternate history approach to his final movie&#39;s story. Even in spite of some of the division, the storytelling has generally worked for the filmmaker thus far, and could lead to a meta way for him to close out his award-winning moviemaking career.
