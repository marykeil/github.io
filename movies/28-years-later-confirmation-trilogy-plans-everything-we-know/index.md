## Literature Review

The duo of Alex Garland and Danny Boyle are returning for 28 Years Later, a long-awaited sequel to the zombie film that changed the genre.




Over two decades after the release of the genre-defining zombie film 28 Days Later, director Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland are returning to the realm of horror with the long-awaited 28 Years Later. Essentially helping to jump-start the zombie craze of the 2000s, 28 Days Later follows an average bicycle courier named Jim (Cillian Murphy) who awakens from a month-long coma to find all of London has been besieged by a zombie rage virus. Eschewing the tropes of earlier zombie media, the walkers of 28 Days Later were faster, meaner, and more frightening than their predecessors. 




Though Garland and Boyle were only involved peripherally, a sequel was released in 2007 entitled 28 Weeks Later which continued the post-apocalyptic story and was well-received. Meanwhile, the 28 Days Later franchise helped to bring the zombie film back into vogue, and is directly responsible for movies like the Dawn of the Dead remake, spoofs like Shaun of the Dead, and the ongoing Walking Dead universe. Now, Boyle and Garland are returning to deliver even more terror in 28 Years Later, and the creative duo have big plans for an extended sequel series. 


 28 Years Later Is Confirmed 
          

A sequel to the 28 Days Later series has been bandied about for years, and even as zombie media bloomed in the late 2000s and early 2010s, no follow-up emerged. However, it has now been confirmed that original creative pair Alex Garland and Danny Boyle are finally developing a second sequel entitled 28 Years Later. Though no details about the film have been revealed yet, Garland will once again pen the script while Danny Boyle will return to the director&#39;s chair. 




28 Years Later is the first of a planned trilogy that will continue the post-apocalyptic story even further into the ravages of the rage virus and explore its impact on human society. At this juncture, the film is merely in the developmental phase so no casting has been done yet, and a release date is not on the horizon. In fact, the long-awaited horror sequel hasn&#39;t even landed a studio yet.



 Who Is Making 28 Years Later? 
          

Perhaps the most exciting detail about the recently-announced 28 Years Later is that the original creative duo behind the first film will be returning. Alex Garland wrote the script for 2002&#39;s 28 Days Later, and it was his unique take on zombies that helped to redefine what they meant in the 21st century. Garland also wrote the sci-fi film Ex Machina in 2015 and A24&#39;s epic Civil War releasing in 2024. 




Likewise, Danny Boyle will helm the project and the Oscar Award-winning director has come a long way since his gritty horror masterpiece in 2002. Though 28 Days Later is often considered one of Danny Boyle&#39;s best movies, he also snagged awards for movies like Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, and 127 Hours. It is unclear if Boyle will also direct the planned sequels to 28 Years Later. 



 28 Years Later: Story Details 
          

There have been no 28 Year Later story details yet, but the title suggests the movie will take a big leap in time to explore the impact of the virus outbreak. Though there was initially a script for 28 Months Later (via Variety), it does seem like Alex Garland and Danny Boyle are taking a new approach and focusing on 28 Years Later. While the ending of 28 Days Later gave an optimistic conclusion that suggested the infected were no more, the virus returned in the sequel which saw the contained civilization crumble and London returned to chaos.




28 Weeks Later ended on a much darker note with the survivors escaping to Paris, only to find it overrun with infected. It is safe to assume the third movie will deal with the 28 Days Later virus once again, but it remains to be seen if the world has been in shambles since the end of the second movie or if it will once again be a scenario of life back to normal only for the virus to return in 28 Years Later.
