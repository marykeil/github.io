Summary

  Role Play is an action comedy film starring Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo as a married couple with dangerous secrets.   The movie features spy intrigue, action, romance, and comedy, with Connie Nielsen playing a mysterious character.   Nielsen&#39;s character unravels throughout the movie, challenging the protagonist and revealing the hypocrisy of the &#34;good guys.&#34;  





Prime Video is releasing Role Play, a new action comedy starring Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo as a happily married couple with some very dangerous secrets, on January 12. Cuoco plays Emma Brackett, who masquerades as a businesswoman to cover up the travel required for her career as an assassin. Her husband Dave (Oyelowo) remains blissfully unaware until her job hits too close to home, threatening the safety of Dave and their two kids — as well as their marriage itself.




Role Play also stars Bill Nighy and Connie Nielsen as two mysterious figures out to get Emma for very different reasons, and the movie plays up the spy intrigue and action just as much as it does the romance and comedy. Nielsen in particular is known for her work in movies with high-powered fight sequences, such as Nobody and Wonder Woman, as well as the 2000 classic Gladiator. Role Play, directed by Thomas Vincent and written by Seth W. Owen, gives her the chance to mix physical prowess with comedic chops.

Screen Rant interviewed Connie Nielsen about tackling the mysterious Gwen in Role Play, her approach to action in general, and her feelings about returning for Gladiator 2 and Nobody 2.


 Connie Nielsen Talks Role Play 
         




Screen Rant: I had so much fun watching Role Play. Your character in particular was a lot of fun when she came in. What was it that first stood out to you when you received the script and what made you want to be a part of it?


Connie Nielsen: I was literally just told, &#34;Hey, would you like to do this film?&#34; And then, I read the script and I was like, &#34;Oh, this is so fun.&#34; Yeah, and doing a fun movie with really, really good actors too was just too amazing. We were having a good time too, doing that film, when we were in Berlin. It was really great.


Gwen is a mysterious character who unravels throughout her scenes with Kaley. Can you talk about working with Kaley, bouncing off each other, and building that dynamic?


Connie Nielsen: I mean, it was a great dynamic because she basically hates me and I had to play someone who is just this arch-manipulator. I did just get an opportunity to bring in every single negative person I&#39;ve ever met and piled them into this character.





Did you speak with Thomas Vincent about her backstory and what makes her such a negative person? 


Connie Nielsen: Yeah. I think now when we&#39;re making these films, it&#39;s very psychologically based. Definitely absent or neglectful parents, or a good deal of maybe DNA-based sociopathy, psychopathy maybe even, that kind of thing. And so, it&#39;s always interesting to play with someone whose only real feeling is really one of being wounded.
That was kind of what I thought I was going to bring to her, was to really have this, at the core, someone who is so wounded that she doesn&#39;t know that she can&#39;t make a family happen. She has to actually be a person who is part of a family to do so. But a person who does not know how emotions work, that&#39;s hard. That&#39;s hard. They don&#39;t understand it, basically.
I was playing with that, with the person who just really does not understand this thing, this emotional thing. But who at the core of their being, just has this hunger, this hunger for this family, for this joyful thing that, unfortunately, as she tries to hold onto it, it melts away because no one can be held onto like that.





I love that you said that about the family too, because you really see the difference between Emma having built herself a family, made herself a family, and then Gwen comes in like, &#34;No, actually. It&#39;s me.&#34;


Connie Nielsen: Also, Gwen is pointing out something which is that you can&#39;t live a lie, and she is. She&#39;s living a lie, and Gwen has taken great pleasure in showing the hypocrisy of the so-called good guys because she sees, “You have a family and that&#39;s all sweet, but you know that you will not have a family if I tell the truth. If I tell them who you really are, they will leave you.”
The reason why she can&#39;t tell the truth is that she&#39;s worried that they will leave her. It&#39;s like a real conundrum that she&#39;s sitting with. It&#39;s one of the pretty things about love, is that we actually do respect and accept the person that we love.


          




You have some fun fight scenes in this. How do you approach action in different settings? This is obviously very different from being an Amazonian queen, for example. 


Connie Nielsen: There is something about me that, maybe growing up with brothers and being the oldest child, just enjoys that kind of play. It reminds me of being a kid again. Playing this thing, there is something almost animal about this stalking and fighting and running after.
I think that that&#39;s almost innate in us. All you have to do is open up that little box, and then it becomes this game and speaks to you in the way it does when you&#39;re a child, this plaything of stalking and finding and hunting, and then grabbing your prey.
And so, as soon as I stepped onto my first procedural, Law &amp; Order, that kind of thing, or The Hunted with the FBI and so on, it was just natural to me. I just took that gun and I was just like, &#34;Okay, ready.&#34;


What would you say have been some of the biggest lessons you&#39;ve learned when it comes to physical work and how you step into it as an actor?





Connie Nielsen: Always use the least possible energy. That doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t use energy, it just means that you should make sure that it&#39;s the commensurate energy that you use for these things. If you&#39;re running, use the energy that you need, but don&#39;t use more than that energy because then it looks fake. You have to use just the right amount of energy.


You come in at the midway point in this movie. How much time do you actually get to be on set and get to know the other actors through offscreen camaraderie?


Connie Nielsen: I think it&#39;s really important to create a rapport, but at the same time, it&#39;s like, everybody&#39;s also at the same time really deep into the character, and you have always different types of actors on set. You have the actor who gets energy from talking with every single person on the set and in the crew in between takes. And then, you have the people who are maintaining the energy in from inside. It&#39;s just different people. There&#39;s some people who are just mainlining other people&#39;s energy as a way to stay really on in between takes, and then other people who are saving their energy to then release it when the tick goes. Everybody has their own thing.





I am very excited to see you return to the world of Gladiator. I still remember the day that I first saw Gladiator, and I can&#39;t believe that much time has passed. What&#39;s it like for you to step back into this character&#39;s shoes in this world?


Connie Nielsen: It&#39;s been crazy cool. It&#39;s been insane and such a privilege. I keep saying the word privilege, but that&#39;s what I feel. It&#39;s been super emotional as well. Yeah, I am struggling with the words there. It&#39;s been crazy and amazing.


You&#39;re also coming back for Nobody 2, and that was really an unexpected hit. What&#39;s your favorite thing about that world and working with Bob Odenkirk?


Connie Nielsen: Who doesn&#39;t love Bob? Bob is just so cool and fun and sweet, and he has unbelievable energy. I adore him. That guy is just so great.
And then on top of that, you have this family again. I&#39;m a family person and I love depicting the tensions inside of a family; the natural tensions, but also the sweetness that underlies the love that connects all of these people together. This is a great family. It&#39;s a great story that I look forward to returning to, definitely.
