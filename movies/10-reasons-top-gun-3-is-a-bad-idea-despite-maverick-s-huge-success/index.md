# 10 Reasons Top Gun 3 Is A Bad Idea (Despite Maverick s Huge Success)


## SUMMARY 


 Top Gun 3 would be a bad idea despite the success of Top Gun: Maverick, as the sequel already ended Maverick&#39;s story perfectly. 
 The success of Top Gun: Maverick was overhyped by its box office recovery after the pandemic, and Top Gun 3 would not have the same milestone on its side. 
 Making Top Gun 3 would risk falling into old storylines and copying the original film, as it would be difficult to come up with a fresh narrative that stands apart from the previous movies.

## Literature Review

Top Gun 3 hasn&#39;t been confirmed yet, but making the film would be a bad idea, even though the success of Top Gun: Maverick suggests it would work.




As it turns out, Top Gun 3 is a really bad idea, despite how huge of a success Top Gun: Maverick was. 2022&#39;s Top Gun: Maverick is one of the biggest cinema success stories in recent years, with it not only successfully revitalizing a franchise in a way that many consider to be better than the original, but also almost single-handedly saving movie theaters after the COVID-19 pandemic. Top Gun: Maverick was a massive critical and commercial success, and while it would make sense for a sequel to go into production soon, making Top Gun 3 would be a horrible idea.
Talks of Top Gun 3 have been making the rounds since audiences realized how big of a success Top Gun: Maverick turned out to be, with the massive films renewing interest in the franchise, Tom Cruise, and theaters as a whole. Although nothing about Top Gun 3 has been officially announced, it only makes sense for a sequel to be in production given how successful the film was. Top Gun 3 could see the return of Pete &#34;Maverick&#34; Mitchell for another aerial adventure, or it could shift focus to Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s new characters like Rooster and Hangman. However, both of these directions would be really bad ideas.
            
 
 9 Franchise Questions Top Gun 3 Could Finally Answer 
Top Gun: Maverick might have seemed like a fitting end for the franchise, but the sequel actually left many questions open for Top Gun 3 to answer.












 








 10  Top Gun: Maverick Reaction Was Overhyped By Box Office Recovery 


 







Top Gun: Maverick found the magic formula that got audiences back in theater seats, with it revitalizing the movie theater industry. 

Top Gun: Maverick is a great film, but the reaction to the legacy sequel was incredibly overhyped by its box office recovery. Theaters had been struggling since the COVID-19 pandemic started in early 2020, with many otherwise popular movies flopping due to audiences being leery to return to theaters. However, Top Gun: Maverick found the magic formula that got audiences back in theater seats, with it revitalizing the movie theater industry. This important milestone in cinematic history uplifted Top Gun: Maverick way more than the film would have otherwise, and Top Gun 3 wouldn&#39;t have this milestone on its side.





 9  Top Gun 2 Ended Tom Cruise&#39;s Maverick Story Perfectly 
        

There is nowhere else for Maverick&#39;s story to go, meaning that the only other option is cutting Tom Cruise 

One of the big struggles that Top Gun 3 would have to face is continuing Maverick&#39;s story, as Top Gun: Maverick ended it perfectly. Maverick&#39;s arc still had a lot of loose ends after the conclusion of the original Top Gun, with many of these story beats returning in the legacy sequel. However, Top Gun: Maverick gave Maverick a new relationship, furthered him in his career, and helped resolve his history with Goose and Iceman. There is nowhere else for Maverick&#39;s story to go, meaning that the only other option is cutting Tom Cruise, which is an even worse idea.





 8  Top Gun: Maverick Worked Because So Much Time Passed Since The Original 
        

One of the reasons that Top Gun: Maverick worked so well is because so much time had passed since the original 1986 film. Top Gun: Maverick is pretty similar to the original film, but the decades of technological advancement and the all-new cast helped make the legacy sequel feel unique. If Top Gun 3 happens anytime soon, the film will struggle to make itself stand apart from Top Gun: Maverick, as the lack of time passing will mean that both movies will feel incredibly similar.





 7  Top Gun 3 Couldn&#39;t Match Iceman&#39;s Top Gun: Maverick Return 
        

One of the most impactful moments in Top Gun: Maverick is the return of Val Kilmer&#39;s Iceman, Maverick&#39;s rival who later became his friend in the original Top Gun. Maverick and Iceman&#39;s relationship along with Val Kilmer&#39;s real-world medical battles made the moment incredibly heartfelt, and there is no way that Top Gun 3 can recreate this feeling. Iceman dies in the sequel, meaning he can&#39;t return for Top Gun 3, and none of the other original Top Gun characters would have nearly as impactful of a return.





 6  Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s Original Characters Have All Had Their Arcs Completed 
        

Top Gun: Maverick introduces a large cast of new characters, with many of these young fighter pilots being some of the most interesting parts of the film. It is possible that these new characters could take over in the place of Tom Cruise&#39;s Maverick, but the problem is that all their arcs have been completed. There isn&#39;t a clear direction for where Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s new characters could go in the future, meaning that it would be difficult to bring them back for another story in Top Gun 3.





 5  It Would Be Hard For Top Gun 3 To Avoid Copying Old Top Gun Storylines 


 







Top Gun 3&#39;s story would have several problems if the film ever gets made. There are really only two options for Top Gun stories: exploring how the TOPGUN program works (which the original Top Gun did) or following the cast on a military mission (which Top Gun: Maverick did). It would be difficult to come up with a story that avoids falling into one of these two narratives while also keeping the TOPGUN program and dogfights in the film.





 4  Rooster&#39;s Goose Story Is Key To Top Gun 2 (&amp; It Can&#39;t Return In Top Gun 3) 
        

No returning storylines would be as powerful as Rooster&#39;s Goose story. 

Top Gun: Maverick has a lot of arcs, but the core of the film is Maverick and Rooster&#39;s conflict over the death of Goose in the original film. Maverick&#39;s attempts to connect with Rooster are at the heart of the film, with it culminating in the duo&#39;s plan to escape enemy territory together. By the end of the film, Maverick and Rooster have reconciled, meaning that Top Gun 3 would have to find a different emotional beat to serve as the core of the film. It&#39;s possible that they could create a new one, but no returning storylines would be as powerful as Rooster&#39;s Goose story.





 3  Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s Technical Achievements Won&#39;t Be As Impressive The Second Time 
        

One of the best aspects of Top Gun: Maverick is its technical achievements and scale, with the film looking almost identical to real life. The groundbreaking visual effects combined with the fact that actors flew in real planes make the film look seamless, something that was achieved due to the decades of advancement since the first film. Top Gun 3 would undoubtedly copy these tricks, but it wouldn&#39;t be as impressive the second time around, and there isn&#39;t enough time to innovate the same way that Top Gun: Maverick did.
            
 
 This New Movie Could Prove If Top Gun 3&#39;s Best Maverick Replacement Will Work 
Top Gun 3 is not yet confirmed for production, but one movie has a chance to raise an actor&#39;s stock as the best possible Maverick replacement. 








 2  Tom Cruise&#39;s Mission: Impossible Failure Proves Top Gun 3 Isn&#39;t Guaranteed Box Office Gold 
        

Top Gun: Maverick was a massive hit, but releasing Top Gun 3 is risky due to Tom Cruise&#39;s Mission: Impossible failure proving that Top Gun 3 isn&#39;t guaranteed box office gold. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One was a box office disappointment, which was surprising to many due to Tom Cruise riding on the success of Top Gun: Maverick. Mission: Impossible 7 proved that Tom Cruise could fail, and releasing Top Gun 3 risks continuing this unfortunate trend.





 1  Top Gun 3 Can&#39;t Rely On Nostalgia Anymore 
        

One of the main reasons that Top Gun: Maverick was such a success was its reliance on nostalgia for the original Top Gun. Iceman&#39;s return, the use of archival footage, and even the opening credits all called back to the original film, recapturing the feeling that fans of Top Gun had back in 1986. However, now that this cat has been let out of the bag, Top Gun 3 can&#39;t rely on nostalgia anymore, meaning that it has a much greater uphill battle than its predecessor did.
