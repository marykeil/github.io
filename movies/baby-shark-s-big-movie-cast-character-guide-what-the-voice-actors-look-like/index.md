## Literature Review

Baby Shark&#39;s Big Movie! is the first feature-length film for the Baby Shark characters, who are voiced by an array of impressive actors.




The popular Baby Shark characters return for their first feature-length movie, Baby Shark&#39;s Big Movie! Considering that &#34;Baby Shark&#34; was once the most-watched video on YouTube, it&#39;s likely that most people online have heard the catchy song that will undoubtedly begin playing in anyone&#39;s head the moment they see the lyrics, &#34;doo doo do-do-do-do&#34;. This children&#39;s song is easy to sing along to and has interactive hand movements, so kids can dance to the tune. The song has become a cultural phenomenon, even inspiring a TV show on Nickelodeon, Baby Shark&#39;s Big Show!




Many kids&#39; TV shows eventually become movies and Baby Shark&#39;s Big Show! is no different. Baby Shark&#39;s Big Movie! premiered on Paramount&#43; on December 8, 2023, and follows the Shark family, primarily Baby Shark, as they move from their quiet home of Carnivore Cove to the big city. There, the Shark family must adjust to their new life and Baby must stop an evil popstar starfish from stealing his gift for music, which she hopes to use to control all the music underwater. Baby Shark&#39;s Big Movie! features impressive and notable cast members voicing these beloved characters.
