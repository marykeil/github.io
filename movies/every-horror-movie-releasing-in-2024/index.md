## Literature Review

2024&#39;s horror movies include sequels like Beetlejuice 2 and MaXXXine and new movies by Jordan Peele and M. Night Shyamalan. Here&#39;s when they release.




The 2024 horror movie lineup is filled with new scary stories and the return of popular horror franchises thanks to several upcoming releases. Horror movies have always been an incredibly large part of the Hollywood release slate, and that has only continued to be the case thanks to studios wanting these thrilling stories in theaters and on streaming services. They often make for some of the biggest surprise hits of the year at the box office, as the 2023 horror movies repeatedly proved possible.
When it comes to 2024, those looking for a thrill will have ample opportunities to do so thanks to a mixture of original stories, remakes, and sequels. This includes having new movies arrive from acclaimed filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan, Robert Eggers, and Tim Burton, as well as the Radio Silence duo and Ti West. Meanwhile, modern franchises like A Quiet Place and older series like Alien come back with new installments and are considered some of 2024&#39;s most anticipated movies. Here is every horror movie releasing in 2024:
