Summary

  Chris Hemsworth will replace Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime in Transformers One, which has caused controversy.   Transformers One features a star-studded cast including Brian Tyree Henry, Keegan-Michael Key, Scarlett Johansson, Jon Hamm, and Laurence Fishburne.   Hemsworth&#39;s casting is an attempt to add star power and attract more viewers to the declining Transformers franchise.  





Transformers One, the first animated movie in the Transformers film series, will be released in late 2024, and one of the main characters will sound a bit different than he did in previous projects. Chris Hemsworth, known for his role as Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is set to lead the voice cast as one of the most iconic characters in the franchise — Optimus Prime. However, Hemsworth is replacing an actor who has played the Autobot in question for almost 40 years, which is part of a larger casting issue developing in Hollywood.




Aside from Hemsworth as Optimus Prime, the rest of the cast of Transformers One includes Brian Tyree Henry as Megatron, Keegan-Michael Key as Bumblebee, Scarlett Johansson as Elita-One, Jon Hamm as Sentinel Prime, and Laurence Fishburne as Alpha Trion. Other characters will likely be revealed as the premiere date gets closer. But as of the writing of this article, the animated film features a star-studded cast with multiple recognizable names. While at first glance, this is exciting, it just highlights one of the more recent problems with casting voice actors.

                  Transformers One: Story, Cast, Release Date &amp; Everything We Know   Led by Chris Hemsworth, Transformers One will tell the origin story of Cyberton. But who else will star in the animated film and when is it released?    


 Why Chris Hemsworth Is Voicing Optimus Prime In Transformers One Instead Of Peter Cullen 
Paramount Is Counting On Star Power To Boost Box Office Figures
         




Peter Cullen has been the voice of Optimus Prime since his first appearance in the 1984 American-Japanese animated television series The Transformers. Since then, Cullen has played the Autobot in several shows and films, including every movie in the Transformers film series — Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Transformers: The Last Knight, Bumblebee, and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. However, Cullen passes the baton to Chris Hemsworth for the 2024 animated movie Transformers One.

                  Only 1 Actor Has Starred In Every Transformers Movie (But Won&#39;t Be In Transformers One)   One actor in the Transformers franchise has played the same for almost four decades, but that streak is about to end with Transformers One.   

The Transformers film series hasn&#39;t been the same since Age of Extinction. Instead of only getting bigger (and grossing more money at the worldwide box office), the franchise is in a downward spiral, with box office figures steadily falling. So, perhaps to rectify this issue, the producers wanted to add some star power to the series, which is why Hemsworth was chosen to voice Optimus Prime instead of Cullen. Hemsworth&#39;s name alone will (in theory) attract more eyeballs and is a greater incentive to see Transformers One in theaters.




 Transformers Movie  Box Office (Lifetime Gross, Domestic)   Transformers  $319,246,193   Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen  $402,111,870   Transformers: Dark of the Moon  $352,390,543   Transformers: Age of Extinction  $245,439,076   Transformers: The Last Knight  $130,168,683   Bumblebee  $127,195,589   Transformers: Rise of the Beasts  $157,066,392   





 Transformers&#39; Optimus Prime Recast Shows How Hollywood Overlooks Voice Actors 
Multiple Existing Voice Actors Are Being Recast In Hollywood
          

Paramount&#39;s choice to replace Cullen with Hemsworth is a controversial one, because Peter Cullen&#39;s voice is entirely recognizable as Optimus Prime due to his various Transformers roles over the years. Unfortunately, this move is just another example of Hollywood passing over talented voice actors in favor of hiring big stars for their films - hoping to capitalize on their star power. This is happening with increasing frequency, even when existing voice actors are well-known for an ongoing role. Universal Pictures cast Chris Pratt as Mario in The Super Mario Bros. Movie instead of getting one of the iconic voice actors from the video games to play the character. Pixar chose Chris Evans to replace Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear in Lightyear. And now, Cullen is being pushed aside so that Hemsworth can voice Optimus Prime in Transformers One.




This trend is frustrating for existing fans, who want to hear the characters as they have come to know and love them, but a desire to capitalize on star power may not be the only reason for switching things up. Especially for characters who have existed in animation or video games for decades, sheer practicality may be part of the decision, as voice actors retire. In the case of Optimus Prime, Peter Cullen is now 82 years old, and in 2021, Transformers producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura said that he would play Optimus until he no longer wanted to (via Comicbook.com).This would suggest that Cullen himself decided it was time to step down for Transformers One. 



Peter Cullen has won multiple awards for his voice acting in Transformers, as well as the Voice Arts Award Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019.
