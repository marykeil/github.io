## Literature Review

January 2024 will see the wide release of 8 new movies in the United States that are set to compete with a wide variety of December 2023&#39;s best films.




There are eight major titles that are releasing in theaters which will make up the bulk of the January 2024 box office. Eleven major titles were released in December 2023 to wrap up the year in movies as awards season rapidly approaches. Some of these titles include Poor Things, Ferrari, The Boy and the Heron, The Iron Claw, Migration, Aquaman 2, and Wonka. A strong box office finish in December allowed for a $9 billion total in revenue, a landmark figure that 2024 is already projected not to surpass due to its fewer wide releases.
January is historically considered a slow month for the movies, as most of the films that are released in January are typically not among the best of the year. This is mostly due to the industry shifting focus on the best movies of the year before it and the fact that January movies often aren&#39;t very relevant during awards season in any given year. Many of the December and Christmas 2023 releases will likely continue to drive box office performance throughout January, particularly Wonka, Migration, and Aquaman 2. Many limited titles will also see expanded releases in foreign markers in January such as Poor Things and The Boy and the Heron.
            
 
 25 Most Anticipated Movies Of 2024 
There are plenty of major franchises, directors, and stars with films coming out in 2024, but these are Screen Rant&#39;s most anticipated movies of 2024.












 








 8  Night Swim 
$42 - 56 million
        

  Night Swim  
5 
/ 10 




  Release Date    January 5, 2024     Director    Bryce McGuire     Cast    Kerry Condon , Wyatt Russell , Nancy Lenehan , Amélie Hoeferle , Jodi Long , Gavin Warren     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    116 Minutes     Genres    Horror , Thriller     Writers    Rod Blackhurst , Bryce McGuire     Studio(s)    Atomic Monster , Blumhouse Productions , Universal Pictures     Distributor(s)    Universal Pictures    


The first major horror movie of the year Night Swim will come out on January 5, 2024. January horror movie releases have historically done well in the past, particularly in the case of last year&#39;s breakout hit M3GAN, which ended up being the third highest-grossing horror movie of 2023 with a total of roughly $95 million domestically. Night Swim could follow a similar route as M3GAN, especially considering the fact that both Blumhouse and Universal were involved in the film&#39;s production. Night Swim stars Wyatt Russell and is written and directed by Bryce McGuire.





 7  He Went That Way 
$7 - 21 million
        

  He Went That Way  
3 
/ 10 




  Release Date    June 9, 2023     Director    Jeffrey Darling     Cast    Zachary Quinto , Jacob Elordi , Patrick J. Adams     Rating    Not Rated     Runtime    95 Minutes     Genres    Crime , Drama , Thriller     Writers    Evan M. Wiener     Studio(s)    Mister Smith Entertainment , Tea Shop Productions     Distributor(s)    Vertical Entertainment    


Also coming out on January 5, 2024 is He Went That Way, an apparent hybrid of a road movie and a serial killer murder story. The film, starring Jacob Elordi and Zachary Quinto, is sure to draw fans of either or both actors to the theaters but sill likely have a tough time against the release of Night Swim as well as the rollover of the December movie slate. He Went That Way is based on a true story which could generate some natural appeal. However, without much of a marketing effort and a competitive theatrical market, the film could end up being brushed under the rug.





 6  Mean Girls 
$75 - 89 million
        

  Mean Girls (2024)  


  Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    Samantha Jayne , Arturo Perez Jr.     Cast    Angourie Rice , Auli&#39;i Cravalho , Jaquel Spivey , Reneé Rapp , Jon Hamm , Ashley Park , Jenna Fischer , Tina Fey , Tim Meadows     Rating    Not Yet Rated     Genres    Comedy , Musical     Writers    Nell Benjamin , Tina Fey     Studio(s)    Broadway Video , Little Stranger , Paramount Pictures , Paramount Players     Distributor(s)    Paramount Pictures     Story By    Tina Fey    


The most anticipated theatrical release of January 2024 is the Mean Girls musical, which is based on the popular Broadway play. While the original Mean Girls earned roughly $86 million domestically, the Mean Girls musical film has the potential to outperform it due to many factors including its already existing audience and the lingering hype from last year&#39;s most portable movie, Barbie. Some estimates have Mean Girls surpassing the $100 million mark domestically, but its most significant figure will be whether or not it makes more than Tiny Fey&#39;s original 2004 classic.

 5  The Beekeeper 
$24 - 38 million
        

  The Beekeeper  
6 
/ 10 




  Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    David Ayer     Cast    Jason Statham , Emmy Raver-Lampman , Josh Hutcherson , Bobby Naderi , Minnie Driver , Phylicia Rashad , Jeremy Irons     Rating    R     Genres    Action , Thriller     Writers    Kurt Wimmer     Studio(s)    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , MiraMax , Cedar Park Studios , Punch Palace Productions     Distributor(s)    Amazon MGM Studios    


Also getting released on January 12, 2024 is Jason Statham&#39;s latest action film The Beekeeper. Statham has a pretty consistent audience that will almost certainly show up to theaters, making it very likely that he will hit his typical range of anywhere between $24 million and $36 million domestically. Several of Statham&#39;s previous movies fall within that range, including 2021&#39;s Wrath of Man, 2011&#39;s Killer Elite, and 2011&#39;s The Mechanic. Statham is following up 2023 after appearing in Fast X, Meg 2: The Trench, and the box office flop Expend4bles.





 4  The Book Of Clarence 
$17 - 31 million
        

  The Book of Clarence  


  Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    Jeymes Samuel     Cast    LaKeith Stanfield , Omar Sy , Anna Diop , RJ Cyler , David Oyelowo , Micheal Ward , Alfre Woodard , Teyana Taylor , Caleb McLaughlin , James McAvoy , Benedict Cumberbatch     Rating    Not Yet Rated     Runtime    136 Minutes     Genres    Adventure , Comedy , Drama     Writers    Jeymes Samuel     Studio(s)    Legendary Pictures , Kilburn Lane     Distributor(s)    TriStar Pictures    


The Book of Clarence appears to be one of the most original movies set to hit theaters in January 2024 and will also be released on January 12th. Based on the comical tone from its trailer, the Lakeith Stanfield movie could likely produce a similar box office result as another one of his more eccentric projects Sorry to Bother You, which earned roughly $18 million domestically. The film should also draw appeal from other notable actors such as David Oyelowo, James McAvoy, and Benedict Cumberbatch who round out the cast of the Jeymes Samuel (The Harder They Fall) film.





 3  I.S.S. 
$5 - 19 million
        

  I.S.S.  
6 
/ 10 




  Release Date    January 19, 2024     Director    Gabriela Cowperthwaite     Cast    Ariana DeBose , Chris Messina , Pilou Asbæk , John Gallagher Jr. , Costa Ronin , Maria Mashkova     Rating    R     Runtime    95 Minutes     Genres    Action , Drama , Thriller     Writers    Nick Shafir     Studio(s)    LD Entertainment     Distributor(s)    Bleecker Street    


A dystopian outer space sci-fi thriller starring Ariana DeBose is set to release on January 19, 2024. The film depicts the hypothetical situation in which the United States and Russia engage in a global war causing mass destruction on Earth, forcing a group of Russian and American astronauts to fight for control of the International Space Station. While the premise does sound gripping and the trailer is certainly intense and engaging, I.S.S. likely won&#39;t be a major hit at the box office this month. The notable space film Moonfall from 2022 was a box office disaster upon its February release.





 2  Miller&#39;s Girl 
$21 - 35 million
        

  Miller&#39;s Girl  


  Release Date    January 26, 2024     Director    Jade Bartlett     Cast    Martin Freeman , Jenna Ortega , Gideon Adlon , Bashir Salahuddin , Dagmara Dominczyk , Christine Adams     Runtime    93 Minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama     Writers    Jade Bartlett     Studio(s)    Point Grey Pictures     Distributor(s)    Lionsgate    


One of the biggest question marks of the January 2024 box office is Miller&#39;s Girl starring Jenny Ortega and Martin Freeman. The film, which will be released on January 26, 2024, tells the story of a student and a teacher who form a complicated relationship outside of the classroom. It&#39;s difficult to predict how much of Ortega&#39;s massive fanbase will turn out to theaters to see her play the boundary-pushing writing student named Cairo Sweet. Ortega&#39;s fans could certainly make a big show of support by seeing Miller&#39;s Girl in theaters in response to her recently withdrawing from the hugely successful Scream franchise.

 1  Sometimes I Think About Dying 
$12 - 26 million
        

  Sometimes I Think About Dying  
7 
/ 10 




  Release Date    January 26, 2024     Director    Rachel Lambert     Cast    Katy Wright-Mead , Daisy Ridley , Dave Merheje , Parvesh Cheena , Marcia DeBonis , Meg Stalter , Brittany O&#39;Grady     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    91 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama , Romance     Writers    Kevin Armento , Stefanie Abel Horowitz , Katy Wright-Mead     Studio(s)    Sweet Tomato Films , Page Fifty-Four Productions , Point Productions , Mirror Image Films     Distributor(s)    Oscilloscope Laboratories    


In what could be the most unexpectedly good movie of January 2024, Sometimes I Think About Dying will be released on January 26, 2024. The film actually premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2023 and will be released for the first time in the United States this month. Daisy Ridley gives a tour-de-force performance in this character study about a woman named Fran who struggles to find joy in anything. Sometimes I Think About Dying has been celebrated for its sobering look into depression and the blandness of everyday life, making it a sleeper pick at the January 2024 box office.
