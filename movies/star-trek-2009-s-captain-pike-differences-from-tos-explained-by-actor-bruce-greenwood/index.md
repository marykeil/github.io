## Literature Review

Bruce Greenwood discusses his role as Captain Christopher Pike in Star Trek (2009), contrasting the character with Jeffrey Hunter&#39;s original Pike.




Star Trek&#39;s (2009) Bruce Greenwood discusses how his movie version of Captain Christopher Pike differs from Jeffrey Hunter&#39;s original in 1965’s unaired Star Trek: The Original Series pilot, &#34;The Cage.&#34; Appearing alongside later Star Trek veterans Leonard Nimoy and Majel Barrett, Hunter stars as Captain of the USS Enterprise – a precursor of Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner). Styled as straighter laced and more brooding than subsequent versions of the character, Hunter’s Pike was rejected by NBC for being “too intellectual” (read: boring). Bruce Greenwood introduces the alternate timeline Pike, bringing accessibility, openness, steadiness, patience, and quiet wisdom to the role.




In &#34;The Fifty-Year Mission: The Next 25 Years&#34; by Mark A. Altman and Edward Gross, Bruce Greenwood discusses Jeffrey Hunter&#39;s Captain Pike and contrasts it with his own portrayal in Star Trek (2009), highlighting Pike’s “misgivings” about Starfleet’s recruitment program. Attempting to convince a young James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) to enlist, Pike comments that Kirk’s “instinct to leap without looking” was something that Starfleet had lost, baiting Kirk with a dare and taking on the role of mentor. Read Greenwood’s quote below:


To find the character of Christopher Pike, I really had nothing to go on but Jeffrey Hunter&#39;s portrayal of the character in the first Star Trek pilot, &#34;The Cage.&#34; The fundamental difference between the Hunter Pike and the Greenwood Pike is that our dilemmas are different, Hunter&#39;s being that he was terribly ambivalent about his place in the Federation; he was torn by whether or not he wanted to go back and have a smaller life or that of a commander. My Pike doesn&#39;t have an internal wrestling match the way the earlier one did, but he does have second thoughts and misgivings about the way Starfleet is training officers as by-the-book products that may not, at the end of the day, be what&#39;s required for a great leader. So he keeps his eye out for that kind of special young man, and as it happens, Kirk seems to fit that bill.







Star Trek: The Original Series repurposed footage from &#34;The Cage&#34; pilot for the season one two-part story (episodes 11 and 12), &#34;The Menagerie.&#34; Among other guest roles in TOS, actor Sean Kenney plays the disfigured Fleet Captain Christopher Pike in &#34;The Menagerie.&#34;




                  Kirk’s TOS Success Made Pike’s Debut Star Trek’s First Prequel   The success of Star Trek: The Original Series resulted in its pilot episode, &#34;The Cage,&#34; becoming its first prequel and led to a universe of stories.   


 Anson Mount Reinvented Captain Pike In Star Trek: Strange New Worlds 
Anson Mount&#39;s Captain Pike starred in both Star Trek: Discovery (season 2) and Star Trek: Strange New Worlds
         

First appearing in Star Trek: Discovery season 2, Captain Christopher Pike (Anson Mount) assumed temporary command of the USS Discovery, going on to lead the crew of the USS Enterprise in 2022 as Captain in the spin-off show Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. Coming to terms in Strange New Worlds season 1 with knowledge of his tragic future fate (as seen in TOS&#39; &#34;The Menagerie&#34; and Discovery season 2, episode 12, &#34;Through the Valley of Shadows&#34;), Anson Mount revitalizes Star Trek&#39;s Captain Christopher Pike. Bringing gravitas, maturity, style, humor, a friendly countenance, and significantly developed emotional depth to Pike, Mount transforms Hunter&#39;s original into one of Star Trek&#39;s signature Starfleet Captains.




Anson Mount&#39;s performance as Captain Pike delivers greater nuance than Jeffrey Hunter&#39;s early interpretation, showcasing a commanding character that is less jaded, less prone to quick judgments, and more willing to mingle among his crew. Though Jeffrey Hunter first brought life to Captain Pike and established the groundwork of the character, the ambivalence towards his Starfleet role and clear separation from the Enterprise crew presents Hunter&#39;s Pike as complex and detached. With Bruce Greenwood&#39;s Kelvin-verse Captain-to-Admiral Pike also highlighting positive transformation, the heroic Captain Pike character has seen a significant revamp and transformation in modern Star Trek despite facing a terrible, predetermined, finite fate.



Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek: The Original Series are available for streaming on Paramount&#43;.
