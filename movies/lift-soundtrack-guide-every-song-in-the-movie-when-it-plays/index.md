Apart from walking through a gripping heist plan, Netflix&#39;s Lift also features an array of scintillating tracks that complement its action scenes. Following a typical heist narrative, Lift focuses on a group of thieves who steal art. Kevin Hart&#39;s Cyrus serves as their leader, who seems to adopt a Robin Hood-esque mentality where he only believes in stealing from those who deserve to be stolen from. However, the team&#39;s morality is put to the test when they get involved in a mission that involves stealing from a corrupt tech billionaire whose plan could destroy the world&#39;s water resources.

Although their new mission proves to be a risky and nearly impossible endeavor, the team formulates a meticulous plan to make it happen. They face several unforeseeable challenges along the way but somehow work things out. While Cyrus and his team create and execute their heist plan, the movie features a diverse set of songs that make its action and drama all the more captivating. This makes it hard not to wonder which song plays where in the film.

 When Every Song On Lift Soundtrack Plays During The Movie 
         

&#34;Edamame (feat. Rich Brian)&#34; by BBNO$: This track plays in Lift&#39;s opening arc where Cyrus and his team leave the venue of the bid while Abby and her team try to stop them. Before Abby can catch them, Cyrus makes it to his boat with N8 and escapes the location. &#34;Edamame&#34; continues to play as the movie introduces all the main characters and the respective roles they play in Cyrus&#39; team.




&#34;Players (DJ Smallz 732 Remix)&#34; by Coi Leray: After taking N8 to their boat, they transfer the amount they had previously pitched for his NFT during the bid. With what follows, the crew celebrates on Cyrus&#39; boat while Coi Leray&#39;s &#34;Players (DJ Smallz 732 Remix)&#34; plays in the background.

&#34;Pop Out&#34; by Big Boogie: To execute the first step of their overarching gold-stealing plan in Lift, Cyrus and Abby have to arrange a private jet. This is when they approach Mollsen and threaten him to let them borrow his aircraft. Before giving them a tour of his plane, Mollsen plays Big Boogie&#39;s &#34;Pop Out.&#34;

&#34;Chop Suey!&#34; by System of a Down: Magnus is presented as the safebreaker in Cyrus&#39; team. While honing his safebreaking skills using a laser, Magnus realizes that the plane&#39;s turbulence could prevent him from opening the gold vault on time. He even demonstrates the same by playing System of a Down&#39;s &#34;Chop Suey!&#34; and showing how the heavy beats from the song make the laser move out of its desired path. Cyrus solves his problem by asking him to use a Stewart platform.




&#34;777&#34; by Silk Sonic: Silk Sonic&#39;s &#34;777&#34; plays in the background when Cyrus briefs the team about their respective roles for the last time before they set out to execute their final plan.

&#34;Southside Phantom&#34; by Maker: This can be heard in Netflix&#39;s Lift when Cyrus and his team finally board the A380 while Camila gets inside the private jet. As they prepare themselves to execute the heist, Maker&#39;s &#34;Southside Phantom&#34; continues playing in the background.

&#34;Busy Earnin’&#34; by Jungle: Jungle&#39;s &#34;Busy Earnin&#39;&#34; plays in Netflix&#39;s Lift when Abby resigns from Interpol and joins forces with Cyrus and his team. The song continues playing when she joins them on their boat back home and also plays when the movie flashes forward to a scene where Cyrus reveals that they also stole the gold from Lars&#39; A380.

&#34;Move On Up&#34; by Curtis Mayfield: Before Lift&#39;s credits start rolling, Cyrus gives Abby a gift that connects to her childhood, marking the end of their dangerous heist and the inception of their new relationship. During these ending moments in Lift, Curtis Mayfield&#39;s &#34;Move On Up&#34; can be heard in the background and continues playing almost throughout the credits.
