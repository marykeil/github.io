## Literature Review

With a first Mistborn movie now in development, many may want to experience the Mistborn story via the books before watching it on the big screen.




Fantasy author Brandon Sanderson is finally having his Mistborn series adapted to film, which means that many movie fans will want to dive headfirst into the series before watching the story come to life on-screen, and this is how to read it properly. Mistborn is a high fantasy book series that contains seven books in total, though they are split into two separate eras. Furthermore, the Mistborn series is part of a larger fantasy universe written by Brandon Sanderson called The Cosmere. Currently, a Mistborn movie is in development. In 2020, Sanderson announced he would be writing the screenplay, and in 2023, he revealed that development was temporarily on pause.




Brandon Sanderson released the first Mistborn book, The Final Empire, in 2006, and the most recent book, The Lost Metal, in 2022. The Mistborn series includes seven books which are split into two separate &#34;eras&#34; or series. Both eras are connected by their setting, Scadriel, although they take place at different times. In the first era, the story sees Scadriel when it is covered in ash and mist, and a group of allomancers, who can use metal as magic, try to overthrow their oppressive leader. The second era takes place centuries later, and sees a &#34;wild-West deputy&#34; move to the big city to investigate mysterious kidnappings and robberies.

                  Casting The Mistborn Fantasy Series As A Live-Action Movie: 11 Actors Who&#39;d Be Perfect   Mistborn is one of the most popular 21st-century fantasy novel series and is ripe for a film adaptation. Who should play the main characters?   


 How To Read All 7 Mistborn Books In Order 
Mistborn Era One
         




Mistborn era one consists of three books, published from 2006 to 2008. These novels, in publication order, include The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. As previously mentioned, Mistborn era one takes place in Scadriel when it is under the thumb of the powerful Lord Ruler. The series follows a young woman named Vin who discovers that she is a mistborn, an allomancer able to manipulate every kind of metal to enhance her abilities. Vin joins up with a group of criminal allomancers to take down the Lord Ruler once and for all. However, their plan leads to a much bigger journey with dangerous consequences.



As of now, the Mistborn movie adaptation has no release date, no cast, and is on hold due to &#34;hiccups,&#34; according to Brandon Sanderson.




Mistborn era one should be read in the following order: The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, and The Hero of Ages. This is the same as the publication order. In regard to Mistborn era one and era two, it is not necessary to read era one before era two. The eras are interchangable. However, if a reader was to read Mistborn era two before era one, it is likely that they would not be familiar with certain events or characters mentioned that were explored in era one. This will not ruin the reading experience by any means, but it is something to consider before diving in.




 Book Title  Release Date   The Final Empire  July 17, 2006   The Well of Ascension  August 21, 2007   The Hero of Ages  October 14, 2008   



Mistborn Era Two
Mistborn era two contains four books published from 2011 to 2022. They include The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning, and The Lost Metal. Mistborn era two takes place 300 years after the events of Mistborn era one. In particular, the story follows Waxillium Ladrian, who travels to the big city to look into a series of strange crimes. The series&#39; historical backdrop is similar to that of the real world in the 20th century. Furthermore, it introduces a new aspect of the magic world called Twinborns, those who are born with both allomantic and feruchemical powers.

Once again, Mistborn era two should be read in publication order: The Alloy of Law, Shadows of Self, The Bands of Mourning, and The Lost Metal. Mistborn era two can be read before Mistborn era one, but there is no tried and true way to do it. If a reader chooses to read Mistborn era one first, then they will likely have a better understanding of the history mentioned in Mistborn era two. Either way, both series sufficiently describe the world, the magic system, and the current plot.




 Book Title  Release Date   The Alloy of Law  November 8, 2011   Shadows of Self  October 6, 2015   The Bands of Mourning  January 26, 2016   The Lost Metal  November 15, 2022   





 Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Other Cosmere Books &amp; How They Connect To Mistborn 
          

As previously mentioned, the Mistborn series is part of a greater fantasy universe called the Cosmere. Including the Mistborn series, there are three series, five standalones, and one book of collected stories that are part of the Cosmere. The Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere books are as follows: Elantris, the Mistborn series, Warbreaker, The Stormlight Archive, Arcanum Unbounded, Tress of the Emerald Sea, Yumi and the Nightmare Painter, The Sunlit Man and White Sand. Once again, there is no particular order in which to read these books. Furthermore, it isn&#39;t necessary to read every book to understand the Cosmere. In general, readers may explore the Cosmere at their leisure.
