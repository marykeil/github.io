## Literature Review

10 of the 13 Star Trek movies have left Paramount&#43; and moved to Max, which has drawn the ire of Star Trek fans online.




Only J.J. Abrams&#39; three Star Trek movies starring Chris Pine remain on Paramount&#43; as of January 1, 2024, a move that has angered Star Trek fans. The six Star Trek movies starring the cast of Star Trek: The Original Series - Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek III: The Search for Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country - and the four Star Trek: The Next Generation movies - Star Trek Generations, Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection, and Star Trek: Nemesis - are now streaming on Max. In a now-deleted post on X, Paramount&#43; Help (@askparamount) explained the jump of Star Trek movies to Max was due to &#34;streaming rights.&#34;




Although this has happened before - the same 10 Star Trek movies streamed on HBO Max starting November 2022 before returning to Paramount&#43; in July 2023 - irate Star Trek fans took to Twitter/X to complain about the sudden disappearance of the films from &#34;the Home of Star Trek&#34; on New Year&#39;s Day. Here is a sampling of the angry posts:


 

X user @Xamie likely echoes many fans who are unwilling or unable to subscribe to Max to watch the Star Trek movies:


 

Licensing content to other streaming services is an increasingly common business move, just as Warner Bros. Discovery licensed DC movies to Netflix. But this is one reason users like @KhakiBlueSocks advocate owning physical media:





 

X user @MidKnightReaper brings up the point that Paramount&#43; advertises itself as the Home of Star Trek:


 

X user @Loki_Wodenson urges Paramount&#43; not to alienate their fans the way Disney is perceived to have:


 

                  13 Star Trek Movies Ranked By Worst To Best Box Office   Every Star Trek fan can tell you their personal ranking of the 13 Star Trek films, but how did they stack up at the US box office?   





 What Is The Future Of Star Trek Movies? 
A new Star Trek movie is being made for Paramount&#43;
         

Star Trek hasn&#39;t been able to mount production of a new theatrical movie since Star Trek Beyond in 2016. Despite big-name filmmakers like Matt Shakman, S.J. Clarkson, Noah Hawley, and Quentin Tarantino developing a new Star Trek movie, and an announced release date of December 22, 2023 that came and went, a fourth Star Trek movie produced by J.J. Abrams remains mired in development hell. This is despite the stated willingness of the cast led by Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto to return to their roles aboard the Starship Enterprise.

However, Star Trek on Paramount&#43; does have a new Star Trek movie starting production: Star Trek: Section 31 starring Academy Award-winner Michelle Yeoh. Section 31 is being made exclusively for streaming on Paramount&#43;, and it is potentially the first of a series of made-for-streaming Star Trek movies to be released every two years. Star Trek: Section 31 will film from January to March 2024, and it may be released by the end of 2024 or in 2025. Of course, it remains to be seen whether Paramount will license Star Trek: Section 31 to other streaming services like Max as it does the other Star Trek movies.






Star Trek: The Original Series and Star Trek: The Next Generation movies are available to stream on Max.


J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movie trilogy is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
