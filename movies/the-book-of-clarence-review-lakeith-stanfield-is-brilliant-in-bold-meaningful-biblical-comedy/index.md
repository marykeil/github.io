## Literature Review

Jeymes Samuel&#39;s The Book of Clarence has style &amp; daring concepts. LaKeith Stanfield&#39;s performance positions him as an actor who can do anything.




The Book of Clarence is the first great film of 2024. Jeymes Samuel’s follow-up to The Harder They Fall proves he is a writer-director on a different level. Every choice is a delight, and the result is a biblical comedy that soars. The modern touches make for a refreshing tone, while everything from the central tale to the music, dialogue, and set design are gloriously arranged. But beyond the film&#39;s style is extraordinary substance. On its surface, The Book of Clarence is about a nonbeliever and con man on a journey of self-discovery. Cleverly, the film doesn&#39;t ask us to believe in God, but asks us what belief looks like.




                  Where To Watch The Book Of Clarence: Showtimes &amp; Streaming Status   The Book of Clarence is a new Biblical comedy from director Jeymes Samuel and star LaKeith Stanfield. There are options for where to watch the movie,   


 The Film Is Comfortable In Its Own Shoes 
There is no topic too bold to tackle

 

Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield) is down on his luck and owes a lot of money to some very dangerous people. He resents his twin brother for abandoning him and his mother to follow Jesus Christ. Clarence gets frustrated with his life and jealous of Jesus’ reputation, so he hatches a plan. Along with his merry band of misfits (RJ Cyler and Omar Sy), he begins faking miracles and collecting money from those who believe him a messiah. As the Romans get wind of this, money becomes the least of Clarence’s problems.




Clarence has a lot of ambitions, but the film also tackles his growing understanding of faith. In fact, The Book of Clarence&#39;s true stroke of genius is its take on religion. The film never shies away from bold and exciting concepts or confrontations with Christianity as it is. Clarence himself is truly an avatar for the audience, as he represents believers and nonbelievers. A weed dealer with a heart of gold, Clarence never comes off as anything other than human. The script wisely positions him in a place where he can come to understand everyone&#39;s feelings, and Stanfield brilliantly and effortlessly accesses these emotions.



The film never shies away from bold and exciting concepts or confrontations with Christianity as it is.




If you’ve ever watched 20 minutes of a movie and realized it&#39;s about Christianity, you might feel a bit betrayed by the film&#39;s setup. Conversely, films that are blatantly about religion tend to focus on hyper-serious subject matter, or they simply have a high barrier of entry. The Book of Clarence couldn&#39;t care less about any of that. It is unapologetic about what it&#39;s trying to be and no one who&#39;s seen the trailer and likes it will be disappointed by the film.






 Music Plays An Important Role In The Book Of Clarence 
         

If we have learned anything from Samuel’s last work, it&#39;s that music plays a huge part in elevating the material. Gospel is seamlessly woven into the film&#39;s score and soundtrack and every track is a banger. Aside from Jay-Z blessing us with a verse, all the songs have gospel chords and lyrics set to neo-soul, R&amp;B, and reggae music. The score is just as enthralling; gospel choirs grace us with a glorious serenade that is epic and emotional. The music never overshadows, it only complements.



The script wisely positions Clarence in a place where he can come to understand everyone&#39;s feelings, and Stanfield brilliantly and effortlessly accesses these emotions.




The film perfectly blends contemporary dialogue while staying true to the period. Characters are shown rolling blunts, and it is a hysterical leap of faith by Samuels to trust we would not only accept it, but love it. It would be a disservice to say his films have a Tarantino-like energy because they&#39;re something wholly original, but it might be the closest comparison.




What&#39;s more, the sets and locations are nothing short of perfect. Mountains covered in green against white stone surfaces make the worldbuilding that much easier to dive into. The sincerity with which The Book of Clarence approaches its story, combined with its sheer boldness, will cement Samuel as a filmmaker who soars to unimaginable heights.
