## Literature Review

The Best Supporting Actor Oscars 2024 race is incredibly close, as some major stars are vying for nominations and the chance to win the award.




The Best Supporting Actor race for the Oscars 2024 is expected to be among the most competitive categories, as several excellent performances and actors are in contention. Although the leads of a movie can often receive most of the attention from a performance perspective, supporting roles are just as vital to crafting a great movie. The Academy Awards recognize the best supporting actor performance every year, and this year&#39;s crop of contenders have the task of following up Ke Huy Quan&#39;s 2023 Oscars win for Everything Everywhere All At Once. There are some big names hoping to win in 2024.
The star power assembled for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2024 is quite impressive. While none of these men are competing for the 2024 Oscars&#39; Best Actor category, there are plenty of crossovers in terms of expected nominees and potential winners. The campaigning process is still in its infancy, so what Oscar voters&#39; ballots will look like come January 2024 will change. As a result, this list of the 2024 Oscars&#39; Best Supporting Actor nominations and the predicted winner will be updated as the nomination announcement approaches. Screen Rant&#39;s predicted Best Actor nominees are:
    Actor   Movie    1   Robert Downey Jr.   Oppenheimer    2   Ryan Gosling   Barbie    3   Robert De Niro   Killers of the Flower Moon    4   Charles Melton   May December    5   Mark Ruffalo   Poor Things    
The predicted list of actors up for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year is by no means a lock for how the official nominations will go. There are several other strong contenders that could knock one or two of the expected frontrunners out of their spots, especially if they are tied to any possible Best Picture Oscars 2024 nominees. These are some additional names and performances to keep in mind and be familiar with, as any of them could potentially earn a nomination in 2024.
  Actor   Movie    Willem Dafoe   Poor Things    Dominic Sessa   The Holdovers    Sterling K. Brown   American Fiction    Peter Sarsgaard   Memory    Josh Magaro   Past Lives    Holy McCallany   The Iron Claw    Matt Damon   Oppenheimer    Paul Mescal   All Of Us Strangers    Glenn Howerton   BlackBerry    Jeremy Allen White   The Iron Claw    









 








 5  Mark Ruffalo In Poor Things 
Ruffalo hasn&#39;t been nominated since 2016
        

Mark Ruffalo&#39;s performance in Poor Things is likely to bring him back to the Oscars with another nomination. Yorgos Lanthimos&#39; movies have a history of netting multiple acting nominations from the Academy. With Emma Stone the likely frontrunner for the Best Actress Oscar in 2024, Mark Ruffalo&#39;s hilarious turn as Duncan Wedderburn can give Poor Things even more recognition. Ruffalo and his Poor Things co-star Willem Dafoe earned Golden Globe nominations, but he has the stronger buzz and case for an Oscar nomination at this point.
A Best Supporting Actor nomination for Mark Ruffalo in 2024 would be the fourth such nomination of his career. He was first recognized by the Academy in 2011 for The Kids Are All Right. Ruffalo then secured back-to-back nominations in 2015 and 2016 for his performances in Foxcatcher and Spotlight. However, he has not won the category yet. If he does get nominated for Poor Things, Ruffalo will move into an eight-way tie for the most Best Supporting Actor nominations in Oscars history. Five of these men never won in the category, so Mark Ruffalo would be the sixth if he doesn&#39;t win it all now.





 4  Charles Melton In May December 
This would be Melton&#39;s first Oscar nomination
        

Charles Melton is the newest contender in the Best Supporting Actor category for the 2024 Oscars. The actor has left behind Riverdale to deliver a quiet but complicated performance in Todd Haynes&#39; 2023 movie. He plays Joe Yoo, the husband of Julianne Moore&#39;s Gracie and the father of their two children. The movie examines Joe&#39;s growing unhappiness with his marriage and the realization that the relationship that began when he was in 7th grade was not okay. May December tasks Melton with playing a socially awkward and quietly powerful character with several heartbreaking moments along the way, and he excels at each turn.
If Charles Melton continues his ascension during awards season, this performance will secure him his first Oscar nomination. Despite starring opposite two Oscar winners in Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore, who both could factor into the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscars 2024 races, Melton routinely steals the show. He&#39;s picked up some wins in critics group awards early on, which should help his campaign, even if there is no overlap between the voting bodies. His Golden Globe nomination is similarly a point in his favor.





 3  Robert De Niro in Killers of the Flower Moon 
De Niro&#39;s last nomination in Supporting came in 2013
        

Robert De Niro could add another Oscar nomination to his résumé thanks to Killers of the Flower Moon. His role as William King Hale gives De Niro another powerful, manipulative, and commanding character to bring to life under Martin Scorsese&#39;s direction. Just as Leonardo DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone are viewed as strong contenders for the Best Actor and Best Actress categories, it would be wrong to discount Robert De Niro from becoming a major force in the Best Supporting Actor race for the 2024 Oscars. His Golden Globe nomination proves he&#39;s very much in competition still.
This would be Robert De Niro&#39;s eighth acting nomination overall, with five previously coming for Best Actor and Killers of the Flower Moon making it three Best Supporting Actor nominations. Although he is typically recognized for his leading roles, De Niro&#39;s original Oscars success came in the Best Supporting Actor category with his win in 1975 for The Godfather Part II. His only other nomination in the category came in 2013 for Silver Linings Playbook. Robert De Niro could become only the ninth actor in history to win multiple Best Supporting Actor Oscars if he wins again for his Killers of the Flower Moon performance.





 2  Ryan Gosling in Barbie 
This would be Gosling&#39;s third Oscar nomination
        

Ryan Gosling is among the strongest contenders for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination in 2024. He fully committed to bringing Ken to life, exploring his journey to discovering patriarchy, and that, ultimately, &#34;I am Kenough.&#34; As tremendous as Margot Robbie is in the lead role, much of Barbie&#39;s success can also be attributed to how perfectly Gosling brings all aspects of Ken&#39;s personality to the screen. Let&#39;s not forget the showstopping inclusion of &#34;I&#39;m Just Ken,&#34; either. It is for these reasons that it would not be a complete shock if Gosling is the one ultimately winning the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.
Barbie would be the third time that one of Ryan Gosling&#39;s performances earned an Oscar nomination, but it would be the first in the supporting category. Both of Gosling&#39;s previous Oscar nominations - in 2007 for Half Nelson and in 2017 for La La Land - came in the Best Actor category. While it could have been easy for the Barbie Oscars campaign strategy to argue that Gosling belongs in the Best Actor category again, putting him in supporting likely gives him a better chance to win it all for the first time in his career. With a Golden Globe nomination now secured, it is possible.





 1  Robert Downey Jr. in Oppenheimer (Winner) 
RDJ can finally get his well-deserved Oscar win


 







Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s performance in Oppenheimer has everything it takes to be the predicted Best Supporting Actor winner for the 2024 Oscars at this stage. First and foremost, Downey delivers arguably his best performance in about 15 years by playing Lewis Strauss. The actor also carries a strong narrative for an Oscar campaign, as Oppenheimer is a starkly different role and performance for the actor after spending over a year playing Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The fact that Oppenheimer is also a strong contender for other Oscars 2024 nominations also raises the profile of Downey&#39;s work.
This would be the third Oscar nomination of Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s career. He was originally nominated in 1993 for Best Actor thanks to his work in Chaplin, but he was not nominated by the Academy again until 2009, when his role in Tropic Thunder brought him a Best Supporting Actor nomination. While he fell short of winning the Oscar previously, the odds are seemingly in his favor now. Robert Downey Jr. has partaken in the campaigning process, even earning a Golden Globe nomination, so he could be the ultimate winner of the Oscars 2024 Best Supporting Actor award.
