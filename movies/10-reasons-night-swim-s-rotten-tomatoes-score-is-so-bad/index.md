## Literature Review

While Night Swim has some merits, critics have made it clear why the latest Blumhouse film has received such a disappointing Rotten Tomatoes score.




Summary
 Night Swim&#39;s rushed third act and underdeveloped story disappoints audiences and feels unrewarding. 
 The confusing antagonist and unanswered questions leave viewers wanting more clarity and explanation. 
 The lack of scary scenes and forced tension undermine the potential of the talented cast and premise. 


The new Blumhouse and Universal horror movie Night Swim has high hopes of repeating last year&#39;s M3GAN&#39;s January release success, but critics are not loving the new theatrical release. Night Swim, which hit theaters nationwide on January 5, 2024, follows a family who moves into a nice neighborhood only to be traumatized and taken over by their sentient swimming pool. By the film&#39;s end, the pool is revealed to have a deep history of collecting souls within a seemingly infinite underground reservoir of spring water beneath it which also offers miraculous healing powers.
With a simple yet murky premise, Night Swim isn&#39;t trying to be a rival to some of the more sophisticated or artistic horror installments in recent history such as any of Jordan Peele&#39;s projects or A24&#39;s offerings. Night Swim is certainly enjoyable in parts, with a great cast of Wyatt Russell, Kerry Condon (who was just nominated for an Oscar for last year&#39;s The Banshees of Inisherin, and relative newcomers Amélie Hoeferle and Gavin Warren. Despite some of its merits, Night Swim has opened up with an underwhelming 27% on Rotten Tomatoes.
            
 
 Night Swim Ending Explained 
Night Swim&#39;s ending takes a sinister turn as the Waller family fights back. We break down the horror movie&#39;s ending, and the lore at its center.












 








 10  Rushed 3rd Act 
        

One of the most common complaints about Night Swim is how rushed its final act is, which makes the story altogether feel underdeveloped and like it wasn&#39;t really building to anything rewarding for the audience. The film is able to build and maintain interest throughout its second act, but once the third act starts happening, many of the central issues of Night Swim become apparent. Night Swim tries to slide into the home plate but missed a few bases.





 9  Confusing Antagonist 
        

One of the most confusing aspects of Night Swim is its confusing protagonist. It&#39;s evident that the water is sentient and evil, but what isn&#39;t clear is who exactly the strange ghoulish water people are and what they actually want. The black water has a mind of its own and can crawl inside people to control them neurologically, similar to the black substance in Venom. Outside of these things, there are a lot of unanswered questions pertaining to the antagonist.





 8  Turned Suspense Into Silliness 
        

Night Swim is built on a foundation of suspense, which is why it is pretty entertaining through its first half. The biggest hook of the movie is the mystery of the evil pool water and why it heals some people and kills others. None of that is made entirely clear by the movie&#39;s end, which in turn converts all of the suspense earned through the first half of the film into silliness, as many critics feel that the story bailed out with a half-baked ending.





 7  Cliché Ending 
        

Speaking of Night Swim&#39;s ending, it is about as textbook as it gets, with Wyatt Russell&#39;s father character sacrificing his life for his family. While that&#39;s a sensible way to close out the film, the ending feels woefully anticlimactic and something that we&#39;ve all seen a thousand times before. The lack of imagination in Night Swim&#39;s ending is one of the biggest disappointments of the movie and contributes greatly to its negative critical reception.

 6  Logical Missteps 
        

There are way too many logical missteps that drive the narrative forward in Night Swim, with many internet commenters questioning why the family doesn&#39;t just drain the pool. While the healing properties of the spring water add justification to keeping the pool open, the logical missteps keep adding up throughout the course of Night Swim, leaving many unanswered questions. For example, why was Wyatt Russell&#39;s character chasing his daughter in the third act when he had intended to kill his other kid? The answer seems to be for the sake of the forced &#34;Marco, Polo&#34; scene.





 5  Lack of Scary Scenes 
        

Even for a PG-13 thriller, Night Swim is very tame for a Blumhouse production. Most critics have agreed that the lack of substantial thrills in Night Swim is one of the major reasons why it has gotten such poor reviews. The film is built on tension and suspense, which can be perfectly fine, but the actual horror scenes are mostly limited to a series of jumpscares, which don&#39;t feel entirely deserved or all that scary.





 4  Limited Backstory 
        

There&#39;s not usually that much backstory necessary for most horror movies outside of the information that would help make the antagonist more threatening or provide context to the characters to help audiences understand them better. The most backstory provided in Night Swim is on Wyatt Russell&#39;s character and how he used to play professional baseball until he was diagnosed with MS. Most critics would have liked to see a deeper development of the spring water&#39;s backstory, which is somewhat revealed in a quick scene with Rebecca&#39;s mother later in the film. Still, there is so much untapped potential for evil water lore.

Blumhouse&#39;s chilling horror movie Night Swim continues the studio&#39;s legacy of terror, but will a sequel ever materialize and what would it look like? 








 3  Unclear Character Motivations 
        

Some of the characters, partially the supporting ones, are pretty one-dimensional and don&#39;t have the clearest of motivations. Rebecca&#39;s mom, for example, easily justifies sacrificing her daughter so that her son could be a powerful politician, but what exactly brought her to that decision is not explored other than &#34;the evil water made her do it&#34;. This then jumps over to Wyatt Russell&#39;s character, who has the exact same plan of sacrificing one of his kids so that he can play baseball again. In his case, it seems more like his selfishness has taken the wheel more than the will of the evil water.





 2  Forced Tension 
        

Much of the tension in Night Swim feels forced and often unearned, which is an easy pitfall of any horror movie. Even during some of the most predictable scenes, such as the daughter swimming in the pool with her swim team friend, the tension is built to a mostly unrealized end. Both of the kids and eventually the mother become suspicious of the pool water but wait to do anything about it. It&#39;s these kinds of logical stretches that make the tension in the latter half of Night Swim feel forced and ineffective.





 1  Waste Of Acting Potential 
        

Night Swim has a small but great cast led by Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon that could have elevated the movie to the level of A Quiet Place with Emily Blunt and John Krasinski. The acting talent was certainly there, with Condon easily stealing every scene she is in, but was mostly underutilized throughout the film based on a light script. Night Swim could have been a foundation for another Blumhouse franchise given the talent of its cast. Unless the box office proves otherwise, that might not happen.
