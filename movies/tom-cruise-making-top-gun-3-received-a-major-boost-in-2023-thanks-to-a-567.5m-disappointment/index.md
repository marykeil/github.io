# Tom Cruise Making Top Gun 3 Received A Major Boost In 2023 Thanks To A $567.5M Disappointment


## SUMMARY 




Top Gun: Maverick surpassed all expectations at the box office, proving that there is still a huge audience eager to see Tom Cruise in the cockpit after decades.
            

The underperformance of another Tom Cruise sequel indicates that he needs Top Gun 3 now more than ever, as the Top Gun franchise is his most reliable and guaranteed hit-maker.

While the release date of Top Gun 3 is uncertain due to Cruise&#39;s busy schedule, it is likely to happen no earlier than 2026 and has a strong chance of being a summer blockbuster success.

## Literature Review
The chances of Tom Cruise making Top Gun 3 sooner may have increased considerably after one of the actor&#39;s biggest projects underperformed in 2023.
