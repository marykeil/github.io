## Literature Review

Robert Pattison’s new film, Mickey 17, just lost its premiere date, but the change isn’t as bad as it seems, especially for the film’s famed director.




Although it is typically disappointing when a highly anticipated film&#39;s release date is changed, the fact that Robert Pattinson&#39;s Mickey 17 will be debuting at a later date is actually a good sign, especially for the movie&#39;s director, Bong Joon-ho. Mickey 17 is Robert Pattinson&#39;s upcoming sci-fi movie led by South Korean director, Bong Joon-ho, who earned significant praise for his 2019 horror film, Parasite. The movie follows a &#34;disposable employee&#34; who is sent on a mission to colonize a world made of ice, however, when his body dies, he is given a new one with all his memories still in place.




Mickey 17 is definitely one of the most highly-anticipated films of 2024. Not only does it have a concept that seems nefarious and utterly creepy, but its lead actor and director bring significant hype to the project. Apart from Bong Joon-ho and Robert Pattinson, Mickey 17&#39;s cast also includes Steven Yuen, Toni Collette, Mark Ruffalo, and Naomi Ackie. Furthermore, since this film is Bong Joon-ho&#39;s first after Parasite, which means fans have been waiting 5 years for Mickey 17, so the latest news about its release date might seem absolutely dire.


 Why Bong Joon Ho&#39;s Mickey 17 Doesn&#39;t Have A Release Date Now 
          

For a time, Mickey 17 was set for release on March 29, 2024. However, it was recently announced by The Hollywood Reporter that Godzilla x Kong would be taking that spot for its own release. What this means is that rather than using its original release date, April 12, as planned, Godzilla x Kong is moving its release up to March 29. This boots Mickey 17 from that spot, and therefore, means that the Bong Joon-ho film has no release date anymore. By no means is this a permanent situation though. Mickey 17 will eventually get a new release date.




Although this situation seems quite scary at first glance, it actually makes some sense. Like most projects in development in 2023, Mickey 17 was affected by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. As a result, the film is likely not where it was supposed to be at this time. For example, no trailer has even been released yet for Mickey 17. So, while having its release date taken by Godzilla x Kong may seem like an aggressive measure, it is actually for a good reason that Mickey 17 had to give up their March 29 spot.



 Being Pulled From The Schedule Is Actually The Smartest Idea For The Robert Pattinson Movie 
          

Overall, it really is a good choice for Mickey 17 to get a later release date. If they had kept their March 29 date, Bong Joon-ho likely would have been rushing to finish the film, and working on a tight deadline like that could easily lead to mistakes or bad choices. With more time, Bong Joon-ho has the opportunity to finish the movie with ease, and make decisions that are right for his style and vision. Because this is Bong Joon-ho&#39;s first film after Parasite, audiences will be very attentive to Mickey 17, and therefore, it must be as perfect as possible.
