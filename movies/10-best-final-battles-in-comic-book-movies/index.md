## Literature Review

Comic book movies are known for blockbuster-scale action, but some climactic battles stand above the rest as particularly exciting and memorable.




Comic book movies from the MCU, DCU, and beyond are famed for the dramatic final battle scenes, some of which have become iconic scenes in superhero cinema. Both the DC Universe and the Marvel Cinematic Universe have featured some impressive battle scenes throughout the years. While it&#39;s hard to determine which is the very best, the genre has provided some of the most enthralling final battles ever put to film.
Superhero movies typically end with a climactic final confrontation that pits the hero against their villainous counterpart. The MCU timeline determined an effective formula for this, pitting the hero against a similarly powered antagonist to represent the battle between good and evil. Meanwhile, the DCEU timeline is filled with idiosyncratic foes that counter their heroes&#39; morality, featuring decidedly more superhuman heroes and villains.
