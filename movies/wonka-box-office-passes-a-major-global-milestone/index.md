# Wonka Box Office Passes A Major Global Milestone


## SUMMARY 



  Wonka has now made $400 million worldwide, comprising $147 million from North America and $253 million internationally.   The movie is poised to pass Dune&#39;s $402 million to become the biggest hit of Chalamet&#39;s career.   Wonka&#39;s success is due to strong word of mouth and relatively little competition, but it also confirms that Chalamet is a box office draw.

## Literature Review

After releasing last month, Paul King’s Wonka, which stars Timothée Chalamet as the titular chocolatier, has just passed a big box office milestone.




Wonka&#39;s global box office continues to climb, and the film has now soared past another major milestone. Directed by Paul King, the new film serves as a prequel to Roald Dahl&#39;s beloved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Timothée Chalamet leads the Wonka cast as the eponymous chocolatier in a story that chronicles one of his earliest adventures, before he became the figure of legend.




Now, Collider reports that Wonka&#39;s box office sits at an impressive $400 million worldwide, comprising $147 million domestically and $253 million from overseas territories. While there was initially some question regarding how the film would perform, the latest figures cement the project as a major success, contributing to a strong few weeks for Warner Bros. Wonka&#39;s box office is poised to surpass the total global earnings of Chalamet&#39;s other recent hit, Dune, which sits at $402 million.

How The Movie Confirms A Timothée Chalamet Theory
          

It&#39;s now been over 18 years since Tim Burton&#39;s somewhat divisive Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was released, and over 52 years since Mel Stuart&#39;s well-regarded Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, meaning King&#39;s prequel was far from a sure bet. While Dahl&#39;s source material remains beloved, it wasn&#39;t clear if younger audiences have the same relationship to it that perhaps older audiences do.




Part of Wonka&#39;s success certainly speaks to the continued value of the IP, but it also cements Chalamet as a true movie star. Prior to release, the film was positioned as a true test of the actor&#39;s ability to open a film, and its success confirms his status as a box office draw. Few young actors have achieved such a position in the new blockbuster movie landscape, but, after Little Women and Dune, Chalamet has evidently become a figure whose star power can sell a movie.

Wonka&#39;s positive reviews are also a factor in the film&#39;s success, of course, with audiences and critics alike mostly enjoying the film. The holiday release was also well-timed, with the movie representing the only real family-friendly blockbuster in theaters at a time when families were looking for activities to do together during the winter break. In addition to strong word-of-mouth, the lack of any major competition this month is another big contributing factor in terms of Wonka&#39;s strong legs.
