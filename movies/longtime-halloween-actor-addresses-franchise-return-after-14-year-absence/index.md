## Literature Review

A longtime Halloween actor from the 1980s expresses interest in returning to the iconic horror franchise following their last appearance in 2009.




Halloween actor Danielle Harris addresses a possible return to the franchise following her 14-year absence. A certified scream queen, Harris is known for her roles in four entries in the Halloween franchise. She first starred as Jamie Lloyd, the daughter of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), in 1988&#39;s Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers and 1989&#39;s Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. Over a decade later, Harris returned as a different character, Annie Brackett, an acquaintance of Laurie, in Rob Zombie&#39;s 2007 remake, Halloween, and its 2009 sequel, Halloween II.




Now, following another 14-year absence, Harris addressed a possible return to the Halloween franchise during a recent interview with ComicBook.com. The actor expressed interest in returning as Jamie Lloyd and said it would be a great idea to continue the story as a television series, similar to Chucky. Read her full comments below:


I&#39;m hoping for a Jamie Lloyd comeback, to be honest. I&#39;m happy that it&#39;s not over. Not that I ever thought it was going to be over by any means. I&#39;m looking forward to seeing sort of the universe that is open and is there and it&#39;d be really interesting to see them finish the timelines with all the different characters because that would be an awesome television series or something. I think that&#39;s kind of the new way that a lot of these franchises are going, so it&#39;d be nice to have more than 90 minutes, show characters and relationship and Michael and all of that stuff. I don&#39;t expect it to be like killing everybody if they do a series. It&#39;s not going to be killing everyone in every episode, but it&#39;d be nice for it to gradually grow into a story and have 13 episodes, or season after season, like Chucky. I mean, it&#39;s such a fantastic idea. It&#39;d be fun to have Michael in your house more than just on Halloween.






 What Is The Future Of The Halloween Franchise? 
          

David Gordon Green&#39;s trilogy, which served as a sequel to John Carpenter&#39;s original Halloween from 1978, wrapped up with Halloween Ends in 2022. Since then, there has been a major development regarding the future of the long-running horror franchise. Following the release of Ends, the last Halloween movie from Blumhouse Productions, the franchise rights reverted back to producer Malek Akkad. In October 2023, Miramax acquired the rights to the franchise and teamed with Trancas International Films to reportedly develop a Halloween TV show, just as Harris suggests.

                  Halloweenâ€™s Franchise Future Is Promising, But It Will Only Work With Michael Myers   The future of the Halloween franchise is looking bright again, but it can only work if Michael Myers continues to be the main villain.   




It&#39;s unclear who a potential Halloween TV series would follow, though it likely won&#39;t be Laurie Strode after David Gordon Green&#39;s trilogy seemingly ended her story. On the other hand, the franchise&#39;s iconic slasher, Michael Myers, is likely to return in some form. It&#39;s also unclear which continuity a potential Halloween TV series would follow considering it has been rebooted multiple times. However, without Laurie Strode, her daughter, Jamie Lloyd, would be a serviceable replacement as the primary protagonist for the future of the Halloween franchise.
