# Avatar 3 Is The Real Test Of James Cameron s Sequel Plan, And It Will Define Avatar 4 &amp; 5


## SUMMARY 


 

Avatar 3, titled The Seed Bearer, will test James Cameron&#39;s sequel plan for the franchise, following the success of the first two films.


The long delay between Avatar and its sequel allowed for perfection in every detail, making the release of The Way of Water a cultural milestone.


While Cameron has thoroughly developed the next three sequels, the challenge will be maintaining interest without the &#34;rare spectacle&#34; factor. However, betting against Cameron is usually a poor decision.
