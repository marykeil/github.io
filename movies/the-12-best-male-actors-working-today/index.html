<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From Hugh Jackman to Mahershala Ali, veteran of the screen to relative newcomers, these are the best male actors working in Hollywood today.</p>
<p>While there are fantastic movie talents across the history of the industry, the best male actors working today have provided audiences with some of the most memorable performances and moments in recent memory. From television to movies, there are always standout performances that make a huge impact and introduce new talents to the audience or perhaps remind them of their talents. There are actors working now that always inspire confidence in the audience thanks to their reputation for delivering stellar performances and establishing themselves among the very best male actors.
Some of these actors are now veterans of the industry while others have only come to prominence in the 21st century. Some won audiences over with big franchises before showing their acting chops in other roles while others disappeared into their versatile roles with each new project. While it can be hard to narrow such a collection of actors down, these modern actors are certainly the best in the business.</p>
<p>The 50 Best Movies Of All Time
Screen Rant breaks down the 50 best movies of all time, which are based on original scores weighted by rankings from IMDb and Metacritic.</p>
<p>12  Daniel Kaluuya
Notable Performances: Get Out, Widows, Judas And The Black Messiah</p>
<p>Daniel Kaluuya gained attention with his powerhouse performance in the Black Mirror episode &ldquo;Fifteen Million Merits.&rdquo; He then proceeded to stand out in smaller roles in Sicario and Black Panther but fully stepped into the spotlight with his complex and raw Oscar-nominated performance in Get Out. Kaluuya was essential to that movie&rsquo;s success, grounding the intense and bizarre concepts with a sympathetic character.
He further stunned audiences with a heel-turn role as a chilling villain in Widows. Kaluuya won an Oscar for his performance in Judas and the Black Messiah, combining charisma and strength that further showed his astonishing range. Even voice acting roles in projects like Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse stole the show and showcased Kaluuya&rsquo;s talent.</p>
<p>11  Hugh Jackman
Notable Performances: Logan, Les Misérables, Prisoners</p>
<p>Australian actor Hugh Jackman is most well known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men movie series, a role Jackman will be returning to in Deadpool 3. However, he is also an accomplished stage performer and an actor who also regularly stars on Broadway.
Many hear Hugh Jackman and think &ldquo;action hero&rdquo; and while he played his fair share of action roles besides Wolverine, his musical work is where he has found the most acclaim. He won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar for his leading role in Les Misérables, and received Tony and Grammy awards for The Boy from Oz and The Greatest Showman respectively.</p>
<p>10  Tom Hanks
Notable Performances: Cast Away, Forrest Gump, Captain Phillips</p>
<p>Tom Hanks has been one of the most beloved American actors for decades now, going back to his first Oscar-nominated role in the body-swap comedy Big. Since then, Hanks has amassed several other accolades, including back-to-back Oscar wins for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. He plays relatable heroes in movies like Saving Private Ryan and Apollo 13 while charming audiences in rom-com favorites like Sleepless in Seattle and You&rsquo;ve Got Mail.
In the 21st century, Hanks continues to blend immense charisma with &ldquo;everyman&rdquo; reliability including his raw performance in Captain Phillips. Even for divisive performances like in Elvis, which earned him a Razzie nomination, there were plenty who praised its brilliance.</p>
<p>9  Gary Oldman
Notable Performances: Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Darkest Hour, Mank</p>
<p>Gary Oldman is renowned for his versatility. His ability to inhabit roles, from villains to down-and-out heroes, has made him one of the most prolific actors working today. He embraces theatricality in roles like Dracula but then can play internal performances like George Smiley in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. In 2017, he transformed to play Winston Churchill in Joe Wright&rsquo;s Darkest Hour, winning Best Actor at the Oscars. He has given acclaimed roles in big franchises like Commissioner Gordon in The Dark Knight trilogy and Sirius Black in the Harry Potter trilogy.</p>
<p>8  Mahershala Ali
Notable Performances: Moonlight, Green Book, Swan Song</p>
<p>Mahershala Ali was a dependable character actor for many years, working with acclaimed filmmakers like David Fincher and Derek Cianfrance. However, like many great actors, as soon as he was given the right roles, his incredible talent became undeniable. The first of those roles came with Barry Jenkins&rsquo; Best Picture winner Moonlight.
Despite having a small role, Ali commanded the movie and won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Only two years later, he won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in Green Book. Ali has immense talent and will likely reach movie star status with his role in the upcoming MCU Blade movie.</p>
<p>7  Samuel L. Jackson
Notable Performances: The Avengers. Pulp Fiction, Django Unchained</p>
<p>Samuel L. Jackson is one of Hollywood&rsquo;s highest-grossing actors (via Ticket Source) with franchises ranging from Star Wars to the MCU to Jurassic Park. Of course, the money attached to his name is not the reason Jackson is a great actor, but rather a reminder of how the biggest projects want his screen presence. Few actors can command the screen the same way Jackson does.
Jackson&rsquo;s two separate deliveries of the famous Ezekiel 25:17 speech in Pulp Fiction show how he owns the scene, playing both boisterous and reserved equally well. From leading roles to ensembles to cameos, when Jackson is on the screen, he has the audience&rsquo;s full attention and it has been that way for decades.</p>
<p>6  Robert Downey Jr.
Notable Performances: Iron Man, Tropic Thunder, Oppenheimer</p>
<p>Robert Downey Jr. has had a rollercoaster of a career, from teen movie star to cautionary tale to playing fan-favorite Iron Man in the MCU. Downey&rsquo;s funny and energetic performance set the tone for the MCU and is a big reason it got off the ground at all. He is a fearless performer, as seen with his Oscar-nominated role in Tropic Thunder.
Even in huge blockbusters, he brings a sense of humanity that can be overlooked but is essential. As much as fans love him as Iron Man, many are thrilled to see him return to a variety of roles including his role in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Oppenheimer which has recently won him a Golden Globe.</p>
<p>5  Brad Pitt
Notable Performances: Fight Club, Inglourious Basterds, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</p>
<p>Transitioning from heartthrob to serious actor, Brad Pitt is certainly a true movie star. Yet with his good looks and popularity among fans, Pitt has always been willing to take on daring projects that aren&rsquo;t the typical safe choices for an A-lister. For example, collaborations with David Fincher, like Fight Club and Se7en, deliberately challenge audiences.
Pitt is not afraid of embracing his goofiness, as in Burn After Reading and Inglourious Basterds, but he can also be effortlessly cool as in his Oscar-winning role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. His career has only gotten more impressive because he refuses to play it safe.</p>
<p>4  Christian Bale
Notable Performances: The Dark Knight, The Fighter, Vice</p>
<p>Christian Bale&rsquo;s commitment to his roles is legendary. Despite becoming a household name after playing Batman in the Dark Knight franchise, Bale is still able to disappear into a character with shocking effectiveness. The fact that he could play both Patrick Bateman and Batman is a small sign of his versatility. Bale&rsquo;s body transformations are well-known going from extremes like The Machinist to Vice.
However, simply looking at that aspect of his acting does a disservice to the performances themselves. Bale won his first Oscar for The Fighter, showing off his humorous side while still creating a layered and complex character. He has received three more Oscar nominations in the decade or so since that first victory.</p>
<p>3  Joaquin Phoenix
Notable Performances: Walk The Line, Her, The Joker</p>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix has been an intense and riveting actor for many years with committed and exhilarating performances. Ever since his Oscar-nominated role in Gladiator, Phoenix has been a sought-after actor by some of the hottest directors in Hollywood, including Paul Thomas Anderson, Spike Jonze, and Lynne Ramsay.
His transformative performance as Johnny Cash in Walk the Line showed how much he could disappear into a role while his Oscar-winning turn as Arthur Fleck in Joker was seen as a defining performance. Phoenix is the rare actor whose involvement in any movie immediately makes it a must-see.</p>
<p>2  Leonardo DiCaprio
Notable Performances: The Aviator, The Wolf Of Wall Street, The Revenant</p>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio has cemented his place in history as one of the greatest actors ever. DiCaprio earned his first Academy Award nomination at 19 for his role in What&rsquo;s Eating Gilbert Grape? and became a household name for his role in Titanic. While the actor is also known for starring in biopics, DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s collaborations have produced some of his best movies, including The Wolf of Wall Street and, The Departed.
Their latest collaboration with Killers of the Flower Moon is another acclaimed project featuring a wildly different performance from the actor. DiCaprio&rsquo;s talents have attracted the likes of acclaimed directors Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, Alejandro González Iñárritu, and Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>1  Denzel Washington
Notable Performances: Glory Malcolm X, Training Day</p>
<p>A veteran of stage and screen, Denzel Washington is one of the most accomplished actors in history, and stands in rarified air as one of only seven actors to be nominated for an Academy Award in five different decades. Washington&rsquo;s range is something to behold, as his ability to be funny, cruel, and charming all at once truly sets him apart.
Washington&rsquo;s role in Training Day is a perfect example of the peak of his powers and earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. His movie adaptions of plays have also been a showcase for Washington, who shines in leading roles in Fences and The Tragedy of Macbeth, further proving his impressive versatility.</p>
