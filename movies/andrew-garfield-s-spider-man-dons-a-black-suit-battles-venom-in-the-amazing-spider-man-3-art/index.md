## Literature Review

As the world still wants to see The Amazing Spider-Man 3 happen, new fan art imagines Andrew Garfield&#39;s hero getting the Venom symbiote suit.




Andrew Garfield&#39;s version of the iconic Marvel hero bonds with the Venom symbiote as he gets his own version of the black suit in new The Amazing Spider-Man 3 fan art. While The Amazing Spider-Man 3 got canceled, 2014 wouldn&#39;t be the last time Garfield got to play the web-slinger. In 2021, Garfield entered the MCU timeline via Spider-Man: No Way Home, which saw him join forces with Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland&#39;s respective hero iterations in what would become one of the biggest superhero movies of all time.




Following his appearance in the Spider-Man: No Way Home cast, fans are actively campaigning for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 to get made, allowing Garfield to complete his own trilogy. One popular idea for The Amazing Spider-Man 3 is seeing Peter explore the symbiote, as Pablo Ruiz &amp; Erathrim shared fan art of what that story could look like for him.


 

Ruiz&#39;s The Amazing Spider-Man 3 fan art sees Garfield&#39;s Peter beginning to bond with the symbiote as it slowly consumes him. While it never appeared in the theatrical cut, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 marketing did at one point include the symbiote.


 




The Amazing Spider-Man 3 fan art by Erathrim sees Garfield&#39;s web-crawler not only donning the black suit, but also being pitted against Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom. Erathrim also cleverly added the caption &#34;I want to fight an alien!&#34; from Spider-Man: No Way Home, when Garfield&#39;s Peter expressed that he wanted to take on an extraterrestrial being like his Spider-Man variants.

 Will Andrew Garfield&#39;s Spider-Man Ever Appear On-Screen Again? 
         

The question that remains is whether or not The Amazing Spider-Man 3 will ever happen, or if there are other ways for Garfield&#39;s hero to return in future live-action projects. For the time being, The Amazing Spider-Man 3&#39;s chances appear slim to none, as Spider-Man&#39;s movie endeavors are split between Holland&#39;s Spider-Man 4 and Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse. Even though Garfield has expressed being open to another movie, Sony hasn&#39;t currently shown any hints that they are thinking of pursuing The Amazing Spider-Man 3.




However, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse did include a brief cameo by Garfield, through archival footage, showing his franchise being tied to the animated property. This paves the way for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse to feature a proper appearance by his Spider-Man, as the Spider-Verse movies are confirmed to be able to tap between live-action and animation. There is also the option for Marvel Studios to collaborate with Sony Pictures again and have Garfield&#39;s Spider-Man show up in something like Avengers: Secret Wars as they get to the end of The Multiverse Saga.



While Garfield is not getting a sequel, there have been rumors about Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man 4 possibly happening at Sony.




Given the massive love for Garfield&#39;s Spider-Man, it would be genuinely shocking if the character was never brought back in some capacity, even if it takes a few years. Whether that is a Marvel Studios multiverse movie or The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Garfield will hopefully suit up as the beloved Marvel superhero sooner rather than later.
