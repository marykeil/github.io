Summary
 Good Grief combines humor and drama to explore loss, grief, and chosen family. 
 The film highlights the complexities of romantic relationships and the potential for hurt even in open marriages. 
 The importance of embracing emotions and the healing power of love are central themes in Good Grief. 


As written and directed by Dan Levy, Good Grief is a film that combines sardonic humor and drama to tell a poignant story with quotes about loss, grief, and chosen family. Levy stars as Marc who, after throwing his husband Oliver (Luke Evans) a rousing Christmas party, has to watch helplessly from the window of their flat as his cab gets involved in a horrific accident. Devastated by Oliver&#39;s death, Marc can only bring himself to open Oliver&#39;s Christmas card a year later, but after clinging to it as the last vestige of their time together, he discovers its contents reveal another emotional blow; Oliver met someone else.
Discovering Oliver kept an apartment in Paris to see his lover, Marc decides to go there with his two friends Thomas (Himesh Patel) and Sophie (Ruth Negga) under the guise that they deserve a vacation after so much mourning. Eventually, the pair discover the truth, and goodwill between the principal characters in Good Grief devolves in one night of messy secrets being exposed.By the end of Good Grief, Levy uses irony, humor, and the romantic backdrop of Paris to reveal how the true love of friendship prevails when friends hold each other accountable, and that sometimes there is such a thing as &#34;good grief&#34; in the process of healing.









 








 10  &#34;How Is It Your Husband Dying Has Only Made You More Of A Spoiled Brat?&#34; 
Thomas To Marc
        

Levy&#39;s script injects pithy, biting humor into many of Good Grief&#39;s best quotes, such as this one Thomas makes at Marc&#39;s expense when the latter complains about something materialistic and seemingly inconsequential in the wake of his husband&#39;s death. Not only is it a funny line, but it effectively communicates the sort of friendship that the two characters have; it&#39;s strong enough to sustain what would be perceived as an insulting and inappropriate accusation from anyone else. As in Levy&#39;s spirited sitcom Schitt&#39;s Creek, ironic humor is used strategically in Good Grief to make complicated situations accessible.





 9  &#34;I Agreed To An Open Marriage Out Of Fear, Not Trust.&#34; 
Marc To Luca
        

While it&#39;s a startling bombshell for both Marc and viewers when he reads the shocking contents of Oliver&#39;s Christmas card, an even bigger bombshell arrives near the end of the film during a conversation he has with Oliver&#39;s lover, Luca. As it turns out, Marc entered into an open marriage with Oliver because, &#34;He asked, and the idea of giving him a reason to leave felt scarier than keeping him happy, so that’s what I did.&#34; Not only is this compelling storytelling, but it also points to the wild and varied complexity of romantic relationships, and how even with candor around the subject of polyamory, partners can still get hurt.





 8  &#34;People Feel Things That Are Inconvenient, Thomas.&#34; 
Sophie To Thomas


 







Sophie is one of the most bombastic characters in Good Grief and gives the film much of its chaotic energy, particularly since much of her storyline revolves around a tumultuous breakup with her boyfriend Terrence. Thomas accuses her of letting her emotions override her better judgment and living a capricious life without direction, which he suspects lead to Terrence leaving her. Sophie reminds him that life is not black and white and that the nuances of relationships have to be grasped for partners to empathize with one another and grow, something he isn&#39;t ready to admit to because then he&#39;d have to acknowledge he&#39;s still in love with Marc.





 7  &#34;Sometimes You Have To Do Things You Don’t Want To Do To Get To Where You Want To Go.&#34; 
Thomas To Marc &amp; Sophie
        

Thomas often acts as the voice of reason between Marc and Sophie, curtailing their impulsive actions by reminding them what roles discipline and objectivity should play in their lives, such as working at an art gallery before he can own his own. By the end of the film, however, Thomas realizes that the way he orders his life and worldview isn&#39;t the way that others should, and Marc and Sophie realize Thomas&#39;s tough pep talks are a sign of love rather than consternation or disapproval. But his basic sentiment does hold merit when certain concessions and compromises are often expected on the road to success in life.





 6  &#34;Sometimes You Lose Sight Of What’s Going On Around You Because You Just Want To Breathe The Same Way You Did Before.&#34; 
Marc To Imelda
        

Meetings between Marc and his financial adviser Imelda (Celia Imrie) punctuate critical junctures of Good Grief, and she offers brisk counsel to him in the wake of Oliver&#39;s death regarding both his personal affairs and Oliver&#39;s estate. This Good Grief quote is an example of Levy giving simple insight into the human condition by addressing the different ways grief can affect a person over time. These adroit lines of dialogue come across as profound in their directness, and they give a voice to a feeling about the process of grief that so many viewers have experienced at different times in their lives but might not have known how to express.





 5  &#34;Isn’t Art A Kind Of Commemoration Of Pain? Where Does It Go Otherwise?&#34; 
Theo To Marc


 







Marc meets a Frenchman named Theo (Arnaud Valois) who has a concise and thoughtful approach to life&#39;s problems, cutting right through Marc&#39;s neurosis to the heart of his concerns, such as his decision to stop painting because it reminds him of his mother&#39;s passing. During a date on which they spend the night and part of the morning wandering through the streets of Paris, Theo encourages Marc to pick up painting again because it will be a way to help heal from his mother&#39;s death rather than avoid it, as well as work through the pain of losing Oliver too.





 4  &#34;Sober And Selfish. Oh My God, That’s The Title Of My Memoir.&#34; 
Sophie To Marc &amp; Thomas
        

After a harrowing night out in Paris in which she ends up spending the night alone at a bus stop, Sophie decides that she&#39;s going to get sober. Levy imbues Sophie with even more complexity and intrigue once she takes agency over her life when she realizes that what she perceived as independence from leaving Terrence was just her running away from her responsibilities. Taking control of the messier aspects of her life and ownership over her part in the dissolution of her relationship with Terrence makes her intrepid personality even more appealing.





 3  &#34;It’s Not A Light Thing To Know That Your Child Succeeded In Spite Of You.&#34; 
Oliver&#39;s Dad During His Eulogy
        

One of the most poignant moments comes in the first quarter of the film, when Oliver&#39;s dad, Duncan (David Bradley) gives a touching eulogy at his funeral. He explains that Oliver wanted to write about princesses on quests as a boy when he thought he should write about more masculine things, never realizing how much he was curbing his son&#39;s talent and enthusiasm. That Oliver succeeded with a popular book series about a strong female hero highlights how much he earned despite his father&#39;s discouragement and initial homophobia, which makes Duncan&#39;s public admittance so heart-wrenching.





 2  &#34;I’ve Been Lying A Long Time To A Lot Of People And It Feels Really Heavy. Like I’m Swimming With My Clothes On, And I Can’t Take Them Off.&#34; 
Marc To Imelda
        

One of the best Good Grief quotes is relatable to anyone who has experienced the timeline of grief before, which seems to ebb and flow at random, and which often demands a heavy emotional toll from anyone trapped in its current. Marc reveals to Imelda that he&#39;s been lying about his feelings to protect himself, but this approach has created a weight of guilt, and he has to learn that there&#39;s no right or wrong way to feel when confronting a loss of this magnitude. He can be upset with Oliver for his actions while still loving and missing him, and all the feelings are acceptable.





 1  &#34;To Avoid Sadness Is Also To Avoid Love.&#34; 
Imelda To Marc
        

In their final meeting, Imelda reveals to Marc that she lost her wife twelve years ago and the grief inspired her to throw herself into her work, start a business, and build a life that would be impregnable to how much pain she was in. In doing what she could to not feel sad, she closed herself off from other subsequent emotions and ended up feeling empty and lifeless. The best quote from Good Grief carries the message of the film; truncating feelings to not feel the pain of loss will also ensure that a person won&#39;t experience the best emotions life has to offer, especially love.
