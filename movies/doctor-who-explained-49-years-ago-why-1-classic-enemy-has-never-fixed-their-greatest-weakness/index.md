# Doctor Who Explained 49 Years Ago Why 1 Classic Enemy Has Never Fixed Their Greatest Weakness


## SUMMARY 

The Sontarans are Doctor Who villains with a weakness in their armor, specifically the probic vent on the back of their necks.


Their refusal to fix this flaw is due to their egos, as they see facing their enemies with this weakness as a test of their combat prowess.


The Sontarans have become less prominent compared to other iconic villains like the Daleks, possibly because of their unwillingness to evolve and adapt.
