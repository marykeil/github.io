Summary

  Despite criticism and financial disappointment, Exodus: Gods and Kings is now a global hit on Netflix.   The movie landed at No. 4 on Netflix&#39;s most-watched English-language movies list, with 7.4 million views.   The movie is the oldest title on the list, alongside more contemporary Netflix hits.  





Exodus: Gods and Kings has become a global hit on Netflix. The 2014 movie, which was directed by Ridley Scott, is a biblical epic following the story of Moses, featuring an ensemble cast that includes Christian Bale, Joel Edgerton, John Turturro, Aaron Paul, Ben Mendelsohn, Sigourney Weaver, and Ben Kingsley. Amid widespread accusations of whitewashing the story, the movie garnered a dismal 31% Rotten Tomatoes score and went on to become a financial flop, only earning $268.2 million despite an estimated budget of roughly $200 million.




Netflix has now calculated their global Top 10 list of the most-watched English-language movies for the week of January 1 through January 7. Exodus: Gods and Kings landed at No. 4 on the chart thanks to 7.4 million views amassing a total of 18.6 million hours viewed. The Ridley Scott movie is the oldest title on the list, which also includes contemporary Netflix hits such as Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, Leave the World Behind, and Leo.

 Exodus: Gods And Kings&#39; Box Office Failure Explained 
Exodus didn&#39;t make enough to earn back its exorbitant budget
         

The nature of the box office failure of Exodus: Gods and Kings is somewhat unusual. By earning that $268.2 million total, it became the 32nd highest-grossing movie of the year worldwide, outgrossing other major movies of the time including Annabelle, Liam Neeson&#39;s Non-Stop, Into the Woods, and the Oscar-winning The Imitation Game. However, its estimated budget range means that its break-even point lay somewhere between $280 million and $400 million, and possibly even higher, as the rule of thumb is that a movie needs to earn back at least twice its production budget.




Thus, the failure of Ridley Scott&#39;s Exodus is entirely relative. For instance, Annabelle became a huge hit by earning $257.6 million because it boasted a much tinier budget of just $6.5 million. Exodus&#39; box office numbers mean there was widespread audience interest in the biblical epic, just not enough to make it profitable, due to the huge financial risk it took with its lavish production. Below, check out how Exodus compares with the budgets and overall worldwide grosses of the 2014 movies directly above and below it on the chart.

 Rank  Title  Production Budget  Worldwide Gross   #29  Paddington  $65 million  $282.8 million   #30  Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman  $145 million  $275.7 million   #31  Neighbors  $18 million  $270.7 million   #32  Exodus: Gods and Kings  $140-$200 million  $268.2 million   #33  Annabelle  $6.5 million  $257.6 million   #34  Hercules  $100 million  $244.8 million   #35  RoboCop  $100-$130 million  $242.6 million   






At least four 2014 titles in that box office range could be considered commercial successes. Exodus&#39; failure ultimately stemmed from its inability to draw exceptionally huge crowds, which is likely due to the widely publicized whitewashing controversy swirling around the movie at the time of release, which led to some social media users calling for a boycott. The movie&#39;s 35% Rotten Tomatoes audience score also indicates that viewers were as displeased as critics, though its streaming availability may have now stripped away some of the inherent negative biases involved in spending money on a ticket for a disappointing movie.



 Ridley Scott&#39;s Post-Exodus Career Explained 
Scott bounced back with critical and commercial hits like The Martian and The Last Duel
         

While Exodus: Gods and Kings was a setback for the director, he quickly turned his prospects around. The following year, Ridley helmed the big-budget science fiction adaptation The Martian, featuring Matt Damon and a huge star-studded ensemble cast. In addition to becoming the tenth highest-grossing movie of 2015 worldwide, the movie was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture.






The Martian cast also included Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael PeÃ±a, Sean Bean, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Benedict Wong, Donald Glover, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.




That movie already pulled his career back from the brink to which Exodus (which is his second worst-rated directorial feature on Rotten Tomatoes, behind A Good Year) had pushed it. However, he also followed it with a variety of movies that were either critical successes, commercial successes, or both. This includes the 2017 Alien franchise entry Alien: Covenant and his 2021 duo The Last Duel and House of Gucci. His most recent movie, the historical epic Napoleon, also recently became the 24th highest-grossing movie of 2023.

The streaming success of Exodus: Gods and Kings may have something to do with all the ways the director&#39;s public reception has changed in the decade since its original release. This could spell good news for the reception of his many future projects, as well. This includes the upcoming Gladiator 2 and the action-thriller BOMB.
