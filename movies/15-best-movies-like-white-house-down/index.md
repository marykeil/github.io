Along with it being the second Die Hard-in-the-White House action movie that came out in 2013, there are plenty of other movies like White House Down to please fans of the genre. White House Down stars Channing Tatum as aspiring Capitol police officer John Cale and Jamie Foxx as the President of the United States James Sawyer. They team up to rescue Cale’s daughter and save DC from a paramilitary terrorist threat. The movie is often unfavorably compared to Olympus Has Fallen given their near-identical plots. However, for those who have more affinity for this star-studded thriller, there are other similar action movies out there.
The best movies like White House Down are all full of heart-pumping thrills that have defined the genre since Die Hard and other action movies of the 1980s.

 15  Olympus Has Fallen (2013) 
Gerard Butler Must Have The President From Hostage-Takers
        

 Olympus Has Fallen 
Olympus Has Fallen an action thriller film and is the first in the franchise. The film follows former army ranger/special service agent Mike Banning who lost his position after the death of the President&#39;s wife. When a North Korean terrorist group attacks the White House, Banning must tune back into his old skill set to save the president and the country from nuclear devastation.
 Release Date   March 21, 2013    Director   Antoine Fuqua    Cast   Morgan Freeman , Gerard Butler , Aaron Eckhart , Rick Yune    Runtime   120minutes    




In Olympus Has Fallen, Gerard Butler cemented his reputation as one of modern movie history&#39;s top action stars with his performance as Secret Service agent Mike Banning, who must rescue US President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) from a presidential hostage situation in the White House. Combined with over-the-top action movie dialogue and set pieces, this is an entertaining thriller from start to finish. The movie&#39;s plot similarities with White House Down are immediately obvious and Olympus Has Fallen ended up being a bigger box office success on a smaller budget, prompting two sequels, London Has Fallen and Angel Has Fallen. Butler is slated to return as Banning for Night Has Fallen.

 14  Speed (1994) 
Keanu Reeves Boards A Bus With A Bomb


Close







 Speed 
In Jan de Bont&#39;s 1994 action thriller Speed, LAPD officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) works alongside passenger Annie (Sandra Bullock) to safely stop a bus that will explode if it goes below 50 mph.
 Release Date   June 10, 1994    Director   Jan de bont    Cast   Dennis Hopper , Sandra Bullock , Joe Morton , Jeff Daniels , Keanu Reeves    Runtime   116 minutes    




While Keanu Reeves is currently one of the biggest action stars of the 21st century thanks to the John Wick franchise, he also ruled the genre in the &#39;90s with Speed as one of his best outings. Reeves plays Jack Taven, a hotshot cop who must work with passenger Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) to save a bus full of innocent people that is armed with a bomb that will blow if the bus slows down. The fun premise makes great use of the small setting, allowing for a fast-paced action ride. Like White House Down, it supplements the action with a good sense of humor that entertains while never taking away from the high stakes of the story.

 13  In The Line Of Fire (1993) 
Clint Eastwood Is An Aging Secret Service Agent
        

 In the Line of Fire 
 Release Date   July 8, 1993    Director   Wolfgang Petersen    Cast   Clint Eastwood , John Malkovich , Rene Russo , Dylan McDermott    Runtime   2h 8m    




Tatum&#39;s John Cale is a fun hero for White House Down, but likely the best Secret Service hero in action movie history is Frank Horrigan from In the Line of Fire. Clint Eastwood plays the veteran agent who is called back into duty when there is a new threat on the life of the president. The movie effectively addresses Eastwood&#39;s age in the role, adding an interesting element of Frank being haunted by guilt over failing to save JFK from his assassination. It is an effective taut thriller with moments of fun 90s action movie vibes. However, the highlight of the movie is John Malkovich&#39;s Oscar-nominated role as the would-be assassin.

 12  Skyscraper (2018) 
Dwayne Johnson Fights To Save His Family From Villains Inside A Burning Building
        

 Skyscraper 
Dwayne Johnson stars in the action thriller Skyscraper as Will Sawyer, a former FBI agent who must rescue his family from a high-tech skyscraper, which has been taken over by terrorists. The 2018 movie draws inspiration from similar movies such as The Towering Inferno and Die Hard.
 Release Date   July 13, 2018    Director   Rawson Marshall Thurber    Cast   Matt O&#39;Leary , McKenna Roberts , Neve Campbell , Roland Møller , Noah Taylor , Pablo Schreiber , Byron Mann , Dwayne Johnson , Kevin Rankin    Runtime   103minutes    




With disaster movie veteran Roland Emmerich at the helm of White House Down, it is not surprising it goes for a lot of over-the-top and ridiculous action. This is a similar approach to many of Dwayne Johnson&#39;s action movies, including the similar lone hero adventure of Skyscraper. Johnson plays Will Sawyer, a security expert who must save his family from a high-tech building controlled by dangerous criminals all while the building burns. Skyscraper is another movie that owes more than a little to Die Hard but its silly blockbuster tone feels more akin to White House Down.





 11  Red Dawn (1984) 
Young Rebels Fight Off Soviet Invaders
        

 Red Dawn 
Red Dawn, starring the likes of Patrick Swayze, Charlie Sheen, and Lea Thompson, imagines World War III becoming a reality and a group of teenagers known as Wolverines fighting back against the Soviets. The film received mixed reviews but is notable for being the first PG-13 rated film to be released in the United States. In 2012, a remake was released starring Chris Hemsworth.
 Release Date   August 10, 1984    Director   John Milius    Cast   jennifer grey , Patrick swayze , Lea Thompson , C. Thomas Howell , Charlie Sheen    Runtime   114 minutes    




The idea of enemies attacking the heart of America as seen in White House Down is an idea that has become popular in a lot of action movies. However, the movie most famous for this is Red Dawn. The 1980s action movie imagines a scenario in which the Soviet Union successfully invades the United States leaving a band of young rebels to fight back against the conquerors. With a cast of young &#39;80s stars like Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey, and Charlie Sheen, the movie places itself well in this iconic era of action movies, being ridiculous enough to have fun with but taking itself seriously enough to be thrilling.

 10  Taken (2008) 
Liam Neeson Goes On A Warpath To Save His Daughter
        

 Taken 
Taken stars Liam Neeson as ex-Green Beret and ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills, who retired from his life of fighting in order to be there for his family. When his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Paris and is kidnapped by human traffickers, Mills launches into action, mounting a one-man rescue mission that sees him tear through gangs of European criminals with extreme prejudice in hopes of finding and rescuing Kim before it&#39;s too late.
 Release Date   January 30, 2009    Director   Pierre Morel    Cast   Liam Neeson , Katie Cassidy , Famke Janssen , Leland Orser , Maggie Grace    Runtime   90 minutes    




There is something so thrilling about the idea of a bunch of bad guys simply picking the wrong good guy to mess with. In White House Down, the villains could likely have gotten away with their plan were it not for John Cale. In Taken, the villains make the deadly mistake of kidnapping the daughter of Bryan Mills (Neeson). It is extremely satisfying seeing Mills and his particular set of skills cut through the bad guys in his quest to save his daughter. While Cale also has his young daughter in danger, there is likely no father more protective in movie history than Bryan Mills.

 9  Die Hard (1988) 
The Action Classic That Inspired Countless Copycats


Close







 Die Hard 
 Release Date   July 15, 1988    Director   John McTiernan    Cast   Bruce Willis , Bonnie Bedelia , Reginald VelJohnson , Paul Gleason , William Atherton , Hart Bochner    Runtime   132 minutes    




A classic that redefined how audiences view action movies, creating a Star Wars-like wake of copycats that turned into something like a genre unto itself, Die Hard remains a top-tier action thriller. Several elements in White House Down are direct references to the original Die Hard, not least of which is Tatum&#39;s white tank top, a look made famous by Bruce Willis&#39; lone cop John McClane battling well-armed thieves in a skyscraper.
While Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down may share a number of plot points, Die Hard is the true creative source of both of their characters and stories. Along with being considered one of the greatest action movies of all time, the Die Hard Christmas movie debate continues to make it a holiday favorite.

 8  Under Siege (1992) 
Steven Segal Takes On Tommy Lee Jones And Gary Busey In A Stolen Battleship
        

After the success of Die Hard, the concept of a single man overpowering a much larger force in a contained siege situation became a new Hollywood obsession. Willis&#39; performance as John McClane catapulted him to a level of action movie stardom associated with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone. Steven Seagal was always known as an action star, but his Die Hard clone was by far his most successful mainstream movie. As Casey Ryback, a Navy SEAL turned ship&#39;s cook, Seagal faces Tommy Lee Jones&#39; colorful villain William Strannix who takes control of a warship, with wild supporting antics from Gary Busey as Strannix&#39;s second-in-command, Peter Krill. Under Siege is essential viewing for a White House Down fan looking for the best siege movies.

 7  Vantage Point (2008) 
An Assassination Attempt Is Viewed From Multiple Perspectives
        

An assassination attempt made against the President of the United States is seen from multiple viewpoints before, during, and after the attack, and is replayed and seen from the perspectives of different characters. The main draw for White House Down fans here is Dennis Quaid as dedicated Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes, who will stop at nothing to save the President. Beyond that though, Vantage Point is a well-cast thriller that&#39;s built all around its many twists. With each new perspective explored, the movie reveals a little more about what is at the truth of this conspiracy.

 6  Executive Decision (1996) 
Kurt Russell Leads A Team Aboard A Hijacked Plane
        

One of the most popular spin-offs of the Die Hard formula is the self-explanatory &#39;Die Hard on a plane&#39; scenario and one of the best in that arena has to be Executive Decision. Kurt Russell plays David Grant, a fish-out-water CIA consultant who has to lead an elite team to infiltrate and take back a hijacked passenger plane without it landing. The movie finds plenty of ways to keep its claustrophobic environment exciting, and fans of White House Down will appreciate its similarly robust cast of supporting players which includes Oliver Platt, Halle Berry, and John Leguizamo. There is also a fun supporting role from Steven Seagal that makes for a great first-act surprise.

 5  Con Air (1997) 
Nicolas Cage Saves The Day Aboard A Hijacked Convict Plane


Close







 Con Air 
Con-Air is a 1990s action crime-thriller starring Nicholas Cage as former U.S. Ranger turned to convict Cameron Poe. Poe, in an act of self-defense and passion, is court-martialed for accidentally killing the man he protected his wife from. Having served his time and achieving Parole, Poe is on his way home with one problem - the transport plane he&#39;s on has been hijacked by several dangerous convicts, led by one of the worst in the United States. 
 Release Date   June 5, 1997    Director   Simon West    Cast   John Cusack , Dave Chappelle , Ving Rhames , John Malkovich , Steve Buscemi , Nicolas Cage    Runtime   115 minutes    




Nicolas Cage got his own white tank top hero character in this beloved &#39;Die Hard on a plane&#39; movie that&#39;s packed with dazzling supporting players like Malkovich, John Cusack, and Steve Buscemi as Con Air&#39;s scene-stealing Garland Greene. The story sees Cage&#39;s former Army Ranger Cameron Poe fight to take back a prisoner plane that&#39;s been hijacked by Malkovich&#39;s nefarious criminal mastermind Cyrus Grissom. White House Down fans will appreciate the movie&#39;s similarly tongue-in-cheek tone that allows the action sequences to become entertainingly ridiculous. It features the kind of bombastic action expected from the 90s Jerry Bruckheimer movies while Cage makes for a great underdog action hero.

 4  The Rock (1996) 
Sean Connery And Nicolas Cage Take On A Hostage Situation At Alcatraz
        

 The Rock 
The Rock is a 1996 action film from director Michael Bay. The story revolves around a chemist named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and John Mason (Sean Connery), an ex-con who escaped from Alcatraz, who are tasked to lead a counterstrike to protect San Francisco from a lethal nerve gas attack.
 Release Date   June 7, 1996    Director   Michael Bay    Cast   John C. McGinley , Sean Connery , David Morse , Nicolas Cage , Michael Biehn , William Forsythe , Vanessa Marcil , Ed Harris , Tony Todd , John Spencer    Runtime   136 minutes    




Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery lead this characteristically excessive action extravaganza from renowned action movie director Michael Bay. When Ed Harris&#39; rogue military leader takes over Alcatraz Island and uses it as a base to threaten San Francisco with stolen chemical weapons, it&#39;s up to the unlikely pair to break into the famous prison and save the day. White House Down fans are sure to have a blast with Bay&#39;s trademark fireball explosions and penchant for overdramatics. It is a lot of fun seeing the aged Connery and the eccentric Cage take on the vicious mercenaries while sharing a fun dynamic.

Ryan is paired up with CIA director William Cabot, played by Morgan Freeman, and together, they spruce up every big moment with intensity. This is an action-packed thriller that handsomely adapts one of Tom Clancy&#39;s most famous novels, and fans of White House Down will like the high stakes as much as the big stars.

Harrison Ford Is The President On Board His Hijacked Plane

When Russian radicals hijack Air Force One, led by Gary Oldman&#39;s loyally Soviet version of Hans Gruber, Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) negotiates with them while Ford&#39;s roguish President James Marshall retaliates against the terrorists on board in true action movie fashion. Among the Die Hard rip-offs, Air Force One is one of the best because of Ford’s iconically quotable performance, and White House Down fans will love the movie&#39;s unabashed exuberance.
