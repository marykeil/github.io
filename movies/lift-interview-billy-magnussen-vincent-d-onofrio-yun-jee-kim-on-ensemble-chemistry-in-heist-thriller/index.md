 Billy Magnussen, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio &amp; Yun Jee Kim Talk Lift 
          




Screen Rant: I&#39;m very excited to chat with the three of you for Lift. Billy, I&#39;ve been a big fan of your work since Game Night. I&#39;ve loved seeing you expand with everything from Aladdin to No Time to Die, and this feels like a great middle ground where you still get to be goofy, but also sort of competent in your work. What is it like for you to walk that fine line with this role?


Billy Magnussen: You know, that&#39;s the fun part. When F asked me to be on this project, there wasn&#39;t anything really on the page. Working with actors like this, I got a lot of runway to explore and build the character on set. So, like, I can only say thank you to the filmmaker and my fellow actors to create Magnus through this story, and stuff like that. So I give all the credit to my coworkers, actually.


Vincent, as the master of disguise in this movie, you play a lot of really fun characters throughout the different jobs. Which would you say you had the most fun getting to help put together for this?





Vincent D&#39;Onofrio: Actually, the one that&#39;s on screen the least amount, Oliver. He&#39;s kind of a redhead, his whole body is red. Or orange, I think. [Laughs] But yeah, he was the most fun.
Yun Jee Kim: Aww, Oliver.
Vincent D&#39;Onofrio: Yeah, they still have a place in their heart for Oliver.
Yun Jee Kim: [Quoting Lift] &#34;Oliver!&#34;


          

Yun Jee, congratulations on your American film debut. You bring so much charisma and heart to your role. What was this experience like for you, making the leap to Western filmmaking?


Yun Jee Kim: To be honest, I was kind of anxious and nervous coming into this project, because I&#39;ve never been away from home for that long. This was my first project, and the environment is very different from back home. But I got very lucky with these gentlemen, and also Gugu, Kevin, Viveik and Úrsula. We just had such great chemistry, and the atmosphere was just so comfortable, we were just out to have fun every day. As soon as I met them, I think my nervousness just went away completely, and I was just going to work to have fun with my people.





          

There is obviously a lot of room for ad-lib in this kind of comedy. How much did you guys actually get to ad-lib with one another throughout the movie?


Yun Jee Kim &amp; Billy Magnussen: The whole movie! [Laughs]
Billy Magnussen: No. But yes, the whole movie.
Yun Jee Kim: Yeah, actually, a lot of them made it.
Vincent D&#39;Onofrio: In the process of film, rehearsals and discussions can bring ad-libs forward, and then get scripted. And then on set, there&#39;s ad-libs that are done, and either make it in the movie or not. I think in this case, there was a lot of both.
