## Literature Review

Cartoons are frequently able to successfully spawn movies that encapsulate everything that make the original animated show great in under two hours.




It&#39;s become tradition for animated series to get a dedicated movie at some point in their life, some of which being highly regarded both in and outside their respective genres. Usually at the height of their popularity, cartoons that have been able to pick up enough engagement to fund a movie will gladly do so, taking the opportunity to reach a wider movie-going audience that might not have otherwise been exposed to their series. At some point or another, most of the greatest animated shows will have dipped their toes into the world of cinema.
Though they often take place within the same continuity as their serial inspirations, many animated films springing from TV shows will typically focus on a self-contained story that even newcomers will have no trouble acclimating to without the context of seasons of the original series. This can be a tricky balancing act to accomplish, but is usually made smoother by the higher budget and production time that these kinds of films enjoy compared to an average episode of their series. More rarely, animated shows will instead treat their movies as climactic finales to long-running arcs or even the very show itself.









 








 8  The Simpsons Movie 
2007


 







The Simpsons has had a death grip on the coveted position of America&#39;s number one animated family for years now, and the well-received The Simpsons Movie further solidified this claim. Coming out after 18 seasons of The Simpsons, the film focused on topical environmental issues, calling Homer out for his hilarious, if destructive, antics by portraying his heartwarming improvement as a father and husband. The Simpsons Movie at once helped the titular characters feel like a real family again while dispensing some of the franchise&#39;s highest-caliber jokes, including the infamous Spider-Pig.





 7  Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm 
1993
        

Widely revered as many Batman fans&#39; tantamount depiction of the character, Batman: The Animated Series served as inspiration for many spin-off stories taking place within the same universe, including the film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm. The chilling mystery of the criminal-killing vigilante&#39;s identity is given an excellent payoff, with the dramatic twist that Bruce Wayne&#39;s love interest was behind the murder spree, creating some of the most palpable drama Kevin Conroy&#39;s iconic Batman has ever had to face. It&#39;s no wonder that this film ranks with the best Batman films of all time, let alone among animated features.





 6  Teen Titans: Trouble In Tokyo 
2006
        

Acting as the last true hurrah of the original Teen Titans series before the young adult animated show would be eclipsed by the silliness of its spin-off, Teen Titans Go!, Teen Titans: Trouble In Tokyo is a worthy finale to the venerated DC superhero adaptation that branded itself into the childhood of so many. Taking place after the finale of season 5, the film paid off long-teased romance between Robin and Starfire, while throwing the Titans into an unfamiliar environment featuring one of their most powerful villains yet. Teen Titans: Trouble In Tokyo was the last hurrah the series deserved, besmirched by the original team&#39;s appearance in their crossover with Teen Titans Go!.





 5  The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie 
2004
        

One of the most beloved cartoons of all time by children and adults alike, the golden age of Spongebob Squarepants culminated in The Spongebob SquarePants Movie. While SpongeBob has appeared in other films since, nothing has been able to quite recapture the magic of SpongeBob and Patrick&#39;s journey to Shell City. From the catchy songs to the infinitely-quotable jokes to a surprise guest appearance from David Hasselhoff that would go on to inform other SpongeBob movies&#39; celebrity guest appearances, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie is drowning in charm and humor.





 4  South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut 
1999
        

From its title alone, Matt Stone and Trey Parker ensured fans of South Park coming out of the 90s that the no-holds-barred humor and social commentary of their series would be untouched by Hollywood sensibilities. Featuring plot turns like Satan being in an abusive relationship with Osama Bin Laden and a looming war with Canada that only South Park could pull off, the film also managed to proved the first long-awaited look at Kenny&#39;s face and clear voice, making waves among dedicated fans. Notably, South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut won an Oscar for 1999&#39;s best original song, with &#34;Blame Canada&#34;, which Stone and Parker famously refused to perform themselves at the Academy&#39;s prestigious awards ceremony.





 3  Transformers: The Movie 
1986
        

The original generation of Transformers wasn&#39;t only a cornerstone of many a millennial&#39;s childhood, but a branching off point from which an entire franchise was spawned. If it weren&#39;t for the success of Transformers: The Movie following Generation 1&#39;s second season, it&#39;s unclear if the shape-shifting robots would&#39;ve caught on how they did. Introducing compelling elements to the lore such as Unicron and the Matrix of Leadership while breaking 80s cartoon rules with the death of Optimus Prime, the daring special continues to hold a special place in the hearts of Transformers fans.





 2  Beavis And Butt-Head Do America 
1996
        

After seven seasons of Beavis and Butt-Head, creator Mike Judge had more than proven himself to be a capable comedic director and animation genius, going low and high at the same time with humor both juvenile and thought-provoking. Featuring the voice talents of Bruce Willis alongside Judge&#39;s own ever-hilarious dual performance, the film hinges on an unbelievable misunderstanding that quickly spirals out of control. An unabashedly vile buddy-comedy that challenges the likes of Wayne&#39;s World and Bill and Ted&#39;s Excellent Adventure, Beavis and Butt-Head Do America is one cartoon movie adaptation to remember.





 1  Rugrats In Paris: The Movie 
2000
        

While the saliva-ridden teethings of the infant-centered show Rugrats are hardly the grounds for cinematic greatness, the series&#39; second movie following the fifth season managed to tug on heartstrings and entertain children at the same time. Featuring a tearful look at Chuckie&#39;s memories of his late mother, the movie explores themes of finding love after the death of a spouse. Along with a few choice references to films like The Godfather and A Few Good Men, to keep things palatable for adults, the Rugrats&#39; animated antics prove to be as entertaining as ever for younger viewers.
