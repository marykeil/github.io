 6  Upcoming Star Wars TV Shows Expected To Drop In 2024 
        

Despite new Star Wars movies being announced in 2023, there is no denying that the franchise&#39;s most immediate future successes will remain connected to the medium of TV. When ranking Star Wars TV shows, most agree that the franchise has had few misses regarding longer-form projects. Most Star Wars TV properties have been well-received, as emblemized by the continued productions and announcements from Lucasfilm regarding further stories being told on the small screen. Be it the expansion of the New Republic era that houses stories like The Mandalorian and Ahsoka or the exploration of other areas of the timeline, Star Wars&#39; 2024 TV releases will continue the franchise&#39;s Disney&#43; ventures.
Star Wars: Skeleton Crew
        

The first expected release of Star Wars&#39; 2024 TV shows is Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. Commonly known only as Skeleton Crew, the show is another installment in the New Republica era of the Star Wars timeline. Set in the same time frame as The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett, Skeleton Crew will be an Amblin-style story of four children who become stranded in space and team up with a Jedi, played by Jude Law, to make their way home. The series was written and created by Christopher Ford and Jon Watts, with returning New Republic-era directors including Bryce Dallas Howard and Lee Isaac Chung.
New directors to the Star Wars galaxy include the Daniels of Everything Everywhere All At Once fame, Jake Schreier who is also tapped to direct Marvel Studios&#39; Thunderbolts, and acclaimed A24 filmmaker David Lowery. A release date has not yet been set for Skeleton Crew, though it is expected to be released in the first quarter of 2024. Given its placement on the Star Wars timeline, the series is also expected to tie heavily into the events of The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming Star Wars movie.
Skeleton Crew was originally expected to release in the winter of 2023 though was pushed back, leading many to speculate that the early months of 2024 will serve as the show&#39;s release date.

The first, and only, animated Star Wars TV release confirmed for 2024 is Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3. The Bad Batch is a spin-off of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, centering on the titular Clone Force 99 as they make their way through a changing galaxy in light of the Empire&#39;s early dominance. The first two seasons of The Bad Batch were incredibly well-received, leading to the announcement that a third and final season of the show would be released in 2024. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, a teaser was shown for those in attendance that hinted at the end of the Bad Batch&#39;s story.

The Acolyte
        

Another of Star Wars&#39; live-action TV shows to be released in 2024 is Star Wars: The Acolyte. Created by Leslye Headland, The Acolyte will be the first live-action project to take place in the High Republic era, around 100 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The series is set to center on a former Jedi Padawan who reunites with her Master to investigate a series of crimes, uncovering a much more sinister plot in the process. The Acolyte&#39;s place on the timeline brings an entirely new cast to Star Wars, including Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Carrie-Anne Moss, Dafne Keen, and returning Star Wars actor Joonas Suotamo.

Tales Of The Jedi Season 2
        

At Star Wars Celebration 2023, it was announced that a second season of Tales of the Jedi would be released in 2024. Tales of the Jedi was a collection of six animated shorts in the style of Star Wars: The Clone Wars, with three centering on Ahsoka Tano and three on Count Dooku&#39;s fall to the dark side. The collection of shorts was incredibly well-received, prompting Lucasfilm to place a second batch into production. While an exact release date is unclear, as are the subjects of Tales of the Jedi season 2&#39;s episodes, a projected release of 2024 was confirmed.





 5  Star Wars Movies Are Expected To Go Into Production 


Close







While Star Wars TV shows will largely dominate the live-action releases in 2024, updates surrounding the upcoming feature films in development are to be expected. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, three Star Wars movies were announced. One of these will culminate the New Republic era and be directed by Dave Filoni while another will be set 15 years after the events of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and center on Rey Skywalker&#39;s attempts to rebuild the Jedi Order. The third will be directed by James Mangold and focus on the dawn of the Jedi Order set 25000 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.
Since the early 2020s, shortly after the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, three dates have been bookmarked for Lucasfilm&#39;s Star Wars releases. While it was unclear what stories would fit these dates, May 22, 2026, December 18, 2026, and December 17, 2027, were nevertheless reserved for the studio. Upon the announcement of the three upcoming Star Wars films at SWCE 2023, it was expected that the three dates would hold Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie, Dave Filoni&#39;s New Republic story, and James Mangold&#39;s Dawn of the Jedi project respectively.
Given the lengthy production process of Star Wars movies, it is expected that at least one of these projects - most likely Rey&#39;s Jedi Order movie - will begin production in 2024. As the year progresses, it is increasingly likely that production dates for Star Wars&#39; upcoming films will be announced. While no theatrical releases will come in 2024, updates on the planned projects for future years will at least be provided.





 4  D23 2024 Will Provide Updates On Star Wars&#39; Various Other Projects 
        

One of the biggest confirmed events of 2024 is D23. D23 events happen every few years, bringing with them plenty of announcements from the worlds of Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and Disney&#39;s many other subsidiaries. The most recent D23 event took place in 2022, with another confirmed for August 2024. This event will see major updates provided on all things Disney, including the expected Star Wars projects of the next few years that are yet to receive official confirmation or release dates.
One of these projects is The Mandalorian season 4. The continuation of The Mandalorian&#39;s story is confirmed, yet it is unclear when the project will be released. Showrunner Jon Favreau confirmed at Star Wars Celebration 2023 that the scripts for season 4 were completed, though the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023 put a halt to production beginning for the show. That said, the end of the strikes means production is expected to start in the early months of 2024. While a release date of 2024 is highly unlikely, D23 provides the perfect opportunity for Lucasfilm to divulge updates on the highly-anticipated next entry to The Mandalorian saga.
Another unconfirmed story that is expected to be featured at D23 2024 is Ahsoka season 2. Ahsoka was the final Disney&#43; Star Wars show of 2023 and proved to be vital to the overarching story of the New Republic era. In an interview with Vanity Fair in November 2023, Ahsoka star Rosario Dawson revealed that Dave Filoni is working on the outline for a second season. As such, confirmation and more updates are expected in 2024, most likely at D23, alongside a slew of other unconfirmed Star Wars announcements.





 3  Star Wars: The High Republic Phase III Will Continue 
        

One of Star Wars&#39; biggest printed successes of the last few years has been The High Republic series. The first phases of The High Republic began in 2021, while the second took up most of 2022 and 2023. Phase 3 of The High Republic will officially begin in November 2023, though most of the releases pertaining to this section of Lucasfilm&#39;s multimedia story will begin in 2024. The core book Temptation of the Force is expected in the summer of 2024, as are other tie-in novels like Defy the Storm (March 5, 2024) and Tears of the Nameless in the fall of 2024.





 2  Star Wars&#39; Other Canon Novels Will Continue In 2024 
        

Despite The High Republic dominating much of Star Wars&#39; print-based stories in recent years, other canon novels will continue to be released. One of these will come in April 2024 entitled Star Wars: The Living Force. The book is written by John Jackson Miller and takes place a year before The Phantom Menace. The story of The Living Force centers on the Jedi Council reckoning with a changing galaxy, leading to the 12 members of the organization traveling to a distant planet to oversee the decommissioning of a Jedi Outpost from The High Republic, only to realize the civilians of the galaxy are threatened more than they first thought.





 1  Star Wars&#39; Video Game Repertoire Will Grow In 2024 
        

Finally, the last batch of updates expected in the Star Wars galaxy from 2024 concerns the expansion of the franchise&#39;s video game stories. The only officially confirmed video game release for 2024 is Star Wars: Outlaws, expected in winter. The game is set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi and features the original character of Kay Vess, an outlaw set on conducting a major heist in the Star Wars galaxy.
Furthermore, the third entry of the Star Wars Jedi video game series could also receive an official announcement in 2024. The second entry, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, left the story off with room to continue. As reported by VGC, actor Cameron Monaghan who plays lead character Cal Kestis confirmed that a third game was in development at Ocala Comic-Con. As such, an official announcement can be expected in 2024 along with a prospective release date. If so, Star Warsâ€™ exciting future will only continue to grow across all forms of media when combined with 2024â€™s other tantalizing announcements from a galaxy far, far away.
