Saltburn&#39;s incredibly memorable final moments are broken down and unpacked by director Emerald Fennell. The 2023 black comedy-thriller, which was also written and produced by Fennell, saw Barry Keoghan star alongside Jacob Elordi, Alison Oliver, Archie Madekwe, Rosamund Pike, and Richard E. Grant. Saltburn follows Oxford student Oliver (Keoghan) as he befriends his wealthy classmate, Felix (Elordi), and spends a summer at the latter&#39;s family home that spirals into a tale of obsession and betrayal.

Fennell opened up to The Wrap about the deeper meaning of the moment in the Saltburn ending, when Oliver dances through the titular estate while naked, having rid the place of Felix&#39;s entire family. Stating that the moment was designed to affirm Oliver as the movie&#39;s protagonist, Fennell described the dance as an act of marking the estate as his and wanted to leave audiences certain that they had sided with the right character. Check out Fennell&#39;s complete explanation below:





Restraint is an interesting idea because at the end [spoilers ahead], Oliver has none. In a single take, the camera follows him as he dances naked through the halls of Saltburn, alone. How did you land on that image? The film, it’s a fairy tale. I never really make things that aren’t. And the way it’s filmed gives us a sense of that. For those people who were still doubting whether they should be on Oliver’s side or whether he was our hero, the ending needed to have so much triumph, so much evil glee. It needed to be an act of territory-taking and desecration and joy, but then it ends, of course, with solitude. My preoccupation is making an audience complicit, making them laugh when they shouldn’t maybe be laughing, making them squirm or feel complicated feelings. So the end needed to have that thing where you could not help but to be on Oliver’s side.
It’s a credit to Barry’s beautiful work — and everyone’s beautiful work — in that scene because there are so few people who leave the movie or come up to me afterwards and say, “Oh, I wanted him to get his comeuppance!” [They’re] like, “Go get it.” And that’s what I wanted. I wanted everyone to leave [the cinema] and be like [sucks in breath], “Ah. Oooh.”






 How Saltburn&#39;s Final Song Encapsulates Oliver&#39;s Schemes 
         

Oliver&#39;s goals throughout Saltburn are perfectly encapsulated in its final moments, not just through its choice of visuals but through its soundtrack too. Oliver&#39;s victory song, Sophie Ellis-Bextor&#39;s &#34;Murder on the Dance Floor,&#34; could be read as a summary of his goals, as the song&#39;s lyrics tell the story of an individual setting her sights on a romantic partner who she sees as a likely &#34;player&#34; during a wild party. As such, the lyrics can easily be applied to Oliver&#39;s feelings towards Felix.

                  What Was Saltburn Really About?   Saltburn is one of the most baffling movies of the year, with mixed messaging about its themes of the class divide. So, what is it all about?   






The song summarizes the lengths Oliver has gone to in order to claim the home and fortune.




However, much like how Saltburn&#39;s later events reveal there were ulterior motives and bigger plans behind Oliver&#39;s actions, the lyrics of &#34;Murder on the Dance Floor&#34; further emphasize the extent of his schemes. Between lines about not letting the target &#34;get away&#34; and &#34;burn this g*dd*mn house right down,&#34; the song summarizes the lengths Oliver has gone to in order to claim the home and fortune. As such, not only does Oliver&#39;s final dance show him firmly claiming the home as his, but it also subtly pays homage to his entire scheme.

Between the lively pop song, impressive single-take shot, and Keoghan&#39;s overall look, Saltburn&#39;s ending made an impact. While Oliver&#39;s schemes and underhanded plot may be morally wrong, Fennell wished to leave viewers on the side of Keoghan&#39;s character regardless, and she did so by ending on a note of triumph. Since this scene has created plenty of discussion, it seems Fennell achieved exactly what she wanted, and that her movie and its complicated protagonist remain in viewers&#39; minds long after the credits have rolled.






Saltburn is available to stream on Prime Video.
