# 1 Hunger Games Line Connects To A Dark Book Storyline The Movies Left Out


## SUMMARY 



  The Hunger Games movies left out important details, such as the storyline of the Avoxes, who had their tongues cut out and became servants of the Capitol.   The connection between Katniss and the Avoxes is that they both rebel against the system, but their storyline is not included in the movies.   The Avox storyline was cut from the movies due to time constraints, but director Gary Ross expressed regret over not being able to include it. Author Suzanne Collins also agreed with the decision.

## Literature Review

There is one line at the beginning of The Hunger Games that hints at a dark storyline from the books that was not explored in the movies.




For the most part, The Hunger Games movies did a good job adapting Suzanne Collins&#39;s beloved book series, but they also left out some details, including one dark book storyline at least hinted at in the first film with one line. When it comes to adaptations to the big screen, several details can only be briefly explained or are left out altogether. For example, the 2012 movie of The Hunger Games only slightly referenced a minority in the Capitol with one line said during one of Katniss&#39;s conversations with Gale.




The Hunger Games franchise transformed Collins&#39;s initial three-book series into four movies in order to make sure all the details are well represented. Even so, there were many details from the complex dystopian world that The Hunger Games movies left out or didn&#39;t fully expand. In order to stay focused on the story, not all characters or side characters got the development or screen time they deserved, and one of the lines in the first movie proves that.

                  All 5 Hunger Games Movies, Ranked Worst To Best   Which is the best Hunger Games movie? From the grime of the first Katniss installment to Snow&#39;s prequel, we rank all five entries in the franchise.   


 Katniss&#39; Cut Tongues Line In The Hunger Games References An Avox 
          



In the film, there is a reference to Avoxes, the Capitol&#39;s servants who are rendered mute due to the removal of their tongues. This punishment is meted out to those labeled as rebels, traitors, or deserters.







In the first Hunger Games movie, before the reaping, Katniss and Gale have a private conversation where he jokes that they should run away, but she replies that the Capitol would cut out their tongues or worse. This line in the movie actually references Avoxes, who are servants of the Capitol, and who&#39;ve had their tongues removed, leaving them mute. That happened when a person was considered to be a rebel, traitor, or deserter. Because of that, besides having their tongues cut, they also became the lowest class in the Capitol, where they served as slaves with their identities completely wiped out.


 

The connection between the Avoxes and Katniss&#39;s line is that, like her and Gale, Avoxes have also tried to rebel and fight against the system. Even before participating in the reaping and taking her sister&#39;s place in the Hunger Games, Katniss lived her life in defiance of the Capitol, and becoming an Avox could&#39;ve been her fate. In the Hunger Games book, she even recognizes one of her servers in the Capitol to be a girl from District 12 who tried to escape with her brother, and they got caught. This scene didn&#39;t make it in the movie.






 Why The Hunger Games Cut The Avox Storyline From The Movie 
          

In the first Hunger Games book, Suzanne Collins made clear how important the Avox were, as they represented the community who had already tried to rebel against the government that controlled them. However, The Hunger Games movies cut the Avox storyline altogether, and that had to do with timing. Director Gary Ross told SlashFilm, &#34;I was a little sorry that we couldn&#39;t get the Avox subplot in from the books. I mean you can see them in the background, but we didn&#39;t really have time to engage that subplot. I was actually sorry about that, but Suzanne agreed. I mean there was no way.&#34;

There are several Avox characters in the movies, but they&#39;re pretty much ignored or cut out of the first film. The last two films have Pollux, an Avox who now fights with District 13, but there is little background on him and the rest of the Avox community. In the books, the Avox gave Katniss a deeper understanding of how cruel the Capitol was, and it motivated her, but The Hunger Games movies offered her enough fire as is.
