## Literature Review
Harry Potter franchise star Gary Oldman pinpoints the hardest scene he had to film as Harry&#39;s godfather Sirius Black, and it comes as a surprise.




Sirius Black actor Gary Oldman reveals his hardest Harry Potter scene to film. Oldman played Harry Potter&#39;s godfather in the franchise, first appearing in the 2004 film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, directed by Alfonso CuarÃ³n. The actor went on to appear in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which ended with his character tragically dying during a battle at the Ministry of Magic. While Oldman filmed several challenging scenes during his tenure as Sirius, his most difficult took place in his first Harry Potter movie.




Oldman recently appeared on the Happy Sad Confused podcast hosted by Josh Horowitz, during which he revealed that his toughest scene to film as Sirius Black occurred in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, when his character lay prone beside a frozen lake as Dementors sucked out his soul.


 

The actor stated that the main reason the scene was so challenging had to do with the physical discomfort of lying motionless in the cold for an extended period of time, as the scene took a week to film. See what Oldman had to say about the experience below:


&#34;In one of the Harry Potters, there was like a frozen lake. And I&#39;m sort of dead, and my soul is leaving my body, and I had to just lie there for a week, day in, day out, doing nothing. Doing nothing, but then you&#39;d have to get, you know, &#39;Can someone - I&#39;m getting a, I think my kidneys are really getting a bit cold.&#39; And then they&#39;d put the little hot water bottle under you, and you&#39;d lie there like that. And then day three, you go, &#39;My neck is killing me,&#39; and they&#39;d put a little pillow underneath you. Yeah, the hardest thing I had to do was lie next to a frozen lake.&#34;






 Why It&#39;s Surprising That This Was Oldman&#39;s Toughest Harry Potter Scene 
          

As the third film in the franchise and Oldman&#39;s first appearance, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban contains several intense moments as it grapples with darker themes than the first two Harry Potter movies. Oldman took on many challenging scenes in his first movie, including his blowout confrontation in the Shrieking Shack with Remus Lupin (David Thewlis), Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), and Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall). Over the course of the movie, he also shared a tender moment with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) as he offered to take his godson in, and a heart-pounding moment with Remus as he tried to keep the werewolf from transforming.



Harry&#39;s parents, James and Lily, made Sirius his godfather when he was born, but he was unable to take the boy in after their early deaths due to serving twelve years in Azkaban for a crime he did not commit.







In his subsequent Harry Potter movies, Oldman continued an impressive run as Sirius over many challenging scenes, particularly in the fifth movie in the franchise, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. In that movie, Sirius struggled with not being able to help the Order as a fugitive, and his frustrations echoed Harry&#39;s in being sidelined due to his connections with Voldemort. Tragically, Sirius died by his cousin&#39;s hand during a battle at the end of the movie while Harry watched, so it is somewhat surprising that Oldman found lying motionless more difficult than any other scene.

While Oldman recently stated that he is critical of his appearances as Sirius Black, he portrayed the character perfectly as a loving godfather, escaped convict, and tragic figure all rolled into one. Thankfully, the actor got through his most grueling scene and didn&#39;t let the physical discomfort of that moment put him off of appearing in future installments, giving Sirius an impressive run and a devastating send-off. While it has been well over a decade since Oldman appeared in a Harry Potter movie, he remains a memorable part of the franchise.






The Harry Potter film series is streaming on Max.
