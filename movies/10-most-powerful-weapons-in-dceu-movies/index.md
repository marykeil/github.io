## Literature Review

The heroes and villains of the DC Universe are incredibly powerful, and they&#39;re often accompanied by equally impressive weapons of immense strength




There are countless powerful weapons wielded by heroes and villains alike in the DCEU. Zack Snyder&#39;s 2013 movie Man of Steel establishes the DCEU as a world of powerful metahumans wielding the strength of demi-gods, as well as human warriors with skills and brains to either challenge them or fight alongside them. In the case of both, different forms of weaponry often come into play in the DCEU.
In addition to Batman&#39;s well-known collection of gadgets and weapons, the powerful heroes of the Justice League and many other DCEU heroes and heroines carry weapons that enable them to hold their own against cosmically powerful villains. On the flip side, the villains of the DCEU bring their own assortment of weapons to the table, as well, with some even being potentially world-ending threats. Here are the 10 most powerful weapons in the DCEU.

 10  Batman&#39;s Sonic Wave Trap - Batman v Superman 
It Stops Superman Dead In His Tracks
        

  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  


  Release Date    March 24, 2016     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot    


When the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel come to blows in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman brings numerous weapons to the fight, including a sonic wave emitter that Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman steps into. Admittedly, Batman&#39;s sonic wave machine is more a tool for weakening and disorienting Superman than defeating him in the fight, but it&#39;s still powerful enough to stop Superman dead in his tracks. Any weapon that can stop a Kryptonian in the middle of a fight, even temporarily, is surely a very powerful one.





 9  The Kryptonite Spear - Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice 
Superman Uses It To Defeat Doomsday
        

In Batman v Superman, the Kryptonite spear becomes one of the most poetic weapons in the DCEU given where it begins and ends in the film. Initially, Batman fashions the spear out of a Kryptonite rock in his mission to destroy Superman before the two finally become allies against Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) and his monstrous creation, Doomsday. In the end, Superman himself wields the Kryptonite spear to defeat Doomsday, sacrificing his life to save the world in the process (before his subsequent resurrection in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League.)
Batman v Superman primarily bases its story upon The Dark Knight Returns and The Death of Superman. 






 8  The Black Trident - Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom 
Black Manta Is Controlled By A Dead Underwater King
        

  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom  


  Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    James Wan     Cast    Jason Momoa , Amber Heard , Patrick Wilson , Dolph Lundgren , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Temuera Morrison    


When Black Manta (Yahya Abdul Mateen II) seeks revenge on Jason Momoa&#39;s Arthur Curry in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, he wields the Black Trident of the kingdom of Necrus, which brings with it some unexpected powers. In addition to increasing Black Manta&#39;s strength and durability to be the level of Aquaman himself, Black Manta himself also falls under its power, with the deceased King Kordax (Pilou Asbæk) controlling Black Manta in order to thaw his frozen army and unleash them upon the world. With the Black Trident being a danger even to those wielding it, its power among DCEU weapons is beyond question.





 7  The Crown Of Sabbac - Black Adam 
The Crown Unleashes The Demonic Warrior On Kahndaq


 







  Black Adam  


  Release Date    October 21, 2022     Director    Jaume Collet-Serra     Cast    Noah Centineo , Pierce Brosnan , Mo Amer , Marwan Kenzari , Aldis Hodge , Bodhi Sabongui , Uli Latukefu , James Cusati-Moyer , Dwayne Johnson , Sarah Shahi , Quintessa Swindell    


Dwayne Johnson&#39;s Black Adam may be Kahndaq&#39;s champion in Black Adam, but he and the Justice Society of America face a hugely powerful enemy in the demonic Sabbac, who is brought into the world when archeologist Ishmael Gregor (Marwan Kenzari) gets his hands on the fabled Crown of Sabbac. Once imbued with the power of his eponymous crown, Sabbac can easily hold his own against even the most powerful of metahumans, including Black Adam himself. In all, the Crown of Sabbac is the only DCEU weapon to truly unleash the literal power of hell upon Earth.

 6  The Trident Of Atlan - Aquaman 
Arthur Curry Leads An Oceanic Army To Victory With His Trident
        

  Aquaman  


  Release Date    July 6, 2018     Director    James Wan     Cast    Willem Dafoe , Patrick Wilson , Randall Park , Ludi Lin , Dolph Lundgren , Michael Beach , Amber Heard , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Jason Momoa , Temuera Morrison    


Arthur Curry is called upon to claim the throne of Atlantis and prevent a war with the surface world in Aquaman, and doing so leads him to find and carry the fabled Trident of Atlan. Once carried by the original king of Atlantis, the Trident of Atlan is both an indestructible melee weapon and gives Arthur the power to command an entire undersea army to stop the Atlantean invasion led by his half-brother King Orm (Patrick Wilson). By the end of Aquaman, Arthur reigns over the seven seas thanks to the might and reverence the Trident of Atlan accords him.
With its $1.1 billion worldwide box office haul, Aquaman is the highest-grossing DC Comics movie of all time. 






 5  The Lasso Of Hestia - Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman, Wonder Woman 1984, Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, &amp; The Flash 
Wonder Woman Ensnares Her Enemies, &amp; Makes Them Tell The Truth


 







Throughout her role as a hero in the DCEU, Gal Gadot&#39;s Wonder Woman battles her enemies with the mighty Lasso of Hestia, which brings many powerful properties and abilities with it. The lasso itself is durable and flexible enough to take down even the most powerful of metahuman opponents, with Diana even using it to trap Doomsday in the final battle of Batman v Superman. Additionally, the Lasso of Hestia forces anyone making contact with it to tell the truth. Moreover, the Lasso of Hestia also has more compassionate powers, with Diana revealing that it can enable anyone grasping it to &#34;see&#34; the truth as well in Wonder Woman 1984.





 4  The Kryptonian World Engine - Man of Steel 
General Zod Wrecks Havoc On Earth To Build A New Krypton
        

  Man of Steel  


  Release Date    June 14, 2013     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe    


Villains in the DCEU carry weapons just as powerful as the heroes, as the Kryptonian World Engine in Man of Steel emphatically shows. Built by Kryptonians to terraform planets, General Zod (Michael Shannon) and his Kryptonian militia bring a World Engine to Earth in order to reshape the planet into a new Krypton. Though Superman stop Zod, the World Engine still destroys a sizable portion of Metropolis with many civilian casualties, making its might as a DCEU weapon crystal clear.
The Kryptonian World Engine is later seen in The Flash, both in flashbacks to Man of Steel and in the alternate reality the movie takes place in, with General Zod also returning in the latter. 






 3  The Mother Boxes - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League 
The Mother Boxes Terraform Worlds When Combined Into The Unity
        

  Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League  


  Release Date    March 18, 2021     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Gal Gadot , Ray Fisher , Jason Momoa , Ezra Miller , Jesse Eisenberg , Jeremy Irons , J.K. Simmons , Willem Dafoe    


In his conquest of the multiverse, Darkseid (Ray Porter) carries the wildly powerful weapons known as the Mother Boxes. Described by Cyborg as &#34;change machines,&#34; the Mother Boxes individually can remake and revamp organic matter in numerous ways, including bestowing Victor Stone&#39;s cybernetic body upon him and resurrecting the deceased Superman. When brought together in the Unity, the Mother Boxes are a devastating tool capable of terraforming an entire planet into a copy of Darkseid&#39;s home world Apokolips, an outcome The Flash (Ezra Miller) narrowly averts in the finale of Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League.

 2  Cyborg&#39;s Entire Body - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League 
He&#39;s The Most Powerful Technological Being In The Universe


 







Ray Fisher&#39;s Victor Stone loses much of his body in a car accident in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, only to have it restored cybernetically when his father Silas (Joe Morton) awakens a Mother Box, and as Cyborg, Victor&#39;s technological abilities are vast. Cyborg can interface with any form of technology, including Mother Boxes, and can bypass any security software to the point that he can launch every nuclear weapon on Earth at once. With his added powers of flight, energy blasts, and superhuman strength, Cyborg himself is one of the most powerful weapons in the DCEU.

 1  The Anti-Life Equation - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League 
It Can Strip The Entire Multiverse Of Free Will
        

The most powerful and feared weapon ever seen in the DCEU is the formula of mind control known as the Anti-Life Equation. Sought after for eons by Darkseid, the Anti-Life Equation is carved into the surface of the Earth and is, as Steppenwolf states, &#34;the key to controlling all life and all will throughout the multiverse.&#34; The planned story for Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League sequels shows just what kind of destruction can be wrought by the Anti-Life Equation.
In Snyder&#39;s plans for the Knightmare timeline in Justice League 2 and Justice League 3, Darkseid kills Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and uses the Anti-Life Equation to bring Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman under his control, turning the Man of Steel into his most powerful soldier to conquer Earth. Though Batman ultimately sends The Flash back in time to undo the Knightmare future, the glimpses of it and the controlled Superman seen in Batman v Superman and Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League show just how terrifying a weapon the Anti-Life Equation really is. With such apocalyptic potential, the Anti-Life Equation is the most powerful weapon seen in the DCEU.
