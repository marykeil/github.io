## Literature Review

There are new Lord of the Rings and Transformers movies coming in 2024, and they both mark a franchise first for the successful live-action series.




The Lord of the Rings and Transformers are two very different franchises, but both of them are attempting the same expansion in 2024 for the first time. The Lord of the Rings movies rose to popularity during the early 2000s thanks to Peter Jackson&#39;s award-winning trilogy. The financial success of the films ensured Warner Bros. would continue to invest in the Middle-earth franchise for years to come, leading to The Hobbit&#39;s trilogy of films in the 2010s. Throughout this time, Paramount also came to find success with the Transformers live-action franchise under Michael Bay, which has gone on to include seven entries.




The overall success that The Lord of the Rings and Transformers movies experienced means both properties left a huge mark on pop culture and continue to do so. The most recent Transformers movie came out in 2023 with Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, while Lord of the Rings has been absent from the big screen for a decade, even though The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power filled the void on the small screen in 2022. Audiences are now on the precipice of getting new projects from Lord of the Rings and Transformers in 2024, and they share a surprising connection.

 The LOTR &amp; Transformers Franchises Have Their First Animated Movie Releasing In 2024 
         




2024 marks the first time that the Lord of the Rings and Transformers franchises are expanding to animated movies. This is possible thanks to the upcoming releases for The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim and Transformers One. Both movies are animated prequels exploring known events in the individual franchise&#39;s lore. The War of the Rohirrim is set hundreds of years before Peter Jackson&#39;s The Lord of the Rings trilogy and is narrated by Miranda Otto&#39;s Ã‰owyn, who appeared in the live-action movies. It explores events teased in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and is loosely connected to the live-action movies.

Before audiences experience the Lord of the Rings&#39; animated movie in December 2024, viewers will be treated to Transformers One a few months earlier. The animated movie is centered around a young Optimus Prime and Megatron and explores their fall from friends to enemies. Whereas The War of the Rohirrim is somewhat connected to the live-action franchise, Transformers One is not confirmed to have any connection to the live-action series. Still, it is still notable because its development came from Paramount&#39;s initiative to expand the franchise due to the success of the live-action movies.






Transformers: The Animated Movie from 1986 is technically the first animated Transformers movie, but it predated the live-action movie franchise and was a continuation of the animated TV show






 Other Franchises Could Follow LOTR &amp; Transformers&#39; Lead If They Are Successful 
          

The combination of Lord of the Rings and Transformers both testing the waters with animated movies in 2024 could be a huge moment for Hollywood. The Lord of the Rings and Transformers are both $5 billion franchises. If these two live-action franchises manage to find success by expanding into animation, others could follow suit. Animated movies have a long history of box office success, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie just showed how big they can be when an existing IP is involved. The Lord of the Rings and Transformers could continue that trend and usher in a wave of major animated movies based on popular live-action franchises.
