## Literature Review

Netflix releases the first images from Shirley, an upcoming Regina King biopic about the first Black woman elected to the United States Congress.




Images from Netflix’s Shirley show Regina King playing real-life congresswoman Shirley Chisholm in the upcoming biopic. Chisholm made history as the first Black woman elected to Congress in 1968. The movie is directed by John Ridley, who previously won an Oscar for writing 12 Years A Slave.




Now, new images from Netflix’s Shirley show a glimpse at King in the role.

         

The four images showcase King in four different contexts in her role. In two of the images, King looks serious as Shirley is at work. In one image, King grins as the only Black face in a group of white men. The last image takes Chisholm into what appears to be her home, as she sits at a dinner table talking with Ridley.


 What To Expect from Shirley 
          

Chisholm made history upon her election to Congress in 1968, but that was far from the only major accomplishment the former Congresswoman had in government. In 1972, Chisholm made history again when she started a presidential campaign. This made her the first Black person ever to seek a presidential candidacy from a major political party. Shirley will largely follow this journey in 1972, when Chisholm had already served in Congress and was now looking to expand her career through a presidential bid.
