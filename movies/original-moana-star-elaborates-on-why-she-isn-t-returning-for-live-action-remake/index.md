## Literature Review

Original Moana star Auli&#39;i Cravahlo explains why she feels stepping down from her role and allowing another actor is best for the remake.




Moana star Auli&#39;i Cravalho explains why she is stepping down from portraying the character in the 2016 Disney animated movie&#39;s upcoming live-action remake. Cravalho provided the voice of the ambitious wayfarer who went on an ocean odyssey to return a powerful gem to the Goddess Te Fiti to bring peace to the seas and save her home. The star was joined by Dwayne Johnson and Alan Tudyk, who provided the voices of cocky demigod Maui and the hapless chicken, Heihei.




While Cravalhalo was promoting her upcoming role as Janis &#39;Imi&#39;ike in the movie adaptation of the Mean Girls stage musical, the actor opened up about why she chose not to reprise Moana in its upcoming live-action remake to TheWrap. Much like how the original Moana gave Cravalho an opportunity to increase representation for the Pacific Islands in Hollywood, the star hopes her passing of the baton and taking up a role behind the camera can help increase representation for the Pacific Islands further. Check out Cravalho&#39;s full explanation below:


“It feels really important to me to pass the baton to the next young woman of Pacific Island descent, and I say that with my whole chest. I have been invited, and I exist in these beautiful AAPI spaces, Asian American Pacific Islander, and I am one of the few Pacific Islanders. And I’ll say it again, I am one of the few Pacific Islanders. And our stories are so important to be told.
We are used. And I want to tell our own stories. I want to be behind the camera as much as I am in front of it. When I talk about representation, I want to see the same thing happening in writers rooms. I want to see the same thing happening with directors. And Taika Waititi talks about this as well, I wanna see showrunners who are also of indigenous descent telling their own stories.
And if it has to start with me — I’m 23, but if it starts with me, so be it. I want that door to swing wide open, and I cannot wait to meet the next Moana.”






 Who Is Returning For Moana&#39;s Live-Action Adaptation? 
          

While Moana&#39;s live-action remake is currently incredibly early in development, one star has been confirmed to bring their animated characters into live-action. In the initial announcement confirming the live-action remake&#39;s development, Johnson revealed that he would reprise his role of Maui, explaining his personal connection to the character&#39;s early development. While other live-action Moana cast members are still being assembled, it can also be assumed that Tudyk and Jermaine Clement will return to provide the voices of Heihei and gigantic crab Tamatoa.

                  9 Lessons Moana&#39;s Remake Can Learn From Disney&#39;s Live-Action Movie Mistakes   Disney announced that Moana is the next title to receive a live-action remake—but it&#39;s important the studio learn from its past mistakes.    




While both Johnson and Cravalho will be stepping behind the camera, they will also be joined by talent who had a hand in the original Moana&#39;s development. Following his work on The Little Mermaid&#39;s live-action adaptation, Lin-Manuel Miranda has been confirmed to return as a songwriter following his work on the original animated feature. Jared Bush, who wrote the screenplay for the original version, has also been confirmed to return to pen the upcoming retelling.

Cravhalo&#39;s reasoning for stepping away from portraying her character in a live-action Moana retelling is an understandable and hopeful reason. While the Disney movie helped broaden the audiences&#39; knowledge of South Pacific culture and storytelling in 2016, it is still an incredibly underrepresented demographic on screen at a time when their voices should be heard. As such, while Cravhalo&#39;s casting goals for a new Moana can give a new South Pacific star the opportunities she had and increase on-screen representation, her work behind the camera can ensure Moana&#39;s live-action remake is respectful and a celebration of an underrepresented region.






Moana&#39;s original animated movie is currently available on Disney&#43;.
