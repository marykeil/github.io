## Literature Review

The planned Star Wars Lando Calrissian movie has one important story it needs to tell that was teased in the era of the sequel trilogy.




The upcoming Lando Calrissian Star Wars movie has one major sequel trilogy mystery it still needs to answer. Since December 2020, a Star Wars Lando story has been in development alongside several other projects. For a long while, it seemed as though the Lando project would become the latest in a long line of canceled Star Wars productions as its future as a Disney&#43; show looked uncertain. However, it was confirmed in 2023 that Donald Glover and his brother Stephen were the new story writers after the former portrayed Calrissian in 2018&#39;s Solo: A Star Wars Story, reigniting hope in the project&#39;s development.




It was then confirmed in September 2023 that the former Lando show would be a Star Wars movie. Rather than have the smooth-talking character be the subject of a Disney&#43; series, Lando would join the roster of upcoming Star Wars movies though likely as less of a priority than the three projects announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023. Regardless of the film&#39;s importance to Lucasfilm concerning fast-tracking production, the Lando story must pick up one of the story threads teased for the character in the sequel era.


 Star Wars Has Yet To Show The Story Of Lando&#39;s Daughter 
          

The story in question is the tragic fate of Lando&#39;s daughter. In the 2022 novel Shadow of the Sith, it was revealed that Lando had a daughter in 13ABY. The book also reveals that when Lando&#39;s daughter was only two years old she was kidnapped by unknown assailants. That said, other Star Wars projects have confirmed that the early members of the First Order kidnapped the offspring of the Rebel Alliance&#39;s major generals to both reduce their threat to the oppressive organization&#39;s rise and also undermine the Rebellion&#39;s heroes.




Star Wars Battlefront II reinforced this plot point with the game detailing the First Order&#39;s kidnapping of young children. Since it was revealed that Lando&#39;s daughter, Kadara, was taken, little else has been mentioned of the character. Lando has mentioned the ordeal in wider stories of Star Wars canon, including that he assumes his daughter is now a stormtrooper in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&#39;s novelization. However, this story could be incredibly compelling as the plot of a film and offer a fantastic arc to flesh out the character of Lando Calrissian.



 Kadara Calrissian May Make An Appearance In Lando&#39;s Movie 
          

With all of this in mind, it would be perfect for Kadara Calrissian to make an appearance in the Lando movie. In the ending of The Rise of Skywalker, the First Order was defeated meaning the indoctrination of its stormtroopers began being reversed. It could be a great story to have Lando be about his search for his daughter, decades after she went missing at the hands of the First Order.




This could tie into the theories surrounding The Rise of Skywalker that Naomi Ackie&#39;s Jannah was Lando&#39;s daughter. It certainly seems as though the film was leaning into these theories, with Jannah being a former stormtrooper turned Resistance fighter. Also, the ending of Rise of Skywalker features a scene in which Lando asks Jannah where she is from. Jannah replies that she does not know, leading Lando to say &#34;Well let&#39;s find out.&#34; These theories could all be tied together in the Lando Star Wars movie, revealing Jannah as Kadara Calrissian, exploring her kidnapping, and adding depth to one of the franchise&#39;s longest-serving characters.
