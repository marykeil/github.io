# Top Gun 3 s Perfect Story Was Teased In The 1986 Movie (&amp; Won t Undo Maverick s Ending)


## SUMMARY 



  Top Gun 3 can be a prequel focused on Maverick&#39;s father, Duke Mitchell.   The new movie should avoid undoing Maverick&#39;s perfect ending in Top Gun: Maverick.   The sequel can focus on the new generation of pilots, making Rooster and/or Hangman the main characters.

## Literature Review

If Top Gun 3 happens, it already has the perfect story, which was teased in the first movie and won&#39;t undo the ending of Top Gun: Maverick.




If Top Gun 3 happens, it already has the perfect story that won’t undo the ending of Top Gun: Maverick, and it’s a story that was teased in the first movie. In 1986, Tony Scott’s Top Gun became the highest-grossing movie of the year, despite an initially mixed reception by critics. Top Gun is regarded as one of the best movies of the 1980s, and 36 years after its release, it finally got a sequel. Top Gun: Maverick reunited viewers with Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (Tom Cruise) and Tom “Iceman” Kazansky (Val Kilmer), and introduced a new generation of highly skilled pilots.




Top Gun: Maverick saw Pete mentoring a new group of pilots as they prepared to go on a dangerous mission from which they might not come back alive. Maverick introduced Goose&#39;s son, Bradley “Rooster” Bradshaw (Miles Teller), whom Maverick felt responsible for after Goose&#39;s death and making a promise to Rooster&#39;s mother before she died. The success of Top Gun: Maverick has made way for speculation about a third movie, and its best story is one that was teased in the first movie.


 Top Gun 3 Can Be A Prequel Following Maverick’s Father 
          

Top Gun: Maverick was a commercial and critical success, so it&#39;s not surprising that talks about a potential third movie immediately began. As Top Gun: Maverick introduced a new generation of pilots, most notably Jake “Hangman” Seresin (Glen Powell), a sequel is expected to focus on some of the new pilots in addition to continuing Rooster&#39;s story, with or without Maverick. However, the best option for Top Gun 3 is to be a prequel rather than a sequel, and to be focused on Maverick&#39;s father, Duke Mitchell.




In Top Gun, Pete&#39;s late father is mentioned a couple of times, especially after Maverick arrives at the title school and meets chief instructor Commander Mike “Viper” Metcalf (Tom Skerritt). Viper mentions that he used to fly with Maverick&#39;s father, and it’s revealed that Duke and Viper flew together in the Vietnam War air battle where Duke was killed. According to Viper, Duke’s plane was shot down, but Viper witnessed Duke’s heroic actions in his final moments, but no more was revealed about him (aside from having a thing for flying dangerously, very much like Maverick does).

Top Gun 3, then, could be a prequel exploring Duke and Viper’s young years and time flying together at the war, and it could still follow the model of the other two Top Gun movies by revealing Viper felt responsible for Maverick the same way Maverick felt for Rooster.



 Top Gun 3 Shouldn&#39;t Undo Maverick’s Perfect Ending 
          




Top Gun: Maverick left the door open for more movies, but at the same time, it already gave its main character a perfect ending. Maverick was able to make peace with the past and fix his relationship with Rooster, and he continued his relationship with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly). With the introduction of Rooster, Hangman, and other pilots, Top Gun: Maverick makes it possible for a sequel to focus on this new generation of pilots, even if Maverick doesn’t come back to keep training them.

The problem with a new movie is that Top Gun 3 shouldn’t undo Maverick’s perfect ending and have him repeat the same story, so if not a prequel telling the story of Duke Mitchell, the next Top Gun movie can make Rooster and/or Hangman the main character(s) and explore other characters as well, such as Phoenix and Fanboy.
