# 10 Non-Study Group Members We Want To See In The Community Movie


## SUMMARY 


 The Community movie, tentatively titled ...And A Movie, has confirmed the return of the main study group members, Jeff, Annie, Britta, Abed, Shirley, and Troy. 
 Other non-study group members like Chang, the Spanish teacher turned actor, and Dean Pelton, the eccentric dean of Greendale, are expected to appear in the film, as confirmed by Peacock. 
 Not all recurring characters will make a return, such as Pierce, who left the show due to conflicts, but fan-favorites like Garrett, Magnitude, Starburns, Buzz Hickey, Elroy, Professor Garrity, Todd, and Professor Duncan could potentially be part of the Community movie.

## Literature Review

The Community movie needs to bring back many beloved non-study group members who make Greendale feel complete in Dan Harmon&#39;s titular comedy TV show.




Peacock&#39;s Community movie could include multiple fan-favorite non-study group members who would help the film feel complete. Dan Harmon&#39;s comedy TV show titled Community ran from 2009 to 2015, telling the story of a study-group-turned-friends who attend Greendale Community College in the fictional city of Greendale, Colorado. After six difficult seasons, a cancelation, and nine years, the comedy show Community is finally fulfilling its #SixSeasonsAndAMovie campaign. Joel McHale provided confirmation of the Community movie, tentatively titled ...And A Movie, in September 2022. Since then, the fandom has been abuzz with discussion of who might appear in the film.
Initially, the announcement confirmed the return of most of the Community study group– Jeff (Joel McHale), Annie (Allison Brie), Britta (Gillian Jacobs), and Abed (Danny Pudi). Since then, it&#39;s been confirmed that both Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) and Troy (Donald Glover) will also return for the movie. Chevy Chase&#39;s Pierce left Community before season 5 due to on-set conflicts which included him using a racial slur. As such, he almost definitely won&#39;t return for the film. With the study group set to return for ...And A Movie, the question comes up what non-study group members could return for the Community movie.
Where to watch Community









 








 10  Ben &#34;Kevin&#34; Chang 
Community&#39;s Spanish Teacher Turned Student Turned Dictator Turned Amnesiac Turned Actor
        

Chang was never an official part of the study group except for five minutes in Community season 2, episode 12, &#34;Asian Population Studies;&#34; however, he loses his spot due to him and Shirley sleeping together. Despite this, he&#39;s central to the plot in every season. Chang also has the best jokes and isn&#39;t restricted by the rules of the show – ala getting Changnesia and becoming a dictator. The Community movie wouldn&#39;t be the same without his nonsensical, unhinged hijinks. Luckily, actor Ken Jeong was one of the people promoting the movie after its announcement, and Peacock included him in their confirmation of the movie, indicating that he will return.





 9  Dean Pelton 
The Loveable And Eccentric Dean Of Greendale Community College


 







There&#39;s no character in Community who better exemplifies Greendale than Dean Pelton. He gives wacky announcements, wears theatrical costumes, and puts on a ridiculous number of school dances. He truly believes in the value of Greendale even when everyone else doubts it. The Dean refuses to box himself into labels about his sexuality or gender expression, mirroring the individualism of the school. These elements make him the heart of the TV show, alongside Troy and Abed&#39;s friendship. As such, he needs to appear in the Community movie for it to feel complete. Luckily, actor Jim Rash was listed in the Peacock film announcement, making the Dean&#39;s return almost certain.
            
 
 10 Unresolved Community Plots The Movie Needs To Address 
Now that Community may finally be getting a movie, it&#39;s worth looking into the biggest loose plot threads from the series that need to be resolved.








 8  Garrett 
The Unappreciated Recurring Character In Community
        

Between the Ass-Crack Bandit, the paintball games, and the pillow and blanket fort battle, Garrett is involved in some of the most iconic Community storylines. This would make him a perfect addition to the Community movie. Additionally, it would be interesting to get an update on his life. Despite mostly taking science classes at Greendale, the end of the series shows Garrett putting on a comedy show with Vicki and marrying his cousin. There&#39;s no clear answer to what kind of job he&#39;d have after graduating from the community college.





 7  Magnitude 
Greendale Community College&#39;s Popular Student
        

One of the goofier additions to Community is the character Magnitude who&#39;s famous for his catchphrase, &#34;Pop, pop!&#34; which he says alongside a raise-the-roof gesture. He&#39;s a one-man-party who&#39;s always there for a good time, as seen when he attends Jeff&#39;s house party. He frequently involves himself in school events like the election and school commercial. Ultimately, as the Dean says in Community season 4, &#34;...Greendale is Magnitude saying, &#39;Pop, pop!&#39;&#34; Magnitude would be a fun character to incorporate in ...And A Movie, even if it was only a short cameo.





 6  Starburns 
Greendale Community College&#39;s Resident Drug Dealer
        

Alex Osbourne, known mononymously as Starburns, is a middle-aged student at Greendale Community College who also runs a meth lab in Community. Starburns resents the study group except for Pierce, with whom he trades drugs, and Abed, whom he tasks with making a documentary about his life. This creates an interesting dynamic where he calls out the stupid things the study group does. Moreover, he makes ridiculous choices like faking his own death and trying to make a cat-powered vehicle, proving he&#39;s just as irrational as the rest of Greendale Community College. All these elements make Starburns a beloved part of Community and a great choice for the upcoming film.
            
 
 20 Best Shows Like Community 
While there is no show quite like Community, there are a few series that can help fill the void.








 5  Buzz Hickey 
Community&#39;s Criminology Professor And A Member Of The Save Greendale Committee
        

After Pierce leaves Community, the series introduces Professor Buzz Hickey to fill in the gap. Hickey is primarily cranky but has a soft side that becomes more prominent over time. Unfortunately, Jonathan Banks&#39; Buzz Hickey only stays on Community for one season due to the actor&#39;s filming schedule. By the end of his run, Hickey fit in with the rest of the ensemble. The Community film could easily bring back Buzz Hickey to work at Greendale again or have a drink with his former star pupil, Annie.





 4  Elroy Patashnik 
An Inventor Who Wants To Follow A New Path In Community Season 6
        

Community season 6 introduces Elroy Patashnik, a washed-up scientist and inventor who starts working as the head of the I.T. department at Greendale. Elroy is smart, funny, and kindhearted. Unlike most characters, he isn&#39;t immediately charmed by Jeff, warming up to other group members instead. Because Community fans love Elroy, he should appear in the upcoming film. Unfortunately, in August 2023, actor Keith David expressed doubt on his Twitter that he&#39;d be invited back to play Elroy again. Hopefully, things have changed behind the scenes in the months since, allowing Elroy to appear on the small screen again.
Keith David also appears in They Live, The Thing, and Armageddon. 






 3  Professor Sean Garrity 
Community&#39;s Hilarious Drama Teacher And Fake Conspiracy Theory Teacher


 







One of the best employees to work at Greendale in Community is Professor Sean Garrity – the drama teacher. Alongside his eccentric teaching methods, Garrity has a fun time playing different characters, like Professor Professorson. Unlike many Greendale teachers, he&#39;s effective at his job, helping students reach their emotional core in acting class. Since Abed left to work in Hollywood at the end of Community, there&#39;s an easy way to bring Professor Garrity back in the movie. The teacher could have a professional connection with Abed that&#39;s integrated into ...And A Movie.





 2  Todd 
The Pushover Student Who Snaps In Community
        

One of the most underused Community characters is Todd, an easygoing student and decorated war veteran. He has a well-developed background that&#39;s explored in Community season 3, episode 1, &#34;Biology 101.&#34; His amenable personality finally snaps after the study group continually degrades him. This is one of the few times he gets to shine in the series, though. It would be great to see Todd again in the Community movie, giving him another chance to stand up to the study group that treats him so poorly.





 1  Professor Ian Duncan 
Greendale Community College&#39;s Psychology Professor And Fill-In Anthropology Professor


 







From the very first episode of Community, Professor Ian Duncan serves as the professor of psychology at Greendale Community College. More than this, though, he&#39;s an inappropriately flirtatious and funny character who fits right in at the school. Strangely, John Oliver&#39;s Ian Duncan disappears from Community multiple times. Given the fact that Oliver&#39;s career has boomed since leaving the series, it seems unlikely he&#39;ll return for the movie. Additionally, Harmon and his co-writer Andrew Guest would have to fix the mildly problematic portrayal of Duncan&#39;s alcohol use disorder. Regardless of this, he&#39;s probably the most desired recurring character for the Community movie.
