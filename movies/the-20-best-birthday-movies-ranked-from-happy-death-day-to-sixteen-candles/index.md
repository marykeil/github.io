## Literature Review



The best birthday movies use the joy and celebration that&#39;s supposed to come with the day to make a point about expectations, regret, and the pressures of growing up; and, of course, sometimes a birthday movie is great because birthdays are just a lot of fun. There are films for Halloween, Christmas, St. Patrick&#39;s Day, Valentine&#39;s Day, and every other holiday but birthdays are more personal, as they often bring up conflicting feelings. They&#39;re celebrations of maturity but also clear reminders of time passing, so a lot of feelings surround the weeks leading up to a birthday.
A movie can use a birthday as a shortcut to conflict, giving a character a reason they need to change. New Year&#39;s Eve may be the holiday when people make promises to work out more, but it&#39;s birthdays when they decide to take stock. With so many expectations put on birthdays, they inevitably are never the day one hopes for. However, they can often lead to some breakthrough about either how a character&#39;s life needs to change or how it&#39;s fine the way it is. Less philosophically, a birthday movie also gives a convenient reason to have a bunch of characters in the same location or simply kickstart a film&#39;s story.

 19  This Is 40 (2012) 
Judd Apatow&#39;s reflection on his own middle-age
        

 This is 40 
Judd Apatow returns to the life-comedy drama style of films with This Is 40, a side-sequel to 2007’s Knocked up. The movie stars Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as a married couple whose relationships are going through the motions as they approach forty years old and find themselves struggling to find time for each other. With the spark in their relationship seemingly flickering out, the two attempt to work on themselves – and each other – while dealing with their chaotic families.
 Release Date   January 10, 2013    Cast   Paul Rudd , Melissa McCarthy , Iris Apatow    Genres   Romance , Comedy    




Judd Apatow&#39;s follow-up to Knocked-Up, This is 40 may not be the best of Judd Apatow&#39;s movies, but it&#39;s still an accurate look at middle-aged malaise. The film shifts focus away from Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl to Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as Pete and Debbie, a married couple whose lives are in a rut. Both couples celebrate their 40th birthdays in This is 40 and each day brings stress and regrets that threaten to upend their tenuous marriage. Rudd and Mann have excellent chemistry together and the script is as sharp as any Apatow production, but the two-hour-plus runtime can be a drag.

 18  Child’s Play (1988) 
The first appearance of the killer doll
        

 Child&#39;s Play 
Child&#39;s Play is a horror-slasher film by director Tom Holland and marked the beginning of the Chucky character from writer Don Mancini, a modern horror icon. When serial killer Charles Lee Ray is slain after a detective catches him, he transfers his soul before he dies into a Good Guy doll, which ends up in the hands of six-year-old Andy Barclay. Naming himself Chucky, the doll begins a killing spree, which leads those around Alex to suspect him as the killer - and his mother is the only one who believes him.
 Release Date   November 9, 1988    Cast   Catherine Hicks , Chris Sarandon , Brad Dourif , Alex Vincent , Dinah Manoff , Tommy Swerdlow , Jack Colvin , Raymond Oliver    Genres   Horror , Thriller    




Child&#39;s Play is the first film in the Chucky horror franchise and one of the more successful movies in the up-and-down eight films in the series, scoring a 73% on Rotten Tomatoes. This film introduces the &#34;Good Guy&#34; doll, a large animatronic doll with red hair that a young boy receives for his birthday. Little does he or his mother realize that the doll has been possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). Unlike future films in the franchise, Child&#39;s Play does not lean as hard into the comedy aspects of the story and is an unnerving horror film with genuine scares.

 Encanto 
Encanto tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charming (and enchanted) place called an Encanto. The magic of the Encanto has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal—every child except one, Mirabel (voice of Stephanie Beatriz). But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the Encanto is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might be her exceptional family’s last hope.

Encanto earned three Academy Award nominations and won for Best Animated Feature and was widely praised for its soundtrack and themes of generational trauma. It&#39;s a gorgeous film to look at and Mirabel&#39;s disappointment on her birthday is highly relatable for anyone expecting something to change when they reach a significant birthday milestone.

Inside, they find a wild party being thrown by Dr. Frank-N-Furter (Tim Curry), the occasion being the literal birthday of his creation, the titular Rocky (Peter Hinwood). Daffy, avant-garde, and totally charming, The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a cinematic extravaganza.

Carrey earned a Golden Globe nomination for his performance and the comedy was a massive box-office success, earning $303 million (via Box Office Mojo). It&#39;s a hilarious Carrey vehicle, but it&#39;s the heartfelt moments between father and son that make the movie memorable.

 13  Midsommar (2019) 
A psychedelic and nightmarish movie about trauma and ritual
        

 Midsommar 
Ari Aster&#39;s Midsommar follows a group of American college students who travel to a friend&#39;s isolated rural hometown in Sweden to experience their renowned midsummer festival. What starts out as idyllic quickly becomes a disconcertingly violent pagan ritual, with the friends engaged in a ruthless competition that will test more than just their friendship. Florence Pugh stars alongside Jack Reynor, Will Poulter, and William Jackson Harper.
 Release Date   July 3, 2019    Cast   Julia Ragnarsson , Rebecka Johnston , Henrik Norlén , William Jackson Harper , Gunnel Fred , Anna Åström , will poulter , Archie Madekwe , Louise Peterhoff , Björn Andrésen , Isabelle Grill , Jack Reynor , Florence Pugh , Liv Mjönes    Genres   Mystery , Drama , Horror    




Ari Aster&#39;s second movie, Midsommar is as unhinged and terrifying as Hereditary except that this film, unlike his first, is bathed in white, sunny light, offering a disorienting experience. Dani (Florence Pugh) is recovering from a traumatic loss when she decides to go along with her boyfriend and his friends to a Midsommar festival in Sweden where the people take ritual very seriously. Dani and Christian (Jack Reynor) have a very contentious relationship that is most easily defined by the scene when Christian forgets Dani&#39;s birthday and makes a pathetic attempt to cover for it. Even more telling, Dani lets his selfishness go without comment.

The animated film that launched a company
        

 Toy Story 
Pixar&#39;s first feature film release sees Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll, confronted by the nightmare of being replaced as his owner Andy&#39;s favorite toy jeopardized when his parents buy him a Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) action figure. Stricken by anxiety, Woody hatches a plan to remain the favorite, kicking off a race against time for the toys to be reunited with their owner before his house move makes them permanently Lost Toys.

As the first fully CGI film ever made and by a studio that had never produced a full-length movie, Toy Story was not guaranteed to be a success. Despite those hurdles, Toy Story was a runaway hit that earned $396 million (Box Office Mojo), garnered a perfect 100% on Rotten Tomatoes, was nominated for three Academy Awards, and paved the way for Pixar movies to lead the charge in what animated movies could accomplish.

 7  The Godfather: Part II (1974) 
The second film in the epic Corleone saga
        

 The Godfather Part II 
Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s The Godfather II continues Michael Corleone&#39;s story as he expands the Corleones&#39; presence as a crime syndicate. The film is also half devoted to the backstory of Vito Corleone, following his rise to power in 1920s New York City. While The Godfather is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather Part II was able to live up to the original and secure six Oscars at the 1975 Academy Awards.
 Release Date   December 20, 1974    Cast   Al Pacino , Robert De Niro , James Caan , Diane Keaton    Genres   Crime , Drama    




The Godfather: Part II would not be a birthday movie save for the crucial closing scene which puts everything that comes before it in tragic perspective. Considered one of the best movies of all time, The Godfather: Part II sees Michael (Al Pacino) descend further into evil as he tightens control over his family. At the end of the movie, a flashback to before The Godfather occurs. Everyone is celebrating Don Vito&#39;s (Marlon Brando) fiftieth birthday, when Michael announces he will be enlisting in WWII. His family is aghast, save for Fredo (John Cazale), who congratulates his brother. What should be heartwarming is tearjerking considering Fredo&#39;s fate at Michael&#39;s hands.

She goes through the hungover motions of her day before being violently murdered by a killer wearing a baby face mask. Tree then again wakes up on the morning of her birthday and soon realizes she&#39;s trapped in a time loop that always ends with her death. Violent, slapstick, and featuring a star-making performance from Rothe, Happy Death Day is a wonderful Groundhog Day-esque horror film that has a resonant lesson about making the most of one&#39;s time in life.

It set the template for the movies he would go on to make and Sixteen Candles perfectly encapsulates the high school years. It&#39;s timeless in its themes and characters. No other movie has captured the feeling of wanting a birthday to go perfectly and yet have it all go wrong. Romance, comedy, and teenage angst combine for the most memorable birthday cake scene in movies.
