  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The best birthday movies use the joy and celebration that&rsquo;s supposed to come with the day to make a point about expectations, regret, and the pressures of growing up; and, of course, sometimes a birthday movie is great because birthdays are just a lot of fun. There are films for Halloween, Christmas, St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, Valentine&rsquo;s Day, and every other holiday but birthdays are more personal, as they often bring up conflicting feelings. They&rsquo;re celebrations of maturity but also clear reminders of time passing, so a lot of feelings surround the weeks leading up to a birthday.
A movie can use a birthday as a shortcut to conflict, giving a character a reason they need to change. New Year&rsquo;s Eve may be the holiday when people make promises to work out more, but it&rsquo;s birthdays when they decide to take stock. With so many expectations put on birthdays, they inevitably are never the day one hopes for. However, they can often lead to some breakthrough about either how a character&rsquo;s life needs to change or how it&rsquo;s fine the way it is. Less philosophically, a birthday movie also gives a convenient reason to have a bunch of characters in the same location or simply kickstart a film&rsquo;s story.</p>

<p>19  This Is 40 (2012)
Judd Apatow&rsquo;s reflection on his own middle-age</p>
<p>This is 40
Judd Apatow returns to the life-comedy drama style of films with This Is 40, a side-sequel to 2007’s Knocked up. The movie stars Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as a married couple whose relationships are going through the motions as they approach forty years old and find themselves struggling to find time for each other. With the spark in their relationship seemingly flickering out, the two attempt to work on themselves – and each other – while dealing with their chaotic families.
Release Date   January 10, 2013    Cast   Paul Rudd , Melissa McCarthy , Iris Apatow    Genres   Romance , Comedy</p>
<p>Judd Apatow&rsquo;s follow-up to Knocked-Up, This is 40 may not be the best of Judd Apatow&rsquo;s movies, but it&rsquo;s still an accurate look at middle-aged malaise. The film shifts focus away from Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl to Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as Pete and Debbie, a married couple whose lives are in a rut. Both couples celebrate their 40th birthdays in This is 40 and each day brings stress and regrets that threaten to upend their tenuous marriage. Rudd and Mann have excellent chemistry together and the script is as sharp as any Apatow production, but the two-hour-plus runtime can be a drag.

<p>18  Child’s Play (1988)
The first appearance of the killer doll</p>
<p>Child&rsquo;s Play
Child&rsquo;s Play is a horror-slasher film by director Tom Holland and marked the beginning of the Chucky character from writer Don Mancini, a modern horror icon. When serial killer Charles Lee Ray is slain after a detective catches him, he transfers his soul before he dies into a Good Guy doll, which ends up in the hands of six-year-old Andy Barclay. Naming himself Chucky, the doll begins a killing spree, which leads those around Alex to suspect him as the killer - and his mother is the only one who believes him.
Release Date   November 9, 1988    Cast   Catherine Hicks , Chris Sarandon , Brad Dourif , Alex Vincent , Dinah Manoff , Tommy Swerdlow , Jack Colvin , Raymond Oliver    Genres   Horror , Thriller</p>
<p>Child&rsquo;s Play is the first film in the Chucky horror franchise and one of the more successful movies in the up-and-down eight films in the series, scoring a 73% on Rotten Tomatoes. This film introduces the &ldquo;Good Guy&rdquo; doll, a large animatronic doll with red hair that a young boy receives for his birthday. Little does he or his mother realize that the doll has been possessed by the spirit of serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif). Unlike future films in the franchise, Child&rsquo;s Play does not lean as hard into the comedy aspects of the story and is an unnerving horror film with genuine scares.
