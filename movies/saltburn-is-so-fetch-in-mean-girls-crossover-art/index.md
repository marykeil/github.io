## Literature Review



Saltburn and Mean Girls have formed a surprisingly fitting mashup in new artwork. Mean Girls is a teen comedy following transfer student Cady (Lindsay Lohan) attempting to take down the bullying group of girls known as The Plastics, led by Queen Bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams). On the other hand, Saltburn is a psychological thriller following lonely Oxford student Oliver (Barry Keoghan) as he spends the summer at Saltburn, the estate owned by the family of his rich and handsome friend Felix (Jacob Elordi), with whom he has a dangerous obsession.




Inspired by star Archie Madekwe comparing his character Farleigh to Regina George while promoting his role in his new movie Saltburn, artist Nico mashed up the thriller with Mean Girls. Check it out below:


 

The artwork shows Farleigh, the only character at Saltburn to distrust Oliver&#39;s intentions from the beginning and frequently seek to destabilize his position, posing like Regina George from the scene where she uses her Burn Book to sow chaos at school. The people fighting around him include Oliver and Felix, the rest of Felix&#39;s family, and their other down-on-their-luck guest, Pamela (Carey Mulligan).


 Saltburn Has Its Share Of Mean Girls Parallels 
          




This artwork unveils just how potent this comparison between Saltburn and Mean Girls characters actually is. While Farleigh is ultimately less successful than Regina, both use subtle forms of social manipulation to land their victims in hot water rather than directly attacking them. Farleigh&#39;s use of a karaoke song to humiliate Oliver and remind him of the fact that he&#39;s mooching off Felix&#39;s family fits in quite well with Regina&#39;s habit of using conversational traps to get people to express feelings that they never intended to say, and which she can use to taunt them.



One iconic moment from Mean Girls involves Cady saying &#34;thank you&#34; when Regina calls her &#34;really pretty,&#34; to which Regina responds &#34;So you agree? You think you&#39;re really pretty?&#34;




The fact that Saltburn is a period piece largely set in 2007 also puts it in a similar cultural time frame as Mean Girls, which was released and set in 2004. However, the similarities between the two movies go far deeper than those comparisons. Ultimately, both movies tell a story of class disparity. While Saltburn seeks to highlight the divide between the British upper and middle classes, Mean Girls focuses on popularity and social capital rather than money, though the characters&#39; financial status does also clearly have an impact on their esteem at school.




Because of this, Lohan&#39;s role in the Mean Girls cast has strong parallels with Keoghan&#39;s role in Saltburn. Both Cady and Oliver are attempting to infiltrate these upper-class groups and though they have different goals in mind, they are both briefly tempted away from their original missions by the trappings of class that spending time with those socially superior groups can provide. While this new artwork is primarily amusing, it also highlights the surprisingly similar social underpinnings of both stories.
