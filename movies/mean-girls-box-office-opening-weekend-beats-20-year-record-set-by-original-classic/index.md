## Literature Review

2024&#39;s Mean Girls is projected to have an opening gross even higher than the original 2004 teen classic over Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.




Mean Girls (2024) has broken the box office opening record set by the original 2004 movie of the same name. The new movie musical, which was written by Tina Fey, is an adaptation of the 2018 Broadway musical based on the 2004 comedy, which Fey also wrote, alongside composer Jeff Richmond and lyricist Nell Benjamin. It follows transfer student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) attempting to fit in at school and trying to help bring down the trio of bullying girls known as the Plastics, led by Queen Bee Regina George (RenÃ©e Rapp).




Per Deadline, the Mean Girls release is set to take No. 1 at the domestic box office in its opening weekend. Its projected 3-day gross is around $29 million while its 4-day gross over the holiday weekend is expected to be $31.5 million. This is considerably better than the 2004 original, which had a 3-day opening gross $24.4 million and a 4-day total of $25.6 million, though it didn&#39;t open over a holiday.


 How Will Mean Girls Compare To The Original By The End Of Its Run? 
          

Even though the Mean Girls musical has beaten the original&#39;s opening, it still has a long way to go if it wants to outgross the 2004 movie entirely. In addition to being a much-quoted classic, 2004&#39;s Mean Girls was a box office hit, becoming the 26th highest-grossing domestic movie of the year, above blockbusters including Alien vs. Predator, Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, and Lemony Snicket&#39;s Series of Unfortunate Events. Ultimately, with a domestic gross of $86 million and an international haul of $44 million, the movie grossed $130.1 million worldwide.




The new movie&#39;s success may end up depending on word of mouth. While the Mean Girls (2024) reviews are strong, earning a 70% score on Rotten Tomatoes, they can&#39;t quite compete with the Certified Fresh 84% of the original. Word of mouth could also be impacted by the fact that the movie wasn&#39;t advertised as a musical, which could potentially lead to audience consternation. However, the same advertising scheme didn&#39;t hurt the box office results of the 2023 holiday musical release Wonka, which became one of the top hits of the year.



While some of the Mean Girls (2024) trailers included a single sung line, the movie was largely presented as a straightforward remake rather than a musical.




Wonka opened somewhat higher than Mean Girls, with a 3-day opening gross of $39 million. However, if the new movie keeps up its pace relative to that 2023 release, which has so far earned a domestic total of $167.8 million, it could very well cross the $100 million mark in North America. Even if it earns a small international gross, the musical could very well pull ahead of the original movie with that kind of total.
