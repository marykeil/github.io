## SUMMARY 



  The DCEU had many controversial choices and uneven quality, resulting in mixed reviews from fans and critics.   The final DCEU movies underperformed at the box office.   &#34;Birds of Prey&#34; is the only DCEU film to have the same critics&#39; and audience score, while other movies like &#34;Aquaman&#34; and &#34;The Suicide Squad&#34; came close.

## Literature Review

Now that the DCEU has ended after ten years, there is only one movie in the entire cinematic universe that critics and the audience agree on.




The DCEU is over after ten years, but after several releases, critics and the audience can only agree on one movie. There have been some bad and great DCEU movies, with some releases even getting more hate than they deserved. That was due to how controversial DC&#39;s shared universe became over the years. Choices such as having Superman kill Zod, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&#39;s &#34;Martha&#34; moment, Jared Leto&#39;s take on the Joker, and The Flash&#39;s multiverse cameos were far from unanimous among DC fans and critics.




With the DCEU straying from the comics&#39; canon and new DC films being hit-or-miss, the shared universe would walk to a pitiful death in 2023. The DCEU saw all of its four final movies underperform at the box office, with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom having the best performance among the final DCEU releases. While their many controversies and the movies&#39; uneven quality affected reviews, the DCEU&#39;s films continued to have a loyal, vocal group of fans, which led to a dissonance in many movies&#39; reviews. Even with the fans and the critics&#39; opinions on almost all DCEU movies being often different, there was one film that united them.

                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far    James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.   


 Birds Of Prey Has The Same Audience And Critics RT Score 
The Only One Of The DCEU&#39;s 16 Movies To Do So
         




There are 16 DCEU movies in total — counting both 2017&#39;s Justice League and 2021&#39;s Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League as the different entities that they are — but only 2020&#39;s Birds of Prey was able to unite critics and the audience. According to the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, Birds of Prey is the only DCEU film to have the same critics&#39; and audience score. Margot Robbie&#39;s Birds of Prey stands at a 78 percent Tomatometer score, which is also how much the audience score for the DCEU film marks.



 Other DCEU Movies That Audiences And Critics Came   On 
Some DCEU Movies Have Short Gaps Between Their RT Scores
          

While Birds of Prey is the only DCEU movie to have the same RT score with critics and the audience alike, a few other entries in the shared universe came close to that feat. The DCEU movie with the shortest gap between its audience and critics&#39; scores on Rotten Tomatoes is 2018&#39;s Aquaman. Jason Momoa&#39;s first solo film as Arthur Curry has only a 6 percent difference between its 66 percent critics score and the movie&#39;s 72 percent with fans.




Following Aquaman, there are two DCEU movies with an 8 percent gap. 2019&#39;s Shazam! and 2021&#39;s The Suicide Squad both boast exciting 90 percent critics&#39; and 82 percent audience scores. It is interesting to note how Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn impacts the consensus between critics and fans. The actress is the main star of 2020&#39;s Birds of Prey, with Robbie&#39;s Harley also playing a key role in James Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad. With Gunn revealing that he wants Robbie to be the DCU&#39;s Harley Quinn, perhaps the new universe can keep this impressive DCEU statistic going.
