## Literature Review



Henry Cavill is about to have a dominant first half of 2024. The celebrated actor, best known for his rendition of Superman/Clark Kent in the modern DCEU which began with 2013&#39;s Man of Steel, has made some more career-changing moves over the last few years that have opened up his schedule like never before. With confirmation that Cavill will not be returning as Superman/Clark Kent as part of James Gunn&#39;s revamped DCEU, and knowing that Cavill&#39;s time as Geralt from The Witcher is finished, the actor is set to bounce back in other major ways this year.




Cavill has appeared in several major franchises over the last decade or so including Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Netflix&#39;s Sherlock Holmes spinoff Enola Holmes, and even appeared as an antagonist in 2018&#39;s Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which is considered the best film of the series. Cavill has also been rumored to be a contender to take the reins from Daniel Craig with the highly lucrative James Bond franchise, although as time goes on the chance of that happening becomes less and less likely.

 Henry Cavill Has Two Movies Coming Out A Few Months Apart 
   Close     




Cavill has two major feature films that are set to release in the first half of 2024 within a few months of each other. The highly stylized spy action thriller Argylle will be released on February 2, 2024, in which Cavill stars alongside Sofia Boutella, Bryce Dallas Howard, and pop artist Dua Lipa. The film will feature many guest appearances from the likes of Academy Award-winner Sam Rockwell, Samuel L. Jackson, Bryan Cranston, Catherine O&#39;Hara, John Cena, and Ariana DeBose. With Cavill in a lead role, Argylle is shaping up to be one of the most exciting early releases of 2024.

Just a few months after Argylle&#39;s release, Guy Ritchie&#39;s war drama The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare will come out on April 19, 2024. The film should certainly draw some major attention after Ritchie&#39;s celebrated 2023 war film The Covenant starring Jake Gyllenhaal won over both critics and audiences. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare will follow the true story of a group of specialized covert British operatives fighting against Nazi forces during World War II. Cavill will star alongside Reacher frontman Alan Ritchson.




              Related   Henry Cavill&#39;s New Spy Movie Isn&#39;t The Real Obstacle To His James Bond 26 Casting   With Henry Cavill set to appear in another spy movie, many feel his chances of being Bond are over. However, the new film isn&#39;t the real problem.    



 Their Success Can Prove He Doesn&#39;t Need The Witcher 
          

If both Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare prove to be critical or box office successes, or both, then it will be clear that Cavill made the right decision in stepping away from his beloved role as Geralt of Rivia in Netflix&#39;s The Witcher series. Both films look to be incredibly promising, with Argyle set to be a fun genre-blending blockbuster and Ministry&#39;s potential to be one of Ritchie&#39;s best films. 2024 will be a pivotal, and possibly an incredibly dominating, year in movies for Henry Cavill.
