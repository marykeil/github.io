## Literature Review

The original Avengers team might be the MCU&#39;s most iconic, but it is far from the only one, and the many Avengers rosters have differing power levels.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe has seen the rise of multiple Avengers teams over the years, and some of them are stronger than others. The first of the MCU&#39;s Avengers movies was 2012&#39;s The Avengers, which established the team as the most important for Marvel going forward. While multiple other teams have emerged in the MCU since the creation of the Avengers, no Marvel live-action team has been more powerful than the Avengers.
Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes might have started with the original team led by Chris Evans&#39; Captain America and Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Iron Man, but since the Avengers were created, the team has gone through quite a few roster changes. More than that, over the timeline of the MCU, animated and live-action projects have brought forward very different versions of Marvel&#39;s Avengers. Each iteration of the team varies in their heroes&#39; abilities, leading to a diverse power ranking for the MCU&#39;s Avengers teams.

 11  Honorable Mention: The Young Avengers 
The MCU Team Is Slowly Forming
        

The Young Avengers have yet to debut in the MCU; however, the team is clearly underway. The Marvels revealed that Ms. Marvel is assembling her own team of young heroes, with the character recruiting Kate Bishop, the new Hawkeye, and mentioning Ant-Man&#39;s daughter, Cassie Lang. With many powerful young heroes introduced recently in the MCU, such as Wanda&#39;s twin sons — Wiccan and Speed — the Hulk&#39;s son, Skaar, and the multiverse-hopping America Chavez, the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers could be one of Marvel&#39;s most powerful teams.





 10  1988&#39;s Avengers 
Marvel&#39;s First Avengers Team Has Been Revealed


 







Disney&#43;&#39;s What If...? season 2 included an episode that revealed the first iteration of the Avengers in one of the MCU&#39;s many timelines. The 1988 version of the team was quite powerful, including the might of Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Thor, who is part of many different Avengers teams. Besides the powerful MCU character, the 1988 Avengers team includes Hank Pym&#39;s Ant-Man and Bill Foster&#39;s Giant-Man, giving the team a dual Pym Particle threat, as well as T&#39;Chaka&#39;s Black Panther, the Winter Soldier, and a cosmically altered Mar-Vell. While powerful, the team lacks a diversity of abilities among its members.
The 1988 Avengers ranked by importance:
 Ant-Man 
 Thor 
 Winter Soldier 
 Giant-Man 
 Mar-Vell 
 Black Panther 






 9  Team Cap 
Civil War&#39;s Weakest Team
        

Captain America: Civil War pitted two Avengers teams against each other. While Captain America&#39;s Avengers had a major MCU heavy-hitter in the Scarlet Witch, the team was not the most powerful squad in the movie, let alone the MCU. Ant-Man provided some nice variety to the team, being able to get big or small to take on enemies as needed. However, the team having two super soldiers and Hawkeye, who is important but not exactly powerful, leads to its low ranking. Team Cap&#39;s good team skills make up for some of the lack of strength.
Team Cap ranked by importance:
 Captain America 
 Scarlet Witch 
 Ant-Man 
 Winter Soldier 
 Hawkeye 






 8  Team Iron Man 
Civil War&#39;s Most Powerful Team
        

Team Iron Man was the most powerful of the two Avengers teams in Captain America: Civil War. While the team lacked a magic user like the Scarlet Witch, Iron Man&#39;s hero squad featured a better variety of skills. Vision was the team&#39;s heavy-hitter, powered by the Infinity Stone on his forehead. Adding to that, Team Iron Man had the technological marvel of Iron Man and War Machine, the hand-to-hand skills of Black Widow and Black Panther, and the debut of Spider-Man and all the skills he possesses in the MCU.
Team Iron Man ranked by importance:
 Iron Man 
 Vision 
 Spider-Man 
 Black Panther 
 War Machine 
 Black Widow 






 7  Age Of Ultron&#39;s New Avengers 
Captain America Formed A Different Team
        

Captain America and Black Widow teamed up to announce the MCU&#39;s new Avengers team at the end of 2015&#39;s Avengers: Age of Ultron. This team had quite an interesting configuration, adding one of the MCU&#39;s most powerful magic users in Elizabeth Olsen&#39;s Scarlet Witch, as well as Paul Bettany&#39;s Vision, who possesses a wide array of abilities. While War Machine acted as the team&#39;s Iron Man, the Age of Ultron New Avengers are low on the list due to the team&#39;s lack of raw strength.
The Age of Ultron New Avengers ranked by importance:
 Captain America 
 Black Widow 
 Scarlet Witch 
 Vision 
 War Machine 
 Falcon 






 6  Avengers 1602 
The Medieval Avengers Are Formidable
        

What If...? season 2&#39;s episodes saw the debut of multiple Avengers teams. The year 1602 brought along an incredibly compelling and powerful team that featured the magic skills of the Scarlet Witch combined with the raw strength of the Hulk and super soldiers like Captain Carter, Rogers Hood, and more. With Ant-Man, Nick Fury, and Tony Stark, the 1602 Avengers were presented as a well-rounded team that could take on many strong foes. Scarlet Witch&#39;s ability to summon characters from across the multiverse also helped the team&#39;s power level.
1602 Avengers ranked by importance:
 Captain Carter 
 Scarlet Witch 
 Hulk 
 Rogers Hood 
 Tony Stark 
 Ant-Man 
 Nick Fury 






 5  The Original Avengers 
The MCU&#39;s Most Popular Version Of Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes
        

The MCU&#39;s original Avengers team continues as one of the strongest versions of Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes. The squad had major players such as Hulk and Thor, who could deal with almost all the villains the MCU has introduced so far by themselves. Iron Man&#39;s genius intellect and power armor, as well as Captain America&#39;s leadership skills and super soldier abilities made the team stronger. Black Widow and Hawkeye offered different skill sets that complemented the team. Save for its lack of magic, the original Avengers were one of the most balanced versions of the team.
The Original Avengers ranked by importance:
 Iron Man 
 Captain America 
 Thor 
 Hulk 
 Black Widow 
 Hawkeye

 4  Captain Carter&#39;s Multiverse Avengers 
The Guardians Of The Multiverse
        

What If...? season 1&#39;s Guardians of the Multiverse featured heroes from all over the multiverse. Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s Strange Supreme recently showed in What If...? season 2 that he is one of the most powerful MCU characters ever, leading to the team getting a major power boost. Add in powerful heroes such as Thor and Captain Carter, as well as the different abilities of the rest of the crew, and the Guardians of the Multiverse cover pretty much every base.
Captain Carter&#39;s Multiverse Avengers ranked by importance:
 Strange Supreme 
 Captain Carter 
 Thor 
 Killmonger 
 Gamora 
 Star-Lord 
 Black Widow 






 3  Infinity War&#39;s Avengers Team 
The Avengers&#39; Roster Expands


 







Avengers: Infinity War separated the MCU&#39;s main heroes into two teams, as Captain America: Civil War left the Avengers broken. Both teams were quite powerful, with the Avengers on Titan counting with Doctor Strange, Iron Man, and Spider-Man, plus the Guardians of the Galaxy. On Earth, Captain America fought alongside heroes such as the Scarlet Witch, Thor, and Black Panther. While the movie&#39;s two Avengers teams were quite balanced, the fact that members like the Hulk and Scarlet Witch were not at optimal strength or were sidelined hurt the team.





 2  Phase 5&#39;s Unseen Avengers 
Avengers: The Kang Dynasty Will Debut A New Team
        

While the MCU has yet to reveal who will be part of Phase 5&#39;s new Avengers team, some players have already been teased. Captain Marvel and the Hulk seemingly recruited Shang-Chi at the end of his solo movie for the team, making three powerful characters for the new Avengers. Other MCU veterans like Spider-Man, Sam Wilson as Captain America, and Doctor Strange — who could be the new Avengers leader due to his connection to the multiverse — are likely to be part of the team. With that variety of powers and experience, plus possibly new characters like She-Hulk and Daredevil, Phase 5&#39;s Avengers will be quite powerful.

 1  Endgame&#39;s Avengers 
The Most Powerful Versions Of The Avengers


 







Like Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame had two versions of the MCU&#39;s premiere team. The first iteration of the team in the movie was the one responsible for the Time Heist, which stands as the MCU&#39;s second most powerful Avengers team, featuring characters like Thor, Captain Marvel, Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, and many more. Then came the MCU&#39;s most powerful Avengers team, which included pretty much every MCU hero alive at the time of Avengers: Endgame&#39;s final battle. The battle united the MCU&#39;s most powerful heroes and gave Captain America a major power boost through Mjolnir, creating the MCU&#39;s most powerful Avengers team.
