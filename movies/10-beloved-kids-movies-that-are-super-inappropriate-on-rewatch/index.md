## Literature Review

Despite their target audience being children, these movies include a few too many mature jokes or create villains that are the stuff of nightmares.




Children&#39;s movies are a beloved genre, live-action and animated alike, but sometimes filmmakers include a few too many elements for the parents that push the film over the line into being inappropriate. This doesn&#39;t mean the film is wholly unsuitable for young eyes, but it might be best for the littlest kids to wait a few years before watching one of these classics. These films don&#39;t just have a couple of risqué jokes, but overtly mature subtext and terrifying antagonists that will keep any viewer up at night.
When returning to a classic family-friendly film from childhood, it can be shocking to discover how much goes over a child&#39;s head and how adult the themes can get. Besides sexual innuendos and horror movie elements, there are sometimes tragic and emotionally taxing themes that are even more apparent when watching as an adult. Children often understand more than adults realize and can pick up on the subtleties incorporated in even the most innocent films.

 10  Coraline (2009) 
Directed by Henry Selick


 







  Coraline  


  Release Date    February 5, 2009     Director    Henry Selick     Cast    Dakota Fanning , Teri Hatcher , Jennifer Saunders , Dawn French , Keith David , John Hodgman     Rating    PG     Runtime    100 minutes     Genres    Family , Animation , Thriller , Fantasy , Drama     Writers    Henry Selick , Neil Gaiman     Budget    $60 million     Studio(s)    Focus Features     Distributor(s)    Focus Features    


Based on Neil Gaiman&#39;s novel of the same name, Coraline doesn&#39;t shy away from the darker aspect of childhood, dealing with themes of loneliness and isolation in addition to the terrifying visuals. When Coraline (Dakota Fanning) moves to a new house, she feels ignored by her parents and lost in her new environment. When she stumbles upon a portal to another world, it seems like a dream come true, but it turns into a nightmare. The residents of the Other World are some of the most intense and vicious villains in any children&#39;s movie. Though Coraline escapes in the end it&#39;s not without going through more than any child should.





 9  Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory (1971) 
Directed by Mel Stuart
        

  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  


  Release Date    June 30, 1971     Director    Mel Stuart     Cast    Jack Albertson , gene wilder , Peter Ostrum , Denise Nickerson , Julie Dawn Cole     Rating    G     Runtime    100 minutes     Genres    Family , Musical , Fantasy     Writers    Roald Dahl     Budget    $3 million     Studio(s)    Paramount Pictures     Distributor(s)    Paramount Pictures    


Gene Wilder might still be considered the definitive Willy Wonka, but the classic 1971 adaptation of the children&#39;s story is not as sweet as it seems on the outside. Wonka spends the entirety of the film essentially weeding out the children to find one that lives up to his expectations with little regard for their physical well-being. Additionally, the notorious boat ride scene has frequently drawn comparisons to an acid trip with its psychedelic visuals and the eerie song that Wonka sings throughout the ride. It&#39;s one of the most famous and most unsettling parts of the film.

 8  Labyrinth (1986) 
Directed by Jim Henson
        

  Labyrinth  


  Release Date    June 27, 1986     Director    Jim Henson     Cast    Christopher Malcolm , Toby Froud , Shelley Thompson , Jennifer Connelly , David Bowie     Rating    PG     Runtime    101 minutes     Genres    Fantasy , Family , Adventure , Musical     Writers    Terry Jones     Budget    $25 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures , Columbia Pictures , Sony    


Starring David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, Labyrinth leans too heavily into stylization and fails to provide any morals or lessons for the children watching. After Jareth kidnaps the baby brother of Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), she must solve a terrifying labyrinth to save him from being turned into a goblin. Having the stakes of a movie be the death of an infant is a bold move for any film, children&#39;s or not, and the young Sarah is frequently put into life-threatening situations as she solves the labyrinth.
Perhaps even more unsettling than the danger is Jareth and Sarah&#39;s relationship. Jareth, who is much older than Sarah, reveals that his true goal is for her to love him, and the predatory overtones can be difficult to stomach. His desire for a relationship with this teenage girl is more than implied, and though Sarah escapes victorious, it&#39;s unlikely that such a film would be made for kids today.





 7  Bee Movie (2007) 
Directed by Simon J. Smith &amp; Steve Hickner
        

Bee Movie is a well-known animated comedy film that delves into a fictional world where bees can talk, and they&#39;re tired of making all the world&#39;s honey. Though there are plenty of innocuous and family-friendly plot lines in the movie, the relationship between Barry (Jerry Seinfeld) the bee and Vanessa (Renée Zellweger) the human is not only improbable but pushes the edge of impropriety. Barry&#39;s desire for Vanessa is explicitly stated, and many innuendos are used to communicate the way he feels about her. Jokes using the reproductive organs of flowers are frequent devices that leave little to the imagination.





 6  The Mask (1994) 
Directed by Charles Russell
        

  The Mask  


  Release Date    July 29, 1994     Director    Chuck Russell     Cast    Richard Jeni , Peter Riegert , Peter Greene , Cameron Diaz , Amy Yasbeck , Jim Carrey     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    101 minutes     Genres    Crime , Action , Fantasy , Comedy     Writers    Mike Werb     Budget    $23 million     Studio(s)    New Line Cinema     Distributor(s)    New Line Cinema , Warner Bros. Pictures    


Ultimately, The Mask is about learning to accept oneself and gaining confidence, but in between those valuable lessons are lots of sexual jokes made at the expense of the women in the film. Specifically, Cameron Diaz, who plays Tina, the love interest of the protagonist Stanley (Jim Carrey). Most of the jokes are relatively harmless, but there are lots of them, coupled with lots of swearing and enough violence to be scary. The message that to be confident, a person must be a womanizer is not something that children should learn from films.





 5  Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) 
Directed by Chris Columbus


 







  Mrs. Doubtfire  


  Release Date    November 24, 1993     Director    Chris Columbus     Cast    Pierce Brosnan , Mara Wilson , Robin Williams , Sally Field , Matthew Lawrence     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    125 minutes     Genres    Drama , Family , Comedy     Writers    Leslie Dixon , Randi Mayem Singer     Budget    $25 million     Studio(s)    20th Century     Distributor(s)    20th Century    


Tricking a spouse is always wrong, even if it is for the benefit of the kids, and delivers many hilarious moments. In Mrs. Doubtfire, it&#39;s Robin William&#39;s improv and performance that makes the film but they are also the reason there&#39;s an R-rated cut of Mrs. Doubtfire that wasn&#39;t released to the public. Williams is usually the one delivering lines with sexual references, and making less than suitable hand gestures at other characters in the movie. Additionally, the film does deal with serious topics of divorce and familial drama, which can be a tough subject for some children.





 4  Gremlins (1984) 
Directed by Joe Dante
        

  Gremlins  


  Release Date    June 7, 1984     Director    Joe Dante     Cast    Phoebe Cates , Corey Feldman , Zach Galligan , Hoyt Axton , Polly Holliday , Howie Mandel     Rating    PG     Runtime    106 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Fantasy , Horror     Writers    Chris Columbus     Budget    $11 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. , Amblin Entertainment     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Franchise(s)    Gremlins 3    


Everything that can go wrong, does go wrong in the &#39;80s classic Gremlins. What audiences sometimes don&#39;t remember about the iconic film is how violent and terrifying the titular gremlins get. The villainous creatures kill, torture, and kidnap the humans in the movie, putting them in very real and horrifying danger. Due to this, the only way to stop these otherworldly monsters is to kill them, a position that few children&#39;s films put their protagonists in. All the death, destruction, and mayhem lead to a very different viewing of the film later in life.
            
 
 The Original Gremlins Movie Was Almost Darker (&amp; Had Bigger Deaths) 
Joe Dante&#39;s Gremlins is a dark movie, but the original Gremlins script had some incredibly gory deaths that were cut from the final film.








 3  Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) 
Directed by Robert Zemeckis
        

  Who Framed Roger Rabbit*  


  Release Date    June 22, 1988     Director    Robert Zemeckis     Cast    Amy Irving , Christopher Lloyd , Charles Fleischer , Bob Hoskins , Kathleen Turner     Rating    PG     Runtime    104 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Family , Mystery , Animation , Crime , Adventure , Fantasy     Writers    Peter S. Seaman , Jeffrey Price     Budget    $70 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Though it holds up in quality, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is so overtly sexual and violent that it calls into question whether it should be considered a film for kids at all. Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner) is supposed to be provocative, and this is the fuel for many of the more explicit references in the movie, but her character design alone is a warning that kids should wait to watch the movie. Additionally, even the cartoon brutality that the toons and humans face feels all too real. The chemical Dip that Judge Doom (Christopher Llyod) uses against the toons is reminiscent of terrifying chemical attacks.





 2  Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) 
Directed by Ken Hughes
        

The fairytale romp starring Dick Van Dyke and Sally Ann Howes, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, holds an equal amount of escapist fantasy and caution for any child watching. In the imaginary land of Vulgaria, Caractacus Potts (Van Dyke) and his children face constant danger along with Truly Scrumptious (Howes), including the terrifying Child Catcher (Robert Helpmann). Easily one of the most slimy and unseemly of villains, the Child Catcher snatches up any child he sees, a horrifying prospect for an audience of youngsters. Although even the children in the film know Potts&#39; story isn&#39;t real, it doesn&#39;t change how visceral the perils are.





 1  The Black Cauldron (1985) 
Directed by Ted Berman &amp; Richard Rich


 







The Black Cauldron was not one of Disney&#39;s major successes for many reasons. Though some come down to the budgetary restrictions and re-used animated sequences that the film employs, another is the darkness of both the source material and the resulting film. Based on The Chronicles of Prydain series, the central villain of the story, the Horned King (John Hurt), is depicted as a skeleton with horns and lurks in the shadows of the film with sinister intentions. Additionally, the hero of the film, Taran (Grant Bardsley), has a journey full of adult themes that are a distinct departure from Disney&#39;s lighter work.
