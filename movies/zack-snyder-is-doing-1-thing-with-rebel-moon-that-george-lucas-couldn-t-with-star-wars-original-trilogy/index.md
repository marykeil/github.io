# Zack Snyder Is Doing 1 Thing With Rebel Moon That George Lucas Couldn t With Star Wars  Original Trilogy


## SUMMARY 



  Zack Snyder has outperformed George Lucas in the aspect of directing his franchise, as he helmed both the first two Rebel Moon movies, while Lucas stepped away from directing after the first Star Wars film.   Snyder&#39;s plans to create a &#34;trilogy of sequels&#34; for Rebel Moon aligns with Lucas directing four Star Wars movies before selling the rights to Disney, indicating that Snyder could potentially direct as many films in his franchise as Lucas did in Star Wars.   By directing the first two Rebel Moon movies, Snyder has achieved the milestone of directing two films in his franchise much quicker than Lucas did with Star Wars, giving him a head start in matching Lucas&#39;s directing record.

## Literature Review

Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon franchise was inspired by George Lucas&#39; Star Wars, but the former has already beaten the latter to the punch in one area.




Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire has drawn a lot of comparisons to George Lucas&#39; original Star Wars trilogy, but Snyder has already outperformed his fellow director in one key area. Both men have been heavily involved in the production of their creations, with both earning writing and directing credits in their respective franchises. However, the Rebel Moon writer/director has quickly topped Lucas in at least one regard.




Rebel Moon started as a Star Wars pitch that Lucasfilm rejected. While Snyder did rework the idea so he could produce the movie independently, the inspiration is still there for all to see. Although it&#39;s not confirmed how many Rebel Moon movies there are going to be, Snyder has stated he wants to make a &#34;trilogy of sequels&#34; to the first installment. A Child of Fire and Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver are the only confirmed entries into the Rebel Moon canon, but Snyder&#39;s consistent role in each of these two movies represents something Lucas was incapable of doing.

                  10 Similarities Between Rebel Moon And The Star Wars Original Trilogy   Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon was once pitched as a Star Wars story, and the influence of George Lucas&#39; work is still easy to spot in the finished product.   


 Zack Snyder Directed Both Of The First Two Rebel Moon Movies 
George Lucas took a break from directing after Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope
          




George Lucas was the sole writer and director for 1977&#39;s Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope. For the 1980 sequel, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas stepped away from his previous role. Although he is credited as penning the story for Episode V, the screenplay itself was written by Leigh Bracket and Lawrence Kasdan. Despite remaining a big part of the process of making the first Star Wars sequel, Lucas also passed his directorial duties onto Irvin Kershner. Similarly, Lucas appointed Richard Marquand to direct Star Wars: Episode VI: Return of the Jedi.

Zack Snyder also adopted a dual role for his franchise starter, taking to the director&#39;s chair and contributing to the screenplay for A Child of Fire. The difference emerges when the second Rebel Moon movie is taken into account. Not only did Snyder form the same writing trio of himself, Kurt Johnstad, and Shay Hatten, but he also remained in place as his sequel&#39;s director. Therefore, Snyder can lay claim to the fact that he directed the first two Rebel Moon movies, whereas George Lucas ended his streak before it could begin by reassigning the task after A New Hope​​​​​​.






 Zack Snyder Might Direct As Many Rebel Moon Movies As George Lucas Did Star Wars Movies 
The Rebel Moon director could make as many as four films within his franchise
         

In total, Lucas directed four Star Wars movies before selling the rights to Disney in 2012. In 1999, he reclaimed his directing duties with the prequel trilogy, starting with Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and ending with 2005&#39;s Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. He hasn&#39;t led a Star Wars movie since he sold Lucasfilm, with all later entries into the Skywalker Saga being produced by Disney.

                  What Zack Snyder Is Doing With Rebel Moon That Differs From Star Wars &amp; George Lucas   Rebel Moon has some similarities to Star Wars, but it&#39;s because Zack Snyder and George Lucas had a very similar creative process and inspirations.   

Credited as the director of the first two Rebel Moon movies, Snyder is already halfway to equaling Lucas&#39; tally. If Snyder&#39;s plans to make and direct two more Rebel Moon sequels pay off, then he&#39;ll be on level footing with the Star Wars creator. However, while Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire may currently be the only entry, the upcoming sequel gives Snyder the honor of directing two of his franchise&#39;s movies much quicker than Lucas did with Star Wars.






Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is available to stream on Netflix, with Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver also coming to Netflix in April 2024. All the Star Wars movies are on Disney&#43;.
