## Literature Review



January 2024 is kicking off the year on the right foot, and it’s arriving with exciting movie releases, as are the musical version of a beloved teen comedy, David Ayer’s latest project, a drama movie starring Jenna Ortega, and more. 2023 was a big year for cinema, with Barbie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie dominating the box office and movies like Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon becoming some of the best films in recent years. December 2023 closed the year on a high note with a variety of movie releases, though it stayed away from typical Christmas content.




December welcomed movies like Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé, Hayao Miyazaki’s The Boy and the Heron, Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things, the musical Wonka, the DCEU’s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the biographical sports dramas The Iron Claw and Ferrari, and the rom-com Anyone But You. As expected, January will be a slower month in terms of theatrical releases, but it will bring a variety of titles for everyone to enjoy. Among January’s theatrical releases are a supernatural horror movie, a musical, David Ayer’s latest action movie, and more.
