## Literature Review

Despite Dolph Lundgren&#39;s return, Expendables 4 didn&#39;t perform well among various reasons. However, there&#39;s one thing that could improve the sequel.




Veteran actor and series regular Dolph Lundgren is open to an Expendables 5 return under one very specific condition, and it highlights the problem in replacing Sylvester Stallone. The veteran action star has appeared in all four movies in the Expendables franchise as Gunner Jensen with varying levels of screentime, but his possible return in a fifth installment in a much greater capacity could revitalize the long-running franchise while also renewing widespread interest in it. While Expendables 4 didn&#39;t impress at the box office or with critics, Lundgren&#39;s return in Expendables 5 could rectify its predecessor&#39;s mistakes.




Lundgren recently spoke with Screen Rant while promoting 2023&#39;s Wanted Man, an action movie that Lundgren wrote, directed, produced, and starred in alongside Kelsey Grammer. In addition to speaking about his extensive body of work within the action movie genre including his contributions to the previous entries in the Expendables franchise, Lundgren readily provided the condition that Hollywood would need to meet in order to secure the action star for a possible Expendables 5 return:



Yeah, if Sly&#39;s in charge, I think he&#39;s working on his version of another chapter with these guys. If he&#39;s in charge, then yeah, I&#39;m sure it would be fun to work on it.





 Dolph Lundgren Is Right: Expendables 5 Needs Sylvester Stallone 
Stallone&#39;s role in Expendables 4 was considerably reduced.
          

Expendables 4&#39;s lackluster performance critically and commercially justify Lundgren&#39;s recent comments about the fourth entry&#39;s failure and make a strong case for Stallone&#39;s return in Expendables 5. Not only would the fifth installment need Stallone to return, but they would need the action star&#39;s vision and prowess behind the camera to help guide things in the proper direction, as well as his charm and charisma in front of it to keep audiences engaged with the material. Although Jason Statham is one of the industry&#39;s best action stars, it&#39;s hard to imagine anyone replacing Stallone as the series&#39; lead.




While Stallone&#39;s greatly reduced presence in Expendables 4 severely hurt its performance, other factors such as the overall lack of star power, extended break between the third and fourth movies, and other action movie alternatives like the John Wick franchise have also contributed to Expendables 4&#39;s failure. For Expendables 5 to return, the franchise would need to go back to the drawing board and ensure the story isn&#39;t too ridiculous, the special effects are convincing, and the plot challenges viewers on some level. Those factors combined with Stallone&#39;s increased presence will make Expendables 5 a guaranteed success.

                  12 Action Stars Expendables 5&#39;s Cast Needs To Revive The Franchise   The Expendables 4&#39;s lackluster performance proves the franchise might need new talent to help keep the series running. Here are some suggestions.   



 Why The Expendables Franchise Cannot Replace Sylvester Stallone 
Stallone is the protagonist and face of the Expendables franchise
         




The Expendables franchise desperately needs Stallone&#39;s increased presence both in front of and behind the camera, because he conceptualized the franchise and has proven time and again throughout his career that he&#39;s just as likable with audiences as he is bankable with the studios. Furthermore, the Expendables franchise was predicated on the idea of aging &#39;80s action stars banding together and taking on modern threats, an interesting and fun idea on its own. Still, subsequent entries have strayed further away from it. Expendables 5 would need to bring Stallone and those elements back to be a return to form.

While Jason Statham is a beloved and respected action star, he&#39;s not Stallone. The Transporter, Crank, and Fast &amp; Furious movies, along with 2023&#39;s The Beekeeper, are more in Statham&#39;s lane, since they&#39;re pretty self-aware and cater more to his sensibilities and audience. While Statham has been prominently featured throughout the entire Expendables franchise, he thrived in his role as Stallone&#39;s right-hand man rather than becoming the series&#39; protagonist. The decision to beef up Statham&#39;s role and reduce Stallone&#39;s doesn&#39;t feel natural and the franchise would benefit from returning things to the way they were in Expendables 5.






 Will The Expendables 5 Happen (&amp; Will Stallone Return)? 
The Expendables 5 and Stallone&#39;s return are uncertain
          

Although nothing is set in stone yet and the poor performance of Expendables 4 hurt the franchise&#39;s reputation, nothing&#39;s off the table yet, as Stallone, Statham, and plenty of other frequent stars in the franchise are all alive and well and still working. With 2022&#39;s Samaritan and 2023&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Stallone is still displaying his affinity for action vehicles despite his old age. Furthermore, Stallone&#39;s guaranteed return to Expendables 5 in an increased capacity would be more than enough to generate interest for the possible sequel.

Once again, The Expendables became the pop-culture success that it is because of its simple premise of aging action stars from years past banding together to take on international threats was more than enough to generate hype and sustain audience engagement. While newer, younger action stars are appreciated, they should purely be support, and despite Statham&#39;s legacy, he can&#39;t replace Stallone. If Expendables 5 adheres to a similar formula, the chances of a fifth installment happening and Stallone returning would be much more likely, thus contributing to the franchise&#39;s return to form.
