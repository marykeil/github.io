It&#39;s now much easier to find and watch the very best movies with streaming services, and some of the films were even made exclusively for streaming platforms. Movies new and old often benefit from being available on streaming services, such as Dredd becoming a Netflix hit 11 years after it was a box office bomb. However, not all 2023 streaming hits were theatrical bombs, as some of the best movies of 2023 are now available to stream too. Here are the best new movies to watch on streaming right now across different platforms.
