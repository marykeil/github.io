## Literature Review

Brother directing duo Josh and Benny Safdie break up in advance of Uncut Gems reunion film with Adam Sandler, a project which is now &#34;on pause.&#34; 




Hit directing duo the Safdie brothers have split up ahead of their next project with Adam Sandler. Composed of brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, the duo is known for their work on breakout independent films Uncut Gems and Good Time. Following the success of Uncut Gems, the pair of directors were previously signed on to direct another movie with Sandler.




According to Variety, the Safdie brothers have split up in advance of their next feature with Sandler. Benny Safdie explained to the source that he and his brother Josh will part ways as he breaks out into solo directing. This leaves a previously-announced project with Sandler and Meghan Thee Stallion “on pause.” When asked whether he would return to direct with his brother Josh again, Safdie responded a vague “I don’t know.” Check out Benny Safdie’s commentary on the split below:


It’s a natural progression of what we each want to explore. I will direct on my own, and I will explore things that I want to explore. I want that freedom right now in my life.



 What Do the Safdies’ Next Projects Look Like After The Split? 
          



Benny Safdie’s split from Josh also comes after a year of the creative breaking out into his own roles multiple times.







The announcement of the Safdie brothers split comes shortly after news of Benny Safdie’s upcoming solo directing effort. Safdie’s film, titled The Smashing Machine, is a collaboration with actor Dwayne Johnson. In the biopic film, Johnson will play MMA fighter Mark Kerr, portraying his career from his rise to success to struggles with addiction.

                  Every Safdie Brothers&#39; Feature-Length Film, Ranked (According To Rotten Tomatoes)   Rotten Tomatoes ranks the feature-length movies of the Safdie Brothers, two acclaimed directors known most recently for their Uncut Gems.   

Benny Safdie’s split from Josh also comes after a year of the creative breaking out into his own roles multiple times. Benny Safdie explored his acting career further, playing a scientist in the hit Christopher Nolan film Oppenheimer, as well as a role in the TV series The Curse, which he also co-created with Nathan Fielder. Safdie also acted in Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, proving his range.




Now that the Safdie brothers’ dual directing effort is “on pause” for a seemingly indefinite amount of time, it will be interesting to see where Josh Safdie will make his next move. Though Benny Safdie’s statement would imply that the Sandler project was contingent upon both brothers, perhaps Josh Safdie could work to evolve that project. Either way, between The Smashing Machine and his foray into acting, at least Benny Safdie will certainly keep busy after the split from his directorial partnership.
