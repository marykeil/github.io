Yes, Christian Bale&#39;s The Machinist diet is incredibly dangerous for the body and shouldn&#39;t be recreated or attempted. If Bale was eating only an apple, water, and coffee, that means the actor only consumed roughly 100 calories per day. The average recommended caloric intake for a day depends on age, sex, and health needs, but generally sits around 2,000 calories, meaning that Bale only ate about 5% of the standard. While Bale achieved this wild transformation under the supervision of a professional, the actor took his weight loss measures to the absolute extreme, and plenty of complications can result from rapid weight loss like the Christian Bale weight loss.


 

First, cutting out food groups can result in nutritional deficiencies. These can lead to side effects like hair loss, compromised immune systems, and weakened bones. Another thing that can happen is that one&#39;s metabolism will slow down rather than speed up, as the body recognizes extreme calorie restriction as a catalyst for starvation mode. Rapid weight loss can also result in loss of muscle, dehydration, headaches, and irritability. The best way to lose weight is slowly over time, with a healthy diet and plenty of movement.

Speaking to The Guardian in 2018, Bale revealed &#34;It’s an amazing experience doing that. When you’re so skinny that you can hardly walk up a flight of stairs … you’re, like, this being of pure thought. It’s like you’ve abandoned your body. That’s the most Zen-like state I’ve ever been in my life. Two hours sleep, reading a book for 10 hours straight without stopping … unbelievable. You couldn’t rile me up. No rollercoaster of emotions.&#34; However, he went on to add that this peacefulness quickly ended when he&#39;d inevitably have to eat.
