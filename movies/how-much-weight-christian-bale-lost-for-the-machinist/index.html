  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Christian Bale&rsquo;s extreme weight loss for his role in The Machinist shocked many and is still widely discussed almost two decades later.   Bale&rsquo;s diet consisted of only an apple, water, coffee, and the occasional whiskey, which equated to roughly 100 calories per day.   While Bale achieved his transformation under professional supervision, extreme weight loss can have serious health complications and should not be attempted.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Christian Bale often transforms his appearance for movies but his weight loss for The Machinist was truly startling; here&rsquo;s how much he shed.</p>
<p>Among the many roles in his career one of the most infamous for Christian Bale is The Machinist thanks to the extraordinary amount of weight he lost to play Trevor. Bale&rsquo;s breakout performance was American Psycho, which cemented him as a name to watch out for in Hollywood. Bale was so committed to the role of Patrick Bateman that when Leonardo DiCaprio briefly replaced him, he turned down other work, certain DiCaprio would drop out, and he&rsquo;d be asked back.</p>
<p>Christian Bale was being heavily touted as either the new James Bond or Batman during this era, but after a run of movies he felt personally dissatisfied with, he took some time out before returning with the 2004 thriller The Machinist — and images of Christian Bale in the movie almost defy belief. Bale played Trevor Reznik in The Machinist, a character who suffers from chronic insomnia. The Machinist was an excellent showcase for Christian Bale as a performer, but what shocked many was his physical transformation.</p>

<p>How Much Weight Christian Bale Lost And How He Did It
Christian Bale Lost 62 Pounds For The Machinist
Close</p>
<p>Trevor was supposed to be emaciated from his insomnia, but while director Brad Anderson intended to portray this with baggy clothes and make-up, Christian Bale&rsquo;s total commitment to the role saw him dieting for months before production. His diet was said to consist of an apple, water, and coffee daily, in addition to the odd whiskey. He also smoked a lot, resulting in the Christian Bale weight loss for The Machinist equaling 62 pounds — or four and a half stone — in weight.</p>
<p>Christian Bale was 120 pounds while shooting The Machinist, and the stark visual contrast to his regular body size borders on harrowing. The Machinist is a great movie in its own right, but it&rsquo;s undeniable the visual alarm caused by seeing Christian Bale skinny to such a degree is the reason it&rsquo;s still so widely discussed almost two decades since release.</p>
<p>Is Bale’s The Machinist Diet Dangerous?
Christian Bale Took Incredibly Risks To Film The Machinist</p>
<p>Yes, Christian Bale&rsquo;s The Machinist diet is incredibly dangerous for the body and shouldn&rsquo;t be recreated or attempted. If Bale was eating only an apple, water, and coffee, that means the actor only consumed roughly 100 calories per day. The average recommended caloric intake for a day depends on age, sex, and health needs, but generally sits around 2,000 calories, meaning that Bale only ate about 5% of the standard. While Bale achieved this wild transformation under the supervision of a professional, the actor took his weight loss measures to the absolute extreme, and plenty of complications can result from rapid weight loss like the Christian Bale weight loss.</p>
<p>First, cutting out food groups can result in nutritional deficiencies. These can lead to side effects like hair loss, compromised immune systems, and weakened bones. Another thing that can happen is that one&rsquo;s metabolism will slow down rather than speed up, as the body recognizes extreme calorie restriction as a catalyst for starvation mode. Rapid weight loss can also result in loss of muscle, dehydration, headaches, and irritability. The best way to lose weight is slowly over time, with a healthy diet and plenty of movement.</p>

<p>What Filming The Machinist Was Like For Christian Bale
The Machinist Pushed Christian Bale To His Physical And Mental Limits</p>
<p>In the years since the 2004 release of The Machinist, Christian Bale has grown candid about what it was like transforming his body for the movie, and his experiences filming it. Suffice to say it was an incredibly draining undertaking, but one that had unforeseen side effects. In particular, Bale noted that extreme fasting had an almost meditative effect on his emotional state.</p>
<p>Speaking to The Guardian in 2018, Bale revealed &ldquo;It’s an amazing experience doing that. When you’re so skinny that you can hardly walk up a flight of stairs … you’re, like, this being of pure thought. It’s like you’ve abandoned your body. That’s the most Zen-like state I’ve ever been in my life. Two hours sleep, reading a book for 10 hours straight without stopping … unbelievable. You couldn’t rile me up. No rollercoaster of emotions.&rdquo; However, he went on to add that this peacefulness quickly ended when he&rsquo;d inevitably have to eat.</p>
<p>The Machinist Was Among Christian Bale’s Most Impressive Transformations
Playing Trevor In The Machinist Showcases Bale&rsquo;s Talent</p>
<p>Christian Bale is no stranger to changing his body shape for roles, but The Machinist remains among his most drastic. Previously, he had to pack on muscle over the course of six months to prepare for Batman Begins, where he put on 100 pounds and then had to shed 20 on Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s instruction. For 2010&rsquo;s The Fighter, the actor portrayed Dicky Eklund, a boxer, and lost 30 pounds for the role.</p>
<p>The Christian Bale weight loss and gain formula has seen the actor shoot up and down in size throughout his career, depending on which characters he&rsquo;s portraying. He lost 55 pounds for POW drama Rescue Dawn and gained over 40 pounds to play Dick Cheney in Vice. Bale also gained 40 pounds to play Irving Rosenfeld in 2013&rsquo;s American Hustle, previously 185 pounds and moving up to 228 pounds. For the 2019 sports drama Ford v Ferrari, Bale played race car driver Ken Miles and lost 70 pounds, 30 more pounds than the 40 pounds he put on for Vice.</p>
<p>While the actor has had various dietary restrictions to lose and gain weight for previous films, he claims he just didn&rsquo;t eat in preparation for Ford v Ferrari to fit in the race cars. According to the actor, his days of dramatic transformations like The Machinist are likely over, due to the toll they take on his health.</p>
<p>Christian Bale In The Machinist Isn&rsquo;t Hollywood&rsquo;s Only Radical Weight Change
Close</p>
<p>The Christian Bale weight loss story for The Machinist is certainly drastic, but other actors have also put in the work to gain and lose a substantial amount of weight for their roles. For example, Natalie Portman played Nina, a ballerina, in Black Swan. She lost a whopping 20 pounds for the role, and reportedly trained for up to 8 hours a day, eating next to nothing — to the point she weighed only 98 pounds, meaning she lost over a 6th of her body weight.</p>
<p>Movie actor Jared Leto had two stunning transformations, he lost over 50 pounds for his part in Dallas Buyers Club and then gained another 70 for his movie Chapter 27. Rapper 50 Cent lost over 50 pounds to play a football player who has cancer in the film Things Fall Apart. Finally, Robert de Niro packed on 60 extra pounds to play Jake LaMotta in his older age for Raging Bull. While Christian Bale in The Machinist has probably the most visible transformation, other actors have gained and lost a lot of weight to play their most famous roles.</p>
