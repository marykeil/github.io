## Literature Review

Night Swim has compelling themes and an intriguing family dynamic, but its weakest element is that of its horror, which is severely lacking in bite.




Written and directed by Bryce McGuire, Night Swim takes an intriguing premise and turns it into something a bit more tame. There is much to be mined from using water as a source of terror, but Blumhouse’s latest is less of a horror and more of a family drama. There are layers to the story, which makes the film a gripping watch on its own, but you’ll be sorely disappointed in the lack of genuine and chilling scares if you’re a massive horror fan.




              Night Swim  Based on the 2014 short film Night Swim is a horror-thriller film that follows a woman being terrorized by a spirit in her swimming pool. Kerry Condon and Wyatt Russell star in the film, handled by Atomic Monster and Blumhouse Productions.    Release Date    January 5, 2024     Director    Bryce McGuire     Cast    Kerry Condon , Wyatt Russell , Nancy Lenehan , Amélie Hoeferle , Jodi Long , Gavin Warren     Genres    Horror , Thriller     Writers    Rod Blackhurst , Bryce McGuire     Studio(s)    Atomic Monster , Blumhouse Productions , Universal Pictures     Distributor(s)    Universal Pictures      

The idea of drowning or being pulled underwater unexpectedly can be terrifying in its own right. Night Swim banks on this idea, but what it does with it is quite middling. The film — which follows a family who moves into a house with a sinister pool after the patriarch, Ray Waller (Wyatt Russell) is diagnosed with MS and is forced to retire from baseball — works when it’s focused on the family’s dynamic, especially as it pertains to Ray’s inability to let go of his baseball life. McGuire’s film utilizes horror elements to expand upon the characters’ insecurity and uncertainty, but it’s quite unimaginative in its efforts.


 Night Swim Can Barely Be Called A Horror Movie 
         




Blumhouse has become a name synonymous with horror, but that doesn’t mean every film the studio releases is particularly scary or all that memorable. To that end, Night Swim fails the horror test. Its scares are few and far between, with its focus being on the family at the center of the story. That’s not a bad thing by any means, but it could have easily balanced both. The horror elements left me wanting more; when the jump scares did happen, they barely registered. There’s something eerie about being underwater, but while the lore surrounding the pool is fascinating, I found myself growing tired of watching people swim considering nothing much happened.

The framing of the underwater world also lacks imagination, but it’s elevated by some of Charlie Sarroff’s cinematography. And though certain shots had me waiting for something more sinister to happen, the scares stayed in the shallow end. Even the creature design is uninspired, and there’s a scene that instantly recalls IT, though it’s much more unconvincing as a moment of horror. Perhaps it’s because you can only do so much within the confines of the pool. And yet, there’s plenty of excellent tension throughout Night Swim. The buildup is great, and the final confrontation and push to save one character while fighting off another is unnerving and well-executed.






 Night Swim’s Family Drama Works Thanks To A Committed Cast &amp; Script 

 

Despite the weak horror, Night Swim has a solid enough script, one that is elevated by a cast that leans into their characters and story. There’s never a moment where the emotions and dialogue are overwrought or insincere. Wyatt Russell is especially excellent as Ray, balancing sincerity and kindness with menace. The rest of the family unit — Kerry Condon, Amélie Hoeferle, and Gavin Warren — is equally up to the task of delivering quality performances. The actors take their roles seriously and bring pathos to the story, bolstering an otherwise unchilling, timid film.

The family drama is actually quite good; there is nuance embedded into the narrative, and McGuire’s script isn’t lazy when approaching its themes and topics. There are films that would sidestep the story entirely to focus on the scary elements, but Night Swim’s characterizations are compelling. The film isn’t trying to hit us over the head with what it’s trying to say, but its themes have depth. When exploring career and glory vs. family, regret and the lengths one will go to return to a life that’s no longer tenable, McGuire gets in a few good swings. If only the horror lived up to these aspects of the film.



Night Swim releases in theaters on Friday, January 5. The film is 98 minutes long and rated PG-13 for terror, some violent content and language.
