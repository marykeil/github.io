# Ahsoka Character May Make Star Wars Movie Debut After Actor Celebrates Mandalorian &amp; Grogu News


## SUMMARY 



  Ahsoka actor Eman Esfandi reacted positively to the announcement of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, potentially hinting at Ezra Bridger&#39;s appearance.   It makes sense for Ezra Bridger to join the New Republic at Adelphi base, where he could meet Din Djarin and Grogu in the movie.   If Ezra Bridger teams up with Din Djarin and Grogu, it would create a great group dynamic and tie the events of the movie into the future of Star Wars.

## Literature Review

This Ahsoka actor&#39;s reaction to The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu announcement could signal that a key Star Wars character is set for the big screen.




One Ahsoka star just celebrated Din Djarin&#39;s and Din Grogu&#39;s new The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie announcement, and it may set up Ezra Bridger&#39;s big-screen debut. While plot details have yet to be released, the new The Mandalorian movie officially has a name: The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. This is a fitting, if a bit on-the-nose, moniker. One Ahsoka actor has taken to the Internet to share his reaction to this development.




                  New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!   

In a recent Instagram story, Eman Esfandi, Ahsoka&#39;s live-action Ezra Bridger actor, posted a picture of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie announcement along with a saluting emoji, an icon often used to show respect. This suggests that Esfandi is excited about the movie. However, it also potentially carries a more thrilling implication: Ezra Bridger may appear in the movie.

          

This would make perfect sense, as he reunited with his friends in the New Republic at the end of Ahsoka. Since The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie is slated to be the culmination of several shows, including The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, it seems only natural that Esfandi&#39;s Ezra Bridger would make an appearance. Esfandi also hasn&#39;t been shy on social media in displaying his love for Grogu, which could be another potential hint that his character will be crossing paths with the adorable Mandalorian apprentice very soon.





 Ezra Bridger Would Be A Natural Fit In The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu 
          

Din Djarin made a backdoor deal to work with the New Republic as a contracted bounty hunter. This means he will be working with Carson Teva, delivering captured members of the Imperial Remnant to him at the home of the Outer Rim&#39;s New Republic rangers, Adelphi base. Further, it is most likely that Din Djarin will deliver them directly to Teva at Adelphi base, where Ezra Bridger&#39;s friend Zeb Orrelios was shown to be training New Republic recruits.

Given Ezra Bridger&#39;s Jedi position, closeness with Zeb, and absence from Luke Skywalker&#39;s Jedi Order, it would make sense for him to join Zeb at Adelphi base. There, he would likely encounter Din Djarin and Din Grogu, which could very likely happen in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Ezra will be in the middle of finding a way to rescue Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren from their extragalactic exile, as well as warning the New Republic of Thrawn&#39;s return - which could very well cause this chanced meeting.




If Ezra Bridger, Din Djarin, and Din Grogu do team up in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, it will be a great grouping. As Ahsoka demonstrated, Ezra Bridger has grown into an excellent Jedi Knight. His focus on using the Force - even to the point of allowing Sabine Wren to keep his lightsaber - means he would be an excellent candidate to teach Grogu to fight using only the Force. Further, his positive attitude and experience working in a close-knit group would bring some levity to The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, and it would further tie the events of the movie into the future of Star Wars.
