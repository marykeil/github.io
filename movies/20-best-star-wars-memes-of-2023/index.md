 Every 2023 Star Wars TV Show, Ranked From Worst To Best 
Star Wars’ various TV shows released in 2023 offered a lot of great content, but how do they stack up against each other from worst to best?













 








 20  Two Is Just Too Many 
The First One Could Have Been A Fluke…


Anakin’s grief-fueled slaughter of the Tusken Raiders is quickly forgotten in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, but when Padme hears of his attack on the Jedi temple, she wastes no time rushing to confront him about it. This meme highlights the fact that she seemingly overlooked one atrocity, only to be shocked when it was repeated in an even worse scenario - Order 66.





 19  Hot Debates Aren’t Always As Cool As They Seem… 
Can’t Everyone Get Along?


Star Wars has been around for several decades and has a wide range of content, which means it’s full of hot topics for fans to debate about. These arguments can sometimes get a little more tense than they need to be. When this happens, it&#39;s easy to wish everybody would just get along.





 18  The Most Fearsome Beast 
Ahsoka’s Search For The Holy Grail


In an unexpected crossover, this meme implies that Baylan’s “creature with great power” is the bunny from Monty Python’s Search For The Holy Grail. Though it appears to be a normal, adorable bunny, it’s actually an incredibly ferocious beast that annihilates just about anything that approaches it. This really is the perfect combination.





 17  The Power Of Taylor Swift 
Thrawn Is A Swiftie, Too?


If there’s one thing 2023 made clear, it’s that Taylor Swift can make just about anything seem in style. Could she even make the Empire trendy if she were friends with a certain Grand Admiral Thrawn? Hopefully viewers will never find out...





 16  The Best Jedi? 
He Was Very Convincing!


Though he was only pretending to be a Jedi to fool people into trusting his services, Haja Estree was a funny and surprisingly meaningful addition to the Obi-Wan Kenobi series. Even Obi-Wan would have to admit the con man did a great job fooling the citizens of Daiyu, Hopefully he&#39;ll return in future stories set in the Dark Times.





 15  Christmas List Disappointment 
Maybe Santa Forgot To Double Check His List?


It can be frustrating to miss out on something from the top of a Christmas list. LEGO’s intricate AT-AT walker has been a popular choice for Christmas lists for years, and its status doesn’t seem to be slipping. The price might give Santa pause, though.





 14  Treason? 
Some Memes Require A Little Mental Work


To align with the other spaces, the last box should say “tree son.” It is instead a picture of Chancellor Palpatine in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith when the Jedi try to arrest him, referencing his quote, “It’s treason, then.” This is the smart wordplay you&#39;d expect from the best memes.





 13  Even Mandalorians Need To Cut Loose 
A Little Dance Break


This hilarious video captures a street performer dancing like no one is watching- all while wearing a Mandalorian helmet. It’s hard to imagine any of the stiff Mandalorian warriors from Star Wars getting their groove on, but it makes for a funny sight. It does raise an amusing question, though; do Mandalorians ever chill?





 12  The Bad Batch Keeps You On Your Toes 
At Least The Vibes Are Always Fresh


The plot of Star Wars: The Bad Batch can be incredibly heavy at times, but that doesn’t stop the show from flipping the atmosphere completely ever now and again. As this meme points out, there are many fun moments as well. It won&#39;t be long before Clone Force 99 return in Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, and there may not be many more of these relaxing moments after season 2&#39;s cliffhanger ending.





 11  Can You Even Tell The Difference? 
Credit To Cosplayers!


This meme originated from The Office, when Pam had to keep Michael busy by giving him two identical pictures and telling him to find differences between them. The insertion of a Din Djarin cosplay is a perfect compliment to the fans. It&#39;s a smart way of saying that the cosplay is so good it looks real.





 10  Dave Filloni Is Redefining Star Wars 
Not Everyone Is On Board With Everything


 Dave Filoni has been a respected Star Wars creator for a long time, but his recent projects have begun to tackle details added in the Star Wars sequel trilogy sequel series. The sequel trilogy is polarizing, but so is the idea of tampering with Star Wars canon. It&#39;s going to be fascinating to see how this plays out.





 9  The Most Important Text 
Every Update Is Crucial!


 This meme references the LEGO Star Wars Visual Dictionary, which was first published in 2009. The book contains in-depth information about each LEGO Star Wars piece; it&#39;s updated periodically to include new additions. Collectors consider it a treasured resource.





 8  A Good Trope Is Hard To Ignore 
Can You Be Enemies If The Situation Is One-Sided?


Though these “spoilers” are actually theories, the first meme holds some truth already. The idea that Syril could become another Darth Maul situation, as referenced in the meme, would be interesting as well as funny, considering his arch-nemesis is unaware of his existence completely. Andor season 2 has been delayed, so viewers will have to wait to find out if this meme becomes prophecy.





 7  Barbie’s had More Careers Than You Think! 
Everyone Is A Clone Trooper These Days


Barbie has held many jobs over the years, something that is often referenced in the Netflix series Barbie Life In The Dreamhouse. This meme takes it a step further, adding clone trooper armor to her already-overflowing closet. How would share fare in the Clone Wars?





 6  Impractical Sith Lords 
A Humorous Look At Anakin’s First Misstep


In a lighthearted view of Anakin’s first steps into the dark side, this meme highlights Palpatine’s manipulations by inserting shots from Impractical Jokesters. The show sends one member of the team out to complete tasks while the rest stay back and give instructions. This is so very similar to Sidious’ ability to pull strings from the shadows.





 5  The Crossover No One Expected 
And The Meme Itself Adds Another Reference!


 The meme of Captain America understanding a modern reference is used to point out connections between media. This meme refers to the title of Ahsoka episode 8 - The Jedi, The Witch, and the Warlord - which is a direct play on C.S. Lewis&#39; classic book. Lucasfilm&#39;s Dave Filoni really is a fantasy fan.





 4  The Temptations Of Spoilers 
Self-Control Is Key!


 When shows are released week-by-week, it can be fun to spread the excitement out as opposed to binge-watching all at once. The danger, however, is that falling behind on any show can open the door to spoilers on social media. Be careful out there...





 3  Responsible Spoilers 
If It Has To Be Done, Don’t Make it Obvious!


The trend of “spoilers without context” originated when Star Wars: The Last Jedi hit theaters. The concept is to describe significant plot points using references that won’t make sense unless you’ve seen the content already. Only Ahsoka fans (and those who have seen real spoilers!) will understand this one.





 2  A Mandalorian’s Work Is Never Done 
Non-Stop Quests!


 Taking inspiration from Shrek, this meme points out that poor Din Djarin seems to be on a never-ending streak of side quests. He&#39;s currently taking a break on Nevarro (though not in a swamp). This will probably be his last break for a while...





 1  It’s A Mis-Remembered Scene! 
Admiral Ackbar Has Been Stealing Leia’s Thunder


This meme points out a shocking fact: Admiral Akbar’s iconic line, “It’s a trap” might be one of the most well-known Star Wars quotes, giving birth to many memes paired with Akbar’s picture, but he wasn’t actually the first character to say it. Like the often-misquoted “No, I am your father,” some things just stick in pop culture, even if they aren’t completely accurate.
