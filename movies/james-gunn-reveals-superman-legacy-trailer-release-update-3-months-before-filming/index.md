## Literature Review

With Superman: Legacy set to start filming in a few months, James Gunn shares a new update about the first trailer for the new DC Universe reboot.




As Superman: Legacy is getting ready to start principal photography this year, DC Universe boss James Gunn shares an update about the first trailer for the movie. Following the official end of the DCEU, Gunn&#39;s DC Universe is finally getting closer to starting, with Superman: Legacy being the first movie in Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34; David Corenswet will be the next actor to bring Superman to life in theaters, as Superman: Legacy will focus on the Man of Steel during his early days in his superhero career.




While there are supposedly more additions coming to the Superman: Legacy cast, Gunn was recently asked on Threads if a trailer will be coming out in 2024. The user biegajskijon asked &#34;when your finished with writing Superman: Legacy will we get a trailer for Superman: Legacy this year.&#34;

          

The Superman: Legacy update fleshes out the timeline for production further for audiences, but also makes it clear that some of the most major updates are currently a long way off, as in response to this question, Gunn said, &#34;No. We donâ€™t begin filming until March. Writing is basically done and has been for a while, other than a comma here, a comma there.&#34; Prior to this, popular speculation was that a Superman: Legacy movie trailer would be presented at San Diego Comic-Con this summer.




                  Superman: Legacy: Release Date, Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Superman: Legacy is the first entry in James Gunn&#39;s much anticipated new DCU, and here is everything we know from cast to story and release date.   


 Is Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy Update Setting A New Standard For DC Universe Marketing? 
         

Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy update may be a sign that DC Studios is looking to change its approach to marketing its upcoming DC Universe movies and TV shows. Something that has been a massive topic lately with trailers, especially for films, is that various studios are tending to show a bit too much in promotional materials, thus giving away some exciting reveals beforehand. In the superhero movie genre, this has been a major issue, and it wouldn&#39;t be shocking if DC Studios wanted to break out of that trend, especially as 2023 was a struggling year for comic book films.




Having the first Superman: Legacy trailer - whether it&#39;s a teaser or full sizzle reel - be released in 2025 would give DC Studios also more time to properly work on post-production, and avoid the common criticisms of unfinished effects. It could also be that the studio may want to do one full Superman: Legacy trailer, and then start dropping clips and other glimpses closer to the movie&#39;s release, rather than two or three trailers that have been the norm for years. However, it is also possible that this is simply the approach for Superman: Legacy and not necessarily the new status quo for future DC Studios productions.



As of right now, Superman: Legacy is the only confirmed DC Universe movie that will be filming in 2024.




Ever since DC Studios launched, Gunn has made it clear that they want to shake things up in various aspects, and the marketing element may be one of those factors. That is why it has been very helpful to have Gunn engage with the audience on social media, giving them a direct answer to different questions about the new DC Universe. But for now, time will tell what kind of glimpses the world will get from Superman: Legacy as they get closer to finally starting filming.
