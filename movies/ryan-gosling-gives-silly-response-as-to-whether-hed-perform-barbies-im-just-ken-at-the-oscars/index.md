## Literature Review

Ryan Gosling offers a funny response as to whether he would step in to perform Barbie&#39;s &#34;I&#39;m Just Ken&#34; at the Oscars should it get nominated.




Ryan Gosling offers a sly answer in response to whether he would perform Barbie’s “I’m Just Ken” at the Oscars. This year’s Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 10, 2024. The nominations will be announced on Tuesday, January 23, revealing who will be contenders in every category from Best Picture to Best Original Song, the category for which “I’m Just Ken” may be in contention.




Speaking with W Magazine, Gosling responds to whether or not he would perform “I’m Just Ken” if invited to do so at the Oscars. When asked if he was planning to perform it, Gosling noted that he hadn’t “been invited.” He then joked “Do you get paid to sing at the Oscars? Do you have to drive yourself?” Check out the full quote from Gosling below:


Well, I haven’t been invited. And I wasn’t thinking about it until now, and now it’s all I’m going to think about. Do you get paid to sing at the Oscars? Do you have to drive yourself? What kind of scratch is involved? They pick you up at least, right?
I don&#39;t have [a go to karaoke song]. I only sing at the Oscars.… Oh no, wait, I don&#39;t.



 Why I’m Just Ken Would Be The Perfect Oscars Moment With Gosling 
         




This interview question is technically premature, as the Oscar nominations will not be released until later this month. With a Golden Globe nomination under its belt, a place on the Oscar shortlist, and a global following since the release of Barbie, “I’m Just Ken” seems like a lock for a nomination in the category. Though it may compete against other Barbie songs, as it is in the Golden Globes.

                  Barbie&#39;s Best Picture Hopes Are Weaker Than You Might Think For 1 Unexpected Reason   Barbie is a likely contender for Best Picture at the 2024 Oscars, but the film sports a label which has historically performed poorly at the Awards.   

Every year, the five nominees for Best Original Song are featured in live performances at the ceremony, meaning that the Oscars would almost surely invite Gosling to perform “I’m Just Ken.” Gosling has performed a number of versions of “I’m Just Ken” outside of Barbie itself, including live versions and a Christmas edition of the song. If the actor were to return to the Oscars with his signature Ken gusto for the song, it would undoubtedly be one of the best moments of a long Oscar night.




As coy as he may be about it, Gosling’s joke of “I only sing at the Oscars” suggests that he would indeed show up to perform the song. Not only would this be a great moment in the awards show, but it would be in the Academy’s best interest as the anticipation for this performance would likely boost ratings. The 2023 Oscars fared fairly well last year, making the top 50 viewed live broadcasts, so the network will be hopeful to achieve the same feat again. If Gosling and Barbie’s “I’m Just Ken” have anything to do with it, the awards show may very well meet this goal.
