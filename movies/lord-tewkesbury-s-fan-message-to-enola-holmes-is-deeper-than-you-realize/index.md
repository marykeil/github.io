# Lord Tewkesbury s Fan Message To Enola Holmes Is Deeper Than You Realize


## SUMMARY 


 

The fan language depicted in Enola Holmes 2 is not accurate to the real-life secret language of fans used in 19th-century English society.


Enola and Tewkesbury both misunderstand the fan gestures and send the wrong messages to each other.


The fan language was primarily used as a marketing tactic by fan makers and was not a practical way of communication.
