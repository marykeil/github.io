# Gladiator Might Not Have Happened Without Steven Spielberg s 3 Story Conditions


## SUMMARY 



Steven Spielberg&#39;s three critical questions determined the success of Gladiator: whether it was about ancient Roman gladiators, took place in the Coliseum, and involved brutal sword-fighting to the death.

Spielberg&#39;s cautious approach and conditions helped prevent Gladiator from being misguided and contributed to its success as one of the most celebrated action movies of the 21st century.

Without Spielberg&#39;s involvement and initial conditions, Gladiator might not have been made into the beloved movie it is today, highlighting the importance of his contribution to the project.

## Literature Review
Ridley Scott&#39;s epic Gladiator was initially pitched to Steven Spielberg, who gave original screenwriter David Franzoni three crucial conditions.



Ridley Scott&#39;s [***Gladiator\***](https://screenrant.com/tag/gladiator/) as we know it might not have come to fruition without Steven Spielberg&#39;s three initial story conditions. *Gladiator* remains one of the most celebrated action movies of the 21st century despite being released at the turn of the century in 2000. The story behind how *Gladiator* became a massive success began with the original story by screenwriter David Franzoni, who also wrote the screenplay for Steven Spielberg&#39;s historical epic drama *Amistad* (1997).

While working with Spielberg on *Amistad*, which was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1998, Franzoni approached the director about his story idea that would eventually become *Gladiator*. Franzoni started developing the project during the 1970s after reading the book *Those Who Are About To Die* by Daniel P. Mannix, which was published in 1958. When he asked Spielberg about his interest in the project, the acclaimed director asked Franzoni three critical questions that would determine the success of the *Gladiator* project forever.



## Steven Spielberg Needed To Hear 3 Story Details When Gladiator Was Pitched



**Spielberg asked Franzoni three key questions during his \*Gladiator\* pitch**, according to the Writers Guild of America. Franzoni recalls in his conversation with Spielberg, *&#34;My gladiator movie, it was about ancient Roman gladiatorsâ€”not American, Japanese, whatever else? Yes, I said. Taking place in the ancient Coliseum? Yes. Fighting with swords and animals to the death and such?&#34;* to which Spielberg responded, *&#34;Yes. Great, let&#39;s make the movie.&#34;*

Spielberg was then able to get the project greenlit with director Ridley Scott attached. Initially, Franzioni had written and submitted a draft to Scott, but the director was not a fan of Franzoni&#39;s style of dialogue. Scott hired John Logan, screenwriter of *Any Given Sunday* (1998), to rewrite the dialogue in the screenplay and the rest is history. Without Spielberg&#39;s three initial conditions that it was about the Romans, took place in the Coliseum, and involved brutal sword-fighting to the death, *Gladiator* might have never been made.

## How Steven Spielberg Helped Pave A Way For Gladiator&#39;s Success

Without Spielberg&#39;s cautious approach to Franzoni&#39;s pitch, *Gladiator* could have been misguided from the start and might not have ever gotten the momentum to be made into the beloved movie it still is today. **Franzoni deserves credit for doing the proper research in drafting a solid and accurate skeleton for Spielberg, Scott, and Logan to work with**, which is why he&#39;s still credited as one of the three writers on the film. While a Spielberg-directed ***Gladiator\*** would have been fascinating in its own right, his early skepticism and three initial conditions paved the way for Scott to make it into an outstanding movie.
