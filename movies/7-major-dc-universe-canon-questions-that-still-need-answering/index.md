## Literature Review

The DC Universe reboot is imminent, yet there are still 7 major questions that need to be answered regarding the DC Extended Universe.





Following the merger of Warner Bros and Discovery, James Gunn and Peter Safran were appointed as the co-CEOs of DC Studios. Gunn and Safran soon canceled the DCEU’s planned future installments and began working on a rebooted DCU. As explained in the reveal of the DCU slate, Gunn considers the DCU only a partial reboot of the old DCEU, using Barry Allen’s timeline alterations in The Flash to explain why some things are significantly different now while others are unaltered. Despite this succinct explanation, there are still 7 major questions regarding the future DCU and its relation to the old DCEU that need to be answered sooner rather than later.









 








 7  How Is Blue Beetle The First DCU Character But Not The First DCU Movie? 
        

The upcoming Blue Beetle will star Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes. Considering that Blue Beetle will be released after The Flash, it is understandable to assume that it might be part of the new DCU, or that Maridueña will not return as Reyes if the film is not part of the rebooted franchise. James Gunn raised more questions by stating that Blue Beetle is not part of the new DCU, but Xolo Maridueña will return to play Jaime Reyes. What this might mean is that Blue Beetle is not considered canon to the DCU, but an essentially-identical version of Xolo Maridueña as Jaime Reyes will be part of the DCU.

 6  Which Version Of Justice League Is Canon? 
        

2017’s Justice League and 2021’s Zack Snyder’s Justice League have caused debate among viewers as to which film is canonical. While both iterations will presumably not be canonical to the new DCU, there is conflicting evidence supporting either being canon to the DCEU. Superman wears his blue costume in all subsequent appearances, implying that the theatrical version is the “true” iteration, yet this is also the case in The Flash, which directly references events exclusively from the director’s cut and makes them vital to its narrative. The director’s cut appears to be the canon version (with Superman still returning to his blue costume), yet an official confirmation may be necessary.





 5  Is Aquaman Part Of the DC Universe? 
        

Like Blue Beetle, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will release after The Flash yet before Creature Commandos, making its place in canon unclear. Moreover, Jason Momoa was rumored to be playing Lobo in the DCU instead of Aquaman, though this has seemingly been debunked by Momoa himself, who implied that he may stay as Aquaman in the DCU. James Gunn has stated that Aquaman 2 will lead directly into the DCU, but what this means remains to be seen. Aquaman 2 might end with reality being altered, showing the transition from the DCEU to the DCU and confirming whether Momoa will remain Aquaman or switch to Lobo.





 4  How Does The Flash&#39;s Ending Connect To The DCU? 
        

Over the course of The Flash’s narrative, Barry Allen starts in the DCEU proper, inadvertently creates a hybrid of the DCEU and the Tim Burton Batman universe, and then ends the film in what appears to be a hybrid of the DCEU and the Joel Schumacher Batman universe (which is itself a branching timeline from the Burton continuity). James Gunn has confirmed that George Clooney will not be the Batman of the DCU, so it is unclear if Barry Allen is now in the DCU or locking into another reality. Since Ezra Miller might play Barry Allen in the DCU, an official confirmation regarding The Flash’s ending is needed.





 3  Are Returning DCEU Characters Variants In The DCU? 
        

A number of actors from the old DCEU will reprise their respective roles in the DCU. Viola Davis will star as Amanda Waller in the upcoming TV series Waller, and James Gunn will make a Peacemaker season 2, where the ensemble cast will presumably return as well. Despite this, Gunn has confirmed that his DCEU properties (The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker season 1) are not part of the DCU canon, so it appears that Davis’s Waller is a new version of the character who does not necessarily share the same past as her DCEU counterpart, yet this too will need to be clarified by Gunn.





 2  Will Gal Gadot Continue Playing Wonder Woman In The DCU? 
        

One of the most unfortunate casualties of the DCEU’s imminent reboot was a third Wonder Woman movie starring Gal Gadot and directed by Patty Jenkins. The film’s cancelation made it seem certain that Gal Gadot’s time as Wonder Woman was over, yet she never announced her departure from the role like Henry Cavill and Dwayne Johnson did for Superman and Black Adam, respectively. Moreover, James Gunn himself has clarified that Gadot has not been “booted” and that Gadot is interested in continuing to play Wonder Woman, though they are still working on the logistics of her potential return.
Gal Gadot herself, while grateful for new opportunities following Wonder Woman 3’s cancelation, has also hinted that she will come back to play Wonder Woman, though an official announcement has yet to be made. Keeping Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman in the DCU makes more sense than recasting her, since other DCEU stars will reprise their respective roles in the DCU, and Gadot’s iteration of Diana is one of the DCEU’s most beloved elements. The possible announcement of Gal Gadot’s return in the DCU remains to be made, though perhaps she may have a cameo as Wonder Woman in the upcoming Paradise Lost.

 1  Will The DCEU To DCU Transition Actually Be Explained? 
        

The Flash was potentially the best way to explain the transition from the DCEU to the DCU, yet the film, ultimately, does not do this. The Flash was written and filmed well before Gunn and Safran’s DC reboot was ideated, so this is understandable, yet viewers may be wondering if the transition from one continuity to the other will be addressed on screen. The Flash is vague enough for viewers to perhaps assume that some characters from the DCEU will make it to the DC Universe while others are completely different, yet its exact effects on future DC movies should, ideally, be explored.
