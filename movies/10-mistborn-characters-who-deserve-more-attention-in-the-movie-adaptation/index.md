## Literature Review
Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Mistborn series has a movie adaptation in early development, and these characters deserve more time than they had in the novels.

Summary
 Key takeaways: 
 The Mistborn film adaptation has faced delays due to strikes and concerns about the success of previous fantasy films. 
 Straff Venture is a truly evil antagonist in the Mistborn series, invoking visceral satisfaction in his downfall. 
 Characters such as Dockson and Allrianne are essential to the heist aspect and female representation in the film, respectively. 




Brandon Sanderson&#39;s Mistborn is one of the most beloved fantasy book series of the 21st century, and it&#39;s filled with fantastic characters that deserve more attention in a film adaptation. The original Mistborn trilogy uses POV chapters, with Vin, Elend, Kelsier, and Sazed getting the most attention. But the series is cherished for its ensemble of personalities that make each book feel collaborative and inviting. Sanderson has frequently compared the first Mistborn novel to films like Oceans&#39;s Eleven, and if the movie adaptation takes on a similar format, the ensemble is where it will come together.
As for the progress of the Mistborn film, in an August 2022 livestream, Sanderson said, &#34;I would be surprised if we are not on set doing things this time next year.&#34; However, this progress was affected by the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. In a Reddit comment, Sanderson assured fans that the strikes slowed them down but that he was sure it would still happen. He mentioned Hollywood being skittish about taking on a potentially high-budget fantasy project after Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves flopped commercially. While Mistborn may be a risk, the upside of taking on the project is Sanderson&#39;s shared Cosmere universe.



 10  Straff Venture 
Straff is one of Sanderon&#39;s most evil antagonists.
        

As the main antagonist of The Well of Ascension, Staff Venture is one of the most clearly evil characters in Sanderson&#39;s world. While Sanderson has written morally gray villains, Straff Venture is purely vile and sadistic, with zero redeeming qualities. He&#39;s a product of Luthadel&#39;s toxic noble culture but far exceeds other nobles, like Ashweather Cett, in his cruelty. It could benefit the films to emphasize how despicable he is to invoke a more visceral satisfaction to his downfall, akin to Ramsay in Game of Thrones or Dolores Umbridge in Harry Potter.

A Mistborn movie must include the relationship between Vin and Kelsier, but it shouldn’t overcomplicate it or make things weirder than they are.






 9  Tindwyl 
Tindwyl&#39;s backstory demonstrates the darker aspects of Sanderson&#39;s world.
        

In The Well of Ascension, Tindwyl is a Keeper of Terris who arrives in Luthadel to train Elend in leadership. She&#39;s vital to Elend and Vin&#39;s growth, but more importantly to Sazed&#39;s, after the two fall in love. Tindwyl is initially an abrasive character who shows little patience or sympathy to those around her, but she becomes essential in helping Sazed discover the secrets of the Well of Ascension. Tindwyl&#39;s backstory as a Terris mother would make her a highly sympathetic character despite her rudeness, adding an element of dystopian intrigue to the world.

 Mistborn&#39;s Ending Presents 1 Major Obstacle For A Movie Adaptation 
Though excitement is high for the Mistborn book series to be adapted to film, the first book’s ending could be a big problem for the movie adaptation.






 8  Dockson 
Dockson is essential to the heist aspect of The Final Empire.
        

Notable as the only non-Allomancer in the crew, Dockson is Kelsier&#39;s right-hand man, and he&#39;d be an essential character for the first film to nail. While Kelsier and Vin&#39;s relationship is the centerpiece of The Final Empire, the dynamic between Kelsier and his crew members is vital to establishing the heist aspect of the narrative. Dockson also presents an interesting dynamic in The Well of Ascension, as he disapproves of Elend&#39;s rule.


 7  Allrianne 
Allrianne provides commentary on the role of women in Luthadel&#39;s noble system.
        

Developing Allrianne more in a film could fix one of Mistborn&#39;s biggest problems. One of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s regrets about the original Mistborn series is not including enough female characters. Despite Vin being a fantastic female protagonist, there are barely any other women in the novels. Allrianne Cett is considered, by Luthadel&#39;s cultural norms, to be a conventionally feminine young woman, and it&#39;s revealed in Mistborn: Era 2 that she later became a voice for workplace equality, adding a depth to her character that only occasionally shines through in the original trilogy.


 6  Hammond 
Hammond is essential to the crew&#39;s dynamic.
        

Hammond is a character that may see a significant change in the Mistborn film, as Sanderson mentioned he wished he&#39;d made him a female character to begin with. As the Pewterarm of the group, Hammond lends firepower and military strength to the crew. He&#39;s one of the most entertaining characters in the series, offering banter and philosophical discussion to the team. Following The Final Empire, many of the crew members get sidelined to make room for new characters, but keeping their dynamic as consistent as possible is essential to the trilogy.

 5  TenSoon 
Kandra are one of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s most unique species. The kandra are a species unique to Brandon Sanderson&#39;s world, with one of the most fascinating cultures on Scadrial. TenSoon is the primary kandra character in the original Mistborn trilogy who becomes an ally to Vin. Aside from Sanderson&#39;s magic systems, his creatures and cultures make his worlds so distinct and exciting. In fantasy films, characters like Gollum or Dobby stand out in their respective franchises, offering a unique, other-worldly appeal. TenSoon&#39;s complex human characteristics, mixed with his distinctive species, could make him a memorable piece of the film series. Plus, a hero with a wolfhound sidekick is hard to top.


 4  Marsh 
Marsh is one of Mistborn&#39;s most complex and alluring characters.
        

Another complex character in the Mistborn series is Kelsier&#39;s brother, Marsh. After being presumed dead, going undercover for the rebellion, Marsh is discovered to have become a Steel Inquisitor, turning him into an unwilling villain. By The Hero of Ages, he&#39;s an agent of Ruin with barely any autonomy, making his arc in the series so captivating. His intentions could become an exciting mystery in a Mistborn film, as viewers wouldn&#39;t have the inner monologue to know he&#39;s planning on helping Vin.


 3  Breeze 
Breeze ties the two Mistborn eras together. Part of what makes the Cosmere so unique as a fictional universe is that any novel series or standalone can be enjoyed independently. However, given the popularity of shared universes in Hollywood, emphasis may be placed on characters who tie into other series. Breeze is a fantastic character in his own right, but the fact that Mistborn: Era 2&#39;s main character is his descendant heightens his importance in the grander universe.

 2  Hoid 
Hoid is essential to connecting Cosmere stories.


Close







One of the earliest connecting threads between Mistborn and The Stormlight Archive is Hoid, a character who appears on both planets. Like with Breeze, emphasizing Hoid in a Mistborn series could be vital to establishing Sanderon&#39;s shared universe. He doesn&#39;t need a Nick Fury-esque post-credit scene, but increasing his element of mysticism in preparation for his later appearances could make him more effective. Hoid is essential to the overarching plot of the Cosmere.


 1  The Lord Ruler 
The Lord Ruler is one of the Cosmere&#39;s most intriguing villains.
        

One of the most alluring and enigmatic characters in The Final Empire, the Lord Ruler only briefly appears at the end of the story. Most of the novel&#39;s mystery and intrigue are centered around his secretive past, and providing too much characterization to him may take away from that aspect. However, the Lord Ruler has the potential to be a highly memorable and complex cinematic villain, and it would be a shame to underutilize him in a Mistborn movie.
