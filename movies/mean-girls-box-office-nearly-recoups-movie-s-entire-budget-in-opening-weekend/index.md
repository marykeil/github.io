## Literature Review

The Mean Girls musical nearly makes back its entire budget during its first weekend at the domestic box office, in which it has debuted at No. 1.




Mean Girls has already grossed most of its budget back. The new movie musical is an adaption of the 2018 Broadway musical of the same name, which was a stage update of the 2004 non-musical teen comedy movie Mean Girls, which itself was inspired by the 2002 parenting book Queen Bees and Wannabes by Rosalind Wiseman. With a screenplay by Tina Fey, who has been involved in every iteration since 2004, the movie stars Angourie Rice as Cady Heron, a high school transfer student who becomes involved in a plot to bring down Queen Bee Regina George (ReneÃ© Rapp).




Per Variety, the Mean Girls release is projected to gross a 4-day holiday weekend opening of $32 million at the domestic box office. In addition to being considerably higher than the $24.4 million opening gross of the original movie, it has already earned most of its budget back. While it wasn&#39;t expensive on the scale of a modern blockbuster, the new movie cost an estimated $36 million.


 Mean Girls Is Already A Success 
          

Although the Mean Girls musical is approaching the total of its budget, it still has a way to go before it hits the break-even point. The rule of thumb is that a movie needs to earn back at least twice its production budget in order to end up in the black, meaning that its break-even point is likely somewhere north of $72 million. However, the movie is already a hit by many metrics, and has a clear path to grow into an even bigger one.




                  6 Reasons Why Mean Girls 2024&#39;s Reviews Are So Positive   In an age of failed reboots and underwhelming sequels, there are a few key reasons why Mean Girls 2024&#39;s reviews are so positive (and so fetch).   

For instance, Mean Girls was originally intended to be a Paramount&#43; streaming exclusive before it pivoted to a theatrical release. This means that its already large theatrical gross is just one factor that will determine the movie&#39;s profitability, which will also be measured by its ability to draw subscribers to the streamer. This was the same path taken by the 2022 smash hit Smile, which became the highest-grossing horror movie of that year.



Smile&#39;s domestic opening was $22.6 million and it grossed a worldwide total of $217.4 million, meaning that Mean Girls could potentially climb that high if it has equally good word of mouth.




Given Smile&#39;s success and Mean Girls&#39; even higher opening weekend, the musical will most likely have no problem hitting the break-even point before it leaves theaters. There are also very few wide releases coming through the end of January, with the only major upcoming movies being I.S.S. and Miller&#39;s Girl. This gives the musical less competition to contend with during its all-important first three weeks.
