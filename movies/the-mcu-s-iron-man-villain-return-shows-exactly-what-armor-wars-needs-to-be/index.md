## Literature Review

One Iron Man villain&#39;s return in What If...? shows exactly how he needs to be handled in the upcoming Armor Wars featuring Tony Stark&#39;s legacy.




The MCU recently brought back a villain from the Iron Man movies, and in doing so demonstrated exactly what needs to happen in Armor Wars. Armor Wars is an upcoming MCU movie that will focus on Tony Stark&#39;s legacy through the perspective of his best friend Rhodey, who will also need to come to terms with Stark&#39;s death. Riri Williams, meanwhile, will likely step in to fill Tony Stark&#39;s shoes with her take on his iconic armor and tech. The comic book run of the same name focused on Tony Stark dealing with those who misappropriate his tech for unscrupulous means, a common theme throughout Iron Man&#39;s MCU timeline.




In Stark&#39;s absence, however, it remains to be seen how the MCU will change the Armor Wars story. As it is set to focus on Tony Stark&#39;s memory, there is no doubt that Rhodey will take center stage in his attempts to ensure that his best friend&#39;s tech is not stolen as prolifically as it has been in the past. In doing so, Rhodey and the audience will no doubt be consistently reminded of Stark and his technological legacy, but What If...? already foreshadowed how it should handle its main villain.

                  Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best   Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?   


 What If Season 2&#39;s Justin Hammer Teases What Armor Wars Needs To Be 
          

Iron Man 2 debuted Tony Stark&#39;s longstanding business rival and weapons industrialist, Justin Hammer, who was impeccably portrayed by Sam Rockwell. While his character was a highlight of the movie, Hammer was played for laughs as a hapless hack incapable of producing functional equipment before his misguided and dangerous attempts to commandeer Stark&#39;s tech landed him in Seagate Penitentiary. In What If...? season 2, episode 3, however, he reemerges as a changed man after spending his time in Seagate honing skills to one-up his arch-rival.




While Justin Hammer in What If...? maintains his humorous persona, he is able to hack into Stark&#39;s remote security suits of armor swiftly and even go toe-to-toe with the Hulk blood-empowered Happy Hogan. Since Armor Wars will likely focus on Tony Stark&#39;s tech being misappropriated in similar ways, this could be some significant foreshadowing for what&#39;s to come given that Stark will be absent as he was in the What If...? episode. What&#39;s more, it should be Justin Hammer, specifically, who returns as Armor Wars&#39; main villain.



 Why Justin Hammer Is The Perfect Villain For Armor Wars 
          

Justin Hammer was a much larger threat to Tony Stark in the comics than he was in Iron Man 2. For example, in the comics Hammer was able to hack into Stark&#39;s armor while he wore it - something that Whiplash achieved with War Machine in Iron Man 2. A more clued-up Hammer in What If...?, meanwhile, was able to do just that - setting up the main timeline&#39;s Hammer to be capable of such feats. Not only is Justin Hammer overdue the more nefarious depiction he deserves, but his being rooted in Tony Stark&#39;s past is precisely why he should reappear as the Armor Wars main villain.




As Rhodey navigates the legacy that Stark left behind, Hammer is the perfect villain to help represent Tony&#39;s past without resorting to flashbacks. By starring two of the main characters in Iron Man&#39;s MCU history, Armor Wars will tribute Iron Man while telling a new story, hopefully with a more threatening Hammer finally capable of taking control of Stark&#39;s tech. Riri Williams&#39; role in Armor Wars, meanwhile, would be to take up the mantle as she continues to innovate rather than misappropriate.
