## Literature Review

The Bricklayer star Aaron Eckhart discusses performing his own stunts, what attracted him to the role, and The Dark Knight trilogy being grounded.




In The Bricklayer, an ex-CIA agent, Steve Vail, is brought out of retirement to stop a rogue insurgent. The insurgent is assassinating foreign journalists and framing the CIA as the killers in an attempt to turn governments around the world against the U.S. As this blackmail plan seems to be working, the agency will rely on Vail to stop the insurgent by any means necessary.




The Bricklayer is directed by Renny Harlin. The screenplay was penned by Hanna Weg and Matt Johnson based on the 2010 novel of the same name written by Paul Lindsay under his pen name Noah Boyd. The Bricklayer stars Aaron Eckhart, Nina Dobrev, Tim Blake Nelson, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Clifton Collins Jr.

                  Night Has Fallen Must Bring Back Aaron Eckhart&#39;s Asher   Night Has Fallen will be the fourth entry in the action franchise, and after skipping the third entry Aaron Eckhart&#39;s Asner needs to make a return.   

Screen Rant interviewed The Bricklayer star Aaron Eckhart about his new action movie. Eckhart discussed working with Dobrev, what drew him to the role, and performing his own stunts. Eckhart also explained what he thinks superhero movies can learn from the The Dark Knight trilogy.


 Aaron Eckhart Talks The Bricklayer 
         




Screen Rant: The Bricklayer is a fantastic way to kick off 2024. It&#39;s action packed with so many different twists and turns, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat and genuinely guessing the whole time. To me, it feels like Mission Impossible meets True Lies. I absolutely love the chemistry between you and Nina. It really shines through. I feel like those were the best parts of the film when you guys were on screen together. She even mentioned that you helped her out with even simple things like pointing the gun at somebody&#39;s direction that&#39;s on their team and that you&#39;re not supposed to do that. Can you talk to me about working with Nina on The Bricklayer?


Aaron Eckhart: Yeah, I mean, it was great. She&#39;s obviously very talented. And she&#39;s very, very sweet and nice and prepared and ready to go. And she likes the action. She&#39;s into it. She likes to get down and get dirty and she has great suggestions. So all that chemistry comes from just two people on the same wavelength, trying to do the same thing, and make a great movie.





I love your portrayal of Steve Vail. I think that it&#39;s crazy, sometimes I forgot I was watching Aaron Eckhart because you just immersed yourself in this role, even to the point where Nina was saying that when you guys first met you had the whole script memorized. What attracted you to the role of Steve Vail and The Bricklayer?


Aaron Eckhart: Well, I love the romanticism of the character. I grew up in the Cold War era and I love spy movies. I read spy novels. I love the idea of clandestine missions in foreign lands. Also the idea that a man who has had a past and has removed himself from that past and gone a different direction, a direction that he finds peace and solace in and creativity, that he&#39;s brought back in.
And also how one can use one&#39;s tools to defend oneself if need be. I like the idea of a man who is able to take care of himself on many different levels and sort of the reluctant tradesman that you&#39;ve pushed too far. Also, I like the fact that he has a sense of justice about him and that he&#39;s a realist. He knows maybe that the side that he&#39;s been playing on might have their hands dirty as well





Right. Now, The Bricklayer is directed by Renny Harlin who praised you and Nina for committing and doing your own stunts. Did his action experience help you get through any particular intense scenes? Because let me tell you, that rooftop scene where you guys land on that lift, I love that scene. And also the car chase in Greece. Man, you had me on the edge of my seat.


Aaron Eckhart: Well, I went there a couple of weeks early to fight, train, choreograph, and get ready for those fights because I did everything myself. And then Renny said, &#34;Yeah, there&#39;s going to be this great fight in an elevator and the elevator&#39;s going to go down and you&#39;re going to fight. Oh, yeah, and it&#39;s all done in the rain.&#34; And it was freezing outside. But yeah, Renny knows action.
He knows lenses, he knows cameras, he knows angles, and he knows action and just ask him. And he is a pro at that. I mean, he&#39;s made Die Hard II and other great films. I mean, the guy&#39;s a legend. And so I just put myself in his hands. &#34;Renny, what do you want? What do you want me to do? Do this?&#34; And then if I come up with something good, then Renny&#39;s a great collaborator, so he&#39;ll just jump on board and we&#39;ll film it.
There&#39;s not too much talk about it. But I know that I&#39;m in good hands. I always say to Renny, and I just made another movie with Renny, and I said, &#34;Renny, I don&#39;t go behind the monitors to look. I trust you to do it all. I trust you that you&#39;re going to make a great movie and you know how to do action. And so I just trust you.&#34; And that&#39;s the way we do it.





That&#39;s incredible. Now, the action in this film is crazy. It&#39;s so intense. And, look, I know you get really committed into doing the action in these roles because another film I saw you in last year, which I absolutely love, was Rumble Through the Dark. What kind of training or preparation did you undergo to perform these action-packed sequences?


Aaron Eckhart: Well, before the movie, I fought trained. I worked out with a boxer for a couple weeks here and then we went and choreographed for a couple weeks there. But just in my daily life, I fight train. So I love to train fighting. I love to be physical. I love the athleticism of it. And I always say to young actors, &#34;There&#39;s three things that you should know how to do, so that you don&#39;t have to learn how to do them on the day, and one is throw a punch, ride a horse, and shoot a gun.&#34;
Because those three things are very difficult to learn well on the day. And if you go look at films in general, you&#39;re either doing one of those three things in most films, certainly in action films anyway. And so it behooves an actor to go out and get some boxing training or some martial arts training and some gun training so that you can do those things well.





That actually tees up this next question perfectly, because Vail paid his way through college by being a bricklayer. How much did you learn about bricklaying and throughout your filmography what skills have you picked up that you&#39;ve learned on the job?


Aaron Eckhart: Well, look, I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m a bricklayer. I&#39;m not saying it. But I did learn about bricklaying and I tried to do it as best I can. It is incredibly difficult to butter a brick, which is put the mortar on either side of it and then wipe it off and then place it and get it straight. I just have huge admiration for tradesmen who are laying brick or stone or anything like that, mixing mortar, and you&#39;re on your feet all day doing it. But I did that.
And the problem was that I learned in America to lay bricks and I was using the standard, just the small brick that you see as in a building. When I went over there, they&#39;re using these big bricks, which is a whole different thing. It was a little more difficult to butter and to make them straight. So I did that. I&#39;ve learned, well, I tell you what, when I was doing Erin Brockovich in &#39;97, I said to myself, &#34;If I have to get in shape and for the movies and all that, I&#39;m going to learn a skill while I do it.&#34; And I started boxing. So as far back as that, that&#39;s when I really started boxing and I&#39;ve done it throughout the years.
I can&#39;t remember all the movies I&#39;ve been in, but I always pick something up from a movie. I just played a airline pilot. And so whenever I&#39;m in a movie that if I&#39;m a pilot, then I go out in the real world in my real life and I try to get a pilot&#39;s license. Which I haven&#39;t gotten my pilot&#39;s license totally but I&#39;ve been up in planes and doing all that, not by myself, but with my trainer. Erin Brockovich, obviously you buy a motorcycle. So whatever I&#39;m doing, I usually end up trying in my real life to be that thing.
And it helps. Because if you&#39;re a cook, I did a movie where I was a cook, so I would go and I bought all the stuff and learned how to make gnocchi and all that and to mix and make sauces and to slice and dice and all that. And I always say to actors again, I say, &#34;Look, if you can do two things, if you can convince the audience, if you can do two things right, for example, like a cook, which is dice an onion without looking at it or flip the contents of a pan just with a wrist action, then you&#39;ll have the audience for the whole movie.
And you don&#39;t have to do anything else right.&#34; And it&#39;s basically true. If you can do things where I go, &#34;Wow, that guy knows what he&#39;s doing,&#34; one time, in the audience, it will reinforce that notion throughout the film, and you really won&#39;t have to do too much after that. And so I kind of go by that rule.





Yeah, I mean, I totally see that in this film. I mean, I guarantee that you look like a badass throughout this movie. Now, switching gears for a second. You were in one of the best comic book films ever, The Dark Knight, which I think is responsible for the superhero boom in cinema. What advice would you give to the current crop of superhero storytellers to bring audiences back into the box office?


Aaron Eckhart: Well, it&#39;s not what I would tell them. It&#39;s what&#39;s on film. It&#39;s what Chris did. If you take what your question right there and break it up and analyze it, and you say, &#34;The Dark Knight,&#34; which is Chris Nolan, &#34;brought that back,&#34; from where? Where did he bring it back from? He brought it and put it right in reality. He put it in truth in reality and made it concrete and real and tangible. And it was in fantasy land. And I haven&#39;t seen a lot of those movies lately, but I think it&#39;s gone back into fantasy land.
And the audiences, look at Heath&#39;s performance, look at Heath&#39;s makeup. Look at his makeup. Everybody thought that Heath, how should I say this? His makeup looked like he did it at home, right? And that&#39;s what we want. We want a superhero that&#39;s grounded in reality and we want villains that are grounded in reality. And Chris did that perfectly. And I think it set a benchmark for that. So I would say just get back to truth. Truth is where it&#39;s at.
