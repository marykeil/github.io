## Literature Review

Anyone But You passes a huge domestic box office milestone in its fourth weekend, highlighting the success of Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell&#39;s romcom.




Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell&#39;s romantic comedy Anyone But You has passed a major domestic box office milestone. The film, based on Shakespeare&#39;s Much Ado About Nothing, explores the budding relationship between two discordant individuals who pretend to couple up at a wedding in Australia. Along with Sweeney and Powell, the Anyone But You cast includes Alexandra Shipp, Hadley Robinson, Darren Barnet, Michelle Hurd, GaTa, Rachel Griffiths, and Durmot Mulroney. Following its release, the romcom has maintained a strong hold at the box office while earning praise from moviegoers, despite critical reception being mixed.




According to Deadline, Anyone But You will pass the $50 million mark domestically, reaching $57.4 million after its fourth week in theaters. With weekend numbers extending to Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the film is estimated to bring in a total of $9.25 million, and will see a 23% decrease for its 3-day performance.


 What Anyone But You&#39;s Success Could Mean For Romcoms 
          

Anyone But You remains a surprising box office hit, doubling its reported budget of $25 million, and managing to earn more than competitors Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and Migration in week four, although both films have gained larger overall sums. Earlier in January, Anyone But You&#39;s increase in gross set the romcom apart from other movies released around that time, and the latest update suggests that its steady performance may continue. Beyond monetary success, Anyone But You has also originated the viral trend of audiences exiting theaters, lip-syncing and dancing to the song &#34;Unwritten,&#34; by Natasha Bedingfield.




                  Does Anyone But You Have A Post-Credits Scene?   Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney&#39;s rom-com movie tells a complete story, but does Anyone But You have a post-credits scene worth waiting for still?   

In recent years, romcoms have become relegated to streaming platforms, but fans of the genre are advocating for a theatrical resurgence. While some films, including Crazy Rich Asians and 2022&#39;s Ticket to Paradise, have proven successful at the box office, it&#39;s still uncommon to find many wide releases. Just recently, Kate Hudson discussed why making romcoms has become difficult, revealing that getting male actors on board can be tough. With Anyone But You in mind, it&#39;s worth wondering whether Hollywood will acknowledge the commercial response by producing similar content, and if big-name talent will join.

Given Anyone But You&#39;s latest box office milestone, the film may be able to reach $100 million before its run ends. Because audiences appear to enjoy the movie, it will be interesting to see if more romcoms of that style get made as well.
