## Literature Review

Jason Statham&#39;s The Meg franchise has released its first sequel, and the British action movie star took home a respectable sum for Meg 2: The Trench.




Jason Statham&#39;s Meg 2: The Trench added to his fortune, with the monster movie sequel earning the action star a tidy sum. Statham has been at the heart of many major franchises during his career, and has been paid handsomely for his work. Not every Jason Statham franchise stars the actor as prominently as the Meg movies, and earnings can also fluctuate due to factors such as the profile of his co-stars and the success of previous entries. Bigger properties such as Fast &amp; Furious and The Expendables include Statham as part of an ensemble cast, but the British actor has also taken center stage.




The Meg was released in 2018 and proved a huge success at the box office, earning just shy of $530 million (via BoxOfficeMojo). Meg 2 marks the franchise&#39;s first sequel, and despite pulling in a lower $395 million, still made a more-than-respectable return on its investment. As the leading man of Meg 2&#39;s cast, Jason Statham landed a nice payday reprising the role of Jonas Taylor, reportedly earning more than he did for the first movie.

                  Meg 2: The Trench Ending Explained   Meg 2: The Trench pits Jason Statham&#39;s Jonas against a trio of giant sharks, with the explosive ending leaving the door open for another sequel.

Jason Statham&#39;s exact salary for Meg 2: The Trench has not been made public, and figures vary between reports. Nevertheless, FlickOnClick claims that the actor&#39;s salary came to $25 million, giving a broad idea of the fee Statham commanded for his second fishing trip. $20 million might be a more conservative estimate, but with the production budget of Meg 2 estimated to be in the $129 million range (via TheNumbers), Statham&#39;s earnings account for a hefty percentage of the movie&#39;s funding. As the biggest name on the call sheet, the actor is also the biggest pull the movie has.




A report from CaClubIndia states that the first Meg movie earned Jason Statham $16 million. If these figures are accurate, then Meg 2 made its lead actor considerably more than the first movie. Although a Meg 3 sequel has yet to be confirmed, a continuation of the trend established over the first two films would lead to a further increase in Statham&#39;s salary.

Meg 2 is one of Statham&#39;s highest earners, if not his most valuable single movie. In one of his earliest major roles, Jason Statham reportedly made a total of $6 million for the Transporter trilogy, which ran from 2002 to 2008. Statham&#39;s Expendables salary is much more impressive, with the star taking away between $15-25 million (via ARYNews) for his fourth appearance in the role of Lee Christmas in 2023&#39;s Expend4bles. With Fast X taking him closer to his record with a salary of $18 million, Meg 2: The Trench stands among the movies that have made Jason Statham the most money.






Both The Meg and Meg 2: The Trench are available to stream on Netflix.
