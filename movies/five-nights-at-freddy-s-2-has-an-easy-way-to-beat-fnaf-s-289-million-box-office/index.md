## Literature Review

If Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 really is going to happen, there is an easy way for the sequel to break the first movie’s already amazing box office.




With Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 officially happening, there is already a big way that the sequel can break the first movie&#39;s already outstanding box office numbers. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is a horror video game franchise that first came out in 2014, and in 2023, was adapted into a feature film starring Josh Hutcherson. The story follows a man named Mike Schmidt who becomes the night security guard at an abandoned pizzeria called Freddie Fazbear&#39;s Pizzeria. However, his life becomes complicated when he discovers that the building&#39;s animatronics are possessed by murderous ghosts, and they want to be friends with his little sister.




Although Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s did not impress critics, its box office numbers were impressive. On a $20 million budget, the film made $295.3 million at the box office. Much of this had to do with the significant fanbase that the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s video game franchise already had before the movie&#39;s release. Furthermore, with Josh Hutcherson as the lead and Matthew Lillard as William Afton, audience members that knew nothing about the video game were still enticed to go to theaters. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s success implied that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 was imminent, and there is already an avenue for the franchise to make even more money.

                  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Must Pay Off The Movie&#39;s Most Legendary Easter Egg   With FNAF fans excited about a cinematic sequel to 2023&#39;s hit film, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 must payoff the first movie&#39;s most legendary Easter egg.   


 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Could Ditch The Simultaneous Streaming &amp; Theatrical Release Plan 
          




One massive way for Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 to do better than the first film is to provide a theatrical release only, rather than a simultaneous streaming and theatrical release plan. Originally, 2023&#39;s Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s was released in theaters and on Peacock at the same time, on October 27, 2023. In this way, the movie succeeded at the box office, but also split some of its audience with streaming. Therefore, viewers that might have gone to the theater streamed the movie instead, decreasing the maximum box office amount that the film could have brought in. Ultimately, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 should not do this.

When it comes out, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 should do a theatrical release only. This way, audiences will have to go to theaters to see the movie, and in turn, the box office numbers will be higher. While the first Five Night&#39;s at Freddy&#39;s may have been concerned about relying solely on theatrical release, those worries are not as relevant with the sequel. There is now confirmation that there is an audience for this franchise, and therefore, people will go to see it at the theaters. Overall, ditching Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s first plan will likely lead to greater success for the franchise as a whole.






 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Releasing Exclusively In Theaters Would Bolster The Box Office 
          

If Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 abandons an immediate streaming release, it will no doubt improve the movie&#39;s box office numbers. As previously mentioned, if the film does not have to split its viewership between theaters and streaming, then there will be more people in theaters, and therefore more box office money. But more than that, making Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 a theater-only release will make it more of an event. After 2023&#39;s Barbenheimer, it is clear that moviegoers enjoy the idea of making a movie an event, and Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is unique enough that this will definitely be hyped and well-attended.
