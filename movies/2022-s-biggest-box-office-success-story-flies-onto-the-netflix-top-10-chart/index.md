 Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s Success Explained 
          

Though Top Gun: Maverick wasn&#39;t the highest-grossing movie of 2022, which was the $2.3 billion Avatar: The Way of Water, Cruise&#39;s blockbuster was released earlier during the summer and was widely credited with saving the theatrical industry after the COVID-19 pandemic. Top Gun: Maverick made $1.4 billion at the box office and, in addition to being the second-highest-grossing film of 2022, is also the highest-grossing of Cruise&#39;s career who, surprisingly, never had a billion dollar movie before the Top Gun sequel.




In addition to its box office success, Top Gun: Maverick was acclaimed by critics, with many calling it superior to the original. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a surprise nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, though it won Best Sound. Top Gun: Maverick, with its exhilarating aerial sequences and surprisingly heartfelt story, is continuing to captivate audiences on Netflix well over a year after its release, making a strong case for how, like the original movie, the sequel is already an action classic.



Though Top Gun: Maverick isn&#39;t available on Netflix in the United States, it&#39;s also streaming on Paramount&#43; and Prime Video.
