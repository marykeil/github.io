## Literature Review

Argylle director Matthew Vaughn addresses the internet conspiracy theory claiming that Taylor Swift wrote the book that the movie is based on.




Argylle&#39;s Taylor Swift theory gets a definitive answer from director Matthew Vaughn. The new star-studded film, based on the novel of the same name, has been a topic of Swift&#39;s fandom in recent weeks, as her fans claim the singer wrote the book under a pseudonym. The theory began when some discovered there is no internet history of an Elly Conway, the author who wrote Argylle. Then, people recalled Swift&#39;s history of wearing and sellling argyle sweaters. A few other similarities, such as Swift owning two Scottish Fold cats, the same as Argylle&#39;s protagonist, fueled their discussions.




Speaking with Rolling Stone, Argylle director Matthew Vaughn addresses the Taylor Swift book theories. Vaughn explains who wrote the book, and how the film was inspired by Swift. See his response to the theories below:


“I’m not a big internet guy, and it was actually my daughter who came up to me — this is the power of celebrity and the internet — and said, ‘You never told me Taylor wrote the book!’ And I’m looking at her going, ‘What are you talking about Taylor Swift wrote the book? She didn’t write the book!’ And I was laughing because I was like, ‘It’s not true! She didn’t write the book!’ But my daughter was convinced of it.”
“There is a real book… and it’s a really good book. And there is an Elly Conway who wrote the book, but it’s not Taylor Swift. And I say that because I imagine Taylor Swift has a load of people trying to jump on her bandwagon left, right, and center, and I don’t want to be a part of that club. I did read the conspiracies and I was like, wow, they don’t leave a stone unturned! But it’s not Taylor Swift. She definitely didn’t write the book.”







The Argylle book was published on January 9.





 Argylle&#39;s Plot &amp; One Taylor Swift Connection Explained 
          

While Vaughn maintains that Swift did not write Argylle, the singer still somewhat inspired the film. Vaughn reveals that the Scottish Fold cat that stars in Argylle as the protagonist&#39;s companion, Alfie, is his family&#39;s own cat, Chip. His family got the cat after watching Swift&#39;s Miss Americana documentary, which features her own pets, Meredith and Olivia. His daughters secretly convinced their mom to adopt the cat behind Vaughn&#39;s back, and his feature film debut is in Argylle.

Argylle centers around Elly (Bryce Dallas Howard), an introverted author who experiences mayhem after the fictional events of her novels, which follow a spy named Argylle, begin to come to life. The action thriller features an A-list cast including Sam Rockwell, Henry Cavill, Ariana DeBose, John Cena, Bryan Cranston, Samuel L. Jackson, Dua Lipa, and Catherine O’Hara. Elly&#39;s world is turned upside down when she must deal with international spies, assassins, international conflicts, and real-life chaos as her own story unravels in front of her.




As Vaughn is known for action titles such as the Kingsman movies and Kick-Ass, his take on Argylle is likely to deliver the same thrills and visual story-telling as previous successes. A lot is on the line with his latest, as it has the potential to become a franchise. However, that is only if it is a success at the box office and is received well by critics. While Vaughn has a string of successful action-thrillers behind him, the last four films he&#39;s directed have struggled to see the same critical success. Argylle could turn the tides for the filmmaker.
