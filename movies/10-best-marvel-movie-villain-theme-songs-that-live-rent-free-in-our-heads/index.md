## Literature Review

Marvel movies have had some incredible villain themes over the years, with tracks that tell stories and invoke terror worthy of a true evildoer.




Movies of the MCU and other cinematic Marvel properties have had some amazing original soundtracks, particularly when it comes to the villains&#39; themes. While licensed music from famous artists usually gets most of the spotlight when it comes to superhero movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has some amazing original songs worthy of special praise. Specifically, the various villains of Marvel films have had some spine-chillingly great scores that perfectly emphasize their characteristics and stories while making audience members&#39; hair stand on end with terror when played in the theater.
Marvel Studios aren&#39;t the only ones to have some amazing villain songs, with the many of Disney&#39;s best music being villainous in nature. There&#39;s something about a the menacing antagonist of a superhero movie that lends itself perfectly to some excellent pieces of music, with composers given free reign to go all-out in encapsulating the danger and intrigue of a given antagonist with nothing but sound alone. Even outside of the context of the movies they show up in, certain villains&#39; themes are worth listening to in their own right as worthy additions to any atmospheric playlist.









 








 10  Venom&#39;s Theme Straddles The Line Between Hero And Villain 
Venom (2018)


 







The protagonists of Sony&#39;s Spider-Man spinoff universe live in an interesting limbo between hero and villain, acting as heroes for the purposes of their films despite ostensibly committing villainous acts. No piece of music better captures this duality than Venom&#39;s title theme, oscillating between the triumphant brass notes and lingering, somber strings. Despite being somewhat overshadowed by Eminem&#39;s Venom rap in popular culture, Venom&#39;s title themes works perfectly in the film as a darkly brilliant piece that lifts up the audience much in the same way Venom lifts up Eddie&#39;s mangled body.







 9  Magneto&#39;s Theme Conveys His Conviction And Power 
X-Men: First Class (2011)
        

Though Magneto doesn&#39;t begin the events of the prequel X-Men: First Class as a pure villain, the film follows his moral decay, becoming ever colder and indifferent towards humans and Charles Xavier&#39;s attempts to reconcile mutantkind. His menacing theme, created by storied film composer Henry Jackman (No relation to Hugh), conveys his power, convictions, and future as the X-Men&#39;s most prominent villain all at once. Using instrumentation reminiscent of the 90s X-Men cartoon&#39;s theme, Magneto&#39;s song is impossible to misplace as belonging to anyone but the master of magnetism himself.







 8  Juggernaut&#39;s Theme Is A Hilarious Parody Of Hollywood Music 
Deadpool 2 (2018)
        

At first, Juggernaut&#39;s theme in Deadpool 2 has all the typical loud orchestral weight and latin-sounding vocals of a typical Hollywood Blockbuster. For those actually paying attention to the song, aptly titled You Can&#39;t Stop This Mother******, the joke of Deadpool 2&#39;s OST reveals itself, commenting on Juggernaut&#39;s power within the comedic setting, with lyrics like &#34;Fighting Dirty&#34; and &#34;Holy ****Balls&#34; chanted with the ironic gravity of a true epic. Beyond being a funny extra bit of humor embedded within the film&#39;s soundtrack, Juggernaut&#39;s theme does deliver the character&#39;s weight and strength via blaring instrumentation.







 7  The Vulture&#39;s Theme Scavenges The Avengers&#39; 
Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)


 







Not only is the Vulture one of the most justified villains in MCU history, but he&#39;s blessed with one of the series best scores by genius composer Michael Giacchino. While still managing to convey the insidious winged terror Michael Keaton&#39;s Vulture represents, the track also provides a villainous motif of the Avengers&#39; signature theme, alluding to how Adrian Toomes scavenges the aftermath of the heroes&#39; battles for technology like a real vulture scavenges for food. The Vulture certainly isn&#39;t an easy Spider-Man villain to get audiences to take seriously, but thanks to this theme and Keaton&#39;s performance, The Vulture was more menacing than ever.







 6  Whiplash&#39;s Theme Is A Dark Reflection Of Iron Man&#39;s 
Iron Man 2 (2010)
        

Despite being a forgotten villain in one of the MCU&#39;s lesser-regarded films, Whiplash has one of the most impressive villain themes in the entire series. Corrupting the signature rock guitar of Iron Man&#39;s theme alongside a driving synth beat and a forbidding Soviet choir that pays homage to his Russian heritage, Whiplash&#39;s entrance music makes an unforgettable impression. Ivan Vanko&#39;s theme reminds us that while Whiplash might not be the most memorable villain, he still managed to emulate Tony Stark&#39;s genius, coming dangerously close to destroying his legacy.







 5  The Winter Soldier&#39;s Theme Is Pure Anxiety 
Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
        

Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of the MCU&#39;s most critically successful solo films, and it has an OST worthy of the praise it received. The theme for The Winter Soldier is anything but easy listening -- In fact, it&#39;s hardly a song at all. Just as the right combination of words can activate Bucky&#39;s Winter Soldier programming, the droning sound of his eerie theme is the quickest route to instilling fear in the audience&#39;s heart. Complete with jarring sounds of hissing static, emulating the thunder and lighting in Bucky&#39;s head, and scant whispers that represent the anxiety The Winter Soldier causes, this theme is terrifyingly effective.







 4  Killmonger&#39;s Theme Represents His Origins 
Black Panther (2018)


 







Another one of Marvel&#39;s most sympathetic villains, Killmonger grew up torn between two worlds -- The promise of a better life in the utopian Wakanda dreamt into his head by his father, and the gritty reality of growing up underprivileged in Oakland. Oscar-winning composer Ludwig GÃ¶ransson manages to get this across with music alone, combining the trilling traditional instrumentation representing Wakanda with a driving trap hi-hat beat that lets the listener know where Killmonger&#39;s loyalties truly lie. The smooth, atmospheric song made a return in What If...? Episode 6, proving that it was worthy of a repeat performance.







 3  The Prowler&#39;s Theme Evokes A Fight-Or-Flight Response 
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)
        

Considering the soundtrack of 2018&#39;s animated Spider-Man hit also featured a song by Post Malone, which topped the year&#39;s charts, it&#39;s all the more impressive that an instrumental villain theme from the same film managed to maintain so much space in the public&#39;s consciousness. Punctuated by a recurring synthetic roar that gets louder and louder, The Prowler&#39;s theme gets the heart racing, evoking a fight-or-flight response with primal fear. The film&#39;s signature breakcore drums and record scratches that come in once the action starts is just the cherry on top.







 2  Spider-Man 2099&#39;s Theme Is A Neon Nightmare 
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)


 







Very much an antagonist despite holding the title of Spider-Man, Miguel O&#39;Hara is a tortured hero from a distant future who does terrible things for the right reasons. Somehow, his theme in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse manages to get all of this across, despite being only a minute long. Miguel&#39;s signature synth sting was powerful enough to leap from the big screen to become a popular TikTok audio, being passed through an avalanche of memes. This track can immediately put the listener in Miguel&#39;s brooding mind, standing in the rain and gazing up at a neon future secured at a terrible price.







 1  The Electro Suite Tells The Character&#39;s Entire Story 
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)
        

Despite being stuck in the one of the worst Spider-Man films, Hans Zimmers&#39; work on Electro&#39;s them produced one of the most incredible villain OSTs ever. Comprehensively telling the story of the character, the wandering, lonely woodwind describes Max&#39;s dull life, with quiet whispers hinting at an underlying tension. The intensity of the piece slowly builds as Max comes to a breaking point, eventually becoming Electro. Of course, this results in the whispers becoming louder, the music becoming harsher, and the instrumentation becoming much less acoustic. The electrifying buzz that the theme culminates in utterly outmatches any villain theme in the MCU.
