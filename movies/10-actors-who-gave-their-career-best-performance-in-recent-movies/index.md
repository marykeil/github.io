 10  Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner 
Uncut Gems (2019)


 







  Uncut Gems  


  Release Date    December 13, 2019     Director    Josh Safdie , Benny Safdie     Cast    Jonathan Aranbayev , Eric Bogosian , The Weeknd , Idina Menzel , Noa Fisher , Kevin Garnett , Tommy Kominik , LaKeith Stanfield , Jacob Igielski , Adam Sandler , Julia Fox , Keith Williams Richards     Runtime    134 minutes    


Uncut Gems is not the first time for Adam Sandler to show his penchant for dramatic roles, but his performance as Howard Ratner reveals the true depths of the legendary comedian&#39;s potential as a real actor. In what is largely considered to be the best of Adam Sandler&#39;s movies, the actor serves as the fulcrum of this dizzying portrayal of anxiety and gambling addiction, immersing himself in the chaotic world of the charismatic yet flawed jeweler with a penchant for risky bets. Informed by years of playing similarly unpredictable caricatures, Sandler flawlessly captures the frenetic energy and desperation of Howard Ratner, a character whom Sandler seemed destined to portray.





 9  Michelle Yeoh as Evelyn Quan Wang 
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022)


 







  Everything Everywhere All at Once  


  Release Date    March 25, 2022     Director    Daniel Kwan , Daniel Scheinert     Cast    Jenny Slate , Ke Huy Quan , Stephanie Hsu , Harry Shum Jr. ,  Jamie Lee Curtis , James Hong , Michelle Yeoh     Runtime    132 minutes

Her performance is a captivating blend of strength, vulnerability, and resilience, capturing the essence of Evelyn&#39;s incredible journey across different dimensions and timelines.

 8  Lupita Nyong&#39;o as Adelaide &#34;Addy&#34; Wilson and Red 
Us (2019)
        

  Us  


  Release Date    March 22, 2019     Director    Jordan Peele     Cast    Noelle Sheldon , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Lupita Nyong&#39;o , Cali Sheldon , Tim Heidecker , Winston Duke , Evan Alex , Elisabeth Moss , Shahadi Wright Joseph     Runtime    120 minutes    


Lupita Nyong&#39;o&#39;s dual role in Us as Adelaide &#34;Addy&#34; Wilson and Red is a masterclass in dramatic versatility. Nyong&#39;o seamlessly embodies two distinct characters with contrasting personas and physicality. As Adelaide, Nyong&#39;o portrays a loving mother with an underlying trauma, while as the raspy-voiced Red, she embodies a haunting and enigmatic doppelgänger with a chilling presence. Nyong&#39;o&#39;s ability to convey the complexity of these characters - both emotionally and physically - adds layers to the film&#39;s captivating suspense. In this unusual dual role, Nyong&#39;o showcases her exceptional range as a performer, contributing significantly to the intriguing atmosphere of the psychological thriller.
            
 
 Why Red&#39;s Voice Sounds Like That in Jordan Peele&#39;s Us 
Red&#39;s raspy voice is one of the creepiest, cleverest things about Jordan Peele&#39;s Us, but why it sounds like that makes it even creepier.








 7  Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies 
Mank (2020)
        

  Mank  


  Release Date    December 4, 2020     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Lily Collins , Arliss Howard , Charles Dance , Amanda Seyfried , Gary Oldman     Runtime    131 minutes    


Marked by a nuanced blend of wit and vulnerability, Amanda Seyfried&#39;s portrayal of the legendary Marion Davies is undoubtedly the actor&#39;s greatest role to date. Realizing Davies as more than just a glamorous figure, Seyfried&#39;s charismatic presence brings to life the challenges faced by a woman navigating the tumultuous waters of Hollywood&#39;s golden age. While not exactly known for her acting prowess, Seyfried delivers a complex exploration of Davies&#39; life, career, and her relationships with powerful historical figures like Herman J. Mankiewicz and William Randolph Hearst. Rather than falling into the trap of turning Davies into a caricature, Seyfried authentically embodies one of the most influential women in Hollywood history.





 6  Emily Blunt as Katherine &#34;Kitty&#34; Oppenheimer 
Oppenheimer (2023)
        

  Oppenheimer  
9 
/ 10 




  Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr. , Rami Malek , Florence Pugh     Runtime    150 Minutes    


The cast of Oppenheimer is filled with A-listers delivering some of the best performances of their entire careers, but one role stands out among the rest - Emily Blunt&#39;s portrayal of Katherine &#34;Kitty&#34; Oppenheimer. A brilliant scientist whose mind is wasted by domestication from her marriage to J. Robert Oppenheimer, Katherine is a whirlwind of frustration and regret, which Blunt deftly portrays with both tact and unwavering intelligence. From Katherine&#39;s rejection of the social expectations for women at the time, to her role in the rise and fall of the titular atomic scientist, Blunt fills the screen with a fiery intensity unlike anyone else in the all-star Oppenheimer cast.





 5  Colin Farrell as Padraic Suilleabhain 
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022)


 







  The Banshees of Inisherin  
4 
/ 10 




  Release Date    October 21, 2022     Director    Martin McDonagh     Cast    Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Kerry Condon , Barry Keoghan     Runtime    109 minutes    


For their respective roles as Padraic and Colm, Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson earned their first well-deserved Academy Award nominations. However, while The Banshees of Inisherin hinges on the tense breakup of the friendship between the two, it is Farrell&#39;s Padraic who does much of the emotional heavy-lifting in this darkly comedic meditation on isolation, miscommunication, and legacy. Whether viewed as an allegory for the Irish Civil War during the early 20th century, or simply as an absurd tale of a friendship gone sour on an isolated island town, Farrell delivers the most powerful dramatic performance of his career as a man desperate for companionship and understanding.
            
 
 What Are The Banshees of Inisherin? (It’s Complicated) 
Golden Globe winner The Banshees of Inisherin has a strange title, and the movie&#39;s two feuding Irishmen are the key to understanding its meaning. 








 4  Alfre Woodard as Bernadine Williams 
Clemency (2019)
        

As the stoic and conflicted prison warden Bernadine Williams - the central character of Clemency - Alfre Woodard navigates the moral complexities of overseeing legal executions with profound depth. With Bernadine&#39;s personal life unraveling from the stresses of her profession, the character is a pressure cooker of emotional and ethical dilemmas. Channeling her long history of playing powerful and misunderstood Black women, Woodard&#39;s role as Williams expertly humanizes Clemency&#39;s dark exploration of the weight of capital punishment. While Woodard is far from being a household name today, her performance in Clemency is a compelling reminder of why she was one of the most iconic Hollywood actresses from the &#39;80s.





 3  Emma Stone as Bella Baxter/Victoria Blessington 
Poor Things (2023)
        

  Poor Things  
9 
/ 10 




  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Yorgos Lanthimos     Cast    Emma Stone , Willem Dafoe , Mark Ruffalo , Ramy Youssef , Jerrod Carmichael , Christopher Abbott     Runtime    141 Minutes    


Delightfully unhinged and deeply moving all at once, Emma Stone is Poor Things protagonist Bella Baxter, a formerly dead woman resurrected by fantastical science and imparted with the brain of a newborn. From her humble bumbling beginnings as Bella, to her transformation into an independent woman as Victoria Blessington, Stone serves as the muse of director Yorgos Lanthimos&#39; gothic, whimsical, Frankenstein-inspired coming-of-age comedic horror. While the actor first rose to prominence as a star of teen comedies, Stone&#39;s transformative role in Poor Things proves that she has what it takes to take on even the most challenging roles in modern arthouse cinema.
            
 
 Emma Stone’s New Frankenstein Movie Has A Good Shot At Beating Her 5-Year-Old Rotten Tomatoes Record 
Emma Stone’s next collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos is the upcoming dark comedy Poor Things, and it has a chance at breaking a record.








 2  Brendan Fraser as Charlie 
The Whale (2022)
        

  The Whale  
6 
/ 10 




  Release Date    December 9, 2022     Director    Darren Aronofsky     Cast    Brendan Fraser , Sadie Sink , Hong Chau , Samantha Morton , Ty Simpkins     Runtime    117 minutes    


A recluse who is estranged from his daughter and suffering from morbid obesity, Brendan Fraser paints a compelling, relatable, and empathetic picture of mental and physical illness as Charlie in The Whale. Critics and audiences alike have sung high praises for Fraser&#39;s performance as the reclusive and deeply emotional Charlie. Even with the single-location setting and heavy prosthetics limiting his movements, Fraser&#39;s expressive delivery and body language fully embodies Charlie&#39;s frustrations and regrets about how he has lived his life. Apart from serving as Fraser&#39;s return to mainstream cinema after a long hiatus, his performance in The Whale bagged Fraser his very first Academy Award for Best Actor.





 1  Benedict Cumberbatch as Phil Burbank 
The Power of the Dog (2021)
        

  The Power of the Dog  


  Release Date    November 17, 2021     Director    Jane Campion     Cast    Frances Conroy , Jesse Plemons , Kirsten Dunst , Thomasin McKenzie , Peter Carroll , Adam Beach , Kodi Smit-McPhee , Keith Carradine , Benedict Cumberbatch     Runtime    126 minutes    


In 21st century cinema, few other characters have so deeply captured the toxicity of internalized homophobia than The Power of the Dog&#39;s Phil Burbank. As the closeted cowboy Phil, Benedict Cumberbatch demands attention and somehow inspires both terror and pity. Whether he&#39;s torturing his own family with petty displays of machismo - or gracefully reminiscing about his deceased lover Bronco Henry - Cumberbatch is the central fulcrum of this captivating unraveling of homosexuality in the Old West. Westerns that tackle the lives of LGBTQ&#43; folk aren&#39;t new, but by revisiting the extreme macho archetypes of the genre, Cumberbatch creates a character that is both timeless and timely in Phil Burbank.
