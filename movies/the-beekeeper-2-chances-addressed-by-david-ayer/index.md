Summary

  Director David Ayer addresses the chances of The Beekeeper 2.   Ayer would be interested in making a sequel, as he believes that there is more lore to explore in the world of the Beekeepers.   A sequel is not greenlit yet, and will likely depend on the box office showing of The Beekeeper.  







Director David Ayer addresses the chances of The Beekeeper 2. The new action thriller follows protagonist Adam Clay (Jason Statham), a retired operative who was part of a clandestine organization called &#34;The Beekeeper.&#34; However, when his good friend takes her life after becoming a victim of a phishing scam, he takes matters into his own hands and seeks revenge. Alongside Statham, The Beekeeper also features Emmy Raver-Lampman, Jeremy Irons, Bobby Naderi, and Josh Hutcherson.

Speaking with Inverse, Ayer spoke about the chances of The Beekeeper 2. He said the action movie merely “cracked the door a little bit into the Beekeeper world.” While no sequel is confirmed yet, the director had several questions surrounding the movie&#39;s lore that leaves “so much room to explore.” Check out his full quote below:


“We cracked the door a little bit into the Beekeeper world, and I would love to learn more about them. I’m extremely curious: Where do they come from? Who are they? How do they operate? What happened in the system? Did it break? Did the Beekeepers break? Do we have to fix the Beekeepers? Who fixes the Beekeepers when the Beekeepers need fixing?
“It’s just an amazing mythology. There’s so much room to explore.”






 How Likely Is The Beekeeper 2 To Happen? 
          

This is not the first time that anyone from the movie&#39;s cast and crew addressed the potential of The Beekeeper 2. Over a month before the movie&#39;s release, Statham spoke about the grand “mythology” surrounding the R-rated The Beekeeper, discussing similar ways to expand the lore. He also said that he would be excited to make a sequel should it be greenlit. Statham is also no stranger to leading an action franchise such as The Transporter and The Mechanic.

The first reviews of The Beekeeper suggest that the action movie has the potential to go further and even develop into a franchise. It boasts a 68% critical score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 99 reviews. This is a decent score for any Statham movie, given that his last film, The Meg 2: The Trench, was critically panned with just 37%. Ayer also benefits from the generally positive reviews since the director has been struggling with critics. This includes his 2016 DCU movie, Suicide Squad, which scored only 26% on Rotten Tomatoes.




                  Are The Beekeepers Real? Jason Statham&#39;s Action Movie Inspiration Explained   Jason Statham&#39;s latest action movie has viewers wondering if The Beekeepers are a real organization. Here&#39;s what to know about the film&#39;s inspiration.   

In addition, The Beekeeper&#39;s ending opens the door for more exploration of the secret organization and Adam. After fulfilling his task by killing Derek Danforth (Hutcherson), an injured Adam escapes into the sea. This is after FBI Agent Verona Parker (Raver-Lampman) spares him from arrest. The movie itself doesn&#39;t address much detail about the mysterious titular organization, so there is an opportunity to look into its origins. So, with Adam very much alive, lots of questions, and both the director and Statham&#39;s sequel interest, more movies are likely. However, The Beekeeper 2&#39;s chances will ultimately come down to the movie&#39;s box office and find enough success.
