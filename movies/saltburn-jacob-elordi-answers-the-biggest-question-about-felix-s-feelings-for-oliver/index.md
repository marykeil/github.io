Summary

  Jacob Elordi says Felix truly loved Oliver despite his cruel actions in Saltburn, reflecting the complexity of human nature.   The falling out between Felix and Oliver leads to Felix&#39;s death and Oliver&#39;s spree of killings.   The doomed relationship between Felix and Oliver adds to the dark and complex nature of the movie.  







Saltburn star Jacob Elordi has answered a big question about Felix and his true feelings for Oliver. The psychological thriller focuses on Elordi&#39;s Felix inviting his classmate, Oliver (Barry Keoghan), to the film&#39;s titular estate. The pair&#39;s relationship soon grows, however, it&#39;s unclear if there was any real love between them, or if it was an impermanent matter of circumstance.

Speaking with Collider, Elordi revealed he thinks that, despite Saltburn&#39;s twisted moments throughout, Felix truly felt like he loved Oliver. However, the actor emphasized how Felix also doesn&#39;t understand when he&#39;s being cruel, reflective of people in real life. Check out what Elordi had to say below:


I think he loves everything fully and completely. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s conscious of the kind of cruelty that&#39;s inside him. Which is like most people, you know? I don&#39;t think a lot of people set out to be cruel, and yet, look at where we live.

Following Felix&#39;s invitation to Saltburn, Oliver begins to grow closer to him, showcased in disturbing, often sexual scenes. However, things take a turn when it&#39;s revealed the latter&#39;s parents are still alive, with neither of them being substance abuse victims as he&#39;d previously claimed. This results in a falling out between the pair, which later leads to Felix&#39;s death - revealed later to be at Oliver&#39;s hands.

The event is the catalyst for Keoghan&#39;s character to begin a spree of killings, targeting members of the Catton family. The result is him inheriting the titular estate by the end, dancing in celebration. While Felix may have had genuine feelings that he couldn&#39;t process correctly, the movie&#39;s protagonist seemingly didn&#39;t return the favor. This makes the movie even darker, as it indicates a relationship between the pair was always doomed to fail.

                  Chilling Saltburn Theory Reveals That Oliver Already Met Felix&#39;s &#34;Toy&#34; From The Previous Summer   Saltburn sets up and resolves a lot of mysteries, but one of the film&#39;s biggest Felix questions may have an answer that isn&#39;t so clear.   




While there are still some unanswered questions in Saltburn by the end of the movie, these add to the complexity of its characters and the relationships presented. Elordi&#39;s statement shines more light on Felix, though, giving more nuance to his character. The same can be said for everyone else in the movie too, whose complexities are illustrated throughout the film.



Saltburn was directed by Emerald Fennell, also known for directing 2020&#39;s Promising Young Woman.
