## Literature Review

Han Solo won the Millennium Falcon from Lando Calrissian in a game of sabacc. Here&#39;s how to play two different versions of the iconic Star Wars game.




Sabacc is the infamous card game of Star Wars, adjacent to the real world&#39;s poker with its high stakes and risky bets. Made famous by Lando Calrissian and Han Solo, sabacc&#39;s origin goes back to the original scripts for The Empire Strikes Back, where Lando is said to have won Cloud City in a &#34;sabacca game.&#34; Since then, it has grown a legacy of its own in Star Wars canon, with the ending of Solo: A Star Wars Story showing how Han won the Millennium Falcon from Lando in an intense game of sabacc.




The sabacc card game itself has many variations, or Shifts. The Shift seen in Solo is &#34;Corellian Spike,&#34; the same variation of the game that&#39;s available for purchase at Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge. Another Shift, known as &#34;Coruscant Shift,&#34; was made famous by Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser immersive experience at the Walt Disney World Resort, and its unique deck was exclusively available for purchase there until its closure in September 2023. Still, this version of sabacc has been immortalized, and it&#39;s certainly still a fun game to play. Here&#39;s how to play these two specific Shifts of sabacc.

 Corellian Spike 
History In Star Wars
         




Corellian Spike was first seen in Solo, when Han and Lando played on Numidian Prime both for passage on a mission and for the grand prize of the Millennium Falcon. This was also the first time a game of sabacc was actually played in live-action Star Wars, and thus it became the version that Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge made available for sale at the shop Toydarian Toymaker. Its namesake comes from the planet Corellia, where this specific Shift no doubt originated - hence Han&#39;s knack for the game.

Materials &amp; Rules
          

Obviously, having a Corellian Spike specific deck is ideal for playing this sabacc Shift, but a simple deck of cards could fulfill the task if custom rules or modifications are set in place. Two dice are also needed, preferably ones that match in number or style. There must be 60 cards in the deck total, with 3 different suits, called &#34;staves&#34; - circles, squares, and triangles - and 10 green cards, with positive values between 1 and 10, and 10 red cards, with negative values between 1 and 10. There are also two zero-value cards, also known as the sylops - which is Old Corellian for &#34;idiot.&#34;




The object of the game is to get as close to zero as possible by the end of the game&#39;s three rounds. Positive cards add up together, and negative cards add up to more negatives. Whoever&#39;s hand is closest to zero by the end of the game wins, and each hand must consist of at least two cards.

Gameplay
          

The dealer starts the game by shuffling the deck and distributing two cards to each player. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile, with an empty space left next to it for the Discard Pile. The player to the dealer&#39;s left takes the first turn, where they&#39;re presented with four different options:

  Gain: The player can draw a new card from the Draw Pile. This card can be discarded if desired, but the player must discard it before drawing again.   Swap: The player can take a face-up card from the top of the Discard Pile and trade it for one of their own.   Stand: The player can do nothing if they do not desire to draw or discard.   Junk: The player can set their entire hand on the Discard Pile and leave the game if they believe they have no shot left at winning. If one player is left afterward, they automatically become the winner.  




Once every player has taken their turn, the dealer rolls the dice. If both symbols on the dice match, then all players must discard their entire hand and the dealer must distribute each player the same amount of cards they just lost. If the symbols are different, then the players can keep their hands. After the third round is complete and the dice have been rolled one final time, all players reveal their hands. The player with the value of zero, and the best hand, wins. The following are the different types of winning hands, from most valuable to least valuable:

  Pure Sabacc: Two sylops (zero-value cards).   Full Sabacc: A sylop card with four of a kind 10s, two positive and two negative.   Fleet: A sylop card with four of a kind, aside from 10s. The lower integer value wins in a tiebreaker.   Yee-Haa: A sylop card with two of a kind.   Rhylet: A positive three of a kind and a negative two of a kind.   Squadron: Four of a kind.   Gee Whiz: Four positives and one negative, or four negatives and one positive.   Straight Khyron: A run of four.   Banthas Wild: Three of a kind.   Rule Of Two: Two pairs.   Sabacc: One pair.   Sabacc With Most Cards: In the event none of the former hands have been identified, then the player who equals zero with the most cards total wins.   Sabacc With Highest Value Cards: In the event none of the former hands have been identified and the number of cards is equal, then the player with the highest positive value cards total in their hand wins.   Sabacc With Highest Single Value Card: In the event none of the former hands have been identified, the number of cards is equal, and the sum of each player&#39;s positive value cards is the same, then the player with the highest positive single value card in their hand wins.   Nulrhek: In the event none of the players have equaled zero, then the player closest to zero wins.   Nulrhek With Positive Score: In the event none of the players have equaled zero, the players have reached an equal value, and their total number of cards is the same, then the player with a positive score closest to zero wins.   Nulrhek With Most Cards: In the event none of the players have equaled zero, the players have reached an equal value, and none of the players have a positive total score, then the player with the most cards total in their hand wins.   Nulrhek With Highest Value Cards: In the event none of the players have equaled zero, the players have reached an equal value, none of the players have a positive total score, and their total number of cards is the same, then the player with the highest positive value cards total in their hand wins.   Nulrhek With Highest Value Single Cards: In the event none of the players have equaled zero, the players have reached an equal value, none of the players have a positive total score, their total number of cards is the same, and the sum of each player&#39;s positive value cards is the same, then the player with the highest positive single value card in their hand wins.   Single Blind Draw: If a tie still persists at this point, then each player draws a singular card from the Draw Pile, and the player whose singular card is closest to zero wins.  






 Coruscant Shift 
History In Star Wars
          

Originating on the planet of Coruscant, Coruscant Shift found its popularity on luxury and casino ships, such as Chandrila Star Line&#39;s Halcyon starcruiser. Coruscant Shift was the type of sabacc played on holosabacc tables, many of which once filled the Halcyon when the Hutt clan had possession of the ship. Han Solo played this type of sabacc onboard the Halcyon for his honeymoon after he snuck inside the ship&#39;s engineering room, as featured in Beth Revis&#39; novel The Princess and the Scoundrel.

Materials &amp; Rules
          

Similarly to Corellian Spike, Coruscant Shift is best played with its specific deck, but can be modified to fit a regular deck of cards as well. Coruscant Shift also uses two dice, though one of these dice must have values of 0, -5, &#43;5, -10, and &#43;10, while the other dice must have triangles, circles, and squares. There must be 60 cards in the deck total, with 3 different staves - triangles, circles, and squares - and 10 green cards, with positive values between 1 and 10, and 10 red cards, with negative values between 1 and 10. Coruscant Shift also utilizes the zero-value sylops.




The object of the game is to get as close to the numerical value on the rolled dice as possible. The other dice, with the staves, is irrelevant unless needed for a tiebreaker, in terms of which player has the most cards of that same stave in their hand. The number of rounds is the same as the number of players participating, and once every player has had a chance to be the dealer, then the game ends. Positive cards add up together, and negative cards add up to more negatives. Whoever is closest to the number on the dice at the end of the game wins.

Gameplay
          

The first player to be designated as the dealer shuffles the deck and deals each player five cards. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile, while a space is left beside it for the Discard Pile. The dealer then rolls the dice and determines both the number to add up to and the tiebreaker stave, beginning the game. Each player looks at their cards and has the choice to discard as many or as few as they would like. Whichever cards are kept in the first round, however, cannot be discarded for the rest of the game.




Once every player&#39;s decision on discarding has been made, the player to the left of the original dealer becomes the next round&#39;s dealer. They distribute each player the same amount of cards they have just discarded, bringing everyone&#39;s hands back to five cards. The cycle continues until every player has been the dealer, and all players have the chance to fold at any point during these rounds of discarding.



If players are placing bets during Coruscant Shift, a betting round will take place directly after each discarding round, just before the players receive their new cards.




At the end of the game, all players reveal their hands. The player closest to the numerical value on the dice wins. In the event of a tie, the player with both the numerical value on the dice and the most cards of the same stave as the stave dice wins. If there is still a tie at this point, each player draws a card from the Draw Pile, and the player whose singular card is closest to the numerical value on the dice wins. If both cards are the same distance from the numerical value, the positive value card wins.




Corellian Spike and Coruscant Shift are just two of the many variations of sabacc, but they&#39;re wonderfully engaging in their own right. Corellian Spike decks are available at Disney&#39;s Star Wars: Galaxy&#39;s Edge and other retailers, but Coruscant Shift is unfortunately much more difficult to find after the closure of the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser. With enough determination, however, Star Wars viewers can figure out exactly how to play, even with a regular deck of cards.
