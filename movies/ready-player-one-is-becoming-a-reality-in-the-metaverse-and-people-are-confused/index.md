## Literature Review

A version of the OASIS virtual reality world from Ready Player One is coming to real life, leaving many fans perplexed by the prospect.




Ready Player One is coming to real life, and not everyone is on board. The 2011 sci-fi novel, which was adapted into a movie by Steven Spielberg in 2018, follows a young man named Wade Watts who lives in a dystopian America in 2045, where humanity seeks escape from a resource-depleted planet via a virtual reality platform called the OASIS. OASIS is a place where users can create their own worlds, many of which are inspired by popular movies and video games from the 1980s.




Per Variety, the company Futureverse announced that the newly formed Readyverse Studios (co-founded by Ready Player One author Ernest Cline and producer Dan Farah) is partnering with Warner Bros. Discovery to bring a version of the OASIS to the metaverse in 2024. While details about the intellectual properties and logistics involved are unknown, the company is describing it as &#34;a multi-world, multi-IP, interoperable open metaverse experience.&#34; However, fans online disagree about whether making the OASIS a reality is a good idea. Check out various social media fan reactions below:


 

RJ Palmer tweeted, &#34;I wish we had a word significantly stronger than &#39;stupid&#39; for these kinds of people.&#34;


 




Shoot the Sh*t concurred, saying, &#34;It’s like making Jurassic Park. Someone clearly missed the dystopian lesson…&#34;


 

Sebastian expressed a similar concern, saying, &#34;Wasn’t Ready Player One a warning??? Lmao.&#34;


 

Erik Davis was less concerned, saying that &#34;as long as I get to drive the DeLorean from Back to the Future, I&#39;m in.&#34;


 




Skyla also shared concerns, saying, &#34;The way no one would play this because it’s so black mirror coded.&#34;


 

hassan was more mixed, saying, &#34;Lowkey dope as hell but did we not learn from the movie tho.&#34;

Socrateej shared a popular meme presenting a script saying &#34;Sci-Fi Author: In my book I invented the Torment Nexus as a cautionary tale, Tech Company: At long last, we have created the Torment Nexus from classic sci-fi novel Don&#39;t Create the Torment Nexus&#34;


 Ready Player One&#39;s OASIS Is Complicated 
          




One possible reason that there is debate over the validity of introducing a version of the OASIS is the fact that its position in the narrative is complicated. Like any potentially dangerous technology, the OASIS is a tool that can be used for both good and evil. Both the book and the Steven Spielberg movie reveal good sides to the OASIS, including a program that allows students to attend school virtually. However, the end of the story includes themes about embracing one&#39;s true identity and fostering interpersonal connections in the real world rather than burying oneself in pop culture.

Despite this underlying theme, Ready Player One also portrays the OASIS as a world full of fun adventures that brings classic pop culture to life in a new way. In the book&#39;s sequel Ready Player Two, this gets even more complicated. The story follows the arrival of new developments that intertwines humanity even closer with technology in ways that the book is less interested in flatly denouncing.



Challenges that Wade must overcome in different versions of Ready Player One include visiting an interactive scene from The Shining and fighting through a real-life version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons module Tomb of Horrors.







Ultimately, this real-life version of Ready Player One likely won&#39;t have the same dangerous potential. Whether users think it challenges the story&#39;s themes on principle, it will be impossible for the books&#39; OASIS to come to life to its fullest extent. For one thing, users won&#39;t have nearly as much access to the world of pop culture as the actual OASIS, given the fact that the company doesn&#39;t have an infinite budget with which to license intellectual property. The metaverse&#39;s technological limitations will also make it less wholly engrossing than the OASIS, though that could always change in the future.
