# Anakin Skywalker s Spinning Lightsaber Flourish Demolished By Genuine Fight Experts


## SUMMARY 



  Anakin Skywalker&#39;s signature spin move with his lightsaber may not be realistic and leaves the user vulnerable to attacks.   The move requires the user to turn their back on their opponent, which is bad fighting practice.   Even with Jedi reflexes, the move is not effective against other skilled Force-users and can put the user at a disadvantage.

## Literature Review

Fight experts have put Anakin Skywalker&#39;s iconic Star Wars lightsaber spin trick to the test, and they found the Jedi move is actually impractical.




Anakin Skywalker is one of Star Wars&#39; most powerful Jedi, and his lightsaber combat skills are no exception; however, YouTube fight experts have revealed that his signature spin move might not be very realistic. The prequel Star Wars trilogy is largely considered to have some of the best lightsaber fight scenes in the whole franchise, from Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul in the infamous &#34;Duel of the Fates&#34; fight in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace to the infamous fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin/Vader on Mustafar in Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. Despite the skills the actors demonstrate in the trilogy, perhaps the most iconic move of them all has been called into question.




Anakin&#39;s behind-the-back twirl with his lightsaber, colloquially referred to as the &#34;Obi-Ani&#34; move, has been a key feature of Anakin&#39;s fighting style ever since its debut, and it&#39;s something that Hayden Christensen evidently developed himself during filming of the prequels. In fact, the move is such a signature of Hayden&#39;s, that Ewan McGregor has comically remarked on his frustration that he can&#39;t do it. There&#39;s no doubt that the move looks cool, but fight experts Shadiversity on YouTube put it to the test, and it turns out, the move may not be effective after all. Although iconic, it seems the move makes the user too vulnerable, especially if their opponent is also Force-sensitive.

 Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Lightsaber Flourish Just Isn&#39;t Practical 
          

Anakin certainly isn&#39;t known for being reasonable, but it&#39;s a shame to realize his classic move, while full of flair, is not necessarily practical. As Shadiversity points out, the move leaves the user exposed unless timed just right, and even then, the biggest flaw of the move is that it necessitates the user turning their back on the person they&#39;re fighting. This is, in general, bad fighting practice, even if there is theoretically a block in the way. As the fight experts show, though, the block isn&#39;t even always effective, which means Anakin is opening himself up to an attack he can&#39;t see and therefore can&#39;t adequately defend against.



 Not Even Jedi Reflexes Make The Lightsaber Flourish Work 
          




Of course, Anakin is not a standard human; he&#39;s a Jedi, a particularly powerful one, equipped with heightened senses and special abilities that enable him to anticipate others&#39; moves and act quickly. The issue is that Anakin is often—as in the fight with Obi-Wan—fighting another Force-user, meaning that they have the same skill set. Particularly with his former master, he&#39;s not only equally matched, but also at a disadvantage, because Obi-Wan has seen this move and is very familiar with his fighting style. Despite that, the Mustafar battle remains one of Star Wars&#39; best, and Anakin&#39;s spin move will always be a beloved staple, impracticality and all.
