## Literature Review

Megatron is Transformers&#39; most iconic villain but he hasn&#39;t been a key antagonist in 17 years. Transformers 8 is the best time to give him a big role.




Megatron is easily the Transformers franchise&#39;s most well-known villain and often their best, but having spent so long without a major role, Transformers 8 is the perfect time to bring him back into the limelight. The film series has naturally explored other antagonists, attempting to branch out beyond its most reliable villain. This proved successful as Transformers became one of the all-time highest-grossing box office franchises, highlighting how popular the movies have been, even without Megatron. Not all the films have been critical successes, but Transformers has become a financial powerhouse and its consistently high box offices suggest the franchise won&#39;t end anytime soon.




Despite this, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts&#39; box office wasn&#39;t the success the studio would have been hoping for. It did manage to profit, but it was far from the same highs that the films were hitting in the 2010s. There have been big breaks between some movies, with Rise of the Beasts coming five years after Bumblebee. This could be a factor in the somewhat low box office, with Scourge not being the same draw as the bigger villains. Since the franchise has hit a bit of a reboot, Transformers 8 is the perfect time for Megatron to return as the main antagonist.


 Megatron Hasn&#39;t Been The Main Villain Of A Transformers Movie Since 2007 
         

Although he has been part of most of the live-action films, Megatron hasn&#39;t been the main Transfomers villain since 2007. Michael Bay&#39;s first Transformers movie introduced Megatron as the biggest threat to Earth and the Decepticon that Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots were trying to stop. His first outing was strong, but his role quickly became reduced. He was still a big part of the second movie, but ultimately, did the bidding of The Fallen. By the time the third movie, Dark of the Moon, came around, he was losing his main villain status to Sentinel Prime, and Megatron was recast for the following Transformers movies.




Not only did this signify a change in the character&#39;s portrayal, but also his relevance. He still had a fairly big presence in Dark of the Moon but was reduced to more of a lackey in the fourth and fifth movies. Megatron transitioned into Galvatron but only played a supporting role to Lockdown and Quintessa. After the franchise headed in a new direction, Megatron did not appear in Bumblebee or Rise of the Beasts. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts cut the Decepticons&#39; role as they were initially supposed to have a scene in the film, which was scrapped. In 17 years, Megatron went from a major villain to not even warranting appearances.



Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is the franchise&#39;s lowest-grossing live-action movie.






 Transformers 8 Is The Perfect Place For Megatron To Return 
          




By the time Transformers 8 releases, it will have been over seven years since Megatron&#39;s last appearance, meaning the next film is the perfect time to bring him back. Both Transformers 8 and 9 have been confirmed, but there has been no official release date announced for the next movie. Enough time has passed now for Megatron&#39;s return to feel like a spectacle worth getting invested in. After five films, having fewer and fewer important roles, Megatron&#39;s presence began to get exhausting. However, having him not only come back to the franchise but also play a major role would be exciting considering his recent absence in the movie series.

Given Rise of the Beasts&#39; box office wasn&#39;t great, Transformers needs something fresh to make audiences enthusiastic once again. Rise of the Beasts also had mixed reviews, showing not only was it not much of a box office hit, but it also didn&#39;t perform well among audiences or critics. The Transformers franchise&#39;s crossover with G.I. Joe will change things up, but the success of this collaboration is far from guaranteed. Bringing back its most iconic villain is the smarter move to make Transformers 8 feel as big as the older films. It could give Megatron a much more imposing role, and he would likely help draw a higher box office.

 Rise Of The Beasts&#39; Sequel Set Up Risks Repeating Previous Megatron Mistakes 
          

Megatron&#39;s return in Transformers 8 would be huge, but Rise of the Beasts&#39; sequel risks repeating previous mistakes. Unicron is a key villain in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and will likely be the main villain going forward. This means a Megatron return would likely result in him being a herald to Unicron, and while he may be more prominent than in previous films, his character would run into the same problems. The story&#39;s direction makes Megatron&#39;s next appearance more difficult, but not impossible. Stepping away from the Unicron plot could allow Megatron another major Transformers villain role before reinforcing Unicron as the big bad of Transformers 9, which would prevent previous Megatron mistakes.
