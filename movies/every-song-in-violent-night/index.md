## Literature Review

Every Christmas song and musical reference in Violent Night, the gruesome festive heist movie starring David Harbour as brutal Santa Claus.




Though it is filled with more bloody violence and R-rated humor than most other Christmas movies, the Violent Night soundtrack is a very festive collection of holiday music, drawing from classic carols and contemporary hits. The songs accompany Santa Claus (David Harbour), as he stumbles into a Christmas Eve robbery. There, he battles his way through a barrage of violent thieves, vowing to rescue a young child, Trudy Lightstone, held hostage inside her father&#39;s family home. The Violent Night soundtrack has a lot of fun adding to the wild style of the movie.




While there are warm, wholesome, and cozy holiday favorites households everywhere like to enjoy each Christmas season, Violent Night has the potential to be a new seasonal favorite. Even with the violence, the movie is a nice yuletide treat that captures the spirit of this time of year and presents its own twisted version. The movie also juxtaposes the bloody mayhem of the action sequences with some cheery and classic Christmas tunes that help to make it a fun Christmas romp.

 When Each Song Plays In Violent Night 
         

&#34;A Holly Jolly Christmas&#34; by Burl Ives - Opening Violent Night, in true Christmas movie fashion, the classic Christmas tune accompanies a slightly drunken Santa Claus sitting in a grimy pub in Bristol, Great Britain. The song continues as David Harbour&#39;s Santa Claus chats with a mall Santa and the bartender, before stumbling out of the tavern.

&#34;Deck The Halls&#34; by Dominic Lewis - The Christmas carol rings out immediately after a drunken Santa Claus vomits off the side of his sleigh and the Violent Night title is displayed. The choir vocals bridge the scene as Trudy&#39;s father, Jason Lightstone is introduced.




&#34;Jingle Bells&#34; by Dominic Lewis - The song can be heard while the family is catching up, sniping at one another, and as Jason reunites with Trudy&#39;s mother, Linda. Trudy later sings the song at Santa&#39;s request to drown out the sound of him caving in the skull of one of Violent Night&#39;s main villains, the blonde female gang member, Candy Cane.

&#34;Shepherdess Dance&#34; by Pyotr Tchaikovsky - The classical piece subtly sits beneath the Lightstone family continuing their dysfunctional reunion. The festive ballet melody is heard as Jason and Linda discuss his sister&#39;s son, Bert, and her partner, Morgan.

&#34;It Came Upon A Midnight Clear&#34; by Michael B. Nelson - The big band rendition of the Christmas carol appears in the background as the foul-mouthed matriarch Gertrude Lightstone arrives at the gathering.

&#34;You and Me and Santa Claus&#34; by Bob Saker &amp; Bill Conner - The song begins just as the Lightstone family sits down for dinner. The song continues through a montage sequence as a slightly inebriated Santa Claus is distributing gifts, sighing in dismay at the pile of Amazon.com boxes nestled beneath a family&#39;s Christmas tree.




&#34;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&#34; by Dominic Lewis - The Christmas tune briefly plays as Santa is eating cookies and drinking brandy after delivering presents in the Lightstone house. The melody is then recalled after Santa is unable to escape back up through the Lightstone&#39;s chimney and contemplates jumping from the window. Deciding against that, he has his first encounter with a mercenary, whom he subsequently knocks out of the window.

&#34;Silent Night&#34; by Frank Sinatra - This song appears momentarily between two scenes as the mercenaries disconnect the family&#39;s Wi-Fi. The Lightstone family is watching Bert live-streaming and Gertrude reminds his mother that she recommended beating him as a child. Mr. Scrooge sings a sinister alteration of the song to threaten the family when his goons first gather everyone into the living room.

&#34;The 12 Days of Christmas&#34; by Dominic Lewis - The famous melody line is swiftly referenced within the score as the mercenaries disguised as staff first reveal themselves and take over the household. The motif is repeated throughout Violent Night, usually accompanying Candy Cane.




&#34;Donde Esta Santa Claus? (Where is Santa Claus?) by Toni Sante - This track provides the backdrop for Santa&#39;s second fight in Violent Night: facing off against the mercenary, Frosty, in the Lightstone&#39;s games room. Santa ultimately stabs the brute with a star-shaped tree-topper, which he plugs in to electrify.

&#34;Christmas Time&#34; by Bryan Adams - This song is the soundtrack to the violent showdown between Santa and the Extraction Team in the Lightstone&#39;s shed. During the brawl, Santa sucks on a candy cane, sharpening it to a point, and uses it to stab several mercenaries.

&#34;Ding Dong Merrily on High&#34; by Dominic Lewis - A choir rendition is woven into the movie&#39;s score, as Santa takes Jesus&#39; manger from the nativity scene. Jason and Linda begin to kiss but are interrupted by an attacking villain.

&#34;Merry Xmas Everybody&#34; by Slade - The song immediately follows Violent Night&#39;s ending, beginning as the closing credits begin to roll.

&#34;Jingo Jango&#34; by Bert Kaempfert - The second song played during the movie&#39;s closing credits, ending the movie with a cheery Christmas classic.
