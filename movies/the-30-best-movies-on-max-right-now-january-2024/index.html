  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The streaming platform Max is home to a variety of movies from all genres and for all ages, including classics, award-winning movies, and a lot more.</p>
<p>In May 2023, HBO Max was rebranded as Max, but it retains the same type of content as HBO Max, with the addition of more Discovery content. Max continues to be one of the most popular streaming services thanks to its variety and for being the assigned home of Warner Bros.’ theatrical releases, but there are also some hidden gems in the platform’s long list of movies that can be easily missed or overlooked. Here are the 30 best movies on Max right now, from a variety of genres for both mature audiences and for the whole family to enjoy.</p>
<p>30 Best TV Shows On Max (January 2024)
Here&rsquo;s a list of the 30 best shows on Max right now, featuring The White Lotus, The Last of Us, Succession, and many other award-winning shows.</p>
<p>Best Horror Movies On Max
Cabin Fever (2003)</p>
<p>Cabin Fever</p>
<p>Release Date    September 12, 2003     Director    Eli Roth     Cast    Joey Kern , Cerina Vincent , Jordan Ladd , James DeBello , Rider Strong     Runtime    93 minutes</p>
<p>2002&rsquo;s Cabin Fever is a masterclass in stomach-turning body horror driven by practical effects. The relatively simple premise sees a group of teens take a trip out to a remote cabin in the woods for a vacation. However, their trip turns deadly not because of a rural serial killer or supernatural monster, but because of an incredibly virulent infectious disease in the local water supply. Within hours, the teens begin to physically decompose, leading to many memorable moments such as when the simple act of shaving leads to one of the most wince-inducing scenes in any horror movie.
Friday The 13th (1980)</p>
<p>Friday the 13th</p>
<p>Release Date    May 9, 1980     Director    Sean S. Cunningham     Cast    Peter Brouwer , Adrienne King , Betsy Palmer , Jeannine Taylor , Kevin Bacon , Robbi Morgan , Harry Crosby     Runtime    95 minutes     Genres    Horror , Mystery , Thriller</p>
<p>One of the films responsible for the slasher movie craze of the 1980s, Friday the 13th centers on a group of teenage camp counselors who are hunted down and murdered by a mysterious killer, who turns out to be Mrs. Pamela Voorhees (Betsy Palmer), a mother seeking revenge after her son Jason (Ari Lehman) drowned at the camp.
While the image of the hockey mask-wearing, machete-wielding Jason Voorhees is most commonly associated with the series, few remember that Jason himself didn&rsquo;t play a huge role in the first Friday the 13th movie. This is a testament to Palmer&rsquo;s terrifying performance that Friday the 13th became the huge franchise it was, with sequels releasing into the 2000s, many of which are also available to stream on Max.
Carrie (1976 &amp; 2013)</p>
<p>Carrie</p>
<p>Release Date    October 18, 2013     Director    Kimberly Peirce     Cast    Judy Greer , Chloe Grace Moretz , Julianne Moore     Runtime    1h 40m</p>
<p>Based on Stephen King&rsquo;s first published novel, Carrie is also the first film adaptation of his work. Dozens of King movie and TV adaptations have followed, but this 1976 movie is one of the best. Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a shy teenager with telekinetic powers who is brutally bullied and victimized by her high school classmates and her religious fanatic mother Margaret (Piper Laurie). When a cruel prank humiliates Carrie, she enacts rage-fueled revenge on her tormentors.
An iconic tale of vengeance, Carrie has received a sequel and two remakes, but none live up to the original. Spacek is note-perfect as the put-upon protagonist, and she and Laurie both received Oscar nominations for their performances. The 2013 remake, which wasn&rsquo;t as successful but still holds up thanks to telling the same chilling Stephen King story, is also available on Max.
The Menu (2022)</p>
<p>The Menu</p>
<p>Release Date    November 18, 2022     Director    Mark Mylod     Cast    Ralph Fiennes , Anya Taylor-Joy , Nicholas Hoult , Hong Chau , Janet McTeer , Reed Birney , Judith Light , John Leguizamo     Runtime    106 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Horror , Thriller</p>
<p>2022 was the year for &ldquo;eat the rich&rdquo; movies, with Glass Onion, Triangle of Sadness, and of course, The Menu. The fiercely funny horror movie takes place at Hawthorn, a high-end, exclusive restaurant located on an island and run by the renowned chef Julian Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). When a group of privileged individuals, including Margot Mills (Anya Taylor-Joy), the date of pompous foodie Tyler Ledford (Nicholas Hoult), arrive to dine at Hawthorn, Slowik informs them that they won&rsquo;t make it out of the restaurant alive.
The movieoffers heart-pounding suspense and uncomfortable laughs from its black humor, and the story is sold by The Menu&rsquo;s stellar cast. Anya Taylor-Joy proves herself to be a true movie star as aloof protagonist Margot, Nicholas Hoult is hilarious as Tyler, and nobody does sinister like Lord Voldemort himself, Ralph Fiennes. Those looking for a whip-smart social satire with more than a few thrills will want to take a big bite out of The Menu.</p>
<p>New On HBO Max: All 129 Movies &amp; TV Shows Arriving In January
With Max bringing in more movies and TV shows every month, there are plenty of originals and classics coming for subscribers in January 2024.</p>
<p>Parasite (2019)</p>
<p>Parasite</p>
<p>Release Date    November 8, 2019     Director    Bong Joon Ho     Cast    Yeo-Jeong Jo , Myeong-hoon Park , Jeong-eun Lee , Sun-kyun Lee , Ji-so Jung , So-dam Park , Keun-rok Park , Kang-ho Song , Ji-hye Lee , Woo-sik Choi , Seo-joon Park , Hye-jin Jang     Runtime    132 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Thriller , Drama</p>
<p>Parasite is a South Korean black comedy thriller directed by Bong Joon-ho. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family, who come up with an elaborate plan to become employed by the wealthy Park family after their son starts working for them. Soon, the Kim family begins to work within the same household (without the Parks knowing they are related), but things get complicated when they start living a parasitic life and make a disturbing discovery inside the luxurious Park home. Parasite is one of the most critically acclaimed films of the decade, and won a slew of awards including an Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director for Bong Joon-ho.
Coraline (2009)</p>
<p>Coraline</p>
<p>Release Date    February 5, 2009     Director    Henry Selick     Cast    Dakota Fanning , Teri Hatcher , Jennifer Saunders , Dawn French , Keith David , John Hodgman     Runtime    100 minutes     Genres    Family , Animation , Thriller , Fantasy , Drama</p>
<p>Some of the creepiest, scariest movies are actually children&rsquo;s films, and those who doubt that sentiment need look no further than Coraline. Coraline is LAIKA studio&rsquo;s first feature film and is based on Neil Gaiman&rsquo;s novella of the same name. The stop-motion animated movie sees the young Coraline (Dakota Fanning) discover an alternate world that&rsquo;s a funhouse mirror version of the life she currently leads, but better. However, things take a dark turn when that world&rsquo;s inhabitants want to keep Coraline there forever.
If the story isn&rsquo;t haunting enough, Coraline&rsquo;s stunning visuals are — the button-eyed doppelgangers in particular are the stuff that nightmares are made of. While Coraline is definitely not for younger kids, older children will get a lot out of the movie, as it treats its audience as smart individuals. The movie isn&rsquo;t loud, noisy, and chaotic, but a slow burn that is worth the payoff.
Ex Machina (2014)</p>
<p>Ex Machina</p>
<p>Release Date    April 10, 2015     Director    Alex Garland     Cast    Alicia Vikander , Domhnall Gleeson , Oscar Isaac , Sonoya Mizuno , Gana Bayarsaikhan , Corey Johnson     Runtime    108 minutes     Genres     Sci-Fi , Drama</p>
<p>Ex Machina is a sci-fi psychological thriller written and directed by Alex Garland in his directorial debut. Ex Machina follows Caleb Smith, a programmer at the search engine company Blue Book, who wins an office contest for a one-week visit to the luxurious but isolated home of the company’s CEO, Nathan Bateman. There, Nathan shares his latest invention with Caleb: a humanoid robot with artificial intelligence named Ava.
Nathan asks Caleb to judge whether Ava is capable of thought and consciousness and whether he can relate to her despite knowing she’s artificial, but it all takes a dark turn as Caleb learns more about Ava and Nathan. What follows is a tense and cerebral sci-fi thriller that poses plenty of philosophical quandaries for the viewer about the nature of sentience and consciousness.</p>
<p>Best Romance Movies On Max
The Breakfast Club (1985)</p>
<p>The Breakfast Club</p>
<p>Release Date    February 15, 1985     Director    John Hughes     Cast    Molly Ringwald , Ally Sheedy , Anthony Michael Hall , Judd Nelson , Emilio Estevez     Runtime    97 minutes</p>
<p>Director John Hughes is a legend when it comes to romance movies, especially coming-of-age stories, and 1985&rsquo;s The Breakfast Club is a textbook study on why he&rsquo;s so highly regarded. The Breakfast Club wrote the blueprint for teen high-school romance comedies. It&rsquo;s especially noteworthy for cementing the idea of various stereotypes and the now-classic tale of the athletic jock falling for the loner, or the preppy aspiring prom queen harboring feelings for the dangerous bad boy (the latter pair portrayed to perfection in The Breakfast Club by Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson).</p>
<p>All 67 Movies &amp; TV Shows Leaving Max This Month
Some great movies and TV shows are leaving the Max streaming library at the end of December, so there is limited time to catch these notable titles.</p>
<p>(500) Days Of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>500 Days of Summer</p>
<p>Release Date    August 7, 2009     Director    Marc Webb     Cast    Zooey Deschanel , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Chloe Grace Moretz , Matthew Gray Gubler , Geoffrey Arend , Clark Gregg     Runtime    95 minutes     Genres    Romance , Comedy , Drama</p>
<p>(500) Days of Summer is so hilarious, sweet, and fun to watch that many viewers don&rsquo;t realize they&rsquo;re watching a scathing critique of problematic romance movie tropes until the credits have rolled. A love-of-at-first-sight story, (500) Days of Summer centers on Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a greeting card writer and hopeless romantic, who falls for the emotionally unavailable Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) when she starts working at his office. From there, the movie chronicles their ultimately doomed romance.
This film is peak casting, as everyone is so busy rooting for Gordon-Levitt, with his &ldquo;aw, shucks&rdquo; charm they don&rsquo;t realize he&rsquo;s a selfish Nice Guy who refuses to listen to the one person he claims to love most. Meanwhile, Deschanel&rsquo;s adorkable charm makes it easy to shoehorn her as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, but that&rsquo;s a role that Summer refuses to play, no matter how much Tom wants her to. (500) Days of Summer was the definition of a sleeper hit upon release, and it&rsquo;s an absolute go-to for any rom-com lover.</p>
<p>Best Action Movies On Max
Robocop (1987)</p>
<p>The entire Robocop trilogy, as well as the 2014 remake, are among the movies available to watch on Max right now in January 2024. While each Robocop movie has something to offer, the 1987 original is still arguably the best. The sci-fi action movie makes great use of the practical effects available in the 1980s, and despite some shots now appearing dated time has given Robocop a certain endearing charm. By now Alex Murphy, the titular cyborg law-enforcer, is an icon of cinema, and his 1987 debut is more than worth revisiting for Max subscribers seeking a classic action movie that manages to not take itself too seriously while also not pulling any punches.
The Good, The Bad And The Ugly (1966)</p>
<p>The Good the Bad and the Ugly</p>
<p>Release Date    December 29, 1967     Director    Sergio Leone     Cast    Aldo Giuffrè , Eli Wallach , Clint Eastwood , Lee Van Cleef , Luigi Pistilli     Runtime    178 minutes</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood is a staple of Spaghetti Westerns, as is Italian director Sergio Leone, and the 1966 Wild West epic The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a key reason why. Eastwood stars as the Man with No Name, reprising his role for the third time in Leone&rsquo;s Dollars trilogy after 1965&rsquo;s For a Few Dollars More. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly encapsulates everything that has made the trilogy so iconic — from Leone&rsquo;s incredibly long-shot landscape shots to Eastwood&rsquo;s borderline-trademark dry delivery — and despite their age, they&rsquo;re still among the best action movies that can be streamed on Max.
Goldfinger (1964)</p>
<p>Goldfinger</p>
<p>Release Date    September 20, 1964     Director    Guy Hamilton     Cast    Sean Connery , Honor Blackman , Gert Fröbe , Shirley Eaton , Tania Mallet , Harold Sakata     Runtime    112 minutes</p>
<p>Goldfinger is aptly named, as it is by and large considered the gold standard of James Bond movies. Sean Connery&rsquo;s third outing as the suave, martini-swilling spy sees 007 investigating gold magnate Auric Goldfinger (Gert Fröbe), uncovering his dastardly plan, and having plenty of adventures, including a run-in with a laser, widely considered to be the most iconic James Bond scene.
Still as entertaining today as it was nearly 50 years ago, Goldfinger has the best of all things Bond — the car (the Aston Martin), the Bond girl (Pussy Galore, played by Honor Blackman), the gadgets, the best villain in Goldfinger, and of course, the best Bond himself, Sean Connery. In other words, Goldfinger is quintessential 007.
Rocky (1976)</p>
<p>Rocky</p>
<p>Release Date    November 21, 1976     Director    John G. Avildsen     Cast    Sylvester Stallone , Talia Shire , Burt Young , Carl Weathers , Burgess Meredith     Runtime    2hr</p>
<p>The sports movie that defines all sports movies, Rocky comes out swinging on Max. Sylvester Stallone famously wrote the script in three days but refused to make the film with anyone but him in the lead role, and cinema history and fans everywhere can agree that was the right decision. The movie centers on the now-legendary Rocky Balboa (Stallone), a down-on-his-luck loanshark debt collector, who gets a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete against famous boxer Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) for the world heavyweight championship.
With its underdog story and theme of pursuing the American Dream, Rocky was a definitive movie in 1970s film culture. Still as inspirational today as it was in 1976, Rocky and all six movies in the original franchise are available for streaming on Max.
The Dark Knight (2008)</p>
<p>The Dark Knight</p>
<p>Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes     Genres    Action , Thriller , Drama , Crime</p>
<p>More of a gritty crime thriller than a comic book movie, The Dark Knight dominated the pop culture landscape upon release, and continues to do so over 15 years later. In the sequel to 2005&rsquo;s Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) teams up with Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Gotham&rsquo;s district attorney, and his ally Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) to face off against the Joker (Heath Ledger), an unhinged villain who worships chaos and seeks to cause destruction wherever he goes.
While the storytelling is taut and thrilling, and the entire cast brings their A-game, what really makes the movie special is Ledger. The villain has been portrayed to death on both the big and small screen, but everything from the Joker&rsquo;s mannerisms to his trademark quotes — &ldquo;Wanna know how I get these scars?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why so serious?&rdquo; — became iconic. Ledger famously and tragically passed away before the release of The Dark Knight, but his legacy lives on, and he won a post-humous Oscar for his performance. The Dark Knight will also be remembered as one of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s best movies.</p>
<p>The Best Comedy Movies On Max
Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb (1964)</p>
<p>Dr. Strangelove</p>
<p>Release Date    January 29, 1964     Cast    George C. Scott , Slim Pickens , Peter Sellers , Keenan Wynn , Sterling Hayden     Runtime    95 minutes</p>
<p>Among the many classic comedies on Max, Stanley Kubrick&rsquo;s political satire Dr. Strangelove stands out both for Peter Sellers performance as three separate characters, and also because its plot of inevitable nuclear armageddon thanks to bungled diplomacy feels worryingly timely. Despite releasing over half a century ago, Dr. Strangelove remains absolutely hilarious, with its humor feeling just as relevant in the 2020s as it did in the 1960s. Dr. Strangelove has maintained a loyal following since its release, and is currently Kubrick&rsquo;s highest rated movie on Rotten Tomatoes. While it didn&rsquo;t win any Academy Awards, it was nominated for best picture, director, actor, and adapted screenplay.
The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</p>
<p>The Devil Wears Prada</p>
<p>Release Date    June 30, 2006     Director    David Frankel     Cast    Anne Hathaway , Stanley Tucci , Meryl Streep     Runtime    109minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama</p>
<p>Anne Hathaway exudes everywoman charm in all of her roles, and in The Devil Wears Prada, she&rsquo;s at the top of her game, going toe to toe — and holding her own — with the legendary Meryl Streep. Based on the Lauren Weisberger best-selling novel of the same name, The Devil Wears Prada sees recent college graduate Andy Sachs (Hathaway) get a coveted job at Runway magazine as a junior assistant to Miranda Priestley (Streep). The only problem is, Miranda is the boss from hell.
Comedies, particularly female-driven comedies, don&rsquo;t get the respect they deserve, but even the Academy Awards, who notoriously favor drama films, had to give Streep her due and nominate her for her unforgettable performance. The Devil Wears Prada was also Emily Blunt&rsquo;s breakout role, as she played the icy co-assistant, Emily Charlton. Throw in a scenery-chewing Stanely Tucci as art director Nigel Kipling, and The Devil Wears Prada is one of the best movies on Max.
Election (1999)</p>
<p>Election</p>
<p>Release Date    April 23, 1999     Director    Alexander Payne     Cast    Reese Witherspoon , Matthew Broderick , Chris Klein     Genres    Comedy</p>
<p>High school politics have never been more cutthroat than in Election, the hilarious 1999 satire film based on the novel of the same name by Tom Perotta. Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick) is a well-liked, seemingly kindhearted high school civics teacher in Omaha, Nebraska who is desperate not to see overachieving student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) win the election for student government president because of a deep-rooted grudge. So, Jim manipulates popular himbo football player Paul Metzler (Chris Klein) to run against her, and chaos ensues.
While Cruel Intentions made her an A-list celebrity, Election saw Witherspoon taken seriously as an actress. She is type-A perfection as Flick and has exquisite enemy chemistry with Broderick, who uses his &ldquo;aw shucks&rdquo; charms as one of cinema&rsquo;s most duplicitous toxic &ldquo;nice guys&rdquo;.
Some Like It Hot (1959)</p>
<p>Some Like It Hot</p>
<p>Release Date    March 15, 1959     Director    Billy Wilder     Cast    Marilyn Monroe , Tony Curtis , Jack Lemmon , George Raft , Pat O&rsquo;Brien , Joe E. Brown     Runtime    121 Minutes</p>
<p>Considered not just one of the best movies on Max but of all time, Some Like It Hot is Hollywood comedy at its finest. It stars Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon as Joe and Jerry, two musicians who witness a mafia crime and disguise themselves as women in an all-female band to hide from the gangsters. But things get complicated when Jerry finds himself the object of Osgood Fielding III&rsquo;s (Joe E. Brown) affection, while Joe is falling for his beautiful bandmate, singer, and ukelele player Sugar &ldquo;Kane&rdquo; Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe).
Some Like It Hot was a smash hit the moment it was released. It went on to receive six Oscar nominations, including a Best Director nod for Billy Wilder and Best Actor for Lemmon, and is considered the quintessential Marilyn Monroe film. No movie is perfect, but Some Like It Hot sure comes close.</p>
<p>The Best Family Movies On Max
Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory (1971)</p>
<p>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</p>
<p>Release Date    June 30, 1971     Director    Mel Stuart     Cast    Jack Albertson , gene wilder , Peter Ostrum , Denise Nickerson , Julie Dawn Cole     Runtime    100 minutes     Genres    Family , Musical , Fantasy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s rare to find a bad Roald Dahl movie adaptation, but Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of the best. Based on Dahl&rsquo;s 1964 children&rsquo;s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the 1971 movie sees the young, poor Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) find one of five Golden Tickets, which gives him the opportunity to tour mysterious candyman Willy Wonka&rsquo;s (Gene Wilder) mystical chocolate factory. With his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), Charlie and the other Golden Ticket holders visit the factory, only for each child guest to be bumped off one by one for various mischievous infractions.
With its colorful visuals, dark yet whimsical story, and a spectacular performance from Gene Wilder as the eccentric Wonka, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has been a formative piece of cinema in many people&rsquo;s childhoods. Dahl famously loathed the adaptation, but viewers young and old still think of it as a work of pure imagination.
Harry Potter And The Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone (2001)</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone</p>
<p>Release Date    November 16, 2001     Director    Chris Columbus     Cast    Daniel Radcliffe , Rupert Grint , Emma Watson , John Cleese , Robbie Coltrane , Warwick Davis , Richard Griffiths , Ian Hart , John Hurt , Alan Rickman , Fiona Shaw , Maggie Smith     Runtime    152 Minutes     Genres    Adventure , Family , Fantasy</p>
<p>The Boy Wizard&rsquo;s debut appearance on the big screen, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone kicked off a massive magical cinematic franchise. Based on the novel by J.K. Rowling, the movie sees Harry Potter experience his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There, he attends classes, befriends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, learns how to play Quidditch, contends with Draco Malfoy and Professor Snape, and experiences the dangers of Lord Voldemort firsthand. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone perfectly captured the magic of the book and set the tone for all Harry Potter movies to come. The entire film series is available on Max, but nothing beats the spectacular first outing.
Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)</p>
<p>The Fantastic Mr. Fox</p>
<p>Release Date    November 13, 2009     Director    Wes Anderson     Cast    George Clooney , Meryl Streep , Jason Schwartzman , Bill Murray , Willem Dafoe , Owen Wilson     Runtime    87minutes     Genres    Family , Comedy</p>
<p>From Matilda to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it&rsquo;s rare to see a bad Roald Dahl movie adaptation, and Fantastic Mr. Fox ranks as one of the best. The stop-motion animated film sees the titular fox protagonist (George Clooney) break a promise to his wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), to stop his thieving ways, and must face the dangerous consequences of his actions. Director Wes Anderson&rsquo;s whimsical sensibilities are perfect for Dahl&rsquo;s wonderfully weird sensibilities, and the A-list voice cast elevates Fantastic Mr. Fox into one of the 21st century&rsquo;s most beloved animated classics.
The Wizard Of Oz (1939)</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz</p>
<p>Release Date    August 25, 1939     Director    Victor Fleming     Cast    Margaret Hamilton , Jack Haley , Judy Garland , Bert Lahr , Ray Bolger     Runtime    102 minutes     Genres    Musical , Fantasy , Family , Adventure</p>
<p>The Wizard of Oz&rsquo;s profound effect on cinema cannot be exaggerated. With its revolutionary use of Technicolor to emphasize the magical world of Oz, its fantastical storyline of a young girl and her dog who just want to get home, and Judy Garland&rsquo;s heartfelt performance of &ldquo;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&rdquo; — not to mention all the other iconic songs in the film — The Wizard of Oz defines what it means to be a cinematic icon. For a movie that is almost 90 years old, The Wizard of Oz still ranks on many &ldquo;best movies of all time&rdquo; lists, and it&rsquo;s not going anywhere anytime soon.
Singin’ in the Rain (1952)</p>
<p>Singin&rsquo; in the Rain</p>
<p>Release Date    April 11, 1952     Director    Stanley Donen , Gene Kelly     Cast    Gene Kelly , Donald O&rsquo;Connor , Debbie Reynolds , Jean Hagen , Millard Mitchell , Cyd Charisse     Runtime    103 Minutes</p>
<p>Singin’ in the Rain is a musical rom-com directed (and choreographed) by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen. Set in the 1920s, Singin’ in the Rain follows Don and Lina, two popular silent film stars whose latest film is remade into a musical. The transition from silent films to “talkies” isn’t easy, and while Don has the voice for the new singing part, the same can’t be said for Lina. Aspiring actress Kathy is hired to record over Lina’s voice, thus saving Lina’s career — but she and Don also fall in love. Singin’ in the Rain is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, and holds a well-deserved 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
<p>All 9 Singin&rsquo; In The Rain Songs, Ranked Worst To Best
Singin’ in the Rain has some of the most joyous and iconic musical numbers in the history of cinema, but only one of them can be the best.</p>
<p>Howl’s Moving Castle (2004)</p>
<p>Howl&rsquo;s Moving Castle</p>
<p>Release Date    November 19, 2004     Director    Hayao Miyazaki     Cast    Chieko Baisho , Takuya Kimura , Akihiro Miwa , Tatsuya Gashûin , Ryûnosuke Kamiki , Mitsunori Isaki     Genres    Animation , Action , Adventure , Family , Fantasy , Romance</p>
<p>Howl’s Moving Castle is a Japanese animated fantasy movie from Studio Ghibli and directed by Hayao Miyasaki, based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Diana Wynne Jones. Set in a kingdom with magic and 19th-century technology, and against the backdrop of a war, Howl’s Moving Castle follows young milliner Sophie, who is cursed by a witch and turned into an elderly woman.
On her quest to find a way to break the curse, Sophie comes across Howl’s moving castle and meets Howl himself, who she soon learns is a wizard caught up in his resistance to fighting for the king. Like almost all Studio Ghibli movies, Howl&rsquo;s Movie Castle is visually spellbinding, and its charming romance narrative stands out as being especially wholesome by the end.</p>
<p>Best Drama Films On Max
2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</p>
<p>2001: A Space Odyssey</p>
<p>Release Date    April 2, 1968     Director    Stanley Kubrick     Cast    Keir Dullea , Gary Lockwood , William Sylvester , Daniel Richter , Leonard Rossiter , Margaret Tyzack     Runtime    149 minutes     Genres    Adventure , Mystery , Sci-Fi</p>
<p>2001: A Space Odyssey is an epic sci-fi film directed by Stanley Kubrick. The discovery of a mysterious monolith on the lunar surface leads the Discovery One and its revolutionary computer, HAL 9000, on a mission to unravel its mysterious origin. When HAL begins to display increasingly strange and controlling behavior, a tense showdown between man and machine begins while traveling through time and space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, as well as a highly influential one thanks to its visual effects and narrative techniques.
Pulp Fiction (1994)</p>
<p>Pulp Fiction</p>
<p>Release Date    October 14, 1994     Director    Quentin Tarantino     Cast    John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Ving Rhames , Samuel L. Jackson , Uma Thurman , Christopher Walken , Tim Roth , Harvey Keitel , Eric Stoltz , Rosanna Arquette     Runtime    154 minutes     Genres    Drama , Crime</p>
<p>Quentin Tarantino&rsquo;s follow-up film after Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction is still considered the director&rsquo;s most definitive work. The film follows four interconnected stories of two hitmen, a boxer, a gangster&rsquo;s wife, and two would-be diner robbers. It&rsquo;s full of what would come to be Tarantino&rsquo;s most famous trademarks, from its non-linear story structure to its graphic violence to its rapid-fire dialogue about mundane topics like hamburgers.
Forever changing independent cinema as it was known, Pulp Fiction made Tarantino an A-list celebrity and breathed new life into John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman&rsquo;s careers. All three actors were nominated for Oscars, and though they didn&rsquo;t win, Tarantino took home the golden statuette for the screenplay.
The Lobster (2015)</p>
<p>the lobster</p>
<p>Release Date    October 16, 2015     Director    Yorgos Lanthimos     Cast    Colin Farrell , Rachel Weisz , Olivia Colman     Runtime    1hr59min</p>
<p>A movie that can only be described as &ldquo;peak Yorgos Lanthimos&rdquo;, The Lobster is one of the auteur director&rsquo;s darkest, funniest, and overall best movies. It&rsquo;s a surrealist black comedy starring Colin Farrell as David, who lives in a dystopian world in which single people are rounded up and forced to stay at a hotel where they must find a romantic mate in 45 days or be turned into an animal of their choice.
Many actors return to work with Lanthimos, including Farrell, who followed up The Lobster with The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and Rachel Weisz, who plays Short-Sighted Woman and would go on to receive an Oscar nomination for Lanthimos&rsquo; The Favourite, and it&rsquo;s easy to see why, as the writer-director&rsquo;s scripts are some of Hollywood&rsquo;s best. The Lobster was indeed nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, and while its bleak sentiments likely polarized the Academy, the movie stands out as one of the best on Max.
Casablanca (1942)</p>
<p>Casablanca</p>
<p>Release Date    November 26, 1942     Director    Michael Curtiz     Cast    Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman , Paul Henreid , Claude Rains , Conrad Veidt , Sydney Greenstreet     Runtime    102 minutes     Genres    Drama , Documentary , Romance , War</p>
<p>Casablanca is a romantic drama movie directed by Michael Curtiz and based on the play Everybody Comes to Rick’s, by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. Casablanca tells the story of American expatriate and nightclub owner Rick Blaine and his former lover Ilsa Lund, who left Rick without explanation years before. Now reunited during the war, Rick finds himself in a difficult position as he has to choose between his love for Ilsa and helping her husband, Victor Laszlo, a Czechoslovak resistance leader, continue his fight against the Germans. Casablanca is widely regarded as among the greatest movies ever made, often facing against Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane for the #1 spot.</p>
<p>Casablanca vs. Citizen Kane: Why &ldquo;The Greatest Movie Ever&rdquo; Debate Is Impossible To Solve
Both Casablanca and Citizen Kane are often called the best movies ever made, but is it possible to know which is really the better of the two?</p>
<p>Barbie (2023)</p>
<p>Barbie</p>
<p>Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Margot Robbie , Ryan Gosling , Simu Liu , Ariana Greenblatt , Helen Mirren , Nicola Coughlan , John Cena , Will Ferrell , Ritu Arya , Michael Cera , America Ferrera , Alexandra Shipp , Kate McKinnon     Rating    PG-13</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to categorize Barbie as a movie — in some ways, it&rsquo;s a fever dream of Barbieland, set piece action and songs. However, it&rsquo;s more than just a riot of pink - it&rsquo;s also an incredible examination of growing up, the pressures of expectations on women, the need to become someone outside of a relationship, toxic masculinity, and the feminism that Barbie dolls were originally created for. Margot Robbie delivers an incredible performance as Barbie, with Ryan Gosling&rsquo;s Ken capturing hearts with his bumbling inability to win her heart. It&rsquo;s a touching, beautiful picture of what it&rsquo;s like to be a woman in the world today, but delivered through a gloriously well-thought-out fantasy world.
Good Will Hunting (1997)</p>
<p>Good Will Hunting</p>
<p>Release Date    January 9, 1998     Director    Gus Van Sant     Cast    Robin Williams , Ben Affleck , Minnie Driver , Matt Damon , Stellan Skarsgård     Runtime    126 minutes     Genres    Romance , Drama</p>
<p>One of the best movies on Max, Good Will Hunting is a psychological drama directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Good Will Hunting follows Will, a mathematics genius who works as a janitor at MIT. When he solves a difficult graduate-level math problem, his talents are discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau, who decides to guide him.
However, when Will is arrested for attacking a police officer and faces an emotional crisis, Lambeau makes a deal to get leniency for him if he gets treatment from therapist Sean Maguire, with whom Will forms a special bond. Good Will Hunting gave Affleck and Damon the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and Robin Williams took home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.</p>
