# Jason Momoa Predicted Aquaman s Biggest DCEU Criticism 6 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is receiving negative reviews, possibly due to a common criticism of the character&#39;s cheesy superpowers.   Jason Momoa expressed concern about making Aquaman &#34;cool&#34; and not a joke back in 2018, but the film still included jokes about his ability to talk to fish.   The future of Aquaman in the DC Universe depends on ensuring the character is taken seriously and not treated as just a comedic side character.

## Literature Review

Jason Momoa has made Aquaman one of DC&#39;s coolest characters, but he predicted a criticism regarding the character before it even started. 




Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is proving to be another critical and commercial flop for the DCEU, and Jason Momoa called out one of its flaws six years ago. Rightfully or not, Aquaman has become something of a joke in the superhero genre. The character is often mocked for his silly outfit in the comics and his unique ability to talk to fish. However, Momoa gave the character a makeover as he infused his cool &#34;bro&#34; aesthetic into the role. Unfortunately, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom hasn&#39;t been a massive hit like the first, and it could be due to a common criticism of the hero.




Still, the character is linked to the underwater world of Atlantis, and the films try to get across his ability to communicate with sea life without making it look too goofy. Momoa tries his hardest to bring his surfer-dude attitude to the mighty hero, but sometimes Aquaman&#39;s cheesy powers overtake the actor&#39;s appealing reputation. The actor was aware of this problem and tried to stop it from happening years ago.

                  10 Reasons Aquaman 2&#39;s Reviews Are So Negative   Reviews for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom have been harsh, citing a flood of problems that make the undersea sequel weaker than the original.   


 Jason Momoa Warned DC About A Major Aquaman Problem In 2018 
         

   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom      Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    James Wan     Cast    Jason Momoa , Amber Heard , Patrick Wilson , Dolph Lundgren , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Temuera Morrison     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    124 Minutes      




Momoa made a small cameo in Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice before officially debuting as Aquaman in 2018&#39;s Justice League. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly from that year, the Fast X actor said he was concerned that Arthur Curry was &#34;too grumpy&#34; in the film as Arthur resisted becoming Aquaman. However, the film still had some jokes at his expense, including Ben Affleck&#39;s Bruce Wayne asking Aquaman if he could talk to fish. According to Momoa, he didn&#39;t want this joke in the film as he believed this would be the only thing audiences would remember.


&#34;When we did that in Justice League, I’m like, “Don’t put this line in there. Because that’s all people are going to say. Do you want me to make him cool or not?”


This isn&#39;t the only time a joke like this has appeared in the DCEU. Something similar pops up in Peacemaker, although it is a more explicit version. While jokes like this can be funny, it diminishes the seriousness of the character and reverts him into the corny comic book hero that is often parodied in shows like The Boys. Despite his best efforts, Momoa couldn&#39;t prevent the DCEU from treating him like a joke, no matter how awesome he was in the role.






 The DCU Needs To Make Aquaman Cool Again 
          

Momoa&#39;s future in the DC Universe could remain alive, but he most likely won&#39;t be playing Aquaman again after Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. However, Peter Safran and James Gunn must ensure that the king of Atlantis is taken seriously in the DCU and isn&#39;t just treated as the guy who can talk to fish. He&#39;s a crucial member of the Justice League, and if they want people to be invested in their characters, then they can&#39;t just be comedic side characters. Fortunately, Gunn has made audiences cry over a talking raccoon, an anthropomorphic tree, and a giant shark, so he should be able to make Aquaman cool.
