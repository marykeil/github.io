## SUMMARY 



  Morgan Freeman&#39;s intervention saved The Shawshank Redemption&#39;s ending from being ruined.

## Literature Review

Although The Shawshank Redemption&#39;s iconic ending might be perfect, the movie&#39;s conclusion was saved by Morgan Freeman changing a pivotal detail.




While The Shawshank Redemption’s ending is famously perfect, the moment could have been ruined if it wasn&#39;t for Morgan Freeman’s intervention. Based on Stephen King’s short story “Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,” director Frank Darabont’s The Shawshank Redemption is frequently singled out as one of the best screen adaptations of the author’s work. Despite King’s fearsome reputation as a horror scribe, The Shawshank Redemption is an atypically uplifting story about a pair of inmates who forge a deep friendship during their lengthy sentences in the eponymous prison. Red and Andy’s bond ensured that what could have been a brutally bleak story became a moving, redemptive tale.




However, The Shawshank Redemption’s perfect ending wasn’t always set in stone. The movie adaptation changed the short story’s original ending, which saw Red hopefully set off to visit Andy but never confirmed whether his friend was still alive and free. By contrast, the movie’s ending saw Red and Andy reuniting on an idyllic beach in Zihuatanejo, proving that Andy’s escape from Shawshank was the start of a joyous new chapter. While this change was generally viewed as an improvement to the source material, it was almost jeopardized by one demand that a star of The Shawshank Redemption wisely opted not to meet.


 Freeman Prevented An Unnecessary Detail During Red &amp; Andy&#39;s Shawshank Redemption Reunion 
          

Despite what was planned by the director, Morgan Freeman refused to play the harmonica in The Shawshank Redemption’s ending. The scene with Red and Andy&#39;s reunion originally included Red playing his harmonica to get Andy’s attention, a touch that Freeman later called “sort of asinine, sort of clichéd, sort of unnecessary” in an interview with the New York Daily News. While Darabont’s later King adaptation, The Mist, was improved immeasurably by the director adding a new twist to the short story’s ending, Freeman was right to balk at this saccharine touch.




Red playing the harmonica during The Shawshank Redemption’s closing scene would have made the happy ending seem too silly and sapped it of its well-earned emotional catharsis. Although the heroes are happy to see each other again, the pair still went through hell together during their lengthy incarceration. As such, Red playfully grabbing Andy’s attention with a harmonica solo would have been too lighthearted and goofy for the ending. The Shawshank Redemption’s conclusion is optimistic, but the final scene still feels in keeping with the tone of the movie, something the harmonica’s presence would have ruined.



 Why Red &amp; Andy&#39;s Reunion In The Shawshank Redemption Is Perfect 
          

In The Shawshank Redemption’s adaptation, Andy and Red reunite with a tearful embrace on an otherwise empty beach in Zihuatanejo. This is a perfect conclusion to the pair’s story, since both men have yearned for the freedom represented by the open ocean since they met. Andy and Red’s wordless embrace says more than any cliché dialogue could, and the swooping views of the endless ocean beside them match perfectly with the uplifting mood. The King adaptation’s final scene is a classic case of a movie’s ending weaving its themes together while providing a satisfying conclusion to the story, making The Shawshank Redemption’s conclusion a classic.
