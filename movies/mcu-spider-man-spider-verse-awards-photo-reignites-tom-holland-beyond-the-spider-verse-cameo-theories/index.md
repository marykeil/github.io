## Literature Review

As MCU star Tom Holland and the Spider-Verse team unite, speculations are sparking about him maybe being in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.




A new photo with the Spider-Verse creatives and Marvel Cinematic Universe actor Tom Holland is once again fueling the theories that his Spider-Man may be in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. The end is near for the Spider-Verse trilogy, as Sony Pictures is actively working on Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, which will wrap up Miles Morales&#39; epic journey. Following the massive success behind Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the world is patiently waiting to get new updates on the threequel.




While the Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse release date may not have been set yet, the trilogy finale is getting new hype thanks to this year&#39;s Critics Choice Awards. During the 2024 event, Holland posed for a photo with the Spider-Verse creative team, as shared by Sony Pictures&#39; official Spider-Verse account on X.


 

The Spider-Verse account praised &#34;Our #SpiderVerse crew with a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man from another, another dimension â€“ Tom Holland!&#34; as well as Greta Lee, who voices Lyla in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. It was also a huge night for the team who worked on Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, as the movie won the Critics Choice Awards for Best Animated Feature.




                  Spider-Verse vs Multiverse: 10 Biggest Differences Explained   The MCU and Sony&#39;s Spider-Verse movies take different approaches to the Marvel multiverse, although both franchises overlap in certain aspects.   


 Why Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man Would Be The Perfect Cameo For Beyond The Spider-Verse 
         

Thanks to Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, the multiverse adventure has set up the idea that animation and live-action can co-exist in the same space and crossover with each other. Given how there was even archival footage from Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire&#39;s Spider-Man movies in the sequel, there is no reason why Holland&#39;s Peter Parker couldn&#39;t show up in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse. In fact, the &#34;Beyond&#34; part in the title has sparked theories for over a year that Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse will be a mixture of live-action and animation.




Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse would be the perfect time for Holland&#39;s Spider-Man to finally take part in Sony&#39;s non-MCU projects. Not only would it be neat to see where he is at after the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home, but the world could finally get Holland&#39;s version of Peter to meet the first cinematic iteration of Miles. Since this may be the last time that the world sees this particular version of Miles Morales, seeing him meeting the MCU&#39;s Spider-Man at least once would be a huge way to finish his trilogy.



Similar to Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, Holland&#39;s Spider-Man 4 movie also doesn&#39;t have a release date yet.




Time will tell how big Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse actively gets to be. However, expectations are definitely higher than ever, given how ambitious Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse managed to be, upping the scale of an already expansive franchise. Hopefully, as 2024 progresses, there will be exciting news for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse soon.
