# Why Spider-Man Has To Make A New Suit At The End of No Way Home


## SUMMARY

The new suit symbolizes the end of Peter&#39;s character arc and his ability to be a hero without relying on Tony Stark&#39;s technology.

## Literature Review

Due to Doctor Strange’s spell and Spider-Man’s character development, Peter Parker had to create a new suit at the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home.




At the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home, audiences got their first look at Peter Parker’s new, homemade Spider-Man suit - immediately raising the question of what led the MCU hero to get a new costume. No Way Home marked the end of Tom Holland’s first Spider-Man trilogy and a new beginning for the character in the MCU timeline. Due to Doctor Strange’s spell, no one remembered Peter at the end of No Way Home. Left with no friends or family, Peter had to become independent and make a fresh start as Spider-Man, including creating a new version of his iconic outfit.




One way No Way Home signaled the beginning of a new era for Spider-Man in the MCU - setting up the story for Spider-Man 4 - was through a new Spider-Man suit. During No Way Home’s final scene, Peter donned his new suit and climbed out his apartment window. A sewing machine and spare fabric were visible on the table behind him, meaning that he had sewn his own suit for the first time since his original one in Captain America: Civil War. As Spider-Man, he swung across the city, showing off his more comic-accurate bright blue and red suit.

Throughout his time in the MCU, Peter had been collecting multiple suits built from Tony Stark’s technology, so he should have had plenty at the ready. Due to Doctor Strange’s spell and Peter’s character development, however, this new suit was actually entirely necessary. The spell not only erased all memories of Peter but may have deleted all records of him as well. Due to this, Stark technology might not have worked for Peter anymore. Like the Iron Man suit, Spider-Man’s suits probably used facial recognition technology. After Doctor Strange’s spell, it&#39;s likely that Peter’s Stark Spider-Man suits would not recognize him. Unable to use any of his earlier suits, Peter had to create his own.

Additionally, creating a new suit marked the end of Peter’s first character arc in the MCU. In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tony Stark told Peter, “If you&#39;re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn&#39;t have it.” Since then, Peter had been working to prove that he was worthy of being Spider-Man and using the suits Tony gave him. However, Peter was always able to rely on Tony, his technology, and other adults. After No Way Home though, Peter had no allies and no technology. However, Peter had learned that he was a hero even without a special Stark suit, so he was able to continue being Spider-Man on his own with his own suit.




Due to this, Peter having to sew a new suit was good for his character. Since Spider-Man joined the MCU, one of the biggest criticisms surrounding his character has been that he was too dependent upon Iron Man. Tony directly or indirectly influenced many of Peter’s decisions, and many viewers believed the MCU was preparing Spider-Man to replace Iron Man, which was reinforced by Spider-Man’s Iron Man-like suits. With his own suit, though, Peter can continue to grow as a hero in ways that better match his comic book counterpart. Although Doctor Strange’s spell forced Peter to need to make a new suit at the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home, the change marked an opportunity to develop his character in new ways.
