## Literature Review

India&#39;s most expensive movie, the sci-fi epic Kalka 2898 AD, gets an official 2024 release date as it looks to continue the country&#39;s global success.




The 2024 release date for Kalki 2898 AD has been officially confirmed. The Indian sci-fi epic, which is set in a futuristic dystopia and was shot simultaneously in Telugu and Hindi, stars Prabhas, Amitabh Bachchan, Kamal Haasan, Deepika Padukone, and Disha Patani. The blockbuster, which boasts a reported budget of roughly $75 million, is the most expensive Indian movie ever made and became the first to ever be presented in Hall H at San Diego Comic-Con.




Per Variety, the upcoming Kalki 2898 AD has set its official worldwide release date. The movie will be arriving in theaters on May 9, 2024. This means it will be debuting on the same weekend as the Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, which recently moved its release date two weeks early to avoid competing with the Mad Max: Fury Road prequel Furiosa.


 Kalki 2898 AD Could Be a Huge Global Smash 
          

While a May release means the movie will premiere slightly before the traditional blockbuster movie season of summer, in recent years, late spring has become a bastion for blockbuster hits. In fact, Kalki 2898 AD will be competing with quite a few major Hollywood properties throughout the month of its release, two of which are also dystopian or dystopian-adjacent sci-fi movies. Check out the movies that have already been slated for wide releases this May:




 Date  Wide Release Debut(s)   May 3, 2024  The Fall Guy   May 10, 2024  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, Back to Black   May 17, 2024  IF   May 24, 2024  The Garfield Movie, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga   



While the initial Kalki 2898 AD trailer has not yet revealed many details about the movie, this release date shows great confidence on the part of the distributors. The epic comes at a time when Indian movies have come to even greater global prominence. The 2022 hit RRR, which became the third highest-grossing Indian movie ever as well as the first to win an Oscar (for Best Original Song), was followed by Pathaan, Jawan, and Animal, a trio of hits that led 2023 to become the first year ever that three Indian movies have grossed over $100 million worldwide.

                  Why You Need To Be Excited For This Upcoming, Record-Breaking $75 Million Indian Sci-Fi Movie   Formerly known as Project K, Kalki 2898-AD is an upcoming big-budget Indian movie that already generated a ton of buzz at San Diego Comic-Con.   




It remains to be seen if Kalki 2898 AD is able to compete with those previous Indian titles. Even if it does, it will have to contend with a crowded slate of Hollywood competitors. However, its unprecedented North American rollout could indicate that it has the power to become a major success, which would be necessary for it to break even, considering its expansive budget.
