# 8 DCEU Post-Credits Teases That Went Absolutely Nowhere (&amp; 2 That Still Matter)


## SUMMARY 


 Over 10 years, the DCEU introduced multiple post-credits scenes. 
 Despite the earliest DCEU movies ignoring credits scene trends, the majority after Snyder&#39;s exit had some form of a stinger 
 Sadly, most of the DCEU post-credits went nowhere. That said, there are still 2 that could influence the rebooted DCU future.

## Literature Review
As the DCEU has officially ended, many of the franchise&#39;s post-credits teases can be confirmed as entirely fruitless, though some may still matter.




With the DCEU having officially ended, it’s clear that the shared universe offered up several post-credits teases that were destined to go nowhere (as well as a couple that may still matter in the DCU). From the beginnings of the DCEU, the franchise proved to be somewhat divisive, with some of the earliest movies of the DCEU, such as Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Justice League all dividing opinions on multiple points. From these early stages, the franchise had its issues, but it continued to lay the groundwork for its future using post-credits scenes written to tease upcoming developments.
The franchise’s untimely end and impending reboot into the DCU renders a great deal of these post-credits teases entirely redundant. The DCEU’s movie timeline being cut short confirms that multiple teased plot points will never be paid off within the franchise, as the DCU will take a new approach to its characters and their stories. However, due to James Gunn’s role as co-head of DC Studios, there are two DCEU teases that could still matter in the DCU. Even so, here are 8 of the DCEU’s post-credits teases that went absolutely nowhere, and two that could still matter.

Post and mid-credits scenes have become a staple of comic book movies, but how do all the DCEU&#39;s post-movie scenes rate in comparison to each other?













 








 10  Went Nowhere: Suicide Squad Sets Up Batman Vs The Suicide Squad 
Batman’s Conversation With Amanda Waller Teased An Unexplored Story


Close







Despite the film being one of the earliest entries into the DCEU, Suicide Squad&#39;s mid-credits scene actually teased a future that never came to pass. In the scene, Bruce Wayne meets with Amanda Waller, who delivers him information regarding Metahumans with whom he intends to form a team. The scene heavily implies that the team will enable Batman to better fight against the villains introduced in the movie, setting up a Batman vs the Suicide Squad storyline. However, this never came to pass in the DCEU, with Batman never directly encountering any iteration of Task Force X.





 9  Went Nowhere: Justice League Set Up The Legion Of Doom 
The DCEU’s Legion Of Doom Could Have Transformed The Franchise
        

2017&#39;s Justice League featured an enticing tease for the DCEU&#39;s future, introducing Deathstroke to the franchise and setting up a Legion of Doom storyline. In the comics, the Legion of Doom is a team of villains led by Lex Luthor, serving as the antithesis of the Justice League. Despite Luthor and Deathstroke meeting to discuss the formation of such a team, the Legion of Doom was never introduced, and Deathstroke failed to make another DCEU appearance. Though the tease was particularly exciting, it ultimately proved fruitless within the franchise.





 8  Went Nowhere: Shazam! Set Up Mr Mind As A Future Villain 
Shazam’s Hilarious Villain Tease Could Have Been Perfect
        

Mister Mind might not be the most traditionally imposing comic book villain, the post-credits scene of 2019’s Shazam! hinted at the character being an antagonist in future DCEU movies. Mister Mind’s status as an important Shazam villain in the comics made the tease all the more intriguing, with it being hinted that Mister Mind would team up with Dr. Sivana in future installments of the film franchise. Unfortunately, the tease came to nothing, and Mister Mind was doomed to never feature prominently in the DCEU.





 7  Went Nowhere: Shazam! Fury Of The Gods Did It Again 
The DCEU Doubly Failed On Its Promise Of Mr Mind
        

After Shazam! teased Mister Mind, it was expected that the villain would appear in the sequel. Though this proved true, it wasn&#39;t as the main antagonist, but rather as the subject of yet another post-credits tease. Shazam! Fury of the Gods&#39; post-credits scene featured Mister Mind yet again, once more teasing the character&#39;s status as a lurking threat and an impending DCEU antagonist. With the official ending of the DCEU, it became clear that both teases were destined never to pay off, with the franchise failing to deliver on two promises of a future movie featuring the villain.





 6  Went Nowhere: ZSJL Set Up The Canceled Sequels 
The Snyder Cut Directly Teased The Continuation Of The Snyderverse
        

Though Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League technically wasn&#39;t released as DCEU canon, the film did feature a post-credits tease that was never fulfilled. The scene in question shows Bruce Wayne meeting the Martian Manhunter, who pledges his support to the Justice League against Darkseid in the future. The scene heavily sets up Snyder&#39;s planned Justice League sequels, introducing a new key hero to the franchise and laying the foundations for further stories requiring the Justice League. The post-credits tease was inconsequential, however, as the Snyderverse had already been scrapped at the time of its release.





 5  Went Nowhere: Black Adam Set Up The Rock Vs Cavill&#39;s Superman 
Black Adam Teased Henry Cavill’s DCEU Future Before He Was Dropped
        

Perhaps the cruelest tease for the DCEU&#39;s future came in Black Adam&#39;s post-credits scene, which set up a clash between the titular anti-hero and Superman within the franchise. The scene saw the long-awaited return of Henry Cavill as the DCEU&#39;s Man of Steel, seemingly confirming his continued place within the franchise. Shortly after Black Adam&#39;s release, it was announced that Cavill would not reprise the role of Superman in future movies and that the DCEU was instead moving in a new direction, meaning that the tease was doomed to go absolutely nowhere.





 4  Went Nowhere: Shazam 2&#39;s New Justice Society Tease 
Fury Of The Gods Set Up An Unseen Superhero Team
        

Shazam! Fury of the Gods came with two post-credits scenes, both offering up separate teases for the DCEU&#39;s future. One saw the return of Emilia Harcourt and John Economos, who appeared to recruit Shazam into the Justice Society. The scene teases Shazam&#39;s induction into the superhero team, which was initially introduced in Black Adam, linking him to his most well-known nemesis from the comics by extension. However, as Fury of the Gods served as one of the last movies released into the DCEU, it&#39;s clear that the tease will ultimately go unfulfilled as the franchise reboots into the DCU.





 3  Went Nowhere: The Flash Teased More Of The New Multiverse Timeline 
Flash And Aquaman&#39;s Exchange Hinted At Further Exploration Of The DCEU&#39;s Multiverse


Close







The Flash introduced the DCEU&#39;s Multiverse, with the eponymous speedster finding himself in an alternate timeline after accidentally entering the Speed Force. The film&#39;s ending sees Barry learn he is actually in another alternate timeline, and its post-credits scene teases that the franchise would continue exploring the idea in future films. Allen describes the differences between timelines to an intoxicated Arthur Curry, offering further exposition for how the franchise might continue its Multiverse narrative. With the DCEU rebooting into the DCU, the exposition seems entirely unnecessary, as it teases a future that is no longer relevant to DC&#39;s movie continuity.





 2  Potentially Still Matters: The Suicide Squad Sets Up Weasel&#39;s Return For 2024 
James Gunn’s Creature Commandos Could See Weasel Reappear In The DCU


Close







James Gunn&#39;s 2021 film The Suicide Squad may well be one of the only DCEU movies to connect to the DCU. One of The Suicide Squad&#39;s post-credits scenes reveals that Weasel survived Task Force X&#39;s ill-fated mission at the beginning of the film. 2024 will see the release of Creature Commandos, one of the first entries into the DCU, and Weasel is confirmed to be appearing. This makes him one of the few characters planned to exist in both continuities, making The Suicide Squad&#39;s post-credits tease still relevant in the DCU.





 1  Potentially Still Matters: Blue Beetle&#39;s Ted Kord Set Up Blue Beetle In The DCU 
Gunn Teased That DCU Canon Could Tie In With Blue Beetle
        

James Gunn described Blue Beetle as the first DCU character, although the 2023 movie&#39;s place in the new franchise&#39;s canon remains unclear. However, Gunn&#39;s tease combined with Blue Beetle&#39;s post-credits scene hints that the franchise may well explore the mystery of Ted Kord&#39;s disappearance and potential return. Whether or not the post-credits tease will actually lead into future DCU stories remains to be seen, but it&#39;s one of a select few DCEU set-ups that could yet still matter.
