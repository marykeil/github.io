Summary

  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s disappointing box office run continues, with a 51% drop in earnings from its opening day, as it falls to second place at the box office.   Aquaman 2 needs to earn $400 million worldwide to break even, a goal that may be challenging if the current trend persists.   The film&#39;s underperformance follows a series of failures by other DCU movies, including Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle.  






Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is only continuing its disappointing box office run. It is the sequel to 2018&#39;s Aquaman, which brought in over $1.1 billion on a budget of approximately $160 million. Lost Kingdom is the last iteration of the original DC Extended Universe and comes in the wake of many movies struggling, including Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle. It had a budget of $205 million.

After a domestic opening weekend that saw Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom earn $27.7 million, the superhero movie appears to have hit a rogue wave. Wonka found its way back to the top of the box office with a $8.6 million take on Friday, while Aquaman 2 brought in only $6.75 million, according to a report by Variety. That is a 51 percent drop from its opening day take. Aquaman 2 needs $400 million worldwide to break even. If the holiday weekend disappointment continues, Aquaman 2 could end up struggling.


 Why Is Aquaman 2 Failing? 
          

Considering how successful the original Aquaman was, the disappointing returns for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom should be a surprise. Instead, the previous DCEU movies set up the movie&#39;s failure. With James Gunn and Peter Safran taking over the universe and planning to reset the DC Universe, the purpose of any movies released after that announcement is questionable. The reset means that the entire purpose of an extended universe has been diminished, which takes away from Aquaman 2&#39;s appeal.

Another challenge has been the middling Aquaman 2 reviews. The movie was released with a record-breaking Rotten Tomatoes score, as it sat below Justice League and all 2023 DCU movies. The current score leaves Aquaman 2 sitting at a 35 percent on the Tomatometer. Audiences enjoy the movie considerably more, as it currently has an 80 percent audience score, which has likely kept the second-weekend drop from dripping below 51 percent.

Aquaman 2 has also become somewhat controversial due to the presence of Amber Heard, who was involved in a legal dispute with actor Johnny Depp in 2022. Depp won a defamation dispute against Heard, who claimed that Depp had been abusing her. Heard did, however, win a countersuit against Depp for defaming her, as well. The controversy spread wildly and impacted how the new movie was marketed. Regardless of how much Heard&#39;s controversy contributed, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is struggling to stay afloat at the box office.



Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is currently only available in theaters. Warner Bros. Discovery has not yet announced a streaming release date.
