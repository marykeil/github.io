  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Star Wars prequel trilogy introduced 11 new planets, brought back two iconic worlds from the original trilogy, and moved another from TV to film.</p>
<p>The Star Wars prequel trilogy featured several planets, both new ones with breathtaking designs and old ones from the original trilogy. George Lucas always strived to bring something new to each of his films, and his team did an outstanding job in the prequel trilogy. From lush green planets to worlds covered with cities and technology, the prequels have the most variety of locations in the entire Star Wars saga. The history of these planets would later be expanded in other Star Wars movies and TV shows, revealing more about the population and their role in the galactic community.
The prequel trilogy also excelled at expanding on the planets of the original Star Wars trilogy. Familiar planets felt new again thanks to new characters, cities, and events that made these locations feel like they really existed. Unlike the original trilogy, where planets usually only made a single appearance, many of the worlds introduced in the prequels became recurring locations that the audience became more invested in over time. The Star Wars prequel trilogy included 14 planets that expanded the galaxy and demonstrated Lucas&rsquo; mastery of worldbuilding.</p>

All 18 Planets In The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy Explained
The Star Wars Sequels don&rsquo;t revisit a lot of planets, instead it&rsquo;s mostly new ones. This is every planet visited in the sequel trilogy, explained.</p>
<p>14  Naboo
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Location   Mid Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Return of the Jedi (Special Edition) and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. <br>
Naboo was the first planet to appear in the prequel trilogy and was the setting for most of the action in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. A lush world of green fields and shimmering lakes, Naboo&rsquo;s surface was controlled by humans who lived in beautifully designed cities, while the native Gungans dwelled in underwater domes and the woodlands. A democratically elected monarch governed the Naboo, with some like Queen Padmé Amidala serving as young as 14. A High Council governed the Gungans under the leadership of a chief known as a Boss, and for many years, they avoided who they considered the arrogant and ignorant Naboo.
Senator Palpatine was from Naboo, using his homeworld to stage a crisis that would lead to him becoming Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. In his guise as Darth Sidious, Palpatine manipulated the Trade Federation into launching an invasion of Naboo, forcing the Queen to flee before returning to seek the aid of the Gungans. Although the combined forces of the Jedi, the Naboo, and the Gungans defeated the droid army and killed Palpatine&rsquo;s apprentice, Darth Maul, the conflict convinced the Republic Senate to make him Supreme Chancellor. Following the rise of the Empire, Padmé&rsquo;s funeral was held on Naboo.
Although created for the prequels, Naboo first appeared in the 1997 special edition of Return of the Jedi, which showed the planet&rsquo;s populace celebrating the fall of the Empire. This was a fitting change since Naboo played a crucial role in events that led to the fall of the Jedi and the Republic. It went on to appear in every film of the prequel trilogy as well as Star Wars: The Clone Wars, plus a brief scene in Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi.</p>
<p>13  Tatooine
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   A New Hope, Return of the Jedi, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Star Wars: The Clone Wars (Movie). <br>
On top of featuring several new planets, The Phantom Menace brought back Tatooine from the original Star Wars trilogy, this time focusing on the larger city of Mos Espa. Qui-Gon Jinn aptly described Tatooine as &ldquo;Moisture farms, for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those that don&rsquo;t wish to be found.&rdquo; The planet was home to the native Tusken Raiders, known to the locals as &ldquo;Sand People,&rdquo; who lived out in the desert and didn&rsquo;t hesitate to attack those who trespassed in their territory. The Jawas, meanwhile, made a living by scavenging for droids and other stolen parts.
After escaping Naboo, Qui-Gon&rsquo;s group met a young slave named Anakin Skywalker, who entered a podrace to earn money to fix their ship. Although Qui-Gon freed Anakin and took him to the Jedi Temple, he could not free his mother, which would haunt Anakin for years. He returned to Tatooine 10 years later to save her from the Tuskens, only for her to die in his arms, causing him to give in to the dark side and wipe out the entire village. Anakin swore never to return to Tatooine if he could help it, making it the perfect place for Obi-Wan Kenobi to hide Luke Skywalker from the Sith.
Not only was it the first planet introduced, but Tatooine has since become one of the most revisited worlds in Star Wars, appearing in almost every movie and TV show. It was revealed to be the center of Jabba the Hutt&rsquo;s criminal Empire, and the fallout from his death was expanded in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. The animated Star Wars shows have briefly featured Tatooine, forcing Anakin to return to his homeworld while Obi-Wan and Darth Maul had one last showdown in the desert. Rey visited Luke&rsquo;s childhood home in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker to bury the Skywalker lightsabers.</p>
<p>12  Coruscant
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Core Worlds    Other Key Appearances   Return of the Jedi (Special Edition), Andor, Star Wars: The Clone Wars, and Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi. <br>
Coruscant was the third planet to appear in The Phantom Menace and became the central location of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Coruscant was the capital of the Galactic Republic and later the Galactic Empire, housing the Senate with representatives from all over the galaxy. It was also the headquarters of the Jedi Order, the location of the Jedi Temple where the High Council convened and younglings trained to become Padawan learners. The entire planet was one big city with almost every inch covered in buildings and containing hundreds of levels beneath the surface.
Like Naboo, Coruscant first appeared in the 1997 Special Edition of Return of the Jedi, where its populace celebrated the Empire&rsquo;s defeat by tearing down a statue of Palpatine. Hosnian Prime became the New Republic capital in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, although Colin Trevorrow used Coruscant as the First Order capital in his canceled treatment for Episode IX. Coruscant has made further appearances in the TV shows, showing the fall of the Old Republic in The Clone Wars, the birth of the rebellion in Andor, and the early days of the New Republic in The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>11  Kamino
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Location   Wild Space    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch. <br>
Kamino was the birthplace of the Clone Army, discovered by Obi-Wan Kenobi while investigating the attempted assassination of Padmé. It was an ocean world where the storms rarely stopped, forcing the native Kaminoans to construct vast indoor cities above the waves. They bred millions of clone soldiers for the Republic, and while they claimed to have been hired by Jedi Master Sifo Dyas, Count Dooku was secretly behind the army&rsquo;s creation. Obi-Wan followed Jango Fett from Kamino to question him about the clones, but the bounty hunter was killed before he could reveal who was responsible.
Although Kamino was one of the Republic&rsquo;s most heavily guarded locations during the Clone Wars, things changed after the rise of the Empire. Admiral Tarkin believed that conscripted soldiers would be a far more cost-effective means of maintaining order, seeing no reason to pay for clones engineered for war. This led to an eventual falling out with the Kaminoans, and the Empire transferred cloning equipment to Mount Tantiss before destroying Kamino&rsquo;s facilities.</p>
<p>10  Geonosis
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels. <br>
Geonosis was the second desert planet in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, though more red and rocky than Tatooine. The native Geonosians were insect-like creatures who lived in catacombs beneath the surface, where they specialized in building droids and other weapons. Obi-Wan&rsquo;s investigation led him to these secret droid factories and the Separatist Council as they agreed to pool their resources to fight the Republic. After Anakin and Padmé were captured while trying to rescue Obi-Wan, Mace Windu led a Jedi strike team while Yoda took command of the clone army, leading to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars.
The Geonosians eventually regained control of the planet, resulting in the Second Battle of Geonosis in The Clone Wars season 2. Archduke Poggle the Lesser was captured and recruited by Orson Krennic to help construct the first Death Star, which the Geonosians had designed. The Geonosians spent years building the Death Star for the Empire, but their planet was sterilized after they had outlived their usefulness.</p>
<p>9  Utapau
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   &ldquo;Crystal Crisis on Utapau&rdquo; story reels (canceled arc of Star Wars: The Clone Wars). <br>
The people of Utapau lived in sinkholes stretching beneath the planet&rsquo;s surface, which also served as a perfect hiding place for General Grievous near the end of the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan engaged Grievous in a lightsaber duel before the clone army arrived, leading to a chase that culminated in Grievous&rsquo; death. Although the Separatist command structure collapsed, the planet soon fell under the control of the newly formed Empire. Utapau also appeared in the &ldquo;Crystal Crisis on Utapau&rdquo; story reels, based on a canceled four-episode arc of The Clone Wars where Obi-Wan and Anakin stopped Grievous from obtaining a giant kyber crystal.</p>
<p>8  Kashyyyk
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Mid Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Bad Batch and the Star Wars Holiday Special (first appearance). <br>
Kashyyyk was the Wookiee homeworld, covered with giant wroshyr trees where the Wookiees made their homes. Master Yoda had good relations with the Wookiees and volunteered to command the Republic forces against the Separatist invasion. When Yoda&rsquo;s clone troopers tried to kill him during Order 66, Chieftain Tarfful and Chewbacca helped him escape as the newly formed Empire took control of the planet. As the Empire grew in power, the Wookiees were gradually herded into prison camps or sent off-world as slave labor until Chewbacca and Han Solo led a group of rebels to free Kashyyyk after Return of the Jedi.</p>
<p>7  Mygeeto
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: Kanan by Greg Weisman and Pepe Larraz. <br>
Mygeeto was a crystalline planet with cold weather and large cities constructed above the rocky terrain. It was the homeworld of the Lurmen species, many of whom left to colonize Maridun to escape the Clone Wars and adopt a pacifist philosophy. Mygeeto was aligned with the Separatists during the war and became the site of four major battles, with the Fourth Battle of Mygeeto ending in a Republic victory. However, Jedi Master Ki-Adi Mundi was killed when his clone troopers turned on him during Order 66, securing Mygeeto for the Empire. Mygeeto later became a hotly contested battleground in the Galactic Civil War, fought between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance.</p>
<p>6  Felucia
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars <br>
Felucia was another hotly contested planet during the Clone Wars for its strategic position along the Perlemian Trade Route. It was a vibrant jungle planet that specialized in agricultural export but often fell prey to pirate attacks, one of which was thwarted with the aid of Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Ahsoka Tano. Jedi Master Aayla Secura led her clone troopers at Felucia during the Outer Rim Sieges at the end of the war, but she was killed along with most of the Jedi during Order 66.</p>
<p>5  Cato Neimoidia
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Colonies    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Brotherhood by Mike Chen <br>
Cato Neimoidia was a wealthy Neimoidian planet and the headquarters of the Trade Federation, although the world tried to remain neutral during the Clone Wars. Obi-Wan and Anakin had their first encounter with Sith assassin Asajj Ventress on Cato Neimoidia, where Anakin claimed to have saved Obi-Wan during the mission, although Obi-Wan felt that their &ldquo;&hellip;business on Cato Neimoidia doesn&rsquo;t&hellip; doesn&rsquo;t count.&rdquo; Jedi Master Plo Koon led a clone squadron on Cato Neimoidia during the final days of the Clone Wars and was shot down after Palpatine issued Order 66.</p>
<p>4  Saleucami
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: The Bad Batch. <br>
Saleucami became a haven for settlers who wished to stay out of the Clone Wars, but the conflict reached the planet nonetheless. Clone Captain Rex was injured during a search for Grievous and taken in by local farmers, where he discovered a clone deserter named Cut Lawquane, who had fled the war shortly after the Battle of Geonosis. Jedi Master Stass Allie led a successful Republic invasion of Saleucami during the Outer Rim Sieges, but her speeder was shot down during Order 66. Shortly after the rise of the Empire, Cut was visited by the Bad Batch after they deserted the Empire, and the group worked together to escape Saleucami.</p>
<p>3  Mustafar
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. <br>
Mustafar was a volcanic world under the control of the Techno Union and also the headquarters of the Black Sun crime syndicate. Anakin and Ahsoka visited Mustafar during the Clone Wars to rescue kidnapped Jedi infants, neither knowing the pivotal role the planet would play in the future. The Separatist Council members sought refuge on Mustafar but were executed by the newly anointed Darth Vader, bringing an official end to the conflict. Obi-Wan confronted Anakin on Mustafar and fought his old Padawan, ending with Anakin being critically injured and forced to wear a suit of armor to survive.
After the war, Vader constructed his fortress over the ruins of an ancient Sith Temple, and Mustafar became known as a world where Jedi went to die. The native population, however, resisted Imperial rule and launched several attacks on Fortress Vader, though most of their efforts were unsuccessful. Following Vader&rsquo;s death and the fall of the Empire, Mustafar&rsquo;s ecosystem began to heal, and a group of pilgrims planted a forest of irontrees near the ruins of Fortress Vader. However, Kylo Ren arrived on Mustafar in 35 ABY seeking Vader&rsquo;s Sith Wayfinder and slaughtered the pilgrims guarding the ruins.</p>
<p>2  Polis Massa
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Location   Outer Rim Territories    Other Key Appearances   Star Wars: Darth Vader (2020) by Greg Pak <br>
Although technically a planetoid in an asteroid field, Polis Massa was a crucial location in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. As a safe haven for surviving Jedi after Order 66, Obi-Wan brought Padmé to the medical facilities following his duel with Anakin, where she gave birth to twins Luke and Leia before dying. Polis Massa was at one point a base for the Rebel Alliance, and Vader visited the facility where Padmé gave birth during his quest for vengeance against those who hid Luke from him.</p>
<p>1  Alderaan
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Location   Core Worlds    Other Key Appearances   A New Hope and Obi-Wan Kenobi. <br>
Alderaan first appeared in A New Hope, but the planet&rsquo;s surface was shown for the first time at the end of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Senator Bail Organa and his wife, Queen Breha Organa, took in Leia and hid from the Sith, raising her to become a princess, senator, and leader in the Rebel Alliance. Alderaan became the first planet destroyed by the Death Star, causing a great disturbance in the Force that Obi-Wan could feel from lightyears away. While it only appeared briefly, Alderaan was one of the most beautiful planets featured in the Star Wars prequel trilogy.
The Star Wars prequel trilogy is available to stream on Disney+.</p>
