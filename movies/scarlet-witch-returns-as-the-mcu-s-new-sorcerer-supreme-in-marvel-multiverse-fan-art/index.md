## Literature Review

The Scarlet Witch has been imagined as the MCU&#39;s new Sorcerer Supreme in brilliant fan art that explores Marvel Studios&#39; vast multiverse.




A powerful multiversal variant of the Scarlet Witch has been depicted as the new Sorcerer Supreme in brilliant MCU fan art. Elizabeth Olsen has been a cornerstone of the MCU since her debut in the post-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but Phase 4 marked a huge change for the mystical hero. Despite being depicted as a hero for most of her MCU career, Wanda Maximoff embraced her identity as the Scarlet Witch in WandaVision and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. While Multiverse of Madness marked the end of her live-action journey, alternate variants of the Scarlet Witch have been introduced in Marvel Studios&#39; What If...?.




While variants such as a powerful zombified Scarlet Witch and a Merlin-inspired iteration have been seen in What If...? seasons 1 and 2, a brand-new version of the powerful witch has been depicted in exciting MCU fan art shared by Skaiwitch.


 

The art imagines the Scarlet Witch in Doctor Strange&#39;s MCU costume, fit with the Cloak of Levitation, the Eye of Agamotto and the dangerous Darkhold, which made its first appearance under the possession of Agatha Harkness in WandaVision. Both Wanda Maximoff and Doctor Strange are masters of magic in the MCU, so combining these formidable heroes would be the perfect basis for a multiversal variant in the MCU&#39;s future.

                  Marvel Sets Up Scarlet Witch&#39;s Return In MCU Multiverse 1 Year After Her Death   Scarlet Witch&#39;s return in What If...? season 2 is a reminder that the MCU can bring back Elizabeth Olsen&#39;s Wanda Maximoff sooner rather than later.   





 If And When Scarlet Witch Can Return To The MCU? 
         

At the end of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Wanda Maximoff&#39;s Scarlet Witch sacrificed herself after learning the error of her ways. Using her Chaos Magic, Wanda destroyed the castle on Mount Wundagore, which in turn destroyed every version of the Darkhold across the multiverse. This final act of redemption seemed to mark the end of her MCU journey, though a well-timed flash of red light led many to speculate on the Scarlet Witch&#39;s survival. While the result of Wanda Maximoff&#39;s Multiverse of Madness sacrifice had been unclear, the Marvel Studios&#39; Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline book all but confirmed that the Scarlet Witch is indeed dead.

Since then, Elizabeth Olsen has revealed that she is not contracted to appear in any future MCU projects, and is enjoying a break from portraying the Scarlet Witch, giving her the opportunity to expand her acting repertoire. Despite this, there has been speculation that Elizabeth Olsen will return as the Scarlet Witch in the MCU&#39;s upcoming Agatha: Darkhold Diaries, WandaVision&#39;s first spinoff in 2024, and this has been teased by members of Agatha: Darkhold Diaries&#39; cast, but not confirmed by Marvel Studios or Olsen. The Scarlet Witch will likely return to the MCU at some point, perhaps for Doctor Strange 3 or Avengers: Secret Wars, but only time will tell.
