  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Tim Burton&rsquo;s distinctive style has been imitated and parodied countless times due to its recognizable elements, such as stop-motion creatures and outcast narratives.
Despite not directing them, Burton&rsquo;s name is often used in promotion for movies or shows he produces, leading to confusion about his involvement.
Other films, like
Coraline
and

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Tim Burton has one of the most distinctive styles of any major Hollywood filmmaker, and these movies are often mistaken as part of his filmography.</p>
<p>Summary
Tim Burton&rsquo;s distinctive style has been imitated and parodied countless times due to its recognizable elements, such as stop-motion creatures and outcast narratives.
Despite not directing them, Burton&rsquo;s name is often used in promotion for movies or shows he produces, leading to confusion about his involvement.
Other films, like
Coraline
and
ParaNorman
, are often mistaken for Tim Burton films due to their spooky stop-motion style, but they were actually directed by Henry Selick and Sam Fell, respectively.</p>
<p>Blending German expressionism with the pulpy macabre, Tim Burton has one of the most distinctive styles of any major Hollywood director, so much so that many films with similar tones are often mistaken for his. Along with Wes Anderson, Burton has a style that is so recognizable that it has been mimicked and parodied countless times. Stop-motion creatures, black and white stripes, old horror actors, and outcast narratives are all hallmarks of a Tim Burton movie, but other filmmakers have made brilliant use these elements as well.
Often, when Burton serves as a producer on a project, the studio uses his name to advertise the movie or show. For instance, Netflix&rsquo;s Wednesday TV show has been heavily associated with Burton despite the fact that he isn&rsquo;t the showrunner, rather serving as an executive producer on the series and director on four episodes. Similarly, movies plastering his name for promotion mixed with elements of his trademark style have led to confusion about who directed the film. Other movies with no involvement from Burton, but share themes and styles, are also often mistakenly credited to the director, as he is such a recognizable name among moviegoers.</p>

<p>9  The Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)
Directed By Henry Selick</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The Nightmare Before Christmas</p>
<p>Release Date   October 29, 1993    Director   Henry Selick    Cast   Catherine O&rsquo;Hara , Glenn Shadix , Ken Page , William Hickey , Chris Sarandon , Paul Reubens , Danny Elfman    Rating   PG    Runtime   76 minutes    Writers   Caroline Thompson    Studio(s)   Touchstone Pictures , Skellington Productions</p>
<p>It is understandable how this animated holiday classic became commonly mistaken for a Tim Burton film, as the filmmaker&rsquo;s name appears above the title. Tim Burton&rsquo;s The Nightmare Before Christmas is based on a poem and character designs the director came up with, but Burton did not serve as the film&rsquo;s director. The movie is credited to Burton in the same way The Lorax is to Dr. Seuss. Animation legend Henry Selick actually directed the film, while Burton served as a producer who still had an important role in the movie&rsquo;s production. Despite being the film that perfected Burton’s iconic animated style, it was Selick and his animators that made The Nightmare Before Christmas a holiday classic.</p>
<p>8  Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016)
Directed By James Bobin</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>After leading Alice in Wonderland (2010) to a billion-dollar smash hit, Tim Burton did not return to direct the 2016 sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass, instead having The Muppets director James Bobin replace him. As a direct sequel to Burton&rsquo;s dark reimagining of the classic Disney film, Alice Through the Looking Glass tries to retain the signature Burton style in its world and design. While Bobin does try to inflect his voice and style, the film was still greatly associated with the Tim Burton name as he stayed on as a producer, and most audience members assumed the director returned for the sequel.</p>

<p>7  Coraline (2009)
Directed By Henry Selick</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Coraline</p>
<p>Release Date   February 5, 2009    Director   Henry Selick    Cast   Dakota Fanning , Teri Hatcher , Jennifer Saunders , Dawn French , Keith David , John Hodgman    Rating   PG    Writers   Henry Selick , Neil Gaiman    Studio(s)   Focus Features</p>
<p>Despite having only directed two stop-motion animated films, Corpse Bride and Frankenweenie, Burton is forever tied to the art form. Laika Studios&rsquo; first feature-length film, Coraline, had zero involvement from Tim Burton, but as a stop-motion film about a darkly mystical other world, it is commonly mistaken for one of his creations. It doesn&rsquo;t help that the 2009 film was marketed as &ldquo;From the director of The Nightmare Before Christmas,&rdquo; and many ordinary moviegoers don&rsquo;t know who Henry Selick is or that he was the true director of A Nightmare Before Christmas.</p>
<p>6  The Addams Family (1991)
Directed By Barry Sonnenfeld</p>
<p>The Addams Family (1991)</p>
<p>Release Date   November 22, 1991    Director   Barry Sonnenfeld    Cast   Anjelica Huston , Raul Julia , Christopher Lloyd , Christina Ricci , Jimmy Workman , Judith Malina , Carel Struycken , Christopher Hart , John Franklin    Rating   PG-13    Writers   Caroline Thompson , Larry Wilson    Studio(s)   Paramount Pictures , Scott Rudin Productions</p>
<p>No IP feels more suited to Burton&rsquo;s sensibilities than The Addams Family, and Barry Sonnefeld&rsquo;s modern 1991 reimagining of the spooky family was released just as Burton was becoming a major director in Hollywood. Burton was offered the chance to direct The Addams Family, but he turned it down, feeling that he was too obvious of a pick for the project while also being busy working on Batman Returns (1992). Consequently, Barry Sonnenfeld, director of the Men in Black movies, took over the film. However, two decades later, Burton did step into the world of The Addams Family with the Netflix show Wednesday.</p>
<p>5  ParaNorman (2012)
Directed By Chris Butler &amp; Sam Fell</p>
<p>paranorman</p>
<p>Release Date   September 13, 2012    Director   Sam Fell    Cast   Anna Kendrick , Kodi Smit-McPhee    Runtime   93minutes    Studio(s)   Universal Pictures</p>
<p>Much like Coraline, ParaNorman is often mistaken as a Tim Burton film, solely for being a spooky stop-motion film. However, this time, instead of Henry Selick being mistaken for Burton, it was the directing team of Sam Fell and Chris Butler. Fell is a long-time animation director, having directed films like Flushed Away and, more recently, Netflix&rsquo;s sequel Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget. Meanwhile, Butler is part of the team at Laika, having also directed Missing Link. While the 2012 film deals with the afterlife in a fun and inventive way, ParaNorman is very different from anything Burton has ever made and is an underrated children&rsquo;s film.</p>
<p>4  Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s A Series Of Unfortunate Events (2004)
Directed By Brad Silberling</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Daniel Handler, under the pseudonym Lemony Snicket, created a worldwide sensation with his children&rsquo;s book franchise A Series of Unfortunate Events. The dark twisted saga of the Baudelaire children is another property that seemed destined to land in the hands of Tim Burton, but the film was instead directed by Brad Silberling, best known for Casper, City of Angles, and Land of the Lost. Silberling doubtlessly used Burton as inspiration for his adaption, and production designer Rick Heinrichs, a common collaborator of Burton&rsquo;s, also worked on the film.</p>

<p>3  9 (2009)
Directed By Shane Acker</p>
<p>Tim Burton served as producer on this dystopian animated film, and despite being CG animated instead of stop-motion, the film still has visual similarities to Burton&rsquo;s style. A box office failure upon release, 9 has garnered a small cult following, and a reputation for scaring younger viewers who found the film more intense than the plushy main characters would indicate. 9 is the only film from director Shane Acker, as the filmmaker was primarily a visual effects worker before crafting his singular and wholly unique vision.</p>
<p>2  Maleficent (2014)
Directed By Robert Stormberg</p>
<p>Maleficent</p>
<p>Release Date   May 30, 2014    Director   Robert Stromberg    Cast   Sam Riley , Sharlto Copley , Elle Fanning , Juno Temple , Angelina Jolie , Imelda Staunton    Rating   PG    Writers   John Lee Hancock , Linda Woolverton    Distributor(s)   Disney</p>
<p>After the runaway success of Alice in Wonderland, Disney went full steam ahead with the reimagining of their classic animated films, a trend still being felt today with live-action remakes like The Little Mermaid. Their immediate follow-up, Maleficent, feels the most indebted to Burton&rsquo;s Alice, as it chooses to be a dark twist on Sleeping Beauty instead of a direct remake. Robert Stormberg, the production designer of Alice in Wonderland, made his feature debut with Maleficent, giving the film a visual style very similar to that of later period Burton, and the film successfully, for better or worse, recreated that look.</p>
<p>1  James And The Giant Peach (1996)
Directed By Henry Selick</p>
<p>Despite making some of the most successful and iconic stop-motion films of all time, Henry Selick&rsquo;s movies often rest in the shadow of Burton, and James and the Giant Peach is no exception. Made immediately after The Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton re-teamed as a producer for Selick on James and the Giant Peach. However, the film led to a falling out between the two artists, as Tim Burton would take animators off the project to work on his live-action film Mars Attacks. It is a shame that Selick doesn&rsquo;t get more distinct credit among the masses, as his skills as an animator make the film soar.</p>
