## Literature Review

Work on Warner Bros&#39; Bride of Frankenstein remake continues, as the cast expands with a the addition of a four-time Oscar nominee ahead of filming.




Warner Bros.&#39; Bride of Frankenstein remake receives a huge news update, as a celebrated Oscar nominee joins the cast and an estimated start date for filming has been revealed. The movie is a remake of the 1935 Universal Monsters movie directed by James Whale which saw Henry Frankenstein (Colin Clive) survive to build a second patchwork being as a mate for Boris Karloff&#39;s colossal creature. Maggie Gyllenhaal has been selected to direct the Bride of Frankenstein remake after long periods of development hell and changing plans.




As reported by Deadline, Gyllenhaal&#39;s Bride of Frankenstein remake has taken a vital step forward, as new cast members have been confirmed while an expected filming start has been revealed. Oscar nominee Annette Bening has been confirmed to be joining the cast already composed of Jessie Buckley, Christian Bale, Peter Saarsgard, and Penélope Cruz. Alongside the movie&#39;s core cast expansion, it has also been confirmed that the feature will begin filming in the first quarter of 2024.


 What Story Will The Bride of Frankenstein Remake Tell? 
          

The Bride of Frankenstein remake has had a long muddled development history complete with ambitious franchise plans and delays. Angelina Jolie had been cast as the Bride in the ill-fated Dark Universe in a movie that would have been established as part of a vast, shared world first established in 2017&#39;s The Mummy. While Gyllenhaal&#39;s feature would add a renewed chance for the Bride&#39;s retold story was also impacted by 2023&#39;s SAGAFTRA strike, pushing the production&#39;s start into the following year.




                  Netflix’s Two New Frankenstein Movies Can Finally Make Up For Universal’s Failed Dark Universe Starring Tom Cruise   Netflix is developing two Frankenstein movies, and the streamer could succeed where Universal failed by delivering a great shared monster universe.   

While the Bride of Frankenstein remake is free of any Dark Universe interconnectivity, it is also set to stand apart from other successful Universal Monster reimaginings in recent years. While Leigh Wannell&#39;s The Invisible Man took the tale of a twisted inventor&#39;s dark misuse of a creation that renders him invisible and modernized it with a much smaller-scale, but personal narrative, it has been confirmed that Gyllenhaal&#39;s Bride of Frankenstein will be a standalone period piece. Set in 1930s New York, the remake will once more see Frankenstein&#39;s monster and his maker reunite to construct a new patchwork being, though greater emphasis is set to be placed on the chaos the Bride will cause, setting itself apart from the original movie.

With a long-delayed production and an all-star cast, Bride of Frankenstein could become a highly anticipated horror feature once production ramps up. The horror genre has seen incredible success, with various remakes and follow-ups to various franchises that add new perspectives to a franchise, such as Candyman and Halloween standing alongside the movies that inspired them. As such, Gyllenhaal&#39;s Bride of Frankenstein could offer a fresh new take on Mary Shelley&#39;s premise of the modern Prometheus and the horrors daring to play with life can bring.
