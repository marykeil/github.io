## Literature Review

Many of Marvel Comics&#39; mutant heroes and villains were adapted in Fox&#39;s franchise, but the MCU can do justice to many of their designs and costumes.




Marvel Studios can do justice to the character designs and superhero costumes of the X-Men in the MCU much better than 20th Century Fox ever did. Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe spanned 13 feature films over two decades, introducing some of Marvel Comics&#39; most iconic mutant heroes and villains into live-action. While the franchise was the first successful superhero franchise in modern cinema, its latter projects garnered a negative reception, and the film series received constant criticism for its neglect of certain characters and loose adaptations of Marvel Comics&#39; mutant storylines. However, with the MCU&#39;s X-Men reboot in the works, Marvel Studios can finally do justice to these exciting superheroes and villains.
Disney&#39;s acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019 reverted the film rights to mutants and the X-Men to Marvel Studios, allowing a slew of new characters to be integrated into the ever-expanding MCU. Ms. Marvel&#39;s Kamala Khan and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&#39;s Namor were introduced as the MCU&#39;s first on-screen mutants, but 2024&#39;s Deadpool 3 and other upcoming projects are set to debut even more. This will lead into an X-Men project in the MCU, where Marvel Studios will reinvent many characters seen in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, hopefully helping to fix criticisms regarding 20th Century Fox&#39;s poor character designs for its mutants and some questionable and boring superhero costume choices.
            
 
 15 X-Men References &amp; Easter Eggs In The MCU So Far 
The introduction of the X-Men to the MCU feels imminent based on Phase 4 developments. Here&#39;s every mutant reference and confirmed MCU X-Men so far. 












 








 10  Mystique Can Finally Have Her Marvel Comics Costume 
Fox Never Adapted Mystique&#39;s Classic White Costume


 







Mystique was one of the most consistent characters in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, initially portrayed by Rebecca Romijn, but later played by Jennifer Lawrence. While both delivered strong performances, Mystique was also the subject of some of Fox&#39;s most questionable decisions, as she spent the majority of her time on-screen in her nude, blue form, without a costume in sight. In Marvel Comics, Mystique regularly wears a white outfit, which was teased at the end of X-Men: Apocalypse, but was gone again by Dark Phoenix. The MCU&#39;s Mystique should sport a costume of some sort, as it made little sense why Fox decided to keep her naked throughout the X-Men franchise.





 9  Apocalypse Was Too Human In Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe 
Marvel Studios Can Adapt Apocalypse&#39;s Marvel Comics Backstory Accurately
        

Oscar Isaac debuted as the iconic X-Men villain Apocalypse in the self-titled X-Men: Apocalypse, but Fox&#39;s depiction of this terrifying foe was wildly disappointing. In Marvel Comics, Apocalypse, a.k.a. En Sabah Nur, an Ancient Egyptian mutant, uses Celestial technology to enhance himself, which gives him an almost-robotic appearance, but Fox&#39;s iteration of the villain saw him sport a very human appearance. With Celestials already having been established in the MCU, it&#39;s possible that Apocalypse&#39;s full backstory can be explored much more clearly, and his design can become more comic-accurate, rather than the simple, ineffective and confusing design that was depicted in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe.
Apocalypse has a connection to Kang the Conqueror in Marvel Comics, so there have been suspicions of his debut in the MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga. Oscar Isaac went on to debut as Marc Spector, a.k.a. Moon Knight, so Apocalypse will need to be recast for the MCU. 






 8  Fox Never Got Its Sentinel Designs Right 
Sentinels Are Persistent Antagonists To The X-Men
        

Similarly to Apocalypse, Fox&#39;s designs for the Sentinels also never hit the spot. The Sentinels are a group of mutant-hunting robots that present a persistent threat to the X-Men in Marvel Comics, and though two designs for the robots were showcased in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, neither did them justice. X-Men: Days of Future Past presented rudimentary Sentinels in the 1970s that weren&#39;t terrifying at all, while the future versions were resigned to using nano-technology to mimic the abilities of various mutants. The MCU&#39;s Sentinels will be key to establishing mutant discrimination, so their design needs to be adept at striking fear into Marvel Studios&#39; mutant population.





 7  Darwin&#39;s MCU Design Can Draw From His Powers More 
Fox Wasted Darwin In X-Men: First Class
        

Darwin was one of the most wasted mutant characters in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, being only briefly portrayed by Edi Gathegi during X-Men: First Class before he was killed off. First Class introduced Darwin as having the appearance of an average human, but this is a far cry from his depiction in Marvel Comics. Marvel Studios can exhibit a more outlandish-looking Darwin, which will not only give him the chance to show off more of his adaptive abilities, but will also showcase the range of mutations that occur. With characters such as Korg, Veb and the Hulk being done justice in the MCU, Darwin&#39;s strange appearance wouldn&#39;t seem out of place.





 6  Emma Frost Never Showed Off Her Penchant For Fashion 
Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe Never Adapted Emma Frost To Her Full Potential


 







Emma Frost&#39;s live-action adaptations in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe have always fallen flat, whether that be Tahnya Tozzi&#39;s iteration in X-Men Origins: Wolverine or January Jones&#39; version in X-Men: First Class. Jones&#39; iteration came close to delivering a comic-accurate design for Emma Frost, a.k.a. the White Queen, but still failed to deliver the full range of Frost&#39;s abilities. At the least, Emma Frost is perhaps the most fashion-conscious member of the X-Men, which provides Marvel Studios with the opportunity to show off some incredible and fashion-forward outfits for the diamond-skinned telepath - something that Fox always neglected to put into the spotlight.





 5  Storm&#39;s MCU Costume Can Be Inspired By Her African Roots 
Storm&#39;s Backstory Can Be Explored Much More In The MCU
        

Portrayed by both Halle Berry and Alexandra Shipp in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, Storm was one of the franchise&#39;s most neglected characters, especially when her backstory and impact in Marvel Comics is so massive. Storm has roots in Kenya and Wakanda in Marvel Comics, but these were only teased in X-Men: Apocalypse and never properly investigated. Her African roots inspire many of her costume choices in the comics, which is something that Marvel Studios can really lean into, particularly since Wakanda and the Black Panther are already well-established in the MCU. Storm&#39;s MCU debut can be a true celebration of her heritage.
In Marvel Comics, Storm and T&#39;Challa, a.k.a. the Black Panther, were childhood sweethearts who ended up marrying. It&#39;s unclear whether Marvel Studios will try to recreate this storyline in the MCU, especially after T&#39;Challa and actor Chadwick Boseman&#39;s tragic passings. 






 4  Rogue Never Suited Up In Her Iconic X-Men Costume In Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe 
The Origin Of Rogue&#39;s White Hair Was Also Changed In The X-Men Franchise
        

Anna Paquin&#39;s Rogue never got the chance to suit up as an official member of the X-Men in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, which meant that her iconic green-and-yellow outfit was never seen on-screen. Marvel Studios should make a conscious effort to make Rogue an active member of the team in the MCU, rather than the frankly useless version depicted by Fox. Rogue&#39;s white hair in X-Men was also revealed to be a product of Magneto&#39;s actions, but in Marvel Comics, her white hair is said to be either naturally-occurring or dyed for aesthetic purposes, which, while perhaps less glamorous, makes more sense for the confident and exuberant character in live-action.





 3  Iceman&#39;s Full Powers Will Look Better With Improved CGI 
Visual Effects Have Come A Long Way Since The 2000s
        

Bobby Drake&#39;s Iceman only showed off the full extent of his abilities on two occasions in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, once in The Last Stand, and again while battling Sentinels in Days of Future Past. Both of these displayed disappointing visual effects for Drake&#39;s full ice form, but CGI technology and capabilities have come a long way since 2006 and even 2014, meaning Marvel Studios can deliver a much more realistic depiction of Iceman in the MCU. Shawn Ashmore did a good job as Bobby Drake, but the appearance of his full ice form let him down, though this likely won&#39;t be a problem if he&#39;s introduced to the MCU&#39;s X-Men.





 2  Jean Grey Can Be A More Powerful Phoenix In The MCU 
Jean Grey&#39;s Phoenix Powers Were Failed In Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe


 







Perhaps the most consistent and most obvious disappointment in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe was the franchise&#39;s handling of Jean Grey. Famke Janssen and Sophie Turner both portrayed the mutant telepath, and both embarked on an adaptation of Marvel Comics&#39; benchmark Dark Phoenix Saga, but neither managed to display the full strength, elegance and brutality of the Phoenix. Marvel Studios will likely steer clear of the Dark Phoenix Saga for now, but Jean Grey&#39;s MCU debut should nevertheless show off her abilities more clearly, and with more style, than Fox ever managed to. Jean Grey is a key member of the X-Men, so she deserves to be done justice in the MCU.





 1  Wolverine Is Getting His Comic Accurate Costume In Deadpool 3 
Hugh Jackman Is Returning As Wolverine In Deadpool 3
        

Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine was never seen sporting a comic-accurate costume in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, despite one being teased in a deleted scene from The Wolverine. Thankfully, this will change in 2024&#39;s Deadpool 3, as Hugh Jackman&#39;s debut in the MCU proper will see him don his yellow-and-blue Wolverine costume opposite Ryan Reynolds&#39; Deadpool, who has embraced his comic-accurate costume since 2016&#39;s Deadpool. Even so, the question still stands whether the MCU&#39;s official Wolverine will don a comic-accurate costume. Many actors have been rumored to be the MCU&#39;s Wolverine, but it&#39;s still unclear just how comic-accurate the clawed member of the X-Men will be in the MCU&#39;s future.
