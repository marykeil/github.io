## Literature Review

The newly released trailer for Jennifer Lopez&#39;s This is Me Now... A Love Story reveals an album documentary that defies genre convention.




The This Is Me... Now: A Love Story trailer unveils Jennifer Lopez&#39;s genre-defying new movie. The feature-length project is designed to tie in with her upcoming album This Is Me... Now, with both projects dropping on February 16. The movie will blend documentary and fantasy, exploring Jennifer Lopez&#39;s high-profile love life, including her relationship with her two-time boyfriend, now husband, Ben Affleck, who is also set to appear in the movie. Described as being &#34;steeped in mythological storytelling and personal healing,&#34; the movie will tell Lopez&#39;s story from her own perspective.




Prime Video has now unveiled the official trailer for Jennifer Lopez&#39;s This Is Me... Now: A Love Story. Check it out below:


 

The trailer opens with a monologue delivered by Lopez about the fact that, despite being a hopeless romantic, she is far from weak. What follows is a variety of clips that dramatize various moments from her real life and four marriages, as well as fantasy sequences that include choreographed music videos and high-octane action scenes.

It has become a common practice in recent years for high-profile album releases to be released alongside a feature-length movie. These typically take one of two forms. The first is a pure documentary style following the artist&#39;s journey, such as Shawn Mendes: In Wonder or Billie Eilish: The World&#39;s a Little Blurry. Others are presented as visual albums, with a series of interlinked music videos based on the album&#39;s songs, a style that Beyoncé has favored with movies like Black Is King and Lemonade.




                  All 6 Beyoncé Documentary Movies, Ranked (Including Renaissance)   Throughout her legendary, storied career, Beyonce has released six documentaries, with Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé being the latest release.   

However, this new Jennifer Lopez movie seems to be a blend between those two formats as well as a variety of other genres. Instead of behind-the-scenes footage of her life, an ensemble of actors portrays her friend group in dialogue scenes, which seem to take place between musical numbers featuring songs from the new album, some of which take place in a fantasy world. In this way, its closest analog is probably the Oscar-winning Elton John biopic jukebox musical Rocketman.



Rocketman, which starred Taron Egerton as Elton John, used the artist&#39;s songs as musical numbers in a dramatization of his own life.




This is Me... Now: A Love Story seems to be tapping into Jennifer Lopez&#39;s movie career as much as her music career. Its visuals draw on everything from her rom-com stardom in movies such as 2001&#39;s The Wedding Planner and 2022&#39;s Marry Me to her action movie roles in projects including 1997&#39;s Anaconda and 2023&#39;s The Mother. By blending so many aspects of Lopez&#39;s life and career, the movie is a fictionalized but wide-ranging retrospective of the artist and her life in a very unique way.
