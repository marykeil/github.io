# The Batman 2 Sees Gotham Covered In Snow In Moody DC Fan Poster


## SUMMARY 


 

A new fan poster for The Batman - Part II envisions a snow-covered Gotham City, hinting at a wintery setting for the movie.


While no official details about the film have been revealed, speculation suggests that Mr. Freeze could be a potential villain in the sequel.


The flooding in Gotham at the end of The Batman could set up an interesting visual connection with Mr. Freeze if the city remains icy during winter.
