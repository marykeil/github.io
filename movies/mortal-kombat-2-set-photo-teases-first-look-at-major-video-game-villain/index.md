A Mortal Kombat 2 set photo teases a first look at a major video game villain. A sequel to the 2021 film, the Mortal Kombat 2 cast includes the return of Lewis Tan, Jessica McNamee, Tadanobu Asano, Mehcad Brooks, Ludi Lin, Chin Han, Joe Taslim, and Hiroyuki Sanada in their respective roles, with newcomers including Karl Urban as Johnny Cage and Tati Gabrielle as Jade. Mortal Kombat 2 resumed filming following the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike in November 2022, and since then, multiple set photos have surfaced online.




Now, a new set photo from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie shared by producer Todd Garner on Twitter/X teases a first look at a major video game villain â€“ Quan Chi.

 Everything Revealed By Mortal Kombat 2 Set Photos 
          




Ever since the sequel resumed filming in November 2022, producer Todd Garner has shared multiple Mortal Kombat 2 set photos teasing the upcoming sequel. One of the photos shows a rocky surface glowing red, which is likely the Netherrealm, a key location from the games that was mentioned in the first film. More Mortal Kombat 2 set photos tease the arrival of two more major video game characters, Shao Kahn (played by Martyn Ford) and his adopted daughter Kitana (Adeline Rudolph).

The latest Mortal Kombat 2 set photo hints at the arrival of another major video game villain, Quan Chi, which is a tantalizing tease. Quan Chi has been called Mortal Kombat&#39;s greatest villain, and given his inclusion in the sequel, Earthrealm should have its hands full contending with more than one formidable foe. Damon Herriman, who provided the voice for Kabal in the first film, is reportedly the one playing Quan Chi in Mortal Kombat 2.



Mortal Kombat 2 does not yet have a release date.
