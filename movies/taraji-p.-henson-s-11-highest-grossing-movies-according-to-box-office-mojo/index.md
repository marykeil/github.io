## Literature Review

Taraji P. Henson has been working her way up the worlds of both film and television, and more often than not, her ventures in the former are gold.




With a mix of animated movies, Oscar-winning dramas, and crowd-pleasing rom-coms, Taraji P. Henson&#39;s highest-grossing movies showcase the actor&#39;s versatile career. After tackling supporting roles in films like Hustle &amp; Flow, Four Brothers, and Smokin&#39; Aces, Henson had a critically adored breakthrough supporting role in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. After receiving an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for Benjamin Button, her star skyrocketed, and she started adding some lead roles to her filmography with movies like Tyler Perry&#39;s I Can Do Bad All By Myself and the underrated No Good Deed. Along with her acclaim as an actor came considerable box office success with some standout movies.
Continuing to show off her wide range of skills, Henson showcases her singing abilities in The Color Purple. With solid reviews and big buzz, the musical could fit nicely among Henson&#39;s other successful movies. In recent months, the actor has been candid about not getting the paydays she feels she deserves, and considering the successful movies she has been involved in, she is likely right to suggest she deserves more. Not only do these movies exhibit a variety of different styles, but all were deemed successes as Tarji P. Henson&#39;s highest-grossing movies (via Box Office Mojo).

 11  I Can Do Bad All By Myself (2009) 
Worldwide Gross: $51.7 Million
        

I Can Do Bad All by Myself was a smart early lead role for Henson to take. The film is simultaneously a Madea film (who had several times proven herself a box office magnet) and a showcase for the Empire star&#39;s talent. The movie finds Madea (Tyler Perry) attempting to deal with some misbehaving kids by sending them to live with their hard-drinking and irresponsible aunt April (Henson). Perr has always kept his films relatively cost-effective so there&#39;s little doubt its $51.7 million domestic tally was enough to make it profitable and then some. Being one of Henson&#39;s earliest starring roles, it was a good showcase for how effective she could carry a movie.

 10  No Good Deed (2014) 
Worldwide Gross: $54.3 Million
        

No Good Deed paired Henson with Idris Elba with the two sharing electrifying chemistry together in a tense thriller. Henson plays a single mother who finds her family terrorized by Elba&#39;s escaped convict. It&#39;s the type of film where actions are fueled by revenge with an innocent person caught up in the mix. Henson brings the right mixture of rationale, fear, and gutsy independence while also being one of Idris Elba&#39;s overlooked movies featuring a solid villain turn. The movie benefited from the star power of the two lead actors as well as the intense story. Though it did not have much of a presence at the international box office, it was a solid hit domestically as it earned $52.5 million on a budget of just $13.2 million.

 9  Think Like A Man Too (2014) 
Worldwide Gross: $70.2 Million
        

Henson reteamed with the rest of the Think Like A Man ensemble for the Las Vegas-set sequel. &#34;The Dreamer&#34; and &#34;The Woman Who Is Her Own Man,&#34; as they&#39;re titled in their segment of the first film, don&#39;t get quite as much screen time in the follow-up though. Like much of Think Like A Man Too, their chemistry feels like leftovers compared to what came just two short years earlier in the original movie. Unfortunately for Think Like a Man Too, there just wasn&#39;t as much interest in the characters or concept. Even still, the sequel hit the screens with a surprisingly tiny budget of $24 million and made nearly three times as much.

 8  Four Brothers (2005) 
Worldwide Gross: $92.4 Million


 







Henson&#39;s role in Four Brothers is negligible, but it&#39;s still a brutally entertaining film worth a watch. The plot follows four adopted brothers who lost the woman who brought them together; Henson plays the wife of André 3000&#39;s character. With Wahlberg leading the cast, Four Brothers was always going to have at least a modest budget, and that&#39;s where it was kept at $45 million. For Paramount Pictures&#39; investment, the film netted just over $90 million. It is a solid number for an R-rated action movie in which Wahlberg was the biggest name and was another success for the late director John Singleton.

 7  Think Like A Man (2012) 
Worldwide Gross: $96 Million
        

  Think Like a Man  


  Release Date    July 12, 2012     Director    Tim Story     Cast    Kevin Hart , Michael Ealy , Taraji P. Henson     Runtime    122minutes    


Think Like A Man is based on Steve Harvey&#39;s book of the same title. The film follows a group of selfish men paired with persistently supportive women who gain their independence by reading Harvey&#39;s book. Henson is paired with Michael Ealy as Lauren and Dominic, and her role in the film is poignant even if it isn&#39;t quite central. Even with its massive cast of stars, which includes Kevin Hart and Regina Hall, Think Like a Man only cost $12 million. By the time it had left theaters, the film had octupled that figure (mostly thanks to its domestic tally), practically guaranteeing the existence of Think Like a Man Too.

 6  Date Night (2010) 
Worldwide Gross: $152.3 Million
        

  Date Night  


  Release Date    April 8, 2010     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Steve Carell , Tina Fey , Mark Wahlberg , Mark Ruffalo , Kristen Wiig , James Franco , Mila Kunis     Runtime    88minutes    


The Office&#39;s Steve Carell and 30 Rock&#39;s Tina Fey stepped away from their respective NBC sitcoms to join forces for the high-concept comedy Date Night. The pair play a married couple who fear they are in a rut and decide to be adventurous by taking another person&#39;s dinner reservation while out on a date night which leads to a dangerous case of mistaken identity. The movie is filled with fun cameos from James Franco and Mila Kunis as a criminal couple, Mark Wahlberg as a security expert, and Henson as a skeptical detective. The rom-com action movie pushed through a mixed critical reception to the result of $152.3 million worldwide.

 5  Hidden Figures (2016) 
Worldwide Gross: $236 Million


 







  Hidden Figures  


  Release Date    January 6, 2017     Director    Theodore Melfi     Cast    Jim Parsons , Glen Powell , Kirsten Dunst , Taraji P. Henson , Octavia Spencer , Janelle Monae , Aldis Hodge , Kevin Costner , Mahershala Ali     Runtime    126 minutes    


Hidden Figures is a period piece about a little-known story of American history as well as a wonderful showcase for Janelle Monáe, Octavia Spencer, and, especially, Henson as genius scientist Katherine Johnson. Hidden Figures tells the story of a trio of Black women who represent the unrecognized Black scientists who were instrumental in the early days of the NASA space program. The movie earned strong reviews and plenty of awards attention, including a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. Combined with the family-friendly and crowd-pleasing story, Hidden Figures became a surprise hit and generated nearly 10 times its $25 million budget.

 4  The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button (2008) 
Worldwide Gross: $335.8 Million


 







  The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  


  Release Date    December 25, 2008     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Faune Chambers Watkins , Brad Pitt , Julia Ormond , Cate Blanchett , Elias Koteas     Runtime    166 minutes    


David Fincher&#39;s The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a visually stunning and heartfelt epic with excellent lead performances from Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. It tells the story of the titular character who has an unusual condition that causes him to age in reserve, beginning life as an old man and gradually becoming younger. As Queenie, the woman who takes in and raises Benjamin, Henson is the soul of the film and delivers the best performance of the cast, earning her Oscar nomination. The movie itself was nominated for Best Picture which undoubtedly boosted the box office. With such a unique concept and a massive budget of $150 million, Fincher&#39;s film earned $335.8 million worldwide.

 3  The Karate Kid (2010) 
Worldwide Gross: $359.1 Million
        

  The Karate Kid (2010)  


  Release Date    June 11, 2010     Director    Harald Zwart     Cast    Jaden Smith , Jackie Chan , Taraji P. Henson , Wenwen Han , Zhenwei Wang , Yu Rongguang , Shijia Lü , Luke Carberry     Runtime    140 Minutes    


The Karate Kid hit theaters in 2010 with quite a bit of fanfare and anticipation, but it also faced some skepticism. Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita had brought indelible chemistry to the original, but plenty took to the dynamic between Jaden Smith&#39;s Dre Parker and Mr. Han (Jackie Chan). Henson portrays Sherry Parker, and while she brings a lot of heart to the protective maternal role, the narrative doesn&#39;t give her much to do. Like the original film from the &#39;80s, 2010&#39;s The Karate Kid was a substantial success. Even with a big franchise title and Jackie Chan, who is returning in a sequel, on the cast list, the remake only cost $40 million and the re-imagining had amassed a very respectable $359.1 million.

 2  Ralph Breaks The Internet (2019) 
Worldwide Gross: $529.3 Million
        

  Ralph Breaks the Internet  


  Release Date    November 21, 2018     Director    Rich Moore , Phil Johnston     Cast    John C. Reilly , Sarah Silverman , Alan Tudyk , Jane Lynch , Ed O&#39;Neill , Taraji P. Henson , Jack McBrayer , Gal Gadot     Runtime    112 Minutes    


Despite her acclaim on the big screen, like many actors, Henson&#39;s highest-grossing movies are in the animated world where she doesn&#39;t even appear on screen. However, she memorably portrayed an algorithm (named &#34;Yesss&#34;) in the successful sequel to Wreck-It Ralph. She essentially drops in to help Ralph and Vanellope on their adventure and swiftly leaves, but her boisterous personality leaves an indelible mark. Ralph Breaks the Internet carried a hefty price tag of $175 million, however, it managed to outgross the original with an impressive $529.3 million. This was surely aided by the movie&#39;s many Disney Easter eggs and references, including a fun sequence featuring cameos from all the Disney princesses.

 1  Minions: The Rise Of Gru (2022) 
Worldwide Gross: $940.7 Million


 







  Minions: The Rise of Gru  


  Release Date    July 1, 2022     Director    Brad Ableson , Kyle Balda     Cast    Steve Carr , Pierre Coffin     Runtime    90 Minutes    


Once again, it is an animated movie that tops the box office charts for Henson with her joining the incredibly popular Despicable Me franchise. The prequel movie follows the adorable Minions as they meet young Gru in the early days of his journey to becoming a criminal mastermind. Henson has a standout role as the movie&#39;s chief villain, the master thief named Bell Bottom. The family-friendly franchise has always been a hit with audiences, making it the flagship franchise of Illumination Animated Studio. This once again proved to be the case as Minions: The Rise of Gru nearly became Henson&#39;s first billion-dollar movie with $940.7 million.
