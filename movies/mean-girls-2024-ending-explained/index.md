Summary

  The Mean Girls musical film received positive reviews for its fun musical numbers, popular source material, and strong performances.   The 2024 version of Mean Girls features changes, including an added redemptive moment and a shift in Janis&#39; character, making her out and proud.   The film does not set up a sequel, as it is a self-contained story with a clear message: treating people with kindness is important.  







20 years after the original film, a musical movie adaptation of Mean Girls is in theaters, providing a new twist to the 2004 classic and making some ending changes. Mean Girls was first adapted into a musical for the Broadway stage in 2017 and became the most-nominated musical that season with 12 Tony Award nominations. This has translated into positive reviews for the Mean Girls musical film due to the fun musical numbers, popular source material, and strong performances. Though there are some changes made between all three versions of Mean Girls, it remains a faithful adaptation full of familiar jokes that are still laugh-out-loud funny two decades later.

Mean Girls was originally meant to be released solely for streaming on Paramount&#43; but was given a theatrical release. Hopefully, a streaming date will be announced soon, but for now, Mean Girls can be seen in theaters and the soundtrack is available on all major music streaming platforms. Mean Girls modernizes both the 2004 movie and 2017 stage production, utilizing new developments in social media and trends that will eventually make it just as nostalgic as the original. Though the slogan for Mean Girls 2024 is “not your mother’s Mean Girls,” the movie musical can be enjoyed by audiences of all ages.

 How Mean Girls 2024&#39;s Ending Is Different From The 2004 Movie 
          

The big ending scene of both Mean Girls 2004 and Mean Girls 2024 takes place at the Spring Fling dance. Before the winner of Spring Fling Queen was announced in the musical movie, Regina and Cady had a one-on-one conversation in the bathroom where Cady apologized and Regina (high on painkillers) forgave her former friend. It’s a nice redemptive moment that wasn&#39;t present in the 2004 film. When Cady is named Spring Fling Queen in Mean Girls, it’s against different competition. In the original movie, Damian snuck Janis into the group of nominees, whereas in the musical, Karen is nominated alongside her fellow Plastics instead.

A big change made to Janis’s character in Mean Girls was her sexuality. While Janis was bullied in the original movie after Regina spread a (likely false) rumor that she was a lesbian, her character is out and proud in the 2024 version and takes a date to the Spring Fling instead of attending with her gay best friend Damian. Mean Girls 2024 takes Janis from a queer-coded character to a canon lesbian. This also meant that they never kissed at the end and Janis never ended up with Kevin G like she did in the original epilogue, which was also missing in the new Mean Girls ending.

 What Happens To The Cady &amp; The Plastics After Mean Girls? 
         

The original Mean Girls film featured an epilogue narrated by Cady that revealed what happened to them after the Spring Fling and during their senior year of high school. Cady began dating Aaron, Regina joined the lacrosse team as an outlet for her anger, Karen became a weatherperson, and Gretchen joined a new clique. Though a group of young girls seemed to be ready to take over as the new junior Plastics, as Cady put it, “finally, Girl World was at peace.”

Without this epilogue in the Mean Girls musical movie, viewers can only speculate what happened to Cady and The Plastics after the events of the film. Since Karen didn’t have her “ESPN” subplot, she probably didn’t end up as a weatherperson, but the other character outcomes are still plausible for the movie musical. The end credits scenes showed everyone having fun at the Spring Fling dance, suggesting that after the events of Mean Girls 2024, they were all able to become friends again, or at least remain friendly with each other.






 Lindsay Lohan Returns For Mean Girls Cameo 
The original Cady plays a different part
          

Mean Girls had a surprise cameo with Lindsay Lohan playing the host of the High School Mathletes State Championship. After avoiding the club due to what it might do to her social status, Cady finally joined the Mathletes towards the end of the film to gain extra credit. This is where she says her famous “the limit does not exist” line, but not before sharing a comedic conversation with Lohan’s unnamed character.

Cady had learned her lesson from her time with The Plastics and didn’t want to compete with other girls anymore. However, Lohan&#39;s host character reminds her that it&#39;s actually a competition, which she ends up winning for North Shore. The cameo is brief, but it allows the original and new Cady to interact, bringing her story full circle. Lohan may not have returned to her original role like Tina Fey (Ms. Norbury) and Tim Meadows (Principal Duvall), but her cameo is a nice nod to 2004’s Mean Girls and her contributions to the classic film.






 Why Mean Girls&#39; Ending Doesn&#39;t Set Up A Sequel 
          

Mean Girls 2024 has a post-credit scene that had previously appeared in the trailer and likely took place when Cady first came to Regina’s house. Karen and Regina walk to the camera as the head of The Plastics says, “You&#39;re next. You could be really hot if we changed, like, everything.&#34; The phrase &#34;you&#39;re next&#34; in the Mean Girls post-credit scene could be interpreted as a tease at a sequel, but that doesn’t fit within the film and its message. Rather, the direct address is more likely a cheeky way to speak to the audience and a warning that anyone could become a Plastic.

The original Mean Girls movie had a sequel, Mean Girls 2, that was released in 2011 as a standalone TV movie. It shared the setting of North Shore High and followed a similar plot formula, with a new girl transferring to the school and encountering The Plastics, leading her to start her own clique, The Anti-Plastics. It was ill-received and deemed an unnecessary sequel that paled in comparison to the original. The story in Mean Girls is self-contained, so there’s no need for the musical movie to have a sequel either.






 The Real Meaning Of Mean Girls 2024 
          

The biggest lesson of Mean Girls was summed up by Cady in the original film when she said via voiceover, “Calling someone stupid doesn&#39;t make you any smarter.” The line was given to Ms. Norbury in the Mean Girls movie musical during the assembly scene and was repeated by Janis and Damian in the film’s closing remarks. While the original movie was narrated by Cady, the 2024 version was framed as a story being told by Janis and Damian, providing another perspective to the familiar story. Following the Spring Fling, they returned to provide the moral of the story.

Janis was one of Mean Girl’s meanest characters, but the final scene proved that she too had learned her lesson. There is nothing to gain from being mean to someone, whether they were mean to you first or not. Instead, that just makes you like them, as shown by Cady becoming Plastic and acting in the very same way she’d previously judged. If you have to become a worse version of yourself for someone to like you, those people aren’t your real friends. Mean Girls has a real message that teaches viewers it’s best to just treat people with kindness because everyone is deserving of it.
