James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.




James Gunn has debunked several DC Universe rumors ever since he became the creative head of the new DCU, helping paint a picture of what fans can expect from the franchise&#39;s reboot.

With so much excitement over the DCU&#39;s reboot, rumors about DC&#39;s new movies, series, and the DCU&#39;s canon characters have naturally started to come up.
