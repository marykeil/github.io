  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&rsquo; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.</p>
<p>James Gunn has debunked several DC Universe rumors ever since he became the creative head of the new DCU, helping paint a picture of what fans can expect from the franchise&rsquo;s reboot. Gunn is currently hard at work, personally, on at least two DCU projects: 2025&rsquo;s Superman: Legacy, which begins filming in March, and Peacemaker season 2, which Gunn is writing. Beyond those two projects, the DCU has an entire slate waiting to get into production.
The DCU&rsquo;s upcoming movies include Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, The Brave and the Bold, and more, while the universe&rsquo;s series include Lanterns, Booster Gold, and others among its ranks. With so much excitement over the DCU&rsquo;s reboot, rumors about DC&rsquo;s new movies, series, and the DCU&rsquo;s canon characters have naturally started to come up. However, while some of them have become true or were partially confirmed, most of the rumors have been debunked. Here are the DCU rumors that Gunn has debunked so far.</p>

Harley Quinn</p>
<p>Close</p>

Gunn debunked the rumor that Bane would appear in Peacemaker season 2 as a primary antagonist, saying, &ldquo;This is bullshit.&rdquo; While fans continue to wish for Guardians of the Galaxy franchise star Dave Bautista to team up again with Gunn as Bane, that will at least not happen in Peacemaker season 2.</p>
<p>10  James Gunn Debunks Clark Kent Will Be A Father In Superman: Legacy Rumor
Superman: Legacy</p>
<p>Gunn debunked the rumor that Clark Kent would be a father in Superman: Legacy. While Jonathan Kent has been getting more popular in DC Comics over the past few years, the idea of Corenswet, at 30, already having a child in his first DCU outing never made much sense. That is why Gunn debunked the Superman: Legacy rumor by confirming, &ldquo;I never said Clark is going to have a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9  James Gunn Debunks Amanda Waller Return In Superman: Legacy Rumor
Superman: Legacy</p>

Gunn debunked the rumor that Wonder Woman would not show up for three years in the DCU. While the DC Studios co-CEO did not reveal when Wonder Woman will return, at least she will not go missing for years when the new DCU begins.</p>
<p>7  James Gunn Debunks Pom Klementieff Superman: Legacy Casting
Superman: Legacy</p>
