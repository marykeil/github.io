  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&rsquo; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.</p>
<p>James Gunn has debunked several DC Universe rumors ever since he became the creative head of the new DCU, helping paint a picture of what fans can expect from the franchise&rsquo;s reboot. Gunn is currently hard at work, personally, on at least two DCU projects: 2025&rsquo;s Superman: Legacy, which begins filming in March, and Peacemaker season 2, which Gunn is writing. Beyond those two projects, the DCU has an entire slate waiting to get into production.
The DCU&rsquo;s upcoming movies include Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, The Brave and the Bold, and more, while the universe&rsquo;s series include Lanterns, Booster Gold, and others among its ranks. With so much excitement over the DCU&rsquo;s reboot, rumors about DC&rsquo;s new movies, series, and the DCU&rsquo;s canon characters have naturally started to come up. However, while some of them have become true or were partially confirmed, most of the rumors have been debunked. Here are the DCU rumors that Gunn has debunked so far.</p>
