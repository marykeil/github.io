## SUMMARY 



  Rebel Moon co-writer Kurt Johnstad reveals that the director&#39;s cut will more fully flesh out Jimmy and Kora, in addition to giving Noble and Aris new introductions.   Johnstad also affirms that the director&#39;s cut, which will be rated R, will feature even more action.   One of Rebel Moon&#39;s biggest criticisms is that it features fairly bland characters, something that the director&#39;s cut could address.

## Literature Review

Co-writer Kurt Johnstad addresses Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child Of Fire’s director’s cut, revealing exactly what new scenes audiences can expect.




Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire co-writer Kurt Johnstad teases specifics about the new scenes in the film&#39;s upcoming director&#39;s cut. Released on Netflix in December, Zack Snyder&#39;s latest film is an epic space opera telling the story of one lone warrior&#39;s attempts to rally a group of soldiers to defend a peaceful farming colony. Before the film even hit the streamer, it was confirmed that a Rebel Moon director&#39;s cut is on the way, which will boast an R rating and plenty of new footage.




Now, as the wait for Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver&#39;s release date continues, Johnstad teases in an interview with THR what specific scenes will be included in the first film&#39;s director&#39;s cut. While Snyder previously confirmed that more character depth will be included, Johnstad&#39;s latest comment reveals that the extended cut will feature a handful of entirely new character introductions. Check out the co-writer&#39;s full comment below:


“There’s definitely a lot more story at the front of the movie. You’re definitely going to get a lot more [of Anthony Hopkins’] Jimmy and see his arc, and you’re going to get a lot more of Kora and the Motherworld. You’re going to get a different introduction to Noble [Ed Skrein]. You’re also going to get a different introduction to some smaller characters like Aris [Sky Yang], who’s the Motherworld soldier that defends the character of Sam in the granary. 
“But just in broad brushstrokes, there’s more character, and certainly knowing Zack, there’s more action and spectacle and the visual vibrance of what he does. So there just wasn’t enough time. It would’ve been a four-hour PG-13 movie.”





  


 How Rebel Moon&#39;s Director&#39;s Cut Can Fix One Of The Movie&#39;s Big Problems 
          

While hype was high for Snyder&#39;s latest movie, which was essentially billed as his grittier take on Star Wars, it wasn&#39;t met with a particularly positive reception. The Rebel Moon reviews criticize many aspects of the film, including just how much it borrows from other sci-fi and fantasy IP, but the lack of character depth was also a major sticking point for many critics. 

Like pretty much every other Snyder film, the Rebel Moon action and visuals are truly breathtaking. The problem, however, is that the film doesn&#39;t do enough to make audiences care about the characters participating in this action. Kora (Sofia Boutella) does get hints of a compelling backstory through flashbacks to her time on the Motherworld, but it&#39;s arguably not enough.




It&#39;s a similar story for the rest of the film&#39;s characters, ultimately meaning that the Rebel Moon ending doesn&#39;t hit as hard as it otherwise could have. If the director&#39;s cut fixes the film&#39;s character problems, it could elevate the entire story and set the film apart from other hit sci-fi and fantasy movies, breathing fresh life into the familiar &#34;Rebellion versus the Empire&#34; premise. With the follow-up to Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire being teased as even more action-packed, the director&#39;s cut can hopefully make the story&#39;s heroes more worth rooting for.
