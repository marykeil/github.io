## Literature Review

The Planet of the Apes reboot franchise is getting a fourth film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, courtesy of its new owner, Disney.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, the fourth movie in the most recent reboot series of The Planet of the Apes franchise, is on the way in 2024.  In the next Planet of the Apes movie, the intelligent simian descendants of Caesar are continuing to navigate the struggles of becoming the dominant species on planet Earth. The humans meanwhile have descended into feral, animalistic beings, much like those seen in the 1968 original which kicked off The Planet of the Apes franchise.




With a cast that doesn&#39;t include Andy Serkis (The Lord of the Rings&#39;s Gollum) for the first time, there&#39;s much anticipation on what the next Planet of the Apes movie will bring. Serkis&#39;s Caesar has been the central focus of every film in the reboot franchise so far, so Kingdom will as much be the story of how the franchise continues without him as it is about his character&#39;s legacy in the society of intelligent apes.
