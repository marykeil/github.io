# Michael B. Jordan Has To Wait Until Creed 7 To Break A Sylvester Stallone Rocky Record


## SUMMARY 



  Michael B. Jordan is the new face of the Rocky and Creed franchises, but he still needs to wait until Creed 7 to break Sylvester Stallone&#39;s franchise record.   Both Jordan and Stallone have taken on a leadership role behind the camera by directing films in the franchise. Jordan will direct Creed 4 and become the third person to direct multiple entries.   While it is possible for Jordan to break Stallone&#39;s directing record, the chances are low. It would require him to direct several more Creed sequels, which may not align with his long-term plans.

## Literature Review

Michael B. Jordan is taking on a bigger role in the Rocky series, but he&#39;ll have to wait for more Creed sequels to break a Sylvester Stallone record.




Michael B. Jordan is the face of the Rocky and Creed franchises now, but the star will have to wait until a hypothetical Creed 7 to break one of Sylvester Stallone&#39;s franchise records. Jordan&#39;s role as Adonis Creed in the Creed movies helped position him as the new lead of the series. Sylvester Stallone might have returned to star in the first two movies, but Rocky was not in Creed 3. This signified how the boxing series had officially shifted its focus to be about Apollo Creed&#39;s son instead of trying to find ways to continue the Italian Stallion&#39;s story.




The role that Michael B. Jordan is taking within the larger Rocky universe is now following a similar path as Sylvester Stallone&#39;s did. He starred in eight movies in the franchise, which is many more than the three that Jordan has done so far. However, both men also took on a leadership role behind the camera by directing installments. Creed 3 marked the first instance of this for Michael B. Jordan, and the film&#39;s success meant it would not be the last. It has already been confirmed that Jordan will direct Creed 4 next, making him only the third person to direct multiple entries in the series.

                  Creed 4 Shouldn&#39;t Kill Rocky Off - Sylvester Stallone Already Got A Perfect Ending   Rocky survived the Creed trilogy, and given how perfect Sylvester Stallone&#39;s send-off was, his death doesn&#39;t need to be addressed in Creed 4.   


 Michael B. Jordan Needs 3 More Sequels After Creed 4 To Become Rocky&#39;s Biggest Director 
          




Now that Michael B. Jordan is set to direct at least two Creed movies, he is now on a path to potentially becoming the biggest director in the Rocky franchise. Original director John G. Avildsen and Sylvester Stallone are the only other people to direct multiple Rocky movies. Avildsen was behind the original film and returned for Rocky V, but Stallone was responsible for directing the four other standalone films for his character. This means that Michael B. Jordan is still two sequels away from tying Stallone&#39;s record after Creed 4 and three films away from breaking it.

The quickest way for Michael B. Jordan to break Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Rocky director record is by helming Creed 5, Creed 6, and Creed 7. That would give him five directing credits with the franchise. So far, the additional three sequels needed to break the record are unconfirmed to be in development. Michael B. Jordan&#39;s focus will remain on directing Creed 4 first and foremost, ensuring that the sequel is another crowd-pleasing hit before thinking about directing three more entries. But, if he does want to be Rocky&#39;s biggest director, staying aboard until Creed 7 is what it will require.






 Michael B. Jordan Breaking Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Directing Record Is Highly Unlikely 
          

While it is at least conceivable that Michael B. Jordan could break Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Rocky director record, the odds of it actually happening are quite low. This would likely require the actor and aspiring director to spend the next decade or more of his career directing Creed sequels. If Creed 4 proves to be as successful as Creed 3, he will potentially be courted for other directing opportunities, potentially even his dream Dragon Ball Z gig. There is certainly room for him to continue growing within the Creed franchise with the fourth film, but remaining part of the overall Rocky series for decades might not be part of his plans.
