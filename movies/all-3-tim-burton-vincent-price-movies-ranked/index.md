 3  Hansel and Gretel (1983) 
Vincent Price hosted the special that showcased the film
        

A formative work for Tim Burton, the made-for-TV movie Hansel and Gretel provided early collaborative intersection with his idol, Vincent Price. Burton was enlisted to put his unique spin on the fairy tale story for a Disney Channel special hosted by Price himself. Though operating on a modest $116,000 budget, Burton implemented his trademark stylistic flair. Always enthralled by offbeat themes, he envisioned the classic siblings’ tale with elements of kung fu and Japanese cinema influences. Keeping costs low by filming in 16mm with amateur actors, Burton maximized the atmosphere via committed production design. The sets and visuals channeled a creepy, Halloween look often seen in his movies.
Price’s hosting duties framed the special, inducting audiences into Burton’s unconventional vision. Though his actual screen time was limited compared to later collaborations, his impact and pedigree lent credibility to Burton’s weird and artistic film. Without having yet helmed his own major films, Burton benefited greatly from Price’s early sponsorship. It validated him as a young creative with a delightfully demented touch capable of expanding Disney’s family-friendly formulas. In many ways, their alliance foreshadowed what they would later conjure together cinematically. Hansel and Gretel featured glimpses of the magical dark energy produced when Price’s old Hollywood poise converges with Burton’s youthful eclecticism.
Added to the list of Tim Burton Disney movies, Hansel and Gretel represented a vital early creative intersection between Burton and Price that resonated for years after. Price&#39;s seal of approval even from a peripheral hosting role empowered Burton in expanding his stylistic footprint. Their potent chemistry, mixing classic charm and quirky ideation, carried through more substantial later partnerships like Edward Scissorhands. Price&#39;s influence can be felt across Burton&#39;s filmography today in the embrace of imaginative dark beauty. For Price, engaging with an enterprising young talent like Burton reaffirmed his creative impact transcending generations. Their bond tapped into timeless qualities of fantasy and strangeness that both uniquely excelled at.





 2  Vincent (1982) 
Vincent Price narrated the short film
        

An approximately six-minute stop-motion tribute directly inspired by Price’s extensive Edgar Allan Poe filmography, Vincent saw the veteran horror icon actually narrate Burton’s twisted tale. Given Price&#39;s career-defining association with Poe adaptations, his literal voiceover immediately supplied Burton’s passion project with thrilling legitimacy. Beyond the narration, Vincent channeled Price’s onscreen essence more deeply than any other collaboration. The story follows a creepy kid envisioning himself as a tortured loner conducting dark experiments, directly paralleling the ominous brooding persona Price perfected. Shot in black and white, the homage mimicked the tonal and visual palette of Price’s classics. Between production design and narrative, Burton manifested his childhood awe of those films.

Tim Burton has one of the most distinctive styles of any major Hollywood filmmaker, and these movies are often mistaken as part of his filmography.



Vincent’s grounding in the imagination of a disturbed youth discovering horror spoke to Burton’s own artistic origins. More than a display of early filmmaking bravado, Vincent captured a magically surreal collaboration between idol and worshiping fan. Having Price give his stamp of approval introduced contemporary quirks alongside old Hollywood reverence. It augmented the emotionality of Burton’s vision, enriching the animated experiment with very human meaning. Their bond transcended convention to produce something earnestly odd and beautiful. Of all joint projects, Vincent resonated most personably with each artist. Its handmade singularity fittingly embodied their relationship’s profound impact.
With Vincent, idol and admirer unified in an emotional homage exemplifying their artistic wavelength. Price&#39;s literal voiceover consecrated Burton’s animated passion project, legitimizing his stylistic vision. Meanwhile, Price discovered enduring relevance through a young disciple&#39;s eyes, his talent transcending generations via this flattering tribute. Participating so intimately in inspiring Burton&#39;s origins story also cemented Price&#39;s cultural staying power. Vincent unlocked their relationship&#39;s depth. It fueled Burton&#39;s daring instincts, knowing his childhood hero sanctioned the eccentric direction. Simultaneously, the kindred creative spirit Price found in Burton reaffirmed his own unconventional approaches.





 1  Edward Scissorhands (1990) 
Vincent Price portrays The Inventor


 







  Edward Scissorhands  


  Release Date    December 14, 1990     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Vincent Price , Dianne Wiest , Anthony Michael Hall , Johnny Depp , Winona Ryder , Kathy Baker     Rating    PG-13    


One of Vincent Price’s final onscreen roles before his 1993 death was as the enigmatic Inventor in Tim Burton’s fantasy Edward Scissorhands. Price’s casting immediately invoked classic horror tones, recalling his history portraying mad scientist types. The Inventor puts a modern twist on this trope, ingeniously creating Edward. However, he perishes prematurely, leaving his &#34;son&#34; tragically incomplete but ready to face the world. Price’s pedigree enriches the character’s importance early on. Originally conceived as a more substantial role, Burton was forced to scale back the Inventor’s presence given Price’s ailing health. However, he remained committed to retaining the actor he considered his cinematic father figure, perhaps as an homage.
The reduced, but still critical, appearance allowed Price to impart his special wisdom while conserving his energies. Considered the best collaboration of the duo, Price presents the Inventor as an avatar reflecting Burton’s bittersweet reverence. Relative to collaborations like Vincent where Price voiced a literal homage, Edward Scissorhands utilized him more organically and metaphorically. While there are things about Edward Scissorhands that don’t make sense, Price sanctioned Burton’s eccentric visual voice, much like the Inventor unleashes Edward’s destiny. While Price enjoyed more screen time elsewhere, his sublime role as the Inventor carried profound emotional weight. It marked their last intersection before Burton graduated from protégé to icon.
Although his screen time was shorter than planned, his farewell as a wise creator tapping Burton&#39;s imagination left an immense impact. Price passed the torch one last time before his imminent death. In his role as the Inventor, audiences glimpsed faded echoes of Price&#39;s history portraying tortured visionaries. However, his final performance infused sweetness with anguish, creating a touching culmination. Beyond its narrative impact, his fading presence behind the scenes made Burton&#39;s gothic fairytale eulogistic. Like the Inventor never witnessing Edward&#39;s full potential, Price&#39;s abbreviated collaboration added poignancy to a fitting curtain call, making Edward Scissorhands a bittersweet tribute.
