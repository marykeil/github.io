## Literature Review

New images from Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire reveal key looks at teams new and old, revealing Egon&#39;s replacement for the original team as well.




New images from Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire reveal a closer look at the movie&#39;s teams, including how one original character will be replacing Egon on the older team. The movie will bring Ghostbusters new and old together to stop a formidable entity named the Death Chill from enacting a second Ice Age. A sequel to Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the new movie will follow the continued adventures of both iconic teams.




Now, Empire Magazine has released covers for their upcoming issue, featuring the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire&#39;s returning cast in their respective teams.


 

One of the covers reveals Janine suiting up alongside the original team, filling in Egon&#39;s role. This emphasizes how every key character in the film will have a major part to play in the new story.


 Why It Makes Sense For Janine To Suit Up In Frozen Empire 
          

Janine suiting up in the newest movie makes sense, as it rounds out the older team with a set of familiar characters. Having been in all of the major releases of the series so far, her inclusion on the field is a proper follow-up to Ghostbusters: Afterlife&#39;s ending. Now that there are two teams of ghost hunters in the franchise, any number of characters could pick up the mantle to continue battling entities that threaten the world.




As the newest member of the team taking to the field, she will be an integral part of stopping the Death Chill from turning the world to ice. It also means she&#39;ll have an expanded role in the film, having previously appeared in the latest movie to help propel the story of its younger newcomers. Her connection between both teams can help them as they team up to take on their new, nefarious foe.

                  Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire Can&#39;t Repeat The Franchise&#39;s Biggest Mistake For 1 Returning Character   The upcoming Ghostbusters movie, Frozen Empire, has the opportunity to remedy a repeated failure from the previous films in the franchise.   

With Janine now a major part of the team, it seems the threat in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will be the biggest ever shown in the series. Because she&#39;s now suited up to take it on, it&#39;s possible she will have an integral role in keeping New York City safe. With more about the film likely to be revealed before it comes out, it won&#39;t be long until more context is added to her part to play.






Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire arrives in theaters on March 22, 2024.
