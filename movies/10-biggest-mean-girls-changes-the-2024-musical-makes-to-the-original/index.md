20 years after it was first released, Mean Girls is back in theaters, but this time as a musical, and as it turns out, that is not the only big change that the 2024 movie has to offer compared to the original 2004 film. Mean Girls is a 2024 movie musical that is adapted from the 2004 comedy film Mean Girls and the 2017 Broadway musical, Mean Girls. Furthermore, all three of these are inspired by the 2002 book, &#34;Queen Bees and Wannabes&#34; by Rosalind Wiseman. The story follows Cady Heron, a teenage girl who gets entangled with the most popular girl in her new school, Regina George.
In general, the announcement of 2024&#39;s Mean Girls was met with excitement, but also some confusion. Based on the first trailer that was dropped, it wasn&#39;t entirely clear that the movie was a musical, which made it seem like a plain old reboot. This seemed strange considering that the original Mean Girls came out only 20 years ago. However, now that Mean Girls has hit theaters, it is clear that this film is truly different, not only because of its musical status and Mean Girls 2024 soundtrack, but also because of the various changes it makes to the story as a whole.









 








 10  Cady&#39;s Dad Is Not Part Of Mean Girls 2024

One change from Mean Girls 2004 to Mean Girls 2024 is the removal of Cady&#39;s dad from the movie. In the original film, Cady was shown to have a mother and a father, with the father being played by Neil Flynn. However, in the movie musical, Cady only has a mom, portrayed by The Office&#39;s Jenna Fischer. This change can be attributed to the fact that Mean Girls 2024 is adapting the Broadway musical version of the story, and in the on-stage adaptation, Cady does not have a father either. In general, this change has little effect on the film as a whole.





 9  Ms. Norbury &amp; Principal Duvall Are Married In Mean Girls 2024

A more fun and meta change that occurs in Mean Girls 2024 is that Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall are married. In the original film, Norbury and Duvall are seen tentatively flirting, however, in the 2024 version, they are married. This is revealed during the scene when the female students of North Shore High are gathered in the gym and made to apologize to each other after the Burn Book is revealed. Duvall pleads with Norbury to take over, and promises that he will walk the dog when they get home. This change is made even better by the fact that Tina Fey and Tim Meadows reprise their roles.





 8  Mean Girls 2024 Has More Modern References &amp; Dialogue 
Mean Girls 2024 updated their language and references
        

Mean Girls 2024 did make some larger, more overarching changes to the story, and the dialogue and references are one of those differences. Because the original Mean Girls was made in 2004, there were many pieces of dialogue that were tweaked for today&#39;s audiences. In particular, certain insults written in the Burn Book were changed, such as &#34;fat virgin&#34; being changed to &#34;horny shrimp.&#34; Furthermore, the film added more modern references, such as Damian singing the iCarly theme song in French for the Winter Talent Show.





 7  Cady Isn&#39;t Grounded For The Burn Book

Another small change that Mean Girls 2024 makes is that Cady does not end up being grounded for the Burn Book. Instead, she receives three weeks of suspension. Arguably, this is a much worse punishment, and also, it changes her dynamic with school. Because Cady is suspended rather than grounded, she does not see any of her schoolmates for a stretch, giving her plenty of time alone to reflect on her actions. This is portrayed very well in a scene between Cady and her mom on the night before she is supposed to return. Ultimately, it makes Cady&#39;s return to North Shore High all the more dramatic.





 6  Mean Girls 2024 Has A More Diverse Cast

One important and overarching change from 2004&#39;s Mean Girls to 2024&#39;s is the cast. While Mean Girls 2004 had a mostly white cast, Mean Girls 2024 refreshed the story by creating a more diverse cast. For example, Janis Ian became Janis &#39;Imi&#39;ke, Karen Smith became Karen Shetty, and Gretchen Weiners hints at her Latinx heritage when she mentions a music box that her &#34;abuelo&#34; gave her. Ultimately, these changes are not pivotal to the plot, but they create a more realistic and interesting environment which may affect Mean Girls 2024&#39;s positive reviews.





 5  Janis &amp; Regina&#39;s Origin Story Is Changed In Mean Girls 2024 
Mean Girls 2024 updates Janis &amp; Regina&#39;s rivalry
        

A change that may seem subtle, but was absolutely necessary, was changing the origin story of Janis and Regina&#39;s dislike for each other. According to 2004&#39;s Mean Girls, Janis and Regina stopped being friends simply because Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian. However, 2024&#39;s Mean Girls deepens the story by having Regina kiss Janis during a spin-the-bottle game, then make fun of her behind her back with a toy that Janis gave her. Furthermore, Janis lit the toy on fire. This extended story makes Regina even crueler and avoids condemning Janis&#39; sexuality.





 4  Mean Girls 2024 Explores Cady&#39;s Life In Africa More

One particularly welcome change in Mean Girls 2024 was including more details about Cady&#39;s life in Africa. While Mean Girls 2004 uses Cady&#39;s move from Africa simply as a plot device to make her seem clueless, Mean Girls 2024 brings it up often in order to show Cady&#39;s feelings of isolation, and also, her intelligence. The movie uses Cady&#39;s knowledge of natural life, such as apex predators, as a comparison to high school dynamics. Overall, this helped make Cady&#39;s move from Africa not feel ridiculous, and additionally, made Cady&#39;s character more interesting.





 3  Social Media Was Added To Mean Girls 2024

Another major change to Mean Girls 2024 was the addition of social media. In order to bring Mean Girls into the 2020s, the film adds aspects of social media to the story to show how public opinion could rapidly change on Regina George and Cady. For example, the movie uses aspects of TikTok to show how certain characters are feeling or how the plot is progressing. Ultimately, this was a fun change that was not only realistic in this day and age, but also added a multimedia element to the film that is still quite new to the movie industry.





 2  Mean Girls 2024 Changed The Jingle Bell Rock Dance 
The Plastics perform Rockin Around the Pole
        

While Mean Girls 2024 kept most plot points the same, the one significant change was the Jingle Bell Rock dance. In the original film, the Plastics and Cady perform a sexy dance to Jingle Bell Rock which sees Gretchen mess up the moves and kick the boombox, while Cady saves the day by singing the rest of the song. Meanwhile, in Mean Girls 2024, the girls dance to &#34;Rockin&#39; Around the Pole,&#34; and the dance is ruined when Regina falls out of an acrobatic stunt. This change made Regina&#39;s downfall more obvious while maintaining the comedy of the moment.





 1  Mean Girls 2024 Doesn&#39;t Show What Happened After The Dance 
Mean Girls 2024 ends at the Spring Fling
        

Finally, one of the last changes that Mean Girls 2024 made was not showing what happens after the Spring Fling dance. At the end of Mean Girls 2004, it is revealed that Regina joins the lacrosse team, Karen becomes the school weather reporter, and Aaron graduates and is dating Cady. However, at the end of Mean Girls 2024, there is no sneak peek into the future. It is unclear why this decision was made, but in some ways, it is a good thing. Audiences can decide on their own what happens to the characters.
