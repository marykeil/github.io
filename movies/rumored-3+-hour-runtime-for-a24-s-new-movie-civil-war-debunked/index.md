## Literature Review



Despite rumors of a runtime that was over 3 hours long, A24&#39;s upcoming action movie Civil War has had a much shorter runtime revealed. The movie was previously listed on IMDb as being 3 hours and 15 minutes long. This indicated the movie would be a thorough exploration of a dystopian version of the United States with multiple sides at war with each other.




Now, Variety has confirmed the real runtime of A24&#39;s upcoming Civil War is not 3 hours, 15 minutes as previously reported. The actual runtime of the film clocks in at 1 hour, 49 minutes. This means the story being provided will be much shorter than originally anticipated.


 Everything We Know About Civil War 
          

The upcoming war film is directed by Alex Garland, best known for making sci-fi horror movies like Ex Machina and Annihilation. His latest movie focuses on a group of journalists documenting a growing civil war within the United States, while extremists commit acts of terrorism against one another&#39;s groups. Despite being an action movie, the concept will no doubt tap into Garland&#39;s brand of horror, making for a nightmarish experience throughout.

While the cause of Civil War&#39;s conflict remains unclear, the characters featured throughout the movie will no doubt add context to the situation. Stars include Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation), Wagner Moura (Narcos), Cailee Spaeny (Priscilla), and Jesse Plemons (Killers of the Flower Moon). Given the talented cast behind the film, their performances can reflect just how war-torn the nation has become.

With plenty of mystery still surrounding the movie, it appears Civil War will offer but a glimpse into the war-torn nation of its universe. Now that the runtime has been confirmed, it seems like the film will be making sure to use every minute wisely for the sake of an impactful story. The movie&#39;s subject matter may also attract a wide audience, especially now that it&#39;s clear it won&#39;t require viewers to remain in a theater for very long.



Civil War will be released in theaters on April 26, 2024.
