## Literature Review

What&#39;s the best South Korean zombie movie? There may be more contenders than most fans realize. Here are the top 10.




South Korea&#39;s growing movie industry covers a wide range of genres including horror, leading to a number of great South Korean zombie movies. Hitting the mainstream in the 1960s with George A. Romero&#39;s The Night of the Living Dead, zombie movies are a stable of the horror genre. The zombie genre as a whole hasn&#39;t lost popularity as the years have gone on, with TV shows like All of Us are Dead and The Walking Dead keeping zombies on the screen. However, South Korea is also playing a big role in showing there is still life in the subgenre on the big screen.
Considering much of Korean horror is based on mythology and folklore, the best South Korean zombie movies often have a different spin on the undead than the typical zombie fare that comes out of the West. Nonetheless, this results in some truly terrifying films with imagery that will stick with audiences long after viewing. From anthologies to whole epic features, there may be more examples of South Korean zombie movies than most fans may necessarily realize.

Directed by Kok and Sun Kim, Ambulance on the Death Zone features a little girl who morphs into a mouth-foaming zombie after succumbing to an unknown infection.

An Animated Prequel To Train To Busan
        

Directed by Train to Busan&#39;s Sang-ho Yeon and released the same year, Seoul Station is an animated feature-length zombie movie that serves as a prequel to the live-action horror hit.

It&#39;s an interesting chapter in the story of modern South Korean zombie movies that audiences who enjoyed Train to Busan definitely need to check out, taking a refreshing approach to the set-up and adding more lore to Sang-ho Yeon&#39;s sprawling tale.

Shaun of the Dead has made zombie comedies a big part of the genre and one of South Korea&#39;s best attempts at this is The Odd Family: Zombie on Sale (sometimes simply titled Zombie for Sale), directed by Lee Min-Jae, which adds a memorable degree of quirkiness into the mix.

 #Alive 


  Release Date    September 8, 2020     Director    Il Cho     Cast    Yoo Ah-in , Park Shin-Hye , Jeon Bae-soo , Hyun-Wook Lee     Runtime    1h 38m

The story finds a densely populated building under siege from a vicious zombie incursion borne from an unknown virus and follows Oh Joon-Wo (Ah-In Yoo), a secluded gamer who must remain hunkered down in his apartment and fend off droves of home-invading zombies.
The very positive critics&#39; consensus on Rotten Tomatoes praises the acting, the horror, and the comedy, showing that Train to Busan wasn&#39;t a one-off.

 4  Doomsday Book (2012) 
A Zombie Story Within A Satirical Horror Anthology
        

A viral zombie pandemic is given a satirical edge in one chapter of Doomsday Book, a three-part horror omnibus from directors Kim-Jee Woon and Pil-sung Yim. In Yim&#39;s tale, A Brave New World, a nerdy scientist throws a contaminated apple in the garbage disposal, which in turn makes its way into the feeding trough for local cows.
The beef becomes contaminated and eaten by a man at a barbecue, setting off an infectious chain of violent zombification. It&#39;s worth noting that popular Korean filmmakers such as Bong Joon-Ho have cameos in the film, so it&#39;s a must-see for die-hard fans of modern Korean movies, not just zombie enthusiasts. Doomsday Book won the Cheval Noir award at the 2012 Fantasia Festival and was also nominated for a Visual Effects accolade at the Asian Film Awards.

 3  Peninsula (2020) 
A Sequel Within The Train To Busan Universe
        

Despite massive interest from movie fans, Peninsula is rated lower than its breakout predecessor, Train to Busan. Both films are directed by Sang-ho Yeon, but this sequel failed to live up to the standards set by the first film. That being said, it&#39;s still one of the best South Korean zombie movies.
Jung Seok (Dong-Won Gang) is an ex-soldier who accepts a mission to lead his squadron into the wastelands of the South Korean Peninsula to obtain a truck full of cash only to be greeted by hordes of the movie series&#39; terrifying undead. Audiences who liked the original will welcome the return of the zombie action. Peninsula was nominated for five accolades at the Chunsa Film Arts Awards, winning Best Technical Award for the film&#39;s production designers.

  The Wailing

While Hong-jin Na&#39;s masterful horror/thriller The Wailing has a lot more going on in it than just zombie movie influences, there&#39;s no denying the terror conjured by the zombified, demonically-possessed ghouls in the film. More in the vein of dark cop thrillers like Se7en than a zombie romp by George A. Romero, The Wailing tracks a series of supernatural occurrences that plague a small fishing town after the arrival of a mysterious stranger, and it&#39;s one of the best South Korean zombie movies of all time.
A viral illness begins to spread throughout the hamlet, thought to be a result of an evil spirit in the region. It&#39;s up to local police officer Jong-goo (Do-wan Kwak) to solve the mystery with the story&#39;s eye-watering mixture of strong cultural and genre elements making for an unforgettably bold cocktail. The Wailing sits above not just most modern zombie movies, but most modern horror movies in general. The horror film has 30 awards to its name, garnering accolades from the Blue Dragon Film Awards, the Fantasia International Film Festival, and the Asian Film Awards (among many others).
