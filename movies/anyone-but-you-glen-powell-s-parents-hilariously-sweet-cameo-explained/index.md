## Literature Review

Rom-com Anyone but You stars Glen Powell but also features his parents in a short but funny cameo that the movie star is very proud of.




Anyone but You stars Glen Powell, but his parents managed to make their way on set for a quick scene with their son. A romantic comedy inspired by Much Ado About Nothing, Anyone but You is a 2023 movie starring Powell and Sydney Sweeney. Bea (Sweeney) and Ben (Powell) are two young city dwellers whose past meet-cute ended in a bad date. But when Bea&#39;s sister and Ben&#39;s friend get engaged, the pair is forced to spend time together. The film has a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes and while it isn&#39;t breaking new ground, it&#39;s a delightful old-school rom-com that thankfully ended up in theaters rather than on a streamer.




More than anything, this film showcases that Powell is coming into his own as a true movie star and may be the next big thing. After Everybody Wants Some!!, Devotion, Top Gun: Maverick, and now Anyone but You, it&#39;s never been more evident that Powell is often the most interesting part of any movie, whether that be comedy, romance, or action. While Powell isn&#39;t the only cast member of Anyone but You worth seeing the film for, his performance is particularly winning. And he&#39;s not the only Powell whom the camera likes, as his parents make a sweet cameo in the movie alongside their famous son.

                  Anyone But You Ending Explained: Do Ben &amp; Bea End Up Together?   Ben and Bea fake being in love in Anyone But You, and the movie&#39;s ending shakes up their lives in Glen Powell and Sydney Sweeney&#39;s rom-com.   


 Glen Powell&#39;s Parents Cameoed In The Anyone But You Airplane Scene 
          




Glen Powell&#39;s parents cameo in Anyone but You early in the film when Bea and Ben discover that they will be spending a lot of time together on the wedding weekend they&#39;re flying to. On the flight, Ben and Bea are sat next to each other and when Bea&#39;s shirt snags on the seat, she and Ben have a ridiculous physical comedy scene as Bea inappropriately crawls over Ben to release her clothing. Sitting next to the pair, completely oblivious, is Powell&#39;s father snoring away. Of his father&#39;s performance, Glen Powell told EW:



&#34;The funniest part about that scene in general is that my dad&#39;s the real method actor. He&#39;s stone-cold asleep. I&#39;m sitting there as Sydney is trying to do gymnastics over my face and quite often slipping and falling onto me, and I&#39;m having to not break. Whereas my dad, he&#39;s the Daniel Day-Lewis of sleep acting. There was not a false beat in that performance.&#34;




Also in the Anyone but You airplane scene is Glen Powell&#39;s mother, who is sitting across the aisle, thoroughly amused by the antics of Ben and Bea. Though she doesn&#39;t say a word, the look on her face says plenty, and Glen compares it to a famous romantic comedy:






&#34;My mom is across the aisle and gets the &#34;I&#39;ll have what she&#39;s having&#34; When Harry Met Sally moment. She gets an iconic look in that scene. She came in and killed it. I was very proud of both of them in that scene.&#34;






Anyone but You is currently only playing in theaters but will premiere on streaming on Apple TV&#43; at an undisclosed date.






 Powell Had Top Gun: Maverick Hangdad and Hangmom Jackets Made For His Parents 
          

Glen Powell came to major mainstream attention for his role as Lieutenant Jake &#34;Hangman&#34; Seresin in Top Gun: Maverick. He essentially plays the Tom &#34;Iceman&#34; Kazansky (Val Kilmer) to &#34;Rooster&#34; Bradshaw&#39;s (Miles Teller) Maverick (Tom Cruise). Hangman is the antagonistic rival to Rooster but ends up supporting his teammate by the end of the movie. Once again, Glen included his family in the movie and seems to have gifted his mother and father matching &#34;Hangman&#34; Topgun jackets to go along with the one he has in the movie.





 


 

Of course, these versions say &#34;Hangmom&#34; and &#34;Hangdad&#34; respectively. Glen Powell&#39;s work as an actor appears to be a family affair for the young talent, who often posts pictures of his mother and father and seems more than glad to include them in his movies whenever he has the chance. Hollywood can be a difficult career path, so it&#39;s charming and uplifting to know that Glen has such a strong support system he&#39;s close with, as he continues to be one of the industry&#39;s leading men in movies like Anyone but You.
