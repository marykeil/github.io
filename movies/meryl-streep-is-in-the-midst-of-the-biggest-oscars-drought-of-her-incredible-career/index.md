# Meryl Streep Is In The Midst Of The Biggest Oscars Drought Of Her Incredible Career


## SUMMARY 



  Meryl Streep, a highly accomplished actor, has experienced her longest drought in Oscar nominations, despite being a perennial contender.   Her frequent nominations in the past have made every new performance of hers a potential contender for Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress.   Streep&#39;s current Oscar nomination drought has lasted six years and may continue, as she is not attached to any upcoming movies with 2024 release dates. However, the drought might work in her favor, as voters could be more likely to reward her after a few years without a nomination.

## Literature Review

Meryl Streep is typically a perennial contender for the Oscars, but the actress is in the midst of the biggest drought of her incredible career.




Meryl Streep is one of the most accomplished actors in Oscars history, but she&#39;s currently in the midst of her longest drought. Throughout the course of her incredible career, Streep became a perennial contender at the Academy Awards. It became quite common for her to be present at the ceremony as she was nominated in back-to-back years for The Deer Hunter and Kramer vs. Kramer. This marked the beginning of a rather spectacular run for Meryl Streep at the Oscars where she received nine more nominations before the end of the 1990s. She has remained a strong presence for the awards show throughout the 2000s.




The frequency at which Meryl Streep is nominated for Oscars means that every new performance she has typically becomes part of the Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress races to some degree. Her talents have not diminished, and her place in Hollywood has only grown. She earned six nominations throughout the 2010s, as well as her third Oscar win, getting one step closer to matching Katharine Hepburn&#39;s Oscars record. After receiving nominations for Florence Foster Jenkins and The Post in consecutive years, though, Meryl Streep&#39;s place at the Academy Awards has taken a surprising turn and started a historic drought for her.

 Meryl Streep&#39;s 6 Years Without An Oscar Nomination Is Her Longest Streak 
          




Meryl Streep&#39;s last Oscar nomination came in 2018 with The Post. Six years have now passed since one of her performances was recognized by the Academy. Streep was thought to be a contender for more Oscar nominations during this time. Her role in Mary Poppins Returns could have sparked a Best Supporting Actress nomination, and so too could have her appearance in Little Women. The last time Streep was eligible for an Oscar nomination was in 2022 with Don&#39;t Look Up. She has not made any movies in the last two years and is ineligible for a 2024 Oscar nomination.

The longest Oscar nomination drought that Meryl Streep experienced before right now came during the 1990s. She was absent from four consecutive Academy Awards between nominations in 1991 for Postcards from the Edge and 1996 for The Bridges of Madison County. Streep was able to avoid a similarly large drought for over two decades from that point forward. However, by not earning any other Oscar nominations after The Post, the legendary actress is now in unfamiliar territory when it comes to missing out on being part of the awards show.






 When Will Meryl Streep&#39;s Oscar Nomination Drought End? 
          

The unfortunate truth for Meryl Streep is that her Oscar nomination drought might not come to an end anytime soon. She will not be among the Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress races in 2024, which confirms the drought will last six full years. Streep is also not confirmed to be attached to any upcoming movies with 2024 release dates. That means she might also miss out on being part of the 2025 Oscars races. There is a chance that her Oscars drought will work to her advantage, though, as voters could be more likely to reward Meryl Streep with another nomination after missing her for a few years.
