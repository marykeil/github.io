## Literature Review

The John Wick franchise becomes massively successful on Netflix, with the first three films all making it into the platform&#39;s Top 10 chart in the US.




The John Wick movies overwhelm Netflix’s United States Top 10 list. The franchise originated a decade ago with 2014’s John Wick. Since then, there have been four feature films total in the main franchise, with 2023’s critically acclaimed John Wick: Chapter 4 being the most recent big screen release.




Now, the John Wick franchise dominates Netflix’s domestic Top 10 chart, with three out of the four movies winding up on the list. John Wick, John Wick: Chapter 2, and John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum came in at no. 6, no. 9, and no. 8, respectively, for the United States for the week of January 1 through January 7. Topping the list this week were The Equalizer 3 and Aquaman.


 Why The Sudden Netflix Renaissance For The John Wick Franchise? 
         

John Wick’s massive showing on the Netflix chart is a feat for any franchise, as it is hard to get even one film in the Top 10 from the thousands of titles that the streamer offers. This success could be due in part to the trends of this week’s list overall. Including the three John Wick titles, six of the slots on the United States Top 10 chart went to franchise action films, with the other three being The Equalizer 3, Aquaman, and The Meg 2: The Trench. Any of these could have cued John Wick as a recommendation in users’ algorithms, thus contributing to the franchise&#39;s success.




Further adding to the renaissance of John Wick is the active continuation of the franchise throughout the last year. 2023 saw the release of not only John Wick: Chapter 4, but the spinoff TV series The Continental: From the World of John Wick, which aired three movie-length episodes in the fall. Thus, John Wick content is still actively being made, a fact which could be a potential driver for viewers to re-explore the previous installments.

The Netflix success of the first three John Wick movies bodes well for the franchise as it prepares for another release this year. This June, the franchise will see the release of Ballerina, a John Wick spinoff that will star Ana de Armas as a female assassin. Hopefully, the franchise’s strong start to 2024 will be a harbinger of success for Ballerina as the next entry in the John Wick franchise.
