The appearance of Sid&rsquo;s signature shirt on a skeleton in the Land of the Dead implies that he died and ended up in the afterlife.   Toy Story 5 could potentially confirm or debunk the theory about Sid&rsquo;s fate.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>A dark Pixar theory suggests that a different movie confirmed that one Toy Story villain died decades after the original movie. The Toy Story franchise is best known for exploring the friendship between Woody and Buzz Lightyear, their relationship with Andy and Bonnie, and some heavier thematic ideas. The four films, or five if Lightyear is considered part of the series, might seem as though they are entirely disconnected from the rest of Pixar&rsquo;s movies. However, the popularity of the Pixar shared universe theory and the studio&rsquo;s penchant for including Easter eggs to its various films with each new release create some fun connections.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of popular Toy Story theories based on what the four main films have included. While most of the references to the popular franchise in other Pixar movies are quite inconsequential, not every Easter egg should be easily overlooked. There are rare cases where the connections not only could be more important but could confirm major details about what has transpired in the Toy Story franchise off-screen. This is particularly true when it comes to one of the Easter eggs in Coco and the implications it has on the bigger Pixar franchise if it is meant to be more than just a fun reference.</p>
<p>Coco Easter Egg Connects To Toy Story&rsquo;s Villain Sid</p>
<p>Released in 2017, Coco features the usual amount of Pixar Easter eggs, and that, unsurprisingly, means a few connections to Toy Story. This includes seeing piñatas of Woody, Buzz, and other characters from the franchise. One of the other Easter eggs that audiences may have missed connects to the Toy Story franchise&rsquo;s original villain, Sid. The kid who lives next door to Andy is synonymous with wearing a black shirt with a white skull logo on it. The exact same shirt, albeit infused with a bit of Spanish design, is featured in Coco, but the movie stops short of confirming this is Sid.</p>
<p>Coco&rsquo;s Sid Easter egg comes as part of the sequence where Miguel and Hectór enter a talent competition in the hopes of winning an invitation to Ernesto de la Cruz&rsquo;s Day of the Dead party. Before it is their turn to perform, several other people from the Land of the Dead take the stage to perform themselves. This includes a brief glimpse of a man wearing Sid&rsquo;s usual shirt while sporting glasses and a Skrillex-esque haircut. That is a very different appearance than the original Toy Story villain, but that does not mean the Easter egg is completely disconnected from Sid.</p>
<p>Theory: Coco Confirms Sid Died After Toy Story</p>
<p>The working theory, thanks to Coco&rsquo;s Easter egg, is that this is confirmation that Sid died after Toy Story. This is due to how his signature shirt appears in the movie. Instead of a living human being wearing Sid&rsquo;s shirt during any scenes set in the real world, it is worn by a skeleton in the Land of the Dead. Coco firmly establishes that this afterlife location is the final destination for spirits after someone has died, matching the Mexican beliefs and culture that the movie is firmly rooted in. This means that anyone who is in the Land of the Dead is someone who died in the real world.</p>
<p>Instead of the Coco Easter egg just being a quick reference to one of Pixar&rsquo;s biggest villains, the theory suggests that this dead spirit is actually Sid. Due to the brevity of this potential Sid cameo, there is no further information that Pixar&rsquo;s 2017 animated movie provides about how Sid could have died. His appearance is slightly different, which would make sense after how much time has passed since the original movie. The Toy Story movie timeline has mostly progressed in real-time, so if Coco takes place in 2017, this could be a glimpse of Sid in his late 20s or early 30s, depending on his time of death.</p>

<p>What Does &amp; Does Not Work About Coco&rsquo;s Sid Death Theory
Close</p>
<p>Since the idea that Sid died after Toy Story is only a theory born from Coco, there are elements to it that work nicely and others that create complications. Pixar seemingly last provided a glimpse into Sid&rsquo;s life during Toy Story 3. The sequel showed a garbage truck driver wearing his signature shirt who works in Andy&rsquo;s neighborhood. The Easter egg has been taken to be a reveal about what happened to Sid after Toy Story. The Coco death theory could work with this detail, as Sid could have died after the events of the movie, whether that be on the job or through some other means.</p>
<p>One potential issue that comes from the dark Pixar theory is why Sid is in the Land of the Dead afterlife at all. The Day of the Dead holiday is specifically connected to Mexican culture and families, but there is no indication that Sid is of Hispanic descent in the Toy Story movies. The best explanation is that the Land of the Dead shown in Coco is the actual afterlife in the Pixar shared universe and applies to all people who have died. Otherwise, why Sid is in the Mexican afterlife would not make total sense, especially since he was not from or lived in Mexico as far as Toy Story showed.</p>
<p>Toy Story 5 Could Confirm Or Debunk Sid&rsquo;s Fate</p>
<p>The truth of Sid&rsquo;s fate could be confirmed years after Coco depending on what Toy Story 5 includes. There is a chance that Pixar will use the fifth installment of the franchise to provide an update on the original villain&rsquo;s life. If he is dead as the Coco theory suggests, then some reflection on what happened to the franchise&rsquo;s original villain could come. It would be quite strange for Woody or Buzz to discuss his fate as they likely never encountered him again. However, reports that Andy returns in Toy Story 5 could come with him mentioning what happened to his former neighbor, confirming his tragic passing if that happened.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that Toy Story 5 could debunk the theory and confirm Sid is still alive and well. This could happen through a line of dialogue or even seeing Sid again, this time as an adult, possibly with a kid of his own even. Learning that Sid is alive would mean that this Pixar theory Coco created is not accurate and is merely an example of fan speculation turning an Easter egg into something more. However, the tragic Toy Story theory is still plausible in the meantime.</p>
