# The Rebel Alliance Found The Weirdest Use For Ewoks After Return Of The Jedi


## SUMMARY 



  After the Battle of Endor, some Ewoks became therapy creatures for the Rebel Alliance veterans.   The Ewoks scattered across the galaxy after the Battle of Endor, potentially appearing outside of Endor.   While Ewoks may not seem like ideal therapy companions, their bravery and skills in battle are undeniable.

## Literature Review

The Rebel Alliance in Star Wars used Ewoks in the strangest yet most adorable way after Return of the Jedi, and it is absolutely hilarious.




After Return of the Jedi, the Rebel Alliance put Ewoks to use in the weirdest way. While not the last battle against the Empire in Star Wars, the Battle of Endor was the victory that truly turned the tide for the Rebel Alliance. The destruction of the second Death Star and the deaths of Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader signaled the beginning of the end for the Galactic Empire.




The native inhabitants of the forest moon Endor, the Ewoks, played a key role in the Battle of Endor. These deceptively cute creatures can hold their own against any enemy that comes their way. Their culture is quite primitive and lacking in technological understanding, to the point that they believed C-3PO was a deity. However, this doesn&#39;t stop them from being a formidable enemy. They helped the Rebel Alliance fight the Imperial presence on their home world just as much as the rebels helped them. As it turns out, this alliance continued after the Battle of Endor.

 After Return Of The Jedi, The Rebels Had... Therapy Ewoks 
          




While Star Wars canon spared Endor from falling Death Star debris, after the Rebel Alliance helped them fight to defend their home world, some Ewoks felt indebted to them. According to Chuck Wendig&#39;s canon Aftermath trilogy, many of the Ewoks left Endor and ended up working as essentially therapy creatures. One was offered to a Rebel Alliance veteran, Dade, after he rejected taking home a therapy droid. However, after learning that his only other option was taking home a therapy Ewok, he ultimately chose the droid. What they do exactly as therapy Ewoks isn&#39;t made clear.



 Therapy Ewoks Mean The Ewoks Have Scattered Across The Galaxy 
          

Since Ewoks are tribal, it can be assumed that before Return of the Jedi, they didn&#39;t live anywhere but Endor. The Aftermath series, however, confirms that they scattered across the galaxy after the final installment of the original trilogy. This means that viewers could see their return to the Star Wars universe outside of Endor if, for example, the Republic of Rey&#39;s day also uses therapy Ewoks. After all, given how they fought the stormtroopers on Endor, it seems unlikely the First Order would&#39;ve succeeded in getting rid of the Ewoks even if they tried.




Using Ewoks for therapy is an odd choice, to say the least. While they may look like adorable, fuzzy teddy bears, the Battle of Endor proved that they are anything but. These gutsy little creatures managed to trip speeder bikes and kill stormtroopers with ropes, nets, and handcrafted wooden spears. They tried to roast Han Solo and Luke Skywalker alive and were only convinced to stop through the combined trickery of C-3PO and Luke. As such, Return of the Jedi&#39;s iconic creatures don&#39;t seem like they would make very good therapeutic companions.
