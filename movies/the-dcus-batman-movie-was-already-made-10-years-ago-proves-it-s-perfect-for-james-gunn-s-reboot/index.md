## Literature Review

A previous movie proves that Batman: The Brave and the Bold will be a highly compelling narrative that promises to expand Batmanâ€™s movie portrayals.




DCU&#39;s upcoming Batman: The Brave and the Bold will feature a similar plot to a previous Batman movie, which proves that it will be perfect for James Gunns&#39; DCU reboot. Though little is known about Batman: The Brave and the Bold, the little information proffered has indicated a likely storyline. It promises to establish a much broader adaptation of the Batman pantheon, which will have drastic outcomes in the DC Universe and the future of DC movies.




The DCEU timeline has officially concluded with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and will be rebooted with James Gunn at the helm. The first official movie in Gunn&#39;s DCU reboot will be the upcoming Superman: Legacy, which will be followed by a flurry of DC-related movies and television shows. Numerous Batman installments are planned, including a television series based on Arkham Asylum and a movie that will adapt a famed DC Comics story for the second time.

 Son Of Batman Followed A Similar Story To The Brave And The Bold&#39;s Plot Hints A Decade Ago 
          

It has been confirmed that James Gunn&#39;s DCU will adapt the Batman comics written by Grant Morrison. Morrison&#39;s tenure was best known for introducing Bruce Wayne&#39;s son - Damian Wayne. This story is confirmed for Batman: The Brave and the Bold, which will depict Batman mentoring his son to become his sidekick Robin. Interestingly, Morrison&#39;s story, &#34;Batman and Son,&#34; was previously adapted into an animated movie titled Son of Batman.




2014&#39;s Son of Batman offered a captivating story wherein Batman discovered he has a son with Talia al Ghul. The movie follows Batman&#39;s efforts to train and connect with his newfound heir. The movie seamlessly combined intense action sequences with the complex dynamics of family relationships. Son of Batman is a thrilling exploration of legacy, identity, and the challenges of parenthood within the superhero realm. The movie&#39;s effectiveness and success bode well for James Gunn&#39;s DCU interpretation and prove it will be ideal for the DCU.



 Why Son Of Batman Proves The DCU Dark Knight Movie Will Be Good 


 
Batman: The Brave and the Bold and Son of Batman share strikingly similar premises. The common thread lies in their ability to seamlessly integrate multiple Bat-Family characters into a cohesive narrative. Introducing an official version of Robin into the franchise will be a first since the infamous Joel Schumacher movies. Son of Batman demonstrated that this can be achieved effectively, and a movie can follow a different kind of Batman story that is prominent in the comics - one that explores Batman as a paternal figure. Son of Batman successfully balanced the complexities of familial relationships within the intense world of Gotham City.




It is a testament to the narrative versatility within the Batman universe, demonstrating that a rich ensemble of characters, coupled with engaging action sequences and formidable villains, can coexist without feeling overly crowded. By providing a platform for Batman and Damian to forge their distinctive journey, Son of Batman delivers a compelling exploration of legacy and identity, which will be ideal for the DCU reboot. The prospect of the wider Bat Family being included in future movies is particularly exciting for audiences who have been waiting for these classic characters to appear. Son of Batman demonstrates how this can be achieved with immense success in Batman: The Brave and the Bold.
