## Literature Review

Exit polls from select screenings of 2024&#39;s Mean Girls reveal that the majority of cinemagoers weren&#39;t deterred by the movie&#39;s musical format.




Paramount has revealed that a majority of cinemagoers who watched Mean Girls in select screenings approached the movie knowing it was a musical, according to exit polls. Mean Girls revisits Tina Fey&#39;s celebrated high-school comedy almost 20 years after audiences were introduced to the Plastics, adapting the original movie&#39;s stage musical adaptation to the big screen. ReneÃ© Rapp, Avantika Vandanapu, and Bebe Wood take on the roles of Prastic trio Regina George, Karen Shetty, and Gretchen Weiners, while Angourie Rice plays the new girl, Cady Herron.




Variety has reported that Paramount has taken a keen interest in whether viewers were aware of what genre of film the 2024 reimagining was before buying tickets. The studio conducted exit polling at select screenings where they asked viewers if they were aware of the remake being a musical and whether the genre had affected their opinion afterward. 75% of audiences were aware that the film was a musical and only 16% were left disappointed by the genre according to results, with Paramount&#39;s distribution chief Chris Aronson stating he felt that audiences were surely aware of the genre beforehand, while opening weekend numbers proved the film has resonated with audiences.


 Is Hollywood Preparing For A Musical Rennaisance? 
          

Paramount&#39;s interest in whether audiences are deterred by musicals comes following much discussion about whether the film industry is shying away from capitalizing on the genre. While later trailers for Mean Girls showed off more of its musical set pieces and Rapp&#39;s rendition of &#34;Meet The Plastics&#34;, earlier trailers and promotional materials for Warner Bros. Wonka seemingly avoided any implications of being musicals. However, it is possible that Paramount&#39;s polling could hint that they are listening to an underlying desire from audiences to see more.




                  Mean Girls 2024 Ending Explained   The new Mean Girls film is both an adaptation of the 2004 classic movie and the 2017 stage production, providing a new, updated ending for viewers.   

While musicals have seen limited releases over the 2010s and 2020s, discussions about whether audiences are interested in seeing them could indicate that studios are keen on seeing what trends could dominate the box offices for the next few years. With the rise of video-based social media platforms including TikTok, musical moments in movies and television have sparked viral trends that help raise further awareness for a property, as seen with Encanto, Barbie, and Saltburn, providing studios with new ways of reaching audiences. Should Mean Girls prove to be a success and have a successful run in theaters, studios may place more faith in the genre.

Between Wonka&#39;s box-office success and the positive reviews of Mean Girls, it is clear studios, including Paramount, are taking more of an interest in the genre. Across both the big screen and television, musical moments are becoming more frequent, and stand out as some of a project&#39;s most discussed points. With Paramount specifically highlighting whether audiences were swayed by Mean Girls being a musical, it shows that studios are keen on gauging whether viewers are willing to let the music play on.






Mean Girls 2024 is currently available in theaters.
