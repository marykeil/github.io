## Literature Review

The John Wick franchise is filled with memorable fight scenes, but these stand above the rest, and include some of the best action in modern cinema.




The John Wick franchise brings something special, innovative, and jaw-dropping to its action sequences with each new installment, and all four movies have at least a few stand-out fight scenes. John Wick successfully built upon itself, with each entry doing better both critically and financially, culminating in 2023&#39;s John Wick: Chapter 4, which seemingly saw an end to the character. While the franchise has continued on TV and in 2024&#39;s upcoming spin-off, Ballerina, the four-film saga of John Wick will be remembered for having some of the best action in modern Hollywood filmmaking.
What makes the fight scenes in John Wick stand out among other action films is their commitment to beautiful choreography, and using movement to communicate the story. The best fight scenes do more than just look visually engrossing; they also reveal core aspects of the characters, and in the best of cases, are surprisingly funny in how they can throw the titular hero around. As the four John Wick movies go on, the budgets get bigger, and so do the action scenes, but there are still incredible movements from the earlier films that stand out in the franchise.
John Wick (2014), John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), and John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019) are all available to stream on Netflix. John Wick: Chapter 4 is available to stream on Starz. 










 








 12  Berlin Club 
John Wick: Chapter 4


 







  John Wick: Chapter 4  


  Release Date    March 24, 2023     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Hiroyuki Sanada , Clancy Brown , Scott Adkins , Keanu Reeves , Ian McShane , Bill Skarsgard , Laurence Fishburne , Rina Sawayama , Donnie Yen , Lance Reddick , Shamier Anderson     Rating    R     Runtime    169 minutes     Writers    Shay Hatten , Michael Finch    


The fourth John Wick film expanded the franchise in almost every way, and included the most elaborate club scene in the franchise. In the sequence, John travels to Berlin to face off against Scott Adkins&#39; Killa, and the two fight in the middle of a watery rave. John Wick: Chapter 4&#39;s Adkins is a martial arts legend, and it is an absolute blast to see him get to play under heavy prosthetics and go up against the Boogeyman. The club&#39;s set design, along with the impressive number of extras, makes this the most impressive club scene in the series, even if it&#39;s not the best fight sequence of the whole franchise.





 11  Sofia And Casablanca 
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum
        

  John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum  


  Release Date    May 17, 2019     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Halle Berry , Mark Dacascos , Cecep Arif Rahman , Keanu Reeves , Angelica Huston , Yayan Ruhian , Laurence Fishburne , Jason Mantzoukas , Ian McShane , Asia Kate Dillon , Lance Reddick , Tiger Hu Chen     Rating    R     Runtime    131 minutes     Writers    Derek Kolstad     Story By    Derek Kolstad    


While Reeves has always been the centerpiece of the franchise, part of the fun of the later John Wick sequels is the other movie stars who get to stop by and show off their action skills. John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum included a memorable appearance by Halle Berry as the dog-loving assassin Sofia, and her action scene with John is a highlight of the film. The Oscar winner completely commits and is not only able to keep up with Reeves but also brings her own flair to the action, and hopefully, Berry will return to the John Wick franchise. The use of dogs in the fight also makes this scene a highlight of the film.





 10  Home Invasion 
John Wick
        

  John Wick  


  Release Date    October 24, 2014     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Michael Nyqvist , Willem Dafoe , Jason Isaacs , Keanu Reeves , Bridget Moynahan , Adrianne Palicki     Rating    R     Writers    Derek Kolstad    


Now a decade later, it is easy to forget how the first John Wick movie came out of seemingly nowhere. What first appeared to be a forgettable action movie turned out to be one of the most influential films of its time because of the incredible action. The first time audiences saw John Wick in action was a slick, exciting, and bare-bones shoot-out in his house that still gets the blood pumping today. While this first action scene may seem tame compared to how elaborate the sequels are, it is still an incredible introduction to the character of John, and the language of action cinema that these movies speak.







 9  The Mirror Room 
John Wick: Chapter 2
        

  John Wick: Chapter 2  


  Release Date    February 10, 2017     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    John Leguizamo , Ian McShane , Thomas Sadoski , Common , Keanu Reeves , David Patrick Kelly , Lance Reddick , Laurence Fishburne , Ruby Rose , Peter Stormare , Bridget Moynahan     Rating    R     Runtime    2h 2m     Writers    Derek Kolstad    


The best fight scenes in the John Wick movies often have an element that makes them feel impossible to pull off, and the hall of mirrors scene from John Wick: Chapter 2 is a marvel of cinematography and blocking. Not only does the endless line of reflections make the fights more intense and claustrophobic, but it is also a visual and technical marvel, as the characters seamlessly reflect off the walls. The filmmakers get plenty of mileage out of such a simple premise of a fight scene, making it among the most clever and memorable of the franchise.

 8  Car Fu 
John Wick: Chapter 4


 







While John Wick is mostly known for his gunplay and hand-to-hand combat, the films also see him using a variety of other tools to take out his enemies. From books to pencils to horses, John Wick can use just about anything as a weapon. Continuing this trend, the fourth film saw John speeding down the streets of Paris and using his damaged car as an extension of his body to fight off assassins. In a perfect blend of practical and digital effects, a car chase has never felt so fluid or so violent.





 7  Overhead Sequence 
John Wick: Chapter 4
        

Many of the fight scenes in John Wick feel like they have been ripped from a video game, but in the best possible way. One fight in the Paris section of John Wick: Chapter 4 especially felt like an overhead shooter, akin to the popular game Hotline Miami. As John uses a shotgun to clear out an apartment, the camera looms overhead watching the action from a bird&#39;s eye perspective. This sequence could have easily been cluttered or visually repetitive, but the camera work and clear blocking make the scene awe-inspiring, telling a complete story in one shot.







 6  The Catacombs 
John Wick: Chapter 2
        

John Wick: Chapter 2 is one of the best action sequels ever made because it knows what parts of the first movie could be expanded on, as well as how to make the story feel larger without sacrificing the charm of the original. John&#39;s escape from the catacombs in Chapter 2 is the perfect balance of the franchise, settling between the larger-than-life action of the latter two sequels, and the intimate gun-fu of the first movie. John uses an arsenal of powerful weapons to fight off a seemingly endless league of henchmen, all in the dark underground of a rave. It is the perfect standard for John Wick fights, but there are still some more impressive sequences from the franchise.





 5  The Stairs 
John Wick: Chapter 4


 







Humor is an underrated aspect of the John Wick franchise, as the series doesn&#39;t make Marvel-style quips or meta jokes, but instead lets the humor come naturally from the situations. In Chapter 4, after John fights his way to the top of the Montmartre stairs, he is kicked all the way down and has to make his way back up. John&#39;s fall down the stairs is equal parts wince-inducing as it is funny, as the stairs seemingly never end. It is a perfect blend of the clever wit of John Wick&#39;s action, without sacrificing the weight of the story or taking the audience out of the movie.





 4  The Red Circle Shoot Out 
John Wick
        

While the series may have gone bigger and bolder with the action later on, there is something magical about the original club shootout from the first John Wick, as it feels like a director and genre finding a new style and tempo. As Wick chases Alfie Allen&#39;s Iosef out of the spa and through the club, the tension builds and builds, and the electronic music builds with it. Not only is this the most iconic action scene from the first movie, but it&#39;s also one of the most influential film moments from all the 2010s. The John Wick franchise feels built off the legacy of the Red Circle fight scene, from the colors to the choreography and everything in-between.







 3  Silent Subway Fight 
John Wick: Chapter 2
        

The John Wick universe is filled with other deadly assassins, and some of the best moments in the films come from one-on-one fights. In Chapter 2, Common&#39;s Cassian and John are locked in a deadly shootout in a subway station but try not to disturb the other passengers. Silent bullets and dirty looks are fired across the terminal as the two men politely fight to the death. Another great use of humor, this is a purposefully subdued and casual fight scene that stands out among the franchise. While perhaps not as iconic as the Red Circle scene, it&#39;s among the greatest one-on-one fights in the franchise.





 2  Knife Store Fight 
John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum
        

The opening moments of John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum include some of the best action in the entire series, but the peak of this action spectacle is when John and a handful of assassins find themselves in a knife store. What starts as a standard John Wick fight escalates as the combatants continue to pull out an endless supply of edged weapons. It goes so far that it becomes comical, but in a way that still feels dangerous and inventive, as every new weapon becomes a challenge for John to overcome. It is a Buster Keaton-style gag designed as a brutal action scene, augmented by the distinct visual style of the franchise.

 1  The Osaka Continental 
John Wick: Chapter 4


 







Not only is John Wick: Chapter 4 the best of the series, but it opens with one of the best action sequences of all time. As the Osaka Continental is raided, John must fight his way out through countless assassins. Almost every character from the film converges at the hotel and is given an incredible moment of action and personality, especially musician Rina Sawayama as Akira, who almost steals the movie from this action scene alone. The beautiful neon lighting is just the cherry on top of what is the crown jewel of the John Wick franchise.
