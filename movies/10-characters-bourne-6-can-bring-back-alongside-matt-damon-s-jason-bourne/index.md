## Literature Review

Bourne 6 is officially in development at Universal, and aside from Matt Damon’s Jason Bourne, the upcoming film should feature old characters.




The Bourne franchise is expanding with a sixth film, as confirmed by Universal Pictures in 2023. Details surrounding the upcoming movie are unknown, including the story and cast. Reports claim that Universal wants Matt Damon to reprise his role as the titular character in the film series. But his return has yet to be confirmed, and negotiations with the actor are assumingly underway. The only thing that is certain about Jason Bourne 6 is that Edward Berger, known for helming All Quiet on the Western Front, will serve as the sequel&#39;s director. As for the hypothetical appearances of characters from the previous films (aside from Jason Bourne), that is still a mystery.
The Bourne franchise includes five movies (and one television show, Treadstone, that no one ever mentions) — The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, The Bourne Legacy, and Jason Bourne. The fifth film was seemingly set up as the last installment in the franchise (while still leaving the door open for a possible sequel). But Universal felt as if there were more stories to tell in the world of Jason Bourne, so a sixth movie is in development, and its plot could be about anything. It would be safe to say that if the studio wants Damon to return, more actors from previous projects are also probably being considered.









 








 10  Aaron Cross 
Appears in The Bourne Legacy


 







When Matt Damon decided not to return for the fourth Bourne film, the studio decided to create a new character, Aaron Cross, and make him the face of The Bourne Legacy. Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, has only appeared in the 2012 action thriller movie since Damon opted to reprise his role for the next installment. Bourne and Cross have yet to share a scene in the franchise, and while The Bourne Legacy certainly isn&#39;t the best film in the series, it would be interesting to see the two characters cross paths in the upcoming project.

 9  Heather Lee 
Appears in Jason Bourne
       Alicia Vikander and Tommy Lee Jones in Jason Bourne  

Alicia Vikander made her first (and only) appearance as Heather Lee in Jason Bourne, but she still left quite an impression on viewers. Lee was the Head of the CIA&#39;s Cyber Ops Division, and her true intentions were a mystery throughout the movie. It wasn&#39;t until the end that the audience learned that Lee wanted to be the CIA Director and was willing to do anything (like killing the incumbent) to assume the position.
Jason Bourne ended with Lee expressing the desire to bring Bourne back to the CIA, and if he refused, she would just kill him. Bourne recorded the conversation, and what happened next is up for interpretation (until, hopefully, the sixth film). Vikander&#39;s character would make for a great primary antagonist, after all.





 8  Pamela Landy 
Appears in The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, and The Bourne Legacy
        

Aside from Bourne and Nicky Parsons, Pamela Landy, played by Joan Allen, is the most consistent character in the Bourne film series. She was introduced in the second movie — The Bourne Supremacy — and starred in the next two installments — The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Landy was the Deputy Director of the CIA hunting Bourne in the second film (but was under false pretenses due to a frame job). Over time, Landy and Bourne became allies, and she testified in the Senate, exposing Treadstone and Blackbriar.
Landy had a small but significant role in The Bourne Legacy when Blackbriar supervisor Noah Vosen told the Senate that the program was solely created to locate Bourne. In doing so, Vosen accused Landy of lying and claimed she committed treason by helping Bourne. Unfortunately, Landy&#39;s fate is unknown, but that could be cleared up if Allen returns in Bourne 6.
























 7  Dr. Marta Shearing 
Appears in The Bourne Legacy
        

Rachel Weisz debuted as Dr. Marta Shearing in the Bourne franchise in The Bourne Legacy. Dr. Shearing was a virologist working on the Outcome project in the fourth movie, and she was the only scientist in the program to survive Dr. Donald Foite&#39;s attack. When other assassins tried to kill Dr. Shearing, Cross swooped in and saved her. The two worked together for the rest of the film, so if Cross returns in Bourne 6, it makes sense if so did Dr. Shearing.





 6  Eric Byer 
Appears in The Bourne Legacy
        

The Bourne Legacy contained a lot of star power — Jeremy Renner, Rachel Weisz, and Edward Norton. Norton portrayed Colonel Eric Byer, the Director of the National Research Assay Group, an agency in the Department of Defense. Byer was the one who ordered the hits on those associated with Outcome to avoid external investigations into Treadstone. The movie ended with no concrete resolution (or justice) for Byer, so Norton reprising his villainous role in Bourne 6 could clear up some holes in the franchise.

 5  Noah Vosen 
Appears in The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy
        

Of course, every past (alive) villain in the Bourne franchise likely won&#39;t appear in the upcoming movie, but one can dream. Noah Vosen, played by David Strathairn, is probably one of the most significant antagonists in the series, so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if he made an appearance. Vosen is a CIA operative and the director of Operation Blackbriar, and he wanted Bourne dead more than anybody, especially after Vosen was arrested at the end of The Bourne Supremacy. He returned in the fourth film when he stood on trial for his crimes, and although the verdict wasn&#39;t revealed, it was implied that Vosen was acquitted.





 4  Ezra Kramer 
Appears in The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy
        

Scott Glenn&#39;s Ezra Kramer is yet another important villain in the Bourne film series, as he was the Director of the CIA and the mastermind behind Noah Vosen&#39;s crimes in the third and fourth movies. The Bourne Ultimatum ended with the beginning of a criminal investigation into Kramer. Given his significant role in the franchise, it might be time to bring Kramer back and wrap up his story.





 3  Paz 
Appears in The Bourne Ultimatum
        

Paz, played by Édgar Ramírez, was an Operation Blackbriar agent tasked with hunting down Bourne in The Bourne Ultimatum. The entirety of the film features Paz trying to kill Bourne, but in the movie&#39;s last moments, Paz decides to spare Bourne (since he spared him in an earlier scene). Paz was just another piece in Blackbriar&#39;s games, and he was done doing their bidding. Perhaps Ramírez can reprise his role in Bourne 6 and team up with Bourne.





 2  Aaron Kalloor 
Appears in Jason Bourne
        

Riz Ahmed starred as Aaron Kalloor, the CEO of Deep Dream, in the fifth installment of the Bourne franchise. Deep Dream was a social media platform that CIA Director Robert Dewey wanted to use for mass surveillance. But once Kalloor started having second thoughts about going into business with the CIA, Dewey ordered a hit on him. Bourne ended up saving Kalloor, so he is one of the few surviving characters in the series. Plus, it&#39;s always great to see Ahmed on the big screen.

The two leading men of the Jason Bourne series appear similar, but are in fact very different. Even in the face of danger, their approaches differ.








 1  Nicky Parsons 
Appears in The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum, and Jason Bourne


 







Yes, Nicky Parsons technically died in Jason Bourne, but &#34;death&#34; seldom stops action franchises from bringing back fan-favorite characters. Julia Stiles&#39;s character appeared in every film in the series except for The Bourne Legacy, and she was one of the most significant figures in the movies. Nicky was a Treadstone employee before abandoning the program to work alongside Bourne, and she was his unofficial love interest. Sadly, Nicky was shot and killed in the fifth film, but it&#39;s possible that she faked her death and is still alive. If the Bourne 6 writers want to keep her dead, Stiles could still show up via a flashback in the upcoming movie.
