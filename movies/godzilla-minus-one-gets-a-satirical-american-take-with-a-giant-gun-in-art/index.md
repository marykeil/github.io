## Literature Review

Godzilla Minus One is transformed into a satirical Americanized version in new art that shows the kaiju monster wielding a gigantic gun.




Godzilla Minus One receives satirical new art as the kaiju monster gets “Americanized” through a new weapon. From the production company Toho, Godzilla Minus One is a Japanese film about the classic monster. Set in post-war Japan, the film sees the resurgence of the monster, who is made more intense by the horrific power of the atomic bomb.




Now, Godzilla Minus One receives a joking update in new art from @thearmogidaship. In their art, the kaiju monster from Godzilla Minus One sports none other than a massive gun.


 

In a satirical caption for the post, the artist writes “The American remake of Godzilla Minus One is [fire].”


 How This Satirical Art Points Out a Major Difference Between Godzilla Minus One and Hollywood’s MonsterVerse 
          

Boasting an impressive 98% Rotten Tomatoes approval among both critics and audiences, Godzilla Minus One is one of the highest-rated Godzilla films. The film was met with box office success and praise both internationally and in the United States. Godzilla Minus One received particular accolades for how human it felt, giving a real gravity to the characters.




                  Godzilla’s 6 Best Fights In Toho’s Movies, Ranked   Over the years, Godzilla has been involved in a long list of exciting kaiju battles. Here are Godzilla&#39;s six best monster fights in Toho&#39;s movies.   

This artist&#39;s Americanized version pokes fun at Hollywood&#39;s action film efforts. Unlike the more thought-provoking Japanese rendition of the monster shown in Godzilla Minus One, American films are apt to throw automatic weapons at characters to create bullet-ridden battles. While this can create ample action opportunities, those who have seen Godzilla Minus One understand that the terror of the monster comes not from what kind of weapons he has access to, but the human-caused horror that created him.

2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong is one of the better-rated films in the American Monsterverse franchise, with a 76% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes. That film’s director, Adam Wingard, is also set to direct the upcoming Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which is set for release on April 12. While Godzilla x Kong may not match the gravitas and strength of Godzilla Minus One, hopefully, the film will help continue the Monsterverse more creatively than just adding more guns.
