## Literature Review

A Tyler Perry movie has found new life on Netflix after failing to capture the hearts of critics and audiences when it was first released in 2014.




Tyler Perry&#39;s The Single Moms Club has become a posthumous streaming hit after its dismal critical reception. The movie follows five single mothers from different walks of life as they come together upon learning their sons face expulsion. In doing so, they realize that they aren&#39;t alone in their burdens. The movie stars Nia Long, Amy Smart, Cocoa Brown, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Zulay Henao, and Perry, who also served as director and writer. When The Single Moms Club premiered, it was met with harsh reviews. It currently holds an 18% critic score and a 58% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.




While that would normally mean death for a movie, it has seen new life upon streaming on Netflix. In the recent Global Top 10 streaming report for the platform, The Single Moms Club stood at No. 5 for overall streams for the week of January 8 through January 14 with 8.5 million hours viewed and a total of 4.6 million views. In its first week in the Top 10, it placed higher than The Super Mario Bros Movie, which has been on the list for seven weeks.

 Perry Continues To Rule Straight To Video/Streaming 
          

Over the years, it&#39;s been common for movies to become hits far after their initial release due to physical sales or other means of availability. Numerous cult classics were deemed flops after their theatrical runs. Unable to make enough money in theaters, the movies would be quickly dumped onto physical media and sometimes find a much more positive audience after the fact. Streaming has essentially replaced Blockbuster, Redbox, and so many others while still creating a similar environment for viewers to seek out random movies. The death of physical rentals led to a rebirth in how these revivals happen.




Perry has remained a cultural icon as he continues to churn out hit after hit in his Madea franchise. Much of the series has gone straight to video or streaming and still finds a large audience without the marquee. The writer/director/producer has learned to capitalize on these products, as Perry signed a four-year film deal with Netflix in 2023. This deal will include 8 movies over the span of four years. His success in the industry may be divisive among viewers and critics, yet the numbers speak for themselves, and his current Netflix chart-topper is no exception.

The recent revival of The Single Moms Club only builds on Perry&#39;s success. It may not have captured everyone&#39;s hearts initially, but it gained the eye of the OWN network. The movie has a spinoff called If Loving You Is Wrong that ran for five seasons and broke a record for the highest-rated premiere on the network. If viewers enjoyed the movie on Netflix, then they may be curious to check out the spinoff that is currently available on Apple TV. Perry always proves that he has a fan base, even if it takes time.
