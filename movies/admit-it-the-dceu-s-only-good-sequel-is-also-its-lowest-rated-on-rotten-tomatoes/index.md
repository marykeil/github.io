## Literature Review
The DCEU has had a mixed track record when it comes to sequels but there was one that was maybe judged too harshly at the time of its release. 


Summary

  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice stands firm among other DCEU sequels, offering more than just a face-off between heroes, addressing moral responsibilities of superheroes.   The movie aged well over the years, with strong performances, rousing background score, and stylish cinematography.   Despite its flaws and negative critical reception, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice deserved better reactions and had a relatively better audience score.  






The DC Extended Universe has had a rocky journey among critics, beginning with the polarizing reactions to Man of Steel and the embarrassingly low Rotten Tomatoes score awarded to its sequel Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Despite both of these movies faring much better among audiences, the DCEU did offer some promising, critically acclaimed projects only to follow them up with universally panned sequels. Following the footsteps of the failed DC sequel Wonder Woman 1984, the year 2023 bore witness to critical disasters like Shazam! Fury of the Gods and the DCEU’s final venture Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

While most of the DCEU movies have had a bad rapport with the critics, there’s one that was perhaps judged too harshly in its time. Zack Snyder’s follow-up to Man of Steel, the clash of DC titans christened Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, made headlines early before its release since Ben Affleck was announced as DCEU’s Batman. The project was also highly anticipated with the cinematic debut of new cinematic versions of characters like Wonder Woman and Lex Luthor. Despite these strengths, the movie opened with a “Rotten” critical consensus. But given the state of subsequent DCEU sequels, the Snyderverse catalyst deserves way more.

              Related   How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date &amp; Chronologically)   The DCEU&#39;s timeline may be about to be rebooted in the DC Universe, but here&#39;s how to watch the DCEU in release order or chronological order.    


 Batman v Superman Is Easily The Best DCEU Sequel 
   Close     

Compared to other DCEU sequels that were bogged down by formulaic blockbuster tropes, unconvincing villains, and some comically bad VFX, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice stands firm. It was an ambitious project for the franchise, and contrary to its title, the 2016 movie was more than just a face-off between the titular heroes. Addressing the collateral damage caused by Superman’s duel against Zod in Man of Steel, the movie delved into the moral responsibilities of superheroes. And pitting the Kryptonian superhero against a masked vigilante like Batman who doesn’t possess any superpowers made for a perfect conflict of morals among the future founders of the Justice League.



An extended director&#39;s cut titled Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Ultimate Edition) added 31 minutes of footage to the original duration of 2 hours and 31 minutes.




Even though Snyder couldn’t flesh out Batman’s origin, unlike what he did with Superman in Man of Steel, Ben Affleck offered a gritty portrayal as a version of Bruce Wayne who is burdened by not just the death of his parents but also the death of a former Robin (one of the many Easter Eggs in Batman v Superman). Affleck’s was a Batman that built up on brute force as is evident from the intense hand-to-hand combat sequences and the actor’s own physical transformation. At the same time, Henry Cavill got to showcase his emotional abilities as Superman when the consequences of his actions dawn upon him.


 

The movie’s ambitious runtime also allowed enough space to set up the Justice League, with Gal Gador’s presence as Wonder Woman being more than just a cameo. This is evident from her crucial involvement in the showdown against Doomsday. As for the villain department, Jesse Eisenberg also offered a memorable performance as a younger Lex Luthor, capturing the character’s unhinged and megalomaniac side like never before. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has only aged well over the years, not just due to these performances, but also with technical elements like Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL’s rousing background score and Larry Fong’s ultra-stylish cinematography.



 Batman v Superman&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Score Was Way Too Harsh 
          

Zack Snyder is no stranger to negative critical reactions aggregated on Rotten Tomatoes. After all, his DCEU debut Man of Steel still stands with a Rotten score of 56%, as opposed to a Fresh audience score of 75%. But Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice opened to worse reviews with a Rotten Tomatoes critics’ score of 29%. Some of the criticisms toward the movie seem to be justified, given infamous aspects like the much-memed-about “Martha” moment and an unconvincing Doomsday for the final boss battle. Some critics argued that the superhero movie prioritized style over substance, like most of Snyder’s filmography.

All said and done, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was still an introspective entertainer that wasn’t afraid to delve into the burden of being a superhero, from both the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel’s perspective. As he had proven with Watchmen, Snyder worships the source material and incorporates some memorable visual and themed nods to legendary comics like Frank Miller’s The Dark Knight Returns and the watershed events of Death of Superman. But these Easter Eggs still add more depth to the story instead of merely providing fan service. Considering its Rotten Tomatoes score, the movie deserved better reactions despite its few tonal inconsistencies and ambitious runtime.

 Every Sequel in the DC Extended Universe   Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)   Wonder Woman 1984 (2020)   Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)   Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom (2023)   



It’s only ironic that a monumental DCEU project remains the franchise’s lowest-rated entry as the critics were still more considerate while reviewing other Rotten sequels like Wonder Woman 1984 and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. At the time of its release, DCEU was being touted as a darker and grittier counterpart to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And Snyder’s superhero epic bears testimony to this with emotionally charged scenes like Lex Luthor masterminding the bombing of the US Capitol and the titular characters’ aggressive fights. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t Rotten either, as is evident from the relatively better audience score of 63%.
