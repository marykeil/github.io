## Literature Review



Tron 3 is currently in production and the sequel presents a lot of exciting possibilities for the franchise, even if Tron: Legacy was underwhelming. The first Tron film was released in 1982, and it was a huge leap forward for computer-generated images (CGI) in cinema. Thanks to innovative techniques by the creatives working on the film, audiences were transported inside early computers, and despite its rough edges, the movie developed a cult following over the years, and its influence extended to many other films in Hollywood.
In Tron, a video game developer named Kevin Flynn, played by Jeff Bridges is transported inside a computer where he discovers and interacts with the programs. While inside, Flynn uncovers the evidence to prove his former colleague, now boss, stole his ideas to climb the corporate ladder. A sequel was then released in 2010, which made a respectable $400 million at the box office (via Box Office Mojo) but didn&#39;t match up to the high expectations Disney had hoped for. With another sequel now in the works, the story continues, and things look promising.




 7  Tron: Legacy Has Developed A Cult Following Since 2010 
Just Like Tron




Just like the original movie, Tron: Legacy continued to gain greater success and popularity in the years since it was released than during its theatrical run. Tron made just shy of $27 million at the global box office upon its release (via The Numbers), which was why it didn&#39;t get a sequel until years later, when the film gained more popularity and a cult following. Now, with a dedicated fanbase across generations, hopefully, the latest entry in the series can get the respect it deserves when it launches in theaters if people are willing to go and see the movie.



 6  Tron 3 Can Learn From Legacy&#39;s Mistakes 
Giving It Greater Odds For Success
        

Tron: Legacy, for all the talent of its cast and the impressive costumes and set design, had its obvious struggles. The de-aging technology used to create CLU was not up to standard and considering he was the primary villain, it was too much to ignore. The writing of the screenplay had the monumental task of establishing a fresh new story for audiences unfamiliar with the original, while also building on what came before, and ended up muddled. In addition, many of the key characters were completely one-dimensional.
            

 10 Upcoming Remakes That Have Strong Chances At Winning Over Concerned Fans 
In a world of reboots, sequels, and spin-offs, movie fans are rightfully skeptical of remakes. However, these upcoming releases may win over fans.




Tron 3 has a much smaller gap from Tron: Legacy, and the potential to create a whole new story set in the same world, which will no doubt help this movie to achieve greater success than what came before. In addition, technology has moved on leaps and bounds with de-aging technology in Disney&#39;s Marvel projects and Indiana Jones having advanced a lot, as well as other major films like Avatar proving how far this technology can go. Tron 3 has every opportunity to overcome the failures and mistakes of Legacy and deliver something incredible.



 5  The Original Tron Movie Still Holds Up 
More Than 40 Years Later



Thanks to the combination of practical effects and clever use of CGI, 1982&#39;s Tron is still an impressive film with effects that haven&#39;t aged like The Mummy 2. The film employed animation techniques like backlight animation to create the glow and light strips on suits and vehicles throughout. Additionally, the fact that in 1982, computer graphics on physical computers were not very advanced and games like Pac-Man and other arcade-style video games were the height of technology means that the film feels like it reflects its setting perfectly well.



 4  The Tron Writer Director Is Advising And Executive Producing 
Steven Lisberger Is Back On Board
        

Steven Lisberger wrote and directed the original movie and was largely responsible for many of the elements that earned the film its cult following. From the story to the lighting effects and everything in between, Lisberger helped make Tron what it was. While he was also involved in Legacy as a producer, it appears that he may have slightly more engagement with the newest entry and help to nudge and support the creatives behind the project, although he suggests that he is taking on an Obi-Wan style role (via THR).



 3  The Actors Cast So Far 
Jared Leto, Cameron Monaghan, And Evan Peters
        

Thus far, the cast that has been announced to be involved in the latest sequel is shaping up to be something special. Jared Leto has had ups and downs in his acting career, but he certainly can command an audience and deliver something otherworldly, as evidenced in his role in Blade Runner 2049 as Niander Wallace. Leto is set to play the central figure the film&#39;s working title is based on, Ares (via Deadline). Starring alongside Leto will be the increasingly popular Evan Peters, who gained critical acclaim for his role in Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story (via THR), and widespread popularity for roles in American Horror Story.
            

 Tron: Ares - Cast, Story Details &amp; Everything We Know About Tron 3 
The Tron franchise returns for a third time with Tron: Ares. Here&#39;s everything to know about its polarizing lead cast, its ominous story, and more. 




They are both joined by several other confirmed cast, most notably Cameron Monaghan, who starred as Jerome and Jeremiah Valeska in Gotham, and the protagonist in the Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order games (via Deadline). Although their roles have yet to be disclosed, both Monaghan and Peters are incredibly talented young actors who are sure to help the film resonate with audiences and draw in fans of their other work. With so much talent already confirmed, Tron 3 is setting up to be the best entry yet.



 2  Tron 3 Has The Technology 
With Avengers: Endgame And Avatar Leading The Way
        

For a set of movies so heavily reliant upon CGI, the franchise has done well with the tools at hand, but now, with so many advances in technology, especially that used by its parent company Disney, Tron 3 is likely to benefit hugely from those advances. The CGI was already impressive for several elements in Tron: Legacy, from the gladiator-style games to the light cycle bikes and other set pieces that expanded the world inside that digital space. Tron 3 can take these elements to the next level and push the limits of what was possible for previous entries.



 1  The State Of Gaming And Technology Open Up New Ideas 
AR, VR, And Ultra-Realistic Games
        

With major advances in virtual reality, augmented reality, AI programs, and other technology, and advances in game engines, there is a lot more material for the film to interact with. The story could implement and provide commentary on the state of modern gaming and technology in a way that Tron: Legacy neglected, and there is more than enough to engage with. The original had strong ties to video games of that era with inspiration from games like Pong and Pac-Man, but now the technology used for gaming is interacting with real spaces more than ever before.
For a series of movies that explores programs trying to break out of their digital prisons and explore reality, these advancements make for the perfect exploration for the franchise. Considering all of these advancements, the film has a great opportunity to be extremely relevant and speak to inherent fears and concerns that modern audiences may have. Connecting on this level will do more to inspire genuine intrigue and interest from audiences, and hopefully make Tron 3 the most popular entry in the entire franchise.
