 Best Comedy Movies On Amazon Prime Video 
Saltburn (2023)


 







  Saltburn  


  Release Date    November 17, 2023     Director    Emerald Fennell     Cast    Barry Keoghan , Jacob Elordi , Rosamund Pike , Richard E. Grant , Alison Oliver , Archie Madekwe , Carey Mulligan     Runtime    131 Minutes    


 Part thriller and park black comedy, Saltburn was one of the most exciting films to come out of 2023 and now lives on as one of the best movies currently available on Amazon Prime Video. Starring Barry Keoghan, Rosamund Pike, Richard E. Grant, and Carrey Mulligan among others in its ensemble cast, Saltburn is a twisted tale of excess, deception, and obsession. Giving away any details about the plot would result in spoilers, as it&#39;s a movie that&#39;s best appreciated when gone into with as little known about the plot as possible. However, thanks to a riveting script and stellar performances from every cast member, it&#39;s a guarantee that Saltburn is a movie that won&#39;t be forgotten for all the right reasons.

Cocaine Bear (2023)


 







  Cocaine Bear  


  Release Date    February 24, 2023     Director    Elizabeth Banks     Cast    Ray Liotta , Alden Ehrenreich , Christian Convery , Scott Seiss , Margo Martindale , Keri Russell , Kahyun Kim , O&#39;Shea Jackson Jr. , Brooklynn Prince     Runtime    95 Minutes    


One of the strangest and most subversive movies to come of out 2023, Cocaine Bear is literally a movie about a bear that ingests an unfathomable amount of cocaine and then goes on a rampage. Directed by and starring Elizabeth Banks, Cocaine Bear is a far better film than a movie with such a ridiculous premise has any right being. It&#39;s loosely based on a true story, although the real cocaine bear didn&#39;t cause any bloodshed. Hilarious and grizzly throughout, there aren&#39;t any other movies like Cocaine Bear available on Amazon Prime Video or any other streaming service.

Asteroid City (2023)


 







  Asteroid City  
Romance
Comedy
Drama



  Release Date    June 23, 2023     Cast    Tom Hanks , Margot Robbie , Scarlett Johansson , Adrien Brody , Jeffrey Wright , Bryan Cranston , Bill Murray , Jeff Goldblum , Edward Norton , Liev Schreiber , Hope Davis , Jason Schwartzman , Steve Carell , Willem Dafoe , Hong Chau     Runtime    104 Minutes    


All of Wes Anderson&#39;s whimsical sensibilities are present and accounted for in Asteroid City â€” and Amazon Prime Video subscribers looking for a quirky comedy to watch right now on Amazon Prime Video should look no further. For the director&#39;s eleventh feature film, Anderson leans into sci-fi more than ever with a complex, meta premise about a play depicting Junior Stargazers and their families gathering at a convention in the 1950s.
Anderson is known for his sprawling ensemble casts, and Asteroid City boasts one of the biggest. The movie stars many frequent Anderson collaborators, including Jason Schwartzman and Edward Norton, and Tom Hanks notably joins the company in a small role, marking his first time working with the director. After the somewhat forgettable The French Dispatch, Anderson is back in fighting form with Asteroid City, praised for its style, quirky narrative, and top-notch cast.

Catherine Called Birdy (2022)
        

  Catherine Called Birdy  
Adventure



  Release Date    September 23, 2022     Director    Lena Dunham     Cast    Bella Ramsey , Dean-Charles Chapman , Andrew Scott , Billie Piper , Ralph Ineson , Isis Hainsworth , Joe Alwyn     Runtime    108 minutes    


Lena Dunham may be a polarizing filmmaker, but she delivered a crowd-pleasing romp with Catherine Called Birdy. Based on the Karen Cushman novel of the same name, the movie follows Lady Catherine (Bella Ramsey), also known as Birdy, is a 14-year-old girl living in medieval England who is determined to sabotage her father&#39;s plans of marrying her off to a wealthy man.
Ramsey has received tons of acclaim for their performances in Game of Thrones and The Last of Us, and their work in Catherine Called Birdy deserves to join these ranks. As Birdy, they are vivacious, funny, and charming, and they manage to make Birdy&#39;s struggle relatable despite the film taking place so long ago. Fleabag&#39;s Andrew Scott is also phenomenal as Birdy&#39;s father, Lord Rollo, and their chemistry is just as crackling as Ramsey and Pedro Pascal in The Last of Us.

Clue (1985)
        

  Clue  
Comedy
Mystery
Thriller
Crime



  Release Date    December 13, 1985     Director    Jonathan Lynn     Cast    Eileen Brennan , Tim Curry , Madeline Kahn , Christopher Lloyd , Michael McKean , Martin Mull     Runtime    94 minutes    


Movies based on board games don&#39;t exactly have the best reputation, and Clue was a box office bomb when it was released in 1985. Its gimmick of having three separate endings, released randomly to theaters screening the film, ultimately fell flat. However, when Clue was released on home video and all three endings were provided for viewers, it quickly gained a cult following.
The ensemble is a stacked cast of &#39;80s comedy heavyweights, led by Tim Curry as butler Wadsworth, and the zany farce comedy throughout the film provides non-stop laughs. Clue is an endlessly quotable movie, and like the home video release, Amazon Prime Video provides all three endings, the last of which features Mrs. White&#39;s famous &#34;flames of the side of my face&#34; speech, which Madeline Kahn totally improvised. Clue is one of the best (and funniest) movies on Amazon Prime Video, and viewers should be game to watch.

Comedy



  Release Date    October 23, 2020     Director    Jason Woliner     Cast    Sacha Baron Cohen , Maria Bakalova     Runtime    95 Minutes    


Few comedy characters are as controversial as Sacha Baron Cohen&#39;s Borat, and the 2020 sequel Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm brought the incredibly edgy hilarity to the modern era. Set during the COVID-19 pandemic, Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm only gets funnier with time as the lockdowns and other unique facets of 2020 become more retrospective. With an incredibly shocking finale that targets Rudy Giulianai, this comedy movie on Amazon Prime Video has somehow managed to capture one of the most chaotic times in recent memory and repackage it into absolute hilarity.

Chicago (2002)
        

 Chicago 


  Release Date    December 10, 2002     Director    Rob Marshall     Cast    Taye Diggs , Renee Zellweger , Cliff Saunders , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Richard Gere , Queen Latifah     Runtime    113 minutes    


Murder, fame, and jazz are at the center of the Best Picture-winning film, Chicago. Based on the Bob Foss musical of the same name, Chicago sees aspiring vaudeville performer Roxie Hart jailed for murdering her lover, Fred Casely (Dominic West). Facing a death sentence, Roxie enlists the help of the silver-tongued lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), which causes conflict when her case gets more attention than Billy&#39;s other client, celebrity Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones).
With its stunning costumes and catchy, rousing musical numbers, it&#39;s impossible not to get swept up in the razzle-dazzle of Chicago. In addition to Best Picture, the movie won five other Academy Awards, including Best Supporting Actress for Zeta-Jones. It&#39;s one of her best roles, but the entire Chicago cast shines, including Queen Latifah&#39;s corrupt yet kind Mama Morton and John C. Reilly&#39;s naive Amos Hart. Chicago is a true cinematic spectacle that will doubtless be considered among the best movies available on Amazon Prime Video until it leaves the platform.

 Best Drama Movies On Amazon Prime Video 
Inglourious Basterds (2009)


 







  Inglourious Basterds  
Drama
War
Adventure



  Release Date    August 21, 2009     Director    Quentin Tarantino     Cast    Christoph Waltz , Michael Fassbender , Brad Pitt , Diane Kruger , Eli Roth     Runtime    153 minutes    


Quentin Tarantino is one of Hollywood&#39;s most revered directors, and many critics and cinephiles are in agreement that Inglourious Basterds is his greatest work. A revisionist revenge tale blood bath, Inglourious Basterds sees a group of Jewish American soldiers dropped into occupied France with the sole purpose of dispatching as many Nazis as possible. Meanwhile, Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) is the Jewish owner of a cinema, and she has a vengeance plan of her own.
While Inglourious Basterds is full of the brutal violence Tarantino fans have come to expect, what makes the movie so masterful are its quiet scenes. Few write dialogue better than Tarantino, and the tension in moments like the farmhouse and tavern scenes is as brilliant as it is unbearable. Inglourious Basterds introduced Hollywood to Christoph Waltz, and he deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as the sophisticated yet merciless Hans Landa, one of Tarantino&#39;s most memorable villains.

Air (2023)
        

  Air  
Biopic
Drama



  Release Date    April 5, 2023     Director    Ben Affleck     Cast    Ben Affleck , Viola Davis , Matt Damon , Jason Bateman , Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd , Chris Messina     Runtime    95 minutes    


While Ben Affleck&#39;s acting career has been famously up and down, he&#39;s had impressive success behind the camera, and Air is the fifth film he&#39;s directed. Starring frequent Affleck collaborator Matt Damon as Nike shoe salesman Sonny Vaccaro, Air is the origin story of Nike and Michael Jordan&#39;s iconic shoe, the Air Jordan.
A whip-smart look at the American Dream from a corporate perspective, Air is the most entertaining movie about business since The Big Short. While it&#39;s not expected to see the same awards glory as past Affleck-directed films like Argo and Gone Baby Gone, it&#39;s perfect for a crowd-pleasing movie night. And Viola Davis&#39; performance as Michael Jordan&#39;s mother Deloris is poignant, heartfelt, and Oscar-worthy.

  Release Date    November 20, 2020     Director    Darius Marder     Cast    Shaheem Sanchez , Riz Ahmed , Paul Raci , Jeremy Stone , Mathieu Amalric , Olivia Cooke , Lauren Ridloff , Chelsea Lee     Runtime    130 minutes    


Riz Ahmed has been known for playing dark, troubled characters since his breakout role in Nightcrawler, and in Sound of Metal, he delivers the performance of a lifetime. He plays Ruben Stone, an avant-garde metal drummer who begins to lose his hearing. As Ruben grapples with the fact that he is going deaf, he must decide whether to get cochlear implants or remain with his community of people with deafness recovering from addiction.
Unsurprisingly, Ahmed&#39;s performance as the troubled Ruben earned him many award nominations, including an Oscar. And while Ahmed steals the show, many other elements of the film were praised, particularly the the sound editing. In total, Sound of Metal was nominated for an impressive six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deservedly won for Best Sound and Best Editing. Subscribers seeking a cerebral drama that pulls at many emotional strings will be more than satisfied with Sound of Metal, as it&#39;s one of the most gripping movies you can watch right now on Amazon Prime Video.

One Night In Miami (2020)


 







  One Night in Miami  
Drama



  Release Date    January 15, 2021     Director    Regina King     Cast    Eli Goree , Michael Imperioli , Beau Bridges , Aldis Hodge , Nicolette Robinson , Kingsley Ben-Adir , Derek Roberts , Joaquina Kalukango , Leslie Odom Jr. , Lawrence Gilliard Jr. , Lance Reddick , Christian Magby     Runtime    110 minutes    


Oscar winner Regina King steps behind the camera for a triumphant debut with One Night in Miami. Based on Kemp Powers&#39; play of the same name, One Night in Miami is a fictionalized retelling of a real night in February 1964 in which Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, and Sam Cooke spend a night celebrating Ali&#39;s boxing win over Sonny Liston, and share poignant conversation about what it means to be successful Black men in the midst of the civil rights movement.
While this premise may sound stagey and more suited to the theatre, the discussion amongst these powerhouse men will have viewers so engrossed they&#39;ll barely register how little action is happening, and if they do, they won&#39;t care. The movie earned three Academy Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for Leslie Odom Jr. as Sam Cooke. If One Night in Miami is any indication, King has a bright directing future ahead of her.

Raging Bull (1980)


 







  Raging Bull  
Biography
sport
Drama



  Release Date    December 19, 1980     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Robert De Niro , Theresa Saldana , Nicholas Colasanto , Joe Pesci , Cathy Moriarty     Runtime    129 minutes    


From Mean Streets to Killers of the Flower Moon, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese have collaborated on 10 feature films, and Raging Bull is easily one of their best. Based on Jake LaMotta&#39;s memoir, Raging Bull: My Story, the movie centers on middleweight boxer LaMotta&#39;s (De Niro) turbulent life, both in and out of the ring. There are many heavy-hitting dramas on Amazon Prime Video, but â€” as expected with a De Niro and Scorsese partnership â€” few match up to Raging Bull.
A 2008 AFI poll voted Raging Bull as the greatest sports movie of all time, beating out favorite Rocky. In many ways, Raging Bull is the antithesis of the feel-good inspirational Rocky. It plays more like a Shakespearean drama, in which LaMotta&#39;s rage is his tragic flaw, as it&#39;s what fuels his career but also is the reason for his downfall. De Niro won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance as LaMotta, and it will forever be remembered as one of his greatest roles.

 Best Romance Movies On Amazon Prime Video 
Bones And All (2022)
        

  Bones and All  
R



  Release Date    November 23, 2022     Director    Luca Guadagnino     Cast    Chloe Sevigny , Timothee Chalamet , Taylor McKenzie , Michael Stuhlbarg , David Gordon Green , Mark Rylance     Runtime    130 minutes    


 Horror and romance don&#39;t often go hand-in-hand without terrifying results, yet - somehow - 2022&#39;s Bones and All manages to keep the needle firmly on the romance side of the arrangement while also containing plenty of moments of cannibalism. Starring Timothee Chalamet and Taylor Russell, Bones and All is a love story about a pair of young cannibals taking a road trip across the US in the 1980s.
The film is both critically acclaimed and beloved by audiences despite underperforming at the box office, and it won the Silver Lion for best direction when it debuted at the 79th Venice International Film Festival. With a movie like Bones and All the critical reception almost takes second place to the premise and story, however, since there are few â€” if any â€” other movies that manage to craft such an emotionally deep story focusing on characters who eat other human beings as a hobby.

Romantic comedies are embracing LGBTQ&#43; love stories, and one of the best example is in Billy Eicher&#39;s 2022 movie Bros. Currently one of the best romance movies on Amazon Prime Video, Bros stars Eichner as a flighty and borderline-paranoid podcaster who falls head-over-heels for a lawyer played by Luke MacFarlane. Bros mixes plenty of hilarious moments with a strong core message, and viewers who&#39;ve had bad experiences with online dating will find this LGBTQ&#43; rom-com on Amazon Prime Video especially funny.

  Red, White &amp; Royal Blue  


  Release Date    August 11, 2023     Director    Matthew Lopez     Cast    Taylor Zakhar Perez , Nicholas Galitzine , Uma Thurman , Stephen Fry , Sarah Shahi , Ellie Bamber     Runtime    121 Minutes    


The film adaptation of Red, White &amp; Royal Blue had big shoes to fill, as Casey McQuiston&#39;s novel of the same name is a New York Times bestseller with myriad fans who were swept up in the enemies-to-lovers romance at its core. Thankfully, the movie royally delivered. Like the novel, Red, White &amp; Royal Blue centers on first son of the United States Alex Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Prince Henry of Britain (Nicholas Galitzine), who embark on a passionate romance despite their initial disdain for each other.
The chemistry between the lead couple is make-or-break for rom-coms, and Zakhar Perez and Galitzine&#39;s is scorching. Mirroring the novel&#39;s success, Red, White &amp; Royal Blue was a massive hit for Amazon Prime Video, becoming the No. 1 video upon release week and seeing a huge surge in membership, which speaks to both the film&#39;s popularity and quality.

  Release Date    July 14, 2017     Director    Michael Showalter     Cast    Zoe Kazan , Ray Romano , Kumail Nanjiani , Holly Hunter , Adeel Akhtar     Runtime    120minutes    


Prior to The Big Sick, Kumail Nanjiani was best known for his supporting role in Silicon Valley as the put-upon Dinesh. But with this movie, Nanjiani steps into the spotlight. He and his wife, Emily Gordon, co-write the script together, which is a semi-autobiographical account of their relationship. In the film, Nanjiani is a stand-up comedian and Uber driver who meets and falls for Emily Gardner (Zoe Kazan). As cultural differences threaten their relationship, Emily falls ill and goes into a coma.
This is a unique premise for the rom-com genre, and one that works spectacularly, as Kumail and Emily&#39;s story is made all the more personal by the fact that it really happened. Romantic comedies are rarely given the respect they deserve, but there&#39;s no denying how powerful The Big Sick is. Nanjiani and Gordon were nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards, and won Best First Screenplay at the Independent Spirit Awards for their stellar script.

Action and romance go surprisingly well together in movies that mash the genres, and 2022&#39;s Shotgun Wedding is one of the latest rom-coms to lean into some gripping action sequences with hilarious results. Starring Jennifer Lopez and Josh Duhamel as newlyweds whose ceremony is literally hijacked by modern pirates, Shotgun Wedding&#39;s title is incredibly literal in several scenes. While the witty dialogue and easy-going laughs make it worth a watch alone, seeing The White Lotus star Jennifer Coolidge grinning manicly as she wields a submachine gun is alone enough to make Shotgun Wedding one of the best romance movies on Amazon Prime Video.

  Release Date    June 9, 2023     Director    Steven Caple Jr.     Cast    Dominique Fishback , Anthony Ramos , Lauren Velez    


The Transformers franchise is synonymous with big-budget easy-watching blockbuster action that meshes sci-fi and fantasy in an easily digestible package, and 2023&#39;s Transformers: Rise of the Beasts is no exception. While it&#39;s not as groundbreaking or game-changing as some of the other movies currently available on Amazon Prime Video, the 7th Transformers movie understood its mission brief, more than delivering on the expected jaw-dropping CGI sequences and big, explosion-filled battles between giant transforming robots. Subscribers looking for some slick and well-polished popcorn fodder among Amazon Prime Video movies need look no further.

The movie focuses on Yeoh as Evelyn, the tired wife of a laundromat owner struggling with an impending divorce and a strained relationship with her daughter (Stephanie Hsu). However, Evelyn&#39;s mundane life gets turned on its head when she learns about the existence of the multiverse and â€” more importantly â€” just how integral to it other versions of herself and her daughter truly are.

Buy Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves In UHD &amp; HD At Amazon 

Given previous attempts at making a D&amp;D movie have tended to end pretty badly, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves seemed like a roll of the dice that could very well end in disaster. By some miracle, though - which in this case really means the talents of writing and directing duo Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley (Game Night) - it actually ended up being a whole lot of fun. Honor Among Thieves is what feels like an increasingly rare fantasy that isn&#39;t incredibly serious, violent, and dark, but is instead lighthearted, good-natured, and feels darn good to watch.
There are plenty of Dungeons &amp; Dragons Easter eggs in Honor Among Thieves, but you don&#39;t need to know your wizards from your warlocks to invest in this movie. Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves&#39; cast is clearly having a great time, and that spreads to the viewer; the main heroes all make you root for them, and the movie does a good job in bringing the spirit of the game to the big screen. It also helps that, in one particular Chris Pine moment, it has arguably the funniest scene of any 2023 movie. Honor Among Thieves may have bombed at the box office, and it&#39;s by no means perfect, but it&#39;s ideal movie night entertainment on Amazon Prime.

  Release Date    November 7, 2014     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Anne Hathaway , Matthew McConaughey , Jessica Chastain , Ellen Burstyn , Michael Caine , Bill Irwin     Runtime    2h 49m    


It&#39;s shocking that Christopher Nolan hasn&#39;t won an Oscar yet, and while he stands his best chance yet with Oppenheimer, he would have been deserving with almost any other movie in his filmography, including Interstellar. A word commonly associated with Nolan movies is &#34;mind-bending&#34;, and his epic space drama is no exception. Typical of a Nolan movie, Interstellar is stacked with an A-list ensemble including Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Matt Damon.
McConaughey leads the movie as a former NASA pilot on a mission in space to find a habitable planet as Earth is dying. While Nolan himself received no Oscar nominations for Interstellar, the film deservedly won for Best Visual Effects, and this combined with the thought-provoking storyline makes this one of the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.

2023&#39;s Renfield stars Nicolas Cage as the worlds most famous vampire, Count Dracula, with Nicolas Hoult as his existentially lost assistant, Renfield. While Renfield didn&#39;t quite make the box-office splash its premise and cast teased it would, the movie has started to find its footing now that it&#39;s available to stream as one of the best horror comedies on Amazon Prime Video. Both Hoult and Cage deliver hilarious performances, and while it may not be among the best movies in either star&#39;s filmography, placing them onscreen together makes Renfield a movie that deserved far more attention than it received theatrically.

Nothing is more unsettling than a creepy smile, and Smile capitalizes on this fear to the hilt.

Laura then takes her own life in front of Rose, who begins to experience the same occurrences. The best horror movies always have smart social commentary, and beneath its many jump scares and terrifying smiles, Smile has a lot to say about trauma, and it&#39;s delivered through some stellar performances, led by Bacon is no doubt on her way to becoming an A-list actor.

  Release Date    January 6, 2023     Director    Gerald Johnstone     Cast    Amie Donald , Kimberley Crossman , Allison Williams , Ronny Chieng , Violet McGraw , Brian Jordan Alvarez     Runtime    1h 42m    


The pantheon of creepy horror dolls took on a particularly 2020s vibe with Gerald Johnstone&#39;s M3GAN, which is part modern Promethean panic and part good old-fashioned chiller. While the eponymous dancing doll was the source of one of the most viral memes of 2022, the movie itself is more than just a gimmick. The horror credentials are front and center, thanks to James Wan pulling producer duties, but M3GAN is also gloriously, self-consciously silly, which more horror movies can afford to be. At least one could be, at the very least, as MEGAN 2.0 has already been announced.
In short, M3GAN is one of the best horror movies of recent times, one of the best additions to the killer doll sub-genre, and a roaringly fun, creepy romp. It was a ready-made cult classic on arrival, but surpassed that thanks to a higher level of success, and it&#39;s easily one of the most enjoyable new horror movies on streaming.

Train To Busan (2016)
        

  Train to Busan  
Horror
Action



  Release Date    July 1, 2016     Director    Yeon Sang-ho     Cast    Gong Yoo     Runtime    118minutes    


While the zombie horror subgenre was all the rage in the 2000s, fatigue had firmly set in by the 2010s. But Train to Busan proved that quality triumphs over trendiness when it arrived on the scene in 2016. The South Korean film centers on the characters aboard a train who are threatened by the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Train to Busan&#39;s confined setting ratchets up the tension, making for some heart-pumping, thrilling action sequences all while delivering smart, subtle social commentary. The movie was so successful that it launched a film franchise, an animated prequel, a 2020 standalone sequel film, and an in-development American-produced adaptation.

Tucker And Dale Vs. Evil (2010)
        

  Tucker &amp; Dale vs. Evil  
Horror
Comedy



  Release Date    September 30, 2011     Director    Eli Craig     Cast    Tyler Labine , Katrina Bowden , Alan Tudyk , Chelan Simmons , Jesse Moss     Runtime    89 minutes    


Compared to the rest of the movies available on Amazon Prime Video on this list, Eli Craig&#39;s Tucker and Dale vs. Evil is far from a classic. It is, however, an unabashed cult classic, and it has earned a fervent following for a reason. Craig&#39;s blackly comedic horror movie flips the &#34;murderous backwoods rednecks&#34; trope upside-down in a scenario in which the college students are the antagonists and the rednecks are just two nice guys trying to survive what was supposed to be a relaxing fishing trip.
It is diabolically gleeful with its kills â€“ characters are killed off in increasingly ridiculous, gore-splattered ways â€“ as the horror-comedy of errors escalates. Along the way, it even manages to squeeze in a romantic storyline that feels earned, a miraculous feat to execute in a movie with a cast-to-body count ratio as low as Tucker and Dale vs. Evil.

Nope (2022)


 







  Nope  
Horror
 Sci-Fi

8 
/ 10 




  Release Date    July 22, 2022     Director    Jordan Peele     Cast    Steven Yeun , Michael Wincott , Daniel Kaluuya , Brandon Perea , Keke Palmer , Barbie Ferreira     Runtime    131 minutes    


The horror movie genre is one often dismissed as &#34;low culture&#34; but Jordan Peele is changing that narrative. Known for his sketch comedy series Key &amp; Peele, the Oscar-winning Peele has become one of Hollywood&#39;s most fascinating filmmakers. Nope is his third feature, and it stars Get Out&#39;s Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer as siblings who train horses for Hollywood productions and discover a sinister UFO above their ranch.
Beyond being an entertaining, satisfying watch â€” particularly when the savvy characters utter the film&#39;s title with regards to terrifying situations â€” Nope, like Peele&#39;s other movies, challenges its audience, forcing them to think about the relationship of spectacle and entertainment to exploitation. While cinephiles wait for what Peele does next, Nope is a great way to tide them over, and it&#39;s one of the best movies on Amazon Prime Video.

The talent behind Sicario couldn&#39;t be more prestigious, and with Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan writing the script and Dune&#39;s Denis Villeneuve in the director&#39;s chair, the movie does not disappoint. Sicario&#39;s cast is also stacked with some of today&#39;s greatest working Hollywood actors led by Emily Blunt as FBI Special Agent Kate Mercer.
Mercer joins a government task force looking to bring down powerful Mexican drug cartel leader Fausto AlarcÃ³n. While Sicario&#39;s action sequences are thrilling, it&#39;s Sheridan&#39;s nuanced characters and the stellar actors bringing them to the screen that makes the film such an intense, fascinating watch. and easily among the best action movies on Amazon Prime Video.

Top Gun: Maverick (2022)


 







  Top Gun: Maverick  


  Release Date    May 27, 2022     Director    Joseph Kosinski     Cast    Jennifer Connelly , Jake Picking , Raymond Lee , Tom Cruise , Lewis Pullman , Monica Barbaro , Miles Teller , Danny Ramirez , Val Kilmer , Manny Jacinto , Ed Harris , Glen Powell , Jon Hamm     Runtime    130 minutes     Main Genre    Action    


Tom Cruise was right not to release Top Gun: Maverick directly to streaming during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the sequel to the classic Top Gun went on to become the second-highest-grossing movie of 2022 with over a $1 billion at the global box office. But now that it&#39;s had its theatrical run, nobody is complaining about it being available on Amazon Prime Video.
Released over 30 years after the original, the sequel was well worth the wait, as Maverick is even better than Top Gun. As Cruise&#39;s Pete &#34;Maverick&#34; Mitchell trains the next generation of Top Gun graduates, Maverick has better visuals, a tighter script, and sends the franchise soaring into the 21st century with a totally modern update of this beloved story.
