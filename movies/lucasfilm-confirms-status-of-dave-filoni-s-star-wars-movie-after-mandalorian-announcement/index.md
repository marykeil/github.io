## Literature Review

Star Wars has confirmed the status of Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming The Mandalorian movie development in a promising update alongside exciting announcements.




Star Wars has officially confirmed the status of development on Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming The Mandalorian movie, and the update is nothing short of promising. Previously announced at Star Wars Celebration in 2023, Filoni is helming the culmination event of The Mandalorian&#39;s New Republic era, including Star Wars TV shows such as The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. For the most part, Star Wars has remained tight-lipped about this project, but at long last, they have provided a new and very promising update.




                  New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!   

The announcement comes from Star Wars regarding the brand-new movie The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, which will take The Mandalorian&#39;s Din Djarin and Grogu to the big screen for the first time. In speaking to other movie projects currently in development, Star Wars mentions Filoni&#39;s movie, assuring viewers that his project is very much still in the works. It also adds that Filoni is currently developing Ahsoka season 2, which is expected to be an important part of his The Mandalorian movie.


The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will lead Lucasfilm&#39;s ongoing feature-development slate, including films helmed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, James Mangold, and Dave Filoni, who is also currently developing Ahsoka Season 2, among those in the works.





Filoni will be one of several Star Wars directors, including Jon Favreau, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, and James Mangold, to take Star Wars back to the movie theater. The franchise hasn&#39;t seen a movie released in theaters since 2019&#39;s Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker, which means Favreau&#39;s The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be the first to do so since that point. Now, viewers can rest assured that Filoni&#39;s own The Mandalorian movie won&#39;t be far behind.


 Filoni&#39;s Mandalorian Movie Is In Active Development 
          

Filoni has only slightly teased aspects of his upcoming movie, including the fact Grand Admiral Thrawn will more than likely be the movie&#39;s main protagonist. The Mandalorian season 3 and Ahsoka season 1 have both done the work of developing this further, particularly with their glimpses into the New Republic. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, it seems, will continue this trend as it takes Star Wars from Disney&#43; to the big screen.




Star Wars has long since been preparing its The Mandalorian era TV shows for Filoni&#39;s movie, it seems. The Book of Boba Fett episode 6 alone stands as a &#34;test run&#34; of sorts for bringing all kinds of iconic Star Wars characters together in carefully woven threads. There&#39;s no doubt, then, that both The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie and Ahsoka season 2 will be paving the way for Filoni&#39;s The Mandalorian movie, which continues to be in active development.
