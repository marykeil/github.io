## Literature Review

Rust images reveal the first look at the work of late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, who was tragically killed by a prop gun on set of the movie.




Rust images reveal the first official look at the work of late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. In October 2021, tragedy struck on set of the Western in New Mexico when a prop gun handled by actor Alec Baldwin accidentally fired a live round, killing Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The highly publicized incident resulted in extensive investigation and multiple lawsuits, but after all charges against Baldwin were dropped, Rust was able to resume filming and finish the following month.




Now, two years after the fatal shooting, the first images from Rust have been released via Entertainment Weekly, showcasing the work of late cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

         

The first two images above, including the entrance of Frances Fisher, were lensed by the late cinematographer before her untimely death. The next three photos, including the one of Patrick Scott McDermott, were shot by Biana Cline, who replaced Hutchins as cinematographer when Rust resumed filming in Montana in April 2023.

 Rust&#39;s Release Is The Best Way To Honor Halyna Hutchins 
          




Though there has been debate about whether Rust should even be released, it is perhaps the best way to honor the work of its late cinematographer. Though its plot has been an afterthought considering the tragedy that occurred on set, the film follows Baldwin as the titular Harland Rust, an aging outlaw who comes out of retirement to rescue his 13-year-old grandson Lucas Hollister (played by Patrick Scott McDermott), who has been sentenced to hang for committing an accidental killing.

On the run from the law, the pair are pursued by the vicious bounty hunter Fenton &#34;Preacher&#34; Lang (played by Vikings star Travis Fimmel). Rust is set in 1880s Kansas and based on the first look-images, it&#39;s sure to showcase some iconic Western imagery, such as sweeping desert landscapes and lone rangers on horseback. The images, lensed by Hutchins and Cline, capture the rugged beauty of Western terrain.

Hutchins&#39; widower, Matthew Hutchins, is credited on Rust as executive producer, a designation that was granted after settling a wrongful death lawsuit with Baldwin and other producers. More than six individuals, including members of the production crew, have also filed negligence lawsuits against Rust&#39;s producers following the shooting. For a film that has been shrouded in tragedy and controversy, hopefully the first look at Rust will begin to develop a deeper appreciation for the late cinematographer&#39;s beautiful work.






Rust does not yet have a release date.
