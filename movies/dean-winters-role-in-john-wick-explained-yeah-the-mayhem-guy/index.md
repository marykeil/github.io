## Literature Review

Dean Winters is best known for his Mayhem ads, but the stuntman and actor has had several big roles including an appearance in John Wick.




Dean Winters&#39; Mayhem ads have given him notoriety, but it is far from the only acting gig the stuntman and actor has had. His Allstate ads where he appears as Mayhem highlight Winters&#39; comedic range, but he has appeared in multiple projects, including John Wick. Whether it&#39;s action, drama, or even horror, Winters has made an appearance. His ads have become pretty synonymous with the company that is known for memorable ads, including Alicia Keys&#39; Allstate commercial. Winters&#39; Mayhem character perfectly blends his best attributes - acting and stunts - which is likely why the commercials are so popular and among some of Winters&#39; best work.




That doesn&#39;t reflect poorly on his acting career though, as Winters has appeared in some well-known projects. John Wick may be the biggest project he has been part of, but it is not his most iconic. He has had a very active career, being involved in Allstate ads for over a decade. His acting career started in the 90s and his latest project was as recent as 2023. With Winters capable of action and stunts, it is no surprise he landed a part in the John Wick franchise, but his role in the movie isn&#39;t as obvious as it seems.


 Dean Winters Plays Avi In The First John Wick Movie 
          

Dean Winters&#39; Avi is one of the villains in the first John Wick film. He plays the right-hand man of Viggo Tarasov (Michael Nyqvist) and has several shootouts with Keanu Reeves&#39; character. Avi may not have been one of the most noteable villains John Wick fought, but he was a key part of the film that helped launch such a profitable franchise. Unlike in the Allstate commercials, Winters&#39; character is a more serious one in John Wick. While Viggo is a little more eccentric and wild, Avi is more grounded and is frequently sent to do his boss&#39; dirty work.




This is emphasized in Avi&#39;s final scene in the film. After most of his other men are killed by John Wick, Viggo sends Avi to fight while he waits in the car, even though Viggo is a capable killer himself. Like most of his foes, Avi can&#39;t take down the Baba Yaga and is killed by Wick. As the franchise got bigger and the fight scenes became even larger spectacles, Winters&#39; performance became less memorable but is still vital to the movie series. The Mayhem character may stick with him, but John Wick proved Winters was capable of delivering a strong showing in a major action film.

                  Every John Wick Movie Villain Ranked Worst To Best   The villains in the John Wick franchise are integral to the success of the movies, and they all present different threat levels to Baba Yaga.   



 Dean Winters&#39; Other TV &amp; Movies Roles Explained 
          




While his involvement with a mainstream franchise like John Wick may be among his bigger parts, Dean Winters has had several other memorable roles. Oz is one of the all-time great drama shows and Winters plays a pretty substantial character in the show. Winters features in the very first episode of Oz and is one of the key inmates, featuring prominently throughout the series&#39; six seasons. It is easily one of Winters&#39; most successful outings and shows why a franchise like John Wick would want him. Although his drama skills are clearly strong, so are his comedic chops.

Winters appears as The Vulture in Brooklyn Nine-Nine. He is part of the Major Crimes Unit and is best known for stealing credit from the officers who solved cases. He is arrogant and cocky, and The Vulture only got worse in Brooklyn Nine-Nine. This appeared intentional though, and proved Winters could play the most detestable character in the comedy show. Winters has also appeared in movies such as Hellraiser: Hellseeker and P.S. I Love You, showing just how much range he has. He may forever be known as The Mayhem Guy, but Dean Winters does have an impressive acting resume to go with his Allstate success.
