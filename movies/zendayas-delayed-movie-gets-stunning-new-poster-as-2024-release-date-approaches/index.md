The poster shows Tashi wearing sunglasses, and a game between Patrick and Art appears in the reflection. The poster uses a realistic art style to capture the actors&#39; likenesses.


 Why Challengers Had Its Release Date Delayed 
          

Originally, the upcoming tennis romance film was supposed to be released on September 15, 2023. However, because of the SAG-AFTRA actors strike, the film was delayed seven months, all the way to April 26, 2024. This means the movie will be able to be promoted by its stars in the press, offering it more attention before its theatrical release.




                  10 Best Tennis Movies Of All Time   Though the release of Challengers is delayed, there are other great tennis movies in various genres to get viewers excited for Zendaya&#39;s next film.   

Despite its delayed release, the new movie is bolstered by Zendaya&#39;s starring role and the love triangle at the center of its story. The film is also rated R, indicating that it will have plenty of steamy scenes to make the drama even more intense. Since the film will no doubt see Patrick returning to his status as a talented player, the movie could also serve as an inspirational movie about triumphing over challenges.

Depending on its theatrical performance, Challengers could break a box office record for tennis movies. Given the draw of Zendaya as the film&#39;s star, the movie may be a major hit once it gets released. With more information about the movie likely to be revealed before April, the new poster is a reminder of the dramatic tension the rom-com will provide.






Challengers is directed by Luca Guadagnino with a screenplay by Justin Kuritzkes.
