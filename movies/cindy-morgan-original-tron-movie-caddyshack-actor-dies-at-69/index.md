## Literature Review

Cindy Morgan, who starred as one of the lead actors in the original Tron movie and in Caddyshack, has tragically died at the age of 69.




An original Tron actor, Cindy Morgan, has sadly died. Morgan made her name as an actor with appearances in the original Tron and Caddyshack, but was largely a low-profile figure with few credits to her name. Besides those two movies, she also starred in American Gigolo, The Midnight Hour, and Falcon Crest, among other movies and shows.




According to TMZ, Morgan has died at the age of 69 and was found in her home by a roommate. The roommate was returning home from a vacation that ended on December 30. They called emergency services after noticing a foul smell. The police then found Morgan, who reportedly died of natural causes. Foul play is not suspected at this time.


 Cindy Morgan&#39;s Esteemed Career 
          

Morgan first made her name known in 1980 when she played Lacey Underall in the Harold Ramis-directed movie Caddyshack. She starred alongside Bill Murray, Michael O&#39;Keefe, Ted Knight, and Chevy Chase. While it had a successful release, earning $60 million on a budget of approximately $5 million, it would gain even more influence and a larger following in the years after it first hit theaters.

Morgan also starred in Tron in 1982, which was a notable year for sci-fi. She played Lora Baines-Bradley and the Yori program, who jointly helped to put a stop to the Master Control Program&#39;s work. The franchise itself is still ongoing today, with the long-awaited Tron 3 set to enter production soon. After Tron, Morgan would go on to star in several TV movies, including The Midnight Hour and Dead Weekend. She also had several TV appearances, having featured in Walt Disney&#39;s Wonderful World of Color, The Fall Guy, and The Love Boat.




                  The 1 Year That Changed Sci-Fi Movies Forever   As a film genre, science fiction may have been around since almost the beginning of moving pictures, but one year changed the genre forever.   

While her career was tragically short, it was extremely influential. Tron and Caddyshack alone reshaped the faces of sci-fi and comedy, respectively. Cindy Morgan will always be remembered for her contributions to Hollywood. At the time of writing, her fellow actors have not yet spoken out about her death, but reactions are sure to come.



Tron is available for streaming on Disney&#43;.
