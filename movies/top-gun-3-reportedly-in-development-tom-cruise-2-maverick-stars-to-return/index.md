## Literature Review

A new report claims a Top Gun: Maverick sequel is officially in the works, with Tom Cruise and two other stars set to return for Top Gun 3.




A follow-up to Top Gun: Maverick is officially in the works, according to a new report, with Tom Cruise and two other stars returning for Top Gun 3. Cruise reprised the role of Pete &#34;Maverick&#34; Mitchell after more than three decades for Top Gun: Maverick, headlining the action drama that would become the second highest-grossing movie of 2022 behind Avatar: The Way of Water. Speculation about a follow-up has ramped up again in recent days, given the announcement of Cruise&#39;s new deal to star in big blockbuster projects for Warner Bros. In the immediate aftermath, many wondered what the deal would mean for the actor&#39;s established Paramount franchises, such as Top Gun.




Writing in the What I&#39;m Hearing newsletter for Puck, Matt Belloni confirms that Paramount is officially moving forward with Top Gun 3. Cruise will return as Pete Mitchell, as will Glen Powell and Miles Teller, who had prominent supporting parts as Hangman and Rooster, respectively, in 2022&#39;s long-awaited sequel. Belloni adds that Top Gun: Maverick co-writer Ehren Kruger is already writing the script, with Joseph Kosinski potentially returning to direct as well as produce alongside Jerry Bruckheimer and David Ellison.


 How Top Gun 3 Fits Into Tom Cruise&#39;s Next Movies 
          

The reporting in the newsletter is discussed in the context of Cruise&#39;s partnership with Warner Bros. and what it means for Paramount. The deal is non-exclusive, which means the actor is free to work on Paramount tentpoles, including Top Gun 3 as well as the Mission: Impossible films. Belloni notes that Top Gun 3 could be Cruise&#39;s next project after Mission: Impossible 8, if Kruger&#39;s script comes together, but that is not confirmed.






The untitled eighth Mission: Impossible film is currently slated to be released on May 23, 2025.




Multiple outlets have mentioned that Cruise may not actually be freed up to work on a WB project until 2025 or 2026. But, when he is, Edge of Tomorrow 2 is possible. It&#39;s also been floated that Cruise could lead a sequel to The Firm, reprising his character from the 1993 legal drama. Alternatively, there are hopes that the four-time Oscar nominee might spearhead a new action blockbuster for WB.

Outside of WB and Paramount, which have reportedly discussed a possible merger, Cruise is still linked to Edge of Tomorrow director Doug Liman&#39;s space movie at Universal. One of the most recognizable stars on the globe has an unsurprisingly busy schedule, in other words. But even with that, the announcement of Top Gun 3 stands out thanks to the massive (and somewhat out of nowhere) box office success of its predecessor. Though it was expected to be a hit, Top Gun: Maverick far exceeded expectations and grossed nearly $1.5 billion dollars worldwide, so it would be no surprise if everyone involved makes the sequel a priority.
