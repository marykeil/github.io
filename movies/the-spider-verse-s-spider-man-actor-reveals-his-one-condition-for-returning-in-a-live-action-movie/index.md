## Literature Review

One of the main actors for Sony&#39;s Spider-Verse franchise has spoken about whether he would reprise his role as Spider-Man in live-action.




The Spider-Verse franchise is one of Sony&#39;s most successful Spider-Man properties, but one of its main actors has revealed that he would only make the jump from animation to live-action on one condition. Given that the Multiverse is now the superhero genre&#39;s most pervasive theme, including within the MCU, the possibility of moving a character from animation to live-action is more feasible than ever. Whether or not the actors involved in the Spider-Verse want to reprise their roles in the flesh, however, is another story.




The actor for the Sony Pictures Animation character Peter B. Parker, Jake Johnson, revealed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he would only play Peter B. Parker in live-action if Spider-Verse Writers and Producers, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, requested it. The love and care put into the Spider-Verse movies by its creators is plain to see, so Johnson&#39;s comments aren&#39;t all that surprising. As for why this would be the only condition that he would take on a live-action role, Johnson believes that to do so solely in the name of capitalizing on the success of his character would be an injustice. The full quote can be read below:


&#34;If Phil Lord or Chris texted and said, &#39;We think this is really cool and we would like you to be part of it,&#39; then I&#39;m in. If it&#39;s Sony that says they have got a really fun idea and it&#39;s a new director who&#39;s at a great studio rate, I feel less excited about that. I think that a lot of this stuff is ... There&#39;s an element that&#39;s just money to make money, and projects just to make money. And then there&#39;s a few people who really care, and those people who really care, if it&#39;s them, I&#39;m on board for anything,&#34;
&#34;If Phil says, &#39;Hey, man, you&#39;re not going to like this, but we&#39;re going to put you in tights in front of a green screen,&#39; but it&#39;s him and it&#39;s Chris, I&#39;m like, &#39;The project&#39;s going to be so thoughtful and good and mean so much to so many people, and if you think I could help that, f-ck yes, I&#39;m in.&#39; But in terms of me individually having a desire, I don&#39;t. I love Peter B. Parker as ... I will say this: I would be so sad if I got a call that Peter B. Parker is not returning to the Spider-Verse, because I feel really attached to that character. And Phil and I will go out, or we&#39;ll text a lot, and I&#39;m always pitching on Peter B., and I&#39;m trying to fight to honor him. I want to make sure ... He&#39;s funny, but he&#39;s our Spider-Man. He means something and we always go back, and he means a lot to me as a character. I love playing him. So anything outside of that, I don&#39;t give it much thought.&#34;





                  What&#39;s Next For Miles Morales? Everything We Know About Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse   Miles Morales and his allies will return for a third Spider-Verse adventure following the exciting ending of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.   


 Could Spider-Verse Heroes Eventually Appear In Live-Action? 
          

Given that Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse already blurred the lines between live-action and animated universes in the multiverse, Sony has already teased that these worlds can easily collide. The animated Spider-Verse movies are universally beloved by fans and critics alike, and this is in part thanks to the voice actors involved, which suggests that having them reprise their roles in live-action would be well-received. The Spider-Verse has, however, made it clear that animated and live-action characters maintain their genetic makeup. The Spot remains animated while communicating with Venom&#39;s Mrs. Chen, for example, and Donald Glover&#39;s Prowler is still made of real flesh and blood while in Earth-928.




This complicates turning animated characters into live-action ones without re-casting the actors as different variants, even though it is still possible. Plus, Jake Johnson&#39;s sentiments on the matter suggest that getting the voice actors on board in the first place would be the first hurdle for studios to overcome. Instead, it seems more likely that Spider-Verse actors are more likely to stick to their original roles, especially if Sony intends to double down on the franchise&#39;s success and release more movies after the third in the trilogy.
