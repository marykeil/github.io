## Literature Review

Martin Scorsese reveals details for his next movie, which is not going to be his reteaming up with Leonardo DiCaprio after Killers of the Flower Moon.




Martin Scorsese has revealed details about his next movie, which will not be his reteaming with Leonardo DiCaprio. Following Killers of the Flower Moon, Scorsese&#39;s next project remained unclear, with much of his focus being the promotion of his newest movie. However, with a seasoned career of critically acclaimed films under his belt, it was obvious he wouldn&#39;t be sitting still for much longer.




Speaking with the Los Angeles Times, Scorsese confirmed his next feature film will be a collaboration with filmmaker Kent Jones on a movie about Jesus. The film will be based on the book A Life of Jesus by Shūsaku Endō, who also wrote the source material for Scorsese&#39;s 2016 film Silence. Check out some of what Scorsese teased about the movie below:


I have responded to the pope’s appeal to artists in the only way I know how: by imagining and writing a screenplay for a film about Jesus.
I’m trying to find a new way to make it more accessible and take away the negative onus of what has been associated with organized religion.
Right now, ‘religion,’ you say that word and everyone is up in arms because it’s failed in so many ways. But that doesn’t mean necessarily that the initial impulse was wrong. Let’s get back. Let’s just think about it. You may reject it. But it might make a difference in how you live your life — even in rejecting it. Don’t dismiss it offhand. That’s all I’m talking about. And I’m saying that as a person who’s going to be 81 in a couple of days. You know what I’m saying?






 Everything Martin Scorsese Has Revealed About His Jesus Movie 
          

By Killers of the Flower Moon’s ending, the film became the second-longest movie directed by Scorsese, clocking in at 3 hours and 26 minutes. By comparison, the director envisions his film about Jesus to be close to 80 minutes long, making it one of the shortest movies of his career. The film will be set in the present day, focusing on the religious figure’s teachings in a way accessible to all audiences.

The movie is a far cry from many of the director’s more recent films, which have focused on real-world stories filled with brutality and violence. This includes some of his other ideas that were never realized, such as a dark collaborative project with DiCaprio about American serial killer H.H. Holmes. However, it&#39;s also not Scorsese&#39;s first time making a movie about Jesus, having directed the polarizing religious epic The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988.




                  10 Longest Martin Scorsese Movies (Including Killers Of The Flower Moon)   Along with his talent, Martin Scorsese is known for his epic narratives that run past the standard 90 minutes. But which of his films are the longest?   

While details are still scarce about the upcoming movie, it appears to be a project Scorsese is passionate about pursuing. By making a point to analyze religion in a nuanced way, this movie may also drum up a similar amount of discussion as his last film featuring Jesus. It remains to be seen how his upcoming religious film will compare to the rest of his productions.



Martin Scorsese&#39;s Jesus movie is set to begin filming later this year.
