## Literature Review

Over the course of the MCU&#39;s 33 movies and multiple TV shows, many characters have undergone hugely overpowered transformations within the franchise.




The nature of the stories told within the Marvel Cinematic Universe has led to many characters receiving huge power upgrades over the course of the franchise&#39;s narrative. Since the very beginning of the MCU&#39;s movie timeline, the franchise has centered around individuals with remarkable abilities. From brilliant scientific minds to literal gods, the heroes and villains of the MCU vary wildly in nature, but the franchise&#39;s story requires them to transform and adapt as their arcs continue to unfold. In many cases, this evolution leads to hugely overpowered upgrades, with heroes or villains significantly boosted by new abilities.
Though many of these transformations occur on-screen, there are some that remain unseen, with the character in question gaining new powers or abilities between stories. In these cases, the upgrades are all the more apparent, as the character becomes far more powerful from one movie in the MCU to the next. However it may be presented and whatever the underlying narrative reason, here are the 10 most overpowered power upgrades in the MCU after the franchise&#39;s first 33 movies.

Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?












 








 10  Iron Man&#39;s Final Armor Is Incredible 
Avengers: Endgame (2019)
        

Considering that five years passed between the events of Avengers: Infinity War and the beginning of Avengers: Endgame, it makes sense that the surviving heroes might have undergone some changes. Tony Stark might have retired to enjoy family life, but he also seemingly spent those years massively upgrading his armor, with his final suit being the most impressive piece out of all the Iron Man armor in the MCU. Iron Man’s final suit is equipped with several powerful gadgets, but perhaps most notably a built-in Infinity Gauntlet that allows him to make his greatest heroic sacrifice.





 9  Hope Van Dyne Inherits The Wasp Mantle From Her Mother 
Ant-Man And The Wasp (2018)
        

Hope Van Dyne’s first outing in the MCU ends with her being offered a prototype Wasp suit, hinting at her impending upgrade. Considering she spends the entirety of Ant-Man as a CEO, Hope&#39;s transformation into a full-fledged superhero for Ant-Man and the Wasp is a substantial upgrade. Though the inevitable change was teased ahead of time, Hope’s shift in power level from one movie to the next was still considerable with regard to its execution.





 8  Pepper Potts Becomes RESCUE 
Avengers: Endgame (2019)
        

Despite being one of the first characters introduced in the MCU, it took the franchise a long time to give Pepper Potts a power upgrade. After spending multiple movies as Tony Stark’s assistant, business partner, and romantic interest, she eventually appeared in Avengers: Endgame in her own suit of Stark armor. Pepper’s transformation into the hero RESCUE was somewhat unexpected, as the MCU hadn’t made any significant indication that she would become a hero, making the unexpected upgrade all the more memorable.





 7  Banner Becomes Professor Hulk 
Avengers: Endgame (2019)
        

One particularly substantial power upgrade that’s easily missed is Bruce Banner’s off-screen transformation into Professor Hulk. Though it was later explored in MCU TV show She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, the change itself occurred between the events of Infinity War and Endgame. The reason this is such an important change in the MCU is that becoming Professor Hulk allows Banner and Hulk to reconcile their identities into one being that possesses the incredible strength of Hulk and the remarkable intellect of Banner. This is something that’s not only important to Banner himself, but also something that makes him far more powerful within the MCU.





 6  Captain Carter Gets The Infinity Armor (&amp; More Weapons) 
What If...? Season 2 (2023)
        

What If…? season 2 continued the rich MCU tradition of affording massive power upgrades to its characters, with Captain Carter becoming perhaps the most overpowered hero in the entire franchise. While facing the immensely powerful Strange Supreme, Carter receives several items that combine to gift her a highly increased power level. For the fight, she dons the Infinity Armor, as well as Hela’s helmet and a gamma-infused sword that effectively gives her the power of gods. Though she started as a super soldier, What If…? gave Captain Carter the power of the Infinity Stones and various other incredible items.





 5  Scarlet Witch Learns The Darkhold&#39;s Magic 
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)


 







From the moment of her introduction, Wanda Maximoff was one of the most powerful characters in the MCU. However, WandaVision saw her unlocking her true potential as she learned of the nature of her chaos magic and gained knowledge of the Darkhold. The powerful magical artifact corrupted Wanda, turning her into the Scarlet Witch, a reality-warping villain intent on tearing apart the Multiverse to find her children. Scarlet Witch’s transformation from an Avenger to a villain came with a massive power upgrade thanks to the Darkhold and its powerful magical attributes.





 4  Doctor Strange Also Got A Huge Darkhold Power Boost 
Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022)
        

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness might have largely concerned the Scarlet Witch’s power upgrade, but its titular hero also got a big boost over the course of the movie. Doctor Strange 2’s post-credits scene confirms that Strange was permanently changed by his brief use of the Darkhold to stop Wanda, with the hero developing the third eye that he sports in many comic book iterations. This version of Strange presumably possesses the enhanced magical abilities of his comic book counterparts, making the Darkhold directly responsible for two massive power upgrades.





 3  Jane Foster Went From Scientist To Superhero 
Thor: Love and Thunder (2022)


 







Jane Foster might not be the most high-profile character in the MCU, but her transformation came with a major power upgrade. In Thor and Thor: The Dark World, Jane is an astrophysicist and Thor’s love interest. After her absence in Ragnarok, she returned in Thor: Love and Thunder infinitely more powerful as The Mighty Thor. After being given the power of Thor by Mjolnir, Jane goes from being an ordinary human to possessing the power of the gods, making her power upgrade both notable and a huge change for the character.





 2  Ultron&#39;s Multiverse Glow-Up 
What If...? Season 1 (2021)


 







Despite being one of the most powerful villains in Marvel Comics, Ultron’s MCU debut scaled back his true potential by having him defeated in the span of a single movie. However, What If…? season 1 changed that, showing an alternate reality in which Ultron won. This Multiversal iteration of Ultron possessed god-like powers, including near-omniscience and the ability to harness the Infinity Stones to wipe out almost all life in the universe. As such, the What If...? version of Ultron is one of the most powerful beings in the multiverse, making it a significant upgrade from his depiction in Age of Ultron.





 1  Loki Becomes A True God 
Loki Season 2 (2023)
        

Although Loki was introduced to the MCU as a powerful Asgardian god, Loki season 2 actually made him truly worthy of the title. Previously, Loki’s powers largely consisted of using illusions to trick others, but his involvement with the TVA and his attempts to preserve the multiverse saw him receive a huge power boost. In the Loki season 2 ending, Loki saves the multiverse by becoming the God of Stories, making him one of the most powerful characters in the entire franchise. Loki’s upgrade also serves as perhaps the most substantial transformation in the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making it even more noteworthy.
