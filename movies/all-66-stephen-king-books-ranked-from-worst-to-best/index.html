  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Stephen King has written over 200 short stories and novels, with at least one of his book adaptations being released every year since 1980.
Some of King&rsquo;s books, such as Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, were regarded as disappointing and even disliked by the author himself.
Despite occasional misses, Stephen King&rsquo;s novels are highly regarded in the horror genre, with each book possessing its own unique quality and ranking.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Over the course of his literary career, Stephen King has crafted 66 novels and over 200 short stories, but how do his books compare to one another?</p>
<p>As the king of horror, almost all the 66 Stephen King books ranked among the best in the genre. When he authored Carrie, his first novel, in 1974, his name immediately skyrocketed to one of the most recognizable in the horror genre — both for his novels and short stories. Studios noticed Stephen King&rsquo;s literary talent and were quick to offer movie adaptations immediately. Carrie was picked up by director Brian De Palma to be adapted into a movie starring Sissy Spacek as the titular character. Since then, King has been a powerhouse with new stories and movie/TV adaptations coming from the mind of horror&rsquo;s most cherished author every year, but how do they compare?
King has authored over 200 short stories and novellas, as well as 65 novels. Carrie was his first movie adaptation, but it was nowhere near the last. Movie adaptations of Stephen King books are released at the same frequency as his literary tales, with at least one making its debut every year since 1980. There are numerous upcoming King stories in development to become a series or movie. King has quickly become known as the king of literary horror, with a legacy that could make his last name the definition of the genre. Each of Stephen King&rsquo;s novels is impeccable in its own right, but some Stephen King books ranked higher than others.</p>
<p>10 Wild Theories That Completely Change Stephen King Movies
Stephen King movies have made way for a variety of theories, and if some of them were true, they would completely change one or more movies.</p>
<p>Stephen King&rsquo;s short story collections are not included in this list.</p>
<p>66  Dreamcatcher
March 20, 2001</p>
<p>Stephen King&rsquo;s Dreamcatcher amalgamates some of horror&rsquo;s greatest sci-fi elements, including alien invasion and body horror. The story is set in Derry, Maine, one of the three fictional towns that King created for his literary multiverse. Dreamcatcher has some captivating moments but leads to underwhelming scenes and dialogue that could&rsquo;ve been bettered had its plot not been reliant on so many sub-genres meshing together. Despite its closeness to the source material, even the movie adaptation is regarded as one of King&rsquo;s worst though some find it underrated. King himself said he doesn&rsquo;t like Dreamcatcher very much (via Rolling Stone).</p>
<p>65  The Tommyknockers
November 1987</p>
<p>The Tommyknockers is a Lovecraftian tale with Stephen King stylization, However, it was also one of King&rsquo;s first attempts to go outside the horror genre with a pure sci-fi tale here. There are horror elements, as King drifts into hints of body horror in the story, but at the end of the day, this ended up as one of King&rsquo;s lesser-liked books in his illustrious career. Not only was it disappointing for fans at the time of its release, but it is one of the books King himself hates the most. King blames the poor writing on his drug use at the time, and he calls it an &ldquo;awful book&rdquo; that had some good ideas underneath it all (via Rolling Stone).</p>
<p>64  Cell
February 2006</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing that Stephen King books do well, it&rsquo;s the apocalypse. In the 2006 novel Cell, a New England artist discovers that a bizarre cellular signal transforms people into zombie-like creatures. It is no George A. Romero horror story, but it is King&rsquo;s valiant attempt at making his mark in the zombie horror sub-genre. Due to the vast amount of literature featuring the living dead, it reads as an unremarkable tale that could&rsquo;ve been far better had he focused more on the technological aspects and social commentary that was woven into Cell. It was mostly lightweight stuff and the movie that resulted received terrible reviews.</p>
<p>63  Rose Madder
July 1995</p>
<p>Rose Madder features a common theme in King&rsquo;s stories: domestic violence. It is an unbelievable tale about a woman named Rose who dares to leave her abusive husband before he has the chance to take her life. Rose then finds a painting where she sees her life mirrored in the painting, as it constantly changes and soon Rose has to help a woman in the painting save her baby while having to protect herself when her abusive husband finds her. While its story is important, the book&rsquo;s fantasy elements threaten to overwhelm the true message. King said in his memoir On Writing that he was &ldquo;trying too hard&rdquo; when writing this novel.</p>
<p>62  The Regulators
September 1996</p>
<p>Stephen King returned to his pseudonym of Richard Bachman years after retiring the name with the book The Regulators. Unlike the previous Bachman novels, King let his fans know this was him as he released it simultaneously with Desperation in 1996. The two novels act as mirror stories to one another, taking place in a parallel universe with the same characters - but in very different situations. King wanted to tell two stories - a horror tale under the name King and a more fantasy story under the Bachman name. The Regulators is more complex than Desperation but wasn&rsquo;t quite as strong of a tale.</p>
<p>61  Gwendy&rsquo;s Button Box
May 2017</p>
<p>While Gwendy&rsquo;s Button Box is considered a novella, it is consistently listed under King&rsquo;s bibliography of full-length novels. He co-wrote the story with Richard Chizmar, and it follows the story of a young girl named Gwendy Peterson, who lives in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. Castle Rock, King&rsquo;s most beloved fictional town, returns to his novels for the first time since he said goodbye in Needful Things. It isn&rsquo;t a very remarkable story, as it is composed of remnants of each author that merge into an account that only strengthens the mythos of Castle Rock rather than Gwendy&rsquo;s experiences in the town.</p>
<p>60  From A Buick 8
September 2002</p>
<p>King has written several stories about cars throughout his career. From A Buick 8 features a supernatural car that can shift between worlds. It&rsquo;s an entirely different take on his first story about a possessed car, Christine, but its uniqueness does not make it better than its predecessor. It lacks the excitement attached to a killer Stephen King car story and opts for a bizarre story about a car that can travel between worlds instead. This is far more reminiscent of Charlie Manx&rsquo;s Rolls-Royce Wraith in Joe Hill&rsquo;s novel, NOS4A2. The story has little in the way of a plot arc, but the idea of a kid learning more about his dad through the car is pure King.</p>
<p>59  Gwendy&rsquo;s Final Task
February 15, 2022</p>
<p>Stephen King collaborated with fellow writer Richard Chizmar to write the Gwendy&rsquo;s Button Box trilogy. In this finale, the mysterious and destructive button box makes its final appearance after Gwendy reaches fame as a successful novelist and rising political star. Gwendy reconciles with the box, drawn to both its remarkable effects on well-being and its terrible power. King gets the chance to bring in more of his favorite sci-fi influences, as the main character must go from King&rsquo;s cursed Castle Rock to the MF-1 space station. The stakes are incredibly high in the book, but King and Chizmar have distinctly different styles, and the change in tone hurts here.</p>
<p>58  The Running Man
May 1982</p>
<p>Set in 2025, The Running Man tells the story of Ben Richards as he participates in a game show that shares a title with the novel. The contestants are required to outrun hunters who are sent out to kill them under the totalitarian regime of the new world. The Running Man is as if Stephen King had written a long-form episode of Black Mirror. The book features elements of Charlie Brooker&rsquo;s series with its dystopian setting and the exploration of technology&rsquo;s impact on the world. The Running Man was also a Richard Bachman book that predicted the rise of reality television two decades before it became such a successful genre.</p>
<p>57  Thinner
November 1984</p>
<p>Billy Halleck is cursed by a Romani man named Taduz Lemke after killing an elderly woman in a car accident - and getting away with it in court. Soon, he begins to shed weight at an alarming rate. While doctors speculate that he likely has cancer, others involved in his legal battle begin to show signs of growing scales and painful acne, all of which were not present before the case. Thinner has not aged well due to its ascription of curses alongside Romani people and their culture, but its story remains socially relevant. At its core, the novel is about the pressures of weight loss and disordered eating.</p>
<p>56  Sleeping Beauties
September 2017</p>
<p>While King&rsquo;s works with his son, Joe Hill, are the most well-known King family collaborations, he also co-authored a novel with his youngest son, Owen. Sleeping Beauties features women wrapped in gauze who could become feral if given the opportunity. It is a bizarre story that includes a somewhat Biblical character named Evie, the only woman who is immune to the illness that is causing women to fall into deep slumbers. This global pandemic is unlike any other in King&rsquo;s repertoire, making it stand out among the rest of his novels that feature a dystopian world or apocalyptic disaster.</p>
<p>55  Rage
September 1977</p>
<p>Rage is the first novel King penned under the name Richard Bachman. Since he was restricted to publishing one book a year, he created Bachman to produce more content outside the horror genre. Rage is also the only book that King wrote that he has taken off the market because of the rash of school shootings across America. The story is good, but it is a challenging read that struggles when putting readers in the mind of the school shooter. Rage&rsquo;s ending is particularly maddening, as it finds the school shooter with a somewhat sympathetic ending where he is found not guilty due to his mental instability; his victims find no justice.</p>
<p>54  Elevation
October 2018</p>
<p>When Scott Carey discovers that he has contracted a strange illness, he is faced with several symptoms that are nothing short of bizarre. Set in Castle Rock, Maine, Elevation includes social and political discourse intertwined with an otherworldly story of a man struggling to be cured of his new ailment. It is considered a sequel to Gwendy&rsquo;s Button Box, but it is more of a soft sequel than anything. It isn&rsquo;t an entirely remarkable tale, as its attempt at detailing specific social problems in the world tends to fall short of achieving its intended purpose.</p>
<p>53  The Gunslinger (Dark Tower Book #1)
October 1978</p>
<p>The Gunslinger is the first installment in King&rsquo;s The Dark Tower series. It introduces Roland Deschain, one of the last remaining gunslingers, who must navigate a fantastical world filled with demons, monstrous creatures, and more. While it is not a particularly bad novel, it&rsquo;s the weakest of the books in that particular series. Stephen King is primarily recognized for his horror novels, and The Gunslinger is far more fantasy-oriented than anything he had done before this 1982 book. It was new to the author&rsquo;s general wheelhouse, and it seems that King struggled to get his pacing right with this introduction to the Dark Tower.</p>
<p>52  Insomnia
October 1994</p>
<p>When Ralph Roberts of Derry, Maine, begins to experience severe insomnia, his sleep deprivation allows for supernatural abilities to develop. He perceives people&rsquo;s auras as well as entities that are divided into &ldquo;The Purpose&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Random.&rdquo; It is an investigation into the realities of life while questioning the concepts of fate and destiny. Insomnia ties in with several Stephen King books, including The Dark Tower, IT, Dreamcatcher, Black House, and Pet Sematary. While it could be perceived as solely serving the purpose of being a universe-building device, the lengthy novel uniquely captures the impact of insomnia on the human psyche as well as life&rsquo;s greater design.</p>
<p>51  Song Of Susannah (Dark Tower Book #6)
June 2004</p>
<p>While some book series get better over time, The Dark Tower&rsquo;s sixth novel, Song Of Susannah, proved that some things don&rsquo;t always hold up over the years. The fantastical elements are only utilized in an attempt to connect Stephen King&rsquo;s massive multiverse, as the characters find themselves in the author&rsquo;s own home with a copy of his novel &lsquo;Salem&rsquo;s Lot. Thanks to the personal Easter eggs King includes (including Father Callahan from Salem&rsquo;s Lot), Song Of Susannah remains slightly better than the first novel in the series. However, it was appreciated by genre fans as it won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 2005.</p>
<p>50  Blaze
June 2007</p>
<p>Clayton &ldquo;Blaze&rdquo; Blaisdell Jr. is a con artist who plans on kidnapping a wealthy man&rsquo;s son in hopes of making his partner in crime proud. While the story is somewhat cut and dry, it is complicated by Blaze&rsquo;s mental disability, similar to The Stand&rsquo;s Trashcan Man. It impacts the entire storyline and creates a terrifying image of manipulation and coercion. Blaze, written using the pseudonym Richard Bachman, was a complex story to craft and navigate for the author, which shows through each page as Blaze&rsquo;s character is confronted with the spirit of his partner in crime. King wrote this novel before he wrote Carrie, but published it decades later (via Lilja&rsquo;s Library).</p>
<p>49  The Dark Tower (Dark Tower Book #7)
September 2004</p>
<p>The Dark Tower&rsquo;s seventh installment and the final chapter of the story, The Dark Tower, features Stephen King as a secondary character. This time, Jake rescues King from the van that nearly killed him in 1999. It is an interesting read and showcases the author&rsquo;s ability to weave his personal stories into the greater narratives of his fantastical and horrific tales. Despite all of its good aspects, several elements introduced in this book cause the overall series to become a bit more complex than is entirely necessary. The book won the British Fantasy Award in 2005 but was polarizing to many fans of the series.</p>
<p>48  Roadwork
March 1981</p>
<p>A Richard Bachman book, Roadwork tells the story of Barton George Dawes. While grieving over the loss of his child and divorce, he delves further into mental instability with the news that he will be left homeless and jobless as an interstate makes its way through his Midwestern town. The Stephen King book is currently in development to become a full-length movie with Andy Muschietti (IT: Chapter One and IT: Chapter Two) set to produce it and Pablo Trapero as its director. The story is a personal one, as King said he wrote it to come to terms with his mother&rsquo;s death (via The Guardian).
&ldquo;I think it was an effort to make some sense of my mother&rsquo;s painful death the year before – a lingering cancer had taken her off inch by painful inch. Following this death I was left both grieving and shaken by the apparent senselessness of it all&hellip; Roadwork tries so hard to be good and find some answers to the conundrum of human pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>47  Bag Of Bones
September 1998</p>
<p>After author Mike Noonan&rsquo;s pregnant wife unexpectedly dies, he is sent into a state of writer&rsquo;s block that he is desperate to break free from. He isolates himself at a lakeside home in Maine in hopes of bringing back his authorial spark. While there, he meets a young widowed mother and her daughter and develops a psychic connection with the girl. This is where it becomes a riveting paranormal story, but it leaves a lot of questions unanswered. The book is considered one of King&rsquo;s most literary novels as he tells his own story of the struggle writers go through.</p>
