# Only 1 MCU Release In 2024 Isnt A Spin-Off


## SUMMARY 



  The Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 5 in 2024 will feature mostly spin-off TV shows based on previous MCU properties, with only Deadpool 3 being a standalone movie.   Deadpool 3 will bridge the MCU to the Fox X-Men universe, potentially bringing in multiple X-Men characters and expanding the mutant presence in the MCU.   X-Men &#39;97, a highly anticipated Marvel property, is a sequel to the X-Men Animated Series and is not part of the MCU, but its reality may be referenced in future MCU properties.

## Literature Review
The MCU&#39;s 2024 slate of film and TV properties will largely consist of spinoffs, save for one highly anticipated movie.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe Phase 5 will continue in 2024, but only one of its forthcoming properties is not a spin-off. Amidst a variety of shakeups and delays, 2024’s slate of MCU Phase 5 properties will include several TV shows and one highly anticipated movie, continuing the MCU’s Multiverse Saga as it builds towards its finale, which will likely be altered significantly following the firing of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror. 2024’s MCU properties will, fittingly, take place across various realities, with most tying into the main MCU timeline.




2024 was initially set to include Captain America: Brave New World – a film that continues the saga of Sam Wilson as the new Captain America following the Avengers: Endgame ending and The Falcon and the Winter Solider – which would itself lead into Marvel’s Thunderbolts. With both films delayed, the only MCU movie releasing in 2024 is Deadpool 3, a film that will bridge the MCU to the Fox X-Men universe and potentially many other familiar realities. As for the rest of 2024’s MCU releases, they will be spin off TV shows based on previous MCU properties.

 Deadpool 3 Is The Only MCU Release Of 2024 That Isn&#39;t A Spin-Off 
          




The MCU will begin its 2024 slate with Echo, a series centered on Maya Lopez, who was introduced in 2021’s Hawkeye. Agatha: Darkhold Diaries will see the return of Agatha Harness, the antagonist and breakout character of WandaVision. Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man – fascinatingly – is an animated series based on Spider-Man: Homecoming, featuring an alternate version of the MCU in which Peter Parker is mentored by Norman Osborn instead of Tony Stark. The upcoming Eyes Of Wakanda animated series will further explore the history of Wakanda established in Black Panther and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, and Marvel Zombies will be based on an episode of Marvel’s What If…? season 1.

Deadpool 3, however, will not be a spinoff of a previous MCU property. The film will likely have massive ramifications for the main MCU timeline, bringing not only Deadpool into the MCU but also potentially many other X-Men characters. The X-Men’s introduction to the MCU is inevitable, but with the Fox X-Men universe being bridged to the MCU, it is now possible that the MCU’s mutants (other than Wade Wilson) may come from multiple realities.

 X-Men &#39;97 Is A Sequel (But It&#39;s Not In The MCU) 
          

One highly anticipated Marvel property due to be released in 2024 is X-Men ’97, which, notably, is not a spinoff but rather a sequel to the beloved X-Men Animated Series. X-Men ’97, despite being produced by Marvel Studios Animation, is not set in the MCU, though considering the multiversal premise of Marvel’s current properties, it is safe to assume that its reality may be referenced in future MCU properties. As it stands, the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Ms. Marvel each reference the original X-Men Animated Series.
