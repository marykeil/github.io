# The Most Overused Superhero Movie Trope Is The Key To Save This $1.4 Billion Franchise


## SUMMARY 



  The Terminator franchise has struggled to maintain success and quality beyond the first two movies due to confusing timelines and flawed sequels.   Embracing the multiverse concept could help reignite the franchise by allowing for a fresh start while still maintaining connections to the established lore.   Introducing a multiverse would solve canon problems and provide flexibility for narrative choices, including the ability to move away from iconic characters or even recast them without the film being a full reboot.

## Literature Review

Superhero films are currently facing their own share of challenges, but one overused comic book trope could actually help the Terminator franchise.




The Terminator franchise, which includes some of the most influential sci-fi movies and characters of all time, could benefit from an overused superhero movie trope. Although James Cameron’s Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day are some of the best movies in their respective genres, none of the other Terminator films could match the success or the quality of the first two installments. Not only that, but the Terminator movie timeline has grown incredibly confusing, with contradicting sequels and a forever-changing canon.




From a direct sequel to Judgment Day to a prequel to retcons and reboots, the Terminator franchise has tried it all. However, the saga has struggled to find its identity, with each new movie or TV show released after T2 having way too many flaws. Not even ignoring everything that came after Terminator 2 and rewriting the saga’s canon, like Terminator: Dark Fate did, worked. That said, given how big the IP is, it seems likely that a new Terminator movie will happen eventually.


 The Terminator Franchise Should Embrace The Multiverse 
         

Of all the options available for Terminator 7 or any new project in the franchise that wants to reignite the saga, the multiverse may be one of the most promising. At a time when superhero movies from both Marvel and DC have relied on the multiverse concept partially as a way to create fun crossovers and bring legacy characters back, bringing alternate universes into Terminator may not seem like a good idea at first. The multiverse has quickly become an overused concept, especially because it is often used as a gimmick rather than an essential part of a story.






The multiverse gimmick technically already exists in Terminator, as Terminator: Genisys explored how small changes can create new versions of the story




However, from the perspective of the Terminator franchise, diving into alternate universes as a way to reboot the saga without disregarding what has been done already could work. Terminator could start a new series of movies set in a different universe from the ones in which previous films have taken place, featuring minimal but important connections to the saga’s established lore. Therefore, the new Terminator movie could write a new canon from scratch without it actually being a reboot.



 Terminator’s Confusing Timelines Means It Could Easily Introduce A Multiverse 
          

A movie reboot does not need an in-universe explanation like the multiverse to justify its existence. In other words, if Terminator 7 were to be a full reboot, it could still work just fine. However, considering how Terminator has always been defined by confusing timelines and different versions of the same characters and stories, the saga could easily incorporate the multiverse. The multiverse gimmick technically already exists in Terminator, as Terminator: Genisys explored how small changes can create new versions of the story. In a way, every single Terminator timeline is already its separate universe.





 

Properly establishing the existence of a multiverse would solve a lot of canon problems for Terminator, which never followed a proper chronology after Judgment Day. For example, the Sarah Connor Chronicles show ignores Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, whereas Dark Fate assumes neither happened. Genisys tried to make sense of the franchise’s confusing timelines and failed, which does not mean Terminator should not try to acknowledge its multiple “universes.” Even if the next film embraces the multiverse, it doesn’t have to be entirely about time travel and alternate realities like Genisys was.



 A Multiverse Would Allow Terminator To Move Away From Schwarzenegger’s T-800 
          




Even though Terminator has given up having a consistent canon a long time ago, the movies are still tied to the iconic characters and events set up in the first two films. Genisys purposefully tried to recreate classic sequences from Terminator and Terminator 2, whereas Dark Fate tried to be its own version of Judgement Day. That is not to mention how Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800, and the many variations of the character, have appeared in all Terminator movies. Even Salvation, set “before” the first film, briefly included the T-800. It is time for Terminator to move beyond its most famous films.

                  All 5 Sequels To Terminator 2 Explained (&amp; How They Fit In The Timeline)   Terminator movies deal with time travel, with the characters moving through time, but with so many entries in the franchise, the timeline gets messy.   

Every Terminator film has had to deal with the expectations generated by the previous installments, especially regarding how legacy characters were going to be handled. Dark Fate was criticized for killing off John Connor, just like Genisys’ version of the T-800 did not work very well. A reboot set in a completely different universe would not have to worry about legacy characters, even though it could reference them through the multiverse. Leaning into alternate realities could also help Terminator recast iconic characters, offering an in-universe reason to have new actors tackle names like Sarah Connor and the T-800.
