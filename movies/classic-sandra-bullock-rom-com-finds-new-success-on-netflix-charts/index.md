## Literature Review

After first hitting theaters in 2009, a classic Sandra Bullock romantic comedy movie has found big success on the Netflix top 10 charts.




The Proposal, a 2009 romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock, has earned itself a spot in the Netflix top 10 list. Directed by Anne Fletcher, The Proposal features Bullock as Margaret Tate, a businesswoman who attempts to marry her assistant, a role played memorably by Ryan Reynolds, to avoid being deported back to Canada. The film earned mixed reviews from critics, but was a box office success.




Now, The Proposal has nabbed a spot in Netflix&#39;s top 10 list for the week of January 8 to 14. The romantic comedy occupies the number four spot on the list, clocking an impressive 8.8 million hours viewed and 4.9 million views in total. The Proposal is beaten out of the top three by The Equalizer 3, Transporter 2, and Lift. Check out a chart of the full top 10 below:

 Why Movies Like The Proposal Don&#39;t Get Made As Much Anymore 
Did Streaming Kill The Theatrical Rom-Com?
Made on a budget of $40 million, The Proposal would be quite a risky proposition in today&#39;s current theatrical landscape. The Bullock and Reynolds film managed to impress at the box office, ultimately grossing over $317 million worldwide. Box office performance like this, however, generally just doesn&#39;t happen anymore for the romantic comedy genre.

After success in the 2000s, the mid and late-2010s saw the mid-budget rom-com slowly transition from being a theatrical experience to one mostly relegated to streaming. 2010 alone saw the release of a number of romantic comedy movies, including Leap Year, Life As We Know It, When In Rome, The Bounty Hunter, She&#39;s Out Of My League, Killers, and The Back-up Plan, among others. While many of these films were successful, the next ten years would see a steady decline as audiences came to expect these types of films to go straight to streaming.

                  10 2000s Rom-Com Couples With The Best Chemistry   From Bridget Jones and Mark Darcy to Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton in Something&#39;s Gotta Give, the 2000s were full of well-matched romcom couples.   




The genre certainly isn&#39;t dead, however, and new rom-coms are released fairly regularly on streaming, they just don&#39;t often feature the same budget or big-name actors. Recent theatrical releases like Anyone But You and No Hard Feelings are clear attempts to recapture some of this late-aughts rom-com magic, but these films were also sold on their raunchy, R-rated antics. The Proposal&#39;s recent success on streaming is a reminder that audience interest in the genre remains, but it remains to be seen whether this will ever translate into a theatrical comeback for the rom-com.
