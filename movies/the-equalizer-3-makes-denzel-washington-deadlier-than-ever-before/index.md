## Literature Review

The Equalizer 3 sends the franchise off in a blaze of glory by making Denzel Washington&#39;s Robert McCall the deadliest he has ever been yet.




Robert McCall killed a record number of people in The Equalizer 3, making Denzel Washington&#39;s titular vigilante the deadliest he had ever been in the whole of the franchise. Washington and returning director Antoine Fuqua partnered once again for the third and final installment of The Equalizer franchise, which saw McCall enter into his most difficult and dangerous escapade yet. Not only did McCall have to contend with the vicious Mafia-type criminal organization known as the Camorra, but he had to do so with the right amount of flair to send the concluding franchise off with a bang.




In Southern Italy, the Camorra terrorized a small Italian town called Altamonte with the intent of taking over the land for commercialization purposes. The Equalizer 3 recalled the best parts of Fuqua and Washington&#39;s action-thriller franchise to handle the threat, packing its moments with enough aggressive kills, slow-burning tension, and dynamic action sequences that it became the highest-scoring film of The Equalizer franchise by critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Of course, McCall was a principle component in the neutralization of the Camorra, producing a massive kill count of gangsters high enough to set a record among the three films and exhilarating enough to end the franchise in an enjoyable way. 



The Equalizer 3 is now available to stream on Netflix and is available for purchase on digital platforms, including Apple TV, Prime Video, and YouTube.

In his deadliest display of skill, McCall killed about 26 people in The Equalizer 3. His killing spree began at the very start of The Equalizer movie, at which time, about a dozen criminals fell prey to McCall&#39;s vigilantism at a secluded winery in Sicily, including the crime boss and Camorra affiliate, Lorenzo Vitale. Because he was wounded in the interaction with Vitale, McCall was transported to Altamonte, where he witnessed firsthand how the Camorra instilled their reign of terror upon the town and learned that their mission was carried out by brothers, Vincent and Marco Quaranta.

After making it his mission to stop the criminal organization at its source, McCall got the chance to wipe out the younger brother of the two in a scene that saw Marco and three other Camorra members meet their fate. Marco and his henchman were ambushed by McCall, who sent a car flying into their group before stabbing Vincent several times.  r to The Equalizer 3&#39;s ending, Vincent was met with an even worse fate, as McCall infiltrated his home, killed several of his patrolling henchmen, and forced him to take a drug that slowly and painfully ended his life.






 The Equalizer 3 Nearly Features More Deaths Than The Previous Two Movies Combined 
          

McCall&#39;s campaign against the Camorra and the Quaranta brothers ended up being his deadliest yet, and he almost racked up enough bodies to rival his total kill count in the last two Equalizer movies combined. In the debut Equalizer movie, McCall killed 19 people, while in The Equalizer 2, he killed only 9. With 26 total kills attested for in The Equalizer 3 movie compared to the 28 that were accounted for in the rest of the franchise, McCall&#39;s deadly performance was record-breaking and exceedingly thrilling, setting the final film apart from the latter two movies and sending the franchise off in a blaze of glory.
