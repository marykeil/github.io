## Literature Review

While some movies benefit from prior knowledge, others thrive on the magic of going in with absolutely no preconceived notions.





While some movies follow predictable paths, where a bit of prior knowledge about the plot is anticipated, there are instances when the true magic of a film unfolds when you enter with absolutely no preconceived notions. When a new film is preparing for release, trailers and teasers often reveal glimpses of the story. Analysis of these previews frequently inundate the internet, with many guessing at the plot. This is especially common for big franchise movies, but not exclusive to them. With so much information circulating beforehand, one can unintentionally find out more than they wished regarding twists, surprises, and other aspects that are best discovered during viewing.
Consequently, certain films are preferably watched without any prior knowledge. Consider the exponentially increased enjoyment of twist-ending films like The Sixth Sense or The Usual Suspects if their secrets remain veiled before viewing. Though not all require such purity, the movies showcased here have embedded surprises that unfold with maximum impact only for the uninitiated viewer. These underappreciated gems contain something special that sparks most vibrantly when entered fresh and uninformed.









 








 15  The Cabin In The Woods (2011) 
A fun film that transcends horror tropes
        

  The Cabin in the Woods  


  Release Date    April 13, 2012     Director    Drew Goddard     Cast    Richard Jenkins , Fran Kranz , Chris Hemsworth , Bradley Whitford , Kristen Connolly     Rating    R    


While The Cabin in the Woods appears at first to be a standard horror film set in an isolated cabin, it rapidly transforms into a wildly imaginative deconstruction of the entire genre. Veteran viewers will likely predict the initial twists and turns, having seen countless takes on these familiar slasher tropes before. However, the film soon spirals into creative territory far beyond the average horror fan&#39;s expectations. Without spoiling any specifics, the less known going in, the more the film&#39;s ambitious mythology and rewarding surprises will catch viewers off-guard. Much is gained by entering The Cabin in the Woods uninformed, allowing its clever reinvention of horror conventions to fully astonish.





 14  Parasite (2019) 
A genre-shifting narrative best appreciated going in blind


 







  Parasite  


  Release Date    November 8, 2019     Director    Bong Joon Ho     Cast    Yeo-Jeong Jo , Myeong-hoon Park , Jeong-eun Lee , Sun-kyun Lee , Ji-so Jung , So-dam Park , Keun-rok Park , Kang-ho Song , Ji-hye Lee , Woo-sik Choi , Seo-joon Park , Hye-jin Jang     Rating    R    


Parasite masterfully subverts expectations by shape-shifting genres midway through the film. It begins almost like a comedy, satirizing social classes through the story of a destitute family infiltrating a wealthy household. The witty, offbeat humor hooks those unfamiliar with director Bong Joon-Ho&#39;s love of tonal shifts. Just when the class commentary seems established, Parasite takes a sudden dark turn, never looking back. To fully appreciate the film’s masterful descent into shocking territory, it’s best to enter blindly, with no hints of the twists in store. The less known about the film’s unpredictable second half, the more jaw-dropping and powerful its bold narrative choices land.

 13  Memento (2000) 
The reverse narrative best disorients first-time viewers
        

  Memento  


  Release Date    May 25, 2001     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Joe Pantoliano , Guy Pearce , Carrie-Anne Moss , Stephen Tobolowsky , Mark Boone Junior     Rating    R    


Memento stunned in 2000 by telling its unconventional story backwards, epitomizing the phrase &#34;original mind-blower.&#34; Those encountering the inventive premise cold will share that exhilarating disorientation. Meanwhile, most trailers explain the reverse-chronological structure, defusing its discombobulating effects for new viewers. Additionally, one of Christopher Nolan&#39;s best movies hinges on last-act surprises that partition the story into illuminating recontextualization. Going in blank allows the nonlinear narrative to cascade over audiences, embedding puzzles that resolve as climactic revelations. Memento rewards unwitting viewers that embrace disconcertment, leaning into Christopher Nolan’s talents for confusion and surprise rather than dodging them.





 12  10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) 
Little knowledge keeps the thrills heightened


 







  10 Cloverfield Lane  


  Release Date    March 10, 2016     Director    Dan Trachtenberg     Cast    John Goodman , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , John Gallagher Jr. , Douglas M. Griffin , Suzanne Cryer , Bradley Cooper     Rating    PG-13    


10 Cloverfield Lane thrives on veiled mysteries, withholding just enough information to keep audiences guessing until late revelations rewrite assumptions. Early publicity left the connection to 2008’s Cloverfield opaque, already sparking speculative theories. Trailers maintain this shroud of uncertainty around the premise&#39;s precise details. Going in blind allows the film’s tense, confined thriller story to shine, anchored in questions of what dangers lurk outside. Only by preserving the enigmas within the bunker can the unpredictable twists and turns land with their intended weight. Missing clues accumulate for those encountering the 10 Cloverfield Lane ending fresh, untainted by outside speculation.





 11  Shutter Island (2010) 
Gives the most startling shifts


 







  Shutter Island  


  Release Date    February 19, 2010     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Max Von Sydow , Ben Kingsley , Leonardo DiCaprio , Michelle Williams , Mark Ruffalo     Rating    R    


Shutter Island leans on its ominous noir aesthetics to pull audiences astray, first establishing a moody 1950s detective story. As Leonardo DiCaprio investigates strange events at a remote mental hospital, Martin Scorsese plants clues suggesting a familiar crime thriller is unfolding. While the initial framework soon cracks, the narrative gives way to an identity crisis, questioning all the preceding assumptions. Letting the destabilization unfold freely, without giving away any hints about the film&#39;s surprises, enhances the full impact of Shutter Island&#39;s twist ending. The film intentionally misleads, rewarding those navigating its shifting maze without knowledge.





 10  Coherence (2013) 
Guessing what will happen amplifies the payoff
        

The low-key relationship drama Coherence may not seem to offer much in the way of surprise on the surface. However, its dinner party conversations and character tensions prove a subtle backdrop for the film’s central mystery: the passing of a comet overhead. While it is easy to reveal too much, the less known going in, the more rewarding the clever sci-fi concepts lurking beneath the dialogue&#39;s heavy exterior become. What begins mundane slowly pivots into the uncanny, never signaling exactly where things will conclude. Rather than dampening intrigue with explanation, Coherence allows its strangeness to compound with bold patience.





 9  Exit Through The Gift Shop (2010) 
The blurred truths make this documentary the most compelling
        

The documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop chronicles street artist Mr. Brainwash’s rise to fame, as filmed by the elusive Banksy. Yet the story’s flexible relationship with truth shrouds it in enticing mystery. Does it present authentic footage or another Banksy stunt satirizing the art scene? The film’s masterful blending of fact and possible fabrication relies on this strategic ambiguity. Banksy leaves the exact parameters of fiction versus reality undefined. Experiencing the unpredictable unfolding of events, gradually accumulating details without certainty, adds to the overall reward of the experience. Embracing the guessing game results in disorienting possibilities multiplying scene by scene.





 8  Fresh (2022) 
Little expectations will further the shocking journey
        

  Fresh  


  Release Date    March 4, 2022     Director    Mimi Cave     Cast    Andrea Bang , Daisy Edgar-Jones , Dayo Okeniyi , Brett Dier , Charlotte Le Bon , Sebastian Stan , Jonica T. Gibbs     Rating    R    


Initially, Fresh appears to be a modern dating parable, following a young woman struggling to find a worthwhile partner. When she finally connects with a charming man, the film seems set as a romantic comedy. However, the delayed opening title hints that the first assumptions may prove false. What unfolds thereafter intentionally misdirects, lulling viewers into expecting one genre before exploding conventions. Where Fresh ultimately arrives, it contains surprises that can’t be spoiled. Going in blind allows the film to reveal its provocative premise organically, building tension through mundane scenes before its daring plot pivots into the unconventional.

 7  Oldboy (2003) 
This notorious ending hits harders unspoiled
        

  Oldboy  


  Release Date    November 21, 2003     Director    Park Chan-wook     Cast    Choi Min-sik , Yoo Ji-tae , Kang Hye-jung , Kim Byeong-Ok , Oh Tae-kyung , Yoon Jin-seo , Woo Il-han , Ji Dae-Han     Rating    R    


Oldboy follows a man imprisoned for 15 years without explanation, seeking vengeance upon his sudden release. Unraveling the conspiracy behind his captivity, Dae-su fights through superbly choreographed action sequences and shadowy underworld figures. All this leads to a now-infamous climactic twist that has become Oldboy&#39;s calling card. While many know of its taboo-shattering reveal, preserving the surprise amplifies its visceral, gut-punch power. Park Chan-wook masterfully manufactures an intense thriller narrative that subverts expectations most radically for uninitiated viewers. Discovering Oldboy’s secrets alongside Dae-su creates the most immersive and hard-hitting experience, building to a famously flooring finale.





 6  Gone Girl (2014) 
Tension peaks when twists remain obscured
        

  Gone Girl  


  Release Date    October 1, 2014     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Ben Affleck , Rosamund Pike , Neil Patrick Harris , Tyler Perry , Carrie Coon , Kim Dickens     Rating    9.50    


When Nick Dunne’s glamorous wife Amy mysteriously vanishes, his life unravels under the spotlight of a media frenzy and criminal investigation. As speculation swirls, Gone Girl initially reveals only fragments of Nick and Amy’s relationship. Through calculated pacing, David Fincher immerses the audience alongside Nick, experiencing chilling reveals as the harrowing truths emerge. Knowing the story’s infamous twists prematurely defuses this tension. Instead, allowing Gone Girl’s secrets to cascade with strategic patience makes this descent into marital demise the most engaging. Embracing the film’s suspicions over concrete answers yields the ideal thriller.





 5  The Menu (2022) 
Success lies in its unexpected turns
        

  The Menu  


  Release Date    November 18, 2022     Director    Mark Mylod     Cast    Ralph Fiennes , Anya Taylor-Joy , Nicholas Hoult , Hong Chau , Janet McTeer , Reed Birney , Judith Light , John Leguizamo     Rating    R    


The Menu entices with its high-concept premise of an exclusive island restaurant helmed by a celebrity chef serving peculiar surprises. The film soon transcends its eccentric fine dining trappings by entering unpredictable territory. While billed as a sharp-witted class satire, precisely how far it pushes this subtext remains a mystery. Revealed plots barely scratch the surface of the bizarre insanity that unfolds dish by dish. Allowing the film’s increasingly unhinged progression to crescendo without hints makes its unsettling transformations the best. Drawn in by the hook and cast of The Menu, the less disclosed about the provocative finale, the more it firmly entwines.





 4  Barbarian (2022) 
Lots of unexpected sinister shifts
        

  Barbarian  


  Release Date    September 9, 2022     Director    Zach Cregger     Cast    Bill Skarsgard , Georgina Campbell , Justin Long , Richard Brake , Kurt Braunohler , Matthew Patrick Davis     Rating    R    


When two strangers accidentally book the same Airbnb rental, Barbarian first appears headed for an awkward comedy about the shared accommodations. However, the film rapidly unfolds, taking a sinister turn. Where Barbarian proceeds from its unnerving catalyst hides part of the delight, with trailers obscuring the most provocative developments to come. Preserving the veil around why this house hides disturbing secrets allows each reveal to land with optimal disturbing impact. Barbarian disguises its true nature through misdirection, making the bizarre unfolding of events most satisfying for blindsided audiences.





 3  Pearl (2022) 
Blurred truths and realities
        

  Pearl  


  Release Date    September 16, 2022     Director    Ti West     Cast    Mia Goth , David Corenswet , Tandi Wright , Matthew Sunderland , Emma Jenkins-Purro     Rating    R    


As an origin story for an iconic horror villain, Pearl appears content dwelling in familiar prequel territory, tracing a killer’s early influences. The mid-century farmstead setting and repressed protagonist seemingly foreshadow a straightforward descent into monstrosity. However, this is only a mere backdrop for Pearl’s eccentric backstory, layering each memory and motive with projected distortions. The film’s truth remains murky and suspect, switching up prior assumptions. Maintaining uncertainty allows the fantastical and perverse to override explanations. Pearl rewards those immersed in its surreal perspective, blurring the line between fact and fabrication.





 2  Tusk (2014) 
The obscure twist is alarming once revealed
        

  Tusk  


  Release Date    September 6, 2014     Director    Kevin Smith     Cast    Michael Parks , Justin Long , Genesis Rodriguez , Haley Joel Osment , Johnny Depp     Rating    R    


When a podcaster travels to Canada seeking an eccentric seaman for an interview, Tusk first dangles standard interview suspense before warping into the uncanny. However, their strange dynamic escalates to defy expectations. Without context, Tusk’s first half fosters tension through ambiguity, amping up the unease through unnerving implications alone. This makes the full reveal of the sailor’s plans land with visceral shock. Kevin Smith deliberately obscures Tusk’s central twist in marketing, allowing space for the story’s alarming metamorphosis to cascade over unknowing viewers. Witnessing the podcaster’s predicament deteriorate into absurd horror blindly makes Tusk a great film to see blindly.





 1  From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) 
Not the average Tarantino film
        

  From Dusk Till Dawn  


  Release Date    January 19, 1996     Director    Robert Rodriguez     Cast    Quentin Tarantino , Juliette Lewis , George Clooney , Ernest Liu , Harvey Keitel     Rating    R    


From Dusk Till Dawn sets a deliberate trap, roping moviegoers in with the tease of a pulpy crime thriller by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. Initial scenes echo the gritty, dangerous energy of prior collaborations like Reservoir Dogs. Around the halfway mark, without spoiling specifics, the film takes a jarring turn into horror territory that legend has is most shocking for those ignorant to this genre gear-shift. Preserving the surprise allows it to land with maximum whiplash impact, as assumptions about character and tone shudder and transfigure. Plunging unsuspecting fans into this disorienting tonal vortex makes for From Dusk Till Dawn’s ideal viewing conditions.
