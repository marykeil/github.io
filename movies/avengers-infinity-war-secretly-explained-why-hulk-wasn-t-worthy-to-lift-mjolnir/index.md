# Avengers Infinity War Secretly Explained Why Hulk Wasn t Worthy To Lift Mjolnir


## SUMMARY 


 

Bruce Banner&#39;s failure to lift Mjolnir in Avengers: Age of Ultron proved that he wasn&#39;t worthy during the MCU&#39;s Phase 2.


The Hulk&#39;s betrayal in Avengers: Infinity War suggests his selfishness and resentment may have been holding him back from wielding Mjolnir in Age of Ultron.


Bruce Banner&#39;s transformation into Smart Hulk in Avengers: Endgame, and his use of the Infinity Gauntlet, could have made him worthy enough to wield Mjolnir.
