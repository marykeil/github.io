## Literature Review

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is giving a key franchise character a major promotion, making them the perfect replacement for Harold Ramis&#39; Egon.




Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is giving a fan-favorite character a long overdue promotion, and giving viewers their best Egon replacement. Despite being a beloved franchise, the Ghostbusters movie franchise was absent from screens for nearly 30 years, between Ghostbusters II and Paul Feig&#39;s 2016 reboot. There were many factors behind this gap, including the passing of Egon performer Harold Ramis in 2014. A third film set in the original continuity called Afterlife later arrived in 2021, which in addition to being dedicated to Ramis, also featured Egon being briefly resurrected as a ghost in the finale.




Part of what audiences wanted from a third entry was to see the original cast reunited. Ramis&#39; tragic passing made that impossible, so the sequel had to introduce a new team of heroes, while the film reunited Bill Murray&#39;s Venkman, Ernie Hudson&#39;s Winston and Dan Aykroyd&#39;s Ray in Ghostbusters: Afterlife&#39;s ending. A valid critique of the film was that it leaned too hard on nostalgia, but the upcoming follow-up Frozen Empire promises to introduce fresh villains and concepts. Frozen Empire will also bring back most of the OG cast, including Annie Potts as the Ghostbusters receptionist Janine.

 Janine Suiting Up As A Ghostbuster Is Long Overdue

Recent story reveals for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire confirms Janine will also suit up to bust ghosts. Despite appearing in every film in the series, Potts&#39; role has always been the Ghostbusters&#39; laconic receptionist, so having her finally team up with the rest of the gang is incredibly exciting. According to the actor herself during a conversation with Empire, Janine suits up because the film&#39;s apocalyptic stakes demand &#34;... all hands on deck.&#34; It also came as a shock to Potts herself, as this wasn&#39;t part of Frozen Empire&#39;s original plan.



It came as a real surprise. We were weeks into shooting and Gil [Kenan, director] came up to me and said, ‘We think it’s time… We’re gonna have you suit up. “I have to say I did [get a kick out of it]. Janine has served long and well, and I felt like she was finally getting her stripes, you know?







Janine becoming an official Ghostbusters won&#39;t just be a fan-pleasing moment, it feels way overdue. Whether she strapped on a proton pack or not, Janine&#39;s been a key member of the gang from the very beginning. Having her deliver caustic one-liners to the rest of the &#39;Busters may serve an important comic function, but as the filmmakers behind Frozen Empire realized, it&#39;s about time Janine stepped out from the desk and be given a chance to save the day.



 Janine Was A Ghostbuster In The Animated Spinoffs

Frozen Empire also draws inspiration from beloved cartoon spinoff The Real Ghostbusters, where Janine suited up many times. The first time this happened was in season 1&#39;s &#34;Mr Sandman, Dream Me A Dream,&#34; where the titular ghost renders most of the team unconscious, and it&#39;s left to Janine to dream up a Ghostbuster version of herself to defeat him. Janine geared up as a Ghostbuster again for &#34;Janine&#39;s Genie,&#34; but despite being offered a permanent spot on the team, she decides to remain as the receptionist.






Janine also suited up twice in The Real Ghostbusters spinoff Extreme Ghostbusters.




Regardless, Janine was seen in the Ghostbuster uniform many times over the rest of the show&#39;s run. Unfortunately, this animated offshoot decided to alter Janine&#39;s spiky persona from the first two seasons - which was in keeping with Annie Potts&#39; portrayal in the original film - and soften it, so the character was more maternal to the guys. This was a change suggested by consultants on The Real Ghostbusters, who felt Janine was too &#34;abrasive&#34; and her personality would frighten younger viewers.

The changes to Janine were so drastic, that a Real Ghostbusters season 6 episode titled &#34;Janine, You&#39;ve Changed&#34; eventually revealed they were actually the result of a ghost. While Frozen Empire is finally giving Potts a chance to put on the iconic suit, it should be noted The Real Ghostbusters got there decades earlier.






 What Janine Being A True Ghostbuster Means For Frozen Empire 
The franchise is moving closer to The Real Ghostbusters
         

A weakness of Ghostbusters&#39; various sequels is that they&#39;ve all - in one way or another - remade the 1984 original. They all open with the gang being disbanded in some form, and having to reunite to fight a supernatural foe. Frozen Empire is smartly pulling from Real Ghostbusters&#39; episodic approach, where the group is together and faces new threats each time out. Janine becoming a Ghostbuster pulls directly from The Real Ghostbusters in this way, as does the introduction of a brand new villain.

                  Frozen Empire Is Taking Ghostbusters In A Direction It Should&#39;ve Gone Over 3 Decades Ago   Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is taking the franchise in an exciting new direction, and one it really should have gone in over 30 years before.   

Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is an important test for the franchise&#39;s long-term future too. It&#39;s easily the quickest sequel turnaround in the series and one that will reveal how excited audiences are for a new installment that moves away from recycling the same basic story as the first film.
