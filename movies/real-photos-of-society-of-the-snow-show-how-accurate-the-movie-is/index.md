## Literature Review

Society of the Snow authentically captures many aspects of the actual 1972 Andes plane crash and honors the perspectives of those directly involved.




The incredible realism captured in J.A. Bayona&#39;s hit survival movie Society of the Snow took great inspiration from actual photos and footage taken of the infamous 1972 Andes plane crash site and survivors. After premiering on Netflix on January 4, 2024, Society of the Snow has become one of the most popular titles on Netflix, soaring to the top of the Top 10 movie list. The film is also Spain&#39;s official submission to the 2024 Academy Awards for Best International Feature.




While the remarkable true story of the &#34;Miracle of the Andes&#34; has been captured in numerous documentaries and in the 1993 film Alive starring Ethan Hawke, Society of the Snow adds several new layers of specificity in order to better honor the real-life survivors and the deceased. Bayona cast all relatively unknown Argentine and Uruguayan actors, shot the film in chronological order and in part at the actual plane crash site in the Andes, and used exclusively the native Spanish language to retell the incredible story like never before.

                  What Happened To Every Real-Life Survivor After Society Of The Snow   All 16 survivors of the 1972 Andes plane crash depicted in Society of the Snow went on to have fulfilling lives. Many wrote books and became speakers.

One of the ways that Bayona and cinematographer Pedro Luque were able to tell the story so authentically was to recreate several of the real-life photos that were taken of the 1972 Andes plane crash site and the survivors. So many details were taken into account during the production of Society of the Snow from how the real-life fuselage looked after the crash down to the exact types of clothing that the real-life survivors were wearing at that time. Bayona was also given permission from the families of the deceased to use their real names and likeness.

The authenticity of Society of the Snow was also enhanced by Bayona&#39;s filming approach. Shooting the group of inexperienced South American actors in chronological order was not the most cost-effective way for financial or production reasons, but Bayona was determined to capture the true essence of shared hardship and camaraderie between the actors. Some actors lost a significant amount of weight during the filming process and let their hair and fingernails grow out naturally, sacrificing their overall health and hygiene throughout the filming process.




                  12 Biggest Differences Between Society Of The Snow &amp; Alive&#39;s Portrayals Of The Andes Flight Disaster (30 Years Apart)   While 2023&#39;s Society of the Snow and 1993&#39;s Alive essentially tell the same story, there are several major differences between the two films.   



 Society Of The Snow Movie&#39;s Accuracy Was Helped By The Real Survivors&#39; Input 
         

Bayona spent a great deal of time interviewing the real-life survivors before production began on Society of the Snow. The director gathered hours of interview footage from many of the survivors that would collectively inform every aspect of Society of the Snow, which is why it is considered the definitive portrayal of the actual events. Bayona&#39;s thoughtfulness and attention to detail are on full display with his exceptionally crafted Society of the Snow, which notably has the full support of both the real-life survivors and the families of the deceased.
