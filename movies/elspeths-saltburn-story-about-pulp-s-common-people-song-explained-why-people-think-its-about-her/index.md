 The Lyrics To &#34;Common People&#34; Explained: What Pulp&#39;s Song Is About 
         




Pulp&#39;s iconic 1995 song &#34;Common People&#34; is featured in a major scene in Saltburn, and here&#39;s what the song is actually about. The lyrics of &#34;Common People&#34; tell the story of the singer meeting a female student at Saint Martin&#39;s College, with the two growing close as she talks about the wealth of her family. However, the girl longs to &#34;live like common people,&#34; with her asking the singer to show her how to live like the English lower class. The singer tries to show her what living like common people is truly like, although she will truly never know the struggles of what it is like to be poor.

Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker has described the song as a satire of elites who attempt to &#34;rough it,&#34; with the song being a criticism of the class tourism that is participated in by wealthy elites such as the subject of the song. &#34;Common People&#34; posits that, while the rich may engage in the esthetics of the lower class, they can never truly be common people. This is because, no matter what they do, they always have a free lifeline to get out, with the song explaining that the girl can leave the lower class simply by calling her wealthy father.






 How Elspeth&#39;s Character &amp; Background Connects To &#34;Common People&#34; 
          

In Saltburn, Lady Elspeth hears &#34;Common People&#34; playing at one point, with her explaining that she actually has a connection to the song. According to Elspeth, she used to hang out with various English alt-rock bands back in the days when she was modeling, such as Pulp, Britpop Blur, and Oasis. When &#34;Common People&#34; was released, Elspeth claims that everyone thought that the song was about her, although she says that she barely knew Jarvis Cocker. Elspeth says it couldn&#39;t have been her due to her not being from Greece, as well as her not wanting to know anything, referencing the opening lines of the song.

Elspeth is blissfully unaware of why people would think that &#34;Common People&#34; was written about her, but it actually makes perfect sense to come to this conclusion. Much like the subject of the song, Elspeth comes from an immensely wealthy family, meaning that she has never had to struggle for anything. However, Elspeth (much like her son Felix) has always had a fascination with the lower class, despite her not actually wanting to engage with the downsides of being poor. The girl in the song is also too dumb to notice that the lower-class people are making fun of her, something that Elspeth could easily be seen doing.




                  Saltburn Cast &amp; Character Guide   Since Saltburn&#39;s compelling drama is primarily driven by its well-written character beats, one cannot help but wonder who plays whom in the movie.   



 Elspeth&#39;s Response To The &#34;Common People&#34; Misconception Hilariously Underscores Saltburn&#39;s Themes 
          

Saltburn&#39;s &#34;Common People&#34; story hilariously underscores the film&#39;s themes, with Elspeth&#39;s response to the misconception perfectly revealing more about the Catton family&#39;s character. Although Elspeth is pretending to be a humble common person, her bragging about her Britpop friends as well as her immense wealth shows that she secretly has an ego that she is awful at hiding. Much like the wealthy families of the English upper class that Saltburn is parodying, the ego of the Cattons has led to them not truly understanding what it is like to be a common person.
