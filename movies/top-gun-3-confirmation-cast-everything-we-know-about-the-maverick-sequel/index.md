## Literature Review

Tom Cruise flew high in 2022 in Top Gun: Maverick. With its success, Top Gun 3 feels inevitable, and here&#39;s everything we know about the next Top Gun.




Top Gun 3 was an inevitability after Tom Cruise&#39;s triumphant return in Top Gun: Maverick, and the future of the Top Gun franchise and a third movie is becoming clearer. 36 years after Top Gun became a cultural phenomenon Tom Cruise reprised one of his most iconic roles, Captain Pete &#34;Maverick&#34; Mitchell, in Top Gun: Maverick. Maverick reignited the audience&#39;s passion for Captain Pete Mitchell, and the demand for Top Gun 3 was instant.




Top Gun: Maverick brought Captain Mitchell back to Fightertown, USA, to train a new generation of pilots claiming to be &#34;the best of the best.&#34; With breathtaking aerial photography and steeped in nostalgia for the original Top Gun, Maverick brought Pete Mitchell into the modern era full throttle. Top Gun: Maverick performed swimmingly at the box office, being one of the biggest breakout hits of 2022 and making $1.4 billion worldwide. Despite this, Top Gun 3 wasn&#39;t rushed into production, and it has taken until 2024 to hear any real news. 


 The Latest Top Gun 3 News 
         

After more than a year of speculation, the latest news regarding the legacy sequel finds Top Gun 3 officially confirmed, with Tom Cruise attached to star once again. After striking a major deal with Warner Bros. in January 2024, Cruise is now confirmed to return to the tentpole Paramount project because his new deal isn&#39;t exclusive. However, Cruise&#39;s busy schedule might put the confirmed Top Gun 3 on the back burner for quite some time. 




Along with the announcement that the movie was happening, it was also confirmed that Miles Teller would return as Hangman and Glen Powell would play Rooster once again as well. Ehren Kruger, the co-writer of Top Gun: Maverick, has been tapped to pen the script, while director Joseph Kosinski is rumored to once again helm the project. 



 Top Gun 3 Is Confirmed 
          

While speculation about the sequel has been high since the film was such a box-office juggernaut, Top Gun 3 wasn&#39;t officially confirmed until January 2024. However, the confirmation was also accompanied by news of Tom Cruise&#39;s return as Pete Mitchell, further proof that the sequel would be on the way soon. 



 Top Gun 3 Cast: Who Will Return? 
          




While most of the cast of Top Gun 3 is still under wraps, early news suggests that the ensemble of Maverick may return en masse. When the sequel was announced in January 2024, it was revealed that Tom Cruise would reprise his role as Pete &#34;Maverick&#34; Mitchell, quelling rumors that he wouldn&#39;t be involved with the third film. Additionally, it was revealed that Cruise would be joined by his Maverick co-stars Miles Teller as &#34;Hangman&#34; and Glen Powell as &#34;Rooster&#34;. 

The rest of the returning cast might include: 

 Actor  Top Gun: Maverick Role   Jennifer Connelly  Penelope &#34;Penny&#34; Benjamin   Jon Hamm  Beau &#34;Cyclone&#34; Simpson   Ed Harris  Chester &#34;Hammer&#34; Cain   Val Kilmer  Tom &#34;Iceman&#34; Kazansky   Lewis Pullman  Robert &#34;Bob&#34; Floyd   Charles Parnell  Solomon &#34;Warlock&#34; Bates   Bashir Salahuddin  Bernie &#34;Hondo&#34; Coleman   Monica Barbaro  Natasha &#34;Phoenix&#34; Trace   Jay Ellis  Reuben &#34;Payback&#34; Fitch   Danny Ramirez  Mickey &#34;Fanboy&#34; Garcia   Greg Tarzan Davis  Javy &#34;Coyote&#34; Machado   Manny Jacinto  Billy &#34;Fritz&#34; Avalone   Raymond Lee  Logan &#34;Yale&#34; Lee   Jake Picking  Brigham &#34;Harvard&#34; Lennox   Jack Shumacker  Neil &#34;Omaha&#34; Vikander   Kara Wang  Callie &#34;Halo&#34; Bassett   








 Top Gun 3 Story: What Maverick Sets Up 
          

The ending of Maverick didn&#39;t explicitly set up a third movie, but it also didn&#39;t need to for a sequel to work. The Top Gun 3 story will inevitably feature a new mission that requires Maverick and the other pilots, and the specific details will be secondary to what it means for the development of their characters. However, Maverick did plant a seed for a potential new story because Admiral Cain planned to replace human pilots with a drone armada. Perhaps Top Gun 3 would pit Maverick and other human pilots against Cain&#39;s drones to prove that man is superior to a machine.


 




What would make this story even better is a Top Gun reunion. As previously mentioned, most of the crew didn&#39;t come back for Top Gun 2, so a battle against the machines sets up the perfect reunion story for Top Gun 3. Top Gun 3 could see the original fighter pilot team reuniting to prove that men fly better than machines, and it would be a satisfying tribute to the original movie. Needless to say, the storyline that sees replacing human pilots with drones will probably be a part of Top Gun 3&#39;s setup, but it&#39;ll be interesting to see in what capacity.
