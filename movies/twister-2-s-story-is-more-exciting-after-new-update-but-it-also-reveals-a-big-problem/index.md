## Literature Review

A recent Twisters update may seem like a good thing for the upcoming sequel, however this news also raises a big issue for the natural disaster film.




Since it was first revealed that Twisters, a Twister sequel, was in the works, there have been many questions about what this sequel will be about and who it will include, and a recent update finally gives some answers, while also raising a totally new issue. Twister is a 1996 natural disaster film that follows a group of storm chasers following a tornado, but in particular, a couple that is on the verge of divorce. Twister 2, also called Twisters, was first confirmed in 2022 and has recently finished filming. Twisters new cast includes Glen Powell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Anthony Ramos.




During an interview with Vogue, Glen Powell recently revealed some pertinent information about his new project, Twisters. He explained that Twisters is a completely standalone story. This means that, though it is a sequel to the original Twister, it does not include any of the original characters. In particular, Powell said, &#34;It’s definitely not a reboot. We’re not trying to recreate the story from the first one. It’s a completely original story. There are no characters from the original movie back, so it’s not really a continuation. It’s just its own standalone story in the modern-day.&#34;

                  The Follow-Up To This $495.7 Million Box Office Hit Is 2024&#39;s Weirdest Sequel Movie   2024’s movie release calendar has plenty of big sequel highlights, but one follow-up to a 1996 box office hit will undoubtedly be the strangest.   


 Twisters Is Better Off Without Major Connections To The Original Movie 
          




Ultimately, Glen Powell&#39;s comment about Twisters is an exciting update. It is not often that a movie is turned into a franchise and the sequel is essentially completely unconnected to its preceding movie. Typically, especially these days, film franchises try hard to build up lore and history for audiences to get attached to. But, it is exciting that Twisters is not following this trend. In many ways, it will honor the essence of Twister, which is spontaneous and individual. Plus, this unique move may gain the film more traction.

It is good for Twisters to stay separate from 1996&#39;s Twister because the franchise&#39;s stories don&#39;t need to connect. Twister is about an isolated incident, a natural disaster that one group of people experience face to face. In many ways, it would be cheesy to try and bring back these characters and throw them into another similar disaster. Instead, it makes sense to try and tell a similar story with a new cast. Therefore, audiences get to experience the same thrills of Twister&#39;s original natural disaster but with entirely new characters who will shake up the narrative.






 Standalone Or Not, Will Enough People Care About Twisters? 
          

However, Twisters&#39; individuality does raise one significant problem. Without strong ties to its original movie, Twisters might not be able to interest audiences enough. In general, Twister is not a blockbuster. If anything, it is a cult classic, and the type of movie that many watched but later forgot about. In this way, making a franchise out of it is already risky. However, now that Twisters is not bringing back any of the old characters, there might not be enough of a connection to bring in Twister-lovers. Therefore, Twisters will have to rely on itself alone to bring in audiences.
