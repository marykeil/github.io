## Literature Review

Horror masters Jason Blum and James Wan are joining forces in an exciting new way, officially merging their companies Blumhouse and Atomic Monster.




Jason Blum’s Blumhouse and James Wan’s Atomic Monster have officially closed a merger deal. In the last decade or so, Blumhouse Productions and Atomic Monster have produced some of the biggest and best horror movies that have graced both theaters and streamers. Blumhouse is responsible for producing horror classics like Paranormal Activity and Jordan Peele’s Get Out, while Atomic Monster has worked on Annabelle, The Conjuring 2, and Corin Hardy’s The Nun. The news of a merger between the companies first emerged in late 2022.




Now, the deal is official. Blum, the founder and CEO of Blumhouse Productions, recently took to X to confirm the news of the merger:


 

Blum posted a one-minute clip that fused scenes from both companies’ past productions with a caption that read, “Our deal is …. Done. Blumhouse and Atomic Monster have officially joined forces. The preeminent homes for horror are now under one roof.”


 What Does the Merger Mean for Blumhouse and Atomic Monster? 
          

Reports about the merger first surfaced shortly before the two production companies collaborated on M3GAN, which had its theatrical release in early 2023. M3GAN received mostly positive reviews from critics and grossed $181 million worldwide against a budget of $12 million. Following M3GAN, the two production companies joined forces again to work on Insidious: The Red Door, which also saw relative success in theaters.




The official merger of both companies now provides a proper avenue to build on the success of their previous collaborations. Already, the two companies have a new horror movie titled Night Swim lined up for release in the first weekend of January. As previously reported, the merger is also expected to allow the companies to increase output and potentially expand content in a variety of spaces, including video games, podcasts, and live events.

                  Blumhouse&#39;s New Horror Movie Looks Eerily Similar To A 28-Year-Old Episode From A Kids&#39; TV Show   The newest horror movie from Blumhouse and producer James Wan bears quite a few resemblances to a decades-old episode from a beloved kids&#39; show.   

While Blumhouse and Atomic Monster’s merger indicates that both companies will work side by side, sharing their resources and infrastructure, the two will still maintain their brand identities. This means the merger will not affect the production of the companies’ individual forthcoming projects, and viewers can still expect movies like Blumhouse’s The Exorcist: Deceiver and Atomic Monster’s Mortal Kombat 2 to arrive as planned.
