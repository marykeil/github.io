## Literature Review

The Best Supporting Actress race for the Oscars 2024 is wide open, leaving a strong group of contenders hoping for nominations and the eventual win.




The Oscars 2024 race for Best Supporting Actress has a long list of potential nominees, but only one of the nominated actresses can win. Even though the campaigning process for the Oscars is still early on, a major shakeup to the race unexpectedly arrived early. This came through the confirmation that Apple is campaigning Lily Gladstone for a Best Actress Oscar nomination in 2024. She was presumed to be the frontrunner for the award in the supporting category. Her absence opens up a spot for another woman to be nominated and follow up Jamie Lee Curtis&#39; win in 2023 for Everything Everywhere All At Once.
The overall 2024 Oscar nominations will not be announced until January 2024 after the voting body has a chance to select the five supporting actress performances they deem most worthy of the award. Thanks to mounting awards campaigns and some contenders having connections to potential Oscars 2024 Best Picture nominees, the outlook of who will get in and who will be snubbed will change. The following predictions will be updated periodically leading up to the official Oscars nomination announcement date. But, here are Screen Rant&#39;s predicted Best Supporting Actress nominees:
    Actress   Movie    1   Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph   The Holdovers    2   Emily Blunt   Oppenheimer    3   Penélope Cruz   Ferrari    4   Julianne Moore   May December    5   Taraji P. Henson   The Color Purple    
The five actresses listed above are far from guaranteed to receive nominations in January 2024, as there are several other notable performances that could make waves in the coming weeks and months. The list includes several actresses who have experience with the Academy Awards and winning for their memorable roles, as well as some potential new breakthroughs. Some additional names and performances to keep in mind when it comes to the Oscars 2024 nominations include:
  Actress   Movie    Danielle Brooks   The Color Purple    Jodie Foster   Nyad    Rosamund Pike   Saltburn    Cara Jade Myers   Killers of the Flower Moon    Sandra Hüller   The Zone of Interest    America Ferrera   Barbie    Vanessa Kirby   Napoleon    Viola Davis   Air    Rachel McAdams   Are You There God? It&#39;s Me, Margaret    Juliette Binoche   The Taste of Things    









 








 5  Taraji P. Henson In The Color Purple 
She was last nominated in 2009
        

After missing out on an Oscar nomination in 2017 with Hidden Figures, Taraji P. Henson looks to be a serious contender for Best Supporting Actress in 2024 thanks to The Color Purple. The musical reimagining of the book, previously adapted by Steven Spielberg, is filled with bold performances from a talented cast. This potentially pits Taraji P. Henson and co-star Danielle Brooks against each other for one of the five possible nominations. With only early reactions to go off of at this stage, it could be Taraji P. Henson&#39;s Oscars history that gives her the edge among The Color Purple&#39;s cast members.
Her role as the adult Shug Avery in The Color Purple comes over a decade after Henson&#39;s lone Oscar nomination. She was previously recognized for her role in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button back in 2009. While the Academy regularly recognizes new people in every category, it is also common for previous nominees to get an edge at times. It&#39;s quite possible that the Academy voters decide its time to recognize Taraji P. Henson&#39;s great work once more, but whether she wins it all remains to be seen. With Danielle Brooks earning the Golden Globe nomination, its possible The Color Purple will bring a different nominee.





 4  Julianne Moore In May December 
She&#39;s a former Oscar winner
        

Julianne Moore could find herself in the middle of the Oscars season once again thanks to her role in May December. Todd Haynes&#39; new movie has positioned all three of its leads in contending territory. Helping Moore&#39;s case is Todd Haynes&#39; history, as there are two examples of his movies earning Best Supporting Actress nominations: Cate Blanchett in I&#39;m Not There and Rooney Mara in Carol. She&#39;s also started to pick up some recognition for the role elsewhere, thanks to a Golden Globes nomination.
While none of Haynes&#39; previous actress Oscars nominations have resulted in a victory, Julianne Moore already has that experience attached to her career. Her last Oscar nomination came in 2015 for her leading role in Still Alice, and this is where she finally won an Academy Award after four previous nominations. After previously earning Best Supporting Actress nominations for Boogie Nights in 1998 and The Hours in 2003, perhaps the third time is the charm with May December. If so, Julianne Moore would be the eighth actress in history to win both a Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress Oscar.





 3  Penélope Cruz In Ferrari 
She&#39;s a former winner in Best Supporting Actress
        

Penélope Cruz could once again find herself in the Oscars race in 2024 thanks to her role in Michael Mann&#39;s Ferrari. She plays Laura Ferrari, the wife of Adam Driver&#39;s Enzo Ferrari. The role is a heartbreaking one for the actress to tackle, offering her a chance to become the emotional backbone of the movie at times. Now that Ferrari has been released in theaters, the praise and appreciation for Cruz&#39;s performance has grown. She&#39;s racked up various nominations from critics groups, even though she missed out on a Golden Globe nomination.
If Penélope Cruz is among the 2024 Oscars Best Supporting Actress nominees, it will be her fifth Oscar nomination overall throughout her career. She&#39;s been nominated twice for Best Actress and twice for Best Supporting Actress previously. While 2022 brought her most recent nomination with Parallel Mothers, it was back in 2009 that she won a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her performance in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. The overall pedigree of her career could increase the likelihood of receiving another nomination in 2024.





 2  Emily Blunt In Oppenheimer 
This would be Blunt&#39;s first nomination
        

Emily Blunt is arguably one of the strongest contenders for the Best Supporting Actress 2024 Oscar. Her role as J. Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s wife Kitty puts her in a pivotal role both in terms of the film&#39;s emotional throughline and when it comes to the grand finale. Considering Cillian Murphy is viewed as the predicted Best Actor winner at the 2024 Oscars and Oppenheimer is a leading contender for Best Picture, Emily Blunt&#39;s already celebrated performance is likely to be reassessed and praised further as awards season heats up.
Despite the longevity of Emily Blunt&#39;s movie career, this would be the first Oscar nomination that she&#39;s ever received. Her work in movies like The Devil Wears Prada, Mary Poppins Returns, Sicario, and The Young Victoria received strong reviews, but none of them ultimately landed her a place at the Academy Awards. This would also be the first time an actress has been nominated for an Oscar thanks to her work in a Christopher Nolan movie. Blunt&#39;s Golden Globe nomination is another point in her favor leading to the eventual Oscar nomination.





 1  Da’Vine Joy Randolph In The Holdovers (Winner) 
She&#39;s the predicted winner


 







Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph has a strong chance to earn her first Oscar nomination, and win, in 2024. The actress has the lead female role in Alexander Payne&#39;s The Holdovers as Mary Lamb, a cafeteria manager at the school. The emotional role filled with grief and loss allows Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph to have one of the most memorable performances in the movie. Following her breakout role in Dolemite Is My Name a few years ago, she&#39;s continued to grow as an actress and delivers her best work to date. As a result, winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar is in the cards.
While Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph does not have the prior awards pedigree of some of the other contenders, she is a Tony Award nominee for her work in Ghosts: The Musical. Her win at the 2024 Oscars would put her in rare air in terms of winning an Oscar on the first nomination. It last happened in this category in 2022 with Ariana DeBose&#39;s win for West Side Story. She&#39;s received nominations from a plethora of critics circles and the Golden Globes, and her candidacy to win looks even more likely after Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, New York Film Critics Circle Awards, and National Board of Review wins.
