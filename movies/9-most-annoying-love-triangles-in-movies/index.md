## SUMMARY 


 Love triangles can explore the complexities of relationships and characters&#39; imperfections, but they can also distract from the plot&#39;s thematic issues and make the characters look petty and immature. 
 The love triangle in 
The Hunger Games
 detracts from the deeper themes of the series and the complex ideas about a tyrannical government controlling a population. 
 In 
Frozen
, the love triangle between Anna, Kristoff, and Hans is unnecessary. The film could have focused on Anna realizing that she rushed into an engagement and needed time to develop a real relationship.

## Literature Review



Love triangles are a tricky business. Good love triangles can be a way to explore the complexities of romantic relationships and characters&#39; imperfections. Romantic possibilities may represent something greater than the people involved, such as whatever life a character would have if they chose one partner over the other. Alternatively, the central character may not only be torn between two romances, but also how each of the other two characters believes they should approach the movie&#39;s main conflict.
But too often, love triangles are just annoying. They distract from the plot&#39;s greater thematic issues and make the characters involved look petty and immature. Sometimes the audience can&#39;t even understand why the main character would want to be with either option.









 








 9  Jane, Tess, &amp; George 
27 Dresses (2008)
        

Katherine Heigl stars as Jane, a woman who has been a bridesmaid 27 times, but never does anything for herself. Yet she is unable to remain silent when her flighty sister Tess swoops in and steals Jane&#39;s boss and crush George. Ultimately, George is a plot device leading to the sisters addressing their own shortcomings and working on their relationship. However, after Jane destroys his and Tess&#39; engagement, George still asks Jane out. Is the movie suggesting that Jane dating her sister&#39;s ex-fiancé when she personally destroys the engagement is an option? Of course, it is not—Jane finds her happy ending with James Marsden&#39;s Kevin.





 8  Katniss, Peeta, &amp; Gale 
The Hunger Games (2012)


Close







is built upon complex ideas about how a tyrannical government controls a population, demonstrated by how the Capitol controls Panem&#39;s districts. Yet for years, the fandom constantly argued over which of two attractive young men the heroine should end up with. Katniss herself is consumed by figuring out how she and her loved ones will survive and can hardly spend time thinking through the romantic subplot. She wants to protect both Peeta and Gale from harm because they are both important figures in her life. However, the love triangle is a distraction from the deeper themes of the series.

 7  Anna, Kristoff, &amp; Hans 
Frozen (2013)


Close







It is clear from the beginning of Frozen that Hans has to go. The movie explicitly mocks Anna for her quick engagement to the prince of the Southern Isles, as a meta-critique of past Disney Princess movies. Anna then develops a more nuanced relationship with Kristoff and Hans becomes superfluous. Rather than Hans turning out to be the villain, it would have been interesting to see Anna forced to admit she rushed in too fast and that she needs time to have a real relationship with someone before getting married.





 6  Rafe, Danny, &amp; Evelyn 
Pearl Harbor (2001)
        

Pearl Harbor&#39;s 24% on Rotten Tomatoes is a condemnation of its attempt to capture one of the most significant events in recent American history. On top of the war movie&#39;s inaccuracies, the plot centers around two childhood friends whose relationship is tested when they fall in love with the same woman. The romance is unnecessary, and the movie demonstrates its shoddy writing by ending with the worst love triangle cop-out: killing off one of the characters. Evelyn is pregnant with Danny&#39;s child when he is killed; she and Rafe get married and raise the baby together.





 5  Rachel, Dex, &amp; Darcy 
Something Borrowed (2011)
        

It is hard to root for love in a rom-com where everyone cheats on their significant other. Shy Rachel is in love with her old friend from law school Dex, but never expresses her feelings. As a result, Dex becomes engaged to Rachel&#39;s best friend Darcy. The movie only works because it frames Darcy as a selfish, antagonistic character. Rachel says she is sorry she hurt Darcy, but she is not sorry she slept with Dex. Ultimately, Rachel always needed to end her friendship with Darcy in order to be happy.





 4  Jackson, Kate, &amp; Gordon 
2012 (2009)
        

Even at the end of the world, there will be a love triangle. Divorced father Jackson is implied to still have feelings for his ex-wife Kate, while their children live with Kate and her boyfriend Gordon. As the main characters try to secure a place on one of the &#34;arks,&#34; Gordon is killed in a particularly brutal way by being crushed by the ship&#39;s gears. 2012 ends with Jackson and Kate reuniting which, if their previous divorce has any indication, probably won&#39;t work out. They only manage to pull in another person who has to die so they can be together.

 3  Legolas, Kili, &amp; Tauriel 
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013)


Close







A romantic subplot is just one of the additions made to stretch out a relatively short children&#39;s novel into three feature-length movies. The love triangle between Legolas, Kili, and Tauriel shamelessly bogs down the plot of the second and third Hobbit movies. Additionally, Kili and Tauriel are nowhere near as beloved by the Lord of the Rings fandom as Legolas. Yet their romance is favored over staying true to Legolas&#39; characterization in the original Trilogy. Legolas is relatively positive in previous installments, while he is just angry that Tauriel is not in love with him in Desolation of Smaug.





 2  Gatsby, Daisy, &amp; Tom 
The Great Gatsby (2013)
        

Narrator Nick Carraway famously tells the title character Jay Gatsby, &#34;They&#39;re a rotten crowd. You&#39;re worth the whole damn bunch put together.&#34; Gatsby may be the hero, but he is naive in his quest to win the married Daisy Buchanan. Daisy and her husband Tom are both shallow characters, and it is clear that Daisy does not want to leave the comfort of her marriage for the disaster of a scandal. Gatsby is in denial; this is especially apparent when he meets the couple&#39;s young daughter and seems shocked by the confirmation of Daisy&#39;s connection to Tom.

Bella picked Edward over Jacob in the Twilight Saga. While it may have been the right call, she might&#39;ve been better off in a relationship with both.









 1  Bella, Edward, &amp; Jacob 
Twilight: Eclipse (2010)
        

The Twilight Saga notoriously features the most well-known love triangles in pop culture. Edward and Jacob are both controlling of Bella to an unhealthy degree but Bella refuses to extract herself from either relationship. Additionally, this love triangle features one of the biggest faults of the trope: Based on the way the series is framed, Bella was always going to end up with Edward, and the massive Team Edward vs. Team Jacob debate was a huge waste of time.
