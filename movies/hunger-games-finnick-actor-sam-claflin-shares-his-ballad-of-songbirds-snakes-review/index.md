## Literature Review

The Hunger Games star Sam Claflin, who portrayed Finnick, shares his review for the latest prequel movie, The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes.




The Hunger Games star Sam Claflin, who portrayed Finnick in the original series, has offered a review for the series&#39; latest installment, The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes. The new movie takes place decades before Katniss Everdeen is born, focusing on a young Coriolanus Snow and his rise to power in Panem. This includes a focus on his time as a mentor within the Games, and his tragic relationship with District 12 tribute Lucy Gray.




Speaking with MTV at the Golden Globes, Claflin offered up a positive review of Songbirds &amp; Snakes.


 

The actor praised Rachel Zegler for her role as Lucy Gray, as well as Tom Blyth for his portrayal of Snow and Francis Lawrence for his directing. Check out what Claflin had to say below:


Rachel Zegler is absolutely killing it as a fellow Hunger Games person.... I have [seen The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes], and you know, suitably impressed. I mean, Francis Lawrence is like one of my favorite directors and one wonderful human being. And Tom Blyth, equally stunning, stunning performance.



 How The Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes Bolsters The Hunger Games Franchise 
          




Claflin&#39;s review of The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes emphasizes its placement as a strong entry within the franchise. Blyth and Zegler lead a story that offers a sympathetic look at Snow&#39;s transformation into a tyrant, a much different take than Katniss&#39; freedom fighting. Because of how unique a premise the story has compared to the main series, it stands out from the rest of the films.

The exploration of how Snow changes throughout Songbirds &amp; Snakes emphasizes the way it leads into the rest of the franchise, including Finnick&#39;s future Hunger Games participation. Without the number of alterations Panem&#39;s President made to how the Games are broadcast, they wouldn&#39;t become the disturbing phenomenon of the main franchise. Offering context to these changes gives a deeper backstory to the franchise&#39;s setting.

                  10 Disturbing Lines From The Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes Book That Prove Snow Was A Monster All Along   Without Coriolanus Snow&#39;s inner dialogue in the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie, he didn&#39;t seem so badâ€”but several book lines prove otherwise.    




The praise Claflin and others have offered the film could also encourage future movies beyond The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes. This could include exploring other character&#39;s backstories - possibly Finnick - in greater detail than were established in the original films. However, any future endeavors for the franchise would have to be penned by author Suzanne Collins, who could no doubt produce another story worthy of praise.



The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes is available to purchase digitally.
