## Literature Review

A Spawn reboot movie is coming from Todd McFarlane and Blumhouse with Jamie Foxx playing the titular hellish antihero - here&#39;s everything we know.




Decades after first being teased by creator Todd McFarlane the Spawn reboot is on the way from Blumhouse, and after so many years in development, there’s much to discuss around Jamie Foxx’s debut as Spawn. Launched by Image Comics in 1992’s Spawn #1, Todd McFarlane’s Spawn is one of the most recognizable comic book characters not owned by Marvel or DC. Spawn has already had several adaptations, including a critically acclaimed animated TV series and a less-than-critically-acclaimed live-action movie the same year.




While the Spawn movie starring Michael Jai White as Al Simmons/Spawn wasn’t the commercial success studio New Line Cinema had hoped, it managed to gain a cult following over the years. Interest in the franchise has held, and Todd McFarlane is now teaming up with Blumhouse for the Spawn reboot. Jamie Foxx is taking over the role of Spawn, and there’s already been a great deal of development on what may be one of the longest-gestating comic book movies in history.


 Most Recent Spawn Reboot News 
         

Unlike other long-gestating Hollywood projects, news has been steady involving the reboot, and Todd McFarlane has provided a developmental update on Spawn. The comic book icon explained that the Spawn reboot is at a &#34;make or break&#34; point when it comes to funding, and if Hollywood doesn&#39;t bite soon, they will be forced to look elsewhere for an investor. 




Hoping to stay within the typical structure of the Hollywood filmmaking machine, McFarlane expressed confidence in his producer, saying &#34;Obviously, Jason Blum is one of the better ones at getting things done&#34;. McFarlane also talked about seeing the script for the first time, suggesting that behind-the-scenes creative development is chugging along after the WGA strike put the movie on hold for a lot of 2023.



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023. 






 Blumhouse’s Spawn Reboot Is Confirmed 
          

The Spawn movie reboot was first announced by Todd McFarlane in 1998, but it wasn’t until 2017 when Blumhouse became involved, that the project gained momentum. However, it would be another three years, in 2020, before Blumhouse confirmed that active development on the Spawn reboot had started.






 The Spawn Reboot Production Status 
          

The Spawn reboot movie release date is set for 2025. While there isn’t a more specific window yet, in September 2023 producer Jason Blum reaffirmed that, despite delays, the new Spawn movie starring Jamie Foxx would be arriving as planned. &#34;2025 is when Spawn is going to come out. I stand by that.&#34; Blum restated to Comicbook.com in September 2023. The Spawn reboot was also delayed by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes and Jamie Foxx’s personal health issues.



 The Jamie Foxx Spawn Reboot Cast 
          

The upcoming Blumhouse Spawn reboot is being led by Jamie Foxx. Foxx, known for multiple hits like Django Unchained and Ray, and more recently Strays and Day Shift. He is playing Al Simmons who eventually becomes the titular anti-hero Spawn. There have yet to be any further casting announcements, such as who will play Violator in the reboot, though Todd McFarlane had teased the new Spawn movie would feature more A-Listers alongside Jamie Foxx.






 Todd McFarlane’s Spawn Reboot Story 
          

There haven’t been many specifics revealed about the story of the Spawn reboot, besides that it will be R-rated. It’s expected that it will follow the origin story of Spawn from the original Todd McFarlane comics. Al Simmons is a marine who is violently murdered by those he once trusted. Instead of dying, Simmons is revived as a Hellspawn — a being with superhuman abilities sent from the underworld to punish those destined to end up in Hell. Simmons, going by the moniker of Spawn, soon branches off on his own and decides to become a force for good rather than an instrument of vengeance.

This is the basic premise of the story the Spawn reboot will likely tell, but there’s much more nuance and depth to the character. Spawn gained attention because he epitomized the idea of the brooding 90s antihero, and his comics were a far cry from any Marvel or DC property at the time. While the 1997 movie wasn’t the blockbuster success McFarlane had hoped, the upcoming Spawn reboot from Blumhouse could finally bring the demonic hero live-action success.
