# “I Didnt Really Have A Character” Saving Private Ryan Star Recalls Controlled Chaos On Set


## SUMMARY 



Paul Giamatti recalls that Saving Private Ryan was very loosely structured on set, with camera operators bumping into each other and actors falling over in the mud.

Giamatti&#39;s character, Hill, was also mostly created on the fly, with director Steven Spielberg finding new details as filming progressed.

This unstructured, documentary-like feel is part of why Saving Private Ryan remains one of the best and most harrowing war movies ever, with viewers truly immersed in the experience.

## Literature Review

Paul Giamatti recalls what it was like to film Saving Private Ryan, explaining the unstructured atmosphere that Steven Spielberg created on set.



[***Saving Private Ryan***](https://screenrant.com/tag/saving-private-ryan/) actor Paul Giamatti reflects on the war film&#39;s unique atmosphere on set, which was deliberately very unstructured. Released in 1998, the Steven Spielberg film is widely regarded as one of the best war films ever made, chronicling the journey of Tom Hanks&#39; Captain Miller as he and a detachment of soldiers trek across France during World War II to recover the last surviving son of the Ryan family. Giamatti appears relatively briefly as part of [*Saving Private Ryan*&#39;s cast](https://screenrant.com/saving-private-ryan-cast-cameo-actors-guide/) as Sergeant Hill, who encounters Miller and his men during the film&#39;s Neuville sequence.

In a recent interview with [*GQ*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzsjMwYJNgI&amp;ab_channel=GQ), Giamatti recalls what it was like [filming *Saving Private Ryan*](https://screenrant.com/saving-private-ryan-filming-locations-explained/), revealing that the movie&#39;s set was dominated by a sense of controlled chaos.

The actor explains that Spielberg was going for a documentary-like feel for the film, which meant a general lack of structure compared to a more traditional film set. Check out Giamatti&#39;s full recollection of his *Saving Private Ryan* filming experience below:



*“I’ve done other war things, but that was innovate what [Steven Spielberg] was doing in that movie. I don’t know how many Steadicam operators there were at one time operating. It was not terribly structured, necessarily. It was very loosely blocked so that these guys were running around catching whatever they can almost like documentary filmmakers. And so they were all falling over and banging into each other. He didn’t want it coordinated. It was a living scene. You weren’t cutting all the time and stopping and resetting.*

*“I think I just fell because it was incredibly slippery and muddy. Everybody was falling all the time. I think from that, Spielberg starting developing this idea that the guy, his leg was messed up and he had a thing in his shoe, and he started just making that up. He would come over and give us a scenario and some lines. I didn’t really have… there was no part, really. It was very, very sketched in. I didn’t really have a character.”*



## Why Saving Private Ryan&#39;s Documentary Feel Was So Effective

Few films have managed to capture the horrors of war as effectively as *Saving Private Ryan*, and a big reason for this is how the movie is filmed. The camera is almost always in motion, tracking after characters in battle and truly immersing viewers in the experience as blood, sand, and mud fleck onto the lens. This is perhaps most effective during [*Saving Private Ryan*&#39;s D-Day sequence](https://screenrant.com/saving-private-ryan-d-day-not-opening-scene/) near the beginning, in which Allied forces storm Omaha Beach.

Saving Private Ryan&#39;s Omaha beach sequence cost about $12 million (of the film&#39;s total budget of $70 million) and took around four weeks to film.

Instead of feeling like watching a film, then, *Saving Private Ryan*&#39;s documentary style engulfs viewers in the experience, putting them alongside Captain Miller and the horrific violence that surrounds him. This extreme sense of immersion famously resulted in the triggering of PTSD in some veterans who watched the film, with the issue proving widespread enough to spur the creation of a dedicated Veterans Affairs hotline for those affected by it.

While it&#39;s easy to imagine *Saving Private Ryan*&#39;s unstructured atmosphere causing problems in the hands of a less capable director, the main cast all participated in real military boot camp training prior to filming, which undoubtedly came in handy during the moments of chaos. Ultimately, Spielberg&#39;s decision to give the film a documentary-like feel is one of the reasons why ***Saving Private Ryan*** remains one of the best and most affecting war movies ever made.
