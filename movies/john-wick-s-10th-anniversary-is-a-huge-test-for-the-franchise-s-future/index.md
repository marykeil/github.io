## Literature Review

The John Wick franchise is at an interesting point in its development, and with the 10th anniversary here, the films will really be put to the test.




On October 24, 2014, the very first John Wick movie premiered, and now in 2024, the franchise will see its tenth anniversary coincide with another major development that will truly test the action films. John Wick is an action franchise that follows the titular character John Wick, an assassin who is pulled out of retirement after the murder of his wife and dog. Since its debut in 2014, John Wick has had four movies, the most recent being 2023&#39;s John Wick: Chapter 4. Now, in 2024, the franchise will be releasing its first ever spinoff film, notably without its iconic lead actor.




Over the years, John Wick has held consistent popularity among audiences. From the first movie to the fourth, people have praised John Wick for its seamless action sequences, its long-shot editing, and its dedication to building up lore and mythology within the franchise. However, John Wick has earned a great deal of its success from its lead actor, Keanu Reeves, as well. Though the actor has impressed audiences in comedies and dramas, his return to the action genre was impressive. His athleticism and stoic personality make him the perfect man to lead this sleek action franchise.


 John Wick&#39;s First Spinoff Movie Comes Out Before The Franchise&#39;s 10th Anniversary 
          

Despite John Wick&#39;s consistent past successes, the franchise is changing in 2024. First, John Wick will be celebrating its tenth anniversary in October 2024. But, even before that, the John Wick franchise will release its first ever spinoff film, Ballerina - without Keanu Reeves as the lead. In June 2024, Ballerina will make its debut as the first ever John Wick movie that is not part of the main series. The film stars Ana de Armas as Rooney, a ballerina assassin who hunts her family&#39;s murderers. Notably, this film is set in the time between John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and John Wick: Chapter 4. 




In this way, 2024 is a major year for the John Wick franchise. In the past decade, the series has been able to maintain its momentum and keep creating films that build on each other. But now, the franchise is developing in new ways that are pretty inevitable. For one, spinoff movies are incredibly common now when it comes to big franchises, and could boost the franchise&#39;s popularity. But more importantly, Keanu Reeves cannot play John Wick forever. Due to how physically demanding the films are, his tenure as the assassin was going to have to come to an end eventually.



 Ballerina Will Show If The John Wick Franchise Can Survive Without Keanu Reeves 
          

What is most important about Ballerina&#39;s premiere is that it will indicate whether John Wick can survive without Keanu Reeves. Although Reeves will be making a cameo in Ballerina, this is the first step in his stepping away from the franchise. Though John Wick 5 could happen, Reeves has said that it would take a very good idea to bring him back into the franchise, especially after Wick&#39;s death at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4. All in all, Ballerina is a film that will test the waters in a way. If it is successful, the John Wick franchise will be able to continue, perhaps differently, but continue nonetheless.
