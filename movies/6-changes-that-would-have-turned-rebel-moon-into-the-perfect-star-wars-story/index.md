# 6 Changes That Would Have Turned Rebel Moon Into The Perfect Star Wars Story


## SUMMARY 


 With some key changes, Rebel Moon&#39;s story could have fit within the early Old Republic era of Star Wars, providing Zack Snyder with more creative freedom had Lucasfilm greenlit his pitch in 2012. 
 Kora&#39;s character resembles a Revan-type character from Knights of the Old Republic, with both seeking redemption after returning to the light. 
 The oppressive Imperium could have been the Sith Empire, and Regent Balisarius as its Sith Emperor, with both having similar dynamics.

## Literature Review

Originally pitched to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars movie, here are 6 changes that would make Rebel Moon perfect for the galaxy far, far away.




Due to its shared DNA with the Star Wars franchise, some key changes could turn Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire
into a perfect movie for the galaxy far, far away. Originally envisioned by writer and director Zack Snyder as a Star Wars movie which he subsequently pitched to Lucasfilm back in 2012, it&#39;s not hard to see the similarities between Star Wars and RebelMoon. To that end, there are a few exciting ways in which the movie could easily fit within the greater Star Wars canon (given some tweaks).
Starring a young woman named Kora (Sofia Boutella) who&#39;s seeking allies to help her resist the threat of an oppressive galactic regime, it&#39;s obvious why Zack Snyder believed his story could fit within the bigger Star Wars timeline and franchise. However, Lucasfilm&#39;s rejection of the pitch resulted in Sndyer creating his own IP and galaxy instead, complete with its own unique lore and characters. That said, it still feels incredibly similar to Star Wars (which is by design). Keeping that in mind, here are six notable changes that could theoretically turn Rebel Moon into a Star Wars movie had Lucasfilm approved Snyder&#39;s idea.
            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.












 








 7  The Imperium Could Have Been The Early Sith Empire 
An Earlier Star Wars Era Would Have Been Perfect For Snyder


 







While Rebel Moon&#39;s narrative could have potentially fit within the Dark Times of the Empire&#39;s rule preceding the original trilogy in the Star Wars canon, Snyder would undoubtedly have been constrained by the surrounding projects and continuity. Instead, one could argue that Rebel Moon fits much better during the days of the Old Republic, an earlier period outside the Skywalker saga that would have provided Snyder with more freedom seeing as how Disney and Lucasfilm de-canonized several events of the era despite keeping the period itself within the official canon.
To that end, Rebel Moon&#39;s fascist antagonists could have been the early Sith Empire rather than the Imperium as introduced in the movie&#39;s first scenes. Seeking to conquer and oppress the rest of the galaxy for the glory of their leader Regent Balisarius, there are plenty of similarities between the Imperium and Sith Empire just as much as the shared dynamics it has with the Galactic Empire seen in Star Wars&#39; original trilogy of films. To that end, the Sith Empire was resisted by those who were once loyal as well.





 6  Kora Could Have Been A Revan-Type Figure 
Seeking Redemption From A Dark Past


 







In Rebel Moon, it&#39;s revealed that the primary protagonist Kora was taken by Balisarius as a child and trained as a soldier of the Imperium. However, she later turned and defected in her adult years, eventually standing against the Imperium as seen in the movie&#39;s present. This somewhat resembles Knights of the Old Republic&#39;s Darth Revan. Originally a Jedi, Revan was corrupted by the dark side. While he was meant to serve the Sith Empire, Revan eventually went rogue before he was eventually brought back to the light, becoming a Jedi once more. The idea of switching sides, returning to the light, and seeking redemption is inherent in both characters.





 5  Regent Balisarius As The Sith Emperor (Tenebrae/Vitiate) 
Dark Rulers Seeking Opressing The Galaxy
        

Seeking absolute dominance over the galaxy after he betrayed the royal family as seen via flashbacks in Rebel Moon, Regent Balisarius controls the entire Imperium as various elements have begun rising against his rule. He&#39;s quite the imposing figure to be feared, and it&#39;s even hinted by the end of the movie that the regent may wield some sort of unique power. As such, it&#39;s not hard to see him as the Old Republic&#39;s Sith Emperor. Known first as Tenebrae and later Darth Vitiate, the Sith Emperor lived for thousands of years in his effort to claim the entire galaxy from the grip of the Jedi and Republic.





 4  The Jimmies Resemble Star Wars&#39; Droid Uprising 
Droids Seeking Free Will And Independence
        

In Rebel Moon, viewers are introduced to JC-1435 aka Jimmy, a mechanical android who was one of several identical androids programmed to protect the king and royal family were were slain by Balisaurus. In the present, they&#39;d been reprogrammed to serve the Imperium and were unable to fight or fend for themselves. However, this particular Jimmy is seen beginning to make his own choices, defying his programming and becoming more independent.
This brings to mind the canonical droid uprising in Star Wars that occurred centuries before the Skywalker saga led by the free-thinking droid known as Ajax Sigma. It&#39;s also reminiscent of Solo&#39;s L3-37 who also fought for droid freedom and rights. As such, Jimmy and his arc in RebelMoon would have fit right in had the movie been part of the Star Wars continuity.

 3  Veldt Could Have Been Dantooine 
Farmers Caught In The Chaos





 2   
Rebel Moon&#39;s Kora is encouraged to stand and fight once the community of farmers she&#39;d been living with becomes endangered by the Imperium&#39;s oppression. Located on the planet Veldt, the world will undoubtedly become a battleground in Rebel Moon: Part II -- The Scargiver with its people caught right in the middle of the battle that&#39;s soon to come. To that end, Veldt could easily be swapped out for one of Star Wars&#39; various farming worlds such as Dantooine which similarly found itself caught in the middle of the crossfire during the Clone Wars.





 1  Nemesis Would Have Been The Perfect Rogue Jedi 
Her Swords Are Basically Lightsabers


 







One of Kora&#39;s new allies in Rebel Moon is Nemesis, a swordmaster whose blades are made of molten metal. After the Imperium killed her children, Nemesis cut off and replaced her arms with her people&#39;s traditional gauntlets, allowing her to wield her blades that look very much like Star Wars&#39; lightsabers. It&#39;s revealed that it was an ancient rite of passage for warriors from her homeworld. As such, it&#39;s easy to imagine Nemesis as a dark assassin in the Star Wars galaxy who was once a Jedi, now walking a much darker path.
