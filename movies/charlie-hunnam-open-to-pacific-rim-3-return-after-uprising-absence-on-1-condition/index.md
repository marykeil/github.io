Summary

  Charlie Hunnam is open to returning for Pacific Rim 3, but only if Guillermo del Toro is involved.   Pacific Rim: Uprising underperformed compared to its predecessor, but viewers have expressed interest in another sequel.   At the moment, there are no plans or developments for Pacific Rim 3, and there is no official word from del Toro.  





Actor Charlie Hunnam reveals that he&#39;s open to returning for Pacific Rim 3 but on one condition. The 2013 movie, directed by Guillermo del Toro, explores an ongoing war between humankind and the Kaiju, in which large-scale robots known as Jaegers were engineered for combat. Hunnam portrayed former pilot Raleigh Becket, who was convinced to join the Pan Pacific Defense Corps to defeat the monsters. Pacific Rim: Uprising was released in 2018, but Hunnam&#39;s character was absent from the story despite Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) and others being brought back. The sequel was also helmed by Steven S. DeKnight, with del Toro serving as a producer.




In a recent interview with Inverse, Hunnam revealed that he would return for Pacific Rim 3, depending on del Toro&#39;s involvement. Check out his response in TikTok below:


 

Hunnam explained that he would do another Pacific Rim installment if del Toro was involved. Read his full statement below:


&#34;I would do anything that Guillermo was doing. If Guillermo invites me to do Pacific Rim 3, I&#39;ll be there, or anything else he wants to do.&#34;



 Would Pacific Rim 3 Ever Get Made? 
          

Del Toro explained the reason for his Pacific Rim: Uprising departure, revealing that he no longer had access to sound stages in Canada and had to begin production on The Shape of Water. Because he stepped down before filming, the story might have been affected, which could change how future Pacific Rim installments play out. The director previously considered a much larger role for Mako, who died when her helicopter was struck down by one of the Jaegers, a decision that upset some audiences. Pacific Rim: Uprising underperformed compared to its predecessor, though both movies have been recognized for their action, and viewers have expressed interest in another sequel.




                  Pacific Rim&#39;s Mako Mori Test: What It Is &amp; Why It&#39;s So Important   Pacific Rim&#39;s Mako Mori is considered so well-developed in film theory circles that she inspired a test named after her. Here&#39;s what that test is.   

If Hunnam returned for Pacific Rim 3, it&#39;s worth wondering how much time would have passed between that and the first entry. Focusing on the years directly after Pacific Rim could allow the franchise to bring Kikuchi back. Regardless of del Toro&#39;s behind-the-scenes role, whether he directs or produces a potential third movie, his involvement would be essential. However, he revealed in 2021 that there were no plans to continue the Pacific Rim films.

Hunnam&#39;s latest comment seems promising since Raleigh survived by the end of Pacific Rim, and there have been no updates for the character beyond that. Still, it seems Pacific Rim 3 may not be happening, especially with no official word from del Toro nor any current developments of another sequel or related project.
