## Literature Review

Following the reveal of a potential synopsis for Superman: Legacy, DC Universe architect James Gunn has responded to the possible story details.




A new potential Superman: Legacy plot synopsis leak gets addressed by James Gunn. The DC Universe starts in 2024 with Creature Commandos, but 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy will be the first movie of the new universe. With only a few details revealed from the movie so far, such as Superman: Legacy&#39;s all-star cast, fans have been looking everywhere for clues about the Superman reboot&#39;s story.




On Threads, Gunn revealed that the Superman: Legacy plot synopsis that has been making the rounds online is not really accurate, though some parts of it are true.

          

The alleged Superman: Legacy synopsis stated that &#34;Superman, a cub reporter in Metropolis, embarks on a journey to reconcile his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing as Clark Kent.&#34; According to Gunn, &#34;It has elements of truth (obviously based on things I’ve said in the past).&#34; However, the director of the upcoming DCU movie says the logline&#39;s description of Clark is not accurate and says he would &#34;wouldn’t describe the plot this way.&#34;

                  What We Know About Superman&#39;s Costume In The DCU Reboot So Far   Excitement is building for Superman: Legacy&#39;s costume reveal, and with the movie shooting in 3 months, here are all the known details about the suit.   





 What James Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy Comments Reveal About The Movie 
          

The &#34;cub reporter&#34; line describing the role of David Corenswet&#39;s Superman in the DCU&#39;s first movie has been around for quite some time. With Gunn debunking that as an accurate description of Clark Kent&#39;s role in Superman: Legacy by saying, &#34;He’s a thirty-year-old full-on reporter,&#34; the Superman movie is bringing a different version of the character than the one that has floated around in descriptions since the movie&#39;s casting stage. That is good.

Gunn has confirmed multiple times that even though Superman: Legacy will include multiple DCU heroes, the movie&#39;s focus will be on both sides of its title character&#39;s life. By having Clark already be a full-fledged reporter at the Daily Planet, it seems like Rachel Brosnahan&#39;s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo&#39;s Jimmy Olsen will already know the character by the time the movie starts. Previously, it was believed that Corenswet&#39;s Clark Kent would be learning the ropes at the Daily Planet with Lois&#39; help.




Gunn has also talked about Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy suit many times in the past. While the director noted the debate over whether Superman should or should not wear the classic trunks, Gunn has revealed that the suit is yet to be finalized and that the trunks debate is not as important to him as the story the movie tells. With Gunn confirming a March filming start for Superman: Legacy, a first look at the new Superman suit and possible story details should be coming soon.









Superman: Legacy releases in theaters on July 11, 2025.
