## Literature Review

Two installments from a ten-part B-movie action franchise land on Netflix&#39;s weekly chart of the most-viewed English-language titles in the U.S.




Two different Sniper movies have become Netflix streaming hits in the U.S. The movie franchise originated in 1993 with Sniper, which followed Tom Berenger and Billy Zane as a pair of snipers attempting an assassination in Panama. The movie didn&#39;t get its first sequel until 2002&#39;s Sniper 2, which was then followed by eight more installments through 2023&#39;s Sniper: G.R.I.T. â€“ Global Response &amp; Intelligence Team. This brought the total to 10 movies, six of which starred Berenger as Master Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett, and seven of which starred Chad Michael Collins as his son, Marine Sergeant Brandon Beckett.




Netflix has now calculated their most-watched English-language movies for the week of December 25 through December 31, 2023. On the chart, 2017&#39;s Sniper: Ultimate Kill has claimed the No. 3 spot, followed at No. 4 by 2020&#39;s Sniper: Assassins End. Both Sniper movies rank higher than several major contemporary blockbusters, including Meg 2: The Trench (No. 5) and Gran Turismo (No. 8).


 What Is The Future Of The Sniper Franchise? 
          

So far, the Sniper franchise does not have an officially announced tenth sequel in development. However, this newfound streaming success could provide producers with a push to greenlight Sniper 11. The franchise has certainly stood the test of time, though one possible reason for its longevity may also account for this delay: it has a relatively consistent cast of main characters.






In addition to the Becketts and Billy Zane&#39;s Richard Miller, recurring characters in the Sniper franchise include Zeke &#34;Zero&#34; Rosenberg (Ryan Robbins), Yuki &#34;Lady Death&#34; Mifune (Sayaka Akimoto), and Pete (Josh Brener).




Although the Billy Zane Sniper return took the longest, with a gap of two titles after his first appearance, every main character in the franchise has now appeared in at least three sequels to their original outing. Likewise, no Sniper movie has been made without the participation of at least one of the three main stars. Collins alone has appeared in the two most recent installments, so his schedule would likely be the one that impacts the possibility of Sniper 11 the most.

                  It Took 6 Years For The Sniper Movies To Finally Unite The Franchise&#39;s 3 Main Characters   The Sniper franchise has cycled through a few main characters, and there&#39;s only one entry where all three protagonists appear together.   

Collins is already attached to upcoming projects in various stages of development, including the actioners Desert Dawn and The Wrecker. While these may delay his immediate return to the Sniper franchise, he has already shown a willingness to continue to play the role over the years, having appeared in every entry produced since 2011. It remains to be seen if another sequel gets off the ground, but the precedent of the past suggests that Sniper 11 is highly likely, even if it takes a few years to be made and released.
