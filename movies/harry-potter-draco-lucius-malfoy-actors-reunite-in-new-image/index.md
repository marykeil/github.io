## Literature Review

The Harry Potter franchise&#39;s Draco and Lucius Malfoy actors, Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs, reunite in a sweet new image shared on social media.




Harry Potter stars Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs reunite in a new image. Based on the beloved book series by J.K. Rowling, the film franchise began in 2001 with Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone and culminated in 2011 with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2. In all eight films, Felton starred as Slytherin student Draco Malfoy, who is initially portrayed as a cowardly bully and a rival to Harry Potter. Isaacs played Draco&#39;s father, Lucius, a Death Eater for Lord Voldemort.




Now, over a decade after the film series ended, Harry Potter cast members Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs reunite in a new image shared on Instagram by the former. Check out the photo below:

 Could Tom Felton Return In The Harry Potter Remake? 
          

In April 2023, it was announced that a Harry Potter show was in development for Max that would once again adapt Rowling&#39;s books, with the controversial author attached as an executive producer. The remake is expected to recast the Golden Trio – Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley – and characters like Draco Malfoy with younger actors. However, several stars from the original film series could realistically return and reprise their roles, or take on new ones.




                  Tom Felton As Lucius Malfoy? 7 Harry Potter Actors Who Could Return In The Remake   HBO&#39;s Harry Potter series will have its work cut out recasting the characters, but bringing back the old cast for their old—or new— roles could help.    

Isaacs, who just recently joined The White Lotus season 3 cast, is now 60 years old and has aged out of the role of Lucius Malfoy. However, this presents the perfect opportunity for Felton (36) to take on the role of Lucius in a passing of the torch. Felton remains synonymous with the Slytherin House and the Malfoy family, so the recast would work seamlessly and pay homage to his previous onscreen parent in Harry Potter.



Max&#39;s Harry Potter TV show is still in early development, and so holds no release date.
