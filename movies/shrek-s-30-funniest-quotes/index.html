<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Shrek is the kind of ogre who is less scary and more silly. Throughout all of his films, he has delivered some really hilarious lines.</p>
<p>The best Shrek quotes show why the animated Dreamworks movie that spoofs on almost every fairytale ever written is considered a classic franchise. Shrek is easily one of the most iconic characters of the 21st century, making his big green debut in 2001 over two decades ago. Mike Myers&rsquo;s stellar performance is a key reason why, but Shrek subverts the clichés of the fantasy genre by being an ogre who ultimately becomes heroic when he’s given a chance to save a beautiful princess — who also turns out to be an ogre. Every Shrek movie is littered with quotable moments, with the best being iconic.
With Shrek 5 in development, it seems as if the big green ogre&rsquo;s place in pop culture isn&rsquo;t soon to be relinquished. Shrek by and large made DreamWorks a household name, and, two decades and four films later, they remain as influential as ever. It&rsquo;s been a full decade since Shrek Forever After, the most recent entry in the franchise, debuted, but audiences are always ready for more witty quips and dry jokes from this hapless hero of fabricated folklore. While waiting for Shrek 5, audiences can still return to the kingdom of Far, Far Away to relive some of the best Shrek quotes.</p>
<p>Every Shrek Movie Ranked From Worst To Best
The Shrek movies range from very good to very very bad. Which animated film is an All Star, and which one is still Holding Out For A Hero?</p>
<p>30  “Well, My Stomach Aches And My Palms Just Got Sweaty, Must Be A High School.”
Shrek The Third</p>
<p>The funniest Shrek quotes aren&rsquo;t relegated just to the first film. In Shrek the Third, Shrek, Donkey, and Puss in Boots journey to find the future King Arthur, finding him enrolled in a place called Worcestershire. As Donkey pontificates about what the place may be, Shrek notes a familiar feeling, with his stomachache and sweaty palms confirming that Worcestershire is a high school. Even though Shrek almost certainly didn&rsquo;t attend high school in his teenage years, this line is nevertheless spot-on for anyone who has. Shrek&rsquo;s signature sarcasm and reliability once again deliver one of his funniest lines in the franchise.</p>
<p>29  &ldquo;If You Think This Mad Scene Ain&rsquo;t Dope, I Feel You, Dude.&rdquo;
Shrek The Third</p>
<p>Another one of the best Shrek quotes comes from his dealings with the teenage Artie. Though Shrek seemed to have a good sense of what it was like to be a high schooler, he certainly didn&rsquo;t have the appropriate lingo for it. In a feeble attempt to relate to Artie, Shrek dusts off some old phrases and makes up a few new ones along the way. Watching the grumpy ogre attempt to see eye-to-eye with a typical high schooler will never get old, especially after he crashes and burns so quickly, setting up one of Artie&rsquo;s best lines: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been kidnapped by a monster who&rsquo;s trying to relate to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>28  &ldquo;I Already Had A Big Bowl Of Curly-Toed Weirdo For Breakfast.&rdquo;
Shrek: Forever After</p>
<p>Given his appearance, Shrek finds that many people assume the worst after meeting him. After a while, however, he embraces their presumptions about him, often replying to their fears with witty retorts. This was certainly the case the first time he met Rumpelstiltskin, who wondered if the ogre would eat him. Though Shrek replied to Rumpelstiltskin&rsquo;s panicked cries with a great retort, this line still shows how difficult his life is when dealing with those who fear him. This is a concept that has carried the franchise through many decades, and will likely continue if Shrek 5 ever hits theaters.</p>
<p>27  &ldquo;How Do You Explain Sgt. Pompous And The Fancy Pants Club Band?&rdquo;
Shrek 2</p>
<p>The funniest Shrek quotes are usually inspired by the ogre poking fun at his surroundings or other characters. &ldquo;Shrek&rdquo; and &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; are two words that rarely go together, as was certainly the case when Fiona&rsquo;s parents sent a brigade of buglers and presenters to the swamp to invite the two ogres to Far, Far Away. Seeing this display of pomp and pride, Shrek had a few choice words for the king and queen&rsquo;s attendants. This line not only provided a bit of color commentary from the signature sarcastic ogre, but it also set up the disparity between Shrek and his in-laws that would carry throughout the entire sequel.</p>
<p>10 Ways Shrek Changed Animated Movies Forever
Shrek has become iconic for many generations of audiences, but the animated film actually made real and significant changes to the movie industry.</p>
<p>26  &ldquo;For Five Minutes, Could You Not Be Yourself?&rdquo;
Shrek 2</p>
<p>The funniest Shrek quotes often see Donkey involved somehow. While embarking on their long journey from the swamp to Far, Far Away with Shrek and Fiona, Donkey found himself at a loss for entertainment. His constant ramblings and annoying noises eventually got on Shrek&rsquo;s nerves, causing him to lash out at his animal sidekick, asking if he could try being someone else. The friendship between Shrek and Donkey has always been one of the many highlights of the Shrek franchise. His blowing up at Donkey is one of the funniest moments in the entire first act of Shrek 2, and perhaps one of the duo&rsquo;s best moments.</p>
<p>25  “Do You Think He’s Maybe Compensating For Something?”
Shrek</p>
<p>The great thing about the Shrek movies is that they’re filled with innuendos. These adult jokes in Shrek are little winks to the parents in the audience that often go over the heads of the children watching, providing something for audiences of all ages to enjoy. A good example of this is when Shrek and Donkey first arrive at Lord Farquaad’s castle and Shrek notices just how tall and wide it is. He cracks, “That must be Lord Farquaad’s castle. Do you think he’s maybe compensating for something?” Perhaps he was simply referring to his height but, somehow, that doesn&rsquo;t seem likely.</p>
<p>24  “Actually, It’s Quite Good On Toast.”
Shrek</p>
<p>In the opening scene of Shrek, a group of villagers gets together with their torches and pitchforks to kill the local ogre. Attempting to rile his friends up, one villager says that the ogre will &ldquo;grind your bones for its bread,” and one of the best Shrek quotes comes when the ogre corrects him. He casually says, “Well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres – oh, they’re much worse. They’ll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin! They’ll shave your liver, squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it’s quite good on toast.” Naturally, this is enough to paralyze the mob in fear.</p>
<p>23  “Donkey, You Have The Right To Remain Silent&hellip; What You Lack Is The Capacity.&rdquo;
Shrek 2</p>
<p>Once again, Donkey plays a big role in the funniest Shrek quotes. Midway through Shrek 2, when Shrek has turned into a handsome human being and Donkey has turned into a noble stallion, they get arrested by the Far, Far Away police. Donkey tells the officers apprehending him that “nobody said I have the right to remain silent!,” and Shrek quips, “Donkey, you have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity.” Naturally, Shrek&rsquo;s witty retort to Donkey&rsquo;s panicked screaming goes right over his head, making the wisecrack all the funnier. Audiences will certainly never tire of Shrek&rsquo;s cracks at his best friend.</p>
<p>Shrek: 30 Things Everyone Completely Missed In The DreamWorks Movie
Shrek is filled to the brim with fairytale references but the film is also abundant with details that many fans missed out on.</p>
<p>22  “Well, That’s Not Very Nice. It’s Just A Donkey.”
Shrek</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no question that the first movie contains some of the funniest Shrek quotes. When Shrek first confronts Lord Farquaad as he’s auditioning knights to carry out a daring quest for him, the diminutive villain says “what’s that? It’s hideous!” referring to the giant, green ogre standing in front of him. Shrek quips back, “Well, that’s not very nice. It’s just a donkey,” referring to his four-legged sidekick. Donkey is so childlike and naive that he doesn’t seem to notice a lot of these backhanded insults, carrying on without a second thought.</p>
<p>21  “That’ll Do, Donkey. That’ll Do.”
Shrek</p>
<p>There’s a rickety bridge in Shrek that leads to the tower housing Princess Fiona. By the time Shrek gets a terrified Donkey to go out onto the bridge, he’s not at all scared because he’s just relieved to have calmed Donkey down. While the Babe reference might have gone over many younger viewers&rsquo; heads, Shrek&rsquo;s line adds to the franchise&rsquo;s ongoing list of references to films that, by all means, could never exist in-universe. Nevertheless, the series&rsquo; tongue-in-cheek comedy can&rsquo;t be faulted for leaping at the chance to make as many pop culture references as possible.</p>
<p>20  “Ogres Are Like Onions.”
Shrek</p>
<p>When Shrek first tells Donkey that ogres are like onions, Donkey thinks he means they stink. Then, he thinks he means they make people cry. In a sense, he’s right about both of them, but they’re also stereotypes of ogres. He’s getting further and further away from the point, so Shrek explains it to him. What Shrek is getting at is that ogres have emotional layers. They’re complex individuals, as Donkey would later find out as he saw Shrek fall in love and learn to appreciate having close friends.</p>
<p>19  &ldquo;Donkey, Two Words: Shut. Up!&rdquo;
Shrek</p>
<p>Having lived in almost complete solitude for most of his life, Shrek has become an ogre of few words. So, when he comes across an excessively talkative donkey, he can&rsquo;t help but be short with him. In the original 2001 film, Lord Farquaad tasks the pair with rescuing a princess from a dragon-guarded castle, and, while Shrek is merely nonplused, Donkey is outright terrified. The animal won&rsquo;t stop talking Shrek&rsquo;s ear off as they search for Fiona, which prompts Shrek to make his annoyance known with this hilarious quote.</p>
<p>Shrek: 10 Times Fans Felt Bad For Donkey
After Shrek fans met Donkey, he quickly became a fan-favorite character. But there were many times when everyone felt bad for what he went through.</p>
<p>18  “A Stack Of Freshly Made Waffles In The Middle Of The Forest?&quot;
Shrek: Forever After</p>
<p>The Shrek movies are known for their meta references to fairy tale tropes, and many of the funniest Shrek quotes come when the franchise leans into its roots as a satire of classic stories. For example, in Shrek Forever After, as the title character and Donkey are out in the woods and see a beautiful stack of waffles, Donkey is excited, but Shrek can see that it’s some kind of ploy. In an old Hans Christian Andersen story, the characters would blindly fall for a trick like this, but Shrek points out how absurd and on-the-nose this trick is. Still, Donkey’s dumb enough to fall for it – and he established his love of waffles as far back as the first movie.</p>
<p>17  &ldquo;This Is The Part Where You Run Away.&rdquo;
Shrek</p>
<p>After sneaking up on a band of villagers in the beginning moments of the first Shrek movie, the eponymous creature reminds them of how vicious ogres can be before licking his fingers and putting out a man&rsquo;s torch. After that, he accosts the group with a deep, guttural roar, sending the group into a panic. Completely stunned, Shrek then gently suggests that they ought to make a hasty escape, whispering, &ldquo;This is the part where you run away.&rdquo; Shrek clearly takes pleasure in tormenting the townspeople, and this quote exemplifies his often deadpan delivery.</p>
<p>16  “Look At Him In His Wee Li’l Boots!&quot;
Shrek 2</p>
<p>Antonio Banderas’ Zorro-like portrayal of the old folklore character Puss in Boots quickly became just as beloved as any character from the first movie when he joined Shrek and Donkey in Shrek 2. His technique of looking adorable with gigantic eyes to get his opponents to drop their guard before launching an attack on them is fool-proof. It worked on Shrek and Donkey when they first encountered him in the woods and Shrek said one of the most memorable Shrek quotes, and it would later work with a few other people later on in the franchise. He proved to be so popular that he got his spin-off series.</p>
<p>15  “It’s Time To Pack Up Your Toothbrush And Jammies. You’re The New King Of Far Far Away.&quot;
Shrek The Third</p>
<p>Following in the traditions of the fairy tales that inspired them, the Shrek movies usually revolve around Shrek and Donkey going on some kind of quest, and it&rsquo;s from these experiences that the best Shrek quotes are born. In Shrek the Third, that quest is to find the heir to Fiona’s father’s throne after he passes away. The kid’s name is Arthur — or “Artie,” as he’s referred to in the movie, and he’s played by Justin Timberlake. When Shrek arrives at Artie’s school to take him back to Far Far Away to claim his throne, the other students assume he’s there to eat him — and then they’re disappointed that he’s not.</p>
<p>10 Reasons Shrek Is Still One Of The Best Movies Of The 2000s
Shrek, which was released in 2001, is nearing its 20th anniversary. Looking back, it&rsquo;s unsurprising this Dreamworks movie is still a hit.</p>
<p>14  “What Are You Doing In My Swamp!?”
Shrek</p>
<p>By far one of the best and most well-known Shrek quotes is &ldquo;What are you doing in my swamp?!&rdquo;. This one is mainly memorable because it became a widely-circulated Shrek meme, but Mike Myers’ delivery of the line is just as memorable. Shrek doesn’t even want Donkey to stay in his swamp, and he discovers in the middle of the night that Lord Farquaad has sent every fantasy creature in his entire realm to live in Shrek’s swamp. He just wanted to be left alone, and now he was being forced to share his sanctuary with dozens of other people. Not only that, but they wanted to actually live inside his house.</p>
<p>13  “I’m An Ogre! You Know, ‘Grab Your Torch And Pitchforks!’&quot;
Shrek</p>
<p>When Shrek first meets Donkey, he&rsquo;s floored by the fact that Donkey doesn&rsquo;t seem to care that he&rsquo;s an ogre. What ties Shrek to Toy Story is that they both revolve around an iconic duo who initially don’t get along, but, after going on an incredible adventure together, they become the best of friends. In Toy Story, that duo is Woody and Buzz. In Shrek, it’s Shrek and Donkey. They do have slightly different relationships, however. While Buzz and Woody are apprehensive of one another, Donkey is instantly accepting of Shrek, even if Shrek is reluctant to open up to him.</p>
<p>12  “Someday, I Will Repay You. Unless, Of Course, I Can’t Find You Or If I Forget.&quot;
Shrek 2</p>
<p>One of the funniest Shrek quotes appears in Shrek 2 as the titular ogre is on his way to save Fiona from being tricked into marrying Prince Charming. As a part of his gallant plan to rescue her, he has to steal some clothes. But, he does promise to pay them back for the clothes — unless he’s unable to find them, or he forgets he owes them clothes. The joke, of course, is that Shrek&rsquo;s word here isn&rsquo;t worth its weight in the mud in which the character bathes. With all the commotion of the movie’s climax, he’ll probably forget about these guys.</p>
<p>11  “It’s On My To-Do List!”
Shrek</p>
<p>In the first Shrek movie, the title character is not exactly what Fiona is expecting when she’s awoken in the castle guarded by the dragon. She’s expecting a handsome prince to come and kiss her, and, instead, she gets an ogre who shakes her violently to jolt her awake. When she comes out of her slumber and gets to know the situation, she realizes that Shrek hasn’t actually slain the dragon before saving her like he was supposed to, he does assure her that it’s on his to-do list.</p>
<p>Shrek&rsquo;s Story Was Saved By This Simple Fiona Fix
Shrek&rsquo;s screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio almost weren&rsquo;t allowed to feature a shapeshifting Fiona, until they changed one simple word.</p>
