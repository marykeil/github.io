## Literature Review

The Rotten Tomatoes score for the new Mean Girls movie is here, with critics weighing in on how the musical compares to the 2004 original.




Mean Girls&#39; Rotten Tomatoes score has arrived, and the new film falls short of the beloved original. 2004&#39;s Mean Girls, starring Lindsey Lohan as Cady Heron, remains a classic, but the film now gets a musical twist from directors Samantha Jayne and Arturu Perez Jr. The 2024 film sees Angourie Rice step into the role of Cady, a new student who joins an elite social group known as the Plastics before falling afoul of her new bestie, Regina, for crushing on her boyfriend.




Now, just ahead of the Mean Girls release date, the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film has been revealed. As of this writing, the score sits at a respectable 73% with 48 reviews, but this falls short of the 84% score of the 2004 original. The film&#39;s audience score won&#39;t arrive until after its release in theaters, but the original only has 66%, which is certainly an achievable target.

Reviews for 2024&#39;s Mean Girls have thus far been somewhat mixed, with a common thread being that the musical doesn&#39;t do enough to really justify its existence. The original, after all, despite being a tad dated in some respects, remains a relevant, clever, and hilarious exploration of high school life.




Although reviews largely praise the new Mean Girls cast, including Rice, Renée Rap, Avantika, and Bebe Wood, among others, some critics argue that the film ultimately plays things a little too safe. This safety presents itself in the film&#39;s humor and general storyline, which is too much of a retread of the original. While it undoubtedly makes for a fun trip down memory lane, the sentiment seems to be that one may be better off just rewatching the original.

The major difference in the new film, of course, is the fact that it&#39;s a musical, and the quality of Mean Girls&#39; musical elements is very much up for debate. While Liz Shannon Miller of Consequence, for example, finds plenty of fun in the musical numbers, Louisa Moore of Screen Zealots calls the choreography &#34;dreadful&#34; and the general song staging &#34;borderline inept&#34;. The audience response to 2024&#39;s Mean Girls could certainly be far more positive, but the original film evidently remains a challenging one to beat.
