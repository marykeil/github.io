## Literature Review

The best idea for a potential American Pie 5 is now perfect and highly likely to succeed thanks to the big comeback of one cast member.




American Pie 5 has been rumored to be in development for years, and the best idea for it is now perfect thanks to the big comeback of one of its cast members. In 1999, the sex comedy American Pie made way for one of the most controversial yet profitable franchises in the comedy genre. American Pie introduced viewers to Jim Levenstein (Jason Biggs), an awkward high school senior who made a pact with his friends to lose their virginity by high school graduation. American Pie’s success made way for a franchise with spin-offs and three sequels, the latter continuing Jim’s story.




Throughout four movies, the audience saw Jim go from an awkward and inexperienced high school student to an awkward young adult now in a relationship with Michelle Flaherty (Alyson Hannigan), whom he eventually married and formed a family with. The last time viewers caught up with Jim and company was in 2012 with American Reunion, released nine years after American Wedding. Rumors about a fifth American Pie movie have been floating around since 2012, and if it finally happens, American Pie 5’s best story is now even more perfect thanks to the big 2020s comeback of one actor.


 American Pie 5&#39;s Stifler&#39;s Mom Story Is Better After Jennifer Coolidge&#39;s Big Comeback 
          

Although the main focus of the American Pie main film series are Jim, Michelle, and their friends, there are two, older characters who were important to Jim and company’s stories: Noah Levenstein (Eugene Levy), simply called “Jim’s dad”, and Jeanine Stifler (Jennifer Coolidge), best known as “Stifler’s mom”. The story of Jim’s dad was linked to his son’s, as he did his best to give him advice, while Stifler’s mom’s story was thanks to Paul Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), one of Jim’s friends who began a sexual relationship with her. Both Noah and Jeanine’s stories took a turn in American Reunion, where, in order to put an end to his grief after the death of Jim’s mom three years prior, Jim and Michelle took Noah to the reunion party at Stifler’s house, where he met Jeanine and immediately hit it off.




In a mid-credits scene, Jim’s dad and Stifler’s mom were shown together at the movies, where she gave him oral sex. American Reunion co-writer Jon Hurwitz shared on Twitter/X that, if the studio is still interested in finding out what happened with the romance between Jim’s dad and Stifler’s mom, “they know where to find us”. This idea for American Pie 5 is even better now and has more chances of succeeding thanks to Jennifer Coolidge&#39;s big comeback in recent years thanks to the TV series The White Lotus. Coolidge has maintained popularity since her first appearance as Stifler’s mom and later thanks to roles in movies like Legally Blonde and A Cinderella Story, but her recent comeback gives American Pie 5’s Stifler’s mom story bigger chances to succeed.



 Will American Pie 5 Actually Happen? 
          




As mentioned above, American Pie 5 has been surrounded by rumors since 2012, with some cast members saying a script had been made and it was a great one, and others denying this. While the spinoff branch of the franchise, American Pie Presents, continues to expand, the main film series seems to be stuck, and there haven’t been any substantial updates on American Pie 5. It’s unclear what American Pie 5 needs in order to move past a concept, but if it does so soon, continuing the story of Jim’s dad and Stifler’s mom is a perfect idea that is highly likely to be well-received.
