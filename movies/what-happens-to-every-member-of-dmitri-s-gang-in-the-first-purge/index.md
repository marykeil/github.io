## Literature Review

The First Purge has an exceptionally high kill count, with few members of Dimitri&#39;s gang potentially making it out alive. 




Dimitri&#39;s gang is one of the most important groups to the lore of The Purge movies, and their ultimate fates have lasting consequences on the universe. Introduced in The First Purge, fittingly enough, the chronologically first Purge movie, the gang of street-level criminals must survive an experimental trial of The Purge in Staten Island, New York, enduring psychotic Purgers, white supremacists, and hired mercenaries all the while. Of course, not all of them survive, as the violent night of released inhibitions gets the better of several of Dimitri&#39;s crew.
Though Dimitri is a drug kingpin through and through, The First Purge depicts him and his crew in a somewhat heroic light, some of them willing to defend their innocent neighbors with their lives. This echoes the Purge movies&#39; continual themes of class warfare and wealth inequality, using good people who turn to crime to survive as its protagonists. It&#39;s interesting to see what kind of fate these characters received, what implications their ultimate fates have on the greater Purge timeline, and whether they were able to survive the setting&#39;s very first Purge.









 








 9  Dimitri Cimber 
Status: Alive
        

The leader of the bunch, Dimitri Cimber was a drug kingpin with a heart of gold who was able to unite the forces of his criminal organization against the government-backed Purgers. Dimitri&#39;s stoic opposition to the Purge put a big target on his back, but miraculously, Dimitri was able to live to see the film&#39;s end credits, despite being heavily injured by the chaos caused by the NFFA&#39;s drones and mercenaries alongside the deranged Purger, Skeletor. His ultimate fate after the First Purge is unknown, as he isn&#39;t alluded to in the following movie or TV series, but it can be assumed he continues to protect Staten Island and fight the corruption of The Purge.





 8  Lorenzo 
Status: Dead
        

Lorenzo, also known simply as &#34;Zo&#34;, served Dimitri&#39;s gang as hired muslce, acting as a no-nonsense enforcer of Dimitri&#39;s will. A critical lieutenant in Dimitri&#39;s gang, Lorenzo was a loyal member with an impressive eye for detail, as he was the only one to notice the impending threat of the NFFA&#39;s drones hovering over the gang&#39;s shoulders. While he&#39;s able to alert the crew and save Dimitri from their gunfire, it&#39;s at the cost of his own life, as he perishes to the drone&#39;s bullets in the street.





 7  7 &amp; 7 
Status: Dead
        

Another of Dimitri&#39;s lieutenants, 7 &amp; 7, sometimes referred to as just Seven, was a drug dealer and operative in Dimitri&#39;s gang. He played an important role in eliminating the Purgers of Staten Island, helping Dimitri to wipe out the violent participants of the experimental purge. Unfortunately, he is also killed by the automatic gunfire of the drones in Park Hill Towers, managing to croak out some final words of encouragement to his longtime friend and boss before bleeding out on the pavement.





 6  Blaise 
Status: Dead
        

The most prominent female member of Dimitri&#39;s gang, Blaise is a tattooed criminal ferociously loyal to Dimitri, portrayed by the rapper Siya. She is also an active participant in the systematic strikes against the NFFA mercenaries and white supremacist purgers, contributing her fighting skill to the cause with unquestioning dedication. Tragically, she is also counted among the dead when the NFFA&#39;s drones get the drop on Dimitri&#39;s friends, also shot to death alongside 7 &amp; 7 and Lorenzo.





 5  Capital A 
Status: Dead
        

Originally beginning the film as a member of Dimitri&#39;s gang, Capital A betrays his comrades when the Purge rolls around, disobeying Dimitri&#39;s orders by donning contact lenses and joining in on the chaos. Later, he upgrades to directly conspiring against his former captain, taking the opportunity of the Purge to make a grab for power and sending his own goons after Dimitri and company. When his attempts fail, Dimitri tracks him down and corners him, unceremoniously rewarding his treachery with a bullet to the head.





 4  Kels 
Status: Dead
        

Another key member of Dimitri&#39;s gang, Kels was tasked with looking over various corners from which the group moved their product. Following Isaiah to a party, he comes into contact with the psychotic killer Skeletor, who manages to injure Isaiah, scaring off Kels into the dangerous streets of Purge night. Later, this decision would come to cost him, as Dimitri discovers that he was among the dead who fell to the guns of the NFFA Purge supporters protecting their corner.





 3  Terence 
Status: Dead
        

A lower-level corner guard in Dimitri&#39;s gang, Terence was one of the younger members of the group. Terence was certainly loyal to some degree, attempting to protect his corner even during the events of the experimental Purge. Unfortunately, he would also be killed by the guns of the New Founding Fathers of America&#39;s mercenaries, drumming up the necessary level of terror needed to justify taking the Purge nation-wide.





 2  Desiigner&#39;s character 
Status: Likely dead
        

The second rapper to be featured in the film, Desiigner plays an unnamed member of Dimitri&#39;s gang serving under Kels. Credited as &#34;Kel&#39;s Crew/Unnamed Partygoer&#34;, the nameless gang member accompanies Kels to the Purge party in which Skeletor appears, fleeing along with the rest of the patrons. While his death is never directly confirmed, it can be assumed he can be counted among the bodies on Kels&#39; corner. Desiigner is also credited as creating a song, Sun Goes Down, that was briefly used in the movie. 





 1  Aesop 
Status: Likely dead
        

Only very briefly mentioned, Aesop can be assumed to be another lower-ranking member of Dimitri&#39;s gang, alluded to when Terence is called out for making an obvious pass to him in a basketball game. Very much a background character, it can be assumed that Aesop could be counted among the dead following the New Founding Fathers of America&#39;s raid on Kels&#39; corner, alongside plenty of nameless gang members. This just goes to show that even those who didn&#39;t have a direct line of loyalty to Dimitri still suffered at the hands of the NFFA just for being involved, giving them no protections against the wanton violence of The Purge.
        


  The First Purge  
The First Purge is an action-horror film that takes place at the beginning of the Purge film franchise timeline, to the conception of the purge itself. To push the crime rate below one percent for the rest of the year, the New Founding Fathers of America (NFFA) test a sociological theory that vents aggression for one night in one isolated community. But when the violence of oppressors meets the rage of the marginalized, the contagion will explode from the trial-city borders and spread across the nation.
