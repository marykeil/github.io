## Literature Review

Denzel Washington and director Spike Lee collaborated on four exceptional movies that have come to be both cultural and cinematic successes. 




Distinguished by the talent and versatility of two of Hollywood&#39;s biggest names, Denzel Washington and Spike Lee collaborations are film treasures to behold despite varying to some degree of notability. The duo share a catalog that grew from the 1990 musical comedy Mo&#39; Better Blues, crossed into the drama and biographical epic genres, and concluded in the action-packed heist film Inside Man in 2006. Their near 15-year collaborative history accounts for endeavors into vastly different genres, narratives, and intentions, yet all of their movies share the critical characteristic of being noteworthy in both cultural and cinematic spaces.
Prior to their work together, Washington already boasted a career that included an award-winning performance as Pvt. Trip in Glory, a recurring role in St. Elsewhere as Doctor Philip Chandler, and a slew of other parts that demonstrated his gift and adaptability for acting. Similarly, Lee was growing into his own as an ingenious director, having managed music videos for cultural phenomenons like Anita Baker and Public Enemy while dabbling in esteemed cinematic projects such as School Daze (1988) and She&#39;s Gotta Have It (1986). When combined, Washington and Lee&#39;s talents melded to create four incredibly different but exceptional movies that prove they are indeed an extraordinary duo in cinema.

 4  Mo&#39; Better Blues (1990) 
        

Mo&#39; Better Blues was Washington and Lee&#39;s earliest collaboration, which aimed to document the livelihood of the fictional jazz trumpeter, Minifield &#34;Bleek&#34; Gilliam (Washington), who struggled with the dynamics of his professional and romantic lives. While Mo&#39; Better Blues was complemented by Lee&#39;s signature camerawork and solid acting by the likes of Washington, Wesley Snipes, Samuel L. Jackson, and Giancarlo Esposito, the comedy-drama received mixed reviews. Possessing the lowest Rotten Tomatoes score out of every Washington and Lee collaboration at 71% with critics and 75% with audiences, Mo&#39; Better Blues was a great effort but least preferred by viewers.





 3  He Got Game (1998) 
        

Lee wrote and directed the 1998 sports melodrama He Got Game following a convicted felon and father who was led to strike a deal with the governor for a reduced prison sentence. He Got Game&#39;s unusual premise, which saw Washington&#39;s Jake Shuttleworth persuade his estranged son to play basketball for the governor&#39;s alma mater, struck a chord with audiences and became a beloved addition to the roster of sports movies not based on a true story. Washington&#39;s poignant performance coupled with Lee&#39;s thought-provoking and unique script made for an emotional film that far transcended the traditional sports drama.





 2  Inside Man (2006) 
        

The 2006 crime thriller Inside Man was the duo&#39;s most lucrative collaboration and Lee&#39;s highest-grossing movie ever. Inside Man more than tripled its estimated $50 million budget with $185 million grossed worldwide (via The Numbers), drawing fans in for the sheer spectacle of Washington, William Dafoe, and Chiwetel Ejiofor&#39;s attempt to foil an expert criminal&#39;s bank heist. The heist thriller didn&#39;t just amass an incredible following either, as the exciting premise of Inside Man also inspired a four-episode series of the same name and a 2019 sequel called Inside Man: Most Wanted.
The Inside Man series is available to watch on Netflix and is lead by a cast including Stanley Tucci, David Tennant, and Dolly Wells. 






 1  Malcolm X (1992) 


 







With the intention of documenting the complicated but incredibly influential story of the human rights activist Malcolm X, Washington and Lee teamed up for the biographical epic aptly titled Malcolm X. Although the movie courted controversy for depicting sensitive themes and events, like the activist&#39;s tumultuous relationship with religion or the circumstances of his assassination, Malcolm X was universally acclaimed, adorned with accolades, and became one of the best films of the 1990s. Supported by a heavy-hitting cast that included Angela Bassett, Delroy Lindo, Albert Hall, and Nelson Mandela, Washington shined in the lead role of the prominent historical figure.
For his performance as Malcolm X, Washington was nominated for a number of awards and won several, such as the 20/20 Award and MTV Movie Award for best actor. The movie itself was nominated and/or the winner of countless more, garnering enough acclaim and recognition that it was eventually selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 2010 (via Library of Congress). Filled with inspirational quotes, stunning visuals, an emotional and faithful story, and championed by an incredible assemblage of talent, the Malcolm X movie became a true testament to what can be achieved when Denzel Washington and Spike Lee collaborate together.
