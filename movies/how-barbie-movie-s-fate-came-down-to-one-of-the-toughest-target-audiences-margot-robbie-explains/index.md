## Literature Review

Margot Robbie reflects on the big battle that ensued behind the scenes involving Barbie’s target audience during the film&#39;s development process.




Barbie producer and star Margot Robbie reflects on the big target demographic hurdle that she and Greta Gerwig had to overcome during the film&#39;s development. Released last year to rave reviews from audiences and critics alike, Gerwig&#39;s latest movie follows Robbie&#39;s titular doll as she travels from Barbieland to the Real World after experiencing an existential crisis.




While Barbie&#39;s box office would end up shattering records and becoming the year&#39;s highest, Robbie recalls during a recent THR actors&#39; roundtable event that executives initially weren&#39;t convinced of the film&#39;s mass appeal.


 

According to the actor, she and Gerwig faced an uphill battle behind-the-scenes when it came to convincing executives that Barbie would appeal to men. Check out Robbie&#39;s full comment below:



“One of the biggest fights was convincing everyone that it could be a full quadrant movie, because it had, you know, a budget that necessitated it being a full quadrant movie. And that means getting men to go see it, and everyone was just like &#39;There&#39;s no way men are never ever, young or old, are never going to go see a Barbie movie.’ And we&#39;re like &#39;But men will go see a great movie.&#39; If it&#39;s great everyone will go see it. People couldn&#39;t get past that.”






  


 How Barbie Became A Movie For Everyone 
          

Going on to make $1.442 billion at the box office on a budget of $145 million, Barbie evidently found success with all major demographics, proving non-believers wrong. The impact of the &#34;Barbenheimer&#34; phenomenon in this success, of course, cannot be discounted. What started as a rivalry between Barbie and Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer due to their shared release date eventually blossomed into a celebration of both, and both movies benefitted greatly from this.

Although the viral nature of Barbenheimer was effective at raising awareness for the two movies and bolstering opening weekend box office performance, it was quality that gave both movies legs. Not only were Barbie critics&#39; reviews overwhelmingly positive, but strong audience word-of-mouth helped Gerwig&#39;s movie stay popular for weeks on end.






Barbie enjoys a strong 88% critics score on Rotten Tomatoes with the audience score not far behind at 83%.




It is true that the doll upon which the movie is based has traditionally proven most popular with young girls, but Gerwig&#39;s movie, in addition to being incredibly funny, tells a story with rich characters and powerful themes that are appealing and accessible to all demographics. The impressive Barbie cast also includes Ryan Gosling as Ken, who gets his own powerful story, with the likes of Will Ferrell, Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, and Simu Liu, among others, also helping to give the film a wide appeal.
