## Literature Review

While neither 28 Days nor 28 Weeks Later left many survivors, some characters still need a resolution to their story. Here&#39;s who could return.




Neither 28 Days nor 28 Weeks Later left many characters alive, but there are still some unresolved stories ahead of Danny Boyle and Alex Garland&#39;s proposed 28 Years Later sequel. The two original movies are credited with breathing new life into the zombie genre, both thanks to their ferocious pace and bleak tone. However, while genuine hope is in short supply in both films, there are still some survivors who deserve some resolution to their story.
The original 28 Days Later is widely regarded as one of the best zombie horrors ever made. Its distinctive visuals, eerie scenes showing a ghostly London, and terrifying antagonists help it stand out against the swathe of imitators that followed. Although 28 Weeks Later was not met with the same acclaim, it is still fondly remembered as a worthy follow-up and continuation of the franchise&#39;s wider story, which centers around a UK-based outbreak of the Rage Virus. In both movies, the body count is incredibly high. Beloved characters are introduced and killed off on a whim, making it difficult to guess who will make it to the end. However, there are still some high-profile survivors who could feature in the upcoming 28 Years Later movie.
            
 
 6 Characters 28 Years Later Can Bring Back To The Danny Boyle Franchise 
There aren&#39;t many left, but some survivors could return to face the infected once more for Danny Boyle’s 28 Days Later threequel, 28 Years Later.












 








 8  Jim 
Cillian Murphy


 







The most obvious characters that deserve a continuation of their stories are the original three survivors from 28 Days Later. In the movie, Jim saves Selena and Hannah from a psychopathic group of soldiers who hatch a horrific plan to repopulate the country. However, in doing so, Jim is shot, forcing him to rehabilitate at a cottage in Cumbria. As the protagonist of the first film, Jim remains a hugely popular character with audiences. Understanding exactly what happened to him after being discovered by the military jet is therefore a key concern ahead of 28 Years Later – a prospect only made more exciting by actor Cillian Murphy&#39;s apparent willingness to return.





 7  Selena 
Naomie Harris
        

Street-wise survivor Selena is another member of the original trio rescued at the end of 28 Days Later. While her story is similar to Jim&#39;s, several factors make her potential character development very interesting. For one thing, it&#39;s well-known that 28 Days Later features several alternate endings, all of which result in Jim&#39;s death. A retcon that follows one of these paths, instead of the film&#39;s actual ending, could place Selena in an interesting position – strengthening her credentials as a survivor. A further consideration is, given her last interaction with the military, how she might respond in the highly militarized future touched upon in 28 Weeks Later. Both potential paths mean that Selena has a fascinating arc ahead.





 6  Hannah 
Megan Burns
        

The final member of the original surviving trio, Hannah is perhaps the least explored character of the three. In many ways, this makes her potentially an even more intriguing lead for a 28 Days Later sequel. One aspect that the original film failed to fully explore is how she processed the death of her father, Frank. Given that this was followed by her terrifying ordeal at the mansion, it&#39;s unclear how this trauma may have affected her character – something 28 Years Later could potentially explore.





 5  Tammy 
Imogen Poots


 







Tammy, along with her brother Andy, is the key narrative driving force of 28 Weeks Later, as the pair desperately try to escape both the infected and the military. After several terrifying experiences, and losing both their adult chaperones, Tammy and Andy do manage to escape aboard Flynn&#39;s helicopter, which flies them across the Channel to France. The bond between Tammy and Andy is one of the strongest aspects of 28 Weeks Later, and the pair are perfectly placed to make a return as adult versions of themselves in the sequel. Given 28 Weeks Later&#39;s cliffhanger ending, with zombies arriving in Paris, Tammy&#39;s true fate is yet to be adequately resolved.





 4  Andy 
Mackintosh Muggleton
        

Like his sister, Andy survived the events of 28 Weeks Later by being helicoptered to safety. However, unlike Tammy, Andy is uniquely placed to have a major impact on the events of the sequel. Like his mother, Andy carries a gene that makes him immune from the effects of the Rage Virus. While he is still a carrier, he exhibits none of the symptoms, possibly making him humanity&#39;s best hope for a cure. As a result, resolving Andy&#39;s story and further unpacking how his immunity works is vital for the follow-up movie, as it could help finally end the devastating outbreak for good after two movies&#39;-worth of carnage.

28 Days Later and its sequel seemingly offered fitting endings to their character beats but still left enough questions for 28 Years Later to answer.








 3  Flynn 
Harold Perrineau
        

A peripheral presence throughout much of 28 Weeks Later, Flynn is nonetheless crucial to the story. A helicopter pilot who represents the protagonists&#39; only realistic chance of escape, he does finally manage to rescue Tammy and Andy from Wembley Stadium. However, his story ends on a tantalizing cliffhanger. When the infected are seen charging towards Paris in 28 Weeks Later&#39;s ending, it&#39;s clear that Flynn&#39;s helicopter has been abandoned somewhere, along with photos of his family. However, there are no bodies, suggesting that he is still alive. Understanding exactly what happened to Flynn, Tammy, and Andy after they reached the European mainland is a key question ahead of 28 Years Later.





 2  General Stone 
Idris Elba


 







Played by Idris Elba, General Stone is ruthless in his resolve to contain the outbreak after a new source of infection is discovered in Zone One. Although 28 Weeks Later&#39;s focus switches to Tammy and Andy after Stone orders the firebombing of the city, it&#39;s never actually confirmed what happened to the general and other members of the US task force. A sequel, therefore, could bring back a battle-hardened Stone after his initial run-in with the infected, perhaps even bringing him to conflict with the asymptomatic Andy. Either way, he&#39;s one of a handful of high-profile survivors who could be brought back for a sequel.





 1  The Activist 
Alex Palmer
        

Although the exact origins of the 28 Days Later outbreak are never explained in great detail, the film&#39;s opening scene does reveal how the virus was first able to spread. When a team of activists breaks into a research facility, they decide to free a group of chimpanzees – despite a scientist&#39;s dire warnings about their infection. In the aftermath, most of the activists are killed. However, the unnamed leader of the group is neither killed nor turned on screen, possibly escaping. This unresolved story could make for an interesting character arc, with the activist presumably more radicalized than ever after seeing the results of the scientists&#39; experiments. It might be an unexpected direction for 28 Years Later, but it would be no less interesting as a result.
