# Billy Zanes Sniper Reloaded Return Explained Why Richard Miller Came Back After Missing 2 Movies


## SUMMARY 


 

Billy Zane returned as Richard Miller in Sniper: Reloaded after 18 years and acts as mentor to young Brandon Beckett.


The Sniper series has evolved from serious action thrillers to taking on a more comedic tone across its ten entries.


Zane hasn&#39;t returned since 2017&#39;s Sniper: Ultimate Kill and there&#39;s no news of an eleventh movie.
