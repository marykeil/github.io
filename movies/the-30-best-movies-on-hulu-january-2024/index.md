Theater Camp (2023)
        

  Theater Camp  


  Release Date    January 21, 2023     Director    Molly Gordon , Nick Liberman     Cast    Molly Gordon , Ben Platt , Noah Galvin , Jimmy Tatro , Patti Harrison , Ayo Edibiri , Amy Sedaris     Runtime    94 minutes    


 Those who enjoyed the mockumentaries of the &#39;90s starring Schitt&#39;s Creek actors Eugene Levy and Catherine O&#39;Hara will be delighted by what the next generation has to offer with Theater Camp. The movie centers around the staff of the AdirondACTS, a struggling theater camp in upstate New York who must work together to keep things running when its founder falls into a coma.
Past and present theater kids will unsurprisingly get a lot out of this movie, but its heart and humor, thanks to its mostly improvised dialogue, shine through for anyone to enjoy, regardless of their experience with the stage.

Quiz Lady (2023)


 







  Quiz Lady  
Comedy



  Release Date    November 3, 2023     Director    Jessica Yu     Cast    Awkwafina , Sandra Oh , Jason Schwartzman , Holland Taylor , Tony Hale , Will Ferrell     Runtime    99 Minutes    


 Whether it&#39;s her Golden Globe-winning performance in the heartfelt The Farewell or being the hilarious comic relief in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Awkwafina has been taking Hollywood by storm, and in Quiz Lady, she teams up with the legendary Sandra Oh. The film centers on the game show-obsessed, high-strung Anne (Awkwafina) and her reckless older sister Jenny (Oh). The mismatched siblings are forced to team up and hit the road to get the cash needed to pay their mother&#39;s gambling debts and rescue Mr. Linguini, Anne&#39;s dog who was kidnapped by a loan shark.
Oh and Awkwafina has impeccable onscreen chemistry, and their Odd Couple sisters dynamic is as heartfelt as it is hilarious. Quiz Lady is one of the funniest road movies in recent years, and it&#39;s all thanks to their stellar performances and Jessica Yu&#39;s skilled direction.

The Death Of Stalin (2017)
        

After his work on blackly satirical hits like The Thick Of It and In The Loop, the terrifying incompetence of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of Stalin&#39;s death was in many ways comfortable territory for writer-director Armando Iannucci. Set during the tense hours and days following the dictator&#39;s demise, the movie balances farcical slapstick with genuinely unsettling paranoia as all the major players jostle for power and attempt to stab each other in the back. A reminder that the ridiculous eccentricities of authoritarianism can still be horrifying, The Death of Stalin won critical acclaim for its deft handling of the subject and hilarious performances.

 Best Drama Movies On Hulu 
The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022)


 







  The Banshees of Inisherin  


  Release Date    October 21, 2022     Director    Martin McDonagh     Cast    Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Kerry Condon , Barry Keoghan     Runtime    109 minutes    


 Martin McDonagh chooses his native Ireland for the setting of his pitch-black dramedy The Banshees of Inisherin. Taking place in the 1920s on a small fictional island, the film finds Pádraic Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) blindsided when his best friend Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) spontaneously ends their friendship. Colm claims that he finds Pádraic too dull and would rather devote the remainder of his life to playing his fiddle. To make matters darker, Colm threatens to cut off his own fingers anytime Pádraic approaches him.
The Banshees of Inisherin is a hauntingly beautiful, almost mythical tale about the complexities of male friendship, and it&#39;s grounded not just by its two leads but by supporting players Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan. All four actors were nominated for Academy Awards, and though they went home emptyhanded, The Banshees of Inisherin lives on as one of the best movies on Hulu.

Pregnant novelist named Rama (Kayjie Kagame) attends the trial of Laurence Coly (Malanda), a Senegalese mother accused of allowing her baby to be swept away by the ocean.
Based on the true story of Fabienne Kabou, director Alice Diop carefully toes the line between horror and sympathy, weaving a complex, thought-provoking narrative. Saint Omer was recognized as the Best International Film by the African-American Film Critics Association, the Best First Film by the Cesar Awards, and has over a dozen more international accolades.

Sophie&#39;s Choice (1982)
        

To this day, Sophie&#39;s Choice remains famous for Meryl Streep&#39;s powerful central performance that secured her first Academy Award for Best Actress. However, even without Streep&#39;s presence in the title role, Sophie&#39;s Choice is one of the most compelling and heartbreaking stories ever told about the Holocaust.
In 1947, a writer named Stingo (Peter MacNicol) moves to Brooklyn and befriends the Polish immigrant Sophie (Streep) and her lover Nathan (Kevin Kline), who suffers from mental health problems. As Nathan grows increasingly jealous of Stingo and Sophie&#39;s friendship, Sophie&#39;s Choice reveals Sophie&#39;s dark history, including how she was interned at Auschwitz. The movie remains just as powerful as it was upon release and easily ranks among the best drama movies on Hulu.

Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017)


 







  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle  


  Release Date    December 5, 2017     Director    Jake Kasdan     Cast    Dwayne Johnson , Jack Black , Kevin Hart , Karen Gillan , Nick Jonas , Bobby Cannavale , Alex Wolff , Ser&#39;darius Blain , Madison Iseman , Morgan Turner     Runtime    119 Minutes    


 On the surface, a sequel to the classic 1995 adventure movie Jumanji 20 years after the fact didn&#39;t seem like a guaranteed winner. However, thanks to an inventive update to the source material, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle delivered above and beyond expectations. Whereas the Robin Williams original revolved around a board game, the 2017 update reimagined Jumanji as a videogame, sucking characters into a virtual world. Add in the unparalleled chemistry between all four cast members, and Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle becomes a refreshingly funny action adventure for all the family.

Snowpiercer (2013)
        

  snowpiercer  


  Release Date    July 11, 2014     Director    Bong Joon-ho     Cast    Chris Evans , Jamie Bell , Tilda Swinton     Runtime    2h 6m    


A dystopian action-thriller with cutting contemporary social commentary, Snowpiercer is a gripping introduction to director Bong Joon-ho&#39;s views on class and capitalism. Snowpiercer eschews the more subtle suburban setting of Parasite for something much more adrenaline-filled — a gigantic train responsible for transporting what remains of humanity through a deadly frozen wasteland.
In this vision of the future, sections of the train are strictly divided according to social standing, with the wealthiest at the front and poorest at the back. When conditions become too much too bare, it&#39;s up to the working classes to fight their way to the front. While Snowpiercer has also been made into a popular Netflix series, the original movie remains the definitive version of the subversive sci-fi story.

 A bloody blend of action and horror, Dog Soldiers is a werewolf movie whose bite is just as bad as its bark.

Influenced by the likes of Zulu and Aliens, and earning a deserved cult following in the years following its release, Dog Soldiers is a hidden gem in The Descent-director Marshall&#39;s career and a great action-horror flick.

  Release Date    June 2, 2023     Director    Rob Savage     Cast    Madison Hu , Vivien Lyra Blair , Sophie Thatcher , David Dastmalchian , Chris Messina , Marin Ireland     Runtime    98minutes    


 Stephen King adaptations will forever be a staple of horror cinema, and 2023 offers The Boogeyman, an adaptation of King&#39;s 1973 short story of the same name, shows why. It centers on sisters Sadie (Sophie Thatcher) and Sawyer Harper (Vivien Lyra Blair), two sisters grieving the loss of their mother with no emotional support from their father Will (Chris Messina). The Harpers&#39; tragedy takes a horrifying turn when a mysterious man shows up at the house and leaves behind a supernatural entity who terrorizes the family.
The Boogeyman isn&#39;t destined to reach the legacy of iconic King adaptations like Carrie (1976) or The Shining, and it does rely a little too heavily on jump scares, but the cast&#39;s strong performances and the themes of grief and loss make this film a memorable story worth a watch.

 After a succession of sub-par releases went a long way towards ruining the franchise&#39;s reputation, Hellraiser (2022) was a welcome return to form. Just like earlier entries, the movie revolves around a mysterious puzzle box that has the power to summon sinister and terrifying demons. However, where other Hellraiser movies have ignored plot and character for the sake of gore, Hellraiser (2022) explores themes of addiction and trauma in order to bring its story to life. The result is a horror that, while not quite on a par with original, is certainly one of the better entries in the series.

 Highly experimental and utterly disturbing despite not showing much, Skinamarink is one of the most unsettling psychological horrors of the past decade. The movie follows two children who awake in their house to find their father missing. To make matters worse, the building&#39;s doors and windows slowly start to vanish, leaving them trapped. The movie has a nightmarish quality, and was even inspired by a recurring dream from the director.

The film follows a single mother, who struggles to contend with her son&#39;s erratic behavior while also trying to process her grief about her husband&#39;s death.
