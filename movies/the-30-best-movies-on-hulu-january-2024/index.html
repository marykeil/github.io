<p>Theater Camp</p>

The movie centers around the staff of the AdirondACTS, a struggling theater camp in upstate New York who must work together to keep things running when its founder falls into a coma.
Past and present theater kids will unsurprisingly get a lot out of this movie, but its heart and humor, thanks to its mostly improvised dialogue, shine through for anyone to enjoy, regardless of their experience with the stage.

Quiz Lady (2023)</p>
<p>Quiz Lady<br>
Comedy</p>
<p>Release Date    November 3, 2023     Director    Jessica Yu     Cast    Awkwafina , Sandra Oh , Jason Schwartzman , Holland Taylor , Tony Hale , Will Ferrell     Runtime    99 Minutes</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s her Golden Globe-winning performance in the heartfelt The Farewell or being the hilarious comic relief in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Awkwafina has been taking Hollywood by storm, and in Quiz Lady, she teams up with the legendary Sandra Oh. The film centers on the game show-obsessed, high-strung Anne (Awkwafina) and her reckless older sister Jenny (Oh). The mismatched siblings are forced to team up and hit the road to get the cash needed to pay their mother&rsquo;s gambling debts and rescue Mr. Linguini, Anne&rsquo;s dog who was kidnapped by a loan shark.
Oh and Awkwafina has impeccable onscreen chemistry, and their Odd Couple sisters dynamic is as heartfelt as it is hilarious. Quiz Lady is one of the funniest road movies in recent years, and it&rsquo;s all thanks to their stellar performances and Jessica Yu&rsquo;s skilled direction.

The Death Of Stalin (2017)</p>
<p>After his work on blackly satirical hits like The Thick Of It and In The Loop, the terrifying incompetence of the Soviet Union in the aftermath of Stalin&rsquo;s death was in many ways comfortable territory for writer-director Armando Iannucci. Set during the tense hours and days following the dictator&rsquo;s demise, the movie balances farcical slapstick with genuinely unsettling paranoia as all the major players jostle for power and attempt to stab each other in the back. A reminder that the ridiculous eccentricities of authoritarianism can still be horrifying, The Death of Stalin won critical acclaim for its deft handling of the subject and hilarious performances.

The Banshees Of Inisherin (2022)</p>
<p>The Banshees of Inisherin</p>
<p>Release Date    October 21, 2022     Director    Martin McDonagh     Cast    Colin Farrell , Brendan Gleeson , Kerry Condon , Barry Keoghan     Runtime    109 minutes</p>
<p>Martin McDonagh chooses his native Ireland for the setting of his pitch-black dramedy The Banshees of Inisherin. Taking place in the 1920s on a small fictional island, the film finds Pádraic Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) blindsided when his best friend Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) spontaneously ends their friendship. Colm claims that he finds Pádraic too dull and would rather devote the remainder of his life to playing his fiddle. To make matters darker, Colm threatens to cut off his own fingers anytime Pádraic approaches him.
The Banshees of Inisherin is a hauntingly beautiful, almost mythical tale about the complexities of male friendship, and it&rsquo;s grounded not just by its two leads but by supporting players Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan. All four actors were nominated for Academy Awards, and though they went home emptyhanded, The Banshees of Inisherin lives on as one of the best movies on Hulu.

The Worst Person in the World perfectly captures that feeling of getting lost in limitless possibility, and it&rsquo;s anchored by Reinsve&rsquo;s masterful performance. The movie was not only nominated for Best International Feature Film at the 94th Academy Awards but also Best Original Screenplay, and its words truly leap off the screen.

Saint Omer was recognized as the Best International Film by the African-American Film Critics Association, the Best First Film by the Cesar Awards, and has over a dozen more international accolades.

Sophie&rsquo;s Choice (1982)</p>
<p>To this day, Sophie&rsquo;s Choice remains famous for Meryl Streep&rsquo;s powerful central performance that secured her first Academy Award for Best Actress. However, even without Streep&rsquo;s presence in the title role, Sophie&rsquo;s Choice is one of the most compelling and heartbreaking stories ever told about the Holocaust.
In 1947, a writer named Stingo (Peter MacNicol) moves to Brooklyn and befriends the Polish immigrant Sophie (Streep) and her lover Nathan (Kevin Kline), who suffers from mental health problems. As Nathan grows increasingly jealous of Stingo and Sophie&rsquo;s friendship, Sophie&rsquo;s Choice reveals Sophie&rsquo;s dark history, including how she was interned at Auschwitz. The movie remains just as powerful as it was upon release and easily ranks among the best drama movies on Hulu.

Snowpiercer (2013)</p>

<p>Release Date    July 11, 2014     Director    Bong Joon-ho     Cast    Chris Evans , Jamie Bell , Tilda Swinton     Runtime    2h 6m</p>
<p>A dystopian action-thriller with cutting contemporary social commentary, Snowpiercer is a gripping introduction to director Bong Joon-ho&rsquo;s views on class and capitalism. Snowpiercer eschews the more subtle suburban setting of Parasite for something much more adrenaline-filled — a gigantic train responsible for transporting what remains of humanity through a deadly frozen wasteland.
In this vision of the future, sections of the train are strictly divided according to social standing, with the wealthiest at the front and poorest at the back. When conditions become too much too bare, it&rsquo;s up to the working classes to fight their way to the front. While Snowpiercer has also been made into a popular Netflix series, the original movie remains the definitive version of the subversive sci-fi story.

<p>Stephen King adaptations will forever be a staple of horror cinema, and 2023 offers The Boogeyman, an adaptation of King&rsquo;s 1973 short story of the same name, shows why.

The Harpers&rsquo; tragedy takes a horrifying turn when a mysterious man shows up at the house and leaves behind a supernatural entity who terrorizes the family.
The Boogeyman isn&rsquo;t destined to reach the legacy of iconic King adaptations like Carrie (1976) or The Shining, and it does rely a little too heavily on jump scares, but the cast&rsquo;s strong performances and the themes of grief and loss make this film a memorable story worth a watch.

<p>Release Date    November 18, 2022     Director    Mark Mylod     Cast    Ralph Fiennes , Anya Taylor-Joy , Nicholas Hoult , Hong Chau , Janet McTeer , Reed Birney , Judith Light , John Leguizamo     Runtime    106 minutes</p>
<p>Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy shine as a murderous chef and a surprise guest at his exclusive restaurant in this comedic horror about the pretensions of fine dining. As an evening unfolds in the Hawthorne restaurant, secrets come to light, the chef delivers a series of ever-more disturbing monologues, and the guests realize that they will not make it past dessert. At times gruesome, there is a sharp humor behind The Menu that made it one of the few horror movies to transcend the genre and become recognized for more than just its most shocking moments.

Fresh (2022)</p>
<p>Fresh<br>
Horror
Comedy
Thriller</p>
<p>Release Date    March 4, 2022     Director    Mimi Cave     Runtime    114 minutes</p>
<p>A brutal parable about the perils of modern dating, Fresh was a welcome addition to the modern canon of so-called &ldquo;elevated horror&rdquo; when it released in 2020. Daisy Esgar-Jones stars as a woman named Noa who is struggling in the dating world, but soon finds what she thinks is the perfect man in Sebastian Stan&rsquo;s Steve. What she doesn&rsquo;t realize is that Steve is a butcher of human meat, and Noa is his latest conquest. The movie is rightly recognized as one of the best Hulu horror movies, as well as one of its most-watched originals.

Titane (2021)</p>
<p>Titane</p>
<p>Release Date    October 1, 2021     Director    Julia Ducournau     Cast    Garance Marillier , Agathe Rousselle , Vincent Lindon , Laïs Salameh     Runtime    108 minutes</p>
<p>Directed by Raw&rsquo;s Julia Ducournau, Titane is a bizarre and unconventional body horror that won acclaim on release. The movie centers on Agathe, who continues to suffer bizarre symptoms years after a car crash left her with a titanium plate in her head. Not only does the experience tend her towards violent behavior, but it is established early on in the film that she is sexually attracted to cars. Exploring themes of identity and historical psychological damage, Titane won Ducournau the Palme d&rsquo;Or, becoming only the second female director to do so.

Hellraiser (2022)</p>
<p>Hellraiser</p>
<p>Release Date    October 7, 2022     Director    David Bruckner     Cast    Jamie Clayton , Goran Visnjic , Odessa A&rsquo;Zion , Hiam Abbass , Brandon Flynn     Runtime    120minutes</p>
<p>After a succession of sub-par releases went a long way towards ruining the franchise&rsquo;s reputation, Hellraiser (2022) was a welcome return to form. Just like earlier entries, the movie revolves around a mysterious puzzle box that has the power to summon sinister and terrifying demons. However, where other Hellraiser movies have ignored plot and character for the sake of gore, Hellraiser (2022) explores themes of addiction and trauma in order to bring its story to life. The result is a horror that, while not quite on a par with original, is certainly one of the better entries in the series.

Skinamarink (2022)</p>
<p>Skinamarink</p>
<p>Release Date    January 13, 2023     Director    Kyle Edward Ball     Cast    Lucas Paul , Dali Rose Tetreault , Ross Paul , Jamie Hill     Runtime    100 minutes</p>
<p>Highly experimental and utterly disturbing despite not showing much, Skinamarink is one of the most unsettling psychological horrors of the past decade. The movie follows two children who awake in their house to find their father missing. To make matters worse, the building&rsquo;s doors and windows slowly start to vanish, leaving them trapped. The movie has a nightmarish quality, and was even inspired by a recurring dream from the director. Shot on a minuscule budget, the movie is deliberately paced and extremely atmospheric, marking it out in a saturated horror market.

The Babadook (2014)</p>
<p>The Babadook</p>
<p>Release Date    November 28, 2014     Director    Jennifer Kent     Cast    Noah Wiseman , Essie Davis     Runtime    94 minutes</p>
<p>Both a complex meditation on motherhood depression, and mental health, and a straight-up terrifying horror movie, The Babadook won universal critical acclaim on release — with good reason. The film follows a single mother, who struggles to contend with her son&rsquo;s erratic behavior while also trying to process her grief about her husband&rsquo;s death. After reading a mysterious pop-up book to her son, the pair seem to be haunted by a terrifying monster, although questions remain over exactly what is and isn&rsquo;t real. The Babadook won a string of awards and was a major financial success, easily ranking among the best horror movies on Hulu.
