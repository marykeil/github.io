## Literature Review

Paramount&#43;&#39;s movie and TV libraries are expanding in January 2024, and there are a number of new original documentaries, series, and films to watch.




Paramount&#43; has plenty of new TV shows and movies coming in January 2024, including docuseries and family favorites. Paramount&#43; launched in March 2021 as a rebranding of the CBS All Access streaming platform, with the goal of expanding its offerings and reach. Thanks to the re-merger between CBS and Viacom in 2019, Paramount&#43; also has access to Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, and MTV libraries.




Unlike some of its competitors, Paramount&#43; has not put an emphasis on original movie programming except in the case of children’s films. However, the streaming service does have a popular lineup of exclusive original series, including the multiple-timeline and decade-spanning Yellowstone franchise. Properties are constantly being added to or taken out of the streamer’s library, however, and it&#39;s not always easy to keep the collection straight. To help, here is a guide to everything new on Paramount&#43; in January 2024.

A new year means a huge number of library titles are added to Paramount&#43;. Among the 117 titles joining the streamer, there is a huge variety. Horror like the first three Scream movies are rejoining Paramount&#43; after being removed in 2023, and while there are plenty of other movies (several installments of Hellraiser, for example) coming to Paramount&#43; as well, some of the classics are the more interesting adds because they aren’t always easy to find on streaming.

Pretty in Pink starring Molly Ringwald is one of those classics. The rom-com sees Ringwald as a girl from a working-class family who catches the eye of one of the wealthiest boys in school. It helped to cement Ringwald as a true talent in the 1980s. Another talent cemented in one of the Paramount&#43; additions? Hailee Steinfeld in True Grit. The Western marked Steinfeld’s big-screen debut, and she hasn’t slowed down since.

Great for families on Paramount&#43; this month are the Spy Kids movies (which have other installments available on Netflix) and Dora and the Lost City of Gold. The latter is a live-action adaptation of one of Nickelodeon’s most popular animated children’s programs but with the title character as a teen. It fits right into Paramount&#43;’s Nickelodeon content.

 January 8 
         

  All About the Benjamins   Chloe   Insomnia   Lords of Dogtown   Love &amp; Basketball   Maggie&#39;s Plan   Menace II Society   Michael Clayton   The Exorcist  

Much like the January 1 library content added to Paramount&#43;, January 8 offers up a great variety of content as well. This selection, however, is quite a bit smaller with only nine movies new to Paramount&#43;’s lineup. There is the biographical skating drama Lords of Dogtown which stars Emile Hirsch and Heath Ledger, the romance Love &amp; Basketball starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps, and the horror classic The Exorcist starring Linda Blair, to name a few. The latter will definitely be a welcome addition for horror fans, especially those who might have seen the most recent Exorcist franchise additions in theaters.






 January 10 
          

  Help! I&#39;m in a Secret Relationship (Seasons 1-2)   The Loud House (Season 6)   The Really Loud House (Season 1)  

The reality series Help! I’m In A Secret Relationship joins Paramount&#43; in January, and it’s a unique take on a reality dating show. The series spotlights couples who have been hiding their relationships from their friends and/or family members, and just what the reasons for keeping a relationship hidden might be. While that will likely appeal more to adults, the other new series on Paramount&#43; on January 10 will be for the whole family. The Loud House already has episodes available to stream on Paramount&#43;, but the Nickelodeon animated series will add its sixth season, as well as the first season of its live-action adaptation. Both shows follow a young boy as he navigates a house in a large family - where he has 10 sisters.






 January 11 
          

  SkyMed (Season 2)  

This Canadian drama has become a surprising hit for Paramount&#43;. While season 2 of SkyMed originally aired on CBC in Canada in late 2023, the episodes will now be available for Paramount&#43; subscribers in the United States. The show follows a group of medical personnel and pilots responsible for flying medical helicopters across northern Canadian provinces. The second season features the crew expanding into new Canadian territories for their work, bringing in new team members, and also challenges some of the personal relationships of the team.

  JUNE  

Johnny Cash has been the subject of movies and documentaries, but now, it’s his wife’s turn. June Carter Cash was a musician in her own right before she even met Johnny, but her accomplishments can sometimes be overshadowed by the chemistry the two shared on stage and their very public romance. This documentary allows those interested in the singer and television star to get to know her outside of her work with Johnny Cash. It’s been endorsed by her family, including Carlene Carter, June’s oldest daughter, who released a statement about the documentary.



This film offers a great opportunity to realize that June was a star of television and music from an early age – decades before she became ‘Mrs. Johnny Cash.’ Steeped in the legacy of the Carter Family and as a solo artist, she always was – and, as seen through this film – always will remain a shining star in her own right. While some may not fully be aware of her many talents, influence and just how much she mattered as an entertainer, this lovely documentary offers clear insight for everyone to see the true character and the joy shared.




In addition to archival footage and interview snippets with June herself, the documentary also features interviews with other legends in the country music industry, like Dolly Parton, and those who have familiarized themselves with her work, like Reese Witherspoon, who played her in the movie Walk The Line.






 January 17 
          

  Aerial Argentina (Season 1)  

Originally airing on the Smithsonian Channel, Aerial Argentina is a series not unlike a Travel Channel series. The series gives the audience an aerial view of landmarks in Argentina. Despite only being three episodes packed with information and great shots. While the series originally aired in 2022, it comes to Paramount&#43; for the first time. Aerial Argentina covers everything from historic landmarks to soccer fields to the wild Patagonia.



 January 24 
         

  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987) (Season 3)  




There have been many versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles adapted for the screen. Until recently, the 1987 television series was one of the best-known animated versions. The third season finally joins the first two on Paramount&#43;. Paramount&#43; has become the home for everything Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles thanks to Nickelodeon&#39;s newest venture adapting the turtles for the big screen and bringing a future animated series to the streamer. In the third season of the 1987 animated series, the show utilizes plenty of children&#39;s programming tropes including the villain and a hero switching places, a new team member, an ancient ninja sword, and even the heroes being denounced by the media. It hits a lot of the plot points the franchise is known for while still being the kid-friendly show families love.



 January 25 
         




  Sexy Beast (Series Premiere)  

Sexy Beast is a prequel series for Paramount&#43;. Just as the streamer had a series that acted as a prequel to Grease in 2023, it now has a series that acts as a prequel to the 2000 British gangster movie Sexy Beast. The original movie split its time between the Spanish coast and London, and the prequel series is expected to do the same. The series is set to explore the relationship between the main characters of the original movie as they begin to get further into the British criminal world.



 January 31 
          

  Air Disasters (Seasons 1-7)   Combat Ships (Seasons 1, 3 and,4)   Strawberry Shortcake: Berry in the Big City (Seasons 1-3)  

The final new shows on Paramount&#43; in January include two docuseries and a children&#39;s animated series. Air Disasters and Combat Ships are both docuseries that originally aired on Canadian television. The former examines disasters on aircraft and recounts exactly how they occur. The latter examines massive warships and submarines that have made history. Strawberry Shortcake is a children’s programming icon, and these new seasons are from the 2021 animated series. The series sees the titular heroine move to Big Apple City with her aunt and adjust to her new life.




Additional content is available to those Paramount&#43; subscribers who have the Showtime add-on as well. Throughout January, Paramount&#43; subscribers will also be able to stream news broadcasts, like The Uplift, and political commentaries, like The Takeout, after new episodes air on their networks. New fictional television content, like NCIS and SWAT, however, won’t begin airing their new episodes until February. Once they do, new episodes of the shows will also be available to stream on Paramount&#43; the day after they air, making February 2024 an even busier month than January for the streamer. Paramount also adds live sporting and news coverage on a regular basis. The content available depends on the playing schedules.
