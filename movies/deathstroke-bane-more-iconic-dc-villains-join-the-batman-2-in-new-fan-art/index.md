## Literature Review

With the world still waiting to learn who will be the main villain in The Batman - Part II, new fan art brings several iconic DC foes to life.




New The Batman - Part II fan art brings to life several members of Bruce Wayne&#39;s rogue&#39;s gallery and what they could look like in Matt Reeves&#39; DC franchise. Following the big success of The Batman in 2022, Warner Bros. Discovery and DC Studios are fleshing out Reeves&#39; Elseworlds-based franchise. The Batman - Part II is currently in pre-production, with filming set to begin sometime later in 2024.




While The Batman saw Bruce Wayne take on The Riddler, many are wondering who will be the next big bad for the Caped Crusader. As the world patiently waits, popular digital artist Bosslogic shared multiple pieces of artwork of villains that could potentially fill that role in as part of The Batman - Part II cast.


 

One of the villains to get the Bosslogic treatment was Bane, the foe famous for breaking Batman&#39;s back. The last time he was featured on the big screen was in 2012&#39;s The Dark Knight Rises, where Tom Hardy played him in Christopher Nolan&#39;s trilogy finale.


 




Bosslogic also did a rendition of Garfield Lynns, a.k.a. Firefly, the twisted pyromaniac. A variation of Firefly was supposed to be featured in the Batgirl movie, featuring Brendan Fraser as a new take on the character, prior to Warner Bros. Discovery canceling the film.


 

With the cast wanting to see the Court of Owls in the franchise, one of the Talon assassins has also been imagined as an enemy for The Batman - Part II by Bosslogic. The last DC property to feature a Talon was the short-lived DC TV show, Gotham Knights, as part of their major Court of Owls storyline.


 




Another DC villain that Bosslogic did fan art for was Slade Wilson, a.k.a. Deathstroke, who is also a main foe of the Teen Titans. Joe Manganiello briefly played him in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League and was supposed to have his own Deathstroke movie within the DCEU.


 

The Mad Hatter was also given a new design by Bosslogic, bringing a more grounded design while still maintaining some of the Alice in Wonderland influences. Jervis Tetch&#39;s most prominent live-action appearance was on FOX&#39;s Gotham TV show, featuring a version of Mad Hatter who was just starting out.


 




Victor Fries, a.k.a. Mister Freeze, also gets depicted as the main foe in The Batman - Part II by Bosslogic, blending in the styles of Reeves&#39; franchise with his DC counterpart. Mister Freeze has only been featured in one live-action movie, as Arnold Schwarzenegger played him in Batman &amp; Robin back in 1997.


 

One of Batman&#39;s less-known villains was also pitched by Bosslogic as a potential candidate for The Batman - Part II, with Anarchy being raised as a potential candidate - which would make sense given his grittier story and political motivations align with this version of the Dark Knight&#39;s movie world. While Anarchy has yet to appear in a DC movie, Alexander Calvert played him in the Arrowverse during Arrow season 4.


 




Bosslogic also tackled one of Batman&#39;s more iconic villains with Jonathan Crane, a.k.a. Scarecrow. On the big screen, Cillian Murphy is the only actor to have played the DC villain, as he appeared in the entire The Dark Knight trilogy.


 

Finally, while James Gunn did debunk a rumor surrounding a storyline that saw Hush take center stage in the story of The Batman - Part II, Bosslogic shared artwork of what he could look like in a future sequel. Hush made his live-action debut during Batwoman seasons 1 and 2, where Gabriel Mann and Warren Christie shared the role, with the latter playing Thomas Elliot having Bruce&#39;s face.

                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   





 Who Should Actually Be The Main Antagonist In The Batman - Part II? 
         

Even though it will likely be quite some time until they announce casting for The Batman - Part II, the question of what direction Reeves is going in terms of Bruce&#39;s next opponent is still a fascinating one that has encouraged much audience debate. While The Joker also appeared in The Batman, Reeves has talked about the fact that he isn&#39;t locked on the idea of the Clown Prince of Crime appearing in the sequel. If the sequel is taking a similar approach to The Batman, the major antagonist will likely be someone who has never been the sole focal villain in a Batman movie before.

Given how The Batman dealt with a villain who was fighting the larger corruption in Gotham City, the Court of Owls would make the most sense for The Batman - Part II, as the secret organization both provides Batman with a mystery to uncover, and some serious enemies to physically face off against via the Talon assassins the Court employs. The Court of Owls&#39; history with Gotham - and role in corrupting it - can explain why Gotham is the way it is, while also allowing Bruce to get to know the city that he is determined to protect even better.






The next entry in The Batman universe will be The Penguin TV show on Max later in 2024.




It will definitely be intriguing to see who Reeves picks for The Batman - Part II, as this is still a fresh universe that the world has only gotten a taste of to this point. With Batman&#39;s gallery of villains being as rich as it is, he definitely has a lot of options, to say the least. Hopefully, whenever The Batman - Part II is getting closer to kicking off principal photography, Reeves and the studio will have news to share to get fans excited.
