## Literature Review

One of the most popular and convincing fan-casts for the role of the MCU&#39;s Ghost Rider has been imagined in some brilliant fan art.




A popular star of The Walking Dead has been imagined as Marvel Studios&#39; Ghost Rider in some brilliant new MCU fan art. The Spirit of Vengeance has been a heavily rumored addition to the MCU for several years, particularly after Gabriel Luna&#39;s debut as Robbie Reyes&#39; Ghost Rider in Marvel Television&#39;s Agents of SHIELD. Speculation has been rising for the antihero&#39;s introduction, as Marvel Studios has been focused more on supernatural storylines, grounded narratives and darker material, especially with the implementation of the Marvel Spotlight banner. With Ghost Rider&#39;s MCU debut expected to be imminent, fan-casts have named many strong actors for the role, including The Walking Dead&#39;s Norman Reedus.




Famous for roles in The Boondock Saints, 8MM and American Gangster, but perhaps best known for his role of Daryl Dixon in AMC&#39;s The Walking Dead and its spinoff Daryl Dixon, Norman Reedus has been one of the most convincing and popular fan-casts for Ghost Rider in the MCU. In December 2023, 21XFOUR shared fan art depicting Reedus as Johnny Blaze&#39;s Ghost Rider in the MCU.


 

The art depicts Norman Reedus with Johnny Blaze&#39;s trademark leather jacket and flaming chain weapon, looking to be astride his burning motorcycle. The art proves just how powerful Reedus would look as Ghost Rider, and the actor has expressed interest in assuming this role.

                  Marvel&#39;s Blade Could Finally Be Ghost Rider&#39;s Ticket To The MCU   Marvel Studios is releasing a new Blade movie in 2023, and that easily could set up an opportunity for Ghost Rider to officially join the MCU as well.   





 What Norman Reedus Has Said About Joining The MCU 
         

Norman Reedus has been fan-cast as Johnny Blaze&#39;s Ghost Rider for several years, prompting the actor himself to comment on the rumors of his casting. During a 2021 interview with Comicbook.com, Reedus stated, &#34;I want to play Ghost Rider... I want a fire skull. I want my face to turn into a fire skull and whip a chain around. That would be great.&#34; Reedus expressed interest in reuniting with The Walking Dead co-star Jon Bernthal, who is set to return as Frank Castle&#39;s Punisher in Daredevil: Born Again, and Reedus could also cross paths with The Walking Dead&#39;s Danai Gurira, who has portrayed the MCU&#39;s Okoye since 2018&#39;s Black Panther.

Even as far back as 2018&#39;s Walker Stalker Con during the &#34;An Evening with Norman &amp; Jeffrey&#34; event, referring to Norman Reedus and The Walking Dead co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Reedus has noted his interest in playing the MCU&#39;s Ghost Rider. Reedus noted that &#34;Ghost Rider would be fun, Silver Surfer would be fun,&#34; (via Comicbook.com), and The Walking Dead showrunner Angela Kang even endorsed this casting in a 2021 exchange on X. Since Norman Reedus himself has a passion for motorcycles, there may be no MCU role better for him than stunt motorcyclist-turned-superhero Ghost Rider, though only time will tell if this fan-casting comes to fruition.
