## Literature Review

While The Final Destination franchise lacks intricate characters, there are some that vividly capture the essence of narrowly escaping Death.





While The Final Destination franchise is not known for its complex characters, certain ones stand out for vividly portraying the experience of evading Death itself. Over the course of five films, viewers follow groups of people who manage to narrowly escape tragedy, only to find that Death eventually catches up to claim them. As each character grapples with impending doom, their will to survive leads them to make choices that reveal core aspects of human nature when confronted by mortality. Though the plots rely more on creative death scenes than on character development, several of the doomed protagonists convey a relatable sense of anguish in racing against time and fate.
Select characters showcase denial, bargaining, defiant determination, or regretful acceptance at various turns. Their thought processes and ensuing actions encapsulate reactions that mirror how an average person might respond if somehow forewarned about facing imminent death. With Final Destination 6 confirmed, the franchise will continue to rely on gory demises for shock value, but also will interweave a tragic narrative arc for characters resigned to cruel twists of fate. Exploring the memorable Final Destination characters, whose encounters with Death left lasting impressions, provides insights into what lies ahead.
