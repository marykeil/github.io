# Star Wars Gives The Death Star An Even Greater Legacy For Luke Skywalker


## SUMMARY 



  Luke Skywalker&#39;s green-bladed lightsaber is tied to the origins of the Death Star, further connecting their legacies.   Luke met a kyber specialist named Doctor Cuata, who worked on the Death Star project and helped him build his lightsaber.   The crystal given by Cuata turns green after bonding with Luke, symbolizing hope and a poetic symmetry considering the doctor&#39;s past with the Death Star.

## Literature Review

Star Wars has further tied the Death Star&#39;s legacy to Luke Skywalker, connecting its very inception to the creation of the Jedi&#39;s green lightsaber.




Star Wars has further tied the Death Star&#39;s legacy to Luke Skywalker in a very exciting way. In 2023, Marvel&#39;s canonical Star Wars comics set between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi have begun to reveal the origins of Luke Skywalker&#39;s green-bladed lightsaber. To that end, it&#39;s been revealed that the Death Star&#39;s very inception is intrinsically tied to the creation of Luke&#39;s lightsaber.




It&#39;s been proven that Luke Skywalker was quite busy between Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. This includes his discovery of a yellow-bladed lightsaber he temporarily wielded between films. However, Luke started looking to build his own green-bladed lightsaber once his new weapon started malfunctioning. This brought Luke face to face with one Doctor Cuata, a kyber specialist with a remarkable history in the Star Wars timeline.

Although Luke and Doctor Cuata met in 2023&#39;s Star Wars #35 by Charles Soule and Madibek Musabekov, the Pantoran kyber expert made his first appearance in the 2016 novel Catalyst by James Luceno. Having done extensive study on worlds rich with kyber crystals such as Christophsis and Mygeeto, Cuata was eventually recruited by the Galactic Empire to work on the Death Star project with Rogue One&#39;s Galen Erso (the man who created the Death Star&#39;s secret weakness). However, Cuata managed to escape once several of his colleagues began disappearing.




Having returned to Christophsis to continue his kyber studies in relative solitude, the somewhat eccentric doctor was found by Luke Skywalker in the aftermath of The Empire Strikes Back, having been led to the world after learning from a Jedi holocron. Although Luke had originally wanted his yellow-bladed lightsaber repaired, Cuata went further by offering the young Jedi a brand-new crystal instead.

After bonding with a young piece of transparent kyber which granted Luke a key Force vision, the crystal turns green in Skywalker&#39;s hand, all but confirming that it will eventually become the focusing crystal in the new lightsaber he&#39;ll eventually build and wield in Return of the Jedi. To that end, the poetic symmetry is incredibly entertaining: The man who was directly involved in the creation of the Star Wars galaxy&#39;s greatest weapon of oppression is the very same man who later provided the means to create an even greater weapon symbolizing hope with Luke&#39;s green-bladed lightsaber.
