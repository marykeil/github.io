A new poster for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has been released, and it shows just how confident the studio is in the MonsterVerse franchise.

Godzilla and Kong are both presented in silhouette, which is an interesting choice for this big of a film.

Only featuring Godzilla and Kong&#39;s silhouettes may seem like a risky move, but it actually perfectly reflects how confident Legendary is in the continued success of the franchise. This creative choice shows that Legendary doesn&#39;t feel the need to show off an in-depth look at the characters or the advanced CGI, with the outlines of the characters being enough to sell the movie. Legendary knows that Godzilla and Kong are instantly recognizable, and the success of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is riding on this fact.

While it may seem a little cocky at first glance, it is clear that Godzilla and Kong really are part of a franchise big enough to warrant a poster like this. Outside of the MCU, the MonsterVerse is the only franchise that has been consistently successful, with it consisting of commercial hit after commercial hit. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the culmination of everything that has come before, so it makes sense to be confident in the film.

Even the MonsterVerse&#39;s smaller projects like Monarch: Legacy of Monsters have been immensely successful, showing the power that the MonsterVerse brand has. The MonsterVerse is huge right now, and Legendary&#39;s confidence in the success of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is just a reflection of how confident they are in it.
