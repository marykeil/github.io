# Tom Hanks Has Held This Impressive Oscars Title For Over 9 Years (And It Wont Be Lost At The 2024 Oscars)


## SUMMARY 



  Tom Hanks is the only living actor with two consecutive Oscar wins, a title he has held for over nine years.   Hanks won his back-to-back Oscars in 1994 and 1995 for his performances in &#34;Philadelphia&#34; and &#34;Forrest Gump&#34; respectively.   None of the actors who won Oscars in 2023 are expected to be nominated again in 2024, so Hanks is likely to maintain his title.

## Literature Review

More than nine years ago, Tom Hanks earned an Oscars title that dates back to his &#39;90s Oscar wins, and he&#39;ll likely keep it after the 2024 Oscars.




Tom Hanks can rest assured that the Oscars title he&#39;s held since 2014 will most likely remain his after the 2024 Oscars. Predictions for the 2024 Oscar nominations have been circulating for some time now, but official nominations for the 2024 Oscars will be finally announced on January 23, 2024. Though he&#39;s not expected to be nominated for his work in Wes Anderson&#39;s Asteroid City this year (a film that seems to have flown under the awards&#39; radar), Hanks remains one of the top 20 most Oscar-nominated male actors of all time.




Within the span of twelve years, Hanks was nominated for five Best Actor Oscars from 1989-2001. Almost two decades later, he received his most recent Oscar nomination in 2020, this time for Best Supporting Actor due to his performance in A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. Of his six Oscar nominations, Hanks has won twice, both for Best Actor in the 1990s for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump. His two Oscar wins made him one of the few actors to achieve an impressive Oscars feat, and eventually earned Hanks an Oscars title he still has to this day.

                  Tom Hanks&#39; Movie Career Was Forever Changed By This $206 Million Box Office Hit Over 30 Years Ago   Today, Tom Hanks is regarded as an actor capable of any role, and it was his dramatic performance in a 1993 movie that earned him this reputation.   


 Tom Hanks Became The Only Living Actor With Two Consecutive Oscar Wins Over 9 Years Ago 
Hanks&#39; title stems from his two back-to-back Oscar wins in the 1990s
         




In 1994, Hanks won his first Oscar for his performance as attorney Andrew Beckett in Philadelphia. The following year, Hanks won for Best Actor yet again, this time for playing the titular role in Forrest Gump. With these two consecutive wins, Hanks became one of the few actors in history to win two acting Oscars in a row. Since he accomplished this feat in 1995, no other actor has won two consecutive Oscars.

At the time of Hanks&#39; second win in 1995, three of the other four actors with two consecutive wins in Oscars history were still alive. It wasn&#39;t until December 30, 2014, that the last remaining actor with back-to-back Oscar wins, Luise Rainer, died. Rainer was actually the first actor to win two Oscars in total, which she received one after the other in 1937 and 1938 from The Great Ziegfeld and The Good Earth. With Rainer&#39;s death at 104 years old (the oldest living Oscar winner at the time of her death), Hanks became the only living actor with two consecutive acting Oscar wins.




Since Rainer&#39;s passing, Hanks has maintained his title as the only living actor with two back-to-back Oscar wins for more than nine years. There were a few close calls, though, the first of which was only a little over a year after he gained the title. In 2016, Eddie Redmayne&#39;s role in The Danish Girl was nominated for Best Actor after winning the previous year, as was Sam Rockwell for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Vice after winning the year before. Both lost their second nominations, and no other actors have been nominated a year after winning an Oscar since, keeping Hanks&#39; title secure.

 None Of The 2023 Oscars Acting Winners Are Likely Candidates For 2024 Oscars Nominations 
It&#39;s extremely unlikely that Hanks will lose his title after the 2024 Oscars
         




In order for Hanks to lose his title in 2024, one of the four actors who won at the Oscars last year would have to win again this year. In 2023, three of the four winners in acting categories won for their performances in Everything Everywhere All At Once: Michelle Yeoh for Best Actress, Ke Huy Quan for Best Supporting Actor, and Jamie Lee Curtis for Best Supporting Actress. As for Best Actor, Brendan Fraser won for The Whale.

While most of them did star in films in 2023, none of last year&#39;s winners are expected to be nominated for any of their 2023 film performances at the 2024 Oscars. Quan only did TV roles in 2023, starring in American Born Chinese and Loki. Curtis had one film role in Disney&#39;s Haunted Mansion remake in 2023, but her performance has not been a part of the conversation for Best Supporting Actress at the 2024 Oscars. 

Yeoh&#39;s 2023 film roles include voicing Airazor in Transformers: Rise of the Beasts and playing Joyce Tenolds in A Haunting in Venice, but neither of which are expected to be recognized by the Academy at the 2024 Oscars. Fraser did have a minor role in Martin Scorsese&#39;s major Oscar contender, Killers of the Flower Moon, but he&#39;s not one of the film&#39;s predicted Best Supporting Actor Oscar nominees. All in all, given the likelihood of last year&#39;s winners receiving Oscar nominations this year, Hanks is at virtually no risk of losing his Oscars title in 2024.




                  Only These 6 Actors Have Been Nominated For Multiple Oscars For Playing The Same Character   Only six actors in Academy Awards history have received multiple Oscar nominations for playing the same character more than once in different movies.   



 Only 5 Actors In History Have Won Two Consecutive Acting Oscars 
It&#39;s very uncommon for an actor to win two Oscars in a row
         

Given how rare it is to win two acting Oscars in a row, Hanks could keep his Oscars title for years, decades, or possibly even the rest of his life. Plenty of actors have been nominated in acting categories two years in a row, many of whom were nominated again after winning an Oscar the previous year, but only five in total have won both times. After Rainer in 1938, three other actors won two acting Oscars back-to-back before Hanks in 1995.

The same year Rainer became the first actor with consecutive Oscar wins, Spencer Tracy won his first Oscar for Captains Courageous, followed by his second for Boys Town in 1939. Thirty years later, Oscars darling Katharine Hepburn won for Guess Who&#39;s Coming to Dinner (starring Tracy in his final acting role) in 1968 and The Lion in Winter in 1969. Less than ten years later, Jason Robards joined this exclusive club with his Best Supporting Actor wins for All the President&#39;s Men in 1977 and Julia in 1978. Hanks came next, and no actor has won two consecutive Oscars since.
