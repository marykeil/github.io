Summary

  Deadpool 3 will be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Phase 5.   A new behind-the-scenes image showcases the comic-accurate costume from the movie.   The costume appears to be in better shape and has a brighter color compared to previous movies.  






Deadpool 3&#39;s comic-accurate costume has been showcased in a new image. The 2024 movie will be the second sequel in the Deadpool franchise, which stars Ryan Reynolds as the titular &#34;merc with a mouth&#34; Wade Wilson. Although Deadpool was originally a branch of 20th Century Studios&#39; X-Men franchise, Disney has since bought out that studio and this new sequel is being folded into their ongoing franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as part of Phase 5.

On Instagram, Ryan Reynolds celebrated New Year&#39;s by sharing a collection of photos from throughout 2023, including one from the set of the upcoming Deadpool 3, which is the final image in the carousel. Check out the post below:


 

The caption of the post says &#34;Thank you 2023&#34; and celebrates the fact that Reynolds &#34;got to spend most of the year working and playing with the people I [love.]&#34; The final image is a full-body shot of Reynolds in costume as Deadpool, lacking only his signature mask.


 Will Being Part Of The MCU Change Deadpool? 
          

For the most part, the Deadpool costume that Reynolds is wearing in this new image features the same design as the first two Deadpool movies. However, it does seem to be in less weather-beaten shape and dyed a brighter color than the suit depicted in the previous movies. While this could be a result of the fact that this is a behind-the-scenes image rather than a color-corrected shot from the movie itself, it could also indicate some of the ways that being part of the MCU will change the Deadpool franchise.

              Related   How Will Deadpool Join The MCU? Every Theory   Deadpool is finally joining the MCU with his third solo movie, but the biggest question is how he will be integrated into this universe.    

So far, the Disney-owned Marvel Studios has put in a great deal of effort to ensure fans of the original Deadpool movies that the new sequel will remain true to the tone of the franchise. This includes making it the first R-rated entry in the franchise and hiring frequent Reynolds collaborator Shawn Levy to direct. The MCU has also set the table for Deadpool&#39;s iconic breaking of the fourth wall by adapting the She-Hulk comics, which feature a similar conceit, into a Disney&#43; show.



Deadpool makes a habit of mocking the characters and real-life performers from his own franchise.




Despite some minor aesthetic changes, it ultimately seems that being a part of the MCU will help the sequel lean in on its eccentricities more than anything else. This includes the fact that the Deadpool 3 cast will feature, for the first time in the subfranchise, Hugh Jackman reprising his X-Men role as Wolverine. While this evokes the MCU bringing back previous iterations of Spider-Man in the smash hit Spider-Man: No Way Home, it also perfectly ties in with the Deadpool franchise&#39;s willingness to mine previous superhero movies for comedic value.
