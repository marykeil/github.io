# What The Peaky Blinders Movie Finally Happening Means For The Franchise


## SUMMARY 



  The Peaky Blinders movie and spinoffs will expand the franchise by exploring different time periods and characters.   The Polly Gray spinoff is likely a prequel that will delve deeper into her backstory and honor the late Helen McCrory&#39;s portrayal.   The Peaky Blinders movie will introduce new characters and potentially serve as a prologue for the Boston spinoff, which could focus on Tommy&#39;s business dealings in the United States and Alfie Solomons&#39; familial ties.

## Literature Review

Peaky Blinders has immense popularity with six seasons under its belt &amp; has the opportunity to build its franchise even more with the confirmed movie.




The Peaky Blinders movie raises curiosity about what it could mean for the franchise. Peaky Blinders&#39; final and sixth season ended in 2022 with the legendary Tommy Shelby (Cillian Murphy) surviving after being diagnosed with a supposed brain tumor in episode 4 of the season. Tommy has a revelation in the Peaky Blinders series finale that Doctor Holford was in cahoots with Oswald Mosley (Sam Claflin) to get rid of him. Despite Tommy&#39;s fake diagnosis having a very minimal and flimsy set up, the reveal definitely facilitates more of Tommy&#39;s story for the movie to cover.




Moreover, two Peaky Blinders spinoffs have been introduced in conjunction with the confirmed Peaky Blinders movie, which will pick up after Tommy&#39;s story ends in the main show against a World War II backdrop. The Peaky Blinders Boston spinoff will be set several decades after the events of the main show&#39;s series finale, and the Polly Gray spinoff will dig deeper into the Shelby matriarch&#39;s life. How all these stories will connect is yet to be revealed, but it rebuilds momentum for the franchise on a large scale.


 The Confirmed Peaky Blinders Movie &amp; Reported Spinoffs Can Expand the Franchise 
          

The Boston spinoff will be set in the mid-1900s, decades after the main show&#39;s ending. The Polly spinoff, on the other hand, will likely be a prequel story since the late Helen McCrory passed away. Exploring Polly&#39;s backstory in more detail can help add to her already strong characterization and even be a tribute to McCrory&#39;s portrayal. Both spinoffs differ in approach, suggesting the franchise is flexible in how it can expand.




Furthermore, while the Peaky Blinders movie is set to tell a World War II story, series creator Steven Knight has shared that new faces will also be introduced in the film. Although no story details beyond this have been confirmed, Knight&#39;s comments add to the similar trend the spinoffs indicate - stories focused on more than just Tommy Shelby. Additionally, given that the movie is meant to close out Tommy&#39;s story, he will still likely be the protagonist. However, his story ending suggests an opening for future character-driven stories to expand the universe outside just him and potentially other characters&#39; legacies.

 The Peaky Blinders Movie Could Be A Prologue For The Boston Spinoff 
          




The Boston spinoff in particular is an ideal way to bridge past Tommy&#39;s story, while still staying linked to the Peaky Blinders universe. The Peaky Blinders movie can possibly fill some gaps between the main show&#39;s ending and the Boston spinoff, set a couple of decades later, by planting the seeds for the spinoff&#39;s story. The spinoff could focus on Tommy&#39;s business dealings in the United States (now likely managed by his family&#39;s descendants, either Charlie or Duke).

Additionally, the Boston spinoff could delve into more about already introduced American characters, such as Gina Gray (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her uncle, Jack Nelson, whose whereabouts are unknown by the end of the main show. Alfie Solomons (Tom Hardy) could also return in the Boston spinoff since he seized some of the Nelson family&#39;s property and he has ties to Boston gangs through his uncle Charlie. The Peaky Blinders movie can set up numerous side characters that could slot into future spinoffs as a way to connect them to the main Peaky Blinders story, laying a path for the franchise to expand.






The Peaky Blinders movie is expected to start filming in mid-2024.
