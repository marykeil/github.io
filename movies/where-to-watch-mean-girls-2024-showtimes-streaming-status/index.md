## Literature Review

The 2024 musical adaptation of Mean Girls puts a new spin on a familiar story, and there are options regarding where to watch Mean Girls 2024. 




The Mean Girls musical remake movie has arrived, and there are different options for where to watch it. The original 2004 film starring Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams became so popular that Tina Fey turned the story into a musical many years later. Now, 2024 marks the release of the musical movie adaptation of Mean Girls. The story of Cady Heron and the Plastics remains mostly the same, but there are some modern updates and the addition of more song and dance sequences. This includes recasting the key roles with Angournie Rice, Reneé Rapp, and others headlining the musical take.




Anticipation for the Mean Girls 2024 musical has been high ever since it was announced. The cult classic status of the original movie and Mean Girls&#39; iconic moments have helped it retain pop culture relevance and increase interest in returning to this world. Paramount Pictures originally had a very different plan in mind when it came to how and where to watch Mean Girls than what was ultimately settled on. Instead of being an exclusive release on the Paramount&#43; streaming service as previously planned, the 2024 update has the opportunity to find its audience in theaters first.
