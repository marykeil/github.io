Summary

  The production process behind Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse is highly secretive, even the actors are only given minimal information.   The secrecy helps preserve the surprise and makes the viewing experience more meaningful for fans.   The studio goes to great lengths to keep the franchise under wraps, which ultimately benefits the fans.  





In a recent interview, actress Kimiko Glenn shared an update about the upcoming Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse and revealed just how secretive the production process behind the franchise can be. Glenn plays the role of Peni Parker, a Spider-Man variant from an alternate universe that fights crime through a robotic suit and psychic link with a spider. Stars like Shameik Moore and Hailee Steinfeld are expected to reprise their roles in the new entry, but it&#39;s currently unknown what the final cast list will look like.




Only a handful of details about Beyond the Spider-Verse have currently been made public, but it&#39;s not just fans who are kept in the dark when it comes to the franchise. In a recent Screen Rant interview for Hazbin Hotel, Glenn revealed that even the actors are only given the bare minimum of information, to the point that she didn&#39;t even know what film she was auditioning for. Check out the full quote below:

You&#39;ve also done an amazing job in the Spider-Verse movies. I know that the third one is still very far away, but have you been given any info about it at all?


Kimiko Glenn: Even if I was, I&#39;d never be able to talk about it. When I did the first one, I didn&#39;t see the script, you know what I mean? I didn&#39;t know what I was auditioning for. When I got it, they showed me all the stuff and I got lines I was supposed to say. I didn&#39;t know anything. I didn&#39;t know anything until I saw myself.


                  What&#39;s Next For Miles Morales? Everything We Know About Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse   Miles Morales and his allies will return for a third Spider-Verse adventure following the exciting ending of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.   





 Secrecy Makes The Spider-Verse Movies Better 
         

Considering Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s cliffhanger ending, fans undoubtedly have a lot of questions about what will unfold in the next movie. Some franchises don&#39;t do much when it comes to preserving the secrecy of their narrative, sometimes even seemingly giving away most of a film&#39;s plot in its trailers. While the precautions taken by the production team may come off as a bit extreme, the movies are undoubtedly richer due to the great care taken to ensure the audience comes to them with as little information as possible.



This allows fans to be surprised by things like cameos and plot twists and makes the first viewing experience arguably more meaningful.







With things like the fate of Miles Morales&#39; father currently up in the air, there are certainly a lot of important questions about Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse that are currently unanswered. It&#39;s obvious from Glenn&#39;s anecdote that the studio goes to great lengths to keep the franchise under wraps as much as possible leading up to release, which is ultimately much better for fans.



Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse currently has no set release date.
