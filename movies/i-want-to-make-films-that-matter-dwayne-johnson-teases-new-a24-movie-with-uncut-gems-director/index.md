## Literature Review

Dwayne Johnson teases his upcoming A24 film The Smashing Machine from Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie, explaining the movie&#39;s importance.




Dwayne Johnson has opened up about his collaboration with Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie for his upcoming film The Smashing Machine. The A24 production will see Johnson take on the role of real-world MMA fighter Mark Kerr, highlighting his career. The movie will be Safdie&#39;s first solo directorial venture after having collaborated with his brother, John Safdie, throughout his career.




Speaking to Variety, Johnson has highlighted the importance of his role as Kerr in A24&#39;s The Smashing Machine. The actor wants the film to have an impact on its audience, saying he wants to star in movies that have more substance and humanity in them. Check out some of what Johnson had to say below:


Benny [Safdie] wants to create, and continues to push the envelope when it comes to stories that are raw and real, characters that are authentic and at times uncomfortable and arresting. I’m at a point in my career where I want to push myself in ways that I’ve not pushed myself in the past. I’m at a point in my career where I want to make films that matter, that explore a humanity and explore struggle [and] pain.
I want to be clear not to say that this is an abandonment of big, four-quadrant movies. I love making them, and there is tremendous value and importance in [them] … but there’s a time and a place for them. I’m at this point in my career where I want more. And I don’t mean I want more box office. I mean I want more humanity. And that is why Benny Safdie is the perfect, collaborative, hungry partner for me.






 What To Expect From The Smashing Machine 
          

Johnson&#39;s role as Kerr shows how much he wants to highlight the human story behind the fighter&#39;s many wins throughout his career. In real life, the figure also struggled with substance abuse, something documented alongside his career in 2002&#39;s The Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr. With the biopic pulling its title from the documentary, it&#39;s clear the actor and Safdie want to honor everything Kerr went through in his career.

                  The Rock&#39;s A24 Movie Is So Much More Exciting Than His Fast &amp; Furious Return   After decades of action franchise roles, his upcoming A24 biopic with prestige potential marks a new chapter in Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson&#39;s career.    

Johnson&#39;s The Smashing Machine marks a major career change, given his notoriety for blockbusters, such as the Jumanji and Fast &amp; Furious franchises. While more realistic stories likely won&#39;t stop him from making big-budget movies, they will add a new dynamic to his abilities as an actor. Much like how Uncut Gems proved Adam Sandler could star in a crime thriller, this new movie will test its star in a dramatic, realistic role.




With a Fast &amp; Furious Hobbs spinoff and a live-action remake of Moana on their way, Johnson&#39;s career is at a very busy, diverse point. Adding a grounded, dramatic role to his itinerary highlights just how dynamic the films he&#39;s starring in are becoming. With a busy schedule ahead of him, it appears he&#39;ll be going down a new acting avenue with The Smashing Machine and any smaller films he makes afterward.



Johnson will also star in the action-adventure film Red One later this year.
