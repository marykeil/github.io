## Literature Review

Matthew Vaughn is back with his 2024 film, Argylle, but this movie is going to need to break a years long trend if it’s going to be a success.




Three years after the release of his last film, director Matthew Vaughn is finally back with his new movie, Argylle, but if this film wants to become a successful franchise, it is going to have to break Vaughn&#39;s 13-year movie streak. Argylle is an action thriller movie following a woman named Elly, who writes a successful series of novels about a spy named Argylle, however, her life is turned upside down when real life bad guys come after her, and she realizes that her fiction may not be as fake as she thought. The film is directed by Matthew Vaughn, who is the mind behind Kick-Ass and Kingsman. 




Matthew Vaughn is no stranger to action movie franchises. One of his most popular projects, the Kingsman movies, spawned three movies in total over the course of seven years. The director and writer has always been a part of the X-Men franchise as well. In this way, Matthew Vaughn knows what he&#39;s doing when it comes to movies like Argylle, but that is no guarantee that it will be successful enough to merit sequels. In fact, Vaughn&#39;s current track record indicates that Arygylle will have to work a bit harder to become a new action franchise.

                  Henry Cavill&#39;s Upcoming Spy Movie Breaks 12-Year Tradition For Kingsman Director   The age rating for Matthew Vaughn’s Argylle has now been revealed, and it breaks a longstanding tradition for the Kingsman franchise director.   


 Matthew Vaughn&#39;s Last Four Movies Have Received Increasingly Worse Reviews 
          




Though Matthew Vaughn has been at the helm of some very popular action movies, his most recent releases have not had the easiest time with critics and audiences. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the last four films that Vaughn has directed have done increasingly worse. In 2011, X-Men: First Class received an 86% Certified Fresh rating and in 2014, Kingsman: The Secret Service earned a 75%, also Certified Fresh. However, things started to decline when 2017&#39;s Kingsman: The Golden Circle earned a 50% critics score, and later, 2021&#39;s The King&#39;s Man earned a 40%. Ultimately, this is a trend that is quite uncomfortable for the director.

Although Argylle is an entirely new film that exists apart from Vaughn&#39;s previous work, there is still a chance that it could follow in its predecessors&#39; footsteps and receive an increasingly bad rating. This is bad for obvious reasons, but especially because it would continue Matthew Vaughn&#39;s bad Rotten Tomatoes streak. If Argylle does not do well with critics, this could seriously affect the future of the film. While past Matthew Vaughn films have readily received sequels, that may not be the case when it comes to Argylle. 






 Argylle Needs Strong Reviews If It Is Going To Launch A Franchise 
         

In the end, if Argylle is going to become a franchise like Kingsman or X-Men, then it is going to have to earn much better reviews than Vaughn&#39;s previous two films. Movie executives need to know that Argylle will not fall off the map the way that the last two Kingsman movies did, and instead, will maintain good scores with both critics and audiences. If Argylle does get good reviews, there is a strong possibility that it will spawn at least one sequel, which will officially end Matthew Vaughn&#39;s 13-year bad streak, and bring him back onto the successful action franchise train.
