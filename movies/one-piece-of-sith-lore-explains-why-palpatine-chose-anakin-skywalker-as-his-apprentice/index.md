# One Piece Of Sith Lore Explains Why Palpatine Chose Anakin Skywalker As His Apprentice


## SUMMARY 



  Palpatine risked revealing his true nature to Anakin because he couldn&#39;t risk Anakin fighting against him as the Chosen One.   The Sith believe in imposing their own will on the Force, unlike the Jedi who honor its will.   In the end, the will of the Force triumphed through the actions of Luke and Anakin Skywalker, but maintaining balance remains a challenge.

## Literature Review

This obscure piece of Sith lore explains why Palpatine fought so hard to turn Anakin Skywalker to the dark side and make Anakin his apprentice.




One Sith lore detail in Star Wars explains why Sheev Palpatine fought so hard to make Anakin Skywalker his apprentice. Palpatine, the infamous Sith Lord who has long since been Star Wars&#39; main villain, poured a considerable amount of effort into turning Anakin Skywalker to the dark side. It feels strange that Palpatine would spend so much time trying to convince Anakin to join the dark side. After all, as an exceptionally powerful Jedi, Anakin could&#39;ve been a real threat to Palpatine&#39;s plans if he had reported him to the Jedi. However, as it turns out, Star Wars explained why Palpatine did this ten years ago.




Even before Palpatine convinced Anakin to kill Mace Windu, he was dropping risky hints of his true nature to Anakin. For example, in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith, Palpatine tells Anakin about how he killed his Sith Master and speaks about the dark side as a means to an end. Even though he framed his story as a legend he&#39;d heard, this was still an extreme risk. If Anakin had paid better attention, he would&#39;ve realized right there that Palpatine was the Sith Lord. However, Star Wars has made it clear there was a good reason why he took this risk.

 Palpatine&#39;s Sith Lessons Show Why He Decided To Turn Anakin Skywalker 
          




In Darth Maul: Son of Dathomir, Darth Maul states, &#34;There is a purpose for everything in the galaxy... and a way to destroy it.&#34; In other words, the Force has a will, and it&#39;s possible to do things that foil that will. Palpatine commends Maul on remembering his lessons, confirming this is a Sith saying. Unlike the Jedi who believe in honoring the will of the Force, the Sith value imposing their own will on it.



There is a purpose for everything in the galaxy... and a way to destroy it.




This quote explains why Palpatine spent years grooming Anakin to become a Sith. Since Anakin was the Chosen One, he was destined to fight Palpatine&#39;s forces. If Anakin had fought against Palpatine rather than with him, there was a chance that the will of the Force would be fulfilled. Palpatine couldn&#39;t risk that. Palpatine was a master manipulator, and he mapped out his Clone Wars plan meticulously. Anakin was one of the biggest threats to his plans for galactic domination, so he found a way to use Anakin to his advantage.






 The Will Of The Force Triumphed In The End 
          

Palpatine sought to upset the balance of the Force by hunting down and destroying as many agents of the light side as he could. For a while, this worked. Despite his best efforts, however, the will of the Force was ultimately victorious. Luke Skywalker&#39;s love and compassion for his father forged the path for his father to turn back to the light side. When Darth Vader killed Palpatine, he overthrew the reign of the dark side. When Luke brought back the Jedi Order, he restored balance. Through the combination of Anakin and Luke Skywalker, the Force triumphed.

Unfortunately, Luke and Anakin Skywalker were not able to maintain this balance. Because Anakin died immediately after saving his son and Luke&#39;s Jedi Order ultimately failed, the dark side was able to take control again. However, with the defeat of Palpatine&#39;s clone and the First Order, as well as Rey rebuilding the Jedi Order, it appears the Force isn&#39;t going down without a fight. It will be interesting to see if Rey&#39;s Jedi Order succeeds. If it does, it will prove that the Force in Star Wars is far more persistent than Palpatine hoped.
