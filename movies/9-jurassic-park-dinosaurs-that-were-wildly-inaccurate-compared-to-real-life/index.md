# 9 Jurassic Park Dinosaurs That Were Wildly Inaccurate Compared To Real Life


## SUMMARY 


 Not all of the dinosaur designs in the Jurassic Park franchise are scientifically accurate in terms of their physiologies and appearances. 
 The depiction of the T-Rex&#39;s sight in the films is based on a falsehood; paleontologists believe that the T-Rex could see objects and animals whether they were moving or not. 
 Many of the inaccuracies in the dinosaur designs can be attributed to the limited knowledge scientists had about certain species at the time of the movie&#39;s release.

## Literature Review

The Jurassic Park movies yielded some amazing visuals, but some of its dinosaurs were quite different from their real-life counterparts.




Movies in the Jurassic Park franchise have yielded some amazing visuals over the years, but some of their dinosaur designs differ greatly from their real-life counterparts. One of the greatest appeals of the six Jurassic Park movies - specifically the original film - is that the &#34;monsters&#34; chasing its main characters are animals that actually existed at one point in time. The franchise took great pains to recreate a multitude of dinosaur species that roamed the Earth millions of years ago in live-action.
These efforts, which have often paid off immensely, have helped build Jurassic Park into a $6 billion franchise comprised of six films. But while many of its reptilian creatures closely resemble how general audiences would imagine them to have looked, not all of them are scientifically correct in terms of their physiologies and appearances. Whether it be because scientists learned additional details about the dinosaurs after a movie&#39;s release, or liberties were taken on purpose, Jurassic Park boasts a number of inaccurate dinosaurs.









 








 10  Pyroraptor 
        

With the Pyroraptor, Jurassic World Dominion invented a surprising ability for the dinosaur species. A scene in the movie saw the human characters realize, much to their own fright, that Pyroraptors can swim. It was shown swimming underneath the ice at a fast speed. Interestingly, there&#39;s nothing known about the Pyoraptor that supports the notion of it having this capability. What&#39;s more, its swimming ability is so impressive that the Pyroraptor is almost treated as an aquatic dinosaur, which it certainly wasn&#39;t. One aspect of it that has been deemed accurate, though, is its feathers, something that was lost in the translation for several Jurassic Park dinosaur species.





 9  Tyrannosaurus Rex 
        

Visually, at least, the Jurassic Park films have done well to convey the physical might and dominance of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. However, there&#39;s one glaring issue with its depiction: in both the book and the movie, it&#39;s established that the T-Rex&#39;s sight is so bad that it can only see things that are moving. This detail is key to how the characters deal with the creature, yet it&#39;s not based in fact. Paleontologists have concluded in the past that not only could the T-Rex see objects and animals whether they&#39;re moving or not, but its vision was probably similar to a hawk&#39;s [via IFL Science.]





 8  Spinosaurus 
        

The Spinosarus, the primary threat in Jurassic Park III, was quite dissimilar to the real-life dinosaur. Its hind legs were too large and its neck was too long. Not only that, but the Spinosaurus had a lifestyle akin to an alligator, meaning that it spent much of its time in rivers, feeding on aquatic life. Jurassic Park III&#39;s Spinosaurus, on the other hand, was shown to be nothing more than another land predator. These inaccuracies are largely the result of the timing of the movie&#39;s release. In 2001, there was a lot that scientists still didn&#39;t know about the Spinosaurus. It would appear that much of what was in Jurassic Park III regarding the Spinosaurus was reliant on conjecture, not evidence.

 6  Velociraptor 
        

One of the most commonly used dinosaurs in the franchise, Jurassic Park&#39;s Velociraptor looked completely different from the real dinosaur before getting a more accurate redesign in the Jurassic World movies. Before the reboot, the Velociraptor was significantly larger than the real thing, its head shape was off, and it severely lacked feathers. The number of inaccuracies with its look in Jurassic Park can be attributed to the Velociraptor being based on the Deinonychus, a different dinosaur species.





 5  Mosasaur 
        

Appearing in the Jurassic World trilogy, the Mosasaur is regarded as the apex predator of the sea. Just how dangerous it truly is was on display when it ate the Indominus Rex in Jurassic World. But though its strength and dominance in its ecosystem should not be underestimated, it&#39;s also worth noting that the real-life Mosasaur wasn&#39;t anywhere close to the size of the creature depicted in the movies. Its size was exaggerated, possibly to further enhance the marine animal&#39;s menacing image.





 4  Ankylosaurus 
        

Recognized for its back spikes and ball at the end of its tail, the Ankylosaurus has a popular place in pop culture, traditionally seen as a creature capable of contending with Tyrannosaurus Rex, regardless of its herbivorous nature. With its take on the Ankylosaurus, Jurassic World kept this particular image of the dinosaur but offered its own take on its appearance. What it wound up creating was a design that included spikes on the sides of its body and shell-like armor, neither of which being features the real dinosaur possessed. Plus, the Jurassic World Ankylosaurus was a bit larger than he was supposed to be.





 3  Pteranodon 
        

Like several other high-profile creatures in the movies, the Pteranodon was also subject to various changes. Despite the Pteranodon being the most famous dinosaur in history, Jurassic Park III was willing to make considerable alterations, including the addition of teeth. Real-life Pteranodons ate fish, but swallowed them whole, as they didn&#39;t have teeth. In contrast, the vicious Pteranodons were threatening even to humans due to their sharp teeth. Plus, they could carry people off into the air, a feat real Pteranodons couldn&#39;t have accomplished with their small feet.





 2  Baryonyx 
        

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom unveiled the Baryonyx, a fish-eating dinosaur that used its claws to scrounge for prey in rivers during the Cretaceous period. Curiously, the Baryonyx had a snout that likened him to a crocodile or an alligator, whereas the real Baryonx had a comparably thinner snout. It had an almost monstrous look that took away from its resemblance to the actual Baryonyx. The next movie, however, Jurassic World Dominion, went with a Baryonyx design that was notably closer to the dinosaur&#39;s real-life appearance.





 1  Dilophosaurus 
        

Out of all the dinosaurs to undergo massive changes for their live-action portrayals, none stand out more than the Dilophosaurus in Jurassic Park. The Dilophosaurus is remembered as the acid-spitting creature with the frill on its neck. The spreading of the frill when it prepared to use its spit attack is the Dilophosaur&#39;s most distinguishing feature in the movie - as well as a complete invention of the film. In real life, the Dilophosaurus didn&#39;t possess a frill, nor could it spit any form of poison from its mouth. All things considered, the Dilophosaurus in Jurassic Park was nearly an original dinosaur.
