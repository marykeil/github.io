## Literature Review

Disney has some of the best villains in animation history, but the Disney villains ranked shows that some are more dastardly than others.




The Disney villains ranked include a mix of purely evil individuals and some misunderstood antagonists who were mostly guilty of just making poor decisions. From the time that Disney started making animated releases with Steamboat Willy and Mickey Mouse, there have been villains opposing them. However, thanks to the feature films, starting with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the villains were sometimes more colorful and entertaining than the heroes. It was the villains that could do really dramatic things and made most of the animated movies worth rewatching over and over again.

The best Disney villains ranked include hunters and poachers, witches and sorcerers, and gods and monsters. However, they also include neglected toys, fathers whose children died tragically, and spurned lovers who want revenge against those that rejected them. There are so many different types of villains in Disney animated movies that it seems nothing new can come along, but Disney always surprises fans by bringing a new bad guy that is even bigger and better than the last. With that said, the classics are still among the best, and the Disney villains have proven to maintain their status as some of the deadliest in movies, animated or otherwise.
Disney&#39;s animated catalog is available to stream on Disney&#43;. 










 








 46  Amos Slade 
The Fox And The Hound (1981)
        

In The Fox and the Hound, Amos Slade is really just a hunter but one of the key traits of Disney Animation is humanizing animals. &#34;Man&#34; was the ultimate villain in Bambi for killing the fawn&#39;s mother. Here, Amos wants to kill Tod the fox, and since Tod is a hero in the movie, that makes Amos a villain in contrast. However, he shows kindness and love for his dog by not killing the fox when he realizes they are friends. He&#39;s easily the nicest of all the Disney villains ranked.





 45  Sid 
Toy Story (1995)


 







  Toy Story  


  Director    John Lasseter     Cast    Tom Hanks , Don Rickles , Annie Potts , Tim Allen , Jim Varney     Rating    G     Runtime    81 minutes    


Sid Phillips is the villain in Toy Story. However, this is a huge problem when it comes to Sid. He isn&#39;t a villain. He is a young boy who likes to take apart his toys and then rebuild them into monstrous creations. He is more of a creative little boy than a villain. There is no way he could have known that the toys he&#39;s mutilating are living creatures. While he may seem like a serial killer-in-training, Sid was just a boy who ended up traumatized when all his prized toys came to life and surrounded him. He was a victim more than he was a villain.





 44  Si &amp; Am 
The Lady And The Tramp (1955)
        

There are problems in early Disney movies, and a perfect example is the troublesome Siamese cats and their racially insensitive song in Lady and the Tramp. The villain in this movie is either these sneaky cats or their owner, Aunt Sarah, who traumatize Lady and send her out of the house where she ends up meeting Tramp. In the movie, Si and Am are hardly villains, just mischievous troublemakers. Aunt Sarah is worse, but none of them are pure evil compared to other Disney villains ranked.





 43  Edgar Balthazar 
The Aristocats (1970)
        

Edgar Balthazar is the loyal butler in The Aristocats to millionaire Madame Bonfamilile. However, he becomes the villain of this Disney movie when he learns that she plans to leave all her fortune to her kittens. However, while he is a villain, his only purely evil move was shipping them to Timbuktu. He proved to be a better person than someone like Cruella De Vil because he wouldn&#39;t kill them, but he remains more known for his clumsiness than his villainy. In the end, the kittens beat him, making him an ineffective member of the Disney villains ranked.





 42  The Big Bad Wolf 
The Three Little Pigs (1933)
        

The Big Bad Wolf is the villain in the Silly Symphonies short movie The Three Little Pigs. He is ruthless and conniving, and he is successful at first when he finds piggies&#39; houses that are made of straw and sticks by just huffing and puffing and blowing them down. However, when he reaches the house made of bricks, and he can&#39;t blow it down, he tries to get them in another way - the chimney. Sadly for the wolf, he loses his pants, lands in a pot of boiling water, and runs off, defeated by the pigs. Clearly, he couldn&#39;t beat the pigs and relied too much on his breath to be a true threat compared to the Disney villains ranked.

 41  Honest John &amp; Gideon 
Pinocchio (1940)
        

The real villain in Pinocchio was the hero himself, who wanted to be a real boy but made some bad decisions in his life that caused him to face a dark fate. However, young Pinocchio wasn&#39;t alone in falling into temptation. Honest John and Gideon were con artists who often swindled people through their smooth talking. When it came to Pinocchio, they convinced him to go to Pleasure Island, which was where bad boys were turned into donkeys. They were bad, but they were just whispering in Pinocchio&#39;s ear and weren&#39;t as bad as other Disney villains ranked.





 40  Evil Ralph 
Ralph Breaks The Internet (2018)
        

  Ralph Breaks the Internet  


  Director    Rich Moore , Phil Johnston     Cast    John C. Reilly , Sarah Silverman , Alan Tudyk , Jane Lynch , Ed O&#39;Neill , Taraji P. Henson , Jack McBrayer , Gal Gadot     Rating    PG     Runtime    112 Minutes    


In Wreck-It Ralph, the likable Ralph was supposed to be a classic video game villain, but he wanted to be a hero. He proved himself and became a hero in that first movie, but then something happened in Ralph Breaks the Internet. The hero then turned into a villain. It wasn&#39;t actually Ralph himself that became a villain, but his insecurity created his doppelganger that grew to an enormous size and threatened to destroy everything when Ralph believed Vanellope decided she wanted to move away. It took the real Ralph trusting his friend and letting her go for the Evil Ralph to fall.





 39  Gabby Gabby 
Toy Story 4 (2019)
        

  Toy Story 4  


  Director    Josh Cooley     Cast    Patricia Arquette , Tim Allen , Kristen Schaal , Estelle Harris , Jodi Benson , Tony Hale , Blake Clark , Jeff Pidgeon , Joan Cusack , Laurie Metcalf , Tom Hanks , Annie Potts , Jeff Garlin , Bonnie Hunt , Wallace Shawn     Rating    G     Runtime    1h 40m    


Gabby Gabby took on a familiar role in Toy Story movies as someone who pretended to be a friend before revealing herself as the villain. However, she had the most sympathetic story of any villain in the series. She was a doll who wanted more than anything to have a girl named Harmony adopt her but her voice box was broken and this caused her to remain a misfit toy. Her goal was to steal Woody&#39;s voice box, making her a dangerous villain. However, she ends up turning good in the end and received her own happy end when a girl accepted her as she was, finally giving her what she wanted her entire life.





 38  Te Kā 
Moana (2016)


 







  Moana  


  Director    Ron Clements , John Musker     Cast    Dwayne Johnson , Temuera Morrison , Auli&#39;i Cravalho , Rachel House , Nicole Scherzinger , Alan Tudyk , Jemaine Clement     Rating    PG     Runtime    1h 47m    


Te Kā may be a brutal volcano demon in Moana, but she&#39;s hardly diabolical and calculating. However, for much of the movie, she did everything in her power to destroy everything. She sent out a force that killed all plant life, destroying kingdoms across the seas. With that said, Maui stole her heart, and when Moana returned it to her, Te Kā turned back into her serene alter-ego, Te Fiti, and reversed her damage to the planet.





 37  Madame Medusa 
The Rescuers (1977)
        

Madame Medusa was the main villain in the movie The Rescuers. She&#39;s obsessed with diamonds, particularly the Devil&#39;s Eye, and that makes her do some pretty underhanded things. She is obsessive and greedy and would do anything to get more diamonds, including kidnapping the orphan girl, Penny. She proved how despicable she was when she left Penny to possibly drown and even shot a gun at the young girl. However, the Rescuers saved Penny and left Medusa at the mercy of the crocodiles, Brutus and Nero.

 36  Ercole Visconti 
Luca (2021)
        

  Luca  


  Director    Enrico Casarosa     Cast    Emma Berman , Maya Rudolph , Jack Dylan Grazer , Jacob Tremblay , Saverio Raimondo , Marco Barricelli , Jim Gaffigan     Rating    PG     Runtime    1h 35m    


At the end of the day, Ercole Visconti is a bully - pure and simple. In Luca, Ercole is a 16-year-old who is a repeat champion in the Portorosso Cup race since he owns a great Vespa and has no problem letting people know how great he is. However, he is also a cheater and believes he can cut corners to win, no matter what underhanded tactics he attempts. When he decided to expose Luca as a sea monster, putting the boy&#39;s life in danger, he stepped over the line. However, he was still just a spoiled teen and not a full-fledged villain.





 35  Prince John 
Robin Hood (1973)


 







In the Disney Animation version of the story of Robin Hood, the movie saw Prince John (a lion) usurping the throne from his brother King Richard. He then finds a thorn in his side from Robin Hood (a fox). Litt John (a bear), and Maid Marion (another fox). In this movie, the Sheriff of Nottingham (a wolf) is a more active villain, fighting Robin Hood and his Merry Men, but the main villain is Prince John. However, his anger issues and inability to maintain a plan caused his downfall and eventual fall when Richard returned.





 34  Stinky Pete 
Toy Story 2 (1999)
        

  Toy Story 2  


  Director    Lee Unkrich , Ash Brannon , John Lasseter     Cast    Tim Allen , Tom Hanks , Joan Cusack , Annie Potts , Kelsey Grammer     Rating    G     Runtime    92 minutes    


The first Toy Story movie had a misunderstood villain in Sid, but the second movie had a true bad guy in Stinky Pete. Any man, woman, or toy who wants to take Woody away from Andy is a bad guy in the Pixar franchise, but Stinky Pete has a sympathetic backstory making him more than just a basic villain. He spent his entire life in a box, never knowing the love of a child. However, this turned him into a bitter old toy, and he betrayed Woody, Jessie, and Bullseye, who trusted him, and that made him more of a villain than Sid before him, concerning Disney villains ranked.





 33  Madam Mim 
The Sword In The Stone (1963)
        

  The Sword in the Stone  


  Director    Wolfgang Reitherman     Cast    Rickie Sorensen , Karl Swenson , Junius Matthews , Sebastian Cabot , Norman Alden , Martha Wentworth     Rating    G     Runtime    79 Minutes    


In The Sword and the Stone, Madam Mim is a wicked witch who loves seeing others in misery. Though she has formidable powers, Madam Mim&#39;s downfall is her own arrogance. Mimi believes that she is the most powerful wizard in history, but she soon learns there is always someone stronger out there. Merlin easily outsmarts her in the &#34;Wizards&#39; Duel.&#34; She ended up more like an annoying child who cheats at everything, and that holds her down when it comes to the Disney villains ranked.





 32  Screenslaver 
Incredibles 2 (2018)
        

  The Incredibles 2  


  Director    Brad Bird     Cast    Sarah Vowell , Samuel L. Jackson , Holly Hunter , Craig T. Nelson , John Ratzenberger , Catherine Keener , Huck Milner , Bob Odenkirk     Rating    PG     Runtime    2h 6m    


Screenslaver (aka Evelyn Deavor), has an ax to grind against superheroes, and plots to have them rendered illegal. What she does as a result in Incredibles 2 shows how evil she is as she set up some bombs, and put a lot of people&#39;s lives in danger. She proved her real power when she mind-controlled the Supers, including Helen, Bob, and Lucas, and then set the other mind-controlled Supers out to beat them. However, unlike Syndrome before her, she couldn&#39;t really stay in the fight when Elastigirl caught up with her.





 31  Peg Leg Pete 
Mickey Mouse Series (1925- )
        

Peg Leg Pete deserves respect when looking at the Disney villains ranked because he was the original Disney villain. He&#39;s best known for repeatedly abducting Minnie Mouse over the years. Over time, Peg Leg Pete&#39;s villainy would lessen, as seen in Goof Troop and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. And for this reason, he is not as bad as other villains but was still a thorn in Mickey&#39;s side for a very long time.





 30  Namaari 
Raya And the Last Dragon (2021)


 







  Raya and the Last Dragon  


  Director    Carlos López Estrada , Don Hall     Cast    Awkwafina , Kelly Marie Tran , Thalia Tran , Daniel Dae Kim , Alan Tudyk , Izaac Wang , Ross Butler , Patti Harrison , Gemma Chan , Sandra Oh , Benedict Wong , Lucille Soong     Rating    PG     Runtime    112 minutes    


Namaari is another one of the tragic Disney villains and was a true threat in Raya and the Last Dragon. She was the daughter of Chief Virana and is the princess of Kumandra&#39;s Fang. She has always envied Heart&#39;s prosperity and believes that her land deserves the source of power from the Dragon Gem. However, while she wanted to help her kingdom, the lengths she went to for this goal made her a dangerous villain, and someone who hurt more people than she had a chance to help. It was Namaari that helped release the Druun, and she eventually sacrificed herself to help Raya defeat the Druun, rehabilitating her in the end.





 29  Robert Callaghan 
Big Hero 6 (2014)
        

  Big Hero 6  


  Director    Don Hall , Chris Williams     Cast    Ryan Potter , Scott Adsit , Jamie Chung , T.J. Miller , Daniel Henney , Damon Wayans Jr. , Genesis Rodriguez , James Cromwell , Alan Tudyk , Maya Rudolph     Rating    PG     Runtime    1h 42m    


Before Spider-Man got a theatrical animated movie, Disney brought Marvel&#39;s Big Hero 6 to theaters. This was an origin story about how Hiro Hanada became a hero and started a team of tech-based superheroes known as Big Hero 6. However, the villain here was one of Marvel&#39;s tragic characters. Robert Callaghan was a robotics professor who mentored Hiro&#39;s bother Tadashi. However, when he set a fire that killed Tadashi, it set Hiro on his hero&#39;s journey and made Callaghan a hated villain. Sadly, he became a villain because he lost his daughter and wanted to find a way to bring her back.

 28  Ratigan 
The Great Mouse Detective (1986)
        

Ratigan was the main villain in The Great Mouse Detective, a suave and dangerous crimelord. He is the main nemesis of Basil of Baker Street and his entire goal is to control all of Mousedom. He is based on a diabolical villain in Sherlock Holmes villain, James Moriarty. He has a great reputation coming into the movie as the world&#39;s greatest criminal mastermind, which helps him compare well with the Holmes character of Basil (the Great Mouse Detective of the title). He gets added points in the list of Disney villains ranked because he owns a cat that commits murders for him.





 27  Bill Sykes 
Oliver &amp; Company (1988)
        

Bill Sykes is a vicious loan shark in Oliver &amp; Company who tortures and kills, but most of his violence occurs offscreen. This is a Disney animated remake of Charles Dickens&#39;s Oliver Twist and Sykes is the villain in both versions. He lives in the shadows and is brutal and cruel, often sending his two Dobermans, Roscoe and DeSoto, to eliminate his enemies. He showed his true villainy when these two loyal dogs died, and he never seemed to show that he even cared. He is also one of the few Disney villains ranked who actually die in the end.
