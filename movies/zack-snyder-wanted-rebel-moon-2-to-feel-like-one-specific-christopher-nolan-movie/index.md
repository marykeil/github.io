## Literature Review

Rebel Moon star Ed Skrein says director Zack Snyder wanted Part Two: The Scargiver to feel like a very specific Christopher Nolan movie.




Actor Ed Skrein has revealed that Zack Snyder wanted Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver to feel like a particular, critically-acclaimed Christopher Nolan movie. The two-part sci-fi film follows former Imperium soldier Kora gathering a group of fighters to defend the moon Veldt from her former intergalactic empire. Part One - A Child of Fire was just the start, establishing the world while setting up the sequel.




Speaking with GamesRadar&#43;, Skrein, who portrays Admiral Noble, revealed the upcoming Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver was inspired by Nolan&#39;s Dunkirk. The actor went on to compare the follow-up to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, citing how action-packed the film will be. Check out what Skrein had to say below:


I remember Zack saying with the second movie that he wanted it to feel like Dunkirk. So it&#39;s like, there&#39;s a space at the beginning, and then it&#39;s going off. And it&#39;s really, really going off. And, you know, Return of the King, Lord of the Rings vibes where it&#39;s like, &#39;Okay, we kind of know where they&#39;re going.&#39; It&#39;s like, &#39;Alright, now let&#39;s just sit back, eat loads of popcorn, and watch it all kickoff.&#39;



 What Zack Snyder&#39;s Dunkirk Comparison Means For The Scargiver 
          




Dunkirk is considered one of Nolan&#39;s greatest films, showcasing World War II&#39;s evacuation from the film&#39;s namesake through the eyes of multiple soldiers. Since The Scargiver will be finishing the story of Veldt&#39;s defense, there will no doubt be plenty of action from a multitude of perspectives. A similar structure to the war film could work in favor of Rebel Moon&#39;s second half, delivering a thrilling conclusion to the story.

Given that A Child of Fire reviews weren&#39;t favorable, the next movie may be able to redeem many elements from the first. This would have to include an increased focus on characterization, connecting audiences to the film&#39;s heroes to make the battles more exciting. It will likely feature a much grander scale to its events as well, reflecting the destructive nature of war while also providing an action-packed thrill ride.

                  Rebel Moon&#39;s Budget Explained: How Much Netflix&#39;s Two-Part Movie Cost To Make   Zack Snyder and Netflix invested a lot of time and money into the two-part epic space opera, Rebel Moon. Read on for the budget for the two films.   




Beyond Nolan&#39;s movies, Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver will continue to pull from sources like Star Wars and The Seven Samurai in finishing its story. This mash-up of multiple types of films wasn&#39;t a big hit for A Child of Fire, but the change in focus toward battles in the next movie could give it a warmer reception. It remains to be seen just how much the film pulls from Dunkirk, and how different its presentation may be from the first film.



Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver will arrive on Netflix April 19, 2024.
