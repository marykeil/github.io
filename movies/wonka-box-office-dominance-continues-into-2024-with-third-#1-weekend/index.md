## Literature Review

Wonka takes No. 1 at the domestic box office for its third weekend, beating the weekend&#39;s new wide release and multiple holiday titles.




Wonka has topped the box office charts once again. The movie musical is a prequel to the 1971 Roald Dahl adaptation Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring TimothÃ©e Chalamet as a younger version of Gene Wilder&#39;s titular chocolatier. The movie opened two weekends before Christmas in 2023, taking No. 1 during its debut and dipping down to No. 2 below Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom for the Christmas weekend before rising back up to the top over the New Year&#39;s holiday.




Per Deadline, the Wonka box office is projected to add an additional $15.5 million to its domestic gross during its fourth weekend in North American theaters. This should be more than enough for the movie to claim the No. 1 spot for the weekend for the third time in a row. In second place is the new horror movie Night Swim, which is only projected to earn about $12.5 million.


 How Long Will Wonka Reign Supreme? 
          

The success of the Wonka release can be attributed to quite a few different factors. The first is that the movie is a bona fide phenomenon, quickly surpassing the $300 million milestone worldwide to become the 14th highest-grossing 2023 movie so far. However, its continual chart-topping is also partially due to the underwhelming box office receipts of some of its competition, in spite of the fact that seven major wide releases hit theaters during the Christmas holiday weekend.






Aquaman 2, Migration, The Iron Claw, and Anyone But You were released the Friday before Christmas, and The Color Purple, Ferrari, and The Boys in the Boat opened on Christmas Day.




Wonka continuing to take No. 1 during this first weekend of 2024 is also partly due to the underwhelming gross of Night Swim rather than its own commercial might. While the Blumhouse horror movie could have followed the example of their previous January movie M3GAN and become a smash hit, its poor reviews may have put a damper on its potential. Ultimately, while it seems likely that the Wonka movie will keep pulling in consistent grosses without huge drops, it remains to be seen if it can continue its streak at No. 1.

The first major challenge for Wonka&#39;s 2024 run will come next weekend, with the simultaneous release of the musical Mean Girls and the Jason Statham actioner The Beekeeper. While it&#39;s possible that neither movie will gross much higher than Night Swim, their combined presence will increase the theatrical competition twofold. However, it Wonka holds out and claims No. 1 during that weekend, it could potentially keep its streak going through the end of January, as the final two weekends of the month have a sparse slate of major releases.
