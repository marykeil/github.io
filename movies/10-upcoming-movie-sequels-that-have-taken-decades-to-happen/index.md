## Literature Review
Hollywood&#39;s biggest studios are constantly competing for the next big title. In some cases, that means making sequels for decades-old movies.




The 2020s have already seen the return of major franchises like Avatar and Top Gun, and many more long-awaited sequels are still on the way. Given the surge of franchise movies in the 2010s, it became increasingly difficult to get audiences to theaters without a familiar title until 2023, when the success of Barbie and Oppenheimer proved a desire for original stories. While that might spark studios to develop more standalone projects, many sequels, spin-offs, and reboots are already underway.
Some upcoming sequels are shocking, given that the original films are decades old. Movies from the 1990s and the 2000s, many of which were long thought to be standalone classics, are finally seeing follow-ups in the next few years. These sequels are in varying stages of production, with some set for release in 2024 and others still developing scripts, assembling casts, or waiting for time to open up on the schedule.

 10 Upcoming Remakes That Have Strong Chances At Winning Over Concerned Fans 
In a world of reboots, sequels, and spin-offs, movie fans are rightfully skeptical of remakes. However, these upcoming releases may win over fans.













 








 10  Beetlejuice 2 


Close







 Beetlejuice 2 

 Release Date   September 6, 2024    Director   Tim Burton    Cast   Michael Keaton , Jenna Ortega , Winona Ryder , Monica Bellucci , Willem Dafoe , Justin Theroux , Catherine O&#39;Hara    Genres   Comedy , Supernatural    




Beetlejuice 2 will be released 36 years after the beloved original, with Tim Burton returning to direct the sequel and Michael Keaton reprising his role as the titular character. The original is an essential 1980s movie, launching Burton&#39;s career as one of the most unique commercial filmmakers ever. Winona Ryder will also return for the 2024 follow-up, with Wednesday star Jenna Ortega starring as her daughter. The Beetlejuice 2 cast will also feature Monica Bellucci, Willem Dafoe, Justin Theroux, and Catherine O&#39;Hara.





 9  Twisters 
A Twister sequel releases in the Summer of 2024.
        

 Twisters 

 Release Date   July 19, 2024    Director   Lee Isaac Chung    Cast   Daisy Edgar-Jones , Glen Powell , Anthony Ramos , Brandon Perea , Daryl McCormack    




The 1996 Twister film is one of the best disaster movies ever, placing high expectations on the 2024 follow-up. Disaster movies aren&#39;t as popular as in the 20th century, making it an interesting time for a reboot, but the film has an intriguing cast and filmmaker. Minari director Lee Isaac Chung is at the helm of Twisters, with Daisy Edgar-Jones and Glen Powell headlining the cast. None of the original cast will return for the film, but it&#39;s still being considered a sequel to the original cult classic and could be a surprise Summer 2024 hit.





 8  Gladiator 2 
Ridley Scott is finally returning to Gladiator with Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington.

 Gladiator 2 

 Release Date   November 22, 2024    Director   Ridley Scott    Cast   Paul Mescal , Denzel Washington , Connie Nielsen , Derek Jacobi , Djimon Hounsou , Joseph Quinn , Fred Hechinger , Pedro Pascal    




A sequel to Gladiator has been discussed for ages, with musician Nick Cave even proposing a Gladiator 2 script years ago. The primary issue in following up Ridley Scott&#39;s Roman Coliseum classic is that Maximus&#39; life ended after vanquishing his enemy in the original film. However, Scott finally landed on a sequel idea, with Paul Mescal playing the grown version of Lucius, Lucilla&#39;s son. The cast, which also stars Denzel Washington, Joseph Quinn, and Pedro Pascal, could make the sequel a massive hit despite arriving 24 years after the original. Hopefully, it will be a return to form for the director, whose latest films have received mixed reviews.





 7  Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley 
Beverly Hills Cop 4 will release on Netflix in 2024.
        

 Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F 

 Director   Mark Molloy    Cast   Eddie Murphy , Kevin Bacon , John Ashton    Rating   R    Genres   Action , Comedy    




After Spy Kids in 2023, Netflix will resurrect another movie franchise with Beverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley, releasing in the Summer of 2024. Eddie Murphy has been working with Netflix for years on movies like Dolemite Is My Name and You People, but a Beverly Hills Cop sequel could be his biggest movie in years if it captures some of the original saga&#39;s charm. The movie will be released four decades after the original and three decades after the most recent, with stars Judge Reinhold and John Ashton also set to return.





 6  Heat 2 
Michael Mann confirmed he&#39;s planning to begin shooting Heat 2.
        

 Heat 2 

 Cast   Adam Driver    




Heat never seemed like the type of film to have a sequel, nor Michael Mann a director who would be interested in making one. The crime epic stuck with Mann, though, as he co-wrote the novel for Heat 2 and is now adapting it into a feature film. The novel is a sequel and prequel, with flashback scenes showing younger versions of the original characters. Adam Driver is rumored to play the young version of Robert De Niro&#39;s Neil McCauley, though when discussing the film on the press tour for Ferrari, Mann expressed that they hadn&#39;t gotten to casting yet.





 5  Karate Kid 
Cobra Kai proved that another Karate Kid movie is worth it.
        

After a series of films in the 1980s, the Karate Kid franchise struggled to find success for decades until Netflix&#39;s Cobra Kai series brought an original, refreshing flair to the characters. With Ralph Macchio back as Daniel LaRusso, a new movie is set to combine elements of the original Karate Kid films with aspects of Cobra Kai that have made it so popular. Not including the rebooted 2010 version, the upcoming Karate Kid will be the first sequel in thirty years. Jackie Chan has also been excitedly announced as a star in the movie.

 10 Recent Movies That Were Bigger At The Box Office Than Anyone Expected 
The only predictable thing about the box office is that it&#39;s unpredictable. These recent movies became smash hits seemingly out of nowhere.









 4  Sherlock Holmes 3 
Sherlock Holmes 3 is a priority for Robert Downey Jr.
        

 Sherlock Holmes 3 

 Release Date   December 22, 2021    Director   Guy Ritchie    Cast   Robert Downey Jr. , Jude Law    




Just after kicking off the MCU with Iron Man, Robert Downey Jr. starred as another iconic character in Guy Ritchie&#39;s Sherlock Holmes movies. For most of the decade, Downey focused entirely on his Marvel roles, and the Sherlock Holmes series was put on pause after two films. A follow-up has been discussed for years, and while there&#39;s still no Sherlock Holmes 3 confirmation just yet, Susan Downey explained that a sequel is a priority for Robert Downey Jr., saying, &#34;We&#39;re going to do it when it&#39;s right, with the right people&#34; (via FortressOfSolitude).





 3  Dodgeball 2 
Vince Vaughn is finally producing a Dodgeball sequel.
        

It&#39;s common for successful comedy films to have sequels, yet somehow, the 2004 classic Dodgeball never had one. A Dodgeball 2 was confirmed by Deadline in April 2023, 10 years after the idea was initially planned. The film&#39;s star, Vince Vaughn, is a producer on the sequel, which is still in the early development stages. Given the original movie&#39;s success with random celebrity cameos like Chuck Norris, it will be exciting to see which stars get cast for minor roles in the long-awaited sequel.





 2  Constantine 2 
A Keanu Reeves Constantine sequel is in development.
        

While not the most accurate to the comic book version of the character, Keanu Reeves&#39; Constantine was still a box office hit. Despite its mixed critical reception, a Constantine 2 is in development nearly two decades later, with The Hunger Games director Frances Lawrence expected to return for the project. With James Gunn taking over DC films, Constantine 2 will be an &#34;Elseworlds&#34; story, meaning it won&#39;t be connected to their cinematic universe. The most recent update on the film was in November 2023, meaning production resumed after the strikes.





 1  Shrek 5 
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish teased Shrek 5, which is confirmed to be in development.
        

The last Shrek film was released in 2010, receiving a poor reception compared to other films in the saga. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish saw an exceptional return to form for DreamWorks Animation, demonstrating an exciting new visual style and a tease for a future Shrek film at the end. Cameron Diaz likely won&#39;t return as Fiona, but Shrek 5 is still happening, along with an Eddie Murphy-led spin-off Donkey movie.
