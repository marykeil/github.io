## Literature Review

The Marvel Cinematic Universe has an iconic pantheon of villains, many of whom survived insurmountable injuries, returning in subsequent installments.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe has a pretty loose sense of mortality, but some villains have survived preposterous injuries, only to reappear in subsequent installments. The phenomenon occurs throughout the MCU timeline, reviving fan-favorite characters through various means. Many of these actually have a comic book precedent, while others are rather spurious attempts to undo narratives after characters prove to be incredibly popular.
Marvel Comics is notorious for killing off characters and then returning them in subsequent stories. The MCU has inherited this tactic, along with the malleable definition of mortality. This will likely prove helpful in navigating Jonathan Majors&#39; exit from the franchise, suggesting a previously beloved villain could return in the MCU&#39;s future as the new major antagonist. Indeed, several sterling examples have demonstrated the potential success of this.









 








 10  Kingpin Is Shot Point Blank In The Face 
Hawkeye Season 1, Episode 6, &#34;So This Is Christmas?&#34;


 







  Hawkeye  


  Release Date    November 24, 2021     Cast    Zahn McClarnon , Fra Fee , Brian D&#39;Arcy James , Hailee Steinfield , Alaqua Cox , Vera Farmiga , Jeremy Renner , Tony Dalton     Seasons    1     Franchise    Marvel Cinematic Universe    


The Kingpin made a surprise return in the Disney&#43; miniseries Hawkeye, revealed as the mastermind behind the narrative&#39;s criminal events. Things took a dramatic turn, however, when the villain was confronted by the antihero, Echo. Having orchestrated her father&#39;s death, Echo attempts to assassinate Kingpin by shooting him point-blank in the face. Amazingly, Kingpin survived his death in Hawkeye and returned for the subsequent miniseries Echo. The scene mirrors the Marvel Comics plot, in which the Kingpin ultimately ends up blind. The Kingpin is due to have a profound impact on the MCU&#39;s future, featuring in at least one other upcoming installment.





 9  Red Skull Touches The Tesseract 
Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)


 







  Captain America: The First Avenger  


  Release Date    July 22, 2011     Director    Joe Johnston     Cast    Chris Evans , Hayley Atwell , Hugo Weaving , Sebastian Stan , Tommy Lee Jones , Samuel L. Jackson , Dominic Cooper , Stanley Tucci , Toby Jones     Runtime    124 Minutes    


In Captain America The First Avenger, Red Skull&#39;s fate takes a mysterious turn when he touches the powerful Tesseract. Believed to be the source of ultimate power, the encounter seemingly disintegrates him. However, the Tesseract, an object of cosmic energy, instead transports the Red Skull to Vormir. There, he becomes the keeper of the Soul Stone, an immortal and tormented guardian bound to the stone&#39;s ethereal realm. Red Skull&#39;s survival, concealed for years, is a testament to the Tesseract&#39;s otherworldy abilities, which previously were presumed to have deadly consequences. Instead, Red Skull faced an even worse fate.





 8  Yellowjacket Is &#34;Crushed&#34; 
Ant-Man (2015)
        

  Ant-Man  


  Release Date    July 14, 2015     Director    Peyton Reed     Cast    Paul Rudd , Michael Douglas , Corey Stoll , Evangeline Lilly , Bobby Cannavale , Anthony Mackie     Runtime    117 minutes    


The climactic battle in Ant-Man sees Darren Cross, donning the Yellowjacket suit, engaged in a fierce confrontation with Scott Lang&#39;s eponymous hero. As the conflict unfolds, Scott manipulates Cross&#39;s suit, causing it to malfunction and violently shrink. Yellowjacket is seemingly crushed by his suit, before disappearing into the Quantum Realm. Incredibly, Cross survives and is transformed into the MCU&#39;s MODOK. Cross reappears as MODOK in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania. Having been severely injured in the shrinking process, Cross was deformed and on the verge of death. Bestowed his distinctive armor by Kang the Conqueror, MODOK proffered a surprising reprisal in the guise of the iconic Marvel villain.





 7  Loki Is Stabbed By Kurse 
Thor: The Dark World (2013)
        

  Thor: The Dark World  


  Release Date    November 8, 2013     Director    Alan Taylor     Cast    Tom Hiddleston , Tadanobu Asano , Idris Elba , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Anthony Hopkins , Natalie Portman , Zachary Levi , Christopher Eccleston , Rene Russo , Chris Hemsworth , Ray Stevenson , Stellan Skarsg√•rd , Jaimie Alexander , Kat Dennings     Rating    PG-13    


The MCU&#39;s Loki has cheated death on numerous occasions, but his most surprising occurred in Thor: The Dark World. Changing his allegiances once again, Loki worked with Thor in his battle against Malekith, before being fatally wounded by the monstrous Kurse. The violent and graphic injury appears to serve as a compelling conclusion to the character&#39;s redemption story, and Loki seemingly dies in his brother&#39;s arms in a truly heartbreaking scene. However, Loki survived this encounter and was revealed to be alive during the movie&#39;s final scene. Precisely how Loki survived in The Dark World wasn&#39;t revealed until an episode of Loki, demonstrating Loki&#39;s profound cunning.





 6  Vulture&#39;s Suit Explodes 
Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)


 







  Spider-Man: Homecoming  


  Release Date    July 7, 2017     Director    Jon Watts     Cast    Michael Keaton , Martin Starr , Angourie Rice , Robert Downey Jr. , Marisa Tomei , Bokeem Woodbine , Logan Marshall-Green , Garcelle Beauvais , Michael Mando , Zendaya , Tom Holland , Jon Favreau , Donald Glover , Hannibal Buress     Runtime    133 minutes    


In the gripping final fight sequence in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Adrian Toomes, AKA Vulture, confronts Spider-Man. As the two clash midair, Vulture overloads his high-tech winged suit, causing it to malfunction and explode. Despite Spider-Man&#39;s attempts to save the villain, the Vulture&#39;s suit explodes. However, after the apparent catastrophe, Toomes survives the explosion. The unexpected survival added a thrilling twist to the villain&#39;s fate, who is subsequently imprisoned, but with the knowledge of Spider-Man&#39;s alter ego. The final battle underscores the unpredictability of the MCU and leaves open the potential for a Sinister Six narrative in future Spider-Man movies.





 5  Crossbones Has A Helicarrier Dropped On Him 
Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
 
  Captain America: The Winter Soldier  


  Release Date    April 4, 2014     Director    Joe Russo , Anthony Russo     Cast    Chris Evans , Hayley Atwell , Scarlett Johansson , Samuel L. Jackson , Robert Redford , Anthony Mackie , Cobie Smulders , Frank Grillo , Sebastian Stan     Runtime    136 minutes    


In a riveting moment in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Brock Rumlow is crushed by falling rubble as the SHIELD helicarrier crashes into a building. Rumlow is locked in a fierce battle with Sam Wilson at the time and is unable to outrun the enormous falling vehicle as it tumbles from the sky. Despite this drastic injury, Rumlow is later seen in the hospital recovering from his injuries. Rumlow would subsequently reappear as the villain Crossbones in Captain America: Civil War. Scarred from his previous encounter, Crossbones&#39; survival is one of the most surprising in the MCU.





 4  Ultron Is Disintegrated By Vision And The Mind Stone 
Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)


 







  Avengers: Age of Ultron  


  Release Date    May 1, 2015     Director    Joss Whedon     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Clark Gregg , Robert Downey Jr. , Cobie Smulders , Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Jeremy Renner , Thomas Kretschmann , Chris Evans , Don Cheadle , Mark Ruffalo , Elizabeth Olsen , Scarlett Johansson , Paul Bettany , Samuel L. Jackson , James Spader     Runtime    141 minutes    


In Avengers: Age of Ultron, the eponymous villain is disintegrated by Vision using the mind stone. The decisive act seemingly eradicated the malevolent artificial intelligence. However, in a surprising twist, several parts of Ultron&#39;s body reappear in Spider-Man: Homecoming. Various body parts are reconstituted as weapons wielded by the Vulture&#39;s criminal gang, but the most notable example is his detached head. Spider-Man finds Ultron&#39;s robotic cranium inside the Damage Control warehouse. Unlike Ultron&#39;s other body parts, his severed head subtly indicates that the villain has survived. In Marvel Comics, Ultron&#39;s glowing red eyes indicate a conscious android, suggesting that the MCU&#39;s Ultron survived his fight with Vision.





 3  Scorpion Is Violently Knocked Overboard 
Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)
        

In Spider-Man: Homecoming, Mac Gargan faces a perilous situation when knocked overboard during Spider-Man&#39;s confrontation with the Vulture on the ferry. While initially appearing as a potential demise, Gargan&#39;s survival is confirmed in the post-credits sequence. Stranded in prison, he confronts the Vulture, expressing his desire to get revenge on the Web-Slinger. The unexpected survival set the stage for Gargan to return as the classic Spider-Man villain, Scorpion - hinted at through the character&#39;s neck tattoo. It also underscores the lingering threat left by Vulture&#39;s survival and knowledge of Peter Parker&#39;s identity, bolstering the hints at a potential Sinister Six team-up.





 2  The High Evolutionary Had His Face Ripped Off 
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3
        

The high Evolutionary served as the primary antagonist in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. During the movie&#39;s dramatic conclusion, his face is violently ripped off by Gamora. Drax encourages Rocket Raccoon to kill the villain, but the hero refuses, noting that the Guardians of the Galaxy are more virtuous than the despicable antagonist. The titular superhero team then seemingly abandon him aboard an exploding aircraft. However, eagle-eyed viewers may have spotted that the High Evolutionary survived Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. His prone body can be seen carried by Drax as the prisoners are liberated, while a deleted scene confirms his survival and subsequent imprisonment.





 1  Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Electro, Sandman, and The Lizard Each Survived Their Deaths 
Spider-Man, Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man, And The Amazing Spider-Man 2
        

Spider-Man: No Way Home brought together three generations of Spider-Man, uniting Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland&#39;s versions of the hero for a dramatic team-up. The heroes are followed by their respective villains, proposing that each of them was transported to the MCU&#39;s universe at the moment of their death in previous movies. This not only introduced the iconic villains into the MCU but also confirmed that, through multiversal magic, each survived their grim fates.
Green Goblin was stabbed by his glider; Doc Ock drowned while destroying his experiment; Sandman disappeared mysteriously; the Lizard disintegrated; and Electro became overpowered. While the previous Spider-Man movies are not strictly considered canon, their reappearances in No Way Home are. They might be the best example of MCU villains who survived outrageous injury, only to return later.
