## Literature Review

How many monster and Titan species reside in the Hollow Earth? Here&#39;s all the creatures the Monsterverse has confirmed to live there so far.




Summary
 The Hollow Earth in the Monsterverse is a thriving ecosystem with various monster species, including Leafwings, Warbats, and Rock Critters. 
 The Hollow Earth world plays a significant role in both Godzilla vs. Kong and Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9. 
 Kong has been relocated to the Hollow Earth and may become the alpha Titan, potentially facing off against the rival Skar King in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. 


A handful of monster and Titan species are confirmed to reside within the Monsterverse&#39;s hidden Hollow Earth world. At first, the Hollow Earth was thought of as a network of underground that allowed Titans to traverse the globe unseen and without delay. However, the concept evolved considerably when it was discovered in Godzilla vs. Kong that beneath the tunnels exists a thriving ecosystem, complete with a number of unique creature types, including a few familiar ones. Other monsters, like the Monsterverse&#39;s Ion Dragon and possibly Godzilla, are occasional visitors to the Hollow Earth, rather than full-time residents.
Thus far, the Hollow Earth world has played a role in two Monsterverse installments. After being fully unveiled in Godzilla vs. Kong&#39;s ending, it made another appearance in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9 where it was visited by Cate, May, and Kurt Russell&#39;s Lee Shaw. Through both projects, the Monsterverse has built a small lineup of monster species that populate the Hollow Earth. Presumably, it&#39;ll receive a significant expansion in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, when it formally introduces the Monsterverse&#39;s Skar King and any other Titans it may be hiding.









 








 7  Leafwings 
Introduced in Kong: Skull Island
        

The first creatures spotted upon the debut of the Hollow Earth world were flying creatures with pterodactyl-like characteristics. Their physical appearances confirmed them to be Leafwings, the same winged monsters that harassed the humans in Kong: Skull Island. The presence of Leafwings in Godzilla vs. Kong&#39;s Hollow Earth supports Dr. Ilene Andrews&#39; theory that Skull Island is &#34;Hollow Earth come to the surface.&#34; It appears that like the Kongs, the Leafwings of Skull Island are native to the Monsterverse&#39;s subterranean world.





 6  Warbats 
Introduced in Godzilla vs. Kong
        

In Godzilla vs. Kong, Kong and APEX&#39;s expedition party were welcomed into the Hollow Earth by a pair of winged serpent monsters. Known as the Warbats, the two creatures teamed up against Kong. Impressively, the two monsters almost won, as one was able to successfully constrict Kong with its serpentine body. It was only due to the interference of the humans that Kong was able to prevail. He could be hard-pressed to win if he has to fight a larger number of them in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.





 5  Rock Critters 
Introduced in Godzilla vs. Kong
        

Godzilla vs. Kong&#39;s Hollow Earth scenes showed off a gathering of little crab monsters now referred to as Rock Critters. Based on what was shown in the movie, the Rock Critters have the natural ability to blend in with their surroundings, which help them avoid predators. Apparently, though, it doesn&#39;t always work, as one was seen getting devoured by another monster in Godzilla vs. Kong. The Rock Critters should not be confused with the other two crab monster species in the Monsterverse, which live on Skull Island. One, the Mantleclaw, appeared in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 1&#39;s opening scene, whereas the much smaller creatures - the Trabdoor Crabs - appeared in Netflix&#39;s Skull Island cartoon.





 4  Titanus Doug 
Introduced in Godzilla vs. Kong
        

The grinning monster that feasted on the Rock Critter in Godzilla vs. Kong was a Hollow Earth lizard affectionately named Titanus Doug by the fanbase. Afterward, the new name was embraced by Godzilla vs. Kong director Adam Wingard, who has promised to bring back Titanus Doug. The creature is now confirmed to make a second live-action appearance in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, which could reveal additional details about his species and whether he truly is a Titan. Based on his small size and stature, he won&#39;t be a threat to any large monsters like Kong or Godzilla. From the looks of things, Titanus Doug is only big enough to prey on tiny monsters.





 3  Hellhawks 
Introduced in Godzilla vs. Kong
        

The main problem faced by the humans in the Hollow Earth in Godzilla vs. Kong came in the form of the Hellhawks. Only slightly larger than the people in the movie, the Hellhawks are winged creatures equipped with sharp beaks and claws. Their attacks confirmed that they&#39;re a carnivorous species that flock together and sleep in caves. Even when there&#39;s dozens of them, they&#39;re no match for Kong, but they could continue to be an issue for the humans if they try to expand their presence in the Hollow Earth in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.





 2  Bramble Boars 
Introduced in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9
        

Making its first appearance in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 9, the Bramble Boar is a menacing creature that roams the same Hollow Earth realm entered by Cate, May, and Shaw in episode 8&#39;s cliffhanger ending. The large boar monster isn&#39;t Titan-sized, but is still big enough to be threatening to an unarmed human. The Bramble Boar sports massive teeth and tusks, along with ivory or bone-like appendages protruding from its back. Boars are ominivores in real life, but it&#39;s unclear if the same is the case for the Bramble Boar.
While it&#39;s presence in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters was limited to just one scene, its behavior revealed a great deal about it. It&#39;s attitude toward Cate shows its cautious toward humans, as it initially walked away. However, it seemingly rethought the decision and circled back to attack her, whether it be to eat her or to ward off a potential threat to its territory. However, humans do have the ability to scare it away and even hurt the creature. It fled from the area when Keiko Randa shot it with her bow.





 1  Kong 
Introduced in Kong: Skull Island
        

Godzilla vs. Kong saw Kong lose his classic home to a storm. Kong has always been tied to Skull Island, but the growing storm&#39;s destruction of its ecosystem left the place uninhabitable. For this reason, Kong was relocated to the Hollow Earth world. The end of the movie confirmed that Monarch built a monitoring station in the Hollow Earth to observe him in his new habitat.
Judging by the scene where Kong sits down in the throne in his ancestors&#39; temple, Kong is in position to become the alpha Titan of the Hollow Earth world. Obtaining this role - or keeping it - could be what drives his story in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, where he may face a rival in Skar King. The soon-to-be-introduced Monsterverse villain may already be active in the Hollow Earth, though where exactly he lives remains to be seen.
