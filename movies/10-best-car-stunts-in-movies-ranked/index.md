## Literature Review

Even after decades of car stunts in action movies, big jumps, crashes and flips can still leave audiences speechless, reveling in the motorized chaos.




Thrilling car stunts can elevate a good action movie to a great one, especially when they use innovative practical effects. Big jumps, drifts and crashes have the ability to shock audiences, even after the development of more sophisticated CGI. While CGI opens up a new world of possibilities, it still doesn&#39;t surpass old-fashioned practical effects in terms of sheer excitement. The visceral thrill of witnessing contained carnage has delighted audiences for decades, and car stunts are one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
Car stunts mostly fall into the same few categories, including racing, chases, jumps, and flips. Each of these plays out a different fantasy, and they all collectively portray extraordinary events in ordinary surroundings. Cars are everyday objects, so seeing them involved in outrageous, explosive stunts mixes intense thrills with relatability, which is rare formula. Because of their ubiquitous appeal, car stunts have been around in movies for decades, and this has meant that they have reimagined and reinvented repeatedly. Even after hundreds of action movies using cars like a child uses cheap toys, big car stunts still have the power to leave audiences speechless.









 








 10  Daytona 24 Hours 
Ford v Ferrari (2019)
        

Mangold uses longer takes rather than punchy, quick cuts to emphasize the immense danger to the drivers and the tiny margin for error. 

Ford v Ferrari is full of impressive stunt driving. It doesn’t have the jaw-dropping crashes and flips that a lot of action movies put their cars through, but Ford v Ferrari is one of the finest examples of high-speed racing in any movie. James Mangold’s direction is meticulously tailored toward creating immersive race scenes, and Ken Miles’ final lap at the 24 Hours of Daytona sees every element working in beautiful harmony. The low camera angles put the audience in the driver’s seat, and Mangold uses longer takes rather than punchy, quick cuts to emphasize the immense danger to the drivers and the tiny margin for error.





 9  Chaos In Piccadilly Circus 
An American Werewolf in London (1981)
        

An American Werewolf in London is well-respected for its brilliant transformation scene, but the movie’s most eye-popping stunts don’t come until long after David has become a werewolf. After transforming in an adult movie theater, David emerges in Piccadilly Circus, one of London’s busiest tourist hotspots. The appearance of the werewolf causes panic, with several cars losing control and careening into pedestrians or piling up on the sidewalk. The chaos also includes a double-decker bus and a motorcycle, and gallons of fake blood. It’s a wonderfully choreographed frenzy of violence, with the best stunt of the lot being the bus spinning out and blocking the path of an oncoming car.





 8  Opening Chase 
Baby Driver (2017)


 







Edgar Wright’s first movie on American soil pays tribute to several heist classics, and it features plenty of stunt driving to make the chase scenes as thrilling as possible. The opening chase showcases Baby’s incredible driving skills and his creativity, as he tears through Atlanta in a Subaru Impreza WRX. The sequence strings together a number of impressive stunts in quick succession, including a power slide uphill around a hairpin bend. The filming of Baby Driver required a few different camera rigs to get footage of the actors in the vehicle as the stunt drivers worked from the roof of the car or a cage hanging beside it.
            
 
 Edgar Wright Movies Ranked, Worst to Best (Including Last Night in Soho) 
Edgar Wright is a director responsible for cult classics like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead; here&#39;s how his movies rank from worst to best. 








 7  Police Chase In Reverse 
Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)
        

It takes a lot to innovate with car chases in movies, since they have been action movie staples for decades. Kingsman: The Secret Service comes up with a fresh approach by staging an entire car chase in reverse. The Subaru Impreza was modified for the scene, with the entire body being removed and refitted backwards to keep the engine and the steering wheel in the front. This allowed the car to snake through the streets of London without spinning out too easily, and without having to remove the reverse speed limiter. Creative stunts like this are partly why The Secret Service is still the best Kingsman movie.





 6  Rooftop Jump 
The Italian Job (1969)
        

The Minis perform pinpoint drifts through the streets before barreling through the sewers and eventually climbing onto a moving bus. 

The Italian Job is famous for its use of Mini Coopers as getaway vehicles. The small cars are able to weave in and out of tight spaces, making them perfect for an escape through the narrow alleyways and covered markets of Turin. The Minis perform pinpoint drifts through the streets before barreling through the sewers and eventually climbing onto a moving bus. The entire sequence is a masterclass in stunt driving, and it’s still just as exciting over 50 years later. The most spectacular moment is the rooftop jump, when all three cars soar over a deadly drop to escape from the pursuing police officers.





 5  Marauders On The Road 
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)


 







Mad Max: Fury Road essentially extends the thrilling action of the chase scene from Mad Max 2 into an entire movie, with relentless pulsating action throughout. There are dozens of explosive stunts to choose from, and a baseline of remarkable stunt driving. One particularly eye-catching moment occurs when Furiosa’s big rig is almost hijacked by marauders. A chain is pulled from the sand to create an impassable tripwire, and a spiked car is sent flipping frontwards into a shallow pit. The upcoming prequel, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, will need to commit to practical effects in the same way to stand a chance of living up to Fury Road.





 4  Semi-Truck Flip 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

Many directors would likely use a lot of CGI to flip a truck in a densely populated area, but Christopher Nolan chose to use practical effects. CGI can age poorly, but well-executed practical techniques will never look dated, and this helps The Dark Knight trilogy stand the test of time. Nolan used some miniatures for driving scenes in The Dark Knight, but the truck flip was achieved in full scale, using a piston underneath the truck to stop it dead in its tracks. The superhero genre has been a dominant force in Hollywood ever since The Dark Knight, but very few movies have had the same level of visceral carnage.





 3  Aston Martin Roll 
Casino Royale (2006)
        

As James Bond races to find Vesper Lynd, he turns a corner and sees her tied up in the middle of the road. Swerving sharply to avoid her, his iconic Aston Martin is sent tumbling down a hillside. It’s one of the most dangerous James Bond stunts ever, sending stunt driver Adam Kirley rolling seven times in spectacular fashion. There’s a brief moment of serenity as the car hovers in the air, but the violent impact quickly shatters this illusion. The Aston Martin roll proves that stunts can be just as jaw-dropping when things are going wrong for the main characters.





 2  Cargo Plane Drop 
Furious 7 (2015)


 







The Fast and Furious franchise has always featured remarkable stunt driving, but as the franchise has gone on, the stunts have become bigger and bigger. The first few movies focus on street racing, but around the time of Fast Five, things get kicked up a few notches. Furious 7’s cargo plane drop is one of the most absurd stunts in the whole franchise, but it was achieved with mostly practical effects. The actors were added in with CGI, but the production did drop cars from two Lockheed C-130 Hercules cargo planes flying over the Arizona desert. Skydivers wearing helmet cameras filmed the scene from above and below.





 1  Corkscrew Flip 
The Man with the Golden Gun (1974)
        

While chasing Francisco Scaramanga, James Bond eyes a dangerous but promising shortcut over a river. Stunt driver Loren “Bumps” Willert performed the corkscrew jump in one attempt, but he was assisted by cutting-edge computer simulations, which producers used to ensure the move was made as safely as possible. Spinning 270 degrees is even more unusual than a 360-degree barrel roll, but the stunt works perfectly. The only drawback is the goofy slide whistle sound effect which is added to the scene. The James Bond franchise certainly wouldn’t undercut such an awe-inspiring moment in this way in the more recent movies.
