## Literature Review

The combined star power of Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston has resulted in several hit films, but which of their comedic pairings is the very best?




With combined star power and charming chemistry, the Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston movies have proven they are a wonderful cinematic pairing. Both Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston made big splashes in the &#39;90s, and their careers continued to pick up steam in the ensuing decades until they both became Hollywood giants. Sandler&#39;s antics made him a comedy legend, while Aniston&#39;s more understated turns made her the perfect foil for any goofball co-star. Though it took years for the duo to finally appear together following their first collaboration, the pairing immediately proved to be a perfect match, leading to a follow-up that reunited them again.
Starting in 2011 with Just Go with It, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston&#39;s chemistry on screen was immediately apparent, and their individual styles managed to elevate each other&#39;s performances. The key to the success of the Sandler/Aniston films has been her ability to go along with his over-the-top comedy without ever being overshadowed. The overwhelming success of 2019&#39;s Murder Mystery proved that the pairing was no fluke, and it became one of the few Adam Sandler movies to receive a sequel with the release of 2023&#39;s Murder Mystery 2. With three hits under their belts, more Sandler and Aniston matchups are almost certain to come.
            
 
 Jennifer Aniston&#39;s Best Movies Ranked By Box Office Success 
It seems like anytime Jennifer Aniston agrees to be part of a movie, the movie ends up being a huge box office success.












 








 3  Just Go With It (2011) 
A Rom-Com With Sandler And Aniston Posing As A Married Couple


 







  Just Go With It  


  Release Date    February 11, 2011     Director    Dennis Dugan     Cast    Adam Sandler , Jennifer Aniston , Brooklyn Decker , Nicole Kidman , Bailee Madison     Runtime    117minutes    


Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler were well into their stardom when they starred together for the first time in 2011&#39;s Just Go with It. Sandler plays a plastic surgeon who enlists the help of his office manager (Aniston) to convince another woman (Brooklyn Decker) that he is a married man who is soon getting a divorce. Just Go with It is a loose remake of the 1969 movie Cactus Flower, but it does little to stand out compared to the original in terms of story. The 2011 movie was generally lambasted by critics, though the cast of Just Go with It scored it some points in reviews.
In particular, the onscreen chemistry between Sandler and Aniston is immediately undeniable, and their scenes transcend the script, which leaves a lot to be desired. One of the biggest problems with Just Go with It is that Sandler&#39;s character, Danny, comes off as irredeemably unlikable from the outset, and the movie&#39;s farcical humor doesn&#39;t make up for that fact. Nevertheless, moviegoers flocked to the theaters in droves to see the first teaming of Sandler and Aniston, and Just Go with It grossed over $200 million (via Box Office Mojo) proving that they were a box office smash together.

 Adam Sandler&#39;s 10 Best Movies, Ranked 
Adam Sandler is one of the most profitable actors of the 21st century, known for both comedic and dramatic movies. Here are the best from his career.








 2  Murder Mystery 2 (2023) 
Aniston And Sandler&#39;s First Sequel Together With An International Mystery
        

  Murder Mystery 2  


  Release Date    March 31, 2023     Director    Jeremy Garelick     Cast    Adam Sandler , Jennifer Aniston , MÃ©lanie Laurent , Jodie Turner-Smith , Annie Mumolo , Tony Goldwyn , Mark Strong     Runtime    89minutes    


Netflix struck gold when they reunited Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler for 2019&#39;s Murder Mystery, and they found similar success with its sequel in 2023. Murder Mystery 2 follows Nick (Sandler) and Audrey (Aniston) as they attempt to gain credibility for their fledgling detective agency when the Maharajah is kidnapped. Critics were just as cool toward the sequel as they were toward the original, but Murder Mystery 2 surprised with near-record views in its opening weekend and was another big hit for Netflix. The shortcomings of the movie and the negative critical reaction were all overshadowed by the star power of its leads.
Murder Mystery 2 put all of its budget on screen, and its resulting globetrotting adds visual intrigue. While the script falls short of being a masterpiece, Sandler and Aniston prove they haven&#39;t lost a bit of their appeal, and the sequel feels like a natural progression from its predecessor. The ending of Murder Mystery 2leaves the door open for additional sequels, and it seems as if the movie was specifically crafted to become a franchise in the same vein as 2019&#39;s Knives Out.

 Murder Mystery 3: Will It Happen? Everything We Know 
Murder Mystery 3 will bring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston back for another crime caper on Netflix, and here&#39;s everything we know.








 1  Murder Mystery (2019) 
Sandler And Aniston Play A Married Couple Turned Detectives On Vacation
        

  Murder Mystery  


  Release Date    June 14, 2019     Director    Kyle Newacheck     Cast    Adam Sandler , Jennifer Aniston , Gemma Arterton     Runtime    97minutes    


Though 2011&#39;s Just Go with It was Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston&#39;s first time appearing together, 2019&#39;s Murder Mystery was their first movie that got the formula of their chemistry right. While embarking on their long-awaited European vacation, a New York City cop (Sandler) and his wife (Aniston) become embroiled in a shocking whodunit. Critics cared little for the Netflix original movie, but subscribers were drawn in by the star-studded cast, and Sandler and Aniston certainly delivered on their end of the bargain.
With much more likable characters to work with, the co-stars present a more relatable story compared to Just Go with It, and the movie&#39;s European setting helped give it a cinematic edge. A working-class-hero character has always best suited Adam Sandler, and Nick Spitz is a guy who fits that bill perfectly. For her part, Jennifer Aniston was elevated to a co-starring role as Audrey Spitz, and she&#39;s just as much a reason for the movie&#39;s success as Sandler. Though none of the Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston movies were warmly received by critics, they were all smash hits, including the original Murder Mystery.
