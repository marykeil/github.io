## Literature Review

Warner Bros. and Legendary&#39;s highly anticipated Monsterverse sequel Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire moves up its release date by two weeks.




Monsterverse sequel Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire moves up its release date by two weeks. Legendary Pictures’ Monsterverse officially began with 2014’s Godzilla, followed up with 2017’s Kong: Skull Island, 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters and 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong. Adam Wingard took the helm for 2021’s Monsterverse showdown movie, and he’s behind the camera again for this year’s entry in the decade-old shared universe, a team-up between the franchise’s two most famous kaiju.




The latest Monsterverse movie indeed promises to be the biggest and baddest yet, and audiences will get to experience its thrills earlier than expected, as the Godzilla x Kong release date has been moved up from April 12, 2024 to March 29 (via Warner Bros. and Legendary). The move comes as Warners also announces that it’s pulling Parasite director Bong Joon-ho’s Robert Pattinson-starring Mickey 17 from its March 29 release date.


 


 How The New Release Date Might Affect Godzilla x Kong’s Box Office 
          

Godzilla x Kong already had a clear path to debuting at the number one spot at the box office in its original April 12 slot, as there are no other major releases planned for that date. Despite moving up two weeks, the film should still have little trouble taking the top spot, as March 29 is also free of other major releases. That March 29 release date originally would have seen an interesting showdown between the latest Monsterverse movie and the sequel Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (which coincidentally also has the word “empire” in the title), but the Ghostbusters: Afterlife follow-up has already announced that it has moved its own release up by a week, to March 22.






Godzilla&#39;s power is pink in the new movie, as revealed in its trailer, while Kong sports a longer beard and more gray hair.




March is indeed shaping up to be a great time for those who love action-packed sci-fi, as the month will also see the release of Dune: Part Two. It’s yet to be seen which of these big movies will ultimately conquer the box office, but Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has positioned itself to be a strong contender, with little competition to worry about.
