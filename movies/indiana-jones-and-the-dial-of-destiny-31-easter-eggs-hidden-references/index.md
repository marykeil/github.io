## Literature Review

Indiana Jones 5 honors the entire legacy of the adventuring archaeologist with several fun Dial of Destiny Easter eggs and references.




Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth movie in the popular adventure franchise and it features all kinds of hidden treasures in the form of Easter eggs referencing the entire franchise. Serving as the conclusive final chapter for Harrison Ford&#39;s adventuring archaeologist, Dial of Destiny offers one last ride for Dr. Henry Jones Jr. while offering a strong number of references to Indy&#39;s history. As such, there&#39;s a strong amount of nostalgia as Indy embarks on a brand-new adventure, the culmination of his entire career.
Although Dial of Destiny comes from Disney and director James Mangold as opposed to Paramount and Steven Speilberg, the fifth Indiana Jones movie still taps into the franchise&#39;s classic themes while embracing the beloved legacy the previous installments left behind. It also helps that John Williams once again provides the iconic theme alongside a brand-new soundtrack. As such, much of that legacy comes in the form of Dial of Destiny Easter eggs and hidden references dating back to 1981&#39;s Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark and the sequels that followed it.
            
 
 What Happened To Indiana Jones Between Crystal Skull And The Dial Of Destiny 
12 years of Harrison Ford&#39;s character&#39;s life happened off-screen. Here&#39;s what happened to Indiana Jones between Crystal Skull and Dial of Destiny.












 








 31  Dial of Destiny&#39;s Title And Credits Fonts Match Past Indy Movies 
A Familiar Title Font


 







While there isn&#39;t the classic transition from the Paramount mountain title card to a shot in the film itself as seen in past Indiana Jones movies, the title font for Dial of Destiny is consistent with the previous four films. That said, the Lucasfilm logo does transition to a similarly shaped lock on a box, honoring the tradition to some degree.





 30  Lance of Longinus: Another Religious Artifact In Indiana Jones 
The Lance Is A Real Historical Item Associated With Hitler
        

Looking to recover the Lance of Longinus from the Nazis at the end of WWII, it seemed as though Indiana Jones was going to recover yet another artifact of religious significance at the beginning of Dial of Destiny. Believed to be the blade that pierced the side of Christ, the Lance was coveted by Hitler just as much as the Holy Grail according to history, and the blade was recovered from the Nuremberg Fortress on the day Hitler took his own life. However, the one transported by the Nazis and found by Indy and Basil Shaw (Tobey Jones) is revealed to be a fake in Dial of Destiny.





 29  Indiana Jones 5 Includes Meta MCU Hydra Cameos 
Thomas Kretschmann Played Nazis In Both Franchises
        

In the WWII flashback sequence, Thomas Kretschmann plays Colonel Weber, who was put in charge of the plunder train full of treasures that had been stolen by the Nazis throughout the war. Humorously, Kretschmann also played Baron Wolfgang von Strucker in the MCU, who was a major leader of Hydra while Basil Shaw&#39;s Tobey Jones played Arnim Zola, another key figure within Marvel&#39;s Nazi science division. As such, one has to wonder if Kretschmann and Jones offered each other a &#34;Hail Hydra&#34; while filming Dial of Destiny.





 28  Indy Uses Classic Nazi Disguise Trick From Raiders and Last Crusade 
A Familiar Disguise Returns
        

Although he was captured, the de-aged Indy is seen wearing a Nazi officer&#39;s uniform, presumably as a means of sneaking behind enemy lines to find the Lance. However, the disguise still came in handy once he escaped and boarded the plunder train to save Basil, mirroring both Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade where Indy disguised himself wearing a Nazi uniform. Pretending to look like the enemy is a tried and true tactic, and even Harrison Ford&#39;s Han Solo used it in Star Wars dressed as a Stormtrooper.





 27  Wilhelm Scream At The Beginning Of Indiana Jones 5 
The Return Of A Much-Used Sound Effect
        

A classic stock sound effect heard in countless movies, the Wilhelm scream has been featured in several movies, including Lucasfilm&#39;s Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises, most notably heard in Temple of Doom more than once. In Dial of Destiny, the Wilhelm scream is heard on board the plunder train when Indy throws one of the Nazi soldiers off the side. For those unaware, the Wilhelm scream is a stock sound effect that has been used in movies since the 1951 movie Distant Drums, named after the character, Private Wilhelm, and voiced by actor Sheb Wooley.
            
 
 Indiana Jones And The Dial Of Destiny’s Real History &amp; Mythology Explained 
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny has many historical elements - we break down the real mythologies and the tweaks the movie makes to them.








 26  Marion Ravenwood&#39;s Divorce Papers and Pictures 
Things Didn&#39;t Work Out For Indy &amp; Marion


 







Jumping to the present day for Indiana Jones in 1969, Indiana is 70 years old in The Dial of Destiny. Now a professor of archeology in New York City, it&#39;s revealed that Jones is living on his own despite having finally married Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) at the end of the preceding Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. As a result, divorce papers are seen on the kitchen counter just before Indy covers Marion&#39;s picture on his fridge with a magnet. There are also pictures of Indiana&#39;s father and son which can be seen on his desk.





 25  Indy 5 Features Archimedes Devices From History 
More Inventions From Archimedes Other Than The Antikythera
        

Beyond the primary device created by Archimedes known as the Antikythera (or &#34;Dial of Destiny), Indiana Jones references other devices created by the mathematician and inventor in Ancient Greece during a college lecture. This includes the Iron Claw and a literal heat ray the engineer created using reflective mirrors in defense of Syracuse from invading Roman soldiers in 214 BC.





 24  Jürgen Voller and Operation Paperclip In Dial of Destiny 
Jürgen Voller Ties Into Indiana Jones&#39; Past


 







1969 also reveals that the Nazi physicist Jürgen Voller (Mads Mikkelsen) has become a professor at the University of Alabama, working for NASA as part of Operation Paperclip, where Nazi scientists were recruited by the United States government to help with the lunar mission. It&#39;s revealed that Voller had a direct hand in building the V2 rocket in the Indiana Jones continuity. However, his true goal still lay in securing the Antikythera to &#34;correct Hitler&#39;s mistakes.&#34;





 23  Helena Shaw And Her Obsessed Father Mirrors Holy Grail 
A New Generation With Father Issues
        

When Indiana is first approached by his goddaughter Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), she claims that she&#39;s graduated in archeology and is seeking the Antikythera, the same device her father was obsessed with. This mirrors Indiana&#39;s own past and father, Henry Jones Sr (Sean Connery) who was obsessed with the Holy Grail as seen in The Last Crusade.





 22  “She Had It In Her Hand” 
Indy 5&#39;s Raiders Reference
        

With Indy having half of the Dial that he and Basil recovered from the Nazis, Helena&#39;s true goals are revealed when she takes the Dial for herself while being pursued by the CIA, who are working with Voller. Evading capture, Agent Mason (Shaunette Renée Wilson) laments how close they were to getting the Dial, &#34;It was there. She had it in her hand!&#34; This could very well be a reference to a line from Indy at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark after Belloq stole the Fertility Idol: &#34;I had it Marcus, it was in my hand!&#34;

 21  Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin &amp; Michael Collins Cameo In Indy 5 
Real American Legends Show Up In Indy&#39;s World
        

During the pursuit through the streets of New York, Indy rides a police horse through a parade celebrating the Moon landing. As such, he rides right by historical cameos of astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. It was a relatively brief moment, but still a Dial of Destiny easter egg that helped cement the 5th Indiana Jones movie&#39;s place in the timeline.





 20  Indiana Jones 5 Reveals Mutt&#39;s Fate After Crystal Skull 
It Was A Sad Ending For Indy&#39;s Son


 







In the aftermath of the New York chase, Indy hears a news report about an incident where it&#39;s mentioned that Indiana&#39;s son Mutt aka Henry Jones III has died. Later on, it&#39;s confirmed that Mutt enlisted in the army and was killed in action. As such, the resulting grief for Marion and Indy led to their divorce. It&#39;s certainly a tragic way to explain the absence of Mutt who was played by Shia LaBeouf in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.





 19  “She Doesn’t Want To Talk To Me” 
Indy&#39;s Marion Line Mirrors Han Solo and Leia
        

During the scene where Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) arrives to help Indy leave New York, Jones comments that Marion doesn&#39;t want to talk to him. This mirrors Han Solo&#39;s comments about Leia in The Force Awakens, part of a very similar arc where Han and Leia spent time separated in the wake of their son&#39;s corruption to the dark side as Kylo Ren.





 18  It Belongs In A Museum! 
Indy Has Never Changed His Belief System
        

Throughout the majority of Dial of Destiny, Indy, and Helena are at an impasse as Jones can&#39;t condone Helena&#39;s life as a thief who initially wanted to sell the Dial to the highest bidder. Naturally, this promotes Indy&#39;s classic &#34;It belongs in a museum!&#34; first heard in The Last Crusade, and he also says it to Helena&#39;s father in a flashback when Basil wanted to destroy the dial.

 17  Teddy Is Helena’s Short Round With A Perfect Indy 5 Debut 
Ke Huy Quan Does Not Appear In Dial Of Destiny
        

Although Ke Huy Quan does not make an appearance in the last Indiana Jones movie as Short Round, the legacy of Short Round lives on with Teddy (Ethann Isidore). Revealed to be Helena&#39;s sidekick, Teddy apparently tried to steal from Shaw when he was 10 and the two have been together ever since, resembling how Indy and Shorty met as was revealed in Temple of Doom. Likewise, Teddy&#39;s first major scene sees him providing a tuk-tuk in Morroco, much like Short Round was Indy&#39;s getaway driver in Shanghai.





 16  Helena Calls Indy &#34;Jonesy&#34; 
A Crystal Skull Reference
        

During Helena&#39;s failed attempt to auction off half of the Antikythera, she calls him &#34;Jonesy&#34; when he crashes the party. The only other character in the Indiana Jones franchise who called Indy &#34;Jonesy&#34; was George &#34;Mac&#34; Mchale, Jones&#39; spy friend-turned-thief played by Ray Winstone in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.





 15  Indy 5 Reverses Raiders Swordsman Scene 
Indy Was On The Receiving End This Time


 







Attempting to be intimidating by cracking his whip at the auction, all the present company pulled guns on Indy in response. This is the perfect reversal of the classic scene from Raiders when Indy simply pulled a gun on the cocky swordsman who was showing off his skills (which Ford famously improvised as he was sick that day of filming).





 14  Indiana Jones Has His Father&#39;s Watch 
Teddy Tries To Steal The Iconic Timepiece
        

Following the car chase in Morroco with tuk-tuks, Indy has to ask for his watch back, which Teddy skillfully picks pockets without him noticing. Indy also reveals that the watch belonged to his father, Henry Jones Sr. While this adds weight to the moment, it&#39;s also a Dial of Destiny easter egg harkening back to the late Sean Connery&#39;s Indiana Jones character in The Last Crusade.





 13  Indiana Jones Features Classic Plane/Boat/Train Travel Sequences 
The Map Point Graphics Make A Return
        

Whether Indy is flying on a Pan Am airplane just like in The Last Crusade, or traveling by boat and train to find the other half of the Antikythera, all the travel sequences in Dial of Destiny honor the past films&#39; legacy, showing the maps and routes going from point to point. It&#39;s a staple of the Indiana Jones franchise that would have been disappointing had it been left out.

 12  “Dates? What Dates?” 
A Raiders Reference From Salah
        

When Indiana Jones asks Helena about a set of dates Basil had written in his journals about the Dial, they have some interesting back-and-forth dialogue: &#34;Dates? What Dates?&#34; &#34;These Dates.&#34; This could be a small reference to Sallah&#39;s line in Raiders after Indy almost eats a poisoned date (the food): &#34;Bad Dates.&#34; While it&#39;s admittedly a looser reference, it may amuse certain Indiana Jones fans who might have made the same connection.
