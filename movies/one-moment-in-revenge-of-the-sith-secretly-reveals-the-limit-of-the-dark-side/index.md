# One Moment In Revenge Of The Sith Secretly Reveals The Limit Of The Dark Side


## SUMMARY 



  Anakin&#39;s newfound abilities in the dark side allow him to overpower many Jedi, but he is still getting used to his power when he duels Obi-Wan.   Obi-Wan&#39;s skill and experience make him a match for Anakin, despite Anakin&#39;s innate talent as the Chosen One.   The dark side may unlock great power, but it cannot compare to the power that is earned and mastered through time and dedication.

## Literature Review

Anakin and Obi-Wan’s duel in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith shows exactly why the dark side just wasn’t stronger than the light side.




Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi’s fateful duel at the end of Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith remains one of the most iconic moments in the franchise. Not only is their clash emotional and dramatic, but it also gives a look at the utmost limits of power in both the dark side and the light side. Both Anakin and Obi-Wan resort to utilizing their full power to destroy the other. And even though Obi-Wan is conflicted over Anakin’s abysmal state, he is still able to beat him fair and square. However, as it turns out, Anakin never fought fairly in the first place.




Surprisingly, both Anakin and Obi-Wan seemed to be perfectly matched during their duel on Mustafar, even though Anakin wasn’t a Jedi Master like Obi-Wan was. Overall, Anakin had much less training than Obi-Wan, yet he still gave a good fight. The best example of their power levels can be seen when they telekinetically battle with the Force in the Separatist Council War Room. Both lock hands in a struggle to push the other back, and both end up being launched the exact same distance. One explanation for why Anakin can suddenly match Obi-Wan’s power—beyond Anakin’s status as the Chosen One—has to do with his descent into the dark side.

                  Revenge Of The Sith&#39;s Battle Of The Heroes Recreated In Amazing Clone Wars Animation   Revenge of the Sith&#39;s iconic Battle Of The Heroes between Anakin and Obi-Wan is perfectly recreated in an amazing Star Wars: The Clone Wars animation.   


 The Dark Side Is Like A &#34;Cheat Code&#34; In A Game 
It allows the user to quickly level up in the Force
         




Much like the Revenge of the Sith video game, the dark side of the Force acts like a cheat code which prematurely unlocks special abilities. While Palpatine had been working on Anakin for some time, Anakin only made the full decision to join the dark side after killing Mace Windu and joining Order 66. That means Anakin had only been fully devoted to the dark side for a few days or weeks before dueling Obi-Wan. Nevertheless, his newfound abilities in the dark side allowed him to expertly cut down many seasoned Jedi during Order 66.

It&#39;s important to remember Yoda’s wise words to Luke Skywalker in The Empire Strikes Back when he said that the dark side is not stronger than the light side. Despite Anakin’s sudden boost in power, he still needed time to learn and control his new abilities. His sheer ability—combined with the element of surprise—was enough to overpower most of the Jedi in the Jedi Temple. But with Obi-Wan, Anakin was still getting used to the power the dark side unlocked for him.






 Obi-Wan Can Match Anakin... Because He&#39;s Simply More Skilled 
Obi-Wan chose train slowly and steadily
          

In comparison, Obi-Wan had trained and honed his abilities in the Force for decades. Unlike Anakin, Obi-Wan did not have the innate talent that came with being the Chosen One. In other words, Anakin started the game of life as a high level right away, while Obi-Wan had to build his power from the ground up. Aside from the temptation to fall to the dark side, Obi-Wan had no shortcuts available for him to power up quickly. Instead, he took his time learning new abilities and mastering them before moving on to the next level.

Anakin started life with a preinstalled gift for the Force, but even this wasn’t enough to satiate his need for more power. His fall to the dark side in Revenge of the Sith represents another jump in power ahead of everyone else. But while Anakin reached his level quickly by cheating with the dark side, Obi-Wan had reached the same level with years of dedication and hard work. Anakin ultimately floundered to control his power because he didn’t have much experience using it, while Obi-Wan knew his own abilities from the inside out.




                  Obi-Wan Kenobi May Be The Ultimate Jedi, But He&#39;s The Worst Team Player   Obi-Wan Kenobi is often seen as the embodiment of the perfect Jedi in Star Wars, yet he has one big flaw in the movies that people rarely bring up.   



 Even The Dark Side Can Only Unlock So Much Power 
The quick path to power ended up being Anakin&#39;s downfall
          

In the end, Anakin’s miraculous leap in power with the dark side of the Force was too good to be true. Yes, the dark side is a quick and easy path to many unnatural abilities in the Force, but it can’t compare to power that was steadily earned and mastered. Like a video game, a cheat code can unlock many unique powers. But if the player doesn’t know how to use those powers, they can still lose to someone who has sunk hours into playing with the base character.

The dark side unlocked a massive amount of power for Anakin, but that power can only go so far for someone who doesn’t know how to use it. If anything, it’s a miracle Anakin lasted so long against a seasoned warrior like Obi-Wan. In their case, the apprentice could not surpass the master. Like Yoda said, the dark side just wasn’t stronger than the light side, and Obi-Wan’s duel with Anakin in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith proves it.
