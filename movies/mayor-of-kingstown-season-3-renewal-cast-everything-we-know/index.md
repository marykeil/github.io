## Literature Review

Mayor of Kingstown season 3 is in the works for Paramount&#43; with Jeremy Renner returning to the lead role and here is everything known about the show.




 Mayor of Kingstown was a hit for Paramount&#43; from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan, and it&#39;s been confirmed that the Jeremy Renner-led crime drama is continuing with Mayor of Kingstown season 3. Much like how Yellowstone was a Paramount&#43; exclusive, Mayor of Kingstown has been one of the highlights of the platform&#39;s original shows. Jeremy Renner stars as Mike McLusky, a member of a powerful family who are power brokers in the prison town of Kingstown, Michigan. While neither season was received particularly well by critics, it was a hit with audiences and continued Taylor Sheridan&#39;s hot streak on TV. When it comes to Mayor of Kingstown season 3, the second season started with the aftermath of a prison riot and a huge emphasis placed on the rivalry between Mike and the Russian mobster Milo (Aiden Gillen). Given how explosive the season 2 finale was, viewers are eager to know what&#39;s next for the McLusky&#39;s when the Mayor of Kingstown season 3 arrives.Stream On Paramount&#43;

 Mayor of Kingstown Season 3 Story 
          

There are no plot details concerning the Mayor of Kingstown season 3 story. The second season of Mayor of Kingstown followed the prison riot from season 1 and the fallout. However, season 2 ended with Mike&#39;s old friend and rival Milo faking his death in a boat explosion. This allows him to go behind the scenes and start to mess with Mike in a new and creative manner. Other than that detail, there is no telling where the Mayor of Kingstown season 3 story will go and how much it will rely on the prison now that Milo is out.
