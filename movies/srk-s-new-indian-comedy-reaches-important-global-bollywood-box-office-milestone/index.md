## Literature Review

Actor Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s new Indian comedy Dunki reaches an important global and Bollywood box office milestone as a high-grossing theatrical hit.




Shah Rukh Khan - also known as SRK - has broken box office and Bollywood records with his latest hit, the Indian comedy film Dunki. The movie follows a group of friends utilizing an illegal immigration technique to move to another country. The film has been praised for its balance of both comedic moments and drama showcased by its talented cast.




Now, Collider reports that, despite mixed reviews for Dunki, Khan&#39;s latest hit has earned $55 million over its worldwide theatrical release. The movie has become the star&#39;s third-highest-grossing film of all time. His total box office earnings throughout 2023 were also reported to be $323 million, record-breaking for the star.


 How Dunki Proves SRK Is Making A Comeback 
          

Khan’s career has been bolstered by Dunki’s worldwide theatrical release, alongside two other, more critically praised films he starred in during 2023. Both movies, Pathaan and Jawan, are action thrillers, with the actor starring as the main hero in both productions. The theatrical success of all three movies indicates his star power, showing how he is able to be a successful addition to a variety of genre films.




The actor&#39;s success indicates how big Indian productions are becoming around the world. This was prominently reflected by the loosely based on a true story RRR, whose box office success worldwide opened the door for other prominent theatrical releases. Not only does this mean Khan&#39;s career is on an upturn, but all of the Bollywood scene is making a comeback thanks to a global market.

                  SRK&#39;s Next Movie Will Break His Amazing 2023 Streak (But That&#39;s OK!)   Shah Rukh Khan has had an extremely impressive year filled with success thanks to Pathaan and Jawan, but his next project is set to break his streak.   

Given Khan&#39;s major roles this year, it&#39;s probable other movies like Dunki could star the leading actor in the future. While it&#39;s unclear what his next project will be, it&#39;s likely to find similar global success as his newest work has. This means he may be on even more theater screens in the future as more of his future projects get released.



SRK recently joined the YRF Spy Universe as the character Pathaan, who made a cameo appearance in Tiger 3.
