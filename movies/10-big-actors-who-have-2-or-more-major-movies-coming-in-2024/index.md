## Literature Review

2024 has tons of exciting movie releases scheduled. Actors like Henry Cavill and Pedro Pascal have more than one major film to look forward to.




Several of Hollywood&#39;s most famous actors are set to have huge years, with two prominent movies releasing sometime in 2024. Movie stars are a huge draw to the box office, and an actor having two film releases within a short period can positively affect their box office potential. If the first movie is well received, traction can build for the next one. Actors like Nicolas Cage, Colman Domingo, and Ayo Edebiri had multiple films released in 2023, resulting in successful years for each actor.
2024 should be an exciting year for Hollywood, with the effect of &#34;Barbenheimer&#34; still in the minds of audiences and studios. While many blockbuster franchise films are set to be released, many of 2024&#39;s most anticipated movies are original projects from auteur filmmakers like Jordan Peele, Robert Eggers, and Bong Joon-ho. Several of the year&#39;s biggest blockbusters will see repeat appearances from beloved Hollywood stars.









 








 10  Zendaya 
Zendaya will appear in Dune: Part Two and Challengers.


 







  Dune: Part Two  


  Release Date    March 1, 2024     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Timothee Chalamet , Zendaya , Florence Pugh , Austin Butler , Rebecca Ferguson     Genres     Sci-Fi , Thriller , Drama , Adventure    


While many Zendaya fans eagerly await Euphoria season 3, the wait is unfortunately prolonged to 2025 due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. However, Zendaya has two enormously exciting projects releasing in 2024. The actress will star in the film Challengers, which looks to be a highly promising original film from Call Me By Your Name director Luca Guadagnino. After a minor appearance in 2021&#39;s Dune, Zendaya will also reprise her role as Chani in Dune: Part Two, where she&#39;ll have a far more significant role than in the first installment.





 9  Henry Cavill 
Henry Cavill will appear in Argylle and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.
        

  Argylle  


  Release Date    February 2, 2024     Director    Matthew Vaughn     Cast    Henry Cavill , Ariana DeBose , Sofia Boutella , Catherine O&#39;Hara , Bryce Dallas Howard , John Cena , Dua Lipa , Samuel L. Jackson , Sam Rockwell , Bryan Cranston , Rob Delaney     Runtime    135 Minutes    


Anyone who&#39;s been to a movie theater recently has seen the ridiculous trailer for Argylle, which sports Henry Cavill with a crazy hairstyle. The actor will be looking to enter the post-Superman and post-Witcher phase of his career with some successful projects, and he&#39;s working with the right talent to do so. Kingsman director Matthew Vaughn directs Argylle, and Cavill will also star in Guy Ritchie&#39;s next film, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Both projects are set to be action-heavy and are from two directors with whom Henry Cavill&#39;s skill set meshes perfectly.

Reynolds will utilize his comedic chops again in the film IF, which stands for Imaginary Friends. The movie is written and directed by John Krasinski, who will co-star alongside Reynolds.

The comedian has more prominent voice acting roles in the future, returning as Po in Kung Fu Panda 4 and playing the robot Claptrap in the Borderlands movie. Both films are set to be significant commercial releases, and the actor will continue his streak in 2025, voicing Steve in the Minecraft movie.
