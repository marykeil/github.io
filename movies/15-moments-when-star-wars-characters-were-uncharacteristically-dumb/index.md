# 15 Moments When Star Wars Characters Were Uncharacteristically Dumb


## SUMMARY 


 Characters in the Star Wars franchise often make dumb decisions, from failing to shoot an escape pod to trusting the wrong person. 
 These lapses in judgment can have significant consequences, such as the destruction of the Death Star or the collapse of the Jedi Order. 
 Even competent characters like Han Solo and Palpatine have made critical errors due to their own weaknesses or the demands of the plot.

## Literature Review

Despite the Star Wars franchise being meticulously crafted, there are still plenty of moments where characters make downright dumb decisions.




The Star Wars franchise has its fair share of silly scenes and slapstick comedy, but there are also instances in the series where some characters make downright dumb decisions. From George Lucas to Disney, the franchise and most of its characters have been meticulously crafted. And with expert character crafting comes intense scrutiny from the audience and critics.
While some characters—such as Jar Jar Binks—can’t help but make terrible decisions, there remains the occasional competent character who fails to think rationally. Whether it be their own moment of weakness or the plot demanding their lapse in judgment, there are multiple moments in both the movies and tv shows featuring uncharacteristically dumb decisions. And while some are harmless, others end up causing destruction and genocide.









 








 1  The Imperial Who Didn’t Shoot C-3PO And R2-D2’s Escape Pod 
Star Wars / A New Hope
        

Perhaps the first lapse in judgement ever shown in Star Wars occurs at the beginning of A New Hope. Bolvin, an Imperial onboard Vader’s Star Destroyer, ends up commanding his subordinate not to shoot the Tantive IV’s escape pod. Little did he realize that both C-3PO and R2-D2 safely made it to the surface of Tatooine because of his oversight. And while he may have saved the Empire a few turbolaser blasts, they came at the expense of the Death Star’s destruction later in the film.





 2  Han Solo Trusting Lando To Help The Rebellion 
The Empire Strikes Back
        

Despite his unkempt appearance, Han Solo is one of the smartest characters in the original trilogy. He may not have had any other options when he turned his crew over into the hands of Lando Calrissian in The Empire Strikes Back, but he grossly overestimated his past friendship with Lando. Given Han’s knowledge of Lando’s cheating habits in Sabacc, he should have kept his guard up more instead of being lulled by the peaceful serenity of Cloud City. In any case, he paid for his oversight at the end of the film after being frozen in carbonite by Darth Vader.





 3  Palpatine Giving The Rebels The Exact Location Of The Shield Generator 
Return of the Jedi


 







Palpatine is often considered the perfect mastermind of Star Wars for flawlessly orchestrating the fall of the Jedi and the reign of the Empire. But his pride and hubris ended up getting the better of him in Return of the Jedi when he willingly gave up the location of the Endor shield generator to the Rebellion. While he hoped to crush Luke’s spirits, he ended up underestimating the Rebels on Endor, spelling out his own doom and the destruction of the second Death Star.





 4  Qui-Gon Insisting That Anakin Be Trained 
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
        

Yes, Qui-Gon’s insistence on training Anakin in The Phantom Menace ultimately led to Anakin bringing balance to the Force in Return of the Jedi, but not before he murdered thousands of Jedi during Order 66. Despite multiple Jedi Council members expressing concerns over Anakin’s age and his clouded future, Qui-Gon wouldn’t take no for an answer. Qui-Gon&#39;s stubbornness inadvertently caused the collapse of the Jedi Order he so faithfully served.





 5  Jango Fett Going To Kill Zam Wesell Rather Than Padmé 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones
        

Palpatine told Dooku to kill Padmé, so Dooku hired Jango Fett, who hired Zam Wesell, who used poisonous Kouhun bugs to try and assassinate her. When this failed, rather than Jango rolling up his sleeves to do the deed himself—while all the Jedi were away chasing Zam—Jango instead chose to sneakily follow the chase and ultimately kill his own employee. Not only did he bungle the operation to kill Padmé, he conveniently left a saberdart at the scene of the crime for Obi-Wan to find, leading the Jedi to rediscover Kamino.





 6  Padmé Dismissing Anakin&#39;s Slaughter Of The Tuskens 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones
        

Later in Attack of the Clones, Padmé uncharacteristically consoles Anakin after his outburst rather than rebuke him for slaughtering a whole tribe of Tusken Raiders. While it’s clear Padmé has fallen for Anakin at this point in the movie, its strange how she suddenly loses her altruistic concern for the helpless Tusken women and children. She’s supposed to be one of the biggest proponents of humanitarian aid in the Senate, yet she sets that aside to help convince her new boyfriend that his genocide wasn’t a big deal.





 7  Obi-Wan And Yoda Hiding Luke At Darth Vader’s Old Home 
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith


 







Of all the brilliant and remote locations to hide Luke Skywalker from his murderous father, Obi-Wan and Yoda send Luke to his murderous father’s home planet. Darth Vader hated reminders of his former life as Anakin, so it could be that Obi-Wan and Yoda counted on his hatred of sand to keep him away from Tatooine. But the logic of the situation says otherwise. With the exception of Reva Savander, it’s a miracle Luke remained almost untouched by the Empire despite growing up playing in the same sand his father had.





 8  Kylo Ren Killing His Own Father To Be Free Of His Pain 
Star Wars: The Force Awakens


 







Han Solo’s death in The Force Awakens is one of the most heartbreaking moments in the sequel trilogy, yet Kylo Ren’s logic doesn’t make much sense. He tells Han that he wishes to be free of “this pain,” but ultimately causes himself further agony by murdering his own father. He tries too hard to walk the same path as his grandfather and ends up making his own life a living hell because of it.





 9  Leia Letting Poe Form A Coup Rather Than Telling Him The Truth 
Star Wars: The Last Jedi
        

It’s no secret that there are a lot of problems with The Last Jedi. But Leia and Holdo’s actions may be at the top of the list for being downright dumb. In the midst of the Resistance’s obliteration by the First Order, both Leia and Holdo allow Poe Dameron to form a heroic coup d’état before telling him it was all a prank. While the movie attempts to play this off as a grand test of Poe’s leadership abilities, it ends up wasting the audience and the Resistance’s time, which could have been better served fighting the First Order.





 10  Han Solo Attempting The Kessel Run In Less Than 12 Parsecs 
Solo: A Star Wars Story
        

Completing the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs is one of Han Solo’s most famous achievements, but the actual logistics of the feat shown in Solo prove just how dumb Han was to even attempt it. Despite having a huge amount of volatile, unrefined coaxium aboard the Millennium Falcon, Han still chooses to fly through a cluster of black holes, known as the Maw, in a near-death attempt to appease Dryden Vos.





 11  Rey Stabbing Kylo… And Then Healing Him 
Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
        

The Rise of Skywalker is often thought of as the worst sequel for blatantly disregarding most of themes and ideas set up in the rest of Star Wars. This can be seen during Rey and Kylo’s duel on the Death Star’s remains. In the heat of their battle, Rey proves herself the better lightsaber fighter and fatally stabs Kylo through the stomach. Nevertheless, mere minutes later, she decides to heal him using her newfound Force powers. Apparently, she can&#39;t make up her mind over whether he should live or die.





 12  Trace Martez Dumping Spice Into Hyperspace 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 7
        

Considering George Lucas worked on much of the series, The Clone Wars features a lot more slapstick comedy than the movies. And while The Clone Wars season 7 is meant to be the serious and climactic finale of the show, the Martez Sister arc features one of the dumbest decisions by any character in Star Wars. Much like Han Solo attempting to smuggle coaxium for the Pyke Syndicate, the Martez sisters take a job transporting Spice for the Pykes. But instead of pulling off a fantastic feat, Trace Martez instead dumps their cargo of spice into hyperspace.





 13  Boba Fett Letting His Rancor Destroy Mos Espa (&amp; Nearly Kill Din Djarin) 
The Book of Boba Fett
        

Star Wars’ live-action shows also feature a fair number of dumb decisions. The Book of Boba Fett climatically shows Boba Fett taming and riding his very own rancor. Despite the rancor being the perfect counter for the Scorpenek annihilator droids, Cad Bane ends up forcefully dismounting Fett. But while Boba deals with Cad Bane, he lets his rancor run amok in Mos Espa, almost causing the death of his friend Din Djarin—if not for Din&#39;s beskar helmet.





 14  Bo-Katan Leading The Mandalorians Straight Into A Trap 
The Mandalorian season 3


 







The Mandalorian season 3 is often considered the weakest of the three seasons, and Bo-Katan’s lack of a battle plan proves this. Despite her being a battle-hardened hero of the Clone Wars, Bo-Katan ignorantly leads her forces into pursuing Moff Gideon’s Imperial armored commandos. In The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7, she unwittingly causes the capture of Din Djarin and the subsequent death of Paz Vizsla.





 15  Sabine Giving The Star Map To Baylan 
Ahsoka
        

In Ahsoka season 1, episode 4, Sabine Wren lets her attachment to Ezra Bridger override her judgement. By giving the Arcana Star Map to Baylan Skoll, Sabine willingly ends up allowing Grand Admiral Thrawn to return to the main Star Wars galaxy. And while her decision has yet to cause many casualties, it’s likely her actions will devastate the New Republic. Thrawn’s resurgent Empire is coming, whether it be in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie or in Ahsoka season 2, and Sabine is the one to blame for it. Sabine may even end up causing the deaths of her most beloved friends in Star Wars.
