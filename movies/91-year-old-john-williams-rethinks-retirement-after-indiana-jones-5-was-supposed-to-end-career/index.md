## Literature Review

John Williams, the legendary composer behind the iconic scores of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Harry Potter, withdraws previous retirement comments.




At 91, John Williams, composer of the iconic scores of Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and more, walks back his previous retirement comments. The legendary composer&#39;s career spans seven decades, frequently collaborating with industry greats such as Steven Spielberg for hits like Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and several others. After an illustrious career, Williams hinted at retirement from film scores in 2022, stating that Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny would likely be his last.




However, the composer said in early 2023 that he planned to &#34;stick around for a while,&#34; and he has now clarified his position with respect to retirement from film composition. While speaking with The Times (per Deadline), Williams withdrew his previous comments about retiring completely, stating that &#34;everything is possible&#34; and he &#34;wouldn’t want to rule anything out.&#34; The composer&#39;s two caveats for coming on board another film project are that it should be a film he is &#34;greatly interested in&#34; and a schedule that works for him. See Williams&#39; comments below:


I don’t care much for grand pronunciamentos, statements that are firm and finished and surrounded by closed doors. If I made one without putting it in context then I withdraw it. If a film came along that I was greatly interested in, with a schedule that I could cope with, then I wouldn’t want to rule anything out. Everything is possible. All is before us. Only our limitations are holding us back. Or, to put it more simply: I like to keep an open mind.






 Potential Future Projects For Williams 
          

While Williams is certainly not making any promises, his comments indicate that he would stick around in the film industry for the right project, raising the question of what that might be. In the era of legacy sequels, many works that Williams previously had a hand in are releasing new installments, including Harry Potter, which is set for a recently announced television remake from Max. Williams&#39; scores went a long way in creating the magic of the first three Harry Potter films, and if the project appealed to him, his familiar touch would be a great asset to the series.



Scheduling conflicts and prior commitments precluded Williams from composing the fourth Harry Potter movie.







While the upcoming Max show is not a film, Williams has worked in the television landscape before, and if he were interested in doing so again, it&#39;s also possible that one of the many Star Wars television shows on Disney&#43; could appeal to him. Of course, if his interests lie strictly in film, Lucasfilm announced three upcoming movies at Star Wars Celebration 2023, and Star Wars&#39; return to the big screen could be the perfect time for Williams to compose a new triumphant Star Wars score. Outside his most well-known franchises, perhaps another collaboration with Spielberg is in store and Williams will join a brand-new project helmed by the legendary director.

                  All 9 John Williams Star Wars Scores, Ranked Worst To Best   Star Wars lives and breathes through the scores of John Williams, and while each Star Wars soundtrack is phenomenal, some rank higher than others.   

Whether Williams returns to the franchises he made so memorable or branches into new territory with a film that has yet to be announced, his loyal fan base is sure to follow him. Over the decades of his career, the composer has crafted truly special scores that have stayed with generations of film lovers, so it is heartening to hear that he would return to film under the right circumstances. When those circumstances do line up, it will be a joy to hear Williams&#39; work again as he continues to display his talents of elevating cinema through music.
