## Literature Review

The Batman movie franchise has featured a litany of bizarre scenes, many of which have become iconic or infamous moments in superhero cinema.




DC&#39;s Batman movies are notorious for melodramatic and eccentric characterizations, but certain scenes have been downright weird. Throughout the complete Batman movie timeline, the Caped Crusader has faced some very idiosyncratic villains. Though his appearances in the DCEU timeline featured few of Batman&#39;s foes, they did include some equally idiosyncratic moments. As a result, Batman movies have offered some of the strangest scenes depicted in the DC Universe.
Throughout Batman movie history, the hero has seen varying characterizations and depictions. From the campy, groovy era in the 1960s, to Tim Burton&#39;s gothic interpretation, the franchise has varied wildly in tone. This continued further with Joel Schumacher&#39;s neon-tinged Gotham City before Christopher Nolan&#39;s gritty realism grounded the franchise in a more believable setting. Nevertheless, when considering the entire franchise, Batman movies have featured some incredibly weird scenes.
            
 
 Every Batman Movie Ranked Worst To Best (Including The Batman) 
Batman has taken many forms on the silver screen across decades of cinematic history. Here&#39;s how each movie stacks up against the others.












 








 10  Batman&#39;s Infamous Credit Card 
Batman &amp; Robin (1997)


 







 Batman &amp; Robin 


  Release Date    June 20, 1997     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    George Clooney , Chris O&#39;Donnell     Runtime    125minutes    


Batman &amp; Robin is infamous for nearly destroying the entire franchise, with numerous preposterous moments, campy dialogue, and over-the-top antics. During one particularly weird scene, the eponymous crime-fighting duo are enchanted by Poison Ivy and enter a bidding war to win an evening in her company. The silliness culminates in Batman attempting to demonstrate his enormous wealth, revealing a Bat-branded credit card. This completely undermines the dark and serious tone established in the earlier movies, introducing a brief moment of absurdity that raises more questions than it was likely intended to. The scene has since become emblematic of Batman &amp; Robin&#39;s legacy, reflecting an absurd and eccentric oddity.





 9  The Riddler&#39;s Dramatic Demise 
Batman Forever (1995)


 







  Batman Forever  


  Release Date    June 16, 1995     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Tommy Lee Jones , Drew Barrymore , Chris O&#39;Donnell , Val Kilmer , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough , Debi Mazar     Runtime    117 Minutes    


Jim Carrey&#39;s Riddler proffered several weird scenes in Batman Forever, portraying the character with his trademark exuberance, which was somewhat out of place. One of the most bizarre was Riddler&#39;s final defeat, after his mind-draining invention malfunctions. The Riddler&#39;s once flamboyant and manic demeanor transformed into a dejected and deformed figure, with smeared make-up and a misshapen skull. His final nonchalant line, &#34;Bummer!&#34; only punctuated the strangeness of the scene, feeling incongruous with the wider franchise. The distinctive blend of tragedy and the surreal made Riddler&#39;s demise in Batman Forever one of the most memorable scenes in the movie.





 8  Michael Keaton&#39;s &#34;Let&#39;s Get Nuts&#34; Scene 
Batman (1989)
        

  Batman (1989)  


  Release Date    June 23, 1989     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger , Billy Dee Williams , Robert Wuhl , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough     Runtime    126 Minutes    


Michael Keaton&#39;s iconic &#34;Let&#39;s get nuts&#34; line from Batman has endured as an iconic Batman scene. It depicted the Joker arriving at Vicki Vale&#39;s apartment and being confronted by Michael Keaton&#39;s Bruce Wayne. Arming himself with a metal tray and an iron poker, Batman yelled the infamous line, to which Joker chillingly responded: &#34;Have you ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?&#34; The scene was necessary in establishing Burton&#39;s new Batman backstory and setting up essential plot points. However, the scene still feels very out of place, with Bruce Wayne&#39;s effortlessly cool facade dropping completely. The strange scene was the first hint at the two characters&#39; similarities.





 7  Batman Tries To Dispose Of A Bomb 
Batman: The Movie (1966)
        

In 1966&#39;s Batman: The Movie, Batman&#39;s comical struggle to dispose of a bomb is a classic and whimsical moment that perfectly captures the campy, comedic action that defined Adam West&#39;s Batman. As the Caped Crusader tried desperately to rid a Gotham City dockside of a ticking bomb, he repeatedly encountered obstacles that stopped him from disposing of the explosive. These include a marching band, two strolling nuns, a family of ducks, and a mother pushing a stroller. As each depiction of innocence is revealed, the scene becomes exponentially more absurd and humorous. The exaggerated suspense and preposterous predicament showcased the movie&#39;s campy tone and is a celebrated Batman scene.





 6  Superman Asks Batman To &#34;Save Martha&#34; 
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)
        

  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  


  Release Date    March 24, 2016     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot     Runtime    152 minutes    


The &#34;Save Martha&#34; scene in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice remains a divisive and peculiar moment in the DCEU. As Batman prepares to deliver a fatal blow to Superman, the Man of Steel&#39;s plea to &#34;Save Martha&#34; creates an unexpected connection. Both heroes, realizing their mothers share the same name (Martha), put their differences on hold. While the movie&#39;s intention to humanize Superman was clear, the execution garnered criticism for its contrived and inelegant nature. Superman&#39;s choice to use &#34;Martha&#34; instead of &#34;mother&#34; stood out as an odd moment that took many audiences out of the very serious scene.





 5  Catwoman Takes A Feline Bath 
Batman Returns (1992)


 







  Batman Returns  


  Release Date    June 19, 1992     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Danny DeVito , Michelle Pfeiffer , Christopher Walken , Michael Gough , Michael Murphy     Runtime    126minutes    


In Batman Returns, a peculiar and sensual scene depicted Michelle Pfeiffer&#39;s Catwoman taking a bath. The scene occurs in the Penguin&#39;s mayoral headquarters, where the villain is visited by Catwoman. Living up to her namesake, Catwoman licks the length of her arm before stroking her head to emulate a cat&#39;s grooming. The scene bolstered Catwoman&#39;s feline sensuality, and perfectly highlighted the Penguin&#39;s lecherous and clumsy attempts to seduce Catwoman. Tim Burton&#39;s distinctive visual style and Pfeiffer&#39;s captivating performance make this intimate moment an intriguing, albeit unconventional, exploration of Catwoman&#39;s identity and the duality of her existence in the dark, fantastical world of Gotham.





 4  Batman&#39;s Shark Repellent Bat Spray 
Batman: The Movie (1966)
        

Batman: The Movie&#39;s the shark-repellent scene stands out as a comically absurd scene that feels entirely superfluous. Batman, suspended from a helicopter ladder, is attacked by a shark, which quickly clamps onto his leg. Calling up to Robin for assistance, Batman requests the &#34;Shark Repellent Bat Spray.&#34; Discharging the weapon in the creature&#39;s face neutralizes the shark, which promptly falls into the ocean, exploding upon impact. The scene exemplifies the campy and whimsical tone of the 1960s Batman, as the Caped Crusader&#39;s preparedness reaches ludicrous levels. This lighthearted and ridiculous approach became a defining aspect of the movie, demonstrating the playful spirit of the vintage Batman franchise.





 3  The Joker Dresses As A Nurse 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

  The Dark Knight  


  Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes    


In The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker dons a nurse&#39;s uniform in a brilliantly chaotic scene. Disguised, the Joker infiltrates the hospital where Harvey Dent is recovering, revealing himself by pulling down his surgical mask. The scene is gleefully silly, contrasting the Joker&#39;s strange appearance against the gravity of the moment. This continues as the Joker wanders out of the hospital and triggers a devastating explosion. The disguise reflects the Joker&#39;s penchant for theatricality and his disregard for societal norms. It&#39;s a visually striking and unsettling sequence, demonstrating the character&#39;s twisted sense of humor and adding to the movie&#39;s overall intensity and the enigmatic nature of Ledger&#39;s incredible performance.





 2  Alfred Sees Batman And Catwoman In Italy 
The Dark Knight Rises (2012)
        

  The Dark Knight Rises  


  Release Date    August 16, 2012     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Christian Bale , Anne Hathaway , Michael Caine , Gary Oldman     Runtime    2h 45m    


In The Dark Knight Rises, the poignant conclusion sees Alfred spotting Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle in a café in Italy. Alfred previously suggested the scenario as a fitting goodbye for the two. It was presented as a highly emotional moment, symbolizing Bruce&#39;s triumphant escape from his vigilante life, and confirming his safety to his former guardian. While certainly compelling, particularly considering Michael Caine&#39;s heartfelt performance, the scene makes little sense. Alfred has spent decades caring for Bruce, yet the hero doesn&#39;t find a way to contact him after the movie&#39;s dramatic climax, but he does contact Catwoman. Additionally, it&#39;s unclear how Batman would know when Alfred would visit Italy.





 1  Robin Wears Rubber Lips To Fight Poison Ivy 
Batman &amp; Robin (1997)
        

Batman &amp; Robin proffered another strange scene, that felt incongruous even in Schumacher&#39;s campy movie. During an intense confrontation with Poison Ivy, Robin dons rubber lips to combat Ivy&#39;s deadly kiss. The anticlimactic scene reflects the movie&#39;s tone, with the rubber lips serving as a visual metaphor for the movie&#39;s departure from the darker elements of the Batman mythos. Moreover, wax lips are unlikely to counter Poison Ivy&#39;s incredibly deadly kiss, which just makes the whole scene seem ill-thought-through. The scene&#39;s weirdness contributes to the movie&#39;s reputation as an absurd caricature of the famed superheroes and was one of the strangest scenes from the entire Batman movie franchise.
