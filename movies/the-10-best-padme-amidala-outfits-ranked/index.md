## Literature Review

Padmé Amidala one of the best characters in the Star Wars prequel era, most notably because of her sense of fashion. Here are her 10 best outfits.




Because Star Wars takes place in a galaxy far, far away, the outfits that come out of the franchise are iconic, especially those of Senator Padmé Amidala. The queen-turned-Senator from Naboo may have some of the best fashion in all of Star Wars, with her outfits changing almost constantly during the prequel movies. Padmé often dressed up, but was also often ready for battle with functional outfits that somehow were still stunning.
Padmé’s style changed throughout the prequel trilogy. Because Padme was queen of Naboo in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, her outfits were often extravagant and a bit over the top, but something truly fit for a queen. However, in Star WarsEpisode: II - Attack of the Clones, Padmé’s fashion became more strategic, though still stunning. Padmé was able to balance being taken seriously within the Senate with smart and tactile outfits that aided her in any potential battle. Star Wars Episode: III - Revenge of the Sith saw Padmé pregnant, and while she didn’t see much action, her fashion was elegant, very fitting for a soon-to-be-mother. Here are her 10 best outfits from her lifetime.

 10  Clone Wars Senate Dress 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
        

Padmé’s skills as a senator were really able to shine through her appearances in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated show. Padmé was often shown in this outfit in the Senate chamber. The look is reflective of her live-action outfits from Attack of the Clones and is elegant, but it also gives audiences context clues as to what to expect from her character in these scenes. While the dress is one of Padmé’s best, it’s not quite as iconic as some of her other looks.





 9  Green Velvet Cloak Dress 
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith
        

Padmé’s green velvet dress from Revenge of the Sith made her look powerful. Not only did the long dress help hide Padmé&#39;s pregnancy, but it also commanded any room she was in. The dress can be seen about halfway through Revenge of the Sith and is only in one scene, which takes place right before Anakin Skywalker pledges himself to Darth Sidious. However, this dress was originally meant to have a lot more screentime, as it was the dress Padmé wore during her cut political storyline that included the formation of what would later become the Rebel Alliance. These deleted scenes can still be viewed, and are considered canon events.





 8  Wedding Dress 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones
        

While Padmé Amidala’s and Anakin Skywalker’s wedding was witnessed by few, Padmé’s wedding dress is by far one of her most intricate and beautiful. One of the things that makes Padmé’s wedding dress so special is the story behind it. The gown was made in just one night by one of Padmé’s former handmaidens, Yané. The veil was actually made by Padmé herself, with the help of some sewing bots. The intricacies of the dress also reflect the Naboo culture and wedding rituals, making the dress that much cooler. While Padmé wasn’t seen in the dress for long, it is still one of her most iconic outfits.





 7  Funeral Dress 
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith
        

One of the most heartbreaking moments of the entire Star Wars prequels came when Padmé Amidala died soon after giving birth to her twins, Luke and Leia. Dying of apparent heartbreak, Padmé was given a funeral on her home world Naboo with many of her friends and allies in attendance. Her dress had a water-like theme and showed off Padmé’s apparent pregnant belly—which was done to make people seeking Anakin and Padmé’s children believe they had died along with their mother. The aqua blue dress paired with Padmé’s hair fanned around her and fresh flowers made her look peaceful, even if her death was nothing but tragic.





 6  Yellow Meadow Dress 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones


 







While Padmé was on Naboo being protected by Anakin Skywalker, she wore a yellow dress while they went on a picnic. The dress is not only gorgeous, but is also featured in one of the best Star Wars memes of recent times. The yellow dress features pink hand-sewn roses as well as pastel ribbons that adorn her wrists. The thing that ties her whole outfit together is her hair, which is situated in two buns on the sides of her head, and the ribbon holding them in place which matches her dress, though it brings out more darker hues and has more noticeable flowers.





 5  Mission Outfit 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
        

One of the most interesting things about Padmé is that she wasn’t afraid of doing the dirty work if it meant that the galaxy would be a safer and more equitable place. She did her best to argue for all life forms and often put herself in harm’s way to protect others. Padmé’s brown pants and high boots were complimented by her dark pink vest. The outfit was fashionable, yet functional for any kind of adversaries the senator encountered. Her belt was even equipped with a blaster holster. The outfit is even featured in Timothy Zahn’s canon novel Thrawn Ascendancy: Chaos Rising, where Padmé and Anakin go on a mission to Batuu.

Padmé Amidala holds a special place in the hearts of Star Wars fans. Not only was she a great diplomat but she also had many iconic lines too. 








 4  Battle Handmaiden 
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
        

There’s no doubt that Padmé was an amazing queen to the people of Naboo, so much so that they even wanted to change their laws to keep her in power. This may have to do with the way Padmé was involved in protecting Naboo from the Trade Federation in The Phantom Menace. One of Padmé’s most iconic moments came while adorning this tactile dress when she revealed that she was the real queen of Naboo and not her decoy. The outfit is simple, but its detailing and Padmé’s ability to move and run in it makes it worthy of being near the top of this list.





 3  Lake Dress 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones
        

Padmé can be seen in this gorgeous ombré dress while on Naboo in Attack of the Clones. As Padmé shows Anakin around her homeworld, she recounts her school days and her love of swimming. The backless dress is truly stunning, and it’s no wonder why it’s the same scene where Anakin and Padmé share their first kiss. This dress was also present when Anakin gave his infamous “I hate sand” monologue. The scene and the dress are synonymous with Star Wars and therefore, by far, is one of Padmé’s best outfits, not to mention the amount of Star Wars cosplayers who honor this look.





 2  Arena Outfit 
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones


 







Padmé’s all-white outfit that she wore in Attack of the Clones exudes power, poise, and preparedness for a fight at any moment. The outfit has a couple of different variations, one including a white cape, and after the arena battle began, Padmé’s top became ripped, exposing her stomach. It was also one of the few times Padmé Amidala can be seen wearing pants in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. This outfit has become iconic when it comes to Padmé’s wardrobe. Its versatile, stylish, and pure white color represents the goodness in Padmé and that, while she’s fighting the Separatists, she’s still on the side of peace for all.





 1  Senate Red Dress 
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace


 







The red dress that Padmé wears when calling for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Vallorum screams royalty. It’s eye-catching, extravagant, and makes her look powerful. That, coupled with her hair and white makeup, further alludes to the outfit’s Japanese origins. This was one of the first moments in The Phantom Menace that audiences saw Padmé show off her leadership, power, and intellect in a way that helped change people’s hearts and minds. It’s exactly what made Padmé an incredible Senator. The red Senate dress Padmé wore will forever go down as one of, if not the most, iconic fashion pieces the queen-turned-Senator from Naboo ever wore in Star Wars.
