## Literature Review

Blumhouse&#39;s Wolf Man reboot has been a long-gestating project, but will the upcoming monster movie ever see the light of day? 




Another of Universal&#39;s classic monsters, The Wolf Man, is being remade, but not much is known about the long-gestating project. Ever since the failed Dark Universe, Universal has adopted a different plan to resurrect their classic monsters, which include characters such as Dracula, The Mummy, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, and The Invisible Man. The studio decided to shift focus onto standalone stories over interconnectivity and shared cinematic universes, which has been difficult to achieve in the horror genre.




The first movie to be launched with these new stipulations and focus was Leigh Whannell&#39;s The Invisible Man, which was released in 2020. The scaled-back and creepy standalone horror movie proved to be a massive success and immediately proved the new direction for the monsters was working. Around that same time, the remake of The Wolf Man was also announced, but updates regarding the classic monster&#39;s return have been few and far between ever since.


 The Wolf Man Latest News 
          

Not long after it was announced that Ryan Gosling was departing the project, the latest news regarding the monster remake sees Julia Garner join the cast of the embattled remake of The Wolf Man. The rising star is most known for her role as Ruth Langmore on Ozark, and she will be playing an as-yet-unnamed mother who protects her family from the vicious lycanthrope. So far, Garner is the only other actor attached to the project, alongside Christopher Abbott, who is playing the eponymous character. 






 The Wolf Man Is Confirmed 
          

Despite all the turbulence in the project as of late, The Wolf Man is confirmed and has been since the project was first announced in 2020. Universal and Blumhouse wasted no time in striking while the iron was hot, and the success of The Invisible Man was likely the biggest catalyst for the reinvention of the Monster universe. Though The Wolf Man hasn&#39;t seemed to move forward in years, it is still on the slate.



 The Wolf Man Cast 
          

Like the rest of the project, not a lot is known about the cast of The Wolf Man, though a few big names have been attached since Ryan Gosling departed. First, it was announced that Christopher Abbott (Sanctuary) would be stepping in to play the title character. Additionally, Ozark star Julia Garner has been added to the cast of The Wolf Man as an as-yet-unnamed mother who is attacked by the werewolf and must protect her family. More names are expected as the project gets closer to production. 






 How The Wolf Man Connects To The Monster&#39;s Universe 
          

Ever since the failure of Universal Dark Universe, the state of the monsters has been somewhat unclear. The release of 2020&#39;s The Invisible Man proved that fans still wanted to see the Classic Monsters if they were given a fresh and modern twist. With that in mind, it makes sense that The Wolf Man has taken so long, since Blumhouse and Universal are probably trying to find the best way to expand the universe without overreaching.

As it stands now, it isn&#39;t known exactly how The Wolf Man remake fits into a larger universe or if it even does. Universal&#39;s Classic Monsters are renowned for creating the first cinematic universe, but that was after years of work and a slew of successful standalone movies. The most likely scenario is that The Wolf Man remake will be a singular work, and if it is a hit, it could be tied to other films later.
