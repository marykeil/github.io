## SUMMARY 



  FNAF: Help Wanted 2 continues the series&#39; focus on VR/AR and takes place between Security Breach and its DLC, Ruin.   William Afton&#39;s Glitchtrap is currently a key villain in the FNAF games and could have a significant role in the movie&#39;s continuity.

## Literature Review

Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2 makes one plot point more likely to occur in a Five Nights at Freddy’s movie sequel — and it changes things.





Summary

  FNAF: Help Wanted 2 continues the series&#39; focus on VR/AR and takes place between Security Breach and its DLC, Ruin.   William Afton&#39;s Glitchtrap is currently a key villain in the FNAF games and could have a significant role in the movie&#39;s continuity.   Vanessa&#39;s backstory in the FNAF movie changes from the games: she is revealed to be William Afton&#39;s daughter, so future films could potentially build on that dynamic.  







Given the focus of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2, the latest entry in the long-running game series, one recurring plot point is even more likely to figure into a potential Five Nights at Freddy’s movie sequel. Created by Scott Cawthon, the first FNAF game is a point-and-click survival horror game that puts players in the shoes of Mike Schmidt, a nighttime security guard at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza. After the first game became a viral sensation in 2014, FNAF spawned an ultra-successful multimedia franchise consisting of 10 mainline games (and several spin-offs), comic books, novels, and, of course, the 2023 live-action film.

Blumhouse&#39;s Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s broke box office records, garnering $294.9 million worldwide. While it takes most of its inspiration from the first FNAF game, it isn&#39;t a one-to-one adaptation. Josh Hutcherson&#39;s Mike fights to maintain custody of his sister, Abby (Piper Rubio), while dealing with (seemingly) homicidal animatronics and unraveling the decades-old abduction of his brother, Garrett (Lucas Grant). In true FNAF fashion, everything leads back to series antagonist William Afton (Matthew Lillard). That said, the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie has its own continuity, which means any upcoming sequels or spin-offs could pull elements from various entries in the beloved game series.





 FNAF: Help Wanted 2 Continues The Series’ Focus On VR 
          

Like the original Help Wanted, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Help Wanted 2 is a virtual-reality survival horror game. In terms of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s timeline, Help Wanted 2 takes place between Security Breach and that game&#39;s DLC, Ruin. Notably, Security Breach unfolds in Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Mega Pizzaplex, a multi-level arcade-meets-restaurant ​​​​​that&#39;s packed with attractions dedicated to Fazbear Entertainment&#39;s animatronic characters. Gamers play as a youngster named Gregory who gets trapped inside the Mega Pizzaplex after hours. With the help of Glamrock Freddy, a kindly animatronic, Gregory must outrun Freddy&#39;s virus-infected animatronic brethren; a meddling security guard named Vanessa; and the mysterious Vanny.




Despite Security Breach&#39;s many endings, it&#39;s teased that Vanessa is the sadistic Vanny. The human in the rabbit suit was corrupted by the digital virus Glitchtrap, a key FNAF antagonist. In Ruin, the Security Breach DLC, a young girl named Cassie searches the mall for Gregory. Notably, Cassie is equipped with a Security Mask — an advanced headset that allows her to view the AR World and interact with the systems that control the Pizzaplex&#39;s electronics. That mall-controlling interface is called the Virtual Augmented Neural Network Integration unit — or V.A.N.N.I. Aptly, both the mask and the Mega Pizzaplex return in FNAF: Help Wanted 2.



 William Afton’s Glitchtrap Is Five Nights At Freddy’s Current Key Villain 
         

The FNAF movie&#39;s &#34;I always come back&#34; tease is a reference to serial child murder William Afton&#39;s resilience. In the games, the Fazbear Entertainment co-founder is directly responsible for most of the fatal events that occur in the restaurants. When Afton dies, physically speaking, his corpse ends up in the Springtrap animatronic suit (FNAF 3), and he somehow clings to this side of the mortal coil. This corpse-infused, resurrected version of the character is referred to as Scraptrap in Security Breach. While the games&#39; lore is notoriously complex, the FNAF Wiki suggests that Glitchtrap is likely a manifestation of Afton, who&#39;s assuming the form of a digital virus.




All of this to say, William Afton refuses to truly die or fade away. When his physical form was too damaged to soldier on, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s found a way to carry on Afton&#39;s &#34;spirit&#34; or will. With Glitchtrap being a key antagonist in more recent FNAF releases, from Help Wanted and Help Wanted 2 to Security Breach, it would make sense for future FNAF movies to capitalize on the character&#39;s relevance and popularity. At the end of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, Spring Bonnie crushes Afton, who promises to return. This certainly leaves the door open for Springtrap — and, later, Glitchtrap.



 Vanessa Is Part Of The Movie Canon &amp; More Recent FNAF Games 
         

The Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie changes Vanessa&#39;s backstory from the games. Instead of being a mall security guard, she&#39;s a small-town cop. More importantly, however, she&#39;s revealed to be William Afton&#39;s daughter in the film&#39;s continuity. This is a huge departure from the FNAF games, in which Mike is one of Afton&#39;s three children, while Vanessa is unrelated to the brood. Not only does this change suggest that the FNAF movie&#39;s Mike is related to a different character from the franchise, but it strengthens Vanessa&#39;s ties to William. With signs pointing toward the games&#39; Glitchtrap being Afton, it would make sense to build on William and Vanessa&#39;s dynamic. 




At the end of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, Vanessa is understandably livid with her serial killer father. Their reunion takes another shocking turn when Afton tries to strangle his daughter to death. While Vanessa survives the encounter, she&#39;s shown to be in the intensive care unit of a hospital, and possibly in a coma, just before the credits roll. In a particularly vulnerable state, Vanessa might become Afton&#39;s target, much like in the games, forcing her to reluctantly assume the role of Vanny. While the AR-revealing V.A.N.N.I. mask seems more like a meta, gameplay element of Ruin, it could still work in a movie sequel.



 A FNAF Movie Sequel’s Use Of VR Can Help It Stand Out 
          

During Help Wanted 2, the unnamed player character is hired by Fazbear Entertainment to complete a series of maintenance tasks. Meanwhile, the ever-looming Glitchtrap is starting to seize control of the Mega Pizzaplex&#39;s animatronics, making them hostile toward the employee. However, the ending of FNAF: Help Wanted 2 reveals something truly shocking: the player character has been wearing a Security Mask the whole time. That means they&#39;ve been plugged into the Mega Pizzaplex&#39;s V.A.N.N.I. network for the duration of the game. While completing tasks in a fake world, they were actually wandering the abandoned Pizzaplex from games like Ruin.




Like with Vanessa&#39;s storyline in Security Breach, the mask has allowed Glitchtrap to access the player character&#39;s mind. Later, the character, whose consciousness is put in a Staffbot, passes on the V.A.N.N.I. mask to Cassie, thus starting the events of Ruin. Not only does Help Wanted 2 show off just how convincing the world of the mask can be, but it explores a whole new facet of FNAF lore and story. The VR/AR plot thread could be a great way to make a Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s sequel feel fresh, all while tapping into themes relevant to the present moment.
