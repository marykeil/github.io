## Literature Review

Some movies include such incredibly beautiful depictions of nature that they make us want to give it all up for a life in the countryside.




There are certain movies that, through their incredible depiction of the wonders of nature, make viewers want to give it all up and move to the countryside. While so many movies have focused on the hustle and bustle of urban living, those that paid attention to the effervescent power of the rural countryside have often made audiences rethink their entire lives and imagine what it would be like to start a new, more simple existence away from the struggles of modernity. The draw of the countryside has always represented escapism and a connection to the natural world.
Movies have made audiences want to move to the countryside through a variety of factors. Some character-driven films presented a world that felt a million miles away from the cutthroat and self-aggrandizing people who populated metropolises and the urban landscape. Other depicted picturesque scenery and natural settings in a way that made filmgoers wonder why they have wasted so many years struggling day-by-day in big cities. Movies such as these have the power to make those who see them rethink their entire lives and wish they could pack it all in for a life in the countryside.









 








 10  The Straight Story (1999) 
Directed by David Lynch
        

Perhaps the most straightforward narrative ever told by surrealist film director David Lynch, The Straight Story was a true tale of brotherly love that took viewers across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawnmower guided by a 73-year-old man. As the elderly Alvin Straight, whose legs and eyes were too impaired to get a driver&#39;s license, traveled across America to reconcile with his dying estranged brother, viewers were introduced to a host of characters and were confronted with the beauty of rural life and the kindness of strangers. The Straight Story explored peace, perseverance, and pride in a movie about letting the past be the past and enjoying the present.





 9  Brokeback Mountain (2005) 
Directed by Ang Lee
        

  Brokeback Mountain  


  Release Date    January 13, 2006     Director    Ang Lee     Cast    Jake Gyllenhaal , Heath Ledger , Michelle Williams     Runtime    134 minutes    


The beauty and simplicity of rural life depicted in Brokeback Mountain felt like an authentic representation of southern Cowboys in the 1960s who discovered a deep forbidden love for one another. An epic romantic drama with incredible performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, this compassionate observation of Western lives was packed with vast countryside landscapes that evoked a sense of freedom and escape from societal expectations. While Brokeback Mountain was not explicitly about giving it all up for a life in the country, it certainly showcased the power of finding connections and meaning surrounded by the wonders of nature.





 8  The Sound Of Music (1965) 
Directed by Robert Wise


 







  The Sound of Music  


  Release Date    March 2, 1965     Director    Robert Wise     Cast    Julie Andrews , Christopher Plummer , Richard Haydn , Peggy Wood , Charmian Carr , Elanor Parker     Runtime    174 minutes    


The Sound of Music was one of the most iconic musicals of all time whose songs are beloved by viewers of all ages and whose scenic setting in Salzburg, Austria beautifully depicted the marvels of the countryside. Despite the World War II context of The Sound of Music, the film remained idealistic and stood the test of time as a testament to the power of family, music, and resilience. With nature as an effective visual backdrop, the Austrian Alps and outdoor activities of The Sound of Music made for a timeless story of genuine wonder and acted as an ode to escapism.





 7  Captain Fantastic (2016) 
Directed by Matt Ross
        

 Captain Fantastic 


  Release Date    July 2, 2016     Director    Matt Ross     Cast    Viggo Mortensen , George MacKay , Sami Isler , Annalise Basso , Nicholas Hamilton , Shree Crooks     Runtime    114 minutes    


Captain Fantastic featured a family living off-grid in the mountainous Washington wilderness and spoke to the power of rejecting societal expectations and forging a unique path. Starring Viggo Mortensen as a father disillusioned with capitalism and the American way of life, he has instilled survivalist skills and left-wing politics in his six children, who he educated to think critically and live without modern technology. While the lives seen in Captain Fantastic looked extreme, they also shone a light on modern overreliance on technology and presented an alternate way of living that was more in line with humans’ natural impulses and innate nature.





 6  Moonrise Kingdom (2012) 
Directed by Wes Anderon
        

  Moonrise Kingdom  


  Release Date    June 21, 2012     Director    Wes Anderson     Cast    Bill Murray , Kara Hayward , Bruce Willis , Jason Schwartzman , Edward Norton     Runtime    94minutes    


A coming-of-age drama by Wes Anderson, Moonrise Kingdom followed the love story between an orphaned scout and his troubled pen pal and was a beautiful depiction of innocence, longing, and youth. The campground setting of Moonrise Kingdom mixed with Anderson’s signature aesthetic brought to mind a nostalgic depiction of childhood adventure that transcended time and place. The world Anderson created with Moonrise Kingdom had an unpredictable environment yet felt imaginative and aspirational. While the themes of Moonrise Kingdom signaled the end of childhood, they brought up the need to hang on to wonder and a connection with nature.





 5  Little Women (2019) 
Directed by Greta Gerwig


 







  Little Women  


  Release Date    December 25, 2019     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Emma Watson , Timothee Chalamet , Bob Odenkirk , Florence Pugh , Eliza Scanlen , Abby Quinn , Lilly Englert , Chris Cooper , James Norton , Sasha Frolova , Meryl Streep , Saoirse Ronan , Laura Dern , Louis Garrel     Runtime    135 minutes    


The virtues of a simpler life depicted in Little Women have influenced readers’ desire to give it all up for a life in the country since Louisa May Alcott published the original novel in 1868. This feeling was compounded by the release of Greta Gerwig’s adaptation in 2019, whose beautiful cinematography, costume design, and depiction of the Massachusetts countryside made the story feel simultaneously nostalgic and timeless. The March sisters displaced a sense of close-knit family ties, and a connection to their community, that felt absent from modern urban living and brought up a desire to take up a simpler and more mindless way of life in the country.





 4  Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) 
Directed by Olivia Newman


 







  Where the Crawdads Sing  


  Release Date    July 15, 2022     Director    Olivia Newman     Cast    Daisy Edgar-Jones , Taylor John Smith , Harris Dickinson , Michael Hyatt , David Strathairn , Sterling Macer, Jr.     Runtime    126 minutes    


Based on the hugely successful novel by Delia Owens, Where the Crawdads Sing followed a strong-willed girl who lived in a North Carolina marsh in the 1950s. A tale of love, murder, and nature, Where the Crawdads Sings was a thrilling drama that featured rural living as something both delightful and difficult. The depictions of swamp land and a natural southern American environment were picturesque and pleasing, while the murder mystery at the heart of Where the Crawdads Sing remained dark, eerie, and haunting. A Southern Gothic story about love and betrayal, Where the Crawdads Sing had something for all viewers.





 3  A Good Year (2006) 
Directed by Ridley Scott
        

Following Russell Crowe as a British investment broker who inherited his uncle’s French château and vineyard, A Good Year was a romantic comedy that transported audiences to the south of France and felt like a warm invitation to stay for good. As Crowe discovered the benefits of a laid-back kind of life, it was easy to get swept away by its romantic setting, appetizing food and drink, and the depiction of a simpler life. While A Good Year bombed at the box office, it acted as an enjoyable piece of escapism for those wishing to pack in their job for a life of wining and dining in the French countryside.





 2  Big Fish (2003) 
Directed by Tim Burton
        

 Big Fish 


  Release Date    December 25, 2003     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Ewan McGregor , Albert Finney , Billy Crudup , Jessica Lange , Helena Bonham Carter , Alison Lohman     Runtime    125 minutes    


A beautiful father and son fairy tale, Big Fish starred Ewan McGregor as a teller of tall tales who created a fantastical fiction of his own life story. Big Fish explored the reconciliation between a dying father and his son through South Gothic vignettes that highlighted how sometimes imagined representations of real experiences can carry more weight than a straightforward true account of the facts. With many scenes that showcased the magic of the woodlands and the awe-inspiring floral blooming of spring, Big Fish demonstrated the beauty of the countryside and the power of embracing the magic of everyday living.





 1  Into The Wild (2007) 
Directed by Sean Penn
        

The true-life story of Chris McCandless, Into the Wild depicted an adventurer searching for meaning through the wonders of nature. Chris, who renamed himself Alexander Supertramp, gave up his privileged life, hiked across America, and eventually lived in an abandoned bus in the Alaskan wilderness. While Chris’s life story ended tragically, Into the Wild acted as a love letter to all those dissatisfied by the soul-crushing expectations of urban living and was a character study about someone who did not allow themselves to be confined by modern society&#39;s expectations of them. While Chris’s choices were extreme, Into the Wild encouraged viewers to embrace the beauty of nature and the countryside.
