## Literature Review

Jack Black is one of the most popular actors in Hollywood and his latest casting gives him a great new three-movie trend worth getting excited about.




Jack Black is one of the most popular and well-liked actors in the movie industry and his latest casting continues a surprising trend that spans three movies. Throughout his career, Black has always opted to take on more fun, family-orientated roles despite being such a popular name. Jack Black&#39;s best movies consist mostly of comedies and animated projects that can appeal to multiple generations. His comedic style has won over older generations, but by appearing in the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, he also appeals to the youth. His latest casting looks to once again cater to a younger audience.




After stealing the show as Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Jack Black has been cast in the Minecraft movie. Minecraft is one of the highest-selling video games of all time, making it no surprise it is the latest video game to be adapted into a film. With the movie likely to be a lighthearted comedy, Black is the perfect choice to lead the project. His popularity and experience in these kinds of roles will likely elevate an already star-studded cast that includes Jason Momoa and Pedro Pascal. Taking on this role continues a surprising trend for Black that confirms why the actor is loved by so many.


 Jack Black Has Now Been Cast In 3 Video Game Movies 
          

Minecraft is the third video game movie Jack Black has been cast in. Video game adaptations have become increasingly common in recent years and no one has been more on board with the trend than Jack Black. Alongside Minecraft, Black will also appear in Borderlands and has already featured as Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Jack Black&#39;s Bowser role in The Super Mario Bros. Movie was one of the best parts of the filmand showcased that even as a villain, Black can provide a lot of fun. He even created one of the most memorable parts of the cinematic adventure with his &#34;Peaches&#34; song.




Bowser is the main villain in the Mario franchise and Black will also play one of Borderlands&#39; key characters. He was cast in the Borderlands movie as Claptrap, who has appeared in everyone game in the franchise. Now, he will take on the role of Minecraft&#39;s protagonist, Steve. While other actors might want to stay away from these uncertain projects, Black is more than happy to take them on showing his willingness to participate in fun movies over serious ones. He is still a talented actor who can do far more than just comedy, but his openness to gaming movies is exactly why he is so easy to like.

                  The Minecraft Movie: Release Date, Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   At long last the Minecraft movie has a release date, and one of the biggest names in Hollywood is attached to the cast. Here&#39;s everything we know.   



 The Super Mario Bros. Movie Is A Very Good Sign For Jack Black&#39;s Video Game Movies 
          




After such a successful outing in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, Jack Black&#39;s future video game movies look positive. He was easily the best part of the Mario film, and while this doesn&#39;t guarantee things will be the same in his other projects, it is a good sign. There are plenty of exciting things to expect from the Borderlands movie and Jack Black as Claptrap stands out. The sarcastic robot is perfectly suited to Black&#39;s comedic style and his character will presumably be cracking jokes constantly at the rest of the cast. His role as Steve is much harder to predict given the character is a silent protagonist.

Although Minecraft does have a story, it is a game without dialogue. Telltale&#39;s Minecraft: Story Mode showed how Minecraft characters could be given personalities and Minecraft: The Movie will likely try and do something similar. This gives Black some creative freedom, much like Bowser did, which is encouraging. It is still too early to tell how well Borderlands and Minecraft will perform, but the success of Black&#39;s Bowser performance suggests things will be more positive than negative for his upcoming films. His Minecraft casting continuing his gaming movie trend proves the actor is all about fun franchises and his enthusiasm should result in more great performances.
