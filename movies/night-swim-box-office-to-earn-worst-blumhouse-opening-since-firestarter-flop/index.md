## Literature Review

The new horror movie Night Swim is projected to earn the lowest opening weekend for a Blumhouse wide release since the 2022 flop Firestarter.




Night Swim has broken a negative box office record for Blumhouse Productions. The new movie, which is the debut feature of writer-director Bryce McGuire, is based on his 2014 short film of the same name. It is the latest collaboration between Blumhouse and James Wan&#39;s Atomic Monster, following a family who moves into a new house only to discover that a supernatural entity haunts their pool, featuring a cast led by Kerry Condon and Wyatt Russell.




Per Deadline, the Night Swim release is projected to take in a total of $12.5 million at the domestic box office in its opening weekend. This will place it at No. 2 on the weekend chart below the holdover 2023 musical hit Wonka, which is in its fourth weekend in North America. This is the lowest-grossing debut for a wide-release Blumhouse movie opening in more than 1,000 theaters since their Firestarter remake took in $3.8 million during its first weekend in May 2022.


 Can Blumhouse&#39;s Other 2024 Movies Make Up For Night Swim? 
          

This lukewarm reception is likely partially due to the fact that Night Swim reviews have been largely negative, with the movie currently standing at 27% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although it&#39;s an original title as opposed to some of their recent hit IP-driven efforts like Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, since Firestarter, Blumhouse has also made hits of original projects like M3GAN, which opened during the same January window in 2023. Thus, its original nature may not be what has dampened this outing, which is the seventh major wide-release Blumhouse title since Firestarter.






Between Firestarter and Night Swim, Blumhouse released The Black Phone, Halloween Ends, M3GAN, Insidious: The Red Door, The Exorcist: Believer, and Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s.




It remains to be seen if Blumhouse&#39;s 2024 slate can make up for this initial misstep. So far, things have the potential to go well, as their March title Imaginary may capture the M3GAN audience with its chilling twist on a classic element of childhood. Also on the slate is the Universal Monster remake Wolf Man, which is set to be directed by Leigh Whannell, who previously helmed Blumhouse&#39;s critical and commercial hit The Invisible Man.

On top of all that, Night Swim isn&#39;t necessarily going to be a box office flop when all is said and done. It only cost $15 million and will likely have to make just $30 million or so to break even. Given the fact that Firestarter eventually made $15 million and the new movie opened well over twice that total, this is a distinct possibility. It remains to be seen if the possible Night Swim 2 is greenlit off that eventual result, but 2024 so far isn&#39;t a loss for Blumhouse despite this somewhat disappointing debut.
