## Literature Review



Ted Lasso’s Hannah Waddingham defends her Mission: Impossible 8 co-star Tom Cruise against critics. Waddingham will star alongside Cruise in 2025&#39;s Mission: Impossible 8, which remains untitled. It is the second part of the story that began with 2023&#39;s Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. Waddingham&#39;s character in the upcoming spy movie remains a mystery, though she will be joined by franchise alums Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Vanessa Kirby, Hayley Atwell, and Pom Klementieff. 




Speaking with Independent, Waddingham raves about her experience working with Cruise on the upcoming Mission: Impossible 8. After spending “five intense days” filming alongside Cruise on the USS George HW Bush fighter carrier, Waddingham has “a real problem with anybody that goes at him now.” Check out the full quote from the Emmy winner below: 


“I have to say, I have a real problem with anybody that goes at him now.
“He is without doubt one of the loveliest and encouraging, positive and inspiring human beings I have ever met. Isn’t he gorgeous? I have no time for anyone saying anything about him.”



 The Contentious Tom Cruise Debate Explained 
          

On one hand, Cruise is an A-list actor within Hollywood. Even at 61 years old, he is a massive action star involved in impressive stunts for movies like Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Top Gun: Maverick. He is also a decorated actor, having been nominated for three acting Oscars for Born on the Fourth of July, Jerry Maguire, and Magnolia.




Over the years, however, Cruise’s status has been tainted by a number of public controversies. Cruise has been involved in the Church of Scientology for decades, becoming an outspoken advocate for the group in the 2000s. Scientologists are known for controversial beliefs, many of which Cruise has reportedly subscribed to. In 2005, the star made headlines when he criticized actress Brooke Shields for opening up about her use of antidepressants for postpartum depression. 

These controversies have led to criticism of Cruise, which is sometimes matched or compounded by criticisms of his acting. After the release of Top Gun: Maverick, actor Mickey Rourke accused Cruise of “doing the same effing part for 35 years.” While still maintaining his A-list status, comments like these show the complications that come with Cruise’s success. Luckily, the actor still has the support of many co-stars, including Mission: Impossible 8’s Waddingham.
