 Josh Hutcherson Talks The Beekeeper 
         

Screen Rant: Can you discuss getting into the headspace of Derek and tapping into another side of yourself to portray a character like this? Because this had to be a ton of fun for you.





Josh Hutcherson: It was so much fun, man. It&#39;s been one of the biggest joys that I&#39;ve gotten to have in a long time of playing a character. I mean, this guy is just so unhinged and out there and out of his mind.
As an actor, when you have a character that&#39;s that wild, if you do the work of constructing him in a truthful way and finding what really makes him tick, you have the freedom to just throw caution to the wind and just go for it. And David Ayer, our director, really gave me the space and the support to really go for it. It was so much fun; I absolutely loved it.


You had the chance to share the screen with the legendary Jeremy Irons. He&#39;s fantastic in this film too. Can you talk about Derek&#39;s relationship with Jeremy&#39;s character, Wallace Westwyld, and your experience working with Jeremy on The Beekeeper?


Josh Hutcherson: Yeah, absolutely. Westwyld is basically Derek&#39;s minion right-hand man, kind of like Derek gets to boss him around and treats him like trash the entire time and makes him do his dirty work. For me, going into it knowing that I was going to be treating Jeremy Irons that way was really exciting.
To take an actor that&#39;s so respected and with the gravitas and everything and just be a little punk brat to him the whole time, it was great, and he&#39;s a dream to work with. Super funny, really laid back, really nice, and he loves the improv stuff as well. I was definitely nervous in some moments of throwing some stuff pretty hard at him, but yeah, he took it well.





If the film is the Queen Bee and the production crew is the hive, David Ayer has to be the beekeeper. Can you talk about working with David on this film? Because his directing style for action is incredible.


Josh Hutcherson: Yeah, David&#39;s extremely collaborative across the board with all the departments and everything. He has a very clear vision of how he wants to execute things, and he&#39;s an amazing, amazing leader, but what was cool for me working with David was watching someone master the action and knowing where to put the camera and seeing the movie edited in his mind as we&#39;re going, and then also the care to detail of the actors and the performances and the character construction.
It&#39;s very cool to see somebody that really can do all of that, and the movie needed it, because I think without the great action, the movie doesn&#39;t work, and without the story and the characters, it doesn&#39;t work. So, he pulled it all together.


You recently hit it out of the park with Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, and you recently said they&#39;re working on a sequel What do you want to see from Mike&#39;s story next?





Josh Hutcherson: Oh, man. I think we kind of tap into the world a bit with him playing with the dream world and the reality, so I have a feeling that he&#39;s going to dive deeper into that to try to get some more answers about his brother&#39;s disappearance, maybe even try to find a way to leap between the dream world and the reality world. I feel like that could be a place it goes to.
But honestly, the lore of the games is so dense and there&#39;s so much material there that they can take this thing a million different directions. I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re trying to figure out now, is they have so many potential doorways to walk through, I think they&#39;re kind of figuring all that stuff out right now.


The Ballad of Songbird and Snakes has reawakened this love of The Hunger Games franchise. Would you want to revisit Peeta and Katniss&#39;s story on screen?


Josh Hutcherson: Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, I think getting me and Jen and Liam and Woody? If we get the whole gang back together, I&#39;m in 100%.





Last question I have for you, Josh. What is your favorite Jason Statham movie besides The Beekeeper?


Josh Hutcherson: I was going to say The Beekeeper. Well, you took that answer from me.
I love The Transporter movies. Those are great, man, especially when I was a bit younger. I loved cars and all that stuff, and he&#39;s just so badass in that. He&#39;s great in everything, though, and he&#39;s a guy that does the impossible and you believe that it&#39;s possible. It&#39;s always fun to watch him.
