## Literature Review

R. L. Stine gives a positive filming update on Netflix&#39;s Fear Street 4, detailing the specific book from the original run that it will be adapting.




Fear Street 4 has gotten a very positive update from author R.L. Stine. The movie will be a follow-up to Netflix&#39;s Fear Street trilogy from 2021, which adapted characters and elements from the series of young adult novels by Goosebumps author Stine. The trilogy told a series of interconnected stories set in the towns of Sunnyvale and Shadyside, taking place in 1994, 1978, and 1666. The ensemble cast of the trilogy included Kiana Madeira, Olivia Scott Welch, Benjamin Flores Jr., Sadie Sink, Maya Hawke, and Ted Sutherland.




On Twitter, R.L. Stine made the announcement that the upcoming Fear Street 4 is preparing to go into production. Check out his announcement below:


 

Stine confirmed that Netflix will again be behind the new installment in the franchise after previously acquiring the rights to the first trilogy from Fox. He also announced that it&#39;s based on the fifteenth Fear Street book, 1992&#39;s The Prom Queen.


 What Will Fear Street 4 Be About? 
          

Stine&#39;s announcement does not make it clear how much the new movie will be linked to the original trilogy. So far, no returning Fear Street cast members have been confirmed. The fact that the movie will be based on a specific book rather than the amalgam presented in the trilogy could also mean that this will be a standalone installment, in spite of Netflix&#39;s continued involvement.






The Fear Street trilogy cast also included Fred Hechinger, Gillian Jacobs, Ryan Simpkins, and Emily Rudd.




It&#39;s possible that some of the characters from the 1994 timeline could return, however. The Prom Queen is also set in Shadyside, just like that entry. It&#39;s also possible that the storyline, about five candidates for prom queen who are being murdered one by one, could be retrofitted to include one or more of those characters. However, it seems more likely that any returning characters would be supporting cast members rather than part of the core quintet of prom queens.

Ultimately, it seems that Fear Street 4 will probably honor the legacy of the Fear Street trilogy by continuing its homage to classic horror rather than reprising any particular interconnected elements. The story&#39;s slasher element means the movie could continue being a throwback to classic horror, particularly the Prom Night franchise, which includes four movies and a remake. This would tie in well with the Scream-esque Part One and the Friday the 13th-inspired Part Two, even if no characters from those movies return.
