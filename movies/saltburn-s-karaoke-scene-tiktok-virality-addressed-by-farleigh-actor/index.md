Summary

  Archie Madekwe, who plays Farleigh in Saltburn, reacts to his now-viral karaoke sequence.   Madekwe addresses whether he would release a full single of &#34;Rent&#34; by the Pet Shop Boys, which is the karaoke song in question.   The actor confirms he has no plans to record the song, though his friends frequently send him TikToks of the scene.  







Saltburn’s Archie Madekwe addresses his viral karaoke scene from the hit film. Madekwe plays Farleigh Start, a member of the Catton family who is visiting the titular estate for the summer. Saltburn has received largely positive reviews and features a number of notable scenes that have gone viral online.

In a new TikTok from IndieWire, Madekwe discusses his viral karaoke scene. According to the actor, his friends are “constantly sending me TikToks” of Saltburn and edits of the karaoke scene. As a result, Madekwe has been asked whether he would release a full single of him singing the song “Rent.”


 

Madekwe admits that, despite the demands from fans, he will not release a full single of the song. Nonetheless, the actor is humbled and pleasantly surprised by all the attention Saltburn — and by extension his performance — has received.





 Saltburn’s Karaoke Scene Proves Why Farleigh Is a Great Character 
          

The scene in question occurs about halfway through Saltburn, when Farleigh, Oliver, and other guests at the estate are having a carefree karaoke night. Farleigh pressures Oliver, whom he believes to be of lower class economic status, to sing the song “Rent” by the Pet Shop Boys. Not only does Oliver not know the song well, but its lyrics feature lines that seem to call out Oliver for his ostensible economic disadvantages.

While this moment isn&#39;t an honorable one for Farleigh, it shows why his character is so essential in Saltburn. Farleigh is pretty wary of Oliver throughout, and he often goes out of his way to make a fool out of Oliver. At the time, this turns audiences against Farleigh and creates even more sympathy towards Oliver.

                  Saltburn&#39;s 10 Biggest Clues To Oliver&#39;s Real Plans &amp; Deceptions   Saltburn&#39;s ending is one of the wildest parts of the movie, but Oliver&#39;s true plans are subtly set up over 10 times throughout the film.   




However, this scene is brilliantly twisted after Saltburn&#39;s shocking ending reveals that Oliver had been lying and manipulating everyone all along. While public humiliation is still not a great approach for Farleigh, he faces unfair consequences later on when he is ousted prematurely from the Saltburn estate, as the Cattons believe that he encouraged their deceased son Felix to do lines of cocaine and then drink. The biting nature of the Saltburn karaoke scene only adds to Farleigh’s complexity, as, while still harsh, he turned out to be right in his suspicions towards Oliver.



Saltburn is currently available for streaming on Prime Video.
