## Literature Review

New details for the Titans featured in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire have been revealed in early merchandise for the upcoming Monsterverse film.




Merchandise from Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire has revealed new details about the film&#39;s Titans prior to the film&#39;s release. The upcoming Monsterverse movie will see its titular characters team up against the Skar King, a villainous ape that threatens the safety of the world. Other original Titans will also be introduced in the film, such as the baby Kong-like ape Suko.




Now, Kaiju News Outlet has posted images of four Playmates Toys, offering new details about the Titans ahead of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&#39;s release.


 

The images reveal the pink-colored &#34;Godzilla Evolved,&#34; alongside Kong&#39;s new weapon, dubbed the &#34;B.E.A.S.T. Glove.&#34; The Skar King&#39;s weapon is also given the name &#34;Whiplash,&#34; while Suko&#39;s toy reveals the Titan &#34;Doug&#34; who cameoed in Godzilla vs. Kong will be returning. Get a closer look at the new figures below:

         





 What The New Godzilla x Kong Figures Say About The Movie 
          

Many small details have been revealed about the new Monsterverse movie thanks to these toys. The origin of Kong&#39;s glove was once a mystery, but now it appears to have been designed by a group or industry named B.E.A.S.T. This group may play a key role in the film, perhaps supplying Kong and Godzilla alike with weapons to prevent destruction like Godzilla vs. Kong&#39;s ending from happening again.

The toys also confirm Godzilla has evolved somehow, with his new pink glow indicating a major shift in his powers. Additionally, the double pack of both Suko and Doug indicates the pair may have a connection similar to that between the movie&#39;s main Titans. Their direct involvement in the events of the movie may coincide with the Skar King fighting the film&#39;s heroes.




                  MonsterVerse: Godzilla/Kong Movie Timeline Explained   From the ancient origins of the Titans to the global outbreak of Godzilla and more, here&#39;s a complete breakdown of the MonsterVerse movie timeline.   

Additionally, the Skar King&#39;s weapon having a name could signal its importance during the upcoming conflict. Perhaps Whiplash will be a key object that Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will emphasize as a core part of the movie and its development. With plenty of mysteries still left to be solved, it seems even more details will have to wait until the film arrives in theaters.



Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire comes to theaters on April 12, 2024.
