Summary

  Vought International controls all supe facilities in The Boys, maintaining a monopoly on the superhero business.   The Red River Institute is Vought&#39;s orphanage for young supes, with terrible living conditions.   The Woods is a secretive facility under Godolkin University where Vought produces a supe virus, now in the hands of Victoria Neuman.  







Vought International has a lot of facilities in The Boys, and here are all of them explained, including how Red River, Sage Grove, The Woods, and more are connected. Throughout the three seasons of The Boys and one season of Gen V that currently exist, all kinds of compounds, laboratories, and high-rise buildings owned and operated by Vought International have been shown off, with each of them being used to do the company&#39;s evil building. Many of them operate in secret, while others are very clearly property of Vought, with all of the facilities seen in The Boys playing a major role in the universe&#39;s supe shenanigans.

The Boys is a superhero franchise, meaning that the show and its spin-off series are filled with all kinds of superheroes and supervillains. However, the main antagonist throughout The Boys is Vought, with the company being the driving force behind the franchise&#39;s various conflicts. Vought and its employees create, train, and manage every single supe seen throughout The Boys, with their various Compound V formulas allowing the company to create humans with incredible abilities. However, these supes often turn out much worse than what superheroes are traditionally expected to be like, with the tortuous Vought compounds often playing a role in these terrifying transformations.

 All Supe Facilities In The Boys Are Controlled By Vought 
         

Tons of supe facilities are seen throughout The Boys and Gen V, but so far they are all controlled by Vought. Despite all kinds of supes existing in the world of The Boys, Vought seemingly has a monopoly on the superhero business, with no other competitors arising throughout the company&#39;s history. Because of this, Vought has had no problem managing and maintaining its wide variety of compounds and facilities, with the various functions of each of these buildings playing into Vought&#39;s greater plan. Most of these facilities operate in secret, with Hughie, Butcher, and the Boys as well as Gen V&#39;s supes from Godolkin University working together to uncover them.






 Red River Is Vought&#39;s Orphanage For Young Supes 
          

The Red River Institute is one of Vought&#39;s most important and most vile facilities, with it being the company&#39;s orphanage for young supes. The development of superpowers in children often cause them to accidentally kill their parents or to be abandoned by them, leaving many of the Compound V-injected children homeless. Vought takes these kids in and houses them at Red River, although the conditions are not fit for these children. Major The Boys characters like the villainous Victoria Neuman and Gen V&#39;s protagonist Marie Moreau were housed at Red River, with them knowing how awful the facility actually is.



 Elmira Is Where Troublesome Young Supes Go After Red River 
          




One of the lesser-known Vought facilites in The Boys universe is the Elmira Adult Rehabilitation Center, which debuted in Gen V episode 1. This facility is where troublesome supes are sent after Red River, with very few supes making it out of this pipeline. Despite Red River being a horrible experience, Elmira seems even worse, with the mistreatment of supes getting kicked up a notch as their powers develop. It is believed that Elmira is used by Vought to house supes who lash out against the company. Because of this, many have theorized that Gen V&#39;s final scene shows Marie and her friends being held there, although this isn&#39;t confirmed.



 Sage Grove Was Stormfront&#39;s Personal Project In The Boys Season 2 
          

One Vought facility that is prominently featured in The Boys season 2 is the Sage Grove Center, with Stormfront being behind many of the compound&#39;s most vile initiatives. Located in Pennsylvania, Sage Grove is a facility designed to experiment on supes, allowing Vought to create new concoctions. The Boys season 4&#39;s V24 (also known as Temp-V) is one of the products of the Sage Grove Center&#39;s experiments, with this being one of the location&#39;s biggest contributions to the show. Sage Grove has housed supes like Cindy and Love Sausage, while it also employed Lamplighter up until his death, with him being used to burn evidence.






 Godolkin University Is Where Vought Sends Promising Young Supes 
          

While many young supes get sent off to torturous facilities like Red River or Sage Grove, Vought occasionally picks out supes that they deem as having potential and sends them to Godolkin Univerity. Godolkin University is a school designed specifically for supes, training them in things like crime fighting, supe management, and acting. Godolkin University is the main setting of Gen V, with it being the prestigious school that Marie Morau attends. While Godolkin may seem clean on the outside, the school houses some pretty horrifying secrets, including other Vought facilities that are used for terrifying purposes.



 The Woods Is Godolkin University&#39;s Secret Facility For Dangerous Supes 
          




Deep under Godolkin University, Vought operates a secretive facility nicknamed The Woods, with it being named this due to the supe cells having wallpaper that resembles a forest. The mystery surrounding The Woods in Gen V is the main force behind the show&#39;s narrative, with Marie and her friends attempting to rescue Sam from it. The Woods was intended for one goal, which was to make a virus that controlled supes, giving Vought the power to have an unquestioning supe army. However, the leadership of Dean Shetty caused The Woods to actually produce a supe virus, with the airborn disease now in the hands of Victoria Neuman.



 Vought&#39;s Global Wellness Center Is Used To Treat Sick Supes In Secret 
          

One of the less evil Vought facilites in The Boys universe is the Global Wellness Center, with this being a compound designed to treat sick supes. Retired supes and supes dealing with addiction are typically sent to the Global Wellness Center, with Vought hoping to improve their lives in an attempt to maintain a good public perception. The Global Wellness Center hasn&#39;t been fully explored yet, but it is known that Groundhawk, Termite, and Supersonic have all been send to the facility for addiction-related issues, with it potentially playing a bigger role in the future of the franchise.

 Vought Tower Is The Main Business HQ For Human &amp; Supe Employees 
          

The most iconic Vought facility in The Boys universe is Vought Tower, with this being the main headquarters of the company. Sometimes known as Seven Tower, the building is the team&#39;s base of operations, with The Seven&#39;s meeting room being on floor 99 and several members having apartments in the building. Tons of non-supe employees also work in the building, with many Vought-employed scientists, PR specialists, security guards, and more working there. Even when Stan Edgar was in charge of Vought, his office was located on the 82nd floor. Vought has all kinds of facilities throughout The Boys, and more will undoubtedly be introduced in the franchise&#39;s future.
