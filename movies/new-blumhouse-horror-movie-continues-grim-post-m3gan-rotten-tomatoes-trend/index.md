## Literature Review

The official Rotten Tomatoes score for the new Blumhouse horror movie continues a trend of splats for the company after their smash hit M3GAN.




Night Swim has continued a dismal critical trend for Blumhouse horror movies after the success of their killer doll hit M3GAN in January 2023. The new movie, which is adapted by writer-director Bryce McGuire from his own 2014 short film of the same name, follows a family that moves into a new home, only to discover that their pool is haunted by a supernatural entity. The cast of the movie includes Wyatt Russell (Monarch: Legacy of Monsters), Kerry Condon (The Banshees of Inisherin), AmÃ©lie Hoeferle (The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes), and Gavin Warren (First Man).




Rotten Tomatoes has now tabulated an official critic score for the movie one day ahead of the official Night Swim release. Although it will fluctuate somewhat as more reviews are added, at the time of writing it is a firmly Rotten 35%. This is the latest in a string of splats for theatrical Blumhouse movies throughout the past year, including Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s (32%), The Exorcist: Believer (22%), and Insidious: The Red Door (37%).


 When Will Blumhouse&#39;s Rotten Streak End? 
          

This Rotten score for Blumhouse&#39;s movie Night Swim nearly concludes a full year of theatrical splats, as the movie&#39;s debut comes just one day before the anniversary of the M3GAN release. It remains to be seen when the company will be able to pull out of this slump. However, there are already a variety of upcoming Blumhouse horror movies on the schedule for 2024 that will have an opportunity to reverse this trend.






M3GAN holds a Certified Fresh Rotten Tomatoes score of 93%.




First up in 2024 is the March release of the childhood horror twist Imaginary, about a deadly imaginary friend. That will be followed in August by the Danish horror remake Speak No Evil and in October by Leigh Whannell&#39;s Wolf Man remake, which recently replaced star Ryan Gosling with Christopher Abbott. While the first two movies are unknown quantities, Whannell&#39;s previous Universal Monster reboot was 2020&#39;s The Invisible Man, which earned a Certified Fresh 92%, giving his new entry a leg up with critics.

It&#39;s still possible that all three titles will join Night Swim in perpetuating Blumhouse&#39;s negative critical streak. However, the company has set the sequel M3GAN 2.0 for release in January 2025, which could be poised to bookend this streak with a pair of Fresh scores from movies in the killer doll franchise. With so many intriguing new movies on the docket in the coming year, it seems entirely likely that Blumhouse will break their streak sooner than later.
