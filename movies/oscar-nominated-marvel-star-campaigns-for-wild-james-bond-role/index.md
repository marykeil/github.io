## Literature Review



Former Marvel actor Paul Giamatti is interested in making a move to the James Bond franchise with a fitting choice for a role. The Oscar-nominated actor played the villain Rhino, aka Aleksei Sytsevich, in the 2014 movie The Amazing Spider-Man 2, bringing to life a brief but memorable turn as the Russian mafia member. Over the course of his career, Giamatti has played many impressive roles in movies and television and taking on a wide array of varied parts, earning an Emmy and two Golden Globes in the process.




During a recent appearance in a GQ video, Giamatti shared his interest in playing a Bond villain, painting a detailed picture of the type of villain he would want to portray. The actor&#39;s description bears a couple of similarities to iconic Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who first appeared on-screen in 1963&#39;s From Russia, With Love and went on to show up in several other James Bond movies, including the most recent 2021 movie No Time to Die. Leaning into the ostentatious nature of some archetypal Bond villains, Giamatti laid out specific parameters for his potential role, stating that he would want &#34;an accent&#34; as well as &#34;an animal&#34; and &#34;fur coats.&#34; See Giamatti&#39;s full quote below:


I&#39;d want an accent of some kind. I&#39;d definitely want an accent. It&#39;d be nice to have an animal with me of some kind. Not necessarily a cat, but something. Any animal, maybe. Not a parrot or something. Something real. I don&#39;t know. An accent, though, of some kind I&#39;d have to have. A guy who&#39;s all in fur coats and stuff like that? Be great.






 


 Why Giamatti Is The Perfect Choice For A Bond Villain In The Upcoming Movie 
          

An excellent villain is essential to any good James Bond movie, and with the franchise set to reboot after the death of Daniel Craig&#39;s iteration of the superspy, the next villain&#39;s introduction will be paramount to the success of the upcoming film. Giamatti is a beloved and acclaimed actor with a built-in fan base and a penchant for nailing sinister and zany roles, making him the perfect choice to star opposite the next Bond. In addition, with the changes in store for the franchise in the upcoming movie depending on which actor is chosen for the role of the iconic spy, it may be prudent to retain some tonal similarities to previous James Bond movies with a familiar villain archetype at the helm in Giamatti&#39;s potential character.






The main antagonist of the James Bond franchise, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, has been portrayed on-screen by Donald Pleasence, Telly Savalas, Charles Gray, Max von Sydow, and Christoph Waltz.




If Giamatti were to star in an upcoming franchise project, he would be continuing a long tradition of memorable and unique Bond villains while hopefully bringing something new to the table. Giamatti has the range to nail the over-the-top aspects of a classic villain while also inspiring fear in viewers with his trademark intensity. The actor&#39;s interest in having an accent implies that his character would be from a country outside of the United States, which could lead to him twisting his Marvel character and main Bond antagonist&#39;s nationality with a Russian villain.

Of course, the franchise may decide to go in a different direction by introducing a completely new main antagonist with no similarities to Blofeld, from a different country and with a different set of goals. The next villain cast in the franchise will also depend on the next James Bond that is cast, since the villains are often a foil to the protagonist. Fans of the franchise can likely expect more information about the upcoming James Bond movie in 2024, including whether or not Giamatti is involved.
