 How Mean Girls Has Evolved Since Lindsay Lohan’s Era 
         

Mean Girls has seen quite an evolution since Lohan acted in the 2004 comedy. Since its release two decades ago, Mean Girls has stayed “so fetch” with audiences, as it has become one of the most classic and quotable films of the early ‘00s. Its staying power led to it being adapted into a musical, with a book by original Mean Girls screenwriter Fey, lyrics by Nell Benjamin, and music by Fey’s husband Jeff Richmond.




Rather than being a straight remake of the 2004 film, Mean Girls is an adaptation of the stage musical. This fact is somewhat hidden from audiences who have seen the publicity for the film, as the Mean Girls trailers do not highlight the musical numbers.

                  The New Mean Girls Movie Puts A Hilarious Meta Spin On 1 Of The Original&#39;s Most Iconic Scenes   The new Mean Girls musical remake has an opportunity to make the film feel modern, and the trailer proves it put a meta spin on an iconic scene.   

Even with a musical twist, Mean Girls will be able to draw audiences as there will be an appeal to those who have nostalgia for the 2004 Lohan film, as well as its musical draw for those aware of the adaptation. The cast includes multiple people from the Broadway version of the show, including Rapp and Park, who reprise their roles as Regina and Gretchen, respectively. Hopefully, 2024’s Mean Girls can do Lohan proud as it prepares for its theatrical release.
