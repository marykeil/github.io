## Literature Review



Margot Robbie has had a phenomenal acting career thus far, but interestingly, her six highest-rated movies on Rotten Tomatoes share something in common. Seeing as Robbie continues to be one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest stars, it&#39;s no surprise that she would have numerous titles beloved by critics and audiences. Even having her name attached to a project in a producer role elevates a movie&#39;s buzz, which was the case with Saltburn and Promising Young Woman, two highly-regarded films that Robbie doesn&#39;t appear in. Barbie, of course, was Robbie&#39;s most recent win, becoming 2023&#39;s highest-grossing movie, and the accolades could grow when awards season rolls around.




Robbie got her start in the industry in 2008, with her big break on the big screen coming five years later, playing Naomi Lapaglia in Martin Scorsese&#39;s The Wolf of Wall Street. From there, the Australian native quickly became one of Hollywood&#39;s most sought-after actresses, appearing in several notable titles a year since. Aside from leading movies that caught awards attention, Robbie caught a mainstream following after being cast as Harley Quinn in 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad, leading to two DC follow-ups in the five years that followed. Robbie&#39;s 2021 portrayal of the character actually helped make up a special Rotten Tomatoes record.

              Related   Every Margot Robbie Movie Ranked From Worst To Best (Including Barbie)   From The Wolf of Wall Street to Birds of Prey, weâ€™re ranking the movies of Harley Quinn herself, Margot Robbie, from worst to best.     


 Margot Robbie&#39;s 6 Highest-Rated Movies On Rotten Tomatoes Are Based On Existing Figures 
          




Through 2023, Margot Robbie has ten movies that are officially &#34;Certified Fresh&#34; on Rotten Tomatoes and eleven if Promising Young Woman&#39;s producer role is included. Out of the top six with her in prominent roles, all of Robbie&#39;s characters are based on pre-existing people or figures. Robbie&#39;s highest-rated movie to date is 2017&#39;s I, Tonya, in which she portrayed figure skater Tonya Harding in the film that scored 90%. 2021&#39;s The Suicide Squad is tied with I, Tonya for the score, and though Harley Quinn isn&#39;t a real person, she is an established comic book character.

The same can be said with the figure at the center of Robbie&#39;s next highest-rated movie, Barbie, which garnered 88% on Rotten Tomatoes. Before Robbie brought Barbie to life on the big screen, the doll had a pre-existing following for decades due to its status as an iconic toy. The following two highest-rated movies in Robbie&#39;s filmography featured portrayals of real people. There was Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Naomi Lapaglia in The Wolf of Wall Street, who was based on Jordan Belfort&#39;s real wife, Nadine Macaluso. Another portrayal of Harley Quinn wraps up the list, coming in sixth place:




 Movie  Character  RT Rating   I, Tonya  Tonya Harding  90%   The Suicide Squad  Harley Quinn  90%   Barbie  Barbie  88%   Once Upon a Time In Hollywood  Sharon Tate  85%   The Wolf of Wall Street  Naomi Lapaglia (based on Nadine Macaluso)  80%   Birds of Prey  Harley Quinn  78%   





The Big Short scored 89% on Rotten Tomatoes, but Margot Robbie&#39;s role was only a cameo where she played herself, so it wasn&#39;t counted in the above list.






 Barbie Could Be Margot Robbie&#39;s Third Oscar Nomination For A Role Based On A Pre-Existing Figure 
          




Not only was Barbie the biggest blockbuster movie of 2023, but it could end up continuing another trend for Margot Robbie involving an ongoing character pattern. If she&#39;s nominated for an Academy Award due to her Barbie performance, it will be the third time one of Robbie&#39;s Oscar nominations came from a role based on a pre-existing figure. In 2018, Robbie scored a Best Actress nomination for playing Tonya Harding. Two years later, she was nominated again in the Best Supporting Actress category for her role as Kayla Pospisil in Bombshell. Though Kayla herself wasn&#39;t real, the character was based on several women who were victims of Roger Ailes&#39; sexual harassment.

Outside of the Academy Awards, a few other roles from Robbie garnered awards attention. Her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in Mary Queen of Scots was praised despite an underwhelming critical reception. Robbie was also a highlight in Babylon, where she played Nellie LaRoy, a fictional character who was inspired by real actress Clara Bow. With all the work Margot Robbie has put in to give new life to these previously established figures with interesting stories, it will be interesting to see if Barbie can become the first role to give her that first Oscar win.
