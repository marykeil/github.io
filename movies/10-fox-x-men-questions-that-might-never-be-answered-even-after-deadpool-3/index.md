# 10 Fox X-Men Questions That Might Never Be Answered, Even After Deadpool 3


## SUMMARY 



There are many unanswered questions from Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise that likely won&#39;t be resolved in the MCU&#39;s future mutant stories.


The timeline in Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe was confusing and created many glaring plot holes.
