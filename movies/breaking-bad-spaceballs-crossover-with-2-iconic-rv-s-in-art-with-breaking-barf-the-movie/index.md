# Breaking Bad &amp; Spaceballs Crossover With 2 Iconic RV s In Art With Breaking Barf The Movie


## SUMMARY 



  Hilarious artwork combines Spaceballs and Breaking Bad, imagining John Candy&#39;s character in a crossover film called Breaking Barf.   The connection between the two properties is their iconic RVs - a mobile meth lab in Breaking Bad and a space Winnebago in Spaceballs.   The artwork features Barf wearing Walter White&#39;s tighty whities and posing in front of Spaceballs&#39; Eagle 5.

## Literature Review

John Candy&#39;s Barf becomes a pistol packing Walter White in hilarious art crossing over Spaceballs and Breaking Bad - and their iconic RVs.




John Candy&#39;s Barf becomes Walter White in hilarious art crossing over Spaceballs and Breaking Bad - and their iconic RVs. The late comedic actor Candy enjoyed one of his most memorable roles as the Chewbacca-inspired half-dog/half-man co-pilot to space jockey Lone Starr in Mel Brooks’ classic 1987 Star Wars parody. Talk of Spaceballs 2 has bubbled up in the years since the original film took aim at blockbuster sci-fi movies, but so far nothing has materialized.




Though Spaceballs 2 has never come to fruition, the original film still retains its popularity, and even inspired a recent bit of crossover art imagining Candy’s character starring in a Breaking Bad-inspired film called Breaking Barf. Check out the art below (via Photoshop of Horrors):


 

The connection between the Breaking Bad and Spaceballs properties is, of course, their famous RVs. In the former, Walter and Jesse use a recreational vehicle as a mobile meth lab, while in the latter, Barf and Lone Starr speed around the galaxy in a space Winnebago. The above art features Spaceballs’ Eagle 5, and features Barf sporting Walter White’s iconic tighty whities.


 It’s Too Late For Spaceballs 2, And For A Breaking Bad Revival 
          




Mel Brooks is 97-years-old now and the chances of him returning to direct Spaceballs 2 seem hopelessly remote. A different filmmaker could take on the challenge of making the long-awaited sequel to Brooks&#39; hilarious original film - much as Jason Reitman took over Ghostbusters from his father Ivan - but that filmmaker would be hard-pressed to recapture the zany comedic spirit Brooks brought to the table. It&#39;s a sad fact, too, that many of the original movie&#39;s cast members, including Candy, have passed away, or, like Rick Moranis, are no longer working.



The original Spaceballs promised a sequel humorously called Spaceballs 2: The Search For More Money.




As long as the odds against Spaceballs 2 may be, the odds of Breaking Bad returning seem just as remote. Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul have reunited a few times since the show went off the air, most memorably in the final season of Better Call Saul. But Cranston&#39;s Walter White character is dead, and Paul&#39;s Jesse Pinkman already got his own sequel film in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Vince Gilligan has spoken about the possibility of one day returning to the Breaking Bad universe, but says that for now he wants to work on other things. Needless to say, both Breaking Bad and Spaceballs, and their memorable RVs, will continue to live on in fan art.
