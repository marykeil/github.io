Not every MCU villain is memorable because of their raw strength, but a few have accomplished fantastic feats of power above even what heroes can do.












 








 10  Star-Lord Survives Exposure To Space For A Third Time 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

Among the many powerful characters in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Star-Lord is far from the most impressive. Despite his unorthodox parentage, Peter Quill largely appears to be an average human in terms of strength, speed, and intellect. However, the final film in the MCU&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy sees Star-Lord exposed to the vacuum of space for a third time, only surviving by a narrow margin. Though he may be somewhat enhanced by his unusual genetics, this hasn&#39;t ever been quantified, making his uncanny knack for surviving space seem all the more impressive as a show of power.





 9  Janet Van Dyne’s Survival In The Quantum Realm Displays A Different Kind Of Power 
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania delves deeper into the Quantum Realm, and, in the process, explores some of the experiences of Janet Van Dyne when she was trapped there for three decades. This retroactively makes her survival a feat of strength, as it shows her heroic abilities even without her Wasp suit. To survive in the harsh and dangerous world required Van Dyne to be resourceful and careful, as well as incredibly tough. Quantumania makes it very clear that Janet’s time there was far from pleasant, also making her survival all the more impressive as a result.





 8  Loki Controls His Time-Slipping 
Loki Season 2 (2023)
        

Loki season 2 picks up the story of the MCU’s titular God of Mischief as he continues his work with the TVA to help stabilize the Multiverse after killing He Who Remains in Loki’s season 1 finale. Throughout the early episodes of season 2, Loki is plagued by uncontrollable time-slipping, causing him to inadvertently travel through space and time across the Multiverse. Being able to overcome and control the time-slipping takes Loki a huge amount of effort, making his triumph over the seemingly uncontrollable phenomenon incredibly impressive once it comes about.





 7  Hank Pym Takes Control Of An Army Of Ants 
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)
        

Although Hank Pym was Marvel’s original Ant-Man, his MCU story began after his tenure in the suit. However, Quantumania does give Pym a powerful hero moment in 2023, as he works to help save the Quantum Realm by stopping Kang the Conqueror. During the film’s climactic battle, Pym finds himself sidelined and quickly sets about using his connection with the Quantum Realm’s ants to assist in defeating the villain. Hank Pym being able to control an army of ants is what turns the tide of the battle, and it’s even more impressive, considering Pym actually retired as a hero decades earlier.





 6  Rocket Escapes The High Evolutionary 
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)
        

Rocket has long been one of the most intriguing members of the MCU’s Guardians of the Galaxy, particularly as his dark origin had only been hinted at. However, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delved into his past, showing the awful conditions in which Rocket was created by the High Evolutionary. His later escape from the powerful and brilliant scientific mind of the villain is a particularly impressive display of Rocket’s power, as the hero was able to invent his means of freedom using scraps and outsmart one of the galaxy’s most respected scientists in order to break free.





 5  Kang’s Multiverse Empire Was An Indicator Of His Incredible Power Levels 
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)


 







Kang the Conqueror was formally introduced as an MCU villain in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, as the heroes discover he has been imprisoned in the Quantum Realm by his variants due to his crimes across the Multiverse. The film shows that in his time trapped there, Kang was able to live up to his name, conquering much of the realm and building an impressive empire. Though he’s undeniably evil, Kang’s Quantum Realm empire is itself an impressive display of his power, as it shows how much he is able to achieve simply by using his own wits, strength, and the fear of others.





 4  G’iah Overcomes Gravik 
Secret Invasion (2023)


 







The cast of Secret Invasion features a number of Skrulls, but only two of them become enhanced with a staggering array of powers. Over the course of the show’s story, rebel Skrull Gravik steals the Avengers’ DNA and imbues himself with multiple superpowers, all in pursuit of his goal to make Earth his people’s new home. By the show’s finale, G’iah is the only Skrull in a position to help save the planet, giving herself the same set of powers in order to stop Gravik. G&#39;iah being able to overcome a villain with such a broad power set remains a noteworthy achievement. 





 3  Monica  s The Rift 
The Marvels (2023)
        

The ending of The Marvels sees Monica Rambeau trapped in an alternate reality, all thanks to her own remarkable feat of strength. After Dar-Benn’s use of the cosmic bangles ripped a hole in reality, the film’s heroes are faced with a potentially devastating predicament. Monica Rambeau steps in and closes the rift using her powers, trapping herself on the other side but seemingly saving both realities. Being able to close a tear in the fabric of space and time is an incredible display of power, and it came in Monica’s big-screen hero debut.





 2  Captain Marvel Reignites A Sun 
The Marvels (2023)
        

Monica Rambeau isn’t the only member of The Marvels’ cast to demonstrate the staggering extent of their power. Much of the film’s narrative concerns Hala, the planet devastated by Carol Danvers destroying the Supreme Intelligence in Captain Marvel. In an effort to set things right, Captain Marvel reignites Hala’s sun using her own cosmic abilities. The amount of energy required to do so is massive, and the feat easily and undeniably qualifies Captain Marvel as one of MCU’s most powerful heroes.





 1  Loki Saves The Entire Multiverse 
Loki Season 2 (2023)


 







Perhaps the greatest display of power in the MCU in 2023 wasn’t as much a show of powerful abilities but rather a moment that displayed the growth and evolution of a former villain. After an attempt to stabilize the Multiverse throughout Loki season 2, the God of Mischief realizes the only way to do so is to sacrifice himself. Loki dedicates himself to holding the Multiverse together, single-handedly saving every reality through a selfless act of sacrifice, making him one of the most powerful and important characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
