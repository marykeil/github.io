## Literature Review

Ryan Gosling&#39;s Ken has plenty of fun and memorable outfits in the Barbie movie. Here&#39;s every outfit he wears in the Barbie trailers, ranked.




Ken&#39;s outfits in the Barbie movie steal the show, even if the doll played by Ryan Gosling has spent his life playing second-fiddle to Margot Robbie&#39;s titular hero. Ken has always functioned as an accessory to Barbie; he was created in 1961 as a response to requests asking that Barbie get a boyfriend. Even the movie&#39;s tagline cheekily acknowledges Ken&#39;s status compared to Barbie, saying, &#34;She&#39;s everything. He&#39;s just Ken.&#34; He may be &#34;just&#34; Ken, but his outfits in the Barbie movie are eye-catching and interesting.
The Barbie movie&#39;s costumes were created by veteran costume designer Jacqueline Durran, who won the Oscar for Best Costume Design for her work on Greta Gerwig&#39;s 2019 adaptation of Little Women. Greta Gerwig told Vogue that Barbie was guided by &#34;old soundstage Technicolor musicals,&#34; and Durran did a great job creating looks that perfectly go with Barbie&#39;s colorful world. Margot Robbie&#39;s Barbie costumes look iconic, but Ken also wears some great ensembles in Barbie, with the best highlighting why the Ryan Gosling character became an unexpected cinematic icon in 2023.

 16  Ken&#39;s Camping Outfit 
Ken&#39;s Camping Get-Up Shows How Sheltered Barbieland Is
        

One of the great sequences that showcases the practical sets of the movie is when Ken and Barbie are seen journeying to the real world. Traveling from Barbieland to reality requires Barbie and Ken to pass through a few different scenarios — each with their own unique costumes. This brief clip of the camping scene they find themselves in shows Ken drying his socks in front of a pink camping van.
He&#39;s wearing a dark pink button-down shirt and white pants. It&#39;s a hilariously bland camping look without any of the trappings required for outdoor survival, perhaps foreshadowing how unprepared Ken is for the real world. However, this Ken outfit does perfectly coordinate with Barbie&#39;s camping outfit.





 15  Ken&#39;s Biking Outfit 
Ken Dons A Classic European Look
        

In another montage scene of the two dolls leaving Barbieland, Ken and Barbie are biking through a field of tulips in a location that bears a striking resemblance to the Netherlands. The couple is wearing matching pink plaid shirts and brown shorts with long brown socks and brown shoes.
It&#39;s a cute look for a quick moment in the film, and this Ken costume in Barbie resembles Lederhosen and similar classic European garb. The bicycle portion of the travel sequence didn&#39;t require any nod to Europe, so dressing Ken (and Barbie) in these costumes feels quirky and random, perfectly fitting the tone of the movie.

 14  Ken&#39;s Space Outfit 
Ken Doesn&#39;t Need A Helmet To Breathe In Space
        

Further adding to the fun absurdity of Ken and Barbie&#39;s travel, they eventually find themselves in space, flying through the cosmos. Ken wears this spacesuit while flailing through outer space, trying to catch up with Barbie&#39;s rocket. Barbie and Ken don white spacesuits with brown gloves and boots. Interestingly, of all the montage outfits, this space look is the only one that doesn&#39;t have any pink in it. Despite the lack of the movie&#39;s signature color, however, the spacesuit is a solid costume, and it&#39;s all the funnier for the fact that Ken is seemingly breathing in space without a helmet.





 13  Ken&#39;s Snow Outfit 
Ken&#39;s Winter Attire Is All Fashion, No Function
        

This Barbie montage scene sees Ken holding on to Barbie as she drives a snowmobile through a ski resort. Like Barbie, Ken is wearing a light pink ski suit and fluffy white boots. However, Ken has an addition to his ensemble: pink ski goggles. His ski outfit was already perfectly fitting his position as a citizen of Barbieland — seeming not-at-all functional much like his camping gear — but the goggles are a great extra touch.





 12  Ken&#39;s Sailor Outfit 
Ken&#39;s Look For The High Seas
        

The best outfits found in Ken and Barbie&#39;s traveling montage find the pair donning some very memorable nautical outfits as they take to the high seas. Ken is matched Barbie again, wearing a pink-and-white-striped shirt along with a pink sailor&#39;s cap. Their coordinated outfits here almost make them seem like members of the Barbieland Navy (if such a thing exists), and the dyed-pink sailing caps are instantly memorable despite their brief screentime. It&#39;s a very cute and casual outfit in the iconic Barbie pink color scheme. There is a bonus that the pink boat even helps to complete their ensemble.

 11  Ken&#39;s All-Black Outfit 
The Simple Get-Up For An Unforgettable Dance Sequence


 







The extended musical sequence for &#34;I&#39;m Just Ken&#34; is the moment in the movie where Ken gets to step into the spotlight with some of his most memorable moments as well as a variety of costume changes. This includes Ryan Gosling&#39;s Ken joining the other Kens in a massive dance number in which they all wear a black ensemble. Ken&#39;s got on a black short-sleeved shirt and pants as he and the other Kens engage in a dance battle against Simu Liu&#39;s Ken which eventually turns into a chorus of Kens coming together.


The black-on-black is an unexpected style choice for Ken but looks very cool on him. It is another visually stunning moment from the movie, with the costume style working perfectly against the empty soundstage setting. There&#39;s thematic relevance too, since wearing all black is incredibly juxtaposed to the pastels and pinks of Barbieland. Ken&#39;s now-iconic fur coat also makes an early appearance during this montage, pairing well with the black shirt and jeans.





 10  Ken&#39;s Pink T-Shirt 
The Early Ken Outfit That Lets Him Fade Into Barbieland
        

Production designer Sarah Greenwood talked to IndieWire about the work she and her collaborator, Katie Spencer, did on the Barbie movie, saying &#34;Pink is the film&#39;s thesis.&#34; Their vision of pink is beautifully demonstrated in this early scene from Barbie. After failing to impress Barbie with his &#34;beach&#34; skills and getting some very quick medical attention, Ken and Barbie talk about the plans for a big dance party at her house that night.
They&#39;re in front of a background with many shades of pink, and Ken is wearing a light pink shirt with a ribbon in the back, perfectly matching with Barbie&#39;s pink-and-white gingham dress. It&#39;s a simple shirt, but the color is lovely, and the ribbon is a cool addition. As this is also one of Ken&#39;s earliest appearances in the movie, it clearly represents his place as feeling like part of the furniture of Barbieland, where everything else is pink too.





 9  Ken&#39;s Blue Jacket 
The Subtle Hint That Ken Is Unhappy
        

Following the epic dance party, Ken still has time for one more outfit change before saying goodnight to Barbie. The scene is a wonderful look at their awkward relationship, as Ken is endlessly infatuated with Barbie, but she doesn&#39;t return the same interest, despite his fashionable style. Ken has on a light blue jacket with silver sparkles on the collar, shoulders, and sleeves, along with a matching silver top.
It&#39;s quite an eye-catching casual nighttime outfit, and the white monogrammed &#34;K&#34; on Ken&#39;s jacket is a nice additional detail. Like all of the Ken outfits in Barbie, it has some thematic relevance too. Blue is traditionally seen as the &#34;male&#34; color, and the opposite of &#34;pink&#34; in traditional binary-gender aesthetics. This moment is the first glimpse of Ken wanting to go his own way and not being satisfied with his life in the ultra-feminine Barbieland, so his wearing blue feels almost certainly deliberate.

 8  Ken&#39;s Disco Jumpsuit 
The Hip Disco Get-Up That Symoblizes The Monotony Of Being A Ken
        

The first of the Barbie movie&#39;s memorable big dance sequences comes early in the first act as Barbie hosts a party at her dream house. The lively sequence features the Barbies and Kens dancing to &#34;Dance the Night,&#34; Dua Lipa&#39;s disco-inspired contribution to the Barbie soundtrack. Ken is seen sporting a white jumpsuit with sparkly silver sleeves, a metallic pink belt, and a gold monogrammed &#34;K&#34; on his top. It&#39;s a fun outfit that&#39;s absolutely perfect for a disco party. However, it is another hilarious nod to the sameness of the Kens, as they all wear similar outfits in this sequence, whereas the Barbie&#39;s have their own unique style.





 7  Ken&#39;s Western Cowboy Outfit 
Ken Embraces Horses And The Patriarchy
        

In the real world, Barbie and Ken find Western outfits at a convenience store. It is hilarious that they think these types of outfits are the best options for blending in. Ken dons a black button-down with white flowers and white fringe, a black belt and pants, and a white cowboy hat and shoes. Completing the look is a pink bandana used as a necktie, adding a pop of Barbie pink to Ken&#39;s ensemble.
This is a very fun costume that complements Barbie&#39;s cowgirl look even though it&#39;s mostly black - a fact that subtly hints at his intellectual breakaway from the all-pink philosophy and way of life he knew in Barbieland. The outfit is especially memorable when worn in a hospital as Ken demands a job as a doctor. 





 6  Ken&#39;s Barbie Jacket 
Ken Wears His Heart On His Sleeve
        

Ken has this outfit on when he stows away in Barbie&#39;s car as she drives away from Barbieland to the real world. He&#39;s wearing a pink jacket covered in dark pink Bs that are the same font as the classic Barbie logo. It&#39;s a cute look that feels classically Barbie, and the red Mattel Inc. patch on his sleeve is a nice touch. It is also another sign of Ken&#39;s infatuation with Barbie that he proudly displays even if he doesn&#39;t get much attention in return.

 5  Ken&#39;s War Outfit 
Ken&#39;s Idea Of Macho Attire
        

This Ken outfit from Barbie is intriguing because it&#39;s the opposite of what one would expect from Ken and shows how his style changes when he becomes more of a villain in the story. He&#39;s dressed in all black again, but this outfit, worn during the beach war against the other Kens, is more intense and athletic than his simple black t-shirt and pants look.
The headband he&#39;s wearing has a cool pattern on it, and the fingerless leather gloves are a great touch. However, the best thing about this outfit is the shoulder pads on the vest with fringe on them, which are a fun detail. It seems inspired by the villains in The Karate Kid and is a fun look at Ken&#39;s idea of a tough-guy look. The outfit almost feels like a child&#39;s idea of what an ultra-masculine macho action hero would wear — the perfect ensemble for Ken&#39;s heel turn.





 4  Ken&#39;s Denim Vest 
Ken&#39;s Bland Choice Represents His Lack Of Direction
        

Ken wears this all-denim ensemble in the movie when Barbie comes to visit him in her former dreamhouse that he has now taken over. His outfit here is a denim vest with tattered sleeves. Paired with the Calvin Klein-style &#34;Ken&#34; boxers and jeans shown in a promo image of Ryan Gosling&#39;s Ken, it&#39;s an iconic character ensemble that&#39;s effortlessly cool. However, it also shows the signs of Ken&#39;s lack of imagination when he can choose his outfits without having to consider how they will match Barbie. 





 3  Ken&#39;s Pastel Beach Outfit 
For Ken, Beach Is Life
        

As Ken hilariously explains in the movie, his job in life is &#34;beach&#34;, so it makes sense that he is wearing his beach outfit when audiences first see him in the movie. Ken has on a pastel pink-and-green-striped shirt with matching shorts. The color combination is great, and the pastel shades truly pop in the beachy Technicolor setting. It feels like a quintessential Ken outfit and is perfect for a beach outing. It is also quite fitting that Ken leaves his shirt open to show off his impressive physique, just one more attempt to get Barbie&#39;s attention.
            
 
 Every Ken In The Barbie Movie Ranked 
In addition to a variety of Barbie dolls, Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie movie features many versions of Ken – and here&#39;s every one of them, ranked.








 2  Ken&#39;s Rollerblading Outfit 
A Technicolor Riot On Wheels


 







In one of the Barbie movie&#39;s funniest scenes, Barbie and Ken wear these funky 90s-inspired outfits while rollerblading in the real world. Ken is dressed in a neon pink shirt, with an open shirt with a funky pink, yellow, and blue pattern on top. In addition, he has neon yellow wristbands and knee pads, and a visor with the same pattern as his shirt. It&#39;s a truly wild ensemble that looks hilariously ridiculous and fun at the same time. The fact that Ken also accessorizes with a neon yellow fanny pack makes this costume even better.





 1  Ken&#39;s Fur Coat And Shades 
Ken&#39;s Villain Look Is His Most Iconic


 







Though he is a dim-witted and goofy character in the end, it is a lot of fun seeing Ken&#39;s arc in the movie as he goes from the wannabe boyfriend to the villain hellbent on taking over Barbieland. When Barbie returns home and finds how he has used to &#34;patriarchy&#34; to transform the land in his favor, his outfits begin to reflect his darker edge in some memorable ways.
This outfit shows the origins of his headband and gloves that he is seen wearing later as he goes into battle. They are added to the ensemble along with a necklace with a charm of a horse and a horseshoe, showcasing his hilarious new obsession with horses. He also added a fabulous fur coat and a pair of black cat-eye sunglasses. Hilariously, Ken puts another pair of identical shades on top. Ken has many outfits in Barbie, but his fur coat and multiple shades are truly the most iconic of them all.
