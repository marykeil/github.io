## Literature Review

As legacy directors head towards the end of their careers, it begs the question of which millennial directors will still be relevant in 50 years.




With so many of the greatest directors of contemporary cinema currently in the latest stages of their careers, it begs the question of what millennial directors have what it takes to still be remembered 50 years from. With David Lynch and Steven Spielberg in their late 70s, Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott in their 80s, and Clint Eastwood in his 90s, many of the biggest names in Hollywood won’t be around five decades from now. However, there are those in the millennial generation, born from 1981 to 1996, who have now had enough time in the limelight to signal their potential to still be talked about 50 years from now.
While the term millennial can often be used as shorthand for a young person, the oldest millennials today are in their 40s meaning that they have had time to produce impressive bodies of work as film and television directors. Some up-and-coming millennial directors have only produced a small number of projects but nevertheless have demonstrated enough talent that they may still be in the public conversation several decades from now. There are also lots of millennial directors working today who got their start in front of the camera as actors and have taken what they learned from years of being on set to produce their own critically acclaimed films.









 








 15  Celine Song 
Born: 1988
        

South Korean-Canadian director Celine Song has truly been one of the biggest surprise successes of 2023 with the release of her debut feature Past Lives being a soulful, tender, and devastating depiction of bonds, relationships, and times past. Before Past Lives Song was a playwright and television writer whose delicate sense of dialogue and subtle expressions of what it means to be alive and try to forge connections in the world signaled the beginnings of an auteur’s career with a distinctive and unique voice. If Song can live up to the potential that she has showcased with Past Lives she will surely become a major director of the modern era.





 14  Hiro Murai 
Born: July 15, 1983
        

Hiro Murai is a Japanese-American filmmaker based in Los Angeles who got his start directing music videos for the likes of Childish Gambino, Earl Sweatshirt, and Flying Lotus. Murai has a close creative partnership with Gambino, also known as Donald Glover, and he directed 26 episodes of Glover’s acclaimed FX series Atlanta. Murai directed other highly-rated series such as Barry, Station Eleven, and The Bear and steadily made a name for himself as a director of unique vision with a striking eye for atmospheric and immersive storytelling. Murai released his feature film debut Guava Island in 2019 and it looks like he won’t be slowing down any time soon.





 13  Bo Burnham 
Born: August 21, 1990


 







In 2006, Bo Burnham was 16 years old and made a name for himself by releasing comedy songs on YouTube. By the time he was 20, Burnham had his own Comedy Central special and positioned himself as a major figure in the entertainment industry. Burnham’s directional debut Eighth Grade was an insightful coming-of-age drama that showcased his sensitivity to young people struggling to find purpose in the Internet Age, and his Netflix musical special Inside managed to capture the anxious-ridden isolation of the pandemic restrictions. In all of his work, Burnham demonstrated a unique voice and already has a collection of releases that will stand the test of time.





 12  Michael B. Jordan 
Born: February 9, 1987
        

Best known as an actor, Michael B. Jordan’s partnership with director Ryan Coogler has led to incredible performances in movies like Fruitvale Station, Creed, and Black Panther. With a strong commitment to his craft, Jordan moved behind the camera to direct himself in Creed III. Following this, Jordan will direct Creed 4 and break the Creed franchise’s trend as the first director to make consecutive films in the series. It makes sense that Jordan has been setting records as his nuanced direction and clear understanding of his characters make him a director to watch over the next few years.





 11  Olivia Wilde 
Born: March 10, 1984
        

Another actor turned director, Olivia Wilde is recognizable for roles in House, Tron: Legacy, and Her, however, over the past few years it was her work as a director that has gained the most recognition. Wilde made the best teen comedy in years with the release of Booksmart in 2019 and her 2021 feature Don’t Worry Darling, starring Florence Pugh and Harry Styles, was a controversial but acclaimed movie. Wilde’s first two films have been strong in both story and style, and if she can continue on this path her filmography is well on course to be a memorable and interesting body of work.





 10  Lena Dunham 
Born: May 13, 1986


 







While Lena Dunham came to mainstream attention as the creator, writer, and star of HBO’s Girls, before this she also directed a hilarious autobiographical comedy-drama Tiny Furniture, which demonstrated at just 24 her incredible potential. Dunham returned to the director’s chair in 2022 with the panned sex comedy Sharp Stick but redeemed herself with the release of the medieval coming-of-age story Catherine Called Birdy. While the quality of Dunham’s output has varied in recent years, if she can harness her skills as a writer and match them with her eye for direction then she will once again reach her previous highs and stand as a major voice within the zeitgeist.





 9  Lulu Wang 
Born:February 25, 1983
        

The Chinese-born American filmmaker Lulu Wang has not shied away from how her cultural heritage has influenced her work. While Wang’s debut feature Posthumous, starring Brit Marling, failed to register with audiences, it was her deeply personal drama film The Farewell that highlighted her potential as a director of note 50 years from now. An autobiographical story starring Awkwafina, The Farewell told the story of a Chinese family who chose not to inform their grandmother about her fatal illness. By melding American sensitivities with traditional Chinese expectations, Wang confronted audiences with the dual identities many second-generation immigrants struggle with, and signaled a director of serious maturity.





 8  Ryan Coogler 
Born: May 23, 1986
        

With just four films under his belt, Ryan Coogler has become one of the most successful young directors of recent times. Through an ongoing partnership with actor Michael B. Jordan, Coogler tackled racial tensions in his debut Fruitvale Station, reinvigorated the Rocky franchise with Creed, and brought new maturity to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Black Panther. All of Coogler’s projects have been successful and demonstrate a skilled director who can work in multiple genres. The potential that Coogler has shown so far has been impressive, and there’s no telling how much he could achieve over the next 50 years.





 7  Emerald Fennell 
Born: 1 October 1985
        

British actress Emerald Fennell had major roles in Call the Midwife and The Crown but now appears well on her way to becoming a major figure in the world of film. Fennell’s debut Promising Young Woman demonstrated her potential as a promising young director likely to have a celebrated career in front of her. With the release of Saltburn, Fennell further explored her unique voice in a film that explored class, obsession, and society. Saltburn was one of the most talked about films of that year, and if Fennell continues on this trajectory she could end up as one of the most talked about directors of her era.





 6  Robert Eggers 
Born: July 7, 1983
        

As a director deeply committed to folklore, mythology, and history, American filmmaker Robert Eggers already demonstrated a unique vision with the release of his first film The Witch in 2015, which was one of the most unique and mature horror films of recent times. Eggers demonstrated himself as an auteur of great skill in The Lighthouse, starring Robert Pattinson and Willem Dafoe, which mixed incredible cinematography with a dark foreboding sense of dread. A first-look image of Eggers’ upcoming gothic horror remake of Nosferatu showcased the petrified star of its star Lily-Rose Depp and may act as an important addition to Eggers’ already impressive filmography.





 5  Damien Chazelle 
Born: January 19, 1985
        

The grand musical spectacle of Damien Chazelle was on display in his debut Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench, was expanded in the tension-wrought intensity of Whiplash and exploded in the crowd-pleaser La La Land. Chazelle has made a name for himself as a major director and, despite his latest feature Babylon splitting audiences, some of whom saw it as pretentious and others as a masterpiece, he has become a major voice in American cinema. Since Chazelle’s latest film bombed at the box office, it is difficult to tell where his career will go in over the next 50 years, but no matter what, it will surely be interesting.





 4  Ari Aster 
Born: July 15, 1986
        

Ari Aster spent a number of years making short films before gaining international recognition with his massively successful debut horror Hereditary. Having followed up this success with an atmospheric study of betrayal and romance in Midsommar, and an experimental and daring passion project Beau Is Afraid, it is hard to know what Aster will do next, and among cinephiles he has taken his place as one of the most exciting up and coming directors in the contemporary American film. Aster has a unique vision, and with some major successes behind him, now has enough leverage to get his more experimental and less mainstream projects off the ground.





 3  Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert 
Born: February 10, 1988 and June 7, 1987
        

Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, often referred to simply as the Daniels, are an American filmmaking duo who got their start directing music videos and had an interesting feature debut with Swiss Army Man, starring Daniel Radcliffe. However, their claim to fame comes from the massively successful film Everything Everywhere All At Once, which won seven Oscars at the Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and became A24’s highest-grossing film of all time. While the Daniels look set to follow up the film with a TV project, one thing is for certain, as a Best Picture winner they solidified their reputation for the next 50 years.





 2  Greta Gerwig 
Born: August 4, 1983
        

Greta Gerwig’s career trajectory took her from early mumblecore movies with directors like the Duplass brothers, screenwriter and star on beloved projects like Frances Ha, and eventual acclaimed director of Lady Bird, Little Woman, and Barbie. Gerwig’s projects have always been interesting and, with her work so far, she has already established a reputation for decades to come. However, with the unprecedented mega success of Barbie, Gerwig has two paths standing in front of her. One as an acclaimed auteur creating intimate character-driven narratives, the other as a blockbuster director for huge corporations like Mattel. Time will tell what the future holds for Greta Gerwig.





 1  Josh and Benny Safdie 
Born: April 3, 1984 and April 3, 1984


 







Josh and Benny Safdie, known as the Safdie brothers, made a name for themselves with the excellent feature films Good Times and Uncut Gems. The brothers looked set to continue taking the film by storm when the Safdie brothers sadly announced they were splitting up and would continue working separately. While this was sad news for film viewers, the duo had already showcased enough potential that they will both certainly go on to do more interesting work regardless of if they reunite or not. With a distinctive style of filmmaking, their work was characterized by emotional intensity, explorations of those on the fringes of society, and a collaborative spirit.
