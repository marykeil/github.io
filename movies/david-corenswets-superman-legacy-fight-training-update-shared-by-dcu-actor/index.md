## Literature Review

Superman: Legacy begins filming in March, and an exciting update on David Corenswet&#39;s training to become the DCU&#39;s Man of Steel has been shared.





An update on David Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy fight training has been shared by a DC Universe star. Corenswet&#39;s Superman will be accompanied by several heroes that have been revealed to be part of Superman: Legacy&#39;s cast. Based on that, and the casting of Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, as well as other rumored villains, in the Superman reboot, the DCU&#39;s first movie should bring along some exciting action sequences.




Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter (via @DCU_Updates), Superman: Legacy&#39;s Lois Lane actress Rachel Brosnahan revealed that director James Gunn is working with Corenswet in Atlanta on the actor&#39;s fight training.


 

The latest Superman: Legacy update shared by Brosnahan teases how close the DCU movie is to filming. The DCU Superman reboot is set to go before cameras in March, which means that Corenswet&#39;s DCU Superman fight training is right on schedule.

                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Farâ€¨   James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.   


 Superman: Legacy Is Set Up To Have Some Of The Best DC Movie Fights 
          




While director Zack Snyder&#39;s Man of Steel likely had the most impressive live-action fights for Superman, the DCU reboot of the character can surpass that high bar. There are a few factors that explain why Superman: Legacy could feature some of the best fights in DC movies. First of all is the movie&#39;s director, with Gunn having the expertise to make Superman: Legacy&#39;s fights exciting.

Gunn is no stranger to superhero adaptations, delivering exhilarating fight sequences in Marvel Studios&#39; Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, as well as DC&#39;s The Suicide Squad and Peacemaker. The director has shown that he can excel at making fights look dynamic, emotional, violent, and engaging in projects targeted at a wider audience, such as Superman: Legacy&#39;s case, or those with a more mature tone. Last year&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 included one of the MCU&#39;s best fight sequences, the team&#39;s corridor fight scene, which shows how Gunn goes into Superman: Legacy at the top of his game.




Corenswet is hard at work in the gym to play Superman, with recent photos of the actor showing how he has transformed his body to play the Man of Steel. Corenswet&#39;s dedication to looking physically imposing as Superman will help the movie&#39;s fight scenes, which will also include many exciting characters. With DCU heroes like Green Lantern and Hawkgirl appearing in the film, and The Engineer and possibly more The Authority members as antagonists, Superman: Legacy has all the pieces to deliver exciting fight scenes.







Superman: Legacy releases in theaters on July 11, 2025.
