## Literature Review

After hitting movie theaters last month, director Blitz Bazawuleâ€™s The Color Purple adaptation now has VOD and physical media release dates.




The Color Purple&#39;s digital and Blu-ray release dates have now been revealed following the movie&#39;s release in December. Directed by Blitz Bazawule, the film serves as an adaptation of the 1982 Alice Walker novel of the same name and follows an adaptation from acclaimed filmmaker Steven Spielberg in 1985. The Color Purple stars Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, and Colman Domingo in a story about the strength that one woman finds in sisterhood in rural 1920s Georgia.




After hitting theaters on Christmas Day, The Color Purple is set to release on all major VOD platforms starting tomorrow, January 16, per a new report from Collider. The film will cost the standard $19.99 to rent and $24.99 to purchase. The movie&#39;s 4K UHD, Blu-ray, and DVD release date is a little further off, however, with the physical media to become available on March 12.



Those looking to revisit Spielberg&#39;s The Color Purple can stream the film on Max and Paramount Plus.





 How Did The Color Purple Perform In Theaters? 
          

The Color Purple&#39;s reviews were very positive right out of the gate, with critics seeming to generally favor Bazawule&#39;s film to Spielberg&#39;s 1985 adaptation. The film, for example, currently holds a strong 85% on Rotten Tomatoes, beating Spielberg&#39;s film&#39;s 73%. With a 95% audience score, it&#39;s clear that general movie-goers are also enjoying the film, and this score again beats the 94% score of the 1985 movie.




This clear love for The Color Purple hasn&#39;t, however, translated to total domination at the box office in January. While the movie had a strong opening few days and exceeded projections, things have slowed down somewhat in recent weeks. The Color Purple&#39;s box office now sits at $58.5 million domestic and this number isn&#39;t likely to climb significantly in the coming weeks, especially with the film&#39;s impending VOD release date.

Worth noting is that The Color Purple&#39;s international release is scheduled for January 18, meaning the box office performance thus far certainly isn&#39;t the whole picture. That being said, it&#39;s unlikely that the film will perform as well internationally as it has domestically. An official production budget number for the movie hasn&#39;t been revealed, but it&#39;s estimated to be around $100 million. The Color Purple may struggle to recoup its budget in theaters, but it could well find success on VOD and physical media.



A general rule of thumb is that a movie&#39;s break-even point is double its production budget, meaning The Color Purple is unlikely to break even in theaters.
