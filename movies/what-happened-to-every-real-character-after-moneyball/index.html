  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The real people involved in Moneyball took different paths after the As historic 2002 season. Here’s what happened to them all after the film.</p>
<p>Moneyball is the true story of the revolutionary approach to the game of baseball with the ending that leaves a lot of questions about what happened to Billy Bean and the other real-life characters of the story. Beane&rsquo;s groundbreaking utilization of Bill James&rsquo; analytical concepts depicted in Moneyball marked a paradigm shift in Major League Baseball, forever altering the traditional notions of player evaluation and team management. Of course, the ripple effects of Moneyball did not stop at the diamond&rsquo;s edge. Over time, Beane&rsquo;s audacious experiment with data-driven decision-making permeated the landscape of every sport in the United States, for better or worse.
Over time, the once-disparaged practice of crunching numbers and seeking statistical advantages quickly became an indispensable tool in the arsenal of all national sports franchises. From basketball to football to soccer and beyond, the infusion of sabermetrics into American athletics brought about profound changes as teams sought to unearth hidden talents, optimize performance, and gain a competitive edge. However, this newfound reliance on data analytics also sparks debates over the diminishing role of intuition and the potential dehumanization of sports. The aftermath of the true story of Moneyball reverberates through everyone involved as athletes, coaches, and others grapple with the impact of Beane&rsquo;s bold experiment and its implications.</p>

<p>7  Billy Beane Is Still With The A&rsquo;s
Played By Brad Pitt</p>
<p>Following the events of Moneyball, Billy Beane continues to leave an indelible mark on the Oakland Athletics organization. He served as General Manager of the organization until 2015 when he was promoted to executive vice president of baseball operations. In addition to this role, Beane serves as a senior advisor to owner John Fisher, further cementing his influence on the franchise. From his humble beginnings as a failed outfielder for the Athletics, Beane&rsquo;s trajectory has been nothing short of extraordinary, as he not only transformed the game of baseball but also revolutionized the landscape of sports as a whole through his pioneering use of sabermetrics.
Beane&rsquo;s analytical approach initially met with resistance from coach Art Howe and skeptical players. However, his perseverance paid off spectacularly when the Athletics embarked on an unprecedented winning streak, capturing the attention of the entire sports world. The A&rsquo;s remarkable string of 20 consecutive victories showcased the efficacy of Beane&rsquo;s data-centric methodology. Today, Beane&rsquo;s influence extends far beyond the diamond, as his innovative ideas and methods have been adopted by every Major League Baseball team and permeated the strategies of teams in every sport imaginable. Because of the ideas he pioneered in Moneyball, Beane became an iconic figure who continues to shape the future of sports thanks to his success in Moneyball.</p>
<p>6  Paul DePodesta Led The Football Analytics Revolution
Played By Jonah Hill</p>
<p>Paul DePodesta&rsquo;s fictionalized Moneyball character underwent such significant alterations from his real life that DePodesta requested the character be renamed Peter Brand. However, both the A&rsquo;s Paul DePodesta and Moneyball&rsquo;s Peter Brand are deeply committed to the principles of analytics and quantitative methods when it comes to evaluating prospects. This belief system guides his actions and decisions as he navigates the world of scouting in the Oakland Athletics. Following this period, DePodesta finds success in subsequent career ventures, notably with the NY Mets and San Diego Padres, further reinforcing his dedication to utilizing analytical approaches in various sports contexts.
After revolutionizing baseball in Moneyball, DePodesta transitioned to the realm of professional American football. In 2016, he assumed the role of Chief Strategy Officer for the Cleveland Browns NFL team, aiming to elevate their competitiveness. His appointment focuses on implementing strategic methodologies, honed during his time in baseball, to contribute to the team&rsquo;s success. As a testament to his impact, DePodesta received a five-year contract extension as CSO in 2021, solidifying his continued role in shaping the team&rsquo;s strategic direction and long-term vision.</p>
<p>5  Art Howe Continued To Coach In Baseball
Played By Philip Seymour Hoffman</p>
<p>In Moneyball, Art Howe is portrayed as a dour traditionalist who frequently clashes with Beane, not willing to commit to the radical new approach. While their relationship was not as explosive as portrayed in the film, they indeed had disagreements regarding the team&rsquo;s direction. After his departure from the A&rsquo;s, Art joined the NY Mets for two years. However, in 2004, he was replaced by Willie Randolph. Subsequently, Howe found himself with the Texas Rangers, taking on various roles within the organization. His tenure with the Rangers concluded in 2007 as a bench coach. Unfortunately, his contract was not renewed after 2008 due to the Rangers&rsquo; disappointing season.</p>
<p>4  Scott Hatteberg Went From A Journeyman Hitter To Front C-Level With The A&rsquo;s
Played By Chris Pratt</p>
<p>Scott Hatteberg emerged as one of the prominent beneficiaries of the analytical versus intuitive approach to player development pioneered by Beane in Moneyball. This revolutionary methodology proved instrumental in unlocking Hatteberg&rsquo;s potential, allowing him to flourish within the Athletics organization. The pinnacle of Hatteberg&rsquo;s career came when he delivered a memorable walk-off home run to clinch the Athletics&rsquo; historic 20th consecutive victory. This iconic moment showcased his skill and contributed to the team&rsquo;s success. Hatteberg remained a vital member of the Athletics until 2006 before moving on to join the Cincinnati Reds, where he continued to ply his trade until 2008.
In 2012 and 2013, Hatteberg embarked on a new venture as he transitioned into the role of a color commentator for the Oakland Athletics. This foray into sports commentary gave him a platform to share his expertise and insights with fans, offering unique perspectives on the game he had dedicated himself to. Presently, Hatteberg serves as a special assistant to Baseball Operations for the Oakland Athletics under the guidance of Billy Beane. In this capacity, he plays an integral role in the team&rsquo;s strategic decision-making processes, drawing from his wealth of experience that began with Moneyball and contributing to the organization&rsquo;s ongoing success.</p>
<p>3  Grady Fuson Now Develops Players for the As Using Analytics
Played By Ken Medlock</p>
<p>Grady Fuson was portrayed as a villain in Moneyball but the true story of the baseball scout and Billy Beane is very different. Beane didn&rsquo;t fire Fuson; instead, he voluntarily left the Oakland Athletics to join the Texas Rangers, becoming head of scouting and overseeing their farm system. He remained with the Rangers until 2005 before transitioning to the San Diego Padres. In his new role with the Padres, Fuson served as a special assistant to the general manager, Kevin Towers. Over time, he climbed the ranks and eventually became the organization&rsquo;s vice president of scouting and player development. However, he was fired in 2009 after an awful season for the Padres.
After the Padres let him go, Fuson returned to Oakland in 2010. This time, he assumed the position of an executive special adviser focusing on scouting and player development. Fuson&rsquo;s contributions to player development did not go unnoticed, as he received recognition for his dedication and service. In 2017, he was awarded the prestigious Sheldon &ldquo;Chief&rdquo; Bender Award, which honors exceptional contributions to player development. Additionally, Fuson was named Scout of the Year, an esteemed accolade presented annually at the Winter Meetings, further highlighting his impact in the field.</p>
<p>2  Baseball Players David Justice, Chad Bradford, Riccardo Rincon, &amp; Carlos Peña
Played By Stephen Bishop, Casey Bond, Miguel Mendoza, And Gerardo Celasco</p>
<p>David Justice concluded his career as a player for the Oakland Athletics during their historic 2002 Moneyball season. Prior to that, he had successful stints with the Cleveland Guardians (formerly the Indians) from 1997 to 2000 and the New York Yankees until 2002. After his playing days, he spent a couple of years as a broadcaster for ESPN, providing baseball analysis and commentary.
Chad Bradford, played by athlete Casey Bond, was a specialist reliever pitcher who contributed to the Athletics from 2001 to 2004 until an injury forced him onto the injured list. He subsequently played for the Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, Baltimore Orioles, and Tampa Bay Rays before retiring in 2009. Bradford&rsquo;s unique pitching style and effectiveness made him a valuable asset to the teams he played for.
Ricardo Rincón, an underrated left-handed pitcher, was acquired by Beane during the Moneyball season. Following his time with the As, Rincón went on to play for the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco Giants before transitioning to various Mexican national teams until 2012.
Carlos Peña joined the Athletics as part of a multi-player trade with the Texas Rangers. Peña played for the Detroit Tigers, New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Houston Astros, and Kansas City Royals throughout his career. Currently, he is a broadcaster for the New England Sports Network (NESN) and contributes to Cubs Post-Game Live.</p>
<p>1  Staff Ron Washington &amp; Chris Pittaro
Played By Brent Jennings And Vyto Ruginis</p>
<p>In Moneyball, Ron Washington is Hatteberg&rsquo;s first base coach and is portrayed as a staunch proponent of old-school baseball, often at odds with Billy Beane&rsquo;s approach. He later became the manager of the Texas Rangers from 2006 to 2016, resigning due to family reasons and after experiencing some tensions within the club and his personal life. Following his tenure with the Rangers, Washington briefly served as a first base coach for the Athletics for a couple of years before rejoining the Texas Rangers as a first base coach in 2021.
Chris Pittarro, a scout who supported Beane&rsquo;s sabermetric approach, has been associated with the Athletics since 1991. He played a significant role in embracing and implementing the analytical methodologies advocated by Beane. Pitarro&rsquo;s dedication and contributions to the organization led to his current position as the special assistant to General Manager David Forst. In this role, he continues to lend his expertise and assist in various aspects of the team&rsquo;s operations, further solidifying his commitment to the sabermetric approach first made famous in Moneyball.
