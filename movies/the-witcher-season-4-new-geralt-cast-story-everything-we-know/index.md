## Literature Review

The Witcher Season 4 has some major casting changes, but most of the actors will be returning for the next entry in Geralt of Rivia&#39;s story.




While The Witcher season 4 remains in the production stage, there are still several details about The Witcher season 4 story and cast that can be deduced. The Witcher is based on Andrzej Sapkowski’s many novels and short stories, with each season of the show blending together several of the author’s works. The third season of The Witcher — and Henry Cavill&#39;s time playing Geralt with it — concluded in 2023, but there are still plenty of narrative threads from Sapkowski’s novels that remain untouched by the show, offering some hints regarding the direction The Witcher season 4 could take.




The Witcher season 4 has been mapped out by the show’s writers for a long time, with most of the existing cast returning to continue their character arcs that have been developed throughout the show. Season 4 will focus once again on Geralt of Rivia as he continues his adventures through this dangerous world and improves his abilities as the Witcher — but several other characters from earlier in the series will be making appearances alongside him.

 The Witcher Season 4 Latest News 
         

While news has been somewhat scant regarding the popular Netflix fantasy series, the latest update finds a major star added to the cast of The Witcher season 4. The Matrix legend Laurence Fishburne is officially joining the cast as the familiar book and video game character Regis. Fishburne&#39;s new role is as a vampire who also travels as a barber-surgeon with a dark past. It is unclear how Fishburne&#39;s Regis will fit into the story of season 4 which begins filming in early 2024. 






 The Witcher Season 4 Confirmed 
          

The Witcher season 4 was officially confirmed by Netflix in August 2022. The show’s renewal had been completely up in the air since there was plenty of speculation about lead star Henry Cavill’s unwillingness to continue with the role — but the streamer confirmed that while Cavill will be departing after The Witcher’s third season, the show will continue Geralt’s story as it’s already been established without him.



It is unclear how the 2023 Hollywood strikes affect the production of The Witcher season 4.






 The Witcher Season 4 Cast 
          




Though many of the same actors are returning for the cast of The Witcher season 4, the show’s fourth season is marked by one major casting change. Following Henry Cavill’s departure, the character of Geralt will be played by Liam Hemsworth, who is best known for playing Gale in the Hunger Games franchise. In his statement on Instagram, Henry Cavill expressed his best wishes to his replacement, writing, “I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam&#39;s take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men.&#34;


 

The remainder of The Witcher season 4 cast will mostly be returning season 3 characters. Chalotra will be back for The Witcher’s fourth season, reprising their roles as Yennefer alongside Hemsworth’s new incarnation of Geralt. As for new additions, it has been revealed that Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) will play the book and video game character Regis, a vampire who is also a barber-surgeon.

 How The Witcher Season 3 Ending Set Up Season 4 
          

The Witcher season 3 ending put all the pieces in place for the war between Nilfgaard and the Northern Kingdoms which will undoubtedly happen in The Witcher season 4. Before season 3, Nilfgaard was just a threat to the Northern Kingdoms. However, in season 3, Nilfgaard attacked Aretuza and destroyed the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. Then, Nilfgaard destroyed villages on its way to the North, and the war for the Continent began, leading to an undoubtedly epic battle for The Continent in The Witcher season 4.

The other big The Witcher season 4 set up in season 3 is Vilgefortz, who was revealed to be the antagonist and behind the hunting of Ciri. Vilgefortz even helped the Emperor annihilate the whole of Aretuza. It&#39;s unclear exactly what Vilgefortz&#39;s reasoning is, but it was made clear that he needs Ciri to change the Continent by accessing the Monoliths. Either way, Vilgefortz will be the main The Witcher season 4 villain.






 The Witcher Season 4 Story Details 
          

Geralt’s romance with Yennefer will play a large role in The Witcher season 4 story, and certain changes made to Ciri’s story in The Witcher season 3 suggest that her character will be taking an interesting journey, too. The only thing that is for sure about The Witcher season 4 story is its &#34;multiple worlds,&#34; but how the season intends to use the multiverse is unknown. The Witcher season 4 likely won&#39;t follow the books when it comes to Yennefer, so exactly what will happen to her is hard to tell.

Another certainty is that Vilgefortz will be hunting down Yennefer while trying to keep a low profile himself. The evil wizard is attempting to gain access to the Monoliths and that could finally happen in The Witcher season 4. While Geralt&#39;s primary mission in The Witcher season 4 is to rescue Ciri, the wizard is absolutely on Geralt&#39;s hit list too, and there could be a face-off between them. While The Witcher season 4 story details still haven&#39;t been revealed, based on what season 3 sets up, season 4 could be an epic, multiversal, eight-episode battlefield.




               The Witcher   Summary:   Based on the novels by Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski and the video games, The Witcher follows the story of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter who struggles to find his place in a world where people often prove more wicked than beasts. &#34;Ciri&#34; Cirilla is the Princess of Cintra, who has magical abilities and whose fate has been linked to Geralt&#39;s. Yennefer of Vengerberg, a sorceress who trains to become a mage before deserting her duties and going solo, is also a main character in the Netflix series. The show&#39;s storylines are intertwined but told throughout different timelines, all of which eventually catch up to Ciri&#39;s, whose timeline of events is the most recent. Set on the Continent where men, monsters, and elves exist together, the characters all have separate journeys, though their destinies bring them into each others&#39; orbits.
