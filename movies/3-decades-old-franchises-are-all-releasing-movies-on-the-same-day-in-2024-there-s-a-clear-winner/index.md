## Literature Review
2024â€™s release calendar is full of notable titles, but three from popular franchises are debuting on the same day, causing a box office competition.




Three movies tied to old franchises have the same release date in 2024, but the competition already has a clear winner at the box office. The 2024 movie release slate is already full of highlights worth circling on the calendar. While the new year doesn&#39;t seem like it will have a double-bill notable enough to replicate the power of 2023&#39;s &#34;Barbenheimer&#34; event, there are several dates that will feature head-to-head competition at the theater, including a specific mid-year day hosting the debut of three significant movies.




Based on production delays stemming from the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, 2024&#39;s most anticipated movie list has grown in recent months as a few big titles were pushed beyond 2023. Aside from major franchises affected by the delays, like the MCU and other Disney properties, Dune: Part Two is the biggest title bumped to 2024, joining an already jam-packed release schedule. Interestingly, the Dune release continues a major 2024 trend of sequels, including other titles like Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, Bad Boys 4, Twisters, Alien 6, Beetlejuice 2, and Gladiator 2. Granted, there are a few other releases from established franchises worth noting.

              Related   10 Major Predictions For Movies In 2024   With 2023 coming to an end, it&#39;s time to look ahead to the exciting slate of 2024 new releases and predict which movies will come out on top.    


 Garfield, Furiosa &amp; Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes All Have The Same Release Date 
   Close     




Despite a calculated spread of releases throughout the calendar year, May 24th, 2024, will be a huge day for movies since it&#39;s the scheduled release for The Garfield Movie, Furiosa, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. The reason for the busy release is due to Memorial Day weekend, which often serves as the kickoff to the summer blockbuster season. Whereas The Garfield Movie is an animated comedy acting as a reimagination of sorts, Furiosa is a prequel to George Miller&#39;s Mad Max: Fury Road, and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the fourth entry in the reboot series.

That said, each of the three comes from decades-long franchises. George Miller launched the original Mad Max trilogy in 1979, lasting until 1985, before rebooting the series with Fury Road in 2015. The Planet of the Apes franchise has been around even longer, with the first movie adaptation debuting in 1968 and based on a French novel from 1963. After the five-film original series, a TV version, the Tim Burton remake, and the current reboots, Planet of the Apes is still as relevant as ever. As for Garfield, the franchise might not have a storied movie history, but the character has been around since 1976 and carries a multi-media appeal to this day.






 Why Garfield Will Likely Be Bigger Than Furiosa &amp; Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes 
          

Speaking of appeal, that&#39;s precisely why The Garfield Movie will likely be the winner at the box office alongside Furiosa and Kingdom of the Planet of the Ape&#39;s shared May 2024 release. Unlike the other two, which cater to a more mature demographic, Garfield carries the family appeal needed to dominate the Memorial Day weekend box office. Sony was reminded how well animated movies could attract moviegoers through The Super Mario Bros. Movie&#39;s 2023 success at the box office. The trend could continue with another Sony release with Chris Pratt lending his voice as the lead character.

That&#39;s not to say Furiosa and Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes won&#39;t find success releasing in May 2024. Both titles are highly anticipated and could potentially help make Memorial Day weekend in 2024 one to remember at the box office. Still, their respective ratings will likely have the two titles battling for second place while Garfield leads the pack on this exciting release day.
