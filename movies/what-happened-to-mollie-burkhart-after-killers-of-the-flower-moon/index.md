## Literature Review

Martin Scorsese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon depicts the real-life tragedy of the Osage murders largely through the eyes of full-blooded Osage Mollie Burkhart. Buckhart, portrayed by the captivating Lily Gladstone (Certain Women, Billions) is one of the primary sufferers of the horrific events that plagued her family and land in Osage County, Oklahoma in the early decades of the 20th century. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a transformative performance as her husband Ernest Burkhart, a manipulative and greedy opportunist who colludes with his uncle William King Hale (Robert De Niro) to effectively steal as much wealth from the Osage Nation as possible.




The Killers of the Flower Moon true story chronicles the surge of interest in Osage County once the Indigenous Peoples of that area became extremely wealthy due to the large oil reserve discovered in their land. Mollie Burkhart, known to be not as enticed by luxurious items as her husband, was one of the main figures affected by the Osage County murders that left several of her closest relatives dead including her sister Anna. Although Mollie was able to survive the treacherous hidden agenda set forth by Hale and her own husband, whom she deeply loved, the Osage murders marked her life for the rest of her days.

Following the events of Killers of the Flower Moon, Mollie Burkhart divorced Ernest after learning the truth about his involvement with Anna&#39;s murder and that Ernest tried to poison and kill her through insulin shots. Horrified by the thought of Ernest, who was given a life sentence in federal prison, Mollie was remarried two years later to a man named John Cobb. She and Cobb continued to live on the Osage reservation after their marriage began in 1928, changing her legal name to Mollie Burkhart Cobb. The children that Mollie had with Ernest still inherited her family&#39;s fortune after Mollie&#39;s death.



 Mollie Gained Control Of Her Family&#39;s Wealth &amp; Ended Her Guardianship 
         

As Mollie&#39;s husband, Ernest had become a guardian and direct benefactor to her land in the event that she died. According to Vox, &#34;In 1931, [Mollie Burkhart] successfully sued for an end to her own guardianship and finally gained full control over the family fortune others had tried so hard to take.&#34; This was a major financial move for Mollie and her family that secured control over her family&#39;s rightful claim to her land that many people had viciously tried to take from her. Mollie&#39;s case also led to several other guardians being exposed, especially those who had more than one guardianship and became a clear example of the violence and corruption in the area.






 When Mollie Died &amp; How Old She Was 
          

Mollie Burkhart Cobb died at the age of 50 on June 16, 1937. Despite the effects of the Osage murders and Ernest&#39;s attempts to poison her, Mollie&#39;s death was considered unsuspicious and did not warrant another FBI investigation. She was buried at the Greyhorse Indian Village Cemetery in Osage County, Oklahoma where several of Mollie&#39;s relatives, including her sister Anna, were also buried. John Cobb lived to the age of 63, dying in California in 1969. The immense tragedy that Mollie Burkhart endured as depicted in Killers of the Flowers fortunately didn&#39;t stop her from living her life afterward.
