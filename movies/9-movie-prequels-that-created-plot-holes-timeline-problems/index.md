## Literature Review

Prequels to movies including Star Wars, Alien, and The Lord of the Rings introduce plot holes and continuity errors that confuse and frustrate fans.




Movie prequels run the risk of creating plot holes and continuity errors in a franchise&#39;s timeline. Prequels are not necessarily a bad thing and can serve as a further exploration of a particular character or setting. However, it is common for prequels to introduce timeline problems that stand out as glaring plot holes.
When producing a prequel, the writers and producers are expected to adhere to the original series&#39; timeline. However, a simple oversight can lead to a plot hole. Alternatively, they might decide to ignore a continuity problem because they are going for a certain effect and/or they do not believe the audience will care. Yet more often than not, they immediately notice the issue, and it feels like the writers are underestimating the audience&#39;s intelligence.









 








 9  Gandalf Knows That Bilbo Has The Ring 
The Hobbit: The Battle Of The Five Armies (2014)


 







At the end of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies, Gandalf is escorting Bilbo back to the Shire when he abruptly tells Bilbo that &#34;magic rings should not be used lightly.&#34; This reveals that Gandalf knows about the strange Ring Bilbo stole from Gollum. However, Gandalf does not instigate Frodo&#39;s journey to destroy the Ring for decades in the Lord of the Rings timeline.
The supposed plot hole of Gandalf knowing about Bilbo&#39;s ring can be explained because there are other magical rings in Middle-Earth and Gandalf did not yet realize that Bilbo had acquired the One Ring. However, it still does not completely make sense for Gandalf to put off dealing with the Ring, especially since he warns Bilbo of the dangers of using it. The heroes could have had a head start if they had not waited until the Nazgûl were on their way to the Shire years later.





 8  Puss In Boots Becomes An Assassin 
Puss In Boots (2011)
        

The first Puss in Boots movie takes place before the character&#39;s first appearance in Shrek 2 in the Shrek timeline. In Puss in Boots, Puss is a generally heroic figure. He wants to find the Golden Goose to repay the people of his hometown and clear his name. He saves the town from the Goose&#39;s mother in the finale and is forced to go on the run again, but first reconciles with his adoptive mother.
While Puss might steal some things on occasion and seems to have a general interest in becoming rich, he is more of a Robin Hood figure than an outright villain. However, in Shrek 2, he is working as an assassin for hire and has a deadly reputation. Fiona&#39;s father hires Puss to kill Shrek, but Puss changes sides and becomes Shrek&#39;s ally instead. Yet the timeline of Puss&#39; moral character development doesn&#39;t make sense.





 7  Luke Skywalker Is Not Hidden Very Well 
Star Wars: Revenge Of The Sith (2005)


 







At the end of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan and Yoda arrange for Anakin and Padmé&#39;s newborn twins to be &#34;hidden&#34; from Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. Leia is adopted by Senator Organa and takes his name, which seems like a good plan. However, Luke is sent to Tatooine to be raised by Anakin&#39;s stepbrother Owen Lars and his wife Beru. Luke also keeps the Skywalker name. The Emperor probably would have thought of searching Anakin&#39;s home planet, and Darth Vader knows of Owen and Beru&#39;s existence.
            
 
 10 Movie Plot Holes That Still Haven&#39;t Been Fixed 
These glaring plot holes in famous movies have never been completely resolved and distract people from the main storyline, demonstrating poor writing.








 6  Earth Is A New Discovery For The Autobots 
Bumblebee (2018)
        

Throughout Michael Bay&#39;s Transformers movies, more information about the Transformers&#39; long history with Earth is progressively revealed. However, Bumblebee gives the impression that the Autobots only discovered Earth for the first time in recent history. Previous plot points regarding the Transformers&#39; presence on Earth are ignored. Bumblebee is a soft reboot and may have been intended to reset the live-action Transformers timeline. However, because there is no distinction between Bumblebee and the earlier Transformers movies, this timeline continues to confuse fans.





 5  The Origin Of The Xenomorph 
Alien: Covenant (2017)


 







While the Alien prequels have been criticized for their many continuity errors, one of the biggest plot holes is revealed in Alien: Covenant. In the original Alien, the crew of the Nostromo discovers the 1000-year-old remains of a member of the Engineer race, who has been killed by a Xenomorph like the one that will terrorize the crew for the rest of the movie. However, Alien: Covenant places the Xenomorph&#39;s origins only decades before the events of Alien. The &#34;Space Jockey&#34; being centuries old does not work when the prequel suggests that the Xenomorphs were created by the android David much more recently in the Alien timeline.





 4  Mike &amp; Sully Become Friends In College 
Monsters University (2013)
        

In Monsters, Inc. (2001), Mike makes a passing remark that Sully has &#34;been jealous of [Mike&#39;s] good looks since the fourth grade.&#34; This implies that Mike and Sully met in fourth grade or earlier. However, Monsters University shows them meeting for the first time as college students. Monsters University director Dan Scanlon explains (via Slashfilm) that it was decided that Mike and Sully meeting in college would be a better story and that &#34;fourth grade&#34; could just be an expression in the Monster world:
&#34;[...] that line was out there. So we tried versions where they met young and then we kind of skipped ahead to college. And we knew we didn&#39;t want to make Monsters Elementary. We had no interest in that. [...] And so we made a tough decision to just have them be in college and put that line aside. So the good thing is the only reason that line was in the first film was to just give you the feeling that these guys have known each other a long time and I think that college still does that. So yeah, now we joke that that&#39;s just an old monster expression, you&#39;ve been jealous of my good looks since the fourth grade.&#34;





 3  Sabretooth&#39;s Past With Wolverine 
X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)
        

Sabretooth first appeared in X-Men (2000), played by Tyler Mane. He was recast for X-Men Origins: Wolverine, then played by Liev Schreiber. Origins adds plot details to Sabretooth&#39;s story, making him Wolverine/Logan&#39;s estranged half-brother. However, when Sabretooth appears in the original X-Men movie, he does not indicate that he knows Logan. Fox&#39;s X-Men movies have many plot holes like this, some of which are explained by X-Men: Days of Future Past resetting the timeline&#39;s continuity. For example, Charles Xavier is seen walking in both X-Men: Last Stand and Origins, even though he is paralyzed at the end of X-Men: First Class.





 2  Professor McGonagall Is Already Working At Hogwarts 
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald (2018)
        

In the Harry Potter prequel Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Professor Minerva McGonagall is shown working at Hogwarts by the time Newt Scamander is a student there, in the 1910s or 20s. McGonagall&#39;s presence in Fantastic Beasts is a plot hole because her year of birth is supposed to be 1935 (via Harry Potter Wiki). While fans have posited some theories to explain this, Fantastic Beasts probably includes McGonagall because the team wanted to have a fun cameo and did not think the fandom would care about a small plot detail that is never confirmed in the Harry Potter books or movies.

 1  Obi-Wan Wears Recognizable Jedi Robes While In Hiding 
Star Wars: The Phantom Menace (1999)


 







Obi-Wan&#39;s simple robes from Star Wars: A New Hope became so iconic that George Lucas decided to model the entire Jedi Order&#39;s look after them. However, when Star Wars: The Phantom Menace premiered, fans noticed a plot hole regarding Obi-Wan&#39;s robes. Because Obi-Wan is supposed to be in hiding from the Empire in A New Hope, it does not make sense for him to be wearing clothes that are recognizable as the custom attire of the Jedi Order.
Obi-Wan&#39;s clothes in the Obi-Wan Kenobi miniseries suggest that the Jedi robes are simple enough to blend in with the drab fashion of the rest of Tatooine. However, when Anakin returns to Tatooine in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Watto quickly recognizes him as a Jedi. Therefore, the Jedi robes are known by the people of Tatooine. While continuity errors can sometimes be ignored for the sake of an entertaining movie, this is harder to pull off with beloved franchises like Star Wars, Alien, or The Lord of the Rings.
