## Literature Review

Henry Cavill &amp; Guy Ritchie are set to reunite in a highly-anticipated 2024 war film which could be the closest thing fans will get to an UNCLE sequel.




One of Henry Cavill&#39;s upcoming 2024 movies will probably be the closest thing audiences will get to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 2. Cavill is poised to have a spectacular year in 2024 with several major titles in both film and television finally coming to light. After years of speculation that Cavill would eventually take the reins of the celebrated James Bond franchise from Daniel Craig, Cavill has narrowed his focus on several standalone action projects including Mathew Vaughn&#39;s Argylle, a Highlander remake, and the highly anticipated animated television series Warhammer 40,000.




As the previous face of two iconic characters, Superman/Clark Kent and Geralt of Rivia from The Witcher, Cavill seemingly has more freedom than ever to choose which roles he will play throughout the 2020s and beyond. It&#39;s plausible that Cavill, who has attached himself to many franchises such as Netflix&#39;s Enola Holmes and even Mission: Impossible as a voracious villain to Tom Cruise&#39;s Ethan Hunt in 2018&#39;s Fallout, is determined to keep his options open for more independent, standalone projects in the near future, such as the upcoming Guy Ritchie war drama The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.

                  Henry Cavill Should Play A James Bond Villain, Not 007 - And One Movie Proves Why   Henry Cavill is known for playing many action heroes &amp; for being on the Bond 26 shortlist. However, one film proves why he&#39;d be a better 007 villain.   


 Guy Ritchie &amp; Henry Cavill Are Reteaming For The Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare 
          




Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie will be teaming up for the first time since the 2015 spy thriller The Man from U.N.C.L.E., which is based on the popular spy fiction series from the 1960s starring Robert Vaughn. In The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, Cavill will likely play one of the highly-trained soldiers that the British military recruits to operate against the Nazi forces during World War II. The film is based on a true story about the real-life Special Operations Executive that was founded by Winston Churchill, who is widely considered to have started modern &#34;black ops&#34; in the UK.

In The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Cavill plays an American CIA agent named Napoleon Solo who works with a KBG operative Illya Kuryakin (Armie Hammer) on a covert mission against a shadow criminal organization. While there are apparent differences between The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, particularly in the plot, the time period, and the characters at play, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare will still likely feature many of the stylistic elements and tone of Guy Ritchie&#39;s notable directing style. As a result, it could be the closest thing that audiences who have eagerly awaited a Man from U.N.C.L.E. sequel starring Cavill will ever receive.




                  Henry Cavill&#39;s New Spy Movie Isn&#39;t The Real Obstacle To His James Bond 26 Casting   With Henry Cavill set to appear in another spy movie, many feel his chances of being Bond are over. However, the new film isn&#39;t the real problem.   



 Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare Is A Perfect Man From UNCLE 2 Replacement 
         

Although a proper sequel to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. would be celebrated by fans of the original film, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare might end up being an even better replacement than The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 2 and make better use of the Ritchie-Cavill reunion. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare introduces a brand new story whose foundation on true events could provide for a better overall screenplay than the one written for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. While Cavill&#39;s fans certainly loved seeing him in the role of a skilled CIA agent, some critics have argued that the film as a whole feels like a watered down Mission: Impossible period piece.




The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare also features the exciting onscreen duo of Cavill and Alan Ritchson, who is currently one of the biggest action stars on television thanks to his celebrated Reacher series. Unfortunately, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 2 might not have had a strong enough premise to revitalize the 2015 movie and extend it into a franchise. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is also poised to become Ritchie&#39;s best war movie yet, with his only previous effort in the genre being the well-received 2023 film The Covenant starring Jake Gyllenhaal.

                  The Man From U.N.C.L.E. 2: Confirmation, Story &amp; Everything We Know   The first movie was supposed to launch a franchise but is The Man From U.N.C.L.E. 2 still on the cards? Here&#39;s what we know about the sequel.   



 Why There&#39;s Never Been A Man From UNCLE Sequel 
          




The lack of any clear movement forward on The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 2 is not a great sign for the prospect of the franchise. The situation regarding Armie Hammer&#39;s sexual assault allegations has likely complicated the progression of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. sequel as he was a major part of the original Man from U.N.C.L.E. There is still certainly hope for The Man from U.N.C.L.E. 2 to eventually appear in some capacity, especially if the reunion of Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie in the highly-anticipated The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare proves to be a box office success.

              The Man From U.N.C.L.E.  Based on the television series of the same name, The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is directed by Guy Ritchie and stars Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. Set during the height of the Cold War, the film follows a CIA operative and a KGB agent who are forced to work together to stop an international criminal conspiracy. Alicia Vikander, Elizabeth Debicki, and Hugh Grant star alongside Cavill and Hammer.    Release Date    August 14, 2015     Director    Guy Ritchie     Cast    Hugh Grant , Jared Harris , Armie Hammer , Henry Cavill , Alicia Vikander     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    116minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Comedy     Writers    Lionel Wigram , Guy Ritchie     Budget    $75â€“84 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures
