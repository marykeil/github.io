## Literature Review

Barry Keoghan puts in a gripping, bare-all performance in Saltburn. However, one less-than-stellar aspect inadvertently makes his role even better. 




In a movie full of stand-out performances, Barry Keoghan&#39;s role in Saltburn is generally considered one of the strongest aspects of the movie. However, while the Irish-born actor is never less than fully committed, there is one part of his performance that has attracted popular criticism. The number of viewers taking issue certainly lends the critique some validity. However, below the surface, there&#39;s a case to be made that this particular mistake – however inadvertently – actually adds a whole other dimension to the film and its message.




Saltburn is an uproarious satire on class, privilege, and desire. Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, the film follows Keoghan&#39;s Oliver Quick, an Oxford student born in the North West of England who struggles to fit in at university. He is, however, soon taken under the wing of the charismatic Felix Catton, who invites Oliver to stay at his familial Saltburn estate over the summer. As he slowly ingratiates himself with the Cattons, the movie heads down an increasingly dark rabbit hole, with the extent of Oliver&#39;s obsession becoming terrifyingly clear. That Keoghan can carry off such a demanding role is testament to his skill as an actor. However, there is one facet of his performance that some have found less-than-convincing.

                  Every Death In Saltburn &amp; How It Fits Into The Bigger Plan   Within the darkly comedic narrative of Saltburn, a series of deaths occur, each strategically contributing to a character&#39;s masterful plan.

While Saltburn has been divisive thanks to its shocking scenes, many viewers – particularly from the North West – have pointed out problems with Barry Keoghan&#39;s attempted Merseyside accent. The area&#39;s distinctive timbre is recognized as one of the hardest English regional accents to imitate, and so it has proved in Saltburn. Many viewers have taken to social media sites like X and Reddit to highlight the issue. However, even though it&#39;s far from the worst accent in movie history, there is a surprising upside to Keoghan&#39;s inconsistent intonation.


 

One of the key revelations surrounding Oliver&#39;s character is that he&#39;s pretending to be more working class than he actually is. As he befriends Felix, he confides that his father is dead and his mother is a drug addict – neither of which is true. When he and Felix finally visit his family home, it&#39;s revealed that the Quicks are decidedly middle class – offering Felix &#34;spag bol&#34; for dinner in comfortable surroundings. The fact that Keoghan&#39;s accent is a poor imitation rather than the real thing perfectly ties into this deception. Not only does it make sense that Oliver is inauthentic, but it also speaks volumes about Felix that he was unable to spot it. On both levels, Keoghan&#39;s mistake works.






 Oliver&#39;s Accent Choice Continues A Key Saltburn Theme 
          

Not only does Keoghan&#39;s accent work for Oliver as a character, but it also relates to a theme that runs throughout the whole movie. Whether it&#39;s Farleigh fooling his tutor, Elspeth gossiping about Oliver behind his back, or Oliver himself slowly pitting the Cattons against one another, deception is one of Saltburn&#39;s key concerns. With untruth on display in practically every scene, the movie highlights the toxicity and untrustworthiness of the characters while simultaneously setting the scene for Saltburn&#39;s dramatic twist ending. Keoghan&#39;s affected accent only emphasizes this dishonesty further. It might have been inadvertent, but Keoghan&#39;s performance helps make one of Saltburn&#39;s most important messages even stronger.
