Summary

  &#34;The Book of Clarence&#34; is a comedy-drama film directed by Jeymes Samuel, starring LaKeith Stanfield as a man who poses as a false Messiah for personal gain.   The film features a star-studded cast, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Omar Sy, Anna Diop, and James McAvoy, among others.   The movie explores themes of knowledge versus belief, with Clarence questioning the actions of those who preach one thing but do another, emphasizing the importance of seeking knowledge over blind belief.  





The Book of Clarence is a comedy of Biblical proportions from The Harder They Fall director Jeymes Samuel, who also wrote the screenplay. The movie stars LaKeith Stanfield (Atlanta) as a would-be apostle of Jesus in ancient Jerusalem who is down on his luck. Empowered by the son of God&#39;s message and influence, Clarence remakes himself into another Messiah for the sake of power and riches before learning some valuable lessons about faith.




Along with the Oscar-nominated Stanfield, The Book of Clarence cast is full of heavy hitters, including Benedict Cumberbatch, Omar Sy, Titans&#39; Anna Diop, David Oyelowo, Alfre Woodard, James McAvoy, and Teyana Taylor. RJ Cyler also joins after previously collaborating with Samuels and Stanfield on The Harder They Fall. While billed as a comedy and containing elements of parody, the movie has deep themes resonating throughout and should prove to be another successful endeavor for the visionary filmmaker.

Screen Rant interviewed LaKeith Stanfield and Jeymes Samuel about the themes present in The Book of Clarence, the process of getting into character, and the music playlists that helped flesh out the world.


 Jeymes Samuel &amp; LaKeith Stanfield Talk Book of Clarence 
         




You talk about epic and grounded all in one, but I&#39;ve got to thank you because this is the first time I really felt represented in a film like this. Incredible performance too, LaKeith. Jeymes, can you talk about the theme of knowledge versus belief in this film?


Jeymes Samuel: LaKeith would speak on that more, but Clarence&#39;s whole ethos is knowledge is stronger than belief. He questions people who say one thing and do another, or they preach one thing and do another. Clarence questions that because it&#39;s like a person telling you, &#34;Man, you got to live right,&#34; but smoking a cigarette. Like, &#34;Man, you believe what you&#39;re saying. You don&#39;t know if you know what you&#39;re saying to be true.&#34;
I&#39;ll give you a real quick example: Mike Tyson fighting Michael Spinks, 91 seconds. Shortest heavyweight bout in history. It wasn&#39;t that he beat Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, that ain&#39;t the thing. The thing is what he does after knocking out Michael Spinks, who had never lost in 91 seconds. He just turns around to his corner and just does this. Michael Spinks believed he was going to win. Mike Tyson knew he was going to demolish him. Knowledge is stronger than belief. Always look for knowledge, you know what I mean?





LaKeith, you turned in two brilliant performances in this film, one as Clarence and one as Thomas. You do such a great job of adding these nuances to both. Can you talk about the challenges of finding those nuances in their similarities and also their opposites?


LaKeith Stanfield: Thank you. I just think we exist in a universe of polarities, and one&#39;s lights and another&#39;s dark. I think once you kind of figure out one character — I don&#39;t even know if I ever really figure out a character, but once I get a good feeling about them — then I can kind of draw their shadows from that.
I tried to draw shadows from both and infuse those into the characters to make for an interesting dynamic among them. And it was a very nuanced methodology to it, so the fact that you&#39;re able to see that I&#39;m quite appreciative of. But really, I feel like in one way or another, both of the characters already live within me.
There are times when I feel very Thomas-like and times when I feel very Clarence-like. Most times I feel very Clarence Thomas-y.
Jeymes Samuel: I see what you did there.





You have such a successful music career as well and, from what I read, you gave the actors playlists to help them with their story arcs. Can you talk to me about some of the tracks you chose for Clarence?


Jeymes Samuel: With Clarence, I find a lot of Joni Mitchell stuff and Terry Callier. &#34;Dancing Girl&#34; from Terry Callier&#39;s What Color Is Love. He has a song called &#34;Dancing Girl,&#34; and that song is to me almost like he&#39;s singing as Clarence to his Varinia.
In alignment with that, Terry Callier, who passed away in 2012, and I met. I told him about this movie I&#39;m going to do one day when I grow up — this literally was 100 years ago — and I wrote the song of Varinia. He sang it for me for the soundtrack before he passed away, and it&#39;s on the soundtrack; Terry Callier singing Varinia and Terry Callier&#39;s &#34;Dancing Girl&#34; are part of Clarence&#39;s playlist.
I found a lot of Joni Mitchell speaks to Clarence. Incidentally, if you listen to Joni Mitchell, a lot of it speaks to LaKeith Stanfield; just his eyes. If you listen to &#34;Woodstock,&#34; it&#39;s kind of like the journey of LaKeith Stanfield.





Jeymes is a brilliant director and a visionary. What did his directing style add to this film?


LaKeith Stanfield: It was the film. I think it was born out of Jeymes&#39; ID. You read the script and you&#39;re hearing Jeymes, and it&#39;s a really beautiful thing when you can have the director show up on set and speak exactly how the characters speak. There&#39;s a sense of that, and it&#39;s nice because I get to watch Jeymes and then get to knowingly infuse him into the character, which is really beautiful because I know that it&#39;s his imagination filtered through me.
His godship through me creates this new thing, and I think it&#39;s a real gift because not a lot of people A) retain that because they&#39;re not connected to the material in that way, or B) facilitate a performance that can join the two things. It&#39;s a real gift, and it&#39;s an actor&#39;s treat to be able to work with a visionary like that.
Jeymes Samuel: I&#39;d like to say also, though, you have to see the Book of Clarence on the big screen and see what LaKeith Stanfield has done with both characters. Because when you cast a character, you give it away. LaKeith&#39;s story is very much a personal story story to him, but watching what you&#39;ve done is so far removed.
In my brain, especially when I found LaKeith Stanfield, I was kind of like, &#34;Now I&#39;ve got LaKeith in mind, but I&#39;m still doing a real cheap LaKeith Stanfield impression until the dude himself embodies him.&#34; But he comes in with all of this nuance, so there are things that he may take from me in telling that story, but then there&#39;s this whole life of LaKeith he brings to Clarence that is 1) not on the page, 2) not in the story, and 3) I could never have predicted.
Someone said to me, &#34;Is this the movie you wanted to make, Jeymes?&#34; No, it&#39;s not at all. I didn&#39;t aim to make this movie. I aimed to make The Book of Clarence. What this guy brought — oh my goodness — is a whole new Thomas. Sometimes I wanted to punch Thomas in the face; other days, I loved him. But I felt him at all times, anyway.





Look, I wanted to be an apostle of Clarence as well.


Jeymes Samuel: LaKeith Stanfield, from the opening scene, brings you into the Bible days. He&#39;s just a tour de force of a performance. And him as both characters? It&#39;s something that I did not write. I didn&#39;t write that stuff. The voice you use is when you&#39;re laughing as Thomas? You have to see it to believe it.




 About The Book of Clarence 
          

From visionary filmmaker Jeymes Samuel, The Book of Clarence is a bold new take on the timeless Hollywood-era Biblical epic. Streetwise but struggling, Clarence (LaKeith Stanfield) is trying to find a better life for himself and his family, make himself worthy to the woman he loves, and prove that he’s not a nobody. Captivated by the power and glory of the rising Messiah and His apostles, he risks everything to carve his own path to a divine life, a journey through which he finds redemption and faith; power and knowledge.

The Book of Clarence arrives exclusively in movie theaters on January 12.
