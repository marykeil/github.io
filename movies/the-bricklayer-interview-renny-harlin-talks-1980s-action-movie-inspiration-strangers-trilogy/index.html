  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>The director, Renny Harlin, wanted to capture a nostalgic feel by utilizing practical sets, locations, and action in The Bricklayer.   The dedication and work ethic of Aaron Eckhart, who plays the lead character Steve Vail, impressed the director, as Eckhart did his own stunts and meticulously prepared for the role.   Nina Dobrev, who plays Kate in the film, surprised the director with her fearlessness in performing her own stunts and her fun and down-to-earth personality on set.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Bricklayer director Renny Harlin discusses taking inspiration from 1970s and 1980s action movies, his cast, and his upcoming Strangers trilogy.</p>
<p>The Bricklayer follows Steve Cail, a former CIA agent who gets called back into active duty from retirement. A rogue insurgent begins framing the U.S. for the assassination of foreign journalists in an attempt to blackmail. When it seems like their plan is working, the CIA needs to bring in their most rebellious and brilliant operative to stop the insurgent by whatever means necessary.</p>
<p>The Bricklayer is based on the 2010 novel written by Paul Lindsay under his pen name Noah Boyd. The Bricklayer stars Aaron Eckhart, Nina Dobrev, Tim Blake Nelson, Ilfenesh Hadera, and Clifton Collins Jr. Renny Harlin directed The Bricklayer from a script penned by Hanna Weg and Matt Johnson.</p>
<pre><code>              Die Hard 2: 5 Things It Got Right (&amp; 5 It Got Wrong)   While Die Hard 2 basically puts the events of the first movie in an airport, the John McClane action sequel has some highlights worth remembering.   
</code></pre>
<p>Screen Rant interviewed director Renny Harlin about his new action movie, The Bricklayer. He discussed being inspired by the action movies of the 1970s and 1980s to use practical sets and effects, as well as what drew him to the script. Harlin also praised the stars of the movie, Eckhart and Dobrev, and teased what fans can expect from the new Strangers trilogy.</p>
<p>Renny Harlin Talks The Bricklayer</p>
<p>Screen Rant: I loved The Bricklayer. It is action-packed, and it almost feels like a throwback film to a lot of the action movies that I kind of grew up with. You use practical sets, practical locations, and practical action. Was it important to you to capture that nostalgic feel?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: That was exactly my approach. Thank you. First of all, thank you for saying such complimentary things about the movie. It&rsquo;s very nice to hear.</p>
<p>Oh, I loved it.</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: Well, thank you so much. It was totally a throwback to the movies I grew up with, starting with the 1970s Don Siegel movies and Sam Peckinpah movies, and then going into the &rsquo;80s and even &rsquo;90s when I did some movies. I really wanted to go back to how I loved movies. I think that if I love, love it, I think other people will discover it too.
Of course there&rsquo;s a whole generation who have grown up with movies that are all CG and people can do crazy stunts because they are digital doubles and cars can do anything. It&rsquo;s like things are practically weightless because they are not real anymore. And I miss the time of actors doing stuff themselves and stunts men doing things and real sweat and blood going into the making of the movie. That was exactly my approach. There is practically nothing CG in the movie, and that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I love it because it brings this magic to the film that I feel has been missing in action films for so long now. What drew you to the story of The Bricklayer, and what elements of the script were you excited about as a filmmaker?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: Well, I guess any filmmaker making action movies or thrillers is always hoping for little slice of the 007 heaven. Irony is I was offered a James Bond movie in the &rsquo;90s, but I ended up turning it down. Now I felt like it&rsquo;s not James Bond, but it&rsquo;s still, it&rsquo;s a spy movie. There&rsquo;s something going way back to Hitchcock. There&rsquo;s something very romantic about that kind of movie. When I read the script, I loved it.
We worked on it quite a bit to make it work as well as possible. The book that it&rsquo;s based on is quite complex and there were so many sort of storylines and characters and twists and turns that we tried to streamline it without making it too simple and still keeping it surprising and hopefully misleading the audience into believing that certain characters represent certain things and then they don&rsquo;t. But this genre, of course, I think it&rsquo;s for any filmmaker, it&rsquo;s a very intriguing and fun genre.</p>
<p>I do want to talk about Aaron Eckhart for a second because he brought his A-game to this film. This movie makes him a bona fide action star. Can you talk about working with Aaron?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: Yeah. Aaron was the first person we offered the movie to and he just loved it. It was funny, we had a Zoom call just for me to introduce myself and what I was thinking about the movie. We said hello and I started talking and I said, &ldquo;Do you mind if I kind of tell you my vision of the movie?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Yeah, no, go ahead.&rdquo;
And so I kept talking for 45 minutes about how I saw the movie, how I saw his character, what his backstory was. In the end of the call, after I finished, after 45 minutes, I was like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I&rsquo;ve been ranting away here, but I had to get all this out.&rdquo; And he was like, &ldquo;Oh, no, no, that&rsquo;s great. I loved the script before I heard a word from you, and now that you&rsquo;ve told me your edition, it&rsquo;s like, I can&rsquo;t wait to do this movie.&rdquo; That was it.
He really trained. He lives in Montana on a ranch. He hired a boxing coach, actually. He didn&rsquo;t want to be a martial arts guy, but he just wanted to be kind of a good old-fashioned, hard hitting kind of a guy. And so he worked with a boxing coach for at least three or four months at his ranch every day.
He wanted to do it all himself. This is like every time you hear always this cliche about actors saying, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I did all my stunts.&rdquo; Some do, some don&rsquo;t, but in his case, he then spent several weeks in Greece where we shot with our stunt coordinator and their team practicing every fight.
It was really amazing because I mean, for example, there&rsquo;s a fight that is around the pool and the nightclub fight. He takes out 15 guys in it. I was able to literally shoot takes where I just followed him with a steady cam and he went through the entire choreography of all the 15 fights in like one take. It&rsquo;s like this is no BS that he really prepared for this movie. He was able to do everything himself and he was ready to do whatever it took [inaudible 00:06:04]. Yeah.</p>
<p>What surprised you the most about his dedication to the role and work ethic?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: I don&rsquo;t know. I mean, sometimes some people get some kind of a reputation from somewhere and then it just kind of follows them. And so I knew he was a great actor, but I don&rsquo;t know what I expected, if I expected him to be more method or serious or somebody who would question everything in the script.
That&rsquo;s maybe the point is that I was wondering if he&rsquo;s the kind of a person who will every day say, &ldquo;Oh, here&rsquo;s my notes and I rewrote this dialogue in this scene and I think this should go this way and not that way.&rdquo; But it was the opposite, which is also, by the way, the experience, I just worked with Sir Ben Kingsley. He said to me the simple thing, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Shakespearean actor, and we had a pretty good writer that we followed and we believed in his text. So that&rsquo;s how I was trained. Whatever is on the page, my job as an actor is to make the best version that I can from that text.&rdquo;
That was how Aaron approached the script. Like you said, he knew it by heart, he knew his lines, he knew everybody&rsquo;s lines. And when I suggested some things, I asked, &ldquo;Would you like this to be a little more this way or that way?&rdquo; he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all on the page. It&rsquo;s all perfect. I don&rsquo;t want to change anything. It&rsquo;s like, I&rsquo;d rather just have you say, &lsquo;We&rsquo;re going to do exactly what&rsquo;s on the page&rsquo; because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m prepared, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m ready to do.&rdquo;
Yeah, that was the biggest surprise, I would say. That he was so easy to work with because he was so prepared. I&rsquo;m also a very prepared director. I plan every shot beforehand. It just makes my job so easy when the actor knows everything that&rsquo;s going on in the story and in the script and in the scenes. And so we are on the same wavelength. We are sharing a brain and he can appreciate the fact that I&rsquo;m prepared and that I have really thought about how I&rsquo;m going to shoot the sequence. So he&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Okay, great. I know the sequence and now I understand how it&rsquo;s going to be shot and it all works together like a dance.&rdquo;
It was a great collaboration. As a sign of that, I guess, we just completed our second movie together. We just came back from Spain and New Zealand where we shot a new movie. So we just made our second movie and I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ll make more in the future.</p>
<p>Nina Dobrev can do it all. A lot of fans know her from The Vampire Diaries, but she really gets to flex her action muscle in this film. What surprised you the most about working with her and what she brought to the role of Kate?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: Well, what surprised me was that she was such a badass. She was another one who was more than willing to do all her stunts. And you can see it. I mean like the scenes in the car chase where she&rsquo;s just hanging out the window and shooting the gun. Somebody just asked me, &ldquo;You did that for real, right?&rdquo; We are on these narrow streets in this old part of town in Thessaloniki. Yeah, I mean it&rsquo;s like, of course we want to do everything safely, but if that car had veered for any reason right, it would shave her head clear off.
She was so game. She wanted to do everything herself. She wanted to do all the fighting. She wasn&rsquo;t afraid of anything. She wanted to be down and dirty. That was a surprise. And then another thing was just like, what a fun person, what a great person she is. She was just fun to work with, always a smile on her face, and fun to hang out with outside work. It&rsquo;s just great, great person, not a one millimeter of diva or anything like that.</p>
<p>I know that you worked on Die Hard 2 with Bruce Willis, and I love that rooftop scene where they fall over to the elevator in the rain. I love that scene. What can you tell me about what you took from the action of that experience and infused it into your future projects?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: Well, I would say that I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of action movies. That&rsquo;s what I grew up with. It was my dream to do that kind of movies. My goal from the very first movie I made has been to always try to put the audience in the driver&rsquo;s seat, make the audience experience what the characters experience.
Also in terms of violence, I&rsquo;m not afraid to show violence in movies, but I like to, is it realistic? Could this happen? Probably not. But I prefer action and violence that shows the consequences. If you get hit in the face or shot or whatever that might be, it hurts and you can feel that pain and you can see that pain instead of sort of cartoon violence where people are invincible and they can be punched 100 times and nothing happens and so on.
That&rsquo;s what I tried to do in Die Hard 2 and same thing still, and really put the audience there, make them experience what the characters experience and design shots that really suck the audience in. The same thing with Cliffhanger. I just wanted the audience to really feel like they are on that mountain. And same thing in this one.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re doing the upcoming Strangers trilogy. What can we expect from that? How much will it call back to the previous films of the franchise, and how far will the new franchise go?</p>
<p>Renny Harlin: My three movies, three chapters are based on the first original movie. They have nothing to do with any kind of sequels. Basically the first movie starts where the original movie started at. It&rsquo;s different. The character is a little different, the situation is a little different, but it&rsquo;s basically, you could say that it is a remake of the original movie, the first chapter.
But it does add and subtract and change things to a certain degree. But I think it was very important for the fans of the original movie to offer them the similar kind of an experience, but an updated version. And then we go exploring the things that were not answered in the original movie, such as who are the Strangers and why is this happening?
Of course, a lot of the appeal of the original movie is that you just don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s just random, completely blind, horrible violence. But we go deep. After the first movie, we start exploring who they are and we follow our main character, Madelaine Petsch, we follow her through these three movies. It&rsquo;s really her story, story of an ordinary girl in extraordinary circumstances and how it affects her, how she changes, what happens to her. By the end of the three movies, we&rsquo;ve answered a lot of the questions that everybody had after the original film.</p>
