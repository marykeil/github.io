## Literature Review

Adam Driver has said he&#39;s done with Star Wars, but is he just bluffing? Sadly, this recent quote suggests he&#39;s telling the truth after all.




Adam Driver, who played Kylo Ren in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, really does sound as though he&#39;s done with the franchise. The main villain of the sequel trilogy, Kylo Ren was redeemed in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker - only to follow his grandfather&#39;s example, and die saving someone he loved. Still, death has always been something of a revolving door for Star Wars, and there&#39;s been intense speculation Kylo Ren could return in Rey&#39;s upcoming New Jedi Order movie - whether in the flesh or as a Force Ghost. Driver himself has insisted he&#39;s done with Star Wars, but many insists he&#39;s just following the pattern of Andrew Garfield, who denied he was in Spider-Man: No Way Home - right up to the moment he appeared in the movie.




Sadly, speaking to the SmartLess podcast, Driver actually explained his reasoning. According to the actor, he found making a blockbuster like Star Wars to be very difficult indeed. &#34;Star Wars was way more exhausting for me,&#34; he explained. &#34;I made it more exhausting than it should have been. I hadnâ€™t quite figured out the momentum of a set that was that big before.&#34; Driver&#39;s point is a simple one; the pressure of making a blockbuster like Star Wars means everything is done at a certain pace, and he didn&#39;t enjoy it.

 Adam Driver&#39;s Reasoning Makes Sense, Even If It Will Disappoint Fans 
          




Adam Driver&#39;s argument is a simple one, and it implies he simply isn&#39;t comfortable with that kind of scale. What is most striking, though, is the tone of his reflection; it&#39;s the perspective of someone who is looking back on a chapter of their life that has now come to an end. It is that tone, more than anything else, that really does suggest Driver isn&#39;t bluffing, and his Star Wars story really is over.

Driver&#39;s Star Wars co-star Daisy Ridley is due to return in an upcoming movie, directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. It remains to be seen whether other members of the sequel trilogy cast will reprise their roles as well. For now, though, all evidence suggests Adam Driver is out.
