## Literature Review

Recent news about Michael B. Jordan&#39;s involvement in Creed 4 means the Rocky franchise is breaking an 8-year trend that puts him in rare company.




The latest update for Michael B. Jordan and Creed 4 means the franchise is breaking an eight-year trend. Michael B. Jordan took on an elevated role in regard to the Creed franchise with the third installment. Not only was it the first movie not to include Sylvester Stallone&#39;s Rocky Balboa and his shadow over Adonis Creed, but the sequel served as the directorial debut for Michael B. Jordan. This mark was not specific to the franchise itself, as Creed III was the first movie that the franchise star directed in his entire career. It has now been confirmed that Michael B. Jordan is directing Creed 4 as well.




The likelihood of Creed 4 happening grew in the lead-up to the third film&#39;s release, as reviews were overwhelmingly positive and Jordan made his intentions known about expanding the franchise in various directions. That brought with it the hope that the franchise star would remain just as focused on being a significant steward of the franchise behind the camera in addition to his work in front of it. Now that it has been stated that he will be directing the fourth installment of the franchise, that intention is guaranteed. It also means that the Creed franchise is doing something it never has before.

                  Creed 4 Will Likely Break A 38-Year-Old Rocky Franchise Record If It Continues This Sequel Trend   Creed 4 is in development with Michael B. Jordan as director, and if it follows this Rocky franchise trend, it could be the biggest outing yet.   


 Creed 4 Is The Franchise&#39;s First Movie To Not Change Its Director 
         




Irwin Winkler confirmed the return of Michael B. Jordan as Creed 4&#39;s director, making it the first movie in the Rocky spinoff franchise to keep the previous film&#39;s director. The idea for the series was originally the creation of Ryan Coogler, and it was his work on the first Creed that proved the franchise was back in a major way. The film&#39;s success brought opportunities for him to do much more, such as helming Black Panther for Marvel Studios. That decision meant Ryan Coogler could not return to direct Creed II, leading to Steven Caple Jr. taking over the director&#39;s chair.

The sequel was another strong success for the franchise, providing Caple Jr. with a chance to helm Transformers: Rise of the Beasts next. His exit left the job open for Michael B. Jordan to fill. It could have been easy for Creed 4 to continue the franchise&#39;s trend of letting a new voice take control with each new installment. In doing so, the Creed movies might have helped elevate another Black director&#39;s standing in Hollywood, but it also brings more risk that a new take could swing the series in the wrong direction.






 Creed 4 Puts Michael B. Jordan In Rare Territory For The Rocky Franchise 
          

Michael B. Jordan&#39;s decision to direct Creed 4 also has a greater significance in terms of the Rocky franchise overall. It makes him one of three people to direct multiple movies in the series. Sylvester Stallone became the first person to direct multiple Rocky movies by helming Rocky II and Rocky III back-to-back. He went on to then direct Rocky IV, took a break for the fifth installment, and then returned to behind the camera for Rocky Balboa. Other than Stallone, John G. Avildsen is the only other person to direct more than one installment, as he helmed Rocky and Rocky IV.

The elevation of Michael B. Jordan&#39;s presence in the overall Rocky franchise history is notable. He still needs several more sequels to match Sylvester Stallone&#39;s records for directing and starring in this franchise, but it is quite clear that he&#39;s committed to steering the universe in the right direction. In addition to being the third person to direct at least two movies in the franchise, Creed 3 and Creed 4 will mark the first time since 1985 that a Rocky sequel retains the previous installment&#39;s director.






 Michael B. Jordan Returning To Direct Creed 4 Is Great After Creed 3 
          

The franchise keeping Michael B. Jordan around as Creed 4&#39;s director also happens to be great news following the performance of and reception to Creed 3. The movie brought the spinoff franchise&#39;s best villain to life, as Damian&#39;s story and arc were given equal weight and attention as Adonis&#39;. This move was likely done in part to free up Michael B. Jordan from having as much screentime as past installments so he could adjust to directing, but the results speak for themselves. That provides hope that Creed 4 will again feature a great villain, all while building up Amara&#39;s story as Adonis&#39; replacement.

The other exciting aspect of Michael B. Jordan&#39;s return for Creed 4 comes with seeing how he will evolve the fights again. Creed 3&#39;s fight scenes were unlike anything else featured in the previous Creed or Rocky movies, as Jordan brought his love of anime to the series for some truly unique sequences. Now that he has established that baseline for how different the fights can be, there is room for him to push the envelope further in the sequel.
