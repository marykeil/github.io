## Literature Review

Kamala Khan&#39;s Ms. Marvel received a brilliant power upgrade in Phase 5&#39;s The Marvels, which has now been explained in a new deleted scene.




A new deleted scene from The Marvels explains a major power upgrade for Kamala Khan&#39;s Ms. Marvel in the Phase 5 crossover film. Following her MCU debut in 2022&#39;s Ms. Marvel on Disney&#43;, Iman Vellani&#39;s Kamala Khan joined Brie Larson&#39;s Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, and Teyonah Parris&#39; Monica Rambeau, a.k.a. Photon, on an epic cosmic adventure in 2023&#39;s The Marvels. While the Phase 5 movie garnered a disappointing reception at the box office, Vellani&#39;s young superhero has been celebrated as one of the project&#39;s strongest elements, and The Marvels developed Kamala Khan&#39;s MCU storyline in huge ways. This included gifting her a new superhero suit with some exciting upgrades.




After Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan arrive on the musical world of Aladna in The Marvels, the trio are given new superhero costumes before engaging in battle with Zawe Ashton&#39;s villainous Dar-Benn. These costumes come with some new capabilities, specifically Ms. Marvel&#39;s, which puts a spin on her original suit by allowing her to use her scarf as a powerful whip. This power upgrade wasn&#39;t explained in The Marvels, but a new deleted scene released by USA Today confirms that Kamala herself suggested making her scarf whippable. The Marvels marked Kamala&#39;s first major battle in the MCU, so it makes sense that she&#39;d want to be completely battle-ready.


 

                  The Marvels Finally Justifies The MCU Phase 4&#39;s Most Controversial Superpower Change   The latest trailer for The Marvels proves that Kamala Khan&#39;s comic powers were changed in the MCU to link her to Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau.    





 Ms. Marvel Hasnâ€™t Lost Her More Meaningful Superhero Costume 
         

When the first trailers and images were released for The Marvels, many expressed concerns that Kamala Khan was set to be gifted a new costume after only just acquiring her first one in Ms. Marvel&#39;s series finale in Phase 4. Kamala&#39;s costume in Ms. Marvel was incredibly meaningful, as it was compiled by collected objects that her mother pieced together, including a scarf from Kareem, a Red Dagger, the lightning symbol from her broken necklace, and a mask that Bruno Carrelli had gifted to her. The fact that Ms. Marvel didn&#39;t sport this costume in The Marvels&#39; trailers led many to worry that the meaningful outfit had already been replaced.

Luckily, however, this more meaningful costume hasn&#39;t been completely replaced, as Iman Vellani has confirmed that Kamala Khan still has her original costume. During an interview with The Direct, Vellani noted how Kamala changed upon returning home at the beginning of The Marvels after her battle alongside Nick Fury, meaning her original costume was safe as home before she traveled to Aladna. Since Kamala Khan has two superhero suit options after the events of The Marvels, it will be interesting to see which one she decides to sport in Ms. Marvel&#39;s future MCU appearances.
