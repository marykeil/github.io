## Literature Review

Ali Larter&#39;s Clear dies in Final Destination 2 but the real reason behind her death reveals that her ending in the franchise could have been different




Clear&#39;s Final Destination journey ends in the film series&#39; second installment, but there is a hidden reason why her character was killed off before the third movie. The first Final Destination movie introduces Clear Rivers as one of the main characters who board VolÃ©e Airlines Flight 180 but end up leaving the flight after Alex Browning foresees that it will explode. Their initial brush with doom turns into a nightmare when death starts trailing them because of their initial defiance towards it.




Although many survivors from the plane eventually meet a brutal death, Clear and Alex somehow keep outsmarting their fate and end up surviving by the end of the first Final Destination movie. Unfortunately, even though their pursuit of beating their destiny continues in Final Destination, their deaths eventually catch up with them. Although Clear finally dies in Final Destination 2, the film&#39;s creator initially had different plans for her character.

                  Final Destination: Every Death Rule (&amp; Exception) Explained   The Final Destination franchise focuses on Death&#39;s design, which is constantly changing; here is every death rule and their exceptions explained.    


 Final Destination&#39;s Creator Always Intended To Kill Off Ali Larter&#39;s Clear 
         

Final Destination&#39;s creator, Jeffrey Reddick, revealed (via Collider) that killing off Ali Carter&#39;s Clear was always in the script. However, he wanted to bring back both Alex and Clear for another installment of the movie franchise. Unfortunately, some scheduling issues prevented him from bringing back Devon Sawa. Reddick also added that if things had been different and Ali Carter and Devon Sawa had returned, Clear would still have died, but Alex would have lived.




He wanted to create an ending where Clear &#34;has a life that saves her life, but then death gets her once she has the kid, and Alex is still kind of the torch-bearer.&#34; The screenwriter also mentioned that he would not have killed off Clear if he had known Alex would not return because he loves &#34;bringing original people back&#34; and not &#34;killing them.&#34; As Reddick&#39;s early plans for the movie franchise suggest, Clear&#39;s Final Destination arc would have been significantly different if he had been prepared for Devon Bawa&#39;s departure.



 Clear&#39;s Arc In Final Destination 2 Could Have Been Way Different 
          

The first movie in the franchise has two deleted scenes that reveal Clear was pregnant with Alex&#39;s child. Final Destination 1 also has an alternate ending where Clear meets a different fate. Both Clear and Alex survive the incident at Clear&#39;s house in Final Destination&#39;s ending arc, allowing them to return for the sequel. In the alternate ending, however, Alex perishes, but Clear manages to defy death in the nick of time. Before the film&#39;s credits start rolling, Clear has a baby, Alex Browning II. Although bittersweet compared to the original ending, this one did not make it to the final cut because Jeffrey Reddick wanted both characters to return for the sequel and was unprepared for Devon Bawa&#39;s sudden departure after Final Destination 2.
