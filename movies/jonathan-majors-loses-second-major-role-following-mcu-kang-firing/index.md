## Literature Review

Jonathan Majors loses a second major role following his recent firing from playing the MCU villain Kang amidst his ongoing legal issues.




The fallout of Jonathan Majors’ ongoing legal drama continues, with the beleaguered actor losing another major role in 48 Hours in Vegas weeks after being fired from playing Kang in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The controversy surrounding the actor came to public attention when he was arrested on accusations of assault in March 2023, and he would later be convicted in December of misdemeanor assault and harassment. Shortly after the announcement of his verdict, Marvel Studios announced they had cut ties with Majors, though they have not yet revealed their intentions regarding his character.




A new report from Variety has confirmed that Majors has also been released from his role as Dennis Rodman in a project that had been using the working title 48 Hours In Vegas. Initially reported by CNN, Majors&#39; role was set to see him recreate Rodman’s famous trip to Las Vegas during the 1998 NBA finals, a tale that was also featured in the Michael Jordan docuseries The Last Dance. Lionsgate, who had been developing the project, has now released it back to producers Phil Lord, Chris Miller and Aditya Sood. Ari Lubet, Will Allegra and Rodman were also set to serve as executive producers.


 What We Know About Majors’ Lost Dennis Rodman Movie 
          

First announced in August 2021, 48 Hours in Vegas was set to be another exciting role for Majors, who was quickly proving himself a rising star with immense prospects. Fresh off the success of the critically acclaimed HBO series Lovecraft County and the Spike Lee war drama Da 5 Bloods, the actor had once been firmly on track to becoming one of Hollywood’s most sought-after new actors, despite only making his onscreen debut a few years previously in the 2017 miniseries When We Rise.




Based on a screenplay by Jordan VanDina, Majors’ Rodman movie was set to focus on the controversial NBA player’s rowdy 48-hour vacation to Las Vegas with the Chicago Bulls’ assistant general manager in the middle of the 1998 NBA Finals run against the Utah Jazz. At the time of the movie’s original announcement, Lord and Miller had stated that while the film would follow Rodman’s wild antics, it would also raise “important questions about the way public figures, and workers, are treated, especially when their individuality is expressed so vividly.”

                  Last Dance Leaves Out Rodman&#39;s FIRST Vegas Trip: What Happened In 1997   The Last Dance chronicles Dennis Rodman&#39;s Las Vegas vacation during the 1998 NBA Finals, but leaves out his first trip there on the Bulls&#39; time.   

While it is not yet clear whether 48 Hours in Vegas will be able to contend with losing both its leading actor and its original studio, the intriguing premise and the outrageous and highly public nature of the man on whom it is based would suggest it may still find fresh life elsewhere. Meanwhile, the fate of Majors’ once promising career is looking increasingly bleak for the beleaguered actor, who is still yet to face sentencing for his conviction in early February.
