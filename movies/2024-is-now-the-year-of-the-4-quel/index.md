# 2024 Is Now The Year Of The 4-quel


## SUMMARY 



  2024 will see the release of several highly-anticipated 4-quels in popular franchises, including Kung Fu Panda 4, Despicable Me 4, and Bad Boys 4.   Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes may be considered the best 4-quel in terms of quality, based on the critical success of the reboot franchise.   Despicable Me 4 is expected to be the highest-grossing 4-quel at the box office, given the franchise&#39;s previous earnings exceeding $1 billion worldwide.

## Literature Review
While sequels, prequels, and spinoffs continue to fill out movie release calendars, 2024 will also see a group of fourth installments, or “4-quels.”




2024 will be another monumental year for movies, but it&#39;s also setting up to be the year of the &#34;4-quel.&#34; After hitting the trilogy mark, the next step is crossing into fourth-entry territory with the third sequel or 4-quel. Mad Max: Fury Road is probably the best 4-quel in recent memory, coming 30 years after the third movie. Some other notable 4-quels include Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Jurassic World, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.




As continuations of popular franchises remain a priority for studios, it&#39;s no surprise that 2024&#39;s movie release calendar is full of sequels, prequels, and spinoffs. Dune: Part Two is the first major sequel to make up the year&#39;s slate, but some other highly-anticipated movies in 2024 include Twisters, Beetlejuice 2, Gladiator 2, Furiosa, Alien: Romulus, Deadpool 3, Inside Out 2, and Ballerina, the John Wick spinoff. That said, there are also a handful of 4-quels to look forward to.

 2024 Has A Lot Of 4th Movies Coming Out 
   Close     

In 2024, six major franchises plan to release the fourth installment in their current film series. Three from the group are traditional 4-quels, serving as the fourth entry in the franchise&#39;s history. Dreamworks will lead the pack with Kung Fu Panda 4, releasing eight years after the previous movie made over half a billion at the box office worldwide. Fellow animation studio Illumination will also debut a long-awaited sequel, Despicable Me 4, returning to the core series after the prequel follow-up Minions: The Rise of Gru released in 2022. Then there&#39;s Bad Boys 4, which will feature reprisals from series stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence.




Aside from that group of 4-quels, three others are technically fourth entries but not in the traditional sense. Paul Rudd is returning as Gary Grooberson in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, the fourth installment in the main Ghostbusters canonical series. 2024 will also see the fourth chapter on Legendary&#39;s Monsterverse with Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, as well as Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Though it&#39;s the tenth Planet of the Apes movie in history, Wes Ball&#39;s upcoming movie is the fourth in the reboot series.

 Movie  Release Date   Kung Fu Panda 4  March 8, 2024   Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire  March 29, 2024   Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  April 12, 2024   Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes  May 24, 2024   Bad Boys 4  June 14, 2024   Despicable Me 4  July 3, 2024   








 Which Of 2024&#39;s &#34;4-quels&#34; Will Be The Best? 
          

Out of 2024&#39;s group of upcoming 4-quels, it&#39;s difficult to predict which title will end up being considered the &#34;best&#34; out of that group in terms of quality. The safe bet would probably be Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes being the best of the group, considering the reboot franchise&#39;s critical appeal. The reboot launched in 2011 with great ratings, but those numbers have grown with each entry, topping off at 94% on Rotten Tomatoes with War for the Planet of the Apes.

Of course, Kung Fu Panda has also never had a bad entry when it comes to theatrical releases. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire also has the potential to be the best of the bunch despite the added nostalgic pressure. Frozen Empire&#39;s trailer confirmed plenty of elements from the &#39;80s, which could be beneficial considering the first movie is still the highest-rated. While Bad Boys&#39; third movie, Bad Boys for Life, which would have been more fitting for the 4-quel title, scored higher than the previous movies, it&#39;s probably on the lower end for expectations within the group.






 Which Of 2024&#39;s &#34;4-quels&#34; Will Be The Biggest? 
          

In truth, all six major 4-quels set to release in 2024 could be good, and that would be remarkable for moviegoers. However, the most significant success will come down to the box office earnings. Despicable Me&#39;s main movie series may have dipped in quality, but the franchise&#39;s box office surely implies that Despicable Me 4 will be the highest-grossing at the box office. Aside from the first movie, all sequels and prequel entries made close to or over $1 billion worldwide. Kung Fu Panda 4 will also carry the family appeal, elevating the ceiling at the box office, but Despicable Me as an IP is more massive.

With Godzilla as a franchise seemingly more popular than ever, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see Godzilla x Kong: New Empire cross the $500 million mark. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will also likely be a heavy-hitter at the box office, but it has tough competition on release, with Furiosa and The Garfield Movie debuting the same day. Ghostbusters: The Frozen Empire and Bad Boys 4 feel like the two wildcards, depending more on reviews and word-of-mouth depending on quality. As long as all of the group hits their planned release, 2024 will officially hold the title of the year of the 4-quel.
