## Literature Review

Although audiences never saw these important movie characters die, they still left an indelible impact on everyone that they left behind.




Important movie characters who were killed offscreen leave the audience to grapple with the impact and mystery surrounding their deaths. This narrative choice allows viewers to fill in the gaps with their imagination. Moreover, the absence of a direct portrayal often heightens the emotional weight of the character&#39;s departure, as the audience must rely on the reactions of other characters and the aftermath on their lives.
Indeed, shocking offscreen character deaths in movies can serve as powerful storytelling devices, emphasizing the unpredictability of life within the cinematic narrative. Without the actual visual of a character dying, it&#39;s often easier for audiences to move straight into pondering that cast member&#39;s legacy, as well as the unresolved questions surrounding their fate. Whatever the circumstances of their deaths, important movie characters who were killed offscreen are also typically more memorable than those whose sordid fates were plainly revealed. These characters are proof that, even in the visual world of film, the viewer&#39;s imagination can be just as powerful as any cinematic spectacle.









 








 10  Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) 
True Grit (2010)


 







  True Grit  


  Release Date    December 22, 2010     Director    Ethan Coen , Joel Coen     Cast    Jeff Bridges , Barry Pepper , Josh Brolin , Matt Damon , Hailee Steinfeld     Runtime    110 minutes    


One of the reasons why the Coen brothers&#39; True Grit remake is superior to the original movie is because it&#39;s told from the perspective of Mattie Ross. However, the central antihero in this Western is Deputy U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, whom the child Mattie enlists in her quest for justice. Years after both survive True Grit&#39;s climax, a grown-up Mattie visits Cogburn - but Mattie arrives to find out that Cogburn had died just days before. True Grit ends with Mattie meditating upon Cogburn&#39;s death, his heroic actions, and her missing arm. Cogburn&#39;s offscreen demise allows viewers to reflect on his legacy and the impact he had on Mattie&#39;s life.





 9  King T&#39;Challa (Chadwick Boseman) 
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022)


 







  Black Panther: Wakanda Forever  


  Release Date    November 11, 2022     Director    Ryan Coogler     Cast    Winston Duke , Dominique Thorne , Michaela Coel , Danai Gurira , Angela Bassett , Lupita Nyong&#39;o , Letitia Wright , Martin Freeman     Runtime    2h 41m    


King T&#39;Challa died of a mysterious illness before the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Shuri and the other scientists of Wakanda didn&#39;t have enough time to cure T&#39;Challa&#39;s illness because the king hid it from the public, not wanting to cause alarm. Chadwick Boseman, who portrayed T&#39;Challa in the MCU, did the same when he was diagnosed with colon cancer. Indeed, King T&#39;Challa&#39;s offscreen death in Wakanda Forever is just one of the many ways in which the sequel paid tribute to the life of the franchise&#39;s original star. Though T&#39;Challa has joined his ancestors, the positive changes brought by his time as Wakanda&#39;s king live on.

 8  Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) 
No Country for Old Men (2007)
        

  No Country for Old Men  


  Release Date    November 21, 2007     Director    Joel Coen , Ethan Coen     Cast    Kelly Macdonald , Woody Harrelson , Josh Brolin , Javier Bardem , Tommy Lee Jones     Runtime    122 minutes    


After discovering a drug deal gone wrong and taking a suitcase full of money, Llewelyn Moss becomes the target of the relentless and enigmatic hitman, Anton Chigurh. Despite his resourcefulness, Moss cannot escape Chigurh&#39;s pursuit. Yet, the narrative promise of Chigurh finally killing Moss is never satisfied, as Moss not only dies offscreen, but also in the hands of other hitmen. Characteristic of how both the novel and the movie No Country for Old Men subvert expectations, Moss&#39; death accentuates the random, senseless violence of the Old West. After Moss fails to keep the dirty money, all that&#39;s left is a trail of blood and destruction in a motel room.





 7  Guido (Roberto Benigni) 
Life is Beautiful (1997)
        

Guido Orefice and his son Giosue are captured by the Nazis in the WWII film Life is Beautiful, a sad movie guaranteed to make viewers cry. To shield Giosue from the horrors of the concentration camp, Guido pretends that they&#39;re engaged in a game involving various tasks. In the third act, Guido prompts Giosue to hide inside a box for safety. As Guido is led off by a German soldier for execution, he winks at his son one last time, and gets shot to death offscreen. Plainly stated for the audience but still hidden from his son, Guido&#39;s offscreen death allows audiences a glimpse into Guido&#39;s selfless love for Giosue.





 6  Rosie Betzler (Scarlett Johansson) 
Jojo Rabbit (2019)
        

  Jojo Rabbit  


  Release Date    October 18, 2019     Director    Taika Waititi     Cast    Stephen Merchant , Sam Rockwell , Rebel Wilson , Taika Waititi , Alfie Allen , Thomasin McKenzie , Scarlett Johansson , Roman Griffin Davis     Runtime    108minutes    


A single mother living in WWII Germany, Rosie Betzler is secretly part of the German resistance against the Nazis. Eventually, Rosie is revealed to have been captured and hanged offscreen for her anti-Nazi sentiments. Her death deeply impacts her son Jojo, an indoctrinated junior member of the Hitler Youth suddenly confronted with the reality of the Nazi regime. Rather than showing how Rosie was killed, audiences are left with the subtly nightmarish cropped shot of Jojo desperately hugging the legs of Rosie&#39;s hanging body, recognizable only by her signature red shoes. Combined with the movie&#39;s humor, the clever reveal of Rosie&#39;s offscreen demise underscores Jojo Rabbit&#39;s dark themes.

 5  Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb) 
Bridge to Terabithia (2007)
        

Bridge to Terabithia is largely remembered for the unexpected and tragic death of Leslie, who dies when she swings over a rope over a creek in the forest, and the rope snaps. Leslie was headed to Terabithia, the fantasy world made up by her and her playmate and neighbor Jess. As Jess didn&#39;t witness Leslie&#39;s offscreen death, he joins the audience in disbelief of Leslie&#39;s fate, until Jess sees the snapped rope for himself alongside emergency vehicles surrounding her house. Highlighting the fragility of life and the impact of loss on young hearts, Bridge to Terabithia uses Leslie&#39;s death as a pivotal moment for Jess&#39; character development.





 4  Tracy Mills (Gwyneth Paltrow) 
Seven (1999)
        

  Se7en  


  Release Date    September 22, 1995     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Brad Pitt , gwyneth paltrow , John C. McGinley , Morgan Freeman , Kevin Spacey     Runtime    127 minutes    


In the iconic ending of David Fincher&#39;s Seven, detectives David Mills and William Somerset are confronted with a terrible surprise: the head of Mills&#39; wife Tracy delivered to them in a box. This is the killer John Doe&#39;s last successful bid to complete his sick masterpiece - embodying the sin of envy by being jealous of Mills&#39; life, and then prompting Mills to embody wrath by shooting him in the head. Apart from Tracy&#39;s death occurring offscreen, her disembodied head isn&#39;t shown onscreen either. After Seven shocked audiences with various grim scenes of John Doe&#39;s handiwork, Tracy&#39;s unexpected and unseen demise is impactful without the need for further bloody imagery.

 3  The Girl in Red (Oliwia DÄ…browska) 
Schindler&#39;s List (1993)
        

Shot almost entirely in black-and-white, Schindler&#39;s List is about businessman and Nazi Party member Oskar Schindler. At the Krakow Ghetto, Schindler considers the Jews as a nuisance, until he witnesses them getting massacred. In particular, Schindler sees an unnamed Jewish girl in a red coat - the sole shade of color in the entire movie - hiding from the Nazis. Schindler later sees the girl&#39;s red coat in a wagon of corpses, after she had been executed offscreen. Though entirely bereft of actual violence, this brilliant moment is a haunting reminder of the Holocaust, and is inferred to be when Schindler started to shift his focus towards saving Jewish lives.





 2  Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) 
Brokeback Mountain (2005)


 







  Brokeback Mountain  


  Release Date    January 13, 2006     Director    Ang Lee     Cast    Jake Gyllenhaal , Heath Ledger , Michelle Williams     Runtime    134 minutes    


Cowboys Jack and Ennis are entangled in a love affair while working at Brokeback Mountain, one of the LGBTQ&#43; movies that forever changed cinema. After they part ways, Ennis is sent back a postcard that he previously addressed to Jack. When Ennis calls Jack&#39;s wife Lureen, she informs him that Jack died from a tire exploding in his face. However, Ennis knows in his heart that it was a hate crime that led to Jack&#39;s brutal fate. Jack dying offscreen - alongside the complex aftermath of his death on his family - highlights the pain that Jack and Ennis went through as secret gay lovers in a homophobic world.





 1  Earth-42 Jeff Morales (Brian Tyree Henry) 
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)
        

  Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  


  Release Date    June 2, 2023     Director    Joaquim Dos Santos , Kemp Powers , Justin K. Thompson     Cast    Shameik Moore , Hailee Steinfeld , Oscar Isaac , Jake Johnson , Issa Rae , Brian Tyree Henry , Luna Lauren Velez , Jorma Taccone , Jason Schwartzman     Runtime    120 Minutes    


The death of Miles&#39; dad Jeff Morales is a complex aspect of the multiversal plot of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. After trying to save Jeff from his fated death - a &#34;canon event&#34; in Miles&#39; dimension - Miles ends up on Earth-42 instead of home. There, he sees a mural paying tribute to his father, confirming that Jeff died in this dimension. Yet, the fate of Jeff from Miles&#39; home dimension is left uncertain - and even more obscured by the offscreen death of Jeff from Earth-42. Ultimately, the resulting ambiguity serves to lay the foundations for the undoubtedly epic twists to come in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.
