## Literature Review

Disney&#39;s Wish manages to gain traction at the international box office despite months of struggling to perform domestically against a high budget.




Wish gains steam at the worldwide box office after failing to make a splash in the United States. Wish is a Disney animated musical surrounding the story of a young woman named Asha who makes a wish upon a star that ends up not going according to her plan. The film is co-directed by Chris Buck and Fawn Veerasunthorn and stars a leading voice cast of Ariana DeBose, Harvey Guillén, Chris Pine, Alan Tudyk, and Angelique Cabral.




As per Collider, Wish continues on strong at the worldwide box office despite its paltry domestic box office performance. According to the source, Wish has now made $223.4 million at the worldwide box office, with $160.4 million of that coming from overseas. The film has been successful in a number of international markets, including Spain, Australia, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Japan.


 Wish’s Box Office Performance Explained 
          

While Wish’s international performance is impressive, this total comes after the film has consistently underperformed on U.S. soil. The Disney musical was released over Thanksgiving weekend, and made only $31 million domestically. Wish has since shown some staying power by doubling that total, but still its domestic box office comes out to only $63 million overall, far lower than the international showing.






The film’s resilience in the international market bodes well for Wish as its digital release gives it the opportunity for a streaming renaissance after a rough theatrical record.




The worldwide box office for Wish shows that the film has momentum, though it may not be enough to save the film. Wish was made on a reported budget of $200 million, which is a fairly hefty sum for an original animated musical. With a worldwide box office total of only $223.4 million, Wish would still have to maintain substantial momentum in order to be significantly profitable over this hefty budget.

Not all hope is gone for Wish’s success story, however. Wish’s VOD release date was recently revealed to be January 23, meaning the film will soon be available for at-home purchase. The film’s resilience in the international market bodes well for Wish as its digital release gives it the opportunity for a streaming renaissance after a rough theatrical record.
