Margot Robbie responds to her rumored role in the Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie. Following the billion-dollar Barbie movie, Robbie is set to reunite with Ryan Gosling in the planned Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie, and the two are rumored to be playing Danny Ocean&#39;s parents.

In a new interview with Variety, Robbie and her LuckyChap producing partners, husband Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara, responded to Clooney&#39;s comments about the Ocean’s 11 prequel movie. Robbie is &#34;chuffed&#34; by Clooney&#39;s &#34;extremely high praise,&#34; though Ackerley clarified that Robbie and Gosling&#39;s rumored roles haven&#39;t been &#34;confirmed or denied&#34; and raised the possibility that Danny Ocean&#39;s parents might not even be in the prequel movie. Read their full comments below:


Robbie: Honestly, I’m so chuffed to hear that. That is extremely high praise. Wow, how exciting!
Ackerley: That wasn’t a plot point that we’ve confirmed or denied. We’re still working on the script.
Robbie: So I don’t know who his parents will ultimately be or not be…
Ackerley: Or if their parents are even in the movie.
McNamara: I wish I could be on the gossip channels all this information comes from. We hear it in the office.
Robbie: I also read so much stuff that’s not true. “Margot Robbie’s doing that!” And I’m like, “I’m 100% not and I’ve never even heard that.” I know people do that just to whip up a buying frenzy. I mean, we should take it as a compliment.





                  Margot Robbie’s Ocean’s 11 Prequel Can Fix A Long-Running Franchise Problem   The Ocean&#39;s Eleven franchise is being rebooted for a third time with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, and it could fix a major series casting problem.   


 Everything We Know About The Ocean&#39;s Eleven Prequel Movie 
          

Robbie and Gosling have been attached to the planned Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie since May 2022, before Barbie was released, but there hasn&#39;t been much official information on who they will be playing. This is likely because they are still in the process of penning the script, as Ackerley says, and any character details are subject to change. Carrie Solomon, who wrote the upcoming film A Family Affair, is reportedly penning the script.

Jay Roach is attached to direct the Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie, reuniting with Robbie after Bombshell. The director has revealed that the movie is set during 1962 in Monte Carlo, seemingly at the Monte Carlo Casino, the target of the central heist. Roach also revealed that, while the prequel continues the franchise identity of heist movies, it&#39;s also &#34;very much a love story.&#34; However, the producers aren&#39;t ready to reveal anything concrete about Robbie and Gosling&#39;s roles in the Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie.






There is no timetable for when the Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel movie will start filming.
