# The Omen s Prequel Movie Just Copied A $217 Million Horror Hit From 2022


## SUMMARY 



  The First Omen copies a signature scene from a 2023 horror film, which could make it seem uninspired compared to original horror movies.   The trailer for The First Omen has a creative and haunting backward play trick, but the blatant nod to a recent horror hit is disappointing.   Original horror movies like Smile and M3GAN have been more exciting and successful than remakes and reboots, making it challenging for The First Omen to impress horror fans.

## Literature Review

In a move that doesn’t bode well for the prequel, The First Omen’s debut trailer features a blatant borrow from a recent original horror hit.




The First Omen has already replicated a signature scene from another recent horror hit that proved a sleeper success in 2022. It is not unusual for horror movies to borrow shots from one another. The history of the genre is filled with instances of directors copying elements from their influences, and a lot of these inspired homages can end up creating iconic moments of their own while introducing viewers to genre classics. However, there is a difference between a loving nod to an earlier movie and a shameless instance of copying something popular.




Unfortunately, the Omen prequel The First Omen has already gotten off to a bad start in this regard. The upcoming horror movie follows a young American woman sent to Rome to work for the church, only to discover a labyrinthine conspiracy to bring about the birth of the Antichrist upon her arrival. While this plot does blend elements of the original Omen with Suspiria and The Nun, that is the sort of playful borrowing that can make for a fun viewing experience. It is a more specific and unmistakable nod in The First Omen&#39;s trailer that makes the movie look uninspired.



The First Omen will be released in theaters on April 5, 2024.





 The First Omen Is Copying Smile&#39;s Best Horror Trick 
          




About 33 seconds into The First Omen’s teaser trailer, the screen flashes with an image of a woman smiling a creepy, serene smile while lying on an operating table. This looks uncannily like a shot from Smile, the 2022 sleeper hit that earned over $217 million on a budget of only $17 million. Like the creepy yet genuine smiles featured in Smile, The First Omen’s unsettling rictus grin doesn’t seem to be augmented by CGI. While earlier horror movies like 2018’s Truth or Dare used goofy special effects to enhance their supposedly scary grins, Smile and The First Omen’s smiles look more natural and, as a result, more disquieting.


 

It is something of a letdown to see such an obvious borrow featured in The First Omen’s earliest promo, especially considering the invention present in the rest of the trailer. The First Omen’s trailer plays backward, a nifty trick that makes its action feel haunting and distinctly off. This alone could have made the prequel intriguing, so the addition of a flagrant nod to a recent genre hit was unfortunate. Especially after 2023’s disappointing sequel The Exorcist: Believer, The First Omen will need to feel more vital and original to earn a place in the crowded landscape of contemporary cinematic horror.






Smile is available to stream on Prime Video, Paramount&#43;, and MGM&#43;.






 The First Omen Repeating Smile Proves Original Movies Are Better For Horror 
          

Critics and viewers seem to agree that, when it comes to horror, original movies like Smile and M3GAN are more exciting than endless remakes, reboots, and re-imaginings of classics. Although Evil Dead Rise and Scream VI were both hits in 2023, M3GAN and Smile were both unexpectedly massive successes with smaller budgets. Terrifier 2 and Skinamarink proved that even micro-budget indies could be more exciting than major studio fare, while The Exorcist: Believer showed that the most prestigious franchises could spawn unworthy follow-ups. With this track record in mind, it will be tough for The First Omen to win over horror fans upon release.
