## Literature Review

An upcoming live-action adaptation is an incredibly exciting prospect but it will certainly struggle to adapt one of the best anime films ever made. 




Another exciting live-action adaptation is in the works, but unlike others, it faces the massive challenge of adapting one of the best anime movies ever. For a long time, live-action anime adaptations did not have a good reputation because most failed to capture the essence of their source materials. Netflix&#39;s Death Note, for instance, not only failed to recreate the white-knuckling game of cat-and-mouse that ensues between Light and L in the original anime but also struggled to effectively create a compelling narrative around the titular Death Note.




Although Cowboy Bebop was significantly better than Death Note, it still could not be as memorable as Shinichiro Watanabe&#39;s original anime. One Piece, in contrast, has been a game-changer for live-action anime adaptations. The Netflix adaptation of the long-running anime proved that it is possible to create captivating renditions of beloved anime in the live-action medium. However, even though One Piece paved the way for future live-action anime adaptations to succeed, one upcoming anime remake faces a unique set of problems that even Netflix&#39;s One Piece formula cannot solve.

                  Netflixâ€™s Best &amp; Worst Anime Adaptations Proved A Popular Live-Action Fan Belief Wrong   Many beliefs and assumptions surrounding live-action anime still exist, but one was proven completely wrong by Netflix&#39;s best and worst adaptations.   


 A Live-Action Your Name Remake Would Be Very Difficult To Pull Off

Your Name is often touted as one of the best anime movies of all time, and rightfully so. The perfection with which the movie weaves themes of reality, dreams, time, space, and culture into one narrative is truly remarkable. Although, on the surface, Your Name is about two characters switching bodies, a concept several Hollywood films have adopted in the past, the film stands out because it transcends the boundaries of the romance genre. Despite having a complex storyline that involves multiple meta-narratives, parallel timelines, and cosmic elements, the film presents itself in a way that seems both thought-provoking and comprehensible.

It would be incredibly hard for a live-action movie to pull off the same balance between spectacle and intricate storytelling without loyally adapting every story beat from the original animated movie. And even if it does manage to seamlessly traverse the film&#39;s complex sci-fi ideas to the live-action medium, the movie will struggle with recreating the anime&#39;s visuals. Makoto Shinkai has the unique ability to use animation as a device to portray the essence of life and culture in Japan. Nearly every frame in his movies, especially in Your Name, is crafted with attention to detail and artistry that seems to go beyond what live-action cinematography can achieve. This makes it nearly impossible for the live-action Your Name to recreate the sense of wonder that the original film brings to the table with its visuals.





 

Live-action movies are also often believed to be more important than their animated counterparts by studios. One of the primary reasons behind this is the perceived broader market appeal of live-action films and their increased likelihood of achieving global recognition and rewards. Because of these flawed beliefs surrounding animation, studios often make creative decisions that compromise the unique artistic qualities of the original animated movie. If the same happens with Your Name, its live-action adaptation will not even come close to being as spectacular as the original.



 Why Live-Action Your Name Would Be Even Trickier Than Other Anime Adaptations 
Live-action Your Name faces a unique anime adaptation challenge
          




One Piece&#39;s live-action was successful primarily because the show&#39;s creators were able to draw some guidance from its original manga. The original manga not only offered a well-defined narrative structure to the show&#39;s creators but also gave them a basic visual reference of what the characters, settings, and key elements of the overarching story should look like. Netflix&#39;s Cowboy Bebop, on the other hand, failed because it was based on Shinichiro Watanabe&#39;s original anime of the same name. Without a manga source material to refer to, live-action Your Name will face similar issues. Casting the right actors to portray Taki and Mitsuha alone will be the live-action movie&#39;s biggest challenge.



 How The Live-Action Your Name Movie Could Still Work

Like Netflix&#39;s Cowboy Bebop and Death Note, the live-action Your Name will have to take the risk of not directly adapting its source material. While this approach could easily backfire, it will at least ensure that the live-action movie is not fighting the losing battle of competing with the original film. Your Name&#39;s live-action can still borrow the key concepts from the original film. However, since it is nearly impossible to recreate the original anime film&#39;s cinematic magic, the live-action film will have to try and etch its own identity by adopting unique story elements. Only time will tell how the Your Name live-action movie will ultimately overcome these challenges, but a departure from tethering too close to the original film might benefit it.
