## Literature Review

Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s newest movie did ruin his Rotten Tomatoes comeback streak, but it was also able to prove that his stardom is alive and well. 




Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s final project of 2023, Dunki, may not have had raving responses from critics, but it proves that audiences still love the actor and his work. After taking a five-year hiatus from acting following some critical and commercial flops, Khan returned to the big screen in 2023 in Pathaan. Pathaan was a box office hit and solidified Khan&#39;s place as a Bollywood superstar once again. That was not the end of his year, though, as Khan went on to star in 2023&#39;s Jawan. Despite having high expectations to go up against, Jawan managed to be another huge hit and broke worldwide box office records.




Not only was this success huge for Khan, but also for Bollywood as a whole. The industry&#39;s global reach has been unprecedented and has allowed audiences in all different parts of the world to experience what Bollywood has to offer. Given how impactful of a year it has been, all eyes were on Khan&#39;s last project of 2023, Dunki. There was initial speculation that the movie would break SRK&#39;s success streak for the year, and while it wasn&#39;t quite as big of a hit, Dunki proved that he is still the big name star he once was.

2023 was a great year for Shah Rukh Khan, as he starred in two huge films, Pathaan and Jawan, that received both critical and commercial success. It was anticipated that his final movie of 2023, Dunki wouldn&#39;t be able to reach the same global box office milestones as his previous movies of the year because of its significantly lower budget. Though Dunki did end up impressively grossing over $50 million, the movie didn&#39;t do well with critics.

The film has been classified as &#34;Rotten&#34; by Rotten Tomatoes, only having a score of 56%. Pathaan, on the other hand, has a critic rating of 84% and Jawan has one of 88%. Using critics&#39; reviews as an indicator, Dunki is not nearly as successful as the other movies in Shah Rukh Khan&#39;s comeback year.

Though critics may not have enjoyed SRK&#39;s final project in his comeback year, audiences definitely have. Dunki has a 76% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes and has been doing well at the box office. The film&#39;s messaging about family, love, and sacrifice set it apart from the more action-packed blockbusters that debuted earlier in 2023, and it&#39;s clear that audiences still love and respect the actor enough to check out movies regardless of their genre.
