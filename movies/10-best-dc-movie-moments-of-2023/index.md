# 10 Best DC Movie Moments Of 2023


## SUMMARY 



The best moments in DC movies of 2023 were personal character moments, not action-heavy scenes.

Shazam! Fury of the Gods had a hilarious scene with Darla taming a Unicorn with Skittles, adding unexpected humor to an otherwise bland climax.

The Flash delivered the most emotional moment of 2023 as Barry sacrifices speaking to his mother, showcasing his heroism and hitting deep emotional beats.
