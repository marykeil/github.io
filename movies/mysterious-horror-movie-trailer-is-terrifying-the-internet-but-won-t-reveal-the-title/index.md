## Literature Review

A terrifying new horror movie trailer arrives on the Internet without revealing the title, only sharing a scant few details about the project.




A trailer for a mysterious unknown 2024 horror movie from Neon has taken the Internet by storm. Neon is an independent film company that both produces and distributes movies in a variety of genres, including the 2019 Best Picture winner Parasite, the 2018 documentary Three Identical Strangers, and the 2023 French legal thriller Anatomy of a Fall, which was nominated for two 2024 Golden Globes. Horror movies that Neon has previously released include the 2018 French thriller Revenge and the 2020 Hulu release Bad Hair, as well as 2023&#39;s Infinity Pool and It Lives Inside.




On YouTube, Bloody Disgusting Horror has shared a teaser for an unknown 2024 horror title from Neon. Check it out below:


 

The trailer mostly plays out over an old family photograph, with audio revealing the contents of a 9-1-1 call where a man insists &#34;that&#39;s not my daughter.&#34; Then the picture cuts to a mysterious figure in legwarmers, who is lying on a bed with their torso out of frame. Mysteriously, there is an unaccountable third arm that either seems to be attached to or coming from beneath the person on the bed.


 What Horror Movie Could This Trailer be Promoting? 
          




There is already more than one 2024 horror movie set for distribution by Neon, muddying the water somewhat as to what this project could possibly be. These titles include the movie Handling the Undead, which does feature families being thrown into chaos when their late loved ones return. However, the movie is Norwegian and doesn&#39;t seem to fit the trailer.

                  Every Horror Movie Releasing In 2024   2024&#39;s horror movies include sequels like Beetlejuice 2 and MaXXXine and new movies by Jordan Peele and M. Night Shyamalan. Here&#39;s when they release.   

Neon has other undated horror titles that could fit the bill. This includes the upcoming It Follows sequel They Follow, which takes place in a universe where the relentless titular monster can take on the form of various people, including those in one&#39;s own family. Other options include the Nicolas Cage serial killer thriller Longlegs, directed by Oz Perkins, and the Catholic horror movie Immaculate, starring Sydney Sweeney, but neither boasts a premise that seems similar to the trailer.






Longlegs also stars Alicia Witt, Blair Underwood, and It Follows&#39; Maika Monroe.




The most likely horror movie that this trailer could be teasing is Neon&#39;s upcoming Cuckoo. The project was written and directed by Tilman Singer and features a cast including Euphoria&#39;s Hunter Schafer, The Guest&#39;s Dan Stevens, and Glass Onion&#39;s Jessica Henwick. Details on the plot, which follows a teenage girl moving to a mysterious resort with her family, are thin on the ground. However, the title fits the teaser, given the fact that cuckoo birds are a parasitic species that lays their eggs in nests belonging to other species, with their babies frequently attacking the host bird&#39;s true offspring.
