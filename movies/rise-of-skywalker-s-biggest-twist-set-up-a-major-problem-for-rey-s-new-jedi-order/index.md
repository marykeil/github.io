# Rise Of Skywalker s Biggest Twist Set Up A Major Problem For Rey s New Jedi Order


## SUMMARY 



  Rey&#39;s true identity as a Palpatine could cause unease and doubt about her leadership of the Jedi, given Palpatine&#39;s history as the greatest source of evil in the galaxy.   The Jedi are already facing chaos in the New Jedi Order era, and adding the prominent Sith bloodline to the mix will only complicate matters further.   Rey, like Leia and Luke before her, has inherited the same problem of dealing with the galaxy&#39;s prejudice and skepticism towards individuals based on their family origins. However, Leia overcame this challenge and prepared Rey for the struggles she would face.

## Literature Review

In Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order film, the Jedi will allegedly be in chaos, and it may have everything to do with one Rise of Skywalker plot twist.




​​​​​​The reveal of Rey&#39;s origin in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker could cause massive problems for the Jedi in the upcoming Star Wars: New Jedi Order movie. After Kylo Ren told Rey that her parents were nothing more than filthy junk traders, it seemed like the mystery of Rey&#39;s lineage was solved, but The Rise of Skywalker brought a shocking twist: Rey&#39;s father had actually been a Palpatine clone, making Rey, at least genetically, a Palpatine. Rey ultimately rejected that lineage, introducing herself as Rey Skywalker, but, as Lor San Tekka said, &#34;You cannot deny the truth that is your family.&#34;




Fast-forward 15 years, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kenny has revealed &#34;the Jedi are in chaos&#34; in the New Jedi Order era. This will pose unique challenges for Rey, who is attempting the build a new Jedi Order from the ground up — something that has proven difficult time and again both for Jedi Master Luke Skywalker and in the prequel trilogy. While picking up the pieces from yet another Star Wars regime is certainly partially to blame, the impact on the Jedi in particular suggests that something else may be afoot. It could easily be linked to Rey herself.

                  Star Wars: New Jedi Order - Cast, Story, Timeline &amp; Everything We Know   Rey&#39;s Star Wars return is happening in Star Wars: New Jedi Order. Here&#39;s what is known about the story, cast, and release of Daisy Ridley&#39;s film.   


 Rey&#39;s True Identity Means She Will Be Challenged As Leader Of The Jedi 
          




With the reveal that Emperor Palpatine is Rey&#39;s grandfather, there may be some significant unease about her new role as leader of the Jedi. Palpatine terrorized all three trilogies of the Skywalker Saga, and he is well-known throughout the galaxy as the greatest source of evil in recent history. While Rey has proven herself as a Jedi dedicated to the light side, having resisted Palpatine&#39;s manipulations and promises of power in The Rise of Skywalker, it would be unsurprising for there to be doubt about her true nature. Palpatine infiltrated the New Republic as a Sith Lord, and there would surely be concern that Rey was a threat.

This concern could be part of the &#39;chaos&#39; plaguing the Jedi in New Jedi Order. The history of the Jedi, even outside Palpatine, is one of failure, as Luke told Rey, and the heavy involvement of the prequel trilogy&#39;s Jedi Order in the Clone Wars would not yet be lost to memory. It&#39;s likely that many in the galaxy have already lost faith in the Jedi if they had still retained any to begin with; Rey herself had to ask Han Solo if the Jedi were real or if they were simply a myth. Given this multi-layered complexity, adding the most prominent Sith bloodline to the mix can&#39;t possibly help.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   



 Rey Was Leia&#39;s Padawan, &amp; She&#39;s Inherited The Same Problem 
         

Of course, Rey is nowhere near the first Star Wars character to struggle with this issue. Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia Organa, the two Jedi who provided her training, both inherited the same concern. Leia&#39;s lineage was revealed to the galaxy in Claudia Gray&#39;s novel Bloodline, bringing an end to her political career. Although she was still trusted by some - and thus able to lead the Resistance - she could no longer command a majority in the Senate. This suggests that the galaxy does have a chip on its shoulder about family origins, even if that person&#39;s actions suggest they couldn&#39;t be more different.




Leia overcame her background, though, as proven by her successful leadership of the Resistance. Leia&#39;s words to Rey before her passing seem to prepare her apprentice for this; &#34;Never be afraid of who you are,&#34; Leia told Rey. She knew the challenges Rey would face.



 Has Rey&#39;s True Identity Been Revealed To The Galaxy Ahead Of The New Jedi Order? 
          

Star Wars has yet to confirm whether Rey&#39;s true origins have been revealed to the larger galaxy, so it remains to be seen whether this will be a factor in the chaos among the Jedi. It is certainly possible there are other factors. And yet, the very fact Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie is set 15 years after Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker suggests Rey has had time to achieve something, only for everything to be challenged in some way. Her Palpatine connection could easily be the cause.




              Star Wars: New Jedi Order  The tenth mainline installment in the Star Wars franchise is the first movie to follow the sequel trilogy, where Mark Hamill&#39;s Luke, Carrie Fisher&#39;s Leia, and Harrison Ford&#39;s Han Solo gave their final farewell. After the release of The Rise of Skywalker, development on a direct sequel had become dormant as Disney shifted focus on other parts of the galaxy, namely, Disney&#43; shows such as The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka. However, a movie starring Daisy Ridley as Rey Skywalker was officially announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023.
