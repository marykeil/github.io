 7  Julius Caesar 
Directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz (1953)
        

In the screen adaptation of the classic historical Shakespeare play, Brando plays one of his most entertaining roles as the cunning Mark Antony.

Directed by Richard Donner (1978)
        

According to Superman star Christopher Reeve on Late Night with David Letterman in 1982, Brando didn&#39;t really put his all into portraying Jor-El in Superman: The Movie.
