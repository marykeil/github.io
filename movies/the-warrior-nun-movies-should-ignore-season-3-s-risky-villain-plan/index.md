# The Warrior Nun Movies Should Ignore Season 3 s Risky Villain Plan


## SUMMARY 



  The Warrior Nun movie should avoid turning Ava into a villain, as it would not allow for enough character development in a shorter film format.   Replicating the villain twist from Warrior Nun season 3 would be a risky move for the movie, as it has already been done in other popular shows.   Keeping Ava&#39;s character moving forward instead of backsliding into a villain role would be a better choice for the movie adaptation.

## Literature Review

As much as the Warrior Nun movie should stick to the show’s script, there is one aspect of the third season that should not make it to the big screen.




While the Warrior Nun movie would really benefit from trying to replicate much of what the Warrior Nun television series did, there is one idea from the show&#39;s unmade season 3 that the movie should definitely not use. Warrior Nun is a TV series made by Netflix and based on the comic book character Warrior Nun Areala, written by Ben Dunn. The series follows 19-year-old Ava Silva who wakes up in a morgue and discovers that, not only does she have a second chance at life, but she also is part of an ancient group that protects Earth from demons. The series ran for two seasons before being canceled.




Since the Warrior Nun movie was announced, there have been countless questions about how the film will compare to the television series. It is no secret that the show was popular, with a fanbase passionate enough to get a movie put into development. However, that is no guarantee that the Warrior Nun movie will replicate the series, and in fact, the film could go in an entirely new direction that could ruin the story fans love. However, there are definitely some aspects of Warrior Nun&#39;s television series, especially season 3, that the movie could do without.



On August 15, 2023, it was revealed that Warrior Nun would be revived as a trilogy of feature films that would continue the television series plotline.





 Warrior Nun Season 3 Would Have Made Ava A Villain 
          




One thing that would&#39;ve happened in Warrior Nun season 3 that the Warrior Nun movie should not use is turning Ava into a villain. Although Warrior Nun season 3 was never made, showrunner Simon Barry revealed that he intended to turn Ava into a bad guy in the third season. While Ava&#39;s character development saw her go from a relatively selfish person to someone who would do anything to save her friends, Warrior Nun season 3 would have seen Ava backslide back to how she was before. Though it would not have been a conscious decision on Ava&#39;s part, it still would have happened regardless.

If Warrior Nun had continued as a TV show, this plot choice potentially could have worked. It seems unlikely that Ava would have become purely and truly evil, and instead, she would just have a season of bad judgment. Ava probably would still have fought the OCS, and in the end, it is likely that she would have returned to being good. In fact, this conflict might have made her character stronger and more interesting. However, when it comes to the movie, they could probably skip out on this plot point.






 The Movies Should Ignore Warrior Nun Season 3&#39;s Risky Villain Twist 
         

Ultimately, the Warrior Nun movie should ignore Warrior Nun season 3&#39;s villain twist because it is a risky move for the big screen. While a season of television offers enough time for a full character development arc, movies don&#39;t have nearly enough time. Therefore, if Ava appeared like a villain in the Warrior Nun movie, there is no guarantee that there would be enough time for her to have solid character development. If anything, it would look like a cheap plot trick that doesn&#39;t quite go anywhere, and instead, is there for drama rather than for any deeper meaning.



It seems like a better choice to keep Ava moving onward and upward rather than moving back to where she was before.







Furthermore, Ava villain twist is risky in general. Those who love Warrior Nun already saw Ava go from selfish to selfless, and therefore, to see her backslide could be incredibly frustrating. In many ways, the movie would just be repeating itself. Even if Ava becomes a villain in a way that is different than how she did it before, it would still be questionable to bring the main character back to a place that she has already been. If anything, it seems like a better choice to keep Ava moving onward and upward rather than moving back to where she was before.



 Ava&#39;s &#34;Bad Guy&#34; Twist Has Already Been Done 
          

As much as Netflix&#39;s Warrior Nun is beloved, this potential TV twist isn&#39;t great because it has already been done. Turning the hero into the villain is a pretty classic trope, and in many ways, it has been overdone. Big TV shows where the hero has become the villain include Game of Thrones, Supernatural, Breaking Bad, and Hannibal, which makes Warrior Nun&#39;s attempt at a hero-turned-villain story feel somewhat bland. This is especially true since Ava only recently regained her hero status. Therefore, Simon Barry&#39;s idea for Warrior Nun season 3 should stay unmade as the Warrior Nun movies get underway.
