## Literature Review

One theory explains why Newt Scamander’s name appeared on the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter 3, fitting with Newt’s interests and timeline.




Although it was never addressed, Newt Scamander from Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them briefly appeared in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Taking place during the 1920s through to the 1930s, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movies serve as a prequel series to the Harry Potter films. As such, the Fantastic Beasts movies include references and some characters who crossover to Harry Potter. In contrast, the Harry Potter movies include very few references to Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which makes sense given that the Harry Potter films were created first. However, one notable Easter egg was when Newt Scamander appeared on the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.




Watch on Max

Introduced in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, the Marauder’s Map was a magical document that tracked the location of everyone both in Hogwarts and on the castle grounds. The map was created by the four Marauders, James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew, who kept it until it was confiscated by Hogwarts’ caretaker, Argus Filch. During their first year at Hogwarts, Fred and George Weasley stole the map from Filch’s office. Later, the twins gave it to Harry in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. As Fred and George taught Harry how to use the map, Newt’s name briefly appeared on the parchment. While this was a fun Easter egg, it also raises the question of why Newt Scamander was in Hogwarts during Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

 Harry Potter Marauder’s Map Theory: Newt Was At Hogwarts To Save Buckbeak 
          

Considering the length of time between the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Harry Potter films, it seems unlikely that Newt would have a reason to visit Hogwarts. In addition, Newt was expelled from Hogwarts when he was a student, making his return even less likely. However, one theory justifies Newt’s appearance on the Marauder’s Map. It is possible that Newt may have been in Hogwarts to try to save Buckbeak, the hippogriff, from execution. This makes sense given Newt’s background and the Harry Potter timeline.

In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hagrid became the Care of Magical Creatures teacher and brought in a hippogriff, Buckbeak, to show to his first class. Unfortunately, Draco Malfoy provoked Buckbeak and caused the creature to attack him, prompting his father to have Buckbeak sentenced to death. As a great animal lover, this news would have concerned Newt. This is especially true if Newt learned about the circumstances of the attack. Newt believed that magical creatures were not dangerous if treated with respect, and Buckbeak only attacked Malfoy when he disrespected him. Due to this, Newt would have gladly traveled to Hogwarts to defend Buckbeak and try to prevent his execution, causing him to appear on the Marauder’s Map.




In addition, the fact that Buckbeak was a hippogriff would have made him especially important to Newt. Growing up, Newt’s mother bred hippogriffs, which initially sparked his fascination with magical creatures. This also means that Newt would have spent a lot of time with, and caring for hippogriffs as a child. Due to these experiences, Newt may have been particularly fond of hippogriffs, making saving Buckbeak a priority and worth a journey to Hogwarts.



 How The Newt Marauder’s Map Fits The Harry Potter Timeline 
          

Initially, it may seem like Newt would be too old to be in Hogwarts during Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, given how much earlier the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movies took place. However, Newt was born in 1897, putting him at 96 years old when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban happened in 1993. While this may seem old, witches and wizards naturally live longer than muggles, with the life expectancy for wizards in Great Britain being 137 and 3/4 years old by the mid-1990s. Due to this, it would have been perfectly reasonable for Newt to make a trip to Hogwarts when he was 96.




Additionally, the release of a second edition of the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them textbook proved that Newt was alive in 1993. In 2017, a new version of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was published, which included a foreword written by Newt. This not only addressed the events of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, but showed that Newt was still alive as late as 2017. In this way, Newt Scamander’s appearance on the Marauder’s Map in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban fits with the Harry Potter timeline and his love of magical creatures like Buckbeak.
