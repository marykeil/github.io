# How To Watch The Sniper Movie Series In Order


## SUMMARY 


 

The Sniper series has lasted for 30 years with 10 movies and counting, ranging from psychological thrillers to goofy action comedies.


Tom Berenger initially fronted the series but was replaced by Chad Michael Collins as Beckett&#39;s estranged son.


The franchise has a loyal fanbase and future sequels are practically guaranteed, although there is currently no word on a potential 11th film.
