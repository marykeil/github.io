## Literature Review

Magazine Dreams, a drama film starring Jonathan Majors, reportedly won&#39;t be released by Disney&#39;s Searchlight following the actor&#39;s conviction.




Magazine Dreams, a drama film starring Jonathan Majors, reportedly will no longer be released by Disney&#39;s Searchlight following the actor&#39;s conviction. The movie follows budding bodybuilder Killian Maddox (portrayed by Majors), who struggles to achieve his dream of going professional despite the damage it does to his body. The film was originally slated for theatrical release on December 8, 2023, but was pulled during the 2023 Hollywood strikes.




Now, The Hollywood Reporter reports that, despite Magazine Dreams&#39; premiere at Sundance in early 2023, the Majors-led film will no longer get a wider release from Disney&#39;s Searchlight. This comes after Majors was convicted of third-degree reckless assault and harassment in late December 2023. The filmmakers are seemingly going to search for another distributor for the movie, whose release now remains unclear.


 Will Magazine Dreams Still Get Released? 
          

Searchlight originally purchased the film for a seven-figure sum in February 2023, indicating belief the movie would be a major hit. This stems from the star’s rising success at the time, portraying various versions of Kang in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and starring opposite Michael B. Jordan in Creed III. However, the actor was fired from his role in the MCU when he was convicted, a replacement for Kang now on the series’ horizon.




Due to Majors’ harassment and assault conviction, it seems Magazine Dreams will have a hard time finding a home with a different distributor. Despite the film’s cast and crew setting out to make an engaging production, the lead actor’s actions could make studios uncomfortable with putting the movie in theaters. This may prove even more difficult after the actor is sentenced in February.

However, it’s possible the movie will find its way to a smaller distributor, perhaps releasing via streaming or through VOD. While this wouldn’t be ideal for the filmmakers, finding a distributor that will give Magazine Dreams a theatrical release may prove difficult now that Searchlight has dropped it. While the actual fate of the film remains unclear, a smaller distribution might be the best outcome for the movie.



Magazine Dreams holds an 84% from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, indicating the film could have gotten a positive reception from audiences at a certain point.
