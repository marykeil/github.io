 10  30 Days Of Night 
2007
        

One of Hartnett&#39;s most iconic films is the 2007 cult horror classic 30 Days of Night, directed by David Slade (Black Mirror: Bandersnatch). Josh Hartnett stars in the lead role as Eben Oleson in this vampire action horror set in a remote Alaskan town that is sent into 30 straight days of darkness. The unique setting is one of the reasons why 30 Days of Night is one of the most memorable vampire horrors of the 21st century. Hartnett gives an excellent performance alongside costars Melissa George and Ben Foster.


 9  Wrath Of Man 
2021
        

For a film that Hartnett wasn&#39;t even supposed to be in initially, Wrath of Man ends up being one of the best movies that Hartnett has taken part in. The sleek and visually immersive action-crime thriller stars franchise powerhouse Jason Statham, Holy McCallany, and Scott Eastwood alongside Hartnett&#39;s role as Boy Sweat Dave. The Guy Ritchie movie offers one of the best new movies in the heist genre in recent memory and even features a cameo from rapper Post Malone.


 8  Mozart &amp; The Whale 
2005
        

The 2005 drama Mozart &amp; The Whale is one of Hartnett&#39;s most underrated performances that truly demonstrated his range as an actor. Hartnett and costar Radha Mitchell play two people with Asperger&#39;s syndrome who fall in love and form a powerful yet tumultuous relationship. Hartnett excels in one of his most complicated and challenging roles, which is wrapped around an inspirational and heartwarming unconventional love story.

 7  The Faculty 
1998
        

This 1998 horror classic is likely one of the main movies that people think about when they see the name Josh Hartnett, as it was one of his early works that helped solidify his larger-than-life Hollywood status back then. The Faculty is a purely fun and entertaining movie experience that is even better to watch today than it was when it came out 25 years ago because of the added retrospective layer of 90s nostalgia. The film has a simple and wild premise, centering on a group of students who believe their teachers have become alien invaders.


 6  Lucky Number Slevin 
2006
        

Lucky Number Slevin is a mid-2000s classic action movie with a remarkable cast that includes Hartnett, Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, Lucy Liu, and Ben Kingsley. The highly stylized film from director Paul McGuigan still holds up to this day as a fast-paced thriller with interesting elements of a modern film noir. Hartnett stars as the titular protagonist Slevin who gets caught up in a web of conspiracy involving very powerful gangsters in this surprisingly great movie.


 5  Oh Lucy! 
2017
        

Oh Lucy! is arguably one of the lesser-known films that Hartnett has starred in but actually utilizes his character in a unique and engaging way. Set in Tokyo, Oh Lucy! tells the story of a disillusioned woman who finds a new life when she takes on an alter-ego through her English learning class and falls in love with her instructor. Hartnett plays the teacher named John who suddenly disappears, forcing the newly-formed Lucy to discover what happened to him in this magnificent comedy-drama.

Sin City is often referred to as one of the best cinematic graphic novel adaptations of all time.


 3  The Virgin Suicides 
1999
        

The Virgin Suicides is another one of Hartnett&#39;s earliest works that he is most famous for. The dreamlike yet tragic film was the first directorial effort by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation, Priscilla). The coming-of-age teen drama has become a cult classic of the young adult genre and features a breakout role from Kirsten Dunst as one of five Lisbon sisters who become the point of obsession between a group of boys in a 1970s suburban town. The film does contain several scenes pertaining to suicide.


 2  Black Hawk Down 
2001
        

Black Hawk Down depicts the incredible true story of a tragic 1993 United States military operation in Somalia gone terribly wrong. Hartnett stars as one of the main soldiers who gets caught in a vicious gunfight that destroys two American Black Hawk helicopters. The intense Ridley Scott film is full of gripping action sequences and brilliant cinematography and sound effects and also stars an ensemble cast led by Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Sam Shepard, William Fichtner, and Jason Issacs.
