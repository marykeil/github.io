According to Diesel Labs&#39; data, the most-hyped new movie of January 2024 is Mean Girls, Hollywood&#39;s latest movie-based-on-a-musical-based-on-a-movie. Mean Girls (2024) is not a proper remake of the 2004 movie, but rather an adaptation of the 2017 stage musical that was, in turn, based on the original Mean Girls. The next most-anticipated film is The Book of Clarence, a biblical comedy-drama starring LaKeith Stanfield as the titular character living in 29 A.D. Jerusalem. Blumhouse&#39;s Night Swim is January 2024&#39;s third-most-hyped movie, in which an evil spirit terrorizes a woman night-swimming in her pool. Blumhouse produced several of 2023&#39;s best horror movies, making Night Swim&#39;s buzz very promising.

January 2024&#39;s new movies with significant online attention before their releases also include Jason Statham&#39;s action thriller The Beekeeper, Jake Johnson and Anna Kendrick&#39;s Hulu comedy Self Reliance, and Lifetime&#39;s two-hour true crime special Casey Anthony&#39;s Parents: The Lie Detector Test. Netflix is releasing several highly-anticipated new films for streaming in the coming weeks, such as the heist comedy Lift, Dan Levy&#39;s rom-com Good Grief, the 1972 Andes flight disaster adaptation Society of the Snow, and the comedy special Jack Whitehall: Settle Down. From laughs to scares to adrenaline-boosting action fun, the most-hyped new movies of January 2024 offer plenty of exciting watches to begin the year.
