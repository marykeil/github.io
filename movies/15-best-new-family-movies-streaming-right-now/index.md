## Literature Review

There has been an abundance of great family films over the last few years. Here are the best that are available to stream right now.




Some of the best family movies in recent memory are streaming right now on the most popular entertainment platforms. It&#39;s important to find these films for all ages because sometimes even the best movies of all time aren&#39;t suitable for the whole family to enjoy. It can often be difficult to find something that fits the bill, especially one that hasn&#39;t been played on repeat throughout the years.
It helps that the number of great animated family movies has jumped up in recent years since they were the easiest to produce during the pandemic. As a result, most of the best movies to stream right now were made using advanced animation as live-action family movies are becoming more sparse across the entertainment industry. Regardless of which kind of family-friendly entertainment you&#39;re looking for, a handful of movies stand out above the rest.

 14  Good Burger 2 (2023) 
Rated PG


 







  Good Burger 2  


  Release Date    November 22, 2023     Director    Phil Traill     Cast    Kenan Thompson , Kel Mitchell , Jillian Bell , Lil Rel Howery , Kamaia Fairburn , Alex R. Hibbert , Fabrizio Guido , Carmen Electra     Rating    TV-PG     Runtime    106 Minutes    


It’s rare for movies - especially those aimed at kids - to get a sequel more than 20 years after they were released. Good Burger 2, however, is just that. Starring Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, and featuring a host of cameos, the movie is a sequel to the original Good Burger, which was born out of the Nickelodeon sketch comedy show All That. Parents will likely enjoy watching this one with their kids and introducing their kids to other ‘90s Nickelodeon series on Paramount&#43;.

/ 10 




  Director    David Lowery     Cast    Alexander Molony , Ever Anderson , Yara Shahidi , Jim Gaffigan , Alan Tudyk , Molly Parker , Jude Law , Joshua Pickering , Jacobi Jupe     Runtime    106 minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Fantasy    


Along with being another Disney live-action remake of an animated classic, there have been countless adaptations of Peter Pan throughout the years, which may account for why Peter Pan &amp; Wendy was somewhat overlooked. However, the movie received more favorite reviews than some of the other live-action Disney remakes as director David Lowrey presented a unique enough take on the material to not feel repetitive, with the mythology of Peter and Captain Hook getting an especially interesting new take. It results in a high-flying family adventure with a great mix of nostalgia and originality.

Turning Red was one of several Pixar movies that was placed directly on Disney&#43; during the pandemic. Despite the disappointing release plan, the movie proved there is still magic being made at Pixar as it was nominated for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars. Similar to Inside Out, Turning Red is an insightful and clever look at the struggles of being a kid as it follows a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl who is possessed by a family curse that turns her into a giant red panda whenever she expresses strong emotions. The movie has worthwhile messages for the older and younger viewers while still providing laughs and fun.

Strange World is sadly one of the biggest box office bombs of all time, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily speak to its quality. Indeed, despite the movie&#39;s failure upon release and a mixed response from critics, it is not hard to imagine the movie finding an audience in the streaming world. Strange World serves as a throwback adventure to sci-fi serials as it follows a family of explorers on a mission into an unknown land filled with bizarre creatures and intriguing mysteries. Offering some dazzling animated sequences and creature designs, it is a movie that ignites a sense of adventure.

 10  Matilda The Musical (2022) 
Rated PG


 







  Roald Dahl&#39;s Matilda the Musical  


  Release Date    December 9, 2022     Director    Matthew Warchus     Cast    Alisha Weir , Lashana Lynch , Andrea Riseborough , Stephen Graham , Emma Thompson     Rating    PG     Runtime    117 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Family , Musical , Drama    


A remake of a beloved movie can rarely land with audiences the same way as the original. Matilda the Musical, however, manages to do it. The movie is both a remake of the &#39;90s movie and the modern stage musical, both of which were based on the children&#39;s novel by Roald Dahl. The story follows the titular little girl who doesn&#39;t have the best home life and faces bullies at school but finds solace in her books and a great teacher. Matilda presents a potentially grim reality, but finds the bright spots in life, and does it with some fantastic song-and-dance sequences.

 3  Guillermo del Toro&#39;s Pinocchio (2022) 
Rated PG


 







  Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio

In a year that saw two Pinocchio remakes, Guillermo del Toro&#39;s unique animated interpretation was certainly the better of the two. The film tells the timeless fairy tale of Pinocchio but with a dark, fantastical reimagining that could only come from the mind of del Toro. Pinocchio&#39;s journey is taken to new existential and emotional levels while still maintaining its magical appeal from the original Disney film that the whole family can enjoy. The movie is another twisted tale from del Toro which earned Best Animated Feature at the Oscars.
