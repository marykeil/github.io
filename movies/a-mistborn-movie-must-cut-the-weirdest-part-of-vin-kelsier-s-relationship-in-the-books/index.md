# A Mistborn Movie Must Cut The Weirdest Part Of Vin &amp; Kelsier s Relationship In The Books


## SUMMARY 



  A Mistborn movie must avoid suggesting romance between Vin and Kelsier to stay true to the source material.   Vin and Kelsier&#39;s relationship should be portrayed as a found-family dynamic rather than a romantic one.   The focus of the movie should be on the revolution and building a better world rather than unnecessary romantic drama.

## Literature Review

A Mistborn movie must include the relationship between Vin and Kelsier, but it shouldn’t overcomplicate it or make things weirder than they are.




A Mistborn movie will bring the world of Brandon Sanderson&#39;s fantasy novels to life, including compelling characters like Kelsier and Vin — but the movie must cut one of the weirdest elements of their relationship in order to succeed. During the first Mistborn novel, Vin joins Kelsier&#39;s crew and becomes part of their plans to overthrow the Final Empire. Kelsier turns into something of a mentor for Vin, teaching her how to use her Mistborn abilities and granting her a more generous view of friendship and love.




While a Mistborn adaptation must capture the emotional depth of Kelsier and Vin&#39;s relationship to succeed, it should avoid playing into some of the odder moments from Sanderson&#39;s books. Vin&#39;s relationship with Elend is the primary romantic subplot of the Mistborn trilogy, and that shouldn&#39;t change. In fact, the movie should focus only on Vin and Elend rather than alluding to some love triangle between them and Kelsier.


 A Mistborn Movie Should Avoid Any Suggestions Of Romance Between Vin &amp; Kelsier 
          

Although Vin and Kelsier&#39;s relationship holds little romantic tension in Sanderson&#39;s source material, the Mistborn trilogy occasionally alludes to Vin having feelings for her older mentor. Elend is sometimes jealous of the other man, even after his death, and the members of Vin&#39;s crew seem to think there might have been more between her and Kelsier. While Vin doesn&#39;t really seem to feel this way, she does question it when others bring it up. And it&#39;s somewhat strange they do this at all, as Kelsier is much older than Vin, making the possibility of romance incredibly inappropriate.




                  10 Moments From The Mistborn Books We Must See In The Movie Adaptation   There are plenty of exciting moments to look forward to in the Mistborn movie adaptation, but some scenes will hit particularly hard on-screen.   

Kelsier works much better as a father figure for Vin, and that goes beyond their incompatible ages. With Vin&#39;s upbringing, she has no dependable family — and Kel becomes the person to finally give her that. He already has a lost love that he&#39;s hung up on, and Elend catches Vin&#39;s attention while she&#39;s acting as a spy. Mistborn&#39;s main characters are clearly interested in other people, leaving their relationship with one another platonic and familial. That&#39;s how it should be, and a Mistborn movie should cut lines that suggest anything more between the two.



 Why Mistborn Doesn&#39;t Need To Complicate Vin &amp; Kelsier&#39;s Relationship To Succeed 
          




A Mistborn movie doesn&#39;t need to complicate the relationship between Vin and Kelsier, as there&#39;s enough going on in the story without adding an unnecessary love triangle. The Mistborn trilogy is about revolution and building a better world, and romance is a secondary aspect of the story. While that doesn&#39;t mean it should be cut completely, it does allow a film adaptation to focus on Elend and Vin by themselves rather than adding drama that doesn&#39;t hold any significance. Given that Vin having feelings for Kelsier — or vice versa — would be incredibly weird, it&#39;s best if Mistborn foregoes this element of the books and focuses on what&#39;s more important.
