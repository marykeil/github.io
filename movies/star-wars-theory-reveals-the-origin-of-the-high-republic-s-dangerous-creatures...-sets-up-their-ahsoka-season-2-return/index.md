# Star Wars Theory Reveals The Origin Of The High Republic s Dangerous Creatures... &amp; Sets Up Their Ahsoka Season 2 Return


## SUMMARY 



  The Nameless, dangerous creatures in Star Wars: The High Republic, may be connected to the dark side of the Force.   The Nameless are believed to come from a planet called Planet X, which bears similarities to the planet Mortis from Star Wars: The Clone Wars.   If the Nameless are tied to the Mortis gods, they could potentially appear in a second season of the TV show Ahsoka.

## Literature Review

The Nameless are the most dangerous creatures ever encountered by the Jedi. But will they ever be seen beyond Star Wars&#39; High Republic era?




One Star Wars: The High Republic theory reveals the origins of one of Star Wars’ most dangerous creatures and how they might become part of the franchise beyond The High Republic’s storytelling. The Jedi, as ever, face many threats during the High Republic era. In Phase I, the galaxy is besieged by a group of marauders known as the Nihil, led by the vindictive and cunning Marchion Ro. And, in The High Republic Phase II, which takes place 150 years before the events of Phase I, the Jedi face the wrath and hatred of a group known as the Path of the Open Hand, led by the mysterious and dangerous Mother, who are convinced the Jedi abuse the Force and should be punished for it.




Though there are multiple links between these two Phases, including the Ro family and the ships used by both the Path and the Nihil, one creature has plagued the Jedi throughout the High Republic timeline: the Nameless. Both Marchion Ro and the Mother have used these creatures to kill Jedi in the most horrific possible way – by defiling their connection to the Force, sucking away their energy, and leaving them as desiccated, shriveled husks. Though it’s clear these creatures are incredibly treacherous, little is known about their origins and where they come from. However, one Star Wars theory might explain more and provide a clue as to where they may appear next.


 The Nameless Have A Secret Dark Side Connection 
          

Given their abilities, as well as their terrifying appearances, the Nameless having a connection to the dark side of the Force might not be all that surprising. However, in The High Republic’s novels, they have, thus far, only encountered and attacked Jedi – it’s hard to know how they might react to a Sith, for instance, and what fate would await dark side Force users if they were to encounter these creatures. One scene in Lydia Kang’s novel Cataclysm, however, which is the second adult novel in The High Republic Phase II, suggests that the Nameless are actually connected to the dark side, rather than a means to attack any and all Force users regardless of affiliation.




                  Star Wars&#39; High Republic Explained &amp; Release Guide (Books, Comics &amp; Show)   The Star Wars franchise is expanding into the High Republic Era - and here&#39;s everything you need to know about the books, comics, and shows.   

In the scene, Jedi Master Creighton Sun and Jedi Aida Forte are investigating the Path of the Open Hand’s compound on the planet Dalna. They infiltrate the Path’s cave system, and it is in these caves that they witness the death of a Force-sensitive Path member, who dies because of the Nameless’ terrifying powers. Though Creighton and Aida are thankfully both far enough away not to be killed by the Nameless’ influence, they are nevertheless affected by it. Both become aware of a terrible disturbance in the Force caused by the creature, and they experience excruciating fear, drowning in it, until Master Creighton accesses an emotion seldom wielded by the Jedi – rage.

It isn’t until he allows his anger to overwhelm him that the effect of the Nameless’ powers begins to dissipate. This would suggest that the Nameless don’t simply feed on someone’s connection to the Force but specifically someone’s connection to the light side of the Force. Anger and rage are key to a dark side Force user&#39;s power – perhaps it is key to the Nameless’ power as well, and by accessing those emotions, Creighton Sun connected with the Nameless on a deeper, more terrifying level.






 The Nameless Could Have A Secret Link To The Son 
         

Though little is known about the origins of the Nameless, it has been revealed that they come from a planet known only as Planet X. In The High Republic, several characters mount expeditions toward this planet, including the Nihil’s leader Marchion Ro, which is described by StarWars.com as a world that is “a nexus for both the light and dark sides of the Force.” Planet X is located in Wild Space, on the edge of the Galactic Frontier, and every part of the planet feels alive, even the atmosphere. This sounds remarkably similar to a planet first introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.

In The Clone Wars season 3, Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Ahsoka Tano are stranded on an unfamiliar planet, Mortis, with no way to communicate with the rest of the galaxy. There, they encounter three incredibly powerful beings connected to the Force, known as the Mortis gods – the Daughter, the living embodiment of the light, the Son, the living embodiment of the dark, and the Father, who keeps the balance between the other two. The Father’s power is waning, however, and he wants Anakin Skywalker to take his place as the Chosen One. Though Anakin refuses, their ordeal on the planet proves that it is a strangely powerful place – in fact, Mortis is “the fulcrum of the entire galaxy and the Force,” as described by StarWars.com.

That description sounds remarkably similar to the way Planet X is described. Given centuries have passed between the events of The High Republic and the events of the Clone Wars, it’s understandable that the Jedi’s knowledge of that time and the Nameless’ origins might simply have been forgotten, or lost. So, what if Planet X is actually Mortis? Given the Nameless&#39; strange, bleached, white appearance is so similar to the Son’s haunting visage, it’s possible that the Son created the Nameless to attack light side Force users. The Mortis god’s strength would explain why the Nameless are so powerful and why they affect the Jedi to such a terrifying extent.



 If The Nameless Are Tied To The Son, They Could Appear In Ahsoka Season 2 
          




If the Nameless are connected to the Son – which could be revealed in The High Republic Phase III – they might show up in Ahsoka next. At the end of Ahsoka season 1, Ahsoka Tano and her Padawan, the Mandalorian Sabine Wren, are stranded on the planet Peridea in Star Wars’ secondary galaxy. Strangely enough, however, Peridea is shown to have ties to the Mortis gods. Baylan Skoll, an Order 66 survivor who now works as a mercenary, was called to Peridea by a mysterious power. As he wanders the planet in the final minutes of the Ahsoka season 1 finale, he finds three massive statues – one of the Father, one of the Son, and one of the Daughter, although the latter is mysteriously missing its head.

                  Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know   Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project.   

If the Nameless are connected to the Son, and the Son had a presence on Peridea, there’s a chance Ahsoka and Sabine might encounter the Nameless whilst they’re trapped on the planet. The Nameless might be guarding something meant only for dark side Force users, and as Ahsoka and Sabine are seemingly intent on continuing Sabine’s training and unraveling the mysteries of the Force present on the planet, they may run into more trouble than they could have ever anticipated. As Star Wars: The High Republic expands its storytelling beyond novels and comics into animation and live-action TV, it makes sense for a show as pivotal as Ahsoka to be inspired by its world-building as well, should a second season be produced.
