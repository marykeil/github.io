<p>15 Best Horror Movies Of All Time, Ranked
What are the best horror movies of all time? Every fan has their opinion, but these movies have stood the test of time to become certifiable icons.</p>
<p>25  Insidious (2010)
The James Wan Movie That Kicked Off A Terrifying Franchise</p>
<p>PG-13</p>
<p>Release Date    April 1, 2011     Director    James Wan     Cast    Barbara Hershey , Lin Shaye , Rose Byrne , Ty Simpkins , Patrick Wilson     Runtime    103 minutes</p>
<p>James Wan has become a master of horror filmmaking over the years, getting his start on the hit franchise film, Saw. However, it was when he created a new franchise with Insidious that he showed his propensity for spinning out original ideas into multiple installments. 2010&rsquo;s Insidious took the idea of a haunting and turned it on its head. Insidious revealed that it was the child in the house that was haunted, not the house itself. The movie also thrived thanks to the paranormal investigator played by Leigh Whannell. In the end, Insidious was a monster success that spawned multiple sequels, each with a varying level of success compared to this original.

<p>24  Annabelle (2014)
A Spin-Off In The Conjuring Universe</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>Release Date    October 2, 2014     Director    John R. Leonetti     Cast    Annabelle Wallis , Alfre Woodard , Michelle Romano , Eric Ladin , Tony Amendola , Ward Horton     Runtime    99minutes</p>
<p>Annabelle, part of The Conjuring franchise, remains one of the best horror movies on Netflix, especially among those that deal with the supernatural. While Insidious was a great franchise starter for James Wan, it was The Conjuring that provided him with a plethora of story ideas in the form of sequels and spin-offs.
The original Conjuring movie focused on Ed and Lorraine Warren, real-life paranormal investigators who went to exorcise a home. The Conjuring featured many haunted objects in the Warren&rsquo;s collection, including the haunted doll Annabelle. The spinoff Annabelle takes place in the past and shows how the Warrens got their hands on the doll. Annabelle was almost as successful as The Conjuring and spawned two sequels of its own, though the original remains the best.

<p>23  The First Purge (2018)
The Purge Franchise Gets An Origin Story</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>Release Date    July 4, 2018     Director    Gerard McMurray     Cast    Melonie Diaz , Chyna Layne , Lex Scott Davis , Mo McRae , Y’Lan Noel , Luna Lauren Velez     Runtime    98minutes</p>
<p>The Purge introduced audiences to its incredibly unique premise when it released in 2013. The world has one night of the year when all crime, including murder, is legal. This set-up alone was enough to spawn a franchise, including 2018&rsquo;s The First Purge, the movie explaining how Purge Night began. The First Purge finally answers key questions such as why the Purge started, and what caused it to eventually grow out of control. At $137.1 million (on a $13 million budget), it was the biggest box office hit of the franchise (via Box Office Mojo).

<p>22  Malignant (2021)
James Wan&rsquo;s 2021 Sleeper Horror Hit</p>
<p>R</p>
<p>Release Date    September 10, 2021     Director    James Wan     Cast    Maddie Hasson , Annabelle Wallis , Jacqueline McKenzie , Ingrid Bisu , Michole Briana White , Jake Abel , Mckenna Grace , George Young     Runtime    111 minutes</p>
<p>In 2021, James Wan took a break from his franchises to direct a self-contained horror movie, and it was one with a unique twist that ended up as a sleeper hit for the year. The movie features a woman who lives in an abusive relationship and has a nightmare about someone killing her husband. When her husband ends up dead, and a mysterious figure attacks her, the woman believes she might be the murderer. The movie has more twists and turns than many of Wan&rsquo;s horror movies, but it was highly praised and remains one of the most bizarre and unique horror movies on Netflix.

<p>21  Dawn Of The Dead (2004)
Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Remake Of The Romero Classic</p>
<p>Release Date: March 19, 2004 | Director: Zack Snyder | Runtime: 100 minutes
Cast: Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Webber, Mekhi Phifer
Before Zack Snyder became known as the leader of the DCEU for almost a decade, he tried his hands at some very difficult movies to adapt. These included the masterpiece graphic novel Watchmen and the remake of the George Romero horror classic Dawn of the Dead. Snyder took the controversial decision to make the zombies fast, but he kept the tension high and created a very scary zombie movie that remains a loyal remake of the Romero masterpiece. While there are plenty of zombie movies on Netflix, 2004&rsquo;s Dawn of the Dead stands out as it established many of the now-tropes of the modern undead movie formula.

<p>20  The Wailing (2016)
A South Korean Mystery About A Deadly Disease</p>
<p>The Wailing</p>
<p>Release Date    June 3, 2016     Director    Na Hong-jin     Cast    Jun Kunimura , Hwang Jung-min , Kwak Do-won     Runtime    2h 36m</p>
<p>South Korea has some of the best horror movie output in the world, with many K-Horror&rsquo;s on Netflix, but few exemplify what makes Korean horror so popular as well as 2016&rsquo;s The Wailing. The Netflix horror movie is set in a small village where the arrival of a stranger leads to a deadly infection spread through the population. With a mix of real-world horror and supernatural aspects, The Wailing is a gripping experience elevated by its rich characters and brilliant filmmaking. The Wailing has a near-perfect 99% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics praising its atmospheric dread and effective mystery.

<p>20 Best Halloween Movies On Netflix
Netflix has filled its movie library with plenty of horror hits, spooky classics, and family-friendly supernatural films to watch this Halloween.</p>
<p>19  Crimson Peak (2015)
Guillermo del Toro&rsquo;s Gothic Ghost Story</p>
<p>Crimson Peak</p>
<p>Release Date    October 13, 2015     Director    Guillermo del Toro     Cast    Charlie Hunnam , Jessica Chastain , Tom Hiddleston , Mia Wasikowska , Doug Jones , Burn Gorman     Runtime    119 minutes</p>
<p>Guillermo del Toro can always be counted on to infuse a sense of beauty into his horror movies and such is the case with the dark gothic tale of Crimson Peak. The movie is set in Edwardian-era England and stars Mia Wasikowska as a young writer who travels to the estate owned by her husband (Tom Hiddleston) and his wife (Jessica Chastain) where she encounters dark spirits in the old home. The stunning visuals and creepy atmosphere are brilliantly realized by del Toro while the stellar cast does great work with their complex character, with Chastain as the standout performer.

<p>18  Oxygen (2021)
A Claustrophobic French Horror That Will Leave Viewers Breathless</p>
<p>Release Date: May 12, 2021 | Director: Alexandre Aja | Runtime: 101 minutes
Cast: Mélanie Laurent, Mathieu Amalric, Malik Zidi
Oxygen is a rare horror movie that doesn&rsquo;t have any monsters or deranged killers and instead generates fear with a simple yet universally relatable threat. The French sci-fi movie is set entirely inside a cryogenic chamber with Mélanie Laurent playing a woman who is trapped inside with her oxygen levels decreasing. Laurent&rsquo;s performance is key to keeping the audience engaged, as she makes for a strong yet human hero in a life-or-death situation. It is an edge-of-the-seat experience with every moment and decision feeling exciting and vital.

<p>17  The Strangers (2008)
Some Of The Creepiest Masked Killers Ever Put To Screen</p>
<p>The Strangers</p>
<p>Release Date    May 30, 2008     Director    Bryan Bertino     Cast    Scott Speedman , Laura Margolis , Gemma Ward , Kip Weeks , Liv Tyler , Glenn Howerton     Runtime    86 minutes</p>
<p>The Strangers follows a couple who are trapped and terrorized by three masked assailants in their remote vacation home. The premise is tried and true, as the same concept was used for Jordan Peele&rsquo;s Us and the cult classic Michael Haneke horror movie Funny Games. However, when it comes to home invasion movies, The Strangers is by far one of the most terrifying due to the realistic portrayal of fear and relentless tension. The film is a masterclass in suspense and minimalistic horror, but the movie&rsquo;s greatest aspect is how it taps into the primal fear of being targeted by strangers for no apparent reason.

<p>35 Terrifying Horror Movies That Aren’t Paranormal
Instead of featuring some kind of demon, zombie, or otherworldly creature, these movies show that real people are sometimes the scariest monsters.</p>
<p>16  Ouija (2014)
A Popular Game Gets A Terrifying Supernatural Horror Treatment</p>
<p>Ouija<br>
PG-13</p>
<p>Release Date    October 24, 2014     Director    Stiles White     Cast    Lin Shaye , Sierra Heuermann , Shelley Hennig , Olivia Cooke , Ana Coto     Runtime    89 minutes</p>
<p>Ouija capitalizes on the eerie and foreboding nature of the well-known board game. The 2014 horror movie on Netflix follows a group of friends who awaken dark forces by playing with a Ouija board, leading to a series of haunting and fatal events. While the movie employs familiar horror movie elements, it&rsquo;s the atmospheric tension and the sense of inevitable dread that distinguishes it.
Oujia explores themes of loss and the unknown, making the supernatural feel uncomfortably close to reality. The young cast&rsquo;s genuine reactions contribute to a feeling of vulnerability too. The movie resonates with anyone who has ever been both terrified and intrigued by the idea of communicating with the other side.

<p>15  It Follows (2015)
An Inventive Thriller With Disturbing Allegories</p>
<p>It Follows<br>
R</p>
<p>Release Date    March 27, 2015     Director    David Robert Mitchell     Cast    Olivia Luccardi , Jake Weary , Keir Gilchrist , Daniel Zovatto , Maika Monroe , Lili Sepe     Runtime    100minutes</p>
<p>It Follows is a hauntingly original horror film that centers on a supernatural entity that relentlessly pursues its victims, passed on through a curse via sexual contact. What sets It Follows apart is its deep-rooted allegories to real-world fears such as sexually transmitted diseases and the loss of innocence. The entity is a slow unyielding force that metaphorically and literally follows the protagonist, creating an omnipresent sense of dread. The movie&rsquo;s true ingenuity lies in its ability to transform everyday settings into landscapes of terror, making the mundane menacing. It Follows is both a throwback to classic horror and a forward-thinking piece that reshapes the contours of the genre.

<p>14  Bird Box (2018)
A Monster Movie Where One Look Can Mean Death</p>
<p>Bird Box</p>
<p>Release Date    December 13, 2018     Director    Susanne Bier     Cast    Machine Gun Kelly , Pruitt Taylor Vince , BD Wong , Danielle Macdonald , Lil Rel Howery , Tom Hollander , Julian Edwards , Sarah Paulson , Rosa Salazar , Parminder Nagra , Sandra Bullock , Trevante Rhodes , Vivien Lyra Blair , John Malkovich , Jacki Weaver     Runtime    124 minutes</p>
<p>Bird Box became a phenomenal success when it was first released, as it was a viral sensation thanks to the meme of Sandra Bullock blindfolded. That led to Bird Box becoming the most-streamed Netflix original movie for years until it was dethroned by Red Notice. However, it wasn&rsquo;t just the memes that made Bird Box so exciting. The movie follows a small town that becomes ridden with unseen entities that drive people to suicide when they&rsquo;re looked at, making for one of the most suspenseful Netflix originals. A sequel, Bird Box Barcelona, was released in 2023 and sees the same entities terrorize civilians only on a much bigger scale.

<p>10 Horror Movies Where Humans Are The Monsters
Many horror movies have a supernatural being at the helm of the terror. However, many have villains that are just as human as the victims.</p>
<p>13  I See You (2019)
A Cerebral Horror Where Nothing Is As It Seems</p>
<p>Release Date: December 6, 2019 | Director: Adam Randell | Runtime: 96 minutes
Cast: Helen Hunt, Jon Tenney, Owen Teague, Judah Lewis
I See You is a mind-bending horror thriller that follows the disappearance of a young boy. However, it isn&rsquo;t just any run-of-the-mill disappearance, as sinister forces may or may not be involved. While predominantly a horror movie, it&rsquo;s the thriller elements and the film&rsquo;s ability to keep audiences guessing until the very end that makes I See You great. The eerie atmosphere and unexpected plot twists create one of the most exciting under-the-skin experiences that has mostly gone overlooked. I See You showcases how paranoia and uncertainty can be used to create spine-tingling horror.

<p>12  The Platform (2019)
A Horror Commentary On Class Inequality</p>
<p>Release Date: November 8, 2019 | Director: Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia | Runtime: 94 minutes
Cast: Iván Massagué, Antonia San Juan, Zorion Eguileor, Emillio Buale
The Platform is a surreal horror movie about a vertical high-rise prison. In the center of the prison on the top level is a platform full of food that descends to each floor. As the food runs out quickly, desperation takes over the prisoners, who resort to murder and cannibalism. The Spanish horror movie is an expertly told social commentary that explores the darkest aspects of human nature, such as greed and survival. That&rsquo;s all wrapped in a claustrophobic and disturbing setting, and The Platform features one of the most harrowing plot twists of any horror movie on Netflix.

<p>11  Lights Out (2016)
Terror Lurks In The Darkness In This Tense Netflix Horror Movie</p>
<p>Lights Out</p>
<p>Release Date    July 22, 2016     Director    David F. Sandberg     Cast    Billy Burke , Lotta Losten , Teresa Palmer , Gabriel Bateman , Maria Russell , Alicia Vela-Bailey , Maria Bello , Alexander DiPersia     Runtime    81minutes</p>
<p>Not for Netflix subscribers who are afraid of the dark, Lights Out follows a family&rsquo;s encounter with a malevolent entity that only exists in darkness. The movie follows Rebecca and her brother Martin, who are haunted by a ghostly figure that resembles their mother&rsquo;s unstable childhood friend, Diana. The movie becomes terrifying when the lights go out, and it&rsquo;s one of the simplest but most effective horror films available to watch on Netflix. Lights Out doesn&rsquo;t rely on jump scares or gore to scare viewers, but instead, the movie masterfully exploits a universal fear to create an atmosphere of total dread and suspense.

<p>10  Dracula Untold (2014)
A Horror-Action Origin Story Of The Famed Vampire</p>
<p>Dracula Untold</p>
<p>Release Date    October 1, 2014     Director    Gary Shore     Cast    Luke Evans , Sarah Gadon , Dominic Cooper , Art Parkinson , Charles Dance , Diarmaid Murtagh     Runtime    92</p>
<p>Dracula Untold reimagines Dracula&rsquo;s origin unlike any other story that&rsquo;s come before. The movie follows Vlad the Impaler&rsquo;s transformation into the immortal bloodsucker in order to save his family and kingdom. The movie is essentially the beginning of the shortlived Universal Dark Universe, but it&rsquo;s a fun and scary standalone movie that injects high-octane action into the age-old story. Combining elements of action and horror, the film is an exciting adventure flick, but it also turns Dracula into a more three-dimensional character, as Vlad the Impaler is depicted as a tragic hero as opposed to a monster.

<p>9  Vivarium (2019)
Darkly Comedic And Unsettling Look At A Surreal Suburban Experience
Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots in Vivarium</p>
<p>Release Date: March 27, 2020 | Director: Lorcan Finnegan | Runtime: 97 minutes
Cast: Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, Jonathan Aris, Danielle Ryan
Vivarium is one of the most surreal horror movies of the 2010s. The Lorcan Finnegan movie follows a couple looking to buy a house together, only the houses in the suburban neighborhood they move to are identical. The couple finds themselves trapped there and strange occurrences keep happening, such as a baby appearing at their front door. They end up stuck in a neverending loop of suburban life not knowing if they&rsquo;ll ever get out, which is more terrifying than any jump scare. Vivarium is a masterclass in psychological horror with its Lynchian elements, and it absolutely achieves its goal of provoking discomfort and existential dread.

<p>8  The Pope&rsquo;s Exorcist (2023)
Russell Crowe Battles The Devil</p>
<p>The Pope&rsquo;s Exorcist</p>
<p>Release Date    April 14, 2023     Director    Julius Avery     Cast    Russell Crowe , Daniel Zovatto , Alexandra Essoe , Franco Nero     Runtime    1h 43m</p>
<p>The Pope’s Exorcist provides straightforward yet effective scares. Russell Crowe plays real-life holy man Father Gabriele Amorth as he investigates the case of a possessed child. Based on Amorth&rsquo;s books, The Pope’s Exorcist sees Crowe playing an atypical character for him, but with the same rebellious streak that is perfect for Crowe&rsquo;s presence. While critically divisive, The Pope&rsquo;s Exorcist is best when Crowe is on screen, with a good scare and it all zips along entertainingly in a way that suits the platform. The 2023 film is especially worth watching given that The Pope&rsquo;s Exorcist 2 is coming.

<p>7  Apostle (2018)
A Brutal Journey Within A Violent Cult</p>
<p>Apostle</p>
<p>Release Date    September 21, 2018     Director    Gareth Evans     Cast    Dan Stevens , Kristine Froseth , Lucy Boynton , Michael Sheen , Bill Milner , Mark Lewis Jones     Runtime    2hr 10 min</p>
<p>Apostle is a gothic horror movie starring Legion&rsquo;s Dan Stevens as Thomas Richardson. Directed by Gareth Evans, the movie has a lot in common with the classic horror movie The Wicker Man, and it struggled somewhat to get over with some critics due to those comparisons. Typically gory for an Evans project, Apostle sees Stevens&rsquo; hero Thomas travel to a Welsh island to rescue his sister, who was kidnapped by a cult and held for ransom. However, what he finds there is a pagan ritual and a hungry god that needs sustenance

<p>6  The Babysitter (2017)
Samara Weaving Shines In This Horror-Comedy</p>
<p>The Babysitter</p>
<p>Release Date    October 13, 2017     Director    McG     Cast    Robbie Amell , Hana Mae Lee , Bella Thorne , Judah Lewis , Samara Weaving , Andrew Bachelor     Runtime    85minutes</p>
<p>Scaring is one thing, but horrors that also manage to pack in laughs are a rare breed. The Babysitter is an under-seen horror comedy that could provide a lot of fun, relatively short, and easy to watch. The movie centers around a young boy who discovers that his babysitter is part of a satanic cult, putting him in the middle of their deadly plans. With broad characters, bloody kills, and a terrific villainous role from Samara Weaving, The Babysitter is hugely entertaining. It was so popular on the streaming platform that it spawned a sequel starring modern final girl Jenna Ortega.
