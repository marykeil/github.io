## Literature Review

Donald Glover and Stranger Things star Caleb McLaughlin transform into rapper 21 Savage in trailer for the upcoming biopic film American Dream.




A new trailer for American Dream shows a look at the upcoming rap biopic. Starring Donald Glover and Stranger Things star Caleb McLaughlin, American Dream will follow the biographical story of rapper 21 Savage. American Dream also stars Natasha Lyonne, Jabari Banks, Victoria Pedretti, Chad Lindberg, and Gail Bean.




Now, 21 Savage has released the trailer for American Dream: The 21 Savage Story. The trailer intersperses a 21 Savage music video with footage from the film. In the trailer, Glover and McLaughlin are seen at various points in 21 Savage&#39;s life, playing the rapper during both his early years, rise to fame, and his infamous ICE arrest and later release.


 

The end of the trailer shows Glover, as 21 Savage, in an American Dream scene that reveals the origin story of the rapper’s name. Along with the trailer, the rapper announced the upcoming release of new music based on the film, which will become available on January 12.


 What To Expect From American Dream: The 21 Savage Story 
          




Not only is 21 Savage one of the most influential rappers of this generation, but the musician has a fascinating life story that can contribute well to the big screen. Though he was raised in Atlanta, 21 Savage was born in the U.K. and raised as an undocumented immigrant. In 2019, as former US President Donald Trump cracked down harshly on immigration policy, 21 Savage was arrested by ICE and detained for several weeks. This led to a “Free 21 Savage” campaign, and the rapper was eventually released.

American Dream: The 21 Savage Story will take on this story and more as it dramatizes the rapper’s life. The trailer is directed by Glover alongside brother Stephen Glover, Jamal Olori, and Fam Udeorji. The film was produced by Udeorji and Tara Razavi.

                  Will Donald Glover Return For The Community Movie?   Donald Glover’s Troy Barnes left Community during season 5, but with a potential Community movie in the works, will Donald Glover come back?   




According to the trailer, the multi-generational story will see 21 Savage “in the heat of a personal crisis” as the biopic follows him from his youth up until his deportation. Both McLaughlin and Glover appear to be completely transformed in the American Dream trailer, fitting well into their portrayals of the rapper. American Dream does not yet have a release date for the full film, but the prospect of Glover’s next big collaboration is nonetheless exciting.
