# 1 Five Nights At Freddy s Character Fate Is The Key To Making A Great Spinoff


## SUMMARY 



  The success of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s guarantees more movies with Freddy Fazbear, but a sequel is dependent on a character&#39;s fate.   A spinoff set in a mall with a new character named Vanessa as the security guard would elevate the franchise.   Vanessa&#39;s awakening from a coma is crucial for the spinoff to happen and she will likely be involved in future chapters of the franchise.

## Literature Review

A truly entertaining spinoff concept for Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is entirely dependent on what happens with one character from the first movie.




The many box office records broken by Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s have all but guaranteed that more movies starring Freddy Fazbear and his diabolical pals are on the way, but one of the best potential avenues for a spinoff is dependent on the fate of a character from the original film. A sequel has not yet been greenlit, but the amount of lore that is available to explore from the video game source material means that there is potential for more stories set in that universe. It&#39;s possible that some of the original cast will return, and one character in particular definitely should for the good of the franchise.




While the final scenes of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s saw the ghost child-driven animatronics claim their original tormentor and return to the depths of the eponymous restaurant, the franchise could and should move beyond the scope of the original setting. The return of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s villain has already been teased by the actor who played William Afton, Matthew Lillard, but it&#39;s actually another character whose unknown fate matters more to the franchise&#39;s most promising spinoff. The spinoff would follow one of the more popular recent chapters in the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s video game series.

 Vanessa Should Star In A Security Breach Spinoff After Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 
The 2021 video game takes place in a mall based around Freddy Fazbear and his cohorts.
          

Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s: Security Breach is unique among other games in the franchise in that it takes place over one night instead of five. It follows a young boy, Gregory, locked in &#34;Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Mega Pizzaplex&#34; as he tries to survive the animatronics who have been reprogrammed to seek and kill him. Vanessa is the security guard for the mall, and the only human besides Gregory in the building. Throughout the night, Gregory is also pursued by a person in a white rabbit costume named &#34;Vanny&#34;, who ultimately turns out to be Vanessa under the influence of William Afton&#39;s ghost.




A Security Breach spinoff would elevate the franchise in a number of ways. Besides bringing back the murderous William Afton (in some form), it would also yield a mystery and twist ending that has often been a calling card of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s franchise. Elizabeth Lail could portray an entirely different version of her character, Vanessa, as the diabolical &#34;Vanny&#34;. A Security Breach story would make for a refreshing and entertaining new direction for the franchise, as opposed to recycling a story set in the original restaurant with Vanessa guarding it.



 Vanessa&#39;s Fate In Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Is Critical To Whether The Spinoff Happens 
Vanessa will need to awaken from the coma she slipped into at the end of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s.
         

At the conclusion of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, Vanessa revealed herself to be the daughter of William Afton, the murderer who created the ghost children who inhabit the animatronic characters of Freddy Fazbear&#39;s. In the final battle against her father, she was stabbed. While she survived the encounter, she did fall into a coma, which she was still in when the movie ended. Given her prevalence in the Security Breach story line, Vanessa will need to awake from the coma early in the next Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, whether it becomes a Security Breach spinoff or sequel.




Chances are, of course, very good that she&#39;ll awaken from the coma in the next Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, regardless of what direction it moves in. Vanessa is a key character in the larger lore behind the movie, and she will likely be a connecting thread between the original movie and the sequel/spinoff even if Josh Hutcherson&#39;s character does not return. A Security Breach spinoff could be one of the more fun directions for the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s franchise to move in, but even if it doesn&#39;t Elizabeth Lail&#39;s Vanessa is a good bet to be involved in whatever the next chapter is.
