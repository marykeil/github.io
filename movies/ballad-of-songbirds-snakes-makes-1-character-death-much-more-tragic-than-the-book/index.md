## Literature Review



Suzanne Collins&#39; new The Hunger Games book, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes already offered a tragic fate for Coriolanus Snow&#39;s friend, Sejanus, however, the movie adaptation makes his ending much worse. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes is a prequel book to the original The Hunger Games trilogy. The book, and now the 2023 movie, tell the story of Coriolanus Snow before he became president of Panem, and when he played a role in the tenth Hunger Games. Snow, along with the other Academy students, begin mentoring the Hunger Games tribute in hopes of earning the Plinth prize, and therefore, power and glory.




Though the movie is quite similar to Suzanne Collins&#39; book, there are a few differences between The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes book and movie which change the story as a whole. One particular change that is quite small but impactful on an emotional level is the fate of Sejanus. Sejanus is an Academy student who is friends with Coriolanus and has a rebellious streak. He speaks out against the Hunger Games, and even enters the tenth Games to protect the body of one of the tributes. This move ultimately leads to Sejanus&#39; gruesome fate, though the book and the movie approach this differently.

 Sejanus Volunteering To Be A Peacekeeper Makes His Death More Tragic 
          

According to The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie, Sejanus volunteers to be a Peacekeeper, and this makes his death even more tragic. During the tenth Hunger Games, Snow cheated to allow his tribute, Lucy Gray Baird, to win. He introduced her scent to the vicious snakes that were going to be put into the arena so that they would not attack her, leaving her to be the winner of the Hunger Games. Although Lucy did win, Snow is punished for his actions by being forced to become a Peacekeeper for the next 20 years. In the movie, Sejanus volunteers to join him, and the two go to District 12.




Ultimately, the fact that Sejanus volunteers to become a Peacekeeper is sad because this decision leads to his death. After Snow recorded Sejanus&#39; rebellious ideals while they were working as Peacekeepers together, and sent them to the Capitol, Sejanus was executed, unaware that his friend betrayed him. In the book, Sejanus never volunteered to be a Peacekeeper, but was forced into it like Snow because he entered the arena during the Hunger Games. In fact, Sejanus would have faced a worse punishment if his father had not offered to pay the Academy for a new gym.



 Songbirds &amp; Snakes&#39; Sejanus Change Is Better Than The Book 
          

Although The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes movie made Sejanus&#39; death more tragic, it also makes for a better story. In general, Sejanus&#39; character is representative of the fight against the Capitol, while Snow is a much more morally dark, selfish figure. In this way, Sejanus volunteering to give up his privilege to make a difference in the Districts makes sense for his character. If it remained how it was in the books, Sejanus would not appear nearly as selfless or passionate as he does in the movie. Ultimately, the movie worsened Sejanus&#39; death, but for the betterment of the overarching story.
