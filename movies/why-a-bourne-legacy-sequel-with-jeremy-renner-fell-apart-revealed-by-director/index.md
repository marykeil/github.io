# Why A Bourne Legacy Sequel With Jeremy Renner Fell Apart Revealed By Director


## SUMMARY 



  Tony Gilroy&#39;s The Bourne Legacy introduced a new franchise protagonist with Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner.   Director Justin Lin reveals that he was in development on a sequel to the film with Renner, but Matt Damon&#39;s decision to reunite with Paul Greengrass for 2016&#39;s Jason Bourne essentially killed the project.   Although The Bourne Legacy&#39;s reviews were mixed, the film introduces new elements and characters that would have been interesting to explore in a sequel.

## Literature Review

Director Justin Lin reveals just how far his Bourne Legacy sequel got into development, and why the Jeremy Renner sequel ultimately fell apart.




The Bourne Legacy sequel never got made, and attached director Justin Lin now reveals why the Jeremy Renner project didn&#39;t work out. Matt Damon first breathed life into author Robert Ludlum&#39;s titular character in 2002&#39;s The Bourne Legacy, with two direct sequels following in 2004 and 2007. Before Damon returned once more in 2016&#39;s Jason Bourne, The Bourne Legacy in 2012 attempted to take the franchise in a new direction, introducing Renner&#39;s new protagonist, Aaron Cross.




During a recent interview on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Lin, who is best known for directing multiple installments in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, details his work on the stalled Bourne Legacy sequel. According to the director, some promising progress had been made on the follow-up, but the film ultimately came apart after the decision was made to focus efforts back on Damon&#39;s character. Check out Lin&#39;s full comment about the movie below:


“Yep, ‘Bourne’ was one of them. It was after I left for ‘Fast 6’ and [Universal’s] Donna Langley reached out and said, ‘What do you think about ‘Bourne’ and I was like, ‘Oh man!’ and like, Renner’s amazing. And to this day, I still kinda miss what we were working on.
“I think Matt [Damon] was done [with the franchise] at that point. Again, I had a great time working on the script, and getting to know Jeremy Renner was such a perk; he’s such a great guy, a great actor, but also a great human being.
“I think in the middle of doing that], Matt [Damon] and [Paul] Greengrass decided to come back, which is totally cool; that’s their franchise, and I totally understand. But I think the time that I had on it, I think back fondly on it, and there’s actually some stuff in there that I hope to be able to bring to life in other projects cause it was such a great time working with Andrew Baldwin on the script and Jeremy, just hanging out and talking about his character was great.”





  


 Did The Bourne Legacy Deserve A Sequel? 
          

Generally speaking, the first three installments in the Bourne franchise are considered the best, with director Tony Gilroy&#39;s Bourne Legacy and Damon&#39;s 2016 return not quite living up to these standards. Gilroy, who had served as co-writer on the three previous films, took on directing duties for Renner&#39;s franchise debut, and the film marked a departure from Greengrass&#39;s more kinetic style featured in The Bourne Supremacy and The Bourne Ultimatum.

 Title  Rotten Tomatoes Score   The Bourne Identity  84%   The Bourne Supremacy  82%   The Bourne Ultimatum  92%   The Bourne Legacy  56%   Jason Bourne  54%   






The 2012 reboot earned somewhat mixed reviews from critics, but performed decently well at the box office, raking in over $276 million on a budget of $125 million. While this falls short of its two predecessors (though it does beat The Bourne Identity&#39;s $214 million haul), it suggests that there may have been audience interest in seeing Cross&#39;s story continue in a sequel.



A new Bourne movie is reportedly in the works, with All Quiet on the Western Front director Edward Berger attached. It&#39;s currently unclear if Damon will be reprising his role or if the film will once again take the franchise in a new direction.




In hindsight, with Jason Bourne&#39;s reviews highlighting a loss of franchise magic despite Damon and Greengass&#39; returns, it may have been more interesting to continue Cross&#39; story instead. Renner&#39;s performance in The Bourne Legacy was strong, and new characters played by Rachel Weisz and Edward Norton also feel ripe for further exploration. As does the introduction of &#34;chems,&#34; which are essentially super soldier pills. Unfortunately, however, it doesn&#39;t look like this sequel will be happening anytime soon.
