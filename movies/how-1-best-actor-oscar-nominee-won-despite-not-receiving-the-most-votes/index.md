# How 1 Best Actor Oscar Nominee Won Despite Not Receiving The Most Votes


## SUMMARY 



  Before 1950, ties were allowed at the Oscars if the results were close, leading to Wallace Beery winning Best Actor despite receiving fewer votes.   The Academy Awards have had a total of 6 ties in their history, including in categories such as Best Documentary and Best Actress.   While less likely now due to current rules, ties can still occur at the Oscars, especially in strong categories with strong contenders.

## Literature Review

One Oscar nominee for Best Actor took the award home along with a fellow nominee, despite having one vote less, thanks to an old Academy rule.




Although it’s an uncommon situation, there’s one actor who won the Oscar for Best Actor at the same time as another actor, despite receiving fewer votes than his fellow winner. There are many awards in the film industry, with some even focused on shedding light on what’s considered by them the “worst” of each year, but by far the most famous and prestigious awards are the Academy Awards. The 1st Academy Awards were held in 1929, making the Oscars the oldest entertainment awards ceremony. The Academy Awards ceremonies grew to the point of becoming an event, and they cover different acting and technical categories.




The Academy Awards have been the reason and scenario for various historical moments in film history – from wins to snubs to controversial winners and both scripted and unscripted moments during the ceremonies. Every year it’s expected that one actor in each category, one movie, and one director will take the Oscar home, but throughout the history of the Academy Awards, there have been a couple of ties. One of the most notable ones is a Best Actor tie that was possible thanks to a now-changed rule, which made an actor with fewer votes a winner. 

                  An 85-Year-Old Oscars Record Still Won&#39;t Be Beaten In 2024   None of 2024&#39;s potential Oscar nominees can break one 85-year-old Best Picture record, and no future movie is likely to beat it either.   


 Wallace Beery Tied For Best Actor Despite Having Fewer Votes 
Before 1950, Ties Were Allowed At The Oscars If It Was   
          




The first tie in Oscars history happened in 1932 in the category of Best Actor. During the 5th Academy Awards ceremony, Fredric March was given the Oscar for Best Actor thanks to his role as Dr. Henry Jekyll/Mr. Edward Hyde in the 1932 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. After Edmund Goulding’s Grand Hotel was given the Oscar for Best Picture and the ceremony was about to end, it was revealed that another Best Actor nominee, Wallace Beery, had been only one vote behind March in the final results, and per the Academy’s rules back then, that meant he deserved to take the Oscar, too. Wallace Beery, then, won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Andy Purcell in The Champ.

Before 1950, the Academy had a rule that said that, if an achievement in a category came within three votes of the winner, that achievement would also receive an Oscar. This is why, despite being one vote behind Fredric March, Wallace Beery was given the Oscar for Best Actor, too. The Academy’s rules have changed a lot and this specific one was erased, and now only an exact match in total votes qualifies as a tie.






 There Have Been 6 Ties In The History Of The Academy Awards 
The Most Recent Oscars Tie Was In 2013.
          

Fredric March and Wallace Beery’s double win was the Oscars’ first tie but not the last one. In 1949, there was a tie in the category of Best Documentary (Short Subject), with A Chance to Live and So Much So Little taking the award. Perhaps the most notable tie in Oscars history happened in 1969, when two of the biggest stars at the time won the Academy Award for Best Actress: Katharine Hepburn for A Lion in Winter, and Barbra Streisand for Funny Girl. Another tie, this time in the category of Best Documentary Feature, happened in 1987, with Artie Shaw: Time Is All You’ve Got and Down and Out in America taking the Oscar, and in 1995, a tie in the category of Best Short Film (Live Action) made Franz Kafka’s It’s a Wonderful Life and Trevor the winners.




The most recent Oscars tie happened in 2013 in the category of Best Sound Editing, with the teams behind Zero Dark Thirty and Skyfall taking the Oscar. A tie happening at the Oscars is now less likely to happen, especially in the biggest categories, thanks to the current rules, but they are still possible, especially with strong contenders.
