## Literature Review

A new Superman: Legacy fan poster shows David Corenswet suited up as the DC Universe&#39;s new Man of Steel while paying tribute to Christopher Reeve.




David Corenswet gets imagined in a modernized Superman suit in a new Superman: Legacy fan poster for James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe. As Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom brought an end to the DCEU timeline in 2023, is marking the beginning of the new DC Universe. While Creature Commandos will kick off the franchise on the small screen, Superman: Legacy will be the DC Universe movie to properly launch Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34;




As DC Studios have been busy fleshing out the Superman: Legacy cast, the world is patiently waiting to see what Corenswet&#39;s costume will be like in the DC Universe. With Superman: Legacy being only a few months away from starting filming, spdrmnkyxxiii shared new artwork of what Corenswet could look like as the iconic DC hero.


 

The Superman: Legacy artwork features Corenswet as the latest Superman actor in live-action, donning a more updated version of Max Fleischer&#39;s Superman. The fan art also pays tribute to a previous Superman franchise through the infamous &#34;You Will Believe A Man Can Fly&#34; tag from Christopher Reeve&#39;s Superman: The Movie.

                  Who Is David Corenswet? James Gunn&#39;s Superman Actor Explained   David Corenswet has officially been cast as Clark Kent in the DCU’s Superman: Legacy, leading many to wonder about his career up to this point.   





 What We Know About Superman: Legacy So Far 
         

Superman: Legacy will feature a 30-year-old version of Clark Kent, who is still in his early days as the Man of Steel. While not doing the traditional origin story, Superman: Legacy is seemingly taking a similar approach to The Batman, with the movie most likely taking place during Clark&#39;s second or third year as a superhero. This version of the DC Universe will also establish that superheroes are already active in this continuity.

While they will be supporting roles, a number of DC superheroes have already been confirmed for Superman: Legacy to help flesh out Gunn&#39;s vision for the franchise. Nathan Fillion is set to play Guy Gardner, a.k.a. Green Lantern, after having previously worked on Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad as part of the DCEU. Superman: Legacy will also include Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, Edi Gathegi as Michael Holt/Mister Terrific, and Anthony Carrigan as Rex Mason/Metamorpho.






Gunn has stated that the world will not get to see Corenswet&#39;s costume prior to Superman: Legacy starting filming.




Members of The Authority will also have a presence in Superman: Legacy as María Gabriela De Faría has been tapped to play Angela Spica/The Engineer, although it&#39;s unclear which other characters Gunn is possibly adding. Given all of the casting news that came out at the end of 2023, it remains to be seen if Superman: Legacy has, at this point, added all of its stars. With Superman: Legacy getting ready for principal photography in a few months, time will tell what Gunn and DC Studios have in store with the highly anticipated movie.
