## Literature Review

Not only did Dan Levy write and direct Netflix’s Good Grief, but the actor is also starring in the rom-com alongside a few notable names.




Good Grief marks Dan Levy&#39;s directorial debut for a movie, but the actor is also starring in the Netflix title alongside a group of other notable stars. While best known for portraying David Rose in the award-winning sitcom Schitt&#39;s Creek, Levy is often connected to comedies, but his latest movie takes a darker approach. Like Schitt&#39;s Creek, Levy is serving as a jack-of-all-trades with Good Grief, serving as the release&#39;s creator, director, producer, and star. Despite not relying on the laughs, Levy&#39;s new movie will undoubtedly take viewers on an emotional journey.




Technically, Good Grief had a limited theatrical release at the end of 2023, but it officially hits Netflix on January 5th, 2024. Of course, having Dan Levy in the lead is obviously a big draw, but he also assembled a remarkable cast of characters around him. The movie, which will help set the tone for Netflix&#39;s January 2024 release slate, follows a widower struggling with grief before deciding to travel to Paris with close friends on a new journey of self-discovery. Good Grief also presents an essential tale about friendship and the unspoken challenges that come with adulthood.


 Dan Levy As Marc 
          

Dan Levy stars as Good Grief&#39;s central character, Marc, whose world is turned upside down after his husband dies unexpectedly. Many of Levy&#39;s projects are very personal for him, like the case with Schitt&#39;s Creek, which he co-created with his father, Eugene. The same can be said for Good Grief, as Levy revealed (via Tudum) that the idea behind Good Grief stemmed from the passing of the actor&#39;s own grandmother. Aside from Schitt&#39;s Creek, Levy recently appeared in Sex Education, The Idol, Haunted Mansion, and Happiest Season. He also served as an MTV Canada co-host from 2006-2011.






All six seasons of Schitt&#39;s Creek are currently streaming on Hulu.






 Luke Evans As Oliver 
          

Luke Evans has a pivotal role in Good Grief as Oliver, Marc&#39;s husband that passes away suddenly. Despite his death, Good Grief&#39;s trailer teases flashbacks before the tragedy occurs. Oliver&#39;s death clearly hits Marc like a ton of bricks, but it&#39;s evident that the spouses were experiencing marital issues while together. Acting since the early 2000s, Evans has grown an extensive filmography with notable roles as Bard in The Hobbit trilogy, Owen Shaw in the Fast &amp; Furious movies, and Gaston in Disney&#39;s live-action version of The Beauty and the Beast. More recently, the Welsh actor appeared in Echo 3, Nine Perfect Strangers, and Disney&#39;s Pinocchio.






 Ruth Negga As Sophie 
          

Accompanying Marc on his Paris journey is Ruth Negga&#39;s Sophie, one of the best friends who steps up during the figure&#39;s time of grief. Though she has a habit of sharing what&#39;s on her mind, Sophie is also someone in their mid-30s pondering what&#39;s next in life. Negga would be recognizable for her portrayal of Tulip O&#39;Hare in Preacher and her stint as Raina in Marvel&#39;s Agents of SHIELD. However, the actress also appeared in notable movies such as Passing, Ad Astra, and Loving, with the latter scoring her an Oscar nomination.



 Himesh Patel As Thomas 
          




Rounding out Good Grief&#39;s friendship trio is Himesh Patel&#39;s Thomas, the other best friend who travels with Marc and Sophie on a weekend trip to Paris. According to Himesh Patel&#39;s interview with Screen Rant, he spent a lot of time with Levy and Negga to shape the group&#39;s onscreen friendship. In addition to his starring role as Tamwar Masood in EastEnders, Patel would be known for his work in Damned, Station Eleven, Tenet, The Aeronauts, and Yesterday. Patel also has a history starring in Netflix movies, including Don&#39;t Look Up and Enola Holmes 2, where he briefly appeared as Dr. John Watson.
