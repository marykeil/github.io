## Literature Review

New crossover artwork imagines what the characters from the Harry Potter movie franchise would look like as doctors in ABC&#39;s Grey&#39;s Anatomy.




Harry Potter has met with Grey&#39;s Anatomy in unusual new crossover art. Harry Potter is a wide-ranging fantasy franchise that began with a series of seven children&#39;s books published from 1997 through 2007 and now includes movies, games, an interactive website, and an in-development television show. Grey&#39;s Anatomy, on the other hand, is a soapy ABC medical drama that debuted in 2005 and is still running, with season 20 due to premiere in March.




The Instagram account AI Dreams recently posted a gallery of AI-generated images imagining characters from the Harry Potter movies as doctors on Grey&#39;s Anatomy. Check it out below:


 

The collection, which boasts a logo reading Harry&#39;s Anatomy, puts lab coats on various characters, including the main trio, Harry, Hermione, and Ron, as well as their classmates Draco and Luna and Hogwarts professors McGonagall, Dumbledore, Snape, and Hagrid. Strangely, the lovable house elf Dobby is also included in the lineup.


 How Medicine Works In Harry Potter 
          

While it would be unlikely to find the Harry Potter characters in the halls of Grey&#39;s Anatomy&#39;s Seattle Grace Hospital, the Wizarding World does indeed have its own version of medical care. However, it would look very different from the science that the Muggle doctors on the ABC show use to heal patients. While none of the characters depicted in this new artwork ever pursued a career in medicine, there are versions of doctors seen throughout the Harry Potter franchise.






Doctors in the Wizarding World are known as &#34;healers.&#34;




Wizarding medicine is seen most closely in the Hogwarts Hospital Wing, which is run by Madam Pomfrey (played in the movies by Gemma Jones). Throughout the books and the movies, Harry and his friends find themselves in the Hospital Wing after various misadventures. One of the most notable incidents is a scene of Harry having his bones tortuously regrown after a Quidditch accident in Chamber of Secrets, though the trio usually end up being tended to by Madam Pomfrey sooner or later throughout each installment.

The Harry Potter books also offer a closer glimpse into the wizarding establishment St. Mungo&#39;s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. While most patients are easily treated with a countercurse or potion, the hospital also has a wing for patients affected by long-term maladies, including former Hogwarts professor Gilderoy Lockhart, who lost his memory due to a spell gone wrong. St. Mungo&#39;s is likely the single location in the franchise that most resembles Seattle Grace, and while it operates very differently, this crossover art is perhaps not quite as unusual for the Wizarding World as it originally seems.
