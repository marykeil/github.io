## Literature Review

Following the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Amber Heard is officially opening up about her return as the DCEU heroine Mera in the film.




With the DCEU officially done, Amber Heard has broken her silence on reprising the role of Mera in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. While it may not have been planned to be the final movie in the DCEU timeline, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom officially finished the decade-old franchise. Despite it being Jason Momoa&#39;s final time playing Aquaman, he will seemingly have a role to play in James Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe.




However, for most of the Aquaman cast, this is the end for them, unless they get brought back for Gunn&#39;s DC Universe in other roles. While Mera&#39;s role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was small, Heard still had a significant amount of scenes in the film nonetheless. Nearly two weeks after Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was released in theaters, Heard took to Instagram to address her final appearance as Mera in the DCEU.


 

Heard expressed her gratitude to her fans for &#34;the overwhelming support and love in Mera&#39;s AQ return,&#34; while sharing photos of her on the set of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. At the end of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Mera was still alive and well, following the final battle against Black Manta.

                  Everything We Know About Aquaman 3   The release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has led many to question whether a third film will be released to cap off the DC heroâ€™s trilogy.   





 Aquaman 2 Amber Heard Controversy Explained 
         

In the midst of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom being made, Heard was in the headlines regularly due to her then-ongoing legal battle with Johnny Depp. There were many people petitioning for Heard to be fired from the DCEU franchise before and while the trial was taking place. However, Warner Bros. and various members of the DC Films division stated that they were not going to take action.

In the end, Mera&#39;s reduced role in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was seemingly the result of the struggling chemistry between Heard and Momoa, according to former DC Films president Walter Hamada. Instead, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is more focused on Arthur Curry and his half-brother Orm. Mera is absent for most of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom after she gets critically injured.






As of right now, there are no known plans for Aquaman in Gunn&#39;s DC Universe.




Time will tell how Gunn will reimagine the Aquaman characters and who might be cast as Arthur, Mera, and other key players if they&#39;re incorporated into the new franchise. Needless to say, it may be quite a while before DC Studios returns to the Atlantis side of the DC realm. But for now, audience members can catch Heard as Mera in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, playing in theaters now.
