Summary
 2024 is LEGO&#39;s 25th anniversary with Star Wars, and they are releasing special 25th-anniversary models with exclusive minifigures. 
 The Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack is a great deal for collectors, offering 9 minifigures for $30.

2024 is building up to be a great year for Star Wars LEGO sets. With Star Wars models first releasing in 1999, 2024 marks LEGO&#39;s 25th anniversary with the franchise, having been one of the toy company&#39;s most consistently popular product lines for decades. To that end, new Star Wars LEGO sets have already hit store shelves in 2024, with many more on the way.
LEGO&#39;s Star Wars plans for 2024 have recently been teased with the upcoming release of special 25th-anniversary models which will reportedly come with exclusive minifigures honoring the entire Star Wars history and timeline, not unlike what was done for the 20th anniversary. It&#39;s also been rumored that LEGO will revisit The Phantom Menace in the coming months alongside more midi-scale models of classic ships. Here&#39;s every confirmed LEGO Star Wars set that has been officially released in 2024 (so far).
This list will be updated throughout the year as LEGO releases more sets.

 2  Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack 
(75372)
        

  Name   Piece Count   Price   Minifigures   Ages    Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372)   215   $29.99   9   7&#43;    
Having been released on January 1st, 2024, LEGO&#39;s Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack is a great way to kick off the new year in 2024. Catering to collectors who are all about army building, this new battle pack is a great deal with 9 minifigures being offered for a $30 set. It&#39;s essentially a Republic pack and a Separatist pack that&#39;s been mashed together. As with most battle packs, the true appeal is the minifigures (particularly the standard Phase II clones and redesigned Super Battle Droids). However, the Octuptarra tri-droid is a notable addition to the set as well.
            
 
 Top 10 Star Wars LEGO Of 2023 
2023&#39;s LEGO Star Wars line is quite impressive with sets inspired by The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and the Return of the Jedi&#39;s 40th Anniversary.








 1  The Crimson Firehawk 
(75384)
        

  Name   Piece Count   Price   Minifigures   Ages    The Crimson Firehawk (75384)   136   $49.99   3   4&#43;    
Following the release of Tenoo Jedi Temple (75358) in 2023, collectors can now complete the trio of Padawans from Young Jedi Adventures with the addition of Nubs in The Crimson Firehawk (75384). Catering to the youngest fans of the galaxy far, far away, this January 1st, 2024 model is a solid starter set that also comes with minifigures of the Crimson Firehawk&#39;s young pilot Nash Durango along with her droid sidekick RJ-83. However, at $49.99, the price-to-piece ratio is likely not as balanced as many would prefer.
