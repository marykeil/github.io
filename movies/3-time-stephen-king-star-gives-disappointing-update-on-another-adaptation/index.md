## Literature Review

Three-time Stephen King star Thomas Jane offers a disappointing update for another adaptation that ended up being canceled prior to production.




Three-time Stephen King star Thomas Jane has given a disappointing update on an adaptation that won&#39;t see the light of day. Jane has starred in three films based on King&#39;s work so far, those being The Mist, Dreamcatcher, and 1922. Jane is an outspoken King reader and has been working on another potential horror adaptation.




Speaking on The Kingcast, however, Jane reveals his plans for adapting King&#39;s From a Buick 8 were canceled due to the rights lapsing. While a team had been assembled to write the film, the pandemic caused them to lose the rights to make the movie. Check out what Jane had to say below:


Unfortunately it&#39;s not.... We had Jim Mickle, and, in fact, the week we were supposed to go out and pitch it is when the world shut down. So we put that on hold. And then when we started kind of creeping out of the pandemic, I got Mark [Fergus] and Hawk [Ostby] who wrote Children of Men and Iron Man 3 - and they also helped create The Expanse. So I brought them on board, and we were working on it. And then we had to rug pulled out from under us because Stephen&#39;s agent had actually...without bothering to tell us, he&#39;d informed us that our lease had lapsed.... It was just because of the pandemic. Technically the option had lapsed a long time ago because nobody was doing anything...so it was just a matter of miscommunication.
I think James Wan&#39;s company has it now. And we were hoping that they would turn in a different draft that nobody liked, but apparently they do like it! Because, obviously, we were first in line to get back. So we&#39;ll see what happens. We continue to follow it. The road from script to screen can be long and circuitous. So we&#39;ll see what happens. But yeah, that was disappointing.






 Will From A Buick 8 Still Get A Film Adaptation? 
          

From a Buick 8 tells the story of a supernatural car, the second story after King&#39;s classic book Christine to feature a haunted automobile. However, unlike the possession story of his previous tale, the Buick Roadmaster in the newer story appears connected to an alternate reality. Because of how different the concept is, it will make for a unique adaptation if brought to the big screen.

As Jane confirms, it appears James Wan&#39;s company Atomic Monster now has the film rights for the car-based horror novel. Since the script that&#39;s been written for it has been approved, it seems an adaptation will be making it to the big screen, but not in the way the actor hoped. His story shows just how much the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the film industry, causing projects like his to be cancelled or reworked by other studios.




                  9 Planned Stephen King Movies That Still Haven&#39;t Happened (&amp; Whether They Ever Will)   Stephen King is the most popular living author to be adapted with dozens of his works inspiring TV and film, but more are still in development hell.   

Even though Jane won&#39;t be able to adapt the movie himself, From a Buick 8&#39;s future on the big screen appears to be in good hands. Although it&#39;s disappointing the long-time Stephen King adaptation star won&#39;t be involved, it&#39;s the unfortunate reality brought upon Hollywood by the pandemic. Perhaps the actor will be involved in another project based on the horror author&#39;s work sometime in the future.



From a Buick 8 joins the likes of The Life of Chuck and The Dark Tower for upcoming adaptations.
