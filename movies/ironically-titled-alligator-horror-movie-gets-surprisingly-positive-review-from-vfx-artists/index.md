## Literature Review

Despite being exactly what it sounds like, the 2023 parody movie Bad CGI Gator gets a surprisingly positive review from real VFX artists.




The ironically titled horror film Bad CGI Gator gets a surprisingly positive review from VFX artists. Directed by Danny Draven, the movie follows college students who inadvertently create a dangerous and predatory CG alligator while vacationing in Georgia&#39;s swampland. The cast includes Maddie Lane, Michael Bonini, Ben VanderMey, and Rebecca Stoughton. Released back in November, Bad CGI Gator was produced by Full Moon Features, the same company that made headlines for turning the phenomenon of &#34;Barbenheimer&#34; into an upcoming movie.




In Corridor Crew&#39;s latest video, VFX artists looked at Bad CGI Gator and gave positive feedback regarding the movie&#39;s antagonistic creature. Check out their comments below:


 

They explained how Bad CGI Gator was intentional with its choices, poking fun at similar films involving deadly animals and poor digital effects. Wren noted, &#34;It’s like there’s just enough effort put into it, where it kind of technically works, but it’s not something you’d see from a VFX studio.” They also credited the movie, mentioning its use of lighting and depth of field, and revealed that in terms of quality, &#34;This isn&#39;t the sort of bad that comes from amateur skill.&#34;


 Bad CGI Gator Is So Bad, It&#39;s Good 
          




Horror parodies, including the Scary Movie franchise, tend to attract viewers because of their intentional shortcomings or outlandish scenarios. When it comes to Bad CGI Gator, the physical transformation of an already menacing creature was brought about by technology. The characters, who use social media references and slang vocabulary, toss their laptops into water without considering the possible reactions. Once the alligator grows in size, it begins terrorizing the friend group in humorous ways.

One of the most memorable scenes from Bad CGI Gator includes the reptile devouring Chad and appearing to fly. As Corridor Crew discussed some of the bizarre things that went on, Jordan noted that a film aiming to be this &#34;bad&#34; would have to &#34;keep getting worse.&#34; Compared to 2019&#39;s Crawl and other alligator-based horror movies, the creature does look noticeably fake. It&#39;s also nowhere near as tense, but the tone of Bad CGI Gator is part of what makes it so entertaining.




It&#39;s interesting to hear what actual VFX artists have to say about Bad CGI Gator, especially since their reactions were positive. While the effects may seem poorly done, Corridor Crew&#39;s comments suggest that those who worked on the film knew what they were doing, making the end result all the more enjoyable.
