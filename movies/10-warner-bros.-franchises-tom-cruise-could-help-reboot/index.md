 10 Best Tom Cruise Movies, Ranked 
With a career spanning more than 40 years, Tom Cruise is one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest stars. From comedies to action movies, the actor has done it all.












 








 10  Tom Cruise Could Reboot Ocean&#39;s As An Action Franchise 
Ocean&#39;s


 







The Ocean&#39;s franchise is one of Warner Bros.&#39;s most popular IPs, with the 2001 Ocean&#39;s Eleven reboot renewing interest in the classic franchise. Although George Clooney&#39;s trilogy has been finished for a number of years, Warner Bros. Discovery is clearly interested in revitalizing its popularity, with this being proven by the existence of Ocean&#39;s Eight and the upcoming Ocean&#39;s Eleven prequel. Tom Cruise is one of the few actors charismatic enough to take over George Clooney&#39;s spot as the franchise&#39;s leading man, with Cruise potentially rebooting Ocean&#39;s as an action movie series.





 9  Lethal Weapon Could Be Rebooted With Tom Cruise 
Lethal Weapon
        

The Lethal Weapon franchise is one of the most popular buddy cop IPs of the 1980s and 1990s, and Tom Cruise would be the perfect actor to spearhead the next film. Rather than doing Lethal Weapon 5, a new Lethal Weapon movie starring Tom Cruise in Mel Gibson&#39;s role could work, as Tom Cruise would fit right into a buddy cop action franchise. The Lethal Weapon movies feature adrenaline-pumping action and massive setpieces, which is why it would be perfect for Tom Cruise.





 8  Tom Cruise Can Overhaul Police Academy 
Police Academy
        

Although it may be tricky to pull off, Tom Cruise could potentially overhaul the Police Academy franchise. 1984&#39;s Police Academy was a hugely successful comedy that got a litany of sequels, but the franchise has been dormant for over two decades now. Although Tom Cruise isn&#39;t mostly known for making comedies, Cruise could potentially pull it off, with him having given hilarious performances in films like Tropic Thunder.





 7  Tom Cruise Could Replace Clint Eastwood As Dirty Harry 
Dirty Harry
        

Sticking with police stories, Tom Cruise could also take over the controversial cop franchise Dirty Harry. Clint Eastwood played the titular rogue police officer in the original film as well as its sequels, but it is doubtful that Eastwood will ever return for another sequel. However, Tom Cruise has the same vibe and performance background as Eastwood, with the action star being a fantastic choice to take over as Dirty Harry. Dirty Harry 6 never happened, but the franchise could now come back with Tom Cruise at the helm.





 6  Tom Cruise Would Be Perfect For Blade Runner 
Blade Runner
        

Movies like Edge of Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, and Vanilla Sky prove that Tom Cruise is interested in sci-fi, and he could take this interest to the next level by taking over one of Warner Bros.&#39; most popular sci-fi franchises: Blade Runner. Tom Cruise could pull off the quiet and stoic noir performance that Harrison Ford gives in Blade Runner and Ryan Gosling gives in Blade Runner 2049, while Cruise&#39;s action background could make the series even more exciting. Cruise could either reboot Blade Runner or play an entirely new blade runner in a spinoff or sequel.





 5  Mad Max Would Let Tom Cruise Continue His Stunt Trend 
Mad Max


 







Although Warner Bros.&#39;s Mad Max franchise is still going strong, with upcoming Mad Max projects including a fourth film and a Furiosa prequel movie, Tom Cruise could definitely find room somewhere in the series. One of Tom Cruise&#39;s defining characteristics as an actor is the fact that he does his own stunts, something that is key to the Mad Max franchise as well. Tom Cruise and Mad Max are a match made in heaven, with Cruise hopefully appearing in the Wasteland soon.





 4  Tootsie Would Be Tom Cruise&#39;s Perfect Comedy Spin 
Tootsie
        

While it might sound weird at first, no other actor is better for a remake of Tootsie than Tom Cruise. The original Tootsie starred Dustin Hoffman, an incredibly popular and incredibly serious actor, with the actor&#39;s persona making the main joke of Tootsie hit home even more. Having Tom Cruise dress up as an unrecognizable female actor would be a hilarious new direction for Cruise, with it allowing the actor to further delve into the comedy angle that was seen in Tropic Thunder.





 3  Tom Cruise Could Be The Next Fugitive 
The Fugitive
        

Harrison Ford&#39;s The Fugitive was a massively popular reboot of the classic TV series of the same name, with it following a man who escapes prison after being wrongfully accused of the murder of his wife, with the titular escapee having to find the real killer before he is caught. Tom Cruise would be a fantastic Richard Kimble, bringing the story of The Fugitive to a whole new generation.





 2  Tom Cruise Is The Perfect Choice To Reboot 1968&#39;s Bullitt 
Bullitt
        

Cop movies are a dime a dozen, but the movie that is often pointed to as being the originator of cop movies and action movies as a whole is 1968&#39;s Bullitt. Steve McQueen stars in the film as the titular police officer, with it being one of the actor&#39;s most iconic performances. One of the reasons that Bullitt was so popular was just how cool McQueen was in the role, something that Cruise could definitely match. On top of that, Bullitt filmed some famously dangerous car chases as well as other stunts, with this being right up Tom Cruise&#39;s alley.





 1  Tom Cruise Could Take Over The Adventures Of Robin Hood 
The Adventures of Robin Hood
        

One of Warner Bros.&#39;s earliest major successes was 1938&#39;s The Adventures of Robin Hood, with many considering it one of the greatest movies of all time. However, Warner Bros. hasn&#39;t done much with the Robin Hood franchise since then, which is why Tom Cruise needs to revitalize the IP now. Robin Hood has been rebooted by different studios multiple times, but Tom Cruise&#39;s partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery could allow the team to make the defining Robin Hood movie of the modern era.
