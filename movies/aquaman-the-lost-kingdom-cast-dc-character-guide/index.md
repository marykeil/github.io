## Literature Review

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the final DCEU film ahead of the imminent DCU reboot, features a large cast of both new and returning characters.




Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom features a large cast of returning and new characters. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending rounded off Arthur Curry&#39;s DCEU journey before 2024 ushers in James Gunn&#39;s DCU slate of movies and shows. The film follows Arthur Curry&#39;s new roles as both a father and King of the Seven Seas, all while dealing with Black Manta&#39;s attempts to destroy his life and loved ones in order to avenge the villain&#39;s father.




By the Aquaman ending, Arthur Curry finally embraced his destiny as DC&#39;s King of Atlantis, defeating his half-brother Orm/Ocean Master who sought to take over the Seven Kingdoms and then wage war on the surface world. By the end of Aquaman 2&#39;s Easter egg-infused journey, Arthur reclaims his stake as King of Atlantis by forging appearances with his former enemy Ocean Master to defeat Black Manta and the Lost Kingdom of Necrus. As such, the cast of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was of utmost importance to the movie, while also being subject to some uncertainty due to behind-the-scenes franchise changes.

                  Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom Post-Credits Scene Explained   We discuss whether Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has a credits scene and explain what it means, how it concludes the DCEU and sets up the DCU.   


 Jason Momoa As Arthur Curry/Aquaman 
The King of Atlantis returns in the final DCEU installment.
         




 The titular hero of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Jason Momoa reprises his role as Arthur Curry, King of Atlantis. The son of Queen Atlanna and human Tom Curry, Arthur belongs to both the worlds of land and sea. He&#39;s also a member of the Justice League, having been one of the first heroes Batman sought to recruit against the forces of Darkseid. In the sequel, Aquaman confronts the complexities of his past and future, both as a family man and as the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, while coming under siege from Black Manta.

Prior to his multiple appearances in the DC Universe as Aquaman, Jason Momoa is known for his iconic role as Khal Drogo in Game of Thrones as well as Ducan Idaho in Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Dune. He was also notably the primary villain in Fast X, Dante Reyes, opposite Vin Diesel&#39;s Dominic Toretto. After Aquaman 2, Momoa could continue in James Gunn&#39;s DCU only as a different character, long rumored to be DC Comics&#39; iconic bounty hunter Lobo.



 Patrick Wilson as Orm/Ocean Master 
The villain of 2018&#39;s Aquaman returns as a tentative ally for Aquaman against Black Manta.
          




Patrick Wilson returns in Aquaman 2 as the Ocean Master, more commonly known as Orm. Fulfilling a role much like Marvel&#39;s Loki in Thor: The Dark World, Orm reunites with his half-brother in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom as an uneasy ally, teaming up with Arthur Curry to help defeat Black Manta. Wilson is best known for his roles in Zack Snyder&#39;s Watchmen, the Insidious and Conjuring franchises, and 2004&#39;s Phantom of the Opera.



 Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane/Black Manta 
The secondary antagonist of Aquaman becomes Arthur Curry&#39;s main threat in the 2023 sequel.
          

Yahya Abdul-Mateen II also returned as an Aquaman villain for Aquaman 2: Black Manta. Largely seen as Aquaman&#39;s primary arch-nemesis besides Ocean Master, Manta wants nothing more than revenge against Aquaman for his role in the death of his father, with this being the character&#39;s driving force in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. In the sequel, Black Manta sports a more classic look with a silver helmet, rather than the all-black suit he created in the first movie, reflecting Black Manta taking on the primary villain role now Ocean Master is an ally of Aquaman.




                  Aquaman 2 Villain: Black Manta Powers &amp; Comics History Explained   Black Manta returns as the main Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom villain, and the two arch-rivals have a long history throughout DC Comics.   

 Beyond Aquaman, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is best known for his roles in HBO&#39;s Watchmen series. Similarly, the actor portrayed the titular Candyman in the 2021 sequel of the classic horror film. Mateen was also in the cast of The Trial of the Chicago 7 and has a decidedly notable role as Agent Smith/Morpheus in The Matrix Resurrections.



 Amber Heard As Mera 
The love interest of Arthur Curry becomes his wife and queen in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
         

 In Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Amber Heard returned as Mera, the Princess of Xebel. While Mera appears in the sequel, her role is significantly smaller than the almost deuteragonist role she received in 2018&#39;s Aquaman. This was reportedly due to the lack of chemistry between Heard and Momoa as Aquaman, though many assume it was due to the controversy surrounding her recent defamation lawsuit with Johnny Depp.




That being said, Aquaman 2 revealed that Mera was acting as the queen of Atlantis alongside Arthur while the two raised a child together. This made the matter of her limited role in the movie somewhat more confusing. Beyond playing Mera in the DCEU, Heard is best known for her roles in The Rum Diary, 3 Days to Kill, and Drive Angry.



 Indya Moore as Karshon 
A DC Comics character gets a significant overhaul in Aquaman 2.
          

Indya Moore joined Aquaman 2 as Karshon after being absent from the first film. Originally a Green Lantern villain in the pages of DC Comics, Karshon was a normal tiger shark who mutated into a super-humanoid due to a radioactive explosion. While the character very much looks like DC&#39;s King Shark - who made his live-action debut in The Suicide Squad - Aquaman 2 took some massive creative liberties to have more of a distinction between the two characters.




In Aquaman 2, Karshon is not a shark at all. Instead, Moore plays Karshon as a regular Atlantean and the leader of the Council of Atlantis. The character served as a very minor antagonist in the film, opposing Aquaman&#39;s wishes to unveil Atlantis to the human world. Besides Aquaman 2. Moore is best known for her roles in Escape Room: Tournament of Champions, Queen and Slim, and Pose.



 Jani Zhao as Stingray 
Black Manta&#39;s roster of lackeys is spearheaded by an original character for the film.
          

One of the many villains as part of Black Manta&#39;s crew in Aquaman 2 was Stingray, played by Jani Zhao. In the film, Stingray is shown to be increasingly loyal to Black Manta&#39;s cause, opposing the likes of Orm, Aquaman, and Randall Park&#39;s character. Zhao is known for her roles in Sentimentos, California, South, and The Sugar Captains.

Does Ben Affleck Appear In Aquaman 2?
Ben Affleck&#39;s role in Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was reportedly intact for a long while, allowing the iteration of the character a role in the final DC film before the imminent DCU. However, various reports indicated that these plans changed in reshoots - likely in response to audience confusion at George Clooney replacing Affleck at the end of The Flash. As such, Aquaman 2&#39;s release confirmed that the latter reports were true as Affleck does not have an appearance in the film, nor do any other iterations of Batman.






This decision was likely made to avoid confusion when the DCU&#39;s new Batman makes an appearance, given the DCEU/DCU&#39;s endlessly confusing timeline.






 Aquaman 2&#39;s Supporting Cast &amp; Characters 
What other actors appear in the final DCEU movie?
          

Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin - Determined to expose Atlantis&#39; existence, Dr. Stephen Shin returns in Aquaman 2 played by Randall Park. As revealed in the post-credits scene for Aquaman, Shin rescued Black Manta with the implication that there would be a future team-up. Park is known for his roles in Fresh of the Boat, The Interview, Always Be My Maybe, as well as the MCU&#39;s Jimmy Woo in Marvel&#39;s Ant-Man movies and WandaVision.

Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna - Nicole Kidman returns in Aquaman 2 as Atlanna, Arthur&#39;s mother and the former queen of Atlantis. Kidman is known for her roles in Moulin Rouge!, Rabbit Hole, The Hours, and Paddington.




Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry - Temeura Morrison also reprises his role in the final DCEU film as Tom Curry, Arthur&#39;s human father. Morrison is best known for his roles in the Star Wars galaxy as Jango and Boba Fett (as well as their millions of clones).

Dolph Lundgren as King Nereus - Dolph Lundgren has a somewhat smaller role in Aquaman 2 as Xebel&#39;s King Nereus, Mera&#39;s father. Lundgren is best known for his role in Rocky IV as Ivan Drago as well as He-Man in 1987&#39;s Masters of the Universe. He also played Gunner Jensen in the Expendables franchise.

Pilou Asbæk as King Kordax - The crux of Black Manta&#39;s plan in Aquaman 2 centers on freeing King Kordax from his imprisonment by King Atlan. Kordax is freed at the end of the film and resembles a villainous skeleton, though Pilou Asbæk played the character in flashback. Asbæk is best known for his role as Euron Greyjoy in the HBO series Game of Thrones​​​​​​​.

Vincent Regan as King Atlan - The third actor to be cast in the DCEU role, Vincent Regan plays King Atlan in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Atlan was the ruler of Atlantis prior to its submergence beneath the waves and also fought back against Darkseid during his first invasion of Earth. Regan is known for his roles in 300, Troy, and Clash of the Titans.
