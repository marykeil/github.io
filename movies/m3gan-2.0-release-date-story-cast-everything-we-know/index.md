## Literature Review

After she terrorized audiences back in 2022, M3GAN is returning in a sequel, and there are already a ton of exciting updates about the new movie. 




M3GAN 2 seemed like a sure thing after the success of the first film, and now updates are pouring in about the anticipated horror sequel. The film, directed by Gerard Johnstone, follows an artificially intelligent doll who becomes self-aware and acts hostile toward anyone who threatens her. With an eye towards contemporary issues, M3GAN brought the right amount of tongue-in-cheek humor to compliment its genuinely creepy premise.




M3GAN received high praise from critics, and it became a phenomenal hit after going viral on TikTok. The movie made $176 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo), which is even more impressive given its low budget of $12 million. Not only was the film a hit, but the character of M3GAN has the opportunity to blossom into the next great horror icon. The box office success of M3GAN all but confirmed a sequel would happen, and now it&#39;s official, as M3GAN 2 updates have revealed returning characters, the sequel&#39;s title, and a release date.


 M3GAN 2 Latest News 
          

Though the movie has been confirmed for a while, the latest news sees a major M3GAN cast member confirmed for the sequel. Young actor Violet McGraw, who played the role of Cady in the first film, has now confirmed that she will be reprising her role in M3GAN 2.0. The return of McGraw is a good sign for the sequel&#39;s success, since it was McGraw&#39;s stellar performance that helped to add emotional gravity to the somewhat silly premise of a killer doll. McGraw is enthusiastic about returning, saying &#34;I am literally dying to know what happens&#34;.






 M3GAN 2 Release Date 


 
The M3GAN 2 release date has been confirmed, and it will hit theaters on January 17, 2025. The original M3GAN was filmed in mid-2021, though it had to undergo reshoots to minimize the violence, the horror film had a relatively quick turnaround. Given how resourceful James Wan, Universal, and the crew are, M3GAN 2 could still keep that January 2025 date even if the development was affected by the writer&#39;s strike. It is not clear if the movie was delayed by the strikes.



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023.






 M3GAN 2 Cast 
          

Gemma (Allison Williams) and Cady (Violet McGraw) were the M3GAN main characters and miraculously, they both survived. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that they&#39;re the first characters confirmed to be returning in M3GAN 2. Other than that, there are no other details on which M3GAN actors will return for the sequel or what new characters will be introduced. It hasn&#39;t even been confirmed whether Jenna Davis will return to voice the titular doll.






 M3GAN 2 Story 
          

Though M3GAN doesn’t have a post-credits scene, its ending teases more to come, with M3GAN having transferred her AI processing system to Elsie, Gemma’s virtual home assistant. M3GAN may take on a new form, branching out into multiple tech gadgets to infiltrate Gemma’s home. With the AI doll’s body destroyed at the end of M3GAN, M3GAN will likely look a lot different in the horror sequel. For a while, M3GAN could be learning as much as she can in her new form before figuring out a way to either possess a new titanium body or take the form of a newly created robot.

Whatever M3GAN looks like in the future, she will surely want revenge on Gemma and Cady for trying to destroy her. If she continues developing her emergent abilities, M3GAN could lash out and become even more dangerous. With the power of other technologies under her control too, the doll could turn her attention to the world beyond M3GAN&#39;s Gemma and Cady. However, she may also want to continue protecting Cady as her original programming intended. Either way, the potential of M3GAN 2 could go anywhere, and that’s exciting.
