Summary

  Alan Ritchson, known for playing Reacher, is a fan favorite to play Batman in the new DC Universe.   Gritty fan art shows Ritchson as Batman with a broken cowl and bruised appearance.   The upcoming DC movie, The Brave and the Bold, will feature Damian Wayne as Robin and will be directed by Andy Muschietti.  






The rumor of Reacher&#39;s Alan Ritchson playing Batman in the new DC Universe comes to life in incredible fan art. The actor previously played two DC heroes in live-action, Aquaman in Smallville and Hawk in Titans. Now, Ritchson has become one of the fan favorites to lead DC&#39;s upcoming movies as the Batman of James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe, who will debut with an exciting story in The Brave and the Bold movie.

On Instagram, artist @spdrmnkyxxiii shared what Ritchson could look like as the DCU&#39;s Batman in gritty fan art.


 

The Reacher actor sports a few bruises, which can be seen through his broken cowl, which includes the comic book-accurate white eyes for Batman. With the level of physicality he could bring to the role, Ritchson would certainly be a unique addition to the live-action Batman actors lineup.

 What We Know About Batman In The Rebooted DCU 
Robin Will Make His Movie Return
          

DC&#39;s Batman reboot movie, The Brave and the Bold, will finally see Robin return to the big screen for the first time since Chris O&#39;Donnell played Dick Grayson in 1997&#39;s Batman &amp; Robin. This time around, DC will have another version of Robin appear, with Damian Wayne making his live-action debut. When announcing the movie, Gunn shared that The Brave and the Bold would focus on Bruce learning about Damian and getting to know him, with other members of the Bat-Family also set to appear.

The Brave and the Bold will be directed by a returning DC face, as The Flash director Andy Muschietti has been confirmed to helm the upcoming DCU film. While Muschietti&#39;s The Flash proved itself controversial, the movie&#39;s Batman and Bruce Wayne scenes with both Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton were among the best moments in the film. While the Batman reboot has a director attached, no actor has been confirmed to play Bruce Wayne, though a few have emerged as fan favorites for the role.

The favorite Batman fancasts for the DCU include names such as Jensen Ackles, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jake Gyllenhaal, Alan Ritchson, and a couple more. Ackles is currently the most popular choice for the role, with the Supernatural actor having addressed his chances of playing Batman, saying, &#34;I would love it. Sign me up.&#34; Ritchson, who became a popular name for the DCU Batman after the release of Reacher season 2, also commented on whether he would want to play Batman, saying, &#34;I would love to play Batman.&#34; With Gunn having confirmed there is no script for The Brave and the Bold yet, the DCU&#39;s Batman casting is still some time away.
