## Literature Review

Disliking the Marvel Cinematic Universe has become cool in recent years, with several recurring criticisms not holding up under scrutiny.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been getting undue amounts of flak in recent years, and much of the criticisms have been completely overblown. Ever since its inception, the MCU has garnered its fair share of vocal detractors, constantly admonishing the series for various perceived slights. The conclusion of the Infinity Saga also saw many former fans drop Marvel movies entirely. Whereas previously, enjoying Marvel movies for what they were was the popular position to take, the current day and age has seen a pointed dislike of the storied franchise quickly becoming the most commonly-held viewpoint.
That&#39;s not to say the Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn&#39;t deserve any criticism. There are plenty of aspects to both recent titles and older movies that are worth critiquing as genuine flaws that detract from the effectiveness of the film series. But when it comes to the same tired talking points, touched on over and over again by the MCU&#39;s most dedicated critics, they fail to hold up to any close scrutiny, being way less offensive than the public consensus would have one believe.









 








 10  The Humor Is Cringy… 
…Yet it was considered groundbreaking in the 2010s
        

The humor in Marvel movies has been a frequent point of contention among fans and outside observers alike, who have frequently bashed the comedic stylings of Phase 4 and 5 films as being cringy, outdated, or tiring. Yet it was this very humor that made the MCU popular in the first place, with Joss Whedon&#39;s genre-defining dialogue in The Avengers laying the groundwork for the series&#39; popularity. The same armchair critics that fondly remember shows like The Office and Parks and Rec, which use a similar brand of 2010s comedy, have suddenly begun to admonish its presence as if it wasn&#39;t always a part of Marvel&#39;s winning formula.





 9  There’s Too Much To Keep Track Of… 
…But recent MCU projects have had less integration than ever


 







While the age of Disney&#43; has opened up the floodgates for MCU content like never before, making space for a flood of side stories focused on minor characters that never would&#39;ve seen the light of day otherwise, many fans have begun to bemoan the perceived &#34;homework&#34; the series now requires, bashing the series as having become too interconnected. Actually examining Phase 4 and 5 films tells a different story, however. If anything, the MCU is too disconnected now, with only the slightest breadcrumbs of connectivity being sprinkled throughout the most recent films, most of which very much stand alone as separate stories.





 8  The Cinematography Is Bad… 
…Only for those with impossibly high standards


 







The finer aspects of filmmaking haven&#39;t gone untouched by the wave of MCU criticism in recent years, with the series seemingly never able to satisfy everyone with its cinematography choices. In 2016, Civil War&#39;s Airport fight was admonished for being too gray and bleak-looking, yet more recent films like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania have been criticized for being nauseatingly colorful. This just goes to show how Marvel Studios simply have no way to satisfy everyone in terms of their color-correction and camera work, no matter which direction they lean towards.





 7  The MCU Has Ruined Moviemaking… 
…Though prestige cinema has been on the upswing
        

Several of the MCU&#39;s most well-known critics have been movie-making legends, with famous directors like Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, and Martin Scorsese all having very publicly given their 2 cents about their dislike of the franchise, each of them decrying the franchise&#39;s effect on Hollywood as a whole. But prestige cinema has been doing better than ever, with Christopher Nolan&#39;s moody period biopic Oppenheimer being one of 2023&#39;s best performing movies and Scorsese&#39;s own Killers of the Flower Moon being a critical triumph. Whatever ill effect the MCU has on so-called &#34;true&#34; cinema, it can&#39;t be very strong.





 6  The Villains Are Forgettable… 
…Despite only a handful of villains falling into this category


 







Even if the series&#39; portrayal of heroes has been justifiably praised, a constant complaint that has stuck with the MCU from the beginning is Marvel&#39;s villain problem. While many films have had their antagonists criticized for being under developed, under utilized, or simply evil versions of the hero, the series has had just as many great villains as they&#39;ve had forgettable ones, if not more so. Indeed, Marvel has some of the greatest villains in cinematic history, with the likes of Thanos, Loki, and Killmonger all calling the series home.





 5  The MCU Has Too Many New Female Leads… 
…Because The Initial Franchise Had Very Few
        

One fair criticism the MCU has contended with in its earlier days was the lack of heroines, with the series not having a female-led solo film until Captain Marvel in 2019. Now that this flaw has been rightfully corrected, a vocal minority of fans have decried the series for having too many female characters, especially if they&#39;re powerful. This is yet another instance of Marvel Studios plainly being unable to appease everyone, getting equal amounts of flak for being male-dominated and having a more diverse roster.





 4  The MCU Has A Cookie Cutter Formula… 
…Even though it’s stepped into many different genres
        

Many have bad-mouthed the MCU for its generic formula, relied upon for consistently delivering similar movies utilizing the same tropes over and over again. Yet when all the Marvel movies are compared to one another, they couldn&#39;t be more different. From space operas with the Guardians of the Galaxy, to the Wuxia-style action of Shang Chi, and even spine-tingling horror analogues with Werewolf by Night and Doctor Strange in the Mutliverse of Madness, the MCU has stepped into many different genres, tones, and styles that disprove the notion of homogeny, especially in recent years.





 3  The MCU Is Too Political… 
…As if the comics haven’t always been
        

Over the years, the MCU&#39;s films haven&#39;t shied away from touching on political subjects, from the racial injustice alluded to in the Black Panther and Falcon and the Winter Soldier to Captain America&#39;s touch-and-go relationship with the U.S. government. This hasn&#39;t sat well with certain fans, who want their tentpole blockbuster films to be untainted by real-world politics. But the Marvel Comics have always been political, breaking the ground for societal commentary in the superhero landscape with stories like the original Civil War storyline and the very inception of the X-Men as an allegory for the civil rights movement.





 2  The Humor Undercuts The Tone… 
…In only a few bad examples
        

Regardless of whether the humor of the Marvel movies lands overall, many have felt that the comedy has frequently undermined the drama throughout the franchise, with otherwise poignant moments being usurped by the all-mighty punchline. While there are certainly a few bad examples of this being the case, the issue isn&#39;t nearly as pervasive as public sentiment would have one believe. Relatively humorless films like Black Panther: Wakanda Forever and Black Widow have been unafraid to play straight with their emotional stakes.





 1  The MCU Promotes The U.S. Military-Industrial Complex… 
…And Also Criticizes It
        

Some have leveled criticisms against the MCU for its glorification of the U.S. military, depicting heroic government agents utilizing military hardware against foreign threats in a positive light a la Michael Bay&#39;s Transformers series. But the series isn&#39;t afraid to draw attention to the darker side of the military-industrial complex. Tony Stark very much isn&#39;t supposed to be a hero making billions off of weaponry at the start of Iron Man, and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever straight up depicts the C.I.A. as bad guys meddling in foreign affairs. Unlike Bay, the MCU has no qualms against painting the U.S. in a negative light.
