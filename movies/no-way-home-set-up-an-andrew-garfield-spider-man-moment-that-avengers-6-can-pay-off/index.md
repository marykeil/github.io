## Literature Review

The premise of Avengers: Secret War provides the perfect opportunity to make a scene from No Way Home into some absolutely perfect foreshadowing.




Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire made their long-awaited returns as Spider-Man in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which also set up a potential crowd-pleasing moment for the former in Avengers: Secret Wars. Titled the Multiverse Saga, the three Marvel Cinematic Universe phases after Avengers: Endgame have, unsurprisingly, featured a plethora of alternate universe variants of classic Marvel characters, including iterations from older franchises. While the simple fact that the two previous Spider-Man iterations appeared in No Way Home in the first place is satisfying enough, one beloved moment between all three Spider-Man variants can and should have a payoff in Avengers 6.




The MCU timeline is no stranger to tasteful fan service, with Endgame – the conclusion to the Infinity Saga – notably having many of the franchise’s most satisfying payoffs. Captain America proved himself worthy of lifting Mjolnir (as teased in Avengers: Age of Ultron), Pepper Potts donned the Rescue armor (which was set up in Iron Man 3), and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man even used his Iron Spider suit’s “instant-kill mode” (paying off a comedic moment from Spider-Man: Homecoming). One notable line from Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man in No Way Home, however, is perfectly positioned to have its own callback in the upcoming MCU movie Avengers: Secret Wars.

                  Every Returning MCU &amp; Spider-Man Movie Character In No Way Home   Spider-Man: No Way Home has a big cast that includes familiar faces from past Spider-Man films and returning MCU characters like Doctor Strange.    


 Andrew Garfield&#39;s Spider-Man Can Finally Fight Aliens 
          




Shortly before battling their multiversal foes, all three Spider-Man variants chat atop the Statue of Liberty. In one notable moment, the trio compare their respective rogues galleries, with Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland’s Spider-Man variants noting that they’ve both fought aliens. This prompts Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man to exclaim “I want to fight an alien,” as his villains have, thus far, only consisted of cross-species monstrosities and ordinary humans who gained superpowers or use advanced technology.

While neither Tobey Maguire nor Andrew Garfield are confirmed to return to the big screen, both actors have expressed interest in reviving their respective Spider-Man film franchises and a popular hope among viewers is that both Spider-Man variants will return in Secret Wars to team up with Tom Holland’s Spider-Man once again. As the conclusion to the Multiverse Saga, it would not be surprising to have Kang the Conqueror’s forces include alien minions, which presents the perfect opportunity to have a comedic and satisfying moment in which Garfield’s Spider-Man fights aliens like his alternate universe “brothers”. Of course, there are other potential payoffs for the Spider-Man variants in Avengers 6 as well.






 Secret Wars Can Have Other Spider-Man Payoffs 
          

While having Andrew Garfield’s Spider-Man finally fight aliens would be the easiest payoff in Secret Wars, there are other potential callbacks to Spider-Man: No Way Home. Depending on how much exposition the Peter Parker variants get in their reunion, Garfield’s Spider-Man could reveal that he has abandoned his previous brutal methods, having found hope again. Shailene Woodley’s Mary Jane Watson could be re-canonized, confirming that Garfield’s Spider-Man has moved on from Gwen Stacy. Avengers: Secret Wars could also reveal that Mayday Parker – Spider-Girl – exists in Maguire’s universe and perhaps even have her fight alongside her father and the other two Spider-Man iterations.
