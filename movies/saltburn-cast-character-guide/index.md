## Literature Review



The black comedy in Saltburn is driven by its well-written characters, who are portrayed by a talented roster of cast members. Set in England, Saltburn follows a scholarship student, Oliver Quick, whose inexperience with the mannerisms of the elite makes him an outcast. However, things start changing when he becomes friends with the affluent and famous Felix Catton, who sympathizes with him after hearing the stories about his parents and their struggles. Felix invites him to join him and his family at their estate, Saltburn, to make him feel more comfortable.




Oliver unanimously accepts the invitation, but little does he realize that his arrival at Saltburn will trigger a chain reaction of terrifying events. Saltburn&#39;s compelling drama and shocking ending is gripping enough to keep most viewers hooked throughout its 2-hour runtime. However, the movie is further elevated by the stellar performances of its cast, making it hard not to wonder who plays whom.

 Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick 
          

Oliver Quick is one of the main characters in Saltburn who attends Oxford University but struggles to fit in with the elites that surround him. What makes things worse is that many of his batchmates look down on him because of his social status. Fortunately for him, he eventually finds Felix, which gives him the opportunity to change the trajectory of his social life. In Saltburn, Barry Keoghan plays Oliver Quick. The actor won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for playing Dominic in The Banshees of Inisherin and also earned Golden Globe and Oscar nominations for his role in the Martin McDonagh film.

Unlike Oliver, Felix belongs to a wealthy aristocratic family. Owing to this, he easily gets along with the elites at his institution. What makes him different, however, is that he does not look down on Oliver. Instead, he befriends him and even takes him to his family mansion, Saltburn, for the summer. Jacob Elordi rose to fame for his roles in coming-of-age movies and television shows like Kissing Booth and Euphoria. However, 2023 took his acting career in a whole new direction after he portrayed Elvis in Pricilla and Ian in The Sweet East.






 Rosamund Pike as Elsbeth Catton 
          

Saltburn establishes that Felix takes after his mother, Elsbeth. She, too, empathizes with Oliver after hearing about his family tragedy. She even welcomes him to their estate with open arms and ensures he feels right at home with them. Rosamund Pike, of the Gone Girl, Jack Reacher, and Pride &amp; Prejudice fame, plays Elsbeth Catton in Saltburn. Apart from being known for her movie roles, the actress has also garnered fame and acclaim for her appearances in TV shows like The Wheel of Time, Moominvalley, Radioactive, and Thunderbirds Are Go.
