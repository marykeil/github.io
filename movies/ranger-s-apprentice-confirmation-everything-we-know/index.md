## Literature Review

The beloved YA fantasy series Ranger&#39;s Apprentice is finally coming to the big screen in a movie adaptation, and there are already exciting updates. 




The long-running YA fantasy novel series Ranger&#39;s Apprentice is finally getting an adaptation and the movie is already coming along with exciting updates. The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice series was penned by Australian author John Flanagan, and follows young Will who is an apprentice to the King&#39;s Rangers who learns the necessary skills to protect the kingdom of Araluen from various threats. Stretching across 17 main books and numerous short stories and novellas, Flanagan crafted a bona fide fantasy universe that has been read by millions around the globe. 




Young adult books have been a promising wellspring of material for Hollywood since movies like the Harry Potter series set box office records in the early 2000s, and studios have long searched for their next big franchise. Young adult fantasy series like The Chronicles of Narnia, Percy Jackson, and The Hunger Games had varying degrees of success throughout the 2000s and 2010s, but the genre tapered off as the 2010s wore on. Now, the young adult fantasy genre is reigniting once again, and Ranger&#39;s Apprentice has an opportunity to be the next ongoing blockbuster movie series.


 Ranger&#39;s Apprentice Is Confirmed 
          

Existing in one form or another for years, the most recent version of the Ranger&#39;s Apprentice movie adaptation was officially announced in January 2024. The upcoming adaptation will be produced by Skydance Media, which has financial backing from Paramount Pictures, and Ted Melfi has been tapped to direct the first in what is a planned series. Author John Flanagan will be an executive producer, but the scope of his involvement in the project is still unknown at this point. The first movie will adapt the first two novels, The Ruins of Gorlan and The Burning Bridge. 






 Who Is Making The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice Movie? 
          

So far, only a few names have been attached to the project, but they offer a clear picture of what the long-term plan is for the franchise. Flanagan&#39;s epic book series is one of the few successful YA series that hasn&#39;t been touched by Hollywood yet, and the first of a planned franchise of Ranger&#39;s Apprentice movies is going to be helmed by Ted Melfi. The celebrated director is most known for the understated dramedy St. Vincent and the Oscar-nominated box office smash Hidden Figures. 

Skydance Media, the production company behind the adaptation, is responsible for a wide range of entertainment, from hit shows like Reacher and Foundation to successful movies like The Family Plan. Unlike the previous attempts to adapt the books, Skydance&#39;s approach seems the most likely to succeed since the company has a large network and a proven track record of hits. 






 Ranger&#39;s Apprentice Story 
          

It has been announced that the first movie will adapt the first two novels in Flanagan&#39;s series, meaning it will draw from The Ruins of Gorlan and The Burning Bridge. The first book introduces Will, a 15-year-old who is drafted as a Ranger&#39;s Apprentice, and follows him as he learns the ways of the Ranger and of the looming threat of the evil Morgarath who plans to seize the kingdom of Araluen. 

The movie will likely combine the plot of the first novel with the plot of the second, The Burning Bridge, which sees Will and his allies do battle with Morgarath&#39;s forces as they attempt to cross the impassible mountain range into the kingdom. Since the books are of the young adult variety, the individual novels are too scant for one movie alone. Therefore, it only makes sense that the first movie will combine the first two Ranger&#39;s Apprentice books.
