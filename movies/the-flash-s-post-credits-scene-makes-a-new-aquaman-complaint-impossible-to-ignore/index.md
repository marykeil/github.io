Summary

  Aquaman&#39;s newfound responsibilities as a king and father are in conflict with his indulgent, drunken behavior showcased in The Flash&#39;s post-credits scene.   The contradiction between Aquaman&#39;s devotion to his family and kingdom and his irresponsible behavior raises questions about his ability to balance his roles effectively.   Aquaman&#39;s questionable parenting tactics, such as leaving his newborn unsupported and engaging in reckless activities, portray him as a sub-par father, potentially causing disapproval among parents of newborns.  






Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is in theaters now and has given rise to a new complaint that is impossible to ignore following the events of the post-credits scene of The Flash. The DCEU&#39;s final movie follows Arthur Curry in his new role as the King of Atlantis and a new father and family man, balancing life on both land and sea as Jason Momoa&#39;s tenure as the exuberant Atlantean ostensibly comes to an end. The perfectly cast DCEU actor has done a lot to help rehabilitate the image of the hero who is often mocked for his powers, turning him into perhaps the most charismatic member of the Justice League.

Since its release on December 19, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has been stirring up controversy as the final DCEU movie struggles to stick the landing critically and financially, yet has created an all-too-familiar gulf between critics and fans in terms of Rotten Tomatoes score. That controversy, however, might extend to Arthur Curry&#39;s behavior now that he has taken on two roles of exceptionally high responsibility. Namely, as that of a king and that of a father, but one that supposedly has time to gallivant like he used to.

 The Flash&#39;s Post-Credits Scene Doesn&#39;t Work After The Lost Kingdom 
          

In the post-credits scene of The Flash, Barry Allen explains to Arthur Curry that he is the same person in every universe despite Bruce Wayne, for example, often being different. Aquaman, meanwhile, is incredibly drunk, which Allen explains is something that he can&#39;t experience due to his supercharged metabolism. Aquaman, out of all the Justice League members, was easily the one most likely, and most at liberty, to enjoy himself while he can - but in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Curry is supposedly &#34;devoted&#34; to his job as the King of Atlantis and being a father.

If this is the case, then Aquaman&#39;s drunken antics seem to contradict this. After all, if he has a newborn at home that he is apparently devoted to taking care of and a Kingdom to run with subjects that he needs to win over, then it is hard to see how he has time to sleep face-down in a puddle in Central City. The fact that Arthur Curry, despite his super-human physiology, is capable of getting so drunk also does not bode well for his antics while being a father to his son, Arthur Jr., either.



 Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom Suggests Arthur Is A Terrible Father 
          

Aquaman is a fun-loving person, but several scenes in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom certainly help to paint him as a sub-par father. Drinking Guinness with his father while in charge of the baby, for instance, is probably fine in moderation - but his drunken antics in Central City throw doubt on Arthur&#39;s capacity for moderation. Showing off to the newborn on a motorbike and leaving him unsupported on a sofa aren&#39;t exactly the most advisable parenting tactics, either. While this doesn&#39;t make Arthur any less of a devoted father - it paints him in a questionable light that probably won&#39;t sit well with parents of newborns.
