## Literature Review

The first clip from The Beekeeper has been released, showing Jason Statham’s character protecting his hive in a bone-crunching new fight scene.




The Beekeeper&#39;s first clip has been released, showing Jason Statham deliver a devastating uppercut while protecting his hive. Directed by David Ayer, the upcoming action film sees Statham starring as the titular character, with a story following the former government operative as he embarks on a brutal quest for vengeance. In addition to Statham, The Beekeeper&#39;s cast also includes Josh Hutcherson, Jeremy Irons, and Emmy Raver-Lampman, among others. 




Now, ahead of The Beekeeper&#39;s release date, Rotten Tomatoes debuts the first clip from the film. Watch the clip below:


 

The clip sees Statham dousing an operations room in gasoline before taking on a handful of security personnel, handily dispatching each one and giving viewers a taste of the bone-crunching action to come in the upcoming movie.

                  David Ayer’s New Movie Desperately Needs To Break A Bad 10-Year Streak   David Ayer returns with a new movie in 2024 starring Jason Statham, and The Beekeeper desperately needs to break the director&#39;s bad 10-year streak.   


 What To Expect From The Beekeeper 
          




As teased in the latest clip, The Beekeeper sports an R-rating due to &#34;strong violence throughout, pervasive language, some sexual references and drug use.&#34; This rating largely continues a trend for Ayer, who is responsible for gritty films like The Tax Collector, Fury, Sabotage, and End of Watch. The Beekeeper will mark the first collaboration between Statham and Ayer. 



Ayer&#39;s last three films, The Tax Collector, Bright, and Suicide Squad, were all received quite poorly, which means The Beekeeper has an opportunity to break this disappointing trend.




As previously revealed in The Beekeeper&#39;s trailer, the plot of the film revolves around Statham&#39;s character, whose real name is Adam Clay, seeking revenge after someone close to him becomes the victim of a devastating cyberattack. The latest clip seemingly takes place fairly early on in Statham&#39;s quest, with the character having pinpointed the origin of the scam and put a plan into motion to blow the facility to pieces.




In addition to being an actual beekeeper, Clay is revealed to be a member of a special forces task force of the same name, which operated without government oversight. His unique set of skills will come in handy as he uncovers that the cyber crime perpetrated against his friend is actually part of a much larger conspiracy. Although the Statham-starring Meg 2: The Trench performed well upon its release last summer, The Expendables 4&#39;s box office was a major disappointment, and it&#39;s not currently clear how The Beekeeper will compare.
