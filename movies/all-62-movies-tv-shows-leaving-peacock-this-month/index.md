## Literature Review

The NBC/Universal affiliated streaming service Peacock features a revolving door of great shows and movies. Here&#39;s everything leaving January 2024.




NBC and Universal&#39;s signature streaming service Peacock features a wide variety of movies and TV shows that change from month to month, and many big titles are leaving Peacock in January 2024. First launched in July 2020, Peacock hit the ground running by carrying some of the most popular NBC shows and movies from day one. Since then, the streamer has diversified its platform by creating hit original shows like Bel-Air, and it has quickly positioned itself as one of the top subscription services on the market. Despite its wealth of content, Peacock is in a constant state of change, which sees many shows and movies leave each month.




With the backing of a powerful company like NBC, Peacock has thrown its hat in the original content ring and has produced new shows and movies that rival even the best that network TV has to offer. Additionally, the streamer has also branched out into the world of live sports which has made Peacock a live-streaming destination for fans of professional wrestling, soccer, and motorsports. The new shows and movies on Peacock have gained a loyal subscriber base, but with additions also comes the departure of popular content. These movies and TV shows leave Peacock in January 2024.

                  The 35 Best TV Shows On Peacock (January 2024)   Peacock, NBCUniversal&#39;s streaming platform, is growing its library of exclusive content. Here are some of the best TV series the service has to offer.   


 January 7 
          




  Christmas at the Opry (2023)  

With the holiday season officially over, it’s understandable that any lingering holiday content will leave Peacock in January. That includes this special presentation. Christmas at the Opry brought musicians together at the Grand Ole Opry to sing and spread holiday cheer. This particular special was recorded and broadcast for 2023, so it’s entirely possible fans of holiday concerts could see another one, but it won’t be until December 2024.



 January 14 
         

  Fast X (2023)   Saturday Night Live A Christmas Special (2023)  

Peacock has been the exclusive streaming home for Fast X since it moved from theaters to streaming. That changes on January 14. With the latest installment of the Fast and Furious franchise leaving Peacock, it will likely have a new streaming home soon, but before it finds one, Fast X will still be able to rent on digital platforms as well.




Interestingly, Saturday Night Live’s 2023 Christmas Special will also leave Peacock the same day. Unlike other new episodes of Saturday Night Live, the special is only available for a month before it’s removed. There’s still almost the entirety of the series available on Peacock, but the removal of a single episode, even if it is holiday-themed, is surprising.



 January 30 
          

  The Last Witch Hunter (2015)  

Another movie fronted by Vin Diesel leaves Peacock this January. It’s also another of his action movies, though it’s very different from the Fast and Furious franchise. Instead of a focus on family and fast cars, The Last Witch Hunter focuses on one man, cursed with eternal life, who has to stop dark magic from causing a worldwide plague. Though the movie wasn’t a hit with critics, thanks to the performances of Diesel, Elijah Wood, Michael Caine, and Rose Leslie, audiences enjoyed the fantasy tale. After leaving Peacock, it will still be available to rent on other digital platforms.




                  The 30 Best Movies On Peacock (January 2024)   Peacock has a wide variety of movies available to stream, with popular, award-winning, and genre-defining films in any genre a cinephile could want.   



 January 31 
         

  Air Force One (1997)   Along Came Spider (2001)   Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Something New (2023)   The Bank Job (2008)   Basic Instinct (1992)   Battleship (2012)   The Best Man Holiday (2013)   Billy Madison (1995)   Bringing Down the House (2003)   Casa de Mi Padre (2012)   The Cases of Mystery Lane (2023)   The Dilemma (2011)   The Dog Lover&#39;s Guide to Dating (2023)   Dr. Seuss&#39; The Cat in the Hat (2003)   Everest (2015)   Family History Mysteries: Buried Past (2023)   Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982)   Fight Club (1999)   Hell or High Water (2016)   Identity Thief (2013)   In Good Company (2004)   The Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost (2023)   Land of the Lost (2009)   Leatherheads (2010)   Little Rascals (1994)   Love in the Maldives (2023)   Madea&#39;s Family Reunion (2006)   Madea&#39;s Witness Protection (2012)   Mortal Kombat (1995)   Mortal Kombat (2021)   Oblivion (2013)   Ocean&#39;s 8 (2018)   Ocean&#39;s Eleven (2001)   Ocean&#39;s Thirteen (2007)   Ocean&#39;s Twelve (2004)   A Pinch of Portugal (2023)   The Proposal (2009)   Remember Sunday (2013)   Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011)   The Rundown (2003)   Sex Drive (2008)   Shrek Forever After (2010)   Sideways (2008)   Signed, Sealed, Delivered: Higher Ground (2017)   Sing (2016)   Sweet Home Alabama (2002)   Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)   True Grit (2010)   True Lies (1994)   Twilight (2008)   Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 (2011)   Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 (2012)   Twilight Saga: Eclipse (2010)   Twilight Saga: New Moon (2009)   Tyler Perry&#39;s A Madea Family Funeral (2019)   An Uncommon Grace (2017)   Wanted (2008)   Welcome to Valentine (2023)  




The end of the month marks the biggest removal of movies from Peacock for January. That’s perfectly reasonable since the first of the month is usually the biggest addition of library content for the streamer. Many of the movies leaving Peacock at the end of January, however, happen to be movies added on the first, giving subscribers only the month of January to watch them (until they return again).

Some of the movies only available for the month include The Twilight Saga, the Ocean’s Eleven quartet, the Mortal Kombat movies, the rom-com Sweet Home Alabama, and the Western True Grit. These particular movies, however, are very popular for streamers and tend to rotate between the major streaming services throughout the year, so they’ll likely be available somewhere new in February.

Also leaving Peacock in January are several Hallmark movies. Throughout December, Peacock welcomed (and said goodbye to) a Hallmark holiday movie almost every day. That’s not the case for January, but subscribers will see mysteries from Hallmark like Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Something New, Family History Mysteries: Buried Past, The Jane Mysteries: Inheritance Lost, and The Cases of Mystery Lane all leave the streamer. It’s very likely, however, that each of these movies is the start of a new batch of mysteries for Hallmark and might see new installments added later in the year. There are frequently more Hallmark movies added to Peacock.




All the movies leaving Peacock in January, of course, make room for the new additions that February will bring to the streamer.
