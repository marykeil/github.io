# The Equalizer 3 Continued The Franchise s Weirdest Denzel Washington Trend


## SUMMARY 



  In all three &#34;The Equalizer&#34; movies, Robert McCall ends up wet at the end, which is likely a deliberate detail by the creators.   The presence of water in the movie&#39;s endings could symbolize the coming of a storm or serve as a cleansing for McCall.   These watery endings add dramatic flair and potentially have deeper symbolic meanings in the context of the story and McCall&#39;s character.

## Literature Review

The Equalizer 3 came out nearly a decade after the first installment in the franchise, yet it maintained one especially strange Equalizer trend.




In 2023, The Equalizer 3 continued the story of former Marine and DIA agent, Robert McCall, but what was most interesting about this latest installment is the trend it kept up with at the end of the film. The Equalizer 3 is the third film in an action thriller film franchise that first began with The Equalizer in 2014. The movies star Denzel Washington as a retired government employee who returns to his violent work when he meets people that are suffering under the thumb of criminal organizations. In The Equalizer 3 specifically, McCall is living in southern Italy when he discovers that a local mob is harrassing innocent villagers.




Over the course of its three movies, The Equalizer franchise has proven that its films have many significant similarities between them. For example, the last two films in the franchise see Robert McCall leave his home in Boston and travel around the world, from Istanbul and Brussels to Italy. Furthermore, McCall is always facing off against international criminals, including established crime organizations and mercenary killers. However, there is one other similarity between The Equalizer films that is not nearly as obvious, but still remains one of the most consistent and strange trends to appear in the action films. 

                  The Equalizer 4: Confirmation Chances, Release Date Speculation &amp; Everything We Know   The Equalizer 4 would continue the franchise beyond the story of Robert McCall if Denzel Washington sticks to his plans - here&#39;s everything we know.   


 Denzel Washington Always Gets Wet At The End Of The Equalizer Movies 
          




A detail that always makes its way into The Equalizer movies is that Robert McCall ends the film wet. Notably, at the end of every The Equalizer movie, Robert McCall is in the midst of taking down the bad guy, and somehow, ends up wet. In The Equalizer, it happens when the sprinklers go off in the warehouse he is fighting in. In The Equalizer 2, McCall gets wet when a massive hurricane rolls in at the same time that he is taking out Dave York and his gang. And finally, at the end of The Equalizer 3, McCall get caught in some rain as he watches his enemy die.

Considering the fact that Robert McCall has ended up wet at the end of three The Equalizer movies, it is probably safe to say that this detail is not a coincidence. For one reason or another, the creators of The Equalizer franchise want their main character soaking wet at the end of each movie. On one hand, it could just be a cool effect to add dramatic flair to the final scenes of the film, but then again, the presence of water at the end of The Equalizer could also have a purposely symbolic meaning.






 What The Equalizer&#39;s Watery Endings Really Mean 
          

The Equalizer&#39;s watery endings could have a variety of different symbolic meanings. For one, it could be hinting at the proverbial &#34;coming of the storm.&#34; Just as Robert McCall is facing off with his enemies, a metaphorical (or literal in the case of The Equalizer 2) storm comes to show that he is truly in the thick of the action. Another avenue is that the presence of water is a sort of cleansing for McCall. As someone who continues trying to retire, the water could be symbolic of him being cleansed of any sins he committed in The Equalizer 3 or trying to be cleansed of his violent profession.
