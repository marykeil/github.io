# 10 Movie Sequels That Replaced The Original s Main Star &amp; Failed


## SUMMARY 


 Sequels that replace the original main star often fail due to audience wariness and a loss of the franchise&#39;s unique identity. 
 Movies like &#34;Grease 2&#34; and &#34;Mean Girls 2&#34; lacked the charm and quotability of their beloved originals and were considered failures. 
 Films such as &#34;Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective&#34; and &#34;Son of the Mask&#34; suffered from the absence of Jim Carrey&#39;s comedic skill and were financial and critical failures.

## Literature Review

Some sequels try to piggy back off the success of their previous entry, but can unfortunately fail as the original star does not return.




There are plenty of movie sequels that replaced their original main star and ended up completely failing. Unfortunately, when movie studios find themselves with a successful film or series, they can’t help but keep making sequels, even when the original main star needed to be replaced. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as the original star not wanting to do a sequel, a follow-up not making any sense with the original character, or many years having passed since the original film was released.
While there are lots of movie franchises that keep changing their casts, moving forward with a sequel without the main star can be a risky endeavor. Sometimes the original film was such a beloved release that, no matter what, audiences will be wary of any sequel and will be especially unlikely to enjoy it if their favorite character was no longer included. There are series like the series that are so deeply linked to the original star, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger in the Terminator, that finding success in a sequel without him was always doomed to failure. Despite movie sequels that replaced their original stars’ continual failure, they are consistently released to the dismay of viewers.









 








 10  Grease 2 (1982) 
A sequel to Grease (1978)
        

The original Grease was one of the most beloved musical movies of all time to the point that making a sequel would always be a bad idea, and making one without the original stars was an obvious disaster. Despite gaining somewhat of a cult following in later years, Grease 2 was essentially a repeat of the original with a worse cast, poorer songs, and less energy. Grease 2 was critically hated and failed to forge its own unique identity. However, it appeared the studios had not learned their lesson and the franchise was briefly revived once again by Paramount&#43; in 2023 with the short-lived prequel series Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies.





 9  Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective (2009) 
A sequel to Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995)
        

 Ace Ventura Jr: Pet Detective 


  Release Date    March 24, 2009     Director    David M. Evans     Cast    Josh Flitter , Emma Lockhart , Austin Rogers , Chris Adler , Robie Alan , Reed Alexander     Runtime    93 minutes    


As a prequel to the original Ace Ventura movies that did not involve Jim Carrey, Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective was doomed to fail from the very beginning. Ace Ventura Jr.: Pet Detective starred Josh Flitter as Ace’s son, and he sadly could never live up to the masterful and iconic performance previously done by Carrey. The existence of this sequel failed to recognize that the reason the Ace Ventura movies worked so well was because of Carrey’s performance and without him there was no franchise to begin with. The only way another Ace Ventura could ever work was in the unlikely event that Carrey returned to the part.





 8  Mean Girls 2 (2011) 
A sequel to Mean Girls (2004)
        

With Mean Girls due to make a return to the big screen in musical form in 2024, audiences would be forgiven for forgetting that the movie has already returned with a standalone sequel called Means Girls 2 in 2011. This low-budget teen comedy featured none of the original cast except for Tim Meadows as Principal Ron Duvall. A thinly veiled remake of the first film, Means Girls 2 has ranked among the worst sequels of all time, contained none of the original’s quotable charm, and followed a new group of lackluster plastics at North Shore High. Mean Girls 2 was a failure on all fronts.





 7  Evan Almighty (2007) 
A sequel to Bruce Almighty (2003)


 







Evan Almighty was a sequel nobody asked for. Following an unlikable minor character from the original Jim Carrey film Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty took the premise of God using his limitless power to teach individuals life lessons by having Evan, played by Steve Carrel, live out the biblical story of Noah’s Ark. Evan Almighty was a special effect spectacle that lacked the humor of the original and failed to recognize that it was the emotional human story at the center of Bruce Almighty that made that film work, and not its biblical associations.





 6  The Bourne Legacy (2012) 
A sequel to The Bourne Ultimatum (2007)


 







  The Bourne Legacy  


  Release Date    September 12, 2012     Director    Tony Gilroy     Cast    Jeremy Renner , Oscar Isaac , Rachel Weisz     Runtime    135 minutes    


While the third entry in the Bourne franchise, The Bourne Ultimatum, was intended as the final film in the series, Universal decided to move ahead with a fourth film where Matt Damon would not reprise his role as the titular Jason Bourne (via Variety.) Starring a new black ops agent called Aaron Cross, played by Jeremy Renner, The Bourne Legacy did well at the box office but failed to live up to its predecessors and felt like an unfortunate cash grab. Jason Bourne was an essential part of the Bourne series, and it appeared the studio realized that when Damon returned for the series’ fifth entry Jason Bourne in 2016.





 5  Kindergarten Cop 2 (2016) 
A sequel to Kindergarten Cop (1990)
        

The existence of Kindergarten Cop 2 starring Dolph Lundgren has all the qualities of a strange fever dream, until the slow realization that it actually exists in real life. Made more than 25 years after the original, Kindergarten Cop 2 once again featured a skilled special agent going undercover as a preschool teacher who ended up learning more from the kids than he could ever teach them. The main failure of Kindergarten Cop 2 was that Lundgren does not have the innate ability of his predecessor Arnold Schwarzenegger to walk the fine line between action and comedy, and the movie just never quite finds the right footing.





 4  Terminator Salvation (2009) 
A sequel to Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003)


 







  Terminator Salvation  


  Release Date    May 21, 2009     Director    McG     Cast    Sam Worthington , Moon Bloodgood , Christian Bale , Bryce Dallas Howard , Anton Yelchin     Runtime    115 minutes    


As the only film in the Terminator franchise that does not feature Arnold Schwarzenegger, although his likeness does appear digitally, Terminator Salvation was panned by critics and audiences who felt the series was not the same without Schwarzenegger. Despite faring well at the box office and making $371.4 million against a budget of $200 million (via Box Office Mojo), this Christian Bale sequel failed to act as a starting point for a soft reboot of the franchise. The Terminator series was instead rebooted once again in 2015 with Terminator Genisys, this time featuring Schwarzenegger.





 3  American Psycho 2 (2002) 
A sequel to American Psycho (2000)
        

As a little-known direct-to-video sequel, American Psycho 2 was denounced by the author of the original book, Bret Easton Ellis (via IGN), and the film’s star, Mila Kunis, said she was embarrassed to be a part of the film and pleased that a third entry in the series never be made (via MTV.) American Psycho 2 recasts Christian Bale’s character of Patrick Bateman in a minor role that would inspire Kunis’ character’s taste for murder. An unnecessary sequel that lacked all the depth and satire of the original, the film was a forgotten failure that was panned by audiences and critics.





 2  The Rage: Carrie 2 (1999) 
A sequel to Carrie (1976)
        

For some reason, 23 years after the release of the original Carrie movie, MGM decided it would be a good idea to release a sequel called The Rage: Carrie 2. The movie followed Emily Bergl as Rachel Yang, the younger sibling of Carrie, who also possessed telekinesis and was a box office bomb that earned just $17.8 million against a budget of $21 million (via Box Office Mojo.) While Bergl did give a committed performance, it could not save this film from failure. The Rage: Carrie 2 unfortunately retread much of the same material as the original without having anything new to say.





 1  Son Of The Mask (2005) 
A sequel to The Mask (1994)
        

Sadly, by the time Son of the Mask went into production, film studios had still not learned that sequels to Jim Carrey movies without the involvement of Carrey don’t work. Son of the Mask was a standalone sequel to The Mask and was sorely lacking the over-the-top comedic skill Carrey brought to the series. A financial failure, Son of the Mask grossed $59.9 million against its $84–100 million budget (via Box Office Mojo.) Son of the Mask was slated by critics and Roger Ebert named it among the worst movies of 2005 and criticized the movie’s lack of internal logic, overuse of special effects, and overall absurdity (via Roger Ebert.)
