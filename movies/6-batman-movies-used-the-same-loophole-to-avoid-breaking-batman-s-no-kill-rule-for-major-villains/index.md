# 6 Batman Movies Used The Same Loophole To Avoid Breaking Batman s No Kill Rule For Major Villains


## SUMMARY 



  Batman&#39;s no-kill rule has been prominent for years, but six major villains have died due to falling to their deaths in Batman movies.   Batman cleverly avoids direct responsibility for their deaths, as he only provides them with the opportunity to be killed.   Gravity has been a convenient loophole for Batman to dispatch his foes, absolving him of direct culpability.

## Literature Review

Batman has found a reliable way around his no-kill rule, using a clever workaround to dispatch some of his most iconic foes in six classic movies.




Batman has a famous no-kill rule, but six different movies have taken advantage of the exact same loophole to dispatch the Dark Knight&#39;s big-screen foes. As observed by SGNS Entertainment, several projects in Batman&#39;s timeline of movies bear one big and surprisingly striking similarity. It appears that any DC villains considering going up against the Caped Crusader may want to steer clear of heights.




Batman&#39;s no-kill rule has been a mainstay for decades, though he frequently finds ways around it. Ben Aflleck&#39;s Batman infamously killed swathes of criminals during his tenure, greatly contrasting against his predecessors, who had to find a clever workaround. The DCU reboot may reinstate Batman&#39;s no-kill rule, but it&#39;ll hopefully avoid doing so with the same well-established cliche as many previous films.

                  Which Live-Action Batman Has Killed The Most People?   After so many live-action Batmen, the question remains over which version of the character has broken the rule of no killing most frequently.   


 Batman Movies Have Killed 6 Major Villains With... Gravity 
         

Despite his no-kill rule, six major villains have died because of Batman or in his proximity by falling to their deaths. In most cases, these deaths were presented in a manner that effectively absolved the Dark Knight of responsibility. However, some do push this concept to its limit, with Batman&#39;s culpability pretty assured.




 Villain  Batman Movie   Joker  Batman (1989)   Penguin  Batman Returns   Two-Face  Batman Forever   Ra&#39;s Al-Ghul  Batman Begins   Two-Face  The Dark Knight   Talia Al-Ghul  The Dark Knight Rises   



The first instance saw Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman tether the Joker to a gargoyle while he tried to escape by helicopter, causing him to plunge to his death in 1989&#39;s Batman. In Batman Returns, Danny DeVito&#39;s Penguin is knocked back through a window by a swarm of bats and falls into the waters in the penguin exhibit in Gotham Zoo. Two-Face in Batman Forever was bamboozled by multiple copies of his infamous coin, causing him to lose his balance and fall to his death.




Ra&#39;s Al-Gul in Batman Begins was left to die on a Gotham City subway as it derailed and plummeted toward the street. The Dark Knight&#39;s Two-Face was tackled by Batman off the edge of a building. Most recently, Talia Al-Ghul in The Dark Knight Rises was in an armored vehicle that fell from an upper street, killing her shortly after impact.



 Batman Movies Cleverly Avoided His No Kill Rule 
          

Batman technically didn&#39;t kill any of these villains; he just provided them with the opportunity to be killed. For the Joker, Batman arguably was attempting to stop the Joker from escaping, but once he and the gargoyle were lifted into the air, his fate was sealed. In Batman Returns, Batman&#39;s intention in the Penguin&#39;s death was quite vague, as it was the swarm of bats that led the Penguin into the window, as the villain refused to relent.




Two-Face in Batman Forever was perhaps the most actively orchestrated by Batman: it was obviously pre-planned, and Batman made a deliberate decision to distract the villain in the precarious location. Ra&#39;s Al-Ghul was mostly a victim of circumstance, with Commissioner Gordon taking out a subway track support beam and Batman simply abandoning him on the railway as he hurtled towards the broken track. In The Dark Knight, however, Batman literally knocks Two-Face off a building. While this is more direct than Two-Face&#39;s previous demise, he was holding a child hostage, so this one is far more justified.

Talia Al-Ghul received a fate similar to her father&#39;s and is also a victim of circumstance rather than Batman&#39;s sneaky loophole. Bettered by gunfire from the Batwing, Talia simply lost control and crashed her vehicle. While not the most elegant of solutions to Batman&#39;s no-kill rule, using gravity as a handy way around the restriction has allowed the Dark Knight to dispatch some of his most dangerous foes.
