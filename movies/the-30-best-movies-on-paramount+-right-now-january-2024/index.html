  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Paramount+ is arguably better known for its original TV shows, but its movie selection shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked, with a great selection to choose from.</p>
<p>Someone looking for a new movie to watch can find plenty of classics, along with brand-new releases they may have missed in theaters. However, there&rsquo;s so much choice that it can be a little overwhelming for those uninitiated with the Paramount+ streaming platform. While it isn&rsquo;t the most prominent streaming service, Paramount+ is amassing a loyal following, and the best movies you can stream right now on Paramount+ showcase why.</p>
<p>The 30 Best TV Shows On Paramount+ (January 2024)
Paramount+ has come a long way from its humble beginnings as CBS All Access - as the stellar lineup of the 30 best shows on Paramount+ proves.</p>
<p>Best Comedy Movies On Paramount+
Jackass: The Movie (2002) The stunt-based slapstick antics of Johnny Knoxville, Steve-O, and the rest of the Jackass crew may feel like a relic in the age of social media when online pranksters are a dime-a-dozen, but the Jackass movies show why the band of daredevils that started it all are still the best. All of the Jackass movies are available to stream on Paramount+, including 2022&rsquo;s Jackass Forever, but 2002&rsquo;s Jackass: The Movie arguably remains the funniest of the bunch. While Jackass is an acquired taste as far as comedy goes, the pioneering attitude of the cast in a time when chasing likes and views wasn&rsquo;t a thing — combined with the reactions of an unaware public untainted by overexposure to public antics in the age of smartphones — make Jackass: The Movie just as hilarious over two decades after it hit theaters. Watch On Paramount+ Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off (1986)</p>
<p>Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off</p>
<p>Release Date    June 11, 1986     Director    John Hughes     Cast    jennifer grey , Matthew Broderick , Mia Sara , Alan Ruck , Jeffrey Jones     Runtime    103 minutes     Genres    Comedy</p>
<p>Widely considered one of John Hughes&rsquo; best movies, Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off is the movie that turned Matthew Broderick into a star. He plays the eponymous high school slacker, who skips school with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) and girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara), and together they have one of the most memorable, adventurous days of their lives.
Ferris Bueller&rsquo;s Day Off is way better than any movie about truancy has any right to be, and that has everything to do with the clever script, Broderick&rsquo;s charming performance, and the fact that the film is a pure celebration of what it means to have fun. While a case can be made that Ferris Bueller is a terrible friend, he&rsquo;s one of the cinema&rsquo;s most charismatic teenagers, and he makes great points about the importance of people taking time for themselves. Paramount+ is even developing a spin-off movie called Sam &amp; Victor&rsquo;s Day Off, centered on the valets who go joyriding in Cameron&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s car.

The Addams Family (1991)</p>
<p>The Addams Family (1991)</p>
<p>Release Date    November 22, 1991     Director    Barry Sonnenfeld     Cast    Anjelica Huston , Raul Julia , Christopher Lloyd , Christina Ricci , Jimmy Workman , Judith Malina , Carel Struycken , Christopher Hart , John Franklin     Runtime    99 Minutes     Genres    Comedy , Fantasy , Horror</p>
<p>Releasing in 1991, The Addams Family marks the big-screen debut of the creepy and kooky clan based on the cartoons by Charles Addams. The comedy sees the Addamses reconnect with family member Fester (Christopher Lloyd) after he had a falling out with his brother, the family patriarch Gomez Addams (Raul Julia). However, &ldquo;Fester&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t actually who he says he is, as he&rsquo;s actually a con artist behind an elaborate scheme to steal the Addams family&rsquo;s riches.
The Addams Family had a notoriously troubled production but was a box-office smash, likely thanks to the performances of its talented cast led by Julia, Lloyd, Anjelica Huston as Morticia, and a young Christina Ricci in a star-marking turn as Wednesday Addams. The film spawned another sequel, Addams Family Values (also available on Paramount+) and the Addams Family legacy didn&rsquo;t stop there, as Wednesday, starring Jenna Oretga as the titular anti-heroine, became a hit show for Netflix — and even features an appearance from Ricci.

Mean Girls (2004)</p>
<p>Mean Girls (2004)</p>
<p>Release Date    April 30, 2004     Director    Mark Waters     Cast    Amy Poehler , Lacey Chabert , Tina Fey , Rachel McAdams , Amanda Seyfried , Lindsay Lohan     Runtime    97 minutes     Genres    Comedy</p>
<p>Teen comedies are often looked down on, but Mean Girls bypassed &ldquo;so fetch&rdquo; and went straight to pop culture icon status. From the brilliant mind of Tina Fey, Mean Girls sees the homeschooled Cady Heron experience public high school for the first time. Beautiful and sweet, Cady is quickly snapped up by the most popular girls in school, the Plastics, only to be immediately betrayed by Queen Bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams in her breakout role). With the aid of a couple of misfits, Cady enacts her revenge and learns just what being a mean girl is.
The moviestands out for its hilariously exaggerated yet shockingly realistic portrayal of high school girl politics, and Mean Girls&rsquo; most iconic quotes — &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t even go here!&rdquo;, &ldquo;You go, Glen Coco!&rdquo;, etc. — are still spoken to this day. Thanks to its success, Mean Girls spawned a successful Broadway musical that itself is getting a movie adaptation in 2024. Until then, fans can tide themselves over streaming Mean Girls on Paramount+.

School Of Rock (2003)</p>
<p>School of Rock</p>
<p>Release Date    March 22, 2004     Director    Richard Linklater     Cast    Jack Black , Mike White , Miranda Cosgrove , Joan Cusack , Sarah Silverman     Runtime    109 minutes     Genres    Music , Comedy</p>
<p>School of Rock is far and away director Richard Linklater&rsquo;s most mainstream, successful movie, and the most essential film in Jack Black&rsquo;s biography. Black plays Dewey Finn, an aspiring guitar player who gets kicked out of his band and is strapped for cash. When he poses as a private school substitute teacher, Dewey discovers that the class he&rsquo;s teaching is comprised of musical geniuses so he recruits the kids to compete with him in Battle of the Bands.
The movie was a box office hit and spawned a television series and a popular Broadway musical adaptation. Dewey Finn is easily Black&rsquo;s best and funniest role, and School of Rock&rsquo;s message about the importance of rock music and following your dreams still strikes a chord 20 years later.

<p>New On Paramount: All 137 Movies &amp; TV Shows Arriving In January
Paramount+&rsquo;s movie and TV libraries are expanding in January 2024, and there are a number of new original documentaries, series, and films to watch.</p>
<p>Clueless (1995)</p>
<p>Clueless</p>
<p>Release Date    July 19, 1995     Director    Amy Heckerling     Cast    Alicia Silverstone , Stacey Dash , Brittany Murphy , Paul Rudd , Donald Faison , Elisa Donovan     Runtime    97 minutes     Genres    Comedy , Documentary , Romance</p>
<p>Jane Austen&rsquo;s classic 1815 novel Emma gets a thoroughly &rsquo;90s update with Clueless. The film made Alicia Silverstone a household name as she plays protagonist Cher Horowitz, a beautiful and privileged Beverly Hills teen who meddles in other people&rsquo;s lives while neglecting her own problems and character flaws.
While Cher may sound like a hard character to root for, her well-meaning intentions and Silverstone&rsquo;s cinematic charisma make her a worthy heroine to champion. Clueless rocked the pop culture landscape upon release, influencing fashion trends and making iconic quotes out of catchphrases like &ldquo;As if!&rdquo; And while the film is a staple of the &rsquo;90s, it&rsquo;s a totally fun one to watch in any decade.

South Park (Not Suitable For Children) (2023)</p>
<p>South Park</p>
<p>Release Date    August 13, 1997     Cast    Trey Parker , Matt Stone     Main Genre    Comedy     Franchise(s)    South Park</p>
<p>Raunchy and controversial comedy South Park has found its streaming home on Paramount+, and the partnership has come with multiple feature-length South Park TV movies. All are available to watch on Paramount+, but thanks to how current Matt Stone and Trey Parker keep the biting humor, South Park (Not Suitable For Children) is definitely the funniest to watch right now (although previous movie-length entries like Enter The Panderverse are also recommended for subscribers who enjoy South Park).
South Park (Not Suitable For Children) involves a plot that riffs on OnlyFans and social media influencers, containing as much satire as it does puerile humor. It also contains several incredible impressions of current celebrities like Logan Paul. As far as comedy movies on Paramount+ go, the South Park specials continue to be among the most hilarious available options.</p>
<p>Best Drama Movies On Paramount+
Gladiator (2000)</p>
<p>Gladiator</p>
<p>Release Date    May 1, 2000     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Russell Crowe , Derek Jacobi , Oliver Reed , Connie Nielsen , Joaquin Phoenix , Djimon Hounsou , Richard Harris     Runtime    155 minutes</p>
<p>Ridley Scott&rsquo;s historical epic Gladiator is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, so it&rsquo;s understandably also ranked as one of the best movies among Paramount+&rsquo;s extensive library. Set in Ancient Rome, Gladiator stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a fallen Roman soldier who becomes enslaved and forced to fight as a gladiator in the Colosseum. Crowe delivered a career-defining performance, as did Joaquin Phoenix as the vile Emperor Commodus. Gladiator set Oscars records with its success, and to this day remains more-or-less unrivaled when it comes to action-heavy historical dramas.

The Godfather (1972)</p>
<p>The Godfather</p>
<p>Release Date    March 24, 1972     Director    Francis Ford Coppola     Cast    Marlon Brando , Diane Keaton , James Caan , Al Pacino , Robert Duvall     Runtime    175 minutes</p>
<p>Few films have been as influential as 1972 crime drama The Godfather, and cinephiles looking for a cool movie to watch on Paramount+ right now need look no further. Marlon Brando&rsquo;s performance as the ruthless yet soft-spoken mafia kingpin Vito Corleone is one of the most quoted in cinema history, and Al Pacino&rsquo;s role as Michael Corleone launched his career. Directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather spawned two sequels — both of which are also on Paramount+ — and despite releasing over 50 years ago still holds up as one of the most gripping dramas ever made.

Titanic (1997)</p>
<p>Titanic</p>
<p>Release Date    December 19, 1997     Director    James Cameron     Cast    David Warner , Kathy Bates , Billy Zane , Bill Paxton , Bernard Hill , Kate Winslet , Leonardo DiCaprio , Gloria Stuart , Frances Fisher , Victor Garber     Runtime    3h 14m     Genres    Drama , Romance</p>
<p>James Cameron&rsquo;s epic romance film Titanic had a massive effect on Hollywood the moment it sailed into theaters in 1997. Making huge stars out of its lead actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, Titanic&rsquo;s story of the doomed ship parallels the doomed lovers who set sail upon it in 1912. They are, of course, the upper-class Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), engaged to be married to the villainous Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) a poor artist with big dreams. They meet aboard the ship and fall passionately in love, only for tragedy to strike. But while the ship sunk, the movie soared, with Titanic breaking myriad records.
Titanic was the first movie to gross over $1 billion and it also tied Ben-Hur for most Academy Awards wins with 11 out of 14 nominations, including Best Picture. It was a movie event for the ages and can still be watched and enjoyed on Paramount+.

<p>The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)</p>
<p>The Wolf of Wall Street</p>
<p>Release Date    December 25, 2013     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Margot Robbie , Leonardo DiCaprio , Jonah Hill , Kyle Chandler     Runtime    3hours     Genres    Comedy , Crime , Biography</p>
<p>With Killers of the Flower Moon shaping up to be a major awards contender for the 2023-2024 season, Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s collaborative partnership continues to thrive. And one of their best films together is The Wolf of Wall Street, based on Jordan Belfort&rsquo;s memoir of the same name. DiCaprio stars as Belfort, a notoriously unscrupulous penny stockbroker who takes Wall Street by storm.
Despite its three-hour runtime, The Wolf of Wall Street goes by like a fever dream of debauchery, excess, and corruption. It also features strong supporting performances from Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, and is widely considered Robbie&rsquo;s breakout Hollywood role. The Wolf of Wall Street may have gone home empty-handed at the Oscars but it cashed in on an everlasting legacy.

Selma (2014)</p>
<p>Selma</p>
<p>Release Date    December 25, 2014     Director    Ava DuVernay     Cast    Tim Roth , Carmen Ejogo , David Oyelowo , Tom Wilkinson     Runtime    128minutes     Genres    History , Drama , Biography</p>
<p>Ava DuVernay masterfully tells the story of one of the most important moments in American history with Selma. This is, of course, the 1965 march for equal voting rights from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo). Oyelowo delivers an impassioned performance as the legendary activist, and the racial injustice in the film is resonant and heartbreaking, as it is still sadly prevalent today.
Though John Legend&rsquo;s &ldquo;Glory&rdquo; took home Best Original Song at the Oscars, Selma was shockingly shut out of prominent categories, like Best Actor for Oyelowo and Best Director for DuVernay. But even without the awards it deserves, Selma is a powerful film and one of the best movies on Paramount+.

The Lost City (2022)</p>
<p>The Lost City</p>
<p>Release Date    March 25, 2022     Director    Adam Nee , Aaron Nee     Cast    Sandra Bullock , Channing Tatum , Brad Pitt , Danielle Radcliffe , Patti Harrison , Da&rsquo;Vine Joy Randolph     Runtime    112 Minutes     Genres    Action , Romance , Comedy</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to go wrong with a Sandra Bullock romance movie, and The Lost City is a rom-com made for rom-com lovers. Bullock plays Loretta, a bestselling romance author who gets kidnapped by a young megalomaniac billionaire (Daniel Radcliffe) and transported to an Atlantic island to find him the treasure she writes about in her novels. And when Loretta&rsquo;s dashing book cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) discovers she&rsquo;s missing, he makes it his mission to save her.
In an age where most rom-coms go straight to streaming services, the fact that this adventurous romp made its way to theaters is something special. The Lost City is a thrilling adventure from start to finish, bolstered by Bullock and Tatum&rsquo;s sweet yet electric chemistry.

My Fair Lady (1964)</p>
<p>My Fair Lady</p>
<p>Release Date    December 25, 1964     Director    George Cukor     Cast    Audrey Hepburn , Rex Harrison , Stanley Holloway , Gladys Cooper     Runtime    2hr50min</p>
<p>From Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s to Sabrina to Roman Holiday, nobody made movies quite like Audrey Hepburn, and in My Fair Lady, she delivers one of her winningest performances. My Fair Lady is a screen adaptation of the 1956 Lerner and Loewe stage musical of the same name, which itself is based on George Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s 1913 play, Pygmalion. It&rsquo;s about an uppity English professor named Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) who accepts a bet in which he must turn unsophisticated flower seller Eliza Dolittle (Hepburn) into a respectable woman of society.
My Fair Lady is classic Hollywood at its finest, and though Hepburn was shockingly snubbed for an Oscar nomination, the movie itself swept the ceremony, winning eight awards in total including Best Picture. Both Hepburn and Harrison prove why they were movie stars, and it&rsquo;s impossible not to get swept up in their effortless, charming chemistry.

Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s (1961)</p>
<p>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Release Date    October 6, 1961     Director    Blake Edwards     Cast    Audrey Hepburn , George Peppard , Patricia Neal , Buddy Ebsen , Martin Balsam , José Luis de Villalonga     Runtime    115minutes     Genres    Comedy , Documentary , Drama , Romance</p>
<p>Audrey Hepburn captured the timeless elegance of mid-century movies, and Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s is one of her most beloved films, both for her work and also for her instantly iconic costume design. It&rsquo;s a much happier spin on Truman Capote&rsquo;s 1958 novella of the same name. Where, in the original story, Holly Golighty&rsquo;s narrative read as a cautionary tale of little girls being lost in the big city, the movie version of Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s celebrates Holly&rsquo;s adventurous free spirit.
The story is a wholly implausible confection of comedy, romance, and coincidences, but Hepburn is never more charming than as the airy, captivating Holly. Perhaps the fact that it&rsquo;s such a sweet palate cleanser is why it&rsquo;s withstood the test of time whereas other romantic comedies have been forgotten.</p>

Arrival (2016)</p>
<p>Arrival</p>
<p>Release Date    November 10, 2016     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Michael Stuhlbarg , Forest Whitaker , Tzi Ma , Amy Adams , Mark O&rsquo;Brien , Jeremy Renner , Nathaly Thibault     Runtime    1h 56m     Genres    Sci-Fi , Documentary , Drama , Mystery , Thriller</p>
<p>While Dune is inarguably director Denis Villeneuve&rsquo;s greatest triumph, Arrival is his greatest film, and it&rsquo;s one of the hidden gems of the 2010s on Paramount+. Based on the short story &ldquo;Story of Your Life&rdquo; by Ted Chiang, there is truly no movie like Arrival, not just in the sci-fi genre, but in any genre. Rather than adopting the usual negative bent taken by so many sci-fi stories about aliens arriving on Earth, Arrival does the opposite, turning it into a beautiful narrative about connection, language, time, and loss.
The time-twisting, drama all leads to a haunting revelation that lingers indefinitely with the viewer. It&rsquo;s a movie that asks big questions about life and the universe, and, for the most part, does a brilliant job of answering them without being heavy-handed.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)</p>
<p>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</p>
<p>Release Date    July 3, 1991     Director    James Cameron     Cast    Arnold Schwarzenegger , Linda Hamilton , Robert Patrick , Edward Furlong     Runtime    137 Minutes     Genres    Action ,  Sci-Fi</p>
<p>The much-anticipated follow-up to 1984&rsquo;s The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day superseded expectations and is widely considered to be the best film in the sci-fi franchise. A young John Connor (Edward Furlong) is the key to humanity&rsquo;s survival, and he and his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) are on the run from T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a Terminator sent from the future to kill the boy, with T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) there to protect them.
The sequel made huge stars out of its lead actors, and its special effects are so impressive that they&rsquo;re just one of the things about Terminator 2 that still hold up today. The franchise has been chasing Terminator 2&rsquo;s success with increasingly diminishing returns, all the more proving that this is a classic piece of sci-fi cinema.

<p>Stardust (2007)</p>
<p>Release Date    August 10, 2007     Director    Matthew Vaughn     Cast    Claire Danes , Charlie Cox , Sienna Miller , Ricky Gervais , Jason Flemyng , Rupert Everett , Peter O&rsquo;Toole , Michelle Pfeiffer , Robert De Niro     Runtime    128 Minutes     Genres    Adventure , Comedy , Fantasy , Romance</p>
<p>Before he became Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, Charlie Cox played a young, humble village man in Stardust. Tristan is in a losing battle with the dashing Humphrey (Henry Cavill) to win his beloved Victoria&rsquo;s (Sienna Miller) hand in marriage. To prove himself worthy, Tristan journeys to a magical realm to retrieve a fallen star for her, only to discover that the star is actually a woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes).
Stardust is based on the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name, and it has all the author&rsquo;s humorous sensibilities. Add in scene-chewing performances by Michelle Pfieffer and Robert De Niro as a villainous witch and flamboyant pirate, respectively, and Stardust is the perfect for movie night. The visuals and story are as spellbinding as any Disney movie, and viewers won&rsquo;t want the adventures of Tristan and Yvaine to end.

<p>Best Action Movies On Paramount+
Face/Off (1997)</p>
<p>John Travolta and Nicolas Cage&rsquo;s Face/Off remains a quintessential 1990s action movie, and subscribers seeking some high-octane easy viewing on Paramount+ won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The premise of Face/Off alone is enough to pique the interest of many, as it focuses on a cop and the crime lord he manages to apprehend trading faces with pioneering transplant surgery. This leads to Travolta and Cage both effectively playing two characters, with both actors ensuring that Castor Troy went down as one of the best villains from action movies of the era.
Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark</p>
<p>Release Date    June 12, 1981     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Harrison Ford , Karen Allen , Alfred Molina , Paul Freeman , Ronald Lacey , John Rhys-Davies , Denholm Elliott     Runtime    115 Minutes     Genres    Adventure , Action</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to think of two filmmakers who have had a bigger effect on Hollywood and the blockbuster movie than Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, and their talents are on full display in the first Indiana Jones film, Raiders of the Lost Ark. Directed by Spielberg and based on a story by Lucas and Philip Kaufman, the movie introduces the whip-wielding, fedora-wearing archaeologist adventurer, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford).
Taking place in 1936, Raiders of the Lost Ark sees Jones on a globetrotting race against the Nazis to find the Ark of the Covenant, an artifact thought to make an army invincible. With its edge-of-your-seat thrilling action sequences, rousing John Williams score, and charismatic lead performance by Ford, it&rsquo;s easy to see why Raiders of the Ark led to a massive movie franchise. The first four Indiana Jones movies are available to stream on Paramount+, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is by far the best.

<p>The Mission: Impossible series is one of the rare action series that has just gotten better and better with each installment, but it&rsquo;s well worth revisiting the first movie that started it all almost 30 years ago. Brian De Palma&rsquo;s spy thriller doesn&rsquo;t rewrite the genre, but what it does do is make Tom Cruise a bona fide action star.
While Cruise had been in action movies prior to this one, it could be argued that Mission: Impossible&rsquo;s still-iconic scene of Ethan Hunt breaking into a high-security vault on a line is what solidified Cruise as a practical stunt junkie–stunts he&rsquo;s henceforth made sure he does himself. Since then, the Mission: Impossible movies have only gotten bigger and more eye-popping with the stunt work.

<p>Mission Impossible Movies Ranked - From The 1996 Original to Dead Reckoning Part 1
Mission: Impossible is one of the most consistent movie franchises out there, but we&rsquo;ve accepted the nearly-impossible task of ranking them.</p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem (2023)</p>
<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</p>
<p>Release Date    August 4, 2023     Director    Jeff Rowe     Cast    Nicolas Cantu , Micah Abbey , Shamon Brown Jr. , Brady Noon , Jackie Chan , Ayo Edebiri , Seth Rogen , John Cena     Runtime    100 Minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure</p>
<p>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven&rsquo;t had the most successful showing on the big screen, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem turns that all around in an uproariously fun way. From a team of writers that includes the hilarious Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, the animated movie sees the four Turtles (Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, and Brady Noon) and their friend April (Ayo Edebiri) looking to bring a crime syndicate to justice. However, they have to contend with a deadly mutant army that is sent after them.
Much like they did with Superbad, Rogen, Goldberg, and co. make Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem a great movie by centering it on coming-of-age themes like the desire to fit in and find acceptance. This makes the characters as relatable as they are charming and funny, and gives the movie heart along with some great action sequences. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is perfect for a family movie night, and there&rsquo;s more Turtles fun to come, as Paramount+ is also developing a follow-up TV series, Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Collateral (2004)</p>
<p>Collateral</p>
<p>Release Date    August 4, 2004     Director    Michael Mann     Cast    Tom Cruise , Jamie Foxx , Jada Pinkett Smith , Mark Ruffalo , Peter Berg , Bruce McGill     Runtime    120 minutes     Genres    Crime , Documentary , Drama , Thriller</p>
<p>Tom Cruise is one of Hollywood&rsquo;s biggest movie stars who has turned in iconic leading man performances like Ethan Hunt in the Mission: Impossible franchise and Maverick in the Top Gun movies. However, his villainous turn as hitman Vincent in Collateral that is truly one of his best roles. Filling the role of the hero in the Michael Mann-directed film is Jamie Foxx as Max Durocher, a cab driver who is forced to drive Vincent around as he completes his contract kills.
Mann is the master of the noir thriller, and Cruise and Foxx have electric, tension-fueled chemistry as they play off each other. Foxx was nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar for his performance, and Collateral delivers many thought-provoking questions along with its thrills.

<p>Best Horror Movies On Paramount+
A Quiet Place (2014)</p>
<p>A Quiet Place</p>
<p>Release Date    April 3, 2018     Director    John Krasinski     Cast    Emily Blunt , John Krasinski , Millie Simmonds , Noah Jupe , Cade Woodward , Leon Russom     Runtime    1h 30m</p>
<p>Directed by The Office star John Krasinski, who also leads the cast alongside Emily Blunt, A Quiet Place is one of the tensest horror movies of the last 10 years. The title reveals much about the premise, as A Quiet Place covers the aftermath of an invasion by bestial, yet blind, aliens who have an incredibly heightened sense of hearing. With a shocking and gut-wrenching death that still has viewers talking and some incredible directorial work from Krasinski, A Quiet Place (and its sequel, A Quiet Place Part II) are both must-watch horror movies and among the best films on Paramount+ right now in any genre.

The Exorcist (1973)</p>
<p>The Exorcist</p>
<p>Release Date    December 26, 1973     Director    William Friedkin     Cast    Max Von Sydow , Linda Blair , Lee J. Cobb , Ellen Burstyn , Jason Miller , Kitty Winn , Jack MacGowran     Runtime    122 minutes</p>
<p>Paramount+ notably excels when it comes to horror, and one of the scariest movies on the platform right now is 1973&rsquo;s The Exorcist. Widely considered one of the most chilling movies ever made, The Exorcist wrote the blueprint when it came not only to possession movies but supernatural horror in general.
Its influences can still be felt over fifty years since its release, and it&rsquo;s safe to say that the movie itself has stood the test of time and remains just as frightening now as it was in 1973. With plenty of iconic moments throughout and one of the best performances from a child actor courtesy of Linda Blair as Regan, The Exorcist is a safe bet for any horror fans among Paramount+ subscribers looking for a good movie.

Scream (1996)</p>
<p>Scream</p>
<p>Release Date    December 20, 1996     Director    Wes Craven     Cast    Jamie Kennedy , Skeet Ulrich , Drew Barrymore , Rose McGowan , Neve Campbell , David Arquette , Roger Jackson , Courteney Cox , matthew lillard     Runtime    111 minutes</p>
<p>The 1996 satirical slasher that kick-started the highly successful Scream franchise is one of the best horror movies subscribers can watch on Paramount+ right now. Directed by horror legend Wes Craven, Scream introduced both audiences and the fictional town of Woodsboro to the terrifying Ghostface Killer. From its early fakeout with star Drew Barrymore (then at the height of her career) to helping launch the careers of Matthew Lillard and Neve Prescott, among others, Scream ticked enough boxes to make it both a success when it released and a cult gem decades later.
The direct sequels Scream 2 and Scream 3 are also available on Paramount+ in January 2024. However, it&rsquo;s the 1996 original that remains the best of all the Scream movies. Not only did the original stand up as a tense slasher in its own right, but its satirical lambasting of the then-stale tropes of the genre in the mid-90s helped revitalize it. Scream set the blueprint for modern slasher movies, and it&rsquo;s not one to miss.
Hellraiser IV: Bloodline (1996)</p>
<p>Few horror movie franchises are as inconsistent as Hellraiser. While the best entries in the series are among some of the most inventive horror movies of all time, the worst are also counted in the genres biggest letdowns. As far as the Hellraiser sequels go, however, Hellraiser IV: Bloodline stands out as one of the strongest, and both it and every Hellraiser movie aside from 1, 2, and the 2022 reboot are currently available to stream on Paramount+.
Hellraiser 4 was directed by Kevin Yagher and sees Doug Bradley reprising his iconic role as Pinhead. Bloodline shows the creation of the Lament Configuration. It features heavy time-travel and sci-fi elements and has a bombastic plot to say the least. However, this also allows it to have some of the most innovative Cenobite designs of the franchise, and its weirdness perfectly encapsulates what many fans of the franchise love about Hellraiser.
Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998)</p>
<p>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later</p>
<p>Release Date    August 5, 1998     Director    Steve Miner     Cast    Jamie Lee Curtis , Adam Arkin , Michelle Williams , Adam Hann-Byrd , Jodi Lyn O&rsquo;Keefe , Janet Leigh , Josh Hartnett , LL Cool J , Joseph Gordon-Levitt     Runtime    85 Minutes</p>
<p>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later is the 7th installment in the Halloween franchise. While it received mixed reviews from critics and perhaps doesn&rsquo;t live up to the original, it still stands out as one of the best Halloween sequels. Whether Paramount+ subscribers are fans of Michael Myers or simply looking for a solid and enjoying slasher-horror, Halloween H20 doesn&rsquo;t disappoint.
The plot once again sees Michael making life a living nightmare for Laurie Strode, played by the inimitable Jamie Lee Curtis. This Halloween sequel is set 20 years after the original and gave audiences their first experience with an adult Laurie — who by now, of course, is a staple of more recent Halloween movies such as David Gordon Green&rsquo;s trilogy.
Event Horizon (1997)</p>
<p>Event Horizon</p>
<p>Release Date    August 15, 1997     Director    Paul W.S. Anderson     Cast    Jason Isaacs , Kathleen Quinlan , Sean Pertwee , Laurence Fishburne , Richard T. Jones , Joely Richardson , Sam Neill     Rating    R     Runtime    96 minutes</p>
<p>Event Horizon has gained a reputation as a cult gem thanks to its absolutely harrowing practical effects and a story that masterfully blends cosmic and body horror. Starring Sam Neill, Laurence Fishburne, and Kathleen Quinlan, the 1997 sci-fi horror helped cement director Paul W.S. Anderson&rsquo;s name as a heavyweight in the genre. The story of Event Horizon focuses on the crew of an interplanetary rescue ship seeking out the distress beacon of a long-lost exploratory vehicle - the titular Event Horizon.
What the crew discovers pushes the limits of their sanity and has lethal consequences, thanks in no small part to an experimental engine that folds the fabric of space-time and inadvertently opens a portal to a nightmarish dimension outside reality. While it wasn&rsquo;t a critical success on release, strong home video sales and decades of discussion by fans of both the movie and the wider cosmic horror genre online have ensured Event Horizon maintained a dedicated following.
The Crow (1994)</p>
<p>The Crow</p>
<p>Release Date    May 13, 1994     Director    Alex Proyas     Cast    Brandon Lee , Ernie Hudson , Michael Wincott , Rochelle Davis , Bai Ling , Sofia Shinas , Anna Levine , David Patrick Kelly     Runtime    102 Minutes     Genres    Action , Drama , Supernatural</p>
<p>As the saying goes, they don&rsquo;t make them like The Crow anymore – literally and figuratively. Alex Proyas&rsquo; comic book adaptation kickstarted the era of dark, gothic-tinged supernatural action movies with dark rock soundtracks to match. While already a sleeper hit at the box office at the time of its release, The Crow has still gained a cult classic status for the fervency of its following and almost mythical status among fans of genre movies. It&rsquo;s a mythologized status that was, in part, cemented by the tragic and untimely death of Brandon Lee, son of Bruce Lee, during the filming of the movie.
Lee&rsquo;s breakout role and final film is a tantalizing glimpse of what might have been, with the late actor&rsquo;s powerful on-screen presence undeniable in the role. The Crow is a genuinely great &rsquo;90s action movie, with slick, stylish action and a dark tone that sets it well apart from the over-the-top testosterone-driven, musclebound action movies of the era.
