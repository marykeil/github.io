# Ghostbusters Frozen Empire Can t Repeat The Franchise s Biggest Mistake For 1 Returning Character


## SUMMARY 



  Winston Zeddemore has consistently been overlooked in the Ghostbusters franchise despite being one of the four original Ghostbusters.   Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire should give Winston a more substantial and pivotal role, especially considering his history in the film series.   The promotional material for the film suggests that Winston may not have a significant part in the story.

## Literature Review

The upcoming Ghostbusters movie, Frozen Empire, has the opportunity to remedy a repeated failure from the previous films in the franchise.




Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will feature the return of multiple legendary characters, including one who has consistently been overlooked in the franchise. The upcoming fifth Ghostbusters film is directed by Gil Kenan, written by Kenan and Jason Reitman, and serves as a direct sequel to the 2021 movie (and the fourth installment in the series), Ghostbusters: Afterlife, which focused on the late Egon Spengler&#39;s family. The story will revolve around a new villain, the Death Chill, terrorizing the streets of New York City, meaning that the film brings the characters (new and old) back to where it all started — the iconic firehouse.




The cast of Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire includes Carrie Coon as Callie Spengler, Paul Rudd as Gary Grooberson, Finn Wolfhard as Trevor Spengler, Mckenna Grace as Phoebe Spengler, Celeste O&#39;Connor as Lucky Domingo, Logan Kim as Podcast, Patton Oswalt as Hubert, Kumail Nanjiani, James Acaster and Emily Alyn Lind. Additionally, a handful of characters from the original movies will return for the 2024 supernatural comedy film — Bill Murray as Peter Venkman, Dan Aykroyd as Ray Stantz, Ernie Hudson as Winston Zeddemore, Annie Potts as Janine Melnitz, and William Atherton as Walter Peck. However, unlike past movies, Frozen Empire must remedy a constant mistake regarding the importance of a Ghostbuster.


 Winston Deserves A Major Role In Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire 
          

Time and time again, Ernie Hudson&#39;s Winston Zeddemore has been pushed to the side in favor of the other three original members (Peter Venkman, Ray Stantz, and Egon Spengler) in the Ghostbusters movies. Even though he plays one of the iconic four Ghostbusters, Hudson has constantly been reduced to a supporting role or cameo in the franchise, and it is time for that to change, starting with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. After all, Winston is the one who most deserves a pivotal role in the story out of all the returning characters, given his history in the film series.




Hudson, Bill Murray, and Dan Aykroyd reprised their roles in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, but they were not the movie&#39;s stars. It seems like that will change in the upcoming installment, and Afterlife&#39;s ending suggests that Winston could (and should) have a bigger role in the sequel. During the fourth film&#39;s final moments, Winston is seen returning the Ecto-1 to the firehouse in New York, and afterward, a light on the Ecto-Containment Unit begins flashing red in the basement. Hopefully, this scene was meant to set up Winston for a more substantial role in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire.

                  Ghostbusters Finally Introduces A New, Original Villain In 2024&#39;s Frozen Empire   The first teaser trailer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire reveals the main villain for the upcoming movie. Read on to learn about the antagonist.

Unfortunately, the promotion material for the fifth Ghostbusters movie implies that Winston won&#39;t play a significant part in the story. Hudson&#39;s character only appears in one brief shot in the trailer, while Aykroyd&#39;s Ray has an entire speaking part explaining the villain. Perhaps this is a red herring, and Winston will be included in the main story instead of just showing up during big fight scenes. However, fans will have to wait until Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire to learn if the film finally pays homage to the most overlooked character in the franchise.



Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is set to be released in theaters on March 29, 2024.
