## Literature Review

A new blockbuster romantic comedy breaks a box office record for the 2023 holiday season as it completes its third weekend in theaters.




Anyone But You has broken a record for a 2023 holiday release. The new romantic comedy, which is inspired by William Shakespeare&#39;s Much Ado About Nothing and opened the weekend before Christmas, stars Top Gun: Maverick&#39;s Glen Powell and Euphoria&#39;s Sydney Sweeney as Bea and Ben, who hate each other after a first date gone wrong. However, when they pretend to be a couple in order to make being stuck together at an Australian destination wedding more tolerable, the ice between them begins to thaw.




Per Deadline, the Anyone But You release is projected to close out its third weekend at the domestic box office with a gross of $9.45 million, bringing its cumulative domestic total to $43.66 million. This 3-day total shows a week-on-week improvement of 8% and could climb as high as 20% by the end of the weekend. This news comes after the movie&#39;s New Year&#39;s weekend total improved by 45.9%, making it the only one of the eight major 2023 holiday season wide releases to increase its week-on-week total for two consecutive weekends.


 How Much Can Anyone But You Grow? 
          

So far, the R-rated Anyone But You has been consistently trailing behind some of the other wide releases from the holiday season, many of which are more family-oriented. This includes the smash hit Wonka, which opened the weekend before and has become the 14th highest-grossing movie of 2023 worldwide. Below, check out how Anyone But You&#39;s projected domestic total compares with the current projections for each of the other holiday releases this weekend:




 Title  Projected Domestic Total for Jan 7, 2024   Wonka  $165.7 million   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom  $99.8 million   Migration  $78 million   The Iron Claw  $23.9 million   The Color Purple  $54.2 million   The Boys in the Boat  $34 million   Ferrari  $16 million   Anyone But You  $43.66 million   



The Much Ado About Nothing remake is roughly in the middle of the pack at the time of writing. However, if it continues to show this kind of consistent week-on-week growth, it could become a bona fide word-of-mouth hit. While it&#39;s unlikely to reach the whopping total of a blockbuster superhero movie, even one that&#39;s underperforming like Aquaman 2, it could very well find itself outgrossing The Color Purple by the end of their respective runs.




Even if it stays in the same position on the chart, Anyone But You is already fast approaching the $50 million milestone worldwide. That could very well be the break-even point for the $25 million movie, and if it continues at this pace it could turn out some serious profits. It remains to be seen exactly how high it can climb before it leaves theaters, but it could have a bright future ahead of it as 2024 progresses.
