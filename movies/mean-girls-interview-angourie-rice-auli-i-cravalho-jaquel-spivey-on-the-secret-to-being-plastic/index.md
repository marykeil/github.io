Summary

  Mean Girls (2024) is the third adaptation of the Tina Fey-penned story based on the book Queen Bees and Wannabes.   The movie incorporates songs from the successful Broadway adaptation and is directed by Samantha Jayne &amp; Arturo Perez Jr.   The cast includes Angourie Rice as Cady Heron and Reneé Rapp as Regina George, along with Auli&#39;i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey, Avantika, and Bebe Wood.  





Arriving in theaters on January 12, Mean Girls (2024) is the third rendition of the story penned by Tina Fey. Based on Rosaline Wiseman&#39;s 2002 book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the original movie became a pop culture sensation that is still referenced to this day. In 2016, Fey wrote the book for a successful Broadway adaptation, with music by Jeff Richmond and lyrics by Nell Benjamin (Legally Blonde). The new movie incorporates several of the stage production&#39;s songs and is directed by Samantha Jayne &amp; Arturo Perez Jr.




Mean Girls (2024) still focuses on Cady Heron, a teenage girl who was homeschooled in Kenya before moving back to the U.S. with her mother. Upon entering public high school, she quickly discovers how the various cliques move like animals in the wild — but finds refuge in her friendship with Janis (Auli&#39;i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey). When they convince her to spy on the school&#39;s Plastics, however, Cady finds herself losing sight of her kindhearted nature. Reneé Rapp also stars as Regina George, a role she previously played on Broadway, while Avantika and Bebe Wood are Karen Shetty and Gretchen Wieners respectively.

                  Mean Girls 2024 - Release Date, Cast, Trailer &amp; Everything We Know   Tina Fey is bringing Broadway to the big screen in the Mean Girls (2024), and there&#39;s already much to discuss before the movie releases.   

Screen Rant interviewed Angourie Rice, Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey about putting their own spin on the classic Mean Girls, highlighting Janis&#39; sexuality in the story, and bringing Broadway energy to the big screen.





 Angourie Rice, Auli&#39;i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey Talks Mean Girls (2024) 
         

Screen Rant: Angourie, I think you did a great job of slipping into the plastic for some of them. Can you tell me what is in your secret sauce of making a nice girl mean?


Angourie Rice: Ooh, what&#39;s in the secret sauce? The secret ingredient is very boring. It&#39;s taking notes, actually. I think that is truly the secret for me is reading the script multiple times, taking notes, and charting.
I wrote in the script at what points she changes slightly, when she tells her first lie, when she tells her second lie, when she tells the lie that gets her in trouble, those sorts of key moments. So yeah, I guess the secret sauce is, “Do your homework,” which not everyone wants to hear that. It&#39;s kind of boring.


Auli&#39;l, you really stand out in your Janis. I love how unique she is, and I read that you had a say in her aesthetic; her styling and her look. Can you talk about bringing that aspect of her to life and what you wanted to say with that?





Auli&#39;l Cravalho: Yeah, yeah. Previously, in our &#39;04 version, lesbian for Janis was used kind of as a slur, and we&#39;re taking that back. Absolutely not. I am a pyro-les, loud and proud. I will light your backpack on fire if you talk shit about me. Fine. Tina also allowed us to have our own agency over these characters, and we certainly pay homage to our OG &#39;04, but we also have a musical element. What I love about that is that we get to get deeper into the mindset of our characters through the music itself. I&#39;d Rather Be Me also breaks the fourth wall. I&#39;m looking directly down the barrel and I&#39;m talking to you.
If your best friend has ever screwed you over, here&#39;s what you should do. Not care. Right? Because the only person that matters at the end of the day is you. And I learned a lot from her as well as in her aesthetic. So I put on my own eyeliner every single day. It helped me get into character. And then for the clothing, I drew in my pants. I cut up shirts. They just encouraged me to be like, yeah, whatever you want to do, just hopefully it&#39;ll look good. Yeah.
Angourie Rice: And it did look good. It looked amazing.





Jaquel, the energy that you bring to Damian is worthy of the Broadway star that you are, but how do you tamp that down for the screen? This is your first on-screen role, right? What&#39;s that transition like?


Jaquel Spivey: Well, when you have all these vets of the screen that you have to work with, I think you pick things up really quickly and just seeing how they come into the space as such professionals but willing to play. I think I was able to take little things from them and use them.
And also, just realizing that it&#39;s its own world, so we&#39;re actually having a conversation. We&#39;re actually communicating. It doesn&#39;t need to be for 1500 people. It could be for Angourie right next to me. It could be for Janis. It could be for anybody. We are just having a conversation. So that&#39;s my biggest takeaway, and they taught me that. I&#39;ll give them that. These are my teachers over here.
Angourie Rice: Your instincts are so good. Yeah. Jaquel&#39;s instincts were so good, and I think instincts for storytelling; you can&#39;t teach that. That comes from within you. You know who your audience is. You know who you&#39;re performing to. It was just a joy to watch you work, truly.







 About Mean Girls 
          

From the comedic mind of Tina Fey comes a new twist on the modern classic Mean Girls. New student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice) is welcomed into the top of the social food chain by the elite group of popular girls called “The Plastics,” ruled by conniving queen bee Regina George (Reneé Rapp) and her minions Gretchen (Bebe Wood) and Karen (Avantika). However, when Cady makes the major misstep of falling for Regina’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Samuels (Christopher Briney), she finds herself in Regina’s crosshairs. As Cady sets out to take down the group’s apex predator with the help of her outcast friends Janis (Auli’i Cravalho) and Damian (Jaquel Spivey), she must learn how to stay true to herself while navigating the most cutthroat jungle of all: high school.
