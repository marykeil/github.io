Warning: This article contains spoilers for About Fate.




Amazon Prime Video&#39;s New Year&#39;s rom-com About Fate tells a cute and zany love story with an ambiguous ending that keeps the audience guessing until the very last minute. The story starts with Griffin (Thomas Mann) planning to propose to his girlfriend, Clementine (Madelaine Petsch), on New Year&#39;s Eve, and Margot (Emma Roberts) expects her boyfriend, Kip (Lewis Tann), to propose that day. Both proposals go sideways, at which point the two run into each other for the first time. They part ways quickly, at which point Griffin gets drunk with his buddies, and Margot complains to her best friend, Dana (Fikile Mthwalo) about Kip.

Margot panics because she has plans to take her boyfriend to her sister&#39;s wedding. Dana suggests that she ask a stranger. When she returns home, she finds Griffin in her bed because he mistakenly thought it was his apartment. After freaking out and calling 911, Margot calms down and realizes that she can ask Griffin to the wedding. Even though he has plans to propose again to Clementine that night, he agrees to be her date at the wedding, pretending to be her ex, Kip. About Fate puts in motion a ridiculously funny love story filled with misadventures and an ambiguous ending.

 What Happens To Margot And Griffin In About Fate 
          

The ending of About Fate misleads the audience into thinking Margot and Griffin won’t end up together. After Clementine emotionally manipulates Margot, the heroine runs out of the house, breaking things off with Griffin when he follows her outside. When asked why, she says that she can’t ruin things for him like she does for everyone else. This sad statement is the first signal that things won’t end well for the pair. This type of scene which would usually take place about three-fourths of the way through a rom-com occurs only six minutes before the credits roll. This seems bleak for the couple.




Luckily, About Fate gets the couple back together in the last minute of the film before the credits. Both Margot and Griffin go to brunch with their families at the same restaurant. Griffin realizes this when he sees the wedding party and looks down at her coat. He turns around to see Margot, at which point they kiss and hug. The movie cuts to the credits at this point, implying that the pair end up in a romantic relationship.



 The Significance Of The Couple In The Carriage’s Story 
         

The couple in the carriage, Hazel and Charlie, in About Fate initially just seem like kind old people who are in love. However, the movie really pushes the fact that these two couples are connected by having them mirror each other’s expressions and body language throughout the carriage scene. What’s more, the elderly lady even gives Margot her carnation pink coat.




This is all important because the couple’s love story provides the framework for Margot and Griffin’s romance and foreshadowing of what happens after the movie ends. Charlie first saw Hazel on the ferry, but she disappeared when he ran after her. This matches up with Margot and Griffin’s first encounter, where they meet outside Bennigan’s. They speak for only a minute, but he loses her when she gets into an Uber.

Hazel and Charlie later met for a second time when they went to the same movie. Afterward, he followed her out to the lobby and asked her on a date. She turned him down, so he asked for her number. Hazel declined, leaving him without giving him a way to contact her. This parallels Margot and Griffin’s encounter after the wedding, where the pair meet at Griffin’s apartment. When she leaves, he follows her outside to ask her to stay. She rejects him due to her fears, leaving without giving Griffin any way of contacting her.

Then, they met a third time at the Stardust Diner when Charlie saw the carnation pink coat, turned around, and Hazel was there. Two months later, they eloped and stayed married for fifty-eight years. This is almost identical to Margot and Griffin’s final meeting at the very end of About Fate. Griffin sees the carnation pink coat that Hazel gave to Margot. When he turns around, she’s there. Because of the two stories’ correlation, it’s reasonable to assume that Margot and Griffin will get married within months of About Fate’s ending and stay married for decades.



 Why is Griffin’s Name Important To Margot? 
          

One of the biggest questions throughout About Fate is Margot’s connection to Griffin’s name. The way Margot reacts to his name when she first hears it makes it clear that it means something to her, but she doesn’t explain. Later, she asks Margot if she told Griffin when hearing his name. The mystery is finally solved after the wedding when Margot goes to his apartment. When Margot was in college, she got a tattoo of a griffin on her shoulder. This significance of Griffin’s name implies that fate was pushing the pair together long before they even met.






 Why Does Margot Need Griffin’s Help? 
          

Margot begs Griffin to go to the wedding with her after their second chance encounter in About Fate. The reason initially appears to be that she doesn’t want her family to be right about Kip breaking up with her. It becomes abundantly clear later on that Margot needs Griffin’s help because of her negative relationship with her sister, Carrie (Britt Robertson). Carrie views Margot as a screw-up who constantly ruins everything. Their mom doesn’t ever seem to defend Margot, enabling her sister’s hostility. The real reason Margot needs Griffin to be her date is so Carrie won’t blame her for ruining the wedding.

 Margot And Griffin’s Meet Cute Explained 
          

About Fate uses tricky cinematography and dialogue to make the audience believe that Margot and Griffin are together at the start of the film. It’s revealed about 13 minutes into the film that they are both in relationships with other people but having dinner at the same Bennigan’s. When Margot’s boyfriend, Kip, breaks up with her, she goes outside. When Clementine gets upset about Griffin’s proposal, she storms out and takes Margot’s Uber, and Griffin follows her. Margot and Griffin only briefly speak to each other. The more important meet cute occurs later, though, after he gets drunk with his friends.

Griffin’s car takes him to Margot’s apartment instead of his since they have the same apartment and street number. He enters the home with her spare key, placed in the same location as his key. He pets her cat, who looks almost identical to his. He uses the shower and goes to bed, both of which are in the same place as his. These things are important for two reasons. Firstly, it facilitates their second meeting. Margot comes home to find him in her bed, which sets the plot in motion. Secondly, it’s presented as fate pushing them together, furthered later with the Breakfast at Tiffany’s and the griffin tattoo.

 The Real Meaning Of About Fate’s Ending 
          

This film uses determinism as its foundation, and the ending furthers the idea. By getting Margot and Griffin together in the last moments, About Fate&#39;s writer Tiffany Paulsen tells audiences to keep their hopes up that love will find a way if it is right. No matter how many roadblocks they put up, Margot and Griffin just keep getting thrown back together. Based on the events of About Fate, they would&#39;ve kept getting thrown back together until they accepted that fate wanted them to be together.
