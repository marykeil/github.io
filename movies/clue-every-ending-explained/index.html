  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The 1985 movie Clue has three wildly different endings, each of them making sense in their own way. Clue is a light-hearted murder mystery comedy and whodunits that was adapted from the popular board game of the same name. With an ensemble cast including Madeline Kahn, Tim Curry, Christopher Lloyd, Martin Mull, and Eileen Brennan, Clue introduces viewers to familiar characters such as Mr. Green, Ms. Scarlet, and Colonel Mustard early in its fast-paced runtime. This group of suspicious characters is assembled by Tim Curry’s butler, Wadsworth, working on behalf of his employer, Mr. Boddy.</p>
<p>Before long, Wadsworth reveals that Mr. Boddy is blackmailing everyone at the tense dinner party, himself included. The lights go out, Mr. Boddy is killed, and the rest of the movie is spent working out the identity of Clue’s killer. However, this is easier said than done. Although Clue went on to influence other comedic whodunits like the Knives Out movies, the identity of the movie’s murderer is almost impossible for casual viewers to guess. This is because, in an audacious meta-twist, Clue has three different endings, and each reveals a different killer — or multiple killers.</p>
<p>Ms. Scarlet Did It In “How It Might Have Happened” - Clue’s First Ending
Also Known As Ending A</p>
<p>In the first ending of Clue, the vampy madam Ms. Scarlet is revealed to be the killer by the hyperactive Wadsworth, who unspools her entire ambitious collaboration with Yvette the maid in front of the stunned, bemused guests. Ms. Scarlet got Yvette to kill Mr. Boddy and the Chef, then she killed Yvette, the Motorist, the Cop, and the Singing Telegram Girl herself. Ms. Scarlet threatens to shoot Wadsworth for revealing this, but he points out that she is out of bullets. Before she can test this theory, the police burst forth and arrest her. Wadsworth turns out to be an undercover FBI agent.</p>
<p>In this version of Clue&rsquo;s ending, the gun goes off and just about misses Colonel Mustard. The movie ends in a freeze-frame as the chandelier falls to the floor behind him. The evangelist who knocked on the door earlier returns and reveals himself to be the head of the police, a twist that is shared by all three of the movie’s endings. During Clue’s original theatrical run, a third of the movie’s viewers saw this ending due to the distributor’s unusual publicity gambit. However, for home video releases and on streaming platforms, this was just the first of the movie’s three endings.</p>

<p>Ms. Peacock Is The Killer In &ldquo;How About This?” - Clue’s Second Ending
Also Known As Ending B</p>
<p>In Clue’s second ending, Ms. Peacock is revealed to be the killer. She murdered the victims to ensure that they wouldn’t be able to reveal her shameful secret: she accepted bribes from foreign politicians as part of her husband’s diplomatic work. Since Peacock is one of the smartest characters in Clue, she ends up outsmarting Wadsworth and the rest of the guests. With them at gunpoint, she makes it as far as the front door before the evangelist once again saves the day. As Peacock is arrested, Wadsworth once again reveals that he is secretly working for the FBI before offering fruit or dessert to the guests.</p>
<p>Everyone Is Guilty In &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s What Really Happened” - Clue’s Third Ending
Also Known As Ending C</p>
<p>In Clue’s third ending, the guilt is a little more evenly distributed. In this version of events, Professor Plum shot at Boddy but missed. Boddy played dead to avoid getting shot again while Ms. Peacock killed the Chef. Meanwhile, Plum killed Boddy for good and Mustard killed the Motorist because he recognized that he was his driver during the war and could therefore expose him as a war profiteer. This unlikely moment of dark war movie satire is quickly supplanted by the revelation that Ms. White strangled Yvette, as it turns out that the maid had stolen her husband — whom Ms. White also killed.</p>
<p>Ms. Scarlet was the one who killed the cop. Wadsworth shot the singing telegram woman. That one seems to make no sense until Green surmises that it was because Wadsworth was really Mr. Boddy all along. The man that the guests thought was Boddy was actually the butler, meaning Wadsworth/Boddy can now continue to blackmail the guests since he is the one holding the gun. That is, until Green shoots him with his own gun, prompting a sporting Boddy to commend his marksmanship. Green reveals that this time, he is the FBI agent as the police once again arrive.</p>
<p>Wadsworth Dies In Clue’s Final Ending
Mr. Green Did It In The Hall With The Revolver</p>
<p>Wadsworth is shot in Clue’s final ending, killing him. He survives in the other two endings, but he is also a more heroic character in both of them. While Knives Out and many movies like it give viewers a lone detective to root for, Clue constantly changes its hero. In two of the movie’s endings, Wadsworth is the one who reveals the killer with a lengthy, breathless speech that parodies the theatrical revelations preferred by Agatha Christie’s Poirot. However, in the final ending, Wadsworth’s speech is revealed to be coming from the perspective of a gloating villain until he is abruptly shot.</p>
<p>Why Clue Has Three Endings
The Meaning Of The Gimmick</p>
<p>Since Clue was adapted from a board game, the filmmakers opted to release the movie with three separate endings so that viewers could experience the movie like a real-life game of Clue. This publicity stunt annoyed some reviewers, but decades later, it is arguably the movie’s most ambitious and memorable gag. The movie’s novelizations even feature a fourth ending that contradicts the other three, with Wadsworth again acting as the villain this time. That ending was filmed but not used because director Jonathan Lynn was not a fan of it. This jettisoned ending saw Wadsworth unveiled as the killer, only for him to reveal he also poisoned all the guests.</p>

<p>Clue proved that movies based on popular games and toys could capture the tone of their source material faithfully. For the most part, it&rsquo;s a goofy whodunit where all the characters are trying to play detective and solve the case, as is the case in a good real-life game of Clue. The over-the-top characters keep proceedings fast-paced and funny, but the various endings prove that there is a cleverly constructed murder mystery at the core of the story. Thus, Clue’s numerous endings are pivotal to the movie’s success as an adaptation.</p>
