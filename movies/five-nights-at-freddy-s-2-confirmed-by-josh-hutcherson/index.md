Summary

  Josh Hutcherson confirms that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is in the works, revealing that they&#39;re currently in the process of &#34;nailing down the story&#34;.   Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is Blumhouse&#39;s highest-grossing movie of all time, despite earning mostly negative reviews from critics.   The ending to the first film means a number of story directions are on the table, but it&#39;s currently unclear which characters and settings could be returning.  







Star Josh Hutcherson confirms that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is moving forward. Based on the popular video game franchise of the same name, director Emma Tammi&#39;s Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s was released last year, quickly becoming Blumhouse&#39;s highest-grossing movie ever at the box office despite mostly negative reviews. Despite the film&#39;s success, however, Blumhouse has not yet officially given a sequel the green light.

Now, during a recent interview with Variety, Hutcherson confirms that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is happening. While the actor doesn&#39;t share any story details (and Blumhouse has not yet released a statement), he does provide a promising update on the script and the sequel&#39;s expected production timeline. Check out Hutcherson&#39;s full comment below:


“I know they’re in the process right now of nailing down the story, and they want to get going as soon as possible. Obviously, the fans are amazing and die hard. For me to be a part of it was so cool and phenomenal.
“We hoped it would connect with audiences. But I don’t think that anybody, even on our side of things, expected it to really connect the way that it did. I’m dying to get back on set. Emma Tammi, our director, was fantastic, and it was such a fun world to play in. I’m excited to see what they are doing next.”





  




 What To Expect From Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 
          

The Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s ending doesn&#39;t directly set up a sequel, but it also certainly doesn&#39;t close the door on one either. Hutcherson&#39;s Mike remains alive when the credits start to roll, as does Piper Rubio&#39;s Abby, Mike&#39;s younger sister, and Elizabeth Lail&#39;s Vanessa (though she is hospitalized and in a coma). The film&#39;s central antagonist, Steve Raglan (Matthew Lillard), aka William Afton, gets trapped inside his suit due to the springlock mechanism, sustaining an apparent fatal injury in the process.




The sequel, then, has the freedom to take the story in a number of different directions. Unlike the video games, which feature a variety of different protagonists and locations across the different entries, Hutcherson&#39;s latest comment seemingly affirms that the follow-up will directly continue the story of his character, which could mean that other Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s cast members like Rubio and Lail return as well.



In a recent interview with Screen Rant, Lillard teases that William Afton could return in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2, with the actor expressing happiness that he&#39;s found a new franchise to be a part of.




It&#39;s possible that William somehow survives his injuries and returns as an antagonist, with Afton appearing in many of the video games in different capacities. While the same Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza could return as a setting, the video game franchise features a variety of unique locations, something that the film could do as well. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is evidently still in its very early days, and it will likely be announced in the coming weeks or months whether Tammi and screenwriters Scott Cawthorn and Seth Cuddeback will be returning.
