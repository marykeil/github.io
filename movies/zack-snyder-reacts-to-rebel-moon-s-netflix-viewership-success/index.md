## Literature Review
Zack Snyder celebrates the streaming results of the premiere of his new Netflix science fiction movie Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.




Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire&#39;s streaming success has been celebrated by Zack Snyder. The director, who is perhaps best known for his entries in the superhero genre including Watchmen, Man of Steel, and Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, has turned to the science fiction genre for his latest epic movie. The new Netflix title, which will see Part Two premiere in early 2024, follows a warrior named Kora (Sofia Boutella) gathering rebel forces to square off against the corrupt Motherworld, which rules the galaxy with an iron fist.




On Twitter, Zack Snyder shared a post celebrating the streaming success of the first Rebel Moon movie. Check it out below:


 

Snyder&#39;s post is accompanied by a video sharing various clips from the movie along with the announcement that it&#39;s the No. 1 movie in the world on Netflix. His caption reads &#34;Number 1 movie in the world period!!!! Thank you.&#34;


 How Rebel Moon Compares To Netflix&#39;s Other No. 1 Movies of 2023 
          

So far, Netflixâ€™s data on this kickoff to the Rebel Moon universe only extends from its premiere to the end of its fourth day on December 24. However, their numbers reflect that 23.9 million viewers accumulated a total of 54.1 million viewing hours during that time, a truly whopping total. It adds up to more than double the viewing hours of the third place title, Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, which has 25.4 million viewing hours.




However, Rebel Moon isn&#39;t even the biggest Netflix debut of December. That title would belong to the Julia Roberts apocalyptic movie Leave the World Behind, which debuted at No. 1 with 98.7 million viewing hours. Overall, of all 19 English-language Netflix original movies that debuted at No. 1 on the platform, Snyder&#39;s sci-fi project lands exactly in the middle, at No. 10. Check out how the movie compares with the Top 3 and Bottom 3 debuts on the platform throughout 2023 below:

 Title  First Week Viewing Hours   Leave the World Behind  98.7 million   Extraction 2  88.4 million   The Mother  83.7 million   Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire  54.1 million   Locked In  28.8 million   Old Dads  23.1 million   Love at First Sight  21.4 million   






While Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is performing well, the honus could potentially land on the upcoming Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver to boost those numbers and earn the sprawling franchise that is currently being planned. Snyder&#39;s vision for the universe includes an animated show, a comic series, and a narrative podcast in addition to a possible third movie. This would require consistent viewership, though it&#39;s possible the next week of the new movie (its first full week) is already poised to be even bigger and blow these early numbers out of the water.
