# The One Way The Transformers Movie Franchise Must Never Attempt To Expand


## SUMMARY 



  Transformers should not attempt a live-action TV show due to the high costs and difficulty of featuring Autobots realistically.   Animated shows would be a better choice for spinoffs, allowing for more time to flesh out stories and maintain the visually impressive look of the Autobots.   Animated projects have been successful in the past and are thriving in modern times, making them a logical and financially sound option for expanding the Transformers franchise.

## Literature Review

Transformers has been a highly successful, well-known franchise for decades; however, there is one way the movies must never attempt to expand.




Despite the success and recognition the Transformers franchise has had over the years, there is one way the movie series must never attempt to expand. Although they are not always critically acclaimed, the Transformers films are undoubtedly box office draws, accumulating over $5 billion throughout their seven live-action movies. Transformers is among the highest-grossing film franchises of all time, showing just how much of a powerhouse it is when it comes to big cinematic experiences. Transformers: Rise of the Beasts&#39; box office was the lowest yet for the series, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean drastic changes are required, especially if it means expanding in one major way.




Given how big the Transformers brand is, the IP must not go in the wrong direction by making one big expansion mistake. Transformers has not only been a hit in theaters, but also in a plethora of other media, including TV, video games, and collaborations with other projects. The confirmed crossover between G.I. Joe and Transformers could change the franchise, but despite the risks that come with it, it could be something that benefits both. Expanding to other franchises may be the fresh change that helps the Transformers movies get back to being some of the biggest films of the year, but sticking to the big screen is essential.


 A Live-Action Transformers Show Would Be A Bad Idea For The Franchise 
          

Transformers may have a great track record when it comes to live-action movies, but a live-action TV show would be far less successful. The franchise has had numerous hit TV shows, dating as far back as 1984s The Transformers series. Throughout all the different Transformers shows, none have ever dared to delve into live-action territory, and for good reason. One common theme among the Transformers movies is their huge budgets. Despite making $439 million, Transformers: Rise of the Beasts was almost a box office flop as it cost $200 million to make, revealing just how expensive these films are to create.




The Bumblebee movie&#39;s budget was the lowest of any Transformers film and still cost about $135 million. These budgets have helped the film franchise make Autobots look realistic, but this would be difficult in a show. A live-action TV series would require a huge budget to prominently feature Autobots, forcing it to become one of the most expensive shows ever made to meet the expectations set by the movies. If Transformers did opt to go for a show, Autobots likely wouldn&#39;t feature all that much, wasting any potential a live-action TV series could have. Human protagonists are important, but Autobots are key to the Transformers franchise, and it would suffer without them.



 Transformers Spinoff Shows Should Happen In Animation Instead 
          

Animated shows have worked well in the past for the Transformers franchise and would still be a better choice for potential spinoffs in the future. The best Transformers shows are some of the highest-quality projects the IP has to offer. While the films usually manage to tell a strong narrative over the duration of a few hours or multiple films, the animated shows provide more time to flesh out stories. Some animated Transformers projects feature one-off episodes without continuity, others offer more in-depth stories. Having this sort of format allows Transformers to branch out from their movie timeline and would be their best spinoff option.




Whereas a live-action series would be incredibly costly, an animated show would be much more logical from a financial perspective. Not only is it a format that has already worked for the franchise, but detailed animated shows are thriving in modern times. The likes of Arcane, Invincible, and Blue Eye Samurai are all recent examples of animated shows that have stunning art styles that are all unique to one another. Going for animated spinoff shows would still allow Autobots to feature heavily, if not more prominently, than in the movies while keeping their visually impressive looks, showcasing that animated projects would benefit Transformers&#39; future.
