## Literature Review
The worldwide box office of the new Japanese-language giant monster movie Godzilla Minus One rises to new heights, breaking a franchise record.




Godzilla Minus One has smashed a worldwide box office record. The new movie, which is the 33rd Japanese-language Godzilla movie produced by Toho and the 37th installment in the franchise overall, has been a smash hit. The monster epic, which follows Godzilla wreaking havoc on a war-torn Japan in the wake of World War II, has earned the franchise&#39;s second-best Rotten Tomatoes score (98%, just behind 1995&#39;s Godzilla vs. Destoroyah with 100%) and seen its intended one-week run in North American theaters expand to at least quadruple its size.




Per Collider, the Godzilla Minus One box office has pulled off a huge coup. The movie&#39;s worldwide gross has now hit a cumulative total of $78 million thanks to its $42 million gross in domestic theaters and an additional $35 million from international markets. This means it has outstripped the $77.9 million worldwide gross of 2016&#39;s Shin Godzilla to become the highest-grossing Japanese-language Godzilla movie of all time.


 How Godzilla Minus One Compares To The American Godzilla Movies 
          

The runaway success of the Godzilla Minus One American release is in large part what has driven the movie to this record. Although Shin Godzilla considerably outgrossed it in international markets with an overseas gross of $76 million, the 2016 movie only ever played in fewer than 500 theaters for a total of 31 days at the domestic box office. This led to a minimal gross of $1.9 million, though at the time it was the third highest-grossing American release of the Japanese branch of the franchise.




However, in spite of the domestic box office propelling the Godzilla Minus One box office run, the domestic and worldwide box office both seem to prefer the big-budget Hollywood installments in the franchise. All three movies in the Legendary Monsterverse (which also includes movies and television shows featuring other monsters like King Kong) as well as the 1998 blockbuster Godzilla have all grossed hundreds of millions of dollars worldwide, far outstripping this record-breaking Japanese hit. Check out the worldwide grosses of the American Godzilla movies compared with Godzilla Minus One below:

 Title  WW Gross   Godzilla (1998)  $379 million   Godzilla (2014)  $524.9 million   Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)  $387.3 million   Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)  $470.1 million   Godzilla Minus One (2023)  $78 million   






It&#39;s entirely possible that the worldwide gross of Godzilla Minus One could continue to rise, potentially even breaking past the $100 million milestone. While that wouldn&#39;t put it anywhere near the gargantuan grosses of its American rivals, its lower budget nevertheless means that it has already shown significantly more return on investment than any of those higher-grossing movies. It cost less than $15 million, whereas the American titles cost an average of $150 million or more, meaning that it blasted past its break-even point much quicker than the others, showcasing its financial viability.
