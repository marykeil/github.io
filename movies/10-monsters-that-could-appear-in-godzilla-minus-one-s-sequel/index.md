Toho&#39;s Godzilla Minus One impressed critics and audiences with its well-written characters, beautiful visual effects, and layered story — and a sequel could add to its strengths and bring in new monsters. Rife with tense moments, suspense, and action that&#39;s become par for the course in any depiction of Godzilla, Godzilla Minus One excelled at putting audiences in the perspective of the citizens of Japan as they helplessly watched the behemoth lay waste to their post-World War II nation. However, one element that could have improved the film is the inclusion of other monsters for the titular king of the monsters to face off against.
Although there&#39;s no official word on a sequel to Godzilla Minus One, Godzilla Minus One&#39;s box office succes suggests that Toho will capitalize on the film&#39;s momentum with a follow-up. If it does, it could deliver a Godzilla Minus One sequel filled with other monsters. Since the kaiju has shared the battlefield with powerful monsters just as strong and iconic as himself, a sequel to Godzilla Minus One would be the perfect opportunity to display Godzilla&#39;s allies and foes.

 A Huge Change In Godzilla Minus One Gives New Meaning To His Atomic Breath Power 
Godzilla Minus One makes a major change to Godzilla&#39;s most iconic power: his atomic breath. Interestingly, it also gives it an all-new meaning.







 10  King Caesar 
A Guardian Monster Who Helped Okinawa Drive Off Invading Forces In Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla
        

Debuting in 1974&#39;s Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla, King Caesar is a Shīsā-like monster, or a half-dog, half-lion creature notable in Japanese and Chinese folklore. In addition to King Caesar&#39;s unique design, the beast boasts incredible strength and durability, the power to harness and redirect enemy projectiles via his Prism Eye technique, decent intelligence, and even the ability to exorcise demons from his fellow monsters, as seen in the late-&#39;90s TV show Godzilla Island. King Caesar&#39;s inclusion in Godzilla Minus One&#39;s sequel would be great because he&#39;s depicted as protecting the citizens of Okinawa. Given Godzilla&#39;s destruction of most of Japan, their rivalry is already perfectly set up.


 9  Orga 
An Alien-Like Monster With Regenerative Abilities &amp; Massive Strength
        

Orga is one of 10 alien kaiju prominently featured in the Godzilla franchise. Debuting in the 1999 Toho production Godzilla 2000: Millennium, Orga is depicted as a failed clone of Godzilla who uses his enhanced strength and regenerative abilities in an effort to usurp Godzilla&#39;s status as the king of monsters. In addition to his strength and regenerative powers, Orga can absorb other monsters via his adaptation technique and recreate stronger versions of his victims. Orga&#39;s appearance in the second Godzilla Minus One movie could see him attempting to assimilate Godzilla, thus taking up the mantle as the strongest monster.


 8  Megalon 
Megalon&#39;s Drill Hands Make Him One Of Godzilla&#39;s Most Unpredictable Foes
        

Megalon debuted during the Showa era in Godzilla vs. Megalon and was depicted as the greatest guardian of the underground kingdom Seatopia. Despite only making a single film appearance, Megalon has developed a strong following. Sporting drills for arms, a horn atop his head that can fire laser beams, and an incredible defense courtesy of his shelled exterior, Megalon is one of the most formidable opponents of Godzilla. He&#39;d make an interesting foe for a Godzilla Minus One sequel.


 7  Hedorah 
Godzilla&#39;s Strongest Opponent During Toho&#39;s Showa Era
        

Hedorah is another alien kaiju who debuted in 1971&#39;s Godzilla vs. Hedorah. He possesses aquatic, air, and land forms, making him one of Godzilla&#39;s most versatile foes. His early depictions even show him trying to adapt to the atmospheric changes of Earth&#39;s environment. However, Hedorah is interesting because his existence is the direct result of the pollution that humans cause. As such, Hedorah technically can&#39;t be defeated, as Earth&#39;s pollution will always make it possible for him to respawn. Godzilla Minus One&#39;s handling of its themes paves the way for Hedorah&#39;s inclusion in a sequel. He would give Godzilla a good fight and audiences environmental questions to consider.


 6  Mothra 
One Of Godzilla&#39;s Consistent Allies
        

Mothra first appeared alongside Godzilla in the 1964 film Godzilla vs. Mothra, a movie centered around greedy businessmen attempting to steal one of Mothra&#39;s eggs and exploit it for revenue. While the film initially sees Godzilla and Mothra as adversaries, Mothra is prominently depicted as a benevolent being who brokers peace between the warring monsters in future installments. Boasting the ability of flight, Mothra swiftly travels around Japan and Monster Island and uses her silk for offensive and defensive measures. Mothra&#39;s appearance in Godzilla Minus One&#39;s sequel could see her once again aiding Godzilla.

 7 Strongest Monsters In Godzillas Movies - Ranked 
Over the years, many kaiju have rivaled Godzilla for his King of the Monsters title. Here&#39;s a ranking of the strongest monsters in Godzilla&#39;s movies.






 5  Gigan 
Gigan&#39;s Hook Arms Make Him Deadly Up Close &amp; His Laser Works Great At A Distance
        

Gigan is among the most lethal of Godzilla&#39;s foes. His hook arms make him a deadly opponent in close-combat situations, and his powerful laser beam makes him a formidable force at a distance. Gigan holds a classification as a bloodthirsty kaiju, or a kaiju known for deliberately dealing as much pain and damage to other monsters as possible. Gigan appearing as either a secondary or main antagonist in a Godzilla Minus One sequel works because his ruthlessness perfectly distinguishes the differences between good and evil kaiju, expanding the franchise&#39;s lore.


 4  Rodan 
Can Reach Flight Speeds Surpassing MACH 1
        

Rodan is a pterodactyl-like kaiju who debuted alongside Godzilla in the 1964 film King Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster. He is known for his ear-piercing roar, sharp claws, and incredible flight speed that can surpass MACH 1. The most notable aspect of Rodan is his personality, as he&#39;s shown on multiple occasions mocking Godzilla, and he&#39;s even expressed that he only hates humans because they hate him. While he starts off as one of Godzilla&#39;s foes, the two eventually join forces to defeat King Ghidorah after he nearly kills Mothra. Rodan in Godzilla Minus One&#39;s sequel would display the nuances of the kaijus&#39; actions while infusing humor into their interactions. 


 3  King Ghidorah 
A Capable Foe In The Air &amp; On Land


Close







King Ghidorah is an imposing dragon kaiju that is distinct because of his three heads, incredible wing span, and long-standing rivalry with Godzilla. Debuting in King Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, King Ghidorah is renowned for his trio of heads&#39; distinct personalities. It also boasts lightning breath, impressive flight speed, strength, and endurance. King Ghidorah&#39;s inclusion in Godzilla Minus One&#39;s sequel would make the most sense, as he is Godzilla&#39;s archnemesis. Additionally, his appearance would introduce the possibility of alien threats into Godzilla Minus One&#39;s lore. King Ghidorah&#39;s defeat would also set the stage for Mecha-King Ghidorah in future Godzilla Minus One installments.


 2  Anguirus 
Godzilla&#39;s First Monster Opponent


Close







Anguirus debuted in the 1955 Toho movie Godzilla Raids Again, depicted as a ferocious kaiju who doesn&#39;t allow his relatively small size stop him for going toe-to-toe with the best of them. Among Anguirus&#39; repertoire is his spiky shell, powerful tail, razor-sharp claws and fangs, and incredible speed and strength. Perhaps the most interesting thing about Anguirus, however, is his distinction as Godzilla&#39;s first monster opponent. Although their relationship develops into a long-standing friendship, Godzilla Minus One&#39;s sequel could establish Anguirus as a serious threat to Godzilla before turning him into one of Godzilla&#39;s greatest and most reliable allies.


 1  Mechagodzilla 
Debuted In 1974&#39;s Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla


Close







Mechagodzilla debuted in 1974&#39;s Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla and is renowned for his titanium finish, the plethora of weaponry at his disposal, and his iconic rivalry with Godzilla. A bloodthirsty kaiju, Mechagodzilla was built in Godzilla&#39;s image with the sole purpose of killing him — and anyone or anything that allies themselves with the king of the monsters. Mechagodzilla is unique because he can apply upgrades to himself either off-screen or in the heat of battle, making for a consistently tough opponent. If Godzilla Minus One needs a kaiju to establish a legitimate threat to Godzilla, the utterly ruthless and emotionless Mechagodzilla would be the best option.
Godzilla Minus One is currently playing in theaters.
