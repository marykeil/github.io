# MCU Phase 4 &amp; 5 Trend Risks Ruining The Avengers  Infinity War Defeat 5 Years Later


## SUMMARY 



  Phases 4 and 5 of the MCU continue to utilize a trend that makes the Avengers&#39; defeat in Infinity War look worse.   Thanos appears in projects like What If...? and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, where he is defeated by other characters, diminishing the Avengers&#39; original defeat as they could not overcome him with ease where others have.   While this trend hasn&#39;t been a major problem yet as it has been confined to the animated multiverse, if it continues in live-action, it could further weaken the impact of Avengers: Infinity War and the Avengers&#39; struggle against Thanos.

## Literature Review

A recurring trend found throughout the MCU’s Phases 4 and 5 risks ruining the Avengers’ Infinity War victory should it continue in future projects.




An MCU trend in Phases 4 and 5 risks worsening the Avengers&#39; defeat from Avengers: Infinity War if it continues into future properties. For much of Phase 4 and several projects of Phase 5, the MCU&#39;s stories have dealt with the aftermath of the conflict against Thanos. Some upcoming MCU movies and TV shows will likely do the same, while others will further the story of the Multiverse Saga to transition between the franchise&#39;s two overarching stories.




That said, the upcoming Marvel releases of 2024 must avoid a worrying trend that blends both the Multiverse Saga and Infinity Saga. One MCU project that has employed this trend of late has been What If...? season 2, while live-action projects like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness have done the same. Through one specific character vital to the Infinity Saga appearing in both of these projects - as well as What If...? season 1 - the Avengers&#39; defeat in Avengers: Infinity War is being made to look worse than it was.


 Thanos&#39; Phase 4 &amp; 5 Appearances Make The Avengers Look Worse 
          

The character in question who continuously appeared in Phases 4 and 5 is Thanos, the main villain of the MCU&#39;s Infinity Saga. The trend that is continuously utilized with Thanos&#39; appearances after the Infinity Saga links to the Multiverse Saga with other universes being shown to seemingly defeat the Mad Titan with relative ease. Through this trend, the Avengers of the prime MCU timeline are made to look worse as they failed to be victorious over Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War and were defeated by him.




                  Thanos&#39; Complete MCU Timeline Explained   Thanos was the major villain of the MCU&#39;s Infinity Saga, and though he might have met his end in Endgame, his actions can still be felt in the MCU.   

Some examples of this trend in Phases 4 and 5 include What If...? season 1, where Thanos appeared only to be killed instantaneously by Ultron. Similarly, in What If...? season 2, episode 7&#39;s ending, Wenwu and Hela teamed up to defeat Thanos and free that timeline of the multiverse from his conquest. Within the context of What If...?, this is a neat storytelling trick as Thanos being defeated makes the heroes/villains who did so look much more powerful. However, this storytelling gimmick adversely affects Earth-616’s Avengers from Infinity War as it makes them look weaker, unable to defeat Thanos where others have.

This was also a trend in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. In that film, the titular character visits Earth-838 and discovers the Illuminati consisting of Mister Fantastic, Professor X, Captain Marvel, Captain Carter, Black Bolt, and formerly the Doctor Strange of that universe. It is revealed that this team defeated Thanos on Titan, not allowing him to gather the Infinity Stones and again making Earth-616&#39;s Avengers look less impressive in favor of making the Illuminati look incredibly powerful.






 The MCU&#39;s Thanos Trend Isn&#39;t A Problem... Yet 
          

Aside from Doctor Strange 2, this Thanos trend has not been presented in live-action to a great extent, meaning it is not a major problem as of yet. The reason for this is What If...?&#39;s premise, as its endless multiversal exploration and its stories being far removed from the MCU&#39;s main timeline mean its Thanos trend is not overly impacting the core story of the franchise. However, should this trend continue in bigger ways, it could prove to be a misstep for the MCU.

Two upcoming films in the MCU have been confirmed to deal with the multiverse: Deadpool 3 and Avengers: Secret Wars. If either of those films used Thanos as a gag or an inconsequential villain who was easy to defeat as a means of powering up other characters, it would make live-action Thanos look less impressive and thus the Avengers&#39; defeat worse. Hopefully this trend of somewhat ruining Avengers: Infinity War&#39;s climactic defeat does not continue in the MCU as the film remains one of the MCU&#39;s best, and Marvel Studios should look to solidify that rather than unintentionally tarnish it.
