 10  Max Shreck Meets The Penguin - Batman Returns 
Oswald Knows How To Scare Another Villain
        

  Batman Returns  


  Release Date    June 19, 1992     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Danny DeVito , Michelle Pfeiffer , Christopher Walken , Michael Gough , Michael Murphy    


Tim Burton&#39;s Batman Returns goes out of its way to keep the Penguin hidden until just the right moment, with the movie finally unveiling him after his kidnapping of sinister businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken). Seen from behind while feeding his beloved flock of penguins, Oswald Cobblepott finally turns around and snarls &#34;Hi,&#34; to the shocked Shreck, following up with &#34;I believe the word you&#39;re looking for is AHHHHHHHH!&#34; With even the villainous Shreck shocked by Danny DeVito&#39;s Penguin, Batman Returns sets the tone for a very different take on Oswald Cobblepott with his introduction in the film.





 9  The Riddler Surprises Two-Face In His Lair - Batman Forever 
Jim Carrey Brings His Manic Energy To The Riddler&#39;s Reveal


 







  Batman Forever  


  Release Date    June 16, 1995     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Tommy Lee Jones , Drew Barrymore , Chris O&#39;Donnell , Val Kilmer , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough , Debi Mazar    


Edward Nygma&#39;s vendetta with Bruce Wayne in Batman Forever leads him to experiment with multiple possible supervillain identities before finally settling on the Riddler, and he makes his grand entrance in true Jim Carrey fashion. Using his brain-draining invention known as &#34;the box&#34; to locate the lair of Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), Nygma takes the perturbed former District Attorney by surprise, emerging from the shadows to reveal that he is &#34;Just a friend, but you can call me...THE RIDDLER!&#34; Edward Nygma has always been one of the Dark Knight&#39;s more ostentatious enemies, and Batman Forever takes full advantage of Jim Carrey&#39;s talents in introducing him into the story.





 8  The Joker Meets The Riddler Behind Bars - The Batman 
The Joker&#39;s Laugh Is Instantly Recognizable
        

  The Batman  


  Release Date    March 4, 2022     Director    Matt Reeves     Cast    Colin Farrell , Jeffrey Wright , Paul Dano , Andy Serkis , Robert Pattinson , Zoe Kravitz    


Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman mainly focuses upon the Riddler (Paul Dano) as its main villain, but it delivers a very tantalizing cameo for the Clown Prince of Crime when Dano&#39;s Edward Nashton is apprehended and put behind bars. Despite his defeat, the Riddler forms a bond with a prisoner in his adjacent cell, his visibly burned face only seen in silhouette. Nonetheless, the eerie laugh of Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker unmistakably reveals his identity, setting him up to face off with Robert Pattinson&#39;s Dark Knight as The Batman franchise moves ahead.
In a deleted scene from The Batman, Robert Pattinson&#39;s Batman has a meeting in Arkham Asylum with Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker, in which the Joker is much more clearly shown. 






 7  The Riddler Is Finally Caught In A Diner - The Batman 
He&#39;s Even Scarier Without The Mask


 







Matt Reeves largely keeps Paul Dano&#39;s Edward Nashton a.k.a. the Riddler masked in The Batman, with Nashton only finally shown when the GCPD and Batman apprehend him at a Gotham City diner. Despite how chilling Dano&#39;s performance as the Riddler is while he is masked, he&#39;s arguably even more sinister with the mask off, with Nashton devilishly grinning ear-to-ear as he is arrested. Though the Riddler has been a presence throughout The Batman, his full unmasking is an outstandingly terrifying reveal for a villain who knows how to stay one step ahead of the Caped Crusader.

 6  Henri Ducard Reveals His True Identity - Batman Begins 
Ra&#39;s Al Ghul Finally Steps Into The Light
        

  Batman Begins  


  Release Date    June 10, 2005     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Ken Watanabe , Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Linus Roache , Christian Bale , Katie Holmes , Mark Boone Junior , Michael Caine , Rutger Hauer , Cillian Murphy , Morgan Freeman    


When Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) breaks rank from the League of Shadows in Batman Begins, he thinks his mentor Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) and the League&#39;s leader Ra&#39;s Al Ghul have both died, only for Bruce to get a big surprise when Ducard returns to Wayne Manor in the third act. The even bigger surprise is that Ducard reveals himself to actually be the real Ra&#39;s al Ghul. With Ra&#39;s Al Ghul being one of Batman&#39;s greatest enemies, Batman Begins does him justice both with his extreme view of morality and by hiding his introduction behind the mask of a mentor until just before the finale.
Liam Neeson returns in a brief cameo as Ra&#39;s Al Ghul in 2012&#39;s The Dark Knight Rises, in which Bruce Wayne has a vision of Ra&#39;s while held captive in Bane&#39;s prison known as the Pit. 






 5  Bane Is Revealed As A Fearsome Villain - The Dark Knight Rises 
Nolan Hides Bane Until Just The Right Moment


 







  The Dark Knight Rises  


  Release Date    August 16, 2012     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Christian Bale , Anne Hathaway , Michael Caine , Gary Oldman    


Bane is infamous among DC villains as &#34;the man who broke the Bat&#34; in the Knightfall comics story, and The Dark Knight Rises grants him a fittingly chilling introduction when he is unmasked aboard a plane by CIA officers trying to getting intel on Bane himself. As one agent pulls the sack placed on Tom Hardy&#39;s Bane&#39;s head off, Bane intones &#34;No one cared who I was till I put on the mask.&#34; While The Dark Knight Rises tweaks elements of Bane&#39;s story, including the function of his mask, his intro reveals him gradually as a beast waiting to be unleashed upon his enemies.

 4  Harvey Dent Finally Shows His Facial Burn - The Dark Knight 
Harvey&#39;s Disfigurement Is Horrifying
        

  The Dark Knight  


  Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger    


The tragic downfall of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) in The Dark Knight leaves him with both mental and physical scars after his kidnapping by the Joker (Heath Ledger) and the death of his girlfriend Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gylenhaal). As Harvey ponders how much he has lost, he demands that Commissioner James Gordon (Gary Oldman) reveal the nickname Harvey was given at Internal Affairs, with Gordon reluctantly saying &#34;Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.&#34; The horrific burns to the left side of Harvey&#39;s face are kept hidden until the very end, with Harvey finally turning to the camera to reveal he has become Two-Face on a literal level in an unforgettable Batman villain reveal.





 3  The Joker Steps Out Of The Darkness - Batman 
The Joker&#39;s Evil Smile Is Chilling
        

  Batman (1989)  


  Release Date    June 23, 1989     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger , Billy Dee Williams , Robert Wuhl , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough    


Tim Burton&#39;s Batman gives The Clown Prince of Crime a backstory as Gotham City gangster Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), and shows his full villainous origin with Napier falling into a tub of acid at Axis Chemicals. Returning to his villainous lair to wreak vengeance upon crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance), who ordered the attempted hit on Napier&#39;s life, the transformed villain steps out of the shadows and reveals &#34;You can call me Joker, and as you can see, I&#39;m a lot happier,&#34; before killing Grissom. With Jack Nicholson&#39;s manic cackle and animated energy, the Joker&#39;s reveal in Batman is one of Mr. J&#39;s most memorable big-screen moments.

 2  Deathstroke Is Batman&#39;s Friend &amp; His Foe - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League 
Batman&#39;s Vengeful Adversary Is Hired To Kill Him (Then Joins Forces With Him In The Knightmare)
        

  Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League  


  Release Date    March 18, 2021     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Gal Gadot , Ray Fisher , Jason Momoa , Ezra Miller , Jesse Eisenberg , Jeremy Irons , J.K. Simmons , Willem Dafoe    


Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League concludes with Deathstroke (Joe Manganiello) meeting with Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) to setting a &#34;personal&#34; vendetta with Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman, Lex reveals his identity of Bruce Wayne and setting up Ben Affleck&#39;s intended Batman solo movie. The very next scene completely turns the tables on that, however, with Batman and Deathstroke teaming up in the Knightmare future in order to undo Darkseid&#39;s conquest of Earth. While Deathstroke&#39;s role in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League is a cameo, it is still a fantastic reveal, and a tantalizing tease for Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman movie and Snyder&#39;s Justice League sequels, even with both standing as unmade movies.
Per Joe Mangniello, Batgirl was going to lend Batman a hand to defeat Deathstroke in Ben Affleck&#39;s solo Batman movie. 






 1  The Joker Unmasks After Robbing A Bank - The Dark Knight 
The Joker&#39;s Reveal Is Built Up Perfectly
        

The Dark Knight brings Christian Bale&#39;s Batman up against the murderous and completely unpredictable Joker (Heath Ledger), and director Christopher Nolan grants the latter a marvelous intro in the movie&#39;s opening bank heist. The Joker&#39;s unamsking moment is an all-time stupendous villain reveal, with the villain removing his clown mask and intoning to the bank manager (and by extension, the viewer) &#34;I believe whatever doesn&#39;t kill you simply makes you...stranger.&#34; Combined with the harrowing makeover given to the Joker&#39;s make-up, The Dark Knight&#39;s intro for Heath Ledger&#39;s iconic DC antagonist is the greatest Batman villain reveal there has ever been.
