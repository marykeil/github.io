# 10 Upcoming Movie Sequels That May Struggle To Beat The Previous Movie s Box Office


## SUMMARY 


 

Avatar has been a successful franchise, but it&#39;s uncertain if each sequel can replicate the $2 billion success of the first two movies.


The next Bad Boys movie may not perform as well due to factors like nostalgia wear-off and Will Smith&#39;s declining popularity.


Avengers 5 is facing challenges like waning interest, the need for rewrites, and the departure of a key actor, making it unlikely to match the success of Avengers: Endgame.

## Literature Review
