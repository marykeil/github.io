## Literature Review

A Star Wars photo from the 2024 Emmy Awards has gone viral after featuring a real-world what-if scenario of Lando meeting a young Leia Organa.




A delightful Star Wars photo has gone viral after a snap at the 2024 Emmy Awards pictured young Leia and Lando Calrissian together. The iconic galaxy far, far away had a fairly big presence at the Emmys in 2024, largely thanks to Star Wars TV shows like Andor and The Mandalorian. Given the nominations awarded to recent Lucasfilm properties, various stars from across Star Wars&#39; upcoming movies, previous TV shows, and other projects converged for the ceremony.




                  New Star Wars Movies: Every Upcoming Movie &amp; Release Date   Here&#39;s every upcoming Star Wars movie in development - including Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order, the Dawn of the Jedi, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu!   

As shared by The Star Wars Underworld on X, an unlikely Star Wars partnership was captured. The picture that has since gone viral features Donald Glover - Solo: A Star Wars Story&#39;s Lando Calrissian and writer of the upcoming Lando Star Wars movie - standing alongside Vivien Lyra Blair, the young Leia performer from Obi-Wan Kenobi. While the canonical meeting between Lando and Leia does not come until The Empire Strikes Back when watching the Star Wars movies in order, the two performers have already been introduced in a meeting that proves to be delightful for fans of a galaxy far, far away.


 





 Young Leia Really Was Perfectly Cast 
          

The reappearance of Viven Lyra Blair in the photo with Glover only reinforces how perfectly cast she was as young Leia. Not only did she perfectly capture a young Carrie Fischer in her performance in Obi-Wan Kenobi, but Blair held her own against veteran actors like Ewan McGregor, Moses Ingram, and Jimmy Smits. This all combined to make young Leia one of the very best parts of Obi-Wan Kenobi and proved that Blair has a place in the future of Star Wars should the franchise ever require her talents again.
