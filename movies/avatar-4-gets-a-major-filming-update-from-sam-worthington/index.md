## Literature Review

Avatar 4 receives a major filming update from franchise star Sam Worthington, who reveals when the upcoming sequel will begin filming again.




Avatar 4 has received a filming update from franchise star Sam Worthington, who reveals when the upcoming James Cameron movie will begin production once more. The movie is one of four planned sequels to 2009&#39;s Avatar, with the second film, Avatar: The Way of Water, having been released in 2022. While the next sequel has already wrapped filming, the fourth and fifth installments are expected to go into production soon.




This was confirmed when People spoke to Worthington, who revealed Avatar 4 will begin filming in February. The actor explained it will be even larger a movie than can be imagined right now, indicating major plans for the franchise when it arrives. Check out what Worthington had to say below:


We go back to work on it in a month and it&#39;s big. It&#39;s bigger than you can imagine.



 Why Avatar 4 Is Being Filmed So Early 
          

The upcoming Avatar movies have release dates many years apart from one another, with the fourth installment not scheduled to come out until December 21, 2029. However, the first act of the film has already been shot, with Cameron waiting to film the rest due to an in-universe time jump. Worthington&#39;s update confirms enough time has now passed, since the film is getting back into production soon.




One key reason why the franchise&#39;s films are produced years before their release dates is because of the detailed CGI used to bring the world of Pandora to life. For example, Avatar 3&#39;s release date is December 19, 2025, despite filming having been completed in December 2020. This exhibits just how much time it will take for the effects to be applied, which will no doubt pay off with the level of detail it will have in theaters.

                  Predicting How Much Money Avatar 3, 4 &amp; 5 Will Make At The Box Office   James Cameron&#39;s first two Avatar movies have been gargantuan box office hits. Here&#39;s a rundown of box office predictions for Avatar 3, 4, and 5.   

With Avatar 4 filming so soon, it&#39;s likely the fifth and final installment will also begin production soon after. Since Cameron has envisioned the entire story of the franchise so far, it&#39;s likely the upcoming third movie will offer hints about what can be expected in the future. Now that production on the series is continuing, it may not be long before details about what to expect from the fourth installment get released.






Cameron has also expressed ideas for an Avatar 6 and Avatar 7, although it&#39;s unclear if he would direct them.
