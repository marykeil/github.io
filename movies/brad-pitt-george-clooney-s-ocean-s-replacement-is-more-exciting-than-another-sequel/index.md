## Literature Review

The upcoming Ocean’s replacement film starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt sounds more exciting than another sequel in the Ocean’s franchise.




Wolfs, the upcoming film starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt, is promising to be a replacement for the Ocean&#39;s franchise and is beginning to sound more exciting than a sequel in the latter series. Since 2001 and the release of Ocean&#39;s Eleven, the franchise has expanded beyond what many thought possible. The four mainline installments thus far - five including the 1960 film - range from the best to the worst of the Ocean&#39;s films, though this fluctuation of quality has not negated the franchise&#39;s popularity with the most recent film coming in 2018.




When watching the Ocean&#39;s movies in order, George Clooney and Brad Pitt&#39;s latest appearances came in 2007&#39;s Ocean&#39;s Thirteen. This has led to a long-lasting debate on whether an Ocean&#39;s Fourteen sequel will ever happen. However, the upcoming film starring Clooney and Pitt could serve as a replacement for the long-running heist franchise, one that sounds all the more exciting than yet another Ocean&#39;s sequel.


 Brad Pitt &amp; George Clooney&#39;s Wolfs Is Better Than Ocean&#39;s 14 
          

Wolfs, helmed by Spider-Man director Jon Watts, is a more compelling project than Ocean&#39;s Fourteen. The reason for this stems from the film&#39;s apparent similarities to the Ocean&#39;s franchise without being directly tied to it. The Ocean&#39;s sequels and spin-offs have been met with divisive reception, with many claiming that the initial Ocean&#39;s Eleven is yet to be topped. This pressure to eclipse the original would also be pinned on Ocean&#39;s Fourteen should it happen, though the same cannot be said for Wolfs starring Pitt and Clooney.




Wolfs&#39; Ocean&#39;s comparisons by Clooney make the upcoming film even more exciting beyond its lack of a franchise which would only add pressure to the production. In an interview with Total Film (via GamesRadar), Clooney described Wolfs as a &#34;really fun, dark – very dark – nutty film… It feels like an R-rated Ocean’s film.&#34; This comparison - as well as the return of Clooney and Pitt - essentially dubs Wolfs another Ocean&#39;s-like film only without the added scrutiny that would come with the latter, allowing the upcoming project to stand on its own.



 Will Ocean&#39;s 14 Ever Happen? 
          

Despite the excitement over Wolfs, a franchise as popular as Ocean&#39;s will always lead to questions of whether another sequel will happen. Interestingly, Clooney confirmed in December 2023 that a script had been written for another Ocean&#39;s film that is more akin to 2017&#39;s Going in Style in which three retirees robbed a bank. This was confirmed to Uproxx by Clooney, seemingly hinting that another Ocean&#39;s film could well be on the way. That said, it remains the case that the focus of the Ocean&#39;s franchise is firmly on the prequel to Ocean&#39;s Eleven starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling.




                  Ocean&#39;s Eleven Prequel: Confirmation &amp; Everything We Know   Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are reuniting for an Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel, and there&#39;s already plenty to discuss around the upcoming heist movie.   

 This prequel was confirmed in 2022 amid the duo&#39;s work together on Barbie. As of yet untitled, the Ocean&#39;s prequel is reportedly set in the 1960s as a loose reboot of the franchise in a similar vein to Bumblebee with the Transformers series. This will likely be the next film set in the Ocean&#39;s world before a continuation starring Clooney and Pitt as the two actors continue working on Wolfs - the admittedly more exciting prospect - which is set for release in September 2024.
