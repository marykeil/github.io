  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The best movies on Apple TV+ range from documentaries about celebrated performers to musical comedies to even a Best Picture Academy Award winner.</p>
<p>The best movies on Apple TV+ form an impressive collection of streaming content for subscribers. From documentaries about renowned performers to awards season darlings — including a Best Picture Oscar winner — the catalog of great films on Apple TV+ is only expanding. Spike Jonze and Joel Coen are a couple of the directors whose movies are currently streaming on the online service. Apple TV+ has plenty of solid movies to watch right now across every genre, though when it comes to Drama few streaming services can rival its impressive and high-quality content.
Indeed, while Apple TV+ is popular for its streaming series such as Ted Lasso, Severance, and Schmigadoon!, its movie roster is definitely worthy of consideration. By combining the works of both iconic and newcomer directors and studios alongside its own Apple TV+ originals, the service has established a strong foothold in a streaming industry dominated by even bigger names. Just as the best TV shows on Apple TV+ showcase a diverse range of talent, so do the best Apple TV+ movies.

<p>New On Apple TV+: All 2 Movies &amp; TV Shows Arriving In January 2024
Known for its award-winning original content, the Apple TV+ catalog grows from month to month. Here&rsquo;s everything new on Apple TV+ in January 2024.</p>
<p>Best Drama Movies On Apple TV+
CODA (2021)</p>

Drama</p>
<p>Release Date    August 13, 2021     Director    Sian Heder     Cast    Emilia Jones , Eugenio Derbez , Troy Kotsur , Ferdia Walsh-Peelo , Daniel Durant , Marlee Matlin     Runtime    111 minutes</p>
<p>Perhaps the most celebrated original movie on Apple TV+, CODA was the first film distributed by a streaming service to win the Oscar for Best Picture. The movie follows 17-year-old Ruby (Emilia Jones), the only hearing member of her family, who must navigate the difficulties of teenagehood with the sense of responsibility she feels towards her nearest and dearest.
While working on her father&rsquo;s fishing boat and assisting as her brother&rsquo;s and parents’ interpreter, she finds herself torn between exploring her dreams of singing and the obligations she feels to her family. In addition to Best Picture, CODA won Oscars for both Best Supporting Actor for Troy Kotsur and Best Adapted Screenplay. The Apple TV+ movie holds a Certified Fresh 94% critic score and 91% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, proving its popularity isn’t confined to the Academy.

Killers Of The Flower Moon (2023)</p>
<p>Killers of the Flower Moon<br>
History
Drama
Crime</p>
<p>Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Leonardo DiCaprio , Louis Cancelmi , Jillian Dion , Scott Shepherd , Jesse Plemons , JaNae Collins , Robert De Niro , Jason Isbell , Cara Jade Myers , Lily Gladstone     Runtime    200minutes</p>
<p>Already hailed as a Martin Scorsese masterpiece, Killers of the Flower Moon continues the director&rsquo;s shift from the glamorous, stylized violence of his Goodfellas era to a post-The Irishman sobering, haunting meditation on the horrors humans inflict on each other. Based on a true story and the David Grann book of the same name, Killers of the Flower Moon is about the 1920s Oklahoma murders of Osage people after oil was discovered on their land. At the center of it all is Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a WW1 vet whose rancher uncle, William King Hale (Robert De Niro), convinces him to marry an Osage woman named Mollie (Lily Gladstone), whose family is wealthy from oil money.</p>
<p>Killers of the Flower Moon is a film so harrowing and engrossing that viewers will forget its three-and-a-half-hour runtime. Scorsese doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the injustices and brutalities committed against the Osage by white men like Hale, and members of the Osage were consulted when filming the movie, providing the story with the authenticity it needs. From the heart-wrenching performances by the Killers of the Moon cast (particularly Gladstone) to Robbie Robertson&rsquo;s heart-pulsing score, the movie is a searing critique of an ugly chapter in American history and easily one of the best dramas on Apple TV+.
Hala (2019)</p>
<p>Hala<br>
Drama
Romance</p>
<p>Release Date    November 22, 2019     Director    Minhal Baig     Cast    Geraldine Viswanathan , Jack Kilmer , Gabriel Luna     Runtime    94 Minutes</p>
<p>Perhaps unfairly overlooked upon release, Minhal Baig&rsquo;s Hala is a refreshing coming-of-age story. Hala Masood (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a young Muslim girl who must navigate the differences between her family&rsquo;s traditions and her own passions — specifically, skateboarding. Receiving generally positive reviews on release, Hala is an insightful teen drama that is surprisingly touching and deeply emotional. Nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and for Best Feature at the Seattle International Film Festival, Hala is one of the best movies on Apple TV+ focusing on an important story of self-discovery.

<p>Bryan Tyree Henry earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the 2023 Oscars for his performance in Causeway, which is a much-deserved recognition of his centrality to the movie&rsquo;s success. Also starring Jennifer Lawrence in a gripping lead performance, the Apple TV+ Original movie follows Lawrence&rsquo;s Lynsay, a soldier who struggles to adjust to life back home after she returns to New Orleans. Causeway deservedly ranks among the best Apple TV+ movies, proving a hit with both casual viewers and professional critics alike.

<p>Oscar-winner Mahershala Ali stars alongside Glenn  , Naomie Harris, and Awkwafina in Swan Song, a romantic sci-fi film that raises existential questions about what it means to be human.

<p>Part biopic, part Cold War thriller, Tetris is more than a video game movie adaptation. The Apple TV+ movie tells the surprisingly dark story of how the titular game became a global phenomenon. In 1988, US-based entrepreneur and video game designer Henk Rogers (Taron Egerton) worked to obtain the rights to Tetris from its programmer Alexey Pajitnov (Nikita Yefremov). Enamored with what he believes to be the greatest game ever, Rogers risks his life to cross the Iron Curtain and contact the game&rsquo;s creator itself, eventually finding a way into Russia when tensions between the two nations are at their highest. For true gamers, lovers of history, and viewers looking for compelling, real-life political intrigue, Tetris is one of the best Apple TV+ movies in any genre.

The Family Plan (2023)</p>
<p>The Family Plan<br>
PG-13</p>
<p>Release Date    December 15, 2024     Director    Simon Cellan Jones     Cast    Mark Wahlberg , Michelle Monaghan , Zoe Colletti , Van Crosby , Saïd Taghmaoui , Maggie Q , Ciarán Hinds</p>
<p>Mark Wahlberg stars in the original Apple TV+ action-comedy The Family Plan, which has all the trappings of a theatrical comedy release and is among the most enjoyable easy watches on the platform. Wahlberg plays a quiet car salesman and family man named Dan Morgan, who is seemingly a pacifist bordering on pushover. However, as the movie progresses, it emerges that Dan was once a highly skilled assassin.
After an attempt is made on his life, Dan must go into hiding with his family while he tracks down his assailant — and, as this is a comedy movie primarily, hilarity ensues as wife Jessica (Michelle Monaghan) and kids Nina (Zoe Colletti) and Kyle (Van Crosby) try to come to terms with learning Dan is actually a trained killer. While The Family Plan does little to break the action-comedy mold, an incredibly charismatic performance from Wahlberg and some well-executed (if textbook) moments ensure it sits comfortably among the best movies available on Apple TV+ — especially as it&rsquo;s comparatively light viewing when held against some of the other titles on the platform.

<p>A gentle dramedy with a romantic heart, Cha Cha Real Smooth is a great showcase for director, producer, writer, and star Cooper Raiff. The movie follows Andrew (Raiff), a recent college graduate who earns money as a party starter for bar and bat mitzvahs, and he begins dating 32-year-old mother Domino (Dakota Johnson) before things inevitably become more complicated.
The Apple TV+ movie was praised for Raiff’s performance and direction, as well as the story’s touching premise and sincerity. Given even higher acclaim than Raiff’s successful feature film debut, Shithouse, Cha Cha Real Smooth is among the best movies on the streaming service and deserves a watch as the young actor-director continues climbing through the industry.

<p>Anyone who had kids or was one themselves in the &rsquo;90s remembers the Beanie Babies craze that permeated the decade. The Beanie Bubble centers on the toy manufacturer behind the bean-filled stuffies, Ty Warner (Zach Galifianakis), and the three women (Elizabeth Banks, Sarah Snook, Geraldine Viswanathan) who helped him become a billionaire. The Beanie Bubble is part of a growing &ldquo;corporate biopic&rdquo; trend in cinema, and while it isn&rsquo;t the most original or critically acclaimed of the lot, anyone who collected the toys will be fascinated by their origin story. The main cast&rsquo;s performances have also been praised, particularly Viswanathan&rsquo;s.
