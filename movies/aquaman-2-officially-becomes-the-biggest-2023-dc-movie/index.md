# Aquaman 2 Officially Becomes The Biggest 2023 DC Movie


## SUMMARY 



  Despite underperforming at the box office and receiving disappointing reviews, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was still the DCEU&#39;s biggest movie in 2023.   The success of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom can be attributed to its status as a sequel to a billion-dollar movie, setting it up for success compared to other DCEU movies released in 2023.   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom outperformed other DCEU movies in 2023, such as The Flash and Blue Beetle, which were debut installments and lacked the same level of anticipation and familiarity as the Aquaman sequel.

## Literature Review

Despite expectations, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom found relative success in 2023 and became the highest-grossing DCEU movie of the year.




Despite falling significantly behind Aquaman and several other DC movies that were released over recent years, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is officially the DCEU&#39;s biggest movie in 2023. Arthur Curry&#39;s latest outing was the DCEU&#39;s final installment, giving way to the revamped DC Universe in 2025 as DC&#39;s first cinematic franchise petered out with a series of underperforming movies that garnered middling reviews overall. Such was the case for the DCEU&#39;s swansong movie, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which earned disappointing reviews and a box office result that barely holds a candle to its predecessor.




Despite this, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was still the DCEU movie that came out on top in 2023. The Aquaman sequel saw its eponymous hero wrestle with his new responsibilities as a father and King of Atlantis while his arch-rival, Black Manta, aimed to tear Arthur Curry&#39;s life apart by seizing hold of the Black Trident and ruthlessly gunning for Curry&#39;s family. While the movie ended up lacking substance, there is no denying the spectacle it offered, eventually earning the DCEU $335 million worldwide against its budget of $200 million, according to The Numbers.

                  How To Watch DCEU Movies In Order (By Release Date &amp; Chronologically)   The DCEU&#39;s timeline may be about to be rebooted in the DC Universe, but here&#39;s how to watch the DCEU in release order or chronological order.   


 Aquaman 2 Box Office Compared To Other 2023 DC Movies 
          




 DCEU 2023 Release  Worldwide Box Office Result   Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom  $334,801,000 (so far)   The Flash  $266,516,138   Shazam! Fury of the Gods  $132,192,362   Blue Beetle  $128,772,124   



Evidently, despite concerns, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom narrowly avoided being an outright flop, even if it did fall significantly behind Aquaman&#39;s record-breaking worldwide box office of $1.1 billion. It did, however, manage to storm ahead of the other four DCEU movies in 2023. It&#39;s easy to see that the DCEU suffered last year, which is ironically thanks in no small part to the reveal of the DCU in early 2023, helping to negate the necessity to keep abreast of movies that fell distinctly under the DCEU banner. Thankfully, enough audiences felt compelled to see Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom regardless, helping to keep its head above water.






 Why Aquaman 2 Was The Biggest 2023 DC Movie 
          

The success of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom isn&#39;t all too surprising when viewing it relative to the other DCEU movies of 2023. The Flash and Blue Beetle were both debut installments in their respective sub-franchises, which may as well have been standalone movies following the reveal that their events would no longer tie into a wider narrative. Blue Beetle, specifically, was a far less well-known hero - despite the movie gaining the best reviews of the four - which further diminished the impetus to witness his debut. The Flash, meanwhile, has only appeared in movies that were critically panned and featured a controversial figure in the starring role.

Meanwhile, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was a sequel to a billion-dollar movie, which immediately set it in good stead for success. This also explains why it outperformed Shazam! Fury of the Gods, the sequel to Shazam!. While well-received, Shazam&#39;s debut raked in $360 million worldwide, which is only slightly higher than Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and shows that expectations were never going to be all that high for the sequel. While it was a big departure from Aquaman&#39;s debut, in the end, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom ended the DCEU on a respectable note after all.
