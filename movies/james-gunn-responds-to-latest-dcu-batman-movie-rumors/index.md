## Literature Review

With new rumors surrounding The Brave and The Bold, James Gunn sets the record straight about what is going on with the DC Universe movie.




DC Studios co-CEO James Gunn addresses the latest The Brave and The Bold rumors as audiences get ready for the new DC Universe and speculate on what the impending Batman movie could look like. The DCEU timeline officially came to an end in 2023, as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom served as the final installment of the franchise. However, as one universe ends, another one is about to begin, as the DC Universe is finally on its way.




With The Brave and The Bold as one of the many DC Universe movies or TV shows in the works, rumors have been swirling around about DC Studios&#39; next take on the iconic Justice League hero. Gladiator writer John Logan was recently rumored to have been tapped to write The Brave and The Bold, leading brent_barnfield94 to ask Gunn on Threads if this was accurate or not.

          

Gunn responded that &#34;No he was not,&#34; and also made it clear when fayosefelix asked if he was ever in talks for the position that Logan wasn&#39;t even considered for the gig. Currently, it is unclear if The Brave and The Bold has a writer, as this has not yet been revealed to the public.

  2:01                       Casting The Bat Family For The DC Universeâ€™s Batman Movie   The DCU&#39;s Batman reboot is set to feature at least one Robin, but who could play the other members of Bruce Wayne&#39;s extensive Bat Family?   





 What James Gunn Has Revealed About The Brave And The Bold So Far 
         

The Brave and The Bold will focus on an established Caped Crusader who discovers that he has a biological son, Damian Wayne. Known as the fourth Robin in the DC lore, Batman: The Brave and The Bold will mark Damian&#39;s live-action debut. With Damian being the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, The Brave and The Bold will explore the Dark Knight taking him under his wing as he becomes the latest Robin.

In terms of source material, Gunn has revealed that the story for The Brave and The Bold will be drawing inspiration from Grant Morrison&#39;s Batman comic run. Back in January 2023 when DC Studios revealed their initial Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters,&#34; projects, Gunn and Peter Safran shared that other members of the Bat-Family will be making appearances. As of right now, no release date has been set yet for Batman: The Brave and The Bold.






The same week as The Flash movie came out, Andy Muschetti was announced to be directing The Brave and The Bold as his next DC movie for DC Studios.




Time will tell what is going on with The Brave and The Bold - and hopefully soon, as the world is understandably eagerly anticipating details about the new take on the Gotham City legend. With this Batman being far into his career as a crime fighter, it will be exciting to see how this incarnation differentiates from past versions. Hopefully, as DC Studios get further into the development of The Brave and The Bold, more news will come out about how the DC Universe is rebooting the iconic hero.
