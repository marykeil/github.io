## Literature Review

Tom Ellis reveals his two conditions for reprising the role of Lucifer, stressing why he’s reluctant to revive the popular supernatural drama.




Actor Tom Ellis reveals his two conditions for reprising the role of Lucifer. Ellis&#39; run as the charming titular character ended in 2021, concluding the saga of the devilish protagonist as he abandoned Hell to live in Los Angeles and work as a consultant for the LAPD. Lucifer Morningstar would go on to have a memorable relationship with his partner Chloe (Lauren German) in the supernatural drama, which was based on the DC Comics character and ran for 93 episodes.




In an interview on the Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum podcast, the actor was asked about whether he&#39;d want to return for Lucifer season 7 or make a movie instead. Ellis shares that he would be open to doing a movie follow-up only if the script was good. Still, the actor underlines the importance of not reviving the show just for financial reasons. As an example, he cites his time as part of the British comedy Miranda and how creator Miranda Hart walked away even though the BBC wanted more. Read his full comment below:


I certainly feel like on the TV front, like I’ve said before, we covered all bases. I think that the only thing that would make me go back would be if it were a movie. And it would have to be good. It’s not just doing it for the sake of doing it. It would have to be, you know, we’d have to sign off on like, what the script was, and all those things. Because I feel like one of the weird things certainly about working over here is there’s so much like, when you’re somebody successful, people just want more and more and more and more and more. Whereas, where I’m from, you know, leave them wanting more is the motto. And it was never such a sort of financially commercially based industry back in the UK.
Miranda, for example, we only ever did 20 episodes in total. And it’s still iconic, and it still has an afterlife that people revisit. But the reason we only did that many is because Miranda didn’t want to do anymore. And she didn’t want to write anymore because it took so much. But she wrote all the episodes of it. And she felt like she’d done it. And, you know, to beat it around the head and dilute it as a product just for the sake of making more and more and more and more. She didn’t want to do that, and I had so much respect for her for making that decision because the BBC were desperate for it.






 


 How Lucifer Ended (&amp; How It Could Come Back) 
          

In the Lucifer series finale, the titular protagonist makes a huge decision. For the sake of Rory (Brianna Hildebrand), the future daughter he shares with Chloe, he embraces his calling of helping the souls stuck in Hell work through their guilt and get to Heaven. Chloe, however, remains on Earth, and it’s only after her death that the two are reunited for eternity. The farewell is reasonably definitive, even in the context of genre television, where anything could happen, which speaks to Ellis&#39; insistence that the return would have to be a worthwhile story.




It also points to why a Lucifer return might work better as a movie rather than a season of television since the saga of Chloe and Lucifer is essentially over. But there could be an extra chapter where the duo would have to return to Earth to complete one mission or another. A significant side quest would be memorable without devaluing the journey that the main duo has already experienced.

                  Lucifer &amp; Chloe Decker&#39;s Relationship Timeline Explained   Lucifer and Chloe&#39;s relationship started as a will-they-won&#39;t-they romance. Here&#39;s a recap of their best moments throughout Lucifer&#39;s six seasons.   

The series, which was developed by Tom Kapinos, with Ildy Modrovich and Joe Henderson as showrunners, gave a fitting send-off to the Lucifer cast that also included Kevin Alejandro, D. B. Woodside, Lesley-Ann Brandt, Scarlett Estevez, Rachael Harris, Kevin Rankin, Tricia Helfer, and Aimee Garcia. To try to capture that spark again is something that Ellis warns against and gives his valid reasons to preserve the show&#39;s legacy.
