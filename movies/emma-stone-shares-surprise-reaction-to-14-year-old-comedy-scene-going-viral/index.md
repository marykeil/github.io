## Literature Review

While promoting her current movie Poor Things, Emma Stone reacts to the 14-year-old comedy scene from Easy A currently going viral on TikTok.




Emma Stone shares her surprised reaction to the 14-year-old scene going viral from the movie Easy A. Released in 2010, the comedy starred Stone as clean-cut high school student Olive who lies about losing her virginity to her gay best friend Brandon (Dan Byrd), leading her to embrace her reputation and help other male peers lie about being sexually active, resulting in a wild new lifestyle. Inspired by The Scarlet Letter, the movie was a critical and commercial smash, further catapulting Stone to stardom following her success with Superbad and Zombieland.




A scene from Easy A has gone viral on TikTok, showing what Olive was really up to during the weekend when she &#34;lost her virginity&#34;. Olive opens a birthday card that plays a portion of the Natasha Bedingfield song Pocketful of Sunshine, claims to hate the track, and throws the card aside. However, the catchy song gets stuck in Olive&#39;s head, and she hilariously sings along to it all weekend, even in the shower. While speaking with Entertainment Tonight to promote her new movie Poor Things, Stone shares her surprised reaction to the scene going viral 14 years later. Check out what Stone said below:


No, I definitely did not. At all. [Laughs] It&#39;s interesting because thinking about Bella in this movie, there&#39;s a couple of parts that really have made me go crazy with how much I love them. And that was the first one ever, Olive.



 Why Easy A Is The Perfect Romantic Comedy 
         




Easy A could be considered one of the last of its kind as Hollywood struggles to successfully create and market romantic comedies. The movie featured an all-star cast of Stanley Tucci, Lisa Kudrow, Patricia Clarkson, Penn Badgley, and Amanda Bynes, introduced a newcomer to Hollywood, and served its purpose of making audiences laugh. It&#39;s clear, in today&#39;s world, it&#39;s difficult to get people to the movie theaters, and there&#39;s been a gaping hole in the romantic comedy department of movies coming to the big screen.



Easy A scored Emma Stone her first Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture.




Easy A is old enough to feel nostalgic while still being relevant today. Its popularity has only grown over time, as Stone&#39;s career has taken off. With certain scenes from similar romantic comedies like She&#39;s The Man also going viral on TikTok, hundreds of comments have people admitting they miss this type of rom-com.




While the future of the romantic comedy is uncertain, it&#39;s clear audiences miss what they used to be. 2023&#39;s most anticipated rom-coms, No Hard Feelings, starring Jennifer Lawrence, was well-received by critics and scored Lawrence a Golden Globe nomination. Anyone But You starring Sydney Sweeney broke box office holiday records, even in spite of its generally mixed reviews from critics. All of this proves that people want romantic comedies back, it&#39;s just up to Hollywood to keep the momentum going and make them.
