## Literature Review

Although Anna comes off as highly relatable in the Frozen franchise, a popular fan theory could change that if it turns out to be canon in Frozen 3.




Anna is a highly relatable character in Frozen, but a popular theory could change that completely if it became true in Frozen 3. Frozen premiered in 2013, and it was a major success, not only because of its catchy songs and gorgeous visuals, but the relatable story about two sisters trying to find common ground. Elsa, voiced by Idina Menzel, started as a villain, and, despite her acceptance later in the first film after overcoming her fear of her powers, she was more grounded and carried a royal, unreachable aura around her. However, her sister Anna, voiced by Kristen Bell, was always incredibly relatable in both animated films.




Although the Frozen franchise has proven Anna is incredibly loyal, brave, and a true hero willing to sacrifice herself, she is one of the most relatable Disney characters ever. Frozen introduced Anna as the goofy, fun character she was right from the start. The first time the audience sees Anna is asleep the day of the coronation, looking disheveled and mumbling in her sleep. Anna continued to be lovable, with puns, anxiety, and lots of awkward moments, which no doubt had a say in Frozen&#39;s massive appeal. With Anna being crowned Queen of Arrendele at the end of Frozen 2, a popular theory suggests she could become even less relatable in Frozen 3&#39;s story.

                  Frozen 3 Theory: Elsaâ€™s Love Interest Has Already Been Introduced   While Elsa&#39;s sexuality is unaddressed in Frozen 2, one theory suggests that Honeymaren is Elsa&#39;s love interest in the unconfirmed sequel Frozen 3.   


 A Popular Frozen 3 Theory Reveals That Anna Has Fire Powers 
Anna might harbor powers herself
         




A popular fan theory claims that Anna has fire powers, but hers took longer to develop than Elsa&#39;s ice powers, which could be explored in the upcoming Frozen 3. Frozen 2 further delved into the origins of Elsa&#39;s powers, and revealed she was actually the fifth spirit of the forest that connected the other four: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth. It also explained that Elsa and Anna represented the two sides of the bridge between nature and humanity. Based on the bridge explanation, Anna could actually end up having powers, too, just the opposite of Elsa&#39;s, as ice and fire are a common combination in fantasy stories.

Furthermore, Anna&#39;s personality perfectly balanced Elsa throughout the first two films. Anna was warm, open, and friendly, while Elsa was cautious, calm, and calculated. Based on their personalities, Elsa&#39;s reserved and cold demeanor translated into her ice powers, which means Anna&#39;s warm and goofy nature could prove she has fire powers. Not only that, but their appearances are very different, too, which could hint at their respective powers. Elsa&#39;s skin and hair are white, always keeping a theme of the winter with her outfits, while Anna has bright red hair, with a slightly pinkier skin tone and wears colorful outfits.






 Why This Theory Would Ruin Anna&#39;s Character 
The reveal won&#39;t make sense this far in the franchise
          

Although this theory seems reasonable and possible, it would also ruin Anna&#39;s character. Elsa has proven many times that she is amazing and powerful, but Anna is the realistic and relatable sister. Anna discovering she has fire powers would make both sisters powerful and, therefore, completely unrelatable, which would work against the franchise. Frozen has successfully put Anna in the spotlight before, as she is loyal and brave, but also awkward and goofy, and she doesn&#39;t need powers to save the day. Anna developing fire powers might have worked early in the franchise, but Frozen 3 is too late to reveal this secret, and it could ruin Anna&#39;s appeal.
