## Literature Review

Din Djarin and Din Grogu&#39;s The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie gives new evidence that a huge Star Wars: New Jedi Order movie theory is actually true.




Now that Star Wars has made their The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie announcement, there&#39;s more evidence than ever that a big theory about Rey&#39;s Star Wars: New Jedi Order movie will come true. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has already garnered excitement, as The Mandalorian has become one of Star Wars&#39; most well-liked TV shows. The father-son relationship between the Mandalorian apprentice Din Grogu and his adoptive father, Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin, is one of the sweetest in Star Wars. Now, it seems the dynamic duo may encounter Luke Skywalker&#39;s former Padawan and successor.




Directed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the timeline of New Jedi Order is 15 years after Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise Of Skywalker. Audiences have not been given as much information about The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, with its plot and timeline remaining a mystery for now. However, a theory suggests that the two movies could be more connected than they would appear at first glance.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Grogu Appearing In Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order Movie Is More Plausible Now 
          

Since The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu and New Jedi Order are both going to be movies, a crossover seems more plausible. Television and movies are two very different mediums. As such, it can be difficult to bring TV show characters into movies, especially considering the actors&#39; schedules. However, since Din Djarin and Din Grogu are officially moving to the big screen, they&#39;re now in the same realm as Rey&#39;s new movie. Further, since they are in the same franchise and Grogu, despite severing official ties with Luke Skywalker and the Jedi Order, is a talented Force-user, it seems more likely that the movies will tie into each other.






 Should Grogu Appear In Rey&#39;s New Star Wars Movie? 
          

Including Grogu in New Jedi Order would be a wise choice. Din Djarin and Din Grogu are an excellent example of how attachments can benefit a Force-user. As such, they could set a positive example for Rey. A big part of why the previous Jedi Orders failed was their unhealthily strict view of attachments. While Rey has witnessed the value of attachments, she was trained by Jedi who held to the traditional view. This could mean that Rey is falling into the same trap. Seeing Din Grogu&#39;s and Din Djarin&#39;s healthy relationship and its positive impact on Grogu&#39;s Force use would be a good model for Rey.

While it would be a good idea for Grogu to make an appearance in New Jedi Order, he shouldn&#39;t become one of Rey&#39;s Jedi Knights. Grogu&#39;s transformation from Jedi to Mandalorian is an essential part of his arc. Grogu spent two years training under Luke Skywalker. His decision to return to Din Djarin was well-thought-out, and it was a pivotal moment for his character. Ultimately, Grogu didn&#39;t choose to become a Mandalorian - he chose to embrace love and family, and that led him to follow in his father&#39;s footsteps. Having him abandon his father to join Rey&#39;s Jedi Order would undo all of that progress and make his The Mandalorian storyline pointless - which is why the Star Wars characters should stick to just crossing paths.
