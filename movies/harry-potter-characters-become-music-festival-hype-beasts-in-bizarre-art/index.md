## Literature Review



Harry Potter characters have been given new life in art that transplants them to a modern music festival. The Harry Potter movie franchise, which is based on the children&#39;s book series of the same name and is now part of the overarching Wizarding World franchise that includes the three Fantastic Beasts movies, ran for eight movies between 2001 and 2011. They followed boy wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as he went on various adventures with his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and fought to defeat the villainous Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes).




On Instagram, digital creator @manmeetsmachine has shared a collection of AI-generated art pieces that imagine what various characters from the Harry Potter franchise would wear if they were rocking out at a music festival. Check out the post below:


 

The gallery is accompanied by the caption &#34;You&#39;re a Hypebeast, Harry!&#34; Included among the throng of festival-goers are Harry himself, Ron, Hermione, Lord Voldemort, and Hogwarts staff members Hagrid, Dumbledore, and Snape. The uncanny set of images also includes the house elf Dobby and Harry&#39;s owl Hedwig.


 It May Be Difficult To Recast The Harry Potter Characters 
          




These images, which were created more than a decade after the premiere of the last of the Harry Potter movies, prove one important point. Even after so much time, the actors who took on the iconic parts in the original movie franchise are now more or less synonymous with visual depictions of the book&#39;s characters. This may make it difficult for the upcoming television adaptation of the books to recast those important roles.



In April 2023, it was officially announced that a Harry Potter television show was in development for the streaming service Max.




It&#39;s unlikely that many of the original cast members, if any, would return to the franchise. The core trio have aged out of their childhood roles, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all 11 years old at the time of the first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone. Additionally, other members of the Harry Potter cast have passed away since the movies were released, including Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid), and Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley).




Harry Potter is a franchise with a robust cast of characters, nearly all of which have been paired with an equally iconic onscreen performance. However, recastings have periodically occurred throughout the franchise, including Gambon stepping in as Dumbledore from the third movie onward after the death of original performer Richard Harris. That precedent could possibly ease viewers into a new version of the story, despite these well-established visual connections.
