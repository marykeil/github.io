# Where To Watch Night Swim Showtimes &amp; Streaming Status


## SUMMARY 



  Night Swim, the new horror movie from Blumhouse, will be released in theaters on January 5, 2024, making it the first major release of the year.   Blumhouse and Universal have a history of releasing movies on streaming platforms roughly eight weeks after their theatrical debut, so Night Swim could potentially be available on Peacock in late February or early March 2024.   If Night Swim doesn&#39;t perform well at the box office, it may be released on digital platforms for purchase or rental by the end of January 2024.

## Literature Review

Blumhouse&#39;s new 2024 horror movie Night Swim debuts in theaters before going to streaming. Here&#39;s where to watch the movie with different showtimes.




Blumhouse brings a new horror movie to audiences in 2024, and there are different options to watch Night Swim depending on a few factors. The well-known horror movie studio is behind the feature directorial debut from Bryce McGuire. Night Swim is the feature-length version of the horror short McGuire and Rod Blackhurst made back in 2014 and follows a family as they move into a new house and discover a supernatural presence lurks in their pool. The movie, which might copy an Are You Afraid Of The Dark? episode, stars Wyatt Russell and Kerry Condon as the husband and wife of the Waller family.




Since horror movies have a reputation for succeeding at the box office and on streaming, figuring out the best time and place to watch Night Swim is dependent on the individual. Blumhouse opted to give the 2024 horror movie a theatrical release ahead of it becoming available to stream, though. Audiences will eventually have a chance to find Night Swim on streaming services or on PVOD at a later point. Whether someone is looking to check out the film in theaters or at home, these are the various places to watch the horror movie.

  1:43                       New Blumhouse Movie Trailer&#39;s Criticism Proves An Annoying Horror Trope Needs To End   A new Blumhouse movie&#39;s trailer has received some criticism for its use of an overly trite horror trope, proving that its use in the genre should end.   


 Night Swim Releases In Theaters On January 5, 2024 
          




The earliest opportunity to see Night Swim is through its theatrical release. Blumhouse gave the film a January 5, 2024, release date, making it the first major release of the new year. The early months of the year have become a common spot for horror movies to be released and find success if they appeal to audiences. Night Swim&#39;s premise and a lack of other scary movies out in theaters at the time could help the film in the long run.

 When Will Night Swim Release On Streaming? 
          




Blumhouse has yet to announce when Night Swim&#39;s streaming release date will be. However, it is possible to predict when this will happen. Blumhouse and Universal have a history that could reveal a pattern for Night Swim to follow. 2023 releases like M3GAN and The Exorcist: Believer moved to streaming roughly eight weeks after debuting in theaters. Since the movie is distributed by Universal Pictures, it is expected that it will be released on Peacock when that time comes. That could mean Night Swim will be released on Peacock in late February or early March 2024.



 When Will Night Swim Release On Digital? 
          

For those wanting to watch Night Swim at home without needing a streaming service, its release on digital at a later date will make that possible. Blumhouse and Universal have not confirmed when this will be, but there might not be too big of a wait. The Exorcist: Believer went to PVOD in less than three weeks. If there is not a big enough box office return, the studios could give the option to buy or rent Night Swim on digital by the end of January 2024.
