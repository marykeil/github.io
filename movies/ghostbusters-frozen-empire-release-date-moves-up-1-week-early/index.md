## Literature Review

The Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire release date has been moved up one week earlier to capitalize on the spring break surge at the box office.




The Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire release date in March has been moved up one week earlier. A direct follow-up to 2021’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife, the fifth film in the franchise follows the Spengler family as they team up with the original Ghostbusters to protect New York City from the Death Chill and prevent a second Ice Age. The Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire cast brings back Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Celeste O&#39;Connor, and Logan Kim alongside original stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, and William Atherton.




Now, the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire release date has been pushed up by one week. Per Deadline, the new Ghostbusters movie has moved from March 29 to March 22. The film is set to screen in IMAX and other premium large formats.


 Why The Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire Release Date Was Moved Up 
          

Sony shifting the Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire release date is intended to capitalize on an additional week of the spring break box office surge in late March, especially during a time when there won&#39;t be much competition. By moving to March 22, the Ghostbusters movie will open against Mark Wahlberg&#39;s Arthur the King and The American Society of Magical Negroes. Based on the box office performance of Wahlberg&#39;s recent biographical dramas Joe Bell ($1.7 million) and Father Stu ($21.8 million), Arthur the King doesn&#39;t pose much of a threat to the storied Ghostbusters franchise.




                  25 Most Anticipated Movies Of 2024   There are plenty of major franchises, directors, and stars with films coming out in 2024, but these are Screen Rant&#39;s most anticipated movies of 2024.   

The franchise&#39;s soft reboot, the nostalgic Ghostbusters: Afterlife, was released in theaters on November 19, 2021, alongside King Richard, during a time when the box office was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite that, it grossed $44 million during its opening weekend and ended its run with $204 million worldwide. Over two more years removed from the heart of the pandemic, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire has hopes of posting a better box office performance, and its release date on March 22 maximizes its chance of doing so.
