## Literature Review

Some popular movie quotes are so famous that they are instantly recognizable, even for people who havenâ€™t seen the movies they are from.




Some movie quotes are so famous that even people who haven&#39;t seen the movies they come from will be able to recognize them instantly. The best quotes can summarize the entire thrust of a movie, revealing the themes and the tone with just a few words. Great delivery helps a quote catch on, but the circumstances are often more important. Any great movie can have outstanding quotes, as long as the script does all the work required to set up a poignant moment.
The best movie quotes can be stripped from their context and still hold meaning. This is how quotes work their way into the cultural lexicon. A single unforgettable line has the power to make a movie even better, but it often works the other way around. A well-written and well-acted story will make some of its best quotes even more powerful due to the weight of context. Taking these quotes out of the context of the movie doesn&#39;t fully describe what makes them so popular, but they are just as recognizable.









 








 15  &#34;There&#39;s No Place Like Home.&#34; 
The Wizard of Oz (1939)
        

  The Wizard of Oz  


  Release Date    August 25, 1939     Director    Victor Fleming     Cast    Margaret Hamilton , Jack Haley , Judy Garland , Bert Lahr , Ray Bolger     Genres    Musical , Fantasy , Family , Adventure    


Although Dorothy forms some wonderful friendships in Oz, she knows she has to return to Kansas eventually. Her family are still there waiting for her. She wakes up in her bed with her aunt and uncle watching over her, as if her adventure in Oz was all a dream. There&#39;s a certain ambiguity to the phrase Glinda teaches her which will magically send her home. It doesn&#39;t state that home is superior in any way, but simply that it&#39;s unlike anywhere else. Dorothy can still miss her friends in Oz, but it isn&#39;t where she belongs, and she knows it. Even if her home isn&#39;t perfect, it&#39;s where she needs to be.





 14  &#34;You&#39;re Gonna Need A Bigger Boat.&#34; 
Jaws (1975)


 







  Jaws  


  Release Date    June 20, 1975     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Roy Scheider , Murray Hamilton , Lorraine Gary , Robert Shaw , Richard Dreyfuss     Genres    Adventure , Thriller , Drama , Horror    


Steven Spielberg limited the screen time of the shark in Jaws, which gave it a particularly menacing presence. Without being able to see the beast they are trying to capture, the three men are left to imagine how the shark might appear based on how many victims it claimed. When it finally breaks above the surface of the ocean, it&#39;s even more terrifying than Brody was prepared for. He bolts up and tells Quint that they are unprepared. Spielberg isn&#39;t known as a comedy director, but there is something undoubtedly funny about the obviousness of Brody&#39;s statement. It betrays how scared he is.





 13  &#34;You&#39;re Killing Me, Smalls.&#34; 
The Sandlot (1993)
        

  The Sandlot  


  Release Date    April 7, 1993     Director    David Mickey Evans     Cast    Marty York , Tom Guiry , Chauncey Leopardi , Marley Shelton , Patrick Renna , James Earl Jones , Brandon Quintin Adams , Mike Vitar     Genres    sport , Family , Comedy , Drama    


Said multiple times throughout the movie, this phrase has been adopted by fans of The Sandlot as a useful shorthand for a number of situations. The delivery helps sell the sheer exasperation, but the hyperbolic language also helps. Smalls is a complete outsider. He doesn&#39;t mean to cause anyone any trouble, but he&#39;s ignorant about the ways the neighborhood kids like to do things. He is especially ignorant when it comes to baseball, which is a vital part of making new friends in his new environment.





 12  &#34;I&#39;ll Be Back.&#34; 
The Terminator (1984)
        

  Terminator  


  Release Date    October 26, 1984     Director    James Cameron     Cast    Michael Biehn , Linda Hamilton , Lance Henriksen , Paul Winfield , Arnold Schwarzenegger     Genres     Sci-Fi , Action    


1980s action movies didn&#39;t just need a high body count and a gun-toting renegade, they also needed some quips thrown in for good measure. Nobody mastered this peculiar art quite like Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose emotionless delivery emphasized his character&#39;s careful word choice in The Terminator. Spoken to a police officer who denies the Terminator access to see Sarah Connor, the famous phrase sets up a brutal slaughter in the police station. The Terminator smashes a car through the front door before mercilessly and methodically shooting every police officer brave enough not to flee immediately.





 11  &#34;Stop Trying To Make Fetch Happen!&#34; 
Mean Girls (2004)
        

  Mean Girls (2004)  


  Release Date    April 30, 2004     Director    Mark Waters     Cast    Amy Poehler , Lacey Chabert , Tina Fey , Rachel McAdams , Amanda Seyfried , Lindsay Lohan     Genres    Comedy    


Mean Girls is an extremely quotable comedy, and it combines a killer script with some brilliant performances. Mean Girls manages to tap into the dialect of high school girls, but some of its most famous phrases push things even further. &#34;Fetch&#34; is one example of the kind of ridiculous thing that these characters might say under different circumstances, but it is absolutely denied entry into the group&#39;s lexicon. The upcoming Mean Girls musical movie has a tough act to follow, and it will have to stand out in its own way.





 10  &#34;Here&#39;s Looking At You, Kid.&#34; 
Casablanca (1942)


 







  Casablanca  


  Release Date    November 26, 1942     Director    Michael Curtiz     Cast    Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman , Paul Henreid , Claude Rains , Conrad Veidt , Sydney Greenstreet     Genres    Drama , Documentary , Romance , War    


Casablanca is packed full of unforgettable quotes, most of which come out of Humphrey Bogart&#39;s mouth. Bogart oozes style as Rick, but Ilsa shakes up his relatively comfortable life when she reappears like a ghost from his past. He says &#34;here&#39;s looking at you, kid&#34; twice. The first time he says it to Ilsa in Paris when the two are at the height of their romance. The second time is a gut-wrenching goodbye, as he decides to stay behind in Casablanca while she travels to Lisbon. It&#39;s his own way of telling her that he still loves her, and that he still thinks about their past even though he decides to let it go.





 9  &#34;To Infinity And Beyond.&#34; 
Toy Story (1995)
        

  Toy Story  


  Release Date    November 22, 1995     Director    John Lasseter     Cast    Tom Hanks , Don Rickles , Annie Potts , Tim Allen , Jim Varney     Genres    Animation , Adventure , Comedy , Family , Fantasy    


He isn&#39;t aspiring to a place or a time. He&#39;s stating that he is going to surpass a concept. 

Buzz Lightyear&#39;s catchphrase in Toy Story is completely nonsensical. It&#39;s not possible to go beyond infinity, but this reflects Buzz&#39;s limitless ambition. In his mind, he is a noble space ranger on a hostile alien planet, even though he is a plastic toy in a child&#39;s bedroom in reality. The nebulous nature of &#34;infinity&#34; also underlines Buzz&#39;s blustering bravado. He isn&#39;t aspiring to a place or a time. He&#39;s stating that he is going to surpass a concept. The phrase eventually gains more nuance as a call to action despite the possible consequences. Sometimes reckless, idiotic bravery is what&#39;s called for.





 8  &#34;You&#39;re Trying To Seduce Me, Mrs. Robinson... Aren&#39;t You?&#34; 
The Graduate (1967)
        

  The Graduate  


  Release Date    December 21, 1967     Director    Mike Nichols     Cast    Dustin Hoffman , Katharine Ross , Murray Hamilton , Anne Bancroft , William Daniels     Genres    Romance , Comedy , Drama    


Benjamin does eventually enter into an affair with Mrs. Robinson, but he is very hesitant and unsure of himself to begin with. Mrs. Robinson wears animal print clothing as she toys with her young neighbor. He frantically paces around the room while she sits completely still. She has all the control until he boldly states her intentions outright, but he can&#39;t back himself up without her confirmation. Benjamin is caught at a crossroads after graduating from college. He doesn&#39;t know what he wants out of his life, and he isn&#39;t sure where to begin. Even his strongest moments are immediately undercut with doubt.





 7  &#34;I&#39;ll Have What She&#39;s Having.&#34; 
When Harry Met Sally (1989)
        

  When Harry Met Sally  


  Release Date    July 21, 1989     Director    Rob Reiner     Cast    Bruno Kirby , Meg Ryan , Carrie Fisher , Steven Ford , Billy Crystal     Genres    Comedy , Drama , Romance    


The famous diner scene in When Harry Met Sally works as an icebreaker while the two main characters share a long car ride together. During their journey, they share their opinions on love and friendship, but Sally&#39;s fake orgasm in the diner is the first time she indulges Harry&#39;s constant talk about sex. It&#39;s a good way to shut him up, as well as everyone else in the small roadside diner. But one other customer knows what to say, and she delivers the perfect button to Sally&#39;s extravagant display. The woman who says the famous line is director Rob Reiner&#39;s mother, Estelle.





 6  &#34;E.T. Phone Home.&#34; 
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)


 







  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial  


  Release Date    June 11, 1982     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Drew Barrymore , Henry Thomas , Robert MacNaughton     Genres     Sci-Fi , Adventure    


Elliott and his siblings have a lot of fun with the extra-terrestrial they find in their tool shed, but they can&#39;t communicate with one another. Gertie manages to teach E.T. some rudimentary English phrases, and his strange habits start to make sense. E.T. is from a highly intelligent space-faring species, but there are times when he seems to be on a similar level of intelligence to the children, merely because he has no understanding of the language or his surroundings. When he communicates his desire to go home, it humanizes him in a strange way. He is no longer a novelty. He is lost, scared, and alone.





 5  &#34;Say Hello To My Little Friend.&#34; 
Scarface (1983)
        

  Scarface  


  Release Date    December 9, 1983     Director    Brian De Palma     Cast    Al Pacino , Michelle Pfeiffer , Robert Loggia     Genres    Crime    


Although it&#39;s a strangely comical line, Tony Montana&#39;s defiant cry masks his hopelessness and rage. To claw his way to the top, Tony has to make violence his way of life. He turns his back on anything that doesn&#39;t help him accumulate more power and money, and he dies alone with only his guns by his side. There&#39;s an element of delusion to Tony&#39;s final stand in his mansion. There&#39;s no way that he can logically believe he will survive the dozens of armed men coming for his life, but he makes no attempt to surrender, and nor does he use his final moment for self-reflection.





 4  &#34;I Love The Smell Of Napalm In The Morning.&#34; 
Apocalypse Now (1979)
        

  Apocalypse Now  


  Release Date    August 15, 1979     Director    Francis Ford Coppola     Cast    Marlon Brando , Martin Sheen , Robert Duvall , Frederic Forrest , Sam Bottoms , Laurence Fishburne     Genres    Drama , Documentary , War    


Amid the swirling chaos of the battlefield, Lieutenant Kilgore squats down to share his thoughts with two soldiers. Despite the raging fires and explosions all around him, Kilgore feels at peace. He knows that his experience of war has permanently affected him, and he seems melancholic when he mentions that the war will be over someday. The constant noise of the scene dies down for just a moment to focus in on Kilgore&#39;s words, as if he is able to block out the battle entirely. His speech also acts as a way to reflect the audience&#39;s fetishization of war back onto them.





 3  &#34;The First Rule Of Fight Club Is: You Do Not Talk About Fight Club.&#34; 
Fight Club (1999)
        

  Fight Club  


  Release Date    October 15, 1999     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Brad Pitt , Meat Loaf , Edward Norton , Jared Leto , Helena Bonham Carter     Genres    Drama    


Although Fight Club lists eight rules, the first is by far the most famous. Even people who haven&#39;t seen Fight Club will be aware that whatever it is, you don&#39;t talk about it. Tyler Durden repeats the first rule, emphasizing the word &#34;not&#34; for the second rule. The fact that the fight club grows in popularity shows that members regularly break the first two rules, but this exclusivity is part of what is so appealing to people. The intrigue makes people want to ask questions, and they eventually get drawn into Tyler Durden&#39;s twisted philosophy.





 2  &#34;I&#39;m The King Of The World!&#34; 
Titanic (1997)
        

 
  Titanic  


  Release Date    December 19, 1997     Director    James Cameron     Cast    David Warner , Kathy Bates , Billy Zane , Bill Paxton , Bernard Hill , Kate Winslet , Leonardo DiCaprio , Gloria Stuart , Frances Fisher , Victor Garber     Genres    Drama , Romance    


The symbolism of the New World is full of possibilities for the working-class Jack, and he reverts to a sort of childlike glee at the bow of the ship 

Titanic is a brilliant story of romance and tragedy, but one of its most iconic lines comes before Jack even meets Rose. After winning a ticket for the Titanic in a game of cards, Jack finds himself unexpectedly on board a transatlantic cruise. The symbolism of the New World is full of possibilities for the working-class Jack, and he reverts to a sort of childlike glee at the bow of the ship. He sees a pod of dolphins jumping in and out of the water and feels the wind racing through his hair, and he is finally free from the troubles of his past.





 1  &#34;All Those Moments Will Be Lost In Time, Like Tears In Rain.&#34; 
Blade Runner (1982)
        

  Blade Runner  


  Release Date    June 25, 1982     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Harrison Ford , Rutger Hauer , Sean Young , Edward James Olmos , M. Emmet Walsh , Daryl Hannah , William Sanderson , Joe Turkel     Genres    Drama , Documentary , Sci-Fi , Thriller    


Blade Runner focuses on the game of cat-and-mouse between Deckard and Roy, but Roy&#39;s final moments reveal the depths of his humanity, even though he is an artificial life form. Roy shows more emotion and perspective than any other character in the movie, and his remarkable closing monologue shows Deckard his true self. Initially fearful of Roy, Deckard develops a deep empathy and respect for him. His &#34;tears in rain&#34; speech manages to capture the themes of Blade Runner with concision and grace.
