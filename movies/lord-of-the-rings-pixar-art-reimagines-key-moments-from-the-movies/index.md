# Lord Of The Rings Pixar Art Reimagines Key Moments From The Movies


## SUMMARY 



  Pixar-style art depicts key moments from The Lord of the Rings, including Bilbo&#39;s birthday party and Frodo&#39;s escape from the Nazgûl with Arwen.   The themes and world of Middle-earth would likely transition well to the world of animation, but a more hand-drawn style might be the best option.   An animated movie called The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim is due out later this year.

## Literature Review

A new batch of images imagines what key moments from The Lord of the Rings trilogy would look like if they were animated in the Pixar style.




The Lord of the Rings Pixar-style art reimagines key moments from the trilogy in animated form. Serving as an adaptation of the books by author J.R.R. Tolkien, filmmaker Peter Jackson first brought the fantastical world of Middle-earth to life in live-action in 2001, releasing a sequel in 2002 and then concluding his trilogy in 2003. Elijah Wood leads the Lord of the Rings cast as Frodo, a Hobbit who embarks on a dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring.




Now, several memorable moments from Frodo&#39;s Lord of the Rings journey are reimagined as scenes from a Pixar film in a batch of AI-generated art shared by @middle.earthh.tr on Instagram. Check out the images below:


 

The art includes the Hobbits&#39; tense escape from the Nazgûl at the Buckleberry ferry, the Hobbits meeting Strider in the Prancing Pony, Gandalf&#39;s showdown with Saruman, Arwen escaping the Nazgûl with Frodo, Frodo and Sam in farmer Maggot&#39;s field, and Bilbo at his 111th birthday party with the Ring.

  





 Would Lord Of The Rings Work As A Pixar Movie? 
          

While not as well known as Jackson&#39;s trilogy, Tolkien&#39;s epic tale was actually adapted into the medium of animation in 1978. The film was met with mixed reviews, however, and the story has mostly lived on in live-action since, including Jackson&#39;s lesser Hobbit trilogy and Prime Video&#39;s divisive The Rings of Power. An anime film titled The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim is, however, set to once again take the franchise into the world of animation later this year.



The Lord of the Rings: War of the Rohirrim tells the story of Helm Hammerhand and the fortress of Helm&#39;s Deep, and is set about 250 years before Frodo&#39;s quest.




It remains to be seen how War of the Rohirrim will be received, but there&#39;s reason to believe that a Lord of the Rings tale told in the Pixar style would work. For one, the fantastical world of Middle-earth and its array of different races and creatures, including Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits, do seem ripe for re-interpretation in animation. The themes of Tolkien&#39;s story would also work well in a Pixar-style movie, with the larger saga about the impact that small folk with big hearts can have on the world. 




Of course, there&#39;s also a fair argument to be made that Pixar&#39;s specific style of animation isn&#39;t the right choice for The Lord of the Rings. Instead, a more hand-drawn style could be a better fit to capture the more mysterious and dark aspects of Middle-earth and the beings who inhabit it. A Pixar Lord of the Rings movie isn&#39;t likely to happen anytime soon, but it&#39;s certainly possible that War of the Rohirrim kickstarts a broader exploration of Middle-earth through the medium of animation.



All three The Lord of the Rings movies, including their extended editions, are currently streaming on Max.
