## Literature Review



Western movies about revenge include some of the best entries in the genre. the Old West is traditionally portrayed as a land of lawlessness and debauchery, and elements like betrayal and pain are familiar turning points in many Westerns. While films like Unforgiven and Tombstone use revenge as a plot point, there are many Western movies where the entirety of the story hinges on the act of revenge.
The Western genre began over 100 years ago and kept up its popularity throughout the years. There are many great classic Western movies, like The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, and Unforgiven, that are still watchable today. One of the reasons why some of those movies still work today is because of timeless topics, such as revenge. Some of the most common tropes in Westerns, such as duels and shootouts, are easily incorporated into a revenge story. As many Western heroes are either outlaws or lawmen, it&#39;s easy to see why revenge would be such a prominent theme within the genre.

A lot of great Western movies are fictional, but 10 fantastic films in this iconic genre, including The Harder They Fall, are based on real people.













 








 10  Navajo Joe 
1966
        

The Spaghetti Western Navajo Joe follows the titular Joe as he seeks revenge against the bandits who killed his tribe. Led by scalp hunter Duncan, a gang had massacred Joe&#39;s tribe and then began terrorizing the nearest town, prompting Joe to seek vengeance. Directed by Sergio Corbucci, Navajo Joe is one of many Spaghetti Westerns directed by the Italian. Although the European style of Western is very different from what American viewers are used to, the film still works today. Navajo Joe includes some good commentary on the prejudice Native Americans faced back in the Old West.

 9  High Noon 
1952
        

Unlike in Navajo Joe, the main character of High Noon is not the one looking for revenge. Marshall William Kane just wants to live a quiet life with his new wife Amy when Frank Miller, an outlaw that Kane put in prison, is released. Kane is forced to make a decision when Amy declares they should leave, rather than have Kane stay and face Miller. It&#39;s a unique take on the revenge trope, and High Noon executes its premise very well. Rather than focusing on the act of revenge itself, the movie takes a more philosophical route as Kane weighs his moral obligations to the desires of his wife.





 8  Cat Ballou 
1965
        

Starring Jane Fonda in the titular role, Cat Ballou follows a young schoolteacher who becomes an outlaw after her father&#39;s murder. Joined by drunk gunslinger Kid Shelleen and cattle rustlers Clay and Jed Boone, Cat sets out to find her father&#39;s killer and bring him to justice. Cat Ballou is one of many Western movies that follow women seeking revenge, rather than men. Despite some misconceptions about the genre, women are prominently featured in many Western movies. Cat Ballou also has the unique aspect of Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye acting as a Greek chorus throughout the film. Although some of the film&#39;s humor doesn&#39;t land right, it&#39;s a fun ride with an enjoyable cast and a hint of intrigue.





 7  Hannie Caulder 
1971
        

In Hannie Caulder, Hannie&#39;s husband is murdered and she is assaulted by the Clemens gang. Hannie is left for dead and the gang goes on a crime spree. Seeking revenge, Hannie gets the help of bounty hunter Robert Culp to teach her how to gunfight. Throughout the movie, Culp warns Hannie that revenge won&#39;t make her feel better, but she ignores him. After killing the Clemens brothers, Hannie realizes that Culp was right, which is something that many revenge movies don&#39;t touch on. The aftermath of a revenge ploy is often ignored in movies, so it&#39;s refreshing to see a movie like Hannie Caulder address it. Even if the movie falls flat at some points, it&#39;s nice to see such a strong woman in an old Western.





 6  High Plains Drifter 
1973
        

High Plains Drifter is one of Clint Eastwood&#39;s most bizarre Westerns. Eastwood plays the Stranger, a gunslinger who shows up in the mining town of Lago. The U.S. Marshal of Lago, Jim Duncan, was recently murdered by outlaws and it is revealed that the townspeople commissioned his murder to keep their illegal mines operating. They hire the Stranger to protect them from the outlaws and he accepts. The bizarre nature of High Plains Drifter comes from the horror-adjacent aspects of it. High Plains Drifter is a violent and bloody Western movie with a ghostly twist at the end. The revenge portion of High Plains Drifter is a slow-burn realization, but it&#39;s still an excellent story.
Be aware of the dark nature of High Plains Drifter and any possible triggers. There are many upsetting scenes involving violence against women.

One of the few Westerns with a predominately Black cast, The Harder They Fall is a tale of revenge inspired by real people from the American West. Nat Love&#39;s parents were killed when he was a child by Rufus Buck, so when Buck is released from prison twenty years later, Love jumps at the chance to get his vengeance. Along with his allies, including Stagecoach Mary and Jim Beckwourth, Love faces off against Buck and his gang. Although the storyline isn&#39;t historically accurate, The Harder They Fall showcases many real-life cowboys and outlaws in the movie that had been kept in the shadows. It is an ambitious film that hit the mark in many places.

The Quick and the Dead is a revenge story centering around a dueling competition. The Lady, played by Sharon Stone, arrives in the town of Redemption and enters into the competition run by outlaw John Herod. Despite claiming that she&#39;s only in it for the money, it is revealed that Herod is responsible for the death of the Lady&#39;s father and she wants her revenge. The fast-paced action of the duels, offset by the melancholy nature of the Lady&#39;s past, makes for an excellent vengeance tale.

 True Grit 
An adaptation of Charles Portis&#39; 1968 novel of the same name, True Grit tells the story of 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), who enlists the help of morally-questionable lawman Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) in order to avenge the death of her father by apprehending the criminal Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). They are joined by a cocksure Texas Ranger named Labeouf (Matt Damon), who insists upon collecting the bounty on Chaney&#39;s head. The three travel across the Arkansas plains in pursuit of Chaney, risking life and limb against outlaws and wild animals in pursuit of justice.
 Release Date   December 22, 2010    Cast   Jeff Bridges , Barry Pepper , Josh Brolin , Matt Damon , Hailee Steinfeld    Rating   PG-13    Genres   Western , Drama    




A remake of the 1969 film starring John Wayne, the 2010 True Grit is a brilliantly told tale of revenge. After outlaw Tom Chaney murders her father, young Mattie Ross hires alcoholic U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to go after Chaney. They are joined by Texas Ranger LeBoeuf, who has been looking for Chaney after the outlaw killed a Senator. Part of True Grit&#39;s success was the directing of the Coen brothers, some of the best Western movie directors. The movie managed to live up to its predecessor, something not many remakes have done.





 2  The Outlaw Josey Wales 
1976
        

One of Clint Eastwood&#39;s best movies, The Outlaw Josey Wales is an excellent Western revenge story. After his wife and son are killed by a group of Union militants led by Captain Terrill, Josey Wales joins up with a group of guerrillas to exact revenge. When the guerrillas are massacred by the militants, Wales escapes and ends up with a bounty on his head. One of the things that makes The Outlaw Josey Wales such a good movie is its message, intended or not, about the never-ending cycle of war and the toll it takes on people. The trauma caused by the Civil War is seen throughout the film, most notably in Wales himself. Behind the action of the movie is pure emotion.





 1  Django Unchained

 Django Unchained 
Quentin Tarantino&#39;s Django Unchained follows Jamie Foxx&#39;s Django, a Black slave who is freed before becoming a bounty hunter.
