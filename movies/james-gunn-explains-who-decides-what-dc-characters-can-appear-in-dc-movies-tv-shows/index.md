# James Gunn Explains Who Decides What DC Characters Can Appear In DC Movies &amp; TV Shows


## SUMMARY 



  James Gunn and DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran will have final say on which DC characters appear in the new DCU universe.   They will also have a certain amount of control over other franchises like The Batman and Joker.   Any characters writers want to use in non-comic book media must go through Gunn and Safran.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s still unclear which DCEU characters could appear in future projects, and James Gunn says two people get to decide who shows up in the DCU.




James Gunn has revealed who will be deciding which DC characters appear in the DCU as well as other DC movies and shows, and it&#39;s not surprising who will be ruling over his new universe. With the recent release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the DCEU is now dead, and it went out with a whimper at the box office. Now, audiences can prepare for the birth of the DCU, which is set to begin with Superman: Legacy in 2025.




Many DC viewers have been wondering who will be appearing in this universe and who will be making these decisions. On his Threads account, Gunn clarified some questions people had about who has creative control over DC movies. The Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 director said he and DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran will be the &#34;curators of DC characters,&#34; meaning they will have final say over which DC characters do and do not appear in this universe, as well as other franchises like The Batman and Joker.


Peter and I are the curators of DC characters. That means any characters writers want to use in media of any type that’s not comic books (and a couple other things, like, I believe, podcasts), DCU or not, has to go through us.


                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   


 What We Know About Which DCEU Characters Will Be In The DCU 
         




So far, there are only a few DCEU characters who are confirmed to be appearing in Gunn and Safran&#39;s DCU. Viola Davis will be returning as Amanda Waller in Waller, airing on Max. Davis will also have a voice role in Creature Commandos, an animated series that will feature Steve Agee as John Economos from Peacemaker, along with Sean Gunn reprising his role as Weasel from The Suicide Squad. 

Peacemaker Season 2 is in development and will see John Cena returning to the role along with other cast members like Jennifer Holland&#39;s Emilia Harcourt and Freddie Stroma&#39;s Vigilante. Xolo Maridueña will also portray Blue Beetle in the DCU, but it&#39;s unclear when he will appear next. It may be confusing to see how characters like Amanda Waller and Peacemaker can exist in the DCEU and the DCU at the same time, but Gunn will certainly explain it somehow.
