A cosplay video shows a shocking transformation into The Little Mermaid’s Ursula.

As the video begins, Clark sports a bulbous periwinkle chin extension that forms the bottom of Ursula’s plump face. As the video continues, more elements are added, including additional face extensions as well as intricate eye makeup. In the final transformation, parts have been added to Clark’s entire body, transforming him more fully into Ursula.


 How This Ursula Cosplay Connects To The Role’s Origins 
          

Though Ursula is played by a woman in both prominent adaptations of The Little Mermaid, it has long been understood that the character is influenced by drag culture. Her over-the-top, exaggerated look likens itself to the campy aesthetics that were popularized by drag queens for decades before the 1989 animated film. More specifically, Ursula is thought to be influenced directly by popular drag queen Divine, who is known for her work in films like Pink Flamingos.

                  The Little Mermaid: The 20 Best Quotes   The Little Mermaid is a classic Disney Princess movie. Found amidst the romance and magic, here are some of the film&#39;s most inspirational quotes.   

By dressing up a man as Ursula, this newest cosplay is a great homage to the drag origins of the role. Clark is transformed into a fairly faithful version of the character, but one that also gives him an overly busty and curvaceous look that brings out drag’s hyperbolic femininity. At the end of the video, Clark even transforms more completely into the Divine-liked version of the role, as he is given an ostentatious wig to wear with the cosplay.

This cosplay is a fantastic reminder of the legacy of The Little Mermaid’s drag queen tie-in. The latest on-screen Ursula, McCarthy, even said that her own experience performing as a drag queen helped influence her portrayal of Ursula. While some argued that the live-action The Little Mermaid should have cast a drag queen in the role, the casting of McCarthy, who was familiar with some of the mannerisms that typify drag performance, acts as another part of maintaining inspiration for the role.
