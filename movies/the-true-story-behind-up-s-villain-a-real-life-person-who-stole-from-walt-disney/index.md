## Literature Review

Charles Muntz, the antagonist in Disney/Pixar&#39;s Up, is based on a real-life Disney villain who stole one of Walt Disney&#39;s first animated concepts.




The main antagonist in Disney/Pixar&#39;s Up is based on a real-life person who stole from Walt Disney. Even nearly fifteen years after its release, Up remains one of the most celebrated and sentimental Disney/Pixar films primarily because of the passion and thought that went into its creation. The heartfelt film was written and directed by Pete Doctor, who has also been responsible for other animated classics such as Monsters, Inc. (2001), Inside Out (2015), and Soul (2020).




Doctor has also helped bring to life a 2023 short film titled Carl&#39;s Date which features the return of Edward Asner as Up&#39;s protagonist, Carl Fredricksen. Bob Peterson, who co-directed Up with Doctor, wrote and directed Carl&#39;s Date. Up was nominated for five Academy Awards and won two for Best Original Score and Best Animated Film, marking the first of three career Oscar wins for Doctor. Carl&#39;s Date is considered a sequel to Up but is incredibly short with a runtime of just 8 minutes.

 Up&#39;s Villain Was Based On Charles Mintz 
          

The fictional villain&#39;s name is Charles F. Muntz in the 2009 animated feature film and is inspired by a man named Charles Mintz who was a real-life American film producer. Christopher Plummer portrays the villain Charles Muntz in Up, who is a famous explorer who had earned Carl&#39;s admiration in the film. Muntz is dead set on unearthing the bones of a tropical bird that doesn&#39;t exist at all so he can save his face and reputation within the archaeological community. Muntz became bitter and heartless as a result of his failed attempt to find the nonexistent bird.




Charles Mintz stole one of Walt Disney&#39;s first creations called Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. In 1928, Mintz made a secret contract with several Disney animators and successfully stole Oswald the Lucy Rabbit from Disney to have made at his production company Winkler Studio. The deception proved to hardly scratch the surface of the success that Disney would go on to have, immortalizing Mintz as a real-life Disney villain forever.



 What Happened To The Real Charles Mintz 
          

Charles Mintz found some success at Winkler Studios, which became Mintz Studios in 1929 and later Screen Gems in 1933. Mintz was nominated for two Academy Awards for 1935&#39;s Holiday Land and 1938&#39;s The Little Match Girl. Mintz eventually sold his company to Columbia Pictures in 1939 after becoming indebted to them. He died of a heart attack that same year. Charles Muntz dies a much more interesting death in Pixar&#39;s Up, falling thousands of feet from Carl&#39;s balloon house at the end of the film.
