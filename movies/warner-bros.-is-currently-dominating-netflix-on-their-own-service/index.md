## Literature Review

Warner Bros. movies are seeing a massive surge of popularity on Netflix, and here&#39;s which ones are succeeding and why they are on the platform.




Netflix has a problem right now, and that is because Warner Bros. is currently dominating Netflix on their own streaming service. Warner Bros. is a massive company that has been around for decades, but Netflix has always had a strong hold on their own streaming platform, with many of their biggest releases being Netflix originals. However, Warner Bros. is completely overshadowing Netflix right now, and that is a problem that Netflix needs to fix.




Netflix is one of the biggest streaming platforms currently running, with it being the service that really kicked off the streaming craze. While Netflix has a large library of acquired programming from all kinds of studios, much of its content library has been made up of Netflix originals in recent years. Netflix original shows like Stranger Things and Squid Game have dominated the cultural conversation, while 2023 alone saw the release of movies like Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire, Maestro, May December, and other massive films.

 Warner Bros. Has Several Movies In Netflix&#39;s Top 10 Trending Movies 
         




As of the writing of this article, Netflix originals are really struggling in the Netflix Top 10 trending movies, whereas Warner Bros. has several of its films in the rankings. Currently, Netflix doesn&#39;t have any of their own movies in the Top 10, with the ranking instead consisting of major franchises from other studios. Warner Bros. has especially found success in the Top 10, with it mostly being made up of Warner Bros. movies.

Five of the movies in Netflix&#39;s Top 10 are Warner Bros. films, with them ranging from massive IPs to fairly unknown films. The Top 10 currently features Aquaman, Meg 2: The Trench, Elvis, Those Who Wish Me Dead, and 2017&#39;s Justice League. These movies were all recently added to the streaming service, with their sudden surge in popularity overshadowing the success of most of Netflix&#39;s original movies.

Netflix subscribers may have noticed that a lot of Warner Bros. movies are suddenly trending on Netflix, and here&#39;s why. Netflix and Warner Bros. recently made a deal to bring 8 DCEU movies to Netflix, which is why popular movies like Aquaman and Justice League have found a new home on the streaming service. However, Warner Bros. has also brought other non-DC movies to Netflix, with this seemingly being an attempt to get even more eyes on Warner Bros. properties.

The addition of major Warner Bros. movies to Netflix is quite strange, as it has undoubtedly brought a lot more attention to the streaming platform. Oddly, Warner Bros. has its own streaming service in Max, meaning that bringing movies to a direct competitor is really unexpected. However, the deal between the two companies undoubtedly benefits both, which is why so many Warner Bros. movies are now trending on Netflix.
