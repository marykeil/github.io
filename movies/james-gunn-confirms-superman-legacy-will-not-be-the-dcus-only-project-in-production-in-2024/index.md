## Literature Review

Superman: Legacy begins filming in March, and James Gunn has revealed that the movie will not be the only DCU project to go into production in 2024.




James Gunn has revealed that other DC Universe projects will follow Superman: Legacy&#39;s lead and start filming this year. Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy has a set filming start date of March. Despite the DCU&#39;s first film being the only one confirmed to start shooting this year, it will not be the only one to do so, as Gunn has shared an exciting update about the DCU&#39;s upcoming movies and series.




On Threads, Gunn confirmed that Superman: Legacy will not be the only DCU project to enter production in 2024.

          

While Gunn revealed that Superman: Legacy will not be the only DCU project to start filming in 2024, the DCU creative chief did not disclose what other movies or series could follow the Superman reboot. However, some DCU projects appear as the frontrunners to begin filming in 2024.

                  All 33 DC Universe Characters Confirmed In Canon By James Gunn   Since the announcement of James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe in January 2023, many characters have been confirmed to join the new franchise.

Superman: Legacy might not be the only DCU movie starring a Kryptonian to start filming in 2024. The DCU&#39;s Kara Zor-El, aka Supergirl, is rumored to cameo in Superman: Legacy before appearing in her own film. The source of the rumor, which was behind the reveal that Ana Nogueira was writing Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow before DC&#39;s official announcement, has said that the Supergirl movie will begin filming in the second half of 2024.

If that pans out, the Supergirl movie could be one of the DCU projects Gunn was talking about. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is not the only project that could begin filming in 2024. According to Variety, Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller series on Max — Waller — will arrive in 2024. For that to be possible, the show would have to start production around Superman: Legacy and have few special effects to make what would have to be tight deadlines.

While Gunn is currently writing Peacemaker season 2, the series should not start filming this year. Previously, Gunn said that Peacemaker season 2 would go into production after he was done with Superman: Legacy, which should make for a late 2025 filming start at the earliest. With many announced projects for the DCU, a couple of other movies or series could also start filming in 2024, though it remains to be seen how the DC Universe&#39;s first year will work out.
