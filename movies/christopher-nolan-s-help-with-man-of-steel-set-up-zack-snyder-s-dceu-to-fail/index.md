# Christopher Nolan s Help With Man Of Steel Set Up Zack Snyder s DCEU To Fail


## SUMMARY 



  Christopher Nolan&#39;s influence on Zack Snyder&#39;s Man of Steel set up the DCEU to fail by approaching the film with a serious and realistic tone.   The DCEU&#39;s attempt to capture the same gritty atmosphere as Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight trilogy conflicted with the fantastical elements of Man of Steel.   The mixed reaction to Man of Steel caused the DCEU to struggle with creating a consistent tone and led to panic in trying to make subsequent films lighter.

## Literature Review

Christopher Nolan gave DC a hit franchise with his Batman films, but his help with Zack Snyder&#39;s Man of Steel set the DCEU on the wrong path.




Christopher Nolan made an impact on Zack Snyder&#39;s Man of Steel, but it set up the DCEU to fail. After Batman &amp; Robin destroyed the caped crusader&#39;s credibility as a movie star, Nolan resurrected the hero with Batman Begins, a grittier, more grounded reboot of the character. It was a massive hit with critics and audiences, and the following sequels, The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, had similar results. When DC started its cinematic universe with Man of Steel, the studio turned to Nolan as a producer and for the story to reintroduce Superman to viewers correctly.




Zack Snyder was hired as the director and brought his love for comic book lore and massive action set pieces to the film. However, with Nolan&#39;s influence looming, Man of Steel had a serious and realistic tone despite its more fantastical elements. The film tried to capture the same gritty atmosphere of Nolan&#39;s Dark Night trilogy, and that was to the detriment of the movie and the DCEU as a whole.

                  Every DCEU Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   The DCEU is almost complete after 15 movies, but how does Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom compare to the likes of Justice League and The Flash?   


 Man Of Steel&#39;s Realism Made DCEU&#39;s Larger-Than-Life Story Harder For Audiences 
         

   Man of Steel      Release Date    June 14, 2013     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe      




After audiences had grown accustomed to the realism of The Dark Knight trilogy, the DCEU immediately took them into a world of fantasy. Man of Steel opens with the death of Krypton, which includes various alien creatures and sci-fi elements. However, it still had a mature tone as it tried to have a sense of realism, even with a grander story. In a 2010 interview with Empire, Snyder discussed how he wanted to double down on the Superman comic books, but Nolan played spoiler on that and wanted to reel in some of the character&#39;s goofier aspects.


&#34;His role was just challenging some of the, like, accepted, you know, gimmes that Superman has, which I think is good. He was a great spoiler for that. You know, automatic acceptance stuff that we all were just like, &#39;What do you mean? &#39;Course he&#39;s gonna have red underwear&#39; or whatever it is.&#34;


While some audiences appreciate superhero films with more mature tones, it wasn&#39;t the right direction for the DCEU to take. Many of the more nonsensical aspects of these heroes conflicted with Nolan and Snyder&#39;s dramatic, realistic tone, especially in the next film, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The audience&#39;s reaction to this tone caused DC to panic, trying to make the tone lighter for films like Suicide Squad and Justice League. Unlike the MCU, the DCEU never had a consistent tone, and that was mainly due to the mixed reaction to Man of Steel.






 Why Man Of Steel Might&#39;ve Been A Better Standalone Movie 
          

Man of Steel kicked off the DCEU, but it feels out of place, especially since DC took a hard shift away from the solemn and dramatic tone. While Henry Cavill&#39;s well-received Superman played a larger role in the DCEU, it might have been an independent story, focusing more on Kal-El and his journey rather than the larger universe the film was setting up. Snyder could have had more control over his version of Superman, similar to how Matt Reeves had a lot of control over his version of Batman. It&#39;s unclear what tone Superman: Legacy will have, but it seems unlikely the project will adopt the same somber tone.
