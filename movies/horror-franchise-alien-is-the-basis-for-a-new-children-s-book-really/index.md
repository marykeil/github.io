# Horror Franchise Alien Is The Basis For A New Children s Book - Really


## SUMMARY 



  A Little Golden Book titled A is for Alien: An ABC Book is set to be released on July 9, 2024.   It will be a new children&#39;s book that uses the Alien franchise to teach kids the alphabet.   This is a far cry from the rest of the horror series, which is aimed at adult audiences.

## Literature Review



A new children&#39;s book will be using the sci-fi horror franchise Alien as the basis to teach kids how to learn their ABCs. The film series is best known for the Xenomorph, the titular alien creature that stalks and kills humans throughout every core entry of the franchise. Because of its many horrifying elements, the franchise has always been geared toward adult audiences.




Entertainment Weekly reports a new Little Golden Book titled, A is for Alien: An ABC Book, is coming out next year. Published by Penguin Random House, the children&#39;s book will be using the Alien movies as the basis for teaching kids the alphabet. The odd, educational book will be released on July 9, 2024.


 Why Alien Doesn’t Work As An All-Ages Series 
          

Many horrifying elements of the Alien universe make it an unfitting series to be produced for both kids and adults. Alongside the murderous Xenomorph, the franchise explores body horror through the Facehuggers and Chestbursters that make up parts of the monster&#39;s life cycle. This is in addition to complex themes such as corporate greed and an analysis of life that would be lost in an educational book.

The decision to make a children&#39;s book out of the franchise could be a good gateway for introducing the horror series to a younger audience. The book also arrives one month before the upcoming Alien: Romulus movie, meaning kids can get a chance to engage with the series as adults go see the new film. However, given how rooted the franchise is in terrifying visuals and ideas, children may not be the best audience for it to foster.

Since the new kid&#39;s book is being produced, it remains to be seen if even more Alien content will be produced for different age groups. If new media is created with younger audiences in mind, though, it could make for inferior experiences compared to the terror of its R-rated movies. It remains to be seen if this is a new direction for the franchise, or just a one-off to educate younger audiences about the Xenomorphs and the alphabet.



Alien: Romulus, the next entry in the franchise, arrives in theaters August 16, 2024.
