## Literature Review
Ryan Gosling has said that he would love to play Ghost Rider, and exciting MCU art imagines just how perfect he would be as the Marvel character.




Ryan Gosling looks comic book-accurate as Ghost Rider in striking Marvel Cinematic Universe fan art. Rumors have begun swirling that Gosling is in talks with Marvel Studios to join the MCU. Gosling would be a great addition to the upcoming Marvel movies, with the versatile actor being able to play either a villain or a hero well. In the past, Gosling said he would love to play Ghost Rider, and new MCU fan art has imagined what he would look like as the character.




On Instagram, artist @21xfour shared a fiery concept art of Gosling as the MCU&#39;s Ghost Rider.


 

The art depicts Gosling as the Johnny Blaze version of Ghost Rider, with the actor appearing in street clothes while lighting up on fire and also fully transformed as Ghost Rider. With the MCU&#39;s supernatural corner set to be opened up in a huge way through Marvel&#39;s Blade movie, Ghost Rider could debut in the near future, though Gosling could also play other characters in the MCU&#39;s Phase 6.

While Gosling&#39;s favorite MCU role might be Ghost Rider, the actor possesses the acting chops to play several high-profile characters that should be coming to the MCU in the near future. Marvel Studios is developing a Nova series, and the actor has been rumored as the favorite to play Richard Rider in the MCU. However, Gosling debunked the Nova rumors at the time he expressed his desire to play Ghost Rider.

With the recent firing of Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror and the new rumor that Gosling is in talks with Marvel coinciding, the actor could possibly become the MCU&#39;s new Big Bad. If Marvel chooses to recast Kang for the rest of the Multiverse Saga, the MCU is likely going to opt for multiple actors as Kang variants rather than having the Multiverse Saga hang on a person&#39;s shoulders again. Gosling has the necessary gravitas to play Kang the Conqueror or another important variant of the character, perhaps with the MCU making the Beyonder a Kang variant, which Gosling would be pitch-perfect for.




Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four film is a hot commodity in Hollywood these days, with the anticipated MCU movie set to go before cameras early in 2024 but having no actors attached to it so far. If Pedro Pascal&#39;s reported casting as Reed Richards does not pan out, then Gosling could bring a charismatic and nuanced performance as Mister Fantastic. Likewise, Gosling would also be a great choice for the Fantastic Four&#39;s most famous villain, Doctor Doom, with Gosling being able to finally bring Doom&#39;s complexity accurately to the big screen. It remains to be seen if the Ryan Gosling MCU rumors are true.
