## Literature Review

West Side Story actress and avid Star Wars fan, Rachel Zegler, recently revealed which Star Wars character she would love to voice.




In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Rachel Zegler revealed which Star Wars character she would love to voice. Known for playing Maria in Steven Spielberg&#39;s adaptation of West Side Story, Zegler is an accomplished actress. Some may be surprised to learn that she is also a huge Star Wars fan, and avidly consumes everything from the movies to the comics. As both a fan and an actress, there is one Star Wars character that Zegler would jump at the chance to voice.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   

Despite only being 22 years old, Zegler stated that she would love to voice Poe Dameron&#39;s mother, Shara Bey, in a cartoon adaptation of the canon comic book character. In a lighthearted post, Zegler gave the most adorable reason for wanting to play Shara Bey: the character flies a RZ-1, a ship that happens to be named with Zegler&#39;s initials. However, it&#39;s clear that this isn&#39;t the only reason Zegler wants to play Shara Bey. As a self-proclaimed fan of the comics in which Shara Bey appears, Zegler obviously has a deep appreciation for the character.


 





 Who Is Shara Bey, Mother Of Poe Dameron? 
          

First appearing in Star Wars: Shattered Empire, Poe Dameron&#39;s mother was a skilled pilot and rebel fighter. She, along with her husband, Sergeant Kes Dameron, joined the Rebellion after realizing that the Empire was corrupt. She fought in the Battle of Endor, acting as a fighter pilot in the critical battle that would see the destruction of the second Death Star. However, Shara Bey didn&#39;t stop her service there. She continued to hunt down the Imperial remnant for the New Republic, working closely with figures such as Princess Leia Organa before her death 6 years after the Battle of Endor.

Even though she was not alive to join the Resistance in their fight against the First Order, she was still a key part of its downfall. Shara Bey was the one who taught her son, Poe Dameron, how to fly. As an influential and well-respected figure in the Rebel Alliance, she inspired her son to do the right thing and fight evil where he found it. Without her, it&#39;s possible that Poe would&#39;ve never joined the Resistance in the first place. Given his essential role in the fight against the First Order, his absence would&#39;ve drastically changed key events.




Rachel Zegler would be an excellent choice to play Shara Bey in a Star Wars animation featuring the character. Not only is she a talented actress, but, as a fan, she appreciates and understands the character. As such, she would bring a passion to the role that would help audiences to connect with the character. Hopefully, Lucasfilm will take Zegler up on her offer and create a Shara Bey cartoon with her voicing the titular character.



All Star Wars movies and TV shows are available to stream on Disney&#43;.
