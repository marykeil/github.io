## Literature Review

Mortal Kombat (2021) made a divisive change regarding its main set of champions, but this is actually good news for Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 2.




Mortal Kombat (2021) made one divisive lore change regarding the Earthrealm champions, but this is actually great news for Johnny Cage’s role in Mortal Kombat 2. Following the announcement that Karl Urban will play Johnny Cage in the upcoming Mortal Kombat 2, it is all but confirmed that the fan-favorite character will have a significant role in the sequel. Considering that the first Mortal Kombat skipped the Hollywood actor, Mortal Kombat 2 must dedicate considerable screen time to introduce and flesh out Cage.




The Mortal Kombat 2 cast includes new and returning faces, suggesting the sequel will be bigger and bolder than the first film. Assuming there will be an actual Mortal Kombat in the new movie, Mortal Kombat 2 can achieve everything the 2021 reboot failed to. The sequel can also make a much better use of Mortal Kombat’s new Arcana concept.


 Mortal Kombat’s Arcana Will Easily Explain Why Johnny Cage Has Powers 
          

Mortal Kombat (2021)’s ending saw Cole Young heading into Hollywood to recruit an actor known as Cage. More than a sequel hook teasing the addition of a beloved character, this scene also strongly suggested that Johnny Cage already has the dragon mark. Instead of a random selection of champions brought together by fate, the Mortal Kombat reboot established that potential Earthrealm champions were either born the Mark of the Dragon or won it in combat after killing someone who had the mark. That is why Jax knew Cole was the person he was looking for.




As such, it can be assumed Karl Urban&#39;s character will already have the dragon mark. Whether Cage already knows the meaning of that mark and has activated his Arcana powers is difficult to say. Regardless, instead of having to dive into a lore-heavy explanation involving Cage’s family of ancient warriors to explain the character’s “green energy” powers, Mortal Kombat can simply use the Arcana to justify why Johnny Cage has powers. Cage is human and, in most versions, completely ignorant of the world of Mortal Kombat before he meets Raiden. Still, the character has powers in the games, which Mortal Kombat 2 can easily explain with the concept of Arcana.



 Why Mortal Kombat’s Arcana Was So Divisive (But Works For Johnny Cage) 
          

While providing in-universe explanations for the powers and special skills of each Earthrealm champion was an interesting idea, Mortal Kombat’s Arcana concept was a bit too exaggerated. All of the main Mortal Kombat characters were given their signature powers, weapons, or special moves by the same thing – the mark of the dragon. As such, Jax’s metal arms, Sonya Blade’s energy bracelets, and Keno’s laser eye were now suddenly powers originating from the same source. Rather than expanding the Mortal Kombat lore, the idea of Arcana made it more limited. Mortal Kombat was never a realistic world, and there was no need to justify all the moves and weapons.




That said, the dragon mark idea does work for Urban&#39;s Mortal Kombat character. Despite having been introduced as a human with no knowledge of the mystical and interdimensional forces behind the tournament, Cage had superpowers in the games somehow. It was only much later that a major retcon was made – he was now a descendant of an order of warriors. This convenient retcon was an uninspired way of explaining Cage&#39;s powers, and it removed a lot about the character’s “underdog” journey. Johnny Cage getting his powers from the dragon mark, especially if he won it in a fight and wasn’t born with it, is far more fitting for the character in Mortal Kombat 2​​​​​​.
