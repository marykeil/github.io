Summary

  Director Denis Villeneuve confirms he&#39;s working on a script for Dune: Part Three, continuing Paul Atreides&#39; story.   Villeneuve aims to keep Frank Herbert&#39;s vision alive and honor the spirit of the original Dune novel.   Dune Messiah will play a crucial role in revealing the full meaning of the Dune saga.  







Director Denis Villeneuve previews a potential Dune 3 by teasing how it would connect to the original book. Based on Frank Herbert’s classic sci-fi novel, Villeneuve’s Dune: Part One presented only a piece of the epic story of Timothée Chalamet&#39;s Paul Atreides. That story is set to continue with Dune: Part Two, which picks up Paul’s saga as he joins the mysterious Fremen in a battle against the evil Harkonnens. But as all fans of Herbert know, Paul’s story doesn’t end with the original Dune novel, as Herbert also published a sequel, Dune Messiah, in which Paul’s true destiny is revealed.

Dune director Villeneuve has indeed spoken of his desire to follow up his own upcoming Dune sequel with Dune: Part Three, and in a recent interview, he confirmed that he’s working on a script, while teasing how the third chapter in his epic would fulfill Dune author Herbert’s vision. Check out what he said below (Cine 21 via ComicBook.com):


“I&#39;m working on four different screenplays -- I know that Dune Messiah will be one of them, I don&#39;t know if it will be the next or the second next. My job was to try to keep the spirit of Frank Herbert alive as much as possible -- the whole meaning of Dune becomes clear with Dune Messiah.&#34;






 


 Dune Messiah Reveals Paul’s True Destiny – And It’s Dark 
          

The original Dune book charts Paul’s rise to become not only the leader of the desert-dwelling rebel Fremen, but a truly messianic figure known as the Kwisatz Haderach, the fulfillment of the Bene Gesserit’s centuries-long program of bloodline manipulation. In Dune lore, Paul goes on to overthrow the emperor Shaddam IV, unleashing a war that spreads the Fremen way across the known universe.

If Dune: Part Two ends where the original Dune novel does, its climax will see Paul defeating his enemies, the Harkonnens and the emperor, and assuming the mantle of Kwisatz Haderach. However, as Villeneuve teased in Dune: Part One, Paul knows through his visions that the war he is unleashing will get out of his control and spread terror to other worlds. Dune Messiah, in continuing Paul’s story, shows how this reluctant god faces up to the consequences of what he’s brought about, and things take a very dark turn indeed.






The second of six Dune novels, Dune Messiah was published in 1969.




The Dune Messiah story becomes so dark, in fact, that if Villeneuve remains faithful to Herbert’s vision, he risks angering audiences. It remains to be seen if Villeneuve’s Dune 3 ever comes to fruition, but it sounds as though the director means to complete Paul’s saga as Herbert envisioned it, no matter how grim and tragic that saga becomes.
