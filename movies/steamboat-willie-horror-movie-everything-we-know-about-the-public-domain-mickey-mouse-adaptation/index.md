## Literature Review

One day after Steamboat Willie entered the public domain, a horror movie was announced that puts a scary twist on the classic Mickey Mouse short.




With Mickey Mouse&#39;s first official appearance entering the public domain on January 1st, 2024, a Steamboat Willie horror movie has already been announced. The 1928 short created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks depicts Mickey as a steamboat captain who gets into various cartoon antics involving early versions of Disney characters like Pete and Minnie Mouse. The short was notable for a host of reasons, not the least of which was the fact that it was one of the earliest synchronized sound short cartoons. On top of that, it introduced Mickey Mouse to the world.




Due to copyright law, Steamboat Willie and its imagery entered into the public domain on the first day of 2024, meaning it could be used for any purpose as long as the artist doesn&#39;t claim ownership of the original piece. As the 2020s wear on, this has become a more common sight as popular intellectual properties like Winnie the Pooh lapse into the public domain. This has spawned the trend of &#34;mascot horror&#34;, which entails taking a beloved children&#39;s character and casting them as a bloodthirsty villain. Naturally, filmmakers wasted no time in announcing a Steamboat Willie horror movie as soon as the character became available.

 The Steamboat Willie Horror Movie Is Confirmed 
          

Unsurprisingly, it took less than a day for a Steamboat Willie horror movie to be announced, and the first reveal came from an icon in the burgeoning &#34;mascot horror&#34; genre. Director Steven LaMorte (Winnie The Pooh: Blood &amp; Honey) made the official announcement on January 2nd, 2024 that he was developing a new horror film based on the classic Disney short. Though LaMorte didn&#39;t have a title for the new project, he set a pretty swift timeline for his newest horror &#34;opus&#34;. The indie-horror maven revealed he plans to begin shooting his Mickey Mouse horror movie in spring 2024.






 Who Is Making The Steamboat Willie Horror Movie? 
          

Indie horror director Steven LaMorte is taking charge of the Steamboat Willie horror movie, and it is rather unsurprising considering his track record. LaMorte is the mind behind several &#34;mascot horror&#34; movies, and it has become his signature. Though other Mickey Mouse horror films have already started to crop up, including a Steamboat Willie film that already has a trailer, LaMorte&#39;s standing in the indie horror scene makes his project a bit more notable. While his aforementioned Winnie the Pooh: Blood &amp; Honey was generally reviled by critics, it still gained him a fair amount of attention and box office success.

While an official synopsis hasn&#39;t been provided yet, details are beginning to emerge about LaMorte&#39;s twisted vision for Mickey Mouse. Much like the original short film, the new horror flick will take place on a ferryboat and will see a dark version of the beloved mouse torturing helpless victims. Like LaMorte&#39;s previous films, the Steamboat Willie horror film will likely be filled with stomach-churning gore and generally be light on plot. However, the script also has a chance to dissect the rather creepy elements already present in the original Disney short film.
