## Literature Review

The new trailer for the upcoming Indian action movie Fighter, starring Deepika Padukone, delivers pilot action that will ease the wait for Top Gun 3.




The trailer for Fighter reveals Bollywood&#39;s answer to Top Gun. The movie, which will debut in theaters on January 25, follows an elite group of combat aviators known as the Air Dragons who are assembled to become the first responders to militant activity in the Srinagar Valley. The pandemic-delayed movie, which was originally set to premiere just a few months after Top Gun: Maverick in 2022, stars Deepika Padukone, Hrithik Roshan, and Anil Kapoor.




Viacom18 Studios has shared the trailer for the upcoming 2024 action movie Fighter. Check it out below:


 

The opening shots of the trailer reveal just how Top Gun-inspired the story is, featuring sun-caressed images of pilots in their helmets and aviator sunglasses. The trailer then shows off what else the movie has to offer, including burgeoning romantic chemistry between two of the pilots and original music written by Kumaar.


 Some Of India&#39;s Top Hitmakers Have Teamed Up For Fighter 
          

Just like the team of aviators at the center of its story, Fighter has assembled some of Bollywood&#39;s most exciting talent. This includes reteaming Pathaan director Siddharth Anand and star Deepika Padukone. The Shah Rukh Khan movie, which featured the superstar as the titular RAW agent, earned $130 million worldwide in 2023, making it the sixth highest-grossing Indian movie of all time.






Pathaan, along with Animal and 2023&#39;s other SRK movie Jawan, broke a record for the most Indian movies to gross over $100 million in a single year.




The movie&#39;s other stars also have huge hits to their credit. This includes Anil Kapoor, who starred in the Oscar-winning movie Slumdog Millionaire, and Hrithik Roshan, who starred opposite action hero Tiger Shroff in director Siddharth Anand&#39;s 2019 hit War. Music writers Kumaar and the duo Vishalâ€“Shekhar have also previously collaborated on War and Pathaan as well as dozens of other hits, both separately and together.

It remains to be seen if Fighter can compete with the Pathaan box office. However, the long wait for the upcoming Top Gun 3, which is reportedly now in development though it has an unclear production timeline, could provide the Indian movie with an international audience eager for more fighter pilot action. Even if it doesn&#39;t become a hit at that level, from the looks of this trailer it seems like the movie will be kicking off 2024 with a bang.
