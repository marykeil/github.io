# Netflix s Response To Continuing Zack Snyder s DC Snyderverse Is More Positive Than You Might Think


## SUMMARY 



  Netflix&#39;s CEO has fueled hopes of reviving Zack Snyder&#39;s DC projects, potentially turning them into Netflix originals.   Bringing the Snyderverse to Netflix would attract more subscribers and replicate the success of the Snyder cut of Justice League.   However, DC Studios would need to provide Netflix with the licensing rights, and there are already complex plans for the future of the DC Universe that may not align with Snyder&#39;s vision. Other formats like comic books and animation could be a more feasible way for Snyder to continue his superhero universe.

## Literature Review

A new DC Universe might not necessarily mean that it&#39;s the end of the road for Zack Snyder&#39;s vision as Netflix offers a reassuring update. 




Even with the DC Universe reboot coming, all hope is not lost for Zack Snyder and his DC Snyderverse as a top Netflix official has offered a surprising update. The upcoming Superman: Legacy is the first movie of the rebooted franchise, helmed by DC Studios CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran, after 2024&#39;s Creature Commandos TV show. Despite this new timeline, the continuity of pre-existing DC Extended Universe projects like Peacemaker and Blue Beetle will still play an active part. DC&#39;s upcoming movie slate in 2024 and beyond also include parallel storylines from standalone projects like Joker and The Batman.




With so much happening in DC’s film and TV department, there’s no currently room for the DCEU movies that followed Snyder’s vision. But the director has suggested that he would be willing to make more Justice League movies audiences one day. And Netflix’s head of film Scott Stuber offered some reassuring news in this regard. If the streaming giant can somehow obtain licensing rights, there’s very much a possibility of Snyder’s DC projects turning into Netflix originals.

Key Quote:


&#34;That’s always tricky because you don’t own it. Obviously, we would like to license it at some point. We’d love to have it on so that fans can experience more Zack. The more Zack we have, the better we are.” - Scott Stuber, via The Hollywood Reporter


                  How To Watch The Complete DCEU In Order   The DCEU&#39;s timeline may be about to be rebooted in the DC Universe, but here&#39;s how to watch the DCEU in release order or chronological order.   





 Why Netflix Would Be Interested In Continuing The Snyderverse 
          

Bringing the Snyderverse to Netflix would be a winning move for the streaming service, in terms of views and subscribers. Despite Zack Snyder’s original version of Justice League not getting a theatrical release, the four-hour-long director’s cut of Justice League was an instant hit among viewers ever since it was made available for streaming on Max. Based on third-party analytics, Bloomberg reported that the Snyder cut led to a 64% increase (1.48 million downloads) in Max downloads within the first ten days of its release on the HBO streaming platform. Additionally, 119.1 million app sessions were reported marking an 8.9% rise.

Considering the Snyderverse’s global fanbase, Netflix would aim to get more subscribers and replicate such streaming numbers for future DCEU movies that flesh out the narrative threads started by Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Netflix has become the home for Snyder’s creative vision with big-budget franchise projects like Army of the Dead and Rebel Moon. Despite polarizing critics and audiences, both movies have managed to rake in viewers with Army of the Dead pulling in views from 72 million households in a month (per Deadline) and Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire becoming the #1 Netflix movie worldwide during Christmas 2023.





 



 The Major Problem For Netflix Continuing The Snyderverse 
         

Despite Netflix’s obvious support for Snyder, there’s not much that the Man of Steel filmmaker can do if DC Studios doesn’t provide Netflix with the licensing rights. As it currently stands, there&#39;s little chance of Gunn and Safran greenlighting the Snyderverse for Netflix, considering they are working on their own DC Universe. Even if Snyder’s Netflix DC projects were established as an alternate timeline, DC’s own future slate already including both a main timeline and parallel stories makes things further complex.




Some of the most exciting upcoming DCU storylines include not just projects like Superman: Legacy and the Lanterns TV series but also movies like Joker: Folie à Deux and The Batman Part II, which aren’t set within Gunn’s DCU’s Chapter One: Gods and Monsters banner. With so much in the DCU pipeline and Max being a streaming partner for most of the upcoming projects, it’s unlikely that DC Studios would be willing to Snyder orchestrate a parallel DC universe on Netflix. There is simply too little incentive, particularly with the likelihood of any Snyderverse revival effectively creating competition for the DCU, and feeding into an already complex culture of fan division.

                  Every DCEU Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   The DCEU is almost complete after 15 movies, but how does Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom compare to the likes of Justice League and The Flash?   



 How The Snyderverse Could Continue Elsewhere 
          




Rather than making more movies, Zack Snyder could rely on other formats like comic books and animation to continue the Snyderverse. The director has already introduced multi-format tie-ins for his previous projects, with Rebel Moon being accompanied by the prequel comic Rebel Moon: House of the Bloodaxe, an official tie-in novel with an expanded story, and an animated short. Similarly, a plan exists for Army of the Dead’s spin-offs is Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas, an animated series confirmed to still be in production by Snyder, despite dears of cancelation. Even Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut included animated segments of a comic within the movie.

                  Zack Snyder Is Doing 1 Thing With Rebel Moon That George Lucas Couldn&#39;t With Star Wars&#39; Original Trilogy   Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon franchise was inspired by George Lucas&#39; Star Wars, but the former has already beaten the latter to the punch in one area.   

Following similar examples from his filmography, Snyder could potentially conclude his superhero universe through more economically feasible projects. A comic book series capturing the likeness of Henry Cavill’s Superman or Gal Gadot’s Wonder Woman or an animated series with their voice talents could cater to those who want to see more of Snyder&#39;s vision. Again, the rights would still need to be licensed, but may prove less complicated. Rebel Moon’s spin-offs plans also include a narrative podcast, which could be another option for the Snyderverse to continue. However, despite Netflix’s enthusiasm for backing the superhero franchise, the ultimate fate of the Snyderverse depends on Zack Snyder. If he wishes to focus his time on more original stories like Rebel Moon, as he has repeatedly said, it may be perhaps time to bid farewell to the Snyderverse for good.
