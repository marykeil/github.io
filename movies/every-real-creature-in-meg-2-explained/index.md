## Literature Review

Meg 2: The Trench features a whole host of real-life creatures, both from prehistoric and modern times, that the crew of Mana One must face.




Meg 2: The Trench contains a lot of real creatures from both prehistoric and contemporary times. The sequel to the mega-hit shark action film The Meg, Meg 2 once again stars Jason Statham as Jason Taylor, a diver who specializes in deep-sea research. Set ten years after The Meg, Meg 2 takes viewers on a journey that starts with prehistoric creatures more than 65 million years ago and brings these terrifying beasts of the past, who are based on real creatures, into the present day in a thrilling blockbuster adventure.
The Meg stands as one of the best shark movies out there, and its sequel lives up to its predecessor by delivering even bigger beasts than before and adding more prehistoric creatures to the series. While the science in Meg 2 is not always entirely accurate, the film still remains an enjoyable and exciting piece of high spectacle filmmaking. The creatures in Meg 2 may not always correspond exactly to their real life counterparts, but they stand as a testament to the enormous power of cinema to present the unimaginable and make real the most outrageous of terrifying fantasies.









 








 9  Kronosaurus 
The Trench novel by Steve Alten shows these creatures
        

Perhaps the biggest change Meg 2: The Trench makes to the book is by not including the new creature of the kronosaurus. The kronosaurus acts as the main villain of the novel and sets the entire plot of the book in motion after Jonas Taylor discovers the species was not actually extinct. The real kronosaurus lived in the Early Cretaceous period, 125-100 million years ago (via Australian Geographic), and preys on huge fish and squid, and was one of the world’s largest marine reptiles. While these creatures may not appear in Meg 2, audiences will surely see what other giant sharks Jason Statham could face off against in a potential Meg 3.





 8  Mosquitoe

It is conceivable that they fed on the lifeblood of dinosaurs during this time. 

Meg 2: The Trench opens 65 million ago in The Cretaceous Period where audiences are first greeted by a flying mosquito-like creature who is quickly snapped up by a small reptile. The inclusion of mosquitoes for this time period is historically accurate as evidence suggests that mosquitoes evolved during the Jurassic period from between 200 to 146 million years ago (via Tick Control) and it is conceivable that they fed on the lifeblood of dinosaurs during this time. In the process of trying to survive, plenty of mosquitoes surely met the same fate of the one seen in the opening of Meg 2.





 7  Prehistoric Reptiles

The ill-fated mosquitoe from the opening scene is quickly eaten by a prehistoric reptile who scurries along the beach to meet a similar fate to its previous prey. These reptiles, although not named in the film, bear striking resemblance to a new species discovered by Smithsonian researchers called Opisthiamimus gregori (via Smithsonian), who lived alongside dinosaurs in Jurassic North America about 150 million years ago. The now-extinct species diverged from modern lizards hundreds of millions of years ago and likely disappeared due to climate change, competition from other lizards, and changing habitats.





 6  Rauisuchians

The rauisuchians often preyed on other dinosaurs and died out at the end of the Triassic period. 

In an appropriate representation of the cycle of life, the prehistoric reptile is devoured by a group of four-legged dinosaur creatures whose closest real-world comparison is the giant meat eaters of the Triassic period known as rauisuchians. Rauisuchians are the top carnivores of their period (via Nature) and, during the Triassic period, were seen worldwide and offer paleontologists essential information about the evolution of both reptiles and dinosaurs. The rauisuchians often preyed on other dinosaurs and died out at the end of the Triassic period, and did not leave any descendants as the Earth moved into the Jurassic period.





 5  Tyrannosaurus Rex

During the opening scene of Meg 2 the rauisuchian-like dinosaurs run into the ocean as they flee the most famous dinosaur of them all, the Tyrannosaur Rex. The T-Rex is the most iconic dinosaur made famous in the Jurassic Park series that lived from the late Jurassic Period, about 150 million years ago, to the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 65 million years ago (via Britannica). The T-Rex stands at around 21 feet tall, is catagorized by its hind limbs, and its Latin name roughly translates to the “king of the tyrant lizards.” Although likely to spread fear on land, its impressive size pales in comparison to the real megalodon sharks in the water.





 4  Megalodon

The titular creature in the Meg series is the megalodon shark which is first seen in Meg 2: The Trench gobbling up a T-Rex as a simple snack in the movie’s opening scene and many more are later featured throughout in the Trench. The real megalodon was the largest shark that ever lived (via Natural History Museum) with its earliest fossils appearing 20 million years ago and seemingly becoming extinct 3.6 million years ago. While in Meg 2, the Mana One crew are seen facing off against a meg said to be 75 meters, the truth is megalodon grew to between 15 and 18 meters in length.





 3  Bioluminescence

After the Mana One crew in Meg 2: The Trench are trapped in the Mariana Trench they must use exosuits to walk underwater to a nearby station, to do this they are guided by bioluminescence, which lights up the ocean. Bioluminescence is caused by creatures underneath the sea and the light is created by chemical reactions within their bodies (via National Geographic.) Bioluminescent marine species include fish, bacteria, and jellies that ensure there is at least some light in parts of the ocean that otherwise would become shrouded in darkness. Bioluminescent species are not just found underwater and can be seen in certain fireflies and fungi on land.





 2  Snappers (Ichthyostega) 
Meg 2 shows these creatures on Fun Island
        

With over 65 million years having passed since the opening scene of Meg 2, certain dinosaurs have evolved to survive both in the sea and on land. These dinosaur-like creatures, seen terrorizing the inhabitants of Fun Island, are known in The Trench novel that Meg 2 is based on as Snappers, or Ichthyostega, and are a more advanced species of the creatures eaten by the T-Rex at the beginning of the movie. Ichthyostega were a real species that have since gone extinct and acted as an intermediate between fish and amphibians (via Furman University) and moved between shallow water and land.





 1  Giant Octopus

In Meg 2: The Trench the Giant Octopus is one of the most terrifying creatures to manage to break out of the Trench and cause havoc among the unsuspecting residents of Fun Island. This giant octopus is seen destroying helicopters, smashing boardwalks, and determined to take out all who stand in its way. The real prehistoric giant octopus is believed to be over 100 feet in length (via Octolab) and researchers believe there are likely even larger fossils to be discovered. Unlike many of the other creatures in Meg 2: The Trench, the giant octopus is not extinct and its relative, the giant Pacific octopus, can still be found in the ocean today.
