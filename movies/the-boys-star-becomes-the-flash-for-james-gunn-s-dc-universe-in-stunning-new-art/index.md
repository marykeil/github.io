## SUMMARY 



  Jack Quaid is imagined as the new version of Barry Allen/The Flash in DC Universe fan art.   The fan art showcases a sleeker version of Barry&#39;s suit with more yellow added.   Quaid&#39;s previous performances in The Boys and as the voice of Superman make him a convincing choice for the role of The Flash.

## Literature Review

With Ezra Miller&#39;s time as The Flash on the big screen over, The Boys&#39; Jack Quaid replaces them in James Gunn&#39;s upcoming DC Universe in new fan art.




The Boys star Jack Quaid suits up as James Gunn&#39;s The Flash through new DC Universe fan art. 2024 marked the end for two live-action versions of the Scarlet Speedster as Miller&#39;s The Flash movie arrived in theaters, only to become a box office bomb. On the small screen, Grant Gustin&#39;s The Flash TV show wrapped up its run after nearly a decade on The CW, becoming the Arrowverse&#39;s longest-running show.




While Gunn&#39;s DC Universe is getting ready to kick off in 2025 with Superman: Legacy, The Flash&#39;s place in the franchise is currently unknown. To replace both Miller and Gustin, 21xFour shared new fan art where they imagined Quaid as the new version of Barry Allen.


 

One version that 21xFour shared of Quaid as The Flash sees The Boys actor in a sleeker version of Barry&#39;s suit from the comics. Based on the images, there is more yellow added to the upper part of the costume, in comparison to the other live-action versions.


 




The other version from 21xFour goes a bit more into detail as the artist pitches this as a concept for Gunn&#39;s DC Universe. Outside of The Boys, Quaid is already a member of the DC family, as he is currently voicing the Man of Steel in My Adventures with Superman.

                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Farâ€¨   James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.   


 Why Jack Quaid Would Be Perfect As Barry Allen/The Flash 
         

With Gustin&#39;s version of The Flash being as beloved as it is, it will definitely be a challenge for DC Studios to find an actor who can compete with his iteration. One of the great elements of Quaid as an actor, which shines through in a lot of his work, is the similar charisma that he has to Gustin. Throughout The Boys&#39; run, Quaid&#39;s performance as Hughie is filled with heart and determination, as he and his allies are trying to stop The Seven, particularly Homelander.




My Adventures with Superman is another great example where Quaid, with only his voice, demonstrates how convincing he is as both a superhero and a protagonist, playing a considerable role in the show&#39;s success. As such, Quaid would not only be believable as Barry, but also as The Flash himself, and it would genuinely be intriguing to see him finally make the jump from The Boys and DC animation into DC live-action. By the time The Flash pops up in the DC Universe, it is very likely that The Boys will already be finished, meaning Quaid could easily be freed up for DC Studios.



Gunn has already confirmed that Gustin will not be reprising the role of The Flash in his DC Universe.




Time will tell how The Flash fits into Gunn&#39;s DC Universe, as the fastest man alive is currently nowhere to be seen in the plans for Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34; It is also possible that DC is saving The Flash until Chapter 2, to give room for other DC characters who have yet to appear on-screen. However, given how massively popular The Flash has gotten over the years, it is likely only a matter of time before Gunn brings the speedster into the DC Universe.
