## Literature Review
The Star Wars franchise featured several outstanding characters across every medium this year, but only 10 stand as the absolute best of 2023.



***[Star Wars](https://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars/)*** introduced several new characters while bringing back familiar ones in 2023, leading to incredible stories throughout the year. While [The *Star Wars* movies and TV shows](https://screenrant.com/star-wars-movies-shows-in-order/) generally receive the most attention and praise for their outstanding characters, the books, comics, and video games feature just as many compelling heroes and villains. From Jedi to Inquisitors, soldiers to admirals, all kinds of characters had a chance to shine in 2023 across every storytelling medium.

However, the year&#39;s best characters were the most memorable for their growth, uniqueness, and faithfulness to source material for returning characters. Each character has a different motivation driving them, contrasting methods for achieving their goals, and distinct traits that keep viewers invested. 10 *Star Wars* characters embodied these traits the most throughout the year and deserve to be recognized as the best of 2023.



##  Iskat Akaris/The Thirteenth Sister

### *Star Wars: Inquisitor - Rise Of The Red Blade*

Iskat Akaris, the Thirteenth Sister, received a detailed backstory in *[Star Wars: Inquisitor - Rise of the Red Blade](https://screenrant.com/star-wars-inquisitor-rise-red-blade-review/)* by Delilah S. Dawson, chronicling her fall to the dark side after Order 66. The novel brilliantly showcased her inner struggle as a member of the Jedi Order, following every teaching yet still feeling like an outcast. However, she discovers her talent for battle and believes that she could do more with greater freedom, leading to her inevitably joining the Inquisitorius. Iskat&#39;s arc is a familiar *Star Wars* story but is told with breathtaking detail, making her **highly relatable yet thoroughly terrifying**.



## Aau

### *Star Wars: Visions* - Volume 2

The final episode of *Star Wars: Visions* season 2 introduced Aau, a young girl who rarely spoke but connected to the Force by singing. This was an incredibly fascinating exploration of the Force that had never been seen before, and Aau&#39;s song was brought to life with stunning animation and brilliant sound design. With a curious nature and a good heart that made her want to help others, Aau was **one of the year&#39;s most likable and unique characters**.



## Ezra Bridger

### *Ahsoka*

Ezra Bridger made his long-awaited return to *Star Wars* in *Ahsoka*, played perfectly by Eman Esfandi. The live-action Ezra **perfectly captured the core traits of his animated counterpart** while feeling like an older and wiser version of the character, and Esfandi has a joyous onscreen presence. *Ahsoka* brought Ezra back, made him an even better character, and brought him home to appear in future *Star Wars* projects.



## Bo-Katan Kryze

### *The Mandalorian* - Season 3

Bo-Katan Kryze arguably had **the most compelling \*Star Wars\* character arc of 2023**, ending *The Mandalorian* season 3 in a completely different place from where she started. The season began with Bo-Katan having given up after losing the Darksaber, only to gradually find hope again after working alongside Din Djarin. She even became a member of the Children of the Watch, the people she had once looked down on, later bringing two opposing clans together to retake Mandalore. Combined with superb action scenes and a strong performance from Katee Sackhoff, Bo-Katan&#39;s journey was incredible in *The Mandalorian* season 3.



## Cal Kestis

### *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor*

Cal Kestis was a wonderful character in *Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order* and the developers made him even better in the sequel. His commitment to fighting the Empire and restoring the Jedi Order is admirable, especially after his closest allies chose a different path, and he remains a good man no matter what turns the story takes. Cal is often the group&#39;s moral compass, leading to fascinating cutscenes between him and the antagonists, but he gains new wisdom throughout the game. His goals have changed by the end as he carries a new weight on his shoulders, **adding complexity to an already great character**.



## Tech

### *Star Wars: The Bad Batch* - Season 2

Because of his high intellect, Tech has always been the most emotionally distant member of the Bad Batch, which made his character arc the most fascinating in *Star Wars: The Bad Batch* season 2. His seeming lack of concern over Crosshair&#39;s betrayal and Echo&#39;s leaving put him into conflict with Omega, bringing him out of his shell and creating a surprisingly heartfelt bond between them. Tech continued to grow and express greater emotional intelligence throughout the season, making it heartbreaking when **he chose to sacrifice himself to save the group**. As tragic as this moment was, it was a compelling end to Tech&#39;s journey throughout the show.



## Avar Kriss

### *Star Wars: The High Republic - The Eye of Darkness*

Jedi Master Avar Kriss only returned for one book in 2023 but played a crucial role in kicking off Phase III of *Star Wars: The High Republic*. Having gone off on her own for a year, she returns from Nihil space to bring hope to the galaxy while dealing with trauma and an old attachment to a fellow Jedi. Master Kriss is the High Republic era personified, embodying light, life, power, and synergy but with the danger of attachment threatening to cause a downfall. 2023 was the character&#39;s best year yet, helping to get the next phase of *The High Republic* off to an emotionally satisfying start.



## Grand Admiral Thrawn

### *Ahsoka*

*Ahsoka* and the other Mandoverse shows successfully brought several animated *Star Wars* characters into live-action, but **none were as faithful as Grand Admiral Thrawn**. Lars Mikkelsen returned to play Thrawn in *Ahsoka*, making the character&#39;s voice, mannerisms, and personality consistent with *Star Wars Rebels*. Thrawn manages to be intimidating without raising his voice or attacking another character, outsmarting his enemies through strategy and deduction. These traits were highlighted by Thrawn&#39;s victory over the heroes, setting up his war with the New Republic in Dave Filoni&#39;s *Star Wars* movie.



## Bode Akuna

### *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor*

Bode Akuna was **the most shocking \*Star Wars\* character of 2023**, with his villain reveal being the year&#39;s most significant twist. *Star Wars Jedi: Survivor* committed to making Akuna Cal Kestis&#39; friend throughout the game, making his betrayal surprising and devastating. Rather than stop there, the game revealed that Akuna was a former Jedi who could mask his presence in the Force, making his actions especially unforgivable as the game title&#39;s double meaning becomes clear. Driven to the dark side to save his daughter, Akuna&#39;s death was one of 2023&#39;s most tragic *Star Wars* moments.



##  Baylan Skoll

### *Ahsoka*

Baylan Skoll was one of Ray Stevenson&#39;s last performances before his death and **will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the best of his career**. Stevenson&#39;s charisma, reserved nature, and physicality elevated a character that was already exceptionally written, making Baylan a perfect *Star Wars* villain. Baylan&#39;s goals are highly intriguing, and his motivations are always understandable, yet he&#39;s still a ruthless antagonist. Stevenson may not have had the chance to return for *Ahsoka* season 2, but fans will always be grateful for his role in season 1 and remember him as the best ***Star Wars\*** character of 2023.
