## Literature Review

FX&#39;s upcoming Alien show won&#39;t share a canon of Ridley Scott&#39;s prequels, effectively erasing Prometheus and Alien: Covenant from the franchise.




While Ridley Scott’s most recent additions to the Alien mythos might have been blockbusters of epic proportions, Disney’s upcoming Alien TV spinoff proves that they haven’t necessarily changed the canon of the franchise for the better. The franchise began in 1979 with director Ridley Scott’s original sci-fi horror Alien, a claustrophobic, self-contained chiller. That hit was followed by director James Cameron’s bigger, more action-forward Aliens, before 1990’s disappointingly bleak Alien 3 and 1997’s misguided Alien: Resurrection.  2004’s Alien Vs Predator took the franchise’s action back into the past, only for 2012’s Prometheus to offer an alternative prequel backstory from Scott.




2017’s Alien: Covenant continued Prometheus’s knotty plot, but was met with mixed reviews and middling box office reception. Now, FX’s upcoming Alien TV show and the standalone sequel Alien: Romulus both promise to reboot the series. The new Alien movie will arrive in 2024 and will reportedly take place between Alien and Aliens, meaning the movie may not need to contend with the events of Scott’s divisive prequels. As such, the news that Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley&#39;s show also won’t borrow from Scott’s prequels effectively confirms that Prometheus and Alien: Covenant have been written out of the series canon.

                  “Ridley And I Have Talked”: Alien TV Show Will Ignore Prometheus &amp; Covenant’s Canon Changes   Writer Noah Hawley reveals whether his Alien TV series will be influenced by the story or aesthetics of later installments, including Prometheus.   


 Noah Hawley’s Alien TV Show Is All But Ignoring Prometheus &amp; Covenant 
The FX show won’t utilize story elements or stylistic shifts seen in Scott’s prequels
         




Speaking to the KCRW’s The Business podcast, the showrunner said he didn’t want to borrow much from Scott’s sleek Alien prequels and their mythology as they weren&#39;t relevant to his project. Per Hawley, “The idea that, on some level, [the Xenomorph] was a bioweapon created half an hour ago, that’s just inherently less useful to me.” This means that Hawley’s show is unlikely to focus on the Engineers, the race of aliens that canonically created humanity, and the android David, who developed the original Xenomorph while experimenting with new bioweapons. This is a wise choice for numerous reasons.


 

While the upcoming Alien: Romulus could address these elements of the franchise’s storyline, Hawley’s FX show is better served by a more streamlined story. Hawley noted in an interview with Vanity Fair that the original heroes of Alien were “Blue-collar space truckers,” saying that they were “ordered to go to a place by a faceless nameless corporation.” This allowed the original Alien movies to satirize the greed of amoral corporations, something that was lost when Scott’s prequels began to focus on existential questions of creation and destruction. Hawley is right to note that David’s antics aren’t relevant to his story.






 What FX’s Alien Show Ignoring Prometheus &amp; Covenant Means For The Franchise 
Dropping the prequel storyline brings FX’s Alien show back to basics
          

Not only can Hawley bring back the thematic preoccupations of the earlier movies by ignoring Scott’s prequels but, on a more practical level, his FX show can also revive the retro-futuristic look of Alien and Aliens. Alien’s TV show can return to the original movie’s aesthetic by dropping the sleekness of Prometheus and bringing back the grittiness of Scott’s 1979 hit. Hawley’s Alien show will center the class conflict that was central to the original movies, but his KCRW interview also saw him say “I prefer the retro-futurism of the first two films.&#34; Hawley went on to clarify that there would be no holograms in his show.



While David’s Alien prequel storyline still deserves a conclusion since it ended so abruptly, it is nonetheless a good thing that Hawley’s show will ignore Scott&#39;s plotline.







This might seem like merely an aesthetic shift, but it is quietly indicative of the show’s ideas. Unlike Scott’s prequels, which had a glossy, slick look, the best Alien movies featured what Hawley calls “Giant computer monitors” and “Weird keyboards.” Since Hawley’s show will focus on the hardscrabble lives of working-class space truckers, the series has no reason to prioritize the sophisticated, glamorous tech seen in Prometheus. While Alien: Covenant toned down these distractingly expensive, stylish flourishes, both prequels betrayed the gritty, grimy realism of the original movie with this stylistic change.



 Why Alien&#39;s TV Show Ignoring Prometheus &amp; Covenant Would Be A Good Thing

While David’s Alien prequel storyline still deserves a conclusion since it ended so abruptly, it is nonetheless a good thing that Hawley’s show will ignore Scott&#39;s plotline. After all, attempting to graft such a complicated storyline into the new show would have inevitably overshadowed its own plot, since Prometheus and Alien: Covenant introduced viewers to a complex, immersive fictional world. If Hawley’s show had focused on David’s fate, the series would have felt like a continuation of Scott’s story instead of a new talent’s fresh perspective on the franchise. As is, dropping the storyline reaffirms that the FX show is its own beast.




Prometheus’s plot attempted to explain the origins of humanity&#39;s existence, while Alien: Covenant demystified the Xenomorphs via David’s experiments. In contrast, FX’s Alien TV show could fix both these issues simply by avoiding the prequel storyline. If the series treats the Xenomorph as a lethal force of nature exploited by the uncaring capitalists at Weyland-Yutani, as Alien and Aliens did, the show can recapture the original appeal of the franchise. If, like the prequels, the series gets into the specifics of Xenomorph’s history as a species, its plotting is more likely to become tiresome and over-ambitious.



 Will Alien: Romulus Ignore Ridley Scott’s Alien Prequels Too? 
Alien: Romulus seems unlikely to link up with Scott&#39;s prequel storyline
          

Since the Alien TV show won’t continue the storyline of the prequels, viewers could reasonably assume that Romulus will do so. However, the news that Alien: Romulus is set between Alien and Aliens means that the standalone movie is unlikely to address the prequels. It is not yet clear whether Alien: Romulus will acknowledge Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, but this would undeniably complicate its storyline. This will most likely come down to what the filmmaker envisions for the project, and the fact that Romulus director Fede Alvarez has a solid track record with lone-location horror movies makes it unlikely.




Alien: Romulus is more exciting than another Ridley Scott prequel. After Scott’s prequels attempted to explain the existence of Xenomorphs and the birth of humanity, Alien: Romulus simply promises a fun horror adventure in the vein of the first two movies in the series. 2013’s Evil Dead saw Alvarez successfully reboot a famous franchise by ignoring its preceding movies and focusing entirely on scares. As such, the odds are good that his Alien sequel will see him repeat this approach, much like Hawley’s TV show will avoid the endless lore of the prequels.
