## Literature Review

Angelina Jolie&#39;s thriller film from 2021 finds renewed success on Netflix, landing on this week&#39;s list of the streamer&#39;s global top 10 movies.




Angelina Jolie&#39;s thriller film from 2021 finds success on Netflix, landing on this week&#39;s list of the streamer&#39;s global top 10 movies. Jolie became a worldwide superstar thanks to films like Tomb Raider, Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Maleficent. In 2021, she added her star power to a relatively low-profile thriller movie, headlining as a survival expert protecting a young murder witness from assassins, while also facing down the looming threat of a forest fire.




Jolie’s thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead was not a huge smash when it released, grossing just $23 million worldwide, but the movie is now a hit on Netflix, landing at number 8 on the streamer&#39;s top 10 global movies list for January 1 - January 7, 2024. The film logged 8 million views according to Netflix&#39;s own data.


 Is Those Who Wish Me Dead Part Of The Sheridanverse 
          

Along with the presence of Jolie at the top of the cast, Those Who Wish Me Dead is notable for being directed by Taylor Sheridan, the man responsible for Paramount&#43;’s hit show Yellowstone and its various Dutton-family spinoffs, known collectively as the Sheridanverse. While it would be cool to think of Jolie as also being a part of the Sheridanverse, Those Who Wish Me Dead is not known to be directly connected to Yellowstone or its prequels 1883 and 1923, and therefore does not qualify for inclusion in that shared universe.






Lawman: Bass Reeves is not officially part of the Sheridanverse, despite being conceived as an 1883 spinoff.




It’s possible, of course, that some connection could ultimately be confirmed between Those Who Wish Me Dead and the Sheridanverse. The movie does indeed take place in Montana, the same state where Yellowstone is set, so perhaps there is a hidden Dutton family connection there after all. For now though, 2021’s Jolie-starring thriller has to qualify as a standalone Sheridan project, putting it in the same category as shows like Tulsa King, Mayor of Kingstown and Special Ops: Lioness. Perhaps one day in the future, Jolie will sign on for a true Sheridanverse project, as have movie stars like Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner.
