## Literature Review

The first Abigail trailer has been released by Universal, revealing the new horror movie from the directors behind Ready or Not and Scream 6.

The first Abigail trailer has been released. The upcoming movie from directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, the filmmaking team behind Ready or Not and the two most recent Scream movies, spent its production process shrouded in secrecy. Known to be part of the recent string of movies based on the classic Universal Monsters, it was reported to be based on the 1936 movie Dracula&#39;s Daughter and follow an attempted kidnapping that goes very, very wrong.

Now, a new trailer from Universal Pictures reveals the first concrete details ahead of Abigail&#39;s release date, set for April 19. Check it out below:

The trailer follows the kidnapping, introducing the group of young people charged with keeping the titular girl imprisoned. It gets especially eerie after a moment of bonding between Abigail and her captor Joey, where the young girl says, &#34;*I&#39;m sorry about what&#39;s gonna happen to you.*&#34; The trailer also offers a glimpse at Abigail taking on a vampiric form, roaring with a mouthful of sharp fangs.

## Everything The Abigail Trailer Reveals About The Movie

The *Abigail* trailer indeed confirms that the title character is a vampire, but that seems to be its only direct connection to the original *Dracula&#39;s Daughter*. That movie followed the adult vampire Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden) and doesn&#39;t seem to have any direct connection to the plot elements revealed in the trailer. If *Abigail* is indeed an update on that classic sequel to 1931&#39;s *Dracula*, it is as loose a remake as the 2020 *The Invisible Man*, which was a critical and commercial hit.



# NOTE

*The Invisible Man* made $144.5 million off a budget of just $7 million and earned a Certified Fresh score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.



In addition to reuniting the collective Radio Silence (which includes Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett) with their Scream and Scream 6 star Melissa Barrera, Abigail is a return to the tone of their movie Ready or Not. This is captured in the spooky elegance of the movie&#39;s mansion setting, as well as the way genuine horror is combined with sly comedy. While the setup presents pure classical horror, as the team of mismatched criminals attempts to fight back, their reactions to the vampire in their midst swing toward comedy, including a joke assessing whether Abigail is an &#34;Anne Rice vampire.&#34;

The *Abigail* trailer showcases the way it mixes old and new, seemingly effortlessly. In addition to the blend of tones reminiscent of James Whale&#39;s classic horror comedy The Old Dark House, but with a dash of modern meta humor, the cast of modern genre stars livens up the traditional horror tropes. This includes Barrera, The Guest&#39;s Dan Stevens, The Strain&#39;s Kevin Durand, and Freaky star Kathryn Newton, who can also be seen in the upcoming Lisa Frankenstein.
