# Lord Of The Rings Art Imagines Middle-Earth In LEGO Form


## SUMMARY 



  New art imagines key The Lord of the Rings characters and locations in LEGO form, including Sauron, Frodo, The Shire, and Rivendell.   The Lord of the Rings&#39; cast and Peter Jackson&#39;s rendition of Middle-earth are so memorable that it might make it challenging for a LEGO reimagining to work.   As shown with The LEGO Batman Movie and The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special, however, beloved IP getting the LEGO treatment can make for a funny watch.

## Literature Review

A new batch of AI-generated images imagines the world of Middle-earth and key The Lord of the Rings characters, including Sauron, in LEGO form.




The Lord of the Rings art reimagines the fantastical world of Middle-earth in LEGO form, and the results are very charming. Serving as an adaptation of the beloved novels by J.R.R. Tolkien, Peter Jackson&#39;s acclaimed The Lord of the Rings trilogy was released from 2001 to 2003. The three films chronicle Frodo&#39;s (Elijah Wood) quest to destroy the One Ring, with the Hobbit and his companions traveling across the magical and dangerous land of Middle-earth.




Now, @mordor.tr on Instagram shares a new batch of AI-generated images imagining what The Lord of the Rings&#39; Middle-earth would look like if it were brought to life using LEGO. Check out the images below:


 

In addition to featuring LEGO versions of locations like the Shire, Rivendell, and Moria, the images also portray what characters like Sauron, Aragorn, and Frodo might look like if they made the jump from live-action to LEGO form.

  


 Would A LEGO Lord Of The Rings Movie Work? 
          




In recent years, LEGO versions of popular IP have found success, either on the big screen or on streaming. The LEGO Batman movie, for example, brought a comedic twist to the brooding hero, while The LEGO Star Wars Holiday Special told a self-contained holiday-themed story in a galaxy far, far, away.

While these projects proved successful, there&#39;s some question as to whether Tolkien&#39;s world and characters would be a good fit for the LEGO treatment. For one, The Lord of the Rings cast is such a big reason for the films&#39; success, and actors like Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, and John Rhys-Davies, among many others, are now forever inseparable from the characters they played. Without this talent and, specifically, their on-screen personas, it&#39;s not clear if Frodo&#39;s story in LEGO form would work as well.

What&#39;s more, the world of Middle-earth is rendered so beautifully in Jackson&#39;s films, due in no small part to the sweeping landscapes of New Zealand, that a LEGO version would struggle to compare. That being said, The Lord of the Rings is now so well-known and familiar that it could lend itself well to a comedic reimagining, something that The LEGO Batman Movie did effectively. Instead of a full movie, however, a LEGO take on The Lord of the Rings might work best if presented as a standalone special separate from the most familiar elements of Frodo&#39;s quest.
