## Literature Review

Oppenheimer&#39;s streaming release date is finally confirmed as Christopher Nolan&#39;s epic biopic is coming to Peacock just prior to the Oscars.




As the race heats up for the Oscars, Oppenheimer&#39;s streaming release date has finally been confirmed. Christopher Nolan&#39;s biopic was one of the most talked-about movies of 2023, in part thanks to its wide ensemble cast including everybody from Cillian Murphy in the titular role to Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh. Its other major source of viral popularity was its box office competition of Margot Robbie&#39;s Barbie, inspiring the Barbenheimer moniker, with both movies garnering rave reviews and strong financial numbers, though Nolan&#39;s movie would ultimately fall to second.




With just over half of a year gone since it hit theaters, Universal has announced that Oppenheimer will begin streaming on Peacock on February 16. In addition to the buzzy biopic, the streaming platform will include multiple Nolan movies beginning February 1, including the full Dark Knight Trilogy, Dunkirk, Inception and Memento. The streaming release date comes as Oppenheimer gears up for the Oscars season, having just won five of its eight Golden Globe nominations.


 Oppenheimer Could Be Peacock&#39;s Biggest Movie Yet 
         

In the three years since it launched, Peacock has been steadily gaining ground in the streaming landscape, particularly with such original titles as Rian Johnson&#39;s Poker Face and the long-gestating adaptation of Twisted Metal, among others. Their ownership of NBCUniversal has been one of their biggest keys in the expansion of their library, however, bringing in such major titles like The Super Mario Bros. Movie, whose $1.36 billion success has carried well over to its viewership on both it and its recent move to Netflix.




With Oppenheimer now coming to the platform, Peacock could see one of its biggest boosts yet. Though it may not have achieved the same level of success as Barbie or The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the Nolan-helmed biopic was still one of 2023&#39;s biggest hits, landing third on the year&#39;s highest-grossing movies chart and becoming the second-highest-grossing R-rated movie of all-time behind Todd Phillips&#39; Joker. Given Nolan in general is a big draw for audiences in theaters and on streaming platforms, it seems likely those who didn&#39;t catch the movie in theaters will be keen to when it arrives on Peacock.

The other big factor that could see Oppenheimer result in a big push for Peacock viewership is the streaming date coming in the middle of awards season. Even prior to its theatrical release, the movie was being hailed as a major contender for every major award, and with it now having won over half of its Golden Globe nominations, its Oscars chances seem even more cemented, making it even more probable that those who saw the movie in theaters would want to revisit it prior to the Academy Awards in order to show it some extra support before it goes up against its competition.
