## Literature Review

Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s became a huge hit thanks to the iconic villains, and a clever marketing video shows the animatronic exoskeletons.




The 2023 Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie adaptation brought the video game antagonists to the big screen, and a clever teaser showed how the animatronic exoskeletons came to life. The video game series is known for its unique blend of suspense and jump scares, and the movie features that same eerie atmosphere. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s massive box-office success was a result of drawing in both fans of the game and newcomers to the franchise, and despite poor critical reviews, Mike Schmidt actor Josh Hutcherson confirmed that Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is officially in development.




At the heart of the franchise are the animatronics, the robotic antagonists from the game that terrorize the main characters in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s. These villains, led by Freddy Fazbear (Kevin Foster) and originally designed as innocent entertainment for a fictional pizza restaurant, turn sinister as night falls. The animatronics have become famous in the horror genre, making them central to the movie&#39;s appeal. The way the mechanical beings are portrayed, oscillating between lifeless entertainment robots and menacing creatures, has been a critical factor in the film&#39;s allure, and a clever promotional video showed the animatronic endoskeletons underneath the fur.

 The Animatronics Endoskeleton Teaser Was A Promo For Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 
          




In October 2023, the marketing team behind the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie unveiled an ingenious 30-second teaser trailer. This teaser provided the first glimpse into the animatronic endoskeletons, a core element of the story. The ad, formatted as a security training video for Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza – the central location of the video game – showcases the design of the undressed animatronic endoskeletons. These structures form the basis for the animal robots that become the source of terror at night. The authenticity in recreating these endoskeletons, almost identical to their video game counterparts, adds a layer of nostalgia, horror, and humor appealing to both fans and newcomers.

This promotional strategy involved an interactive element, wherein the teaser was sent to users who texted the number 1-833-578-0158, as advertised on the show’s Twitter page (via Collider). Fans were encouraged to text &#34;apply&#34; to the number as if they were applying for the role of night shift security guard at the pizzeria. The ad&#39;s effectiveness lies in its understanding of the game&#39;s appeal and the ability to intrigue and unsettle viewers, setting the tone for what to expect from the movie. It cleverly acts as in-movie material and expands the world of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s while providing original footage not found in the movie.





 



 How The Animatronics Endoskeleton Made Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s A Hit PG-13 Horror Movie 
          

The animatronics&#39; endoskeletons in the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie play a pivotal role in crafting the film’s chilling atmosphere. These skeletal structures, hidden beneath the seemingly innocuous exterior of the animatronics, bring a new level of creepiness to the movie. Their appearance strikes a balance between mechanical and sinister, contributing significantly to the horror without relying on R-rated gore. This subtlety in design enables the film to maintain a PG-13 rating while still delivering a genuinely frightening experience. The filmmakers&#39; decision to focus on psychological horror and suspense, rather than explicit violence, broadens the movie&#39;s appeal and allows it to tap into a broader audience.




By using the animatronics&#39; endoskeletons instead of graphically violent scenes to creep out audiences, the movie cemented a PG-13 rating, thus leading to a box office gross of $289.3 million worldwide (via Box Office Mojo) against a relatively low budget of $20 million. This strategic use of the endoskeletons not only pays homage to the source material but also elevates the film within its genre. The endoskeletons&#39; role in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s showcases how effective horror can be achieved through careful design and thoughtful integration of elements, proving that a movie can be terrifying and successful without resorting to graphic content.
