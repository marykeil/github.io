## Literature Review

The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes scores have solidified, and the movie broke records for a Jason Statham action movie franchise starter with them.




The Beekeeper is meant to be a new franchise starter for Jason Statham, and the action movie broke an 18-year Rotten Tomatoes record for the actor in that regard. The 2024 film is the latest attempt from Statham to create successful action franchises. He has always kept a focus on being part of action movies, whether they are standalone adventures or part of existing franchises like Fast &amp; Furious. Jason Statham is no stranger to action franchises as a result, but they have not always been that well-received, even when they have performed well at the box office.




Given his track record, David Ayer&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes history, and an early January release date, The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes score could have gone in various directions. The movie has now settled into the range that it should have consistently. The Beekeeper earned mostly positive reviews from critics thanks to its throwback action movie nature, resulting in a 69% Fresh score. Audiences have enjoyed the movie even more, as a 93% score is where the movie sits at the time of this writing. The two positive scores for The Beekeeper is a huge win for Jason Statham&#39;s career.

It is thanks to the critical and general response to The Beekeeper that the movie now holds a Jason Statham record on Rotten Tomatoes. Both the audience and critic scores are career bests for a Jason Statham franchise starter. He has headlined a number of first entries in future franchises, such as The Expendables or Meg. However, none of the other first installments in future or hopeful franchises can boast Rotten Tomatoes scores as good as The Beekeeper, allowing it to set new career highs for Jason Statham in this category.

The Beekeeper&#39;s &#34;Fresh&#34; Rotten Tomatoes scores helped Jason Statham break records that his earliest action franchises set. The Transporter had his best audience score on Rotten Tomatoes for 22 years, while Crank was the best-reviewed franchise starter of his career for 18 years. The Beekeeper now becomes only the second time a Jason Statham action movie franchise has started with a movie that received &#34;Fresh&#34; scores from audiences and critics alike. In doing so, the action star has set a new bar for any potential future franchise starters to try and live up to.

Now, The Beekeeper 2 will have to try and match these high Rotten Tomatoes scores.
