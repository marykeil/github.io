## Literature Review

New romantic comedy film Anyone But You passes a key global box office milestone while competing against a strong lineup of December releases.




The romantic comedy film Anyone But You surpasses a global milestone as the December box office brings impressive competition. Starring Glen Powell and Euphoria’s Sydney Sweeney, Anyone But You sees its once-dating protagonists unexpectedly reunited at a destination wedding after things had quickly gone south in their relationship. In an unexpected twist, the two pretend to be a couple. Anyone But You is receiving mixed reviews so far as it continues its theatrical run.




As 2023 comes to a close, Anyone But You finishes out the year by passing a box office milestone. According to Collider, Anyone But You crossed $6 million overseas as it rolled out to 14 international markets. This brings the film’s total box office to $33 million (including New Years’ Day projections), which means that Anyone But You has already made back its estimated $25 million budget.

During its first week (December 22–December 28), Anyone But You just made it into the top 5 at the box office. Topping the list for that week were, in order, Migration, Wonka, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, and The Color Purple. Anyone But You is expected to just miss the top five during its second weekend.

As it continues its run, Anyone But You faces a stacked lineup of box office competitors. Both Wonka and The Color Purple are surprise hits for the end of the year, with The Color Purple delivering one of the strongest Christmas Day openings of all time. Even with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is underperforming, it is still of a higher profile than Anyone But You, likely ousting it from the top 5.

Anyone But You has shown an impressive run for a romantic comedy amid stiff box office competition. Anyone But You still has the chance to demonstrate strong international staying power as the film soon hits key additional markets including Germany, Mexico, Spain, France, Brazil, and Italy. Hopefully, it will continue on its momentum even in the face of the impressive Wonka and The Color Purple.
