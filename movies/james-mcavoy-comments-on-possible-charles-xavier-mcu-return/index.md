## Literature Review

Amid all the X-Men returns in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, James McAvoy comments on possibly coming back as Charles Xavier for another movie.




James McAvoy comments on the chances of him coming back as Charles Xavier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. McAvoy played the second version of the Fox X-Men franchise&#39;s Charles Xavier, with the actor starring opposite Michael Fassbender&#39;s Magneto in the younger X-Men movie continuity. McAvoy&#39;s last time as Professor X was in 2019&#39;s Dark Phoenix.




Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, McAvoy played coy about his possible return as Professor X for another Marvel movie.


 

McAvoy claimed he has had no contact with Marvel, while interestingly saying, &#34;Anything I say will get me in trouble.&#34; Patrick Stewart, the original Charles Xavier from Fox&#39;s X-Men movies, already returned as a multiverse variant of the character in the MCU&#39;s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which opened the door for McAvoy&#39;s return. Check out the full quote below:


&#34;Anything I say will get me in trouble ... I&#39;ve had no contact with them. If they want me to come back, they need to talk to me and need a good script ... I&#39;m not saying anything.&#34;

 How Could James McAvoy’s Charles Xavier Join The MCU? 
          

There are a few ways for McAvoy to come back as Charles Xavier in the MCU. Much like Stewart did, McAvoy could return as a different version of Professor X from the one he played in Fox&#39;s X-Men movies. Having the actor and other stars of the younger X-Men movie timeline return for a final adventure, just like what has been happening with actors from Fox&#39;s original X-Men movies, would make sense.

Deadpool 3, the MCU&#39;s only 2024 movie, is rumored to feature several actors from Fox&#39;s X-Men movies. While the rumored stars are from the original X-Men movie timeline — James Marsden&#39;s Cyclops, Halle Berry&#39;s Storm, and more — that does not mean that McAvoy, Fassbender, and other younger X-Men stars are out of the question. Deadpool 3 should be a multiversal road trip, and showing both sides of Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise would fit the film&#39;s teased plot and Deadpool&#39;s brand of humor nicely.




If McAvoy is not in Deadpool 3, the actor could return as Charles Xavier in one of the two upcoming Avengers movies. As the Multiverse Saga&#39;s finale, Avengers: Secret Wars seems the most likely option for McAvoy&#39;s possible MCU debut. The movie should feature several heroes from all over Marvel&#39;s live-action history, and including McAvoy and other fan-favorite actors would be fitting. The last and least likely option for James McAvoy to return as Charles Xavier would be for him to become the main Professor X of the MCU, though Marvel Studios is likely starting fresh with its version of the X-Men.
