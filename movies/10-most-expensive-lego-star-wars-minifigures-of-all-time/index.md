# 10 Most Expensive LEGO Star Wars Minifigures Of All Time


## SUMMARY 


 Some LEGO Star Wars minifigures are more valuable than the sets they came in, with prices far exceeding the original retail price. 
 Rarity and exclusivity contribute to the high value of certain minifigures, such as the Darker-Haired Kanan Jarrus and the Shadow ARF Trooper. 
 Figures from retired sets like the Cloud City model such as Boba Fett and promotional giveaways like the Chrome Gold C-3PO can fetch incredibly high prices among collectors.

## Literature Review

Not all Star Wars LEGO minifigures are created equal, as some are much more exclusive and valuable than others on the secondary market from resellers.




Not all LEGO Star Wars minifigures are equal as some are far more expensive than others. Although there are a good number of whole LEGO sets with very high price tags, certain minifigures can become so valuable and coveted that they alone can far exceed the price of the model they originally came with. This is especially true of minifigures inspired by the galaxy far, far away with a wide range of characters spanning the entire Star Wars canon and timeline.
Currently, there are just over 1,300 unique LEGO Star Wars minifigures released since the start of the product line back in 1999. In 25 years, several figures have risen in value due to various levels of rarity and popularity across secondary markets such as eBay and the LEGO-specific marketplace known as BrickLink. While not every minifigure can be purchased to then be turned around for a bigger profit later on, there&#39;s a good number of minifigures that have achieved incredible value for collectors looking to sell and invest (or to just keep). To that end, here are the top 10 most expensive LEGO Star Wars minifigures of all time.
Information and values come from BrickEconomy.com&#39;s dedicated minifigure database. 

            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.












 








 10  Darker Haired Kanan Jarrus (The Ghost) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Kanan Jarrus   sw0577   $378.44   2014    
Having been featured in 2014&#39;s The Ghost (75053), Kanan Jarrus is a leading character in Star Wars Rebels. However, this version of Kanan was only featured in this single set with an original retail price of $89.99. However, what makes this particular version of Kanan so valuable is the darker hair and eyebrows compared to reissues of the set and minifigure which gave him a lighter brown color instead, adding to the rarity and overall value of the character as the 10th most expensive LEGO Star Wars minifigure ever.
An updated version of The Ghost model (75357) is currently being sold by LEGO. 






 9  Shadow ARF Trooper 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Shadow ARF Trooper   sw0315   $429.68   2011    
The Shadow ARF Trooper minifigure was part of a promotional polybag giveaway for LEGO&#39;s 2011 May 4th event celebrating the Star Wars franchise. As such, the minifigure was exclusive to those who spent enough money online to earn the giveaway that has since grown in value exponentially in the years since.





 8  Princess Leia (Tantive IV) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Princess Leia   sw0175a   $457.85   2009    
Future and updated versions of Princess Leia have been released by LEGO in the years since 2009. However, this particular version of Princess Leia Organa from A New Hope was exclusive to 2009&#39;s Tantive IV (10198), making the character a valuable addition to collections due to its rarity with the smooth hair-piece (compared to others that feature more texture).





 7  Darth Vader (Chrome Black) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Darth Vader   sw0218   $487.24   2009    
The Chrome Black Darth Vader minifigure was another LEGO promotional exclusive back in 2009. In honor of LEGO Star Wars&#39; 10th anniversary, only 10,000 Chrome Darth Vader figures were created. They were then inserted at random into various LEGO Star Wars sets that year. Some were also given away as promotional giveaways in a select number of LEGO stores.





 6  Jango Fett (Jango Fett&#39;s Slave I) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Jango Fett   sw0053   $494.16   2002    
Released with Jango Fett&#39;s Slave I (7173) back in 2002, the Jango Fett minifigure features LEGO&#39;s original design for Mandalorian helmets where the black color of the visitor came from the black headpiece instead (commonly referred to by LEGO and collectors as the balaclava style). Seeing how future versions would abandon this style and this version only came in the aforementioned set, it makes sense why this figure&#39;s value has risen to such heights in the following decades.

 Every Confirmed Star Wars LEGO Set Releasing In 2024 
It&#39;s the 25th anniversary of LEGO&#39;s always-popular Star Wars line, so here&#39;s every confirmed set releasing in 2024 (that we know about so far).








 5  Lando Calrissian (Cloud City) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Lando Calrissian   sw0105   $528.34   2003    
As a figure belonging to one of the most expensive LEGO Star Wars sets of all time on the secondary market, it&#39;s only logical that Lando Calrissian (sw0105) would also be quite valuable as well. Having an average value between $8,708 and $9,940 according to BrickEconomy, sealed models of Cloud City (10123) are incredibly valuable and coveted by collectors, and this includes their figures such as Lando and other figures from the model who&#39;ve become more expensive than Lando himself.





 4  Luke Skywalker (Cloud City) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Luke Skywalker   sw0103   $556.19   2003    
Luke Skywalker (sw0103) also came from Cloud City (10123), explaining his high value since 2003. Dressed in the tan jumpsuit he wore in Empire Strikes Back, this version of Luke still had the yellow head and hands, having been made before LEGO decided to give all minifigures from various licenses their characters&#39; actual flesh tones.





 3  Finch Dallow (Resistance Pilot) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Finch Dallow   sw1005   $994.43   2018    
While it may seem odd, Finch Dallow being the third most expensive LEGO Star Wars of all time all comes down to rarity. Originally, Resistance Bomber (75188) came with a more generic Resistance pilot. However, reissues of the set came with Finch Dallow instead, a character who was actually in the Resistance bomber scene from The Last Jedi. That said, the reissued set wasn&#39;t on shelves long before the model ultimately retired, making the figure incredibly rare.





 2  Boba Fett (Cloud City) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    Boba Fett   sw0107   $2,799.96   2003    
Featuring the original balaclava helmet style just like Jango Fett, Boba Fett (sw0107) is the most expensive figure from LEGO Star Wars&#39; most expensive set (Cloud City). A &#34;Cloud City Boba Fett&#34; is the metaphorical white whale of many LEGO collectors with his uniquely printed arms and legs, explaining why its average value is just under $2,800 when the original set had a retail price of just $100.





 1  C-3PO (Chrome Gold) 
        

  Name   ID   Avg Value   Release Date    C-3PO   sw0158   $3,100.58   2007    
The most expensive LEGO Star Wars minifigure of all time is currently a chrome gold figure of C-3PO. Valued at just over $3000, this gold-plated Threepio was similar to the Chrome Darth Vader, a promotional giveaway celebrating Star Wars&#39; 30th anniversary where only 10,000 were made and then randomly inserted in various sets that year. On the secondary markets, sealed chrome gold C-3POs can go anywhere between $2,818 and $5,129.
