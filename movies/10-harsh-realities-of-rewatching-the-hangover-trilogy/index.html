The success of The Hangover trilogy helped reshape Todd Philips&rsquo; career as a comedy director.
Zach Galifianakis admitted that one Hangover movie was enough and that ending the franchise sooner was the right decision.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Hangover trilogy were some of the most commercially successful comedies of the last few decades, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they have aged well since.</p>
<p>Although The Hangover trilogy is fondly remembered as one of the best comedy franchises in recent years, re-watching the movies proves they had their fair share of flaws. The Hangover was a commercial juggernaut but, surprisingly for an R-rated comedy movie, the movie also proved a success with critics. Upon its 2009 release, reviewers raved about the perfect comedic chemistry shared by The Hangover’s cast, its inventive and original premise, and its superb pacing. Even over a decade later, it is still easy to see these qualities when re-watching the original movie.
However, The Hangover trilogy’s later installments didn’t fare quite so well with critics. Between them, the three Hangover moviesearned over $1 billion at the box office. However, the third movie in the trilogy made far less than the second, and the second movie’s reviews were nowhere near as positive as the original. The Hangover managed to wring three movies out of the franchise’s simple premise, but returning to this conceit soon resulted in diminishing returns. Not only that, but re-watching the movies uncovers some big issues that were ignored by fans and critics alike at the time.

<p>10  The Hangover’s Supporting Characters Needed Smaller Roles
Alan and Mr. Chow Were Funnier In Small Doses</p>
<p>Zach Galifianakis’s Alan and Ken Jeong’s Mr. Chow were inarguably the breakout stars of The Hangover and both comedic actors managed to parlay this success into bigger roles in the decade that followed. Unfortunately, while Galifianakis and Jeong’s career profiles rose, the limited potential of their characters in The Hangover trilogy stayed stagnant. Both stars were much funnier in the first movie, where they had fewer lines and a smaller role in the story. As their screen time increased, it became clear that The Hangover sequels were over-relying on the original movie’s surprise stars.</p>
<p>9  Todd Philips’ Career Needed The Hangover Trilogy
The Movies Reshaped The Joker Director&rsquo;s Prospects</p>
<p>Since he is now best known as the director of Oscar-winning Joker, it is tough to recall a time when Todd Philips was seen as nothing more than a comedy director. However, in 2009, the Old School filmmaker was viewed as just that and not a particularly promising comedy director at that. The expensive failure of Starsky and Hutch and his clash with Sacha Baron Cohen during the making of Borat had left Philips on the outs in Hollywood. He needed The Hangover to be a huge success, and the trilogy more than delivered.</p>
<p>8  Zach Galifianakis Is Right About The Hangover Trilogy
The Star Later Admitted That One Movie Was Enough</p>
<p>On WTF With Marc Maron, Galifianakis admitted that he now wishes he had only made The Hangover and not its sequels. The star conceded that making the movies was a fun time but also added that sometimes it is best to leave well enough alone. Critics certainly agreed, with neither The Hangover Part II nor The Hangover Part III ever regaining the original movie’s surprisingly positive reviews. While Galifianakis does have a hilarious idea for The Hangover 4, it still seems like he was right about ending the franchise sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>7  The Hangover Ended A Comedy Era Instead of Starting One
The Hangover&rsquo;s Frat Bro Comedy Didn&rsquo;t Catch On</p>
<p>The era of frat bro comedy movies was already starting to end circa 2009 thanks to high-profile flops like Miss March and I Hope They Serve Beer In Hell. While it was a huge hit, The Hangover was the last of the major mainstream bro comedies for a long time outside rare outliers like Neighbors and Tag. However, the likes of Bridesmaids and Bachelorette did successfully subvert the sub-genre&rsquo;s formula. While The Hangover seemed like it would spawn countless copies, the movie instead accidentally marked the end of an era with its success.</p>
<p>6  The Hangover’s Casual Homophobia Is Hard To Stomach
The Hangover&rsquo;s Quotes Haven&rsquo;t Aged Well</p>
<p>While critics were hard on the sequels, re-watching The Hangover proves the original movie isn’t without its flaws. Maybe the most notable of these is the casual homophobia present in lines like the now infamous quote “Paging Dr. ******.” While this was a lot less shocking in 2009, it isn’t portrayed as anything more than harmlessly crass and this makes it tough to see the movie’s heroes as ill-behaved but essentially decent and heroic everymen now.</p>
<p>5  The Hangover Part II Is The Franchise’s Weakest Movie
The Sequel Didn&rsquo;t Recreate The Original Movie&rsquo;s Charm</p>
<p>Although The Hangover Part III has plenty of problems, the sequel’s action thriller tone and storyline are at least a welcome change of pace for the series. In contrast, The Hangover Part II has almost nothing going for it on a re-watch. Seeing Alan envisioning himself and the rest of the Wolf Pack as children in his mind is an inspired gag, but this alone can’t stop the sequel from feeling like a rehash of the original movie. The main issue is the failure to find a new plot, resulting in The Hangover Part II revisiting the original movie’s story.</p>
<p>4  The Hangover Movies Wasted Justin Bartha
The Supporting Star Was Mainly A Human Prop</p>
<p>While Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Galifianakis were great in The Hangover trilogy, Justin Bartha was criminally wasted by the series. The photos at the end of The Hangover movies were where Bartha got most of his screen time, but the star&rsquo;s career before and since his roles in the series has proven that he has solid comedy chops. Unfortunately, these were underutilized thanks to the franchise’s reliance on its familiar formula.</p>
<p>3  The Hangover Part III’s Genre Shift Didn’t Work
The Dark Turn Into Thriller Territory Failed</p>
<p>While it is impressive that The Hangover Part III tried to do something new with the series, turning the franchise into a dark, surprisingly bloody action thriller was a bit over the top. The best moments of The Hangover Part III come from the comedic riffing between the lead actors, and this just highlights how out of place the darker story elements feel. That said, John Goodman is typically superb as the sequel’s villain.</p>
<p>2  The Hangover Part III Took Alan Too Seriously
Zach Galifianakis’s Comic Relief Didn&rsquo;t Need A Character Arc</p>
<p>The main problem with The Hangover Part III is its insistence on delving into the psychology of Alan.</p>
<p>Since the success of Joker proved that Philips could make a successful psychological thriller, it is clear that The Hangover Part III has issues beyond its tonal shift. The main problem with The Hangover Part III is its insistence on delving into the psychology of Alan. In the original movie, Alan is an inherently silly, over-the-top character who needs no backstory or explanation. However, his anarchic edge was shaved down by The Hangover Part III’s attempts to psycho-analyze him and make this bizarre figure feel more human.</p>
<p>1  The Hangover Part II’s Transphobia Is Atrocious
The Sequel&rsquo;s Worst Gag Is An Appalling Low Point</p>
<p>The Hangover Part II features an extended scene wherein the entire comedic premise is that one of the characters unknowingly had sex with a trans person. While everything from Ace Ventura to South Park’s worst transphobic jokes proves that this is nothing new, this is still an unfunny low point for the franchise. A room full of supposedly relatable characters gagging at the notion of romancing a trans person makes this the most misguided and regrettable moment in The Hangover trilogy.</p>
