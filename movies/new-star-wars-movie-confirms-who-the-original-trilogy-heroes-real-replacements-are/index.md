## Literature Review

Star Wars&#39; return to the big screen confirms the characters who are really replacing the original trilogy heroes (and it&#39;s not the sequel trio).




Star Wars&#39; has chosen The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu to herald the franchise&#39;s long-awaited return to theaters, proving who the original trilogy heroes&#39; true replacements are. While Disney and Lucasfilm made sequel films with a brand-new collection of heroes (and even a core trio), the sequel trilogy itself is nothing if not controversial. Conversely, Lucasfilm&#39;s streaming shows have laid the groundwork for even bigger stars on the big screen.




In 2023, Lucasfilm announced three new upcoming Star Wars movies in development. This included a film set 25,000 years in the past revealing the first Jedi from director James Mangold, a New Jedi Order movie with Rey Skywalker from director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, and a New Republic crossover movie that will culminate The Mandalorian series and its spin-off shows in one epic movie from Lucasfilm&#39;s Dave Filoni. However, the newest announcement that Jon Favreau will be directing The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu either before or instead of a fourth season communicates volumes about the current state of the Star Wars franchise.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Din Djarin &amp; Grogu Are The New Faces Of The Star Wars Franchise Now 
It&#39;s No Coincidence They&#39;re Bringing The Franchise Back To Theaters
          




The fact that Lucasfilm has chosen The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu as their big return to the theaters since the sequels makes sense. Beyond the previous three films announced, this one is easily the safest and most bankable by leaps and bounds. Unfortunately, Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie is already building controversy due to comments from its director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy (especially those that have been unfairly taken out of context). James Mangold&#39;s Dawn of the Jedi movie will venture into bold and untested territory. Likewise, Filoni&#39;s movie is quite ambitious and will likely require more time, money, and further shows before it comes to theaters.

In contrast, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be about extremely popular characters whom audiences already know and love. Massive merchandise sales are practically guaranteed thanks to the money train that is Grogu aka &#34;Baby Yoda&#34;, and Pedro Pascal currently holds some of the most star power in all of Hollywood. It might not be the most creatively ambitious project Lucasfilm has ever done, but going with The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is the most logical decision, promising the most success right out the gate with the return to the theaters. It also further confirms that Din Djarin and his newly adopted son truly are the biggest faces of the Star Wars franchise.






 The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Mean Bringing Back OT Heroes Is Less Necessary 
They Truly Are Leading The Galaxy Far, Far Away
          

Din Djarin and Grogu leading the charge and bringing Star Wars back to theaters also means that there&#39;s less pressure to bring back characters from the original trilogy like Mark Hamill&#39;s Luke Skywalker who was brought back in both The Mandalorian season 2 and The Book of Boba Fett. While it was already fairly obvious thanks to Disney&#43; and the duo&#39;s ongoing popularity, getting their own movie really hammers that idea home. Likewise, the fact that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be Lucasfilm&#39;s big return to theaters proves just how much confidence and faith has been put in the duo for Star Wars&#39; future.

              The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu  The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is a Star Wars movie directed by Jon Favreau that continues Disney&#43;&#39;s immensely popular TV Show, The Mandalorian. The film will replace The Mandalorian season 4 to bring the franchise back to the big screen and follow Din Djarin and his adventures with Grogu. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is the first Star Wars film to be released since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019.
