## Literature Review

The Rotten Tomatoes critic score for Kevin Hart&#39;s new Netflix heist comedy gives the prolific star his latest in a long line of splats.




Kevin Hart&#39;s new movie Lift continues a dismal Rotten Tomatoes streak for the star. Hart stars in the movie as Cyrus, a heist mastermind who leads a team that intends to pull off a major job on an airborne 777 in order to prevent a terrorist attack. The movie, which was helmed by The Fate of the Furious director F. Gary Gray, features a massive ensemble cast that also includes Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio, Billy Magnussen, Jacob Batalon, Jean Reno, Sam Worthington, and Money Heist star Úrsula Corberó.




Now that the Lift movie has premiered on Netflix, Rotten Tomatoes has aggregated its official critic score. While the score may fluctuate if more reviews are added, 30 critics&#39; thoughts have been consolidated to give the movie a thoroughly Rotten 27%. This is the latest splat for Hart, whose previous collaborations with the streamer haven&#39;t received positive reviews since 2021.


 Can Kevin Hart Turn His Rotten Tomatoes Streak Around? 
          

These negative Lift reviews don&#39;t come entirely as a surprise, considering Hart&#39;s recent Netflix track record. In fact, it is the highest score that one of his movies for the streamer has earned since 2021, when his movie Fatherhood earned a Fresh score. However, that movie wasn&#39;t originally intended to be a Netflix original, as the streamer bought it after its 2020 theatrical release was canceled during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Check out the Rotten Tomatoes scores of Hart&#39;s recent Netflix outings below:




 Title  RT Score   Lift (2024)  27%   Me Time (2022)  7%   The Man From Toronto (2022)  23%   Fatherhood (2021)  68%   



Leading the Lift cast represents a small improvement for Hart&#39;s Netflix Rotten Tomatoes scores. However, it remains to be seen if Hart can turn this dismal Rotten Tomatoes streak around. Ultimately, the title that may do the trick is also a streaming heist story, the upcoming Peacock limited series Fight Night, which tells the true story of a heist that took place during a Muhammad Ali fight in 1970s Atlanta.

In spite of that show&#39;s potential, none of the officially announced projects that he has coming up after Lift are Netflix titles, so his streak on the streamer will remain for the time being. For now, his next general opportunity at a Fresh score will come with the 2024 Borderlands movie, adapted from the video game series of the same name. Hart will be playing the mercenary Roland, a unique role for the comedian that may earn him kudos from critics.
