# Star Wars Collector Discovers SECOND Rare 1978 Action Figure, Six Months After The Last Sold For Nearly $34,000


## SUMMARY 



  A collector found a second rare 1978 Star Wars action figure in his attic, just months after selling the first one for almost $34,000.   These particular Star Wars action figures, featuring vinyl capes, were quickly discontinued and replaced with ones with cloth capes, making them extremely rare and valuable.   The collector, who was actually Marvel&#39;s UK art director in the 1970s, found the toys in his attic after they were gifted to him and forgotten about for over 40 years. The second figure will be auctioned off soon.

## Literature Review

A Star Wars enthusiast and avid collector has just found an extremely rare toy in the most surprising place - and it isn&#39;t his first time.




A collector found a second rare 1978 Star Wars action figure, just 6 months after he sold the last one for almost $34,000. In 1978, the company Kenner Toys put out a line of Jawa toys that wore vinyl capes. However, these toys were quickly discontinued, and replaced by ones with cloth capes by the second round of production. As such, they have become very rare.




The Sun recently reported on the story of a man who, by pure luck, found two of these toys in his attic. Back in July 2023, an unnamed Star Wars enthusiast and collector found one of these rare 1978 vinyl cape Jawa toys in his attic. This individual initially put it up for auction with a target price of £10,000 (12,728.25 USD). However, he had no idea just how valuable these action figures were. The first sold for £26,670 (33,934.91 USD). Shockingly, when going through his attic recently, the UK resident found a second one of these 1978 Jawa toys - this time in the original packaging.

 Why These Jawa Action Figures Are So Rare... &amp; How They Ended Up In An Attic 
          




George Lucas wasn&#39;t a fan of the look of vinyl capes. As such, he made a request: ditch the vinyl capes and put the Jawas in cloth capes instead. Kenner Toys listened to Lucas, and the vinyl-caped toys were pulled from toy shelves. Since they were pulled extremely early on in the process, there are very few of them hanging around. As such, they have become almost mythical among fans, and carry incredible value.

It is surprising enough for someone to find one such toy lying around their house, let alone two. However, if anyone was going to find them, it would be this man. The unnamed seller was actually Marvel&#39;s UK art director in the 1970s. After doing a photo shoot for the comic, he was gifted several toys, including the rare Jawas. The Jawas lay forgotten in his attic until he found them over 40 years later. The second Jawa figure will be going up for auction on January 27.
