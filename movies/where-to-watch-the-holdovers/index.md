## Literature Review

The Holdovers is one of the best films of 2023 and one one the greatest new holiday-themed movies in a while. Here&#39;s where to watch it.




The critically acclaimed The Holdovers is still screening in some theaters and is currently also available to stream. The Alexander Payne film, starring Paul Giamatti, Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph, and Dominic Sessa, was one of the 2023 films that picked up a few surprising but well-deserved awards at the 2024 Golden Globes, which were held on January 7, 2024. Payne, known for his work on The Descendants (2011), Election (1999), Nebraska (2013), and Sideways (2004), directed both Giamatti and Randolph to Golden Globes in the Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and Best Supporting Actress In a Motion Picture categories, respectively.




Released in theaters on October 27, 2023 after premiering at the 50th Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2023, The Holdovers follows Giamatti&#39;s Paul Hunham, a disgruntled history teacher at an elite prep school who is assigned to spend the holidays with Sessa&#39;s Angus Tully on campus because he has nowhere else to go. The unlikely duo, with the guidance of Randolph&#39;s spectacularly earnest Mary Lamb, who is the school cook and also a grieving mother, form a unique bond and share a series of life-changing experiences reminding them of the important things in life.
