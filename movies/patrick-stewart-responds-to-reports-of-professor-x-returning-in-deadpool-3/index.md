## Literature Review

Deadpool 3 is shaping up to feature plenty of X-Men cameos, and Professor X actor Patrick Stewart just strongly hinted that he&#39;ll be one of them.




Deadpool 3 is set to feature a variety of cameos from across the MCU and Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise, and Professor X actor Patrick Stewart hints that he may be among those who appear. Deadpool 3 is set to be the only Marvel Cinematic Universe release in 2024, and filming has been underway for quite some time, given the temporary pause during the 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike. News of who will and won&#39;t appear in the MCU&#39;s first mutant-centric movie has been slowly trickling out, and it seems as though X-Mean leader Charles Xavier may set to show up at least one more time.




Professor X showed up briefly in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but he was met with a quick death. However, it seems as if Stewart&#39;s version of the character may get another shot at a happier ending. Speaking on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Stewart confirms that he&#39;s at least had discussions about appearing in the upcoming Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman-starring superhero film. Read his full quote below:


Josh Horowitz: I&#39;m gonna guess I might see Patrick Stewart in a Deadpool/Wolverine movie.
Patrick Stewart: It... it has come up. There&#39;s been a process.


Of course, this doesn&#39;t confirm his involvement, but it seems surprisingly positive in an industry that usually meets rumors with quick denial. Whether or not Stewart and the team behind Deadpool 3 worked anything out is unknown and likely won&#39;t be made clear until the movie is released on July 26.

                  Every Actor Cast In Deadpool 3 (So Far)   Ryan Reynolds is joining the MCU as the Merc with a Mouth in Phase 6&#39;s Deadpool 3, and some of his supporting cast has already been revealed.   





 Why Deadpool 3&#39;s Cameo Reveals Have Been Controversial So Far 
Given that Deadpool will be officially entering the MCU in Deadpool 3, it&#39;s not surprising that the movie will presumably act as a bit of an epilogue for the iconic Fox X-Men movie franchise. As such, it follows that several familiar faces from movies past will join in on the action, both from the Fox and Marvel sides of the divide. In fact, the movie was first announced by revealing that Deapool 3 will co-star Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine. However, a few more cameos have been spoiled than the studio had planned. 

                  Everything Revealed In Deadpool 3 Set Photos   Set photos for Deadpool 3 have been both released officially and leaked, resulting in a slew of confirmed details and strong suggestions for theories.   

As Deadpool 3 resumed filming after the end of the SAG-AFTRA strike in the back stretch of 2023, set photos started cropping up confirming several previously unannounced characters. Set photos aren&#39;t a new phenomenon for superhero movies, but it&#39;s rare that so many Easter eggs are spoiled ahead of time. This prompted Deadpool actor Ryan Reynolds to take to Instagram to encourage people to let the movie keep some of its magic for release. However, Professor X hasn&#39;t yet been spotted in any Deadpool 3 photos or footage, so time will tell if Stewart gets another MCU appearance or not.
