# “Size Matters Not” Yoda s Most Famous Force Lesson Has Been Proved Wrong


## SUMMARY 


 

Using the Force requires physical and mental stamina, as demonstrated by the exhaustion and potential death of Jedi when performing powerful Force feats.
            
The Force still has to work around physics, including inertia and gravity, which can make it difficult to move larger objects.
            
Size does matter when it comes to using the Force, contradicting Yoda&#39;s famous line that &#34;size matters not.&#34; Physical training is necessary to develop the strength needed to move larger objects.
