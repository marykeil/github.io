## Literature Review

Society of the Snow is packed with hidden details that make the film more powerful, and one particular connection regarding its music is fascinating. 




A curious connection between Society of the Snow and one of the most famous TV shows ever about a plane crash adds a certain value to the film, making it more powerful. Netflix&#39;s adaptation of the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crash true story was released worldwide on January 4th, 2024, and has received an overall positive response. The movie tells the story of how a Uruguayan rugby team survived 72 days in the Andes after a terrible plane crash. In addition to its 89% score from the critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Alejandro Bayona&#39;s movie received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes and is Spain’s contender for the Oscar.






Society of the Snow is available to stream on Netflix.




Alejandro Bayona&#39;s unique approach to the story is one of the highlights of the movie and a huge reason behind the film’s success. Considering the comparison with Alive, 1993&#39;s previous adaptation of the tale, Society of the Snow&#39;s roughness and emphasis on the stories of the diseased have been praised. The technical aspects are also a big part of its beauty, which includes brilliant cinematography by Pedro Luque, for instance. Regarding other aesthetic accomplishments, the film&#39;s beautiful music, composed by Michael Giacchino, is also one of the highlights of the film and the source of one of the most curious hidden details in Society of the Snow.

                  Numa Turcatti Narrating Society Of The Snow Has A Much Deeper Meaning For The True Story   Juan Antonio Bayona’s unique approach to the true story in Society of the Snow is reflected in his decision to make Numa the narrator of the film.    





 Society Of The Snow &amp; Lost Are Both Composed By Michael Giacchino 
          

American composer Michael Giacchino is the man in charge of the beautiful score that perfectly accompanies Luque&#39;s majestic cinematography and some brilliant performances by the cast of Society of the Snow. Giacchino has a rather extensive filmography in Hollywood as he has composed the music for films such as The Incredibles, Jurassic World, and UP, for which he won an Academy Award in 2010. However, what&#39;s more fascinating about his previous works is the fact that he composed Lost&#39;s score, which interestingly, is another very well-remembered plane crash story. 

Lost is one of the most important TV shows ever as it changed the way series are made for good. The six-season fantastic drama follows the adventures of a group of survivors on a mysterious island after a plane crash, which is a very similar plot to Society of the Snow, drawing a very interesting connection. The main difference between the two stories, of course, is the fact that the film is based on a true survival story, while the TV show is a fiction tale packed with fantastic elements. In addition to this, the link goes even deeper, as both musical pieces composed by Giacchino are quite similar.






 Society Of The Snow &amp; Lost&#39;s Award-Winning Scores Give Giacchino An Unexpected Niche 
          

Regarding awards, both scores have also proved to be beneficial for Giacchino. In addition to receiving an Oscar for his work in Disney Pixar&#39;s Up, he also received the most important award in the TV industry. Lost&#39;s score got the American composer an Emmy for the show&#39;s pilot and two additional nominations, one for season 4, episode 5, &#34;The Constant&#34;, and one for the Lost finale. Society of the Snow&#39;s score, on the other hand, has already received several nominations, which include the Critics Choice Awards and Goya Awards, and one win at the Hollywood Music In Media Awards.

Society of the Snow and Lost&#39;s scores doing so well awards-wise are a clear indicator that these particular tales are a great fit for Giacchino&#39;s style. Evidently, it is not only that plane crash stories, and groups of people surviving in the wild seem to be a great source of inspiration for the American composer, but its emotional, yet majestic style goes perfectly with the drama that comes with survival and also manages to give nature, which is a key element in these tales, a distinctive music and sound.






 Giacchino Mirroring His Lost Compositions Makes Society Of The Snow&#39;s Impact Even Better 
          

Although Giacchino&#39;s composition surely adds value to the drama of Society of the Snow&#39;s true story, as it perfectly accompanies the characters&#39; emotions through such a rough survival tale, the connection with Lost&#39;s score makes it even more powerful. Considering that Lost&#39;s music is well remembered by many fans, the emotions attached to that particular memory also play a significant part when listening to Society of the Snow&#39;s music, which intentionally or not resembles a lot to Giacchino&#39;s previous Emmy-worthy composition. In other words, returning to those emotions and musical inspirations from Lost brings it full circle.

              Society of the Snow      Release Date    December 15, 2023     Director    J.A. Bayona     Cast    Matías Recalt , Agustin Pardella , Felipe González Otaño , Luciano Chatton , Valentino Alonso , Francisco Romero , Agustín Berruti , Andy Pruss     Runtime    144 Minutes
