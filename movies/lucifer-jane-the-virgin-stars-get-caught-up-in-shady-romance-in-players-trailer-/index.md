## Literature Review

Jane the Virgin&#39;s Gina Rodriguez and Lucifer&#39;s Tom Ellis both star in the recently released trailer for Netflix&#39;s upcoming romcom Players. 




A trailer for the upcoming Netflix romantic comedy Players has now been released. Written by Whit Anderson and directed by Pitch Perfect 3&#39;s Trish Sie, this forthcoming movie follows the protagonist, Mack, a New York sportswriter who unexpectedly falls head over heels for a man who was initially meant to be part of a hookup “play.” Jane the Virgin’s Gina Rodriguez, who also serves as one of the movie’s executive producers, plays Mack, while Lucifer’s Tom Ellis plays the role of Nick, Mack’s charming love interest.




Now, Netflix has released a trailer for Players, giving viewers a look at what to expect. The trailer begins with Mack and a couple of her friends devising a plan to bag a one-night-stand, an established ruse that appears to have been going on for a while.


 

Later in the trailer, Mack and her friends&#39; sturdy plan proves ineffective when the former begins to fall for a fling. The group then begins to devise new plans to help Mack keep “New York&#39;s most eligible bachelor.&#34; Players will release on February 14, 2024.


 Players Has an Exciting Team Behind It 
          




One of the most exciting things about Players is its eclectic and talented cast members. Aside from Rodriguez and Ellis, both of whom have received acclaim for their work on notable television shows, Players also stars Daman Wayans Jr. (New Girl), who plays Adam, Mack’s best friend. Additional cast members include Augustus Prew (The Morning Show), Marin Hinkle (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel), Joel Courtney (The Kissing Booth), Liza Koshy (Work It), and Ego Nwodim (Saturday Night Live).

Outside of Players&#39; exciting cast, Sie, the movie&#39;s director, is also an asset. In the past, Sie mostly operated as a choreographer and director for dance films and music videos. But now, following last year’s well-reviewed Sitting in Bars with Cake, she&#39;s more than comfortable with movies that feature romantic and comedic elements, and it will be interesting to see her take on Players&#39; story.

Considering Players&#39; release date, Netflix is likely hoping audiences will make the movie part of their Valentine&#39;s Day. It remains to be seen if it will be another forgettable film or if it will join the list of some of Netflix&#39;s best romance movies that have been released over the last few years.
