Summary

  Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie draws inspiration from outside sources, including previous films, to establish its story and vision.   The movie includes allusions to The Matrix and 2001: A Space Odyssey, fitting with Barbie&#39;s themes of defying conventions.   Barbie contains several subtle references to The Wizard of Oz, and Stereotypical Barbie&#39;s journey mirrors that of Dorothy.  






Barbie includes everything from toy references to pop culture Easter eggs, and Greta Gerwig&#39;s 2023 hit perfectly parallels an 84-year-old movie in an incredibly subtle way. Given Barbie&#39;s toy inspiration, it&#39;s no secret that the Margot Robbie-led movie pulls from outside sources to establish its story. The film doesn&#39;t just use Mattel&#39;s lineup of dolls to form its vision either; it also follows the setup of movies that came before it, particularly those about finding oneself and defying conventions.

Among Barbie&#39;s many references and Easter eggs are allusions to The Matrix and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Both fit with Barbie&#39;s core themes and its fish-out-of-water story. However, another one of Barbie&#39;s nods highlights a classic film with a plot that parallels that of Margot Robbie&#39;s Stereotypical Barbie well.

 The Wizard Of Oz Easter Eggs In Barbie Explained 
          



Barbie has plenty of connections to The Wizard of Oz. And given how much Barbie&#39;s journey resembles Dorothy&#39;s, it&#39;s not that surprising that the film includes such details.




Barbie contains several references to the 1939 classic The Wizard of Oz, but they&#39;re so subtle that only eagle-eyed viewers will notice them. The most obvious nod to The Wizard of Oz is when Barbie drives past a movie theater that has posters for the other film on the outside. An image of Judy Garland&#39;s Dorothy can be spotted as she passes, as can posters of Jack Haley&#39;s Tin Man and Bert Lahr&#39;s Cowardly Lion. Given that Warner Bros. owns both movies, it can include a direct reference to The Wizard of Oz in Barbie. However, that&#39;s not the only way it honors the beloved classic.

TikTok user Cat Quinn noted that Stereotypical Barbie&#39;s gingham dress, which she wears when she passes the movie theater, has a pattern and style similar to Dorothy&#39;s in The Wizard of Oz — just in pink instead of blue. The movie also features a pink road to the human world, which bears similarities to The Wizard of Oz&#39;s Yellow Brick Road. It even ends with a rainbow, which could be a subtle nod to &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&#34; Needless to say, Barbie has plenty of connections to The Wizard of Oz. And given how much Barbie&#39;s journey resembles Dorothy&#39;s, it&#39;s not that surprising that the film includes such details.



Barbie is now available to stream on Max.






 How Barbie&#39;s Journey Mirrors Dorothy&#39;s In The Wizard Of Oz 
          

Stereotypical Barbie&#39;s journey throughout Barbie mirrors Dorothy&#39;s in many ways, starting with the fact that both characters venture from their home to a completely new world. Stereotypical Barbie and Dorothy are pushed to another world by the societal expectations laid out for them and their failure to meet these standards. And both women find themselves thanks to their journey, returning home with a new perspective — though Stereotypical Barbie leaves again, while Dorothy is glad to be back. Even so, it&#39;s clear that Barbie&#39;s central story mirrors that of The Wizard of Oz. Its Easter eggs drive that point home, giving viewers fun hints to pick up on.
