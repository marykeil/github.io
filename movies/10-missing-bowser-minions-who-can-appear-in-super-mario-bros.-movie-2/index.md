## Literature Review

A Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel could expand beyond familiar enemies, introducing a wider range of Bowser&#39;s minions for added challenges and fun.





The Super Mario Bros. Movie introduced familiar foes like Shy Guys, Koopas, and Bullet Bill. However, a potential sequel could explore a broader array of Bowser&#39;s minions, offering an opportunity to enrich the film and introduce additional challenges for Mario and his companions. While the first film included some of Mario&#39;s most iconic antagonists, Bowser has a vast roster of quirky and creative minions that have yet to appear on the big screen. These range from the turtle-like Lakitus that ride clouds and throw Spiny Eggs, to flying Goombas, to the precarious cactus Pokey.
Integrating new characters like Wario in the Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel would not only pose fresh threats for Mario, Luigi, Peach and company to overcome, but their inclusion could sprinkle the film with additional moments of lighthearted humor and wacky visual spectacle. It would also satiate those that are eager to see more of the games&#39; beloved characters realized on the big screen. Whether they are assisting Bowser in launching attacks, pursuing their own chaotic agendas, or even forming unlikely alliances with the heroes, exposing more of the Mushroom Kingdom&#39;s diverse inhabitants could pay tribute to the franchise’s spirit and enrich the cinematic universe’s worldbuilding.









 








 10  Spike 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988)
        

Moonlighting as dodgeball masters, the spike-shelled Koopas known as Spikes could roll in for an amusing appearance in a Mario sequel. Wielding an infinite supply of spiked balls stored in their mouths to fling at the plumbers with pinpoint precision, these smirking troopers would pose a true test of Mario and Luigi&#39;s reflexes. Their ability to pop up suddenly from behind hills or around corners could add a delightful element of surprise. Whether standing alone or teaming up for coordinated attacks from all sides, battles against waves of Spikes could give rise to inventive, chaotic, visually dynamic scenes.





 9  Paragoombas 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990)
        

Paragoombas are winged variants of the classic Goomba enemies in Super Mario games. Though they strongly resemble normal Goombas, the addition of wings allows them the ability to fly and attack Mario from the air. This contrasts with ground-based Goombas, who already appeared in the movie, and would enable new aerial chase scenes and platforming challenges with Paragoombas swooping down or diving toward Mario. They have appeared in multiple Mario games already, so integrating Paragoombas into a sequel film would allow for a fresh take on the iconic Goomba threat. Their erratic flying behavior also suits the zany tone of the potential Super Mario Bros. Movie franchise.





 8  Podoboos 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. (1985)
        

With numerous updates to The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2, Fiery Podoboos could heat things up as a unique threat. These living fireballs leap unpredictably from pools of molten rock, requiring characters to quickly evade them. Emerging briefly as mysterious jellyfish-like forms before plopping back into the deadly magma, their presence could make for tension-filled action by turning simple platform navigation into a test of timing. Podoboos could drive intense chase scenes and boss battles if they lived up to their tendency for mischief. Long featured across Mario games, a big-screen Podoboo debut promises to organically introduce higher stakes while expanding glimpses into the Mushroom Kingdom’s many odd inhabitants.





 7  Pokeys 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. 2 (1988)


 







Composed of stacks of rotating spiked body segments, Pokeys wander the Mushroom Kingdom’s deserts hoping to make unwanted contact with passerbys. Since physical contact with these spiked towers spells trouble for Mario and friends, adding Pokeys could spur clever platforming challenges and comic moments. Pokeys’ ability to regenerate lost appendages or launch severed arms that morph into explosive fruits suggests dynamic battle potential. Given Pokeys frequent major Super Mario games and have relatives like Snow Pokeys, the core Pokey variant would finally realize an underrepresented enemy faction on film. As most Pokeys call deserts home, their inclusion might spur visually striking new settings to create more expansive movie locales.
            
 
 10 Best Bowser Moments In The Super Mario Bros Movie, Ranked 
Bowser&#39;s scenes carried the comedy and central conflict of The Super Mario Movies, with some of the villain&#39;s moments standing out more than others. 








 6  Hammer Bros. 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. (1985)


 







The Hammer Bros. were a missed opportunity by not adding them to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Clad in iconic militaristic gear and always traveling in pairs or battalions, these Koopa spin-offs endlessly pelt their targets with curved shell projectiles while bounding acrobatically between brick blockade outposts. Including these loyal assault specialists could introduce thrilling new attack dynamics compared to standard Koopa Troopas, providing coordinated long-range barrages to counter Mario’s evasive maneuvers. With numerous relatives like Boomerang, Ice and Fire Bros., Hammer Bros. represent a key enemy faction still lacking proper film introduction. Letting these merciless mercenaries join Bowser’s crusade could showcase more fighting force diversity.





 5  Wiggler 
First Appeared In Super Mario World (1991)


 







There is a strong possibility that the expressive Wigglers could bring their mood swings to the big screen. With their bright yellow bodies and flower-adorned heads, these creatures could initially appear as cheery nature sprites in the Mushroom Kingdom&#39;s forests. However, a slight provocation could trigger a humorous transformation: enraged Wigglers turn red, reveal menacing teeth, and give a spirited chase for revenge. Whether accidental encounters lead to frantic escapes or Bowser finds ways to exploit their normally peaceful nature, Wigglers promise to add organic comedy. With other related creatures like Aqua Wigglers, showcasing their split personalities would contribute to fun scenarios and scenes in The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2.





 4  Thwomps 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990)
        

Thwomps stand out as physical adversaries in Mario&#39;s universe, with a unique ability to flatten their victims, setting them apart from other soft-bodied enemies. Their stone anatomy introduces fresh visual elements and potential battle dynamics, allowing Thwomps to smash through platforms or resist lava, requiring strategic evasion and trap-setting. The addition of their maniacal laughter as they crush architecture could be a crowd-pleaser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2. With their classic menace, it seems appropriate to incorporate these iconic characters into the narrative.





 3  Boos 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988)
        

As iconic characters in Super Mario, Boos appear poised for expanded roles in a sequel, haunting the characters in the Mushroom Kingdom. While the recent film hinted at their presence through King Boo, showcasing entire swarms of standard Boos phasing through walls with their distinctive cackles could introduce delightfully eerie new threats. Audiences would likely find amusement in the brothers confidently advancing, only to freeze in their tracks at a glance back, the ghosts instantly assuming innocent forms. The ambiguity of whether Boos are undead or a distinct species adds an intriguing layer of mystery, as well.





 2  Lakitu 
First Appeared In Super Mario Bros. (1985)
        

Lakitu, a recurring enemy in the Super Mario franchise, presents a compelling addition to a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel. This Koopa, riding on a cloud and tossing Spiny Eggs onto the terrain, adds dynamic challenges for Mario and company to overcome. Beyond its role as an enemy, Lakitu&#39;s neutral engagements, such as assisting racers in Super Mario Kart or filming Mario&#39;s adventures, showcase versatility. Which seems like an oversight for not appearing in the first film, Lakitu&#39;s ability to introduce varied scenarios, from high-altitude attacks to the potential for cloud riding after defeat, could enrich the sequel&#39;s narrative and bring an iconic Mario adversary to life on the screen.





 1  Bowser Jr. 
First Appeared In Super Mario Sunshine (2002)
 As Bowser’s apparent heir, Bowser Jr. seems destined for a larger antagonistic role in a Super Mario Bro. Movie sequel. His bratty disposition, yet touching devotion towards his notorious father won many fans. His spoiled antics try to emulate Bowser’s grand schemes, piloting elaborate war machines of his own design against Mario and crew. His attempts to gain respect despite his age suggest character depth primed for exploration, as well. Whether engaging in petty mischief or fighting tooth and nail to defend his father’s honor when Bowser faces defeat again, Bowser Jr.’s presence in Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 could raise the personal stakes while showcasing next-gen Koopa royalty.
