## Literature Review

Jared Leto is no longer the Joker of DC Extended Universe but there&#39;s something about his take on the character that continues to divide fans.




Over the course of two movies, Jared Leto joined the ranks of previous live-action Joker actors like Jack Nicholson and the late Heath Ledger to play Batman’s arch-nemesis in the DC Extended Universe. From his tattooed Joker’s first look photos to a menacing glimpse in the Suicide Squad teaser trailer, Leto created enough buzz for his unique portrayal of the character on social media. But many fans were eventually disappointed by the end product as the David Ayer movie featured the Joker as a supporting character, leaving much more to be explored in future DCEU movies. If anything, a brief role in Zack Snyder’s Justice League offered some redemption.




While some fans were still in awe of the unhinged energy that the Dallas Buyers Club actor brought on screen, his Joker continues to be a subject of debate among DC fans. A significant chunk of critics and audiences found Leto’s performance to be too over-the-top and not as realistic as his predecessor Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. The stylistic choices of his mobster clown also came off as edgy for comic book purists who found the tattoos and toothgrill too much of a deviation from traditional depictions of the Joker. Leto’s Joker paved the way for some impressive Harley Quinn projects, but the character remains enigmatic on his own.

                  What Happened To Jared Leto’s Joker After Suicide Squad   Jared Leto&#39;s Joker, who debuted in 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad, was a controversial rendition of the character, and his eventual fate is left unclear.   


 Why Jared Leto&#39;s Joker Was So Different To Other Versions 
         




To play the Joker, Jared Leto seemed to have blended his method acting with the traits of his predecessors. Leto’s Joker evoked the charisma of Jack Nicholson in Batman and the anarchism-driven unpredictability of Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight. At the same time, this version of the Joker was way more modern in terms of his appearance, as Ayer wanted to go with a flashy “gangster look” (via Entertainment Weekly). The dyed green hair aside, Leto was covered with all sorts of tattoos, including the infamous “Damaged” tattoo adorning his forehead. Other visual choices included a grill on his teeth that marked a painfully modern addition to the character&#39;s visual vocabulary.



Four actors have played Joker in live-action films, and all are an Oscar winner: Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix.




Perhaps the singer and actor’s struggle for originality can also be understood from how he never broke character on set. While Ledger tended to get into character by locking himself up in solitary spaces, Leto went the other way around. The Joker’s affinity for chaos and not taking things seriously is manifested in Leto’s on-set pranks. For instance, Viola Davis told Vogue how Leto gifted fellow Suicide Squad star Margot Robbie a live rat on set. Adam Beach similarly said in an interview with E! News that on his day off, Leto shipped an unnerving video message and a dead pig on the Suicide Squad set.




Despite his extravagant fashion choices and over-dramatic dialogue delivery, Leto told Entertainment Weekly that he took a deep dive to understand the character’s unstable psyche. Apart from spending time with psychiatrists, Leto also met “people who had committed horrendous crimes” and “people who have been institutionalized for great periods of time”. Talking about psychiatrists, his romance with psychologist-turned-accomplice Harley Quinn also set his character apart, as no previous live-action version had delved into his manipulative nature as a lover. Reshoots changed Joker and Harley’s relationship in Suicide Squad but he was supposed to be more abusive to her than in the theatrical cut. This angle makes him even more hauntingly obsessive.



 Did Leto&#39;s Joker Go Too Far? 
          




Despite his limited screen time in Suicide Squad, Leto’s Joker encapsulated the character’s toxic traits. Harley Quinn was introduced in Batman: The Animated Series from where Joker’s gaslighting tendencies can be traced. The dialogue “Oh, I&#39;m not gonna kill ya. I&#39;m just gonna hurt ya... really, really bad.” captures the brutal ways in which he physically and mentally changes Quinn. The scene with the Joker dropping Queen into a vat of acid might be taking it too far, but this is a scene directly taken from the 2011 Suicide Squad comic book series. So, despite Leto’s menacing portrayal, his comic book counterpart has been way more manic over the years.


 

Dropping her into acid is just one of the many despicable things that Joker did to Harley Quinn. Suicide Squad #14 found the clown gangster chaining her by the neck to hide his secrets while Batman #663 found Harley almost being killed for the sake of a joke’s “punchline”. From the animated series to the comics, he has treated her unfairly and brutally, the reason why Quinn eventually left him in future comics. Even while compared to other victims, Leto’s Joker does seem more brutal in his affinity to torture individuals instead of just shooting them off (like what Nicholson, Ledger, and Phoenix’s Joker did mostly).




                  The 2 Canceled Joker Movies We&#39;re Extremely Relieved DC Never Made   Jared Leto almost played the Joker in two DCEU movies that never happened, one of which would also have featured Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn.   

But again, the comic book version of Joker is the one that takes it too far, as can be seen from some particularly graphic comic panels. The Killing Joke miniseries remains controversial to this day for the Joker shooting and paralyzing Barbara Gordon. Even though a Robin costume in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice does imply that Leto’s Joker might have injured or killed Jason Todd, the A Death in the Family storyline offers more context on Joker’s relentless attempts to kill the 15-year-old with a crowbar. So, even though the DC Extended Universe did make The Joker dark and gritty, he’s still more balanced, unlike the comics.

As for the performance: Leto&#39;s problem was that his Joker was deemed too much by a lot of the audience. He lacked the coolness of some of the other versions, and dialed up oddness (arguably more fittingly for a character who styles himself as a clown). Tattoos aside, his look is actually a great addition to the Joker canon, and Leto&#39;s performance is as unnerving and annoying as you&#39;d expect. The major issue came not with delivery but with framing: as David Ayer himself said, the cut of Suicide Squad that made it to theaters made him a prop and not a character. In that context, it&#39;s no surprise that he didn&#39;t work, or that Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League appearance felt so much stronger.
