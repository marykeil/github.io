Summary

  James Gunn is rebooting the DCEU into the DCU and has announced a new Batman film titled Batman: The Brave and the Bold.   The film will feature Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and multiple possibly other members of the Bat Family.   The inclusion of Robin in the film fixes the off-screen death of the character in the DCEU, which caused controversy among viewers.  






While there is still plenty left to learn about Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the DCU, James Gunn has already fixed a controversial decision regarding the character from the previous shared universe. Following the release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the DCEU will be rebooted into the DCU, led by Gunn and Peter Safran. At the beginning of 2023, Gunn made a series of announcements regarding the DCU, including a new Batman film titled Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The film does not star Ben Affleck nor Robert Pattinson and will be a fresh iteration of the character presumably based on Grant Morrison&#39;s comic book run, Batman and Son.

No cast or director has been attached to The Brave and the Bold, but the comic book it&#39;s based on gives audiences some information on what the film will include. The movie will likely center around an older version of Bruce Wayne, alongside his kid, Damian, and possibly the multiple other Robins who have flown under Batman&#39;s wing. The confirmation of Robin fixes an off-screen death from the DCEU that caused quite a stir for DC audiences.

 DCU&#39;s Batman Has Already Undone The DCEU&#39;s Most Controversial Character Death Reveal 
          

  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice   Release Date   March 24, 2016    Director   Zack Snyder    Cast   Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot       

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice featured a version of Batman that some disagreed with. While most appreciate Affleck&#39;s performance as an older, disillusioned Bruce Wayne, others were upset that his character killed people and fought with brutal violence. One reason for his more bloodthirsty attitude could be that Robin was killed. It&#39;s shown later that Bruce keeps Robin&#39;s old suit in a display case, and the suit has graffiti on it that says &#34;Joke&#39;s on you, Batman&#34;, suggesting the Joker murdered Robin sometime in the past.

Zack Snyder did confirm that this Robin was Dick Grayson, and he was killed off-screen. This decision caused controversy among viewers as it eliminated many great storylines from Affleck&#39;s Batman and used Robin as an emotional excuse for Batman to turn violent. Affleck&#39;s Bruce Wayne didn&#39;t have an origin story, but this reveal teased audiences about important aspects of this character that they never got to see. Gunn&#39;s announcement about Robin in the DCU redeems this decision from the DCEU and gives audiences the chance to see Batman and Robin&#39;s relationship unfold.



 How The DCU Batman Is Setting Up To Be The Exact Opposite Of The DCEU 
   Close     

The Batman and Son comics storyline features several of Batman&#39;s kids, including Damian Wayne and Tim Drake. In Gunn&#39;s announcement, he said that this story would include Damian, who he called his &#34;favorite Robin&#34; and &#34;the beginning of sort of the Bat Family in the DCU.&#34; The DCU&#39;s Batman will not be an isolated introvert who doesn&#39;t have any relationships outside of Alfred.

This will be a drastically different version who tries to connect with his kids, and it could also be a more sociable Bruce Wayne, who portrays himself as a charming aristocrat. Damian also has a connection to Talia al Ghul, so the pantheon of Batman characters in Batman: The Brave and the Bold could be introduced immediately. It also looks to be a more personal story rather than one that connects to Superman, Wonder Woman, and the larger DCU - at least in part.

  Key Release Dates              Joker: Folie a Deux Release Date: 2024-10-04                   Superman: Legacy Release Date: 2025-07-11                   The Batman - Part II Release Date: 2025-10-03
