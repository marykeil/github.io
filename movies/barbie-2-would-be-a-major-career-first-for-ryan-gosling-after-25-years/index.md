# Barbie 2 Would Be A Major Career First For Ryan Gosling After 25 Years


## SUMMARY 



  Ryan Gosling has never returned for a sequel or spin-off film in his 25-year-long career.   His role as Ken in Barbie was a career-defining performance and a highlight of the film.   While a sequel or spin-off might be fun, it is not necessary and probably shouldn&#39;t happen, despite the success of the first Barbie film.

## Literature Review
If it actually happens, Barbie 2 (or a Ken spin-off) would mark a major career first for Barbie movie actor Ryan Gosling&#39;s over 25-year-long career.




If it actually happens, Barbie 2 — or even a Ken-centered spin-off — would mark a major career first for Barbie movie actor Ryan Gosling and his over 25-year-long career. The Oscar-nominated actor got his start on the Disney Channel&#39;s The Mickey Mouse Club during the mid-90s, and landed a few TV roles before starring in Sundance Film Festival&#39;s 2001 Grand Jury Prize-winner The Believer. From there, Gosling became a household name after appearing opposite Rachel McAdams in 2004&#39;s romantic drama The Notebook. The actor earned his first Academy Award nomination for 2006&#39;s indie drama Half Nelson.




Afterward, Gosling continued to star in both mainstream hits, Drive and Crazy, Stupid, Love, and indie darlings, like Blue Valentine and The Place Beyond the Pines. From his Oscar-nominated role in La La Land to his award-chasing turn in First Man to his brooding performance in Blade Runner 2049, Ryan Gosling has had a pretty remarkable career in Hollywood. Of course, 2023 took that success to new heights with the release of Greta Gerwig&#39;s fantasy-comedy Barbie. Gosling&#39;s embodiment of Ken — Barbie&#39;s (Margot Robbie) wannabe boyfriend — is a highlight of the sleeper hit that grossed a whopping $1.442 billion at the box office.


 Barbie 2 Would Be Ryan Gosling&#39;s First Ever Sequel That He&#39;s Returned For 
          

With roughly 25 years of movie roles under his belt, Ryan Gosling has achieved a lot, but there&#39;s one common career milestone he hasn&#39;t crossed — and it has nothing to do with winning an Oscar. Surprisingly, in a Hollywood that&#39;s saturated with cinematic universes, IP-spawned films, and more remakes and spin-offs than original stories, Gosling has somehow never returned for a sequel movie. To be fair, most Ryan Gosling movies don&#39;t really call for follow-up entries. Even the most devout Gosling fans aren&#39;t clamoring for Lars and the Real Girl or Only God Forgives sequels. But Barbie might just change that pattern.






Ryan Gosling has been nominated for a Golden Globe in the Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture category for his performance in Barbie.




While Gosling did star in Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Blade Runner sequel, that was an example of the actor joining a pre-established franchise. He&#39;s never made a movie and then appeared in a sequel to it. In fact, Gosling hasn&#39;t even appeared in a spin-off installment of something he previously starred in. Given Barbie&#39;s ultra-successful performance at the worldwide box office, another entry in the franchise seems like a no-brainer — and, funnily enough, Gosling&#39;s &#34;I&#39;m Just Ken&#34;-singing character is the film&#39;s stand-out personality. If Barbie 2 does happen, including Gosling is pretty much a must, especially since Ken has morphed into a career-defining role.



 Should Barbie 2 Or A Ken Spinoff Actually Happen? 
          




The blockbuster success of Gerwig&#39;s Barbie proves that not all box-office-topping films need to come from pre-established franchises, cinematic universes, or IP. While Barbie does adapt Mattel&#39;s enduring doll and her lore to the silver screen, it&#39;s a wholly inventive take on the material. Even Mattel is a character in the fantastical film. Barbie is so great because of its freshness — because it is a singular film. Barbie 2 (or even a Ken spin-off) might be fun, especially given the first film&#39;s engrossing world, but it isn&#39;t necessary, and probably shouldn&#39;t happen — even if it would push Ryan Gosling to reprise his exceptional role.
