## Literature Review

Acclaimed director Steven Spielberg will be returning to the thriller genre for the first time in over 30 years, but there is a major twist.




Steven Spielberg has agreed to return to the thriller genre after decades away. Spielberg is a beloved creative, having developed Saving Private Ryan, Schindler&#39;s List, Jurassic Park, and countless other critically acclaimed and classic movies. He has earned three Oscars and nine nominations, won the AFI Life Achievement Award, and even earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.




Despite regularly producing dramatic, intense movies, Spielberg has avoided thrillers for over 30 years. According to a report by Deadline, that trend is coming to an end. Universal purchased the rights to Colin Bannon&#39;s Long Lost. Spielberg is attached to the project as a producer, and Bannon (Love Conquers Paul) will write the script.


 Steven Spielberg&#39;s History With Thrillers 
          

It has been nearly 40 years since Spielberg first launched into the Hollywood scene with the killer shark thriller Jaws. Early in his career, he worked on relatively small productions, but Jaws was the one that helped him become a household name. With the movie largely based on the idea of a haunting shark that is rarely ever seen on-screen, it managed to create a haunting atmosphere.

                  Every Steven Spielberg Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   From industry-defining blockbusters to heartfelt prestige films, here are all 34 movies from director Steven Spielberg, ranked from worst to best.    




Bridge of Spies was something of a return to the genre for Spielberg, yet it was more embroiled in espionage than a classic crime or suspense-focused thriller. Over the past few decades, Spielberg has instead focused on historical or adventure movies. Indiana Jones, Schindler&#39;s List, and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial are all from genres much more familiar to him than something like Long Lost would be.



Spielberg has served as a director, producer, and writer over the course of his long career.




Spielberg&#39;s newest production is all about a wife who has been assumed dead, only for her husband&#39;s new spouse to discover that she was alive all along. With suspicions that the once-lost wife could have sinister plans for her family, the new wife will need to uncover the truth behind her reappearance. With that eerie concept, Long Lost will serve as a way to bring Steven Spielberg back into the world of thrillers.
