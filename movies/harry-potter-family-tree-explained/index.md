## Literature Review

By the end of the seven-book series, Harry Potter goes from being a lonely orphan to a powerful wizard with a large and loving family. 




Although Harry Potter begins with Harry being an abused and lonely orphan at the home of his aunt and uncle, by the end of the seven-book series, Harry has grown up and gained a bigger and better wizarding family. Harry Potter is a book series first published in 1997 which later became movies in 2001. The series tells the story of Harry Potter, a young boy who discovers on his 12th birthday that he is a wizard, and as a result, begins attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Over the next seven years, Harry discovers his own power, and more importantly, his significance as the Boy Who Lived.




While it may seem as though Harry Potter has a simple set of family members, by the end of the final book, he has not only formed a family of his own, but has been adopted by marriage into another wizarding family. Along with that, Harry&#39;s parents remain a massive part of his life throughout the series, especially when he learns more about their time at Hogwarts. In this way, Harry Potter actually has quite a lot of family that support him as the series goes on.

  


 James Potter 
Father
          

James Potter is Harry&#39;s father. Also known as Prongs, James Potter was a talented wizard, animagus, and member of the Order of the Phoenix. Although Harry does not know much about James at the very start of the series, he learns that his father did not die in a car accident, but in actuality, died at the hands of Voldemort, trying to protect Harry and his mother. Later, Harry discovers that James was also a member of a tight-knit friend group called The Marauders; Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs. James Potter died on October 31, 1981, when Harry was only a year old.






 Lily Evans 
Mother
         

Lily Evans is Harry Potter&#39;s mother. Lily was a muggle-born witch that attended Hogwarts at the same time as James Potter. Despite eventually falling in love with him, Lily had a relationship with Severus Snape also, who was in unrequited love with her. Like James, Harry only found out the truth about his mother&#39;s fate when he learned that he was a wizard. Ultimately, when Lily sacrificed her life to save Harry, it protected him from Lord Voldemort&#39;s curse. Lily also died on October 31, 1981.



 Petunia Dursley 
Aunt
         

Petunia Dursley is Harry Potter&#39;s aunt. Petunia is a muggle, and also the sister of Lily Evans. After Lily and James died, Harry was given to Petunia to take care of. Petunia is portrayed as a rude and uncaring woman who treats Harry poorly while he is living at Privet Drive. She is often a bystander when her husband and son abuse Harry. Petunia also seems to resent the wizarding world and Harry&#39;s part in it. Harry has a strained relationship with Petunia, though he protects her against Lord Voldemort.






 Vernon Dursley 
Uncle
          

Vernon Dursley is Harry&#39;s uncle. Vernon is a muggle and is married to Petunia. He is especially abusive to Harry, forcing him to reside in a cupboard under the stairs during his childhood. He also goes to great lengths to avoid Harry attending Hogwarts, and later in the series, prevents him from seeing his friends via bars on his window. Ultimately, Vernon is an unlikable character, yet once again, Harry makes an effort to protect him from Voldemort in the final book of the series.



 Dudley Dursley 
Cousin
         

Dudley Dursley is Harry Potter&#39;s cousin. Dudley is a muggle and the son of Petunia and Vernon. He is portrayed throughout the book as being spoiled and cruel. As a child, he expects the world from his parents, and as a teenager, he becomes something of a bully. However, Dudley is likely the nicest of the Dursley family. Harry saves Dudley from being attacked by a Dementor, and makes sure that he is protected against Voldemort. Dudley also seems to see Harry in a new light in the final book.






 Marjorie Dursley 
Aunt
          

Marjorie Dursley is Harry&#39;s aunt. Marjorie, or Marge, is a muggle and Vernon&#39;s sister. She appears only briefly in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, wherein she is particularly cruel to Harry about his parents, and as a result, Harry accidentally makes her body blow up and fly away. Marjorie and Harry clearly hold great disdain for each other, and it&#39;s likely that this incident does not help in the slightest.



 Sirius Black 
Godfather
         

The final member of Harry&#39;s family from his childhood is Sirius Black. Sirius Black is Harry&#39;s godfather. He was also a wizard and James Potter&#39;s best friend. Harry meets Sirius in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and Harry believes that Sirius killed his parents by proxy. However, he later learns that Sirius and his parents were betrayed by Peter Pettigrew, and that Sirius is actually a good guy who wants to be part of Harry&#39;s life. Harry and Sirius have a very loving and important relationship until Sirius is killed in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. 






 Ginny Weasley 
Wife
         

After Harry graduates from Hogwarts and grows up, he marries Ginny Weasley. Ginny is a witch who is the youngest of the Weasley family, and notably, is the sister of Harry&#39;s best friend, Ron Weasley. Though Harry views Ginny as nothing more than his friend&#39;s sister for much of the books, he later develops feelings for her as she shows off her fiery and passionate personality. Significantly, Harry saves Ginny from Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It is revealed that the two are married at the end of the final book, when 19 years have passed since Voldemort was defeated.



 James Sirius Potter 
Son
          




James Sirius Potter is Harry&#39;s son. James is Harry and Ginny&#39;s eldest son, and he is named after Harry&#39;s father and godfather. At the time that he is introduced, 19 years after Voldemort&#39;s defeat, James has been attending Hogwarts for one year. Therefore, James was likely born sometime between 2003 and 2004.



 Albus Severus Potter 
Son
          

Albus Severus Potter is Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley&#39;s second-eldest child. He is named after Harry&#39;s mentor, Albus Dumbledore, and his former professor, Severus Snape. At the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two, it is Albus Severus&#39; first year at Hogwarts, and he is nervous about attending and being sorted into Slytherin, but Harry comforts him with the knowledge that one of the men he was named after was a Slytherin and &#34;one of the bravest men [he] ever knew.&#34; 






 Lily Luna Potter 
Daughter
          

Lily Luna Potter is Harry and Ginny&#39;s third and final child and their only daughter. She is named after Harry&#39;s mother and the couple&#39;s mutual friend from Hogwarts, Luna Lovegood. In the epilogue, Lily Luna is still a year or two away from being able to attend Hogwarts. In this way, she was likely born between 2007 and 2008.



 Ron Weasley 
Brother-in-Law
         



it makes sense that Harry would be inducted into the Weasley family as an honorary brother.







At the end of the Harry Potter series, Ron Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s brother-in-law. However, Ron begins the series as Harry&#39;s best friend. Harry and Ron first met on Platform 9 3/4 right before they began their first year at Hogwarts. The two immediately got along and have been best friends ever since. Though Harry and Ron often disagree throughout the series, they always manage to fix their problems. Even without marriage making them brothers, it makes sense that Harry would be inducted into the Weasley family as an honorary brother.



 Hermione Granger 
Sister-in-Law
         

Hermione Granger is Harry Potter&#39;s other best friend, and, at the end of the series, is his sister-in-law. She is also Ron Weasley&#39;s wife.

Despite the fact that she is first portrayed as a know-it-all, the boys come to love Hermione and appreciate her knowledge. Throughout the series, Hermione and Ron have a love-hate relationship that ultimately ends with the two getting married and having children.






The Harry Potter books, written by J.K. Rowling, were translated into 80 languages, making them one of the most translated book series in history.






 Rose Weasley 
Niece
          

Rose Weasley, also known as Rosie, is Harry Potter&#39;s niece. She is also the eldest chld of Ron and Hermione Weasley. Rose is the same age as Harry&#39;s son, Albus Severus, which means it is her first year attending Hogwarts in the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. 



 Hugo Weasley 
Nephew
          




Hugo Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s nephew. He is the youngest child of Ron and Hermione Weasley. Like Harry&#39;s daughter, Lily Luna, Hugo was born a year or two after his sister, and therefore, will not attend Hogwarts for a few more years.

Brother-in-Law

After the events of Harry Potter, George went on marry Angelina Johnson and had two children, Fred Weasley II and Roxanne Weasley, who are Harry&#39;s sister-in-law, nephew, and niece respectively.






 Bill Weasley 
Brother-in-Law
          

Bill Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s brother-in-law. Bill is the eldest of the Weasley children, and does not appear often throughout the Harry Potter series because of his age. However, Harry does meet Bill during Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when they attend the Quidditch Tournament together. Another notable event is when Bill marries former Triwizard champion, Fleur Delacour in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Ultimately, Bill and Fleur had three children, Victoire Weasley, Dominique Weasley, and Louis Weasley, whom are Harry&#39;s nieces and nephew.



 Charlie Weasley 
Brother-in-Law
          




Charlie Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s brother-in-law. Charlie is the second-eldest Weasley child, and also, is the one who appears the least throughout the Harry Potter series.

Ultimately, Charlie never married or had children, however, he remains a part of the larger Weasley/Potter clan.



 Percy Weasley 
Brother-in-Law
          

Percy Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s brother-in-law and the third-eldest Weasley child. He attends Hogwarts at the same time as Harry, and in his early years, appears strict but kind. However, in the later books, Percy becomes something of a traitor, prioritizing his work with the corrupt wizarding government over his family. Luckily though, by the end of Harry Potter, Percy changed his ways and made up with his family. Percy ended up marrying a witch named Aubrey and having two daughters, Molly and Lucy, whom are Harry&#39;s nieces.

Harry first meets Molly Weasley in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets when Ron and the twins rescue Harry from Privet Drive and bring him to the Burrow. Molly is a notably kind person, but can be a bit scary when she&#39;s angry. Molly often acts like a mother to Harry, making her the perfect mother-in-law.



 Arthur Weasley 
Father-in-Law
          



Arthur continually shows up for Harry and supports him like a real father.







Arthur Weasley is Harry Potter&#39;s father-in-law and the father of Ginny, Ron, Fred, George, Percy, Charlie, and Bill Weasley. Throughout Harry Potter, Arthur appears to be very nice if a bit eccentric. Harry also meets Arthur Weasley during Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
