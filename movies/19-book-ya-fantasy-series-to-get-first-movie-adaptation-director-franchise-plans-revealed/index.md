# 19-Book YA Fantasy Series To Get First Movie Adaptation, Director &amp; Franchise Plans Revealed


## SUMMARY 



  After two decades, the popular fantasy series The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice is finally getting a long-awaited film adaptation, potentially becoming the next big YA franchise.   The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice books, written by John Flanagan, have been incredibly successful, with the series selling millions of copies and earning the author a spot on the New York Times bestselling list.   The first film will cover the first two novels in the series, The Ruins of Gorlan and The Burning Bridge, and if successful, could pave the way for a larger franchise to fill the current void in major YA film adaptations.

## Literature Review

The young adult fantasy series The Ranger&#39;s Apprentice is set to get its first film adaptation, and the director already has plans for a franchise.




The popular fantasy series The Ranger’s Apprentice is set to get a movie adaptation. The young adult novel series first kicked off in 2004 with the book The Ruins of Gorlan. The series is penned by author John Flanagan and now includes 19 books in the series.




As reported by Deadline, The Ranger’s Apprentice will receive a film adaptation. The novel series will be developed first into a single live-action film, though there is hope that it will become a franchise. The film will be produced by Skydance and directed by Ted Melfi. Flanagan is attached to the project as an executive producer.


 Could The Ranger’s Apprentice Be The Next Big YA Franchise? 
          

Despite the first novel being released two decades ago, The Ranger’s Apprentice series has yet to receive a movie adaptation. The book series itself is wildly popular, as Flanagan has become a New York Times bestselling author as a result of the series. The Ranger’s Apprentice main series was so popular that it even got a follow-up novel series titled The Royal Ranger series.



If the first film successfully leads into a franchise, perhaps The Ranger’s Apprentice could work to fill that void and become the next big YA fantasy franchise.







The Ranger’s Apprentice focuses on an orphan boy, Will, who is taken in by a group of protectors who call themselves the Rangers. Per the title, Will becomes an apprentice to these rangers and is soon immersed in a world where he must become a skilled tracker, archer, and warrior for the King of Araluen. With a well-laid-out fantasy society and many characters, The Ranger’s Apprentice is ripe for a great fantasy film adaptation.

The first Ranger’s Apprentice film will attempt to take on the series’ first two novels, The Ruins of Gorlan &amp; The Burning Bridge. Though the recent return of The Hunger Games universe through The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes is one exception, there is a distinct lack of major YA film franchise adaptations at the moment. If the first film successfully leads into a franchise, perhaps The Ranger’s Apprentice could work to fill that void and become the next big YA fantasy franchise.
