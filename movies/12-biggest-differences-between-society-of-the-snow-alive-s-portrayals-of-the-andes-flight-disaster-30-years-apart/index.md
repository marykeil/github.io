Although Society of the Snow and Alive both tell the true story of the survivors the the 1972 Andes plane crash, there are several key differences between the two films. Released more than 30 years ago in 1993, Alive was directed by Frank Marshall, a prominent producer known for his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Signs (2002), and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). Society of the Snow was directed by Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona, known for directing Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), A Monster Calls (2016), and the 2012 disaster movie The Impossible.
Society of the Snow is Spain&#39;s official submission for Best International Feature at the 2024 Academy Awards. It was released on January 4, 2024, on Netflix and has quickly become one of the most talked about movies of the new year. Alive was not necessarily a box office hit in 1993, earning roughly $36.3 million at the domestic box office from a production budget of $32 million. Alive, however, did captivate audiences upon its release, but Society of the Snow ultimately offers a fresh and closer perspective of the Miracle of the Andes with several added layers of realism.
            
 
 10 Biggest Changes Society Of The Snow Makes To The 1972 Andes Flight Disaster&#39;s True Story 
Society of the Snow is nearly a completely accurate retelling of the tragic 1972 Andes plane crash &amp; survival story, but there are a few key changes.












 








 12  Numa Turcatti Has A Much Bigger Role In Society Of The Snow 
        

Numa Turcatti, the last person to pass away before the remaining 16 survivors were rescued in real life, has a much bigger role in Society of the Snow than he does in Alive. Numa is one of the main protagonists throughout Society of the Snow who narrates the story as it is happening, whereas Alive has a different narrator told from another perspective.





 11  Society Of The Snow &amp; Alive Were Based On Different Books 
        

Both Society of the Snow and Alive were based on two of the dozens of books that were written about the 1972 Andes plane crash by historians, journalists, and many of the survivors. The screenplay for Society of the Snow was based on the book La Sociedad de la Nieve written by Pablo Vierci while the screenplay for Alive was based on the 1974 book Alive: The Story of the Andes Survivors written by British novelist Piers Paul Read.





 10  Alive Is Narrated By “Old Carlitos Páez” Played By John Malkovich 
        

While Society of the Snow is told through the lens of Numa Turcatti, Alive begins and ends with scenes of the character &#34;Old Carlitos Páez&#34;, one of the survivors played by John Malkovich. Old Carlitos recalls the scenario many years after it happened in Alive while Numa gives a sort of spiritual recollection of the events since he dies in Society of the Snow. The real Carlitos Páez wrote John Malkovich&#39;s lines in Alive. 
            
 
 What Happened To Every Real-Life Survivor After Society Of The Snow 
All 16 survivors of the 1972 Andes plane crash depicted in Society of the Snow went on to have fulfilling lives. Many wrote books and became speakers.








 9  Society Of The Snow Actually Shot At The Real Andes Crash Site 
        

Parts of Society of the Snow were shot on location at the actual 1972 Andes plane crash site as well as in Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina. Alive was primarily filmed in the Canadian Rocky Mountain range. While both sites achieved a sense of realism with their filming locations, it doesn&#39;t get more accurate than shooting literally where the tragic events of the film took place, which was called the Valley of Tears after the crash.





 8  Society Of The Snow Has Much More Graphic Scenes Than Alive 
        

With 30 years in between Society and the Snow and Alive, it&#39;s no surprise that Society of the Snow has more graphic scenes than Alive does. Due to the changing conventions of what is acceptable to be shown on film, Society of the Snow is more graphic and gory than Alive and allows the story to be depicted with a more accurate sense of realism than ever before.





 7  Society Of The Snow Is A More Accurate Depiction Than Alive 
        

Largely due to the added layers of realism, Society of the Snow is a more accurate depiction of the real-life events following the 1972 Andes plane crash and 72 days of survival than Alive is. Society of the Snow also includes more additional details than Alive does and tells more of an overall straightforward narrative of the events as they actually happened.

 6  Society Of The Snow Has An Entirely South American Cast 
        

One of the biggest criticisms of Alive is that it features a mostly white cast of American and Canadian actors who portray an entirely Uruguayan group of characters. Although Alive features great actors such as John Malkovich and Ethan Hawke, Society of the Snow makes up for the mostly white casting of characters by featuring an exclusively South American cast of Argentine and Uruguayan actors.





 5  The Characters In Society Of The Snow Speak Mainly Spanish 
        

Because of the exclusive casting of Argentine and Uruguayan actors in Society of the Snow, the film is told entirely in Spanish, the language that the real-life passengers and survivors actually speak. Being a Hollywood movie, the dialogue in Alive is spoken completely in English, which does not capture the authenticity of the actual survivors and those who died at all.





 4  Several Real-Life Passengers Are Not Depicted In Alive 
        

Several real-life passengers are not depicted in Alive, including Gaton Costemalle, Alexis Hounie, Guido Magri, Felipe Maquirriain, and Julio Martinez-Lamas. Society of the Snow did an excellent job in honoring most of the passengers and all of the survivors who survived the initial plane crash, although there were some changes made to the characters of the pilot and co-pilot, and their names are not used in the film.

Society of the Snow tells the incredible true story of the Miracle of the Andes. Because the film is so accurate, there are several graphic scenes.








 3  Alive Does Not Include Real-Life Savior Sergio Catalán 
        

Alive makes several alterations to the real-life rescue of the survivors, particularly how Roberto and Nando were first discovered by a Chilean man on horseback. Alive does not depict that scene or the man whose name is Sergio Catalán, but Society of the Snow does include it and how they were actually discovered and rescued. In real life, Catalán tossed them a loaf of bread and rode for hours to the nearest town, which led to the rescue of the other 14 survivors.





 2  The Names Of The Real-Life Deceased Were Changed In Alive 
        

Society of the Snow depicts all of the real-life passengers and survivors by their actual names, while the names of the deceased are not used in Alive. What&#39;s more, Society of the Snow adds the thoughtful layer of displaying the actual names and ages of the deceased on screen at the time of their deaths or the discovery of their bodies. Alive changes all of the names of the deceased, which is why characters like Numa Turcatti are not listed in the cast.





 1  Alive &amp; Society Of The Snow Have Slightly Different Endings 
        

Alive and Society of the Snow have slightly different endings, particularly in how they deal with the aftermath and the hospitalization of the 16 survivors. While Alive pretty much skimps over that part of the story, Society of the Snow briefly depicts the start of the media frenzy that ensued after their rescue. Some hospital scenes are also shown in Society of the Snow as the survivors readjust to life, while Alive ends without getting into it.
