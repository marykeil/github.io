Christopher Nolan&#39;s creative and effective use of time in relationship to his film&#39;s themes of loss, regret, and acceptance has contributed immensely to his filmography providing audiences with some of cinema&#39;s greatest moments ever crafted. Nolan&#39;s esteemed career has seen the writer-director construct some of the best scenes in cinematic history that have lasted for long periods of time, and others that have made an impact on global audiences within a single minute. Additionally, Christopher Nolan&#39;s frequent collaborators have been instrumental in creating many memorable moments in Hollywood, as seen in his feature-length debut, up to his most recent Oppenheimer.

 Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked By How Out Of Order The Story Is 
Time is often a character itself in Christopher Nolanâ€™s movies, from Following to Oppenheimer, with the story rarely being present chronologically. 












 








 12  Following 
The Young Man accompanies Cobb on their first job together in Nolan&#39;s feature-length debut
        

Nolan&#39;s feature-length debut, Following, centers around a writer known as The Young Man, who unwittingly finds himself embroiled in organized crime when he attempts to find a new source of inspiration for his work. Known for its black-and-white photography, Following&#39;s use of three distinct characters throughout various points in the film&#39;s storytelling provides one of the earliest examples of Nolan&#39;s affinity for time. The scene when The Young Man accompanies career criminal Cobb on their first apartment break-in together is the best scene, as it perfectly highlights the moral decay of The Young Man, and it cleverly sets up Cobb&#39;s betrayal of The Young Man at the film&#39;s conclusion.





 11  Memento 
Leonard Shelby recounts his wife&#39;s death in Nolan&#39;s neo-noir psychological thriller


 







  Memento  


  Release Date    May 25, 2001     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Joe Pantoliano , Guy Pearce , Carrie-Anne Moss , Stephen Tobolowsky , Mark Boone Junior     Runtime    113 minutes    


Memento sees amnesiac protagonist Leonard Shelby struggle to solve the mystery of his wife&#39;s murder while interacting with shady lawmen and ruthless criminals. Known for its brilliant use of editing that simulates Leonard&#39;s retrograde amnesia, Memento is rife with single moments that impress upon audiences Nolan&#39;s mastery of his craft. However, the scene in which Leonard recounts to Natalie how he remembers his wife passing away is the most significant. Not only does the scene contradict what Leonard recounts via showing him accidentally killing his wife, it also recontextualizes the events of the story onward and paints Leonard as an unknowing murderer.
The scene is also crucial because it reveals to the audience that Joe Pantoliano&#39;s Teddy Gammell is acutely aware of Leonard&#39;s condition, and is using him as an expendable means of killing undesirables on his behalf without suffering any legal consequences given his status as a police officer. Up to the scene in question, Leonard, and by relation, the audience, believes that Leonard&#39;s wife succumbed to her wounds sustained during a home invasion. However, the scene where Leonard falsely recounts an insurance client of his accidentally killing his wife via insulin overdose changes things entirely when the flashback reveals it was Leonard who delivered the lethal dose.





 10  Insomnia 
Will Dormer tampers with evidence in Nolan&#39;s psychological thriller adaptation
        

Insomnia is Christopher Nolan&#39;s most underrated movie despite featuring two stellar performances from Al Pacino and the late Robin Williams. As the title suggests, the film follows an insomniac police officer who wrestles with his morality after accidentally killing his partner while in pursuit of a dangerous criminal. Rife with beautiful cinematography and dizzying editing that only Nolan can get away with, the brief scene depicting Will Dormer tampering with evidence is Insomnia&#39;s best because it perfectly underlines the film&#39;s themes of one&#39;s morality. Despite his status as a respected lawman, Will isn&#39;t above bending the rules to his own benefit, thus making for engaging discussions between lawman and criminal.





 9  Batman Begins 
Christian Bale dons the Batsuit for the first time in Nolan&#39;s first superhero movie
        

  Batman Begins  


  Release Date    June 10, 2005     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Ken Watanabe , Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Linus Roache , Christian Bale , Katie Holmes , Mark Boone Junior , Michael Caine , Rutger Hauer , Cillian Murphy , Morgan Freeman     Runtime    2h 20m    


Batman Begins is Nolan&#39;s first installment of his Dark Knight trilogy, and despite it being atypical of the filmmaker&#39;s resume, shines as one of the best movies in his filmography because of how well the filmmaker blended the Gotham City mythos with his own sensibilities. While the League of Shadows prologue featured many great scenes, Batman Begins&#39; scene with Christian Bale&#39;s Batman combating thugs on the dock is its best. Batman Begins was the first live-action Batman movie to receive a theatrical release, and its gritty take on Batman&#39;s origin story and adventures as the Caped Crusader effectively reinvented his image after the maligned Joel Schumaker interpretations.
Although each subsequent installment in Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight trilogy improved upon Batman Begins significantly, Bale&#39;s Batman fearlessly fighting thugs while utilizing Batman&#39;s intelligence and improvisational abilities against Zimmer&#39;s moving score spoke volumes to casual and ardent Batman supporters. Moreover, the scene solidified that Batman could work in the modern era despite the less-than-favorable depictions of Gotham City&#39;s defender, thus arguably leading to the explosion of the superhero genre as it is known today. Batman Begins is great for many reasons, but its scene with Bale&#39;s Batman fighting for the first time is its most important and influential.





 8  The Prestige 
Angier and Borden&#39;s final conversation in Nolan&#39;s psychological drama
        

  The Prestige  


  Release Date    October 20, 2006     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Michael Caine , Christian Bale , Hugh Jackman , Scarlett Johansson , Piper Perabo     Runtime    130 minutes    


The Prestige follows two 19th-century magicians who sacrifice everything to best one another and become the greatest magician who ever lived. Rife with tense action, twists, and turns, The Prestige is best remembered for its incredible effects and amazing performances by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. While the teleportation scene ranks highly, The Prestige&#39;s final conversation between Bale&#39;s Borden and Jackman&#39;s Angier is its best because it shows that underneath the competition, lies a mutual respect for one another as magicians. Furthermore, Angier&#39;s proclamation of the audience&#39;s happiness being the most important thing adds a subtext to the movie that gives its prior events new meaning.





 7  The Dark Knight 
The Joker&#39;s introduction via bank robbery in Nolan&#39;s acclaimed Batman Begins sequel


 







  The Dark Knight  


  Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes    


The Dark Knight is perhaps best remembered for Health Ledger&#39;s career-defining role as The Joker in Nolan&#39;s critically acclaimed sequel to Batman Begins. While Batman Begins recontextualized audience perception of Batman, Ledger&#39;s performance as the manic Joker had a similar impact as soon as his interpretation of the character hit the screen. While any given Joker scene contains at least one thought-provoking quote, The Joker&#39;s introduction is the movie&#39;s best scene, as it perfectly establishes the movie&#39;s tone and themes through the character&#39;s actions and monologues. As such, each of his lines has a double meaning, and his ability to challenge Batman and audiences is almost second to none.
            
 
 All 12 Christopher Nolan Movies Ranked Worst To Best 
Christopher Nolan is one of the most acclaimed, distinctive filmmakers of his generation. Here&#39;s our ranking of his films from worst to best.








 6  Inception 
Arthur fights a henchman in a rotating hallway in Nolan&#39;s science fiction action film
        

  Inception  


  Release Date    July 16, 2010     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Tom Hardy , elliot page , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Cillian Murphy , Ken Watanabe , Marion Cotillard , Leonardo DiCaprio     Runtime    148 minutes    


Inception follows a group of career criminals whose leader, Dom Cobb, accepts an opportunity to test out technology that allows one to invade another&#39;s dreams and extract crucial information. After accepting a task deemed impossible in exchange for his career past being wiped clean, Cobb &amp; Co. experience strange events that make them question reality. Filled with riveting action and impressive effects, Inception&#39;s scene featuring Joseph Gordon-Levitt&#39;s Arthur fighting henchmen while trapped inside a dream is its best. The scene is visually stunning and filled with complex choreography, and it perfectly highlights Cobb&#39;s crew&#39;s loyalty to him in a way never before seen in cinema.





 5  The Dark Knight Rises 
Bane breaks the Bat in the conclusion to Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight trilogy
        

  The Dark Knight Rises  


  Release Date    August 16, 2012     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Christian Bale , Anne Hathaway , Michael Caine , Gary Oldman     Runtime    2h 45m    


The Dark Knight is the conclusion to Nolan&#39;s Dark Knight trilogy, and despite not achieving the same degree of fanfare as its predecessor, still remains one of the best movies in the Batman franchise as well as Nolan&#39;s filmography. The scene in which Bane breaks Batman&#39;s back is its best because it highlights the diametrically opposed philosophies of Gotham&#39;s defender and Gotham&#39;s would-be destroyer. Furthermore, the scene&#39;s intense fight choreography, chiaroscuro lighting, that is, its heavy usage of sharp shadows, combined with Tom Hardy&#39;s monologue about the shadows recreates one of the comics&#39; best moments while also creating one of cinema&#39;s.





 4  Interstellar 
Cooper detaches in Nolan&#39;s epic science fiction film
        

  Interstellar  


  Release Date    November 7, 2014     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Anne Hathaway , Matthew McConaughey , Jessica Chastain , Ellen Burstyn , Michael Caine , Bill Irwin     Runtime    2h 49m    


Interstellar follows astronauts and scientists as they endure the rigors of a futuristic Earth consumed by famine in a film that&#39;s ultimately about family and the power of love. Featuring incredible practical effects and cinematography designed to simulate space travel and otherworldly phenomena such as traveling through a black hole, one of Interstellar&#39;s best singular moments in the film is the scene in which Matthew McCoughnahey&#39;s Cooper detaches during the Gargantua scene after promising her he wouldn&#39;t. As hard of a scene to watch as it is, it highlights Cooper&#39;s perpetually caring personality, and it also treats audiences to some of the filmmaker&#39;s most intense visual work.





 3  Dunkirk 
Tommy Jensen and Alex&#39;s train ride back home in Nolan&#39;s historical war epic thriller
        

  Dunkirk  


  Release Date    July 21, 2017     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Kenneth Branagh , Aneurin Barnard , Mark Rylance , Tom Hardy , James D&#39;Arcy , Jack Lowden , Cillian Murphy , Harry Styles , Fionn Whitehead , Barry Keoghan     Runtime    106 minutes    


Dunkirk centers around the combined efforts of Belgium, France, and the British Commonwealth and Empire as they fight against the oppressive forces of the Nazis in a film about perseverance and the human spirit. Featuring a moving score by Zimmer and some of Nolan&#39;s most breathtaking photography, Dunkirk&#39;s climactic scene briefly showing the success and sacrifice of everyone&#39;s efforts in defeating the Nazis is its most poignant. After seeing allied forces on land, air, and sea working tirelessly to win a losing battle, the film&#39;s Tommy Jensen and Alex reading about the success of their efforts satisfyingly concludes their conflict while inspiring audiences to always fight the good fight.





 2  Tenet 
The Protagonist fights in reverse in Nolan&#39;s science fiction spy thriller
        

  Tenet  


  Release Date    September 3, 2020     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Kenneth Branagh , John David Washington , Michael Caine , Robert Pattinson , Elizabeth Debicki , Dimple Kapadia , Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Clemence Poesy     Runtime    150 minutes    


Arguably Nolan&#39;s most challenging film, Tenet follows an unnamed protagonist as he works with members of various specialized organizations to uncover a conspiracy revolving around time inversion technology. Featuring impressive action sequences and a plot perfect for a James Bond movie, Tenet&#39;s best scene occurs when John David Washington&#39;s Protagonist fights armed military personnel inside a confined hallway. The scene perfectly displays Nolan&#39;s inversion mechanic while also hinting at the Protagonist&#39;s true role in the story without either him or audiences knowing it. The scene is tense, and its future revelation that the Protagonist was fighting an inverted version of himself truly boggles the mind.





 1  Oppenheimer 
J. Robert Oppenheimer considers the future implications of his creations in Nolan&#39;s epic biographical thriller


 







 
  Oppenheimer  


  Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr. , Rami Malek , Florence Pugh     Runtime    150 Minutes    


Oppenheimer is Nolan&#39;s biographical historical epic about the key life events that inspired American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer to develop the atomic bomb during World War II. Featuring an Oscar-worthy performance by star Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is ultimately about the moral implications of the physicist&#39;s work and how future generations will be impacted by it. No scene better exemplifies the film&#39;s theme than its last, as it sees Oppenheimer pontificate on what might happen to the world now that it has the ability to launch nukes upon itself during a crisis after having a heartfelt discussion with none other than Albert Einstein.
Although it is meant to be bittersweet, Oppenheimer&#39;s ending is ultimately one of Nolan&#39;s more optimistic, as it compels audiences to consider the role they play in Earth&#39;s development, and more importantly, the human condition. While it&#39;s understandable to see the perspective from which Oppenheimer views things, the film&#39;s ending scene ultimately wants audiences to adopt a more loving and benevolent outlook on humanity in order to prevent Oppenheimer&#39;s worst fears from coming true. Any of Oppenheimer&#39;s crucial scenes could have been its best, but Christopher Nolan&#39;s brilliant flashforward scene in Oppenheimer&#39;s thought-provoking climax is without a doubt its most significant.
