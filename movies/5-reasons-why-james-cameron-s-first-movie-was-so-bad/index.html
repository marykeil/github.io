  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>James Cameron started his career in Hollywood as a special effects director before transitioning to directing.
The production of Piranha II was plagued with constant changes and creative differences, leading to a muddled vision.
The film attempted to expand on the success of the original Piranha by introducing flying piranhas, but ended up being a mismatched project with poor acting, script, score, and editing.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>James Cameron is a legendary director who appears to only produce hits, that is, apart from his first film, Piranhas II, which was a total disaster.</p>
<p>James Cameron is arguably the most bankable director in Hollywood, but his first official movie struggled to make an impression. Cameron got his start in the industry by working behind the scenes in the special effects department for movies like Escape From New York and Battle Beyond The Stars. Having made reasonable success in these areas, he was fortunate (or unfortunate, depending on the outlook) enough to land the position as head of special effects in 1982&rsquo;s Piranha II: The Spawning. The film was set to follow up a surprise hit film which was a parody of 1975&rsquo;s Jaws.
However, the film appears to have been quite disorganized behind the scenes with many of the crew hired and fired in a short turnaround. Cameron himself was at one point promoted to the position of director and worked on the project for a few weeks, before he was also let go from the project (via Terminator Files). Despite this, Cameron&rsquo;s name still appears as the director on the project, and his influence, even in the short time he was in the role of director, was vital.</p>
<p>5  James Cameron Wasn&rsquo;t Really Hired As The Director
He Was The Head Of Special Effects</p>
<p>James Cameron had yet to earn a directorial credit in Hollywood, so he was keen to cut his teeth and get his name out there. With determination and dedication, Cameron was able to land work on other productions and build up experience, which led to him being recognized for his work in special effects. He was then able to use this experience as a way in on other films with the hope and intention of eventually transitioning from leading the effects, to leading the entire production.
Cameron was in the right place at the right time and put himself forward to direct when the previous director, Miller Drake, decided to step away from the project. Despite how challenging the environment may have been for Piranha II, it is a testament to Cameron&rsquo;s work ethic that he worked hard to create something for a film that appeared doomed, and didn&rsquo;t step away until he was let go by the producer, Ovidio Assinitis. Assinitis then stepped in as director to complete the project, leaving Cameron to go and work on other projects.</p>
<p>Titanic Is Still James Cameron’s Greatest Achievement (Not Avatar 1 Or 2)
James Cameron&rsquo;s greatest film remains 1997&rsquo;s Titanic, which lives in a realm far superior to that of his popular, yet severely flawed, Avatar movies.</p>
<p>4  The Creative Team Was Constantly Shifting On Piranha 2
Resulting In A Muddled Vision</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Cameron&rsquo;s Piranha II endured some significant changes behind the scenes. While the first film became a surprising success, the producers, director, lead actors and almost everyone involved decided to part ways with the project and not return for the sequel. As a result, the rights were sold to a new production company, and Miller Drake was hired to direct. However, Drake was let go before principal photography took place.
It was at this point that Cameron was offered the role as director and stepped up to give it his best shot. However, creative differences were rife during the production which likely led to the finished product being subpar, and confusing. Rather than a clear voice and direction taking the project from start to finish, the film suffered from having too many hands involved. What Cameron did could have been the best parts of the movie, but the fact that he was let go and the project continued to be jumbled together without his input certainly didn&rsquo;t help the finished film.</p>
<p>3  The Sequel To A Jaws Rip-Off
Piranha Had Some Success</p>
<p>Jaws was incredibly popular in 1975 and immediately drew attention from several studios and creatives for the movies&rsquo; innovative way of telling a horror story and using sealife as a very real threat. Jaws inspired several parodies and rip-offs in the years after it was released, and Piranha happened to be one such project which gained some success and recognition. In fact, the film even garnered some praise and acknowledgment from the original director of Jaws, Steven Spielberg, who said that Piranha was &ldquo;the best of the Jaws rip-offs&rdquo; (via The Daily Jaws).
The first movie was helped by its self-awareness and acknowledgment of the silly nature of the film, but Pirhana II took things too far and became a more serious effort to impose its terrifying concept as something worth squirming in theaters about. However, when lightning struck and made the original a success, the creatives would have done well to stop there, and as mentioned above, many of them did. Taking the story out for another chapter and building on the ridiculous premise that was only suitable as a parody was just another misstep in the comedy of errors which made this project.</p>
<p>8 Times James Cameron’s Movies Massively Changed Hollywood
James Cameron is one of the greatest innovators and most bankable directors in Hollywood, having changed the game over the course of his career.</p>
<p>2  The Piranhas Could Fly
Because Threats In The Depths Weren&rsquo;t Enough</p>
<p>Piranha II had one distinct difference from the original. While Piranha saw a group of beachgoers terrified by the bloodthirsty fish that lay in wait just below the water&rsquo;s surface, Piranha II decided to increase the threat and bring it straight to them. The film goes on to explain that a group of scientists has been working on the ultimate weapon, a breed of genetically modified piranhas with the ability to fly. However, the team lost a container which was storing these incredibly dangerous creatures in the water and are now scrambling to subdue the threat, but the ocean is a big place.
First of all, how are fish with an uncontrollable taste for flesh and the ability to fly the &ldquo;ultimate weapon.&rdquo; The creatures have no guaranteed way of controlling or targeting specific individuals, and the inept scientists in charge prove how unstable and detrimental these creatures are when they lost them and have no way to get them back before they cause havoc in the area. Movies can be silly, but when they start to move far beyond that point into the downright ridiculous, it doesn&rsquo;t help to keep audiences interested.</p>
<p>1  Nothing Was Fully Fleshed Out
The Acting, Script, Score, And Editing Were Terrible</p>
<p>Initially, Miller Drake was hopeful that Kevin McCarthy, who played the scientist, Dr. Robert Hoak, in the first film, would return to star in this project. With that in mind, the story was built around his character doing experiments on the piranhas to imbue them with the ability to fly. Once again, due to the lack of clear vision and differing views among the crew, the project had to change several times. Nothing was fully realized, and the film ended up as a mismatched project with almost every element suffering in quality and polish.
HadCameron been allowed to assume more creative control, or if he had joined the project earlier, it&rsquo;s likely the vision would have at least been more coherent with one leading voice. However, Cameron still put in a solid effort, proved his skills as someone with great abilities in special effects and, in his short weeks as the director for the project, he put together many of the shots which would be the foundation for the film. His directorial debut was less than perfect, but James Cameron put in his best effort with the tools he was given, and just a few years later, created something spectacular with The Terminator.</p>
