# Genius Movie Theory Claims Back To The Future 4 Secretly Happened 20 Years Ago


## SUMMARY 



  Back to the Future 4 was speculated for years, but a theory suggests that The Polar Express is the unofficial extension of the franchise.   The Polar Express features several Easter eggs that connect it to Back to the Future, such as the presence of a flux capacitor and references to the Lone Pine Mall.   While there is no official confirmation, viewers theorize that The Polar Express could be considered as a stealth Back to the Future 4, with Santa potentially being Dr. Brown and the engineers being his grandchildren.

## Literature Review

Back to the Future 4 never officially materialized, but according to a genius movie theory, the movie might have unofficially happened 20 years ago.




According to a genius movie theory, Back to the Future 4 happened two decades ago. Back to the Future 3 had a satisfying conclusion where Marty and Dr. Brown split paths. While Doc started a family in the past, Marty decided to return to the present. However, even though the franchise resolved its overarching storyline in the third movie&#39;s final arc, viewers could not help but speculate how a fourth movie would happen.




Over the years, several fascinating theories have speculated how the movie franchise would return with a new installment. A deepfake video, with Tom Holland as Marty and Robert Downey Jr. as Doc, also surfaced online, sparking rumors surrounding a Back to the Future remake. But while all of this was happening, a movie secretly presented itself as a spiritual Back to the Future 4, giving the franchise and its universe an unofficial but brilliant extension.

  1:49                       Back To The Future Secretly Told You Its Ending In The First 5 Seconds Of The Movie   Back to the Future’s opening sequence expertly sets up the rest of the movie, and the first few seconds even subtly give away its ending.   


 Polar Express&#39; Back To The Future Easter Eggs Explained 
Polar Express features several intriguing nods to Back to the Future
         

Polar Express features many Back to the Future Easter eggs. However, out of all of them, the one that directly connects it to the classic time travel film comes midway through its runtime in the scene where Hero Boy looks for the train&#39;s cotter pin in its engine room. In a blink-or-miss moment, a flux capacitor can be spotted in the engine room. In Back to the Future, the flux capacitor was the most crucial component in Dr. Emmett Brown&#39;s time-traveling DeLorean. Considering how the central train in Polar Express makes it to the North Pole on time, it makes sense that it had to have the flux capacitor to make the round trip.




Another intriguing nod to Back to the Future in The Polar Express can be noticed in its opening arc. Hero Boy collects newspapers that prove Santa Claus does not exist. One of these newspapers in The Polar Express features an image of Santas protesting with signs that say, &#34;Santa is on STRIKE: Say yes to Lone Pine Mall construction.&#34; Lone Pine is the name of the same mall where Brown showed his DeLorean time machine to Marty. In Polar Express, Hero Boy quotes, “I’ve wanted to do this my whole life!” after pulling the whistle of the central train. This is a callback to the Back to the Future III scene where Doc says, “I’ve wanted to do that all my life!” after taking over the steam locomotive and pulling its horn.

These connective threads between the two Robert Zemeckis movies have convinced many viewers that The Polar Express could be a stealth Back to the Future 4. Many have theorized that the central train in The Polar Express is the same steam train that Dr. Brown operates in Back to the Future III&#39;s closing arc. Since Santa can manipulate time by delivering presents to every house at midnight, he could be Dr. Brown, who uses his technologies to make the world a better place. Just like Doc&#39;s DeLorean, Santa&#39;s sleigh in The Polar Express also leaves a trail of fire behind before disappearing in the sky.

The theory also posits that the engineers, Smokey and Steamer, in The Polar Express&#39; central train are Doc&#39;s grandchildren. This would explain why, like Doc, Smokey and Steamer seem incredibly smart and even put their lives on the line to ensure the train reaches the North Pole. Apart from being smart, they are also eccentric like Dr. Brown, and come up with unconventional solutions for technical glitches in the train. Considering how both films have been directed by Robert Zemeckis, the Back to the Future references in The Polar Express could be mere nods to his previous work. As a viewer, however, it is still fun to theorize how Polar Express could be Back to the Future 4.






Robert Zemeckis has also made no official statements about the two movies being set in the same universe.






 Polar Express Is The  st We&#39;ll Come To Back To The Future 4 
Back to the Future 4 is likely never happening
          

Doc Brown actor Christopher Lloyd revealed (via Yahoo! Entertainment) that, even though Back to the Future 4 was being seriously considered at some point, its likelihood seems low since the three movies have a well-rounded overarching narrative. He added that &#34;if somebody came up with an incredibly unique story for number four,&#34; the fourth movie might see the light of day. However, since it has been over three decades since Back to the Future III first hit the big screens, it would be safe to believe that Polar Express is the closest we will come to Back to the Future 4.
