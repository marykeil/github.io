 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire&#39;s New Cast &amp; Characters Explained 
          

Egon Spengler was one of the four original Ghostbusters, but because Harold Ramis passed away in 2014, the character was resurrected through CGI for 2021&#39;s Afterlife. The spirit of Egon also lives on through his daughter, Callie (Coon), and grandchildren, Trevor (Wolfhard) and Phoebe (Grace). Though other Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire images showed Janine (Annie Potts) suiting up as Egon&#39;s replacement, the latest image, coupled with Reitman&#39;s comments, suggests that Lars Pinfield will be his true successor.

Lars Pinfield is played by the British comedian James Acaster, who is known for co-hosting the food podcast Off Menu. In Frozen Empire, Lars is the one responsible for innovating new technology for the Ghostbusters, similar to how Egon (with Ray&#39;s assistance) developed the technology behind the P.K.E. Meter, the Proton Pack, the Trap, the Aura Video-Analyzer, and the Etco Goggles. In addition to Lars, other newcomers in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire include Patton Oswalt as Dr. Hubert Wartzki and Kumail Nanjiani as Nadeem Razmaadi, though not much is known about these characters.






Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire releases on March 22.
