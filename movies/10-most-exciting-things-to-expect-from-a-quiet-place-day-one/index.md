## Literature Review



A Quiet Place: Day One is closer than ever, and here are the 10 most exciting things to expect from the upcoming film. A prequel to A Quiet Place has the opportunity for all kinds of worldbuilding, reveals, and new story moments, with the highly-anticipated film setting the stage for some major changes to the A Quiet Place universe. While details on the upcoming film are still being held tightly under wraps, it has become clear that several aspects of A Quiet Place: Day One will be immensely exciting. So, here&#39;s a breakdown of what to expect when A Quiet Place: Day One finally releases.
John Krasinski&#39;s 2018 film A Quiet Place was a build on a simple gimmick, with the characters having to remain completely silent in order to avoid killer sound-sensitive aliens. This basic premise led to the first film being a massive critical and commercial success, spawning the ever-growing A Quiet Place franchise. After the release of A Quiet Place Part II, a prequel film titled A Quiet Place: Day One was announced, with it presumably exploring the titular first day of the alien invasion. The third film in the A Quiet Place franchise will add tons of aspects to the series, making fans immensely excited for the upcoming prequel.

 10  Day One Will Be A Quiet Place Movie With A Lot Of Talking 


Close







One of the most exciting aspects of A Quiet Place: Day One is that the prequel film will finally be A Quiet Place movie with a lot of talking. The previous two A Quiet Place films were built on their gimmick of the characters being completely silent, although after two movies this trick has grown a little stale. Luckily, the films made it clear that it took a while for the world to realize that being silent is what stopped the aliens from attacking, meaning that A Quiet Place: Day One will probably be filled with a lot of talking, which is a change of pace for the franchise.





 9  New Big Name Actors Will Join The A Quiet Place Universe 
        

It is still unknown if A Quiet Place: Day One will include Emily Blunt, John Krasinski, or the rest of the stars of the previous films. However, several big name actors have already been announced to be part of the A Quiet Place: Day One cast, meaning that these stars will finally be joining the A Quiet Place universe. A Quiet Place: Day One has added Lupita Nyong&#39;o, Joseph Quinn, Alex Wolff, and Denis O&#39;Hare, and while these actors are exciting enough, more casting announcements are sure to come in the future.





 8  A Quiet Place: Day One Will Change The Franchise&#39;s Genre 
        

Another major change of pace that A Quiet Place: Day One will feature is a change in the franchise&#39;s genre. The previous A Quiet Place movies have been post-apocalyptic horror movies, with the movies taking place a while after the aliens destroyed society. However, A Quiet Place: Day One will take place during the initial invasion, making the movie an alien invasion thriller. The focus on the downfall of society will put A Quiet Place: Day One on a much bigger scale than the previous films, which is pretty exciting.





 7  A Quiet Place: Day One Can Explain How &amp; Why The Aliens Came To Earth 
       The monster in A Quiet Place.  

A Quiet Place: Day One can answer a lot of burning questions about the franchise&#39;s world, allowing it to unveil the answers to some major mysteries about the alien invasion. While the franchise has hinted at the aliens&#39; backstories, very little is known about how they got to Earth and why they came. A Quiet Place: Day One can explore other characters that find out this answer, finally giving the deadly creatures a greater backstory than has been seen before.





 6  The Initial Stages Of The Invasion Will Be Shown In A Quiet Place: Day One 
        

Since A Quiet Place: Day One will be focusing on the first day of the horror, that means that the initial stages of the invasion will be shown in the film. The prequel can show the initial reactions of the world as they begin to see those around them slaughtered by the aliens, with the outbreak of panic quickly spreading across the world. The catastrophic initial moments will be horrifying, but they are also sure to be some of the most exciting parts of A Quiet Place: Day One.





 5  A Quiet Place: Day One May Explore The Island More 
        

One of the most interesting pieces of A Quiet Place Part II was the island, with it being a safe haven for humans after the alien invasion. Although things didn&#39;t end well for the island, with an alien eventually crossing the water on a boat, the plan seemed to work for a while. Djimon Hounsou played one of the island dwellers in A Quiet Place Part II, and he will be returning in A Quiet Place: Day One, meaning that the film can explore how he got there and how the mini-civilization got started.





 4  More Locations Can Be Seen In A Quiet Place: Day One 
        

While A Quiet Place has been great so far, one of its weak points is that it has only focused on where the Abbot family is, meaning that it hasn&#39;t been able to explore other locations where the aliens have invaded. Since A Quiet Place: Day One seems to be focusing on different characters, that means that the prequel can explore different locations, showing how other groups of people reacted to the alien invasion.

 3  A New Director Will Take On The A Quiet Place Franchise 
        

John Krasinski starred in A Quiet Place, but he also directed both A Quiet Place movies so far, meaning that the franchise has been his vision throughout. However, Pig director Michael Sarnoski will be taking over for Krasinski for A Quiet Place: Day One, marking the first time that a different director has helmed an A Quiet Place film.





 2  A Quiet Place Can Explore The Abbots&#39; Lives Before The Apocalypse 
        

While it hasn&#39;t been confirmed if Blunt, Krasinski, and the rest of the stars of the first two A Quiet Place movies will be returning, it&#39;s always possible that they could. If this is the case, then A Quiet Place: Day One can explore the lives of the Abbot family before the apocalypse, finally giving a look at who they were before the alien invasion. This could flesh out these characters in some big ways, with the potential for more Abbot info being immensely exciting.





 1  Day One Can Set The Stage For A Quiet Place Part III 
        

Finally, one of the most exciting aspects of A Quiet Place: Day One is that it could set the stage for A Quiet Place Part III. Characters from the prequel could meet the Abbots in the third mainline film and work together, or a plot device could be set up that is important to the Abbot&#39;s stories in the third film. There are tons of ways that A Quiet Place: Day One could set up A Quiet Place Part III, making the film far more than just a prequel.
