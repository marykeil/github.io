## Literature Review

Former and existing Scream cast members Jenna Ortega, Melissa Barrera, Mason Gooding and a few others reunite at MPTF&#39;s 17th Annual Evening. 




Existing and previous Scream 7 cast members all reunite amid ongoing controversy behind the scenes. The scream franchise initially kicked off in 1996 with the release of Wes Craven’s eponymous movie, which helped revive the popular slasher genre. Following the release of the first movie, the franchise has gone on to produce six other films, with a seventh installment already announced to be on the way. The forthcoming Scream 7, however, is currently mired in a number of production issues which started with the dismissal of Melissa Barrera, the talented actress who played Sam Carpenter in the franchise’s two previous installments.




Now, following all the drama and controversy, the Scream 7 cast members have all reunited in a short video posted by Film Updates on X/Twitter.


 

The short video features Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, both of whom have left the Scream 7 cast, alongside other familiar faces like Mason Gooding, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Liana Liberato, Tony Revolori, Skeet Ulrich and Jack Quaid.


 The Scream 7 Controversy Explained 
          

A few months after Scream 7 was confirmed, Spyglass Entertainment, the production company behind the recent Scream movies, announced that Barrera had been fired. Various sources reported that Barrera was fired due to her recent pro-Palestinian posts that stirred up controversy online. The production company came out to issue a statement following Barrera’s dismissal, claiming they have “zero tolerance for antisemitism or the incitement of hate in any form”.






In the wake of these cast exits, Christopher Landon, the director who was brought in to direct the seventh installment of the Scream franchise, also quit.




Shortly after Barrera’s exit from the franchise, Jenna Ortega, who played Tara Carpenter in previous Scream movies, also exited the franchise, partially due to scheduling conflicts with the season 2 of Netflix’s hit horror series Wednesday. In the wake of these cast exits, Christopher Landon, the director who was brought in to direct the seventh installment of the Scream franchise, also quit.

  1:52                       Melissa Barrera&#39;s Perfect Replacement For Scream 7 Is Releasing In 3 Months   Melissa Barrera may not be returning for Scream 7, but the actor has another horror movie coming out this year that could be the perfect replacement.   

The major exits from the Scream 7 team have left the movie in a state of limbo. Following these major exits, there has been no significant news regarding new cast members or even a new director. It could, however, be that the studio is struggling to replace the exited stars or there have been updates behind the scenes and the production company is only waiting for the controversies to blow over before they make any announcements. Either way, it will be interesting to see what eventually becomes of this proposed movie in the coming months.
