## Literature Review

After ten years, the DCEU came to an end, and some of its movies did better than others at the box office, with great highs and shocking lows.




Some DCEU movies did better at the box office than others. The DCEU is finally over. The universe started in 2013 with Zack Snyder&#39;s Man of Steel, and after ten years of good and bad DCEU movies, the cinematic universe has come to an end. DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran will now chart the next 10 years of the new DC Universe, with several upcoming DCU movies and TV shows already announced.
The DCU&#39;s first movie, Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy, will have quite the challenge to face. The final four movies of the DCEU that were released in 2023 all underperformed at the box office, showing that audience interest in DC seems to be at an all-time low. While the end of the DCEU was not as epic as fans expected it to be, the cinematic universe managed to have multiple major wins at the box office over the DCEU&#39;s ten years, and some of them could help inform the new DCU. Here are all 15 DCEU movies ranked by box office earnings according to data from the specialized website The Numbers.
            
 
 26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far  
James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.












 








 15  Blue Beetle Made $128.7 Million Internationally 
Blue Beetle Was Originally Meant To Release On Max


 







  Blue Beetle  


  Release Date    August 18, 2023     Director    Angel Manuel Soto     Cast    Xolo Mariduena , Susan Sarandon , Raoul Max Trujillo , Harvey Guillen , George Lopez , Elpidia Carrillo , Bruna Marquezine    


While Blue Beetle was developed by the old DC executives, Xolo Maridueña&#39;s Jaime Reyes has been confirmed to be among the canon characters of the new DC Universe. Blue Beetle was an entertaining movie that did right by Jaime Reyes. The movie&#39;s poor box office can be chalked down to two factors. The DCEU had already been announced to end, and audiences stopped caring about the controversial universe&#39;s final movies. Blue Beetle is also not really well known outside of the comics, and with interest in the DCEU low, not many thought it was worth the trip to theaters to see an unknown character.

With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.








 14  Shazam! Fury of the Gods Made $132.1 Million Internationally 
The End Of The DCEU Impacted The Shazam! Sequel


 







  Shazam! The Fury of the Gods  


  Release Date    March 17, 2023     Director    David F. Sandberg     Cast    Helen Mirren , Adam Brody​ , Michelle Borth , Faithe Herman , Jack Dylan Grazer , Ian Chen , Jovan Armand , Asher Angel , Lucy Liu , Ross Butler , Marta Milans , Meagan Good , Cooper Andrews , Rachel Zegler , Zachary Levi , D.J. Cotrona , grace fulton    


Shazam! Fury of the Gods is the DCEU&#39;s second-lowest movie at the worldwide box office and is also the second movie in a row on the list to have been released in 2023. After the original Shazam! did well at the box office in 2019, its sequel failed to reach even half of the first movie&#39;s total gross. As Shazam is a sillier hero whose name is not as strong with audiences as that of Batman or Superman, it makes sense that the movie would suffer from the terrible state of the DCEU with fans near the universe&#39;s end.





 13  Wonder Woman 1984 Made $166.3 Million Internationally 
Wonder Woman 1984 Released Simultaneously On HBO Max


 







  Wonder Woman 1984  


  Release Date    December 25, 2020     Director    Patty Jenkins     Cast    Gal Gadot , Chris Pine , Pedro Pascal , Kristoffer Polaha , Connie Nielsen , Gabriella Wilde , Kristen Wiig , Robin Wright , Manoj Anand    


Wonder Woman 1984 was a major step down for Gal Gadot in the DCEU. Not only was the movie worse than the original Wonder Woman, but the sequel fell extremely short of Diana Prince&#39;s first solo movie at the box office. While the negative word-of-mouth over the movie&#39;s controversial story decisions would have contributed to it not matching the original Wonder Woman&#39;s box office, the sequel was affected by Warner Bros. Discovery&#39;s decision to release Wonder Woman 1984 in theaters and on HBO Max — now only Max — on the same day.





 12  The Suicide Squad Made $167 Million Internationally 
The Suicide Squad Also Released On HBO Max On The Same Day


 







  The Suicide Squad  


  Release Date    August 6, 2021     Director    James Gunn     Cast    Viola Davis , Daniela Melchior , Taika Waititi , Pete Davidson , Idris Elba , Peter Capaldi , Alice Braga , Joel Kinnaman , Sean Gunn , Jai Courtney , Margot Robbie , Storm Reid , Jennifer Holland , Michael Rooker , Mayling Ng , Nathan Fillion , John Cena    


Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad was another of the DCEU movies that were affected by the pandemic, debuting in theaters and on HBO Max on the same day. Despite being among the very best-reviewed DCEU movies and attracting just as much praise from fans as it did critics, The Suicide Squad&#39;s simultaneous streaming release ended up deeply impacting the movie&#39;s box office. Another reason for the sequel&#39;s poor performance is that despite making a great earning worldwide, 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad was heavily criticized by audiences and critics alike.





 11  Birds Of Prey Made $201 Million Internationally 
Birds Of Prey Was Rated R


 







  Birds of Prey  


  Release Date    February 7, 2020     Director    Cathy Yan     Cast    Jurnee Smollett-Bell , Matthew Willig , Bojana Novakovic , Ali Wong , Ewan McGregor , Charlene Amoia , Margot Robbie , Rosie Perez , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Chris Messina    


Birds of Prey struggled at the box office mainly due to two factors. The movie misunderstood who its audience was, as there was really no need for the film to be rated R in the first place. While the rating allowed for more brutal fights and mature themes, Birds of Prey would likely have been quite more successful if a wider audience could watch it. The movie was also released just before several theaters across the world would close due to the COVID-19 pandemic.





 10  The Flash Made $266.5 Million Internationally 
The Flash Was Riddled With Several Controversies


 







  The Flash  


  Release Date    June 16, 2023     Director    Andres Muschietti     Cast    Ezra Miller , Michael Keaton , Ben Affleck , Sasha Calle , Michael Shannon    


While The Flash received a lot of praise from Gunn and celebrities like Tom Cruise before its release, the DCEU movie would become one of the biggest box office bombs in history. Before the release of the movie, star Ezra Miller had been in the public eye for a series of controversies over two years. That, allied to the announcement of the end of the DCEU and leaks revealing The Flash&#39;s poor CGI and awful cameo decisions before it was release, led to The Flash bombing.

 9  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom Made $337.1 Million Internationally (Not Final) 
Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom Actually Surpassed Expectations


 







  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom  


  Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    James Wan     Cast    Jason Momoa , Amber Heard , Patrick Wilson , Dolph Lundgren , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Temuera Morrison    


While Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will end its theatrical run — which is still going on at the time of writing — significantly short of the original Aquaman&#39;s box office, the movie has done quite well. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom became the DCEU&#39;s 2023 box office champion. The movie is projected to end its worldwide run with over $400 million, which would make it the DCEU&#39;s best since 2018&#39;s Aquaman.

 8  Shazam! Made $363.5 Million Internationally 
Shazam! Was A Refreshing DCEU Story


 







  Shazam!  


  Release Date    April 5, 2019     Director    David F. Sandberg     Cast    Faithe Herman , Jack Dylan Grazer , Ian Chen , Asher Angel , Marta Milans , Mark Strong , Cooper Andrews , Andi Osho , grace fulton , Zachary Levi , Ron Cephas Jones , Ava Preston    


The original Shazam! did fairly well at the box office for a character that was not known by many outside of comic book readers. On a $100 million budget, 2019&#39;s Shazam! secured a profit at the box office due to how unique it felt amid the DCEU. While the universe as a whole became known for its darkness, Shazam! was a refreshing ray of light in the middle of it all, telling an emotional story of a boy becoming a hero and finding his place in the world.





 7  Black Adam Made $390.3 Million Internationally 
Black Adam Was Set Up To Be Bigger Than It Could Deliver


 







  Black Adam  


  Release Date    October 21, 2022     Director    Jaume Collet-Serra     Cast    Noah Centineo , Pierce Brosnan , Mo Amer , Marwan Kenzari , Aldis Hodge , Bodhi Sabongui , Uli Latukefu , James Cusati-Moyer , Dwayne Johnson , Sarah Shahi , Quintessa Swindell    


The hierarchy of power in the DC universe did not change with the release of Black Adam. Before the movie was released, Dwayne Johnson made many promises to turn in a DCEU film like no other. While the movie&#39;s action scenes were engaging and the introduction of the Justice Society of America, as well as Henry Cavill&#39;s return as Superman for a cameo, were well-received, Black Adam failed to be the universe-changing crowd-pleaser that The Rock promised.





 6  Justice League Made $655.9 Million Internationally 
Justice League Had A Tumultuous Behind-The-Scenes


 







  Justice League  


  Release Date    November 17, 2017     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Jeremy Irons , Gal Gadot , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Ciarán Hinds , Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Ezra Miller , J. K. Simmons , Jason Momoa , Ray Fisher    


2017&#39;s Justice League failed to reach the level of Marvel Studios&#39; The Avengers, despite the many behind-the-scenes changes that were made to try to achieve that goal. Zack Snyder was phased out of the movie after a personal loss and replaced with The Avengers&#39; director, Joss Whedon, who helmed extensive reshoots to make the movie&#39;s tone lighter and more. Due to the finished movie being all over the place, Justice League, which should have been a $1 billion movie, fell severely short of expectations.





 5  Man of Steel Made $668 Million Internationally 
Man Of Steel Was The DCEU&#39;s First Movie


 







  Man of Steel  


  Release Date    June 14, 2013     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe    


Man of Steel was the first movie in the DCEU. As such, Cavill&#39;s Superman debut was not impacted by the future controversies that future movies, and even Man of Steel&#39;s ending, would bring to the DCEU. Man of Steel&#39;s box office was more than enough to make it the highest-grossing Superman solo movie by a comfortable margin.





 4  Suicide Squad Made $745.7 Million Internationally 
Suicide Squad Had Insanely Good Marketing


 







  Suicide Squad  


  Release Date    August 5, 2016     Director    David Ayer     Cast    Joel Kinnaman , Will Smith , Cara Delevingne , Jai Courtney , Jared Leto , Viola Davis , Margot Robbie , Jay Hernandez , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Scott Eastwood    


2016&#39;s Suicide Squad was not a good movie, which is not exactly director David Ayer&#39;s fault, as the studio released a different cut of the film than the one he wanted. That was done as a response to fan reception of Suicide Squad&#39;s trailers, which were extremely popular and painted a different movie than the one Ayer made, and so the studio tried to make it real. With fan-favorite star Will Smith, huge characters like Harley Quinn and the Joker, and great marketing, Suicide Squad thrived at the box office.





 3  Wonder Woman Made $817.6 Million Internationally 
Wonder Woman Was The DC Hero&#39;s First Solo Movie In Theaters


 







  Wonder Woman  


  Release Date    June 2, 2017     Director    Patty Jenkins     Cast    Elena Anaya , Robin Wright , Lisa Loven Kongsli , Connie Nielsen , Lucy Davis , Gal Gadot , Danny Huston , Chris Pine , David Thewlis , Mayling Ng    


Gal Gadot&#39;s first solo movie as Wonder Woman was a success. Wonder Woman is the first movie in the DCEU&#39;s chronological order, doing a great job of delivering an exhilarating backstory for Diana. While Batman and Superman had several movies over the years, 2017&#39;s Wonder Woman was the first theatrical solo film for the other member of DC Comics&#39; Trinity, filling a void that had existed for a long time.





 2  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Made $872.3 Million Internationally 
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice Fell Short Of Expectations


 







  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice  


  Release Date    March 24, 2016     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot    


Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ended up becoming the most controversial DCEU movie. The film was expected to achieve over $1 billion, as it was the first to finally unite Batman and Superman — DC&#39;s two most popular heroes — on the big screen. However, after a front-loaded global opening weekend of $424 million, the film would lose steam due to mixed reviews and poor word-of-mouth.





 1  Aquaman Made $1.1 Billion Internationally 
Aquaman Made Great Use Of Its Christmas Release


 







  Aquaman  


  Release Date    July 6, 2018     Director    James Wan     Cast    Willem Dafoe , Patrick Wilson , Randall Park , Ludi Lin , Dolph Lundgren , Michael Beach , Amber Heard , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Jason Momoa , Temuera Morrison    


Finally, 2018&#39;s Aquaman surpassed expectations. With little competition over its lengthy Christmas window, Aquaman would become not only the DCEU&#39;s highest-grossing movie — the only one to break the $1 billion barrier — but also top all DC films at the box office. With great special effects, a charismatic lead, a unique setting, and more, Aquaman deserves to be the DCEU box office leader.
