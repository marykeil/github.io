## Literature Review

M3GAN 2 not only has the pressure of living up to the first film but also to end a very disappointing and disastrous horror movie streak.




Following the success of the first film, M3GAN 2.0 has been highly anticipated but has a lot more pressure to succeed following a disastrous horror movie streak. It has been confirmed that a sequel to the very popular horror film, M3GAN, is in development and will hit theaters on January 17, 2025. Akela Cooper is set to return to write the sequel, though director and cast details have not been made public as of yet. The far-out release date gives the production company plenty of time to generate a follow-up film that feels satisfactory to viewers, while also building anticipation for audiences.




Sequels to highly successful movies are always tricky, as they need to meet the expectations audiences have. Sequels can often serve to actually diminish the legacy of the first film, which adds an element of extra pressure to their creators to generate something that feels authentic and memorable. Not only do the producers of M3GAN need to make sure that their sequel lives up to the first film, but they also have the pressure of trying to end a disastrous horror movie strike.

                  Where to Watch M3GAN (&amp; How To Watch The Unrated Version)   The title character in M3GAN is on track to become one of the most beloved horror villains of all time, especially with the film now streaming online.   


 Blumhouse&#39;s Poor Rotten Tomatoes Run Shows Why It Needs M3GAN 2.0 
          

Blumhouse, the studio that created M3GAN, has not seen much success in terms of audience and critic response to their most recent projects. For example, their film Night Swim only received a 27% critic score and 44% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing. This is after multiple other disappointing scores for the production company. These include Five Nights at Freddy with a 32% critic score, The Exorcist: Believer with a 22% critic score, and Insidious: The Red Door with a 37% critic score.




On the other hand, M3GAN has a 93% critical approval rating. This is indicative of the fact that critics and audiences have enjoyed Blumhouse projects in the past, their latest films have just missed the mark. In order to re-establish its place in the film industry, Blumhouse is in need of creating a satisfying sequel to M3GAN that serves as a reminder of what it is capable of.



 M3GAN 2 Faces Challenges In Being As Good As The First Movie 
          

Though M3GAN 2 is a good idea, there are a number of challenges attached to it. Part of what made the original film so successful was how much fun audiences were having discovering it organically and creating M3GAN memes. The virality attached to the first film will be hard to recreate but can be doable. If Blumhouse focuses on the elements that worked with the original film, while still creating a unique storyline that draws audiences in, it is possible that M3GAN 2 can recreate its predecessor&#39;s success and end Blumhouse&#39;s rotten streak.
