## Literature Review

Dune and Wonka Midjourney mash-up art (including Arakeen Oompa-Loompas and an Atreides Hugh Grant ) makes for a truly mind-boggling combo.




Dune and Wonka mash-up art (including Arakeen Oompa-Loompas) makes for a truly mind-boggling combo. With over $500 million grossed worldwide, Timothée Chalamet’s starring turn as moviedom’s most famous eccentric chocolatier just crossed an important box office milestone. Next up for the star is another highly-anticipated big-budget movie in Dune: Part Two, the second half of Denis Villeneuve’s epic based on the classic science fiction novel by Frank Herbert.




Dune: Part Two and Wonka may indeed seem like a very unusual one-two punch for Chalamet, but the worlds originally envisioned by Herbert and Roald Dahl may actually be closer than suspected, as displayed in new Midjourney-created mash-up art. Check out the mind-boggling images below (via Reddit/u/TraditionFront):


 

The highlight among the images may be the Aarakeen Ooompa-Loompas, who are far more ferocious than previous iterations of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory characters. Not only are there some intriguing character re-designs, there are also vehicle make-overs, including a new take on the ornithopter. Intriguingly, Wonka and Dune getting mashed-up seems to land on steampunk.


 Dune 3 Might Have A Better Chance Of Happening Than Wonka 2 
          




Even given the first film’s $500-million-plus worldwide box office performance, chances of Wonka 2 happening seem up in the air. When asked recently to address the possibility of returning as Willy Wonka, Chalamet himself gave a somewhat cryptic response, telling ET Online a sequel could happen &#34;If there was a story to be told. And evidently there is.&#34; But he added, “Something twisted happens ... I don&#39;t know how we started like this and end there -- I don&#39;t know what the story is.&#34;



Wonka director Paul King has teased a sequel based on original author Dahl&#39;s unreleased work.




There is definitely a story to be told in Dune 3, and director Villeneuve recently teased that story, while confirming he is working on an adaptation of Herbert’s own Dune follow-up, Dune Messiah. Villeneuve told Cine 21:



“I&#39;m working on four different screenplays -- I know that Dune Messiah will be one of them, I don&#39;t know if it will be the next or the second next. My job was to try to keep the spirit of Frank Herbert alive as much as possible -- the whole meaning of Dune becomes clear with Dune Messiah.&#34;






Even if Villeneuve does get the greenlight on Dune: Part Three, it would likely be many years before the film made it to screens. Everything depends on the box office for Dune: Part Two, which could exceed the performance of Villeneuve&#39;s first Dune, but still not be enough to get the third film greenlit. Wonka, on the other hand, did perform reasonably well at the box office, opening up the possibility of Wonka 2, but the sequel is not confirmed and is far from a certain proposition.
