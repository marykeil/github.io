## Literature Review

Monarch: Legacy of Monsters co-creators Matt Fraction and Chris Black share their rapturous reviews to the new movie Godzilla Minus One.




Godzilla Minus One has received rave reviews from the creators of the new Monsterverse show, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters. Although the new movie premiered at the same time Monarch was airing on Apple TV&#43;, the two titles are unrelated save for the inclusion of the iconic kaiju as a character. Minus One is a Japanese-language outing from Toho that takes place in a post-World War II Japan which is undergoing its first Godzilla attack, whereas Monarch is set in the English-language Monsterverse, in continuity with other installments including the movies Godzilla (2014) and Godzilla: King of the Monsters.




ComicBook.com recently had the chance to speak with Monarch co-creators Matt Fraction and Chris Black in the wake of the Godzilla Minus One American release. Fraction had a rhapsodic reaction to the movie, saying that it was a &#34;compelling, fascinating, involving, heartbreaking, thrilling story to watch, even without Godzilla.&#34; Black seconded his statement and added that the movie and their show &#34;tell the story in very different ways but I think they do it equally successfully. There&#39;s a Godzilla for everyone!&#34; Read their full quotes below:


Matt Fraction: I loved it and having worked with Toho and heard how they viewed their characters, I think it was such a human story told in a way that was unique to the Japanese character. It was a story that could only be told by Toho using their own materials. I&#39;m thrilled that it exists because it gets at all of the things that they would talk about in a very real way. It&#39;s an incredible story of survivor&#39;s guilt, courage, common cause, duty, dignity, and redemption. It&#39;s beautiful, it&#39;s fantastic, and the effects are incredible! It is a compelling, fascinating, involving, heartbreaking, thrilling story to watch, even without Godzilla.
Chris Black: I can only endorse and second what Matt is saying. It&#39;s been a big year for the Monsterverse and Godzilla Minus One shows how effective this story can be told. You have this movie, our show, you have the Legendary universe, and they&#39;re all very different. They tell the story in very different ways but I think they do it equally successfully. There&#39;s a Godzilla for everyone! It&#39;s a testament to why the character has endured for over seventy years.






 There Really Is a Godzilla for Everyone 
          

As Black says, the simultaneous success of the Godzilla Minus One box office and Monarch&#39;s streaming release shows that Godzilla can take many successful forms. In fact, the Godzillas featured in both projects feel almost diametrically opposed. While Minus One, much like the previous Japanese live-action outing Shin Godzilla, largely depicts the creature as a nightmarish threat, Monarch explores the ways that humanity and monsters coexist, though not altogether peacefully.

                  Is Godzilla Minus One A Prequel To Shin Godzilla?   Godzilla Minus One and Shin Godzilla are both recent, successful Japanese movies, but is Godzilla Minus One a prequel to Shin Godzilla??    

The fact that both properties are nonetheless successful is a microcosm of the overarching tenor of the franchise, revealing the adaptability that Godzilla has shown since the original movie debuted in 1954. This has been the case throughout the Japanese run of the franchise, on top of its differences from the American run. Over time, the Japanese version has alternately been depicted as a monstrous threat, a goofy matinee hero, and a tragic figure.






There are 33 Godzilla movies from Japan and 5 from America, for a total of 38 over 70 years.




The Godzilla Minus One ending implies that there could be further entries in that particular timeline. Plus, even if Monarch doesn&#39;t get renewed for season 2, the Monsterverse will still continue, as they already have the blockbuster sequel Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire set to hit theaters later this year. As both franchises potentially grow alongside one another, they will likely continue to prove that variability has been the key to the franchise&#39;s success.
