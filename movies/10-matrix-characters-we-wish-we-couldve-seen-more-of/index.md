## Literature Review

The Matrix franchise has introduced all kinds of beloved characters to the world, and we really wish that we could have spent more time with these 10.




The Matrix franchise is full of iconic characters like Neo, Trinity, Agent Smith, and Morpheus, but we wish we could&#39;ve seen a lot more of these 10 minor The Matrix characters. The vast world of The Matrix is absolutely massive, with the franchise&#39;s five movies populating the universe with all kinds of immensely interesting characters. However, due to the limited runtime of The Matrix series, many of these interesting characters only have a few minutes of screentime. So, here are 10 The Matrix characters that seriously deserved a lot more development, with them potentially being able to carry their own spinoffs and side projects.
The Matrix is one of the most famous sci-fi franchises of all time, with it redefining what a sci-fi movie could be while also reinvigorating that anime-inspired martial arts genre. The original The Matrix trilogy is still immensely popular today, but those three films weren&#39;t the end of the franchise. An animated anthology spinoff movie titled The Animatrix as well as the revival film The Matrix Resurrections both continued the franchise in big ways, introducing even more stories and characters to the world. Future films could potentially expand on some characters, including these 10.
            
 
 Everything We Know About The Matrix 5 
The Matrix Resurrections ends on a somewhat ambiguous note, so does The Matrix 5 lie in Warner Bros&#39; future? Here are all the details we know so far.












 








 10  Cypher 


 







Cypher is one of the most interesting characters in The Matrix franchise, with him being one of the few human villains. His arc is one of the main thematic cores of the first film, which is what makes him such an interesting antagonist. While Cypher&#39;s betrayal of Morpheus is one of the most interesting parts of the first film, Cypher&#39;s death at the end of the original movie means that he doesn&#39;t appear at all in the sequels. While it makes sense for Cypher to die here, it would have been great to spend more time with this fantastic villain.





 9  Tank 
        

Tank is one of the youngest members of the Nebuchadnezzar&#39;s crew, and he is easily one of the most interesting. While Tank may not have as big of an influence on the first film as some of his companions, the character is a lot of fun. Sadly, Tank was killed offscreen between The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded, with a lot of mystery surrounding the character&#39;s fate. A story exploring Tank&#39;s life after the events of the first The Matrix movie would be a great way to flesh out the character and give him more of a spotlight, as he is sorely missed in the rest of the trilogy.





 8  The Merovingian 
        

Another interesting minor antagonist in The Matrix franchise is the Merovingian, with the dashing Frenchman being one of the threats that Neo has to face in The Matrix Reloaded. The Merovingian is an organized crime boss and an information tracker that stands in the way of Neo&#39;s quest in the second film. Despite him being a villain, it is impossible not to love the Merovingian, and many fans wish that he had a greater role in the series. Although the Merovingian does have a cameo role in The Matrix Resurrections, it would have been great to see even more of him in the sequels.





 7  The Twins 
        

Two of the Merovingian&#39;s most prominent underlings are the Twins, with these ghoulish goons using guns and their phasing abilities to hunt down the Keymaker. The design of the Twins and their role in The Matrix Reloaded&#39;s freeway chase make them some of the most visually distinct parts of the trilogy. However, the Twins are just simple goons, meaning that they don&#39;t have much of a story. It would have been nice for the Twins to get a bigger role in The Matrix trilogy, allowing them to be fleshed out as much as some of the other villains.





 6  Niobe 
        

First appearing in The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe is a resistance fighter who has a brief fling with Morpheus. While she is interesting enough in this film, her role does evolve a lot in The Matrix Resurrections, where she becomes Captain Niobe. In the years since Neo&#39;s death, Niobe became the leader of IO. The legacy sequel only vaguely hints at Niobe&#39;s story during The Matrix Resurrections&#39;s 60-year gap, and it would have been nice to hear about what Niobe and the resistance were up to while awaiting Neo&#39;s return.





 5  The Keymaker 
        

The Keymaker is a key character in The Matrix Reloaded, with much of the film&#39;s story revolving around Neo and the Merovingian&#39;s chase to find him. The Keymaker is a program that was created in order to open up the door to the Source for Neo, and while this makes him one of the franchise&#39;s most important programs, he doesn&#39;t actually get a lot of screentime. Compared to characters like the Oracle, the Keymaker doesn&#39;t get a lot of development, so it would have been nice to see some more of him.





 4  Seraph 
        

Seraph is easily one of the coolest characters to be introduced outside of the original The Matrix, with the exiled program going from being one of the Merovingian&#39;s goons to being the Oracle&#39;s bodyguard. Seraph is an excellent fighter and has an incredible ability to navigate the Matrix, making him one of the strongest characters in The Matrix franchise and deserving of some more screentime.





 3  The Morpheus Program 


 







Morpheus is one of the main characters of the original The Matrix trilogy, but a slightly different version of him appears in The Matrix Resurrections. The Morpheus Program is a digitized version of Morpheus that was created after Morpheus&#39; death, although not much is known about this version of the character. Morpheus&#39; programmed origins seemed like a hastily put-together way to reintroduce the character, but his existence has a lot of implications on the lore that aren&#39;t fully explored.





 2  Bugs 
        

Bugs is one of the main characters in The Matrix Resurrections as well as the driving force behind bringing Neo back, and she deserved a lot more than one film. If The Matrix Resurrections had successfully led to more sequels, its seems like Bugs would have played a much bigger role in the franchise. However, this sadly didn&#39;t happen, with her story going unfinished by the end of The Matrix Resurrections.





 1  Spoon Boy 
        

When visiting the Oracle in the original The Matrix, Neo has a brief conversation with a young boy who has the ability to bend a spoon. Spoon Boy, as he has come to be known, delivers one of the most iconic lines in the entirety of The Matrix franchise, and he is never expanded on any further. This character obviously had a big future in store due to the Oracle watching over him, yet The Matrix franchise fails to continue his story, which is one of the biggest crimes of the series.
        


  The Matrix Resurrections  
Set sixty years after The Matrix Revolutions, The Matrix Resurrections is a sci-fi action movie that sees the return of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne moss nearly twenty years after the release of the previous film. Neo has become a game developer who struggles to grasp reality, and his concerns are validated when a new visage of Morpheus arrives to free him from his prison - a newly created Matrix. Learning that Trinity is alive and being held prisoner, Neo will join a new rebel force to save her and confront a new, dangerous foe known as the Analyst.
