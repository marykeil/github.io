# 2023 Sci-Fi Disappointment Is Finding New Life On Streaming, Popularity Chart Reveals


## SUMMARY 



  New data reveals The Creator was the 10th most popular title on streaming for the week of December 28 â€“ January 3.   The Creator is directed by Gareth Edwards and stars John David Washington as an ex-soldier who protects a powerful robot child during a conflict between AI and humans.

## Literature Review

A new popularity chart reveals that one 2023 science-fiction movie has found new success on streaming after disappointing at the box office.




The Creator has found new success on streaming after disappointing in theaters, new data reveals. John David Washington leads The Creator&#39;s cast as Joshua, an ex-soldier who finds himself tasked with protecting a messianic robot child as a war rages between humans and AI. The film, which is directed by Gareth Edwards, earned mostly positive reviews, but ended up underwhelming at the box office.




Now, following The Creator&#39;s streaming release on Hulu on December 20, new popularity data shared by Realgood reveals that the film has nabbed a spot in the top 10 streaming titles for the week of December 28 to January 3. The sci-fi action flick occupies the number 10 spot and is preceded by titles like Berlin, Barbie, and Slow Horses. Check out the full Realgood chart below:

          

  


 The Creator&#39;s Poor Theatrical Performance Explained 
          




Hitting theaters at the end of September 2023, The Creator ended up earning $104.3 million worldwide on an estimated budget of $80 million. While not a universal hit with critics (the film currently sports a 66% score on Rotten Tomatoes with an audience score of 76%), the reviews did skew positive, with particular praise levied at the movie&#39;s spectacular visuals.



Despite being made on a fraction of the budget, The Creator is widely considered to feature better visuals than a host of other recent blockbusters, and Edwards&#39; history as a VFX artist likely played a big role in this.




Despite this generally positive reception, however, The Creator&#39;s box office performance continues a disappointing trend. The film is a rarity in the modern entertainment landscape as it is an original story idea not based on pre-existing IP. The value of IP, of course, is that audiences&#39; familiarity with a story, world, or set of characters makes the movie easier to sell. While many original movies have become hits in recent years, The Creator&#39;s performance is more proof that convincing audiences to take a chance on an original idea is more challenging than it used to be.




Another factor working against The Creator is that it doesn&#39;t have a big movie star at the center of it. Although Washington is certainly a known quantity, he clearly doesn&#39;t yet have the power to open a non-IP movie. Considering The Creator&#39;s ambition and just how impressive it managed to look on a relatively modest budget, it&#39;s a shame that it underperformed, as its box office may deter similar original projects from getting made in the future. The latest data, however, suggests that it may now finally be finding a wider audience.
