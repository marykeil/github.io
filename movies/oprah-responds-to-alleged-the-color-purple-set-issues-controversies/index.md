## Literature Review

Producer Oprah Winfrey responds to the recent controversy surrounding The Color Purple&#39;s on-set experience after recent claims from Taraji P. Henson. 




Oprah Winfrey responds to the recent controversies regarding the working conditions on the set of The Color Purple. Winfrey, who starred in the 1985 version of the film, serves as one of the producers for the new musical remake. The Color Purple has received positive reviews and decent success at the box office since its release on Christmas Day 2023.




Speaking with Entertainment Tonight, Winfrey responds to the recent controversies surrounding the on-set experience on The Color Purple. Regarding the claim that the producer “was not supporting Taraji [P. Henson],” Winfrey clarified that she did support the actor and was “the greatest champion of this film.” Check out the full quote from Winfrey below:


“People are saying that I was not supporting Taraji. Taraji will tell you herself that I’ve been the greatest champion of this film. Championing not only the behind the scenes projection but also everything that everybody needed. So whenever I heard that there was something that someone needed … I’m not in charge of the budget because that’s Warner Bros. That’s the way the studio system works.
“We as producers, everybody gets their salary and everybody is negotiated by your team. And so, whenever I heard there was an issue or there was a problem, there was a problem with cars or the problem with their food, I would step in and do whatever I could to make it right. And I believe that [Taraji] would even vouch for that and say that is true.”

Winfrey’s response comes after recent claims from Henson regarding her negative experience on set. According to Henson, cast members on The Color Purple were not given food on set or trailers during rehearsals. Furthermore, the actor claims that she had to fight to get the cast transportation to set, as the actors were originally given rental cars and expected to drive themselves.

                  The Color Purple 2023 Ending Explained   The Color Purple gets the musical treatment in its second film adaptation. The film&#39;s ending has a few revelations and we break down the biggest ones.   

Henson’s complaints about The Color Purple&#39;s set did not stop there. She also claimed that she had to fight for fair pay in the early stages of The Color Purple’s production on top of trying to secure the aforementioned amenities for her co-stars. In her complaints, Henson pointed out the injustices that often populate Black films in Hollywood, which to her seemed apparent here.




Henson claimed to have contacted Winfrey in order to get the food and trailers issue corrected, which led to speculation online that Winfrey was not supporting the cast during the process. While Winfrey’s most recent statement implies that this is not true, it is notable that it was an actor who had to speak up rather than a producer. Hopefully, Winfrey is being honest in her stated support of The Color Purple team, as the set conditions sound unjust.
