Jake Johnson is making his directorial debut with the wild dark comedy, Self Reliance. Also written by and starring the New Girl alum, the movie revolves around a man down on his luck who is offered the ability to star in a dark web competition show in which he will be hunted for 30 days, and if he survives, he will win $1 million at the end. In order to avoid being a target, he has to remain in the presence of another person, as the rules stipulate he can only be killed while alone.




Alongside Johnson, the ensemble Self Reliance cast includes Anna Kendrick, Natalie Morales, Mary Holland, Emily Hampshire, Nancy Lenehan, Daryl J. Johnson, Miriam Flynn, Biff Wiff, Eduardo Franco, Christopher Lloyd and Andy Samberg as himself. Combining much of the humor Johnson has become known for throughout his career with a unique paranoid thriller plot and themes of connection, the movie is an intriguing and wildly entertaining debut for the star.

 Jake Johnson &amp; Biff Wiff Talk Self Reliance 
          




Screen Rant: Jake, I&#39;d love to start with you. First congrats on this movie, it is fantastic, it is so wild from start to finish. I know you&#39;ve written plenty of movies before, but given that this is your directorial debut, what was it like finding that right balance of tone between the comedy of the story and the sort of paranoid thriller of it?


Jake Johnson: The original pitch was like a comedic Jacob&#39;s Ladder, which I know sounds goofy, but I kind of felt like the big part of the tone was the cast. So, Mary Holland, for example, who&#39;s the eldest sister, I&#39;d worked with her a lot, I knew I needed her. When Biff Wiff became James — he was the first person I cast — I knew we were in really good shape. So, I needed a few people who I knew knew the tone in their bones. And then, everybody else would just kind of follow suit. And that&#39;s not to say other people also didn&#39;t know it in their bones, but I needed some, like I needed Mary to be able to be really mean to me, but still be funny.
Because if that actor was really mean to Tommy, and making him seem delusional, and the audience didn&#39;t find her funny, then you&#39;re just on her team. And if Biff isn&#39;t a charming guy, then Tommy&#39;s a super weird guy for hanging out with him all the time. So, for me, I&#39;m more of an actor, obviously, than a director and acting is more of my love. And I love actors, I love a good actor, so I think tone is really about the right people and letting them do their thing.





Well, you found a really great bunch, and Biff, I&#39;d like to come to you next. When Jake first approached you with this project, and this idea, what were some of the thoughts going through your head about the movie and your character?


Biff Wiff: &#34;I&#39;m going to get a job. I&#39;m going to be working. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to be doing, but I&#39;m going to be working!&#34; [Laughs] I was real happy, and I&#39;ve watched Jake from New Girl a long time. I even worked on New Girl, we never worked together, but I was just like, after all these years — I tell everybody, &#34;It only took me 42 years to become an overnight success.&#34;


          

Well, I love that Jake&#39;s continuing that ball rolling for you. What was it like developing a rapport with one another for this movie?





Biff Wiff: It couldn&#39;t have been better, I&#39;d say that we&#39;ve become fairly decent friends. He&#39;s been always kind to me and gave me complete freedom. Not complete freedom, but a lot of freedom working, which I really appreciate. I like doing what I like to do rather than what somebody is telling me to do, and he let me have that kind of freedom, so our friendship has grown out of that. Basically, we can say anything to each other, and it&#39;s a pleasure knowing him.



Jake Johnson: I love Biff, I also felt in directing this, truthfully, a lot of times like I was underwater, and it was a little overwhelming. There was a lot of the stuff about directing that, even though I&#39;ve been on a lot of sets and studied a lot of directors, it&#39;s a skill, it&#39;s a muscle that I didn&#39;t feel like I really had. So, when an actor could come in and crush the first take — like Eduardo Franco, for example, who plays the Ninja, his first scene where he wakes Tommy up. He and I joke about it now, because we&#39;ve become buddies too, and he would say beforehand, &#34;What is the tone of this?&#34; And I&#39;m like, &#34;Dude, we got to do it once. I think I know what it is, but I don&#39;t know what it is with you here.&#34;
So, when you talk about the moms, the way Nancy is with the family — she&#39;s my mom — and Miriam with the Anna Kendrick scene where she&#39;s putting us in bed, that whole tone when she&#39;s walking out, which crushes, gets huge laughs, that was really her take. So I, as a director, didn&#39;t micromanage, and I didn&#39;t say, like, &#34;Do it this way.&#34; I really wanted everybody to do their version, and it&#39;s a credit to great actors. Certain scenes, people are just crushing it, like Emily Hampshire, Daryl Johnson, the family, they&#39;re all just bringing it. I didn&#39;t micromanage any of them. I said, &#34;How would you react in this situation? If you want to improvise a little bit, do it. If something feels right, say it.&#34;






Biff Wiff: Yeah. I remember there was one point in the dinner scene where I was having a little bit of trouble with by lines, and I said, &#34;Well, I&#39;m going to read these, because I wasn&#39;t on camera.&#34; And Jake just took the script out of my hand, threw it on the floor and says, &#34;No, I want real reactions, and you don&#39;t worry about the script.&#34; It just was an eye-opener to me to where I just said, &#34;Oh, okay, I get where we&#39;re going with this now.&#34; It was a boon.



Jake Johnson: Yeah, what I love about acting, and what I love about being on set is not nailing exactly what somebody else&#39;s vision is. But now that we&#39;re all here together, including the crew, there&#39;s some magic right now, and so if Biff was having a moment where he was worried about his lines, then he&#39;s not in the moment.
