## Literature Review

From Dracula to Frankenstein to the Invisible Man, Universal&#39;s iconic monster movies are massively influential on horror. Here&#39;s how they rank.




With several monster films in development, it&#39;s a fantastic time to revisit the classic Universal Monsters films, though they drastically range in quality. From the 1930s to the 1950s, Universal Pictures developed thirty monster films, starting with Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and The Invisible Man. These classic movies became cultural landmarks that are still considered some of the best in their genre, mixing gothic horror with campy fun. By no means are they scary by modern standards, but the monster films are a joy to revisit.
There are several tangentially related monster movies, such as Edgar Allan Poe adaptations like The Raven or The Black Cat, but the official thirty belong to the Universal Classic Monsters Complete Collection, released in 2018. The collection contains films primarily related to the original &#39;30s monsters and numerous sequel films. There are also comedic horror crossovers like Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.
            
 
 8 Universal Monsters Movies We Still Need To Happen (Despite Renfield&#39;s Failure) 
Renfield&#39;s Dracula retelling flopping at the box office doesn&#39;t mean The Wolfman, The Mummy, and the rest of the Universal Monsters don&#39;t need movies.












 








 30  The Mummy&#39;s Tomb (1942) 
Directed by Harold Young
        

Long before the Brendan Fraser and Tom Cruise versions of The Mummy, the Universal Monster franchise was developing various sequels for the title. Unfortunately, very few of the classic sequels lived up to the first movies in their saga. The Mummy&#39;s Tomb suffers from offering nothing new after the original. It&#39;s incredibly slow-paced with nothing exciting to give to the franchise, resulting in one of the worst Mummy movies.





 29  The Creature Walks Among Us (1956) 
Directed by John Sherwood
        

After Creature from the Black Lagoon marked the first successful new title in the Monster franchise in decades, it was followed up by two abysmal sequels. The Creature Walks Among Us is the third film in the Gill-man trilogy and the final film in the Universal Monsters series, and unfortunately, it ends both on a low note. The last installment attempts to balance its campy monster action with philosophical commentary on human nature, and it doesn&#39;t pan out.





 28  The Mummy&#39;s Curse (1944) 
Directed by Leslie Goodwins
        

The final film of The Mummy saga ends it all on a low note, with an almost identical premise to the previous sequels, though this time in a Louisiana swamp setting. The events of the film are meant to take place in a futuristic period, though, like many narrative elements in The Mummy&#39;s Curse, the date and setting are tediously arbitrary. The best part of The Mummy&#39;s Curse is the involvement of Ananka, the female Mummy.





 27  She-Wolf Of London (1946) 
Directed by Jean Yarbrough
        

She-Wolf of London is one of the campiest and weakest films in the Universal Monsters franchise. Despite the title alluding to being related to The Wolf Man or Werewolf of London, the 1946 film doesn&#39;t actually have a werewolf in it. Instead, a woman spends the film under suspicion that she is a werewolf, but it just never happens. She-Wolf of London is one of the lesser-known films in the franchise for a reason, as it&#39;s hardly a horror movie.

 26  The Mummy&#39;s Ghost (1944) 
Directed by Reginald Le Borg
        

Two Mummy sequels were released in 1944, and unfortunately, neither is very strong. The Mummy&#39;s Ghost suffers from repetitive narrative ideas from previous films, as a mummy seeks to bring a lost lover back to life. The Mummy&#39;s Ghost isn&#39;t as fun as the original, notably lacking in its stale human characters. The saving grace of the sequel is its twist ending, which distinguishes it from the more predictable films in the series.





 25  The Invisible Man&#39;s Revenge (1944) 
Directed by Ford Beebe
        

The Invisible Man saga has seen various interpretations through the years, including some terribly corny &#39;90s comedies. As for the Universal Monsters franchise, the 1944 sequel is the worst of The Invisible Man movies. The Invisible Man&#39;s Revenge tries to incorporate themes about morality, as a fugitive is given the power of invisibility to evade the law. Like The Mummy saga, The Invisible Man sequels run out of gimmicks to play with.





 24  Revenge Of The Creature (1955) 
Directed by Jack Arnold
        

The second film in the Gill-man saga is Revenge of the Creature, and the installment offers nothing original, mainly retreading the camp of the first. A brief pre-fame Clint Eastwood appearance adds a bit of retrospective levity to Revenge of the Creature. The film is mildly entertaining for those who seek more of the creature, but it&#39;s a sad step down from the inventive excitement of the first.





 23  The Invisible Woman (1940) 
Directed by A. Edward Sutherland
        

The Invisible Woman embraces the Universal Monsters&#39; comedic elements, centered around a model seeking revenge on her previous employer after an experiment turns her invisible. Like many monster sequels, The Invisible Woman suffers from a dull script, relying on its quips and screw-ball humor instead of a story. Still, the shift in tone to comedy is effective, and the special effects are extremely impressive for 1940.





 22  House Of Dracula (1945) 
Directed by Erle C. Kenton


 







House of Dracula is the worst among the franchise&#39;s big crossover films, but it&#39;s still a fun mashup of monster films with Dracula, Wolf Man, and a brief appearance from Frankenstein&#39;s monster. Lon Chaney Jr., as the Wolf Man, is the only star who reprises his role from the original films in each saga, with John Carradine reprising his role as Count Dracula instead of Bela Lugosi. Both Dracula and Wolf Man seek out cures for their afflictions, making for a decently engaging narrative to compliment the excellent visual work.





 21  Son Of Dracula (1943) 
Directed by Robert Siodmak
        

Wolf Man actor Lon Chaney Jr. brings Count Dracula to life in the 1943 sequel, Son of Dracula. The title creates a misconception as the film has nothing to do with Dracula having a son, but rather Dracula arriving in the United States, where he takes a new bride. The Southern Gothic setting adds to the film, which has some of the more alluring visual and narrative elements among Universal&#39;s monster films.

Dracula is undoubtedly the quintessential horror monster across all media. Here are the biggest names who have played the vampire in films and TV.








 20  The Mummy&#39;s Hand (1940) 
Directed by Christy Cabanne
        

The best classic Mummy sequel is The Mummy&#39;s Hand, which leans more into comedic elements than its predecessor. Some of the film&#39;s comedy has aged awfully, and that comedy overshadows the horror element in this installment. Despite those flaws, The Mummy&#39;s Hand has more likable characters than future Mummy films, and it outclasses the original in entertainment value, if not narratively.





 19  Invisible Agent (1942) 
Directed by Edwin L. Marin
        

Invisible Agent is one of the stranger Universal Monster movies, fitting aptly with its wartime release. The sequel sees the grandson of the original Invisible Man utilize the scientific formula to become invisible and aid the Allies in war. The new Invisible Man goes to spy on Nazi Germany, turning the film into a comedic espionage thriller. It&#39;s a strange mix with genuine campy potential, but it&#39;s such a departure from the franchise that it&#39;s barely a monster movie.





 18  The Ghost Of Frankenstein (1942) 
Directed by Erle C. Kenton
        

Lon Chaney Jr. completes the trinity of monsters after playing the monster in The Ghost of Frankenstein, and Dracula actor Bela Lugosi also stars as Igor. Following up the classic Frankenstein films, the 1942 makes for a ridiculously campy sequel that&#39;s easily the worst in its series. Aside from Chaney and Lugosi&#39;s performances, The Ghost of Frankenstein is typical B-movie entertainment.





 17  Abbott And Costello Meet The Mummy (1955) 
Directed by Charles Lamont
        

The last of the Abbott and Costello monster movies made for another disappointing sequel, having them finally meet the Mummy. The film has some decent gags, with Costello in particular doing some of his best work, but like many of the Mummy sequels, that aspect falls flat and feels repetitive. Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy is worth the watch for fans of the comedic duo, but the monster aspect is lacking, particularly without Boris Karloff to play the titular villain.





 16  House Of Frankenstein (1944) 
Directed by Erle C. Kenton
        

In terms of a complete crossover film, House of Frankenstein is a fantastic addition to the monster universe. John Carradine takes over as Count Dracula, Lon Chaney is back as the Wolf Man, Frankenstein&#39;s monster is there, and Boris Karloff is excellent as an evil scientist. The film doesn&#39;t have much of a plot, but it&#39;s a wildly entertaining monster mix-up with some of the best performers in Universal&#39;s series.





 15  Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man (1943) 
Directed by Roy William Neill
        

Directly following up on The Wolf Man and The Ghost of Frankenstein, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man integrates the best aspects of both franchises for a fun crossover. Lon Chaney is back as the Wolf Man while Bela Lugosi plays Frankenstein&#39;s monster. As the first monster crossover, the performances are the most entertaining part, though the final clash between the two is unfortunately anti-climactic.
            
 
 Every Shared Horror Movie Universe (&amp; What Happened To Them) 
Horror is no stranger to the shared cinematic universe. Here&#39;s a list of all the monsters and killers to cross over into each other&#39;s worlds.








 14  Abbott And Costello Meet The Invisible Man (1951) 
Directed by Charles Lamont
        

Mixing Abbott and Costello with the inherently silly Invisible Man seems like a perfect match, and the combination doesn&#39;t disappoint. The film again features a new character injected with the invisibility formula, this time a boxer looking to get away with murder. Of course, Abbott and Costello are the private investigators on his trail, who bumble their way to solving the case. Again, it&#39;s much more of a comedy than a monster film, though in this case, the Invisible Man is a perfect foil for the duo.





 13  The Invisible Man Returns (1940) 
Directed by Joe May
        

The first sequel in its series, The Invisible Man Returns is heightened by legendary actor Vincent Price. He plays the brother of the original Invisible Man, and he&#39;s wrongfully accused of a crime. In order to buy himself time, he utilizes the invisibility formula to buy himself time and catch the true culprit. Price is the standout, offering the Invisible Man a perfectly entertaining new voice.





 12  Werewolf Of London (1935) 
Directed by Stuart Walker
        

Before Lon Chaney took over the role of the Wolf Man, Werewolf of London was Universal&#39;s first stab at lycanthropy. The film lacks star power compared to the other &#39;30s monster classics, with the lead performers giving tame performances compared to the following werewolf movies. Werewolf of London is an interesting rough draft, seeing as it was the first werewolf film, but it&#39;s not on the level of The Wolfman.





 11  Son Of Frankenstein (1939) 
Directed by Rowland V. Lee
        

After Bride of Frankenstein, Universal expands the family with Son of Frankenstein, with Rowland V. Lee taking over as the new director. Bela Lugosi plays Ygor for the first time, and Boris Karloff returns as the monster, delivering more fantastic performances for the franchise. It&#39;s slower and less entertaining than the previous Frankenstein films, but the 1939 classic offers some of the inspiration for Young Frankenstein.
