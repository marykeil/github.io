 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.












 








 10  The Book Of Boba Fett&#39;s Wooden Set Is Revealed 
Season 1, Episode 3 &#34;Chapter 3: The Streets of Mos Espa&#34;
        

During the now-notorious The Book of Boba Fett episode 3, viewers watching the ending sequence can actually spot a set mistake. The wood hidden behind the building facades for Mos Espa can be seen through the corner of a building during a shot from above. This reveals what the sets actually look like behind their facades, and makes the viewers appreciate the hard work set designers put into making the Star Wars galaxy feel alive, even if a mistake like this shows up due to an odd angle.





 9  The Ghost Of Luke Skywalker In The Tatooine Homestead 
A New Hope
        

George Lucas infamously edited the &#39;official&#39; cuts of the original trilogy with his Star Wars &#34;Special Editions&#34;, and there&#39;s a glaring mistake in one scene that was added. During A New Hope&#39;s Tatooine sequences, a still shot of the Lars Homestead was added, featuring a clear, ghostly apparition on the right-side door. This appears to be a motion-blurred Luke Skywalker walking into the door, which was unfortunately the freeze-frame chosen for the new shot. As it stands, Luke Skywalker&#39;s &#34;ghost&#34; somehow appears much earlier than The Rise of Skywalker for sharp-eyed fans.





 8  Darth Vader&#39;s Neckpiece Appears Out Of Nowhere 
Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith
        

The creation and assembly of Darth Vader&#39;s specialized armor was one of the most anticipated and exciting parts of Revenge of the Sith, but hidden in the middle of the iconic sequence is a glaring continuity error. As the iconic mask begins to lower over Anakin&#39;s burnt face, his neck is totally exposed. The film then cuts to a point-of-view shot of the mask, and cuts back to a medium-close-up of Anakin&#39;s face. This time, his neck is covered by Vader&#39;s curved neck/chin guard, appearing out of nowhere.







 7  Din Djarin&#39;s Armor Is On Backwards 
The Mandalorian Season 2, Episode 1 &#34;Chapter 9: The Marshal&#34;
        

Costuming can also be a source of mistakes, like in this one from The Mandalorian season 2&#39;s explosive premiere. The episode deals a lot with Mandalorian armor, and ironically includes an armor mistake during the Tusken campfire scene. Din Djarin&#39;s iconic mudhorn signet can be seen behind his left shoulder, as opposed to on the front of his right shoulder. This means the two shoulder pauldrons are switched, and thus Din Djarin&#39;s armor is backwards for a time.

Din Djarin’s armor in The Mandalorian has gone through several subtle change, each of which represent a milestone in his journey with Grogu.








 6  Anakin And Obi-Wan Trade Lightsabers On Mustafar 
Star Wars - Episode III: Revenge Of The Sith
        

Near the beginning of Anakin and Obi-Wan&#39;s fateful duel on Mustafar, the two Jedi fight in a Separatist meeting room. During this sequence, Anakin and Obi-Wan switch lightsabers for a few brief shots. This is because there were originally more shots showing them dropping and then picking up each other&#39;s lightsabers, explaining this switch. But as the film exists today, those shots are not included, and this editing continuity error still makes an appearance.





 5  Finn&#39;s Teleporting Backpack In The Escape Pod 
Star Wars: The Last Jedi
        

The Last Jedi is well regarded for its cinematography and visuals, but even this film includes some continuity errors. One of which is while Finn is attempting to flee the Resistance to find Rey. He places his packed bag outside an escape pod, and is preparing to board it to desert when Rose finds him. He tries to excuse his presence as a routine check, but when Rose notices his bag, the film cuts to the image of the bag already inside the pod. Finn&#39;s bag cannot teleport, thus making this another example of an easy-to-miss continuity error.





 4  The Mandalorian&#39;s Jeans Guy Lurks In The Background 
Season 2, Episode 4 &#34;Chapter 12: The Siege&#34;
        

One of the most famous mistakes in modern Star Wars is the famous &#34;Jeans Guy.&#34; In The Mandalorian season 2, a crew member can be spotted in the background of Nevarro&#39;s Imperial facility, wearing a light t-shirt and jeans, hence the name. He became an instant sensation on social media, but Jeans Guy was quickly removed from the episode on Disney&#43;, so unfortunately, he can&#39;t be seen on the rewatch.





 3  The Fake Mace Windu With The Jedi Council On Naboo 
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace
        

Near the end of The Phantom Menace, a Jedi can be seen alongside the Jedi Council wearing the same unique robes as Mace Windu, and featuring the same shaved head. This is clearly not Samuel L. Jackson, though, but it appears this was intended to be a fill-in for him while this scene was shot outside the famous actor&#39;s availability schedule. Once this is seen, the &#34;fake&#34; stand-in Mace Windu cannot be unseen, arriving on Naboo with Palpatine alongside the rest of the Council he serves on.





 2  The Falling AT-AT Gets A Little Help 
The Empire Strikes Back
        

Even one of the most famous sequences in the history of Star Wars involves a gaff or two. The Empire Strikes Back&#39;s Battle of Hoth features a fun-to-spot pole poking at the foot of one of the AT-ATs in order to nudge it over into falling. The walker was just shot, and the model needed to be pushed over, so the artists at ILM put a hole in the ground they could stick a pole through to solve this problem. Now, this pole and the foot it raises can be seen in the film today.





 1  A Stormtrooper Hits Their Head On A Door 
A New Hope
        

The most famous mistake in all of Star Wars is almost undoubtedly the stormtrooper head bump. In the original movie, a tall extra wearing the now iconic stormtrooper armor bumps their head on a door. This was always noticed and called out by viewers, but it was made very official in George Lucas&#39;s &#34;Special Editions&#34;, when a &#34;bonk&#34; sound effect was added to the collision. This famous mistake now cemented one stormtrooper&#39;s head bump as a canon part of the Star Wars universe.
