## Literature Review
Although quality correlates with box office success most of the time, some beloved franchises have some unexpected movies occupying top spot.




Although big franchises often measure their success based on box office returns, the best movies aren&#39;t always the ones which make the most money. There are many factors which contribute to a movie&#39;s box office returns, and although the quality of the movie is obviously a huge one, it won&#39;t necessarily make or break a movie&#39;s chances. Marketing strategies, box office competition, and the allure of big names can all affect how many people buy tickets to see a movie, regardless of how good it actually is. Some franchises grow exponentially because a movie is so well-received, and this means that the sequel will often make more money.
There are plenty of franchises where the highest-grossing movie is also widely considered to be the best. The Dark Knight is still the most successful Batman movie, for example, and no Mission: Impossible movie has made more money than Fallout. Other franchises like Harry Potter or Toy Story have a few movies which are all high-quality, so any number of them are worthy of being the highest-grossing. Quality and financial success do correlate for most franchises, but others have some strange movies occupying the number one spot, and they don&#39;t represent the franchise&#39;s best.









 








 10  Star Wars 
Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens (2015) - $937 million


Close







The return of Star Wars was one of the biggest events in cinema of the 2010s, so it&#39;s only natural that The Force Awakens would shatter the franchise&#39;s box office record. The seventh movie in the Skywalker saga brings back beloved characters like Han Solo, Leia, and Chewbacca, while setting up the journeys for the future of the franchise in Rey, Kylo Ren, and Finn. The Star Wars sequel trilogy is controversial among the franchise&#39;s most dedicated fans, and The Force Awakens is no exception. The plot recycles some old tropes, like the presence of an evil galactic government with a planet-killing weapon. The original trilogy remains unsurpassed.





 9  Jurassic Park 
Jurassic World (2015) - $652 million
        

The impressive visual effects of Jurassic World allowed the franchise to render its prehistoric theme park with more precise detail and a much broader scope than before. Jurassic World succeeds in creating an immersive vision of dinosaurs brought back to life, and many of the movie&#39;s best moments come in the early stages as visitors explore the park. But in terms of compelling characters and a tense plot, the original Jurassic Park, directed by Steven Spielberg, is still the pinnacle of the franchise. The Jurassic World trilogy faded in both box office appeal and critical acclaim, leaving the future of the Jurassic Park franchise uncertain.





 8  Rocky 
Rocky IV (1985) - $300 million
 Rocky IV introduces the towering Russian boxer Ivan Drago, played by Dolph Lundgren. He&#39;s one of the franchise&#39;s most memorable opponents, an ice-cold knockout machine powered by Soviet science, and an embodiment of American Cold War anxieties. Rocky IV raises the stakes with the death of Apollo Creed, but the cheesy dialogue and music-video style rob the movie of the quiet intensity which makes Rocky so successful. Even Creed, and arguably both of its sequels, surpass Rocky IV. Drago returns to the franchise in Creed II, and a controversial Ivan Drago spinoff is also in the works. Hopefully, it will refrain from too many pop-music montages.





 7  The Matrix 
The Matrix Reloaded (2003) - $739 million


Close







The Matrix could have functioned as a perfect standalone movie, but two sequels were released in 2003. After Neo achieves near-infinite power at the end of the first movie, the script for The Matrix Reloaded is forced to contrive ways for him to be conveniently out of the way during some of its biggest action set-pieces, like the highway chase. When Neo is involved, such as when he fights a small army of Agent Smiths, the CGI effects are a little uncanny, and the fight scenes generally lack the punch of the first movie. The Matrix proposes a unique concept, but the sequel struggles to find an interesting next step.





 6  Pirates Of The Caribbean 
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest (2006) - $1 billion
        

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#39;s Chest was an unstoppable box office hit. At the time, it was Disney&#39;s highest-grossing movie ever, but it&#39;s tangled plots are a little messy compared to The Curse of the Black Pearl. After the enormous success of the first movie, the franchise shifted more focus on Jack Sparrow, the far more eye-catching character, but Will was always the heart of the movies. Dead Man&#39;s Chest still delivers some thrilling action and a healthy dose of mystery. The visual effects on Davy Jones and Bootstrap Bill are remarkably elegant, not just for their realism but for the way they contribute to the characterization.





 5  Indiana Jones 
Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) - $787 million
        

The debate over the best Indiana Jones movie generally focuses on Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, but The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull surpassed them both at the box office. The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is widely criticized for it&#39;s over-the-top action sequences and its heavy reliance on CGI. The scene in which Indy survives a nuclear explosion by hiding in a refrigerator is just one example, but the entire plot requires audiences to suspend their disbelief far more than before. Shia LaBeouf was meant to take over the franchise, but his character was killed off-screen before The Dial of Destiny.





 4  Die Hard 
Live Free or Die Hard (2007) - $382 million
        

Live Free or Die Hard mischaracterizes John McClane as some sort of indestructible superhero. The genius of Die Hard is that John is much closer to a regular person than many of the other muscle-bound action heroes of the 1980s. He has some special training, but he isn&#39;t Rambo or the Terminator. When he walks through broken glass it hurts, and when he faces off against Hans Gruber it seems as though he could genuinely die. Live Free or Die Hard becomes a much more generic action thriller with this change, although it&#39;s an exciting one nonetheless. Die Hard and Die Hard With a Vengeance are more original, though.





 3  Transformers 
Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) - $1.1 billion
        

Transformers: Dark of the Moon may not be the worst installment in the franchise, and fans of Michael Bay&#39;s flair for chaotic, explosive action will likely come away satisfied. The blockbuster also boasts a surprisingly prestigious supporting cast, with Frances McDormand and John Malkovich both appearing. The first movie in the saga, 2007&#39;s Transformers does a little more work developing Sam Witwicky and those around him, so that the action is supported by genuine human emotion. 2018&#39;s Bumblebee is another strong contender for the best movie in the franchise, and it finally features a more nuanced female character, which the franchise&#39;s earlier movies sorely lack.

The Transformers movies offer a lot of CGI and explosions, but the best ones are full of heart. From Michael Bay&#39;s films to Bumblebee, which is best?









 2  King Kong 
Kong: Skull Island (2017) - $561 million
        

The original King Kong was a revolutionary monster movie back in 1933. Its practical effects pushed the boundaries of filmmaking, even if technological advancements have since made them seem antiquated and cute. Still, King Kong has a bold visual style and a compelling plot that can be enjoyed 90 years later. The movie doesn&#39;t connect with audiences in the way that it used to, but it has its charms. Peter Jackson&#39;s 2005 remake is a brilliant modern retelling of the classic story, and although King Kong movies have gotten much bigger since then, they haven&#39;t necessarily gotten better. The upcoming Godzilla x Kong must focus on its human characters too.





 1  Alien 
Prometheus (2012) - $402 million


Close







The Alien franchise still hasn&#39;t reached the same heights of the first two movies, each considered sci-fi classics in their own right. Prometheus is set decades before the original Alien, and it fleshes out the universe with some new concepts and new alien races. But the expanded scope of Prometheus isn&#39;t necessarily a good thing. Alien works so well because the horrors of the xenomorph are largely unknown. The setting is kept very simple, so that each shocking twist is more unexpected, and the characters discover the alien&#39;s powers gradually. Prometheus is a different kind of movie in many ways, and its $130 million budget shows how the franchise changed.
