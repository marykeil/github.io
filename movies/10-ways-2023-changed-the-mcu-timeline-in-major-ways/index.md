## Literature Review

Over the course of 2023, the releases into the MCU changed the franchise&#39;s timeline in a considerable number of interesting and exciting ways. 




The Marvel Cinematic Universe was bolstered by multiple releases in 2023, causing many big changes to the franchise&#39;s timeline and impacting its past, present, and future. 2023 saw three theatrical cinematic releases in the MCU: Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and The Marvels. There were also multiple MCU TV shows released on Disney&#43;, with the second seasons of both Loki and What If…? released on the streaming platform, as well as Secret Invasion and its rebel Skrull storyline. Across these many titles, the franchise’s story continued to unfold, with its Multiverse Saga taking shape over the year.
With alternate realities and timelines being a key part of the Multiverse saga, the MCU’s movie timeline has been affected by the franchise’s 2023 releases. Many of 2023’s offerings have naturally impacted the way in which the MCU’s future will progress, but there have also been instances in which they have retroactively changed the timeline. Retcons, revelations, and rewritten pasts all came into play during 2023, causing a number of significant shifts in the franchise’s canon and its future stories. Here are 10 major ways that 2023 changed the MCU’s timeline.

 10  The Marvels Directly Sets Up An Important New Team Of Heroes 
The Marvels (2023)


 







Though The Marvels’ cast featured many of its own heroes, the film also set up a spin-off with massive potential within the MCU. The Marvels ended with Kamala Khan recruiting Kate Bishop for her own superhero team, directly establishing the foundations of the MCU’s Young Avengers. The introduction of a newer and younger team of heroes is huge for the MCU’s future, as it could drastically change the landscape of future releases by heading in a slightly new direction. The power levels of the respective heroes likely involved in the team will also be a major matter, making it an even more crucial subject for the franchise to have introduced.





 9  The Marvels Confirmed Captain Marvel DID Return To Earth During The Blip

The Marvels also opted to address one of the MCU’s most-cited plot holes, retroactively rewriting the franchise’s timeline in the process. The film confirms that Captain Marvel did actually visit Earth during the Blip, despite it previously having been assumed she had not. The sequel’s explanation painted Captain Marvel in a more human light, subtly retconning a previous narrative misstep while strengthening the characterization of the hero. In that respect, the revelation is likely to have an effect on both the timeline’s past and future, helping shape Captain Marvel’s story arc moving forward.





 8  Quantumania Confirmed The Incredible Scope Of Kang In The MCU

In keeping with the MCU’s tradition, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania’s post-credits scenes help to set up the franchise’s upcoming stories, but the Council of Kangs actually has much further-reaching implications. The scene acts as visual confirmation of the sheer number and organization of Kang variants in the MCU, establishing the true scope of the threat they pose to the franchise’s heroes. The Council of Kangs serves to highlight the number of timelines containing Kang variants, thereby having potential ramifications across the past, present, and future of the MCU. Kang’s place within the multiverse being as important as it is, the scene has a big impact on the overall timeline.





 7  A Loki Season 2 Easter Egg Creates Interesting Questions About Thor’s Past

A minor Easter egg in Loki season 2 creates a nagging narrative inconsistency that seemingly rewrites the MCU timeline. In 2011’s Thor, the hero remarks about his banishment being his first experience of Earth. Eternals mentioned Thor in a way that seemingly undermined this idea, but Loki confirmed that Thor had visited Earth previously by having a statue of his likeness appear in 1893. The decision to embrace Thor’s status as a god and the connected history is an interesting one, and it also subtly retcons an element of his MCU past.





 6  The MCU’s New Avengers Feature Multiple OP Characters 
Secret Invasion (2023), The Marvels (2023)


 







One of the most notable ways in which 2023 influenced the MCU’s timeline is the power levels of its core heroes increasing. Multiple candidates for the franchise’s new Avengers team possess massive power, with the likes of Captain Marvel and the overpowered G’iah both likely additions to the roster. However, there’s also Ms. Marvel, who now possesses both quantum bands, which have been shown to be powerful enough to tear the fabric of reality. With so many powerful potential Avengers now in the MCU, 2023 reshaped the power balance of the entire franchise.





 5  Spider-Man: Homecoming’s Timeline Was Retconned In 2023 
Marvel Rewrote The MCU&#39;s Official Timeline
        

Although 2023 saw some big MCU retcons, only one actually occurred outside of conventional canon. One of the most well-known Marvel mistakes involved Spider-Man: Homecoming’s timeline, as the film opened by explaining it took place eight years after the events of The Avengers. However, this was later contradicted by Infinity War and Endgame, which placed Homecoming’s place in the timeline in the middle of the Blip, where Spider-Man was dead. Marvel addressed the problem in 2023 by simply changing the official timeline to set Homecoming four years after The Avengers, admitting their mistake and fixing the plot hole as best they could.





 4  Secret Invasion’s War Machine Skrull Reveal Affects Previous Avengers Movies

The much-anticipated Secret Invasion offered up several revelations about the characters of the MCU, but few were as exciting as the reveal that Rhodey – A.K.A. War Machine – had been replaced by a Skrull. Subtle hints were included to tease that Rhodey may have been replaced earlier than expected, potentially affecting multiple Avengers movies. The specific timeline of Rhodey’s capture by the Skrulls will likely be explored in Armor Wars, but it has already affected the perspective from which the character’s story so far is viewed.





 3  The Marvels Confirmed Where The X-Men Have Been 
The Marvels (2023)
        

Though the sequel featured several interesting moments, one of its most exciting came during The Marvels’ post-credits scene, which has already begun to influence the MCU’s timeline. After finding herself trapped in an alternate reality, Monica Rambeau meets Beast, appearing to confirm that the MCU’s X-Men exist within an alternate universe. Whether this will affect the MCU’s past remains to be seen, but it will certainly shape the franchise’s future, as it establishes that the X-Men’s story has seemingly been running alongside the MCU’s in another timeline.





 2  Secret Invasion Revealed Nick Fury&#39;s Endgame Betrayal of The Avengers

Secret Invasion made a habit of dropping bombshells that shook up the MCU, but none were bigger than the Harvest. The show reveals that Nick Fury tasked a team of Skrulls with gathering the Avengers’ DNA after the Battle of Earth as a sort of contingency plan, establishing the moment as a betrayal of the trust afforded to the former SHIELD director. The Harvest also seemed to confirm that unseen heroes had attended Endgame’s climactic battle, with DNA samples of absent heroes included to quietly rewrite the MCU’s timeline.





 1  Loki Season 2 Destroyed The Sacred Timeline 
Loki Season 2 (2023)


 







2023 saw many changes to the MCU’s timeline, but Loki season 2 ended with a spectacular finale that actually changed every timeline all at once. After realizing the only way to stabilize the Multiverse was to take control of the timelines and allow the Sacred Timeline itself to be destroyed, Loki became the MCU&#39;s God of Stories. The moment has ramifications across the franchise’s past, present and future, making it the most important change to the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline in 2023.
