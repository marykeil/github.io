## Literature Review

The trailer for Signature Films&#39; upcoming movie Marmalade shows Stranger Things star Joe Keery dragged into a life of crime by his dream girl.




The official trailer for Marmalade, an upcoming romance crime thriller with Stranger Things star Joe Keery, has been released. Keery, who gained prominence playing Steve Harrington in the Netflix show, has recently taken on a number of dramatic and comedic roles, quickly establishing himself as a versatile and brilliant actor on the rise. Marmalade is the latest movie where Keery will display his admirable acting chops, playing Baron, a convicted felon dragged into a life of crime by the girl of his dreams.




Now, Signature Entertainment, the production company behind Marmalade, has released a trailer for the forthcoming romantic heist film. Check out the exciting look at the new movie below:


 

The trailer reveals Keery&#39;s character plotting with his love interest, the titular Marmalade, to rob a bank, plus more of what audiences can expect from the thriller. This includes Baron&#39;s motivation to steal, as well as a moment implying Marmalade turns on him.


 Who Else Is Involved in Marmalade? 
          

Marmalade comes from Australian–American actor Keir O’Donnell, who single-handedly wrote and directed it. Before this feature directorial debut, O’Donnell amassed a wealth of experience in front of the camera, starring in multiple television shows and movies. These include Clint Eastwood’s biographical war drama American Sniper, Wedding Crashers, Fargo, Masters of Sex, and Marc Webb’s moving drama Gifted.




Camila Morrone, who recently starred as Camila Alvarez-Dunne in the Emmy-nominated series Daisy Jones &amp; the Six, plays opposite Keery as Marmalade. Aldis Hodge, who featured in DC’s Black Adam, also appears in the trailer as the movie&#39;s third main cast member. Marmalade&#39;s synopsis describes it as an “edge-of-the-seat crime-tinged romance tale.”

While O’Donnell’s inexperience as a director surely raises a few questions about how Marmalade will turn out, his vast experience in front of the camera is an asset. Particularly in recent years, there&#39;s been a long line of successful actors-turned-directors, including Bradley Cooper, Olivia Wilde, and Greta Gerwig. That, coupled with the healthy crop of creative talents O&#39;Donnell&#39;s employed on Marmalade, indicates that the thriller, which releases in February, should be worth the wait.
