## Literature Review

Fan art for the upcoming DCU has cast a popular actor from the MCU in the role of Robin now that speculation abounds in the wake of the DCEU&#39;s end.




Fan casting for the new DCU has become popular as fans anticipate the arrival of the new slew of movies, including The Brave and the Bold, and one MCU star has become the latest to be cast as Robin in some impressive fan art. Now that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has heralded the end of the DCEU, a brand new cinematic franchise helmed by James Gunn and Peter Safran will reconceptualize DC&#39;s heroes in a string of new movies. The Brave and the Bold has been announced as the newest Batman movie to comprise part of DC&#39;s new cinematic universe, with Batman&#39;s sidekick, Robin, playing a central role.




In a post via Instagram, user @Buffy2Ville has depicted what MCU star Barry Keoghan, who played Druig in the MCU&#39;s Eternals, could look like in the role of Robin and Nightwing. Many characters have assumed the mantle of Batman&#39;s sidekick over DC&#39;s history, including Jason Todd, Dick Grayson, and Damian Wayne. Nightwing, meanwhile, is the moniker assumed by an older Dick Grayson, closer to Keoghan&#39;s age than his tenure as Robin. While this fan art does a great job of fan-casting Keoghan in the role of Grayson, it has already been confirmed that Damian Wayne&#39;s Robin will star in the DCU&#39;s The Brave and the Bold.


 

                  Every Batman Movie Ranked Worst To Best (Including The Batman)   Batman has taken many forms on the silver screen across decades of cinematic history. Here&#39;s how each movie stacks up against the others.   





 What We Know About The DCU&#39;s Batman Reboot So Far 
          

Few actors have been confirmed for the collection of movies and shows that will comprise the DCU&#39;s Chapter One: Gods and Monsters - the cinematic franchise&#39;s first phase of movies. This is particularly true for The Brave and the Bold, which has yet to confirm any casting decisions beyond the fact that neither Ben Affleck nor Robert Pattinson will return. Whoever plays Batman in the DCU, the announcement is likely to be the biggest DC announcement of 2024. Given that Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#39;s son, has been confirmed to appear in the movie, it can be assumed that an actor younger than 31-year-old Barry Keoghan will fill the role, while an older actor will play Bruce Wayne.

The Brave and the Bold&#39;s narrative, meanwhile, is confirmed to be based on Grant Morrison&#39;s run of Batman comics in which Damian Wayne was introduced and killed off within seven years. While that theme in itself is a dark prospect, the DCU is rumored to veer from the dark and dingy undertones that were rife throughout the DCEU. A release date is also yet to be confirmed, but will likely follow the release of The Batman Part II, which is an Elseworlds project separated from the wider DCU narrative.
