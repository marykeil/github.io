## Literature Review

Netflix subscribers can now set Zack Snyder as their profile icon as the streamer officially makes him the first director to have one on the platform.




Netflix honors Zack Snyder by making him the first director to boast a profile icon on the streamer. The streamer has boasted profiles for subscribers since 2013, allowing household members sharing an account to keep their watch histories and &#34;My Lists&#34; separate from each other under their own profiles. By 2018, the profiles got a makeover, allowing users to choose from dozens of characters from Netflix shows and movies to set as their profile pictures, including The Witcher, The Sandman, Cowboy Bebop, Cobra Kai and One Piece, among others.




Netflix announced via Twitter that subscribers can now set Snyder&#39;s headshot as their profile icon.


 

The streamer noted it was quite an honor as he is the first director to get a profile icon. It also illustrated its positive stance on Snyder&#39;s filmmaking talents, as it labeled him &#34;iconic.&#34;


 Profile Icon Further Solidifies Zack Snyder and Netflixâ€™s Partnership 
          

Netflix&#39;s gesture of honoring Snyder with a profile icon indicates that their partnership is still strong. After all, Snyder&#39;s most recent film for the streamer, Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire, soared to the No. 1 movie in the world shortly after its release with an estimated whopping 54.1 million viewing hours. The sci-fi epic received fairly poor reviews from critics. However, there&#39;s evidence that the streamer is more concerned with viewership than sheer critical acclaim, hence why it signed a deal with Adam Sandler after his streaming film, The Ridiculous Six, earned a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.




As a result, Netflix and Snyder have treated Rebel Moon as a success. Meanwhile, with the second installment, Rebel Moon - Part 2: The Scargiver, arriving shortly, Netflix may soon have two Snyder films back-to-back that garner widespread attention. Netflix and Snyder started their official partnership in 2021 when the latter&#39;s production company, Stone Quarry Productions, inked a first-look deal with the streamer, meaning that Netflix got the first opportunity to bid on Snyder&#39;s future projects.

Since then, the streamer has shown no signs of parting with the filmmaker. In addition to the second Rebel Moon installment, Snyder is also reportedly developing a Norse mythology anime series for the streamer. He has also expressed interest in further expanding both the Rebel Moon and Army of the Dead universes, currently working on a sequel for his first movie in the latter. As Snyder and Netflix continue growing their relationship, some fans of the filmmaker are still holding on to the hope that Netflix will somehow purchase the rights to his DC films and bring the SnyderVerse back. Although it&#39;s unlikely Netflix will save the SnyderVerse, the streamer seems open to further Snyder&#39;s ideas for the foreseeable future.
