## Literature Review

While they won&#39;t be as prolific as previous years for myriad reasons, there are still plenty of superhero movies releasing in 2024 to look forward to.




2024 is a quieter year than usual for superhero movie releases following a disappointing 2023 for the MCU and DCEU, critically and financially. The superhero genre is looking more precarious than ever as superhero fatigue appears to be setting in, while the SAG-AFTRA strikes of Summer 2023 took a heavy toll on the release schedules of all studios, with the MCU, in particular, resolving to push many of their 2024 release dates back by several months. Meanwhile, the DCEU&#39;s swansong, Aquaman and the Last Kingdom, signaled a hefty break for DC studios, which plans to reboot the cinematic franchise with the DCU starting in 2025.




That doesn&#39;t mean, however, that there still aren&#39;t plenty of superhero movies to get stuck into over the next 12 months. The Sony Spider-Man Universe, in particular, is ramping up releases with three major titles for the franchise set to drop in 2024 alone. Animated movies are also still steaming ahead, rounding out the release schedule for 2024. Whether the absence of the typical MCU and DCEU onslaught leaves the year feeling bereft or acts as a palate cleanser remains to be seen, but these 2024 superhero movies still leave plenty to look forward to.

                  Every Upcoming Marvel Movie: Full MCU Phase 5 &amp; 6 List (&amp; Beyond)   Between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment, here is every upcoming Marvel movie release date and what we know about the projects so far.   


 Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths - January 9, 2024 
Part Of DC&#39;s Tomorrowverse
          




The Multiverse currently seems to be the superhero genre&#39;s most pervasive theme, and DC&#39;s animated movies are no exception. Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths is set to adapt DC&#39;s seminal multiverse story in which a vast multiversal war brings about one single DC Universe, resulting in the deaths of many of DC&#39;s most illustrious characters. It comes at an interesting time for DC, as the animated depiction of a multiversal &#34;reboot&#34; precedes the live-action reboot of live-action DC movies in the form of the DCU.

Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part One will be the first in a trilogy of movies and the eleventh installment in DC&#39;s beloved Tomorrowverse franchise. The movie will first be released digitally on January 9, while a 4K UHD version will follow on January 23, 2024. While a specific date is still to be confirmed for the two sequels, they are also slated for release later in the year.



 Madame Web - February 14, 2024 
Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe
         




   Madame Web      Release Date    February 14, 2024     Director    S.J. Clarkson     Cast    Dakota Johnson , Emma Roberts , Adam Scott , Isabela Merced , Sydney Sweeney      

Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe continues in 2024 with Madame Web, starring Dakota Johnson as an atypical rendition of Cassandra Web, who is much younger than depicted in the comics. When the Sony Spider-Man Universe finally features the eponymous web-slinger in the flesh remains to be seen, but Madame Web will at least star Spider-People in the form of Julia Carptenter/Spider-Woman (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin/Spider-Woman (Celeste O&#39;Connor), and Anya Corazón/Araña/Spider-Girl (Isabela Merced).

Ezekiel Sim is also joining the spider-ranks, but the mystical mentor of Peter Parker seems to be taking on a villainous role in this movie. Or, at least, that is what the trailers seem to depict. Either way, the myriad mysteries surrounding Madame Web can be answered when it releases on Valentine&#39;s Day, February 14.






 Deadpool 3 - July 26, 2024 
Marvel Cinematic Universe
          

   Deadpool 3      Release Date    July 26, 2024     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Ryan Reynolds , Hugh Jackman , Morena Baccarin , Brianna Hildebrand , Jennifer Garner     Rating    R      

After a substandard year for the MCU, it is foregoing its typical schedule of three cinematic releases in favor of just one: Deadpool&#39;s MCU debut. This turn of events follows the SAG-AFTRA strikes over the summer of 2023, which has inflicted lengthy delays on Marvel&#39;s initial release schedule, although this could be a blessing in disguise. A single cinematic release for the MCU in 2024 offers a moment of reprieve for an audience that may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of releases populating the Multiverse Saga. Deadpool 3, meanwhile, is no typical MCU movie, as it promises an R-rated romp through memory lane.




Hype for the third Deadpool installment has reached a fever pitch as the promise of Fox&#39;s X-Men characters is set to capitalize on the nostalgia that seems to be a surefire hit for Marvel, as the filmmakers dance around confirming whether rumors of Taylor Swift&#39;s involvement are merited. Meanwhile, Deadpool 3 star Ryan Reynolds recently confirmed that the Deadpool variant, Dogpool, will also play a starring role, teasing the multiversal shenanigans that he will be engaging in throughout the movie. The MCU&#39;s one and only movie for 2024 will release on July 26, promising to be this summer&#39;s biggest blockbuster.



 Kraven The Hunter - August 30, 2024 
Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe
         

   Kraven the Hunter      Release Date    August 30, 2024     Director    J.C. Chandor     Cast    Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Russell Crowe , Ariana DeBose , Christopher Abbott , Alessandro Nivola , Levi Miller      




 Kraven The Hunter was initially slated to be released one year ago before being delayed twice, to October 6, 2023, and now August 30, 2024. Beyond the effects of the SAG-AFTRA strikes, the reasons for such severe delays are unclear, though it is likely that the Sony Spider-Man Universe is gunning for another box-office smash reminiscent of Venom. Distancing Kraven the Hunter as much as possible from the lambasted Morbius and seizing as much time as possible to perfect the final product could be the means through which the studio aims to achieve this.

Either way, this will be Kraven&#39;s first cinematic outing in history, and with Aaron Taylor-Johnson in the titular role, it looks promising. As the Sony Spider-Man Universe has proven to be a habit, Kraven&#39;s origin looks decidedly different from the comics, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily spell doom for the movie. Instead, the franchise could be set to introduce its newest fan-favorite antihero late this summer.



 Joker: Folie à Deux - October 4, 2024 
DC Elseworlds
         




   Joker: Folie a Deux      Release Date    October 4, 2024     Director    Todd Phillips     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Lady Gaga , Brendan Gleeson , Zazie Beetz , Catherine Keener , Jacob Lofland , Harry Lawtey     Rating    R      

The anticipated sequel to Todd Phillips&#39; acclaimed Joker spin-off will be another DC Elseworlds installment, separated from the DC Universe franchise. It will also be DC&#39;s only live-action cinematic release in 2024 as production gets underway for the DCU&#39;s debut title: Superman: Legacy slated for release in 2025. Joker: Folie à Deux will revisit the dismal world of Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) in the aftermath of his violent genesis as the Joker. The sequel will also star Lady Gaga in the role of Harley Quinn as the movie appears set to depict the epitome of all toxic relationships.

Joker made history by becoming the first R-rated movie to gross over $1 billion worldwide. Needless to say, Warner Bros. will be hoping to replicate that success with the sequel - which is no less bold than its predecessor. Gaga&#39;s involvement is rendered all the more applicable by reports that Joker: Folie à Deux will be a musical, proving that Phillips is still committed to pushing boundaries. The results can be seen this Fall, on October 4.






 Venom 3 - November 8, 2024 
Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe
          

   Venom 3      Release Date    November 8, 2024     Director    Kelly Marcel     Cast    Tom Hardy , Juno Temple , Chiwetel Ejiofor      

The anticipated third installment of Sony&#39;s successful Venom franchise has a lot of questions to answer as it follows Venom&#39;s fleeting foray into the MCU as depicted in Spider-Man: No Way Home&#39;s post-credits scene. It will be hard for the Venom: Let There Be Carnage sequel to brush a jaunt through the multiverse under the rug. Meanwhile, Venom&#39;s gutsy convenience store owner, Mrs. Chen, also recently came into contact with an animated Spot from Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, meaning that Venom 3 has a couple of multiversal plot threads to address.




Additionally, with a release pushed back several months from June to November, the movie will still follow Kraven the Hunter in the current schedule. This might suggest that the Sony Cinematic Universe will start forming connections between its own movies. Regardless, Venom 3 will be Sony&#39;s third Marvel movie release of the year on November 8, meaning that 2024 will be dominated by Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe while the MCU looks to resume its regular three-movie release schedule in 2025.



 Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse - TBD 
Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe
          

   Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse      Director    Joaquim Dos Santos , Kemp Powers , Justin K. Thompson     Cast    Shameik Moore      

Following an incredible response to the second movie in the Spider-Verse trilogy, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has a big act to follow. The third outing for Miles Morales will pick up on the huge cliffhanger at the end of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, bringing together a crack team of Spider-variants introduced in the first two movies as they attempt to rescue Morales from a universe he doesn&#39;t belong in. This is while Miguel O&#39;Hara, AKA Spider-Man 2099, and most of the Spider-Society attempt to capture Morales to prevent him from disrupting more Canon Events.




The Spot, meanwhile, is at large and wreaking havoc across the Multiverse - becoming a threat to every universe all the while. Following the SAG-AFTRA strikes, the original March 2024 release date for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has been removed, with no word on a new one as yet. This could also mean that the movie may be pushed as far back as 2025.



 Batman Azteca: Choque De Imperios - TBD 
DC Elseworlds
          

DC&#39;s animated Batman Azteca: Choque De Imperios is about as close to a What If...? story as the Elseworlds offerings can get, with a story that features Batman as an Aztec native, Yohualli Coatl (Horacio Garcia Rojas), resisting Spanish colonization of his homeland. Much like his more familiar counterpart, Bruce Wayne, Yohualli Coatl&#39;s parents are murdered. Only in this version, their murderers are Conquistadors. Little has been revealed beyond the expected 2024 release, but this animated offering from Juan Jose Meza-Leon will certainly stand as a testament to the creative liberties afforded by the Elseworlds banner.






 Watchmen - TBD 
DC Elseworlds
          

An animated movie of the influential DC graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons is set for release later this year. This will be the third time that the seminal story will be adapted, after 2009&#39;s live-action Watchmen movie and 2019&#39;s Watchmen sequel series. The R-rating for the animated Watchmen promisingly suggests that it won&#39;t shy away from the darker themes of the original. For now, details are still scarce on a specific release date.
