## Literature Review

Blake Lively&#39;s controversial romance movie It Ends With Us, which is based on the book byÂ Colleen Hoover, has delayed its 2024 release date.




Blake Lively&#39;s controversial romance movie, It Ends With Us, has delayed its 2024 release date. Based on the best-selling book of the same name by Colleen Hoover, the upcoming romance movie stars Gossip Girl&#39;s Blake Lively as Lily Bloom, a college graduate who moves to Boston and falls for a neurosurgeon, Ryle Kincaid (played by Justin Baldoni, who also directs), though their relationship is complicated further when her old flame, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar) re-enters her life. In addition to the aforementioned stars, the cast also includes Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj.




Now, previously scheduled for a pre-Valentine&#39;s Day weekend release, the romance movie has been moved to the summer. According to Deadline, It Ends With Us&#39; release date has been delayed from February 9 to June 21. In turn, it will no longer be released on the same day as Zelda Williams&#39; Lisa Frankenstein, Pixar&#39;s Turning Red, and Out of Darkness. Instead, its only competition on June 21 will be The Bikeriders.


 Why It Ends With Us Is Controversial 
          

The source material itself has been controversial due to its depictions of domestic violence and verbal abuse, though the controversy surrounding the film adaptation is because of Blake Lively&#39;s casting. Fans of the book believe that the 36-year-old actress is too old to play Lily Bloom who, in the novel, is fresh out of college and in her early 20s. After the backlash to Lively&#39;s casting, author Colleen Hoover admitted she made a mistake making Lily so young in the book:






Back when I wrote It Ends With Us, the new adult (genre) was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That&#39;s what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young. I didn&#39;t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There&#39;s not a 20-something neurosurgeon. As I started making this movie, I&#39;m like, we need to age them out, because I messed up. So that&#39;s my fault.




As indicated by her comments, aging the characters up for the movie was an intentional choice by Hoover, who is &#34;extremely happy with the casting&#34; of Lively and Baldoni. In the book, Lily Bloom and Ryle Kincaid are 23 and 30 years old, respectively, though Lively and Baldoni are in their mid-to-late-30s. All in all, Hoover adapting It Ends With Us into a movie provided her with an opportunity to correct her mistake.
