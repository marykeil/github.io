## Literature Review

Starring Kevin Hart, Netflix&#39;s Lift walks through a meticulous gold heist that presents many gripping twists and turns before it reaches its ending.





Summary

  Cyrus successfully executes a gold heist while outsmarting Interpol, ultimately profiting his team.   The heist plan goes through several last-minute changes but Cyrus figures out a way to make the best of it.   Abby quits Interpol and joins Cyrus&#39; team, setting the stage for potential sequels in a franchise-like fashion.  







Lift&#39;s ending twist reveals how Cyrus successfully executed his gold heist while outsmarting Interpol. Directed by F. Gary Gray, of The Fate of the Furious fame, Netflix&#39;s Lift begins with Cyrus and his team abducting N8, an artist who created a single-edition NFT. Although Abby, who works for Interpol, tries to stop them, Cyrus stays one step ahead and manages to get away in the nick of time. After taking N8 to his team&#39;s yacht, Cyrus reveals that kidnapping an artist puts a story behind his art, which, in turn, skyrockets his value. This allows the price of N8&#39;s NFT to go up and ultimately profits Cyrus&#39; team as well.

Although Cyrus and Co. stick to stealing art and ensuring that art creators earn the credit they deserve, they find themselves in a novel space when Interpol recruits them to steal gold from a billionaire named Lars. Cyrus is initially apprehensive about the mission but eventually agrees and formulates the perfect plan to pull it off. Not everything goes as planned, but Cyrus figures out a way to make the best out of the chips he is dealt with.

 How Cyrus &amp; His Team Stole Lars&#39; Gold In Lift&#39;s Ending 
One Lift twist reveals how Cyrus acquired the gold
         

According to Cyrus&#39; initial plan in Lift, he and his team were supposed to steal the $500 million worth of gold and send it to Interpol through a train. In Lift&#39;s closing arc, it seems like Interpol acquires the gold after they show up at Lars&#39; residence to arrest him. However, before the film&#39;s credits start rolling, Kevin Hart&#39;s Cyrus reveals that not only did they successfully get Lars arrested but also managed to steal the gold. He discloses that while he and Abby were negotiating with Harry and convincing him to become an insider in ATC in Brussels, Magnus made a crate full of gold-painted metal bars.




After unlocking the safe that accommodated Lars&#39; gold, Magnus cleverly swapped the real gold crate with the one having the fake gold-painted iron bars. Magnus then ejected the crate containing the real gold bars off of the plane, and Luke, who Abby assumed had backed out of the mission, steered the gold to a safe location. Lift&#39;s opening arc establishes Cyrus as a Robin Hood-esque figure who steals from the rich and pays the ones who truly deserve it. By stealing from Lars and ensuring that the gold does not land in the hands of a corrupt Interpol officer like Huxley, Cyrus fulfills his goal and ensures that his team members get paid for all the risks they took during the mission.

Although Lars tries to avoid his arrest by claiming that Cyrus and his team are the intruders, Cyrus proves he is a criminal by asking Mi-sun to play the video where he kills the Leviathan presentative.







The first step in Cyrus and his team&#39;s plan was to fly a private jet close to the gold-carrying A380 to be able to swap its radar signature. After this, they used a Portable Signal Interference Device (PSID) to cut all GPS transmissions between the A380 and Air Traffic Control, which turned the A380 invisible. They then launched a drone with a transponder carrying the A380&#39;s radar sign and sent it to Zurich. While all this was happening, one of them opened the vault on the A380 that stored Lars&#39; gold and replaced it with fake gold-painted iron bars. After successfully making the heist, they landed in the Alps from where they were supposed to send the gold to Huxley.

However, their plan in Lift took an unexpected turn when Lars&#39; men grew suspicious. After they land in the Alps, Lars&#39; men force them to board the gold onto a private jet and fly it to Lars in Tuscany. To prevent Lars and his men from winning, Camila flies the plane in such a way that it shakes off the stealth mode they had previously installed to make it invisible. Without its stealth mode, the plane becomes visible, allowing Interpol to track and find them. Although NATO jets see the private jet as a threat and even try shooting it down, Abby projects the message &#34;Civilians On Board&#34; on the LED screen under the plane to stop them from firing at them.





 

Moments later, Camila, Cyrus, and Abby crash-land the plan in front of Lars&#39; estate, and Cyrus asks Mi-sun to use the M8 cameras on the plane to record everything that happens during their encounter with Lars. Lars murders the Leviathan representative after she refuses to deal with him and points his gun at Abby and Cyrus. However, before he can kill them, Interpol arrives after tracking down the plane. Although Lars tries to avoid his arrest by claiming that Cyrus and his team are the intruders, Cyrus proves he is a criminal by asking Mi-sun to play the video where he kills the Leviathan presentative.

                  All The Rock &amp; Kevin Hart Movies, Ranked Worst To Best   Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson and Kevin Hart have become an unlikely comic double act in recent years, and here&#39;s their movies ranked worst to best.   






 Every Main Character&#39;s Role In Lift&#39;s Heist Plan Explained 
Cyrus (Kevin Hart)
          

Kevin Hart&#39;s Cyrus is the mastermind behind the plan who not only formulates all the steps they must follow to steal the gold but also solves many problems that arise along the way. For instance, when Abby accidentally breaks the PSID in the A380&#39;s washroom, he helps her fix it before it is too late. He also finds a way to save his team from Lars&#39; men and even uses his quick wit to outsmart Lars in Lift&#39;s final arc.

Camila (Ursula Corbero)
In Cyrus&#39; plan in Lift, Camila serves as the main pilot who flies the private jet close enough to the A380 to be able to swap signals with it. Later in the movie, she also does an incredible job at getting rid of the private jet&#39;s stealth mode and making it visible to Interpol. Her flying skills also come in handy when she and the crew have to crash-land in front of Lars&#39; estate.




Abby (Gugu Mbatha-Raw)
          

Like Cyrus, Abby is also the frontrunner in the plan, who is initially given the responsibility to assemble and place the PSID in the A380&#39;s washroom. She later also helps project the &#34;Civilians On Board&#34; message on the private jet&#39;s LED, which saves them from getting shot in midair by NATO. Towards the end of Lift, Abby also leaves her job at Interpol and becomes a full-time member of Cyrus&#39; team.

Magnus (Billy Magnussen)
Magnus is the safecracker on Cyrus&#39;s team. He uses lasers to crack open Lars&#39; gold vault while using a Stewart platform to stabilize his laser during the flight&#39;s turbulence. He also replaces the original gold crate with the one that contains gold-painted metal bars.

Luke (Viveik Kalra)
Luke initially seems apprehensive about the mission and even seems to back off at the last moment. However, it later turns out that Luke&#39;s departure was a part of Cyrus&#39; elaborate plan to steal the gold. After Cyrus replaced the real gold with metal bars, he ejected the real gold crate off the plane. Luke then used a remote to control the parachute on the gold crate and hide the gold in a safe, hidden location.




Denton (Vincent D’Onofrio)
          

Denton is the master of disguise on Cyrus&#39; team. His job on the A380 flight is to distract the cabin crew, so that Magnus can peacefully break into Lars&#39; gold vault. To achieve this, he gets the cabin crew involved in an intriguing conversation as Magnus sneaks to the back of the plane.

Mi-Sun (Yun Jee Kim)
Yun Jee Kim&#39;s Mi-Sun is the leading engineer in the crew. She designs the Portable Signal Interference Device. However, since it initially looks like a bomb, she divides it into individual components, allowing everyone involved in the plan to carry it on the plane without raising any suspicion. In the movie&#39;s final arc, she also helps Cyrus record Lars&#39; crime.



Lift is available for streaming on Netflix.









 Why Huxley Wanted Cyrus To Steal From Lars 
The real reason why Interpol recruited Cyrus &amp; his team
          

In Lift&#39;s opening arc, Huxley (played by Sam Worthington) tells Abby that Lars Jorgensen has joined forces with a hacker group called Leviathan to attack all water sources worldwide. He adds that Lars&#39; mission would not only crash economies but also flood cities and lead to water shortages, threatening the lives of millions. However, since Interpol has no concrete evidence to prove what he is up to, they cannot directly arrest him. Therefore, Huxley deduces that they can only stop Lars by preventing him from making a deal with Leviathan. Since Lars intends to pay Leviathan in gold, Huxley asks Abby to convince Cyrus to steal the gold to stop Lars&#39; deal.

In Lift&#39;s ending arc, Abby learns that Huxley did not stop the NATO jets from firing at them. Instead, he was the one encouraging them to blow their private plane to bits. Realizing that Interpol&#39;s leading forces do not care about her, Abby leaves the organization. She then joins Cyrus and his team because, after spending enough time with them, she understands that they are all well-intended and genuinely want to make the world a better place. Part of the reason why she joins the team is also because she realizes that she must give her relationship with Cyrus a second chance.



 How The Ending Sets Up Lift 2 
Lift&#39;s ending paves the way for potential sequels
          

Netflix&#39;s Lift ends on a well-rounded note where Cyrus and his team steal from a corrupt billionaire, outsmart Interpol, and even manage to get their hands on $500 million worth of gold. However, by getting Abby involved in the central team, Lift sets the stage for a Fast &amp; Furious-esque franchise, where Cyrus and his partners could set out on new heist adventures in sequel films. Now that Interpol is not supporting them but looking for them after they stole the gold, Lift 2 could also be about Huxley attempting to track them down as they dupe other immoral billionaires.
