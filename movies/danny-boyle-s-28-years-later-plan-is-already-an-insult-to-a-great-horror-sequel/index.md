# Danny Boyle s 28 Years Later Plan Is Already An Insult To A Great Horror Sequel


## SUMMARY 



Boyle and Garland&#39;s return for 28 Years Later suggests big plans for the underrated zombie franchise, disregarding the efforts of 28 Weeks Later.

Despite the success of 28 Weeks Later, the upcoming trilogy will likely ignore it as Garland will be writing all three films.

Boyle&#39;s vision and his previous success with 28 Days Later make him the perfect choice to direct 28 Years Later and continue the franchise&#39;s legacy.

## Literature Review
Danny Boyle&#39;s upcoming 28 Years Later sees the director team up with Alex Garland. Despite ignoring 28 Weeks Later, the new movie can be successful.
