## Literature Review

Exclusive: Nia DaCosta praises Brie Larson’s on-set demeanor in a featurette detailing the actor’s return in The Marvels, on digital January 16th.




The Marvels picked up where the events of 2019’s Captain Marvel, 2021’s WandaVision, and 2022’s Ms. Marvel left off, turning Brie Larson’s Carol Danvers, Teyonah Parris’ Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani’s Kamala Khan into a veritable power trio. The film was lauded for its comedy, effective in part due to the chemistry between its three lead actors. It also set up future big-screen stories to come not just for Captain Marvel, but also for Ms. Marvel and Monica Rambeau.




The Marvels’ good reviews are also thanks in part to director Nia DaCosta and her co-writers Megan McDonnell (WandaVision) and Elissa Karasik (Loki). Screen Rant is excited to share part of a behind-the-scenes featurette about the making of The Marvels that features DaCosta discussing what the film’s cast—specifically Brie Larson—brought to the table. Take a look at the featurette below, and get ready to purchase The Marvels on digital platforms on January 16th.
