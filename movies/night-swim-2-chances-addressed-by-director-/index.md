## Literature Review

Night Swim director Bryce McGuire discusses the chances that the movie might receive a sequel and the work he has already done to develop it.




Night Swim director Bryce McGuire wants to develop a sequel someday. Based on a 2014 short film that McGuire developed with Rod Blackhurst, the full theatrical version tells the story of a haunted swimming pool. As a family tries to get to the bottom of the pool&#39;s mystery, they need to reckon with deadly ghosts and several mysterious circumstances. The movie had a budget of $15 million and has received a mediocre critical reception.




The Night Swim ending leaves an opening for future adventures, and there&#39;s a good reason for that. McGuire already told GamesRadar&#43; about the fact that he planted an Easter egg to set up sequels, and he recently reiterated that stance to Entertainment Weekly. McGuire explained that, while he wanted the first movie to be relatively &#34;simple,&#34; he planted the seeds for future ideas that he has for the universe. Check out his quote below:


&#34;Look, if there were to be a sequel, I do have an idea, and thereâ€™s lots more of the mythology. I just wanted this first one to be so simple and archetypal. There&#39;s lots more that has already been discussed and could have been in the movie that I would love to get to explore, if people want more.&#34;



 Will Night Swim 2 Happen? 
          




If Night Swim 2 is to happen, the original will need to be more successful than it has been at the box office. Despite a budget of $15 million, the movie has earned only $12 million so far, and it may struggle to produce gains in its second weekend. Night Swim premiered behind Wonka on the box office chart, which is already several weeks into its run. Book of Clarence and Mean Girls are set to premiere on January 12, and both can easily outshine the horror movie.

If Night Swim sinks at the box office, a sequel is unlikely. Yet, even if it struggles to keep its head above the water, there is always a chance that the Blumhouse horror movie can survive after leaving theaters. Blumhouse has not yet announced the streaming date, but the movie can find a second life when it is eventually released on Peacock.



Night Swim currently has a 27 percent critics score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 44 percent audience score.







Unfortunately, the critical reviews for Night Swim have not been overly positive. The horror elements are largely unable to actually promote fear, and the awkward concept of a haunted swimming pool does not help. That could help the movie gain support on Peacock, if it can serve to be viewed through a more satirical lens. McGuire is on board with the idea of developing a sequel, so the future is still bright.
