## SUMMARY 



  LEGO&#39;s Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372) is a must-buy for army-building collectors.

## Literature Review

LEGO has just released a new Star Wars battle pack, featuring a sizable collection of Republic clone troopers and Seperatist battle droids.




LEGO has already released some new Star Wars sets for the new year, including the Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372). This particular pack is a smaller LEGO set compared to others, focusing more on minifigures rather than comprehensive and detailed builds. However, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth adding to the collection, especially for collectors who are in the business of growing their brick-built galactic armies.




The Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droids Battle Pack depicts an average conflict during the Clone Wars from the established Star Wars timeline. Featuring updated versions of classic LEGO Star Wars minifigure staples, there&#39;s plenty to love about this new 2024 LEGO set which was released on January 1st. However, some notable drawbacks are worth mentioning as well. Here&#39;s our review of LEGO Star Wars&#39; new Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372).

 Name  Piece Count  Price  Minifigures  Ages   Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372)  215  $29.99  9  7&#43;   






One of the very first LEGO Star Wars sets released in 2024, the Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack is available for purchase from both LEGO&#39;s website and stores (as well as other retailers). Priced at $29.99 with a 215-piece count, the big draw for this set is the battle pack&#39;s nine exciting minifigures, an impressive number considering the cost. Featuring soldiers on both sides of the Clone Wars, this new LEGO set is essentially both a Republic pack and a Separatist pack that&#39;s been mashed together, creating one exciting set that many Star Wars collectors will likely view as a must-buy. However, there are some cons to the set as well.



Young Jedi Adventures&#39; The Crimson Firehawk (75384) was released on January 1st as well.

 Build Breakdown For LEGO&#39;s 75372 
Unique But Lackluster Additions
         

The new Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack features four unique builds. The Republic side features a rather simple speeder bike made from the Republic&#39;s typical red, gray, and white colors. However, LEGO has made bigger and more complex speeders in the past. There&#39;s also a small barricade/defense turret which the set&#39;s clones can use as cover.

Conversely, the Separatist battle droids get a classic grey and blue STAP (single trooper aerial platform) a common speeder used by the Trade Federation and Seperatist Alliance typically piloted by standard B1-battle droids. That said, this particular STAP design is rather basic compared to past versions. However, the battle pack&#39;s biggest and most unique build is the Octuptarra tri-droid, featuring an updated and bigger design compared to the one featured in LEGO&#39;s Utapau Troopers pack from 2014. That being said, none of the other builds are anything rather significant.






The Octuptarra tri-droid was manufactured by the Separatists&#39; Techno Union and was featured en masse during the Battle of Christophsis, Anakin and Ahsoka Tano&#39;s first meeting in The Clone Wars animated movie.

9 Figures Is The True Appeal
         

Instead, the real excitement comes from the battle pack&#39;s minifigures. On the Republic side, three standard white Phase II clone troopers are featured with updated styles, their newest redesign since 2014 and the fourth update since they first debuted in 2005 in conjunction with the relase of Revenge of the Sith. A white and red shock trooper is added as well, allowing collectors to make their squad of shock troopers from 2023&#39;s Coruscant Guard Gunship (75354) that much bigger.

The pack also features three Super Battle Droids who&#39;ve received an exciting redesign with some additional detailing. However, the two B1 battle droids in the battle pack have not been redesigned (though they&#39;ve never needed one). It&#39;s widely considered by many LEGO Star Wars collectors that LEGO nailed the B1 design right out of the gate when it first got the minifigure treatment back in 1999. As such, it&#39;s rather fitting that these two B1s should be featured in this battle pack, one of the first sets released on LEGO Star Wars&#39; 25th anniversary.

 Consensus: A Prime LEGO Set For Star Wars Army Builders 
It&#39;s Worth Buying For The Minifigures (And Not Much Else)
          

On the whole, the Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372) is a great LEGO set offers quite a bit for its relatively affordable cost. Likewise, this would arguably still be true even if the largely mediocre builds were excluded. To that end, it&#39;s quite evident that this set particularly caters to army-building collectors, providing a handful of soldiers for both sides of the three-year Clone Wars set between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.

Keeping that in mind, collectors buying duplicates of this LEGO set is almost a certainty, so it wouldn&#39;t be all that surprising if the battle pack gets put on backorder in the near future. Although the 3 other builds could have been sacrificed to perhaps make a more detailed tri-droid, LEGO&#39;s Clone Trooper &amp; Battle Droid Battle Pack (75372) is most definitely a worthwhile purchase overall, providing a substantial amount of updated Star Wars minifigures for the $30 price tag.
