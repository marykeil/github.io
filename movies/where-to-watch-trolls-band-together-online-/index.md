## Literature Review

Trolls 3, the latest installment of the movie franchise, released in theaters on November 17, 2023. Here&#39;s where to watch Trolls Band Together online.




Trolls Band Together, or Trolls 3, is the latest Trolls movie, and fans of the franchise are sure to wonder how to watch the new animated feature. Camila Cabello, Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, and RuPaul are among Trolls 3&#39;s star-studded cast giving life to these iconic characters&#39; latest adventure. The movie focuses on one of Branch&#39;s (Timberlake) brothers getting kidnapped and both Branch and Poppy (Kendrick) embarking on an adventure to save him. The Trolls franchise has had varying success at the box office, with the original 2016 film making nearly three times its budget whereas the sequel Trolls World Tour failed to make back half of its budget.




So, Trolls 3 was never going to be a guaranteed hit, yet the movie has grossed $199 million at the box office after it premiered in theaters on November 17th, 2023, via Box Office Mojo. The film has a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and while there is nothing particularly revolutionary about the story or characters, Trolls Band Together still has an excellent soundtrack that makes this franchise a much more engaging watch than some other children&#39;s animated movies. For fans of the movies and parents with children pining for the latest entry in the franchise, Trolls Band Together is available on plenty of platforms.

Trolls Band Together will be released on Peacock, likely in March 2024, though that date is not certain yet, via Decider. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish and Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken are some of DreamWorks Animation&#39;s recent releases that hit streaming around three to four months after their release. This gave the projects time to make money during their theatrical run before cashing in by distributing them to other platforms.



Trolls Band Together is currently playing in theaters as well as available for digital purchase.







Trolls Band Together seems like it will follow the same pattern, making March an expected release date for the movie to hit streaming. As part of a deal with Netflix, Universal&#39;s animated DreamWorks films will first stream on Peacock for a four-month window before leaving the platform and heading to Netflix. So, users subscribed to that service looking to hear their favorite singers and musicians in Trolls Band Together won&#39;t have to wait long.
