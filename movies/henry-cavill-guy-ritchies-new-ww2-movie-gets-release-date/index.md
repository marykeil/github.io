## Literature Review

Henry Cavill and Guy Ritchie’s anticipated new World War 2 action movie, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, now finally has a release date.




The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, Henry Cavill&#39;s new collaboration with Guy Ritchie, now has an official release date. Based on a book of the same name by Damien Lewis, the upcoming film chronicles the birth of Britain&#39;s first special forces team and their mission to strike blows against the Nazis behind enemy lines. The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare marks the second collaboration between Cavill and Ritchie after 2015&#39;s The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and was previously expected to bow at some point in 2024.




Now, Lionsgate (via Deadline) has announced that The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&#39;s release date is officially set for April 19. No trailer has been released just yet, but with the film hitting theaters in about three months, one is sure to release in the coming weeks.

  


 What To Expect From The Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare 
          

According to Deadline&#39;s report, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is being billed as an action comedy. This is in line with many of Ritchie&#39;s past movies, with the British filmmaker responsible for the likes of Snatch, The Gentleman, and Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre, all of which blend scenes of fairly graphic violence with clever, humorous dialogue.




The official synopsis for the project, also revealed by Deadline, states that the film is based on files from the British War Department that were recently declassified. The British special forces organization is said to have been devised by former Prime Minister Winston Churchill and James Bond author Ian Fleming, among other military officials. The plot will involve this &#34;motley crew of rogues and mavericks&#34; fighting the Nazis using unconventional combat tactics and techniques, with their actions laying the groundwork for the birth of the British SAS.



While a trailer has yet to be released, Cavill took to Instagram last April to share a behind-the-scenes look at The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare, which you can check out below:





 




In addition to Cavill, the Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare cast includes Alan Ritchson, Henry Golding, Eiza González, Cary Elwes, Alex Pettyfer, Freddie Fox, Hero Fiennes Tiffin, Til Schweiger, and Babs Olusanmokun, among others. It&#39;s currently unclear if the film will set up a sequel or if it&#39;s intended to serve as a one-off, but Cavill will evidently be quite busy over the next few years as he works to bring his Warhammer 40K adaptation to life, meaning if a sequel to The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare does get the green light, it could be a ways off.
