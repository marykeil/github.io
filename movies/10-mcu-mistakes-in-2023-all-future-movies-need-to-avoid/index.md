## Literature Review

It has been an uneven year for the MCU on the big and small screens, but each misstep provides a valuable lesson for Marvel&#39;s media future.




2023 was a real mixed bag for the MCU, with some of its best work marred by historic flops and sub-par productions - but at the very least, myriad lessons can be learned from the mistakes made. With the DCEU now set for a revamp with 2025&#39;s DCU, the MCU is under added pressure to ensure that the continuity that it has planned for over the next several years springs back from the slump it has recently found itself in. As Deadpool 3 holds the fort in 2024, helping to assuage superhero fatigue by reducing the typically prolific output to one.
In that downtime, Marvel has an opportunity to reflect on the ups and downs of 2023 and implement the lessons learned in future MCU releases. Although the tail-end of the year was marred by the very public flop of The Marvels, the positives of Loki and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 both carry lessons that should be replicated. While the fate of the MCU is far from written in stone, these are the mistakes that the MCU should avoid in the future.
            
 
 All 8 MCU 2023 Releases, Ranked Worst To Best 
In a challenging year for comic book movies and TV shows, Marvel still had some soaring highs. Here&#39;s how every MCU release of the year ranks.












 








 10  The MCU Should Spotlight Its New Heroes 
The Marvels
        

One of the pitfalls for The Marvels was the lack of familiarity in its starring characters. Neither Ms. Marvel nor Monica Rambeau featured in the MCU outside of Disney Plus shows, which may have precluded casual viewers from becoming invested in them ahead of the movie&#39;s release, something which Captain Marvel alone could not counteract. From this point, the MCU should give as much attention as possible, be it in other movies or promotional materials, to ensure that they are a central part of the MCU zeitgeist.





 9  The MCU Needs To Start Teasing The Next Avengers 
Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantummania
        

Despite being halfway through MCU Phase 5, there has been no Avengers movie since Avengers: Endgame, which means there has been little recourse for the MCU to tease the climax of the Multiverse Saga. Additionally, the presumed big bad of the Multiverse Saga, Kang the Conqueror, has been seen only once in a cinematic outing. 2023 has seen more new heroes introduced to the MCU than ever before. Yet, there has been little reason for them to team up thus far, which is something that future MCU installments need to start addressing if Marvel intends to shore up enthusiasm.





 8  MCU Shows Need Showrunners 
Secret Invasion
        

Between Secret Invasion and Loki Season 2, the MCU has sat on two opposite ends of the scale with its streaming shows in 2023. Despite the likes of Loki, Ms. Marvel, and WandaVision proving that the current format for producing TV shows can work, the production woes of Secret Invasion and She-Hulk helped prove that the oversight of a showrunner can be invaluable. The MCU has already announced that the upcoming Daredevil: Born Again series will be made with showrunners, proving that this lesson may have already been learned.





 7  The MCU Needs To Make Kang A Real Threat 
Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantummania
        

Despite Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania being the first movie to showcase Kang the Conqueror in earnest, the movie fumbled the ball by having him be summarily defeated by arguably one of the MCU&#39;s weakest heroes. In stark contrast to Thanos, who is theorized to have waited until Odin died before making his move against the entirety of Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes, Kang&#39;s appearances so far have been quashed by individuals far less powerful than the late King of Asgard. As a result, Kang feels like much less of a threat, and the MCU is running out of time to spotlight exactly what makes him more threatening than his villainous predecessor.





 6  Marvel Needs To Keep Their Big Reveals Secret 
The Marvels
        

In a scramble to bring audiences to theaters, the big post-credits reveal in The Marvels was all but spoiled in the final trailers for the movie. As a result, the arrival of Kelsey Grammar&#39;s Beast lost its luster, marring the big reveal that should have sparked excitable reactions akin to those in response to the arrival of Sony&#39;s Spider-Man actors in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Marvel isn&#39;t incapable of keeping secrets under wraps, being among the biggest culprits for editing trailer footage to ensure moments like Hulk&#39;s omission from the Battle of Wakanda are as surprising as they can and should be.





 5  Marvel Needs to Streamline Their Movies 
The Marvels


 







One of the many highlights of The Marvels was its digestible runtime, allowing it to tell a compelling story without feeling overstuffed and something that Marvel could stand to replicate in future endeavors. A factor in the superhero fatigue that appears to be plaguing Marvel and DC alike is the inordinate run-times of each studio&#39;s biggest movies - a criticism that could, conversely, be leveled at Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 with its 2.5-hour runtime. The Marvels proved that MCU stories can be suitably and enjoyably told within shorter time frames, making the movie more palatable to casual viewers.





 4  The MCU Needs To Up The Stakes 
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3
        

While Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 was a nail-biting finale to the trilogy for many reasons, the near-death of Rocket being circumvented in the nick of time was among the most compelling plots in MCU history. The movie would have been made all the more effective, however, if Quill had sacrificed his own life by the end of the movie. Aside from Avengers: Endgame, which is beloved so widely in part for its depiction of how high the stakes can be, the plot armor being afforded some longstanding heroes is becoming more and more obvious and less necessary.





 3  The MCU Should Go Darker 
Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3


 







While the DCEU suffered for its dark tones in stark contrast to the lightheartedness of the MCU, movies like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 have proved that its best installments can still dip a toe into darker themes without repelling audiences. One of the main criticisms of movies like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania and Thor: Love and Thunder is the MCU&#39;s over-reliance on comedy, diminishing heavier themes with mistimed jokes. Meanwhile, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 developed the harrowing backstory of Rocket while introducing the amusingly naive Adam Warlock, proving that dark themes can be tactfully explored.





 2  The MCU Needs To Finish More Character Arcs 
Loki Season 2


 







Several of the MCU&#39;s older characters are still pulling the limelight away from its new cast, for whom there should be greater attention. Loki Season 2 proved that a mainstay fan-favorite like the Asgardian anti-hero can be concluded without needing to kill them off. Characters like Loki&#39;s brother, Thor, and Hulk are long overdue a swansong worthy of their legacy, allowing them to follow in the footsteps of their fellow founding members. In doing so, their departure would open the door for new Avengers leaders to take a new team into the climactic fray.





 1  The MCU Needs To Rein In Its Budgets 
The Marvels &amp; Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantummania
        

With a budget of around $275 million, The Marvels was one of the MCU&#39;s most expensive movies, which is arguably a risk that the studio did not need to take. The Marvels sits only behind Avengers movies in terms of budget and was even more expensive to make than The Avengers. The movie that became the MCU&#39;s biggest flop was unnecessarily expensive and made the extremely public loss a lot harder to brush under the rug. While it undoubtedly showcases stunning visuals, the movie hardly holds a candle to the big-budget spectacles of the latest Avengers movies, suggesting that it could have been made far more cheaply.
