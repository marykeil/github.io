## Literature Review

The new drama The Iron Claw, starring Zac Efron, Jeremy Allen White, and Harris Dickinson, passes a major milestone milestone for an R-rated movie.




The Iron Claw has scored an important achievement for an R-rated movie. The new A24 drama, which was written and directed by Sean Durkin, follows the steep rise and tragic fall of the wrestling dynasty of the Von Erich brothers in the 1980s. The cast includes Zac Efron as Kevin Von Erich, Jeremy Allen White as Kerry Von Erich, and Harris Dickinson as David Von Erich, alongside Maura Tierney, Lily James, Stanley Simons, and Holt McCallany.




Per Variety, the Iron Claw release has reached a total of $24.3 million at the domestic box office by the end of its third weekend in theaters. This makes it a rare R-rated movie to cross the $20 million milestone in North America. It is also the third R-rated movie put out by A24 in 2023 to pass that benchmark, after the horror movie Talk to Me ($48.3 million) and Sofia Coppola&#39;s Priscilla Presley biopic Priscilla ($20.9 million), which it has already surpassed.


 How The Iron Claw Compares To Other 2023 Hits 
          

Ultimately, The Iron Claw is relatively low on the year&#39;s overall domestic chart. Roughly 75 movies from 2023 have passed the $20 million milestone, ranging from The Pope&#39;s Exorcist ($20 million) to the smash hit Barbie ($636.3 million), and The Iron Claw could very well land below the Top 50 by the end of its run. However, on the scale of an R-rated movie, its prospects are much brighter.




The tragic The Iron Claw ending hasn&#39;t dissuaded audiences from checking the movie out, as it is one of just 23 out of more than 100 R-rated releases to pass this milestone in 2023. It has already surpassed earlier titles, including Strays ($23.9 million), The Holdovers ($18.2 million), and Renfield ($17.3 million). See how it ranks compared to the Top 5 R-rated 2023 movies below:

 Overall Rank  Title  Domestic Gross   5  Oppenheimer  $326.1 million   9  John Wick: Chapter 4  $187.1 million   23  Scream VI  $108.1 million   28  The Equalizer 3  $92.4 million   29  The Nun II  $86.3 million   TBD  The Iron Claw  $24.3 million (so far)   



The movie is also performing well on the scale of an original movie. Many of the R-rated hits of the year are IP-driven titles in existing franchises, but the Iron Claw&#39;s true story is driving more ticket sales than many other similar titles from the year. In fact, it is jockeying with the R-rated rom-com Anyone But You to enter the chart of the Top 10 original R-rated movies of 2023, though it will likely land at No. 11 behind that title, which is showing strong week-on-week growth.
