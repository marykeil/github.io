# Why Donnie Yens First John Wick 4 Action Scene Is So Perfect Detailed By Stuntmen


## SUMMARY 



  Corridor Crew VFX artists and stuntman Gui DaSilva-Greene react to Yen&#39;s first fight scene as Caine in John Wick: Chapter 4, praising the actor&#39;s speed and style.   The fight is choreographed to Yen&#39;s strengths, and it includes some of the actor&#39;s moves from previous martial arts movies.   Caine is one of the most memorable supporting characters in the franchise, and he seems ripe for further exploration in his own spinoff movie or TV show.

## Literature Review
Stuntment react to Donnie Yenâ€™s big John Wick: Chapter 4 kitchen action scene as Caine, explaining why the fight sequence is so effective.




Donnie Yen&#39;s John Wick: Chapter 4 fight gets high marks from a stuntman, who explains why the scene works so well. After three previous installments, Keanu Reeves returns as the titular assassin for Chad Stahelski&#39;s fourth entry in the popular action franchise, doing battle against the High Table as his quest for freedom continues. The John Wick: Chapter 4 cast includes a number of newcomers, including Yen as Caine, a blind assassin who was once Wick&#39;s friend.




Now, on a new episode of their &#34;Stuntmen React&#34; series, Corridor Crew VFX artists Niko Pueringer and Wren Weichman are joined by stuntman Gui DaSilva-Greene to break down why Yen&#39;s first John Wick: Chapter 4 fight works so well.


 

After praising Yen&#39;s sheer speed as a performer, even at 60 years old, Pueringer points out that Caine&#39;s speed is accentuated by Yen doing &#34;small movements and the stunt guns are really selling the hits&#34;. Other moments that take the fight to the next level include Yen&#39;s &#34;ax kick,&#34; which DaSilva-Greene describes as an &#34;exclamation mark similar to Bruce [Lee&#39;s] stomp.&#34; The fight also includes many signature moves from Yen&#39;s career as a martial artist, including the &#34;rapid fire punches&#34; seen in the Ip Man franchise. Crucially, DaSilva-Greene explains, the fight represents an example of &#34;choreographing to your actor&#34;. 





 How Caine Can Return In The John Wick Franchise 
          

While Reeves&#39; assassin has always been the main character, the John Wick franchise continues to excel due to its memorable supporting players. Caine is perhaps the most memorable supporting character introduced to date, and he feels ripe for further exploration. Even though the John Wick: Chapter 4 post-credits scene hints that Caine dies at the hands of Akira (Rina Sawayama), there are other ways for the franchise to bring Yen&#39;s character back.

If Caine were to get his own John Wick spinoff movie, it could take place before the events of the most recent sequel. The story could explore how Yen&#39;s Caine became blind or chronicle exactly how he was able to &#34;retire&#34; himself from the franchise&#39;s assassin network (before he ultimately gets pulled back in, of course).






In an interview with Screen Rant, franchise director Chad Stahelski hinted that John Wick TV shows could flesh out characters from the films, and he cites Akira, Caine, Laurence Fishburne&#39;s Bowery King, and Halle Berry&#39;s Sofia as potential candidates.




Or, it&#39;s entirely possible that Caine survives the attempt on his life at the end of John Wick: Chapter 4, and a follow-up could see him and Akira facing off as she seeks revenge for the death of her father. Alternatively, with John Wick 5 is currently in development (though not yet officially confirmed), Yen could somehow be incorporated into the continuation of Reeves&#39; character&#39;s story. However it happens, Caine evidently made a big impression on viewers and should absolutely return.
