Summary

  New Instagram art from @ry.f1reart shows a painted rendition of a pivotal Oliver scene from Saltburn.    Saltburn has received both praise and controversy over the course of its run.   Through the use of color, the art displays Saltburn&#39;s disconcerting and unique tone impressively well.  







New Saltburn-inspired art recreates a key scene before one of Oliver’s darkest moments. Starring Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Richard E. Grant, Carey Mulligan, and Rosamund Pike, the Emerald Fennell-directed movie has become one of the most talked-about titles of 2023. Saltburn has received largely positive reviews and has done relatively well so far on the awards circuit, including multiple Golden Globe nominations (though it won none).

Now, Saltburn art from @ry.f1reart renders a dreamy version of a key Oliver moment from the film. In the image, the artist offers an impressionistic painting of Oliver as he walks into the center of the Saltburn hedge maze.


 

Sporting his deer antlers, Oliver is seen in silhouette in the image. The background features twinkling lights as a spark of warm color within the painting’s otherwise dark, cool color palette. The artist captioned their post with, “As soon as I saw this scene, I knew I had to paint it.”





 Why This Scene In Saltburn Is So Critical 
         

Right after this moment in Saltburn, Oliver approaches Felix in the center of the hedge maze. From there, the two share a drunken interaction, wherein Felix criticizes Oliver for his lies and deceptions, and drink together. Felix downs his drink whereas Oliver ends up vomiting his recently-consumed libations.

This scene is crucial as it ends up being the last interaction between Felix and Oliver while Felix is alive. After this party, Felix is found dead, and it is later revealed that his death is a result of Oliver’s intentional poisoning of his drink, and his puking episode was part of a calculated plan to imply the drink’s safety while saving himself. Part of what makes this final interaction so eerie and unique is the outlandishness of their dress, for they remain clad in their party gear of wings for Felix and deer antlers for Oliver.




The above art captures the simultaneous allure and danger present in the moments leading up to this scene. Before the Saltburn ending, Oliver’s interaction with the party seems to be one of exploration, as he marvels (and balks) at the lavishness that surrounds him. Retrospectively, it seems far more menacing as Oliver sneakily approaches Felix, knowing he’s about to murder him. Using a cool color palette and minimal detail, the artist renders this malevolent ambiguity well, paying great homage to the tonal uniqueness of Saltburn.
