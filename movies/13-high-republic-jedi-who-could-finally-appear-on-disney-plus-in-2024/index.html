<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>With many stories set in the High Republic era of Star Wars soon coming to Disney Plus, many fan favorite Jedi could be coming to the small screen.</p>
<p>With a new year comes new Star Wars content, and there are many different High Republic era Jedi that could find themselves on Disney+ in 2024. The upcoming live-action television series The Acolyte is on the horizon, as well as Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures season 2, which has already introduced characters from the novels and comics to the small screen. Because of this, there is a guarantee that more Jedi are likely on the way.
Taking place between the Old Republic era and the Fall of the Jedi detailed in the prequel trilogy, the High Republic publishing initiative has introduced many new Jedi to the Star Wars franchise. This time period has spawned many novels and comics, each with characters that have become incredibly popular in their own right. With the era being explored even more in television series on Disney+, it is more than likely that fans will have the opportunity to see some of these characters in the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Upcoming Star Wars Shows: Story, Casts &amp; Everything We Know
Several exciting Star Wars TV shows are set to be released on Disney+ in the coming years from the realm of both live-action and animation.</p>
<p>13  The Jedi Council&rsquo;s Model Student
Stellan Gios</p>
<p>Playing a large part in The High Republic novels, Stellan Gios was the model Jedi. When learning to become a Jedi, Stellan became close with fellow Padawans Elzar Mann and Avar Kris, both of whom he would grow up with as they became fully fledged Jedi. During the time his friends were stationed at Starlight Beacon, Stellan Gios was serving as a member of the Jedi Council, showing both his strength as a Jedi as well as his matching set of ideals to that of the Council. Young Jedi Adventures&rsquo; visit to Starlight Beacon may see Stellan&rsquo;s animated debut.</p>
<p>12  The Jedi Knight With A Dangerous Warning
Elzar Mann</p>
<p>Despite the fact he remained a Jedi Knight for a very long time as opposed to being permitted to ascend to the rank of Jedi Master, Elzar Mann was a powerful Jedi that rediscovered once forgotten Force techniques through his experiments with the Force. Though once close friends with both Stellan Gios and Avar Kriss, Elzar began to distance himself from them after receiving a Force vision that warned of the impending deaths of thousands. This eventually came true, as the Nihil attacked and devastated the planet of Valo. Elzar may also appear in Young Jedi Adventures at Starlight Beacon.</p>
<p>11  Diplomatic Padawan &amp; Loyal Friend
Farzala Tarabal</p>
<p>Once a Padawan that trained under Yoda and Toran Buck on the academic cruiser Star Hopper, Farzala Tarabal also spent a great deal of time on the fringes of the galaxy. He participated in many battles against the Nihil during his time as a Padawan, a ruthless enemy seen throughout The High Republic Adventures series. Not only was he a skilled fighter, but Farzala was also a competent diplomat as well.</p>
<p>10  The Jedi Who Would Keep Starlight Beacon Running
Estala Maru</p>
<p>Estala Maru has actually already made a brief appearance on Disney+, showing up in the episode of Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures titled “Stuck in the Muck.” He is a Kessurian Jedi Master who is best known as the eventual head of operations on the Starlight Beacon. Though he has not been confirmed for season 2, it is more than likely that he will once again make an appearance.</p>
<p>9  Mirialan Prodigy &amp; Young Jedi Knight
Vernestra Rwoh</p>
<p>Becoming a Jedi Knight at the young age of 15, Vernestra Rwoh was one of the youngest to graduate from Padawan to Jedi Knight. She was trained by Stellan Gios, and on her way to the Starlight Beacon, her ship was attacked, leaving her and her traveling party stranded on Wevo. She would eventually take Imri Cantros, who had been stranded with her, as her Padawan. Vernestra is confirmed to appear in The Acolyte live-action TV show later this year.</p>
<p>30 Most Powerful Jedi In Star Wars, Officially Ranked Weakest To Strongest
Fans have followed a lot of Jedi through the expansive Star Wars universe but which among them can be considered the strongest?</p>
<p>8  The Aloxian Padawan Who Was Found By Maz Kanata
Qort</p>
<p>Qort was a child of the warrior Aloxian species, raised by Maz Kanata who, along with Yoda, eventually brought him to the Jedi. For most of his life, he wore the skull of a vonduun crab on his head, as this was a part of Aloxian culture - only showing his true face once the skull was broken in a battle against the Nihil. He spent time on Starlight Beacon, fought both Nihil and Nameless, and was soon knighted once the Starlight Beacon was destroyed. He may appear on Starlight Beacon in Young Jedi Adventures.</p>
<p>7  Loving Padawan, Faithful Ally
Lula Talisola</p>
<p>Best friend to fellow Padawans Farzala Tarabal and Qort, Lula Talisola trained on the Star Hopper until she and the others were called upon to fight the Nihil. During this time, she and the others rescued the Force-sensitive Zeen Mrala, who Lula would go on to forge a loving relationship with. When presented with the offer of knighthood in the Jedi Order, Lula declined, realizing that her love for Zeen was much more important than a life without attachment.</p>
<p>6  The Jedi Council Member With A Unique Sith Lightsaber
Jora Malli</p>
<p>Master of Padawan Reath Silas and leader of the Jedi on Starlight Beacon, Jora Malli was a Togruta Jedi Master and member of the Jedi Council. She was known for her unique lightsaber, which had a white blade created by a purified Sith kyber crystal. Before she had the chance to truly serve on the Starlight Beacon she was killed in battle, dying in the Battle of Kur against the Nihil.</p>
<p>5  Jedi Master &amp; Savior, The Blade Of Bardotta
Porter Engle</p>
<p>Also known as the Blade of Bardotta for his defense of the Bethunian people and breaking the siege on the city of Bardotta, Porter Engle was a legendary combatant capable of repelling multiple opponents and heavy cannons on his own. He, along with Jedi Barash Sylvain, spent much time fighting on the frontier and protecting Jedi outposts on the edge of the galaxy. Not only was Porter Engle capable of great feats as a powerful Jedi, but he was a great cook as well, making him a unique case for a Jedi Master.</p>
<p>4  A Jedi Who Returned To The Order
Kantam Sy</p>
<p>As a young Padawan in the Jedi Order, Kantam Sy was a unique case, as they were permitted to spend time away from the Order by their master, Grand Master Yoda, to experience the galaxy and everything it had to offer. During this time, they rescued Lula Talisola on Naboo when they were working as a courier between Naboo and Alderaan. When they realized that she was Force-sensitive, Kantam Sy brought Lula back to the Jedi. They were knighted when they returned to the Order, and Lula would eventually go on to become their Padawan.</p>
<p>How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.</p>
<p>3  Legendary Jedi Cracking Under Pressure
Avar Kriss</p>
<p>Serving as a leading member of the Starlight Beacon along with many of her closest allies, Avar Kriss was a powerful Jedi with many successful operations to her name. She successfully helped with the Great Hyperspace Disaster and the Drengir crisis, but was overwhelmed when the Nihil began to attack. During this time, she began indulging her anger, going so far as to attempt to execute one of the members of the Nihil, Lourna Dee, much to the horror of those surrounding her. Avar could appear in either Young Jedi Adventures on Starlight Beacon, or even in The Acolyte.</p>
<p>2  Squid Games Star Joins The Acolyte Cast
Lee Jung-Jae&rsquo;s Jedi</p>
<p>Although not much is known about the famous Squid Games actor&rsquo;s role in the upcoming series The Acolyte, it has been confirmed that Lee Jung-Jae will be playing the role of a Jedi. Whether he will be a new Jedi or a returning one, either from the novels or the comics, has yet to be confirmed. However, whether or not his character ends up being the wise Jedi Master alluded to in promotional material released for the show, his performance is sure to be one of the series&rsquo; highlights.</p>
<p>1  The Acolyte&rsquo;s Main Lead &amp; Potential Dark Side Apprentice
Amandla Stenberg&rsquo;s Former Padawan</p>
<p>There have been many theories as to who Amandla Stenberg might be playing or what role her character will fill in the upcoming show The Acolyte. Many have speculated that she could be playing a character that is involved with the dark side in one way or form, as it is unclear whether Stenberg&rsquo;s character is actually still a Jedi. With so many questions left for Star Wars to answer and an entire era to explore in doing so, it is inevitable that her appearance will shake up the franchise formula.</p>
