## Literature Review

Disney movies may be family-friendly but the release of The Little Mermaid caused controversy with its suggestive imagery on the VHS cover.




The Little Mermaid banned cover for its initial VHS release in 1989 has a notorious legacy, and is one of many occasions where supposed adult imagery has found its way into family-friendly entertainment. Credited with starting the Disney Renaissance, The Little Mermaid stars the fourth Disney Princess, Ariel, and follows her quest to be part of the human world. The Little Mermaid was a huge success and two movies followed, The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea and The Little Mermaid: Ariel’s Beginning. Ariel’s life has even been shown in a TV series in 1992, also titled The Little Mermaid, which is set at an unspecified time before the original movie.




Along with becoming a must-needed box office hit for Disney, The Little Mermaid was also a hit on home video with the classic VHS cases becoming a collector&#39;s item over the years. However, even rarer is the original VHS cover for the family-friendly movie that was quickly banned thanks to some suggestive artwork — a minor detail that caused such a stir that future copies were released with a new sleeve. While some think the rumors of this controversial Little Mermaid cover were just an urban legend, it has been confirmed that Disney took steps to ensure the original artwork was no longer available due to a shocking discovery that came too late.

The Little Mermaid was released on VHS after its success in theaters with new artwork created for the cover. The artwork depicts Ariel, Eric, Ursula, and King Triton in front of Triton’s castle. Triton’s castle takes center stage with its gold, sparkling spires and is being used to stop an angry Ursula and Triton from getting to a loved-up Ariel and Eric. The image seems innocent enough at first, but a closer look reveals King Triton’s castle seems to contain some inappropriate imagery.

The VHS cover received backlash because the spires on King Triton’s castle contained phallic imagery. In short, one of the spires on Trident&#39;s castle looked like a penis. With the castle being the center of the image, it did not take long for audiences to call Disney out for the phallus and the VHS cover was recalled and replaced. The phallic imagery on a children’s movie cover caused a lot of controversy and many people believed Disney put the image there on purpose.

 Was The Little Mermaid&#39;s Controversial VHS Cover Intentional? 
Disney Has Included Subtle Adult Humor In Movies Before
         

It is highly unlikely that Disney purposely made the controversial banned The Little Mermaid VHS cover. The Little Mermaid was extremely successful in cinemas and would not need any extra help from Disney to get audiences talking about the movie. Plus, it only looks rude once the phallic imagery is circled and pointed out — otherwise, it would have blended in just fine with the rest of Triton’s castle. Disney has a strong reputation for its family-friendly movies so including the imagery purposefully would be a big risk for them, especially as The Little Mermaid was its first majorly successful movie for a long time.

However, rumors still circulated about the VHS cover being intentional, with some believing an angry artist who was about to be fired added it before their departure. Intentional or not, The Little Mermaid became the highest-selling VHS of 1990 and the use of phallic imagery has become part of an ongoing Disney narrative. Disney loves an Easter egg, but there is also a narrative that Disney animators purposely slip rude Easter eggs into their movies. These include Buzz’s “erection” in Toy Story 2, when his suit wings fly up, and the “Size doesn’t matter” joke in Frozen.

 Triton&#39;s Castle Wasn&#39;t The Little Mermaid&#39;s Only Phallic Controversy 
Disney Was Forced To Remove Another Controversial Image Within The Movie Itself
          

Triton’s castle was not the only phallic controversy in The Little Mermaid. In addition to the banned VHS cover, Disney had to cut some original frames from The Little Mermaid that appeared to show one of the characters with an erection. During Eric’s marriage to Ursula in disguise, their officiant is standing on a step and reading the order of the ceremony. When saying “dearly beloved”, it looks as if something pops up between his robes. The scene was so controversial that a lawsuit was filed against Disney as a viewer attempted to sue them in 1995.




Although the moment in the scene is detectable at regular speed, it is only when the scene is in slow motion that the phallic imagery is more noticeable. Disney revealed the supposed erection is actually the officiant&#39;s knee, which makes way more sense as he is bouncing up and down as he speaks. The lawsuit was dropped against Disney, but the controversial scene was edited so the officiant&#39;s supposed knee has been smoothed over.

It is almost certain that these two moments were not intentional by Disney, especially so early on in the company&#39;s success, but The Little Mermaid will always be tied to these phallic controversies and Disney’s sneaky suggestive Easter eggs will likely continue.
