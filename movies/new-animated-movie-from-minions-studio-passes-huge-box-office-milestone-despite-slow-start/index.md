## Literature Review

Illumination Entertainment, the studio behind the Minions franchise, sees their slow-starting new release pass a huge box office milestone worldwide.




Migration has passed a huge milestone at the box office despite a slow start. The new animated movie from Illumination, which stars Kumail Nanjiani, Elizabeth Banks, Keegan-Michael Key, Awkwafina, and Danny DeVito, follows a family of ducks whose vacation plans are derailed when they end up stuck in New York City. The movie premiered to $12.5 million over Christmas weekend 2023, the lowest opening gross in the company&#39;s history.




Per Collider, the Migration release has now passed the $150 million milestone during its third weekend at the worldwide box office. This comes from a roughly even split between its domestic take of $77 million and its international gross of $73 million. Crossing this milestone likely means that any money it makes from this point on will be profit, as the estimated break-even point for a movie with its reported $72 million budget is roughly $144 million.


 Will Migration Be The Beginning Of A New Franchise? 
          

The Migration movie’s slow-boil success has turned around a seeming disappointment for Illumination, which was flying high in early 2023. In April, they released The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which became the second highest-grossing movie of the year by reaching a whopping worldwide total of $1.36 billion. While Migration almost certainly won’t be able to muster that kind of commercial appeal, it now seems entirely possible that it could earn a sequel.






The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the third Illumination title to gross over $1 billion, after Minions and Despicable Me 3.




So far, Illumination’s commercial success has been built on the back of various animated franchises. The Despicable Me movies and their Minions spinoffs have been the cornerstone of their lineup, but other franchises they have put out include The Secret Life of Pets and Sing. While the sequel The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 has yet to be greenlit, it also seems entirely likely that there will be an expanded Mario franchise coming soon.

Whether Migration kicks off its own run of sequels likely depends on how high a gross it can attain by the end of its time in theaters. However, Sing 3 is already in development despite Sing 2 grossing over $200 million less than its predecessor. Given that precedent, the company may be interested in investing in franchises that don’t necessarily show promise right away, something that could work in the new movie’s favor.
