## Literature Review

Following a major casting announcement for Marvel&#39;s Thunderbolts, the unrevealed cast of Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four seems even more unusual.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe will finally introduce its version of Marvel’s first family in Marvel’s Fantastic Four, but the movie’s cast has not yet been announced, something that is made far stranger by the recent casting shakeup in Marvel’s Thunderbolts. The Fantastic Four is one of Marvel’s most iconic properties, breathing new life into the original Marvel Universe in their 1961 debut, so their debut in the MCU timeline is, understandably, highly anticipated. Amid release date rearrangements, Fantastic Four will now release before Thunderbolts.




Thunderbolts will center on a team of anti-heroes, with the forthcoming film being popularly compared to DC’s Suicide Squad. The MCU’s roster contains several established characters, all of whom could be considered reformed supervillains, or at least morally gray. In late 2023, it was further revealed that Sentry would make his MCU debut in the film, played by Steven Yeun, though a January 2024 report would reveal that Yeun has departed from the Sentry role, making a recast likely but as of yet unannounced.

                  Everything We Know About Marvel&#39;s Fantastic Four Reboot   The MCU is bringing a new version of the Fantastic Four as part of its Multiverse Saga, and here&#39;s what you need to know about this reboot.   


 Thunderbolts Cast Is Much More Established Than Fantastic Four Despite Releasing Later 
          




As of now, Thunderbolts is set to release over two months after Fantastic Four, despite featuring a far more familiar cast. Moreover, with both the initial news of Steven Yeun as Sentry and the recent announcement of his departure from the role, another announcement that reveals his replacement may be made before long. Considering that Fantastic Four is set to come out before Thunderbolts, however, the lack of a casting announcement for the Fantastic Four movie is all the more conspicuous.

                  Marvel Has Waited Too Long To Introduce The Fantastic Four   Marvel Studios has potentially waited too long to introduce the Fantastic Four, as there&#39;s now an increased amount of pressure to get it right.   



 What&#39;s Going On With The Fantastic Four Cast? 
          

In a way, the onscreen debut of the MCU’s Fantastic Four came in 2022’s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which featured John Krasinski as an alternate universe version of Reed Richards. Krasinski was a popular hypothetical choice among viewers, so his inclusion – even as a short-lived alternate universe iteration of Mr. Fantastic – finally canonizing this casting has led to hopes that he might return as the mainstream MCU timeline’s version. Krasinski himself later clarified that he likely will not return to the role, but this does leave some hope that he could play Reed Richards again.




More recently, there have been rumors that Pedro Pascal will play Reed Richards and Ebon Moss-Bachrach will be cast as Ben Grimm, with the latter – while a fitting choice – having already played David Lieberman (Microchip) in Marvel’s The Punisher. Rumors have also suggested that Sue Kirby and Emma Stone are being considered for the role of Sue Storm and Joseph Quinn may play Johnny Storm. It may not be long before these rumors are confirmed or debunked, considering that Marvel’s Fantastic Four is less than a year and a half away from release.
