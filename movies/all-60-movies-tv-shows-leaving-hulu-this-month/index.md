## Literature Review



Subscribers will have their last chance to catch several movies and TV shows leaving Hulu this month throughout various dates in January 2024. Hulu offers a large selection of TV shows and movies, and every month some of that content ends up leaving the streaming service. Launched in 2007, Hulu is one of the original major streaming services and one of the few to include unskippable ads during TV shows and movies at lower subscription tiers.




Hulu offers plenty of original movies and programming alongside its large library of network and Hollywood titles, yet it is always changing, meaning that not every piece of content will be there forever. January 2024 will see a number of notable titles leaving the streaming platform, some finding new homes elsewhere and others perhaps disappearing from the streaming world for now. With only a finite number of days left to enjoy many of the quality movies and TV shows on the platform, subscribers will want to keep an eye on everything leaving Hulu in January 2024.

Two Christmas Movies Are Leaving Hulu
          




  Christmas Child (2004)   Kirk Cameron&#39;s Saving Christmas (2014)  

As can be expected, many of the titles being removed from Hulu in January are Christmas movies. This includes the first two movies exiting the platform on January 3. Christmas Child is a movie about a reporter on the verge of divorce who begins looking for the biological family he never knew to save his current one before the holidays. Kirk Cameron’s Saving Christmas is also leaving Hulu with the controversial faith-based movie in which Cameron tries to reveal the religious importance of the holiday to his cynical brother-in-law. Both will be leaving Hulu a few days into January.

 January 10 
Hulu Is Removing A Dark Crime Thriller And A Buddy Action-Comedy
   Close     




  Before the Devil Knows You&#39;re Dead (2007)   Central Intelligence (2016)  

A dark crime story and a high-concept comedy are the departures on Hulu on January 10. Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead is the final movie from filmmaking legend Sidney Lumet and serves as a brilliant cap to an iconic career. It stars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke as brothers who attempt to escape their dire financial situation by robbing the jewelry store owned by their parents.

A much more lighthearted option is Central Intelligence which serves as the first movie in Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart’s successful partnership. Hart stars as a man who reunites with a former classmate (Johnson) who was bullied as a kid but is now a skilled international spy. It&#39;s among the best Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart movie, thoguh Hulu subscribers won&#39;t be able to view it after January 10.

Six Lesser-Known Movies Leave Hulu Two Weeks Into January
          




  Camp Nowhere (1994)   The Christmas Candle (2013)   Main Street (2010)   Serious Moonlight (2009)   Woman Thou Art Loosed (2004)   Zero Days (2016)  

There are several lesser-known movies being removed from Hulu on January 14 that span from the 1990s to the 2010s. Camp Nowhere is perhaps the most well-known title of the departures.

Another Christmas title will be leaving with the period drama The Christmas Candle, the drama Main Street starring Colin Firth and Orlando Bloom, the crime comedy Serious Moonlight starring Meg Ryan, the self-help adaptation Woman Thou Art Loosed, and the documentary Zero Days.

  The Quake (2018)  

Hulu will be losing the Norwegian disaster movie The Quake on January 17. A sequel to The Wave, the movie picks up with the hero of that first movie as he prepares and deals with a new disaster threatening to strike Oslo.

From there, the movie takes an unexpected and twisted turn that is best kept a secret until watching the wild movie. From the performances to the bold swings in tone to the disturbing themes of the story, Barbarian is a very memorable horror.

There are also a surprising number of disaster movies being removed from Hulu on this day which highlight the range of the genre.




There are some natural disaster survival stories like Posideon and Twister, movies about global threats like Armageddon and Pacific Rim, and even more grounded stories like Apollo 13 and Contagion. In a similar vein, there are also some monster movies, including Deep Blue Sea, Alien Vs. Predator, and two Godzilla titles which continue the trend of the iconic monster making a huge comeback. All are available for Hulu subscribers, but only until January 31.
