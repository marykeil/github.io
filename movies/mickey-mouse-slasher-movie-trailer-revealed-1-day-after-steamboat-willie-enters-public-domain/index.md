## Literature Review

A new trailer has been revealed for a Mickey Mouse based slasher horror film, just one day after Steamboat Willie entered the public domain.




A trailer for a Mickey Mouse-based slasher horror film titled Mickey’s Mouse Trap has been released. After having been copyrighted in 1928, the Steamboat Willie version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain on January 1, 2024. This news has left the internet and eager filmmakers scrambling to create Steamboat Willie based horror content.




Now, a trailer drops for a Steamboat Willie-based slasher horror film titled Mickey’s Mouse Trap from Simon Phillips.


 

After a character observes that “there is blood all over the jungle gym” of an arcade, the trailer switches scenes to showing a projector playing snippets of the classic Disney short Steamboat Willie. A sinister version of Mickey Mouse is soon revealed, with a warped head, as the mouse is turned into a killer. Along with the trailer, a synopsis of the film was revealed, reading:


It’s Alex’s 21st birthday, but she’s stuck at the amusement arcade on a late shift so her friends decide to surprise her, but a masked killer dressed as Mickey Mouse decides to play a game of his own with them which she must survive.






 Will 2024 Be the Battle of the Steamboat Willie Horror Films? 
          

Mickey’s Mouse Trap is directed by Jamie Bailey and stars a leading cast of Sophie McIntosh, Callum Sywyk, Allegra Nocita, Ben Harris, Damir Kovic, Mackenzie Mills, Nick Biskupek, and Simon Phillips. The horror adaptation has yet to announce a release date, but producers Paul Whitney, Mark Popejoy, Alexander Gausman, and Andrew Agopsowicz are aiming for a March 2024 release. The exact details of what Mickey’s Mouse Trap’s release plan will look like are yet to be seen.

Despite Steamboat Willie having been in the public domain for a single day, Mickey’s Mouse Trap is not the only horror film adaptation that has been announced. The Mean One director Steven LaMorte announced the development of his yet-untitled Steamboat Willie-based horror comedy. LaMorte’s version of Steamboat Willie is slated to begin production in the spring.

The announcement of Mickey’s Mouse Trap has now set up an interesting Steamboat Willie horror duel for 2024. With the release of the trailer, it seems that this slasher film is well into production, putting pressure on LaMorte’s Steamboat Willie film to make headway on filming. LaMorte and Bailey seem to have put forth very different concepts for their Steamboat Willie adaptations but nonetheless will be subject to comparison as both films likely hope for 2024 releases.
