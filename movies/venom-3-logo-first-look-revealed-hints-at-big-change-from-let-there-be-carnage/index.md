# Venom 3 Logo First Look Revealed &amp; Hints At Big Change From Let There Be Carnage


## SUMMARY 



  Venom 3&#39;s new logo features a red number 3 behind the franchise&#39;s logo, sparking speculation about its significance.   Some fans desire a subtitled official title or a pun like &#34;V3NOM&#34; to match the movie&#39;s humor.   The return of Carnage is uncertain, as Venom killed it in the previous movie, but the title may hold a hidden meaning related to other symbiotes.

## Literature Review

The new Venom Movie relies on a different visual choice as compared to the previous two instalments. 




Venom 3 has a new logo, and this time, it offers a different visual update on the symbiote-centric franchise. The Marvel movie is touted as Tom Hardy’s final appearance as Venom, as is evident from the actor describing the movie as Eddie Brock’s “last ride.” With Juno Temple and Chiwetel Ejiofor confirmed as the only actors cast in Venom 3 so far (apart from Hardy), not much is known about the plot of Venom 3. In the case of the title reveal of Venom: Let There Be Carnage, it was evident that Carnage would be the movie’s big villain. But with Venom 3’s simplistic title design, it’s difficult to ascertain the premise.




Instead of a subtitle like “Let There Be Carnage,” the Venom 3 title logo includes a red number 3 behind the Sony Pictures franchise’s logo. Revealed as a part of Sony Pictures’ lineup of upcoming projects at the CES 2024 (source: Discussing Film), the logo has divided the Internet with some social media users desiring a subtitled official title like the previous movie or a pun like “V3NOM” that would go well with the movie’s absurdist humor. It’s uncertain if the red 3 signifies the return of Carnage, considering that Venom bit its head off in the 2021 sequel. As the Venom comics have no shortage of symbiotes, the title might have a hidden meaning.


 

                  10 Most Powerful Unused Symbiotes That Could Appear In Venom 3   With Marvel&#39;s most powerful Symbiotes being central to the plot of Sony&#39;s Venom movies so far, there are still plenty that could eventually appear.   





 What The Venom 3 Logo Reveals About Tom Hardy&#39;s Next Marvel Movie 
         

While it’s not confirmed if Stephen Graham’s cop Patrick Mulligan will return in Venom 3 or not, Venom: Let There Be Carnage implied that he’s not dead but instead being controlled by another symbiote. This is made fairly clear in the scene where Mulligan’s eyes turn a bright, glowing blue. Given that Mulligan bonds with the Toxin symbiote in Marvel Comics, following up on that plot thread seems like a natural direction for Venom 3 to go with its villain.

                  Every Sony Spider-Man Universe Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe is still getting its footing in the superhero genre with three divisive movies. Here&#39;s how they rank against each another.   

Moreover, there&#39;s more reason Toxin seems like a natural fit for Venom 3. That symbiote, which, like Venom, bounces between hero and villain, is most commonly red, a physical characteristic that it inherited as an offspring of Carnage. The red 3 in the logo perhaps points to Toxin’s entry in Venom 3 as the new antagonist, both because of the color and because Toxin is a third-generation symbiote as it&#39;s birthed from Carnage, who is birthed from Venom.
