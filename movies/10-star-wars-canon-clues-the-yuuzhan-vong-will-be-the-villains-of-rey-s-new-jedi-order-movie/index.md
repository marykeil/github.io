## Literature Review

In recent Star Wars content, there have been possible hints that the Star Wars Legends threat, the Yuuzhan Vong, may be coming to Star Wars canon.




With the next Star Wars trilogy on the horizon led by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s Star Wars: New Jedi Order, many are speculating that the Yuuzhan Vong might be making their canon debut as the movies’ main villains. There have been many clues in recent canon content that suggest the Yuuzhan Vong, who first originated in Star Wars Legends, could be showing up in a big way. If this debut were to take place as a part of Rey’s upcoming Star Wars trilogy, this could mean big changes to the pattern of the franchise as a whole.
First identified as the Yuuzhan Vong in the novel The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime, this cruel extragalactic species has been terrorizing Star Wars Legendscontent since the nineties. During many of their featured stories, they have targeted Jedi, existing outside the Force and being their perfect thematic foil, all the while making the main Star Wars galaxy their mission of conquest. If they were to appear in canon via the upcoming trilogy, they would be a brutal enemy for any fledgling Jedi to defeat. Here are 10 clues this Legends species may be arriving to Star Wars canon in Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie.

 10  Star Wars Is Introducing The &#34;New Jedi Order&#34; Era 
The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime
        

Starting with The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime in what would have been the year 25 ABY, Star Wars Legends&#39; New Jedi Order era kicked off with the invasion of the Yuuzhan Vong. Not only does this era show an older version of the classic original Star Wars trilogy characters, but it also depicts the children of Leia Organa and Han Solo, characters who have since been replaced in canon by Ben Solo. Although the movies have already begun to reflect this period of time with Luke and his failed revitalization of the Jedi Order, Rey&#39;s trilogy and her version of the Order will be canon&#39;s real answer to the possibilities brought about in several Expanded Universe stories.

During this new generation in the Expanded Universe, or Legends, one of the most important villains the franchise&#39;s heroes faced was the Yuuzhan Vong. Luke Skywalker, along with his niece and nephews Jana, Jacen, and Anakin Solo, all took part in fighting back against the threat of the Yuuzhan Vong. In Star Wars canon, Rey is an important part of this new generation of Jedi, being one of the first, along with Ben Solo, and taking over in Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker after Luke Skywalker&#39;s and Ben Solo&#39;s deaths.

 8  Star Wars Is Increasingly Drawing On Legends For Inspiration 
Star Wars Rebels &amp; Ahsoka


 







There are many different elements of Star Wars Legends that have made it into Star Wars canon. The most famous of these introductions is that of Grand Admiral Thrawn, who began as a major part of Star Wars Legends and was eventually introduced as one of the main villains in later seasons of Star Wars Rebels. With his return to the galaxy in Ahsoka, it seems as though the franchise is gearing up to give Thrawn even more of a legacy than he had before. With such a major part of the Extended Universe making it to canon, it stands to reason the Yuuzhan Vong could as well.





 7  Dave Filoni Considered Introducing The Yuuzhan Vong In Clone Wars, Too 
Star Wars: The Clone Wars
        

When the series was still in production, there were many proposed arcs of The Clone Wars that never came to the screen. One such arc included the introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong. In this arc, the Yuuzhan Vong would have come all the way from their home galaxy to cause chaos during the Clone Wars. While this may not have fit for the animated series, it shows that Dave Filoni has an interest in the Yuuzhan Vong&#39;s potential in canon.





 6  Star Wars Has Gone Intergalactic At Last 
Peridea In Star Wars: Ahsoka


 







With the Ahsoka series concluding its first run on Disney&#43;, it has introduced a variety of new things to the franchise&#39;s canon. The greatest of these was the debut of the extragalactic planet Peridea, the planet that Ezra Bridger and Grand Admiral Thrawn landed on after being taken away by the purrgil in Star Wars Rebels. Not only is this the first time that Star Wars has gone extragalactic, but this is especially important regarding the Yuuzhan Vong. The Yuuzhan Vong species originates from another galaxy entirely, and now that the series has shown this sort of travel as a possibility, there is even more of a chance that they could make an appearance as villains in the future.





 5  Ahsoka&#39;s Purrgil Are Just What Yuuzhan Vong Would Use To Travel Between Galaxies 
Star Wars Rebels
        

The faith and customs of the Yuuzhan Vong are one of their most notable traits, as the species refuses to use any sort of technology at all. In the Star Wars Legends, they use ships made up of living matter to sail through space, something inherently unique to the Yuuzhan Vong. In canon, the purrgil would be the perfect replacement for these ships, as they are already known to travel between galaxies as seen in Ahsoka. 





 4  Star Wars Has Introduced Living Planets - Crucial To Yuuzhan Vong Mythology 
Star Wars: The High Republic
        

Falling in line with their distaste for technology, at the end of their path of conquest, the Yuuzhan Vong settle on the living planet of Zonama Sekot. This sentient planet played an integral role in brokering peace between the Galactic Alliance and the Yuuzhan Vong. Though this planet itself does not appear in Star Wars canon, there are a couple of sentient planets and places, including the dangerous Planet X and Living Sea of Gazian - both of which make an appearance in The High Republic content.





 3  The Purrgil Migration Routes Match With Yuuzhan Vong Invasion Lanes 
Ahsoka
        

In Ahsoka, viewers are offered much more information on the purrgil and their mysterious trans-galactic migration routes. Most notably, it is shown that this migration route enters and exits the Northern Rim. This directly matches the Yuuzhan Vong invasion routes described in the novels, which began in the north at the galactic entry point they had deemed &#34;Vector Prime.&#34; If they were to make an appearance in Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order trilogy, this would be the perfect entrance strategy with the perfect Ahsoka setup.





 2  Star Wars Has Actually Introduced Yuuzhan Vong Creatures In Canon 
Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures #9
        

The introduction of the vonduun crab to The High Republic series has given many fans hope that the Yuuzhan Vong will not be long to follow. Originally, these creatures were used by the Yuuzhan Vong to create their iconic armor, so strong that it could even deflect blows from a lightsaber. In a recent comic, these creatures have been introduced to a planet at the edge of the galaxy, Zav Alox, in which the crabs play a major role in the customs of the people there.





 1  Star Wars Needs A Uniquely Powerful Villain 
The Empire Has Been Repeated Throughout The Franchise


 







Throughout the years, there has only really been one major threat in the franchise - the Empire. Outside the original series, the prequel trilogy was about the rise of the Empire, and the sequel trilogy was about its rebirth in the form of the First Order. Despite being host to such a diverse galaxy, Star Wars&#39; villains can be remarkably one-note. The introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong would be a fresh start for the franchise in the upcoming New Jedi Order movie, introducing a unique and brutal galaxy-spanning threat for a new generation of Jedi to fight against.
