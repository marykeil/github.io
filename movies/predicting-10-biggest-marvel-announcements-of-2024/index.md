# Predicting 10 Biggest Marvel Announcements Of 2024


## SUMMARY 


 

Marvel Studios&#39; lower output in 2024 could pave the way for huge MCU announcements in anticipation for future projects; i.e.: Fantastic Four&#39;s cast, Spider-Man 4&#39;s release date, Blade&#39;s script, and Avengers: Secret Wars&#39; director.
            

Deadpool 3 could confirm which multiversal characters will appear in Avengers 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars.
            

Dormant MCU projects like Ironheart, unannounced sequels like Thor 5, unconfirmed movies like Planet Hulk, and second seasons like Moon Knight season 2 could also be revealed throughout 2024.
