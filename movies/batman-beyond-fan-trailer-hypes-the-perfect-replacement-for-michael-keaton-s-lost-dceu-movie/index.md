# Batman Beyond Fan Trailer Hypes The Perfect Replacement For Michael Keaton s Lost DCEU Movie


## SUMMARY 



Batman Beyond: Year One trailer impresses with its faithful depiction of the original series and introduces a high-tech Batman facing off against familiar enemies.

Lumis Entertainment&#39;s fan project seeks funding for post-production to bring the live-action Batman Beyond to life, potentially filling the void left by the scrapped DCEU version starring Michael Keaton.

Keaton&#39;s Batman Beyond adaptation was canceled due to the disappointing performance of The Flash and the DCU&#39;s reboot, but there remains hope that the DCU could revive the project as it aims to revamp the DC cinematic universe.

## Literature Review
A trailer for a fan made Batman Beyond movie has re-sparked hype for the project that was initially supposed to be headed up by Michael Keaton.



An indie fan movie hoping to depict the [***Batman Beyond\***](https://screenrant.com/tag/batman-beyond/) animated series in live-action has dropped an impressive trailer, hoping to generate hype for a project that could be the perfect replacement for the lost [DCEU](https://screenrant.com/tag/dceu/) version starring Michael Keaton. *Batman Beyond*, which was part of the[ DC Animated Universe](https://screenrant.com/dc-animated-universe-timmverse-timeline-watch-order-guide/), debuted in 1999 and depicts a futuristic &#34;*Neo-Gotham*,&#34; in which Bruce Wayne is in his 70s and mentors [a new Batman](https://screenrant.com/casting-batman-for-brave-and-the-bold-movie/), Terry Mcginnis, to fight crime in his stead. With cyberpunk-style tech at his disposal, McGinnis comes up against a rogues&#39; gallery comprising new and familiar faces and has since become a cult classic.

The fan project from Lumis Entertainment, dubbed [*Batman Beyond: Year One*](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/batman-beyond-year-one-fan-film-post-production#/), has released a trailer that hits many of the right notes for fans of the original series. The footage shows McGinnis, in his high-tech, [all-black Batsuit with glowing eyes](https://screenrant.com/dc-batman-every-bat-suit-ranked/), coming up against the Royal Flush gang and other enemies, including one that looks like *Batman Beyond*&#39;s rendition of the Joker or a member of the Jokerz gang. A few short shots demonstrate the effort that has gone into the project, which is currently seeking funding for post-production. If successful, it could assuage the disappointment that arose after plans were scrapped for an official movie starring Michael Keaton.



## Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman Beyond Movie Reports Explained

Originally, reports suggested that an official DCEU *Batman Beyond* adaptation starring Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne was planned to follow his reappearance as part of *The Flash*. Unfortunately, **that project hinged on the success of \*The Flash\***, which became one of a string of flops for the DCEU, helping to spell doom for the franchise as a whole and all but condemning the Keaton-led *Batman Beyond* adaptation to the scrap heap. The writing was also on the wall when the DCEU reboot, the DC Universe headed up by James Gunn and Peter Safran, was announced, thereby putting a stop to [all future DCEU plans](https://screenrant.com/dc-upcoming-movies-list-release-dates/).



This is likely why Keaton&#39;s Bruce Wayne died in *The Flash*. If the studio was holding off on creating the DCEU&#39;s ***Batman Beyond\*** until *The Flash* made it financially viable, then it&#39;s hard to see why this death would have been written into the movie. Instead, it looks like the DCU had a significant part to play in the adaptation&#39;s cancelation, though with that comes the hope that the DCU - which is hoping to revamp the DC cinematic universe with a fresh take on the franchise&#39;s heroes anyway - could take up the mantle.
