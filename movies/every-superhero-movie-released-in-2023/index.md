## Literature Review

The MCU, DCEU, and Spider-Verse all had various new installments come out in 2023, covering a selection of genres and setting up for a new year.




2023 was a unique year for the superhero movie genre, with every film released during this period having an important role to play in the movie landscape, especially for the MCU and DCEU. The rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2008 and increasing competition from DC and Sony&#39;s Spider-Man franchises have made it so comic book movies are frequently some of the most popular films each year. 2022 was no different, as nine superhero movies were released from various existing cinematic universes and a few new attempted franchise starters. This does not even take the various superhero TV shows releasing on network television and streaming services into account, which are set to extend the DC and MCU release timeline respectively.
2023&#39;s superhero movies represent more examples of how the genre is changing and evolving as time goes on. MCU Phase 5 kicked off in full force with three highly anticipated sequels, two of which end current trilogies, and Sony&#39;s Spider-Verse has only become more popular with its sequel. Meanwhile, the DCEU movie roster came to an end in 2023, as DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran prepare plans to reboot the DC Universe. All in all, 2023 brought eight uniquely interesting superhero movies that encompass the MCU, DCU, and Spider-Verse.

Sandberg, and once again starred Zachary Levi and Asher Angel as Shazam/Billy Batson. The entire Shazam Family cast also returned, alongside the introduction of DC&#39;s Daughters of Atlas - Hespera (Helen Mirren), Kalypso (Lucy Liu), and Anthea (Rachel Zegler) - who played both villains and allies in the movie.





 6  Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - May 5, 2023 
Part Of The MCU


 







The Guardians of the Galaxy franchise returned after a six-year hiatus when Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 released on May 5, finishing the movie trilogy. The 2023 superhero movie was directed by James Gunn and brought the original Guardians team together one more time before the new Guardians of the Galaxy team formed. The story follows Star-Lord&#39;s (Chris Pratt) search for Gamora (Zoe Saldaña) and Rocket&#39;s (Bradley Cooper) origin. The team also fights the villainous High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), with the latter becoming a part of the new Guardians roster, finally capitalizing on the character&#39;s introduction in 2017.





 5  Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - June 2, 2023 
Part Of The Spider-Verse


 







The first of Sony&#39;s 2023 superhero movies was Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which debuted in theaters on June 2. The sequel to Sony&#39;s surprise animated hit Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse retains writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller but brings in a new trio of directors with various experience in the genre. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s story follows Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld), and Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson) once more as they get wrapped up in a multiversal Spider-Man fight. This includes utilizing Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya), Spider-Woman (Issa Rae), and more.





 4  The Flash - June 16, 2023 
Part Of The DCEU
        

Another multiverse 2023 superhero movie arrived on June 16 when Warner Bros. finally released The Flash. Originally announced in 2014, the long-awaited solo film for Barry Allen comes from IT director Andy Muschietti, and retained controversial star Ezra Miller after their past DC movie appearances. The Flash&#39;s multiverse story allows Ben Affleck and Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman to play roles and explain the introduction of Supergirl (Sasha Calle). The story follows Barry Allen trying to save his mother from dying which changes the universe, and received a less than stellar reception upon its release.





 3  Blue Beetle - August 18, 2023 
Part Of The DCEU
        

The DC 2023 movie slate also saw Blue Beetle release in August. The film stars Cobra Kai&#39;s Xolo Maridueña and is an origin story for Jaime Reyes, a Latino teenager who bonds with a symbiotic scarab that gives him superpowers, transforming him into Blue Beetle. It is directed by Ángel Manuel Soto (Charm City Kings) and marks the first feature film live-action appearance by the comic character. Blue Beetle is also the first superhero movie starring a Latino hero.





 2  The Marvels - November 10, 2023 
Part Of The MCU


 







The final MCU 2023 movie arrived on July 28 with The Marvels. Directed by Candyman&#39;s Nia DaCosta, the Captain Marvel sequel releases four years after the original, starring Brie Larson&#39;s Carol Danvers, Iman Vellani&#39;s Ms. Marvel, and Teyonah Parris&#39; Monica Rambeau, as well as Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Marvel villain Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton). The Marvels&#39; plot explores Captain Marvel&#39;s history and past mistakes, allowing her to bond with a prospective new team while continuing to develop her own character arc as she confronts a villain from her past.





 1  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom - December 25, 2023 
Part Of The DCEU
        

The final superhero movie of 2023 was Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which would be the final film in the DCEU, with the DCU reboot starting up in 2024. The sequel to 2018&#39;s surprise box office hit was once again directed by James Wan and brings Jason Momoa back as Arthur Curry. Aquaman 2 took the story in a perhaps surprising direction, as the plot of the superhero movie focused around Aquaman and his villain half-brother Ocean Master (Patrick Wilson), facing against Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and the forces of evil to close out the DCEU.
