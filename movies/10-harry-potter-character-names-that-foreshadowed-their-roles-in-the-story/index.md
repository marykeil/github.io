## Literature Review

J.K. Rowling has thought through every Harry Potter character&#39;s name, but some of them contain more spoilers than others.




Harry Potter is full of hidden details and Easter eggs, but nothing is more of a spoiler than the names of various characters. J.K. Rowling is famous for her attention to detail and thoroughness when it comes to giving eagle-eyed readers subtle hints regarding this or that character&#39;s future in the saga. Harry Potter offers quite a few plot twists, but some of them can be deduced solely based on the name of the character, involved in the storyline. Even the Marauders&#39; given names are a bit of a giveaway, not to mention their nicknames that feel a bit too on the nose.
The Harry Potter movies aren&#39;t as extensive as the original novels, especially with the characters&#39; backstories, simply because there is too much to cover in the source material. Yet, certain characters have received enough screen time, and the meta references in their names can be easily understood. From Sirius Black and Remus Lupin to Cornelius Fudge and Rita Skeeter, the Harry Potter saga features plenty of characters with prophetic names, although some of them are a bit more obvious than others.
            
 
 10 Debunked Movie Theories We All Love Anyway 
Iconic movies like Titanic and Harry Potter have spawned a lot of theories, and even though they have been debunked, they still enthrall audiences.












 








 10  Narcissa Malfoy 
Narcissa&#39;s name gives away her vanity


 







This Harry Potter character clearly had a connection with Greek mythology. &#34;Narcissa&#34; is a reference to Narcissus, a self-involved man who was so in love with his appearance that he spent his life staring at his reflection. Mrs. Malfoy&#39;s vanity may not have been so literal, but she was known to be a pretentious woman with a holier-than-thou attitude toward anyone who wasn&#39;t a Pure-Blood. Narcissa&#39;s last name is further proof of this sentiment — &#34;mal&#34; is French for &#34;evil,&#34; and &#34;foy&#34; is a transformed French word &#34;foi,&#34; which means &#34;belief.&#34; After all, the Malfoys&#39; obsession with keeping magic within the Pure-Blood community could be classified as an &#34;evil belief.&#34;





 9  Sybill Trelawney 
Sybill&#39;s name hints at her Seer abilities
        

According to one of the heartbreaking Harry Potter theories, Sybill Trelawney was such a powerful Seer that she predicted even Dumbledore&#39;s death. While that remains uncertain, Professor Trelawney has turned out to have a knack for foretelling the future, despite giving the initial impression of a fraud. Her name should have been the first hint — &#34;Sybill&#34; is a homonym of &#34;sibyl,&#34; a word that denoted a female oracle in Ancient Greece. &#34;Trelawney,&#34; in turn, is an old Cornish last name, referencing Sybill&#39;s constant boasting about her talented Seer ancestors.





 8  Cornelius Fudge 
Cornelius&#39; last name predetermines his cowardliness
        

The Minister of Magic&#39;s first name may come from the Latin word &#34;cornu,&#34; denoting &#34;horn,&#34; which itself can be a reference to Cornelius&#39; evil nature. He emerged as one of the good characters, but ended up being on the wrong, devilish side of history. Fudge&#39;s last name is even more interesting and suggestive of his cowardly actions and desire to conceal Voldemort&#39;s return. &#34;To fudge&#34; means &#34;to deal with something inadequately in an effort to hide the truth,&#34; and that is essentially what the Minister did all throughout Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.





 7  Nagini 
Nagini&#39;s double nature is in her name


 







Nagini was an important character both in the Harry Potter movies and in the Fantastic Beasts prequels. Not only was she one of Voldemort&#39;s Horcruxes, but she was also a Maledictus, a woman cursed to transform into a certain beast. In retrospect, Nagini&#39;s name is quite telling: translated from Sanskrit, it means &#34;a being that takes the form of a great snake.&#34; It seems like Nagini was never meant to be an ordinary snake, and her name might be indicative both of her blood curse and the fact that she was turned into a Horcrux.





 6  Dolores Umbridge 
Dolores&#39; name refers to the effect she has on others
        

Dolores Umbridge was arguably the worst villain of Harry Potter, and her names reflect her atrocious personality. &#34;Dolores&#34; is rooted in Latin and means &#34;sorrow,&#34; which is a callback to all the pain she inflicted on people around her. Her last name comes from the phrase &#34;to take umbrage,&#34; and it is synonymous with the expression &#34;to take offence.&#34; Umbridge believed that she knew everything there was to know about the world, and she was more than offended when someone disagreed with her. She showed that to be true both as a Hogwarts Professor and as a Ministry worker later on.





 5  Rita Skeeter 
Rita&#39;s last name is a testament to her personality
        

Rita Skeeter was the nosiest journalist in all of Harry Potter, and her insectoid Animagus form helped her a great deal with learning all the best sensations. Her first name doesn&#39;t give any clues to her true nature, but her last name can&#39;t be clearer about it. &#34;Skeeter&#34; colloquially means &#34;mosquito,&#34; and there is even a disease, Skeeter syndrome, that is characterized by having an allergic reaction to mosquito bites. Rita&#39;s Animagus form wasn&#39;t a mosquito — it was a beetle — but the reference in her name was obvious enough regarding what to expect from Skeeter.





 4  Remus Lupin 
Remus&#39; entire name foretold his fate


 







Remus Lupin and Fenrir Greyback were both werewolves, but they were on different sides of the war. Greyback was the one who bit Lupin in the first place, but Remus&#39; name might have been even more responsible for his condition than Greyback. &#34;Remus&#34; is an obvious reference to the figure from Roman mythology, most notable for being raised by a wolf, and &#34;Lupin&#34; is derived from the Latin word &#34;lupinus,&#34; which literally translates to &#34;of a wolf.&#34; It was Professor Lupin&#39;s full name that was the biggest giveaway of his lycanthropy, not his injuries and absences from class in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.





 3  Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore 
Albus&#39; namesake also went on an impossible quest
        

In Harry Potter, each name of the Headmaster of Hogwarts bears a special meaning. &#34;Albus&#34; is Latin for &#34;white,&#34; the color associated with wisdom. &#34;Percival&#34; might refer to Dumbledore&#39;s namesake, one of King Arthur&#39;s Knights of the Round Table, who searched for the lost Holy Grail — much like him, the Headmaster spent years looking for the Deathly Hallows. &#34;Wulfric&#34; means &#34;wolf ruler&#34; in Anglo-Saxon, which can be a subtle hint at Dumbledore&#39;s power in the magical community. &#34;Brian&#34; may come from the Old Celtic word for &#34;noble,&#34; as the Dumbledores were an old and respected wizarding family. Finally, &#34;Dumbledore&#34; is translated to &#34;bumblebee&#34; from Old English, and it may be a reference to the character&#39;s love for music.





 2  Lord Voldemort 
Riddle&#39;s chosen name translates into his heart&#39;s deepest desire
        

Tom Riddle fashioned himself the name that he hoped would scare the entire wizarding community into submission. While &#34;Lord&#34; surely refers to Riddle&#39;s obsession with nobility and pure blood, &#34;Voldemort&#34; has a deeper meaning. It is derived from the French expression &#34;vol de mort,&#34; meaning &#34;flight from death.&#34; Harry Potter&#39;s biggest plot twist had to do with Voldemort&#39;s way of escaping death, that is creating Horcruxes. Riddle was infatuated with the idea of immortality, so he spent his miserable life pointlessly running from his own demise.





 1  Sirius Black 
Sirius&#39; star name references his Animagus form
        

Sirius Black&#39;s name is essentially the funniest pun in Harry Potter. Just like many members of his family, he was named after a celestial body. His first name is a reference to the Dog Star, and Sirius&#39; Animagus form was a dog. The character&#39;s last name is even more frank, as Black did transform into a black dog at will. Rita Skeeter&#39;s Animagus form is heavily implied in the name, but Sirius&#39; form is as good as spelled-out. Sirius&#39; big secret may seem obvious now, but years ago, the plot twist was rather shocking.
