## Literature Review

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes moves its release date, avoiding a big box office battle with another highly anticipated 2024 action movie.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes moves its release date, avoiding a box office battle with another highly-anticipated 2024 movie. The latest installment in this long-running sci-fi franchise promises a return to the spirit of the original 1968 Planet of the Apes, as it jumps ahead in the timeline to depict a world where apes have become the dominant species, and humans their slaves. Wes Ball takes over directing duties on the new film, after Matt Reeves shepherded the franchise through its previous two installments.




Ballâ€™s take on this venerable sci-fi series looks to be exciting indeed, and audiences will get to experience it sooner than expected, as 20th Century Studios has shifted the Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes release date two weeks earlier from May 24, 2024 to May 10, avoiding what had been shaping up as a huge box office showdown with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The move means that Kingdom will have two weeks of IMAX shows before Furiosa arrives, a big deal as this will be the first time a movie in the Apes series has played on IMAX.


 Furiosa Probably Would Have Beaten Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes At The Box Office 
          

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga arguably has as much buzz as any movie set to arrive in the summer of 2024, and is shaping up to be one of the biggest hits of the season. Programming Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes against another sci-fi/action property was probably not a winning proposition, even leaving aside the problem of booking IMAX screens against the highly-anticipated Anya Taylor-Joy-starring Fury Road prequel movie. When it comes to this particular release date chicken game, Disney was the company that ultimately blinked.






Director Ball has teased that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes kicks off a new trilogy.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will still have some competition at the box office on May 10, as it now goes up against the Amy Winehouse biopic Back to Black and the horror film Horrorscope, but those movies are outside the action genre, leaving a clearer path for Kingdom to pull in fans who will also be interested in the Fury Road prequel. Fans who had been mulling which of the two movies to see on May 24 will have an easier decision, as Furiosa is now pitted only against Chris Pratt and Garfield.
