 Kevin Hart, Úrsula Corberó &amp; Gugu Mbatha-Raw Talk Lift 
          




Screen Rant: I am very excited to chat with you. Lift is so much fun; a great entry into the heist genre. Kevin, you are on board as both a producer and a star. What about this project really spoke to you to wear both hats?


Kevin Hart: It was the scale of it, a different opportunity to attach myself to a bigger project. I think they&#39;ve been getting bigger, especially within like the last 5–7 years of my career. So, how do you keep the conversation going in the direction of up? You need projects that are aligned with the idea, and the idea of leading man, the idea of action, the idea of thrills, you need the projects, the correct projects, to help make that factual. This checked all those boxes, this definitely was a big idea, big concept that I feel we really delivered on. All the hands on deck played a very valuable piece, too.


They all did a phenomenal job, including Gugu and Úrsula right here. I love the layers to this character, the motherhood that she has, and also the action that she brings. What was it like for you to get to the heart of your character?





Úrsula Corberó: It was fun, let me say, when I read the script, and I saw Camila was a pilot, I was like, &#34;Okay, a real woman, I need to do that.&#34; Also, I have the feeling — I was talking about it before — I feel very grateful, because I&#39;ve been able to play these super powerful women in the last years of my career, and also, I think it&#39;s very important for me at least to share with people that you can be powerful, but you can be human, sensitive, or vulnerable at the same time. So yeah, I feel like Camila is just human, she&#39;s powerful, but she&#39;s always very sensitive, and she&#39;s a bada--.


          

Gugu, you are incredible in the movie, and you have been on a nice streak of similarly powerful women, whether it be Loki or this. What was it like for you to explore your character in this movie in comparison to some of your other similarly powerful women?





Gugu Mbatha-Raw: It&#39;s been really fun. I think that the tone of this has been a shift for me. I think the fact that it&#39;s a heist genre, that it&#39;s action, but also there&#39;s a light-hearted playfulness to the gang, and the energy is fast-paced has been different for me. I think the fun thing for Abby, she is very much the straight woman, and I think, like you said, coming from playing the sort of tougher characters in Loki or more psychological thrillers with a darker energy, this has been a nice balance. Because it feels like it&#39;s buoyant, and it&#39;s an ensemble, and I think Abby goes from being the straight woman to also being part of the team, which has just been a really nice journey.
