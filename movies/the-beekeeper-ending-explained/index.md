The Beekeeper ends with Adam Clay killing multiple FBI and Secret Service in his hunt for Derek Danforth, who also doesn’t make it out alive. The action film, directed by David Ayer, stars Jason Statham as the titular beekeeper. A man on a mission, Clay makes it all the way to the White House in his quest to avenge Eloise Parker. Hiding beneath a truck headed to the event President Danforth is hosting, Clay manages to get past highly trained agents to get in, all without breaking a sweat. Once inside, Clay confronts former CIA director Wallace Westwyld, and Eloise’s daughter Agent Verona Parker, who plans to shoot him.

Inside the Oval Office, Josh Hutcherson’s Derek faces down his mother, who has discovered her son has been using Danforth Enterprise’s data mining software to conduct phishing scams. Derek also used dirty money to fund President Danforth’s election campaign. Danforth is angry, and Derek uses the situation to hold his mother at gunpoint and kill the deputy director of the FBI. Clay bursts into the room, however, and manages to shoot Derek in the head. Clay jumps out the window and makes it to the river, where he’s got gear waiting for him. Parker, who has a clear shot, decides not to kill him after all, letting Clay get away.





 Who Are The Beekeepers? Secret Agent Program Explained 
         

The Beekeeper program is so secret that even Wallace Westwyld didn’t know about it for a while. The program recruits agents to train as the final line of defense, and as a last resort. When all other agents and assets have been exhausted, the Beekeepers are given the responsibility of protecting the beehive, and are given resources to complete their work and to act on their own judgment. The Beekeepers are expected to act in the beehive’s best interests, though they can seemingly do so outside of CIA or FBI parameters.

Beekeepers are so highly trained that they make special forces and other bureau agents look useless. It’s unclear when the Beekeeper program began, but it’s been active in the shadows for a long enough time, with a Beekeeper’s identity wiped from the system so they can’t be found. They’re dangerous and, as Wallace tells Derek, “When a Beekeeper says you’re going to die, you’re going to die.” Clay and the rest of the Beekeepers operate on the fringes of the law, which means they’re capable of anything.






 Why Agent Parker Lets Adam Clay Escape At The End Of The Beekeeper 
          

Verona Parker is adamant about going after Adam Clay because, though she thinks he’s ultimately right, there are laws to deal with such grievances. Parker ultimately changes her mind because Clay asks her to make a choice — between the law and justice. Given the chance to finally catch him, Parker lets Clay escape because she sees his perspective, as well as what he’s trying to do to make Derek pay for the harm he caused. In this instance, Clay is very much a vigilante acting outside the law and Parker is caught in the middle of doing what she’s always believed was right and Clay’s brand of justice.



Agent Parker is the only one who understood the reasons behind Adam Clay&#39;s actions.









 What’s Next For President Danforth After Clay Kills Derek 
          

President Jessica Danforth was horrified after Clay killed Derek. But before Derek’s death, and prior to when he held her hostage, she said she would reveal to the country that her campaign money was dirty. Danforth believed it was the right thing to do, especially considering that she left her own company behind to run for president, and seemed to have some integrity (unlike her son). But now that Derek is dead, it’s possible she won’t go through with it. The public will want to know the reason behind Derek’s murder, and President Danforth might use his death to avoid further scandal and to save her reputation.



 The Real Reason Adam Clay Went After Derek Danforth 
Clay could’ve stopped after destroying the first call center
          




Clay could have called it a day after setting the first call center, United Data Group, on fire. After all, it was United Data Group and its employees that scammed Eloise out of her money, and taking it out of operation would have avenged her death. But once Clay learned that there were more call centers and that Derek owned them all, the Beekeeper knew he had to take him out to prevent further corruption.

If Clay had only removed United Data Group from the equation, it wouldn’t have been a big enough hit on Derek’s business, and they would have continued scamming people from other call centers. The fact that Derek was President Danforth’s son meant the queen bee had been compromised, and Clay had to take him out to protect the hive. Clay wouldn’t stop until Derek was killed — he was an infection that was affecting the most vulnerable people, and his influence had to end.



 How Adam Clay’s Ending Sets Up The Beekeeper 2 
          




Adam Clay managed to get in and out of the White House without being killed (only one of the mercenaries came close), so the fact that he escaped and will probably be hunted even more after killing Derek is more than enough to set up The Beekeeper 2. What’s more, Parker let Clay escape at the end of The Beekeeper, and it’s possible that she will either change her mind about what she did and try to find him again, or figure out some way to team up with him for another mission.

Now that the director of the FBI is dead, Parker could get promoted, and the story can go from there. At the time of this writing, a sequel to The Beekeeper has not been announced. However, the action film has enough worldbuilding and intrigue to continue in a sequel, if only to see what Jason Statham’s Clay gets up to next, and how he will manage to avoid being caught after such a high-profile kill.



 What The Beekeeper’s Ending Really Means 
          




The Beekeeper is a revenge film on the surface, but the levels of corruption Clay uncovers showcase that no entity — no matter how good their intentions may seem — is free from duplicity. The film also reveals how those in power can exploit the vulnerable for their own gains and greed, as was exemplified by Eloise being scammed out of her money and charity earnings. Though Clay’s mission was personal, his need to protect the beehive stems from the notion of imbalance. He was working to right a wrong, one that was made all the more alarming considering the man in charge of such heinous operations was the president’s own son.

What’s more, Parker’s decision to allow Clay to escape suggests she’s beginning to question the limits of the law, as well as what is just. Both characters make different moral judgments throughout the film, and The Beekeeper asks which one is ultimately right. The film presents an interesting conundrum regarding the way in which corruption and general wrongdoing should be approached, especially as it relates to its victims.
