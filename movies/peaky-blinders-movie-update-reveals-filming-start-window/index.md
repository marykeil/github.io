## Literature Review

Creator Steven Knight shares a new update about the announced Peaky Blinders movie, revealing when the project is set to start production.




Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight shares a promising new update about the announced movie, including an expected filming start window. First airing in 2013, Cillian Murphy leads the Peaky Blinders cast as Thomas Shelby, the leader of the titular gangster family in Birmingham, England, in the 1920s. Prior to the acclaimed series coming to an end with season 6 in 2022, Knight confirmed that plans were in place to continue the story in a sequel film.




Now, as updates on the Peaky Blinders movie remain few and far between, Knight reveals in a recent interview with Radio Times that the movie is expected to start filming this year. If this plan sticks, the movie could potentially target a 2025 release date. Check out Knight&#39;s full update on the project below:



&#34;Iâ€™m just working on the final bits of it at the moment... The plan is to start shooting that in the middle of [2024].&#34;




 What To Expect From The Peaky Blinders Movie 
          

No official plot details have been revealed for the upcoming film, and it&#39;s not clear how much the Peaky Blinders season 6 ending will serve as a setup for events to come. After season 6 brought the story into the 1930s, Knight has confirmed that the movie will use World War II as a backdrop, meaning a number of years will have passed since the show&#39;s conclusion. This time jump could mean that the movie&#39;s storyline won&#39;t be a direct continuation of past events.




As for the Peaky Blinders movie&#39;s cast, it&#39;s likely that a number of familiar faces will be returning. After rocketing to worldwide renown with the release of Oppenheimer last summer, Cillian Murphy has expressed on numerous occasions that he is interested in reprising his role as Tommy. The movie will seemingly also see the return of Paul Anderson&#39;s Arthur Jr., though whether other characters, like Tom Hardy&#39;s Alfie Solomons, will return, remains a mystery.



In addition to a feature film, two Peaky Blinders spinoff projects are also in the works, with one set to serve as a prequel story for the late Helen McCrory&#39;s Polly Gray, and the other to follow all new characters in Boston in the mid-1900s.




In addition to returning characters, the Peaky Blinders movie is also likely to introduce a number of fresh faces, with Knight previously teasing that he would be interested in Tom Holland, who once auditioned for the show, to participate. If the movie does begin filming in the middle of this year, a mid- or late-2025 release date is entirely possible.
