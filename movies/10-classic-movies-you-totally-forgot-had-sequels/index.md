# 10 Classic Movies You Totally Forgot Had Sequels


## SUMMARY 


 Sequels to beloved movies often struggle to replicate the success of the original due to cast changes, hiring different directors or writers, or losing the unique spark. 
 Grease 2, Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, and American Psycho 2 are examples of forgettable sequels that failed to capture the magic of their predecessors. 
 Despite attempts at sequels and prequels, such as Dirty Dancing 2 and Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies, the originals like Dirty Dancing and Grease remain the most beloved and enduring films in their respective franchises.

## Literature Review

It may come as a shock, but cult classics like Grease, The Mask, and Donnie Darko have sequels, albeit lesser-known than the original movies.




Sometimes a successful movie spawns a whole franchise, and other times, it may lead to a sequel that no one even remembers a few years later. There is no success formula, but critical reception and box office numbers do play a huge role in whether the sequel joins the original movie on the pedestal of eternal fame. While Grease, starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, continues to be a hit almost half a century after its release, Grease 2 was so critically hated that it eventually sank into cinematic oblivion. It is a shame that the Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer-led follow-up flick never lived up to the glory of its predecessor.
Apart from Grease, there are quite a few examples of classic movies with forgettable sequels. The reason for their lack of success tends to lie in the cast changes. The sequels&#39; failure can also be attributed to hiring a different director or writer, trying to recreate the original film without adding any depth to the story, or losing the unique spark that made the first film worth watching in the first place. In fact, all three reasons have contributed to Staying Alive, the sequel to Saturday Night Fever, becoming the oldest movie with 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.
            
 
 10 Debunked Movie Theories We All Love Anyway 
Iconic movies like Titanic and Harry Potter have spawned a lot of theories, and even though they have been debunked, they still enthrall audiences.












 








 10  Grease (1978) 
Direct sequel: Grease 2 (1982)


 







  Grease  


  Release Date    July 7, 1978     Cast    John Travolta , Olivia Newton-John , Stockard Channing , Jeff Conaway , Barry Pearl , Michael Tucci     Runtime    110 minutes    


Grease, the beloved musical romantic comedy, told the story of a young love between T-bird Danny Zuko and Pink Lady Sandy Olsson. The movie was a critical and commercial hit and quickly joined the ranks of cult classics, propelling John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John toward international fame in the meantime. Grease 2, starring Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer, never even stood a chance of replicating the success of the original film, even though it had a fresh roles-reversed premise and superb acting. In 2023, Paramount&#43; released a TV prequel, Grease: Rise of the Pink Ladies, but it was canceled after season 1 and removed from the streaming service.





 9  Dirty Dancing (1987) 
Direct prequel: Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights (2004)
        

  Dirty Dancing  


  Release Date    August 21, 1987     Cast    jennifer grey , Patrick swayze , Jerry Orbach , Cynthia Rhodes , Jack Weston , Jane Brucker     Runtime    100 minutes    


Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey may have hated each other off-screen, but their fiery chemistry made for an unforgettable dance film, as Dirty Dancing&#39;s legacy is still very much alive and breathing today, no thanks to the sequels or prequels. Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights was essentially the same story but set during the Cuban Revolution, and not even Swayze&#39;s appearance in the film could have saved it from itself. The prequel wasn&#39;t the only continuation of the hit drama — there were a 1988 TV series of the same name and a 2017 musical adaptation. A direct sequel with Grey reprising her role is currently in development, although Dirty Dancing 2&#39;s release keeps getting delayed.





 8  The Wizard Of Oz (1939) 
Direct sequel: Journey Back to Oz (1972)
        

  The Wizard of Oz  


  Release Date    August 25, 1939     Cast    Margaret Hamilton , Jack Haley , Judy Garland , Bert Lahr , Ray Bolger     Runtime    102 minutes    


There have been a lot of adaptations of L. Frank Baum&#39;s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, but the movie with Judy Garland in the lead role arguably remains the best interpretation to date. The cult classic is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. It took 33 years to release an official sequel, and Journey Back to Oz, based on Baum&#39;s The Marvelous Land of Oz, turned out to be a worthy continuation. Liza Minnelli, Garland&#39;s daughter, did a great job of voicing Dorothy, and it is a pity that the animated sequel isn&#39;t nearly as well-known as the original.





 7  Donnie Darko (2001) 
Direct sequel: S. Darko (2009)


 







  Donnie Darko  


  Release Date    October 26, 2001     Cast    Jake Gyllenhaal , Holmes Osborne , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Daveigh Chase , Mary McDonnell , James Duval     Runtime    113 minutes    


Once upon a time, Richard Kelly&#39;s Donnie Darko revolutionized the sci-fi thriller genre with a dark take on teen experiences. The movie became a cult classic and gave way to a sequel, S. Darko, but Kelly had nothing to do with it. Centering around Donnie&#39;s sister, Samantha, the film felt like a mere rip-off of the original, which is why it never took off commercially or in the eyes of the public. The initial director has recently announced another sequel to Donnie Darko, but the plot details and even the release date are under wraps.





 6  The Mask (1994) 
Direct sequel: Son of the Mask (2005)
        

  The Mask  


  Release Date    July 29, 1994     Cast    Richard Jeni , Peter Riegert , Peter Greene , Cameron Diaz , Amy Yasbeck , Jim Carrey     Runtime    101 minutes    


The Mask showcased Jim Carrey&#39;s comedic abilities to the fullest and launched Cameron Diaz&#39;s career. The superhero comedy film established a franchise, although none of the sequels ever achieved its level of success. The animated series of the same name managed to stay afloat for three entire seasons, but the direct follow-up movie, Son of the Mask, was a failure all-round. There was supposed to be a sequel with Carrey reprising his role, but since he declined the offer, the executives had to get creative, which did not pan out as well as they had initially hoped.





 5  American Psycho (2000) 
Direct sequel: American Psycho 2 (2002)
        

  American Psycho  


  Release Date    April 13, 2000     Cast    Jared Leto , Reese Witherspoon , Chloe Sevigny , Willem Dafoe , Justin Theroux , Christian Bale     Runtime    101 minutes    


Based on Bret Easton Ellis&#39;s novel, Christian Bale-led American Psycho is a staple of the satirical horror genre. The only good thing that came off its ill-received sequel, American Psycho 2, was that it proved that Patrick Bateman&#39;s murders really happened. Apart from that, the movie brought nothing new to the table. The screenplay was full of plot holes, and the film itself didn&#39;t seem like it was connected to American Psycho at all. Even Mila Kunis, the star of the movie, admitted that making American Psycho 2 was a huge mistake on her part and everyone else&#39;s.





 4  Bambi (1942) 
Direct sequel: Bambi II (2006)
        

Disney&#39;s Bambi is one of the company&#39;s most well-known animated films, and it is also a movie that has broken the most hearts over the years. In 2006, Bambi&#39;s devastating story received a continuation — Bambi II, set during Bambi&#39;s young years, revolves around the titular character&#39;s relationship with his father. It may not be as gripping as the original film, but it has unfairly been lost in history. The animation was top-notch at the time, and the plot offered a deeper insight into Bambi&#39;s life after his mother died, and he was left under his father&#39;s guardianship.





 3  Mean Girls (2004) 
Direct sequel: Mean Girls 2 (2011)


 







  Mean Girls (2004)  


  Release Date    April 30, 2004     Cast    Amy Poehler , Lacey Chabert , Tina Fey , Rachel McAdams , Amanda Seyfried , Lindsay Lohan     Runtime    97 minutes    


Mean Girls may be the youngest movie on this list, but it has long earned its cult classic status. The comedy, starring Lindsay Lohan, is quoted to this day, which can&#39;t be said about the follow-up. Mean Girls 2 could have carried on the legacy, but sadly, it ended up being a cheesy remake with no soul behind it. Tina Fey, the original screenwriter of the 2004 film, is making a comeback, and her Mean Girls musical sequel, which is set to premiere on January 12, 2024, might right all the wrongs of the remake once and for all.





 2  The Lion King (1994) 
Direct sequel: The Lion King II: Simba&#39;s Pride (1998)
        

The Lion King is an iconic coming-of-age movie that sends out lots of important messages about love and family, trust and betrayal, freedom and loneliness. Simba&#39;s story continued in two TV series, two sequel movies, and it even received a photorealistic remake in 2019. None of them turned out to be big hits, but they managed to bring out the nostalgia. The direct sequel, The Lion King II: Simba&#39;s Pride, wasn&#39;t quite up to the standards set by the original — the main Scar-esque villain was forgettable, and the soundtrack wasn&#39;t nearly as catchy. Still, the film is worth a watch.





 1  Saturday Night Fever (1977) 
Direct sequel: Staying Alive (1983)
        

After Saturday Night Fever, John Travolta woke up an A-list star who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, and rightfully so. The movie reintroduced disco into the mainstream and became an instant cult classic. The lead actor reprised his role as Tony Manero in Staying Alive, but it didn&#39;t save the film from becoming a critical failure. The sequel did well at the box office, but its lack of depth and weird dance sequences didn&#39;t make a great impression on critics, and the film was doomed to be forgotten as the years went by.
