With his specials ranging from the silly pre-Chappelle&#39;s Show era to the more controversial recent specials, taking a look at his work on stage highlights his amazing career.
            
 
 20 Best Stand Up Comedy Specials 
From Bo Burnham to Richard Pryor, these stand up specials stand the test of time.












 








 10  Deep In The Heart Of Texas (2017) 
Runtime: 1h 6m


 







Also known as Dave Chappelle: Live at Austin City Limits. This Netflix special aired in March 2017 and served as much-needed therapy as the world started to spin out of control. The performance addressed the rise of racism with a series of anecdotes concerning awkward interracial encounters, before moving on to parents of today and the growing list of celebrity scandals. Deep In The Heart Of Texas is another fearless stand-up performance from Chappelle as he unapologetically tackles serious topics like racially motivated police shootings and the threat of ISIS in a thought-provoking and hilarious way.





 9  The Age Of Spin (2017) 
Runtime: 1h 7m
        

The Age Of Spin - a.k.a Dave Chappelle: Live At The Hollywood Palladium - was released alongside Deep In The Heart Of Texas and featured a more focused take on similar grounds. After addressing the mounting problems caused by his own generation, he holds a mirror up to the next, lest they end up crafting a similar hell for themselves. The performance featured meditations on the rapid evolution of humanity and technology and his struggle to keep up, as well as his go-to icebreaker O.J. Simpson.





 8  8:46 (2020) 
Runtime: 27m


 







Fans can&#39;t be blamed for not knowing what to expect when Chappelle announced he would be doing a private outdoor show in June 2020. Just a few weeks after George Floyd&#39;s tragic death and several months after the start of the pandemic, it was an uncertain and scary time. Chappelle acknowledges how strange the situation is during the slow start of his performance but quickly reminds everyone why the special is called 8:46 â€“ a reference to Floyd&#39;s manner of death because of police brutality. It&#39;s an unconventional stand-up performance, with more moments of jarring seriousness interspersed with jokes to punctuate the absurdity, fear, and anger around racism and gun violence.





 7  The  r (2021) 
Runtime: 1h 12m
        

Dave Chappelle&#39;s critique of the LGBTQ&#43; community and the way that social media reacts to his shows likely only added fuel to the growing fire about his brand of comedy. He doubles down and points out the perceived hypocrisy surrounding the &#34;Me Too&#34; movement, before defining himself as a proud feminist. Despite all of these audacious segments, the most powerful part of the special is undoubtedly his tear-jerking story about his friend and fellow comedian, Daphne Dorman. While there are some hilarious highlights, it is also one of Chappelle&#39;s most controversial specials.





 6  What&#39;s In A Name (2022) 
Runtime: 39m
        

Perhaps the most revealing recent work by Dave Chappelle, Netflix&#39;s What&#39;s In A Name is actually Chappelle giving a speech at his alma mater, the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, who decided to name their theater after the stand-up comic. Instead, citing the political outrage caused by his antics, Chappelle declined and instead opted to name the building the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression, saying that the school and community would decide if and when they&#39;re comfortable naming the theater after Dave Chappelle. Apart from being a masterclass in storytelling, What&#39;s In A Name&#39;s arguably still problematic takes nonetheless seem to be genuinely driven by Chappelle&#39;s intent to reconcile his views with audiences.





 5  Equanimity (2017) 
Runtime: 1h 3m


 







Equanimity was Chappelle&#39;s final 2017 Netflix special. It was just as hilarious as the others and also a bit lighter and less controversial. Echoing Chappelle&#39;s classic, outrageous stand-up style from the Chappelle&#39;s Show era, he begins by shamelessly bragging that he&#39;s simply too good at comedy writing and performing, before masterfully demonstrating these skills with the flawless &#34;kicked&#34; routine. With total control of the audience, he takes them through his childhood and his experiences with &#34;fake news&#34; and backlash from the transgender community. Equanimity is a gut-busting performance that emphasizes the comedian&#39;s wits and talent, as well as his bold take on subjects that will not sit well with all audiences.





 4  Sticks And Stones (2019) 
Runtime: 1h 5m
        

After Equanimity, Chappelle took a short break after joking about being suspicious of his growing success. He returned with a bang in 2019 which launched a string of standup specials over the last couple of years. Ticking off every subject of controversy available, Chappelle took no prisoners. He even had a go at audiences, stating he&#39;d perform more often if he wasn&#39;t worried about getting ruined. While this special contains the infamously tone-deaf alphabet people rant, it is also modern Chappelle at his slickest.





 3  For What It&#39;s Worth (2004) 
Runtime: 1h
        

2004&#39;s For What It&#39;s Worth was Chappelle&#39;s second official stand-up special, the long-awaited follow-up to his 2000 special with HBO. This full-length special aired on Showtime and was performed in front of a huge crowd at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during his TV show&#39;s run. He had already mastered the art of stand-up and cemented his winning style by 2004, and as flawless as his modern routines are, his older routines where he actually had to try are among his greatest, and he works the auditorium as well as he works a crowd of 100 people as he goes into the intricacies of monkey-seduction.





 2  Chappelle&#39;s Show (2003 - 2006) 
Runtime: 22m episodes
        

There&#39;s a reason why Chappelle&#39;s Show is popular and streaming on Netflix two decades after it first aired. Even with the recent burst of Netflix specials, the greatest wealth of the best Dave Chappelle stand-up performances come from Chappelle&#39;s Show, which ran for three seasons from 2003-2006. Along with many iconic sketches and parodies, Chappelle would open the show to a live audience at Austin&#39;s Moody Theatre every week as America tuned in to get his unique perspective on things. Each one of Chappelle&#39;s Show&#39;s hilarious stand-up comedy episodes brought something new and unexpected, pushing the boundaries of the genre and redefining it for years to come.





 1  Killin&#39; Them Softly (2000) 
Runtime: 57m
        

After nailing his half-hour spot with HBO in 1998, they gave Dave Chappelle a full-length special in 2000. Killin&#39; Them Softly was a powerhouse comic performance for the time, with Chappelle working a multi-racial crowd before thoroughly exploring the more unspoken race divide without rubbing anyone&#39;s nose in it. Even before Chappelle&#39;s Show&#39;s Prince and Clayton Bigsby sketches catapulted him into mainstream stardom, Chappelle already created one of the greatest stand-up specials at the turn of the century.
Despite being gone for years, Chappelle obviously hasn&#39;t lost his quick wits and incredible ability to make taboo topics laughable. It would be easy to say it&#39;s Chappelle at his best, but he continues to outdo himself. It&#39;s only a matter of time before a new special dethrones Killin&#39; Them Softly as the best Dave Chappelle stand-up performance.
