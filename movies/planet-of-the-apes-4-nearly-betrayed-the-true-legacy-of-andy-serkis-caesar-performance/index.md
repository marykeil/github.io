# Planet Of The Apes 4 Nearly Betrayed The True Legacy Of Andy Serkis  Caesar Performance


## SUMMARY 



Andy Serkis&#39; iconic portrayal of Caesar in the Planet of the Apes franchise almost led to his return in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, but the decision to bring him back would have been a big mistake.

Bringing Serkis back as a different character would have been strange and would show that the film is too concerned with clinging onto the past instead of moving forward.

Serkis&#39; return would not only undermine his work as Caesar, but also hurt the field of motion capture by depriving other talented performers of the opportunity to play the role.

## Literature Review
Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes almost made a huge mistake in regards to Andy Serkis, with it almost completely ruining his legacy as Caesar.

[***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes***](https://screenrant.com/tag/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes/) nearly betrayed the true legacy of Andy Serkis&#39; Caesar performance, with this decision almost bringing down the entirety of the *Planet of the Apes* franchise with it. Andy Serkis starred as Caesar in all three entries in Matt Reeves&#39; modern *Planet of the Apes* trilogy, with his performance as the leading ape being one of the highlights of the films. While Andy Serkis&#39; Caesar performance is legendary, one behind-the-scenes choice in the development of *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* nearly ruined it, hurting the legacy of the actor and the character forever.

Matt Reeves&#39; *Planet of the Apes* trilogy is one of the most beloved blockbuster movie series of all time, with it revitalizing the classic sci-fi series in a way that appealed to a massive new audience. While the *Planet of the Apes* reboot series was seemingly done after *War for the Planet of the Apes*, this turned out not to be the case. 2024 will see the release of *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*, a continuation of Matt Reeves&#39; [*Planet of the Apes* timeline](https://screenrant.com/planet-apes-movie-timeline-explained/) that is set centuries after Caesar&#39;s age. The film will feature a new cast and crew, but it almost brought back one familiar face.

## Andy Serkis Playing A New Character In Planet Of The Apes Would Be A Mistake

While Caesar won&#39;t be returning in *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*, Andy Serkis&#39; time with the franchise was almost extended before the team behind the film changed their minds. Director Wes Ball revealed in an interview that the team behind [*Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* talked about bringing Andy Serkis back](https://screenrant.com/planet-of-the-apes-andy-serkis-future-movies-director-comment/) for the fourth film, although he would be playing a different motion-captured character. However, the team eventually changed their mind after deeming Andy Serkis &#34;*too iconic*,&#34; meaning that he won&#39;t be in the film. This is great news for fans of the franchise, as bringing Serkis back would have been a big mistake.

Bringing Andy Serkis back as a different character in *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* would have created all kinds of new problems, so it&#39;s a better decision for him not to come back at all. Sequels of live-action franchises would never recast their main actor as a different character, so it would be really weird for *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* to do this with Andy Serkis. Andy Serkis was an incredible part of the franchise for three epic movies, and bringing him back shows that *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* is too concerned with clinging onto the past rather than moving on.

## Planet Of The Apes&#39; Potential Andy Serkis Return Hurts His Work In Performance Capture

***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes\*&#39; potential Andy Serkis return is a huge disservice to the motion capture art form**, with it hurting Serkis&#39; performance capture work. By recasting Andy Serkis as a completely different character, *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* would be making it seem like audiences can&#39;t tell who Serkis is, which isn&#39;t the case. Although Caesar is a CGI character, the performance choices and minute details that Serkis put into his role as Caesar make it impossible to separate the two. Having Serkis play another character would just feel off, as it would hurt this link with Caesar.

On top of hurting Andy Serkis&#39; work, bringing Serkis back for *Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes* would also hurt the field of motion capture as a whole. Serkis is a talented actor, but he has served his time in the *Planet of the Apes* franchise. Bringing him back would mean that another talented motion capture performer wouldn&#39;t get the chance to play that role. [*Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*](https://screenrant.com/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-release-date-cast-story-details/) is one of the most large-scale performance capture movies ever, so it should take the opportunity to shine a spotlight on talented performance capture artists rather than reusing ones audiences already know.

## Caesar Is Why Andy Serkis&#39; Planet Of The Apes Return Can&#39;t Happen

Although Andy Serkis is a wonderful talent, **Caesar is why he can&#39;t return to the \*Planet of the Apes\* franchise**. Caesar died at the end of *War for the Planet of the Apes*, meaning that Serkis&#39; involvement with the franchise died with him. As has already been laid out, recasting Serkis is a horrible idea, meaning that his only route for returning to the franchise is as Caesar. Caesar&#39;s death in *War for the Planet of the Apes* is the culmination of three movies of build-up, and filming new scenes with him for ***Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes*** would really undermine his death.
