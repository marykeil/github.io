## Literature Review

Kang is the obvious threat of the Multiverse Saga, but one villain parallels Thanos&#39; MCU trajectory and feels like a much more fitting replacement.




The Marvel Cinematic Universe is setting up a new villain to take Thanos’ place, and it is surprisingly not Kang. Kingpin might seem like just a crime lord from New York City, but he actually draws plenty of similarities to the Mad Titan. The character was first introduced in Daredevil but made his official MCU Kingpin debut in Hawkeye. Wilson Fisk is a powerful businessman and crime lord who has great influence in New York City, as Hawkeye showed how his influence affected characters like Clint Barton and Maya Lopez.




Though Kang is the obvious villain being set up as the Multiverse Saga’s final battle, Kingpin is the one who feels more like a successor to Thanos in the current MCU timeline. There are plenty of parallels between the two characters already in terms of personality and influence. Especially since Kingpin is confirmed to play a role in upcoming MCU projects, it’s safe to say that he will be sticking around for a while and there is time to build up his reign.

                  Every MCU TV Show Ranked Worst To Best   From WandaVision to She-Hulk, from Loki to Ms. Marvel, the MCU&#39;s Disney&#43; TV shows have been hits - but how do they all compare to one another?   


 MCU&#39;s Kingpin Build-Up Mirrors Thanos&#39; Infinity Saga Setup 
          

Though Thanos was always the ultimate threat of the early MCU, he didn’t actually make his proper villain introduction until Avengers: Infinity War. Up until that point, he either made cameo appearances in mid and post-credit scenes or was mentioned by other MCU characters. Despite not making a full-fledged appearance until Infinity War, Thanos already felt established because of all of the Infinity Saga build-up.




With how the MCU is utilizing Kingpin, he is set to follow a similar trajectory, with several smaller MCU appearances slowly building his legacy. Kingpin&#39;s villainous endeavors are made even clearer in Echo, which appears set to lead into his storyline in Daredevil: Born Again, with rumors of him even appearing in Spider-Man 4. These early appearances are effectively building up Kingpin’s legacy until his proper villain debut, just as Thanos was set up for his proper Infinity War introduction.



 Why Kingpin Is The MCU&#39;s New Thanos 
          

Besides their MCU trajectories being quite similar, Thanos and Kingpin actually have a lot in common in terms of their actual character traits. They share the same ultimate goal of building a better world, having to do whatever it takes to achieve that. Thanos infamously wanted to erase half of the universe to give a better life to the remaining population. Kingpin wanted to rebuild his hometown of Hell’s Kitchen by tearing it down and rebuilding it free of crime.




However, while both characters have good intentions in a way, they are ultimately corrupted in their methods, which led to them becoming morally questionable individuals. Even in the crimes they committed, their similar personalities shine through. Both are incredibly charismatic when they need to be, which is evident in the influence they have over their followers and how they’re able to take control so easily. They even have a similar strong physical presence which, despite Kingpin not being purple, plays a part in their intimidation of their enemies.



 How Echo Proves Kingpin Can Be The MCU&#39;s New Thanos 
         

Echo goes some way to flesh out Kingpin&#39;s MCU goals and story, as the Echo season 1 post-credits suggest Wilson Fisk will be running for New York City mayor in the franchise&#39;s future - and given he becomes the mayor in Marvel Comics, it very much appears he might just win. This looks to be the setup for Daredevil: Born Again, and allows Fisk to continue to amass even more power, becoming a consistently more threatening figure in the current MCU villain roster. Not only is this formula similar to Thanos steadily collecting power on his own terms with the Infinity Stones, but it also reflects the way in which the audience were shown the character - as viewers grow more and more aware that Kingpin is a major issue that Marvel&#39;s live-action heroes are going to struggle to contend with.






Kingpin&#39;s Marvel Comics Mayor storyline saw him attain the role by rigging the vote, which could set up a suitable drama for Daredevil: Born Again by giving Matt Murdock a reason to use his superhero alias and his civilian lawyer skill sets.






 Why The MCU Needs Kingpin As Thanos&#39; Replacement 
          

In terms of scale, Kang seems like the obvious Thanos replacement, as they are both threats of the same scale. However, Kingpin’s trajectory as Thanos’ replacement not only makes sense but also brings something new to the MCU. Not every huge MCU villain can be some big cosmic threat, or audiences will get bored. The grounded human villains always have an aspect of relatability to them that is effective with audiences, such as Zemo and Killmonger. Kingpin may not be a threat to the galaxy, but he carries enough of the same energy as Thanos while still being human.




After Thanos’ reign ended in Avengers: Endgame, Kang started being set up as the Multiverse Saga’s ultimate big bad. However, Kingpin’s appearances in Daredevil, Hawkeye and Echo so far put him on a similar trajectory as Thanos’ MCU build-up. He has plenty of similar character traits to Thanos, even down to their supposed goal of making the world a better place. The MCU looks to be keeping Kingpin around for a while, and the franchise will greatly benefit from a Thanos-like threat that is grounded and human.
