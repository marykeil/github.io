## Literature Review

The 2024 Golden Globe Awards were held a couple of months before the Oscars, and the winners indicate what could happen at the upcoming ceremony.




The 2024 awards season kicked off with the 81st Golden Globe Awards on January 7, and following the ceremony, it is a bit easier to make predictions for the upcoming 96th Academy Awards. Historically, the Golden Globes paint a clearer picture regarding the true contenders for not only the Oscar nominees but also the frontrunners to win categories like Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and so on. Of course, the Academy Awards do not always align with the Golden Globe Awards since they are run by two different organizations with two different sets of voters. However, there is no denying that the Globes set a precedent for the rest of the awards season.
The winners at the 2024 Golden Globes could continue their triumphant runs at upcoming award ceremonies, like the 29th Critics&#39; Choice Awards, the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards, the 96th Oscars, and more. The Globes are truly only the beginning of a long run of ceremonies celebrating the best in film in 2023. Once the Oscar nominees are announced (which will take place on January 23), publications can make their official predictions for the winners, and the Golden Globe victors will undoubtedly be a factor when making projections.









 








 5  Is Ryan Gosling No Longer The Frontrunner To Win Best Supporting Actor? 


 







The nominations for the 96th Academy Awards have not been announced yet. Still, many experts expect Ryan Gosling to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Ken in Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie. He has also been the frontrunner to take home the Oscar in that category, but that might not be the case following the 81st Golden Globe Awards. Gosling was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture at the Globes, alongside Willem Dafoe for Poor Things, Charles Melton for May December, Robert Downey Jr. for Oppenheimer, Robert De Niro for Killers of the Flower Moon, and Mark Ruffalo for Poor Things. However, Gosling didn&#39;t win — Downey Jr. did.
Following the release of Barbie in the summer of 2023, the movie received a lot of praise, but Gosling&#39;s performance was at the forefront of the acclaim. Many expected him to dominate the Best Supporting Actor category in the 2024 awards season. But the Golden Globes suggest otherwise, with Downey Jr. pulling out a win for his role as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer, meaning that Gosling might not receive his first Oscar this year (and Downey Jr. could). The Best Supporting Actor race at the 2024 Oscars will be one to watch, that much we know.
            
 
 Golden Globes 2024 Nominations 11 Biggest Implications On The Oscars Race 
Even though the ceremonies are different, there&#39;s no doubt that the 2024 Golden Globes nominations will have a big impact on the upcoming Oscars race.








 4  Best Director Is Christopher Nolan&#39;s To Lose 
        

The 81st Golden Globe Awards confirmed one significant prediction that many believed was a certainty — Christopher Nolan has a 99.99% chance of winning Best Director for Oppenheimer at the 96th Academy Awards. Nolan has been the frontrunner to take home the directing Oscar since the 2023 epic biographical thriller film premiered. Nolan, Greta Gerwig, and Martin Scorsese (for Killers of the Flower Moon) are all but locked as nominees, and Nolan might as well start preparing his acceptance speech after taking home the Golden Globe for Best Director at the 81st ceremony.
Nolan has been nominated at the Academy Awards five times and only once for Best Director. As a result, many voters might be persuaded to give him the win. Of course, he did a fantastic job with Oppenheimer, which, along with Barbie, will receive many nominations at the 96th Oscars. So, Nolan undeniably deserves to take home the award for Best Director. But to be one of the best filmmakers of our generation and not have a win at the Academy Awards might give voters more of an incentive to fill in Nolan&#39;s name on their ballots. Gerwig and Scorsese could give him a run for his money, but the 2024 Globes suggest otherwise.





 3  Best Actress May Come Down To Emma Stone Vs. Lily Gladstone 
        

At the 81st Golden Globe Awards, Emma Stone won Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for her role as Bella Baxter in Poor Things, and Lily Gladstone won Best Performance in a Motion Picture – Drama for her role as Mollie Burkhart in Killers of the Flower Moon. Stone and Gladstone will undoubtedly be nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards, and it will likely be a close race between them. The one significant advantage that Gladstone may have over Stone is that she has never won an Oscar before, and Stone has (for La La Land). But the Best Actress category will be one to watch in the months leading up to the Oscars.





 2  Barbie Might Get Shut Out Of All The Major Categories 


 







Barbie will undoubtedly be a strong contender for numerous Oscar categories, like Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Original Song. However, the 2023 fantasy comedy movie&#39;s best shot at one of the &#34;major&#34; categories (like acting, directing, writing, and so on) is probably Ryan Gosling for Best Supporting Actor. But, as mentioned above, Gosling lost to Robert Downey Jr. at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, so he might not be the frontrunner anymore. Barbie might not win in any of these categories at the Oscars. Greta Gerwig could pull off an upset and win Best Director over frontrunner Christopher Nolan, but that&#39;s (unfortunately) unlikely.
Barbie didn&#39;t win in any of the big categories at the Globes. Gosling lost to Downey Jr. for Best Supporting Actor; Gerwig lost to Nolan for Best Director; Margot Robbie lost to Emma Stone for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy; Gerwig and Noah Baumbach lost to Anatomy of a Fall for Best Screenplay; and it lost Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy to Poor Things. Unfortunately, it&#39;s not looking good for the highest-grossing movie of 2023. Even if Barbie doesn&#39;t win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, and so on, Gerwig&#39;s masterpiece will undoubtedly take home at least one Oscar and be one of the most-nominated films at the 96th Academy Awards.
            
 
 All 7 Female Directors Nominated For The Best Director Oscar (&amp; Which Won) 
Over the course of the Oscars’ extensive history, only seven women have been nominated for Best Director at the awards show – who are they?








 1  Will Cillian Murphy Rob Bradley Cooper Of His First Oscar? 


 







Bradley Cooper has nine Oscar nominations (and will undoubtedly have more following the 96th Academy Awards nomination announcement). But he has never won at the prestigious ceremony. He has been nominated for Best Actor for Silver Linings Playbook, American Sniper, and A Star Is Born; Best Supporting Actor for American Hustle; Best Picture for American Sniper, A Star Is Born, Joker, and Nightmare Alley; and Best Adapted Screenplay for A Star Is Born. Cooper will likely receive more nods for Maestro, including Best Actor. But, if the 81st Golden Globe Awards are any indication, Cooper could lose to Cillian Murphy.
Some experts have released early predictions that Cooper will win his first Oscar in the Best Actor category at the 96th Academy Awards. However, with Murphy&#39;s win for Oppenheimer at the Globes, Cooper might lose once again. Murphy&#39;s chances of winning have increased following the 2024 Golden Globe Awards, and the Irish actor could be the new frontrunner for the upcoming Oscars ceremony.
The 96th Academy Awards will take place on March 10, 2024.
