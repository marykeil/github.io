## Literature Review
2024 will be a big year for Star Wars, with the franchise having several moments that stand out as events audiences cannot wait to see play out.




2024 is promising a handful of exciting events in the Star Wars galaxy across Lucasfilm&#39;s vast multimedia franchise. With 2023&#39;s Lucasfilm output being largely dominated by Disney&#43;, 2024 will only continue this via several upcoming Star Wars TV shows. Furthermore, 2024 will begin Phase III of The High Republic, an incredibly expansive interconnected story told across novels, books, comic books, and graphic novels. The exciting year for Star Wars is then expected to be even more thrilling with the announcements pertaining to upcoming Star Wars movies.
That said, the various announcements and projects of Star Wars in 2024 will vary in excitement. For example, 2024 will see a brand-new game being released in the Star Wars galaxy that ties intrinsically to two different Lucasfilm movies via Star Wars&#39; crime syndicates, something that could not be said for 2023&#39;s Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. With the ever-growing list of Star Wars releases in mind, here are the top 10 most exciting events from a galaxy far, far away in 2024 that audiences cannot wait to see play out.

 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.













 








 10  The Galaxy-Wide Heist Of Star Wars Outlaws 
Star Wars&#39; 2024 video game release will tie to a crucial era of the galaxy&#39;s timeline.
        

The 10th most exciting event of 2024 in the Star Wars universe is the heist of Star Wars: Outlaws. Star Wars: Outlaws is a video game that was confirmed to be in development in 2021 by Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment. The game&#39;s gameplay was first shown in June 2023, when Ubisoft confirmed Star Wars: Outlaws was aiming for a 2024 release along with some other interesting revelations about the game&#39;s story. Outlaws was confirmed to take place between the events of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi with players assuming the role of Kay Vess.
According to Ubisoft and Massive, Star Wars: Outlaws will center on Kay Vess amassing a crew of scoundrels to pull off the biggest heist the galaxy has ever seen. While this could easily go under the radar given the overwhelming overarching story of the Skywalker Saga, the time period between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi makes this more exciting. The hyperbole behind the heist in question and the setting of such a story in a previously unexplored era of the original trilogy makes Star Wars: Outlaws seem like one of the most exciting releases in 2024 Star Wars.
While Star Wars: Outlaws does not have a confirmed release date, the game received positive updates in June 2023 meaning a late-2024 release window is expected. 






 9  Skeleton Crew Will Introduce Another Major Jedi 
A new Force-wielder will be introduced to the era of the New Republic.
        

One of the two upcoming live-action Star Wars shows in 2024 is Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. The show is set to be part of the New Republic era, taking place concurrently with The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and The Book of Boba Fett. While Skeleton Crew does not have a locked-in release date, it is expected in 2024 with one detail revealed about the upcoming Disney&#43; series sure to be an exciting event in the Star Wars franchise.
At Star Wars Celebration 2023, it was confirmed that Jude Law will be playing a Jedi in Skeleton Crew. While Jedi permeate most stories in Star Wars, the inclusion of one played by an actor as renowned as Jude Law is certainly exciting. As such, Skeleton Crew&#39;s introduction of this Jedi character will be an incredibly exciting 2024 event based on the reveals of what Law&#39;s Jedi stands for, what his motivations are, and what role he will play in the wider story of the New Republic era.





 8  Star Wars Comics Expected To Move Beyond Return Of The Jedi After 8 Years 
Star Wars&#39; comic book stories will enter a new era in 2024.
        

Star Wars&#39; extensive comic book tales will continue in 2024, with an exciting event surrounding this being the inevitable exploration of the post-Return of the Jedi era of the timeline. The last comic book in Star Wars to explore events after Return of the Jedi was Star Wars: Shattered Empire in 2015. Since then, the franchise&#39;s comic stories have gone back over regarding their placement on the timeline, inching ever closer to George Lucas&#39; Episode VI. In 2024, the comic stories are expected to once again move beyond Return of the Jedi, making for an exciting event for those familiar with Lucasfilm&#39;s visual publishing catalog.





 7  Secrets Of The Nameless Revealed In Star Wars: The High Republic 
The High Republic Phase III will truly get underway in 2024.
        

Concerning Star Wars&#39; printed stories, The High Republic era has largely dominated since it began in 2021. The High Republic has been split into three Phases, with Phase III expected to carry over into 2024. At the tail end of Phase I, a mysterious dark side creature known only as the Nameless was introduced to the franchise, a creature that possesses the power to nullify Force users. Since then, little has been released about the Nameless, with Phase III&#39;s many High Republic stories in 2024 expected to divulge this information, making for an incredibly exciting event as a result.

 6  How Skeleton Crew Will Fit Into Star Wars’ New Republic Timeline 
How will the New Republic be shaped by 2024&#39;s installment into the sect of the Star Wars timeline?

That said, nothing has been revealed about Skeleton Crew meaning it is completely a mystery how the show will inform the New Republic&#39;s wider story. 

While Skeleton Crew&#39;s introduction of a New Republic Jedi will be an exciting event, perhaps even more compelling is seeing how the show will slot into the New Republic timeline. It is no secret that Star Wars&#39; New Republic stories are building towards Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming Star Wars film that will chronicle the battle between the New Republic and Grand Admiral Thrawn&#39;s resurgent Empire. Thus far, shows like The Mandalorian and Ahsoka have made it clear how they will tie into the overarching story being told.
That said, nothing has been revealed about Skeleton Crew meaning it is completely a mystery how the show will inform the New Republic&#39;s wider story. The premise of Skeleton Crew reads: &#34;Skeleton Crewfollows four kids who end up on an adventure to make their way home after being lost in the galaxy following a discovery they make on their home planet.&#34; This basic story outline is intentionally vague, forcing audiences to anticipate what exactly Skeleton Crew will be about. In light of this, the reveal of the show&#39;s New Republic connections is certainly one of the most exciting 2024 events in the Star Wars franchise.





 5  John Jackson Miller&#39;s Star Wars Return Will Reveal Secrets Of The Jedi Council 
Star Wars publishing royalty returns once more for an overly exciting book story.
        

Outside of the High Republic stories of 2024, Star Wars&#39; publishing media has another overwhelmingly exciting event in the coming year. The event in question is the return of John Jackson Miller, an exceptionally decorated writer in the world of Star Wars. Miller first stepped into Star Wars in 2005 when he wrote a one-off Dark Horse Comic story about Darth Vader. Later that year, Miller began writing a comic series entitled Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic which served as a spin-off to the game of the same name.
This series was a major success among fans and proved Miller to be one of Star Wars&#39; most well-received writers. This continued in 2012 when Miller wrote Star Wars: Kenobi, a book centering on the titular Jedi&#39;s time in exile on Tatooine. Miller was then responsible for writing the first canon book under Disney&#39;s Star Wars leadership titled Star Wars: A New Dawn, a prequel to Star Wars Rebels which centered on a younger Kanan Jarrus and Hera Syndulla. All of this success has made Miller the equivalent of Star Wars royalty concerning published stories in a galaxy far, far away.
As such, the announcement that John Jackson Miller would return to the franchise in 2024 with Star Wars: The Living Force garnered much excitement, making the book&#39;s release one of the most exciting events of the year. To further this excitement, it was announced that The Living Force would be set a year before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and center on the exploits of the Jedi Council. The premise of the book follows the twelve Jedi on the Council taking a group excursion to the planet of Kwenn where they encounter pirates and a changing galaxy at the onset of the prequels.





 4  Star Wars: The Bad Batch’s Ending 
One of the most compelling animated stories of Star Wars comes to a close in 2024.

While Skeleton Crew and The Acolyte will make up the live-action stories of Star Wars TV in 2024, Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3 will mark the end of the beloved animated show. Given that much of The Bad Batch&#39;s first two seasons were incredibly well-received, the ending of the show is easily one of the more anticipated events in the Star Wars galaxy for 2024. From the return of the titular Bad Batch to the further exploration of the state of the galaxy immediately after the Empire&#39;s formation, The Bad Batch season 3 will hopefully end the show on a high note.
One of the biggest strengths of Star Wars: The Bad Batch is its engaging characters. The titular Clone Force 99 and their relationship with Omega makes for one of the best character dynamics in the entire saga, which enabled The Bad Batch season 2 to have an unexpectedly emotional conclusion. As such, the promise of season 3 is that it will continue this emotional journey in what is sure to be an exciting event of Star Wars in 2024.





 3  The Acolyte Will Finally Explore The Sith’s Rise To Power 
The dark siders&#39; abilities will be shown in a way Star Wars has never done before.
        

Without a doubt, the most exciting aspect of 2024&#39;s Star Wars: The Acolyte is that the show will take live-action Star Wars somewhere it has never been before. The show is set in the High Republic era, with one extremely exciting event of 2024 set to be The Acolyte&#39;s exploration of the Sith&#39;s rise to power. The show will be set around 100 years before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace and will explore emerging dark side powers in the waning days of the High Republic.
Through this concept, The Acolyte will place a focus on the Sith in a way Star Wars never has. Usually, the Sith are shown from the eyes of Star Wars&#39; many heroes, be it the Jedi Order of the prequels or the Rebel Alliance and Resistance of the originals and sequels respectively. However, The Acolyte will completely reverse this and show the Sith&#39;s rise to power from the dark siders&#39; perspectives. What makes this event even more exciting is that little has been revealed about The Acolyte thus far, meaning 2024 will have a lot of anticipation regarding one of Star Wars&#39; upcoming Disney&#43; shows.





 2  The Acolyte’s High Republic Setting Will Finally Be Shown In Live-Action 
The Acolyte&#39;s setting is one of the more exciting aspects of Star Wars in 2024.for
        

Even more so than The Acolyte&#39;s promise of exploring the Sith, the show&#39;s setting in the final days of the High Republic is incredibly exciting. For the first time in live-action Star Wars, the clothing, vehicles, weapons, cities, and buildings of the High Republic publishing series will be shown. Seeing the iconic designs that have become part of Star Wars fans&#39; imagination come to life is one of the most compelling things about The Acolyte which provides a lot of promise for the franchise in 2024.
What makes this setting even more exciting is seeing the Jedi Order of the High Republic in live-action. The Jedi of the High Republic are often described as being at the peak of their powers as the Republic thrives. While The Acolyte will likely explore the downfall of this Jedi Order into the flawed organization shown in the prequels, some of the show will at least portray the High Republic Jedi at their best, exploring the galaxy with different styles, looks, weapons, and vehicles.





 1  Further Announcements Of Star Wars’ Upcoming Movies 
Star Wars&#39; return to the cinema screen will have plenty of updates in 2024.

Above all else, the most exciting event of 2024 in Star Wars will be the further announcements about upcoming movies. Despite no Star Wars feature films being scheduled for release in 2024, the three announced projects will likely go into development in the next few years. This means that 2024 will likely house several announcements from more details about Rey Skywalker&#39;s Jedi Order movie and Dave Filoni&#39;s New Republic project to the first glimpses at James Mangold&#39;s Dawn of the Jedi property.
One of the most exciting potential announcements is the confirmed cast of Rey&#39;s Jedi Order movie. Aside from Daisy Ridley, no one else has been cast in the film. With the project expected to be the first in production, the script will likely be finalized and other cast members will be announced to join Ridley in 2024. From these exciting revelations to the confirmed release dates of each upcoming Star Wars movie, 2024 has lots of exciting events in store be it from the world of feature filmmaking and the realm of TV to the video game stories in development or the continuation of Star Wars&#39; compelling High Republic Era.
