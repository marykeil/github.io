# Killers Of The Flower Moon Risks Repeating An Unwanted Martin Scorsese Record


## SUMMARY 



  Despite its acclaim, Killers of the Flower Moon risks falling into the trend of not winning any Oscars, just like Scorsese&#39;s previous film, The Irishman.   Lily Gladstone&#39;s performance in Killers of the Flower Moon has received consistent praise and could potentially save the film from being shut out at the Oscars.   While the screenplay and Gladstone&#39;s performance are strong, the film still faces tough competition, particularly from Emma Stone&#39;s performance in Poor Things, which may impact its chances of winning an Oscar.

## Literature Review

Despite Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s acclaim, Martin Scorsese&#39;s latest picture runs the risk of following an unfortunate trend for the director. 




Killers of the Flower Moon is Martin Scorsese&#39;s latest picture, and despite its acclaim, runs the risk of repeating the repeated an unwanted Scorsese trend. Killers of the Flower Moon, based on the book of the same name by David Grann, centers around the systematic slayings of the Osage Native Americans for their wealth in a three-and-a-half hour epic drama that meditates on the sheer power of human will through insurmountable odds. Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, and Lily Gladstone, Killers of the Flower Moon from start to ending, is just as gripping as its runtime is lengthy, offering viewers much to think about along the way.




Although Killers of the Flower Moon has received a lot of criticism, ranging from its runtime to the depictions of sensitive events, it is still positioned to perform well at the upcoming 96th Academy Awards amid a string of steep competition in Barbie, Oppenheimer, Poor Things, and The Iron Claw, to name a few. Irrespective of the competing films at the upcoming ceremony, Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s Lily Gladstone might make Oscars history on account of her deeply committed performance that saw her hold her own against her fellow acting giants. However, even with Gladstone&#39;s acclaimed performance, Killers of the Flower Moon risks running a bad Scorsese trend.

                  &#34;Not Bigger Than History&#34;: Killers Of The Flower Moon Star Responds To Criticism Over Movie&#39;s Focus   Killers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone responds to criticism over the film telling the Osage story through Ernest Burkhart&#39;s perspective.

Based on the 2004 Charles Brandt novel, I Heard You Paint Houses, Scorsese&#39;s 2019 epic gangster film, The Irishman, centers around an elderly man as he recounts his time as a hitman for the Italian-American mafia shortly after returning to the United States after World War II. Featuring an ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and Harvey Keitel, The Irishman was a return to form for Scorsese as it reunited him with some of his best collaborators and tackled some of his most reliable themes. However, despite the level of talent involved, The Irishman won zero Academy Awards despite being nominated for ten.

Although Killers of the Flower Moon is set in an entirely different time period and covers different subjects from The Irishman, it runs a similar risk of receiving multiple nominations while ultimately winning none. This is likely because its runtime, bleak subject matter, and poor performance at the box office make it difficult for the Academy Awards to place it above much more successful projects like Oppenheimer or Barbie. The Irishman&#39;s unconvincing de-aging effects, violence, and lengthy runtime hindered it from enjoying any substantial Oscars success, and Killers of the Flower Moon receiving similar criticisms implies it could suffer a similar fate.






 Lily Gladstone May Save Killers Of The Flower Moon From An Oscars Shut Out

Despite the criticisms of Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s runtime and violent imagery, Lily Gladstone&#39;s star-making performance as the Osage Native American Mollie Burkhart has been a consistent source of praise for the film since its theatrical release last year. Mastering the Osage dialect and ensuring as much accuracy was applied to her character&#39;s costume and makeup, Gladstone delivered a memorable performance, thus being one of a few things capable of securing an Oscar win. Furthermore, Killers of the Flower Moon&#39;s screenplay might garner an Oscar win as it was praised for its commitment to authenticity, as well as putting a spotlight on the little-known subjects covered.

In spite of the well-written script, electrifying score, amazing costumes, and Gladstone&#39;s performance, Killers of the Flower Moon still has the task of competing with Emma Stone&#39;s acclaimed performance as Bella Baxter in the sci-fi black comedy, Poor Things. While Gladstone outshined her fellow co-stars DiCaprio and De Niro, it remains to be seen how much sway that will have over the Academy&#39;s decision-making between herself and Stone&#39;s chances of winning the Oscar. While there&#39;s still time to win other awards, the pattern on display in Scorsese&#39;s The Irishman strongly suggests Killers of the Flower Moon could be the victim of the same unfortunate trend for Scorsese.
