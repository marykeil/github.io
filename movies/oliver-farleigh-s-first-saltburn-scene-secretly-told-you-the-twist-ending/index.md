## Literature Review

An early scene at Oxford between Oliver and Farleigh foreshadowed what would become of Felix and the Catton family in Saltburn&#39;s ending.





Summary

  Oliver&#39;s true intentions with Felix are subtly revealed through a literary reference in a tutoring session with Farleigh.   The reference to Robert Browning&#39;s &#34;My Last Duchess&#34; in the tutoring scene parallels Oliver&#39;s plans and experiences in Saltburn.   In the poem, a duke is implied to have killed his wife after pretending to love her in order to obtain her wealth, similar to Oliver and Felix&#39;s story.  







Oliver and Farleigh prove to be steady rivals throughout Saltburn, and their first big scene together subtly reveals the many twists confirmed in the movie’s ending. At the beginning of Saltburn, Oliver (Barry Keoghan) appears as a scholarship student at Oxford taken under the wing of the wealthy Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), who brings Keoghan’s character home to his family’s home of Saltburn for the summer. By Saltburn’s ending, it becomes clear that Oliver has been meticulously deceiving Felix and the Catton family the entire time, culminating in each of their deaths and Oliver’s inheritance of the estate.

However, Saltburn dropped plenty of clues to the twists and turns early on, with certain references and Easter eggs providing hints to the fates of the Catton family. One such scene foreshadowing the ending involves Saltburn’s survivor Farleigh (Archie Madekwe), Felix’s cousin and a fellow Oxford student who is banished from the estate after Oliver frames him for betraying the family. Even during their first real interaction at Oxford, Oliver and Farleigh are at odds in their efforts to maintain good graces with the Cattons. Back at Oxford, Oliver even subtly hints at his plans for Felix through a literary reference in a tutoring session with Farleigh.




                  1 Genius Saltburn Detail Foreshadowed Felix&#39;s Fate (&amp; You Probably Missed It)   Saltburn is packed with details that foreshadow the movie&#39;s biggest twists, and one subtle but brilliant one hints at Felix&#39;s tragic fate.   


 Oliver Discussing Browning&#39;s “My Last Duchess&#34; Poem In The Tutoring Scene Revealed His True Intentions With Felix 
          

When meeting with their professor early in the movie, Oliver and Farleigh discuss a paper he’s written, which makes reference to Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” poem. While seemingly a forgettable reference that’s partially drowned out by the ticking of a clock, the poem in question actually parallels many plot points of Oliver’s plans and experiences in Saltburn. Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess” follows a narrator describing his deceased wife and the time he spent with her, who are loosely based on the real Duke Alfonso of Ferrera and Lucrezia de Medici. Lucrezia, who came from a wealthy family, was rumored to have been poisoned by the duke, not unlike how Oliver ultimately poisons the wealthy Felix.






Saltburn is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video.




While the duke insists that he only wanted his wife and not the money that came from marrying her, the poem implies this isn’t accurate. Of course, becoming close with Felix and pretending to be in love with him was also part of Oliver’s plan, as the deaths of Felix and his family in Saltburn would lead to Oliver inheriting their fortune. The speaker of “My Last Duchess” also often describes his resentment of his wife, her affection for others, and others’ romantic affections for her, similar to Oliver’s jealousy over Felix. The duke ultimately keeps a portrait of his deceased wife in his home, much like how Oliver keeps a picture of himself with Felix played in Saltburn’s ending.

Farleigh always saw through Oliver, and this happened to be the case even when meeting with their professor. Felix&#39;s cousin criticized Oliver’s superfluous vocabulary and called him out on a lie, proving Farleigh would be the most difficult Catton family member for him to manipulate. This is confirmed to be true throughout Saltburn, with Farleigh ultimately surviving because he was expelled from Saltburn by Sir James rather than a murder attempt by Oliver. While Oliver did have to frame Farleigh for trying to sell the Cattons’ valuables in order to send him away, it’s clear that Farleigh never fell under Oliver’s spell in the movie.
