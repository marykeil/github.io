## Literature Review

One of Meryl Streep&#39;s most impressive achievements is that she is the only person in the history of the Academy Awards to surpass an Oscar milestone.




In the history of the Oscars, Meryl Streep is the only actress who has surpassed a significant award milestone. Often touted as one of the best actresses of all time, Meryl Streep started her acting career in 1975 in Trelawny of the Wells. In the early years of her career itself, she received everything from Tony Award nominations for stage performances to Primetime Emmy wins. Even her first Oscar nomination came in 1978 when she was only three years into her professional acting career.




Throughout the 80s and 90s, Streep&#39;s career soared to new heights as she continued taking up diverse roles while raking in multiple award nominations and wins. While she achieved several astonishing feats as an actress and even broke several records, one remains one of her biggest accomplishments. It highlights how Meryl Streep has reached an Oscar milestone that no other actor will likely surpass anytime soon.

                  Cate Blanchett Is The Only Actress Who Holds This Oscars Record She Set 16 Years Ago   Cate Blanchett boasts many Oscar nominations and wins, and in 2008, she became the first and only actress to achieve this one Academy Awards record.   


 Meryl Streep Is The Only Actor To Have Over 20 Oscar Nominations 
          

Since the inception of the Academy Awards, 188 actors have received three or more nominations in the two acting categories: Best Actor/Actress and Best Supporting Actor/ Actress. Of all the 188 actors, only five have 10 or more Academy Award nominations in the acting categories: Laurence Olivier, Bette Davis, Jack Nicholson, Katharine Hepburn, and Meryl Streep. While Nicholson and Hepburn rank second on the list with 12 nominations each, Meryl Streep lies miles ahead with a total of 21 nominations, making her the only actor nominated more than 20 times at the Oscars in the acting categories.




  2:10                       One Actress Won An Oscar 46 Years Ago With Only 5 Minutes Of Screen Time   An Oscars record was set 46 years ago thanks to an actress winning an Oscar after only having five minutes of screen time in a major 1977 contender.   



 Meryl Streep Has Only Won Three Oscars With All These Nominations 
          

17 of Meryl Streep&#39;s 21 Oscar nominations were in the Best Actress category, while the remaining 4 were in Best Supporting Actress. 21 Academy Awards is an impressive feat, highlighting Meryl Streep&#39;s acting forte and enduring impact on cinema. However, despite setting the record for the most number of nominations, the veteran actress does not have the highest number of wins under her belt. With three wins — two for Best Actress in a Leading Role in The Iron Lady and Sohie&#39;s Choice and one for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in Kramer vs. Kramer — Streep is among the 44 actors who have won two or more Oscars.




While Katharine Hepburn is the only actor who has won 4 Academy Awards, Meryl Streep is one of the six stars with three wins. Considering how Meryl Streep is still active, her impressive track record will continue to evolve, and she might even add another Oscar win to her collection. Even if she does not, her record of receiving 21 nominations at the Oscars is a testament to her unparalleled contribution to cinema, cementing her legacy as an actress.
