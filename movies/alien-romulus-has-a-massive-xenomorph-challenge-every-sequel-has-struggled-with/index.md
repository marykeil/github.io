## Literature Review

Alien: Romulus is the next film in the Alien franchise, but it must overcome one major Xenomorph challenge many of the films have struggled with.


Summary

  Alien: Romulus is the seventh film in the Alien franchise, directed by Fede Álvarez and set to release on August 16, 2024.   The film will focus on a new group of characters encountering the terrifying Xenomorphs, and it takes place in a previously unexplored time in the Alien franchise.   Alien: Romulus aims to return to the horror and thriller roots of the original Alien films, emphasizing suspense over showcasing the Xenomorphs to create a sense of dread and fear.  





Alien: Romulus, the latest sequel in the Alien franchise set to hit theaters in 2024, will face the same challenge each Alien sequel has faced over the last 40 years. The challenge centers around how the alien Xenomorphs are used and designed in the film. In cinema history, rarely have there been creatures or scenes more frightening than Xenomorphs or the method by which they attach to a human body before emerging as a more evolved creature, but most sequels have tried to expand or explain the creatures instead of searching for new and creative ways to portray just how terrifying they are.




Directed by Fede Álvarez, the latest installment in the Alien franchise looks to try and break free from the directions Ridley Scott took in 2012&#39;s Prometheus and 2017&#39;s Alien: Covenant and serve as a new standalone film about a group&#39;s treacherous encounter with Xenomorphs. After these more recent experimental entries into the franchise, the new Alien: Romulus cast will seek to get back to the horror and thriller roots of the first two Alien films and tell the story of fearful and helpless humans thrust into a situation where deadly aliens are hunting them in outer space. What Álvarez chooses to do with the design of the Xenomorphs could go a long way to determining how successful the movie can be.



Alien: Romulus will be released in theaters on August 16, 2024.





 What Will The Xenomorph Look Like In Alien: Romulus? 
          




There is much already known about Alien: Romulus, but what is not known in early 2024 are any details about the plot or what the Xenomorph or Xenomorph-adjacent characters will look like in the film. Each Alien sequel has tried to do something different with Xenomorphs ever since Aliens premiered as the first sequel to Alien in 1986. That movie introduced the concept of multiple Xenomorphs, and there have also been queen aliens, a human-alien hybrid, the snake creatures from Prometheus, and a host of other Alien-inspired creatures.

Alien: Romulus will be the first proper Alien film since 2017&#39;s Alien: Covenant, so the plan for how to re-introduce Xenomorphs back into the franchise is highly anticipated. The timeline of Alien: Romulus is set between the first two original films, so the prevailing thought is the Xenomorphs will represent more of the original creature design seen on screen in 1979 and 1986. However, it&#39;s possible that the original design will not be used and that more creative license will be used as Álvarez attempts to put his own spin on the Alien franchise. A lesson he can learn from the original film is that less is actually more when it comes to Xenomorphs.






 The Xenomorph(s) Shouldn’t Be The Focus Of Alien: Romulus 
          

There are many reasons why Alien: Romulus is a better idea than another Ridley Scott sequel, but the primary one centers around the franchise returning to its roots both in timeline and in tone. The original Xenomorph is rarely seen in the first film, and that is a significant reason why it works so well. Combining the suspense, anticipation, and frightening elements of other 1970s successes like Jaws and Halloween, Ridley Scott was able to craft a thriller that gave viewers a sense of dread and fear without showing the titular alien for much of the film. This model would be a recommended one for Fede Álvarez to follow as well.

Alien: Romulus has a chance to course-correct some of the wild swings that other Alien movies have taken since the Ripley era ended with Alien: Resurrection in 1997. This new film by Fede Álvarez will likely not spend time focusing on other Xenomorph breeds, their origin stories, or the exploration of how Xenomorphs came to be in the first place. Getting back to its roots of a pure space horror story with the original Xenomorphs will not only satisfy the cravings of Alien fans, but also do the franchise a good amount of justice after years of prequels and Alien vs. Predator films.
