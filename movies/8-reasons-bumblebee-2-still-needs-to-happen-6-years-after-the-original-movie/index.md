## Literature Review

It&#39;s been nearly 6 years since Travis Knight&#39;s Bumblebee hit the big screens, but there are 10 solid reasons why its sequel, Bumblebee 2, must happen.




Although it has been 6 years since Bumblebee hit the big screens, Bumblebee 2 still needs to happen for more reasons than one. Instead of following Michael Bay&#39;s recipe for churning out a visually pleasing blockbuster, director Travis Knight risked making Bumblebee stand out from its predecessors. Not only did he significantly reduce the number of action scenes in the film but also focused primarily on one Autobot character instead of portraying many of them.
Bumblebee&#39;s newfound direction may not have pleased everyone, but it did give the franchise a sense of tenderness and nostalgia it previously seemed to lack. However, after Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, it seems like the franchise has gone back to its old formulas and archetypes. Owing to this, it seems unlikely that Bumblebee 2 will ever happen. Despite its low odds, the Bumblebee sequel deserves to be considered for several reasons.
            
 
 Transformers Learned The Wrong Lesson From Bumblebee &amp; It&#39;s Worrying For The Future 
Bumblebee fared better with audiences than Transformers: Rise of the Beasts because the franchise didn’t learn the right lessons from its success.












 








 8  Bumblebee 2 Could Prove The Franchise Can Perform Well Both Critically &amp; Commercially 
Bumblebee is the best reviewed movie in the Transformers franchise
        

When it comes to box office numbers, the first three Michael Bay Transformers movies rank above all others, while Bumblebee remains the second lowest. However, when the Rotten Tomatoes scores of the Transformers movies are considered, Bumblebee is far ahead of the clan with a fresh rating of 91%. Bumblebee was such a big hit with the critics because of its emphasis on storytelling instead of pure bombastic spectacle. Its positive reviews proved that the Transformers movies did not have to be all about the Autobots and Decepticons going in all-out wars against one another and established that it deserved a sequel more than any other film in the franchise.

 7  Bumblebee 2 Could Prove Steven Spielberg Was Right About Transformers 
Bumblebee is in tandem with Steven Spielberg&#39;s vision for Transformers
        

Steven Spielberg had been a long-time fan of Transformers comics and cars, and he envisioned the movies as an intimate tale about a boy and his car. Although Michael Bay&#39;s first Transformers movie adopted Spielberg&#39;s vision to some degree, the film was characterized more by Michael Bay&#39;s signature explosions, car chases, and grand visual effects. Bumblebee is the only movie in the franchise that stayed true to Spielberg&#39;s ideas by portraying a storyline reminiscent of E.T. Like most Spielberg films, Bumblebee&#39;s character beats and narrative elements are so rich that they could easily serve as a foundation for an expanded sequel.
            
 
 Only 1 Transformers Movie Truly Honored Spielberg&#39;s Original Vision 
There’s one Transforms movie that garnered optimistic reviews from critics because it honored Steven Spielberg&#39;s original vision for the films.








 6  Bumblebee 2 Could Honor Elements From Transformers&#39; Original Lore 
Bumblebee featured the classic Gen-1 Transformers designs
        

Instead of treading the same path as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, Bumblebee adopted the classic G-1 Transformers designs from the original cartoon. This allowed the movie to resonate with audiences who grew up watching the original animated series and reading the comics. In many ways, because of Bumblebee&#39;s &#34;softer&#34; features in the movie compared to his counterpart from the Michael Bay films, the Autobot also seems more human. This made it hard not to empathize with him and his situation and admire his bond with Charlie. Bumblebee 2 would be the perfect opportunity for the franchise to reconnect with the original visual elements that made the animated series so great.
Transformers: Rise of the Beasts also adopts the G-1 designs for its Autobot characters. 






 5  Bumblebee 2 Could Further Reinvent The Transformers Live-Action Storytelling Formula 
Bumblebee has more heart &amp; less spectacle than the Michael Bay films


 







While there is still a place for action-packed flicks in the franchise, Bumblelee showed that the franchise could narratively evolve and offer emotionally-driven stories. 

Micheal Bay&#39;s Transformers movies and Steven Caple Jr.&#39;s Rise of the Beasts offered a visually stunning cinematic experience with their slam-bang action scenes. Bumblebee, in contrast, was a departure from the typical Transformers formula, establishing that the Transformers franchise can offer diverse stories that focus more on emotion and heart and less on spectacle. While there is still a place for action-packed flicks in the franchise, Bumblebee showed that the franchise could narratively evolve and offer emotionally-driven stories. Therefore, while future Transformers sequels may continue delivering the visually spectacular action the franchise promises, Bumblebee 2 could keep its storytelling roots strong with its emphasis on heart and character development.





 4  Bumblebee 2 Could Make One Transformers/GI Joe Crossover Theory Come True 
Bumblebee has the perfect setup for a Transformers/GI Joe crossover
        

When Bumblebee first premiered in 2018, viewers could not help but speculate how John Cena&#39;s Agent Barnes could be a secret G.I. Joe. The franchise could have harped on this theory and marked the inception of a Hasbro shared universe. Unfortunately, even though John Cena did not mind reprising his role in future Transformers movies, the franchise&#39;s producer, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, dismissed the theory. Bonaventura&#39;s disapproval makes it unlikely that the franchise will ever go down that route. However, Bumblebee 2 still has the perfect opportunity to give audiences what they want by bridging the gap between Bumblebee and the upcoming G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover.







 3  Bumblebee 2 Could Mark The Return Of Its Predecessor&#39;s Strong Cast 
Bumblebee&#39;s casting choices were brilliant


 







Although many factors contributed to Bumbleebee&#39;s critical success, the film would not have been half as exciting if it wasn&#39;t for its incredible casting choices. Both Hailee Steinfeld and Dylan O&#39;Brein did a brilliant job at portraying the alienation their respective characters felt. At the same time, even the on-screen chemistry between their characters felt authentic and grounded. While nearly all Transformers have made some decent casting choices, Bumblebee&#39;s cast members gave it an emotional anchor that the other films lack. Although John Cena appears briefly, he, too, wins a viewer&#39;s heart when he salutes Bumblebee out of respect. If Bumblebee 2 does not see the light of day, the stellar cast of the first film would sadly never return.





 2  Bumblebee Could Feature The Live-Action Franchise&#39;s Best Main Character 
Charlie Watson is arguably a better Transformers protagonist than Sam, Cade, &amp; Noah
        

Charlie Watson is perhaps the most memorable character in the franchise because Bumblebee takes time to develop her as a relatable protagonist. The movie gives a deeply emotional depiction of how she grieves about her father&#39;s demise and feels betrayed and alienated when her mother starts seeing someone else. To honor her father&#39;s memories, she turns to mechanics, which ultimately leads her to fixing Bumblebee. What initially began as a pursuit to hold on to her father&#39;s memories turns into something far more comforting when Bumblebee helps her deal with her loss and find her place in the world. Considering the emotional heft in her characterization, it would be a shame if she never returns for a Bumblebee sequel.
Since Bumblebee and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts are set in the same universe, Charlie Watson could return in the franchise&#39;s future installments, even if Bumblebee 2 does not happen. 






 1  The Live-Action Transformers&#39; Best Human-Autobot Pair Could Return in Bumblebee 2 
Bumblebee&#39;s has the most endearing live-action depiction of human-Transformer relationships
        

Sam Witwicky&#39;s dynamic with Bumblebee in the first Transformers movie is fun, but the film uses Bumblebee as a narrative device to drive Sam and Mikaela&#39;s romantic relationship. In Transformers: Rise of the Beasts, Mirage (voiced by Pete Davidson) is a great addition to the franchise&#39;s Autobot roster, but his relationship with Noah lacks depth. Bumblebee, on the other hand, almost humanizes its titular character without even giving him proper dialogue. This makes it hard not to swoon over Bumblebee&#39;s endearing relationship with Charlie. By bringing back both characters, Bumblebee 2 could help the franchise transcend further from the traditional human-Autobot dynamic established in the previous films.
        


  Bumblebee  
The sixth installment in the Transformers movie franchise, Bumblebee acts as both a spin-off and prequel to the series. Set in 1987, Bumblebee follows Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) after she discovers the injured Autobot scout, B-127. Nicknaming him Bumblebee, Charlie helps the iconic yellow Transformer to evade both the evil Decepticons and the efforts of Colonel Jack Burns (John Cena) to capture him.
