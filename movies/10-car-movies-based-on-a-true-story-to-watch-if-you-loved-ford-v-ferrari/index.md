Ken Miles&#39; death in Ford v Ferrari isn&#39;t too far off from what really happened - though the movie changes some details for storytelling purposes.












 








 The Hitch-Hiker (1953) 
The Tense Noir Based On The Billy Cook Murders
        

Road trip movies are a versatile car-centric subgenre and can provide everything from wacky family comedies to intense horror movies. The Hitch-Hiker falls closer into the latter category with his film noir that is based on a wild true story. It follows two men who go on a fishing trip, but after picking up a hitchhiker, the road trip turns a lot more sinister — and murderous.
The movie is inspired by the hitchhiker murders of Billy Cook, a killer who claimed six lives in 1928. Along with its more grim nature, the movie is about the freedom of the road and the growing car industry. Therefore, it has the thrilling aspect of cars for the genre lovers, but The Hitch-Hiker is also a great thriller.

Ford v Ferari is based a true story. Here&#39;s what you need to know about the cast as well as the real people they portray in the movie.








 The Great Race (1965) 
The Outlandish Contest Based On A Real Global Race
        

For viewers who love the comedic and racing aspect of Ford v Ferrari, the 1965 action-comedy The Great Race is a suitable followup that&#39;s also inspired by real events. The Great Race takes place in the early 20th century and is based on the 1908 race from New York to Paris. A precursor to wacky road racing movies like Cannonball Run, The Great Race has a lot of fun with the absurdity and epicness of the long race.
While it&#39;s nowhere near as grounded as Ford v Ferrari, The Great Race is an entertaining ride filled with old cars, a riveting story, and plenty of slapstick comedy. It&#39;s also about making the best automobile for the job, sharing that theme of the passion behind fast cars that are in movies like Ford v Ferrari.





 Bullitt (1968) 
Steve McQueen Races Around In A Mustang As An Iconic Movie Cop


 







  Bullitt  


  Release Date    October 17, 1968     Director    Peter Yates     Cast    Steve McQueen , Jacqueline Bisset , Robert Vaughn , Don Gordon , Robert Duvall , Simon Oakland     Runtime    114 minutes    


Bullitt is an action thriller that is not technically about cars. However, it is one of the favorite movies for car lovers as it is most famous for having one of the best car chases in cinema history. The movie stars Steve McQueen in one of his most iconic roles as Frank Bullitt, a cop in San Francisco. While this isn&#39;t a fully true story, Bullitt is based on a real-life detective, Dave Toschi, best known for his investigation of the Zodiac Killer.
The movie follows Bullitt&#39;s investigation of the murder of a key witness. While the plot is clever if a little forgettable, the real thrill of the movie is McQueen&#39;s cool-headed performance and the pulse-pounding car chase sequence through the streets of San Fransisco which leads to an explosive conclusion.





 Le Mans (1971) 
Steve McQueen&#39;s Take On The Race Ford V Ferrari Centers On
        

Steve McQueen was known for being a car lover and racing enthusiast in real life so it is not surprising that he has appeared in a few notable car movies. While Bullitt may have the more memorable car-centric action sequences, Le Mans is more cemented in the actual world of car racing. It is a look at the nail-biting 24-hour race which was also at the center of Ford v Ferrari, with Le Mans starring McQueen as one of the daring racers.
Le Mans dives deep into every inch of what it takes and what occurs during this huge race. This movie is as real as it gets when it comes to race-car driving, and McQueen actually tried to enter the race for real. It makes for a riveting and authentic cinematic experience.

 The Last American Hero (1973) 
A Moonshiner Turns Racecar Driver
        

There are a lot of very interesting characters in the world of racing, like Ford v Ferrari&#39;s Ken Miles, and some of the most fascinating have been explored in movies. The Last American Hero stars Jeff Bridges as a character inspired by racing legend Junior Johnson, a former moonshiner who competes as one of the best NASCAR racers in the world.
Bridges is always a likable lead, especially with characters whose ambition and love of life are larger than those around him. This movie is all about growth and ambition, and it&#39;s an intriguing tale as much as it is riveting. From running moonshine to driving on the NASCAR circuit, there are some spectacular car racing scenes.





 Days Of Thunder (1990) 
A Hotshot Racer Looks To Be NASCAR&#39;s Best


 







Days of Thunder isn&#39;t totally based on a true story, but the main character is loosely based on two racecar drivers, Tim Richmond and Geoff Bodine, with some of the scenes reflecting real-life events. Following their success with Top Gun, Tom Cruise and director Tony Scott looked to capture the same fast-paced excitement with their exploration of the world of NASCAR racing.
Once again, Cruise plays the hotshot in the driver&#39;s seat who has nothing to lose. However, he is also backed up by a stellar supporting cast with Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, and Robert Duvall. Tony Scott is a master filmmaker whose handling of the thrilling race sequences is the clear highlight of the movie.

 Senna (2010) 
A Documentary About An F1 Tragic Icon
        

Among the great sports documentaries, there are not too many that focus on the world of racecar driving. However, Senna is not only a thrilling and fascinating movie for fans of the sport, but it is also gripping for people who have no connection to racing at all. The documentary tells the story of Aryton Senna, the Brazilian Formula One icon, his rise to fame in the &#39;80s, and his tragic death. It has tons of intriguing footage and tells a story with many similar moments to Ford V Ferrari.

 Rush (2013) 
An F1 Rivalry As Intense As The Ford Ferrari Feud


 







Starring Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth, Rush tells the story of the rivalry between Formula One racers James Hunt and Niki Lauda, in the 1970s. Directed by Ron Howard, the movie is an action-packed look at the talented athletes who rise to the top of the sport and the harrowing races in which they compete.
The two main characters are wonderfully opposed and larger than life, with Hemsworth bringing Hunt&#39;s big personality and fun-loving energy, while Bruhl steals the show with Lauda&#39;s complex personality that can be annoyingly arrogant and impressively calculating. It remains an underrated sports drama, and the rivalry between the two central characters is as rich and complex as that of Ken Miles and Carroll Shelby.
