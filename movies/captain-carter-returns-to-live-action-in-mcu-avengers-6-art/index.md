Captain Carter returns to action in new MCU fan art suggesting Hayley Atwell&#39;s superhero could reappear in 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars. Hayley Atwell has portrayed Peggy Carter since 2011&#39;s Captain America: The First Avenger, but debuted as a super-soldier variant of Peggy in Marvel Studios&#39; What If...? season 1, having taken the super-soldier serum instead of Steve Rogers. Captain Carter has since become a staple of What If...?&#39;s multiversal storylines, and was gifted an even larger role in What If...? season 2 after appearing in live-action in 2022&#39;s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but the character&#39;s future in the MCU is unclear after What If...? season 2&#39;s finale.

Hayley Atwell&#39;s appearance in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness saw her portray a different version of Captain Carter, a member of Earth-838&#39;s Illuminati instead of the Guardians of the Multiverse.

 Captain Carter’s Live-Action Return Is More Likely After What If…? Season 2 
         

What If...? season 2 explored several new alternate realities and variant characters, but also focused on a few that had previously been introduced in What If...? season 1. While Strange Supreme became a formidable villain in the season finale, Hayley Atwell&#39;s Captain Carter saw some huge power upgrades, making her capable of defeating the powerful and mystical Strange. What If...? season 2&#39;s finale saw Captain Carter wield the six Infinity Stones, Hela&#39;s enchanted crown, her own vibranium shield and enhanced swords gifted to her by a Hulk-Thor crossover. This set her up to be one of the MCU&#39;s most powerful superheroes, which could prove vital to Avengers: Secret Wars.




Avengers: Secret Wars is expected to feature many heroes and villains from across the MCU&#39;s multiverse, including characters from Fox&#39;s X-Men Universe, Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe, and potentially even Marvel Studios&#39; own What If...?. With Captain Carter being one of the most prominent heroes in What If...?, it makes sense for her to be included in Avengers: Secret Wars, and with her recent power upgrades, she is more than capable of fighting alongside some of the main MCU&#39;s strongest heroes. Captain Carter&#39;s involvement in Avengers: Secret Wars hasn&#39;t yet been confirmed, but it&#39;s more than likely she&#39;ll have a major role to play in the Multiverse Saga&#39;s final project.
