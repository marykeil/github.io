Dan Levy’s directorial debut Good Grief features a variety of songs that take viewers through the journey of love, loss, and grief that the main character goes on. As shown in the Good Grief trailer, the Netflix movie follows Marc (Levy) throughout the year after his husband, Oliver (Luke Evans), dies unexpectedly and tragically. During this time, he leans on his best friends and takes them on a trip to Paris to celebrate the first anniversary of Oliver’s passing, where he is forced to confront a secret he’s been keeping.

For much of the Good Grief, Marc struggles to process his husband’s loss, compounded by his mother&#39;s death, which he felt he never truly grieved. However, with a little help from his friends and a new love interest, by the end of Good Grief, Marc learns to move on while still remembering and honoring those he lost. The Good Grief soundtrack has everything from holiday classics to songs the characters drunkenly sing at karaoke, all coming together to tell Marc’s story.

 When Every Song On The Good Grief Soundtrack Plays During The Movie 
        Jamael Westman, Himesh Patel, Ruth Negga, and Dan Levy in Good Grief   

“Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday” by William Bell – Good Grief features a strong cast with supporting actors including Ruth Negga, Himesh Patel, and more. The opening scene of Good Grief introduces the characters at a holiday party, where Oliver leads them in a singalong of “Everyday Will Be Like a Holiday” by William Bell. It is one of the film&#39;s most joyous scenes as it takes place just before Oliver’s untimely death.




“A Whiter Shade of Pale” by Procol Harum – At the end of the holiday party, Oliver says goodbye to Marc for what he’s unaware will be the final time. Outside their window, the party-goers hear a car crash and Marc recognizes the cab his husband had just entered. In his shock, he runs out to the scene to try and see him as “A Whiter Shade of Pale” by Procol Harum plays in the background.

“With Every Heartbeat” by Robyn – Marc&#39;s friends convince him to attend an art gallery, and while he’s initially miserable, he meets a stranger who brightens his mood. The chance meeting at the gallery to the sounds of “With Every Heartbeat” by Robin between Marc and Theo sparks an interesting romance that helps Marc heal from his losses. 

“It’s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” by Andy Williams – When Marc meets with his financial advisor for lunch in Good Grief, “It’s The Most Wonderful Time of the Year” by Andy Williams plays in the cafe. It’s an ironic song choice as he learns that Oliver had secretly kept a home in Paris where he was carrying out an affair.




“Eyes Without A Face” by Billy Idol – Thomas, Marc, and Sophie arrive in Paris for their vacation to celebrate one year without Oliver, with “Eyes Without A Face” by Billy Idol, which has some lyrics in French, playing over the montage.

“Heartbeat” by Annie – Marc and Thomas find Sophie dancing and smoking in the kitchen to “Heartbeat” by Annie as she ambushes them with the news that they’ll be going on a group date together.

“Sortir ce soir” by Étienne Daho – The French song “Sortir ce soir” by Étienne Daho, which translates to “going out tonight,” plays at the restaurant during the somewhat disastrous date that Sophie drags them on.

“We Belong” by Pat Benatar – Their dinner in Good Grief is followed by karaoke, where a drunk Sophie kicks things off by leading the group in a singalong of Pat Benatar’s 80s hit, “We Belong.”

“Just Another Day” by Jon Secada – Sophie’s performance is followed by one from Thomas, in a rare glimpse of him letting loose with the aid of alcohol and drugs. His song choice is “Just Another Day” by Cuban singer Jon Secada.




“This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore” by Elton John – In a callback to a previous scene where Marc shared a memory about the song “The Train Don’t Stop There Anymore” by Elton John, he sings the ballad in honor of Oliver. The performance takes place at 2 a.m., the exact time at which Oliver had died the year before. It’s a bittersweet moment as everyone joins in to sing out the ballad before Marc leaves and kisses Theo.



Before hitting it big with Schitt’s Creek, Dan Levy sang an original song, &#34;Lonely Christmas, &#34; which is on YouTube.




“Only Love Can Break Your Heart” by Neil Young – In another tribute to Oliver in Good Grief, Sophie puts on “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” by Neil Young during dinner. Together, they toast to “the pain” and she finally reveals that Terrence left her, not the other way around as she’d led them to believe.




“Hope” by Haerts – The final song in Good Grief plays as Marc goes home after meeting up with Sophie sometime after their Paris trip. They’re both in better places; Sophie is back with Terrence and Marc has decided to sell his and Oliver’s London home. When he gets home, Marc sees the for sale sign and imagines Oliver at the doorstep, allowing him to finally get some sort of closure.
