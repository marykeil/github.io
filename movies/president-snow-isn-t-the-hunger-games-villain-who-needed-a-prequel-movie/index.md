# President Snow Isn t The Hunger Games Villain Who Needed A Prequel Movie


## SUMMARY 



President Coin&#39;s story is more interesting because her morals are ambiguous and her transformation from good to evil would be compelling to explore.

Coin&#39;s story raises important moral questions about the ends justifying the means and the complexities of fighting against oppression.

A President Coin prequel movie would provide a unique setting, showcasing District 13 and other districts that haven&#39;t been explored in previous Hunger Games films.

## Literature Review
The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes impressed audiences with President Snowâ€™s backstory, but another Hunger Games president also deserves a movie.
