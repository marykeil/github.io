## Literature Review

In Saltburn, Oliver has an incredibly embarrassing moment at breakfast over the state of his eggs, but what deeper meaning lies beneath this scene?




While Emerald Fennell&#39;s latest film, Saltburn, is full of intense scenes that bring up countless uncomfortable emotions, one troubling scene that is likely to not be discussed enough is Oliver&#39;s egg scene, and the deeper meaning that underlies it. Saltburn is a thriller comedy that came out late in 2023. Saltburn&#39;s movie cast includes Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike, and Carey Mulligan. The movie tells the story of Oliver, an awkward and down-on-his-luck Oxford student that starts an unlikely friendship with cool, seductive, and rich Felix. When Felix invites Oliver to his estate for the summer, their friendship takes various twists and turns.




Although there are many twisted moments in Saltburn to unpack, one scene in particular that has a very interesting meaning is the one in which Oliver orders eggs for breakfast. On his first morning at Saltburn, Oliver sits down for breakfast and tries ordering his food from Duncan. Awkwardly, Felix&#39;s family tells him that the food is on a table in the corner. Then, when Oliver wants eggs, he is told he must order those from Duncan, and he asks for them over easy. When they arrive, Oliver uncomfortably explains that he can&#39;t eat them because runny yolks make him sick. Ultimately, the scene is excruciatingly awkward.


 Saltburn&#39;s Egg Scene Shows How Out Of Place Oliver Is (Was It Part Of His Plan?) 
          

Aside from being another scene wherein Oliver feels uncomfortable around the Cattons, the egg scene emphasizes how out of place Oliver is. It is clear that Oliver has less money than Felix, and in this way, is not familiar with Saltburn&#39;s customs of dressing for dinner and throwing extravagant parties. However, the egg scene shows that even something as mundane as eggs is out of Oliver&#39;s wheelhouse. For example, he asks for eggs over easy, and though they come to him looking more sunny side up, either way, the eggs have a runny yolk. Oliver likely said something to sound impressive, and as a result, got what he couldn&#39;t have.




By the end of Saltburn, it becomes clear that much of Oliver&#39;s time at Saltburn was a performance in order to steal the estate, which raises the question: was the egg scene part of Oliver&#39;s plan? Ultimately, there is no true way of knowing, however, it would make sense that Oliver could have ordered the wrong eggs on purpose so that the Cattons would pity him. This is a move similar to when he pretended to not have money at the bar so Felix would help him out. Of course, Oliver could have truly not known anything about eggs as well. Either way, the scene accomplished its desired effect.



 Saltburn&#39;s Egg Scene Shows Oliver He Needs To Take What He Wants 
          

In many ways, the egg scene in Saltburn is also a turning point for Oliver. By turning down the eggs, he is creating an awkward situation, but he is also seeing that, at Saltburn, he can get whatever he wants. Though it may feel uncomfortable for him, and for the audience, getting exactly what you want is typical for the Cattons. Therefore, after the egg scene, Oliver starts to do what he wants to do, and in turn, has the ability to manipulate the Cattons as he sees fit. Things become easier for him at Saltburn when he begins acting like a Catton, and ultimately, that is the family&#39;s downfall.






Oliver&#39;s wardrobe reflects the casual dressing of the British elite. In the first scene, he stands out in a formal academic outfit amidst others in sweatsuits and jeans. As he tries to blend in with the wealthy peers, Oliver&#39;s attire gradually transitions to a more laid-back style.




              Saltburn  7 / 10   Written and directed by Emerald Fennell, Saltburn is a 2023 comedy-thriller film. When Oxford student Oliver Quick is invited to his friend Felix&#39;s family&#39;s wealthy estate, Saltburn, for a summer vacation, he is drawn into the world of eccentric characters and increasingly chaotic events as his obsession with Felix comes to a head.
