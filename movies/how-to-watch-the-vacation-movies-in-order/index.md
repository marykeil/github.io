## Literature Review
The Vacation movies detail the comic misadventures of the Griswolds but due to a lack of title numerals, it can be tricky to know the order to watch.




National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation is a vintage comedy franchise beginning in the 1980s, though the lack of numerals makes it tricky to know which order to view them in. Chevy Chase is a comedy icon, which was clear from his appearances on the first season of Saturday Night Live. Chase would go on to a string of movie hits, including Foul Play, Caddyshack and Fletch. Unfortunately, Chase also has a reputation for being difficult to work with, so after a string of movie duds in the &#39;90s like John Carpenter&#39;s Memoirs of an Invisible Man, he was largely relegated to supporting roles or cameos.
Still, his movie star heyday yielded some classics, including National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation. Directed by Harold Ramis (Groundhog Day) and written by John Hughes (The Breakfast Club), the film detailed a disastrous family vacation, led by Chase&#39;s optimistic patriarch, Clark Griswold. The Vacation movies became a reliable franchise for Chase and co-star Beverly D&#39;Angelo, with both returning for every subsequent installment - bar the black sheep of the saga.

John Hughes based National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation on a short story he penned for the titular magazine, and the film proved to be a huge success upon release. For Chase,Vacation proved to be a franchise he could dip in and out of periodically throughout the &#39;80s and &#39;90s. Of the six entries in the franchise, the fourth and sixth outings Vegas Vacation and the 2015 reboot are notable for lacking the National Lampoon branding.
Chevy Chase and Beverly D&#39;Angelo also reunited for 2010 short film Hotel Hell Vacation. 

According to a 2015 article by Slate, Warner Bros opted to remove the National Lampoon title from Vegas Vacation due to a falling out between the studio and that sequel&#39;s producers. As for the 2015 film, National Lampoon had nothing to do with its development. Like any long-running franchise, it has its share of weaker outings, though it&#39;s the rare example where many fans consider the third outing National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation to be the best.

 1  Vacation Movies In Chronological Order Of Events 
National Lampoon&#39;s Vacation (1983)
        

Box Office: $61 million | Runtime: 1 hour, 38 minutes
Cast: Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D&#39;Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Anthony Michael Hall (Rusty), Dana Barron (Audrey), Imogene Coca (Aunt Edna), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), John Candy (Russ), Christie Brinkley (Girl in Red Ferrari), Eddie Bracken (Roy Walley), Eugene Levy (Ed)
The first entry is the quintessential family road trip movie, where Clark and Ellen take their children on a cross-country outing to visit the suspiciously Disneyland-esque theme park Walley World. Despite their best-laid plans, the family is beset by a series of disasters, which includes their Aunt Edna dying along the way and Clark having to force his way into Walley World at gunpoint. The Harold Ramis-directed movie balances dark humor with some genuine sweetness, which made the Griswold family oddly endearing.
National Lampoon&#39;s European Vacation (1985)
        

Box Office: $49 million | Runtime: 1 hour, 34 minutes
Cast: Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D&#39;Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Jason Lively (Rusty), Dana Hill (Audrey), William Zabka (Jack), John Astin (Kent), Paul Bartel (Mr. Froeger), Cynthia Szigeti (Mrs. Froeger), Eric Idle (The Bike Rider), Jeannette Charles (Queen Elizabeth II), Peter Hugo (Prince Charles), Julie Wooldridge (Princess Diana), Willy Millowitsch (Fritz Spritz), Erika Wackernagel (Helga Spritz)
The original was produced during an era where sequels to hit movies weren&#39;t exactly a given, but work quickly pressed ahead on National Lampoon&#39;s European Vacation. This entry sees the family winning a two-week trip to Europe on a game show and visiting London, Germany and Italy. Neither Ramis nor Hughes returned for the follow-up, with Fast Times at Ridgemont High&#39;s director Amy Heckerling taking over. National Lampoon&#39;s European Vacation leans heavily on farce but while it scores some laughs it&#39;s not as funny as its predecessor.
The movie also recast the Griswold children, which proved to be the case with every sequel. Dana Hill took over as Audrey from Dana Barron, while Jason Lively inherited &#34;Rusty&#34; from Anthony Michael Hall. The sequel was a success but still grossed less than the original. European Vacation is now regarded as something of a middling entry, but compared to some of the movies in the series, it at least has some memorable gags.
National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation (1989)


Close







Box Office: $73 million | Runtime: 1 hour, 37 minutes
Cast: Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D&#39;Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Johnny Galecki (Rusty), Juliette Lewis (Audrey), John Randolph (Clark Sr.), Diane Ladd (Nora), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), E. G. Marshall (Arthur), Doris Roberts (Frances), Sam McMurray (Bill), Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Margo), Brian Doyle-Murray (Frank Shirley)
National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation saw Hughes return to pen the screenplay, while Jeremiah S. Chechik took over the director&#39;s chair. This third adventure for the Griswolds was originally supposed to be helmed by Chris Columbus, who apparently begged to exit the film due to issues with Chase; Hughes later gave Columbus the screenplay for Home Alone instead. National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation sees Clark attempt to give his family an incredible Christmas, but as is the franchise&#39;s formula, his plans go awry, leading to comic hijinks.

While the first film is held in high regard, Christmas Vacation is now considered the high point of the saga. It&#39;s an entry where everything clicks, from the perfectly pitched comic performances to the writing and the capturing the feel of a classic Christmas movie. It also features the starriest duo to take on the roles of the Griswold children, with Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear) and The Big Bang Theory&#39;s Johnny Galecki playing Audrey and Rusty respectively.
Vegas Vacation (1997)


Close







Box Office: $36 million | Runtime: 1 hour, 33 minutes
Cast: Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D&#39;Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Ethan Embry (Rusty), Marisol Nichols (Audrey), Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), Wayne Newton (Self), Wallace Shawn (Marty), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), Sid Caesar (Mr. Ellis), Christie Brinkley (Girl in Red Ferrari), Juliette Brewer (Ruby Sue Johnson), Jerry Weintraub (Jilly from Philly)
This fourth installment marked the end of the Chevy Chase-fronted era, and the first to drop National Lampoon from the title. As the title indicates, the Griswolds head to Vegas and get involved in a tiresome series of events. Hughes had no involvement with this sequel&#39;s development and only learned it was happening when reading about it in the trades.
Vegas Vacation cast Marisol Nichols and Ethan Embry as Audrey and Rusty, while Christie Brinkley returned as &#34;Girl in the Red Ferrari&#34; from the original film. Arriving nearly a decade on from the third film and at the tail end of Chase&#39;s movie star career, Vegas Vacation was a box office letdown that received largely poor reviews.
National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation 2 (2003)
        

Box Office: N/A | Runtime: 1 hour, 23 minutes
Cast: Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie), Miriam Flynn (Cousin Catherine), Jake Thomas (Clark), Dana Barron (Audrey), Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), Beverly Garland (Aunt Jessica), Fred Willard (Professor Doornitz), Sung Hi Lee (Muka Luka Miki), Eric Idle (English Victim)
The black sheep of the franchise in more than one, National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation 2: Cousin Eddie&#39;s Island Adventure is a TV movie spinoff from the third movie. As the title suggests, Randy Quaid&#39;s Cousin Eddie is the main character, while neither Chase nor D&#39;Angelo return as Clark or Ellen; that said, Dana Barron returns as Audrey for the first time since the original.
Cousin Eddie&#39;s Island Adventure is a cheaply made affair with almost no laughs and some terrible greenscreen effects. Eddie works best as a supporting player, which his promotion to main character only underlines. No matter how disappointing some of the main entries might be, none ever sank as low as National Lampoon&#39;s Christmas Vacation 2. It also remains, to date, the last outing with National Lampoon in the title.
Vacation (2015)
        

Box Office: $107 million | Runtime: 1 hour, 39 minutes
Cast: Ed Helms (Rusty), Christina Applegate (Debbie Griswold), Skyler Gisondo (James), Steele Stebbins (Kevin), Chevy Chase (Clark Griswold), Beverly D&#39;Angelo (Ellen Griswold), Chris Hemsworth (Stone), Leslie Mann (Audrey), Charlie Day (Chad), Norman Reedus (Trucker), Ron Livingston (Ethan), Keegan-Michael Key (Jack), Regina Hall (Nancy)
An-star revival of the Vacation series, where The Office&#39;s Ed Helms plays the adult Rusty, who is taking his own family on a trip to Walley World. Leslie Mann plays Audrey this time with Chris Hemsworth as her husband Stone, while Chase and D&#39;Angelo make guest appearances as Clark and Ellen. While Vacation did solid business, its oddly mean-spirited tone and lack of wit saw it greeted with mixed reviews, and it has yet to receive a sequel.
