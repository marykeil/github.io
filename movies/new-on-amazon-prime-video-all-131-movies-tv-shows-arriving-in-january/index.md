The Latest Fast Saga Movie And The Coen Brothers&#39; Spy Comedy
   Close     

  Burn After Reading (2008)   Fast X (2023)  

The latest installment in the Fast Saga drops on Prime Video on January 16. Fast X is the tenth entry into the international blockbuster series which has come a long way from its humble street racing origins. This latest chapter brings in one of the most memorable villains of the Fast Saga with Jason Momoa&#39;s Dante Reyes stealing the show as he goes on a mission of revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family. Though the movie disappointed at the box office, it is a typical bombastic and wild franchise entry that sets up the next chapter with a cliffhanger ending and the tease of some returning favorites to the series.

Fast X will also be joined by one of the most underrated movies from the Coen Brothers. Burn After Reading is the filmmakers&#39; screwball take on a spy story with an all-star cast that includes John Malkovich, Frances McDormand, George Clooney, and Brad Pitt in the story of a bunch of dim-witted characters who find themselves wrapped up in a strange espionage case.
