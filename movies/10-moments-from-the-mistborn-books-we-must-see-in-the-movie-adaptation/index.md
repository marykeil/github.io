## Literature Review

There are plenty of exciting moments to look forward to in the Mistborn movie adaptation, but some scenes will hit particularly hard on-screen.




The Mistborn movie has plenty of great moments to pull from Brandon Sanderson&#39;s best-selling books, and fans of the fantasy series will no doubt enjoy seeing their favorite scenes brought to life on-screen. Mistborn tells a magic heist story about a group of thieves overthrowing an empire ruled by a corrupt tyrant, and its messages about oppression and resistance are incredibly compelling. The series&#39; appeal goes far beyond its premise though, as Mistborn boasts great characters, relationships, and action throughout.
If a Mistborn movie succeeds, it could spawn an entire franchise based on Sanderson&#39;s Cosmere, setting fantasy up to be as successful as superheroes. This will start with the original Mistborn trilogy, which is arguably some of the author&#39;s best work. There&#39;s no shortage of great moments throughout the original three books, and some will be especially exhilarating to see in a movie format.
            
 
 7 Problems A Mistborn Series Could Fix From The Books 
Brandon Sanderson’s Mistborn books weave a compelling narrative, but they do have a few issues that a long-form TV series would have time to address.












 








 10  Vin &amp; Kelsier&#39;s First Allomancy Training 
The Final Empire
        

Mistborn&#39;s metal-based magic system, known as Allomancy, is one of the strongest elements of Sanderson&#39;s books. Although relaying how all the different metals work will be a challenge for the Mistborn movie, seeing Vin and Kelsier fly through the air and use their powers will be exciting. Not all movies excel at training sequences, but executed correctly, the first one between Kelsier and Vin will be a visual marvel. It will also establish them as characters, setting the stage for their growth over the course of the first film.





 9  Vin &amp; Kelsier&#39;s Pewter Drag 
The Final Empire
        

Witnessing Vin and Kelsier&#39;s Allomancy on-screen will be a satisfying experience for longtime Mistborn fans, and one moment that&#39;s sure to be especially thrilling is the duo&#39;s pewter drag scene from The Final Empire. Upon realizing that their army is compromised, Vin and Kelsier use pewter to travel an incredibly long distance in a short span of time. This pushes them to their limits, and it&#39;ll be interesting to see that urgency played out, especially using Mistborn&#39;s unique power system. The end of this scene will also pack an emotional punch, as the pair fail to save the rebel army, something Kelsier has a hard time accepting.





 8  Kelsier Destroying The Pits Of Hathsin 
The Final Empire
        

Toward the end of The Final Empire, Kelsier returns to the Pits of Hathsin — the place he was imprisoned, tortured, and forced to watch his love die — and completely destroys them using his Mistborn powers. While the source material doesn&#39;t actually show this moment, it would make a great cinematic sequence in the Mistborn movie. Rather than having Kelsier relay what he&#39;s done to his crew, the film adaptation can follow him on this excursion. It&#39;ll be a cathartic moment for one of Mistborn&#39;s best characters, and it&#39;ll hit the audience even harder than it did in the books.





 7  Kelsier&#39;s Sacrifice 
The Final Empire
        

Kelsier&#39;s death is one of the most important moments in the entire Mistborn trilogy, and the way he goes out will leave viewers in awe. Not only does Kel sacrifice himself to save his friends, but he does so after a thrilling fight with the Lord Ruler&#39;s Steel Inquisitors. Just as it looks like Kelsier might make it out alive, the Lord Ruler himself arrives and makes quick work of him. As it turns out, this is part of Kelsier&#39;s plan. He becomes a martyr for the cause, and his final words will leave a lasting impact on moviegoers: &#34;I am the one thing you can never kill. I am hope.&#34;
            
 
 Mistborn&#39;s Saddest Death Will Create A Major Challenge For The Movies 
The Mistborn movie adaptation is exciting for fantasy fans, but the story itself creates many challenges, including one major character’s early death.








 6  Elend Comes Back For Vin 
The Final Empire
        

At the end of The Final Empire, Elend goes to Kredik Shaw to save Vin, who winds up fighting off multiple Steel Inquisitors to save herself, Elend, and Sazed. Vin&#39;s confrontation with the Inquisitors will already look great on the big screen, but the true heart of this moment lies in Vin and Elend&#39;s reunion. After an upbringing full of betrayals and abandonment issues, Vin realizes that Elend returned for her, cementing her ability to trust people. It&#39;s a powerful scene, and it will evoke an emotional response from viewers when it plays out on the big screen.





 5  Vin Kills The Lord Ruler 
The Final Empire
        

Although the Lord Ruler isn&#39;t the actual Big Bad of the Mistborn trilogy, it&#39;ll be immensely satisfying to see Vin put an end to his tyranny. At the end of the first book, Mistborn&#39;s lead has an intense confrontation with the Final Empire&#39;s leader — and it&#39;s one that will leave viewers on edge if adapted properly. Vin nearly doesn&#39;t win this fight, so it&#39;ll make for a thrilling action sequence. Additionally, Vin only manages to defeat the Lord Ruler due to two revelations. Both serve as major plot twists in the first book, and it&#39;ll be fun to see how such surprises play out on-screen, especially for newcomers.





 4  Vin Returns To Save Her Friends &amp; City 
The Well Of Ascension
        

Much of The Well of Ascension focuses on the politics of Elend&#39;s rule, with multiple armies challenging his claim to the throne. These armies surround Luthadel, and one that&#39;s full of massive beasts called Koloss eventually attacks the city. Although Sazed and the other members of the crew send Vin and Elend away to save them, Vin returns to protect her friends and city. Her arrival in the midst of the battle is one of the most exciting moments of the entire Mistborn trilogy, and seeing her silhouette leaping off the walls of Luthadel will no doubt be an amazing cinematic experience.





 3  Vin Defeats Zane (&amp; Learns About OreSeur) 
The Well Of Ascension
        

The Well of Ascension also introduces another Mistborn: Elend&#39;s half-brother, Zane. Zane spends most of the second novel sparring with Vin, but he never truly attempts to harm her. Zane claims to love Vin, and he asks her to run away together at the end of the novel. When Vin tells him no, the pair has a sparring match with deadly stakes — and Vin only defeats him due to a split-second realization that proves her reflexes are unmatched. Vin also learns that her kandra, OreSeur, isn&#39;t who she believes during this fight. Between the action and twists, this will make a great Mistborn movie moment.





 2  Vin Defeating Ruin With The Power Of Preservation 
The Hero Of Ages
        

Vin becoming Preservation and defeating Ruin is difficult to envision while reading The Hero of Ages, but it&#39;s undoubtedly a huge moment for her character and the climax of the trilogy. Bringing this scene to the big screen will give it a more tangible quality, which is exciting on its own. Seeing the culmination of all three books will be thrilling, and Elend&#39;s and Vin&#39;s deaths taking place during this fight with Ruin will make this as tragic as it is powerful. It will be an emotional moment to behold on-screen, assuming a Mistborn movie trilogy gets this far.





 1  Sazed Realizing He&#39;s The Hero Of Ages 
The Hero Of Ages
        

The original Mistborn trilogy frequently references the Hero of Ages, leading readers to believe that Vin or Elend might be this legendary figure. The final book&#39;s revelation that Sazed is the prophesied Hero is both surprising and satisfying, as it gives meaning to the character&#39;s arc and the story&#39;s themes of knowledge and spirituality. Sazed&#39;s realization takes place amid the destruction of the final battle. It&#39;s a powerful moment as he kneels before Vin&#39;s and Elend&#39;s corpses and comes to terms with his role in the Final Empire&#39;s rebirth. Done correctly, this scene will prove just as impactful in the Mistborn movie, making it one to look forward to.
