## Literature Review

During a recent appearance, movie star Dwayne Johnson makes a joke trashing one of the worst-reviewed projects of his entertainment career.




Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson himself has dissed his 2017 movie Baywatch. The movie star appeared alongside Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas in the action-comedy, which was based on the beachside television drama of the same name that ran for 11 seasons between 1989 and 2001. The movie, which was not well-received and earned a 17% score on Rotten Tomatoes, followed a group of lifeguards who teamed up to defend their beach from a businesswoman with dastardly plans for the area.




Johnson himself numbers among the people who have publicly dissed the Baywatch movie, as a new video posted on Twitter by DiscussingFilm shows. Check it out below:


 

The video reveals a moment from a recent WWE Raw broadcast where Johnson is on the mic and taunting wrestler Jinder Mahal. He says that &#34;nobody likes you, and you’re not funny,&#34; comparing Mahal to the movie Baywatch. Read Johnson&#39;s full quote below:


Nobody likes you and you’re not funny. As a matter of fact, if you were one of The Rock’s movies, you would probably be Baywatch.



 How Does Baywatch Compare To The Rock’s Other Movies? 
          




This new video isn’t the first time that Johnson has acknowledged that the 2017 movie was a critical flop. Indeed, in 2018, he became one of the few stars to acknowledge a movie&#39;s Razzie award when he posted a video accepting its trophy for &#34;The Razzie Nominee So Rotten You Loved It.&#34; However, being part of the Baywatch cast didn&#39;t necessarily lead to the worst flop of his career.

On Rotten Tomatoes, Baywatch is indeed one of his worst reviewed, tying for last place with 2010&#39;s Tooth Fairy, which also has a 17% critic score. However, the 58% audience score that inspired the title of the movie&#39;s Razzie award makes it the 14th worst-rated Johnson movie out of 45, a much-improved position. To compare, check out the five lowest-ranked Dwayne Johnson movies by audience score below:

 Title  RT Audience Score   Tooth Fairy (2010)  41%   Planet 51 (2009)  40%   The Scorpion King (2002)  38%   Doom (2005)  34%   Empire State (2013)  24%   






While it seems unlikely that a possible Baywatch 2 will ever happen, Baywatch wasn&#39;t a substantial commercial flop, either. It earned $177.9 million off its roughly $69 million budget, a not inconsiderable gross that likely put it in the black. While it&#39;s not one of Johnson&#39;s biggest hits, it&#39;s only the 21st lowest-performing movie of his career worldwide, meaning that it has only hit the bottom in one of the metrics that can be applied to its success.
