## Literature Review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s major Critics&#39; Choice Awards win means its sequel, Beyond the Spider-Verse, has a bigger challenge on its way.




Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s new award ups the ante for the animated movie trilogy&#39;s finale. The animated trilogy of Marvel movies produced by Sony has become a global phenomenon. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s ending set up a gigantic finale for the animated trilogy, and following Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse&#39;s delay, the trilogy&#39;s finale now faces even more pressure to be great thanks to its predecessor&#39;s new major win.




Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse took home the Best Animated Feature award at this year&#39;s Critics&#39; Choice Awards. The major win for the movie puts more pressure on its sequel. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was also nominated in another two categories at the Critics&#39; Choice Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Score. The upcoming Marvel movie threequel, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, now has an even higher bar to meet.

                  Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse Credits Tease Explained &amp; Beyond The Spider-Verse Setup   Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has a post-credits tease setting up the third movie in the franchise. We break down what it means.   


 How Across The Spider-Verse&#39;s Critics Choice Award Sets A Higher Bar For Spider-Man: Beyond The Spider-Verse 
         

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s Critics&#39; Choice Awards win is a major one, as it was for the Best Animated Feature. To win such a category, a movie has to be all-around excellent. Given the artistry present in every frame of the second Spider-Verse film, as well as its enthralling story, relatable characters, and more, it is easy to understand why the movie won such a coveted award.




Back in 2018, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse also won the Best Animated Feature award at the Critics&#39; Choice Awards. With its sequel successfully following in the original movie&#39;s footsteps, it has now become expected for every Spider-Verse movie to win the major award. Due to that, and all that is involved in judging which film deserves to be the best animated feature of the year, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse faces added pressure.

The Spider-Verse threequel already had to deal with reports of poor work conditions on Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse being indefinitely delayed. Now, with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse finding the same success in the awards season that it did at the box office, the final movie of the animated trilogy will have to either meet the high standard set by its predecessor or somehow surpass it. With Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse having a good chance of being named the Best Animated Feature at the Academy Awards, the threequel could face even more pressure soon.
