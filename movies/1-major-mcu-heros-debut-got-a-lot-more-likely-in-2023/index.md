## Literature Review



One major Marvel Comics hero&#39;s MCU debut has become even more likely after the events of Marvel Studios&#39; Ms. Marvel and The Marvels. Following the conclusion of the MCU&#39;s Infinity Saga, the defeat of the Mad Titan Thanos and the destruction of the Infinity Stones, Marvel Studios introduced a slew of new characters and relics to the Multiverse Saga. While the likes of She-Hulk, America Chavez, Moon Knight and Shang-Chi have all been introduced, there are still many more powerful Marvel Comics characters that haven&#39;t yet been adapted, but recent MCU projects including Ms. Marvel and The Marvels have laid the foundations for a new hero to show his face.




One new hero that Marvel Studios introduced into the MCU&#39;s Phase 4 is Iman Vellani&#39;s Kamala Khan, a Jersey City teenager who becomes Ms. Marvel after her mutant ability is unlocked by a mysterious and ancient bangle. Kamala Khan is an exciting element of the Multiverse Saga, as her future in the MCU will be lengthy, she has already interacted with other superheroes on the big screen, and she is set to build her own team in the form of the MCU&#39;s Young Avengers. Following Ms. Marvel, however, 2023&#39;s The Marvels revealed a huge detail about Kamala Khan&#39;s powerful accessories, that hints at one Marvel Comics hero&#39;s potential MCU debut.

 Ms. Marvel &amp; The Marvels Introduced The MCU’s Quantum Bands 
          




2022&#39;s Ms. Marvel saw Kamala Khan first come across her mystical bangle, gifted to her by her grandmother. The bangle&#39;s cosmic origins unlocked Kamala&#39;s latent mutant ability when she first wore it, allowing her to access energy from the Noor Dimension that she could use to create hard-light constructs, including platforms and force-fields. Kamala continues to wear the bangle throughout her debut Disney&#43; series, even though her ability comes from within her own body, and she sports the accessory again in The Marvels. However, the 2023 film from Nia DaCosta revealed the true nature of Ms. Marvel&#39;s bracelet, confirming it to be one of two Quantum Bands.

During Phase 5&#39;s The Marvels, Zawe Ashton&#39;s villainous Dar-Benn uses the other Quantum Band to open dysfunctional time-jump portals, allowing resources from other worlds to be harvested and used to bring life back to the dying Kree homeworld, Hala. After also acquiring Kamala Khan&#39;s Quantum Band, Dar-Benn&#39;s use of both accessories tore a hole in the universe at the cost of her own life, yet Kamala herself appears to be able to withstand the power of using both Quantum Bands. Their introduction makes Ms. Marvel one of the MCU&#39;s most powerful characters, and creates the opportunity for Quasar&#39;s debut in the MCU.






 Quasar Uses The Quantum Bands In Marvel Comics 
   Close     

Originally introduced as Marvel Boy in 1978&#39;s Captain America #217, Marvel Comics&#39; Wendell Vaughn eventually adopted the moniker of Quasar in 1979&#39;s The Incredible Hulk (Vol. 2) #234. Vaughn, despite having no innate superhuman abilities, was a skilled SHIELD agent, but was deemed unworthy as he lacked the will to win at all costs. However, Vaughn&#39;s flexible will actually made him the perfect recipient of the Quantum Bands, as the accessories responded to him simply &#34;going with the flow.&#34; Armed with the Quantum Bands, Wendell Vaughn became one of Marvel Comics&#39; most powerful characters, as the cosmic being Eon dubs Vaughn as his new agent, a Protector of the Universe.

As Quasar, Wendell Vaughn became a prominent member of Earth&#39;s Avengers, but also embarked on many adventures across the cosmos of the Marvel Universe. Quasar battled the Mad Titan Thanos, Adam Warlock&#39;s evil future-self Magus, Ego the Living Planet and the planet-eater Galactus, using the Quantum Bands to unlock some remarkable abilities. The bands worked by allowing their wielders to tap into the energies of the Quantum Zone, though they also allowed for easy teleportation and the creation of hard-light constructs - similarly to the MCU&#39;s Ms. Marvel. Since the Quantum Bands have officially debuted in the MCU, their most famous user from Marvel Comics may not be far behind.






 Where Could Quasar Debut In The MCU’s Future? 
          

The fact that The Marvels confirmed Ms. Marvel&#39;s bangle to be one of the Quantum Bands means that Wendell Vaughn&#39;s Quasar could soon debut in the MCU, claiming his rightful accessories for himself. As a mutant, Kamala Khan will surely be able to access her abilities without the use of the Quantum Bands, but even if Wendell Vaughn does assume control of the relics, it&#39;s unclear exactly where he could debut in the MCU&#39;s future. During one Marvel Comics storyline, Quasar battles the Shi&#39;ar alongside Binary, and since the latter made an appearance in The Marvels&#39; post-credits scene, it&#39;s possible her next appearance could also bring Quasar into the MCU.

Following the 2023 release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 and the disappointing box office turnout to The Marvels, the fate of the MCU&#39;s most-cosmic adventures is uncertain. Marvel Studios is still developing a Nova project for the MCU, which could potentially introduce Quasar to the MCU, and with a continuation of Eternals&#39; storyline suspected, Quasar could also join forces with these other cosmic beings. Iman Vellani is set to have a bright MCU future as Kamala Khan&#39;s Ms. Marvel, so it&#39;s possible that a potential Ms. Marvel season 2, a sequel to The Marvels or future projects featuring the young hero could see her interact with Quasar.
