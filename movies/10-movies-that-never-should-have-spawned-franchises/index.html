  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Not every successful movie needs a franchise: Some series would have been better off as standalone films, as unnecessary sequels and spin-offs can spoil the legacy of the original.
Several movie franchises should have stopped at the first film: Examples include Highlander, Taken, Dirty Harry, and The Hangover, where subsequent entries in the series did not live up to the quality of the original.
The desire for box office success often leads to unnecessary franchises: Movies like Jaws, Men in Black, and Jurassic Park were major hits, but the sequels failed to capture the magic of the original and hurt the series&rsquo; legacy.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Today it feels like every successful movie must act as the springboard for a new ongoing franchise, however, there are some series that would have been better off if they remained as one standalone film. Not everything needs an array of sequels, prequels, and spin-offs, and certain releases would benefit from letting an individual film speak for itself without unnecessarily expanding on successful movies. There are plenty of series that feel like they have been going on forever, only to have peaked with the very first film and everything after that spoiling the original’s legacy.
The tendency for film studios to milk successful movies for all they are worth comes into the forefront with the arrival of blockbuster movies like Jaws, which offered three sequels of diminishing returns and strongly highlights the need to let certain movies stand alone. There are series where the idea only truly works one time and every new entry in the franchise only rehashes aspects of the original entry. Sadly, the potential for already established characters, concepts, and series to deliver box office success is often too hard to ignore and there are now plenty of movies that never should have spawned franchises.</p>
<p>10  Highlander (1986)
Franchise: Highlander (1986 – 2007)</p>
<p>Highlander
Connor MacLeod, born in 16th century Scotland, is one of a few immortals who can only be killed by beheading. Now, in 1985, the immortals who have survived their centuries-long secret war meet in New Yor for the &ldquo;Gathering&rdquo; to fight for the mysterious &ldquo;Prize.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to MacLeod to make sure that the Prize does not fall into the hands of his enemy, Kurgan.
Release Date   March 7, 1986    Director   Russell Mulcahy    Cast   Christopher Lambert , Roxanne Hart , Clancy Brown , Sean Connery , Beatie Edney , Alan North    Runtime   116 minutes</p>
<p>A true 1980s classic that has since become a cult favorite, the legacy of Highlander would only have been improved if the film had been allowed to remain a stand-alone oddity.</p>
<p>There should have only been one Highlander, but sadly, the series has had four theatrical releases and several television series. The subsequent entries in the fantasy Highlander series are a mixed bag of varying quality, while some provide an insightful expansion of the series lore, nothing matches the absurd and cheesy fun of the first movie. A true 1980s classic that has since become a cult favorite, the legacy of Highlander would only have been improved if the film had been allowed to remain a stand-alone oddity within the sword-and-sorcery genre.</p>
<p>9  Taken (2008)
Franchise: Taken (2008 – 2018)</p>
<p>Taken
Taken stars Liam Neeson as ex-Green Beret and ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills, who retired from his life of fighting in order to be there for his family. When his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Paris and is kidnapped by human traffickers, Mills launches into action, mounting a one-man rescue mission that sees him tear through gangs of European criminals with extreme prejudice in hopes of finding and rescuing Kim before it&rsquo;s too late.
Release Date   January 30, 2009    Director   Pierre Morel    Cast   Liam Neeson , Katie Cassidy , Famke Janssen , Leland Orser , Maggie Grace    Runtime   90 minutes</p>
<p>The original Taken film was an exciting thriller and one of Liam Neeson’s best action movies. The story of ex-CIA officer Bryan Mills tracking down his kidnapped teenage daughter, Taken was non-stop action with a 90-minute runtime that does not outstay its welcome. Unfortunately, the same can’t be said for the rest of the series, as Mills continued quests for vengeance in later instalments messed with the first movie’s premise of a man forced out of retirement and turned it into a series about a maniac who cannot stop killing people. If the Taken series were just one stand-alone film it would have a much stronger legacy than it does today.</p>
<p>8  Dirty Harry (1971)
Franchise: Dirty Harry (1971 – 1988)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Dirty Harry
Clint Eastwood stars in the western Dirty Harry as a no-nonsense San Francisco cop who takes the law into his own hands in pursuit of a serial killer, Scorpio. Directed by Don Siegel and featuring a memorable score by Lalo Schifrin, the film is known for its iconic catchphrases and intense action scenes, and has influenced countless films and TV shows in the years since its release.
Release Date   July 14, 1971    Director   Don Siegel    Cast   Clint Eastwood , Harry Guardino , Reni Santoni , John Vernon , Andrew Robinson , John Larch    Runtime   102 minutes</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood portrayed San Francisco Police Department Homicide Division Inspector &ldquo;Dirty&rdquo; Harry Callahan in five feature films that should have remained as one classic action movie. The original was a fantastic film that includes the most iconic quotes in the entire Dirty Harry franchise and influenced a whole new style of police film focusing on loose-cannon cops who aren’t afraid to bend the rules to get results. The subsequent releases in the series provided diminishing returns and thankfully by the time The Dead Pool was released in 1988 Eastwood put the character to rest and has never returned to him since.</p>
<p>7  Pitch Perfect (2012)
Franchise: Pitch Perfect (2012 – 2022)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Pitch Perfect was a surprise hit when it was released in 2012, making over $115 million on a budget of $17 million (via Box Office Mojo). Starring Anna Kendrick with an ensemble cast of college a cappella singers, Pitch Perfect was a fun, formulaic, movie that did not immediately spring to mind as a franchise starter. However, the success of Pitch Perfect was too big to ignore and the movie was followed by two sequels and a television series. Pitch Perfect 2 was enjoyable but unnecessary. Pitch Perfect 3 failed to capture any of the magic of the original and ended the film series on a low note.</p>
<p>6  Men In Black (1997)
Franchise: Men in Black (1997 – 2019)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Men In Black
Release Date   July 2, 1997    Director   Barry Sonnenfeld    Cast   Tommy Lee Jones , Rip Torn , Linda Fiorentino , Will Smith , Vincent D&rsquo;Onofrio    Runtime   98 minutes</p>
<p>The first Men in Black movie was an exciting science fiction adventure that thanks to a smart script, engaging performances, and spectacular set pieces was a huge blockbuster hit. Bringing together aspects of conspiracy theories, government surveillance, and the hidden existence of extraterrestrial life on Earth, by all accounts Men in Black was a major success. It makes sense then that Men in Black was followed by several disappointing sequels that unfortunately hurt the legacy of the first movie. Men in Black worked well as a standalone feature and yet another example that not everything needs to become a franchise.</p>
<p>5  The Matrix (1999)
Franchise: The Matrix (1999 – 2021)</p>
<p>The mind-bending cyberpunk spectacle that was The Matrix was basically the perfect standalone film, that became a complex, challenging, and convoluted series in subsequent sequels. The Matrix carried an insightful and profoundly philosophical message around reality, control, and existence that the directors, the Wachowskis, paired with an engaging story, incredible visual effects, and a high-concept hook. As the series continued, The Matrix lost its way, and even if subsequent entries were still philosophically rich and helped expand the mythology of the series, the sequels provided diminishing returns and did not match the quality of the original.</p>
<p>4  Jurassic Park (1993)
Franchise: Jurassic Park/Jurassic World (1993 – Present)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Jurassic Park
Release Date   June 11, 1993    Director   Steven Spielberg    Cast   Richard Attenborough , Sam Neill , Laura Dern , Samuel L. Jackson , Jeff Goldblum    Runtime   127 minutes</p>
<p>While there were some strong subsequent entries in the series, the magic has been lost.</p>
<p>The release of Jurassic Park in 1993 was a watershed moment for the use of CGI on the big screen. A true spectacle and one of the purest examples of real movie magic, Jurassic Park was unlike anything that came before it and the combination of groundbreaking special effects, powerful performances, and a cautionary tale meant that Jurassic Park still holds up today. Unfortunately, now the series consists of six films and a plethora of extended media. While there were some strong subsequent entries in the series, the magic has been lost, the creativity has run dry, and the time has come to allow this endangered series to become extinct.</p>
<p>3  Meet The Parents (2000)
Franchise: Meet the Parents (2000 – 2010)</p>
<p>Meet the Parents
Ben Stiller stars in Meet the Parents as Greg Focker, a male nurse who attempts to gain the sympathy of his girlfriend&rsquo;s parents when meeting them for the first time. Robert De Niro and Teri Polo co-star alongside Stiller in the 2000 comedy, which spawned two sequels: Meet the Fockers and Little Fockers.
Release Date   October 6, 2000    Director   Jay Roach    Cast   Robert De Niro , Blythe Danner , Owen Wilson , Teri Polo , Ben Stiller    Runtime   108 minutes</p>
<p>The quotable Meet the Parents film took an experience that many people go through in real life, meeting a partner’s parents, and dialed up the potential for awkward encounters and embarrassing mishaps to extreme and hilariously high levels. Taken as a standalone film, Meet the Parents was a clever, almost sitcom style, comedy that was effective, funny, and well-written. However, the joke ran out of steam in the sequel, Meet the Fockers, and by the time the lazy third entry, Little Fockers, was released, the old, repurposed, jokes were dead on arrival. The Meet the Parents franchise was a classic example of Hollywood not knowing when to quit.</p>
<p>2  Jaws (1975)
Franchise: Jaws (1975 – 1987)</p>
<p>Jaws
Release Date   June 20, 1975    Director   Steven Spielberg    Cast   Roy Scheider , Murray Hamilton , Lorraine Gary , Robert Shaw , Richard Dreyfuss    Runtime   124 minutes</p>
<p>The original Jaws film was directed by Steven Spielberg and at the time of its release became the highest-grossing film of all time, it changed the game when it came to summer blockbusters and its influence can still be seen in Hollywood today. Sadly, the story does not end here, and Jaws was expanded with three unwanted sequels. Jaws 2 ignored what made the original so suspenseful and showed too much of the shark, Jaws 3-D felt like a gimmick to attract viewers to a series they had already given up on, and Jaws: The Revenge was an illogical, implausible mess, and a sad, unremarkable, end to the series.</p>
<p>1  The Hangover (2009)
Franchise: The Hangover (2009 – 2013)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The Hangover
The Hangover follows a group of friends who head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. With Doug (Justin Bartha) preparing for his wedding, his friends Phil, (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) take him on a night he&rsquo;ll never forget, After blacking out, the group - who call themselves the &ldquo;Wolf Pack&rdquo; - realize that they&rsquo;ve lost Doug, and must retrace the steps of the most outrageous night of their lives in order to find him.
Release Date   June 5, 2009    Director   Todd Phillips    Cast   Ed Helms , Heather Graham , Justin Bartha , Zach Galifianakis , Bradley Cooper , Jeffrey Tambor    Runtime   100 minutes</p>
<p>If The Hangover had not been made into an unnecessary trilogy and instead remained one excellent film, it would have gone down in movie history as the best comedy of the 21st century. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and The Hangover was milked for all it was worth in two sequels that rehashed the humor of the first movie in ever more unbelievable installments. The Hangover Part II repeated the plotline in Thailand and The Hangover Part III was packed with so much over-the-top action audiences would be forgiven for forgetting this was supposed to be a comedy series. Sadly, the existence of the sequels hurts the original’s reputation.
