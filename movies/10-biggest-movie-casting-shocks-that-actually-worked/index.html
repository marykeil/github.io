<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are some movie casting decisions that when first announced come as a total shock but in the end the actors end up excelling in the role.</p>
<p>Occasionally there are casting decisions that leave audiences dumbfounded and seem to go against all logic, however, they end up winning viewers over and actually end up working. A shocking movie casting decision can sometimes work in a film’s favor as filmgoers flock to see how a particular actor fares playing against type, starring in a genre they are not known for, or making the transition from smaller roles into blockbuster movies. Shocking casting decisions are part of what keeps the entertainment industry interesting, and an actor taking a chance on an unlikely role can result in surprising movie magic.
Certain casting decisions, like Cate Blanchett in a Bob Dylan biopic, at the time felt as if the casting director had completely lost touch with the movie that they were tasked with getting made, only for the genius of the decision to become immediately apparent the second she appeared on screen. Iconic portrayals like Heath Ledger as the Joker were met with a wholly negative response at the time that is now viewed as a performance that helped define an entire decade of moviemaking. There are plenty of movie casting shocks that in the end actually worked.</p>
<p>10  Cate Blanchett as Bob Dylan/Jude Quinn
I’m Not There (2007)</p>
<p>Todd Haynes’ experimental biopic of Bob Dylan I’m Not There made the unusual decision to cast six different actors as different versions of the enigmatic folk singer’s public persona. The most out-of-the-box decision was casting female actor Cate Blanchett in the role of Jude Quinn, a representation of mid-1960s Dylan after having controversially turned electric. This gender-swapped casting was a major shock and ended up being the most compelling casting choice in the entire movie, which also included Christian Bale, Richard Gere, and Heath Ledger. There was something about the young, slender, and fidgety cigarette-smoking Dylan of the 1960s that somehow worked better with a woman playing the part.</p>
<p>9  Matthew McConaughey as Ron Woodroof
Dallas Buyer’s Club (2013)</p>
<p>Dallas Buyers Club</p>
<p>Release Date    November 17, 2013     Director    Jean-Marc Vallee     Cast    Jared Leto , Matthew McConaughey , Jennifer Garner , Steve Zahn , Dallas Roberts     Runtime    117 minutes</p>
<p>Before Matthew McConaughey won Best Actor at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of Ron Woodroof, a cowboy diagnosed with AIDS, in Dallas Buyer’s Club, he was known as a romantic lead film like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. McConaughey lost 50 pounds for his role as Woodroof in a transformative performance that shocked audiences as he demonstrated acting ability beyond anything he had previously achieved. This role kick started a golden age in McConaughey’s career, dubbed “the McConaissance”, that saw him taking up acclaimed parts in The World of Wall Street, True Detective, and Interstellar.</p>
<p>8  Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003)</p>
<p>Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl</p>
<p>Release Date    July 9, 2003     Director    Gore Verbinski     Cast    Orlando Bloom , Jack Davenport , Geoffrey Rush , Johnny Depp , Keira Knightley     Runtime    143 minutes</p>
<p>Johnny Depp’s performance as Captain Jack Sparrow was the most iconic part of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. However, his transformation into a Disney star was not an obvious path when the first film was released. Before this, Depp had taken whimsical roles in Tim Burton movies, like Edward Scissorhands, but was also known for serious parts like in Donnie Brasco and Blow. Depp’s casting was met with skepticism and his take on the character was so idiosyncratic it was hard to tell how audiences would react to Captain Jack Sparrow. Of course, the decision paid off, and the Pirates films ranked among the highest-grossing movies of the 2000s.</p>
<p>7  Ryan Gosling as Ken
Barbie (2023)</p>
<p>Barbie</p>
<p>Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Margot Robbie , Ryan Gosling , Simu Liu , Ariana Greenblatt , Helen Mirren , Nicola Coughlan , John Cena , Will Ferrell , Ritu Arya , Michael Cera , America Ferrera , Alexandra Shipp , Kate McKinnon     Runtime    114 Minutes</p>
<p>While Ryan Gosling first came to prominence as a teenage member of Disney’s The Mickey Mouse Club and achieved worldwide fame with the romantic drama The Notebook, his career from the mid-2000s was categorized by independent dramas like Half Nelson, Lars and the Real Girl, and Blue Valentine. Gosling developed a silent tough guy persona through films like Drive and Only God Forgives, to the point that his casting as Ken in the Barbie movie came as a complete and utter shock. Despite this, Gosling shined in Barbie and, with a total commitment to the part, added nuance to what at its core appeared to be a character without substance.</p>
<p>6  Adam Sandler as Barry Egan
Punch-Drunk Love (2002)</p>
<p>Punch-Drunk Love</p>
<p>Release Date    November 1, 2002     Director    Paul Thomas Anderson     Cast    Robert Smigel , Mary Lynn Rajskub , Emily Watson , Adam Sandler , Luis Guzman , Philip Seymour Hoffman     Runtime    95 minutes</p>
<p>The pairing of acclaimed director Paul Thomas Anderson and comedy star Adam Sandler for Punch-Drunk Love was a casting shock that turned out to be inspired genius. In Adam Sandler’s expert portrayed Barry Egan, an entrepreneur with social anxiety, he demonstrated acting chops that had never been previously utilized and opened the floodgates for more serious roles that prove Adam Sandler is a great actor as his career continued. Sandler would follow up with Punch-Drunk Love with more dramatic turns in films like Reign Over Me, The Meyerowitz Story, and perhaps his best role to date in Uncut Gems.</p>
<p>5  Jim Carrey as Joel Barish
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)</p>
<p>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</p>
<p>Release Date    March 19, 2004     Director    Michel Gondry     Cast    Kate Winslet , Jim Carrey , Elijah Wood , Kirsten Dunst , Mark Ruffalo     Runtime    108 minutes</p>
<p>By the early 2000s, Jim Carrey had taken up serious roles in films like The Truman Show and Man on the Moon but was associated with the over-the-top eccentricities of Ace Ventura or The Mask. Carrey’s casting as Joel in Spike Lee’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was a shocking casting choice that worked. Carrey’s performance captured the buried turmoil of Joel and his masterful comedic skills allowed him to balance Joel’s emotions as he traveled through the deepest recesses of his mind. The film was a testament to his skills as a serious actor and, despite Carrey’s planned retirement, showcased why he should take up more dramatic roles.</p>
<p>4  Heath Ledger as The Joker
The Dark Knight (2008)</p>
<p>The Dark Knight</p>
<p>Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes</p>
<p>Audiences were dumbfounded when Heath Ledger was announced as the Joker in The Dark Knight with director Christopher Nolan stating: “The whole world turned around and said &lsquo;What are you doing?” (via The Fire Rises.) Due to Ledger&rsquo;s past roles in films like Brokeback Mountain, viewers did not buy Ledger as Batman’s archenemy. However, this shocking casting choice went on to be one of the most acclaimed performances of all time as Ledger and would posthumously receive the Academy Award for Best Actor. Ledger’s untimely death prior to the release of The Dark Knight was a sad tale, as Ledger never got to witness the universal acclaim of his performance.</p>
<p>3  Tom Cruise as Les Grossman
Tropic Thunder (2008)</p>
<p>Tropic Thunder</p>
<p>Release Date    August 13, 2008     Director    Ben Stiller     Cast    Ben Stiller , Robert Downey Jr. , Matthew McConaughey , Tom Cruise , Jack Black     Runtime    107 minutes</p>
<p>Tom Cruise as the balding, hot-tempered, studio executive Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder has him playing so far against type that many viewers did not even recognize it was him in the role. A complete departure from the previous action and drama parts Cruise had become known for, the character of Grossman was created by Ben Stiller and Cruise together and featured him in a fat suit, with prosthetic hands and a bald cap. He enjoyed playing the character so much that, as recently as 2022, Tom Cruise wanted to make a Les Grossman spin-off film where he would reprise this unusual role that, against all logic, was perfectly cast.</p>
<p>2  Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka
Wonka (2023)</p>
<p>Wonka</p>
<p>Release Date    December 15, 2023     Director    Paul King     Cast    Sally Hawkins , Olivia Colman , Keegan-Michael Key , Rowan Atkinson , Timothee Chalamet , Jim Carter     Genres    Family , Adventure , Comedy</p>
<p>The casting of Timothée Chalamet as Willy Wonka in the Wonka origin story was a shocking casting decision that split audiences; some felt he was the perfect choice, and others insisted the character did not need further exploration. The most shocking aspect of the film has to be that Timothée Chalamet was cast in Wonka because of his high-school rap videos on YouTube. However, Chalamet managed to silence all his naysayers when Wonka became a global hit and acted as an enjoyable crowd-pleaser. While Chalamet’s casting may have come as a surprise to some, it’s difficult to envision any other young actor in Hollywood today in the role.</p>
<p>1  Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron Man
Iron Man (2008)</p>
<p>Iron Man</p>
<p>Release Date    May 2, 2008     Director    Jon Favreau     Cast    Robert Downey Jr. , Jeff Bridges , gwyneth paltrow , Terrence Howard , Leslie Bibb , Shaun Toub , Clark Gregg , Paul Bettany     Runtime    126 minutes</p>
<p>The modern film landscape was entirely revolutionized by the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Robert Downey Jr’s portrayal as Tony Stark being the secret ingredient that led to its early success. Downey’s portrayal of Stark was so iconic that today it’s difficult to envision just how much of a shocking casting choice he was at the time. Before Iron Man, Downey had serious substance abuse troubles and had been arrested on several occasions. Downey’s career had taken a serious nosedive and, despite remaining sober since 2003 major film studios were not offering him roles, and Downey&rsquo;s performance in Iron Man stands as one of the best comebacks of all time.</p>
