## Literature Review

Barry Keoghan, who plays Druig in Eternals, revealed in an interview that he was instructed to play his character like Hayden Cristensen&#39;s Anakin.




Eternals star Barry Keoghan has revealed that the movie&#39;s director, Chloé Zhao, told him to embody the role of Druig by acting more like Hayden Christensen in Star Wars. Despite the Star Wars prequels taking a lot of flak when they were first released, the movies have since become fan favorites. Christensen&#39;s portrayal of Anakin Skywalker was, at the time, one of the aspects of the movie that drew the most ire - which made Zhao&#39;s instruction to the MCU star somewhat surprising. Thankfully, Christensen has since been redeemed in the eyes of the fans, who now look back at his time as Anakin more fondly than ever.




Keoghan revealed this information about his time on the set of Eternals in a recent interview with GQ (via YouTube), in which he also spoke about other prominent roles. He stated that while Zhao largely gave him free rein over how he would act in the role of an Eternal capable of mind control, she referenced the &#34;stillness&#34; of Christensen&#39;s role as Keoghan&#39;s overarching goal was to humanize the role of a superhero. While it is the shortest section of the interview, Keoghan playfully expressed his interest in a solo outing for Druig in which he mind-controls everyone &#34;for the sake of it.&#34;


“Chloe kept referencing Hayden Christensen. His character in Star Wars to be a bit more [specific]. She just wanted me to be a bit more still, very chin high. That was the only, really, prep I kinda done was to learn to walk a bit slower. I tried to mind-control people, and people would go, ‘What are you doing? Why are you staring at me?’”

                  Eternals&#39; Cliffhanger Ending Explained   Eternal&#39;s ending features some massive cliffhangers and teases for the MCU&#39;s future, and here&#39;s what it means for Phase 4 and its main characters.   


 Is Barry Keoghan&#39;s Eternals Character Returning To The MCU? 
         

It was Druig&#39;s empathy, along with the majority of his superhero family, that saw them rebel against their primary directive, leading to them halting the Emergence of Tiamut. Their defiance caused Tiamut to calcify and perish in the Indian Ocean after only partially emerging. This is now one of the MCU&#39;s most glaringly ignored plot threads, with nary a mention of the colossal structure that now permeates Earth&#39;s atmosphere. The movie also ends with multiple other cliffhangers that beg for resolution, including the arrival of Thanos&#39; brother, Starfox. With that in mind, it is hard to see how the Eternals couldn&#39;t reappear down the line.




The fact that the MCU hasn&#39;t addressed the Celestial in the ocean since then is telling, however. A decidedly mixed reaction to the movie and Zhao&#39;s noncommittal response to whether she would return to direct Eternals 2 also don&#39;t inspire much confidence in a possible sequel. Yet, despite Marvel being bogged down by substandard recent releases, it isn&#39;t as if one bad movie has stopped the studio from producing a sequel nonetheless. With all the plot threads Eternals left hanging, Druig&#39;s reappearance is, therefore, likely still part of the plan. Keoghan&#39;s half-suggestion that Druig could return in a solo movie, however, is far less likely.
