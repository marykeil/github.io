# Star Wars Fact Check No, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy Hasnt Said Reys New Jedi Order Movie Will “Make Men Feel Uncomfortable”


## SUMMARY 



  Rey&#39;s &#34;New Jedi Order&#34; movie is facing controversy due to old comments made by director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, which have been taken out of context.   Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s comments about making men uncomfortable were in reference to her work as an activist and filmmaker confronting issues such as acid attacks on women and honor killings.   Criticism against Obaid-Chinoy feels very heavy-handed indeed, and the current controversy appears to be bad faith.

## Literature Review

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is director of the next Star Wars movie, in the New Jedi Order era. Has she really said this will &#34;make men uncomfortable?&#34;




The Star Wars fandom is locked in heated debate over Rey’s “New Jedi Order” movie, based on an eight-year-old quote that’s being ripped out of context. Excitement is building for the next Star Wars movie, expected to feature Daisy Ridley’s return as Rey Skywalker. Announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023, this will be directed by two-time Academy Award-winning director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy - and recent comments have suggested news is imminent.




Unfortunately, Rey’s New Jedi Order movie is already becoming intensely controversial. Obaid-Chinoy’s recent remarks about the project ignited a firestorm of debate online, one that has now been intensified based on an old quote in which she joked about enjoying making men feel uncomfortable. But is this quote really valid, or has it been pulled out of context?

                  Star Wars: New Jedi Order - Cast, Story, Timeline &amp; Everything We Know   Rey&#39;s Star Wars return is happening in Star Wars: New Jedi Order. Here&#39;s what is known about the story, cast, and release of Daisy Ridley&#39;s film.   


 Why Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy Enjoys Making Men “Feel Uncomfortable” 
          

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is a celebrated Pakistani-American journalist, filmmaker, and activist best known for two award-winning documentaries confronting inequality in Pakistan; one discussed acid attacks on women, and another focused on honor killings. Her works have been hugely influential, resulting in actual changes of the law pertaining to honor killings in Pakistan. In 2012, the Government of Pakistan awarded Obaid-Chinoy one of its highest civilian honors, and Time Magazine recognized her as one of its top 100 most influential people in the world.




This is the context in which, eight years ago, Obaid-Chinoy joked she likes to make men feel uncomfortable. The full quote can be watched on YouTube, and it’s clearly about her work as an activist, campaigning against acid attacks on young girls and honor killings. These documentaries are understandably uncomfortable viewing for men, but that kind of discomfort is the only way to drive change. The quotes are nothing to do with Star Wars, which makes their current use in the fandom rather disappointing.


 

                  Women Have Been Shaping Star Wars From The Start - Which Is Why It&#39;s Time For A Female Director   Women have long since played a critical role in bringing the galaxy far, far to life. It&#39;s about time that one of them directed a Star Wars movie.   



 Why Is Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy Under Attack For Star Wars? 
          




There’s a sense in which any movie continuing the story of Rey Skywalker was always going to be controversial. The Star Wars sequel trilogy has come in for heavy criticism, and a lot is justified; there’s a striking lack of coherence in the ongoing narrative, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is generally viewed as a disappointing conclusion. But these criticisms are mixed with a lot of others that feel more than a little misogynistic. Some online voices seem to have learned the truth of Yoda’s words, that anger can be seductive, and they’ve used this to draw in clicks and views.

The criticism already directed toward Obaid-Chinoy seems disturbingly strong, given this troubled context. It’s hard not to feel there’s already a campaign mounting against her in certain circles, with British right-wing newspaper The Telegraph using the current furor as an opportunity to claim she’s not experienced enough to direct Star Wars in the first place (to be fair, the article is more even-handed than the headline). Ultimately, it seems many do not want to give Obaid-Chinoy the chance to prove herself - even though such a prestigious filmmaker should really be seen as something of a coup for Lucasfilm.




The last few years have seen Star Wars begin to broaden its horizons. Star Wars: Visions has given animation houses from around the world the opportunity to play in George Lucas’ sandbox, and the resulting two seasons of animated shorts have been incredible additions to the franchise. Not only will Obaid-Chinoy be the first female director to helm a Star Wars movie, she’ll also be the first Pakistani-American to do so, which is tremendously exciting. It will be thrilling to see such a different perspective on the Star Wars galaxy.

That said, it must be noted that Obaid-Chinoy won’t be working alone on Rey’s &#34;New Jedi Order&#34; movie. The script is being written by Steven Knight, best known for Peaky Blinders. This context definitely suggests some of the critics currently reacting against Obaid-Chinoy aren’t really acting in good faith - because, far from making men feel uncomfortable, this script will be written by a man.
