# Rebel Moons Villain Replacement Actor Avoided 1 Star Wars Problem For Zack Snyders Netflix Movie


## SUMMARY 



  Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon draws heavy comparisons to Star Wars, and was once intended to be a Star Wars movie before being rejected by Disney.   The recasting of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s Rupert Friend as Admiral Noble in Rebel Moon was a beneficial move, as his appearance would have further linked the franchise to Star Wars and drawn unwanted comparisons.   The acting approaches of Rupert Friend and Ed Skrein differ, with Friend favoring a cooler, calmer portrayal of villains compared to Skrein&#39;s more volatile and easily provoked characters. Skrein&#39;s approach ended up being better suited for the role of Admiral Noble in Rebel Moon.

## Literature Review
Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon is being heavily compared to Star Wars, but the replacement of one Rebel Moon actor helped in separating the two properties.





Summary

  Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon draws heavy comparisons to Star Wars, and was once intended to be a Star Wars movie before being rejected by Disney.   The recasting of Obi-Wan Kenobi&#39;s Rupert Friend as Admiral Noble in Rebel Moon was a beneficial move, as his appearance would have further linked the franchise to Star Wars and drawn unwanted comparisons.   The acting approaches of Rupert Friend and Ed Skrein differ, with Friend favoring a cooler, calmer portrayal of villains compared to Skrein&#39;s more volatile and easily provoked characters. Skrein&#39;s approach ended up being better suited for the role of Admiral Noble in Rebel Moon.  







Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is already being compared to Star Wars, but the recasting of a major villain&#39;s actor worked in the director&#39;s favor in this regard. The 2023 Netflix-streaming movie began life as a pitch by Snyder, with Rebel Moon once intended to be a Star Wars movie. However, Disney rejected Snyder&#39;s proposal, so he teamed up with Netflix and adapted his original vision for Rebel Moon.

Rebel Moon shares a similar aesthetic and narrative with Star Wars. As well as featuring an intergalactic empire with a tyrannous leader, including a heavy focus on his villainous enforcer (Darth Vader in Star Wars and Ed Skrein&#39;s Admiral Noble in Rebel Moon), both sci-fi stories also begin with a group of farmers who head on to greater things. While Rebel Moon may not be quite as fantastical as Star Wars, it&#39;s impossible to ignore the influence, especially in regard to its antagonists. However, the original casting of one of Rebel Moon&#39;s villains would have contributed even more to the similarities between both properties.

Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire features actor Ed Skrein as Admiral Atticus Noble, one of the 2023 movie&#39;s main villains. Originally, Admiral Noble was supposed to be played by Rupert Friend. According to Deadline, Friend had to step away from the project in 2022 due to scheduling conflicts. As such, Friend was recast early in the project&#39;s production, with Skrein stepping in to replace him. One of Rupert Friend&#39;s more recent roles was as the villainous Grand Inquisitor in Star Wars&#39; 2022 Disney&#43; series Obi-Wan Kenobi, meaning his appearance in Rebel Moon would have inevitably drawn further undesired comparisons between the two franchises.

An actor playing a major villain in both Rebel Moon and Star Wars would have drawn even more attention to the similarities between the creations of Zack Snyder and George Lucas. The fact that both A Child of Fire and Obi-Wan Kenobi were released in consecutive years would have meant the double-casting of Friend would have been more noticeable. Ultimately, Friend&#39;s unavailability benefited the reputation of the Rebel Moon franchise by avoiding yet another link to the Disney-owned sci-fi story.



 How Atticus Noble Would Have Been Different With Rupert Friend Instead Of Ed Skrein 
Both actors play villains in their own way
          

Both Rupert Friend and Ed Skrein have ample experience playing the bad guy, hence one replacing the other so smoothly. However, their approach to on-screen villainy does differ slightly. Friend tends to favor a more level-headed performance, often only losing his cool during especially trying situations. As a result, Friend&#39;s villains appear much calmer to the naked eye, which would presumably have made for quite a different interpretation of Rebel Moon&#39;s Admiral Noble.

Ed Skrein&#39;s portrayal of a story&#39;s antagonist tends to include his character&#39;s rage being much closer to the surface. Although Skrein&#39;s villains do have a modicum of restraint, their patience tends to run thin much easier than those portrayed by Friend. For Atticus Noble, Ed Skrein&#39;s approach ended up being better suited to the role than Friend&#39;s seemingly would have been based on his past roles, making the admiral a memorable character in Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire.



Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is streaming now on Netflix.
