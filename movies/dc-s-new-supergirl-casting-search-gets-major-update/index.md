# DC s New Supergirl Casting Search Gets Major Update


## SUMMARY 



  Milly Alcock, Emilia Jones, and Meg Donnelly are being considered for the role of Supergirl in the upcoming DC Universe movie.   Supergirl may make her first appearance in another DC Universe movie or TV show before Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.   Having Supergirl in a supporting role in Superman: Legacy would help establish her character before her solo movie.

## Literature Review

DC Studios is reportedly starting their casting search for Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, as several actresses are in the mix for the DC Universe gig.




Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow gets a major casting update as the DC Universe begins searching for the next Girl of Steel. While Superman: Legacy is the first DC Universe movie being worked on, there is another iconic Kryptonian on their way. Based on the comic of the same name, the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow movie is also being developed as part of the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34;




According to Deadline, Milly Alcock, Emilia Jones, and Meg Donnelly are currently in the mix for Kara Zor-El, aka Supergirl. While the movie has yet to find a director, DC Studios is starting early as Kara is reportedly going to appear in a different DC Universe movie or TV show before Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. At the time of this story&#39;s publication, Gunn, Peter Safran, and DC Studios have not made a comment on the Supergirl casting reports.

                  Casting Supergirl For The DC Universe: 10 Actors Perfect For James Gunn&#39;s Reboot   Kara Zor-El has a solo movie set for the new DC Universe, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and some actresses would be perfect as the DCU&#39;s Supergirl.   


 Will Supergirl Be In Superman: Legacy? 
         

It has been rumored that Supergirl will be part of the Superman: Legacy cast, featuring David Corenswet as her cousin Clark Kent, aka Kal-El. While it has yet to be confirmed, Superman: Legacy would make perfect sense for Kara&#39;s first appearance before Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. For starters, it would be a way for Gunn to give the DC Universe audience a chance to see how Kara and Clark are different.




Superman: Legacy will also be able to serve as an opportunity for audiences to invest in Kara before it leads into Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Since DC Studios is aiming for stronger connectivity for their movies and TV shows, in comparison to the DCEU, having Kara in a supporting role in Superman: Legacy is ideal for the DC Universe franchise. Since Superman: Legacy filming is set to begin in March, the world may know pretty soon whether any of these actresses land the role.



Ana Nogueira is currently writing the Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow screenplay for DC Studios.




Whoever gets cast as Supergirl, it will certainly be fascinating to see how the DC Universe&#39;s take on Kara differs from recent live-action incarnations, including Melissa Benoist in the Arrowverse and Sasha Calle in the DCEU. It also remains to be seen if Superman: Legacy may also set up Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow in terms of plot. For now, the world will have to wait and see who will end up getting tapped as Kara for the DC Universe and Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow.
