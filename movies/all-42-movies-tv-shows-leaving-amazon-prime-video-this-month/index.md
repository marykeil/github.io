## Literature Review
A handful of movies and TV shows are leaving Amazon&#39;s Prime Video streaming service this month.




Amazon&#39;s streaming service Prime Video boasts a large selection of movies and TV shows in its library available to subscribers, but much of that content is temporary, with a number of titles leaving each month. Like anything from Amazon, movies and TV shows can become out of stock, even when they&#39;re digital content. However, some of Amazon Prime Video&#39;s offerings disappear on a monthly basis on purpose, planned through contracts with film and television distributors.




While Amazon produces a lot of original content for Amazon Prime Video, the platform licenses most of its movies and shows from other companies, with agreed-upon streaming windows varying in the length of time they&#39;re made available. In January 2024, just as plenty of new shows and movies are added to Amazon Prime Video, there are also a number of titles that will be leaving the platform. While Amazon Prime Video still offers endless content for fans to dive into, they may want to check out these titles before they&#39;re gone as they include some terrific and entertaining movies that will be missed.
