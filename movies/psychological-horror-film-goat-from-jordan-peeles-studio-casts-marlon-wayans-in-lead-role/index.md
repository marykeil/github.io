## Literature Review

Upcoming psychological horror film GOAT, from Jordan Peele&#39;s Monkeypaw Productions, casts actor and comedian Marlon Wayans in the lead role.




Marlon Wayans is cast in the lead role of the upcoming film GOAT, which is set to be produced by Monkeypaw Productions. Wayans is an actor and comedian known for his roles in White Chicks, Little Man, and Air. Monkeypaw Productions is a film production company founded by visionary producer and director Jordan Peele.






Monkeypaw is also working on an untitled film directed by Peele himself.




As per The Hollywood Reporter, Wayans has just been cast in the upcoming Monkeypaw horror film GOAT. The film will center on a rising star athlete who is invited to train with his team’s retiring star. Wayans will play the all-star athlete lead role. In addition to Monkeypaw, GOAT will also be made in collaboration with Universal.


 What To Expect From GOAT 
          

GOAT will be the sophomore feature from Justin Tipping, whose previous directorial work includes the 2016 indie film Kicks. Tipping is also known for his work directing episodes of television, including for Dear White People and The Chi. The film’s script is co-written by Zack Akers and Skip Bronkie, and will be produced by Peele alongside Win Rosenfeld, Ian Cooper, and Jamal Watson.




Aside from the brief logline, there is very little known as to other plot details about GOAT. Furthermore, other cast members have been revealed other than Wayans. The premise creates interesting opportunities to interact with GOAT’s genre, however, which is stated to be underneath the psychological horror umbrella.

                  Untitled Jordan Peele Movie: Cast Speculation &amp; Everything We Know   Jordan Peele&#39;s fourth movie is on the way, and while most details remain secret, there&#39;s still plenty we can deduce about the director&#39;s next opus.   

The film also gains intrigue from the team it has behind it. Even under the psychological horror genre, GOAT is likely to contain some darkly comedic elements with Wayans at its core. Peele too has a propensity towards finding humor within horror — as Peele has done with his own films, such as 2022’s Nope — so GOAT’s Monkeypaw association could do well to breed unique tones within the film. Hopefully, more details of the mysterious film will be revealed soon as GOAT continues its development.
