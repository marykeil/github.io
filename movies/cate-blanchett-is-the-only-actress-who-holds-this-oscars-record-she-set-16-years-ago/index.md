The Australian native is one of the most talented actors working today and has been widely recognized by the Academy for her film work.

Among her impressive records and accomplishments is one Oscars feat that no other actress has been able to achieve, and it all began with her very first Oscar nomination 25 years ago.

In 1999, Cate Blanchett received her first Oscar nomination for playing Queen Elizabeth I in Shekhar Kapur’s biographical drama Elizabeth, which depicts the early years of the titular monarch&#39;s reign. Nine years after the release of Elizabeth, Blanchett reprised her role as Queen Elizabeth I in the follow-up film, Elizabeth: The Golden Age, which explores the latter part of her reign. In 2008, Blanchett was nominated again for Best Actress for her performance as Queen Elizabeth I in the sequel.

Since 2008, Cate Blanchett remains the only actress to be nominated twice for playing the same character, but five male actors have also accomplished this feat. In 1945, Bing Crosby won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as Father Chuck O&#39;Malley in Leo McCarey&#39;s Going My Way, then he was nominated again the following year for the sequel, The Bells of St. Mary&#39;s. Peter O&#39;Toole received nominations for Best Actor for playing King Henry II in both Becket in 1965 and The Lion in Winter in 1969.

Al Pacino was nominated in 1973 for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather, then again in 1975 for The Godfather Part II​​​​​​, this time for Best Actor. Paul Newman was the second actor to win at least one of his nominations for playing the same character, though he had to wait 25 years for it. Newman was nominated in 1962 for playing &#34;Fast Eddie&#34; Felson in The Hustler, then he won in 1987 for reprising the role in The Color of Money.




 

The most recent actor to join the ranks is Sylvester Stallone, who also has the largest gap between nominations. In 1977, he was nominated for Best Actor for his first performance as the titular Rocky Balboa in Rocky. Nearly 40 years later, he was nominated at the 2016 Oscars for reprising the iconic role in the Rocky spinoff Creed, this time for Best Supporting Actor.
