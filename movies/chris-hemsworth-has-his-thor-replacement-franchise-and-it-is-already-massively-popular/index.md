## Literature Review
Chris Hemsworth’s future as Thor in the MCU is still unclear, but thankfully, the actor already has another established franchise to focus on.




Chris Hemsworth has officially found a fitting franchise to serve as his Thor replacement, and it already has a massive following. While Hemsworth&#39;s portrayal as Thor in the MCU might be his most famous role, he actually got his start in movies in another major franchise, briefly playing George Kirk in 2009&#39;s Star Trek. Before that, the actor primarily appeared on TV shows, namely the Australian soap opera Home and Away. Fast forward a decade, and Hemsworth is one of the highest-paid Hollywood actors attached to some of the biggest franchises at the box office.




Aside from his role as the God of Thunder since the release of Thor in 2011, Hemsworth scored a prominent part in Snow White and the Huntsman. He also gained more attention in dramatic roles with titles such as Rush, In the Heart of the Sea, 12 Strong, and Bad Times at the El Royale. While Hemsworth&#39;s casting in Ghostbusters and Men in Black was expected to open more franchise doors, the MCU remained his safe bet. Through 2023, Hemsworth appeared in eight MCU movies that featured Thor as a significant character. However, with Thor: Love and Thunder&#39;s divisive response and the MCU&#39;s future unclear, Hemsworth needs a franchise replacement.

 Extraction Is Now Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Thor Replacement Franchise (&amp; Netflix Data Proves It) 
          




Based on the data revealed in Netflix&#39;s Engagement Report from December, Extraction looks to be Chris Hemsworth&#39;s proper Thor replacement franchise. 2023 saw the return of Hemsworth as the elite mercenary Tyler Rake in Extraction 2, which released in mid-June. According to Netflix, the movie was viewed for over 201 million hours. However, given that the report only covers data from January through June 2023, those hours were viewed in a very short time span, so its ranking as the 23rd title overall is even more impressive. Moreover, the first Extraction from 2020 also had over 83 million hours viewed in the first six months of 2023.

Whereas Extraction might carry the same enticing franchise appeal as the MCU, it&#39;s still an exciting series to utilize Hemsworth as a bonafide action star. Both Extraction movies served as high-stakes thrillers, pinning Hemsworth&#39;s Tyler Rake against ruthless drug lords in dark corners of the world. The pressure that comes along with a popular character like Thor isn&#39;t there, but the series still gives plenty of reasons to root for the characters. The sequel also took the action up a notch by presenting a 21-minute one shot sequence featured in Extraction 2.






 Will Chris Hemsworth Make Extraction 3? 
          

Thankfully, for those who became major fans of Tyler Rake and the Extraction movies, the good news is that Extraction 3 is in development, with Hemsworth set to reprise his role. Every sign points to a growing franchise, which should come as no surprise considering the success of both installments thus far. Netflix&#39;s original action movies have been hit or miss, even those starring big names like in Red Notice and The Gray Man. But unlike those movies, Netflix is going full throttle with Hemsworth&#39;s Extraction franchise.

Even if Hemsworth reprises his role as Thor in the MCU, Extraction could still have a brighter and longer future for the actor at this time. In fact, Extraction 3 or another franchise project could fully reunite Hemsworth with his Thor co-star Idris Elba, who briefly appeared as the mysterious Alcott at the end of Extraction 2. If more big names join Chris Hemsworth, the Extraction movies will only become more popular on Netflix, proving that he no longer needs Thor or the MCU to dominate the movie side of entertainment.
