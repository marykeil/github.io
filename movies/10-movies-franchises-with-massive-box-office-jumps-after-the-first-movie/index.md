## Literature Review

After a success first film in a series, movie franchises can have massive box office jumps when the second entry in a series is released.




After having already won audiences over with the first film in a series, movie franchises can have massive jumps at the box office for their second release. With viewers already aware of the characters and what to expect out of a series, they are much more likely to turn up at the theater for a movie whose premise they are sure they will enjoy. With this in mind, some franchises have had absolutely astounding success the second time around and made double, triple, or in some instances almost five times their original’s total box office gross.
A box office bump for the second release in a series can be common, but some movies have blown away all expectations with incredible success. These types of early successes can be a signal that a franchise may have the potential to stand the test of time and usually a successful second film will be followed up with a third, fourth, or even fifth entry in the franchise. These are some of the movie franchises that have had massive box office jumps after their first movie.









 








 10  Lethal Weapon (1987)/Lethal Weapon 2 (1989) 
Jumped from $120m to $227m at the box office
        

  Lethal Weapon 2  


  Release Date    July 7, 1989     Director    Richard Donner     Cast    Joss Ackland , Joe Pesci , Danny Glover , Mel Gibson , Derrick O&#39;Connor     Runtime    114 minutes    


The buddy cop action-comedy Lethal Weapon, starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, helped redefine action movies in the 1980s and early 1990s and expertly mixed action and comedy in a way not previously seen. While the first movie was a success, Lethal Weapon 2, was released just two years later and earned more than $100m more than its predecessor at the box office and transformed this series into a franchise that would include four feature films. The legacy of these films has remained strong and a fifth entry in Lethal Weapon is due to be directed by its co-star Mel Gibson.





 9  Pitch Perfect (2012)/Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) 
Jumped from $115m to $287m at the box office
        

  Pitch Perfect 2  


  Release Date    May 15, 2015     Director    Elizabeth Banks     Cast    Anna Kendrick , Brittany Snow , Rebel Wilson , Elizabeth Banks , Hailee Steinfeld     Runtime    115minutes    


The story of an all-girl a cappella group competing against a rival college, Pitch Perfect was a surprise sleeper hit when it was released in 2012. Grossing $115.5m against a budget of just $17 with this kind of success a sequel was inevitable. However, nobody could have predicted that the follow-up film, Pitch Perfect 2, would not only out-gross the original but would make more down double with a total box office gross of $287.5m against a budget of $29–31m. Completing the trilogy was the release of Pitch Perfect 3 in 2017 and a short-lived television spin-off called Pitch Perfect: Summer in Berlin aired in 2023.





 8  Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997)/Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) 
Jumped from $67m to $312m at the box office
        

  Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me  


  Release Date    June 8, 1999     Director    Jay Roach     Cast    Mike Myers , Heather Graham , Michael York , Robert Wagner , Rob Lowe , Seth Green , Mindy Sterling , Verne Troyer , Will Ferrell     Runtime    95 Minutes    


Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery acted as Mike Myers’ comedic tribute to British media and spy series such as James Bond. A hit at the box office, Austin Powers took in $67.7m against a budget of $16.5 and was so influential that future Bond Daniel Craig said Austin Powers was directly responsible for that series&#39; shift to a more series tone. With audiences already familiar with the character, the second film in the series, The Spy Who Shagged Me, made almost ten times its budget with a total gross of $312m against a budget of $33m.





 7  Twilight (2008)/Twilight New Moon (2009) 
Jumped from $408m to $711m at the box office


 







  The Twilight Saga: New Moon  


  Release Date    November 20, 2009     Director    Chris Weitz     Cast    Kellan Lutz , Peter Facinelli , Rachelle Lefevre , Nikki Reed , Robert Pattinson , Kristen Stewart , Jackson Rathbone , Billy Burke , Dakota Fanning , Ashley Greene , Taylor Lautner , Anna Kendrick , Michael Sheen     Runtime    130 minutes    


The original Twilight movie already had a built-in audience when the first film in the series was released in 2008 due to the major success of Stephanie Myers’ series of books. That was why it came as no surprise that Twilight was a smash hit at the box office and earned $408.4m against its $37m budget. However, it appeared that the success of this film and audience discussion around Team Edward or Team Jacob meant that the second movie would do even better. Twilight: New Moon was released in 2009 and, with a budget of $50m, made a whopping $711m at the global box office.





 6  The Terminator (1984)/Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) 
Jumped from $78m to $520m at the box office


 







  Terminator 2: Judgment Day  


  Release Date    July 3, 1991     Director    James Cameron     Cast    Arnold Schwarzenegger , Linda Hamilton , Robert Patrick , Edward Furlong     Runtime    137 Minutes    


Expectations were low before the release of James Cameron’s low-budget b-movie sci-fi action movie The Terminator, with a budget of just $6.4m the movie was not initially marketed as a blockbuster hit. Despite this, The Terminator made $78.3m at the box office, proved Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s potential as a leading man, and a sequel was, of course, planned. Terminator 2: Judgment Day would be granted a much larger budget of approximately $100m. However, this would pay off in spades as Terminator 2 grossed between $519–520.9m and would lead to the development of an entire franchise.





 5  Shrek (2001)/Shrek 2 (2004) 
Jumped from $419m to $935m at the box office
        

  Shrek 2  


  Release Date    May 19, 2004     Director    Kelly Asbury , Andrew Adamson , Conrad Vernon     Cast    Eddie Murphy , Mike Myers , Rupert Everett , Antonio Banderas , Jennifer Saunders , Cameron Diaz , Julie Andrews , John Cleese     Runtime    93 minutes    


With the release of Shrek in 2001, DreamWorks Animation had finally hit on an IP that could compete with rival studios like Disney and Pixar. With compelling characters and strong voice work, Shrek cleverly inverted classic fairy tale tropes and found great success doing it, making $491.8m against a $60m budget. With this kind of success, a high-budget sequel was inevitable and Shrek 2 was made for $150m. However, Shrek 2 would see an unprecedented level of success and creep close to the $1b mark with a total gross of $935.3m which made it the highest-grossing animated film of all time until the release of Toy Story 3 in 2010.





 4  Despicable Me (2010)/Despicable Me 2 (2013) 
Jumped from $543m to $971m at the box office
        

  Despicable Me 2  


  Release Date    June 26, 2013     Director    Pierre Coffin , Chris Renaud     Cast    Steve Carell , Kristen Wiig , Benjamin Bratt , Miranda Cosgrove , Russell Brand , Ken Jeong , Elsie Fisher , Dana Gaier , Pierre Coffin     Runtime    98 minutes    


Before the release of Despicable Me in 2010, the film looked like a fun kids&#39; comedy that nobody could have predicted would become one of the most successful multi-billion-dollar franchises of all time. Despicable Me was a success at the box office and gained $543.6m against a budget of $69. However, this was nothing compared to the incredible success of Despicable Me 2, which became the most profitable film in Universal Pictures&#39; then 101-year history and took in $971m against its $76m budget. This success would lead to sequels, prequels, and spin-offs as well as video games and even a theme park ride at Universal Studios Florida.





 3  Jumanji (1995)/Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) 
Jumped from $262m to $995m at the box office
        

  Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle  


  Release Date    December 5, 2017     Director    Jake Kasdan     Cast    Dwayne Johnson , Jack Black , Kevin Hart , Karen Gillan , Nick Jonas , Bobby Cannavale , Alex Wolff , Ser&#39;darius Blain , Madison Iseman , Morgan Turner     Runtime    119 Minutes    


The Robin Williams-led Jumanji film from 1995 was a fun family adventure about a supernatural board game and the man who has been trapped inside it for decades. Jumanji was a major success and made $262.8m against its $65m budget and quickly spawned an animated series and, in 2005, a stand-alone spin-off called Zathura: A Space Adventure. For the most part, the Jumanji series remained quiet until the release of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, starring Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart, came out in 2017. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was an astounding success and made $995.3m against its budget of between $90 and $150 and would even lead to a third Jumanji film in 2019 subtitled The Next Level.





 2  Batman Begins (2005)/The Dark Knight (2008) 
Jumped from $373m to $1b at the box office
        

  The Dark Knight  


  Release Date    July 18, 2008     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes    


Before the release of Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, the Batman series had been living in the embarrassing shadow of the critically panned movie Batman &amp; Robin. As a new dark and gritty take on The Caped Crusader, Batman Begins was miles away from that previous film, and audiences connected with this new portrayal of the character to the point that it made $373.7m against a budget of $150m at the box office. This was already a major success, but then with the release of its sequel The Dark Knight in 2008 the series reached incredible new highs and earned an astounding $1,006b at the box office against its $185 budget.





 1  Top Gun (1986)/Top Gun: Maverick (2022) 
Jumped from $357m to $1.496b at the box office


 







  Top Gun: Maverick  


  Release Date    May 27, 2022     Director    Joseph Kosinski     Cast    Jennifer Connelly , Jake Picking , Raymond Lee , Tom Cruise , Lewis Pullman , Monica Barbaro , Miles Teller , Danny Ramirez , Val Kilmer , Manny Jacinto , Ed Harris , Glen Powell , Jon Hamm     Runtime    130 minutes    


Tony Scott’s Top Gun was a major success when it was released in 1986. The Tom Cruise vehicle about a young naval aviator inspired a whole generation to recruit into the navy in real life. Top Gun made $357.3m against its $15m budget and, despite its success at the time, it took 36 years for a sequel to be produced. Top Gun: Maverick was released in 2022 and its success far surpassed the original in both box office success and critical acclaim. Top Gun: Maverick had a budget of between $170–177m but easily jetted past this number in box office revenue with a total gross of $1.496b at the global box office.
