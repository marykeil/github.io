## Literature Review

Since becoming available for streaming on Amazon Prime, the film Saltburn has grown in popularity, which could benefit the movie in a major way.




The rising success of the dark comedy film Saltburn presents a significant advantage for the movie. Saltburn is writer-director Emerald Fennell&#39;s second film after her debut with Promising Young Woman. Saltburn&#39;s cast stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a student at Oxford University who befriends Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi), an affluent and popular student. The narrative unfolds as Felix invites Oliver to spend the summer at his family&#39;s estate, delving into themes of desire and obsession as Oliver&#39;s intensity towards Felix grows.




Saltburn premiered at the 50th Telluride Film Festival on August 31, 2023, and made its wide release in theaters on November 22, 2023. Saltburn was then released on Prime Video on December 22, 2023, and has rapidly grown in popularity in the following weeks. The film received two Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama for Keoghan and Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture for Rosamund Pike. The newfound popularity of Saltburn positions it favorably during the award season, increasing its chances of securing an Oscar.

                  10 Best Quotes From Saltburn   Saltburn&#39;s blackly comedic tone and sharp script produce some incredibly funny and illuminating quotes. Here are 10 of the movie&#39;s best.   


 Saltburn&#39;s Newfound Popularity Could Boost Its Oscars Chances 
          




Despite being considered an outlier for the award season, Saltburn has garnered significant success on Prime Video, potentially opening the door for the film to win in key areas. One area the film could secure an Oscar for would be the sensational cinematography that was skillfully executed by Linus Sandgren. Using a square aspect ratio and shooting on 35mm film, Sandgren&#39;s work draws viewers toward the screen. His use of a noir-esque lighting style creates a darker, more ambiguous world. Sandgren&#39;s creative cinematography in Saltburn sets him apart, and given the film&#39;s increasing popularity, he stands a strong chance of winning an award.

Rosamund Pike, who plays Lady Elspeth Catton, is another potential award contender. Pike&#39;s performance has already earned her a Golden Globes nomination, and with the Oscar voting period approaching as the film is growing in popularity, she remains a strong contender for the award. A third category that could be particularly successful is Emerald Fennell for Best Original Screenplay. She previously won this award with her debut film Promising Young Woman, so her unique screenplay could very well secure her another win. With voting for the Academy Awards set to begin in tandem with the growing success of Saltburn, the film stands a chance of clinching multiple awards on the big day.






Nominations for the 96th Academy Awards will be announced on January 23, 2024.






 Saltburn&#39;s Success Still Won&#39;t Be Enough For It To Win Any Oscars 
          

Unfortunately for Saltburn, the other potential nominees for the 2024 Academy Awards have stronger campaigns, positioning them to win big at the award show. Christopher Nolan&#39;s film Oppenheimer collected the most Golden Globes in 2024, securing five awards, including Best Motion Picture Drama and Best Director. Another strong contender to win many awards at the Oscars is Martin Scorsese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon.

These two movies align with the typical profile of Oscar winners, making it challenging for Saltburn to win any major categories with such strong competition. While a significant victory for Saltburn at the Academy Awards would be surprising, its recent success may still lead to multiple nominations across various categories. This recognition would acknowledge Saltburn&#39;s artistry and success with viewers, even if it is unable to secure any awards.
