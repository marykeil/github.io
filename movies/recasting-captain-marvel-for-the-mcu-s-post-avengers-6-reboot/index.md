## Literature Review

Marvel Studios may be rebooting the MCU after 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars, which means a new actor could replace Brie Larson as Captain Marvel.




Marvel Studios may decide to recast Captain Marvel if the MCU reboots following 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars. The development of a live-action movie featuring Marvel Comics&#39; Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, was announced in 2014, and by June 2016, Brie Larson of Short Term 12, Room and Kong: Skull Island fame was cast in the titular role. Captain Marvel released in March 2019 as Marvel Studios&#39; first female-led film, and while the project received undue criticism, it excelled at the box office, grossing over $1 billion. Larson returned as Captain Marvel in Avengers: Endgame, Ms. Marvel and The Marvels, but recent MCU rumors could hint at the role being recast.
Recent speculation suggests that Marvel Studios may soft-reboot the MCU after 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars, using the project&#39;s multiversal storyline to establish a new continuity in the MCU. This has led to speculation that several iconic MCU heroes and villains will be recast after the Multiverse Saga, potentially marking the returns of Tony Stark&#39;s Iron Man, Steve Rogers&#39; Captain America and Natasha Romanoff&#39;s Black Widow, with new actors assuming these beloved roles. Brie Larson has unfortunately received criticism - however unnecessary - for her portrayal of Carol Danvers, so Captain Marvel could be a candidate for recasting following the MCU&#39;s reboot, and there are several actors who could replace Larson.

The MCU Multiverse Saga is setting the stage for a soft reboot that will streamline the Marvel Cinematic Universe after Avengers: Secret Wars.












 








 12  Emily Blunt Has Been Rumored To Be Joining The MCU 
Edge Of Tomorrow (2014), Sicario (2015), Oppenheimer (2023)
        

Emily Blunt could be a serious candidate for Captain Marvel in a rebooted MCU, not least because she was originally chosen to portray Natasha Romanoff&#39;s Black Widow, though she turned down the role for 2010&#39;s Iron Man 2. More recently, Blunt was one of many names rumored to be cast as Sue Storm for the MCU&#39;s Fantastic Four reboot, though it seems unlikely that she&#39;ll be joining the Phase 6 project. Emily Blunt&#39;s roles in projects such as Edge of Tomorrow, Looper, Sicario and A Quiet Place set her up for a role in the action and sci-fi-heavy MCU, and she&#39;d be perfect for the dramatic but light-hearted Captain Marvel.
Emily Blunt&#39;s real-life husband, John Krasinski, made a cameo appearance as Earth-838&#39;s Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mister Fantastic, in 2022&#39;s Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, but likely won&#39;t be reprising the role for the MCU&#39;s official Reed Richards in Fantastic Four. 






 11  Margot Robbie Has Superhero Experience From The DCEU 
Suicide Squad (2016), Mary Queen Of Scots (2018), Barbie (2023)


 







Along with Emily Blunt, Margot Robbie was also suggested to be joining the MCU as Sue Storm, but it&#39;s possible that she could instead take on the role of a rebooted Captain Marvel. Robbie has experience in a superhero franchise, having portrayed Harley Quinn in the DC Extended Universe since 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad, and becoming perhaps the most popular element of DC Studios&#39; now-defunct franchise. On top of this, Robbie&#39;s powerhouse roles in Mary Queen of Scots, Babylon, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and The Wolf of Wall Street have sky-rocketed her to fame, so joining the MCU as a recast Captain Marvel could be the perfect next step.





 10  Shailene Woodley&#39;s Action Movie Past Makes Her Perfect For Captain Marvel 
Divergent (2014), Big Little Lies (2017), Ferrari (2023)
        

Best known for her starring role of Beatrice &#34;Trix&#34; Prior in the Divergent film series, Shailene Woodley would perhaps be an unexpected actor to join the MCU as a new version of Captain Marvel. With Emmy and Golden Globe nominations under her belt, Woodley would certainly throw herself into the role of Carol Danvers, particularly after proving her strength and persistence in the Divergent films. Woodley has become more associated with independent films since her Divergent days, so a role in the MCU could bring her back into the public eye, and perhaps offer some redemption from the poorly-received Insurgent and Allegiant.





 9  Katee Sackhoff Has Experience In Previous Superhero Projects 
Battlestar Galactica (2004), Another Life (2019), The Mandalorian (2020)
        

Perhaps best known for her role of Starbuck in Battlestar Galactica, Katee Sackhoff would bring style and personality to the role of Captain Marvel in a rebooted MCU. Sackhoff has a huge amount of experience in sci-fi and action roles, so Carol Danvers would be the perfect choice for the actor, who previously voiced Black Cat 2099 in Marvel&#39;s Spider-Man: Edge of Time video game and She-Hulk in the animated Super Hero Squad Show. Sackhoff&#39;s recent stints in Another Life and The Mandalorian have proven that she would be a great fit for more cosmic adventures, especially those embarked upon by Captain Marvel in the MCU.





 8  Jessica Chastain&#39;s Previous Sci-Fi Movies Fit The MCU Perfectly 
Zero Dark Thirty (2012), The Martian (2015), Dark Phoenix (2019)
        

Jessica Chastain has been vocal on several occasions about having meetings with Marvel Studios, though she hasn&#39;t yet joined the MCU. Chastain did work with Marvel in 2019&#39;s Dark Phoenix, but she would benefit from portraying a long-lasting hero instead of a villain. Chastain has become famous for her intensity and commitment to sci-fi storylines, such as those in Interstellar and The Martian. However, she has also shown her lighter side in projects such as The Eyes of Tammy Faye, Crimson Peak and Madagascar 3: Europe&#39;s Most Wanted. Jessica Chastain will surely be joining the MCU, and this could be as a new iteration of Captain Marvel.
Jessica Chastain portrayed the villainous Vuk in 20th Century Fox&#39;s Dark Phoenix, a member of the D&#39;Bari race who had been tracking the Phoenix Force inside Sophie Turner&#39;s Jean Grey. 






 7  Jennifer Lawrence Portrayed Another Iconic Marvel Character 
Winter&#39;s Bone (2010), X-Men: First Class (2011), Don&#39;t Look Up (2021)


 







Jennifer Lawrence is a highly-acclaimed actor who has already shown a penchant for joining major superhero franchises, such as 20th Century Fox&#39;s X-Men franchise, in which she portrayed the younger iteration of Raven Darkhölme, a.k.a. Mystique. Prior to this role, however, Lawrence received an Academy Award for her role in Winter&#39;s Bone, making her a clear candidate for a major role in the MCU. Lawrence&#39;s understated confidence, action experience and slight comedic nature make her the perfect fit for the cosmic Captain Marvel. Carol Danvers would surely be a much more popular MCU superhero with Jennifer Lawrence in the driver&#39;s seat.





 6  Yvonne Strahovski Can Bring Drama &amp; Joy To Captain Marvel 
I, Frankenstein (2014), The Predator (2018), The Tomorrow War (2021)
        

Yvonne Strahovski was previously rumored to be in the running for the role of Carol Danvers when production on 2019&#39;s Captain Marvel was underway, so it&#39;s possible that she would be reconsidered for the part in a rebooted MCU. Strahovski&#39;s experience playing super spies in Chuck and 24: Live Another Day could allow her to easily slip into a role in the MCU, particularly as the universal protector Captain Marvel. Her more recent dramatic and sci-fi roles in The Tomorrow War, The Handmaid&#39;s Tale and Stateless would bring sophistication and intensity to Captain Marvel, but she also has an approachable nature that would make a new Carol Danvers very likable.





 5  Katheryn Winnick Has Previously Played Powerful Characters 
Vikings (2013), The Dark Tower (2017), Polar (2019)
        

Between 2013 and 2020, Katheryn Winnick took on the hard-hitting and powerful Lagertha in Vikings, showing her worth as a dedicated and strong superhero. Roles in action thrillers such as The Dark Tower, Polar and The Marksman would inform the darker tones of the MCU&#39;s Captain Marvel. In a 2015 interview with IGN, Katheryn Winnick noted that she has always been &#34;a fan of comic books,&#34; and that she would &#34;love to play an action hero,&#34; suggesting that the role of Carol Danvers&#39; Captain Marvel would be the perfect fit for Winnick. Captain Marvel could be much more brutal if Winnick assumes the role in a new MCU continuity.





 4  Natalie Dormer Was Wasted In Her Previous MCU Role 
Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Game Of Thrones (2012), The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014)
        

Natalie Dormer achieved widespread stardom as Margaery Tyrell in Game of Thrones, putting her at the forefront of many viewers&#39; minds while casting for Captain Marvel was taking place. Dormer evidently didn&#39;t receive the role in the previous MCU project, but she could certainly be in the running to replace Brie Larson after an MCU reboot. Dormer previously appeared briefly as Private Lorraine in 2011&#39;s Captain America: The First Avenger, but this minor role didn&#39;t do justice to the actor&#39;s effortless talent. Roles in the Hunger Games franchise, The Forest, In Darkness and Patient Zero also set her up perfectly for a potential action-heavy future in the MCU.​​​​​​​





 3  Rebecca Ferguson&#39;s Previous Action Roles Fit The MCU 
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015), Life (2017), Dune (2021)


 







Captain Marvel&#39;s high-octane cosmic adventures call for an actor well-accustomed to intense roles, and Rebecca Ferguson might be the perfect candidate. Ferguson&#39;s breakthrough role saw her performing opposite Tom Cruise in 2015&#39;s Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation as MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust, a role that she reprised in 2018&#39;s Fallout and 2023&#39;s Dead Reckoning Part One. The action-heavy nature of the Mission: Impossible franchise, as well as Ferguson&#39;s roles in sci-fi projects such as Life, Dune and Silo, have set her up as the perfect choice for a new version of Captain Marvel, not least because she&#39;d bring a level of gravitas and charisma that would be hard to match.





 2  Olivia Wilde Could Act &amp; Direct In A Captain Marvel Reboot 
Tron: Legacy (2010), Cowboys &amp; Aliens (2011), Don&#39;t Worry Darling (2022)
        

Olivia Wilde is currently developing a female-led project for Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe, but this wouldn&#39;t discount her as a candidate for Captain Marvel in the rebooted MCU. Wilde has recently been the subject of controversy during the production of 2022&#39;s Don&#39;t Worry Darling, a film which she directed and starred in, yet this could set her up for a double-role in the MCU. Wilde has previously noted that she would love to join the MCU, and loves the way that Marvel develops its projects, and with previous sci-fi roles in Ghostbusters: Afterlife, The Lazarus Effect and Tron: Legacy, Wilde could direct and act as the cosmic Captain Marvel.
Olivia Wilde&#39;s female-led superhero project isn&#39;t listed on Sony&#39;s release schedule, but is still in development, despite several Spider-Women being featured in the SSU&#39;s upcoming Madame Web movie. 






 1  Heidi Moneymaker Has Been Black Widow&#39;s Stunt Double For Several Years 
War Of The Worlds (2005), Star Trek (2009), Captain America: Civil War (2016)
        

Heidi Moneymaker may not be an actor in the traditional sense of the word, but she has been a stunt double for some iconic performers over the duration of her rich career. Moneymaker has most consistently been the stunt double for Scarlett Johansson during her MCU journey as Natasha Romanoff&#39;s Black Widow. Moneymaker already has a level of superhuman ability, being able to pull off some incredibly taxing stunts, so she would bring a level of strength and sheer power to Captain Marvel. Her lengthy experience working with Marvel Studios means she is surely on the studio&#39;s radar, which could see her step into the spotlight following a rumored reboot.
