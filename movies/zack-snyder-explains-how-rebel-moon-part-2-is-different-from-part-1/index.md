# Zack Snyder Explains How Rebel Moon Part 2 Is Different From Part 1


## SUMMARY 



  Zack Snyder reveals that Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver is more of a &#34;war movie&#34; compared to Part One.   The stakes will be higher for the farming colony on Veldt, with the director referring to Kora as &#34;the most wanted fugitive in the history of the galaxy.&#34;   Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver doubling down on action could be concerning since Part One largely prioritizes style over substance, but the upcoming director&#39;s cut could provide more character depth.

## Literature Review

Director Zack Snyder teases what’s to come from Netflix’s Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, explaining how it will be different from Part 1.




Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver director Zack Snyder explains how the follow-up is different from the first film. Hitting Netflix in December, Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire tells the epic tale of one lone warrior&#39;s attempts to rally a fighting force to protect a peaceful farming colony from an evil galactic empire. The story is very much left unresolved, however, with a sequel set to release this spring after an R-rated director&#39;s cut.




Now, ahead of Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver&#39;s release date, Snyder teases in an interview with EW what&#39;s to come from the sequel. While keeping many of the specifics shrouded in mystery, the director promises some big changes from Part One. Check out his full comment below:



&#34;Part Two is a war movie. We know that Noble&#39;s alive and Belisarius has given him the task of finding his daughter and bringing her back to him at all costs. So the stakes have risen for the village from ‘hey, we want some of your grain’ to now ‘you’re harboring the most wanted fugitive in the history of the galaxy.’”



  


 Can Rebel Moon – Part 2: The Scargiver Avoid Part 1&#39;s Flaws? 
Zack Snyder&#39;s Director&#39;s Cut Could Be The Answer
          




While visually quite stunning and featuring some standout action sequences, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire&#39;s reviews have criticized the film for lacking interesting characters, themes, and depth. With Snyder teasing that the sequel will have even more action and that it plays more like a &#34;war movie,&#34; it&#39;s possible that the follow-up will fall into the same trap as the first film, relying on flair and style over any real emotion or substance.

Without compelling characters to care about, action sequences lose their impact, which could be a problem for Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. The announced director&#39;s cut, however, could potentially serve as a solution to this issue. Snyder has previously revealed that the director&#39;s cut, which features about one whole hour&#39;s worth of new footage, is heavy on character work, meaning the action in the sequel could end up feeling more impactful.

The Rebel Moon ending certainly paves the way for an interesting conflict to come, but the main version of the film has undoubtedly fallen short of expectations in some respects. The promise that the director&#39;s cuts of both the first and second films will flesh out characters and give more depth to everything is promising, but it raises the question of why Snyder&#39;s director&#39;s cuts couldn&#39;t have just been the main versions of the films. In any case, audiences don&#39;t have long to wait for Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, which is now only a few months away.
