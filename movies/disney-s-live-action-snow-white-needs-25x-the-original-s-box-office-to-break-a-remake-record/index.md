# Disney s Live-Action Snow White Needs 25x The Original s Box Office To Break A Remake Record


## SUMMARY 


 

Disney&#39;s live-action Snow White must outperform the original animated movie at the box office by a wide margin to be considered as successful as the first.


Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was a massive box office hit, earning $66 million worldwide and becoming the highest-grossing animated movie.


To match the success of the original, Disney&#39;s live-action Snow White must surpass $1.6 billion, the highest-grossing Disney live-action remake record set by The Lion King in 2019.
