# Blumhouse s First 2024 Horror Movie Is So Different 1 Year After M3GAN s $180M Success


## SUMMARY 



  Blumhouse&#39;s upcoming horror movie, Night Swim, is very different from its previous success, M3GAN, both in terms of story and marketing approach.   Night Swim lacks the viral social media marketing and following that made M3GAN popular and attracted a wider audience.   While Night Swim is not expected to replicate M3GAN&#39;s box office success, it can still be considered a success with projected earnings of $38M-$65M domestically.

## Literature Review

It&#39;s been almost one full year since M3GAN was released and became a box office hit, but Blumhouse&#39;s first 2024 horror movie is so different.




Blumhouse is kicking off the 2024 horror movie year with Night Swim, and it feels completely different one year removed from M3GAN&#39;s surprise success. One of the biggest surprises of 2023 was how well M3GAN performed at the box office for Blumhouse. The horror studio watched the killer A.I. doll movie become a dominant force with a lack of competition and impressive rave reviews. M3GAN&#39;s box office climbed to reach $180 million worldwide, giving Blumhouse a new horror franchise. Furthermore, it could have signaled a chance for the studio to shift its approach to early-year releases.




Audiences have the opportunity to watch Night Swim in theaters almost exactly one year to the day that M3GAN came out. The film is a feature-length adaptation of the 2014 short from director Bryce McGuire and stars Kerry Condon and Wyatt Russell. It&#39;s a supernatural horror movie instead of a technological horror movie, as Night Swim&#39;s threat revolves around a haunted pool, not a deadly doll meant to help children. The very different stories are one thing, but Blumhouse&#39;s first horror movie of 2024 is almost nothing like M3GAN in terms of its tone, marketing, and more.


 Night Swim Doesn&#39;t Have M3GAN&#39;s Viral Social Media Marketing &amp; Following 
          

One of the key reasons why M3GAN was so popular was because of the viral nature of its marketing campaign and social media following. Blumhouse played into the film&#39;s potentially sillier moments from the very beginning, giving audiences a glimpse of M3GAN&#39;s dances, songs, and off-beat sense of humor. It helped position M3GAN as a &#34;fun&#34; slasher movie instead of a more traditional scary movie. This made it possible to draw in bigger crowds, including people who possibly otherwise would not have checked out a horror film, due to the sheer nature of M3GAN and the growing popularity around the movie.





 

The issue for Blumhouse is that Night Swim does not have those same qualities. There is certainly nothing wrong with the studio making horror movies that have different tones and stories, but how well they perform can largely depend on when they come out. Night Swim is more of a traditional horror movie involving a scary monster and a family in danger, so it was never going to catch on as well as M3GAN did. But since Blumhouse is even using M3GAN&#39;s popularity to promote Night Swim, noting that it comes from the same producers, the differences between them become more apparent.



 Night Swim Will Not Replicate M3GAN&#39;s Box Office (But Can Still Be A Success) 
          




Night Swim might not become a massive $180 million box office success like M3GAN, but the good news for Blumhouse is that it doesn&#39;t need to. The movie was likely made on a relatively small budget to help make its odds of becoming profitable higher. Box office projections for Night Swim call for a $17M-$25M opening weekend (via Box Office Pro) and make between $38M-$65M domestically in total. That would likely be enough for the film to be viewed as a success, and that does not even take into account any international appeal. Even with a strong worldwide performance, Night Swim is unlikely to be the next M3GAN for Blumhouse.
