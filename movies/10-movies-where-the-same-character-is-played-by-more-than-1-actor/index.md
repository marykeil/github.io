# 10 Movies Where The Same Character Is Played By More Than 1 Actor


## SUMMARY 


 Casting multiple actors to play a single character is often used in high-concept movies to add a fantastical element or enhance certain parts of the production. 
 It can also be a creative way to incorporate beloved actors from previous installments in franchises. 
 This casting technique has been used in various movies, including Shazam!, Doctor Who: The Movie, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

## Literature Review

There are various occasions where it&#39;s necessary for movies to feature more than one actor in the same role, but sometimes it&#39;s a creative choice.




A movie character can sometimes take more than one actor to be sufficiently portrayed, although the reasoning behind a multi-actor performance can differ due to various factors. Whenever this casting quirk occurs, the movie often has a fantastical element that makes the move necessary. While the narrative of certain movies can revolve around a split casting, sometimes it&#39;s used as a gimmick or a film-making technique to ensure certain elements of the production come together.
Movies that have more than one actor play a single role can often be very high-concept. However, some films simplify the trend so that it doesn&#39;t distract from the story as a whole. Regardless, some of the best movies of all time use this casting technique. Certain movies in this category are part of storied franchises, and casting a beloved actor from a previous installment can also factor into the decision of whether their presence needs augmenting.
            
 
 10 Movies That Wasted Perfect Casting Choices 
Some actors seem like they were born to play a specific role, so it&#39;s a real pity when they don&#39;t get to share their talent with the world.












 








 10  Shazam! (2019) 
Zachary Levi and Asher Angel shared the lead role
        

  Shazam!  
Adventure
Action
Fantasy



  Release Date    April 5, 2019     Director    David F. Sandberg     Cast    Faithe Herman , Jack Dylan Grazer , Ian Chen , Asher Angel , Marta Milans , Mark Strong , Cooper Andrews , Andi Osho , grace fulton , Zachary Levi , Ron Cephas Jones , Ava Preston    


Shazam! as a movie wouldn&#39;t work without a double casting. Angel&#39;s 14-year-old character, Billy Batson, has superpowers bestowed upon him that only manifest each time he says &#34;Shazam!&#34; Upon speaking the word, he transforms into an older and stronger-looking man. However, the character is still Billy, no matter what form he takes. Billy isn&#39;t the only role in Shazam! to be cast in this way. Later in the film, his brothers and sisters are all granted the same powers, and each have a younger and older actor to accommodate their respective transformations.
The character of Shazam is known as Captain Marvel in the comics, but the name is dispensed with in the movie to avoid confusion with the MCU and related properties. 






 9  Doctor Who: The Movie (1996) 
Sylvestor McCoy finally got his regeneration scene after a seven-year wait
        

After the classic run of Doctor Who was canceled in the 1980s, one of the casualties was the fact that Sylvestor McCoy, the serving Doctor at the time, was never afforded the chance to film his regeneration scene. In 1996, Doctor Who: The Movie was released in an attempt to revive the show. Although Paul McGann was cast to lead the movie as the Eighth Doctor, the story began with McCoy&#39;s Seventh as he meets his end and becomes McGann.
The Seventh and Eighth Doctors do not star alongside each other in Paul McGann&#39;s 1996 Doctor Who movie. Instead, the franchise&#39;s tradition extends to the big screen, with McCoy passing the baton to McGann. Although there have been Doctor Who stories that include multiple actors simultaneously playing the Doctor, none of them happened during the franchise&#39;s sole feature-length film.





 8  Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets (2002) 
Polyjuice Potion affords actors unique opportunities


 







  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  
Adventure
Family
Fantasy
Mystery



  Release Date    November 13, 2002     Director    Chris Columbus     Cast    Emma Watson , Rupert Grint , Kenneth Branagh , John Cleese , Robbie Coltrane , Warwick Davis , Richard Griffiths , Richard Harris , Jason Isaacs , Daniel Radcliffe , Alan Rickman , Maggie Smith    


Shapeshifting in movies can be a challenging thing to portray, partially due to the fact that an actor is called upon to emulate the mannerisms of both another actor and their character. Such a thing occurs in Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets when Harry Potter and Ron Weasley take the form of Crabbe and Goyle. While trying to infiltrate the Slytherin common room, Crabbe and Goyle&#39;s actors, Jamie Waylett and Josh Herdman, are actually playing Harry and Ron post-transformation.
Waylett is channeling Rupert Grint&#39;s Ron Weasley for the scene, and Herman is emulating Daniel Radcliffe&#39;s Harry Potter. The meta scenario becomes more complex when it&#39;s considered that Waylett and Herdman&#39;s performances aren&#39;t entirely their own. Grint and Radcliffe still provide their characters&#39; voices for the confusing sequence, replacing the dialogue provided by their castmates.





 7  Freaky Friday (1976) 
Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris had to switch roles
        

As one of the best body-swap movies, Freaky Friday follows a mother and daughter as they switch places and tackle one another&#39;s day-to-day lives. The nature of the movie means both Foster and Harris are called upon to play two roles each. Foster, who starts off the movie as daughter Annabel Andrews, is also tasked with playing her on-screen mother, Ellen Andrews, after the swap takes place. Foster&#39;s co-star, Barabra Harris, is responsible for doing the same, but in reverse.
There have been many remakes of Freaky Friday. The most notable is the 2003 version with Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. 






 6  Star Trek (2009) 
JJ Abrams&#39; first Star Trek reboot movie allowed franchise royality to return
        

  Star Trek (2009)  
 Sci-Fi
Action
Adventure
Thriller
Space



  Release Date    May 7, 2009     Director    J.J. Abrams     Cast    Chris Pine , Zoe Saldana , Zachary Quinto , Simon Pegg    


Star Trek&#39;s writer/director made a coy move with his dual-casting of Spock in his 2009 movie. Although the film was dressed as a reimagining of the Star Trek universe, it eventually became apparent that events were part of the main canon - albeit in an alternate timeline. The revelation is cemented when Leonard Nimoy enters the fray as the &#34;prime&#34; Spock, coming face-to-face with Chris Pine&#39;s Captain Kirk, a character originally played by William Shatner.
            
 
 10 Casting Choices That Saved Their Movies From Being Completely Forgettable 
Plenty of bad movies have great performances, but these castings elevated the entire movie from mediocrity and made them very watchable. 



Although the return of Nimoy could be interpreted as nothing more than fan service, the truth is actually much more meta. The older Spock&#39;s presence in Abrams&#39; movie allows the original Star Trek timeline to stay intact, while creating a new universe in which Abrams can make changes that don&#39;t impact the canon of the classic franchise. The choice is very respectful as well as creative, and allowed Quinto to remain in the role of Spock and have the character interact with his older self during the ending of the 2009 Star Trek movie.





 5  Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) 
Ray Park was only the physical embodiment of Darth Maul
        

  Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace  
Action
 Sci-Fi
Adventure
Fantasy



  Release Date    May 19, 1999     Director    George Lucas     Cast    Ewan McGregor , Liam Neeson , Natalie Portman , Jake Lloyd , Ahmed Best , Ian McDiarmid , Anthony Daniels , Kenny Baker , Pernilla August , Frank Oz , Ray Park , Samuel L. Jackson    


Darth Maul instantly became a hit when The Phantom Menace was released. His iconic dual-bladed crimson lightsaber and recognizable face tattoos made him impossible to forget. The Star Wars prequels are still maligned by certain fans, but the movies are remembered for their brilliantly choreographed fight sequences. Ray Park helped the trilogy get off to a flying start in his shared role of Darth Maul. Park is a martial arts specialist, so his grace and movement during the movie&#39;s lightsaber duels is something to behold.
However, Park&#39;s voice was clearly not suitable for the role. As a result, what little dialogue Maul has in the movie is actually delivered by Peter Serafinowicz. Although most known in the comedy arena, Serafinowicz has a versatile voice that&#39;s capable of adding gravitas to almost any character. His role in bringing Darth Maul to life may only have been minor, but it helped to complete the illusion.
Star Wars is no stranger to casting a voice actor independent of the person shown on screen. The franchise&#39;s most famous villiain, Darth Vader, is physically portrayed by Dave Prowse in the original trilogy, but James Earl Jones provides the voice. 






 4  Looper (2012) 
The movie&#39;s casting decisions were influenced by a sci-fi trope
        

  Looper  
 Sci-Fi
Action
Thriller



  Release Date    September 28, 2012     Director    Rian Johnson     Cast    Bruce Willis , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Emily Blunt , Paul Dano , Noah Segan , Piper Perabo    


Looper is a mind-bending adventure full of paradoxes and alternate timelines. Events can already be difficult to follow in a movie like Looper, so casting two different actors as the same character needs to be done correctly. The movie&#39;s main character, Joe, is played by both Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis, with each actor playing Joe from different points in his life.
Gordon-Levitt and Willis don&#39;t look too much alike in reality. The crew of Looper were clearly aware of this fact, as Gordon-Levitt&#39;s appearance in Looper is altered with prosthetics to make him more visually similar to Bruce Willis. The two versions of Joe are not kept separate, as the older and younger versions of the character interact many times during the movie.





 3  Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) 
The finale of Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man trilogy featured more than one Peter Parker


 







  Spider-Man: No Way Home  
Action
Adventure
 Sci-Fi
Superhero



  Release Date    December 17, 2021     Director    Jon Watts     Cast    Zendaya , Jon Favreau , Tom Holland , Jamie Foxx , Alfred Molina , Benedict Cumberbatch , Marisa Tomei , J.B. Smoove , Benedict Wong , Jacob Batalon    


A crossover often shows the meeting of various characters that typically would never interact, but No Way Home only shares half of those criteria. There have been several Spider-Man movie franchises since the turn of the century, but until 2021, they were largely unconnected. Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland have all led live-action Spider-Man movies as Peter Parker, but No Way Home brought all three variants of the beloved character together as part of the MCU&#39;s multiverse saga.
            
 
 20 Great Actors Whose Incredible Range Is Proven By Just 2 Performances 
Great actors can adapt to any role their careers may lead them to. Here are 20 actors where two of their film or television roles prove their range.



Spider-Man&#39;s legal situation is complicated. Sony own the movie rights, and as a result, Spider-Man movies were made in isolation from the main MCU for a long time. Tom Holland entering the MCU as Peter Parker was part of a deal between Disney and Sony, and the same arrangement made it possible to retroactively make previous Spider-Man movies part of the main movie continuity. Maguire&#39;s and Garfield&#39;s Spider-Man variants may have started in legal limbo, but No Way Home has all three live-action Peter Parkers in the same place, and are just as canonically relevant as each other.





 2  The Greatest Showman (2017) 
The movie needed a young PT Barnum to begin proceedings
        

  The Greatest Showman  
Musical



  Release Date    December 20, 2017     Director    Michael Gracey     Cast    Zac Efron , Hugh Jackman , Zendaya , Natasha Liu Bordizzo , Rebecca Ferguson , Michelle Williams , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II    


The Greatest Showman led to Hugh Jackman becoming synonymous with the character of PT Barnum, but Jackman isn&#39;t the only actor to play the character in the movie. The early stages of The Greatest Showman features Ellis Rubin in the lead role. His transition into Jackman&#39;s older version of the character takes place during the time-jump montage that accompanies Rubin&#39;s sole song on the soundtrack, &#34;A Million Dreams.&#34; Rubin&#39;s role may only be relatively small when weighed up against Jackman&#39;s much larger part in the movie, but the sequence of a young Barnum is essential to understanding the character&#39;s journey.





 1  The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus (2009) 
Heath Ledger&#39;s character needed a partial recast due to his untimely passing


 







  The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus  
Fantasy
Adventure



  Release Date    October 16, 2009     Director    Terry Gilliam     Cast    Heath Ledger , Christopher Plummer , Verne Troyer , Andrew Garfield , Lily Cole , Tom Waits , Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell , Jude Law    


While many may remember 2008&#39;s The Dark Knight as Heath Ledger&#39;s final performance, it actually took place in 2009&#39;s The Imaginarium as Doctor Parnassus. Although it wasn&#39;t part of the original plan, the character of Tony was played by four separate actors. Heath Ledger was intended to lay sole claim to the role of Tony, but his death during the movie&#39;s production led to Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell all being brought on board to each play Tony.
Ledger still features as Tony for the majority of the movie, with the replacement actors only stepping in whenever the character steps into the magical world within the Imaginarium. Therefore, it wasn&#39;t a hard recasting of Ledger, but rather a process that was carried out to augment the late actor&#39;s unfinished performance so that the movie could be seen through to its completion.
