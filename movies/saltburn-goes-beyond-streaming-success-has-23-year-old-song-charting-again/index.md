Summary

  The movie Saltburn, now streaming on Amazon Prime, has revived a 23-year-old dance track, &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor.&#34;   The Saltburn soundtrack has caused the Sophie Ellis-Bextor hit to appear on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart at No. 7.   &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor&#34; is also ranked at No. 15 on the overall iTunes songs chart, surpassing popular tracks such as &#34;Houdini&#34; by Dua Lipa.  







Saltburn has propelled a 23-year-old dance track onto the charts. The new movie, which is now streaming on Amazon Prime, follows a lonely Oxford student named Oliver Quick (Barry Keoghan) who ingratiates himself into the rich family of his handsome classmate Felix Catton (Jacob Elordi) while spending the summer of 2007 at their eponymous palatial estate. The movie ends with Oliver, having murdered the majority of the family and come into ownership of Saltburn, dancing naked through the halls while listening to the 2001 Sophie Ellis-Bextor hit &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor.&#34;

In addition to the Saltburn soundtrack making &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor&#34; a viral hit in various TikTok videos and challenges, it has caused the song to appear on several major charts. It made its first-ever appearance on the Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart at No. 7 for the week of January 6 (higher than it ever originally ranked in the U.S., which was No. 9 on the Maxi-Singles chart). It is also No. 15 on the overall iTunes songs chart, above popular tracks including &#34;Houdini&#34; by Dua Lipa, which itself is No. 1 on the Billboard Dance/Electronic chart.





 Why &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor&#34; is Perfect For Saltburn 
          

The chart success of &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor&#34; shows how well-chosen it was to play during the memorable Saltburn ending. However, in addition to its sonic appeal, there are quite a few probable factors in why it was chosen for that sequence. This likely goes beyond director Emerald Fennell&#39;s seeming penchant for the pop music of the 2000s, which is implied by the fact that Paris Hilton&#39;s 2006 single &#34;Stars Are Blind&#34; played a major part in her previous feature Promising Young Woman.



&#34;Stars Are Blind&#34; is featured during a romantic montage in Promising Young Woman where Cassie (Carey Mulligan) and Ryan (Bo Burnham) sing along to the song as it plays on the radio in a store.




The song wasn&#39;t necessarily chosen because of the time period in which the movie takes place. Although the bulk of the Saltburn story is set in 2006 and 2007, the dance sequence is explicitly set during the COVID-19 era, which means it likely takes place in 2021 or later. This could have opened up the soundtrack to include a more contemporary song, but the fact that the Sophie Ellis-Bextor track plays instead belies the fact that Oliver has never truly let go of his obsession with Felix and the period in which it took place.




The lyrics of &#34;Murder on the Dancefloor&#34; also perfectly match the themes of Saltburn. In addition to the literal fact that Oliver is turning the site of several murders into his dance floor, other parts of the song reflect his violent and manipulative takeover of the Cattons&#39; lifestyle, including &#34;gonna burn this g----mn house right down&#34; and &#34;I know about your kind.&#34; The way it reflects the totality of Oliver&#39;s arc throughout the movie likely helped the song connect with audiences in such a potent way.
