The film has been praised for its sentimental moments, accuracy, and practical approach to visual effects.   Despite its lengthy runtime, Interstellar remains impactful and beloved by audiences, demonstrating the strength of Nolan&#39;s work.  





Christopher Nolan&#39;s 169-minute science-fiction epic Interstellar becomes just as powerful in a short video edit. The film depicts an uninhabitable, futuristic version of Earth, and a group of astronauts, led by Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), who travel through space to find humanity&#39;s new home. Along with McConaughey, the cast of Interstellar includes Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Matt Damon, Michael Caine, and more. The movie, which explores concepts related to astrophysics and time dilation, received positive reviews after its 2014 release.




A recent video edit, created by Zurik 23M, condenses the entire runtime of Interstellar into nearly eight minutes. Check out the footage below:

 Why Nolan Fans Love Interstellar So Much 
          




Interstellar contains many sentimental and heartbreaking moments that stand out among the rest of Nolan&#39;s filmography, particularly those involving Cooper&#39;s children. Realizing that Tom and Murph have grown up in his absence, McConaughey&#39;s character comes to regret leaving, and that final scene between him and Murph strikes a chord, as audiences watch a barely aged Cooper return. Interstellar has also been praised for its accuracy, with Neil deGrasse Tyson pointing out how well-constructed the movie&#39;s black hole was.

Interstellar creates a unique representation of outer space and the foreign, unoccupied planets that might exist outside this galaxy. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Production Design and Original Score (by Hans Zimmer), and won for Best Visual Effects. Nolan fans admire the director&#39;s practical approach in place of unnecessary CGI, and when it came to shooting two of Interstellar&#39;s most memorable locations, Iceland was revealed to be the backdrop.




It&#39;s interesting to see just how much audiences love Interstellar despite its length, although the success of Oppenheimer proves that Nolan&#39;s fanbase is incredibly strong, and growing. In fact, the science fiction movie is often considered one of his most well-known projects, which may be a testament to how powerful it really is. That it can remain this impactful and emotional even when trimmed down to a short edit shows Nolan&#39;s work speaks for itself.



Interstellar is available to stream on Prime Video and Paramount&#43;.
