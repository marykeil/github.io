 10  Many Rivers To Cross (1955) 
Directed by Roy Rowland
        

Many Rivers to Cross was a classic Western adventure set against the backdrop of the American Frontier in 1798. Starring Robert Taylor as Bushrod Gentry and Eleanor Parker as Mary Stuart Cherne as a couple who must evade local tribesmen while simultaneously falling in love in this underrated outdoor adventure. With equal parts action, comedy, and romance, Many Rivers to Cross brought to mind a past era of American history with the then-modern added wonder of stereophonic sound on the big screen.





 9  Alias Jesse James (1959) 
Directed by Norman Z. McLeod
        

A Western comedy directed by the Marx brothers’ collaborator Norman Z. McLeod, Alias Jesse James featured Bob Hope and Rhonda Fleming and told the story of an outlaw who tried to kill an insurance agent. Based on a true story, this comedy about fugitives who are in over their heads demonstrates that there are some problems a cowboy can’t shoot himself out of. A wacky and wild adventure, Alias Jesse James delivered the laughs and was an underrated treat for admirers of Bob Hope.





 8  The Apple Dumpling Gang (1975) 
Directed by Norman Tokar
        

The Apple Dumpling Gang followed the worst bank robbers in the Wild West, starring comedy duo Don Knotts and Tim Conway, in an outrageous story of gamblers duped into looking after orphans who strike gold. Set in the year 1878, The Apple Dumpling Gang was a Disney family comedy that featured inoffensive old-fashioned Western fun. While The Apple Dumpling Gang was not breaking any new ground with its comedy, it acted as an enjoyable farce that did not overstay its welcome.





 7  The Shakiest Gun in the West (1968) 
Directed by Alan Rafkin
        

Featuring Don Knotts as a cowardly dentist unwittingly embroiled in a Western adventure, The Shakiest Gun in the West was a fantastic remake of the 1948 movie The Paleface. The standout performance was by Barbara Rhoades as Penelope &#39;Bad Penny&#39; Cushings, a lady bandit who tricked Knotts&#39; character Dr. Jesse W. Heywood into a sham marriage. A beloved Western comedy, The Shakiest Gun in the West has been parodied in everything from The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance to the animated Western comedy Rango.





 6  Rustlers&#39; Rhapsody (1985) 
Directed by Hugh Wilson


 







A 1985 Western comedy, Rustlers&#39; Rhapsody took parodic aim at the singing cowboy B-movies of the 1940s and was a love letter by director Hugh Wilson to the Westerns he loved as a child. Starring Tom Berenger as Rex O&#39;Herlihan cowboy drawn out of his black and white world into a more self-aware setting where he knows the future due to its overreliance on Western clichés. A hilarious homage to old movies, Rustlers&#39; Rhapsody was ahead of its time and its meta-commentary on its own genre would be more at home in today’s contemporary comedy landscape.





 5  Evil Roy Slade (1972) 
Directed by Jerry Paris
        

A made-for-TV Western, Evil Roy Slade told the story of the meanest villain in the West and has gone on to become a cult classic. Featuring John Astin as Roy Slade, a boy unloved as a child who grew into a man who loved nobody, he became the leader of a gang of bandits in this clever comedy that keeps the jokes coming at a mile a minute. An underrated Western, Evil Roy Slade recalled the comedic style of Steve Martin’s The Jerk, but with horses and gunslingers.





 4  Maverick (1994) 
Directed by Richard Donner
        

Starring Mel Gibson as the card-playing con artist Bret Maverick, Maverick was based on the 1950s and early 1960s television series of the same name and was a charming homage to the earlier series. By effortlessly switching between action and comedy, Maverick succeeded in delivering an adventure for the whole family, propped up supporting cast members Jodie Foster and James Garner. An underappreciated 1990s comedic gem, Maverick was a modest success when released, but deserved to reach a larger audience.





 3  Three Amigos (1986) 
Directed by John Landis


 







Bringing together comedy legends Chevy Chase, Steve Martin, and Martin Short, Three Amigos was about three silent movie actors who are mistaken for real heroes by the people of a small Mexican village. The laughs kept coming as the trio attempted to maintain their reputation while stopping a group of mean-spirited bandits. With a talented cast, a silly sense of humor, and a distinctive style, Three Amigos was a too-often ignored Western comedy by the acclaimed director of The Blues Brothers John Landis.





 2  My Name Is Nobody (1973) 
Directed by Tonino Valerii
        

As a spoof of the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone and inspired by one of his ideas, My Name is Nobody worked incredibly well and featured a distinctive soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. Starring Terence Hill as Nobody, a stand-in for Clint Eastwood’s Man with No Name from the Dollars trilogy, My Name is Nobody walked the fine line between action and comedy and expertly comes together in a hilarious adventure. Henry Fonda also starred as Jack Beauregard, an aging gunman competing against Nobody.





 1  Cat Ballou (1965) 
Directed by Elliot Silverstein


 







Telling the story of the girl train robber Cat Ballou, this Western comedy starring Jane Fonda and Lee Marvin was a spoof adventure that acted as an incredible parody of the entire genre. A hilarious send-up of countless Western tropes, the real stand-out star was Lee Marvin who won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his dual role as Kid Shelleen and Tim Strawn. Full of satirical wit, juvenile lampoons, and Wild West mayhem, Cat Ballou still holds up nearly 60 years since its release.
