  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Denzel Washington&rsquo;s collaborations with director Antoine Fuqua rank among some of Hollywood&rsquo;s best movies, and the chemistry between the actor and the director has provided audiences with some of the most unforgettable moments in cinematic history. From their 2001 classic crime thriller, Training Day to 2023&rsquo;s The Equalizer 3, Washington and Fuqua have enjoyed a successful professional relationship that has lasted for over two decades. Although Washington was a well-established name in Hollywood before Training Day, Fuqua was a relatively new filmmaker whose excellent work on Training Day helped establish him as one of Hollywood&rsquo;s most bankable working directors.
Although Washington&rsquo;s more theatrical approach to acting as displayed in films like Mississippi Masala and Glory could have very easily clashed with the more suspenseful and action-driven sensibilities of Fuqua&rsquo;s The Replacement Killers and Bait, the continued success of their work displays an acute understanding of each other&rsquo;s strengths as well as their audience. some of Antoine Fuqua&rsquo;s best movies don&rsquo;t feature Washington, but the ones that do starkly stand out as some of his best because of the connection between the longtime collaborators. From crime thrillers to Westerns, Washington and Fuqua have successfully covered a wide range of topics in their movies.

Denzel Washington &amp; Antoine Fuqua&rsquo;s Next Movie Will Break A Massive Record Set 13 Years Ago
Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua are reteaming for another movie, and it will break a massive record for the actor set 13 years ago.</p>
<p>5  The Equalizer 2 (2018)
Washington reprises his role as Robert McCall in Fuqua&rsquo;s vigilante action-thriller</p>
<p>The Equalizer 2
The Equalizer 2 is the follow-up film to Antoine Fuqua&rsquo;s 2014 The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington as Robert McCall. The sequel was released four years later and follows McCall as he seeks revenge after one of his close friends is murdered. The film wasn&rsquo;t as well received as the first movie but was still considered a worthy addition to the Equalizer franchise.
Release Date   July 20, 2018    Director   Antoine Fuqua    Cast   Bill Pullman , Ashton Sanders , Denzel Washington , Pedro Pascal , Melissa Leo    Runtime   121minutes</p>
<p>The Equalizer 2 continues Robert McCall&rsquo;s quest for revenge as it sees him take on Dave York, a former DIA associate and friend. Although The Equalizer 2 performed well at the box office, its relative similarity to its predecessor and bland locations make it arguably the weakest entry in The Equalizer franchise. Nevertheless, Washington&rsquo;s successful portrayal of the skilled vigilante and the creative kills featured in the sequel both serve as the movie&rsquo;s highlights, thus reinforcing the strong chemistry between Washington and Fuqua. Despite The Equalizer 2&rsquo;s criticisms, the movie performed well enough to set the stage for a third entry in the franchise.</p>
<p>4  The Equalizer 3 (2023)
Washington reunites with Man on Fire co-star Dakota Fanning in Fuqua&rsquo;s latest revenge thriller</p>

<p>The Equalizer 3
Release Date   September 1, 2023    Director   Antoine Fuqua    Cast   Denzel Washington , Dakota Fanning , David Denman , Sonia Ammar    Runtime   109 Minutes</p>
<p>While The Equalizer 3 features much of the same violence and action seen throughout the previous two entries, Fuqua&rsquo;s decision to move the action from the United States to Southern Italy proves to be one of the movie&rsquo;s greatest strengths, as the new location and Italian mafia give the latest installment a fresh feeling. Additionally, Washington&rsquo;s chemistry with Man on Fire co-star, Dakota Fanning, is another welcome addition to The Equalizer franchise. With Washington&rsquo;s exceptional acting chops and Fuqua&rsquo;s masterful direction of the complex action scenes set against Italy&rsquo;s beautiful landscapes, The Equalizer 3 is miles ahead of its predecessor.</p>
<p>3  The Magnificent Seven (2016)
Fuqua and Washington&rsquo;s remake of Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven marks their third collaboration</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The Magnificent Seven
The Magnificent Seven is a new remake of the 1960 western action film that follows a group of seven warriors from different walks of life who join forces to liberate a town from an oppressive gold miner. When Bartholomew Bogue takes control of the town of Rose Creek, the beleaguered residence find themselves at his mercy. One woman seeking revenge and freedom finds U.S. Marshal Sim Chisholm, and convinces him to join their cause, as he recruits several gunmen, outlaws, and assassins willing to risk it all for a good deed.
Release Date   September 23, 2016    Director   Antoine Fuqua    Cast   Haley Bennett , ​Chris Pratt2 , Ethan Hawke , Sean Bridgers , Vinnie Jones , Matt Bomer , Byung-hun Lee , Denzel Washington , Peter Sarsgaard , Vincent D&rsquo;Onofrio , Cam Gigandet    Runtime   132minutes</p>
<p>Although Denzel Washington didn&rsquo;t want to make The Magnificent Seven, the movie&rsquo;s script and his role as the lead in his first Western were reasons enough to get him on board. The Magnificent Seven is a remake of the 1960 Western of the same name - itself a remake of the 1954 Akira Kurosawa film, Seven Samurai, and it sees Washington leading a rag-tag group of men on a bloody quest to liberate a small town. The Magnificent Seven features one of the greatest displays of Fuqua&rsquo;s action sensibilities, and with Washington&rsquo;s charisma carrying the movie&rsquo;s stacked cast, it remains one of the duo&rsquo;s most underrated collaborations.</p>
<p>2  The Equalizer (2014)
Washington&rsquo;s first foray as Robert McCall in Fuqua&rsquo;s original Equalizer installment</p>
<p>The Equalizer
The Equalizer is a crime-focused action-thriller franchise initially created by Michael Sloan and Richard Lindheim. The franchise began with the 1985 series that followed Robert McCall, a retired intelligence agent who uses his deadly and varied skillset to help those that society cannot save. The film franchise has stood out as the most iconic, with Denzel Washington in the role of the new Robert McCall, with a reboot television series starring Queen Latifah as Robyn McCall.
Created by   Michael Sloan , Richard Lindheim    First Film   The Equalizer    Cast   Denzel Washington , Edward Woodward , Queen Latifah</p>
<p>The Equalizer sees Washington&rsquo;s first venture into the role of Robert McCall, a former Marine and DIA officer, who works a humble job at a hardware store and intervenes when an underage sex worker is assaulted by members of organized crime. The Equalizer is loosely based on the 1980s TV series of the same name, and it serves as one of Washington&rsquo;s most prominent examples of going against type. Known for portraying men of valor, Washington&rsquo;s turn as a ruthless vigilante highlights the actor&rsquo;s incredible range, while also lending credence to Fuqua&rsquo;s talents behind the camera, considering the complexity of the movie&rsquo;s many action sequences.</p>
