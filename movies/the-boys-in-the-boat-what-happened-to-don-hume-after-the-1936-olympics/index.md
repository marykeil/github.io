## Literature Review

Jack Mulhern stars as Don Hume, one of the rowers in The Boys in the Boat – what happened to the athlete in real life after the Olympics in Berlin?




The Boys in the Boat revolves around the United States men&#39;s eight at the 1936 Olympics, including Don Hume, one of the eight rowers on the team. The 2023 biographical sports drama film, directed by George Clooney and written by Mark L. Smith, is inspired by a true story and based on Daniel James Brown&#39;s 2013 non-fiction novel, The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The book (and the movie) primarily focuses on Joe Rantz, another rower on the team. But the other athletes (like Hume) who made the win in Berlin, Germany, possible are also highlighted in the story.




Jack Mulhern stars as Hume in The Boys in the Boat, and other cast members include Callum Turner as Rantz, Joel Edgerton as Al Ulbrickson, Sam Strike as Roger Morris, Luke Slattery as Bobby Moch, Thomas Elms as Chuck Day, Tom Varey as Johnny White, Bruce Herbelin-Earle as Shorty Hunt, and Wil Coban as Jim McMillin. Of course, the film had to leave out some parts of these men&#39;s lives to tell a thoughtful and complete narrative about how the University of Washington men&#39;s rowing team unexpectedly won the gold medal at the 1936 Olympics. As a result, audiences were left wondering about some aspects of the story, like what happened to Hume following the Olympics.


 Don Hume Fought In World War II After The Olympics 
          

As depicted in The Boys in the Boat, Don Hume fell ill before the final race at the Summer Olympics. His past of working in a pulp mill had damaged his lungs, making him more susceptible to getting sick. Despite his poor state, Hume insisted on competing on that historic day in Berlin, Germany. After he helped the United States secure the gold medal in the stroke seat in the men&#39;s eight event at the 1936 Olympics, Hume helped the University of Washington&#39;s senior varsity eights win two national Intercollegiate Rowing Association titles. He assumingly retired from rowing, graduated from the University of Washington, and later fought in World War II.




According to Daniel James Brown&#39;s book, The Boys in the Boat: Nine Americans and Their Epic Quest for Gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Hume was drafted into the United States Merchant Marine during the war. He served from 1942 to 1945 before returning home. However, Hume&#39;s story doesn&#39;t end there.

                  6 Ways The Boys In The Boat Changes The True Story   The director and writer of The Boys in the Boat had to make some changes to the 2023 biographical sports film’s true story to dramatize the narrative.   



 What Else Don Hume Did Before His Death In 2001 
          

Following the end of World War II, Don Hume worked in the oil and gas drilling industry and was briefly the President of the West Coast Mining Association for one term. Aside from that, much of his life after the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, and World War II is unknown. According to The New York Times, Hume died on September 16, 2001, of complications from a heart attack and stroke. He was 86 years old. Hume&#39;s legacy lives on, though, as a charter member of the University of Washington&#39;s Husky Hall of Fame and a central figure in The Boys in the Boat.
