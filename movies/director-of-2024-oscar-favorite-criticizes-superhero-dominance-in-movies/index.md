## Literature Review

Alexander Payne, the acclaimed filmmaker who recently directed The Holdovers, levels criticism at superhero movies and their dominance in theaters. 




The Holdovers director Alexander Payne criticizes the superhero genre dominance of franchises like Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Universe. Superhero movies have become increasingly popular over the last decade, with some of the world’s highest-grossing movies of the last couple of years all falling into the superhero genre. Payne, who recently returned to filmmaking after a quiet couple of years, isn’t alone in criticizing the merits of these movies, as a number of other accomplished filmmakers have also recently come out to give negative feedback regarding the state of modern cinema and the rapid increase in the production of superhero movies in particular.




In a recent interview with The Guardian following the release of his latest Christmas comedy-drama, The Holdovers, which has received rave reviews and has been tipped for an Academy Award, the acclaimed filmmaker expressed his concerns about the current state of cinema. He explained that films nowadays run to a quicker rhythm, are less intelligent, and he also believes that: “If someone doesn’t fly in your film, they won’t give you the money to make it anyway.”


 Why Directors Need To Stop Blaming Superhero Movies For The State Of The Industry 
          

The trend of accomplished filmmakers criticizing superhero movies for the current state of the industry isn’t exactly new. For a few years now, established directors and filmmakers have come out to question the artistic merits and value of superhero movies, arguing that these movies sorely lack any form of depth. A couple of years ago, the legendary director Martin Scorsese made headlines when he declared Marvel movies “aren’t really cinema” and he compared the experience of watching a Marvel movie to going to a theme park.






The larger-than-life spectacle that they provide appeals to the mass audience and the major studios will almost always invest in movies that sell tickets at theaters, regardless of their quality.




In truth, Scorsese’s sentiment, along with the many other filmmakers who have taken an issue with superhero movies, isn’t without merit. Superhero movies have increasingly become tedious and formulaic, with many directors simply rehashing similar ideas. However, these superhero movies will most likely continue to grow in popularity because the larger-than-life spectacle that they provide appeals to the mass audience and the major studios will almost always invest in movies that sell tickets at theaters, regardless of their quality.

                  Why Superhero Movies ARE Cinema (&amp; Why The Debate Is Pointless)   Cinema is changing, and so are the movies that make it up. The question is, are superhero movies Cinema? Here&#39;s why they are.   




Its no secret that the major studios in Hollywood are mainly focused on producing movies that appeal to a massive audience. In the past, these studios mass-produced westerns and sappy rom-coms when demand for them was at an all-time high. These days, franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DC Universe are what command a lot of people’s attention and so, while the quality of these types of movies can be constantly debated, they don&#39;t seem to be going away anytime soon.
