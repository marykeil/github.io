## Literature Review

Emily Brontë&#39;s classic Wuthering Heights has been adapted quite a few times over the years, but which adaptation did it better according to fans?




Like many classic novels, Wuthering Heights has been adapted many times over the years. As one of the most famous love stories of all time, the source material continues to draw storytellers in with the challenge of adapting a story that has yet to be done with acclaim. Part of the challenge of bringing Brontë&#39;s story to screen is the sprawling nature of the novel, both in terms of space and time. The story follows two families over two generations, and despite being far from a feel-good story, people are still falling in love with it to this day. So, what are the best Wuthering Heights movie adaptations?
This ultimately depends on viewer preference, as each adaptation of Wuthering Heights differs in overall style and the number of plot points borrowed from the 1847 novel by Emily Brontë. Nonetheless, in terms of overall quality, there are ways to pinpoint which among these adaptations is the best Wuthering Heights movie or series. As different as they are, like all the Wuthering Heights references in Twilight, these adaptations across the decades prove just how deeply Brontë&#39;s work remains embedded in the cultural zeitgeist.
            
 
 10 Movies From Hollywood&#39;s Golden Age Worth Watching In 2020 
The golden era of Hollywood is called golden with a reason. Here are ten movies from that period that are worth watching today.












 








 11  Wuthering Heights (2003) 
A Musical Version Of Wuthering Heights
        

 Stream on Paramount&#43; 

This modern adaptation is generally considered to be the least appreciated of the movies. The basic premise is the same; a young woman named Cate accepts a marriage proposal from Edward, but remains in love with another man, Heath, after she&#39;s married. This movie introduces a musical aspect as the characters sing original songs throughout, but the effort ultimately wasn&#39;t successful. Though it&#39;s far from being the best Wuthering Heights movie, the songs are great, and that&#39;s what makes this MTV-produced adaptation unique.





 10  Wuthering High (2015) 
A Made-For-TV Drama Adaptation


 







 Rent now on Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

This Wuthering Heights Lifetime movie adaptation re-imagines the story of Cathy and Heathcliff in California between two high school students. A high school teen, Heath, is adopted by the wealthy and prominent Earnshaw family and begins a romantic relationship with his new step-sister. The basic premise is there, but this falls far from what viewers would expect from an adaptation of Wuthering Heights. A more teen drama, the movie stars James Caan as the patriarch of the Earnshaw family.





 9  Wuthering Heights (1962) 
A BBC Remake That Uses The Same Script As The 1953 Movie
        

Released in 1962, the BBC television adaptation is shorter and focuses on the first half of the book more with some great performances by Claire Bloom as Cathy, Keith Mitchell as Heathcliff, and Patrick Troughton as Hindley. The set is minimal and doesn&#39;t have many, if any, outdoor shots, which is odd considering what a big part the Yorkshire moors play in the novel. The outdated production value and over-the-top drama make this one difficult to watch for modern audiences, though it has its moments.





 8  Wuthering Heights (1967) 
A BBC Miniseries Based On Wuthering Heights
        

 Not Available To Stream 

This 1960s adaptation of Wuthering Heights was a BBC multi-episode miniseries that aired on television and had decent ratings. Ian McShane and Angela Scoular star as Heathcliff and Cathy, and it is a decent movie adaptation of the original novel that is set during the same period and attempts to follow the original text. The movie shifts between more of a stage play and a movie, so it is a bit lost at times, but overall it&#39;s an okay adaptation with some fine acting. The master tapes were wiped, so the only versions available are black and white film copies transferred to DVD.





 7  Wuthering Heights (1950) 
A Made-For-TV Version Starring Charlton Heston
        

 Not Available To Stream 

The 1950 version of Wuthering Heights, a made-for-TV movie, suffers from the low production values that one would expect from a project like this during that particular time. Another expected element present here is the inclusion of Charlton Heston, with melodramatic performances and production values that make it far from being the best Wuthering Heights movie. However, the source material is relentlessly dramatic, so perhaps all the melodrama can be forgiven considering when it was made.





 6  Wuthering Heights (2011) 
Won The Cinematography Award At Venice Film Festival
        

 Stream now on Peacock&#43; 

The 2011 adaptation of Wuthering Heights forgoes any emphasis on the romantic in favor of a focus on the raw elements of the story, from the setting to the characters. Things were considered too rough for some, who felt that the film might have benefited from paying closer attention to the more romantic, traditional elements of the novel. However, this may be the best Wuthering Heights movie for those who love the gothic world of Emily Brontë&#39;s tale of love, obsession, and revenge. It&#39;s certainly the most beautifully shot movie on this list, winning the Best Cinematography award at the Venice Film Festival.





 5  Wuthering Heights (1970) 
Picked Up A Golden Globes Nomination
        

 Stream now on Roku 

Starring Timothy Dalton as Heathcliff and Anna Calder-Marshall as Cathy, 1970&#39;s Wuthering Heights is one of the better loyal adaptations of the book. This version puts up a good fight for the title of best Wuthering Heights movie for its honest interpretations of the internal struggles of the main characters. Had the movie adapted the entire book instead of following the previous convention to adapt only the first half, it may have been the best adaptation ever. The movie was also a box-office success, making over $2.2 million, while picking up a Golden Globes nomination.





 4  Wuthering Heights (2009) 
An ITV Two-Part Series


 







 Stream now on BritBox 

This may be the most popular version of Wuthering Heights, despite being possibly the least accurate. There are changes to the order in which the events of the story are told, as well as several minor additions that, depending on one&#39;s view, add to the relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff. Other moments that are considered iconic from the book are left out, such as Cathy&#39;s ghost at the window and Heathcliff overhearing her speech to Nelly. However, the performances of the leads are good, with Charlotte Riley and Tom Hardy displaying great chemistry. Even Hardy&#39;s strange wig took nothing from the fact that he may be the best version of Heathcliff.





 3  Wuthering Heights (1939) 
Picked Up Eight Oscar Nominations, Including Best Picture
        

 Stream now on Prime Video 

This movie started the trend of telling only the first half of the story, ending with Cathy&#39;s death and forgoing the entire latter half of the plot in which Heathcliff enacts his revenge. It did end up winning an Oscar, despite complaints from those who felt that the story was too thin due to the choice to exclude the second half. Nonetheless, with legends like Laurence Olivier as Heathcliff and Merle Oberon as Cathy - combined with its fantastic cinematography and scoring - the 1939 version may be the best Wuthering Heights movie from the Golden Age of Hollywood.





 2  Wuthering Heights (1998) 
A BBC Television Adaptation
        

 Stream now on Peacock 

The 1998 adaptation gets points for accuracy, taking a little more time than its predecessor so that story beats feel less rushed. However, Heathcliff is slightly miscast, as this version makes him visually hardly distinguishable from Linton, his romantic rival for Cathy&#39;s affections. However, due to this version&#39;s devotion to accuracy, the most important, tragic plot points from the novel remain intact. Matthew Macfadyen plays Hareton, Hindley&#39;s illiterate son who works for Heathcliff when Lockwood arrives. Those who consider the book to be the best gothic novel often consider the 1998 adaptation to be the best Wuthering Heights movie.





 1  Wuthering Heights (1992) 
The First Movie To Adapt The Entire Wuthering Heights Novel


 







 Stream now on Paramount&#43; 

What&#39;s unique about the 1992 adaptation is that it features an introduction and voiceover from Emily Brontë (played by Sinead O&#39;Connor). In addition to this element, this adaptation is the only one to have the same actress play Cathy and Catherine (Juliet Binoche), with Ralph Fiennes as Heathcliff. While this adaptation has been criticized for rushing certain plot points, it does succeed at being the first movie to bring the entire novel - and not just its first half - to life. It&#39;s not perfect, but this 1992 adaptation is considered by many to be the best Wuthering Heights movie in terms of overall quality and rewatchability.
