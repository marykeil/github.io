## Literature Review

The coming months promise to offer a multitude of exciting additions to the Western genre. Here&#39;s 10 Western movies worth waiting for in 2024.




There are plenty of new Western movies on the horizon, with the genre experiencing something of a renaissance over the last decade. From John Wayne epics like The Searchers to Quentin Tarantino&#39;s Django Unchained, Westerns have been a staple of cinema since the dawn of moviemaking, and the genre is still alive and well in the 2020s, with some of the best modern movies in recent years being Westerns. Killers of the Flower Moon showcased the kind of brilliant and unique approaches to the genre still being made and there are new Western movies to look forward to in 2024 and beyond.
Though the genre has exponentially evolved, the overarching themes remain largely the same: justice, violence, life, and death in the frontier. It has been established as a quintessentially American genre, yet there have been brilliant non-American Westerns made as well, such as the groundbreaking Spaghetti Westerns of Italy. While new movies tend to be neo or revisionist Westerns that subvert genre conventions, there are as many new Western movies that stick closer to the traditional formula that made it popular in the first place too.

Cormac McCarthy&#39;s Dark And Brutal Western Odyssey

 5  Eddington 
Ari Aster&#39;s Dark Western Comedy


 







Following Hereditary, Midsommar, and Beau is Afraid, Eddington will be the fourth movie written and directed by modern horror luminary Ari Aster.

Apart from filming commencing in summer 2023, not much else has been revealed about Eddington, but several big names have circled the project, including Joaquin Phoenix, Emma Stone, Pedro Pascal, and Christopher Abbott.
In a Reddit AMA, Aster also dropped some clues:&#34;I don’t know if you’d call it a revisionist Western,&#34; said Aster (via World of Reel). &#34;It’s contemporary; one foot is in the Western and one foot is even more heavily in the noir genre. So it’s like a film noir ensemble Western dark comedy.”
