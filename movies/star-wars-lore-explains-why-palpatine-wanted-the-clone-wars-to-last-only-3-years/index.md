# Star Wars Lore Explains Why Palpatine Wanted The Clone Wars To Last Only 3 Years


## SUMMARY 



The Clone Wars only lasted three years because Palpatine wanted to keep the Jedi Seekers, the strongest and most skilled fighters, away and vulnerable to attack after Order 66.

Palpatine meticulously planned the Clone Wars, including a strict timeline, to ensure that the Seekers wouldn&#39;t have enough time to hear about and return to fight in the war.

Palpatine&#39;s plan to eradicate the Jedi Order couldn&#39;t be completed without eliminating the Seekers, as they posed a threat to his dark side power. However, some Seekers may have survived in the Outer Rim and Unknown Regions.

## Literature Review
Palpatine ensured the Clone Wars only lasted three years, which seems odd given he benefited from the darkness. But there&#39;s a surprising reason...



*[**Star Wars**](https://screenrant.com/tag/star-wars/)* lore explained why Sheev Palpatine only wanted the Clone Wars to last three years. The Clone Wars were Palpatine&#39;s twisted magnum opus. The amount of evil brilliance that went into creating and guiding them shows just how much of an evil genius Palpatine is. One question, however, is **why they didn&#39;t last for longer**. After all, it would seem intuitive that, with the panic and destabilization the war caused, the longer it lasted, the easier it would be for Palpatine to gain extra power. Yet, he took emergency powers and executed [Order 66](http://screenrant.com/star-wars-order-66-explained/) after only a few years.

Everything about the Clone Wars was carefully orchestrated. This included Palpatine planning out a [strict timeline when plotting out the Clone Wars](https://screenrant.com/clone-wars-timeline-seasons-events-when-explained/). This is unsurprising. Palpatine is possibly the most conniving, manipulative, and Machiavellian character in the *Star Wars* universe. While other terrifying Sith existed before Palpatine, his tangled webs of manipulation were set up over decades, extending through all three *Star Wars* trilogies. He cheated death by cloning himself to ensure his survival. He is meticulous. So then, it&#39;s interesting that he only wanted the Clone Wars to last three years. **However, there may be an important reason the Clone Wars only lasted three years**.



## Jedi Seekers Were The Jedi Order&#39;s Best Fighters

The *Star Wars* movies and TV shows mainly focus on characters from the [Jedi Temple](https://screenrant.com/star-wars-jedi-temple-canon-locations/) on Coruscant. As revealed in the *Star Wars: Force &amp; Destiny* sourcebook *Savage Spirits*, the Jedi Exploration Corps - also known as ExploroCorps - consisted of Jedi who operated far from the Galactic Core. Members of ExploroCorps - also known as Seekers - searched the galaxy&#39;s far reaches, helping people, fighting the dark side wherever they encountered it, and looking for Force-sensitive children to bring into the Order.

**The Seekers were the strongest and most experienced fighters in the Jedi Order**. This makes sense, as they never knew what kind of situation they would find themselves in traveling around the galaxy - and tended to operate without any backup. Plus, they needed to be extra skilled to protect themselves and any Force-sensitive children they found. As such, the Jedi Seekers were some of the galaxy&#39;s best defenders.

## The Seekers Were Far Away From The Clone Wars

Jedi Seekers did not stay at the Jedi Temple for long. They would travel very far, sometimes well out of the reach of long-range comms. As such, they were often out of touch with the goings-on of the Republic. **Being unreachable by available means of communication meant that they were not around to fight in the Clone Wars.** Many did not even know about the conflict until after it had ended. This effectively meant the Jedi were short-staffed, which explains why the Jedi who were fighting were so busy going from battle to battle, and why inflating the army with clones was accepted as necessary despite the questionable ethics of doing so.

## Palpatine Didn&#39;t Want The Seekers Around During Order 66

Palpatine wouldn&#39;t want the Seekers around during the Clone Wars - or during Order 66. Without the Jedi Seekers, the Jedi Order were short-staffed - and without the best of the best. Their most skilled fighters were gone, and it&#39;s reasonable to assume Palpatine had Count Dooku disrupt galactic communication so they couldn&#39;t be called back.

Had the Jedi Seekers returned, they would have swelled the ranks of the Jedi Order, meaning the clones would lose the advantage of numbers when they turned on their Jedi Generals. In reality, **there simply weren&#39;t enough Jedi to fight off the clone army when they betrayed the Jedi**. The more Jedi available to fight, the harder it would be for the clones to win. What&#39;s more, the Jedi Seekers were tremendously skilled, meaning it is likely they would have been [Order 66 survivors](https://screenrant.com/star-wars-order-66-jedi-survive-canon-who/). They were used to operating without backup, meaning they would be able to fight back even against the entire Galactic Empire.

Eliminating the Jedi Order was the most important part of Palpatine&#39;s plan, because only the light side of the Force threatened to reverse the dark. The Sith simply cannot abide the existence of the Jedi. So then, Palpatine&#39;s machinations could not be completed without the total eradication of the Jedi. Allowing the Jedi Seekers to return would have risked everything he had worked for.
