## Literature Review

Director Justin Lin debunks a popular Fast &amp; Furious 6 theory about one scene from the film as it relates to Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson’s feud.




Fast &amp; Furious 6 director Justin Lin addresses one theory regarding a Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson scene from the film, setting the record straight. Released in 2013, the sixth installment of the popular Fast &amp; Furious franchise sees Diesel&#39;s Dom Toretto and his crew of drivers facing off against Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). Reports of a feud between Diesel and Johnson emerged several years after the film&#39;s release, leading to some viral theories about one scene, in particular.




In a recent interview with Josh Horowitz on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Lin addresses theories about this viral Diesel and Johnson Fast &amp; Furious 6 scene, which sees the two actors speaking to each other but very clearly not looking at each other or standing remotely close together.


 

According to the director, the feud had nothing to do with the peculiar staging of the two actors, and it was all to do with the uneven ground they were shooting on. Check out his full comment below:


“Oh, at the garage? They were there. I’m telling you, it’s the craziest thing. That house is actually divided into four properties. So when they did the first Fast and Furious, they had to get all four properties to give them permission. Then they built the barn. The barn’s actually not real.
“And we had to rebuild that for [Fast 6]. I got there and there was four different properties and nothing was even. It was playing with my head. So when Vin was standing there, it was kind of this forced perspective that was happening. It was actually because, if you look at the ground, it was four different properties intersecting.
“I was like why does Vin’s head look so much smaller? At that lens, everything was distorting. I thought I was going crazy but then I realized, ‘Oh, it’s the ground.’





  


 Diesel &amp; Johnson&#39;s Fast &amp; Furious Feud Explained 
          

Understanding these Fast &amp; Furious 6 scene theories means understanding the history of the feud between Diesel and Johnson. Johnson first joined the franchise with 2011&#39;s Fast Five, playing the no-nonsense cop tasked with tracking down Dom and his team. The rivalry between Dom and Hobbs is one of the best aspects of the film and its sequels, and it turns out that the reason why may be because of some very real tension between Diesel and Johnson.

Reports of a feud between the two actors first emerged in 2016 during production on The Fate of the Furious when Johnson called out some of his unnamed male costars for unprofessional behavior. The actor&#39;s social media post didn&#39;t mention Diesel by name, but it became widely understood that the two actors didn&#39;t always see eye to eye. Diesel, for his part, would play down reports of a feud.






The Diesel and Johnson feud even pulled other Fast &amp; Furious cast members into its orbit, with Tyrese Gibson criticizing Johnson in 2017 for pursuing the Hobbs and Shaw spinoff, which delayed the release of F9.




Johnson, in a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, confirmed that he and Diesel shared no scenes together in The Fate of the Furious and that they have a &#34;fundamental difference in philosophies on how we approach moviemaking.&#34; Despite Johnson&#39;s claims that he wouldn&#39;t be returning to the franchise, the Fast X post-credits scene and Hobbs spinoff movie announcement suggests that time heals all wounds. Time still hasn&#39;t, however, made that one Diesel and Johnson Fast &amp; Furious 6 scene look any less odd.
