## Literature Review

The highly anticipate upcoming film adaptation of the musical Wicked will undoubtedly fix Hollywood&#39;s former The Wizard of Oz follow-up film mistake.




The unofficial sequel to The Wizard of Oz that developed out of Hollywood 39 years ago was a mistake that the highly anticipated Wicked movie will likely rectify. Various film endeavors emerged to expand or adapt the canon that originated from L. Frank Baum&#39;s 1900 children&#39;s fantasy book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, including the quintessential 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer musical fantasy, The Wizard of Oz. With child star Judy Garland in the lead and a whimsical story complemented by delightful musical numbers, The Wizard of Oz became the best-known creative venture to come out of Baum&#39;s influential novel.




In an effort to revive the magic of its predecessor, Walt Disney Productions released the live-action film Return to Oz as an unofficial sequel to The Wizard of Oz nearly half a decade later but missed the mark entirely. Hollywood&#39;s attempted return to Oz might soon be rectified though, as the upcoming Wicked film could emerge as the better follow-up to The Wizard of Oz. Details surrounding the Wicked movie suggest it will become a fantastic addition to Baum&#39;s ever-growing universe, indicating that it may succeed where Return To Oz failed.


 Return To Oz Was A Poor Follow-Up To The Wizard of Oz 
         

Return to Oz replaced The Wizard of Oz&#39;s original cast with a young Fairuza Balk as Dorothy, Piper Laurie as Auntie Em, and Deep Roy as the Tin Man, among others who reprised the beloved citizens of Oz. Although it attempted to recreate Dorothy&#39;s whimsical and crowd-pleasing adventures, Return to Oz endured a lackluster response that marked the installment as disappointing and too dark when compared to The Wizard of Oz. The installment possessed a few admirable characteristics that impressed audiences, such as beautiful visuals and incredible special effects, but its attributes weren&#39;t flattering enough to sway critical responses in the movie&#39;s favor.






Return To Oz received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.




Substantiated by a relatively low critics score of 58% on Rotten Tomatoes, Return to Oz was unsuccessful in utilizing its visible strengths to overcome its eerie nature. Even more, Return to Oz failed to attract a following and flopped tremendously at the box office, making a mere $11.1 million against a $27 million budget (via The Numbers). Because of the film&#39;s poor reviews and even poorer theatrical performance, Return to Oz was an inadequate follow-up to The Wizard of Oz, especially in view of the fact that its predecessor fostered timeless appeal and immeasurable worth.



 2024&#39;s Wicked Movie Can Succeed Where Return To Oz Failed 
          




Wicked will inevitably succeed where Return to Oz failed, for the upcoming film is giving every indication of becoming a blockbuster smash hit. Wicked is based on Gregory Maguire&#39;s novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, which forges a revisionist exploration of the setting and characters set up in Baum&#39;s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. In the form of a biography, Maguire&#39;s novel aims to set the perception of the Wicked Witch of the West straight by exploring her origins and challenging the notion of her &#34;villainy.&#34;

The Wicked movie, directed by Now You See Me 2&#39;s John M. Chu, plans to document the narrative set up in Maguire&#39;s novel through a two-part musical fantasy film experience. Since the narrative of Wicked takes place before and after the events of The Wizard of Oz, the upcoming film has the potential to surpass Return to Oz as the best follow-up film, given it fulfills its high expectations. With a superstar cast set to support it, a built-in following already teeming with anticipation, and one massive advantage over Return to Oz, Wicked could become bigger than Return to Oz and most films of 2024.




                  Universal Just Confirmed How Good The Wicked Movie Is Going To Be   Universal revealed footage of Wicked at CinemaCon, proving just how good the upcoming film adaptation of the hit musical is going to be.   



 Wicked Has 1 Massive Advantage Over Return To Oz 
          

Wicked&#39;s advantage over Return to Oz is in its musical nature. Although The Wizard of Oz was beloved for its stellar soundtrack and charming performances of hits like &#34;Over the Rainbow,&#34; &#34;We&#39;re Off to See the Wizard,&#34; and countless more, Return to Oz was frustratingly devoid of such characteristics. Wicked will remedy Return of Oz&#39;s poor decision, as it is not only a musical film but an adaptation of Winnie Holzman and Stephen Schwartz&#39;s critically acclaimed stage musical of the same name.




With enthralling musical numbers like &#34;No One Mourns The Wicked&#34; and &#34;Popular,&#34; Holzman and Schwartz&#39;s Broadway musical has been tried and tested, yielding countless shows since its original 2003 Broadway production, as a result. The Wicked movie casts Broadway superstar Cynthia Erivo as the Wicked Witch and bolsters its supporting characters with an ensemble of stars, including singer-songwriter Ariana Grande, Michelle Yeoh, and Jeff Goldblum as the titular Wizard of Oz, who are all sure to bring the magic of the musical on to big screens. Granted that it evokes the same response to the stage musical sensation, Wicked is guaranteed to rectify Hollywood&#39;s Return to Oz blunder.
