## Literature Review

The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.




Pedro Pascal&#39;s Din Djarin and his delightful ward Grogu will be appearing on the big screen in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, the next Star Wars movie. In 2019, viewers were introduced to the world of The Mandalorian, and they immediately fell in love with Din Djarin and Grogu (initially known as Baby Yoda). Just four years later, Lucasfilm has confirmed they&#39;re coming to the big screen.




The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s ending gave Din Djarin a new &#34;career.&#34; He&#39;s no longer a simple bounty hunter, but instead is working primarily for the New Republic. The timing couldn&#39;t be better in narrative terms, because the end of Ahsoka season 1 revealed Grand Admiral Thrawn - one of the greatest Imperial tacticians - has returned to the main Star Wars galaxy. All this means The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu - the cinematic continuation of Din Djarin&#39;s journey - should be an exciting Star Wars blockbuster.

 The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Continues From The Mandalorian Season 3 
          




The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is confirmed to spin out of The Mandalorian season 3, meaning it will begin with a new status quo for its heroes. Mandalore has been reclaimed, but Din Djarin has chosen to settle on the planet Nevarro, while pursuing a new career working exclusively for the New Republic. This means he&#39;ll be on the front lines of the Imperial resurgence under Grand Admiral Thrawn and the Imperial Shadow Council.



 Which Cast &amp; Crew Will Return For The Mandalorian Movie 
          

Jon Favreau (creator of The Mandalorian) is confirmed to be helming The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, and it&#39;s likely he has adapted his scripts for The Mandalorian season 4. At this stage, only Din Djarin and Grogu have been confirmed, but it&#39;s reasonable to assume other major cast from the Disney&#43; TV show will appear as well:




 Actor  Character   Pedro Pascal  Din Djarin   Katee Sackhoff  Bo-Katan Kryze   Carl Weathers  Greef Karga   Emily Swallow  The Armorer   Lars Mikkelsen  Grand Admiral Thrawn   Paul Sun-Hyung Lee  Carson Teva   



There&#39;s speculation Mary Elizabeth Winstead&#39;s Hera Syndulla and Eman Esfandi&#39;s Ezra Bridger will make the jump from Ahsoka season 1 given they&#39;re in the right galaxy. If this is the case, then there are significant implications for Ahsoka season 2; it may well mean that story focuses on Rosario Dawson&#39;s Ahsoka Tano and Natasha Liu Bordizzo&#39;s Sabine Wren, on the distant planet Peridea. More will become clear as details of the recently-confirmed Ahsoka season 2 are revealed.






 The Mandalorian and Grogu&#39;s Release Date Hasn&#39;t Been Announced Yet 
          

Lucasfilm has currently booked three release dates over the next few years:

  May 22, 2026   December 18, 2026   December 17, 2027  

The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is confirmed to be the first new Star Wars movie to release, although an official date has deliberately been withheld, likely meaning this is subject to change during production.
