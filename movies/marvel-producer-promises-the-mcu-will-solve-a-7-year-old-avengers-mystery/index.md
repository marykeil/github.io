## Literature Review

A seven-year-old Avengers mystery might finally be answered in the MCU, if recent comments from Marvel producer Brad Winderbaum are to be believed.




While promoting Marvel Studios&#39; Echo on Disney&#43;, executive producer Brad Winderbaum promised that a seven-year-old Avengers mystery would soon be solved in the MCU. Brad Winderbaum has served as an executive producer on over thirty projects with Marvel Studios, with the most recent being 2024&#39;s Echo, which reintroduces Alaqua Cox&#39;s Maya Lopez and Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Wilson Fisk to the MCU. The series will be the first to release under the Marvel Spotlight banner, meaning it may not connect as directly to the wider world of the MCU, but it&#39;s possible the series could still answer a burning question concerning a major MCU landmark that dates back to 2017&#39;s Spider-Man: Homecoming.




During an interview with Brandon Davis of Phase Zero that released on January 3, 2024, Brad Winderbaum answered with a blunt &#34;yes&#34; when questioned whether audiences will ever find out who bought Avengers Tower. The MCU landmark was first seen in 2012&#39;s The Avengers, then named Stark Tower, and became the headquarters of the Avengers following the Battle of New York. Even though Avengers Tower was sold in Spider-Man: Homecoming, the identity of the new owner is yet to be revealed, but Winderbaum&#39;s recent comments suggest this mystery could be solved in an upcoming Marvel Studios project, potentially even as early as Echo, which releases on Disney&#43; on January 9.


 

                  The MCU&#39;s Official Timeline Still Doesn&#39;t Answer A 6-Year-Old Avengers Question   Marvel Studios&#39; Official Timeline book has cleared up many MCU plot holes, but one burning, 6-year-old question still hasn&#39;t been answered.   





 Every MCU Character Who Could Be The Owner Of Avengers Tower 
         

The question of who bought Avengers Tower has been a profound mystery since the building was sold suddenly during Spider-Man: Homecoming, and there have been several theories about the Tower&#39;s new owner in the seven years since the Phase 3 project. During the same Phase Zero interview, Hawkeye and Echo star Vincent D&#39;Onofrio, who has reprised his role of Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. Kingpin, from Marvel Television&#39;s Daredevil series, responded to theories that Kingpin may be the building&#39;s new owner. D&#39;Onofrio stated that he &#34;can&#39;t answer any of those questions,&#34; neither confirming nor denying, so Avengers Tower could have transformed into Fisk Tower in the MCU.

Several other high-profile Marvel characters have also been suggested as candidates for Avengers Tower&#39;s new owner. These include the likes of Reed Richards and the Fantastic Four, who could have transformed the Tower into the Baxter Building, Norman Osborn, a.k.a. the Green Goblin, who may have established Oscorp in the Tower, and even a variant of Kang the Conqueror, Mister Gryphon, who may have formed QENG Enterprises in Avengers Tower. It&#39;s also possible that someone not yet seen in the MCU, such as Doctor Doom, may have purchased Avengers Tower, so the idea that viewers will soon find out the answer to this Avengers mystery is a very exciting prospect.
