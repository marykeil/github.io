# Where Exactly The Rugby Teams Plane Crashes In Society Of The Snow


## SUMMARY 



  Society of the Snow is a faithful retelling of the tragic 1972 Andes flight disaster, which emphasizes the remoteness of the crash location.   The survivors of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 endured extreme cold, injuries, and starvation for 72 days in the isolated Valley of Tears.   The altitude of the crash site, at 11,710 feet, posed a major challenge for the survivors and made rescue attempts incredibly difficult.

## Literature Review

The plane crash in Society of the Snow constitutes the main element of the movie&#39;s plot. Here&#39;s where the event took place in real life. 




Society of the Snow, J.A. Bayona&#39;s faithful retelling of the 1972 Andes flight disaster, centers around a terrible plane crash, yet – perhaps understandably – it isn&#39;t always clear exactly where the crash took place. The movie tells the story of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, which tragically crashed on October 13 1972, leaving the survivors stranded for 72 days on the exposed Andean mountain slopes. Although the real crash location has subsequently been evaluated and confirmed, at the time the mystery of the plane&#39;s location was central to the story.




Of the 40 passengers and five crew members present on board, only 16 survived the ordeal. Battling bitterly cold weather, horrific injuries, and utter isolation, the passengers were eventually forced to resort to cannibalism to stave off their hunger. Such an extreme response under the circumstances, coupled with an inspirational story of survival, goes some of the way towards explaining why the story of Flight 571 continues to exert such a powerful hold over many people&#39;s imagination. However, it is only in understanding the terrifying remoteness of the real crash that the full scale of the Society of the Snow true story becomes clear.

                  The First Trailer For Netflix&#39;s Society Of The Snow Hides The Movie&#39;s 2 Biggest Weapons   The trailer for Society of the Snow offers a look at the intense and heart-wrenching survival movie, but it hides the film’s two best creative assets.   


 Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 Crashed In The Valley Of Tears In Argentina&#39;s Mendoza Province 
         




The real crash in Society of the Snow actually took place at the so-called &#34;Valle de las Lágrimas&#34; – a.k.a. The Valley of Tears. Despite the plane&#39;s original final destination of Santiago in Chile, the Valley of Tears is actually in a remote part of Argentina&#39;s Mendoza province in the Andes. At the time, the valley and its glacier were actually unnamed, taking on the &#34;Tears&#34; moniker in the aftermath of the accident.

The remoteness of the crash site was a huge factor in the tragedy that followed. The location lies between several imposing peaks, including the 4,280 metre (14,040 ft) high Tinguiririca volcano and the 4,650 metre (15,260 ft) high Mount Seler, just east of the Chilean border. However, despite its undoubted inaccessibility, the location was not actually as remote as it originally appeared. Tragically, the survivors were unaware that they were just 13 miles away from the abandoned Hotel Termas El Sosneado, a former hot springs resort that would have provided some shelter. However, thanks to the valley&#39;s distinctive geography, it was impossible to know just how close this was without a huge slice of luck.






 The Crashed Plane Was At An Elevation Of 11,710 Feet On The Mountain 
          

Although the lack of food and major injuries sustained by many passengers presented an obvious challenge, perhaps the survivors&#39; greatest obstacle was the altitude of the crash site. The plane was so high up in the mountains that the group had to endure temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius, despite it being summer. Given that they had no suitable winter clothing, their chances were slim from the outset.

The altitude also made any rescue attempts incredibly difficult. Searching on foot simply wasn&#39;t an option, meaning that authorities had to use their own planes to search for the survivors. In fact, in the immediate aftermath, several planes flew directly over the site but were unable to make out the plane&#39;s white wreckage against the snow. This makes the real story of Society of the Snow even more tragic, as there could potentially have been a very different outcome.
