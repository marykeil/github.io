## SUMMARY

The film&#39;s release date has been moved to March 29, 2024, giving it the entire month of April to build its box office numbers before the summer movie season begins in May.   With the previous four films in the Monsterverse franchise collectively earning about $1.941 billion globally, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire only needs to earn around $59 million to push the franchise past the $2 billion mark, which is a major milestone.

## Literature Review

When Godzilla x Kong comes out in March 2024, it will certainly help the Monsterverse reach a very impressive milestone after just five movies. 




When Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is released in March 2024, it will almost certainly push the Monsterverse past an impressive financial milestone. The fifth movie in the Legendary Pictures&#39; Monsterverse, following 2021&#39;s Godzilla vs. Kong, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will explore Titan lore and Hollow Earth more than any other film in the series. The new cast of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, along with a new adversary for Godzilla and King Kong, promises to bring an interesting spin and team-up opportunities for the franchise&#39;s two most famous monsters.




Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire announced recently it will be released earlier, moving from April 12, 2024, to March 29. This move means that the movie will not compete in its opening weekend with other major movie releases that month, including Dune: Part Two and Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Debuting the latest out of all three of those projected blockbusters, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will have the whole month of April to build its box office numbers before the summer movie season kicks off in May. If history holds, however, it won&#39;t take that long for this new Monsterverse movie to take the franchise past a significant milestone.


 Godzilla X Kong Will Help The Monsterverse Become A $2 Billion Franchise 
          

The first four films in the Legendary Pictures&#39; Monsterverse have combined for about $1.941 billion globally, meaning Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire only needs to earn around $59 million to take the franchise into the rare $2 billion territory. Several movie franchises have also crossed the $2 billion threshold, but they often feature significantly more than five movies. In less than 10 years since Godzilla premiered with a global box office of more than $500 million, the Monsterverse is set to cross $2 billion collectively.




Godzilla: King of the Monsters had a steep box office drop after 2014&#39;s Godzilla and 2017&#39;s Kong: Skull Island. However, the 2021 kaiju team-up Godzilla vs, Kong proved to be a massive rebound and was able to take the franchise right to the doorstep of $2 billion globally. With the two most popular Titans poised to share the big screen again, it will only be a matter of time before the franchise smashes the $2 billion mark.



 How Much Money Godzilla X Kong Will Make At The Box Office 
          

Based on the previous box office performance of the other Monsterverse films, there is a reasonable way to project what Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire will make at the box office. All four films reached at least a $100 million U.S. box office total. Each movie reached at least $270 million at the international box office as well. Looking at those numbers together, every movie in the franchise made at least $380 million globally, and three of the four films made more than $465 million.




 Title  Domestic Box Office  International Box Office  Global Box Office   Godzilla  $200,676,069  $328,400,000  $529,076,069   Kong: Skull Island  $168,052,812  $393,019,247  $561,072,059   Godzilla: King of the Monsters  $110,500,138  $272,799,776  $383,299,914   Godzilla vs. Kong  $100,916,094  $367,127,758  $468,043,852   



The only real question will be if Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire can reach the $2 billion mark in its opening weekend in late March. Each of the Monsterverse films has seen decreasing numbers in their first weekend, with Godzilla vs. Kong (the latest film from 2021) taking in $32.2 million in its opening weekend. If that trend continues, the Monsterverse might have to wait until the first weekend in April to become a $2 billion franchise, but it will inevitably reach that milestone not long after this latest installment is released.

              Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire  After nearly destroying each other in 2020&#39;s Godzilla vs. Kong, the giant Titans are back to face a new dangerous threat, but this time, they are on the same side. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire is the fifth film in Warner Bros.&#39; growing Monsterverse franchise and will be directed by Adam Wingard.    Release Date    March 29, 2024     Director    Adam Wingard     Cast    Dan Stevens , Rebecca Hall , Brian Tyree Henry , Kaylee Hottle , Fala Chen     Studio(s)    Legendary Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Franchise(s)    Godzilla , King Kong , Monsterverse
