# King Kong Becomes An Action Star In Convincing, Explosive Art


## SUMMARY 



  King Kong is depicted as an action star in AI-generated images, holding a gun in classic settings from the movie.   The King Kong franchise has traditionally followed a classic tale without the ape using a gun.   It&#39;s possible Kong could use a similar weapon in the Monsterverse depending on what happens in Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.

## Literature Review
King Kong becomes an action star in convincing, explosive art that sees the famous ape wielding a gun in familiar settings from the movies.




King Kong art shows the titular character transforming into an action star, brandishing a gun in familiar locations from the movies. The original premise of the film involves Kong falling in love with a human woman named Ann, only to be taken from his home on Skull Island to New York City. There, the final conflict of the film plays out, as the giant ape climbs the Empire State Building.




Now, u/memory_for_sale on the r/midjourney subreddit has created a series of AI-generated images depicting King Kong as an action star.


 

He is shown in classic settings from the movie while holding a gun, with the final image showing an explosion behind him. This reflects a whole new type of Kong, which could have proven a formidable opponent.


 What&#39;s Next For King Kong? 
          

King Kong&#39;s many movies explore the classic tale of him being brought from Skull Island to the mainland. However, the only time an ape has used a gun in the franchise is Son of Kong, when Carl Denham has his weapon stolen. For the most part, however, a number of the films have followed similar beats, highlighting how much of a classic tale it has become.




Recently, though, the character has been introduced into Legendary&#39;s Monsterverse, where he has fought with and worked alongside Godzilla. This version was introduced in a heroic capacity in Kong: Skull Island before going on to battle against the famed kaiju in Godzilla vs. Kong. In 2024, he will be teaming up with the massive reptilian yet again in the upcoming Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.

Given the action-packed King Kong images posted to r/midjourney, it&#39;s clear some are anticipating his next thrilling appearance in the Monsterverse.

Godzillla x Kong: The New Empire is slated for release on April 12, 2024.
