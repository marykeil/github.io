Mickey 17 is set to be Joon-Ho’s first movie since the release of his critically acclaimed comedy thriller Parasite, which confirmed Joon-Ho as one of the best and most exciting movie directors of his time. This upcoming movie is, however, the acclaimed director’s first major foray into the world of science fiction. Previously, Joon-Ho mostly directed dramas and crime thrillers.




Pattinson has also confirmed that the forthcoming movie is different from anything he’s done before. Considering Pattinson has starred in several unique and varied productions that have tested him both physically and mentally, stating that Mickey 17 is unlike anything he’s done in the past is a good sign for the upcoming movie.

Following the movie’s announcement, Warner Bros released a short trailer for Mickey 17 which featured Pattinson’s character asleep in a chamber of some sort. Since the release of this trailer, plot details about Mickey 17 have been limited and there’s been no confirmation if the movie is going to closely follow Edward Ashton’s book. There may be a wait for Warner Bros to announce a new release date, but hopefully, that’s sooner rather than later.
