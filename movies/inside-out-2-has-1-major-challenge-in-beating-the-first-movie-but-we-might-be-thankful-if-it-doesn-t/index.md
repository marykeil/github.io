## Literature Review
Inside Out 2 is one of Pixar’s biggest 2024 releases, but the sequel will struggle to outdo 1 moment from the original — and perhaps it shouldn’t try.


Summary

  Inside Out 2 will struggle to beat the original&#39;s saddest scene, which may come as a relief for viewers.   The upcoming sequel will explore new emotions, giving it the opportunity to take a different approach than the first movie.   Inside Out 2 will be released on July 14, 2024, nearly a decade after the original, but it is still highly anticipated.  






Inside Out 2 has one major challenge when it comes to outdoing its predecessor, but it might be a good thing if it doesn&#39;t beat the original in this area. The original Inside Out proved a huge success for Disney and Pixar, bringing in $857 million worldwide and becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 2015 (via Box Office Mojo). The animated hit follows the emotions of a young girl named Riley, focusing primarily on five of them: Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness. Given Inside Out&#39;s emotion-centric storyline, the film tugged at viewers&#39; heartstrings — and one scene, in particular, proved a tearjerker.

The popularity of Inside Out made its sequel one of Pixar&#39;s most-anticipated upcoming movies, but Inside Out 2 has taken a while to materialize. Inside Out 2 will finally hit theaters on July 14, 2024, nearly a full decade after the original&#39;s release. And although Inside Out 2 promises to be just as engaging as the first movie, the sequel will struggle to beat its saddest scene. For viewers&#39; sakes, it might be a relief if the follow-up doesn&#39;t go there and takes a fresher approach instead.

              Related   Inside Out 2&#39;s New Storyline Can Succeed Where Pixar&#39;s $20 Million Flop Failed   Inside Out 2 explores themes similar to a previous Pixar movie that flopped, but its new storyline could succeed where the other failed.    


 Inside Out 2 Will Struggle To Beat The First Movie&#39;s Bing Bong Death Scene 
          

Inside Out has many memorable scenes, but Bing Bong&#39;s death is probably the moment from the 2015 release that hits the hardest. In fact, it may be one of the saddest scenes in a Pixar movie to date — and it outdoes a lot of emotional farewells in other unrelated projects as well. Fittingly, Inside Out nails the emotion of this moment, proving it has what it takes to address its themes in the first place. Bing Bong&#39;s death is part of why the movie works so well. Inside Out 2 will struggle to replicate this moment or outdo it — and it&#39;s possible the sequel just shouldn&#39;t try to.



Inside Out is available to stream on Disney&#43;.






 Inside Out 2&#39;s New Emotions Can Make It Very Different To The First (&amp; That&#39;s Good) 
          

A new slate of emotions is already confirmed for Inside Out 2, with the trailer confirming that Anxiety is joining the sequel&#39;s lineup and promotional art showing four new emotions coming out of the floor beneath the originals. These newcomers can help make Inside Out 2 stand out from its predecessor, giving its story a fresh tone and approach. Given the amount of time between the two films, Inside Out 2 really should bring something new to the table. Its updated roster of characters offers the opportunity for that — and for making it a more lighthearted approach to human emotion.

After all, if characters like Sadness and Anger are taking backseats for Inside Out 2, it wouldn&#39;t make sense for the film to deal with grief. Characters like Anxiety and Envy suggest storylines centered on other scenarios entirely. That means Inside Out 2 probably won&#39;t feature anything nearly as tragic as Bing Bong&#39;s death.
