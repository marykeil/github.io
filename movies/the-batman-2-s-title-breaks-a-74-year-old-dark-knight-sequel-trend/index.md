## Literature Review



A sequel to Matt Reeves’ The Batman is set to be released in 2025, and the movie’s official title breaks a decades-old Batman sequel trend. The big screen has seen various live-action versions of Batman, some more successful than others, and while the DCU brings back Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck’s versions in The Flash, in a different universe Robert Pattinson played Bruce Wayne in the movie simply titled The Batman.




The Batman follows a younger Bruce Wayne in his second year of crime-fighting in Gotham City, who (alongside James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright) and the Gotham City Police Department) is going after a mysterious serial killer known as The Riddler (Paul Dano). This leads Batman into Gotham’s criminal underworld, led by Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) and Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot (Colin Farrell), where he also meets Selina Kyle (Zoë Kravitz). The Batman was teased as the first entry in a new Batman trilogy, but news about the sequel was slow following the movie’s success. However, it’s now confirmed to happen and has been given an official title: The Batman - Part II.

 The Batman - Part II Is The First-Ever Numbered Batman Movie Sequel 
Most Batman Movies Have More Specific Titles 
   Close     




The Batman - Part II marks a first in Batman’s film history as it’s the first sequel to be numbered. Batman’s first big screen adventure happened in 1943 as a 15-chapter theatrical serial, and it was simply titled Batman, and in 1949, a second serial was released titled Batman and Robin. Years later, in 1966, the now classic Batman TV series got a film adaptation with the same title and starring Adam West and Burt Ward. The Caped Crusader didn’t return to the big screen until 1989 with Tim Burton’s Batman, which got a sequel in 1992 titled Batman Returns. Though not a sequel to Batman Returns but still a continuation of Warner Bros’ Batman movie series, Joel Schumacher brought Batman Forever, followed by the sequel Batman &amp; Robin.


 




The Caped Crusader got another chance in 2005 in Christopher Nolan’s Batman Begins, the first entry in what would become his Dark Knight trilogy. Batman Begins was followed by The Dark Knight (widely regarded as one of the best superhero movies ever made) and The Dark Knight Rises, continuing the trend of giving more specific titles to Batman sequels instead of numbering them. There has, of course, been one more Batman - Ben Affleck&#39;s DCEU portrayal, who appears in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Justice League (2017), and The Flash (2023), as well as being mentioned in several other DCEU movies. However, Affleck&#39;s version of the Caped Crusader doesn&#39;t have a solo film, let alone a sequel.

 Why A Part II Title Makes Sense For The Batman&#39;s Sequel 
A More Direct Continuation Of The First Film
          

The Batman - Part II’s title is a lot more significant than being the first numbered Batman movie sequel, as it immediately shows that it’s a more grounded sequel. &#34;Part II&#34; could be hinting at The Batman 2 being a more direct continuation of the events in the first movie, and it’s especially exciting given the introduction of Barry Keoghan’s Joker at the end. The Batman teased a team-up between the Joker and Paul Dano’s Riddler now that they&#39;re cell neighbors in Arkham Asylum, so The Batman - Part II could see this partnership blossoming. The Batman’s ending saw the title character aiding recovery efforts after Gotham was almost destroyed and vowing to inspire hope in the city, but it surely won’t be able to shake off all the chaos he and Selina went through. Although Warner Bros. could change The Batman - Part II’s title at some point, for now it’s one that makes sense and makes the sequel a lot more exciting.




              The Batman - Part II  The Batman Part II is the sequel to Matt Reeve&#39;s The Batman, released in 2022, and will continue where the original film left off. The film shares a universe with the HBO Max original Penguin series and sees the return of the Riddler and a different incarnation of the Joker.    Release Date   October 3, 2025    Director   Matt Reeves    Cast   Robert Pattinson
