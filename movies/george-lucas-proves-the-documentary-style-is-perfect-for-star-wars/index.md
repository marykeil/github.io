## Literature Review

The documentary style of filmmaking is absolutely perfect for the Star Wars franchise, and George Lucas has given definitive proof of that fact.




George Lucas has proven that Star Wars is perfectly suited to the documentary style of filmmaking. When thinking of Star Wars, the last thing that comes to mind is documentary. Set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, the franchise falls under the genres of science fiction and space fantasy. These are not genres typically associated with documentaries. However, the documentary style had more of an impact on Star Wars than it appears at first glance.




A big part of any movie is how it is filmed. Different genres have different filming conventions in the same way they have story conventions. Documentaries tend to be filmed at wide angles that allow them to maintain an &#34;outside looking in&#34; feel. They are often filmed partially with hand-held cameras for a more wobbly effect reminiscent of camcorders or, in modern times, smartphones. This makes them appear candid and improvised. As it turns out, this style has long since been influencing Star Wars, and Lucas himself has proven why it works for the franchise.

 George Lucas&#39; Background Before Star Wars... Was In Making Documentaries 
         




Before George Lucas made his foray into the science fiction and space fantasy realms, he was a documentarist. Lucas made his first documentary, 1:42.08, in 1966. The somewhat odd name of his senior project for the University of Southern California (USC) comes from the lap time of the Lotus 23 race car - the film&#39;s subject. It&#39;s a visual tone poem, with most of the soundtrack being the sound of the car&#39;s engine.

His second documentary, The Emperor, was made in 1967. It is a short film documentary on DJ Bob Hudson, nicknamed &#34;The Emperor.&#34; It was created while he was a graduate film student at USC. Lucas made a third documentary titled 6-18-67 in 1967. Named for the date that the film was completed, this quasi-documentary short film was also a tone poem. While it ostensibly focuses on the filming of the 1969 movie Mackenna&#39;s Gold, much of it consists of time-lapse cinematography of the landscape of the Arizona desert where Mackenna&#39;s Gold was being filmed.

His last documentary film before filming Star Wars was simply titled Filmmaker. Made in 1968, this 30-minute film focuses on the filming of Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s 1969 movie The Rain People. This film was quite successful, with Coppola saying in Tetro: How To Make Movies that it may even have been better than The Rain People itself. Coppola was inspired by Lucas&#39; cinematography and used the same camera dolly on Tetro that Lucas had used on Filmmaker. It was, incidentally, Lucas&#39; last short film before his first feature-length movie, THX 1138.






 George Lucas Deliberately Made Star Wars With A Documentary Style 
          

Given how much of his school experience focused on short-form documentaries, it is unsurprising that Lucas carried over his documentary filming techniques into Star Wars. A social media post by MakingStarWars shares what Lucas had to say about crossing his documentary style over into Star Wars. Originally source in J.W. Rinzler&#39;s The Making of Star Wars, Lucas says this:


&#34;I shoot in a very particular way, in a documentary style, and it takes a lot of hard editing to make it work.&#34;



 

Lucas hired Gilbert Taylor, a cinematographer responsible for documentaries such as A Hard Day&#39;s Night, as Director of Photography. Lucas wanted there to be a &#34;nervous &#39;now&#39; quality&#34; to Star Wars. To achieve this, he went with a semi-loose form in the way the scenes were shot, which gave them a sense of being &#34;captured.&#34;




This is noticeable in several scenes. For example, when the rebels are looking for a missing Luke Skywalker and Han Solo on Hoth in The Empire Strikes Back, there&#39;s a scene of the pilot trying to signal them. This is shot from an awkward, close-up, slightly low, wide side angle that looks like someone is in the co-pilot seat filming him.

Another example of this format is when Obi-Wan Kenobi is training Luke Skywalker on the Millennium Falcon. The frames in the scene are shot at angles that look like someone is standing there in the room filming them with a hand-held camera. These include shots from the side that feel just a little too far back and obscure the actors&#39; faces a bit too much. It, unsurprisingly, is reminiscent of shots from A Hard Day&#39;s Night.

 Lucas&#39; Documentary Style Was Key To Star Wars&#39; Success 
         

 Usually, space fantasies and science fiction movies make an effort to have grand cinematography. Sweeping drone shots, pristine angles, and third-person shots add a fantastical element to the cinematography that fits the fantastical setting. Lucas&#39; choice to film in a documentary style was an unorthodox one. However, it benefited the franchise.

Something that fantasy and science fiction movies risk is losing their audience. While epic alien worlds are exciting, if there&#39;s no human element, the world feels unrealistic. This can cause audiences to lose focus or struggle to connect with the characters and the story. Filming in a more documentary style gave Star Wars a distinctly personal feel.

More than that, it goes alongside an overall aesthetic choice to portray a lived-in galaxy. This makes the world-building of Star Wars feel authentic, and it&#39;s a big part of why there are so many stories set in a galaxy far, far away. This fantastical universe has a distinctly human bent to it. This gives a nice balance between keeping the setting interesting and new while also ensuring it isn&#39;t so alien as to feel completely disconnected from reality. The documentary style and overall aesthetic are the heart of Star Wars.






Filming in a more documentary style gave Star Wars a distinctly personal feel.




Unfortunately, given the change in directors and new technology, the Star Wars sequel trilogy didn&#39;t follow this documentary forma. This is perhaps part of why the sequels didn&#39;t connect as well with audiences. The cinematography was beautiful, but it didn&#39;t hold to Lucas&#39; techniques. This took away some of the elements that made the original trilogy feel so human. Future Star Wars movies, then, could benefit from returning to Lucas&#39; original documentary style.



All Star Wars movies and TV shows are available to stream on Disney&#43;.
