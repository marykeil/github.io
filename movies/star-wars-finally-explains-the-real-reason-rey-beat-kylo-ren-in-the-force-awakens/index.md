Star Wars reveals another key reason why Rey was able to beat Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens, going beyond Kylo&#39;s wound from Chewbacca.


Summary

  Rey gained knowledge and skills through her connection with Kylo Ren, allowing her to tap into his training and skills.   Kylo Ren was wounded by Chewbacca&#39;s bowcaster, which he believed inhibited his ability to defeat Rey.   Rey had a strong bond with the Skywalker lightsaber&#39;s kyber crystal, which helped her defeat Kylo Ren.  





Star Wars has provided another key reason why Rey beat Kylo Ren during their duel in The Force Awakens. Despite having no formal training of her own, Rey was able to defeat Kylo Ren just before the Resistance destroyed Starkiller Base. Although the confrontation was initially met with some controversy and criticism, the Star Wars canon has provided a handful of reasons why the odds were in Rey&#39;s favor, including one connected to the legendary Skywalker saber.




Following his murder of his father Han Solo, Kylo Ren pursued Rey and Finn into the forests of Starkiller Base where he easily dispatched Finn. However, Rey used the Force to reach out and claim the Skywalker saber she had initially rejected on Takodana. To that end, Rey was remarkably able to hold her own and even wound Kylo Ren before the planet&#39;s destruction ended their duel. Keeping that in mind, new evidence in the Star Wars timeline has revealed another reason why Rey had the advantage, even though Kylo Ren had the greater training and skills.

 Rey Had Gained Knowledge Through The Force Dyad 
Kylo Ren Was Also Wounded By Chewbacca&#39;s Bowcaster
         

Firstly, it&#39;s been confirmed by sequel trilogy novelizations that Rey gained knowledge and skills through her connection with Kylo Ren as a rare Star Wars Force dyad, a bond that wouldn&#39;t be fully explained until The Rise of Skywalker. Despite her lack of training, The Last Jedi&#39;s novelization by Jason Fry confirms Rey instinctually made a degree of Kylo&#39;s training her own, tapping into the knowledge through their bond even if she didn&#39;t fully understand in the moment. Essentially, the Force bond Kylo Ren established when he tried entering Rey&#39;s mind created a link through which his knowledge and skills were passed as Rey could access his mind in return.

Likewise, The Rise of Skywalker novelization by Rae Carson confirms that Kylo Ren had been seriously wounded by Chewbacca&#39;s bowcaster, a blow Kylo believed inhibited his ability to defeat Rey on Starkiller Base. It&#39;s also likely that Ren pridefully didn&#39;t take into account the increased ability Rey gained by accessing his own mind. However, the Star Wars canon has recently provided yet another reason why Rey was able to best Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens.





 



 Rey Had Been Called By Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Lightsaber, Bonding With Its Kyber 
The Kyber Spoke To Rey
          

Before the events on Starkiller Base, Rey discovered the lightsaber of Anakin Skywalker which had also been wielded by his son Luke in the original trilogy of films. To that end, Maz Kanata confirmed that it had called out to her, hence the vision she received in the Force upon touching the legendary weapon and its major legacy. However, new additions to the canon support the idea that it was specifically the living kyber crystal within that spoke to Rey.

As seen in the canonical Star Wars #35 by Charles Soule and Madibek Musabekov, Luke encounters a kyber crystal specialist who reveals that the living kyber has a means of talking and calling to those who are attuned and willing to listen. This tied incredibly well with Kanata&#39;s claim in The Force Awakens that the Skywalker saber was calling out to Rey. The implication is that when she finally answered the saber&#39;s call at the end of The Force Awakens, Rey and the kyber forged a powerful bond through the Force, which in turn helped her defeat Ren.




Luke also bonded with a piece of young kyber he was given in Star Wars #35. Receiving a vision in the Force just like Rey in The Force Awakens, the transparent kyber crystal turned green once their own bond was forged, the crystal Luke eventually uses for his own lightsaber seen in Return of the Jedi. As such, this new narrative parallel between Rey and Luke is quite impressive in terms of the greater Star Wars timeline.

                  Every Star Wars Movie, Ranked Worst To Best   Looking at all nine Skywalker Saga entries and three spinoffs, we crown the best Star Wars movie in our full ranking of the galaxy far, far away.   



 For All His Greater Skill, Kylo Ren Was Fighting With A Broken Kyber Crystal 
His Kyber Was Damaged And Inferior
          

Compared to Kylo Ren and his own lightsaber, it&#39;s quite apparent that Rey had a superior bond with the Skywalker saber and its kyber, supporting her victory over Ren in The Force Awakens. This is because when Kylo Ren was corrupted to the dark side, he bled his original blue kyber crystal, giving it the crimson color typically associated with the practices of the Sith where they killed Jedi and claimed their kyber crystals as dark trophies.




Although making his kyber bleed was meant to be symbolic of Kylo killing his past self as Ben Solo, he ended up cracking the crystal and making it unstable from his rage. This explains the need for the twin exhaust vents on either side of Kylo Ren&#39;s Star Wars lightsaber. Not only does this suggest that his bond was inferior to Rey&#39;s bond with the Skywalker saber, but it&#39;s also indicative of how unstable his commitment was to the dark side itself, seeing as how he was constantly resisting the light&#39;s pull in Star Wars&#39; sequel trilogy.
