Many of the characters of the Hunger Games franchise have unique names, and the meanings behind them serve to foreshadow their roles in the story. As a series set in the future, it makes sense that most of the names within The Hunger Games or The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes would be unfamiliar to modern audiences. Some are inventions of author Suzanne Collins, while others came from notable Greek and Roman figures of history. Regardless, it seems that Collins took great care in choosing her characters&#39; names, building in layers of symbolism and connections to their roles or eventual fates.

The Hunger Games draws significant inspiration from the Roman Empire, specifically the gladiatorial games. While exploring the totalitarian government of Panem and the brutal Hunger Games themselves, the series creates an impactful commentary on a variety of social concepts. This is driven home, in part, by the characters&#39; prophetic names. Collins is far from the first author to consider her character&#39;s futures when naming themâ€”it&#39;s a common literary practice going even further back than Shakespeare. However, the prophetic names in The Hunger Games were artfully subtle, adding even more flavor to the stories within.
