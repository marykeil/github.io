  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Superhero actors often go to drastic measures to effectively portray fantastical characters, but movies from the DC Universe and beyond often feature the most impressive. Whether through CGI, prosthetics, or dramatic physical changes, many actors and filmmakers went above and beyond to depict DC&rsquo;s heroes and villains. Indeed, some proved so influential that they shaped all subsequent character designs and created legends outside the superhero genre.
Movies based on DC Comics have proliferated the genre since the 1951&rsquo;s Superman and the Mole Men starring George Reeves as Superman. The entire back catalog features numerous franchises and series concurrent to the DCEU timeline - such as The Batman movies and2024&rsquo;s Joker: Folie À Deux. Considering each of these, movies based on DC Comics have demonstrated the pinnacle of physical transformation in adapting beloved characters to cinema.</p>

Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), The Dark Knight Rises (2012)</p>
<p>Batman Begins
Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s take on Batman&rsquo;s origin story sees Christian Bale take up the mantle of the Caped Crusader. Batman Begins follows young Bruce Wayne who, reeling from the murder of his wealthy parents, decides to become a vigilante in order to save Gotham City. This pits him against the mysterious League of Shadows, an organization intent on destroying Gotham with the help of the villainous Scarecrow and his powerful fear toxin.  
Release Date   June 10, 2005    Director   Christopher Nolan    Cast   Ken Watanabe , Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Linus Roache , Christian Bale , Katie Holmes , Mark Boone Junior , Michael Caine , Rutger Hauer , Cillian Murphy , Morgan Freeman    Runtime   2h 20m</p>
<p>Christian Bale is renowned for drastic weight changes and impressive physical transformations, but his preparation for Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s The Dark Knight trilogy was particularly impressive. Bale engaged in an extensive physical regimen, combining intense weight training with a disciplined diet to become the imposing superhero. Before Batman Begins, Bale had dropped his weight down to 120 pounds for The Machinist. In just one year, Bale reportedly gained 100lbs of muscle to become Batman in time for the first movie. Bale&rsquo;s impressive commitment contributed to the authenticity of his portrayal, creating a Batman that was a formidable physical force as well as psychologically complex.</p>
<p>9  Joaquin Phoenix Lost A Lot Of Weight To Play The Joker
Joker (2029)</p>
<p>Joker
Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker acts as an origin story for Batman’s most iconic villain. Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is a down-on-his-luck clown who is trying to become a successful stand-up comedian. When things don’t go according to plan, and Arthur feels Gotham is oppressing him and others with mental illness, Arthur sparks a violent revolution within the city. Alongside Phoenix stars Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, and Frances Conroy. 
Release Date   October 4, 2019    Director   Todd Phillips    Cast   Joaquin Phoenix , Robert De Niro , Zazie Beetz , Frances Conroy    Runtime   122 minutes</p>
<p>Joaquin Phoenix&rsquo;s transformation into the Joker for Todd Phillips&rsquo; Joker saw the actor undergo some intense changes. To embody the iconic villain in the origin narrative, Phoenix lost 52lbs. Phoenix also trained with a choreographer, which contributed to his physicality and idiosyncratic mannerisms, which would combine together in 2019&rsquo;s Joker to show a hauntingly realistic take on the otherwise larger-than-life Crown Prince of Crime. Phoenix&rsquo;s physical transformation contributed immensely to the character&rsquo;s success, which earned him widespread acclaim and an Academy Award for Best Actor.</p>
<p>8  Incredible Prosthetics Turned Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje Into Killer Croc
Suicide Squad (2016)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Suicide Squad
The Suicide Squad team is made up of villains, captured and kept in a secret prison, and offered reduced sentences if they participate in dangerous missions. In the tradition of continuity within DCEU films, the event comes in the wake of Superman&rsquo;s death and the seclusion of Batman after the events that occurred in Batman V Superman. Agency head Amanda Waller, played by award-winning actress Viola Davis, is the one striking deals with the inmates of Belle Reve Prison. Heading “Task Force X” is Joel Kinnaman’s Rick Flag, alongside Will Smith’s Deadshot, Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney’s Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez’s El Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye’s Killer Croc, and Adam Beach’s Slipknot. Karen Fukuhara’s Katana also joins the mission to keep Rick safe from the villains. Jared Leto (Joker) and Ben Affleck (Batman) have smaller roles in David Ayer’s Suicide Squad, as does Cara Delevingne’s Enchantress.
Release Date   August 5, 2016    Director   David Ayer    Cast   Joel Kinnaman , Will Smith , Cara Delevingne , Jai Courtney , Jared Leto , Viola Davis , Margot Robbie , Jay Hernandez , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Scott Eastwood    Runtime   123 minutes</p>
<p>Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje&rsquo;s portrayal of Killer Croc in Suicide Squad was startlingly vivid because it was brought to life by stunning prosthetics. The monstrous villain was intricately designed, crafting Killer Croc&rsquo;s scaly, reptilian skin and textured body through practical effects and makeup. The elaborate facial features displayed a remarkable amount of emotion and menace, which helped bring a terrifying realism to the formidable character. The level of artistry elevated the character&rsquo;s presence on screen, which benefited greatly from using physical prosthetics rather than CGI. Akinnuoye-Agbaje&rsquo;s physical performance beneath these allowed Killer Croc to become a memorable and ominous presence in Suicide Squad, despite the movie&rsquo;s mixed reception.</p>
<p>7  Henry Cavill Gained Muscle To Become The Man Of Steel
Man Of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Justice League (2017), Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Justice League (2021), The Flash (2023)</p>

<p>Man of Steel
This new take on Superman&rsquo;s origin story, Man of Steel, centers on young journalist Clark Kent/Kal-El, a being who came to Earth as a child from Krypton. Though he has trouble fitting in with his secret superpowers and questions his purpose in life, Clark is forced into action when fellow Kryptonian General Zod arrives on Earth hellbent on conquest. Clark is built by the values set upon him by his parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent, who adopted him as an otherworldly orphan, inadvertently raising him to become the hero humanity needs.
Release Date   June 14, 2013    Director   Zack Snyder    Cast   Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe    Runtime   143 minutes</p>
<p>Henry Cavil already boasted an impressive physique before playing Superman in the DCEU. Regardless, Cavil gained an additional 18 pounds of muscle to play Superman in Man of Steel. To achieve this feat, Cavil adhered to a strict training program that focused on building a physique befitting the Last Son of Krypton. The actor committed to grueling workouts and diets to achieve a muscularity synonymous with Superman. Cavil&rsquo;s chiseled physique perfectly embodied the famed DC superhero, exuding power and heroism. Cavil&rsquo;s mighty frame reflected the character&rsquo;s superhuman strength and demonstrated the actor&rsquo;s dedication to authenticity in portraying the beloved character on the big screen.</p>
<p>6  CGI Helped Cara Delevinge Conjure Enchantress
Suicide Squad (2016)</p>
<p>CGI was an essential factor in changing Cara Deevinge into the otherworldly Enchantress in Suicide Squad. Delevinge&rsquo;s metamorphosis involved a combination of distinctive, belly dance-inspired movements and computer wizardry. Sony Pictures Imageworks, one of several graphics companies that contributed to Suicide Squads&rsquo;s impressive visuals, has released a video detailing Enchantress&rsquo;s digital creation.</p>
<p>The digital effects were particularly instrumental in conveying the Enchantress and her magical abilities. The graphics created a surprising amount of the villain&rsquo;s appearance, even used to make her clothing. Through CGI, Delevinge&rsquo;s movements were enhanced, and the character&rsquo;s fantastical elements were flawlessly integrated. These ultimately crafted a version of Enchantress with a sinister and ethereal presence.</p>
<p>5  Robert Pattinson Trained Extensively To Become Batman
The Batman (2022)</p>

<p>The Batman
The Batman is a part of the DC Elseworlds series of films and centers around a younger Bruce Wayne, who has taken up the mantle of Batman only two years prior. Batman finds himself stuck in a game concocted by a dangerous new foe known as the Riddler, a serial killer who targets elite members of Gotham&rsquo;s society. Working together with Lieutenant James Gordon, Batman will attempt to uncover the mystery surrounding the Riddler&rsquo;s killing spree.
Release Date   March 4, 2022    Director   Matt Reeves    Cast   Colin Farrell , Jeffrey Wright , Paul Dano , Andy Serkis , Robert Pattinson , Zoe Kravitz    Runtime   176 minutes</p>
<p>Robert Pattinson got into remarkable shape to embody the eponymous hero in The Batman. Pattinson underwent a rigorous and comprehensive workout routine, combining strength training, cardio exercises, and martial arts to embody the iconic superhero&rsquo;s agility and combat prowess (via Menshealth). Rather than bulk up as other Batman actors have in the past, Pattinson instead developed lean muscle and an increased athleticism, aligning with the demands of the Caped Crusader while also carving out his own distinct physicality. His dedicated approach showcased a commitment to capture the essence of the character while also redefining perceptions of the character.</p>
<p>4  Danny DeVito Wore Extensive Prosthetics To Play The Penguin
Batman Returns (1992)</p>
<p>Batman Returns
Batman Returns sees the return of Michael Keaton&rsquo;s Bruce Wayne after his victory over the Joker. This time, the Dark Knight faces a new threat in the form of The Penguin, an outcast who wants revenge on Gotham City. Featuring Danny DeVito as Oswald Cobblepot, Michelle Pfeiffer as Selina Kyle a.k.a. Catwoman, and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck, Batman Returns is Tim Burton&rsquo;s second and final movie based on the iconic DC comics character.
Release Date   June 19, 1992    Director   Tim Burton    Cast   Michael Keaton , Danny DeVito , Michelle Pfeiffer , Christopher Walken , Michael Gough , Michael Murphy    Runtime   126minutes</p>
<p>Tim Burton&rsquo;s Batman Returns featured an iconic design for the Penguin, which quickly became so popular it was deployed in subsequent comic books. The movie focused on bestowing the character with penguin-life features, giving Oswald Cobblepot gaunt sunken eyes, sharpened teeth, and black mouth. Danny DeVito&rsquo;s portrayal of the grotesque villain required extensive makeup, prosthetics, and a bodysuit, which created the macabre rendition of the Penguin. DeVito&rsquo;s snarling, leering characterization and his distinctive idiosyncrasies exploited this sinister visage to conjure a highly compelling and unsettling Batman adversary.</p>
<p>3  Impressive Make-Up Made Tommy Lee Jones Two-Face
Batman Forever (1995)</p>
<p>Batman Forever
After Tim Burton&rsquo;s plans for a third Batman film fell through, director Joel Schumacher took over the franchise with 1995&rsquo;s Batman Forever. Replacing Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer stars as Bruce Wayne opposite to Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones, who play The Riddler and Two-Face, respectively. Batman Forever also marks the first time Robin appears on the big screen since Burt Ward reprised his Boy Wonder role in 1966&rsquo;s Batman: The Movie.
Release Date   June 16, 1995    Director   Joel Schumacher    Cast   Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Tommy Lee Jones , Drew Barrymore , Chris O&rsquo;Donnell , Val Kilmer , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough , Debi Mazar    Runtime   117 Minutes</p>
<p>Tommy Lee Jones&rsquo;s portrayal of Two-Face in Batman Forever was a visually striking triumph of make-up and prosthetics. The character&rsquo;s disfigured appearance required intricate detailing to effectively adapt the iconic DC villain to cinema. The elaborate makeup application involved creating a stark dichotomy between the scarred and unscarred sides of Two-Face&rsquo;s face. Jones&rsquo; entire appearance was subject to scrutiny, however, with meticulous attention paid to the burn effects, discolored skin, and the contrasting aesthetics between the two halves. The result visually depicted the psychological turmoil of Harvey Dent&rsquo;s dual identity within the vivid style of the Schumacher Batman movies.</p>
<p>2  CGI Turned Ray Fisher Into Cyborg
Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016), Justice League (2017), Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Justice League (2021)</p>
<p>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice
In this high-action film by Zack Snyder, the two DC superheroes face off against one another in a conflict spurred on by the villainous Lex Luthor. The film also features WonderWoman playing a role in the fight against Doomsday and other villains from beyond the Earth. As the world&rsquo;s two most powerful superheroes prepare to destroy each other, an unexpected commonality brings them together to defeat their real enemy.
Release Date   March 24, 2016    Director   Zack Snyder    Cast   Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot    Runtime   152 minutes</p>
<p>CGI was used incredibly effectively to transform Ray Fisher into Cyborg in the DCEU. The technologically advanced superhero required motion capture and digital effects to simulate the character&rsquo;s cybernetic components. Much of Cyborg&rsquo;s body is mechanical and metallic, featuring complex and futuristic designs. The slick, intricate technological limbs were complemented by Fisher&rsquo;s broadened physique. Fisher trained thoroughly to play Cyborg in the DCEU, sculpting a heroic frame for the cybernetics to sit upon. Though Cyborg was underused in his scant DCEU appearances, his design was a deft collaboration between character design, special effects, and physical transformation.</p>
<p>1  Heath Ledger&rsquo;s Iconic Joker Make-Up Created A Legend
The Dark Knight (2008)</p>
<p>The Dark Knight
Christian Bale once again embodies the man behind the mask in The Dark Knight, reuniting Bale with Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan. With the help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent, Batman has been making headway against local crime—until a rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker unleashes a fresh reign of chaos across Gotham City. To stop this devious new menace—Batman&rsquo;s most personal and vicious enemy yet—he will have to use every high-tech weapon in his arsenal and confront his beliefs if he hopes to stand a chance against the Clown Prince of Crime.
Release Date   July 18, 2008    Director   Christopher Nolan    Cast   Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger    Runtime   152 Minutes</p>
<p>Heath Ledger&rsquo;s portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s The Dark Knight was iconic, and his makeup played a pivotal role in establishing the character&rsquo;s menacing and chaotic appearance. The Joker&rsquo;s makeup, made famous by Ledger&rsquo;s immersive performance, reflected the psychological depth of the character. The smeared, disheveled white face paint, darkened eyes, and exaggerated red smile accentuated the Joker&rsquo;s anarchic nature, symbolizing his chaotic mindset and adapted the iconic clown effectively for the gritty Batman trilogy.
Ledger&rsquo;s rendition was noted for its raw and erratic characterization, which was succinctly signaled by the haphazard makeup design. Additionally, the prosthetics used to create the character&rsquo;s facial scars inadvertently caused the Joker&rsquo;s bizarre licking tick in The Dark Knight. Ledger&rsquo;s Joker makeup became synonymous with the darker, more realistic tone of Nolan&rsquo;s Batman trilogy, leaving an indelible mark on both cinematic history and the DC Universe&rsquo;s movie legacy.</p>
