## Literature Review

Terminator 2 legend and Reacher star Robert Patrick gives a candid response when asked to compare Alan Ritchson&#39;s physique to Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s.




Terminator 2 legend and Reacher star Robert Patrick gives a candid response when asked to compare Alan Ritchson to Arnold Schwarzenegger. Patrick achieved his breakout role as T-1000, the unforgettable antagonist of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, and has since become a familiar presence in action movies and shows. He continued his foray into the genre by being cast in Prime Video&#39;s Reacher season 2, playing the villainous Shane Langston in the Lee Child adaptation and sharing the screen with Ritchson&#39;s titular character.




In an interview with Cinemablend to discuss Reacher season 2, Patrick was asked who was bigger between Schwarzeggner and Ritchson. Though he answered that Ritchson was bigger and elaborated on the reason, Patrick joked that he didn&#39;t want his Terminator co-star to know about it. Read Patrick&#39;s quote below:


Alan’s bigger. Don’t tell Arnold I said that. . But right now, Alan in his present state and age, he’s bigger. … Alan encompasses a lot of similarities in the size of his massiveness of muscle gain. And he moves very well. And Arnold moves very well. They’re both athletic guys.



 How Ritchson&#39;s Transformation Compares To Schwarzenegger&#39;s 
          

In an interview for Terminator: Genisys (via bodybuilding.com), Schwarzenegger mentioned that he weighed 228 pounds in the original Terminator. This is roughly the same weight he had in the famous sequel Terminator 2. Ritchson has been candid about his physique for Reacher season 2, sharing that he exceeded 240 pounds in an Instagram post that&#39;s since been deleted. He also shed light on his preparation and how he changed a room into a full-sized gym to be able to train.




Ritchson shared that his diet involved a lot of smoothies and proteins. He also admitted to using testosterone therapy and defended its benefits for older men. The actor acknowledged that his Reacher regimen significantly impacted his role choices. He noted that he&#39;s been big enough to portray a superhero, as he&#39;s done recently with his portrayal of Hawk in Titans. He also believed he was fit to play the role of a stepdad. He indicated that this range caused some awkwardness about which roles best suited him. He eventually found his breakout performance on the Prime Video show as an action lead.

  1:40                       How Much Bigger Alan Ritchson Is In Reacher Season 2 (&amp; Compared To The Books)   Alan Ritchson&#39;s Jack Reacher in Reacher has been praised, but it&#39;s worth looking at how he&#39;s bulked up for season 2 and how it compares to the books.   

The Smallville alum has, however, been careful not to glamorize his transformation. Ritchson detailed how the extensive training damaged his body, elaborating on how his previous regime left him ravaged and underlining how he has had to change his methods if he hopes to continue playing the titular character in the long run. The actor is already filming Reacher season 3, showing his dedication to his biggest role yet. Although the size of the book character makes him comparable to movie icons like the Terminator, that sort of look is often costly to maintain in real life.












Reacher season 2 releases new episodes every Friday on Prime Video, with the finale premiering on January 19.
