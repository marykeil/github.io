## Literature Review

Nintendo and Sony Pictures Entertainment have many options to consider regarding which of Link&#39;s weapons and items to include in his upcoming movie.




With Nintendo and Sony teaming up for the live-action The Legend of Zelda movie, there&#39;s an abundance of Link&#39;s iconic weapons and gadgets that should appear in the upcoming adaptation of his journey. Following the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, The Legend of Zelda movie was announced shortly afterward, thus leaving the door wide open for a wealth of possibilities the studios could take the story in. Irrespective of the movie&#39;s style and aesthetic, The Legend of Zelda movie will need to include as many of Link&#39;s iconic weapons and gadgets as possible to resemble anything close to a faithful adaptation.
The Legend of Zelda movie can learn a lot from the Mario movie&#39;s success, such as which characters to include, but it also needs a healthy balance of Link&#39;s weapons and objects, so that he&#39;s reasonably formidable without risking being too strong in his first theatrical outing. Throughout The Legend of Zelda franchise, Link utilizes a series of blades, bows, and bombs to solve puzzles as he braves various locations and opponents to save the world from his legendary rival, Ganon. From Link&#39;s earliest game to his more recent appearances, there are plenty of weapons and items The Legend of Zelda movie needs to include.
            
 
 The Legend Of Zelda Movie Gets Far More Exciting As Update Teases A Perfect Live-Action Adaptation 
Wes Ball&#39;s latest update on The Legend of Zelda film brings optimism for the adaptation&#39;s success, especially with his inspiration for the story. 












 








 10  Paraglider 
The Paraglider helps Link travel through the sky and debuted in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (2017)
        

Debuting in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the Paraglider is one of Link&#39;s more recent items, and it&#39;s used to help Link travel great distances while airborne. The Paraglider is notable for its unique design and versatility as it allows Link to also use his bow and arrow while airborne to hit ranged foes or solve distant puzzles. The Paraglider would be appropriate in The Legend of Zelda movie because it would diversify Link&#39;s journey by showing him overcoming challenges intrinsic to the air, thus reinforcing Link&#39;s determination and commitment to saving Hyrule from Ganon&#39;s reign of terror.





 9  Slingshot 
Debuted in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons (2001) and is a convenient long-range weapon
        

Debuting in The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons and featuring more prominently in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Link&#39;s slingshot is a weaker version of his bow and arrow. However, due to Kid Link&#39;s creativity, the slingshot has allowed Link to fit its pouch with a range of projectiles including rocks, smoke bombs, and Deku Seeds. If The Legend of Zelda movie features Link as a child and an adult, his slingshot could be a great way of showing viewers his aptitude for ranged combat via the slingshot, before showing him master it with his bow and arrow as an adult.





 8  Ice &amp; Fire Rods 
Link first finds the Ice and Fire Rods in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991)
        

One of Link&#39;s greatest strengths is his craftiness on the battlefield, as seen with the unorthodox ways in which he uses many of his weapon and items. Regarding his Ice and Fire Rods, Link initially uses them as simple tools of destruction against his perpetually persistent foes in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. However, as seen in later games, he eventually uses them to freeze water and imbue his arrows with fire, thus maximizing his effectiveness when solving puzzles or fighting tougher foes. The Legend of Zelda movie can display Link utilizing them to a similar effect, thus showing his ability to improvise and outsmart enemies.
            
 
 8 Challenges The Live-Action Legend Of Zelda Movie Faces Bringing The Games To Life 
With the live action The Legends of Zelda film already confirmed, there are a few challenges that must be overcome in order for it to be successful. 








 7  Boomerang 
The boomerang first appeared in The Legend of Zelda (1986) and is one of Link&#39;s oldest weapons


 







Link&#39;s boomerang is one of the first items he collects in The Legend of Zelda after clearing out all the enemies between the first and second quest. Although the boomerang is significantly weaker than most of Link&#39;s later repertoire, it is easily one of his most useful items, as he can use it to stun enemies before dispatching them and to collect ranged items. The Legend of Zelda movie could use the boomerang similarly by showing Link acquiring it early in the story, using the weapon to stun enemies and collect items, and upgrading it similar to how he does throughout The Legend of Zelda video games.





 6  Candles 
First appear in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987) and is a staple in the Legend of Zelda franchise
        

Since The Legend of Zelda consists of Link traversing dungeons to solve puzzles and locate stronger weapons and items, he needs a reliable light source to keep him from falling prey to hidden enemies and vicious traps. Debuting in Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, the candles can also be used as weapons to neutralize smaller and weaker enemies by drawing them close to Link before using a blade or bow and arrow to take them out. Candles in The Legend of Zelda movie are undoubtedly going to appear as their inclusion is necessary to illuminate the dangers of Link&#39;s journey, while also displaying the movie&#39;s attention-to-detail.
            
 
 The Legend Of Zelda Movie Has A Rare Opportunity For Link If It Follows A Meaningful Game Detail 
Link&#39;s lack of dialogue in the Legend of Zelda video games makes pulling off a live-action film complicated, but there&#39;s a way to make it work. 








 5  Ocarina 
The Ocarina is most notable for its use in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998)
        

The Ocarina has appeared throughout The Legend of Zelda series since The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, but its use in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is arguably its most famous appearance. The Ocarina is a flute-like instrument that Link uses to play unique melodies designed specifically for solving musical puzzles as well as traveling through time to distinct locations. While including the Ocarina in The Legend of Zelda movie runs the risk of making him a little too strong too soon, this can be addressed by only making the puzzle-solving part of it relevant before allowing Link to teleport in subsequent movies.





 4  Hookshot 
The Hookshot debuted in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991) and is notable for its unique design
        

Link&#39;s Hookshot is one of his most unique items as it consists of a lengthy chain attached to a handle mechanism, and it grants Link the ability to latch on to sturdy surfaces and grab items from long distances. Since Link will no doubt travel through various types of terrain in The Legend of Zelda movie, the Hookshot&#39;s appearance early in the film would be necessary to highlight the arduous nature of his journey. Whether as a long-range weapon or a tool for solving puzzles and collecting rare items, the Hookshot&#39;s inclusion in The Legend of Zelda adaptation would be a great way for the movie to display Link&#39;s ingenuity.





 3  Bombs 
Bombs debuted in The Legend of Zelda (1986) and appear in every game except Zelda II: The Adventure of Link (1987)
        

Appearing in every game except Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Link&#39;s bombs are nearly as iconic as Link is, and their use for fighting evil creatures and solving puzzles of varying complexity make them a very reliable item. Perhaps one of the most useful aspects of the bombs is the different ways in which Link can use them. As seen throughout various games in The Legend of Zelda franchise and the Super Smash Bros. franchise, Link can use other items like his boomerang and Bow to push bombs further or explode them preemptively, thus catching enemies off guard or retrieving otherwise impossible-to-reach items.





 2  Link&#39;s Bow 
First appeared in The Legend of Zelda (1986) is are powerful, long-range weapons in Link&#39;s inventory


 







Link&#39;s Bow is among his most reliable items, since he uses it in every game in the franchise as well as outside the franchise. Known for its power and sniping abilities, Link&#39;s Bow allows him to utilize arrows against enemies that are adept at airborne combat, or against bosses whose weak spots are nearly impossible to access with a melee weapon. The Legend of Zelda movie will need to include Link&#39;s Bow because of its compatibility with the Ice and Fire Rods. Furthermore, Link using fire and ice arrows while airborne via his Paraglider will show his mastery over his items and ability to convincingly save Hyrule from Ganon.





 1  Master Sword &amp; Hylian Shield 
The Master Sword debuted in The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past (1991) and the Hylian Shield debuted in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time (1998)


 







The Master Sword and Hylian Shield are Link&#39;s most iconic weapons in The Legend of Zelda, and are known for their power and appearance. The Master Sword is a powerful weapon and a tool to seal away evil, as seen in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, and the Hylian Shield is known for its ability to protect its user against any incoming force. Even if The Legend of Zelda movie has its own timeline, it still needs the Master Sword and Hylian shield, as Link acquiring them near The Legend of Zelda movie&#39;s conclusion would be his rite of passage as a great warrior.
