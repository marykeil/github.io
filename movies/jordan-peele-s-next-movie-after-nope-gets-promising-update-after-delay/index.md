## Literature Review

Following the delay of Jordan Peele’s next directorial effort after 2022’s sci-fi horror film, Nope, the filmmaker now provides a promising update.




Jordan Peele shares a promising update on his next movie after Nope following the film&#39;s delay announcement. After rising to prominence as a comedic force with the Key &amp; Peele sketch comedy show, Peele announced himself as a filmmaker with 2017&#39;s Get Out. The writer/ director followed his Oscar-winning horror with Us in 2019 and Nope in 2022, and his fourth directorial outing was originally scheduled for Christmas 2024 until it was recently removed from Universal&#39;s release calendar.




Now, while the untitled Peele movie remains shrouded in mystery, the filmmaker provides an update on the project during a recent appearance on the Conan O&#39;Brien Needs A Friend podcast. The director doesn&#39;t reveal any story or cast information, but he does make one comment that suggests it could be his most exciting movie yet. Check out Peele&#39;s full comment (via Variety) below:



“This has been…obviously, it’s been an interesting year because the writer’s strike had had me in a state of listening, and that’s where I need to be. I do feel like my next project is clear to me, and I’m psyched that I have another film that, you know, could be my favorite movie if I make it right.”



                  1 Hidden Detail In Nope Supports Jordan Peele Shared Universe Theory   Theories about Jordan Peele&#39;s movies creating a shared universe could be true, as one hidden detail in Nope supports the idea with an Us connection.   


 What To Expect From Jordan Peele&#39;s New Movie 
          




Basically no concrete information has been revealed about Peele&#39;s next movie, but his directing career thus far certainly provides some indication of what audiences can expect from the upcoming project. Although Peele may have gotten his start with comedy, all three of his movies so far have been horror films. It seems likely that the upcoming film will continue this genre trend.

Although Peele&#39;s three movies can be classified as horror, each one has also had an element of science fiction. Nope&#39;s alien horror is the biggest wade into sci-fi territory the filmmaker has made yet, and the big swings in that film suggest Peele&#39;s next movie could once again ambitiously blend horror with another genre. In terms of cast, nothing has been revealed about Peele&#39;s new movie, but the filmmaker has a clear affinity for Daniel Kaluuya, who starred in both Get Out and Nope. It&#39;s possible that the upcoming movie will mark another collaboration between the two.



In a 2022 interview with Empire, Peele referred to Daniel Kaluuya as &#34;my De Niro,&#34; a nod to the creative bond between director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro, who have now collaborated on 10 movies.







Get Out, Us, and Nope also all serve as social commentary, with race playing a key role in each of the movies&#39; stories and themes. It seems like Peele will probably continue this trend with his upcoming movie, once again telling a socially-relevant story with a predominantly Black cast. Unfortunately, with no release date set, it&#39;s not clear when more information will be revealed about Peele&#39;s next project.
