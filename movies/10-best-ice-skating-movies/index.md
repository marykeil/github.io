## Literature Review

From kids&#39; movies about the competitive side of the sport to biopics and documentaries, these are some of the best ice skating movies. 




Though they aren&#39;t as common as other sports films, the best ice skating movies capture the majesty and glory of ice-based competition. Ice skating has been around for thousands of years, and yet in most countries, it&#39;s a niche sport that only gains notoriety every four years when the Winter Olympic Games bring the world together. However, for those who practice the sport, ice skating is exciting, dangerous, competitive, and artistic, which is why it has lent itself to the world of cinema so naturally.
While ice skating movies might not seem like the most popular, they do often perform well at the box office which is why Hollywood continues to make one every few years. From kids&#39; movies about the competitive side of the sport to biopics and documentaries, the ice rink has been the home of fantastic cinema for a long time. The best sports movies even appeal to non-sports fans, and ice skating is one such competitive athletic enterprise that has managed to bridge the gap through film.
            
 
 10 Best Feel-Good Sports Movies Of All Time, Ranked 
There are few genres that are as sure to make viewers feel good as the sports movie, though there are some that rank above the rest.












 








 10  The Ice Follies Of 1939 (1939) 
Available to stream on Watch TCM
        

The Ice Follies of 1939 was one of the first narrative movies to ever feature ice skating as its central theme, and it expanded the appeal of the sport. The musical drama centers on an ice skating duo whose career suffers when one of them falls in love with an inept skater. The movie featured actual skaters from the national touring group the Ice Follies and boasted big stars like Joan Crawford and James Stewart in the lead roles. The story took a back seat to the visual spectacle of the real-life ice antics, and the black and white movie concluded with an epic Cinderella-inspired finale in dazzling full color.





 9  Go Figure (2005) 
Available to stream on Disney&#43;
        

Ice skating movies are often popular with young audiences, which is why Disney doubled down on the genre in the 2000s. In 2005, they released one of the most underrated Disney Channel original movies in the form of Go Figure, which concerns an Olympic figure skating hopeful who attends a prestigious training academy. Made with obvious care for the sport, Go Figure had the typical playful energy of &#39;00s Disney Channel movies but also treated ice skating with reverence. The movie even featured a cameo appearance from real-life figure skating legend Kristi Yamaguchi.





 8  Ice Girls (2016) 
Available to stream on Fubo, Hoopla, and Tubi
        

Even if ice skating movies aren&#39;t necessarily all the rage in the U.S., the Canadian film Ice Girls proved that the sport is extremely popular in the Great White North. An aspiring figure skater&#39;s dreams are dashed when her family&#39;s financial troubles force them to move to a small town, but she soon learns to make the best of her situation. Though the plot was boilerplate, the message of good sportsmanship fits well for movies aimed at young audiences. The actual skating in the film is also excellent, and Ice Girls was clearly made for viewers who had already caught the ice skating bug.





 7  Ice Princess (2005) 
Available to stream on Disney&#43;


 







If Go Figure was Disney&#39;s TV ice skating movie, then 2005&#39;s Ice Princess was their swing-for-the-fences attempt to bring the sport to the big screen. The movie follows Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg), a prospective Ivy League science student, who falls in love with figure skating while studying it for a science project. Though the movie was a box office disappointment (via Box Office Mojo) it featured a stellar cast including Trachtenberg, Hayden Panettiere, Joan Cusack, and Kim Cattrall. The ice skating was strong, and the story broke away from the usual underdog formula, but it was released at a time when many live-action Disney movies struggled.

From the Sandlot to Cool Runnings, these sports movies are sure to be a hit with the whole family this spring. 








 6  Blades Of Glory (2007) 
Available to stream through TNT, TBS, and TruTV


 







While most ice skating movies are dramatic and focus on the seriousness of the sport, Blades of Glory took a different approach entirely. The absurd comedy concerns two male figure skaters who must reluctantly team up to return to their former glory. Often considered one of Will Ferrell&#39;s best movies, Blades of Glory lovingly skewered the more ridiculous elements of ice skating movies, and poked fun at the theatrics of figure skating specifically. The movie was basically anchored by the chemistry between Ferrell and Jon Heder, and the over-the-top characters made for laughs of a particularly goofy variety.





 5  The Mighty Ducks (1992) 
Available to stream on Disney&#43;
        

Disney&#39;s The Mighty Ducks might not be a movie about ice skating specifically, but it does feature a lot of it. The Mighty Ducks follows a group of underdog kid hockey players who are reluctantly coached by a young lawyer (Emilio Estevez) as part of his community service. The 1990s was a burgeoning time for the sport of hockey, and The Mighty Ducks brought the popular game to Hollywood. The film spawned several sequels as well as a real-life NHL team, and a sequel in the form of a teen TV show on Disney&#43; almost three decades later.
Both Mighty Ducks sequel movies are available on Disney&#43;, but the sequel television series is no longer available to stream. 






 4  The Cutting Edge (1992) 
Available to stream on Hoopla and Tubi
        

Released in 1992, The Cutting Edge grew into a franchise of ice skating movies with several sequels over the years. After failing to bring home the gold in the 1988 Olympics, a figure skater enlists the help of an ex-hockey player to once again compete on figure skating&#39;s grandest stage. Many ice skating movies center on the clash between figure skaters and hockey players, but The Cutting Edge pioneered the idea with a fair amount of romance. Though the romance sometimes overshadowed the on-ice action, The Cutting Edge still featured plenty of thrilling skating.
All three Cutting Edge sequels are also available to stream on Tubi.

 3  The Ice King (2018) 
Available to stream on Tubi and PlutoTV
        

Like any sport, figure skating is not without its fair share of stories about skaters defying the odds to do what they do best. The Ice King chronicles John Curry&#39;s life as he changed ice skating into the art form the sport has become. In addition, he became the first openly gay Olympian to compete when he came out the night he won gold in 1976. The story of The Ice King was just waiting to be told, and the documentary tackled its subject with all the sweeping grandeur of a feature film. Even though ice skating movies aren&#39;t for everyone, Curry&#39;s story of groundbreaking triumph speaks to all viewers.





 2  I, Tonya (2017) 
Available to stream on Max


 







Every sport has had its share of controversies, but ice skating has essentially come to be defined by the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan incident, the true story 2017&#39;s I, Tonya is based on. The pseudo-mockumentary film tells the tall tale from the perspective of Harding herself, and explores the rich tapestry of events that led to the shocking day. Despite criticism of the movie&#39;s attempt to portray Harding as sympathetic, Margot Robbie earned a Best Actress Oscar nomination, and her co-star Alison Janney took home the Best Supporting Actress statuette. The sport took a back seat to the story, but it is nevertheless an integral part of figure skating history.





 1  Unbroken (2020) 
Available to stream on DistroTV
        

While most ice skating movies portray it as a frilly sport, the 2020 documentary Unbroken showed the gritty side of the athletic endeavor. The documentary centers on two figure-skating pairs, one from Russia and one from the United States, and follows them through the highest and lows of the competition season as they skate for a chance at winning gold. The openness of Unbroken was what made it such an endearing film, and it offered a side of the competition that is rarely seen.
