 10 Best Brian Tyree Henry Roles, According To Letterboxd 
From playing a recluse in The Outside Story to a crime lord in Widows, Brian Tyree Henry&#39;s shown audiences a glimpse of his versatile range.












 








 10  Hotel Artemis (2018) 
As Lev &#34;Honolulu&#34;
        

Set in the near future, Hotel Artemis features Henry as Lev AKA Honolulu, the brother and accomplice of Sherman AKA Waikiki (Sterling K. Brown). After a bank job goes wrong, the pair head to the titular Hotel Artemis, which is a notorious hospital for criminals only. As Lev, Henry spends a good deal of the film undergoing treatment in the hospital, but his actions bring about pivotal moments in the plot. He is a strong foil for Sherman but ultimately, doesn&#39;t have much more to do than motivate his brother&#39;s actions. The film is a fun diversion, but Henry could have been utilized more effectively.





 9  Eternals (2021) 
As Phastos


 







  Eternals  


  Release Date    November 5, 2021     Director    Chloé Zhao     Cast    Angelina Jolie , Lia McHugh , Haaz Sleiman , Salma Hayek Pinault , Dong-seok Ma , Zain Al Rafeea , Harish Patel , Richard Madden , Brian Tyree Henry , Jashaun St. John , Lauren Ridloff , Kit Harington , Kumail Nanjiani , Ozer Ercan     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    157 minutes     Genres    Fantasy , Drama , Action , Superhero     Writers    Chloé Zhao , Patrick Burleigh     Budget    $200 million     Studio(s)    Disney , Marvel     Distributor(s)    Disney     Franchise(s)    Eternals , Marvel Cinematic Universe    


Being cast in a Marvel movie and joining the MCU is a rite of passage for many actors, and being part of Chloé Zhao&#39;s Eternals is a great way to be associated with the franchise. The ensemble cast features many strong performances and powerful heroes, and Henry&#39;s Phastos is a landmark character because he is openly and canonically gay in the film. This was an important first for a Marvel movie, and Henry was a great choice to portray him.
Though his powers are not as flashy as some of the other characters, the role suits Henry&#39;s quiet confidence, and the empathy that he has for the human race is a compelling character trait. Though the film doesn&#39;t have one true lead, Phastos is a character who is sometimes left on the sidelines. If the Eternals return for another film, they would be wise to give Phastos more screen time. 





 8  Crown Heights (2017) 
As Clayton &#34;Massup&#34; Benton
        

Crown Heights is an emotionally harrowing film that follows the true story of Colin Warner (LaKeith Stanfield) who was wrongfully imprisoned. Through all this, his close friend Carl King (Nnamdi Asmugha) worked tirelessly to help him achieve freedom, and their bond is one of the most beautiful parts of the film. Where Henry comes in with a small role as Massup it&#39;s understated and only for a short portion of the film. However, it&#39;s an excellent example of how memorable his work is, even in small doses. Overall, the film has been praised predominantly for its performances but falls a touch short of the dramatic weight it hoped to convey. 





 7  Widows (2018) 
As Jamal Manning
        

  Widows  


  Release Date    November 16, 2018     Director    Steve McQueen     Cast    Daniel Kaluuya , Brian Tyree Henry , Liam Neeson , Cynthia Erivo , Michelle Rodriguez , Colin Farrell , Carrie Coon , Robert Duvall , Viola Davis , Elizabeth Debicki , Andre Holland , Jacki Weaver     Rating    R     Runtime    130minutes     Genres    Thriller , Drama , Crime     Writers    Gillian Flynn , Steve McQueen     Budget    $42million     Studio(s)    20th Century    


Henry and Daniel Kaluuya make a compelling pair in Widows, a film about four women who conspire to steal a large sum from a politician to pay back the debts of their late husbands. In the movie, Henry and Kaluuya play the villains, Henry as Jamal, the mob boss blackmailing the women, and Kaluuya as Jatemme, his brother. Though Jatemme is more violent in the film, Jamal is the mastermind with plans to usurp the politician and insert himself within the local government. Though it&#39;s outside his usual casting, Henry is quite believable as a cruel man with questionable morals and manages to garner empathy for the character regardless. 





 6  Bullet Train (2022) 
As Lemon
        

  Bullet Train  


  Release Date    July 29, 2022     Director    David Leitch     Cast    logan lerman , Karen Fukuhara , Hiroyuki Sanada , Joey King , Brian Tyree Henry , Andrew Koji , Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Masi Oka , Brad Pitt , Zazie Beetz , Michael Shannon , Sandra Bullock     Rating    Not Yet Rated     Runtime    126 minutes     Genres    Thriller , Action     Writers    Zak Olkewicz     Budget    87 million     Studio(s)    Sony    


Bullet Train might not have received the best critical reception, but the film gives the actors plenty of opportunity to enjoy themselves. When watching Henry in the film, it&#39;s easy to see that he&#39;s having a good time, which invites the audience to do the same. Each character has a unique type of assassin and has their own interesting quirks, and Lemon is no exception. Portraying a character with such specific proclivities can be a challenge, but Henry disappears into the idiosyncratic role. Additionally, the setting of the train allows for constant conflict between the characters, fostering the fast-paced nature of the film that Henry keeps up with easily.





 5  Godzilla Vs. Kong (2021) 
As Bernie Hayes


 







  Godzilla Vs Kong  


  Release Date    March 31, 2021     Director    Adam Wingard     Cast    Rebecca Hall , Tasneem Roc , Kyle Chandler , Ziyi Zhang , Lance Reddick , Hakeem Kae-Kazim , Jessica Henwick , Eiza Gonzalez , Alexander Skarsgard , Daniel Nelson , Millie Bobby Brown , Brian Tyree Henry , Danai Gurira , Demián Bichir , Julian Dennison     Rating    PG-13     Genres     Sci-Fi , Action     Writers    Eric Pearson , Max Borenstein     Budget    $155–200 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Franchise(s)    Monsterverse    


In the enjoyable action-adventure movie, Godzilla vs. Kong, realism is less important than spectacle and compelling character work. Henry plays Bernie Hayes, a man determined to bring down the company Apex, which has ties to the development of a new Godzilla. He teams up with Madison (Millie Bobby Brown) and Josh (Julian Dennison) to uncover the truth, making him an interesting blend of surrogate father and a symbol of the innocence of justice.
Bernie makes for an excellent partner to go along for the ride of the film with and showcases his strong comedic timing. Throughout the film, Bernie makes some of the most shocking discoveries of any character and is the perfect choice to introduce these new plot devices. In films like this, it&#39;s important to have a character to root for and identify with, and Henry provides both as Bernie.





 4  Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023) 
As Jefferson Davis
        

  Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  


  Release Date    June 2, 2023     Director    Joaquim Dos Santos , Kemp Powers , Justin K. Thompson     Cast    Shameik Moore , Hailee Steinfeld , Oscar Isaac , Jake Johnson , Issa Rae , Brian Tyree Henry , Luna Lauren Velez , Jorma Taccone , Jason Schwartzman     Rating    PG     Runtime    120 Minutes     Writers    Dave Callaham , Phil Lord , Christopher Miller     Budget    $100 Million     Studio(s)    Sony , Marvel , Columbia Pictures     Franchise(s)    Spider-Verse , Spider-Man    


Of all his voice work, Henry&#39;s role as Jefferson, Miles&#39; (Shameik Moore) father, in the Spider-Verse franchise is his best. In the second installment of the series, Jefferson becomes more combative with his son, as they&#39;re both growing older, and their relationship is evolving. Though this can be difficult to watch, it&#39;s important to Miles&#39; development and fuels many of the major decisions he makes throughout the movie. Henry is easily believed as a father struggling to understand and connect with his son. It&#39;s clear that Henry and Moore have excellent chemistry on and off screen, which makes their familial relationship so realistic. 





 3  Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) 
As Jefferson Davis
        

  Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse  


  Release Date    December 14, 2018     Director    Bob Persichetti , Peter Ramsey     Cast    Jake Johnson , Kimiko Glenn , Hailee Steinfeld , Liev Schreiber , Luna Lauren Velez , Nicolas Cage , Lily Tomlin , Mahershala Ali , John Mulaney , Shameik Moore , Brian Tyree Henry     Rating    PG     Runtime    117 minutes     Writers    Phil Lord , Chris Miller     Budget    $90 million     Studio(s)    Sony     Franchise(s)    Spider-Man    


Though the relationship between Miles and his father becomes more complex in the second film, Into The Spider-Verse gives Jefferson more to do, and serves as a perfect introduction for his character. His monologue to Miles toward the end of the movie is a touching example of an evolved and loving parent-child relationship, and proof that all he wants is the best for Miles. Without Henry&#39;s kindness and commitment to the role, there would be no loving home that is so instrumental in Miles&#39; backstory. Though Henry has done other voice acting, this was the film that cemented him as strong in that arena as well as live-action performances.

 2  Causeway (2022) 
As James Aucoin


 







  Causeway  


  Release Date    November 4, 2022     Director    Lila Neugebauer     Cast    Jennifer Lawrence , Brian Tyree Henry , Linda Emond , Stephen McKinley Henderson , Frederick Weller , Jayne Houdyshell     Rating    R     Runtime    92 minutes     Writers    Luke Goebel , Ottessa Moshfegh , Elizabeth Sanders    


The ending of Causeway needs some explanation, but Henry and Jennifer Lawrence give introspective performances that keep the audience engaged throughout the entire film. Their friendship is a central device in the movie, as Lawrence&#39;s Lynsey and Henry&#39;s James find comfort in each other and their similar traumas. Though it seems that the pair have nothing in common at first, they find common ground in the same way that the audience grows to identify with them despite not sharing their exact experiences. It&#39;s unlikely that anyone other than Henry could have captured the essence of such a complex character, and this was reflected in his Oscar nomination for the role.





 1  If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) 
As Daniel Carty
        

  If Beale Street Could Talk  


  Release Date    December 14, 2018     Director    Barry Jenkins     Cast    Pedro Pascal , Stephan James , Emily Rios , Michael Beach , Teyonah Parris , Colman Domingo , Finn Wittrock , Kiki Layne , Ed Skrein , Dave Franco , Diego Luna , Regina King     Rating    R     Runtime    119minutes     Writers    Barry Jenkins     Budget    $12 million    


Based on James Baldwin&#39;s novel of the same name, If Beale Street Could Talk features Henry as Daniel, a friend of the wrongfully convicted Fonny (Stephan James). A direct comparison can be drawn between Daniel and Fonny&#39;s characters, as Daniel has recently been released from prison when he reconnects with Fonny in the film. Not only this, but Daniel&#39;s experience getting out of prison and regaining his freedom is positive, but his time in prison and the corruption that led to his arrest are despicable. Henry handles the emotional weight of the role with ease and adds to the beautiful and compelling narrative that the film presents.
