# 1 Long-Awaited Will Ferrell Comedy Sequel Would Fix His Missing Career Milestone


## SUMMARY 



  Will Ferrell has never starred in a trilogy of films, despite his success in many standalone movies and sequels.   The closest Ferrell has come to appearing in a trilogy is his role in the Austin Powers movie franchise.   The possibility of a third Anchorman movie or another Lego Movie sequel could break Ferrell&#39;s &#34;trilogy curse&#34; and fulfill his desire to star in a movie trilogy.

## Literature Review

For all of Will Ferrell&#39;s success in the movie industry, he still has yet to achieve one major career benchmark that a possible sequel could rectify.




Despite being one of the most iconic comedy actors of his generation, Will Ferrell is missing a particular accolade that a possible sequel could supply him with. Coming to prominence in the early 2000s, Ferrell became known for his signature brand of silliness in movies such as Elf, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby, and Step Brothers. The success of many of Ferrell&#39;s movies has resulted in sequels being produced, although many have remained as standalone stories.




While Ferrell has led movies, such as 2006&#39;s Stranger Than Fiction, he&#39;s often part of an ensemble cast or paired with a comedy partner. For example, there are several Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly movies where the pair collaborate well. Ferrell&#39;s style is often quite irreverent, and he&#39;s known for his improvisational approach. Throughout his career, some of Will Ferrell&#39;s best movies often called for a second installment, but the longevity of his characters beyond two films has been an ongoing issue.

                  Every Adam McKay &amp; Will Ferrell Movie Ranked From Worst To Best   Filmmaker Adam McKay and comedian Will Ferrell have a great partnership that started with Saturday Night Live. Here&#39;s every movie they&#39;ve done ranked.   


 Will Ferrell Has Never Starred In A Trilogy Of Films 
Several of Ferrell&#39;s movies have received just one sequel
         




Will Ferrell is no stranger to reprising a previous movie role, but it&#39;s something he only tends to do once. Although movies like Blades of Glory and The Other Guys didn&#39;t get a second installment, many of his other movies did. Zoolander and Daddy&#39;s Home are among the Will Ferrell movies that did receive a sequel. However, none of Ferrell&#39;s work has consisted of a movie trilogy.

The closest Will Ferrell has come to appearing in a trilogy is due to his role in the Austin Powers movie franchise. Debuting in 1997&#39;s Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery as the character of Mustafa, Ferrell returned to play the part again in 1999&#39;s Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. The third and final movie, 2002&#39;s Austin Powers in Goldmember, was the first installment to not feature Will Ferrell.



 Anchorman 3 Could Break Will Ferrell&#39;s Trilogy Curse (If It Ever Happens) 
The Lego Movie franchise also offers the actor hope
          




Nine years separated the release of the Anchorman movies, with Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues landing in 2013. Eleven years later, there&#39;s still no official confirmation that a third film is happening. On the other hand, the possibility of a second sequel hasn&#39;t been ruled out either. If Anchorman 3 were to ever materialize, then Will Ferrell would end his spell of never appearing in a movie trilogy.

There is a second way Ferrell could finally star in his first three-parter. After appearing in the dual role of President Business and The Man Upstairs in 2014&#39;s The Lego Movie, he returned for 2019&#39;s The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part. While The Lego Movie 3 looked to be happening for a while, news regarding the film has since died down. Still, another Lego Movie sequel could help the actor reach an important trilogy milestone. So, although Will Ferrell has yet to star in a movie trilogy, two speculative films could afford him the eventual possibility.



Both Anchorman movies are streaming now on Paramount&#43;. The Lego Movie and The Lego Movie 2 are available on TNT, among other platforms.
