Summary

  Marvel Studios released a packed lineup of movies and TV shows planned for 2023 and has plenty more set up for beyond this time frame, including sequels, spin-offs, and new characters.   Looking beyond 2023, Marvel has a slate of 12 confirmed movies planned, including Deadpool 3, Captain America: Brave New World, and two Avengers projects.  







Here is every Marvel movie released in 2023. Hollywood has become dominated by superhero movies in recent years, and that only increased after the Marvel Cinematic Universe started to take off. Between Marvel Studios, Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe, and Fox&#39;s previous X-Men franchise, audiences have seen multiple Marvel movies released each year for quite some time. Marvel&#39;s upcoming movies include new characters, sequels, spin-offs and, of course, 2 new Avengers movies.

The MCU&#39;s 2023 films were all sequels, and gave audiences another chance to see a few of the franchise&#39;s biggest characters. Originally, Marvel Studios was meant to release four movies in 2023, but that was before Mahershala Ali&#39;s Blade reboot was pushed back to 2024 due to various production issues (and it has since been delayed to late 2025). Away from the MCU timeline, Sony continued the Spider-Verse with Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse in June 2023, though Aaron Taylor-Johnson&#39;s Kraven The Hunter was pushed back into 2024. And then there&#39;s the Marvel TV shows, several of which were planned for 2023, though only some of these ultimately released in this time frame. Here&#39;s every Marvel release in 2023 and beyond.




                  Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best   Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?   


 Marvel Movies Released In 2023 
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - February 17, 2023
         

The Ant-Man franchise returned in 2023 as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania released on February 17, 2023. The sequel came over four years after audiences saw Ant-Man and the Wasp. Director Peyton Reed returned for the trilogy capper, which once again featured Paul Rudd in the lead role as Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man. Ant-Man 3&#39;s other returning cast members included Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne, a.k.a. the Wasp, Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne. The movie also saw Kathryn Newton play Cassie Lang in another MCU recasting, while Jonathan Majors played the MCU&#39;s new major villain, Kang the Conqueror.




Despite a mixed reception, Ant-Man 3 will play a prominent role in the MCU. The story followed Ant-Man, Wasp, and the rest of the main characters as they found themselves trapped in the Quantum Realm. They met Kang the Conqueror during this time, although Janet van Dyne was familiar with him from her time trapped there before the events of Ant-Man and the Wasp. Ant-Man 3 also features MODOK, with Corey Stoll reprising the role of Darren Cross in a changed origin for the villain. The 2023 MCU movie significantly set up the events of Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, revealing the Council of Kangs in its post-credits scene.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 - May 5, 2023
         

The Guardians of the Galaxy got one more mission together with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Once again written and directed by James Gunn, the sequel comes almost six years exactly since the team last got a solo movie. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 brings back the franchise&#39;s main characters and stars: Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, Zoe SaldaÃ±a as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Bradley Cooper as Rocket, Vin Diesel as Groot, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Pom Klementieff as Nebula. The sequel also features major new MCU additions with the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) and Adam Warlock (Will Poulter).




It is no secret that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is the last movie for this iteration of the team. Marvel Studios&#39; marketing for the movie hinted at an emotional storyline from the start, which, among other things, explores Rocket&#39;s origins. The High Evolutionary stands as a memorable MCU villain, while Adam Warlock finally pays off a tease from Vol. 2. While the film wraps up Gunn&#39;s time with Marvel Studios, it far from closes the door on the MCU&#39;s cosmic side, particularly since the film saw the formation of a new Guardians of the Galaxy team, and teased that the Legendary Star-Lord will return in the MCU&#39;s future.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse - June 2, 2023
         

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse released on June 2, 2023, reintroducing audiences to Miles Morales, voiced by Shameik Moore, who has now been Spider-Man for over a year. Coming from the directing trio of Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin Thompson, with a script penned by Phil Lord, Chris Miller, and Dave Callaham. The Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sequel returns not only Miles Morales but also Hailee Steinfeld as Spider-Woman and Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker. It also brings Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Spider-Woman (Issa Rae), and Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya) into the mix, among many others.




Whereas Miles&#39; universe was the primary setting of the first film, the sequel saw Morales come face-to-face with the Spider Society, led by Spider-Man 2099. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&#39;s villain is the Spot, voiced by Jason Schwartzman, who poses a major threat to the stability of the multiverse. Sony has already announced plans for a sequel, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, which currently has no release date.

The Marvels - November 10, 2023
         

Audiences finally got another chance to witness a Carol Danvers adventure when The Marvels released on November 10, 2023. The movie premiered four years after the debut of Brie Larson&#39;s MCU superhero in Captain Marvel. The sequel is directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and written by Megan McDonnell (WandaVision). Brie Larson&#39;s Captain Marvel is not the only superhero that appears in The Marvels, as Teyonah Parris&#39; Monica Rambeau and Iman Vellani&#39;s Kamala Khan, a.k.a. Ms. Marvel, returned. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) also returned, while Zawe Ashton played the film&#39;s villain, Dar-Benn, and Park Seo-joon appeared as Carol&#39;s ally Prince Yan.




Marvel Studios directly set up The Marvels&#39; events through Ms. Marvel episode 6&#39;s post-credits scene where Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel switched places thanks to Kamala&#39;s mysterious bangle. In The Marvels, Danvers&#39;, Rambeau&#39;s, and Khan&#39;s powers get entangled, causing the trio to swap places whenever their powers are used. Though the movie set the stage for further multiverse adventures in the MCU, it&#39;s unclear if The Marvels will get a direct sequel.
