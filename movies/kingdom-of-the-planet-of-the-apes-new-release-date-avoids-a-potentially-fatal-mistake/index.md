# Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes  New Release Date Avoids A Potentially Fatal Mistake


## SUMMARY 



  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes avoids competition with other major Memorial Day releases, benefiting its box office success.   The movie&#39;s release date change allows it to explore the conflict between ape factions without risking audience overlap with Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga.   Releasing Kingdom and Furiosa on the same day would have hurt both movies by cannibalizing each other&#39;s audience and impacting their performance.

## Literature Review

Planet of the Apes is a very successful franchise, but a changing release date for the new installment could save it from competing with another. 




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes has every chance of being a box office hit, but a change to the movie&#39;s proposed release date means it is now in an even better position, as it will avoid competing with another huge blockbuster. Following the success of the modern Planet of the Apes trilogy, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will pick up from where War for the Planet of the Apes left off. The critical and commercial success of its predecessor should make the sequel a success – despite seven years having passed between the installments. However, the potential unpredictability of the blockbuster landscape post-COVID means that nothing is guaranteed.




Unlike the three previous installments in the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will not feature Andy Serkis as Caesar. Despite winning popular acclaim for his performance, Serkis&#39; character died in the previous film, passing the mantle onto the next generation. Set 300 years after the events of War, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will explore the conflict between various ape factions, as well as the status of a subjugated and devolved human race. Though this setup is intriguing and promises to move the story forward, the studio has wisely decided to shift the movie&#39;s release date – avoiding a potential disaster in the process.

                  Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes: Release Date, Cast, Story Details &amp; Everything We Know   The Planet of the Apes reboot franchise is getting a fourth film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, courtesy of its new owner, Disney.   


 Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes&#39; Earlier Release Means Not Competing With Furiosa 
         




Despite being originally slated for a May 24 release date, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will now debut on May 10. On the one hand, this means that it will not capitalize on the potential benefits of a Memorial Day release. On the other, the movie will now no longer have to compete with other major Memorial Day releases The Garfield Movie and, more notably, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. Despite the compromise, this may be to Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&#39; benefit.

Like Kingdom, Furiosa is a legacy sequel to a beloved sci-fi action franchise following in the footsteps of a successful reboot. Admittedly, the two series&#39; take a very different approach to their post-apocalyptic subjects. While The Planet of the Apes reboot is more grounded and character-based, Mad Max is explosive and bombastic – a trend that looks set to continue with Furiosa. Nevertheless, the two projects also share some traits that would have made direct competition bad for both releases.



 Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes &amp; Furiosa Releasing On The Same Day Would&#39;ve Hurt Both Movies 
          




Considering that both Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and Furiosa are action-heavy sci-fi stories set in an alternate future where civilization has collapsed, it&#39;s inevitable that there will be some audience overlap between the two movies. As a result, releasing both on the same weekend could force some cinema-goers to pick a side. In an age where big-budget blockbusters are finding it increasingly hard to break even (with 2023 flops like The Marvels and The Flash as high-profile examples), anything films can do to maintain a competitive edge can make a difference.

Considering the popular success of other 2023 same-weekend releases, such as Oppenheimer and Barbie, it might seem that Kingdom and Furiosa had little to be concerned about. However, unlike the Barbenheimer phenomenon, the two action movies are just too similar to risk such a release schedule. Their similarities would inevitably mean that they would cannibalize each other&#39;s audience, negatively impacting each other&#39;s performance. By staggering the release, both Kingdom for the Planet of the Apes and Furiosa can have a fair chance to succeed without worrying about external factors.
