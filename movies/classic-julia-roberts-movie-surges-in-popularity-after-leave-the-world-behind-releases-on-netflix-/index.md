## Literature Review

A classic Julia Roberts film scores big on the Netflix global top 10 as her movie Leave the World Behind maintains its Netflix stronghold. 




The classic Julia Roberts film Pretty Woman soars to popularity on the Netflix charts. Released in 1990, Pretty Woman stars Roberts as a prostitute who gets hired as an escort by a businessman, only for the two to end up falling accidentally in love. Directed by Garry Marshall, the film stars Richard Gere, Jason Alexander, and Laura San Giacomo alongside Roberts.




Now, Pretty Woman gains newfound popularity by making it onto the Netflix global top 10 for the week of December 25–December 31. Pretty Woman came in at no. 3 on the Netflix global top 10, garnering 8.4 million views. Topping the charts were Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire (no. 1 with 34 million views), and another film starring Roberts: Leave the World Behind, which came in at no. 2 with 14.6 million views. Leave the World Behind has maintained its Netflix global top 10 status for four weeks now.


 Julia Roberts Is Having a Big Year On Netflix 
          

Though the film is over 30 years old now, Pretty Woman’s Netflix success is relatively unsurprising. Not only has Pretty Woman become a modern classic over time, but its resurgence on Netflix comes during a time when Roberts has recently been featured in another major film, Leave the World Behind. Because her newer film has stayed on the Netflix charts for so many weeks, it makes sense that more and more Netflix subscribers’ algorithms would start recommending other Roberts films.




                  10 Best Julia Roberts Movies, Ranked By IMDb   With popular titles like Pretty Woman,  r, and Erin Brockovich under her belt, Julia Roberts is one of Hollywood&#39;s most celebrated actresses.   

Though Leave the World Behind received just a limited release in theaters, its Netflix numbers show that the film has been incredibly successful. Since its release on the platform on December 8, Leave the World Behind has taken the no. 1 or no. 2 slot every single week on the Netflix global top 10. This streak is particularly impressive given that Netflix had other new releases during that time, including Rebel Moon and Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget. Leave the World Behind is also fairing decently well among critics, as it currently holds a 76% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Between Leave the World Behind and Pretty Woman, Roberts concludes her Netflix year with a bang. Similarly to the case of Leave the World Behind, Pretty Woman’s no. 3 spot is no small feat either, as it has beaten recent releases including Leo and Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget. Hopefully, Roberts can continue to ride this success, as the actress has several projects in production in the upcoming years.
