## Literature Review

No Time To Die followed the James Bond tradition of filming in exotic locations around the world, but where exactly were all the scenes shot?




No Time To Die locations where the movie was filmed continue the established James Bond tradition of filming in exotic and cinematic settings around the world. James Bond movies have always had an element of a travelog as part of their formula. When the earlier Sean Connery films were made, commercial air travel was still in its infancy and seen as an exciting novelty; several of the films would feature shots of Bond&#39;s airplane landing and him walking out of the airport, maximizing the jet-setting motif. The James Bond movies are escapist entertainment that allowed audiences to see parts of the world they might never otherwise have seen.




Filming a James Bond movie on location is a big deal, and often forever associates that location in the mind of the public with 007. Each new film aims to send 007 to a part of the world he hasn&#39;t been to, to expand Bond’s story, a challenge that increases with each installment. Most of the Bond movies have included filming on their soundstages, and the No Time To Die location list was no different. Producer Cubby Broccoli built the famous 007 Stage at Pinewood especially to house the enormous sets necessary for the Bond movies. Notwithstanding this, there is nothing that compares to location filming.

                  Bond 26: Who Could Play Bond &amp; Everything We Know   The Daniel Craig 007 era is ending with the release of No Time to Die, but what comes next? Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s been revealed about Bond 26.   

Watch On No Time To Die


 Langvann, Norway 
Madeleine Swann&#39;s Childhood Home
         




The first of No Time To Die&#39;s shooting locations, this snowy landscape is used for the flashback scene that opens the film. Langvann, Norway stands in for Madeleine Swann&#39;s childhood home, before the Bond villain Safin enters, kills her mother, and pursues her onto a frozen lake. Langvann is the name of the lake. It&#39;s located in the hills above Nittedal, north of Oslo.



 Spiaggia Cent&#39;Ammari, Italy 
Madeleine And Bond&#39;s Beach Retreat
          

Following her near-drowning in the lake in the flashback scene, Madeleine surfaces on a beach in Spiaggia Cent&#39;Ammari in southern Italy. The rocky coastline is very dramatic and Bondian in appearance, making it an excellent addition to No Time To Die&#39;s shooting locations showing the romantic and picturesque getaway she and Bond have escaped to following the ending of Spectre. From here, the couple drives to Matera.




                  No Spinoffs? Bond 26 Needs To Recast These 2 No Time To Die Characters   No Time To Die&#39;s Nomi and Paloma both deserve a return to the James Bond universe and, with no spinoffs planned, Bond 26 needs to make this happen.   



 Gravina, Italy 
Bond&#39;s Bridge Jump
          

Gravina was used for the scene where Bond jumps from the aqueduct to escape his pursuers. The Madonna Della Stella Aqueduct stands in for Matera in the thrilling opening action sequence. It&#39;s a Roman two-level bridge, and the geography and surrounding landscape lend themselves perfectly to a death-defying Bond stunt.



 Matera, Italy 
Bond&#39;s Opening Car Chase
         




The incredible pre-title car chase with Bond&#39;s Aston Martin DB5 was shot on the streets of Matera. The area is famous for its complex series of ancient cave dwellings carved into the river canyon. The second unit shot the majority of the car chase, while the principal actors arrived later to film scenes around the capital.



 Sapri, Italy 
Madeleine And Bond&#39;s Breakup
          

Believing she betrayed him, Bond dumps Madeleine at the train station, closing the longest pre-title sequence in a Bond film. Sapri doubles for the fictional &#34;Civita Lucana&#34; and is the final No Time to Die location found in Italy. Footage of Bond&#39;s Aston Martin was also shot around the town.



 Jamaica 
Bond&#39;s Retirement Home
          




In No Time To Die, 5 years after the events in Matera, Bond has retired to Jamaica. Jamaica is Bond&#39;s spiritual home, as Ian Fleming wrote the Bond novels here in his house, &#34;GoldenEye.&#34; Dr. No and Live and Let Die were also filmed there. The filmmakers constructed Bond’s retirement beach house on San San Beach in Port Antonio. Other scenes filmed here include his reunion with Felix and meeting the new 007, Nomi. Jamaica also doubles for the exterior Cuba scenes, while the Spectre meeting was a Pinewood set.

                  How All 6 James Bond Actors Compare To Ian Fleming&#39;s Iconic Book Character   From Connery to Craig, every version of 007 has taken the character in a new direction. How does each compare to Ian Fleming&#39;s original James Bond?   



 London, England 
M16 Headquarters
          




Bond finds himself back at MI6 in London, arriving at the UK Ministry of Defence in Horseguard Avenue. A classic Bond film shooting location, the building was last seen in a Bond film in For Your Eyes Only back in 1981. Senate House was used for the M16 reception, while The Mall, Whitehall, and Hammersmith Bridge were used as backdrops for scenes featuring Madeleine as well as M and Bond discussing the nanobot DNA-targeting virus that the villain Safin plans to unleash as the movie’s McGuffin.



 Atlantic Road, Norway 
Bond&#39;s Oceanside Car Chase
          

The impressive Atlanterhavsvegen, or the Atlantic Ocean Road, was used as the start of the Norway car chase that closes the second act of No Time To Die. The elegant road snakes through an archipelago that runs for 8.3km. One of the most impressive of No Time To Die&#39;s locations, the filmmakers use the curves of the road well to build suspense prior to the chase commencing.






 Loch Laggan And The Cairngorms, Scotland 
Bond&#39;s Oceanside Car Chase
          

Part of the car chase scene that takes place in Norway during the events of No Time To Die was actually filmed around Loch Laggan in Scotland. In particular, the scene that features a Land Rover flipping and crashing over the top of James Bond&#39;s car. As the chase intensifies with more vehicles and a helicopter, the filming moved to the Cairngorms, Britain&#39;s largest national park. The rest of the Norway footage was shot on the Ardverikie House Estate.



 Trøllanes, Faroe Islands 
Safin&#39;s Lair
         

Trøllanes is a village on the island of Kalsoy in the Faroe Islands, a North Atlantic archipelago located about halfway between Norway and Iceland. The area doubles for Safin&#39;s lair in No Time To Die, which in the film was an abandoned World War II base on a disputed island between Russia and Japan. Safin&#39;s headquarters on the island were added digitally in post-production, while scenes within it were filmed on sets at Pinewood.




                  Daniel Craig Is Right About James Bond&#39;s No Time To Die Ending   Daniel Craig is justifiably proud of No Time To Die&#39;s ending. Here&#39;s why the actor is right about the powerful way his James Bond&#39;s story concluded.   



 Torre Dei Crivi, Italy 
Madeleine&#39;s Drive
          

At the end of No Time To Die, Madeleine drives along a winding road with her daughter Mathilde. She starts to tell a story about a man named &#34;Bond, James Bond.&#34; The section of the road is the same one that Bond and Madeleine drive down at the start of the film, between Sapri and Acquafredda, and ends the film on a visual high point.



 Pinewood Studios 
Any Non-Location Shots
          




Of course, all of the scenes in No Time To Die that weren&#39;t shot on location were done at Bond&#39;s own Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. Due to the tremendous scope of most Bond films, No Time To Die included, the best way to combine breathtaking globetrotting adventures with high production value is to utilize both on-location and studio shooting. Because Pinewood is specifically set up to tackle Bond projects, it&#39;s noteworthy as a significant member of No Time To Die&#39;s shooting locations list.

How To Stay At James Bond&#39;s GoldenEye Estate In Jamaica
          

Eager consumers of No Time To Die and other classic James Bond films may know this already, but it&#39;s actually possible today to stay at the very GoldenEye Estate where Fleming wrote his Bond novels and where an ever-active James Bond has often attempted to retire throughout his many movies. GoldenEye is now a luxury resort in Jamaica, and even the Fleming Villa, the very house in which the novels were penned, is available to book as well.




Daniel Craig Was The Second Most Well-Traveled Bond At 29 Countries
         

With Daniel Craig ending his run as Bond with No Time to Die, he has taken 007 to a variety of stunning locations. However, Craig falls a little short of being the most well-traveled Bond in the franchise&#39;s history. Bond has visited 111 countries in the movies as of No Time to Die with Craig&#39;s Bond being responsible for 29 international visits. However, just misses tying the record held by Roger Moore&#39;s Bond who visited 30 different countries during his adventures. Given that Moore has also starred in the most Bond movies of any actor, he earns that title well.
