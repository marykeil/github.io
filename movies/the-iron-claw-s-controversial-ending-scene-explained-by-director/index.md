Summary

  Director Sean Durkin defends the controversial ending of The Iron Claw, explaining that he wanted to visualize the purest sense of the Von Erich brothers&#39; connection.   Durkin admits that the scene in the afterlife was a hard sell and got commented on the most during the writing process.   The depiction of the Von Erich tragedy in The Iron Claw, including the omission of Chris Von Erich, has garnered criticism, despite the movie&#39;s overall positive reception.  







The Iron Claw director Sean Durkin explains why he decided to end his biopic on the Von Erich family on a controversial note. After Kerry Von Erich (Jeremy Allen White) kills himself, the biopic cuts to him on a boat in the afterlife, arriving at a pier where his other deceased brothers, Mike (Stanley Simons), David (Harris Dickinson), and Jack Jr. — who passed away as a boy and appears as such — await him. The brothers reunite and spend some time together, while Kevin Von Erich (Zac Efron), in the real world, promises to become a better father in the wake of his siblings&#39; passing.

In an interview with Vulture, Durkin was asked if he faced any resistance including this ending scene in the final version of The Iron Claw. Admitting it was a hard sell, Durkin explains that he wanted the afterlife scene in the film to visualize the brothers&#39; connection in their purest form, and the audience would understand their love for each other. Check out what he said on the matter below:





It was a hard sell. It’s the scene that got commented on the most times in the writing process and questioned the most. This scene should not work, right? You’ve got a pretty grounded world, an emotionally honest look at family. But I wanted to visually portray Kerry’s final imagining of where he was going when he [died by suicide], what he felt he was escaping.
I wanted something heightened, a bit more other worldly. I wanted to visualize the purest sense of their connection. It’s a release. The only direction I gave the guys was about the tenderness with which they touch each other. I wanted them touching each other’s faces. Almost sensual. I wanted a mythical sense of crossing the river and leaving the clan. Just to have that sort of love in its purest form.



 The Iron Claw&#39;s Depiction Of The Von Erich Family Has Garnered Backlash 
          




When The Iron Claw was released in theaters, its critical reception was mostly positive, with most praise directed at Zac Efron&#39;s turn as Kevin Von Erich. It was even named one of the ten best movies of 2023 by the National Board of Review. However, the film&#39;s depiction of the Von Erich tragedy has garnered some backlash from critics.

                  The Iron Claw Fact Check: 8 Biggest True Story Changes &amp; Inaccuracies   The Iron Claw tells the true story of the Von Erichs, a legendary wrestling family, but the film changed and left out some details about their lives.   

Most of the criticism was directed towards its omission of one of the Von Erich brothers, Chris Von Erich, who also died by suicide in 1991. While each of the brothers&#39; deaths is treated in the movie with painstaking detail, Chris does not appear in The Iron Claw, with the tragedy stopping at Kerry&#39;s death. Durkin explained that the movie couldn&#39;t have another tragic moment, with the story already depicting David, Kerry, and Mike&#39;s death, and therefore decided to cut Chris&#39; story altogether.






The real Kevin Von Erich also pushed back at The Iron Claw&#39;s depiction of Fritz Von Erich, stating that his father was a good and honorable man.




Its ending also garnered some controversy, with some critics stating that the emotional impact of having the brothers reunite in the afterlife is weakened by the glaring omission of Chris in the movie. Other critics noted that while Chris&#39; inclusion in the film would&#39;ve garnered a more accurate portrayal of the tragedy, it also would&#39;ve stretched the movie&#39;s length and dramatic impact. Beyond that, however, The Iron Claw has been a critical and commercial success for A24, with lots of Oscar buzz going into the upcoming season.
