## Literature Review

Daisy Ridley is known as Rey in the Star Wars sequel trilogy, but her recent filmography showcases her acting skills and range of roles.




Daisy Ridley had many notable roles in her filmography, and she has only added to that list since her most recent appearance as Rey in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Ridley always took on a variety of roles and mediums, even in the midst of her trilogy, and that trend extended beyond 2019. From dramas to comedies to nonfiction, Ridley used her time away from Star Wars to broaden her acting horizons.
Though she hasn&#39;t reprised her role as Rey since The Rise of Skywalker, the character will show up in her filmography again with the upcoming New Jedi Order movie. In the meantime, Ridley has been expanding her portfolio outside the galaxy far, far away. Since 2019, she has been credited for movies, video games, and a podcast series. Not everything has been a critical or box-office success, though, which may explain her return to Star Wars. Here is a list of everything she has done since The Rise of Skywalker.
            
 
 Star Wars: Daisy Ridley&#39;s 5 Best (&amp; 5 Worst) Roles, According To Rotten Tomatoes 
Daisy Ridley became a household name thanks to Star Wars but her career goes deeper than that. She&#39;s experienced some highs and lows on screen.












 








 10  The Dawn of Art 
2020 - Narrator
        

Ridley&#39;s first credit after Star Wars was in a video game titled The Dawn of Art. The game is a virtual reality experience and interactive tour through a historical site. It depicts the oldest instances of human art found in the Chauvet cave from 36,000 years in the past. Ridley voiced the narrator that guided players through the cave and explained what life was like at the time and the stories behind the artwork. Ridley didn&#39;t do much voice work before The Dawn of Art, but the game proved to be the first in a trend for her.





 9  Baba Yaga 
2020 - Magda
        

Baba Yaga was a short animated film made specifically for virtual reality that made the viewer themselves one of the main characters. Ridley played Magda, the viewer&#39;s sister. Magda and the viewer went to a forbidden forest to find a cure for their sick mother, but encountered the witch Baba Yaga. Magda helped the viewer escape after being captured by the witch.





 8  Asteroid Hunters 
2020 - Narrator
        

Ridley&#39;s next voice role was as the narrator of Asteroid Hunters. Made specifically for IMAX, Asteroid Hunters followed the scientists responsible for finding, tracking, and destroying asteroids headed towards Earth. Ridley provided narration while the scientists themselves were also interviewed.





 7  Chaos Walking 
2021 - Viola


 







Chaos Walking was based on the series of books with the same title. Ridley plays the main character, Viola, on a world with only men where everyone can see and hear each others&#39; thoughts, except for Viola&#39;s. It also marks her only return to science fiction since Star Wars. With three books in the series, the movie set up a sequel, but Chaos Walking&#39;s box-office failure may prevent the series from continuing.





 6  Twelve Minutes 
2021 - Wife
        

Another addition to Ridley&#39;s voice work portfolio, Twelve Minutes is a mystery game about a man stuck in a time loop. A detective storms in on the man and his wife during dinner, accuses the wife of murder and kills the man. The man then relives the same night over and over until he can solve all the mysteries hidden within. Ridley&#39;s character becomes a focal point throughout the game, with the secrets she hides driving the plot along.





 5  Zoetrope 
2021 - Tamsin
        

Ridley&#39;s first and only podcast credit on this list comes from Zoetrope. She plays Tamsin, a woman who recently moved to Singapore. As she tried to adjust to her new home, her building&#39;s speaker system came to life and she found her boss&#39;s dead body in her bathroom. This performance stands as her highest rated on IMDb since her Star Wars run.





 4  The Bubble 
2022 - Kate
        

The Bubble follows a group of actors living in a pandemic bubble as they try to complete a dinosaur movie. Ridley only appeared in a cameo as the workout instructor Kate. The Daisy Ridleyameo served as a weird Star Wars crossover as she had a romance scene with Pedro Pascal, who plays Din Djarin in The Mandalorian.





 3  Sometimes I Think About Dying 
2023 - Fran
        

Ridley played Fran, the introspective main character of the dark romantic comedy Sometimes I Think About Dying. The movie follows Fran as she begins a relationship with her new coworker, Robert. As their relationship progresses, Fran&#39;s tendency to imagine her own death gets in the way of her love. Ridley received critical praise for her performance, with some critics calling her &#34;an acting tour de force.&#34;





 2  The Inventor 
2023 - Marguerite
        

The Inventor follows the story of Leonardo Da Vinci as he created some of his most famous works. Ridley voices princess Marguerite de Nevarre, who joins Da Vinci in his journey to join the French court and focus on his works. Director Jim Capobianco chose to tell Da Vinci&#39;s story through the medium of stop motion, which gives this movie a unique style.
























 1  The Marsh King&#39;s Daughter 
2023 - Helena


 







The Marsh King&#39;s Daughter follows Ridley&#39;s character Helena&#39;s return to the wilderness she grew up in. Helena has to hunt down her father and former kidnapper, the Marsh King, before he comes for her family. The Marsh King&#39;s Daughter is a tense thriller, though its slow-burn pace holds it back.



















Ridley&#39;s recent filmography proves she is not afraid to take risks and get outside of her acting comfort zone, both in genre and medium. Even with her more daring role choices, her career has had some missteps and box-office flops since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. While she will be taking up a lightsaber again, the future of her acting career until then should prove to be interesting and diverse.
