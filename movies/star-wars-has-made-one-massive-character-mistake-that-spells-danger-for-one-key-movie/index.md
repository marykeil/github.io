# Star Wars Has Made One Massive Character Mistake - &amp; That Spells Danger For One Key Movie


## SUMMARY 



  The Star Wars franchise has made a mistake by not killing off major characters in recent years, which has resulted in a lack of emotional stakes.   The New Republic era of Star Wars needs higher consequences and emotional weight to be more consequential and impactful.   The upcoming Star Wars/Mandalorian movie may introduce character deaths and emotional loss to make up for the lower stakes in the TV shows. Ahsoka Tano or other characters from the New Republic era could potentially be sacrificed to defeat Thrawn and provide emotional stakes.

## Literature Review

In recent years, the Star Wars franchise has made one particularly vital character mistake that could promise consequences for an upcoming movie.




The Star Wars franchise has made a crucial character mistake in recent years, something which could force more stakes on an upcoming movie. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, three upcoming Star Wars movies were announced. These films would usher in the new age of the franchise on the big screen after a brief hiatus following 2019&#39;s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.




Between 2019 and the release of the next movie, Star Wars has flourished on Disney&#43;. The main way in which the franchise has succeeded is through exploring the timeline of Star Wars&#39; New Republic via series like The Mandalorian and Ahsoka, something said to continue through upcoming Star Wars shows. That said, the dark times of the Empire&#39;s reign have still been explored through shows like Andor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Star Wars: The Bad Batch. Though each of these shows has been incredibly exciting, as a collection they have committed one fatal character flaw that could pile extra emotional weight on one of the franchise&#39;s upcoming theatrical releases.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Star Wars Hasn&#39;t Killed A Major Character In 4 Years 
Significant character deaths have been lacking since 2019&#39;s The Rise of Skywalker.
          




The problem in question with the Star Wars franchise of late is that there have been no major character deaths. Throughout the shows of the New Republic era, the projects set during the dark times, and any other Star Wars story, the significant characters in a galaxy far, far away have escaped their adventures largely unscathed. There were theories during The Mandalorian season 3 that Din Djarin would be killed off, though even this proved untrue.

Of all Star Wars&#39; recent endeavors, it could be argued that Tech was killed in Star Wars: The Bad Batch. While it is highly likely that he perished, even Tech&#39;s fall was ambiguous to an extent. There have been theories that Tech&#39;s death will be a plot point in Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3&#39;s story, with some even claiming he survived or will be cloned by the Empire. This would highlight another issue with revivals of other characters such as Ahsoka and Boba Fett.



 The New Republic Era Needs Higher Stakes 
More consequences are required to make Star Wars&#39; New Republic era feel more vital to the saga.
          




In light of this, it becomes clear that the New Republic era needs higher emotional stakes. The reason for this solely comes from stories with bigger consequences often being higher regarded in terms of Star Wars movie rankings. The Empire Strikes Back is widely considered the best movie in the franchise primarily due to its darker tone and thus higher stakes. The ending of The Empire Strikes Back sees Luke Skywalker lose his arm and have the truth of his heritage revealed all while Han Solo is carted away in carbonite.

Another highly-rated Star Wars movie is Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. More so than any other film in the franchise, Revenge of the Sith has intense emotional weight. From Anakin&#39;s fall to the dark side to PadmÃ©&#39;s death and the tragedy of Order 66, Revenge of the Sith ironically shines in its darkest moments. As such, the New Republic era needs to emulate these serious stakes to become a more consequential part of the Star Wars timeline.



 The Mandalorian Movie May See The Death Of A Key Character 
The lack of stakes in the New Republic era thus far could see more emotional weight be piled on an upcoming movie.
         




The overall consequence-free nature of the New Republic&#39;s many stories thus far could spell danger for Dave Filoni&#39;s Star Wars/Mandalorian movie. It is no secret that the emergence of Grand Admiral Thrawn and the various other story threads of the New Republic shows will coalesce into a giant, event-style movie. As such, the lower stakes of the shows could be slowly built into a movie filled with emotional loss and character deaths.

Ahsoka Tano is a character whose sacrifice would make sense in the upcoming New Republic movie. The character has been around since the prequel era and Filoni&#39;s first work in the Star Wars franchise. As such, Filoni&#39;s journey as a filmmaker is coming to a head with a live-action feature Star Wars film, meaning it would make perfect poetical sense for Ahsoka to be the martyr of that film. If not Ahsoka, other characters of the New Republic era like Bo-Katan Kryze or even the Mandalorian himself, Din Djarin, could be sacrificed to defeat Thrawn, providing an upcoming Star Wars film with emotional stakes that have been lacking of late.
