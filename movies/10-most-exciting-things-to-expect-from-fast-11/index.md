## Literature Review

Fast &amp; Furious 11 will pull all the strings to become bigger than the previous installments, and here is why the film is worth being excited about.




The upcoming Fast &amp; Furious 11, or Fast 11, is the next action-packed installment of the franchise and is destined to become a cultural moment, which is why there are many reasons to be excited about it. The first film in the franchise, The Fast and the Furious premiered in 2001, and for over two decades, the films have become a staple of action films, taking the action in different corners of the world. Although there&#39;s no official plot yet, the sequel will likely pick up from where Fast X ended, and has a promising cast, a story bound to provide answers, and probably more gorgeous cars and impossible survivals.
Fast X marked the beginning of the finale of the Fast Saga, but it&#39;s unclear when the franchise will actually end. Usually, the Fast &amp; Furious sequels acted as standalone films, but givenFast X&#39;s cliffhanger ending, the next one will be the first sequel so intrinsically linked to the previous.Fast &amp; Furious 11, officially titled Fast X, Part 2, set to premiere in April 2025, was meant to conclude Dom and his family&#39;s stories. However, given how successful the Fast &amp; Furious saga is, and Vin Diesel&#39;s comments about the rumored Fast 12, the franchise may continue beyond Fast 11. However, there are many reasons why the upcoming installment is exciting.
            
 
 7 Fast &amp; Furious 11 Story Teases Hidden In Fast X 
Fast X includes numerous teases for what will happen in Fast &amp; Furious 11; several Fast X scenes provide potential setup for the next movie.












 








 10  Fast 11 Will Go All In With Special Effects And Amazing Stunts 
The franchise is famous for its over-the-top action scenes
        

The Fast Saga has built a name for itself for its impossible stunts and gravity-defying car scenes, and Fast 11 won&#39;t disappoint in that area, and it will bring high-quality, impossible-to-believe special effects, stunts, explosions, and crazy car moments. Fast X brought the franchise back to basics with a race involving Dom and Dante, but it also had him jumping off planes and bridges, and, with the dam exploding in the last minutes of the film, Fast 11 will have plenty of intense moments. With director Louis Leterrier returning, who prioritized practical effects and real stunts in Fast X, the audience can expect similar action in Fast 11, too.





 9  A New Exciting Cameo Must Happen In Fast 11 
It&#39;s already a tradition to bring a new famous name
        

The Fast &amp; Furious franchise has been going for over two decades and it had many cameos over the years, including Rita Ora, Cardi B, Iggy Azalea, and more. Aside from its regular cast, Fast X had many big cameos including Paul Waker&#39;s daughter, Meadow, as a flight attendant helping Jakob, Hollywood legend Rita Moreno, who played Mia and Dom&#39;s grandmother, and Pete Davidson, who helped Tej, Ramsey, Han, and Roman at a computer store before reporting them to the authorities. It&#39;s exciting to find out whether Fast 11 will continue the tradition with more big, unexpected names.





 8  Fast 11 Must Explain Gisele&#39;s Return 
She appeared in the final scenes of Fast X


 







Gal Gadot&#39;s character, Gisele, appeared to have died at the end of 2009&#39;s Fast &amp; Furious, where she fell to her death after saving Han, but made her return in Fast X. No death in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise is ever final, and the saga has retconned many deaths so far, including Gisele&#39;s lover&#39;s, Han. Since there was never a body, there could be an explanation for Gisele&#39;s return. Fast 11 will likely also explain how Gisele appeared on top of a submarine, rescuing Cipher and Letty from the Agency&#39;s prison in Antarctica, as well as why she was working with the villain.





 7  Eva Mendes’ Monica And More Characters Could Return In Fast 11 
Eva Mendes&#39; last appearance was in Fast Five’s post-credits scene
        

A post-credit scene from Fast Five showed Eva Mendes&#39; character, Monica Fuentes, and it could set up her return in Fast 11. Monica was a big character in 2 Fast 2 Furious, but, except for her short cameo, she never returned to the franchise. Given Dante Reyes&#39; revenge on everyone from Fast Five, including Dom&#39;s family and The Rock&#39;s Hobbs, that means Mendes&#39; Monica could also return to Fast 11, and she is not the only one with a way in.
Besides Mendes&#39; Monica, other missing characters could return to Fast 11. Deckhard Shaw&#39;s brother, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) created havoc in Fast and Furious 6, and could make a comeback in Fast 11, given that Dante is threatening his mother. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) was missing in Fast X, and the audience could expect him to show up again. Jakob Toretto&#39;s fate seemed final in Fast X, but since no death is final in Fast &amp; Furious, John Cena&#39;s Jakob could also come back.





 6  Explain How Dom&#39;s Family Survived Fast X&#39;s Plane Crash 
There&#39;s no way his family dies
        

Fast X ended with a major cliffhanger that showed Dominic&#39;s crew&#39;s plane exploding, but it is incredibly unlikely they all died in that crash. Although the last film didn&#39;t hint at their comeback given the finale&#39;s sense of urgency, Fast 11 will surely bring them back and have an explanation about how they survived. They either had parachutes or a car they could drive off the plane&#39;s ramp, or another explanation to bring back Tej, Roman, Ramsey, and Han.





 5  Fast 11 Needs To Defeat Cipher Once And For All 
Cipher can&#39;t become a hero


 







Cipher came back in Fast X and struck an unlikely alliance with Letty and Gisele for their survival, but Fast 11 needs to defeat her once and for all. Director Louis Leterrier revealed there are 11 Fast &amp; Furious clues for the sequel in Fast X, and one of them involves Cipher&#39;s conversation with Dom and Letty at the beginning of the film. She will likely betray them again, although they could begin working together towards a common goal, as Dante also crossed Cipher. Because of that, Dom and his team need to defeat Cipher and make her pay for her crimes, as she can&#39;t become a hero after killing Elena.
            
 
 10 Young Dominic Toretto &amp; Brian O’Conner Stories A Fast &amp; Furious Prequel Could Cover 
While the Fast &amp; Furious timeline is already convoluted as it is, it wouldn’t be surprising if the saga went for prequel movies after Fast X, Part 2.








 4  Letty And Dom Finding Out They Are Going To Have A Baby 
Dom and Letty are already parents to young Brian
        

Dom and Letty are the franchise&#39;s most iconic couple, and they seemed ready to have a baby on their own in Fast X. The two already successfully parent young Brian, who is Dominic and Elena Neves&#39; son, and at the beginning of Fast X, Dom and Letty seemed ready to become parents together. Given the director&#39;s comments about the clues in Fast X, the two might realize they&#39;re expecting a baby. That could happen halfway through the movie to give Dom a reason to go on, or maybe as a reveal in the finale, as Fast 11 could end with the traditional barbecue at the Toretto house.





 3  Hobbs And Shaw Teaming Up Again In Fast 11 
And set up the highly-anticipated sequel
        

The Rock&#39;s Hobbs made his return in a post-credit scene in Fast X, which might reunite him with Deckard Shaw in Fast 11. Jason Statham&#39;s Shaw returned halfway through the film, and Dante posed a threat to his mother. Hobbs, who had a big say in Dante&#39;s father&#39;s death, also received a threatening call, and they could team up. Their movie, which served as the first spin-off in the franchise, was successful and granted a sequel that has yet to materialize. Although Hobbs is confirmed to have his own Fast &amp; Furious film, which Fast 11 will probably set up, it could also be the start of the Hobbs &amp; Shaw sequel.
The Rock&#39;s return to Fast &amp; Furious is as exciting as his reunion with Shaw for more reasons. Given his longtime feud with Fast &amp; Furious lead Vin Diesel, his return to the franchise might put an end to their issues. At the same time, it could reunite Hobbs with Dom and the rest of the crew, which could make them more deadly to Dante.





 2  Dom&#39;s Family Has To Defeat Dante In Fast 11 
Dante proved to be the franchise&#39;s Big Bad
        

There&#39;s a change in the cards for Dante, but he has to stay a villain, and Dom and his family need to defeat him in Fast 11. Jason Momoa&#39;s Dante Reyes proved to be a surprising villain, one who is flamboyant, has a lot of sass, and rejects the traditional rules of masculinity and villains, which proves to be a stark contrast between him and Vin Diesel&#39;s Dominic Toretto. Although the director hinted at a change for Momoa&#39;s villain, showing new sides of Dante, he needs to continue to be bad and cause havoc, leading to his ultimate defeat.

 5 Upcoming Fast &amp; Furious Movies: Every Sequel &amp; Spinoff In-Development 
Fast &amp; Furious has built a massive franchise over 20 years and it&#39;s set to keep expanding even after the final film thanks to these spin-offs.








 1  Fast 11 Will Pay Tribute To Brian O&#39;Conner (&amp; Paul Walker) 
This could prove to be very challenging


 







Fast 11 will reportedly honor Brian O&#39;Conner somehow, and also Paul Walker. Vin Diesel confirmed the film will create a proper sendoff to the character, who was retired after Walker&#39;s tragic death. While Diesel&#39;s confirmation hints the audience might get a glimpse of Brian again, it also poses a major challenge for the Fast &amp; Furious franchise and could be disrespectful and ruin his beautiful, iconic sendoff from Furious 7&#39;s ending. However, seeing how Brian returns in Fast 11 is the most exciting thing about the upcoming installment in the iconic Fast saga.
