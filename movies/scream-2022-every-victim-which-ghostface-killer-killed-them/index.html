<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Scream 2022 brought a new generation of Woodsboro highschoolers, and with them two separate Ghostface Killers. Here are all the Scream 5 deaths.</p>
<p>The Scream 2022 kills mirror the original film by having two killers as Ghostface, but since the Scream 5 killers have the mask on when committing the murders, only a few kills definitively show which Ghostface killer killed who. The new generation of the cast includes Jenna Ortega and Melissa Barrera as sisters Tara and Sam, Sam’s boyfriend Richie (Jack Quaid), and Tara’s close-knit friend group: Amber (Mikey Madison), Wes (Dylan Minnette), siblings Chad &amp; Mindy (Mason Gooding, Jasmin Savoy Brown), and Liv (Sonia Ben Ammar).</p>
<p>Along with the new cast, Scream 5 was a “requel,” meaning most of the Scream characters connect to past movies. Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette), and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) all reprise their roles for the requel, though Campbell didn&rsquo;t come back for Scream 6. The shocking reveal at the end of Scream shows that the killers are Tara’s best friend, Amber, and Sam’s boyfriend, Richie. They were both motivated to kill to continue the Stab franchise (the horror franchise within Scream replicating the film).</p>
<pre><code>              Scream Movies, Ranked From Worst To Best   Ranking the Scream franchise isn't quite as difficult as answering Ghostface's movie-related questions, but it comes dangerously close.   
</code></pre>
<p>Tara (Jenna Ortega)
Tara Survives The Opening Scene</p>
<p>Scream 2022 kills broke the mold when they circumvented Drew Barrymore&rsquo;s original opening and decided to let Tara live. The film opens up with Tara answering a phone call from the same mysterious Ghostface voice, which is almost identical to the original opening Scream scene with Drew Barrymore. Granted, Tara didn’t have the same deadly fate as Barrymore’s character, but she is still a victim of Ghostface’s wrath throughout the film, almost getting killed multiple times. That being said, she wasn&rsquo;t killed by a Scream 5 killer.</p>
<p>With a modern twist, Ghostface Facetimes Tara, showing that they are in Amber’s closet, threatening to kill her if she doesn’t “play a game.” The game is a series of questions about the Stab franchise. This immediately sets up Amber as a victim, yet it is later revealed that Amber is indeed one of the two killers who are responsible for many of the Scream 2022 kills. It was likely Richie on the phone with Tara, recording himself in Amber’s closet to fake that she was in danger.</p>
<p>Vince Schneider (Kyle Gallner)
Richie Kills Kyle Outside The Bar</p>
<p>Vince is the first of many Scream 2022 kills. Instead of having Matthew Lillard reprise his role as Stu, he still makes his name known because Vince just so happens to be his nephew. The victim is also an abusive ex-boyfriend of Liv, and he only makes a couple of brief appearances in the film. Being such an unlikeable character from the beginning, he is immediately set up as the obvious killer, but this doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>His death in Scream 5 comes after harassing Liv and her friends in a bar. Since Amber is in the bar along with her group of friends, this leaves Richie as the assailant and the killer responsible for the first death of many Scream 2022 kills. Although a bit of a throwaway character, Vince’s death scene has a fun Easter egg, with Nick Cave’s “Red Right Hand” — the theme song for the first Scream movie — playing in the car.</p>
<p>Judy (Marley Shelton) &amp; Wes Hicks (Dylan Minnette)
Amber Most Likely Killed Both Judy &amp; Wes</p>
<p>The Scream 5 death of Wes and his mother, Judy Hicks, comes as a surprise. His friends Chad and Mindy (who are horror movie experts), claim there was no way his mother would die because she was in the fourth film only, and “no one cares about the sequels.” This is proven wrong as Judy receives a call from the killer, stating that Wes will die if she doesn’t get home soon. As she rushes home, she is stabbed the second she opens the door, only adding to the Scream 2022 kills count. Shortly after, Wes is killed in his entryway to his house after taking a shower.</p>
<p>These kills are among the most violent scenes in Scream 2022, leaving blood all over the house. Who carried out the killing is a bit tricky, as it could have been Amber, Richie, or both. After Sam and Dewey arrive on the scene, Richie is nowhere to be found. As Sam sees the police at the house, she realizes that no one is at the hospital watching Tara, who’s been hospitalized after her attack. The film then pans back to the hospital, where Richie and Tara are again attacked by Ghostface. With Richie at the hospital, it is most likely that Amber killed Judy and Wes.</p>
<p>Dewey (David Arquette)
Amber Kills Dewey In The Hospital</p>
<p>Dewey’s Scream 5 death is the most shocking and saddest by far, as he is the only original character to be killed off in Scream 2022. There was a decade between Scream 2022 and its predecessor, and a lot has happened to Sidney, Dewey, and Gale since Scream 4. Sidney and Gale were both away from Woodsboro, whereas Dewey was a recluse in the town, living alone. Sam and Richie try to convince Dewey to use his expertise to help catch the killer, and he eventually agrees.</p>
<p>After Wes and Judy’s Scream kills, he and Sam go to the hospital to save Tara. After rescuing Sam, Richie, and Tara from Ghostface’s stabbings, Dewey realizes he didn’t shoot the killer in the head. When he goes to finish the deed, it is revealed that Ghostface is wearing a bulletproof vest, and kills Dewey. The killer whispers the creepy line, “It was an honor.” This is the first murder that is 100% disclosed as Amber, as when she tries (but fails) to kill Gale Weathers, she claims that she is so happy to be able to kill them both. Dewey&rsquo;s death still haunts Gale in Scream 6.</p>
<p>Liv (Sonia Ben Ammar)
Amber Shoots Liv In The Head</p>
<p>Even though Stu is not in Scream 2022, his house is, and this is where many of the Scream 2022 kills take place. Almost identically to the original Scream, the friend group goes to Amber’s for a party, which just so happens to be Stu’s house. At this point, it becomes evident that one of the killers is in the friend group, as members continue to get killed and the group is getting smaller.</p>
<p>After going missing for a few hours, Liv comes out of nowhere, stating that she was attacked by Ghostface. Everyone begins to question her, including Amber. Trying to clear her name, she keeps repeating, “I’m not the killer,” which is stopped by Amber, as she simply says, “I know, because I’m the killer,” and shoots Liv in the head.</p>
<p>Amber (Mikey Madison)
Gale Shoots Amber Multiple Times &amp; Tara Finishes Her Off</p>
<p>The Scream 2022 killer is revealed to be Amber, who delivers a ton of Scream 2022 kills, and her motive is quite simple: to keep the Stab franchise alive. When she finds out she is living in Stu’s house, she becomes obsessed with the murders and wants to continue his legacy. She goes on a rant, stating that it&rsquo;s time for Sidney and Gale to “pass the torch” to the new generation.</p>
<p>For a moment, it seems she might kill Gale too. Luckily, another legacy character lives on, and Gale shoots Amber multiple times, which makes Amber fall on a lit stove behind her and burst into flames. In old Scream and slasher movie fashion, Amber wakes up from the dead one last time and is then fatally shot in the head by her best friend and the film&rsquo;s protagonist, Tara.</p>
<p>Richie (Jack Quaid)
Sam Stabs &amp; Shoots Richie At The End</p>
<p>Even though Dewey himself kept stating never to trust the love interest, which was one of the main Scream 2022 clues to the killer, everyone trusted Richie for some reason. Maybe it is his funny one-liners or his (faked) cluelessness about the Stab franchise. To everyone’s surprise, though, after Amber admits she is the killer, Richie says to his girlfriend, Sam, “There are always two killers,” confirming that he&rsquo;s responsible for many of the Scream 2022 kills.</p>
<p>Richie then stabs his girlfriend and goes to Amber, revealing that they are not only the killers but also a couple. Things don’t go as planned for the two, as they both get killed, with Richie getting stabbed and shot by Sam. Scream 2022 follows in the franchise&rsquo;s tradition, providing wall-to-wall bloodshed, and this sizable slate of Scream 2022 kills proves that it does a tremendous job.</p>
<p>Does Scream 2022 Or Scream 6 Have A Higher Kill Count?</p>
<p>While the Scream 2022 kills have a certain brutality that makes their mark, when it comes to the actual kill count it&rsquo;s technically one of the lowest in the franchise, seeing eight deaths in total. Only the original Scream has a lower killed count, with seven deaths. However, Scream 6 severely upped the ante and is the film in the long-running franchise that boasts the highest kill count of all: 13. It was appropriate that Scream 2022 should reboot the franchise with a kill count mirroring the first film, thereby giving more time to introduce the new legacy characters and establish their connections to Ghostface, Woodsboro, and the Stab movies.</p>
<p>However, Scream 6 took the main gang out of Woodsboro and into NYC, providing a more visceral environment for Ghostface to hunt and kill. While the Scream 2022 kills were performed by two Ghostface killers, Scream 6 was the first in the franchise to have three Ghostface killers. Playing off of the Scream 2 reveal that one Ghostface was Billy Loomis&rsquo; mother, Scream 6 sees Richie&rsquo;s father Wayne, brother Ethan, and sister Quinn as the killers. Since there are three killers instead of two, it only makes sense that Scream 6 would have more murders than Scream 2022&rsquo;s kills. Luckily, all the main characters, including Gale, make it out alive.</p>
<p>Key Release Dates             Scream (2022)   Summary:   The 2022 incarnation of Scream is the fifth entry in the franchise, set twenty-five years after the brutal murders caused by Billy Loomis and Stu Macher shocked the quiet town of Woodsboro. Now a new killer has donned the Ghostface mask and has begun targeting a group of teenagers to resurrect secrets from the town&rsquo;s deadly past. Following the prior killers&rsquo; footsteps, a new Ghostface attacks a high school student named Tara Carpenter. When her sister learns of the attack, she returns to check on her and meets with Tara&rsquo;s old friend group. However, Ghostface strikes again when they visit the hospital, forcing them to partner with series regulars Dewey Riley (David Arquette), Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) to discover the truth behind the original Woodsboro murders and stop the new copycats.A 6th Scream film was confirmed to be in development and will be arriving on March 10 2023, picking up after the events of Scream (2022.)
