# Kongs New Mecha Arm Teased By Godzilla x Kong Director


## SUMMARY 



  The trailer for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire features Kong with a mechanical exoskeleton arm in select scenes.   Director Adam Wingard teases that the device was created using remnants of technology created by Apex Cybernetics, the company in Godzilla vs. Kong responsible for Mechagodzilla.   Kong may require the new arm technology after sustaining an injury fighting the Skar King alone in the Hollow Earth, with the villain proving too strong for just one titan.

## Literature Review

Director Adam Wingard teases the origins of Kongâ€™s advanced mechanical arm as shown off in the trailer for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire.




Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire director Adam Wingard teases Kong&#39;s new mechanical arm. Continuing the story after the Godzilla vs. Kong ending, the upcoming sequel sees the return of the two titular titans as they face off against a new enemy known as the Skar King. The new movie makes several notable changes to its two heroes, with Godzilla now sporting a new pink look and Kong wielding an exoskeleton-looking device around his forearm and hand.




Now, as the Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire release date approaches, Wingard teases the origins of Kong&#39;s new arm in a recent interview with Total Film. According to the director, the technology&#39;s roots are actually connected to a company that played a big role in Godzilla vs. Kong. Check out Wingard&#39;s comments (via SlashFilm) below:


&#34;And though Apex isn&#39;t in this story in a literal way, we kind of hint that Monarch absorbed a lot of the Apex technology after the last film. The glove Kong is wearing, it&#39;s somewhat insinuated that&#39;s Apex technology.&#34;


  


 What Kong&#39;s Upgraded Arm Means For The New Empire 
          




It&#39;s currently unclear why Kong sports a mechanical arm in the sequel, but it&#39;s very likely connected in some way to the film&#39;s new villain. Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire&#39;s Skar King has been teased as the most formidable enemy featured in the Monsterverse yet, with neither Godzilla nor Kong able to take down the creature alone.



Wingard recently teased more about the Skar King to Total Film, explaining that the villain is representative of the worst parts of humanity and that he&#39;s &#34;too big for just one titan!&#34;




As teased in the trailer for Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, it seems like Kong will be the first to encounter the Skar King in the Hollow Earth. Not liking the idea of another monster challenging his dominance in this dimension, it&#39;s possible that Kong will attempt to take down the Skar King alone before he knows the true extent of the creature&#39;s power. If he sustains an arm injury and his more or less defeated during this initial bout with the Skar King, this could be what spurs Kong to seek the help of his former enemy, Godzilla, to take the villain down.




In a broader sense, Wingard&#39;s comment suggests a further building out of the lore of Legendary&#39;s Monterverse movies. Instead of having Apex Cybernetics as the one-and-done villain of Godzilla vs Kong, the sequel continues to explore the impact that the company&#39;s technology has had on the world, both good and bad. This, in turn, could end up playing an important role in any Monsterverse movies beyond Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, as Kong and other franchise characters use this technology to different ends.



For those looking for a Monsterverse refresh ahead of the new film&#39;s release, Godzilla vs. Kong is currently streaming on Hulu and Max.
