Summary

  Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver will delve deeper into the backstories of Tarak and Titus, two important characters from the franchise.   Audiences will get to see how Tarak and Titus deal with their demons and learn more about their origins, creating a stronger connection to the story.   The expanded involvement of Tarak and Titus bodes well for the future of other characters in the Rebel Moon franchise, promising further exploration of Veldt&#39;s defenders.  







While the first Rebel Moon movie had the burden of introducing a new universe, it&#39;s exciting to hear that Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver will be taking a deeper dive into two characters, in particular. Two Rebel Moon actors have stated that their in-world personas will be fleshed out in the franchise&#39;s second installment, making Rebel Moon: Part Two&#39;s story even more exciting. The defenses of the Veldt farming community are now fortified, but two of its new defenders will seemingly have more screen time in The Scargiver.

Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver is scheduled to hit Netflix in April 2024, and will pick up where Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire ended. As well as narrative-related loose ends, there are many characters with backstories that are rich with untold lore, though not all were able to be fully fleshed out in the 2023 movie. Thankfully, members of the Rebel Moon cast have dropped hints that at least two important characters will have their origins more thoroughly addressed in the upcoming sequel.




              Related   10 Biggest Rebel Moon Questions Part 2 Needs To Answer   The first part of Zack Snyder&#39;s Rebel Moon saga gets the story started, but there are still many questions that the sequel needs to address.    


 Rebel Moon Part 2 Will Expand The Stories Of Tarak &amp; Titus 
The Zack Snyder sequel will continue to build the world of Rebel Moon&#39;s characters
          

Tarak and Titus&#39; actors, Staz Nair and Djimon Hounsou, revealed that their respective characters will be fleshed out further in Rebel Moon 2. The first entry into Zack Snyder&#39;s new franchise follows ex-Imperium solider Kora as she assembles a team to help defend her home on Veldt. Part of her forces include Titus, the fallen Imperium general. Another member of her crew is the former prince Tarak. Both Tarak and General Titus have their backstories mentioned during A Child of Fire, and the allure of their respective origins are two of the best facets of the movie.




However, the facts regarding how both characters reached the point at which they&#39;re found in A Child of Fire are scarce. So far, Titus&#39; fall from grace is said to be caused only by his choice to surrender while leading the charge for the Imperium. Tarak is found in servitude, paying off a sizable debt to a man who assisted him following an unfortunate meeting between his family and the Imperium. There are large parts of the stories of both men that their actors have implied will be shown in retrospect alongside the main plot of The Scargiver. For instance, Hounsou mentioned that audiences will see &#34;how they deal with their demons.&#34; Nair elaborated:


&#34;You really get to see their backstories, how they got to where they were when you found them, and inevitably connect even more and relate even more to this story.&#34;




 Tarak &amp; Titus&#39; Involvement Is A Good Sign For Rebel Moon Part 2 
The move bodes well for the franchise&#39;s future
   Close     




While it will be rewarding to see the main Rebel Moon plot continue, a story is only as good as its characters. Zack Snyder has introduced some very compelling heroes in Titus and Tarak, and their histories share many parallels. The continued telling of the story of both characters will not only be entertaining, but also create greater investment in what their fate will ultimately be.

              Related   How Many Rebel Moon Movies Will There Be?   The first two Rebel Moon movies are confirmed and will appear on Netflix, but Zack Snyder has plans to expand his new space opera further.    

The increased involvement of the disgraced general and the ex-prince also bodes well for the future of other characters in the Rebel Moon franchise. While they are interesting characters, Titus and Tarak are not the only figures who have a troubled past. If Snyder is planning to give more context regarding what shaped these two characters, then it&#39;s possible that Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver will only be the beginning of learning more about Veldt&#39;s defenders.






Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is streaming now on Netflix, and Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver will also be available on Netflix in April 2024.




  Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver is the second part of Zack Snyder&#39;s sci-fi epic and will continue the story where the prior movie leaves off.
