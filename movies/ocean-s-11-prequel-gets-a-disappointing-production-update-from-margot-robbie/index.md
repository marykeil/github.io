## Literature Review

The Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel movie, which will reunite her with Barbie co-star Ryan Gosling, receives a disappointing production update from Margot Robbie.




The Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel movie receives a disappointing production update from Margot Robbie. In May 2022, Robbie and Ryan Gosling were cast in an Ocean’s 11 prequel movie set in Monte Carlo during 1962, though other details remain sparse. Now, after their lead roles in the billion-dollar Barbie movie, their reunion is only more anticipated. However, it&#39;s unclear when the long-gestating Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel, from Bombshell director Jay Roach and A Family Affair writer Carrie Solomon, will actually enter production.




Now, in a recent profile by Deadline, Robbie provided a disappointing update on the production status of the Ocean’s 11 prequel. The Barbie star says the project is still in early development, and she doesn&#39;t think it will be the next movie she makes. Robbie went on to discuss what&#39;s next on the agenda for her production company, LuckyChap. Read her full comments below:


Well, that’s still in development. Word got out about that; we didn’t release anything because it’s way too soon, to be honest. Whether it winds up being the next thing, I don’t know. I don’t think so. It’s a pretty big project to put together and there are certain logistical things that we have to time it around.
For us a company, we have a film with Olivia Wilde [Naughty], which is moving quite quickly, so that could be the next thing we shoot. I’m not acting in it, just producing. A couple of TV things should go this year too. And for me as an actor, I love acting in things that I’m not a producer on, so I’m looking at a couple of things but there’s nothing concrete yet.





                  Margot Robbie &amp; Ryan Gosling&#39;s New Ocean&#39;s Movie Must Break A 22-Year Curse   Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are starring in an Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel, and the new movie must break a 22-year franchise curse at the box office.   


 What&#39;s Next For Margot Robbie After Barbie? 
          

With over $1.4 billion at the box office, Barbie was the highest-grossing movie of 2023 and a critical darling that is being showered with award nominations. However, Robbie and writer-director Greta Gerwig aren&#39;t too keen on the idea of Barbie 2. The actor, who also produced the film, says they &#34;put everything into&#34; the movie and didn&#39;t intend for there to be more:



I think we put everything into this one. We didn&#39;t build it to be a trilogy or something. It was like Greta put everything into this movie, so I can&#39;t imagine what would be next.







While it was speculated that the Ocean’s 11 prequel movie would be Robbie&#39;s next project after Barbie, immediately reuniting her with Gosling and continuing to showcase their chemistry, it doesn&#39;t sound like that will be the case based on her latest update. Instead, Robbie will be producing, but not starring, in the Olivia Wilde-directed Naughty which, from Cocaine Bear writer Jimmy Warden, is a Christmas comedy that has been described as &#34;Bridesmaids in the North Pole.&#34;

LuckyChap also produced Megan Park&#39;s comedy My Old Ass, set to premiere at Sundance, and is reportedly developing Tank Girl, a movie based on the British comic book of the same name. As for the next project that Robbie will star in, the actor says she is considering a couple of options, but none of them are concrete. No matter what Robbie stars in next, whether it be the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel or another project, it will be awaited with great interest after the success of Barbie.
