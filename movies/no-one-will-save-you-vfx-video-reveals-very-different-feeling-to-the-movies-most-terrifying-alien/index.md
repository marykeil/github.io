## SUMMARY 


 

The pre-visualizations of the alien in No One Will Save You had a comedic look that risked undermining the sense of dread in the scene.


The final, more refined design of the alien contributes to the intense and terrifying atmosphere of the film.


The transformation of the alien reflects the careful attention to evoking emotions and aligning with the main character in No One Will Save You.
