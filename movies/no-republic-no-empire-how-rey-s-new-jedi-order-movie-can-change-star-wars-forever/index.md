## Literature Review

Star Wars: New Jedi Order has a monumental challenge to face: how will the Jedi fill the power vacuum left by a lack of a galactic government?




The Star Wars sequel trilogy left the galaxy far, far away devastated, with no Republic, Empire, or First Order to govern, but Rey and the upcoming Star Wars: New Jedi Order movie are poised to change everything. The sequel trilogy left a huge mark on the galaxy. The New Republic&#39;s capital of Hosnian Prime was destroyed by Starkiller Base, and the Resistance defeated the only power capable of filling its vacuum: the First Order. The fight for freedom left the galaxy without a centralized government.




Rey&#39;s new Jedi Order promises to show a side of the Jedi never before depicted in live-action. With the ancient Jedi texts she recovered from Ahch-To acting as a guide, her new Order could be a return to the roots of the Jedi in more ways than one. It could be the live-action debut of unique lightsaber colors, all 7 lightsaber stances, and more, but it also has another issue to face. The end of Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker left the galaxy in an unprecedented place. For the first time since before the High Republic era, there was no galactic government for the Jedi to answer to. The new Jedi Order has a problem to address with this unprecedented power vacuum.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Star Wars Has Always Been About A Centralized Galaxy 
         




 Star Wars Government  Start Date  End Date   The Galactic Republic  â‰ˆ25,000 BBY  19 BBY   The Galactic Empire  19 BBY  4 ABY   The New Republic  4 ABY  34 ABY   The First Order  29 ABY  35 ABY   



Even as far back as the High Republic era, Star Wars has always followed efforts to unite and govern the entire galaxy. While certain planets have been resistant to centralized government, such as the Separatists and the Outer Rim, every story in the franchise required some unifying thread between every planet. The Jedi Order of the prequel era fought for the entire galaxy by serving the Republic. The Rebel Alliance fought for the entire galaxy by opposing the Empire. The Resistance fought for the entire galaxy by opposing the First Order. While every iteration of Star Wars in the past has required a centralized galaxy, New Jedi Order has a chance to completely change the formula.






 Does There Need To Be A Galactic Government In Star Wars&#39; Future? 
          

While other Star Wars stories have relied on a galactic government, the lack of one to serve or oppose leaves the door wide open for Rey&#39;s new Order. As long as there has been a galactic government, the Jedi have been beholden to it. The Jedi Order in both the High Republic era and the prequel era were heavily criticized for being servants of the Republic and acting as enforcers of the Republic&#39;s interests rather than as peacekeepers. Rey&#39;s Order has a chance to correct those mistakes and return the Jedi to serving the entire galaxy, not just the orders of the government in charge.

Exploring a galaxy without a central government also raises interesting opportunities for New Jedi Order. Showing how the galaxy operates as a system of independent planets could both explore the aftermath of the fall of the First Order and showcase more of the intricacies of life in the galaxy, such as the attitudes to different political systems and the relationships between specific planets. For all the problems inherent to a galactic government, just as many conflicts would arise from a system of independent planets, giving Rey&#39;s Order more than a full plate to deal with.




                  Star Wars: New Jedi Order - Cast, Story, Timeline &amp; Everything We Know   Rey&#39;s Star Wars return is happening in Star Wars: New Jedi Order. Here&#39;s what is known about the story, cast, and release of Daisy Ridley&#39;s film.   



 The Jedi Would Literally Become Peacekeepers 
          

Without a centralized galactic government and after decades of absence, Rey&#39;s new Jedi Order would have to return to the Order&#39;s roots of being independent peacekeepers. However, without a government behind them to grant them authority, much of the galaxy wouldn&#39;t necessarily recognize the Jedi&#39;s power. That lack of authority coupled with a galaxy that had been through so many regime changes and hardships would make any attempt for the new Jedi Order to gain a foothold extremely difficult. However, it could also be the key to fixing the problems the Order previously faced.




Because it wouldn&#39;t have an established authority to call upon, Rey&#39;s Order would have to establish its own authority. By delivering fair and equitable justice throughout the galaxy, the Order would be able to build up its own reputation separately from any governing body. Eventually, word of the Jedi and their good deeds would spread, and many more inhabitants of the galaxy would be willing to recognize the Order&#39;s authority. This would also keep the Order focused solely on peacekeeping, as there would be no other governmental interests to protect.

Star Wars has a chance to fix the problems the Jedi Order has historically been plagued by with Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie. Without a centralized galactic government, Rey&#39;s new Order could be the most successful Order ever seen in live-action and return the Jedi to the peacekeepers they once were. Whatever direction New Jedi Order takes, Rey&#39;s time as the head of the Jedi Order will have the chance to change Star Wars forever.
