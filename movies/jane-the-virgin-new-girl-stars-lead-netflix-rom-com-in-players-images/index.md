## Literature Review

Jane the Virgin&#39;s Gina Rodriguez stars alongside Damon Wayans Jr. and Tom Ellis in the first look images for upcoming Netflix rom-com Players.




New images from the upcoming Netflix romantic comedy Players show a first look at the characters in the rom-com. Players is directed by Trish Sie and focuses its plot on a New York sportswriter who finds herself unexpectedly falling in love with one of her friends, a man who had previously been merely a part of one of her hookup “plays.” Players stars Jane the Virgin’s Gina Rodriguez alongside Tom Ellis (Lucifer) and Damon Wayans Jr. (New Girl).




Now, Netflix releases first-look images for Players.

         

The Players images show Rodriguez in a variety of scenarios, from a lavish-looking party to a sweet-looking evening where one of her friends sits with her on a field at twilight. In addition to the images, Netflix released a fuller synopsis of Players, which can be found below:


Mack has spent years devising successful hookup “plays” with best friend Adam and their crew. While it has led to countless one-night stands over the years, following their playbook comes with a strict set of ground rules — chief among them: You can’t build a relationship from a play. When Mack unexpectedly falls for her latest target, charming war correspondent Nick, she begins to rethink the game entirely. As the lines between work, fun, friendship, and romance begin to blur, Mack must learn what it takes to go from simply scoring to playing for keeps.






 Can Players Mark a Comeback for Gina Rodriguez? 
          

Players has an interesting cast, as all of its main cast members have had their biggest roles in major TV shows. Rodriguez is no exception, as the biggest success in her career is undoubtedly playing Jane Villanueva in the TV series Jane the Virgin. Rodriguez received copious critical acclaim for the role, including a Golden Globe win in 2015 for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Comedy or Musical.

                  10 TV Shows Where Every Season Has 100% Rotten Tomatoes Scores   Not every TV show gets it right every season, but there are at least 10 series that managed to score 100% on Rotten Tomatoes every single time.    

Since Jane the Virgin, however, Rodriguez has been hit or miss in her role choices. She has had some supporting roles in unusual films such as Kajillionaire and Annihilation, and has been a part of some critically iffy films including Miss Bala, Someone Great, and Scoob!. Nothing since Jane the Virgin has come close to the charm Rodriguez captured when playing the eponymous Villanueva.




Perhaps Players can be Rodriguez’s opportunity to reclaim the lovable energy she captured in Jane the Virgin. While Players features a highly different plot than the telenovela-style series, Jane the Virgin also contains elements of romantic comedy, with its multitudinous romances and love triangles. Hopefully, Rodriguez can harness her rom-com skills in Players, leading the film to success.
