 Jeffrey Wright&#39;s 10 Best Movies, According To Letterboxd 
Jeffrey Wright&#39;s recent role as Jim Gordon in The Batman is just the latest in the actor&#39;s stellar career of entertaining and acclaimed movies. 












 








 10  Shaft (2000) 
Wright plays Dominican drug lord Peoples Hernandez in John Singleton&#39;s adaptation of the classic blaxploitation hero
        

Directed and co-written by the late John Singleton, Shaft sees Samuel L. Jackson take on the iconic role of the classic 1970s blaxploitation hero, John Shaft, in a film that centers around Jackson&#39;s Shaft adjusting to and doling out justice in the 21st century. Shaft in Singleton&#39;s version, is the nephew of Richard Roundtree&#39;s Shaft, and he embarks on a personal mission to bring down the son of a corrupt real estate tycoon after unearthing the rampant corruption in the New York Police Department. Shaft&#39;s handling of the respected character while blending modern sensibilities makes Shaft a unique viewing experience.
Additionally, Jackson&#39;s performance as the titular lawman and Christian Bale&#39;s against-type performance as the spoiled Walter Wade, Jr. elevates the 2000s action crime thriller from that of a simple rehash of old material into a fun story populated with many unique characters. Chiefly among Shaft&#39;s interesting characters is Wright&#39;s work as the revered Dominican drug lord, Peoples Hernandez. Wright displays his incredible range as his perfected accent and specific body language not only highlights his attention-to-detail as an actor, but it sees him hold his own against acting giants like Jackson and Bale in a truly memorable early 2000s action movie.





 9  The Manchurian Candidate (2004) 
Jonathan Demme&#39;s reworking of the 1959 novel and 1962 movie sees Wright as Al Melvin
        

The Manchurian Candidate centers around the kidnapping of soldiers during the Gulf War and the effects that Manchurian Global&#39;s brainwashing has on their kidnapped victims. The Manchurian Candidate is based on the 1962 film of the same name, itself an adaptation of the 1959 novel by Richard Condon, and sees Denzel Washington work tirelessly to uncover the source of the movie&#39;s conspiracy. Perhaps The Manchurian Candidate&#39;s biggest asset is its ability to compel audiences to question the ethics of war in relation to the hand that giant corporations play in funding them, and the United States&#39; checkered history with declaring war on foreign nations.
Additionally, The Manchurian Candidate&#39;s tension and suspense coupled with the inspired soundtrack by British composer Rachel Portman make The Manchurian Candidate an effective think-piece without its big moments ever feeling stale, or its familiar subjects ever feeling overwrought. While Wright&#39;s performance as the former soldier Al Melvin improves The Manchurian Candidate&#39;s quality, the performances of leads Washington, Meryl Streep, and Liev Schreiber and the change from the Korean War to the more contemporary Gulf War aid significantly in distinguishing the movie from its predecessors, leaving audiences with uncomfortable thoughts to consider, all while also highlighting Wright&#39;s affinity for movies with challenging subjects.





 8  Ali (2001) 
Wright plays Muhammad Ali biographer and photographer Howard Bingham in Michael Mann&#39;s Ali biopic
        

Considered one of the best boxing biopics of all time, Michael Mann&#39;s Ali centers around the life of former Heavyweight Champion of the World, Muhammad Ali, from 1964 to 1974. Featuring impeccable cinematography by Emmanuel Lubanezki, an engaging story, and realistic depictions of boxing violence, Ali sets itself apart from the usual boxing biopic fare by highlighting Ali&#39;s flaws as a man and juxtaposing them with the mythos of his claim of being the greatest fighter who ever lived. Bolstered by a sincere performance from Wright that sees him as Ali&#39;s real-life biographer and photographer, Howard Bingham, Ali remains one of the best boxing movies ever made.





 7  Cadillac Records (2009) 
Darnell Martin&#39;s Cadillac Records sees Wright as legendary guitarist Muddy Waters
        

Directed by Darnell Martin, Cadillac Records centers around Chicago-based record company executive, Leonard Chess, and the challenges he overcomes in establishing Chess Records during the racial tension that marred the 1940s and 1950s music scene. Featuring solid performances from entertainers known primarily for their music, such as Beyoncé and Yasiin Bey, Cadillac Records&#39;s greatest strength comes from its leads&#39; abilities to convincingly portray the legendary musicians featured throughout the movie. Wright&#39;s attention to detail once again is on full display in Cadillac Records as he masterfully portrays legendary blues guitarist Muddy Waters&#39; laid-back personality, as well as the distinct way in which he spoke.





 6  Basquiat (1996) 
Wright stars as the late Jean-Michel Basquiat in his breakout role
        

Written and directed by Julian Schnabel, Basquiat centers around the life of the late neo-Expressionist artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, and the challenges he faced with fame, drugs, and his identity. Featuring stellar performances from David Bowie, Gary Oldman, Willem Dafoe, and Dennis Hooper, Basquiat is notable for Wright&#39;s uncanny resemblance to the late artist as well as his commitment to perfecting Basquiat&#39;s distinct speech pattern and introverted personality. While Basquiat received mixed reviews from critics, attributing their umbrage to its standard biopic melodrama, Wright&#39;s performance stands as the film&#39;s greatest strength and serves as one of the best movies under his belt.

Featuring similar themes as seen in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Memento and Tony Scott&#39;s Déjà Vu, Source Code is a cleverly crafted movie that challenges its audience to reassess and reconsider everything they&#39;ve seen, thus simulating Colter&#39;s confusion in a uniquely meta fashion. Furthermore, Wright&#39;s performance as Dr. Rutledge enhances the already tense movie as he delivers a performance that helps the audience and Colter better understand Source Code&#39;s mechanics.

The dystopian action movie is the follow-up to The Hunger Games, and it successfully interprets Collins&#39;s themes of a people finding their humanity through the darkest and most challenging of times. A survivor of the 75th Hunger Games, Wright&#39;s Beetee Latier is notable for his intelligence and acumen regarding technology.

Furthermore, Wright&#39;s take on the always-reliable Commissioner Jim Gordon, improves the quality of the film by showing a new take on the eventual legendary partnership. With The Batman: Part II in development, there&#39;s hope Wright will once again showcase his take on Commissioner Gordon.





 2  American Fiction (2023) 
Wright stars as Thelonious &#34;Monk&#34; Ellison in Cord Jefferson&#39;s feature-length film debut


 







  American Fiction  


  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Cord Jefferson     Cast    Jeffrey Wright , Tracee Ellis Ross , John Ortiz , erika alexander , Leslie Uggams , Adam Brody​ , Keith David , Issa Rae , Sterling K. Brown     Runtime    117 Minutes    


Written and directed by Cord Jefferson, American Fiction is Wright&#39;s latest film, and it centers around the moral dilemma that a Black novelist faces when a publisher agrees to publish his work so long as it fits into many offensive and tired stereotypes about Black Americans. Cleverly written and hilarious, American Fiction is also notable for the brilliant performances of its A-list cast in Wright, Tracee Ellis Ross, Issa Rae, and Sterling K. Brown, which helps keep the film equal parts hilarious and equal parts thought-provoking. While Wright is in top form, American Fiction stands as an exemplary example of one of the actor&#39;s best because of its themes.
Throughout the entirety of American Fiction&#39;s marketing, the focus is on the film&#39;s absurdly hilarious plot and the challenges associated with it. Furthermore, the majority of American Fiction&#39;s runtime devotes itself to the shenanigans of Wright&#39;s Thelonious &#34;Monk&#34; Ellison, attempting to make sense of everything happening around him. However, the film is ultimately about the drama surrounding Monk&#39;s family life and how his dedication to his craft and career has contributed to his family falling apart. The film&#39;s marketing deliberately emphasizing the humor over the family drama, and brilliantly conveys its self-reflexive message about audience fascination with Black pain, similar to the White publishers and filmmakers whom Monk interacts with.

Wright stars alongside Daniel Craig in Craig&#39;s best entry in the James Bond franchise

Casino Royale is renowned for its unique reworking of the iconic 007 character, as Craig&#39;s 007 succeeds in reinventing the character as a no-nonsense professional while still retaining his signature charm and charisma. Wright excels in Casino Royale as Felix Leiter, a skilled CIA operative and eventual ally to 007. While Wright and Craig&#39;s performances are among the spy movie&#39;s highlights, Casino Royale stands as Jeffrey Wright&#39;s best movie because of its contributions to the James Bond lore.
