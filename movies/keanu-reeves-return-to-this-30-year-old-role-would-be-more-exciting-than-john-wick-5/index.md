# Keanu Reeves Return To This 30-Year-Old Role Would Be More Exciting Than John Wick 5


## SUMMARY 



  John Wick 4 may not allow Keanu Reeves to return, but a revival of Speed with Sandra Bullock in 2024 would be an exciting comeback opportunity.   The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock in the original Speed movie was a highlight, and their return would add to the excitement of a potential Speed 3.   A return to the Speed franchise would be more thrilling than a forced return of Reeves&#39; character in John Wick 5, with the opportunity to revive a classic 90s action film and an iconic on-screen couple.

## Literature Review

There are many speculations about Keanu Reeveâ€™s comeback as John Wick, but he could make an even greater return to another action franchise.  




Various theories have come out since John Wick 4&#39;s release early in 2023 about Keanu Reeves&#39; character&#39;s fate and the chances of him returning in the fifth installment; however, 2024 could mark an even greater return for the actor. Reeves has reinvented his late career by starring in the action franchise that was launched in 2014. Nonetheless, John Wick 4&#39;s ending seems to indicate that a comeback might not be possible, and even though many theories suggest the opposite, there are other possibilities for Keanu Reeves regarding action franchises.




Keanu Reeves&#39; movies include a vast variety of genres, from romantic comedies to dramas and sci-fi. However, there is something about him and action films. One of his first important roles was starring in the 90s classic Point Break alongside Patrick Swayze. Furthermore, he gained massive world fame by portraying Neo in one of the most famous franchises of all time, The Matrix, and then finally, at a more mature stage in life, starred in another great action franchise such as John Wick. However, 2024 marks the 30th anniversary of a Keanu Reeves classic action film that should return and cast him alongside his female lead: Speed.


 Keanu Reeves Should Reunite With Sandra Bullock For Speed 3 
          

Speed was released in 1994 starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The movie follows the story of a SWAT agent trying to save people traveling on a bus with a bomb that will explode if the vehicle goes below 50 miles per hour. The film was a critical and box-office success as it grossed $350 million on a $30 million budget. The on-screen chemistry displayed by Reeves and Bullock is surely one of the highlights of the film, which also spawned an off-screen romance and another movie collaboration. However, Reeves didn&#39;t like Speed&#39;s sequel script, which caused him to leave the franchise in the second installment.




                  Keanu Reeves Would Return For Speed 3 On One Condition   Keanu Reeves addresses the possibility of returning for Speed 3, revealing he would be willing to return under one important condition.   

Although Speed 3 hasn&#39;t been confirmed, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, as well as Jon de Bont, Speed 1 and 2&#39;s original director, have all claimed that they could return to the franchise given some conditions. Considering the second installment was a complete failure, Speed&#39;s return would surely need its original lead couple, and the most important thing for that to happen is the existence of a great script. The original film&#39;s 30th anniversary seems to be the perfect opportunity to wrap up an excellent screenplay and close the deal for a full comeback in Speed 3 that could make amends for what happened in the past.



Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock also starred in The Lake House in 2006.









 Why A Keanu Reeves&#39; Speed Return Would Be Better Than John Wick 5 
          

John Wick 4&#39;s ending marked an end for Keanu Reeves&#39; character in the franchise. Considering that bringing him back from death could be possible given some of the theories, but probably too forced, it may seem that it is best to leave it like that. Additionally, Reeves&#39; participation in John Wick&#39;s spinoff Ballerina looks like a better way to keep him in the franchise. In other words, the revival of not only a classic 90s action franchise such as Speed, but also of a great on-screen couple like Bullock and Reeves is way more exciting than a forced return of Wick in a fifth installment.

              Speed  Created by John de Bont and Graham Yost, Speed is a movie franchise that follows characters caught in precarious situations as passengers aboard vehicles set to crash and detonate. The first film stars Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, with Reeves playing the role of Officer Jack Traven as he hunts a dangerous bomber, finding himself stuck on a bus that will explode if it falls under a certain speed.    Created by    Jan de bont , Graham Yost     First Film    Speed     Cast    Keanu Reeves , Sandra Bullock , Dennis Hopper , Jeff Daniels , Jason Patric , Willem Dafoe     Character(s)    Jack Traven , Annie Porter , Howard Payne , Harry Temple , Alex Shaw , John Geiger
