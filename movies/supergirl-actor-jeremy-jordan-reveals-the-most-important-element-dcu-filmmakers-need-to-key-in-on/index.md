Summary

  Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow will showcase a darker version of Supergirl, but Jeremy Jordan hopes it emphasizes her humanity, like the Arrowverse TV show.   Supergirl&#39;s ties to Krypton and her alien identity will play a significant role in her character development.   Supergirl&#39;s motivation in the film could be driven by a desire to protect others from experiencing the same tragedies she has endured.  





Supergirl star Jeremy Jordan explains what elements of the superhero the new movie Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow should lock in on. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow was announced as part of James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe Chapter One: Gods &amp; Monsters, and Gunn indicated this would be a darker take on Supergirl than has been seen on screen before. While details have been kept under wraps, recent reports have indicated screen testing for the lead will be happening soon.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Hazbin Hotel, Jordan also touched on his time on CW&#39;s Supergirl. When asked which pillars of the character the new movie needs to lock in on, he explained why her humanity is so important. Jordan also brought up Supergirl&#39;s kindness and empowerment. Check out Jordan&#39;s full quote below:


Jeremy Jordan: Obviously, [Supergirl] has to be kind and super empowering is kind of the biggest thing. I think making her just as human as possible is always the key, because all the best superheroes, I think, are the ones that we can relate to the most in terms of their humanity.



 Why Supergirl&#39;s Humanity Can Be The Key To Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow 
         

When Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow was first announced, Gunn explained that the movie would show the difference between Supergirl and Superman. According to Gunn, &#34;Supergirl was raised on a rock, a chip off Krypton, and watched everyone around her die and be killed in terrible ways for the first 14 years of her life, and then came to Earth when she was a young girl. She’s much more hardcore.” This darker take on Supergirl could make her humanity an even more important part of the character.




                  Supergirl: Woman Of Tomorrow: Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Along with many other DCU projects, James Gunn announced the exciting Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, shedding light on the franchise&#39;s future.   

Part of what is exciting about Supergirl is how she is different from Superman. Because she wasn&#39;t raised on Earth in the same way as Superman, her ties to Krypton are stronger, as is the alien piece of her identity. With a darker Supergirl who has suffered endless tragedy, how she relates to humanity and grows into the hero that she will become could be even more intriguing.



Supergirl&#39;s motivation could be similar to Batman&#39;s; wanting to protect people from suffering the same tragedies that she has.




In the comic, Supergirl begins questioning her purpose and living in the shadow of her cousin. She discovers a new purpose when a teenage alien comes to her for help, looking to hunt down the monsters that decimated her planet and avenge what she lost. This opens the door to exploring Supergirl&#39;s tragedy and can also show her humanity in how she helps this teenager find justice and peace without losing herself to revenge. While Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow will feature a very different Supergirl than has ever been on screen, the heart of this character remains the same.




              Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow  Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow is one of many DC movies being released by Warner Bros. under the supervision of DC co-heads James Gunn and Peter Safran. Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow was officially confirmed in January 2023 alongside other DC titles, including Superman: Legacy, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Swamp Thing.
