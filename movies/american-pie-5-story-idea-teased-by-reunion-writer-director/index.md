## Literature Review

American Reunion co-screenwriter and co-director Jon Hurwitz suggests a potential storyline for the unmade sex comedy sequel American Pie 5.




A possible storyline for American Pie 5 has been teased by a screenwriter of American Reunion. The American Pie movies, which began in 1999, form a teen sex comedy franchise that follows the lives of best friends Jim (Jason Biggs), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), and Oz (Chris Klein), as well as their crude, hard-partying acquaintance Stifler (Seann William Scott) and their various love interests. Although five direct-to-DVD spinoffs were also made, the main branch of the franchise includes just four movies: the original, 2001&#39;s American Pie 2, 2003&#39;s American Wedding, and 2012&#39;s American Reunion.




On Twitter, a fan asked Cobra Kai co-creator and American Reunion co-writer and co-director Jon Hurwitz about a possible American Pie 5. Check out his answer below:


 

In the tweet, Hurwitz teased that &#34;if [Universal] was interested in finding out if Jim’s Dad and Stifler’s Mom’s romance worked out, they know where to find us.&#34; The characters, who had never interacted onscreen before Reunion, kindled a romantic relationship over the course of the movie after the death of Jim&#39;s mother.


 Hurwitz&#39;s American Pie 5 Idea Could Work 
          

A new American Pie movie is in development with screenwriter Sujata Day, though it is not set to feature any major ongoing characters or storylines. However, if a proper American Pie 5 ever gets off the ground, Hurwitz&#39;s idea could be perfect. While the movie would likely need to feature as many returning main characters as possible, foregrounding Stifler&#39;s Mom and Jim&#39;s Dad would bring two of the franchise&#39;s most popular characters center stage for the first time.




Stifler&#39;s Mom has never been a central figure in the American Pie movies, though she has appeared in each of the four main installments, originally as a recurring gag involving her ongoing affair with Finch. Jim&#39;s Dad, on the other hand, plays a vastly important supporting role throughout the franchise, generally offering awkward advice to his son and eventually going on to appear in four of the five American Pie Presents spinoffs.



The American Pie Presents spinoffs are Band Camp (2005), The Naked Mile (2006), Beta House (2007), The Book of Love (2009), and Girls&#39; Rules (2020), the latter of which is the only one to not feature Jim&#39;s Dad.




An American Pie 5 centering those two characters could also capitalize on the ever-increasing fame of stars Jennifer Coolidge and Eugene Levy, who play Stifler&#39;s Mom and Jim&#39;s Dad respectively. Levy scored a recent hit by starring in the popular Canadian sitcom Schitt&#39;s Creek, which he co-created with his son Daniel Levy. Coolidge has also had a huge recent success by starring in the first two seasons of The White Lotus, a role for which she won an Emmy and a Golden Globe.
