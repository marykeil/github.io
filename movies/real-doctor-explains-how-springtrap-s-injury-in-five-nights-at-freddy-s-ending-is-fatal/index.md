## Literature Review

A real ER doctor explains how William Afton&#39;s, aka Springtrap&#39;s, injuries during the ending of the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s movie are fatal.




William Afton&#39;s injuries during the ending of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie are fatal, a real ER doctor explains. Based on the video game series, the horror film follows Mike Schmidt (Josh Hutcherson) as he takes a job at the abandoned Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza and discovers its animatronic mascots are possessed by murdered children. William Afton (Matthew Lillard), who later becomes known as Springtrap, is a serial killer who kidnapped and murdered six children, and during the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s ending, the internal spring lock mechanisms in his yellow rabbit suit are triggered, fatally wounding him.




On his YouTube channel Doctor ER, Dr. Jordan Wagner confirmed that William Afton&#39;s injuries during the ending of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie are, in fact, fatal.


 

After watching the scene, Dr. Wagner explains that the suit&#39;s spring locks probably impaled William&#39;s abdomen. If untreated over a couple of days, as seen in the storage room during the ending, this would lead to sepsis and potentially kill William. Read his full explanation below:


Piece of it is impaled into probably the abdomen. Puncture wound to the abdomen, depends what it potentially hits. Could be soft tissue, could be intestines. You might have poop free flowing within the abdomen, which if untreated over probably a couple days, will lead to sepsis and then could potentially kill you. It&#39;s gonna be a lot of bleeding, a lot of pain. People say, oh, you&#39;ll get into shock. It&#39;s gonna take a long time in this situation to develop shock to where you&#39;re not gonna feel the pain.






 Will Springtrap Return In Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2? 
          

Though William Afton doesn&#39;t actually die on screen during the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s ending, the extent of his puncture wounds and them being left untreated will likely result in his death, as explained by Dr. Wagner. However, William&#39;s death doesn&#39;t prevent Springtrap from returning as the main antagonist of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 and future films. In the video games, William dies before the events of the series, and it&#39;s his spirit that possesses the Spring Bonnie suit, giving rise to the character known as Springtrap. The first film sets up a similar future for the character.

                  Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Springtrap Update Is Incredibly Exciting For FNAF 2   A recent Matthew Lillard update concerning Five Nights at Freddy’s hints that the second movie could have even more of a beloved character.   




Even before the release of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie in October 2023, it was apparent that Blumhouse and Universal Pictures were planning a film franchise based on the beloved video games. After the movie became a considerable commercial success, a sequel (which is still unconfirmed) became even more likely. Even though William will likely die from his injuries, his spirit will still possess the suit, setting the stage for his return as the primary antagonist known as Springtrap.



Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is streaming on Peacock.
