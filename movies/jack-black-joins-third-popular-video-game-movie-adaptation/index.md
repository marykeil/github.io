## Literature Review

Jack Black joins the cast of the Minecraft movie, another upcoming adaptation of a classic video game, which currently stars Jason Momoa.




Jack Black is reported to have joined the cast of the Minecraft movie. The upcoming video game adaptation will be led by Aquaman’s Jason Momoa, who has been rumored to be playing the classic player character Steve. The Minecraft movie will feature a supporting cast including Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Emma Myers.




According to Deadline, Black has now joined the cast of Minecraft. This venture will mark the actor&#39;s third video game adaptation after Super Mario Bros. Movie and the upcoming 2024 movie Borderlands. While the exact nature of Black’s role is yet to be announced, it is speculated that he may be playing the character of Steve. The plot of Minecraft remains under wraps. 


 Minecraft’s Troubled Production History Explained 
          

Though Black’s casting is progress for the Minecraft movie, this comes after years of the project being in limbo. Warner Bros. originally announced the video game adaptation in 2014, which is now an entire decade ago. Since then, the movie has received multiple release dates, including in 2019 and 2022, which have been subsequently pushed. The film is now tentatively set for an April 2025 release date. 




Despite some promising signs of its production, the exact nature of the film’s plot remains unclear. The project has been super tight-lipped about character details for each cast member, including Black&#39;s undisclosed role. Deadline’s suggestion that Black might play Steve adds more confusion, given previous assumptions that Momoa’s starring role would take the form of Steve. 

Nevertheless, the comedian&#39;s addition to the project is a step in the right direction since the script has long been a hurdle for the film to overcome. This casting update also comes after the production previously announced Myers&#39; involvement, suggesting that vital pre-production phases are in full swing. As of now, Minecraft has its eye on a filming start date for this spring, so hopefully it will be able to keep its promised schedule without any more delay.
