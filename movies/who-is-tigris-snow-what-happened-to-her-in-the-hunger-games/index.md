## Literature Review

The Hunger Games prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, features the character of Tigris Snow who appeared in the original trilogy.




The Hungers Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes features the character of Tigris Snow, who appeared in the original Hunger Games series. Serving as a prequel to the first four films, as was the book of the same name, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes centers on the early days of President Coriolanus Snow. Decades before becoming the power-hungry President of Panem, Snow was a mentor during the 10th Hunger Games. It is those Hunger Games that the prequel&#39;s story remains based on in this origin story.




With Snow serving as the protagonist of the prequel book and its film counterpart, his family life will also be explored at length. From the fates of his parents and the Snow family&#39;s overall political presence in the Capitol, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes provides plenty of context to the villainous President seen in The Hunger Games and its sequels. One of the members of Snow&#39;s family who appears in the film is someone who was seen in the original films. It is also someone who the movie gives some content towards her backstory: Tigris Snow.

                  Which Hunger Games Characters Are Alive During The Prequel?   President Coriolanus Snow is not the only character from the original Hunger Games trilogy that appears in A Ballad Of Songbirds And Snakes.   


 Tigris Snow Is President Snow&#39;s Cousin In The Hunger Games Franchise 
         




In the Hunger Games franchise, Tigris Snow is the cousin of Coriolanus Snow. Early in her life, her parents died, forcing her to live with her cousin and his family. Coriolanus and Tigris were very close, acting as each other&#39;s closest friends and confidantes. Eventually, Coriolanus&#39; parents also die, leading Tigris to become the provider for the family due to the Snow family losing their wealth during the First Rebellion of Panem.

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes includes this backstory between Coriolanus and Tigris and details the latter&#39;s care for her family. From working as a cook to deciding to focus on a career in fashion, the prequel fills in the gaps in both Coriolanus and Tigris&#39; lives before The Hunger Games series. With both appearing in the sequel series, the new movie provides a chance to learn more about the intriguing Tigris Snow.



 Who Plays Tigris Snow In The Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes 
          




In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&#39; cast, Hunter Schafer portrays Tigris Snow. Schafer is best known for her role as Jules Vaughn in the HBO drama series Euphoria. The role is Schafer&#39;s first significant Hollywood film part and could potentially lead to Tigris&#39; appearance in future stories. The tagline of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&#39; trailer reads &#34;The legend that changed the Games begins here,&#34; hinting at sequels to the film being made. If this is the case, hiring an actor as talented as Schafer bodes well for both her and Tigris&#39; futures in the Hunger Games franchise.



 What Happens To Tigris After The Events Of The Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes 
          

Regarding Tigris Snow, her arc is one of the more interesting in the Hunger Games series. As mentioned, she and Coriolanus were very close in their early life, with both wanting what was best for each other and their family. In The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which revolves around the 10th annual Hunger Games, Tigris begins to resent the Games and what they stand for after sympathizing with the tributes. This is also the case with Coriolanus Snow, but that all changes with The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes ending.




After The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Tigris and Coriolanus&#39; relationship deteriorated, likely based on a comment she made about him reminding her more of his dad, which for her was not a positive personality change. At one point, as the Games started to develop, Tigris became one of the stylists for the tributes of an unknown district. Over the years, Tigris began undergoing surgical enhancements that made her look more tiger-like. From flattening her nose to having whiskers implemented onto her face, Tigris began looking like a feline creature, combined with her tiger-centric tattoos on her body.

At some point between her hiring as a stylist and the 74th Hunger Games, Snow and the Gamemakers fired Tigris. This is where Tigris&#39; involvement in the Hunger Games series comes into play. After being dismissed from the institution that runs Panem, Tigris joins Plutarch Heavensbee in the latter&#39;s plot to overthrow Snow and the Capitol. In the third Hunger Games book and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, Tigris was shown to own a fur store in the Capitol that housed refugees during the Second Rebellion.




At the end of the Mockingjay book, and Mockingjay - Part 2, Tigris hides Katniss, Peeta, and the remaining survivors of Squad 451 beneath her store. Tigris then begins scouting the Capitol to provide information for Katniss, who was planning Snow&#39;s assassination. After the end of the war, Tigris survives, though it is unclear exactly what her fate is. Given Tigris&#39; minor role in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2, it is easy to confuse her role in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. Regardless, the latter film provides important context about the person Tigris Snow used to be.
