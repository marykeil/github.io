# 10 Criticisms Of Great Movies That Don t Hold Up


## SUMMARY 


 Some criticisms of movies can be driven by faulty logic or misunderstandings, leading to unjustified takes that don&#39;t hold up upon closer examination. 
 Films like Forrest Gump and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial are often criticized for oversimplification and trauma respectively, but these criticisms overlook the intentional choices made by the filmmakers. 
 Lengthy movies such as The Irishman and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King face criticism for their runtime, but these extended durations are necessary to fully explore complex stories and provide satisfying conclusions.

## Literature Review

While there are plenty of criticisms that can be targeted at great movies, sometimes they don&#39;t always hold up when properly examined.




There are lots of great movies out there that still receive their fair share of criticism, however, sometimes these criticisms just don’t hold up. Film audiences and critics can be very quick to judge and sometimes take aim against movies that don’t deserve such harsh treatment, this can be caused by faulty logic or misunderstandings and end up leading to takes about movies that just can’t be fully justified but yet continue to prevail. While filmgoers are of course always entitled to their personal opinions, there are some criticisms of movies that when looked at a little bit closer tend to fall apart.
Common criticisms include viewers taking issue with the way a film is being presented, despite that being the exact intention of the filmmaker and acting as an essential aspect of the movie’s success. For example, there are those who criticize movies for a perceived glorification of violence, when in fact the intention of the movie was to portray the exact opposite idea. Other times, audiences find movies pretentious or too long when these issues are more down to personal preference than truly justifiable criticism.









 








 10  Forrest Gump Is Not An Oversimplification of History 
Forrest Gump (1994)


 







  Forrest Gump  


  Release Date    July 6, 1994     Director    Robert Zemeckis     Cast    Mykelti Williamson , Gary Sinise , Tom Hanks , Robin Wright , Sally Field     Runtime    142 minutes    


While some may criticize Forrest Gump for its oversimplification and misrepresentation of historical events, part of its innate charms lies in its deliberate disregard for accuracy because simply having Forrest present changes the true story. The true stories behind historical events in Forrest Gump vary wildly from Forrest inspiring Elvis Presley’s dance moves to him meeting President John F. Kennedy. By blending Forrest into events such as these, Forrest Gump becomes a microcosm of the United States in the 20th century, and rather than being an oversimplification of history, becomes a tongue-in-cheek celebration of it.





 9  E.T The Extra-Terrestrial Is Not Traumatic 
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)


 







  E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial  


  Release Date    June 11, 1982     Director    Steven Spielberg     Cast    Drew Barrymore , Henry Thomas , Robert MacNaughton     Runtime    1h 55m    


E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is a notorious tearjerker that is commonly considered one of the greatest family movies of all time. However, some publications such as The Things have pointed out that the movie could be considered traumatic due to the emotionally heavy nature of some of its scenes. While it is true that moments such as E.T. nearly dying can be difficult to take, especially for younger viewers, overall these moments contribute to the emotional resonance of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and are an essential addition to its reputation as an iconic and timeless film.





 8  The Irishman Is Not Too Long 
The Irishman (2019)
        

  The Irishman  


  Release Date    November 27, 2019     Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Bobby Cannavale , Jack Huston , Joe Pesci , Jesse Plemons , Sebastian Maniscalco , Al Pacino , Kathrine Narducci , Stephen Graham , Ray Romano , Aleksa Palladino , Anna Paquin , Robert De Niro , Harvey Keitel , Jake Hoffman     Runtime    210 minutes    


Scorsese stands as one of the most important living filmmakers and he has earned the right to make whatever length film he wishes. 

One criticism that was very prevalent after The Irishman was released on Netflix was that at 209 minutes it is just too long. While viewers may find an almost three-and-a-half-hour-long film a daunting prospect, The Irishman’s runtime was necessary to fully explore the complex story that director Martin Scorsese wanted to tell. The Irishman was also a reunion between Scorsese and his long-time collaborator Robert De Niro, which also features performances from Al Pacino and Joe Pesci in a rare cinematic event that may never be repeated. Today, Scorsese stands as one of the most important living filmmakers and he has earned the right to make whatever length film he wishes.





 7  Asteroid City Is Not Too “Wes Anderson-y” 
Asteroid City (2023)


 







  Asteroid City  


  Release Date    June 23, 2023     Director    Wes Anderson     Cast    Tom Hanks , Margot Robbie , Scarlett Johansson , Adrien Brody , Jeffrey Wright , Bryan Cranston , Bill Murray , Jeff Goldblum , Edward Norton , Liev Schreiber , Hope Davis , Jason Schwartzman , Steve Carell , Willem Dafoe , Hong Chau     Runtime    104 Minutes    


Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City ended up splitting viewers some of whom responded very well to the director’s unique voice and carefully constructed style of filmmaking, while others felt he was becoming too self-indulgent and playing too strongly into his distinctive aesthetic. However, there is only one Wes Anderson and as such then he is entitled to explore his style as far as it will take him. Even though he may lose some viewers along the way, Wes Anderson’s admirers can be thankful that he is staying true to his unique voice and delivering the type of projects that only he is capable of.





 6  2001: A Space Odyssey Is Not Pretentious 
2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
        

  2001: A Space Odyssey  


  Release Date    April 2, 1968     Director    Stanley Kubrick     Cast    Keir Dullea , Gary Lockwood , William Sylvester , Daniel Richter , Leonard Rossiter , Margaret Tyzack     Runtime    149 minutes    


Stanely Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey is sometimes criticized as an abstract and needlessly challenging piece of filmmaking that turns viewers off through its overtly pretentious nature. However, these dismissals ignore just how revolutionary 2001: A Space Odyssey was for pioneering use of special effects and expert use of classical music. While ambitious and difficult films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey may not be for everybody, that is no reason to dismiss it entirely, and viewers who are willing to put the work in really attempt to understand the film are rewarded with an insightful story about artificial intelligence, extraterrestrial life, and what it means to be human.





 5  Casablanca Is Not A Mediocre Romance 
Casablanca (1942)
        

  Casablanca  


  Release Date    November 26, 1942     Director    Michael Curtiz     Cast    Humphrey Bogart , Ingrid Bergman , Paul Henreid , Claude Rains , Conrad Veidt , Sydney Greenstreet     Runtime    102 minutes    


Casablanca is commonly cited as one of the best romance movies ever produced, but some criticize it for having a predictable plot and featuring characters who lack depth. This is a take that overlooks the enduring popularity of Casablanca and ignores what has made it such a popular movie for the past 80 years. What makes Casablanca stand apart as the crown jewel of the Hollywood studio system is not the uniqueness of its plotline but its powerful depiction of love and sacrifice, memorable characters who utter unforgettable dialogue that is ingrained in popular culture, and superb direction and iconic visual style.





 4  Jack In The Shining Does Not Stray Too Far From His Character In The Book 
The Shining (1980)


 







  The Shining  


  Release Date    June 13, 1980     Director    Stanley Kubrick     Cast    Danny Lloyd , Shelley Duvall , Jack Nicholson , Scatman Crothers     Runtime    146 minutes    


Some criticize Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining for veering too far away from the characteristics of Jack Torrence as seen in the original book. The author of the original novel, Stephen King really hates The Shining movie felt that the movie version of Jack already appears unhinged at the beginning of the movie, instead of the slow descent into madness he presented in his book. However, Stanley Kubrick’s version works much better on the screen as the ticking time bomb nature of Jack only makes the movie more tense and means that the horror in The Shining is on display from start to finish.





 3  Pulp Fiction Is Not Incoherent 
Pulp Fiction (1994)
        

  Pulp Fiction  


  Release Date    October 14, 1994     Director    Quentin Tarantino     Cast    John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Ving Rhames , Samuel L. Jackson , Uma Thurman , Christopher Walken , Tim Roth , Harvey Keitel , Eric Stoltz , Rosanna Arquette     Runtime    154 minutes    


The non-linear nature of Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction has led to a perception from some that it is an incoherent and quite scattered film. While the storytelling structure of Pulp Fiction might be quite jarring to viewers, the story of the film itself is not the point. Pulp Fiction is a film about characters, and the style in which it is presented allows audiences to briefly inhabit their world and get a sense of who they are. What may come across as meandering dialogue to some, such as Jules and Vincent’s discussion around McDonald’s, to others is exactly what Pulp Fiction such an enjoyable and iconic piece of postmodern filmmaking.





 2  Fight Club Is Not A Glorification Of Violence 
Fight Club (1999)
        

  Fight Club  


  Release Date    October 15, 1999     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Brad Pitt , Meat Loaf , Edward Norton , Jared Leto , Helena Bonham Carter     Runtime    139 minutes    


Fight Club was one of the most controversial and talked about movies of the 1990s and received its fair share of criticism for its perceived glorification of violence. However, to say this completely misses the entire point of Fight Club as the message of the movie is the opposite of that and acts as a response to toxic masculinity and consumerism. While the cool guy persona of Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden may look aspirational to a certain demographic of men, Fight Club is actually a cautionary critique of globalization and the emotional disconnection people feel from others in modern times.





 1  The Lord Of The Rings: Return Of The King Does Not Have Too Many Endings 
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)


 







  The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  


  Release Date    December 19, 2001     Director    Peter Jackson     Cast    Elijah Wood , Ian McKellen , Liv Tyler , Viggo Mortensen , Sean Astin , Cate Blanchett , John Rhys-Davies , Billy Boyd , Dominic Monaghan , Orlando Bloom , Christopher Lee , Hugo Weaving , Sean Bean , Ian Holm , Andy Serkis     Runtime    178 Minutes    


The fact that there is an almost 30-minute epilogue in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King after the Ring is destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom has led to common criticism that the film has too many endings. Later moments, like the reuniting of the fellowship, Aaagorn being crowned King of Gondor, and the departure at the Gray Havens led to a perception that there was too much screen time given after the main action had concluded. This criticism fails to consider that these moments are not just wrapping up one film, but three movies based on a 1261-page story. The extra time is justified.
