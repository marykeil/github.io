## Literature Review

The Beekeeper is a new action movie directed by David Ayer and starring Jason Statham, and this is where to watch it in theaters or at home.




Jason Statham is back with a new action movie, and there are different options for where to watch The Beekeeper. Statham has solidified a place in Hollywood as one of the biggest leading men for action movies thanks to franchises like The Expendables and The Meg. After finding highs and lows with both franchises in 2023, 2024 marks a chance to launch a new potential franchise. Jason Statham stars in David Ayer&#39;s The Beekeeper and plays the lead role of Adam Clay, a former member of a secret organization known as Beekeepers.




Thanks to the box office and streaming success that Jason Statham&#39;s action movies routinely achieve, it is quite clear how audiences like to experience his films in multiple formats. There are certainly examples of viewers wanting to watch his movies on the big screen for ultimate enjoyment. However, sometimes it is also preferred to wait until the titles are available to watch at home on streaming or PVOD. The Beekeeper&#39;s release plans mean that all options are on the table depending on how eager interested parties are to see Statham and Ayer&#39;s new movie.

The first opportunity to see The Beekeeper comes with its theatrical release. Amazon and MGM acquired the action movie and decided to give it an exclusive release in theaters first instead of making it immediately available on streaming. The Beekeeper&#39;s theatrical release includes showings in Dolby Cinema and IMAX theaters, giving select audiences a chance to see the movie on an even bigger screen.

 When Will The Beekeeper Release On Streaming? 
          




It has not yet been confirmed when The Beekeeper&#39;s streaming release date will be. However, it is known that the movie will stream on Prime Video when that time comes. This is because it is an Amazon and MGM production, with Prime Video serving as the studio&#39;s primary streaming service. Based on Amazon&#39;s history with its theatrical released movies, audiences could expect to see The Beekeeper stream on Prime Video in February 2024, as the studio has previously put movies like Air and Saltburn on streaming a little over a month after debuting in theaters.



 When Will The Beekeeper Release On Digital? 
          

There is no official confirmation of when The Beekeeper will release on digital or if the movie will be made available to buy or rent digitally. Amazon does not always make their movies accessible on other PVOD services. For example, Saltburn and Air are only available to watch at home through Prime Video, while Foe can be bought digitally through other platforms. This means Amazon could ultimately elect to only give audiences the option to watch The Beekeeper in theaters or on Prime Video at a later date.
