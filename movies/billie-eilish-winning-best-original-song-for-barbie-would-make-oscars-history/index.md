## Literature Review

Billie Eilish and Finneas O&#39;Connell&#39;s likely win for Best Original Song at the 2024 Oscars for their song from Barbie would make Oscars history.




If Billie Eilish and her brother, Finneas O&#39;Connell, win Best Original Song at the 2024 Oscars for &#34;What Was I Made For?&#34; from Barbie, it would set a major Oscars record. The 22-year-old pop superstar and her 26-year-old producer brother are a powerhouse musical duo who&#39;ve collaborated on nearly all of Billie&#39;s music throughout her career. They&#39;ve churned out some certified hits and raked in nine Grammys combined along with plenty of other nominations over the years. In 2022, Billie and Finneas won their first Oscar for Best Original Song for &#34;No Time To Die&#34; from the James Bond movie of the same name.




In 2023, Billie and Finneas wrote and recorded &#34;What Was I Made For?&#34; for the Barbie soundtrack. The tear-jerking ballad is featured at the end of Barbie during the emotional climax of the film, as Barbie decides whether she wants to become human. A montage comprised of footage of real-life girls and women then plays as Billie sings about finding her purpose. It&#39;s a beautiful and devastating track that could very well earn the sibling duo their second Oscar for Best Original Song. If they did take home the prize this year, it would be a historical win.

 Billie Eilish Would Be The Youngest Person To Win Two Oscars

If Billie and Finneas win the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 2024 Oscars, they would become the youngest two-time Oscar winners across all categories. This would make 22-year-old Billie the youngest person with two Oscar wins in Academy Awards history. Currently, the youngest person ever to receive two Oscars is actress Luise Rainer, who first set the record when she won two Best Actress awards back to back in 1937 and 1938. She was 27 years old when she won the first for The Great Ziegfeld and 28 years old when she won the second for The Good Earth.

Billie and Finneas would also join Rainer in an exclusive club of Oscar winners who won both awards by age 30. The second-youngest two-time Oscar winner is Jodie Foster, who won her first Oscar for Best Actress at 26 years old for The Accused in 1989 and her second at 29 years old for The Silence of the Lambs in 1992. Hilary Swank just made the cut for the 30 and under club when she won her second Oscar for Best Actress for Million Dollar Baby five months shy of her 31st birthday in 2005, following her first win for Boys Don&#39;t Cry in 2000 at 25 years old.






 Billie Eilish Was Almost The Youngest Best Original Song Winner In 2022 
Billie was only 20 years old when she won
          

When Billie and Finneas won Best Original Song in 2022 for &#34;No Time To Die,&#34; they were only 20 and 24 years old, respectively. At 20, Billie was especially young to win an Oscar in any category. In fact, Billie was close to being the youngest Best Original Song winner in Oscars history, but another singer-songwriter had her beat by one year. Once star Markéta Irglová was only 19 years old when she won the award for Best Original Song at the 2008 Oscars. Irglová won the award for &#34;Falling Slowly&#34; from Once alongside her co-star in the film, Glen Hansard, with whom she co-wrote and recorded the song.


 






 What Are Billie Eilish And Finneas O’Connell’s Oscars Chances? 
The brother-sister duo are strong contenders for the Oscar
         

As it stands, Billie and Finneas&#39; chances of winning Best Original Song at the 2024 Oscars are exceptionally good. &#34;What Was I Made For&#34; has already been shortlisted for a Best Original Song nomination (via Oscars). The song is also up for five nominations at the 2024 Grammys, including Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Song Written For Visual Media. Moreover, Billie and Finneas&#39; recent win for Best Original Song for &#34;What Was I Made For&#34; at the 2024 Golden Globes is a strong indication that they&#39;ll be nabbing the same award at the Oscars.

At this point, their biggest Oscar competition seems to be the two other songs from the Barbie movie that have also been shortlisted. The first is Dua Lipa&#39;s &#34;Dance the Night,&#34; which soundtracks the disco-themed dance party at Barbie&#39;s Dream House early on in the movie. The other is &#34;I&#39;m Just Ken,&#34; a comedic power ballad performed by the film&#39;s male lead (and Ken to Margot Robbie&#39;s Barbie), Ryan Gosling, that chronicles Ken&#39;s inner conflict and identity crisis.




While both of these Barbie tracks serve their purpose in the film and deserve Oscar nominations, &#34;What Was I Made For?&#34; is the heart of the Barbie movie. It captures the core themes of Barbie about self-discovery and understanding one&#39;s purpose in life. As such, Billie and Finneas are the most likely to take home the award of the three Barbie frontrunners. With their Grammy nominations and Golden Globe win for &#34;What Was I Made For?,&#34; plus their previous Oscar win for the same award, Billie and Finneas are a sure thing for Best Original Song for their Barbie track at the 2024 Oscars.
