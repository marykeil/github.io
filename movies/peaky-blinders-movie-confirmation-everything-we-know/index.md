## Literature Review

Though the series concluded with season 6, Peaky Blinders is living on in a feature film, and there are already exciting updates about the new movie.




With the acclaimed series wrapped, attention turns to the Peaky Blinders movie to bring audiences back to the world of Tommy Shelby and the Peaky Blinders boys. Ever since the sixth and final season of Peaky Blinders, fans have been clamoring for the long-teased Peaky Blinders movie, which would presumably wrap up the story. While details are still rather scant, what is known about the Peaky Blinders movie is enough to promise an exciting conclusion. 




The show certainly finished feeling like it had more to tell, and capping off Peaky Blinders with a movie rather than 7th season is an intriguing yet understandable way forward. Peaky Blinders season 6 ended with Tommy left with a choice between seeking revenge against his enemies or continuing with a life in which the world thinks he is dead. While the ambiguity of the conclusion works well, it seems as though the movie would give a definitive answer to that question.

 The Peaky Blinders Movie Latest News 
          

After a ton of little hints, the latest news regarding the feature film continuation sees the production start window for the Peaky Blinders movie finally revealed. Creator and writer Steven Knight has been a major source of information about the movie thus far, and he now reveals that &#34;The plan is to start shooting...in the middle of [2024].&#34; While no hard date has been established, it seems as if things are beginning to take the next step. With production on the horizon, the script is likely either finished or close to it. 






 The Peaky Blinders Movie Is Confirmed 
          

Even if details have been scant, the Peaky Blinders movie is certainly confirmed and has been a work in progress for quite some time. While some comments from actors like Cillian Murphy cast doubt on the project, creator Steven Knight has been spearheading the film from the very beginning, and his production start time update is even more proof that the movie is coming soon. 



 The Peaky Blinders Movie Cast 


 
In terms of official announcements, there has been little regarding the Peaky Blinders movie&#39;s cast, but given which characters were left standing at the end of Peaky Blinders&#39; final season, there are some obvious choices. Though Cillian Murphy cast some doubt on returning as Tommy Shelby for the movie, it stands to reason that the project wouldn&#39;t continue without him. 




Other likely returns include: 

 Actor  Peaky Blinders Role   Paul Anderson  Arthur Shelby   Sam Claflin  Oswald Mosley   Amber Anderson  Diana Mitford   Ada Shelby  Sophie Rundle   Stephen Graham  Hayden Stagg   Tom Hardy  Alfie Solomons   



When asked about familiar faces popping up, Knight confirmed in his interview with Heart Breakfast but said there will also be &#34;some new faces that will hopefully be quite surprising.&#34; One potential new face could be Tom Holland as, after the Spider-Man actor revealed he was turned down for a role on the show, Knight invited Holland to be part of the Peaky Blinders movie.



 The Peaky Blinders Movie Story Details 
          




Something that Knight has revealed (via Radio Times) about the Peaky Blinders movie is that the story is &#34;about a sort of untold story that happened in the Second World War, which Peakys are going to be involved in.&#34; It was always maintained that the beginning of World War II would mark a natural end for the series, so it will be fascinating to see what creative spark led to Knight wanting to explore beyond that.

In terms of the complex protagonist, Knight has always envisioned an ending for Tommy where he is redeemed and no longer the big bad (via Metro). Season 6 of Peaky Blinders touched on Tommy&#39;s redemption as well as his guilt for &#34;crossing the line&#34; in killing Michael. While this was said outside the context of the Peaky Blinders movie, it seems inevitable that this road of redemption will continue for Tommy.
