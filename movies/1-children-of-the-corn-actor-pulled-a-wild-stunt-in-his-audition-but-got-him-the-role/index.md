## Literature Review

An actor from Children of the Corn pulled a wild stunt during the movie&#39;s auditions, which surprisingly helped him land a prominent part in the film.




One Children of the Corn actor pulled a dangerous stunt during his audition for the film and still managed to land a significant role. Based on Stephen King&#39;s novel of the same name, 1984&#39;s Children of the Corn follows the story of a couple trapped in a strange, quaint town, where the local children perform bizarre rituals that involve killing the adult population. Although the movie never achieved mainstream commercial success or critical acclaim, it garnered a cult following and spawned a full-fledged franchise that now includes a total of 11 feature films and one short film.




Owing to the original 1984 movie&#39;s growing popularity, several behind-the-scene stories about its production and development have surfaced over the years. One of these stories reveals that Stephen King had initially written the film&#39;s script, but Hal Roach Studios&#39; executives later hired George Goldsmith to rewrite it. This led to a telephonic debate between King and Goldsmith, but Goldsmith&#39;s script was ultimately favored. Another intriguing piece of production trivia reveals that, during his audition, one of the actors from the film performed a dangerous stunt, which surprisingly became a catalyst for him landing the role.

                  Is Children of the Corn Based on a True Story?   Stephen Kingâ€™s terrifying story Children of the Corn has been adapted many times, but where does the story come from and is it based on real life?   


 Why Courtney Gaines&#39; Malachi Audition For Children Of The Corn Was Dangerous 
          




As revealed in Harvesting Horror: The Making of Children of the Corn (via Youtube), the actor who played Malachi in Children of the Corn, Courtney Gains, went completely methods during his auditions for the role. As the actor himself revealed, he walked inside the audition set and sat cross-legged in the middle of the room. As the audition began, Gains pulled a knife at his partner and even held it under his throat. For obvious reasons, the actor he was rehearsing with was terrified, while the rest of the crew was shocked by what he did. Thankfully, the knife was fake and did not pose any real danger. After initially being stunned by his actions, the filmmakers were eventually impressed by his commitment to playing his character, convincing them to give him the part.


 






 Malachi Was Secretly Children Of The Corn&#39;s Greatest Villain 
          

&#34;He Who Walks Behind The Rows&#34; is the main villain in Children of the Corn, but Courtney Gaines does such an incredible job at portraying Malachi that it is hard not to consider him the greatest villain in the film. Although Malachi initially starts as Isaac&#39;s right hand, ensuring everyone follows the cult&#39;s rules, he later starts rising in the ranks. He becomes all the more terrifying when the children in the cult not only start fearing him but also reach out to him instead of Isaac to confront Burt. Malachi ultimately reigns supreme when he does not hold himself back from questioning Isaac&#39;s ways.

His journey towards becoming the film&#39;s scariest villain begins when he defies Isaac and murders Diehl. Before Isaac can do anything to stop him, Malachi brings out his most malicious side by starting a revolt against Isaac. He ultimately gains so much power and influence that several kids from the cult even join forces with him and support his movement. Although Malachi does not eventually win, his commitment to challenge authority and ruthless pursuit of power make him a standout antagonist in Children of the Corn.




             Children of the Corn (1984) Children of the Corn is now in the pantheon of classic horror movies and there is a lot to like about it. Based on a Stephen King short story of the same name, Children of the Corn is a supernatural slasher set in the fictitious town of Gatlin, Nebraska a small rural town which is surrounded by huge and devious cornfields. The Children of Gatlin are convinced by a particularly evil child, Isaac Chroner, that they need to kill all the adults in the town to appease the gods after a terrible harvest. Isaac, with help of his right-hand dude Malachi, indoctrinates the children into an evil cult that centers around an evil deity called &#39;He Who Walks Behind the Rows&#39;. Three years after the initial slaughtering of the town&#39;s adults, the town is provoked back into action as Vicky and her boyfriend Burt stumble into Gatlin after mauling a child with their car whilst on their way to Seattle. Released in 1984, Children of the Corn is quite a low-budget slasher so don&#39;t go into it expecting a huge blockbuster production, but there is a lot to love about it and at times, it is genuinely scary. The film is concerned with the loss of innocence and aspects of religious fanaticism which is a little on the nose considering most of the towns children have biblical names but different twists and turns as the story progresses really drive the point home. The corn fields are a constant reminder of the complete isolation and accentuates the loneliness and danger that Vicky and Burt have found themselves in.
