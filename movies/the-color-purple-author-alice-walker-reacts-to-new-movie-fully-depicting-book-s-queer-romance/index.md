Summary

  Alice Walker praises the new adaptation of The Color Purple for properly depicting the lesbian relationship between Celie and Shug, stating that it is important for audiences to see that &#34;love is love.&#34;   Previous adaptations of The Color Purple downplayed the lesbian relationship, but the latest adaptation celebrates it and recognizes its significance in Celie&#39;s journey to empowerment.   The film stays true to the source material and portrays physical affection between Celie and Shug onscreen.  






The Color Purple author Alice Walker reacts to the new adaptation’s depiction of a queer romance. Directed by Ghanaian filmmaker Blitz Bazawule, this new adaptation of Walker’s Pulitzer winning novel tells the story of Celie (Fantasia Barrino), a Black woman who lived through the tumultuous era of the early 1900s. The coming-of-age musical, which recently received two Golden Globe Award nominations, stands out from the previous adaptation of The Color Purple (which was directed by Steven Spielberg) by including a lesbian relationship between Celie and her friend Shug (Taraji P. Henson).

Following the release of The Color Purple, Walker spoke to The Hollywood Reporter, commenting on Bazawule’s adaptation of her classic book and particularly the depiction of Celie and Shug&#39;s romance. She stated that audiences need to see that “love is love,” and she’s glad that the new adaptation was able to properly convey and depict the queer relationship between two of the story’s central characters in the way she originally intended. Read her full comments below:


“I really love it that [audiences] have to take away the reality that Shug and Celie become lovers, because I think that we have really needed help there. We really needed to see that love is love. You know, that people love whoever they love, and it is their right to do that.”



 The Color Purple Has Evolved Through Its Different Adaptations

Just three years after Walker released her groundbreaking novel, Spielberg created the first adaptation. His movie starred Whoopi Goldberg as the movie’s protagonist, and she was joined by other talented names like Akosua Busia, Margaret Avery, Willard Pugh and Oprah Winfrey. Even though Spielberg&#39;s Color Purple adaptation was largely successful, some critics lambasted the filmmaker for massively downplaying the lesbian relationship between Shug and Celie.

The subsequent 2005 musical adaptation was very different from Spielberg’s work, as it focused less on the interpersonal relationships and Celia’s trauma, but more about the steps she took toward her joy and empowerment. This change altered the tone of the story for the most part, differentiating it both from Spielberg’s adaptation and even the original source material.

In the latest adaptation of The Color Purple, the creative team stayed true to the source material, and this involved celebrating Celie and Shug&#39;s romance in a way that previous versions failed to do. The depiction of the relationship between Celie and Shug was unequivocal, with physical affection being shown clearly onscreen. The movie understands how Celie and Shug&#39;s relationship was pivotal in the former&#39;s journey to empowerment, and like Walker stated, it is important to depict love as love, as it&#39;s necessary for both representation and emancipation.
