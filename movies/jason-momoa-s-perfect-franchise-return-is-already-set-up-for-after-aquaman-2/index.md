# Jason Momoa s Perfect Franchise Return Is Already Set Up For After Aquaman 2


## SUMMARY 



Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s initial reception has been negative, suggesting the Aquaman franchise is losing steam.

Jason Momoa may have a future in the DCEU, but it&#39;s not guaranteed.

Dune: Part Three is a possibility, and if it happens, Momoa&#39;s character Duncan Idaho will play a crucial role.
