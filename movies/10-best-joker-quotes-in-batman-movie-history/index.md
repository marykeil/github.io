As perhaps the most iconic Batman villain of all time, the Joker has countless incredible and unforgettable quotes from throughout DC movie history. Though Batman has one of the most respectable rogues’ galleries in the world of comics, the Joker has always stood out as his arch-nemesis.

 How To Watch Batman Movies in Order (Chronologically &amp; By Release Date) 
No DC character has been adapted to film more than Batman. As such, here are the chronological and release orders of each and every Batman movie.












 








 10  “How Childish Can You Get?” 
Batman (1989)
        

Tim Burton’s Batman in 1989 introduced Jack Nicholson’s Joker to the world, and the villain offered up a number of memorable moments. One of his most underrated lines comes in the film’s final showdown between Batman and Joker, after the villain tells the hero he’s responsible for his creation. Batman responds by revealing that the Joker killed his parents, saying, “I made you, you made me first.” The Joker responds by parroting back Batman’s words in a mocking tone, adding: “How childish can you get?” It’s a brilliant and easy-to-miss line of dialogue that embodies the spirit of the character – even mid-fight, he’s cracking jokes.





 9  “You Wouldn’t Get It.” 
Joker (2019)
        

Joker wholly redefined the villain, and it also happens to feature a wealth of excellent quotes from its title character. The ending of Joker hosts one of the most popular, which comes during the scene in which Arthur Fleck is being interviewed in Arkham Asylum. After a bout of uncontrollable laughter, Arthur is asked, “What’s so funny?” After explaining that he just thought of a joke, the psychiatrist asks if he’d like to share it. Arthur simply replies, “You wouldn’t get it,” ending the movie on a tantalizingly ambiguous note. It swiftly became synonymous with the film itself, making it one of the greatest Joker quotes of all time.





 8  “This Town Deserves A Better Class Of Criminal.” 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

The second entry in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy introduced Heath Ledger’s Joker, a terrifyingly charismatic and realistic spin on the villain. After the Joker’s plan to take control of Gotham’s crime families begins to take shape, he finds himself in possession of their money. As he sets the cash alight, he simply explains that “this town deserves a better class of criminal, and I’m gonna give it to them.” The quote is a chilling and simple statement of intent, helping to make the chaos sown by the Joker make sense within Nolan’s more grounded world.





 7  “The Worst Part of Having A Mental Illness Is People Expect You To Behave As If You Don’t” 
Joker (2019)


 







Joker was an interesting and somewhat sympathetic look at the villain, examining themes of mental illness in modern society. One particular quote paints Arthur Fleck as a somewhat tragic figure, with him explaining, “The worst part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don’t.” It’s a line that establishes the separation Joker feels from the rest of society, offering an insight into how a relatively normal and mild-mannered man could become radicalized against society through his mental illness.





 6  “I’m Not A Monster. I’m Just Ahead Of The Curve.” 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

One of the best-written elements of The Dark Knight is the Joker’s matter-of-fact justification of his motives. There are few moments in which he makes more sense than in the scene where Batman interrogates him, labeling the villain a “monster.” Joker replies: “I’m not a monster, I’m just ahead of the curve.” The quote shows that Joker truly believes the world is waiting to descend into chaos, and that everyone will understand when they catch up to his way of thinking. The line subtly shows the extent of the Joker’s delusions, helping to further highlight the differences between the film’s hero and its villain.





 5  “Do I Look Like A Guy With A Plan?” 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

Another of the best ever Joker movie quotes comes during the scene in which the Clown Prince of Crime approaches Harvey Dent and gives him a nudge into villainy. Though Dent initially blames Joker for his extensive burns, Joker brushes aside any suggestion of having a plan. His simple rebuttal is: “Do I look like a guy with a plan?” He then gestures to his clown make-up and nurse’s uniform. It’s an iconic line perfectly delivered by Heath Ledger, furthering the Joker’s status as one of the greatest movie villains of all time.





 4  “How About A Magic Trick?” 
The Dark Knight (2008)
        

In what may well be the Joker’s most memorable movie scene of all time, The Dark Knight introduces the villain with a brilliant piece of dialogue. After announcing himself to Gotham’s criminals, Joker simply declares: “How about a magic trick? I’m going to make this pencil disappear!” After placing it upright on the table, he slams a nearby criminal’s head into it, driving the pencil into the man’s skull and making it disappear. It’s a darkly comic moment that perfectly summarizes the Joker’s fearful sense of humor, and one of The Dark Knight’s best moments.





 3  “Have You Ever Danced With The Devil In The Pale Moonlight?” 
Batman (1989)
        

Jack Nicholson’s Joker was a brilliantly comic-accurate depiction of the villain, but he also came with an excellent catchphrase that was spun into a vague joke. Before becoming the Joker, the character is identified as Jack Napier, a member of a local crime family who, before murdering someone, asks them: “Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?” The quote itself is an interesting one, but Joker’s explanation of it makes it better, as he insists he only says it because it sounds menacing. It makes the line simultaneously creepy and funny, rendering it the perfect embodiment of the Joker himself.





 2  “Why So Serious?” 
The Dark Knight (2008)


 







There are many theories about the Joker’s origins in The Dark Knight, partly because the villain himself offers multiple accounts of the nature of his scars. However, the different stories are all accompanied by what swiftly became considered the catchphrase of Ledger’s Joker: “Why so serious?!” Ledger’s frightening delivery of the line made it perhaps the most memorable Joker quote of all time, especially as it usually comes at the end of a particularly disturbing story.





 1  “You Get What You F***ing Deserve!” 
Joker (2019)


 







Joker is filled with brilliant character moments regarding the titular villain, but the best comes at the film’s climax. After being pushed to the edge of sanity, Arthur Fleck is invited onto his favorite talk show, only to learn his hero intends to make fun of him. He responds by telling a joke: “What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? I’ll tell you what you get…you get what you f***ing deserve!” Fleck punctuates his joke by shooting Murray live on TV, making it the most unexpected and iconic quote in the Joker’s Batman movie history.
