# Journey 3 Updates Why The Moon Sequel Isn t Happening


## SUMMARY 



  Journey 3: From The Earth To The Moon was canceled due to difficulty in writing the script and Dwayne Johnson&#39;s busy schedule.   The franchise struggled to find a solid script after the success of the second movie, but it may have been for the best considering the lack of fanbase.   Dwayne Johnson&#39;s recent projects have stuck to the familiar tone of the Journey movies, offering audiences similar all-ages adventures.

## Literature Review

While the franchise was set to continue with Journey 3: From The Earth To The Moon, the movie was canned. Here&#39;s why Journey 3 isn&#39;t happening.




While the franchise appeared to be riding high after the success of the second movie, Journey 3: From The Earth To The Moon was ultimately canceled and Journey 3 is officially not happening, The series launched with 2008’s Journey To The Center Of The Earth, which was based on the famous novel by Jules Verne and starred Brendan Fraser and Josh Hutcherson. Reviewers found the movie gimmicky due to its use of 3D but it was a solid hit for the studio. Journey 2: The Mysterious Island adapted another Jules Verne novel The Mysterious Island with Dwayne Johnson replacing Brendan Fraser as the main protagonist.




Journey 2 was an even bigger hit than the original, with reviews praising the inclusion of Johnson as the franchise&#39;s new leading man. Journey 3 was soon confirmed by the studio, which would adapt Verne’s From The Earth To The Moon, which was initially also going to be filmed alongside Journey 4. During this era, Johnson made his debut in the Fast and Furious franchise as well as joining 2013&#39;s G.I. Joe: Retaliation, cementing his reputation as an actor who could turn around struggling franchises. However, his powers failed to work further on the Journey series as Journey 3 stalled and has since been canceled.

It appears Dwayne Johnson’s hectic workload and focus on other projects when Journey 3 &amp; 4 were still being planned kept pushing them back. Almost nothing was heard about Journey 3 from 2015 to 2018 when Johnson confirmed Journey 3 was canceled because they couldn’t crack the script. This wasn’t much of a shock, considering it had been six years since Journey 2 by that point and there had been little sign of movement on the project. Following the gigantic success of Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle, Johnson moved his attention to that family-friendly adventure franchise with a similar tone which has already become more successful.

In the same way The Mummy star Brendan Fraser was replaced by Dwayne Johnson, the studio could have brought on a new lead actor for Journey 3. However, further recasting would not help the franchise losing both Johnson and Fraser. While the first two movies were fun adventures, Journey wasn’t a franchise that had a burning fanbase either, so it’s easy to see how it fell between the cracks. Johnson’s admission they had trouble coming up with a solid script indicates it might be a good thing Journey 3 didn’t ultimately move ahead too.




Director Brad Peyton and Johnson reteamed again for 2018’s video game adaptation Rampage, and while San Andreas 2 was planned, that feels like another sequel that got lost in the shuffle of Dwayne Johnson’s franchise-heavy schedule. It’s disappointing Journey 3: From The Earth To The Moon didn’t come together, but audiences will have plenty of other Dwayne Johnson movies in the future to make up for it.

Johnson&#39;s Recent Projects Have Stuck To The Familiar Tone Of The Journey Movies
          

Sadly for Journey fans, the past few years have brought with them no signs that Journey 3 might be back on Dwayne Johnson&#39;s upcoming slate. Even with the lackluster performance of Black Adam in the DCU, The Rock has kept busy, with Jungle Cruise in particular honoring the spirit of the Journey franchise. Johnson also starred in Netflix&#39;s action/comedy Red Notice alongside Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot. He&#39;s also set to star in Jake Kasdan&#39;s holiday adventure film Red One alongside Chris Evans in 2024. These movies all capture that all-ages adventure that was achieved in the first Journey movies and that Johnson has stuck to in recent years.

The multi-talented Dwayne Johnson also broke new ground in 2022 by making his debut in the superhero genre. Johnson actually joined the DCU twice over in the same year with both Black Adam and DC League of Super-Pets. He plays the titular villain/anti-hero in the former movie, and in the latter, he voices Superman&#39;s pet, Krypto the Superdog. The animated DC League of Super-Pets continued to deliver the family-friendly mix of humor and adventure Johnson has gravitated towards, particularly because Johnson was joined by one of his most consistent and hilarious co-stars, Kevin Hart, who voices Ace the Bat-Hound.




Black Adam, on the other hand, was a much darker film. Black Adam&#39;s DC Comics origin is a gruesome one, and the character mainly appears as an antagonist to Shazam and Superman, although Dwayne Johnson&#39;s film shifted that narrative somewhat focusing on Black Adam as a standalone character. This move into the DCU proved unsuccessful with Black Adam sequels already being nixed, the Superman cameo becoming awkward after Henry Cavill&#39;s recasting, and the box-office failure of Shazam!: Fury of the Gods. Perhaps this setback will cause Johnson to rethink Journey 3: From the Earth to the Moon.
