## Literature Review



Matt Damon&#39;s return in Bourne 6 is desired by the studio, but the actor has already revealed the one condition the sequel must hit for him to come back. The future of Universal&#39;s action franchise received a major update in late 2023 with the announcement that All Quiet On The Western Front director Edward Berger has decided to tackle the next installment. The limited details available this early on in the process are understandable, but it is known that the studio is hoping Matt Damon will return as Jason Bourne for a fifth movie. What is unknown is if the franchise star has any interest in reprising the role.




The prospects of Matt Damon returning indicate the direction the franchise wants to go in terms of continuing the main saga instead of recasting Jason Bourne for a reboot. However, Bourne 6 is also coming out several years after Jason Bourne received mixed reviews but still found success at the box office. The latter result is likely a key reason why Universal wants a star as big as Matt Damon back to headline the next installment of the $1.6 billion franchise. While the mid-50s actor has found success in recent years away from the franchise, an old interview could hold the key to his Bourne 6 return.

 Matt Damon&#39;s Bourne 6 Return Will Require An Incredible Story 
          

Even though Bourne 6 is just now making progress, the ideas of another movie happening have existed for years, dating back to when Jason Bourne was released. Several months after the sequel debuted and the response to it settled, Matt Damon discussed what it would take for him to come back once again. During an interview with Toronto Sun, the actor laid out a rather basic but important requirement for his return. He said, &#34;It would have to be a pretty incredible story to get us all back on the horse.&#34; This refers to not only him returning, but also the prospect of Paul Greengrass directing Bourne 6.




Damon&#39;s request for Bourne 6 to have an &#34;incredible story&#34; might sound easy, but that is far from the case. There is no shortage of examples in Hollywood of studios haphazardly developing movie scripts or starting production without finished stories. Damon clearly does not want that to be the state of any sequel he partakes in. Knowing this condition, Universal will hopefully take its time developing Bourne 6&#39;s story with the goal of presenting the franchise star with a completed script that meets his high expectations. After all, Damon also said, &#34;Maybe people are done with the character&#34; after Jason Bourne&#39;s performance, so he will not want a repeat.



 Bourne 6 Has Taken A Positive Step To Make Matt Damon&#39;s Return Possible 
          

The good news for Universal and Bourne 6 is that the sequel already looks to have taken a positive step to meeting Damon&#39;s demands. The hiring of Edward Berger as the movie&#39;s director and writer is a great sign. He received an Oscar nomination for his script for All Quiet on the Western Front, which won four Oscars overall, including Best International Feature Film. This might mean that Matt Damon breaks the rules in terms of only returning if Paul Greengrass also came back, but the actor should be excited by the opportunity to work with a different talented creative mind to breathe new life into the franchise.
