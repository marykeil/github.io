## Literature Review

Sam Worthington has had an uneven filmography, but his best movies don&#39;t begin and end with the Avatar series.




Sam Worthington&#39;s filmography spans a fascinating gamut of genres, with an incredible range of both quality and recognition across his movies. Most famous for his role as Jake Sully in James Cameron&#39;s Avatar series, Sam Worthington has failed to become a household name despite landing the leading role of such a culturally important film. Despite Hollywood&#39;s best efforts, Worthington simply wasn&#39;t able to manifest the force of personality or star power necessary to make his name on a poster a guaranteed ticket-seller.
Some have attributed this to Worthington&#39;s somewhat wooden performances, with critics lambasting even his best films as being good despite his acting skill, rather than because of it. Avatar failed to jumpstart Sam Worthington&#39;s career into the big leagues, but his return in Avatar: The Way of Water and its upcoming sequels may finally give his career the boost it needs for him to become a widely-recognized actor. Though he has also made many appearances in the Call of Duty video game series as protagonist Alex Mason, as well as in Australia&#39;s domestic hit Love My Way, it&#39;s Worthington&#39;s movie showings that paint an interesting picture of a Hollywood star struggling to manifest.









 








 10  Terminator: Salvation 
2009


 







Sam Worthington has contributed his efforts to the increasingly convoluted lore of the struggling Terminator franchise, whose multiple timeline-splitting sequels, each with their own separate canon, have consistently failed to attain the same heights of critical triumph as Terminator 2: Judgement Day back in 1991. Among these attempts to revitalize the fading franchise, Worthington stars in Terminator: Salvation as a half-human, half-robot hybrid who faces the wrath of Christian Bale&#39;s John Connor. The dreary post-apocalyptic setting, lack of heart, and studio-approved PG-13 action holds the film back among the Terminator sequels, but even the worst Terminator movie marks the start of Worthington&#39;s best appearances.





 9  Man On A Ledge 
2012
        

At once a tense police drama, a bottle movie trapped on the ledge of a building, and a daring heist film, Man On A Ledge has its fingers in many different genres. Starring Worthington as a disgraced former police officer, the actor&#39;s performance is given perhaps more of a strenuous load here than any other film in his repertoire, being responsible for carrying large portions of the film in which his character simply standing on a ledge is the crux of the action. Man On A Ledge had some interesting ideas, but its performances, including Worthington&#39;s, simply aren&#39;t enough to hold up the ludicrous tale of intrigue woven throughout the failed crime drama.





 8  Rogue 
2007
        

Having been raised in Australia, Sam Worthington gets the chance to play a resident of his childhood home with a moderate role in 2007&#39;s Rogue. Essentially a Jaws clone using a massive saltwater crocodile rather than a shark, Worthington gets the honor of being one of the beast&#39;s many victims in this by-the-numbers man vs. nature story. While critics appreciated Rogue as a solid re-treading of very worn ground, the CGI prehistoric reptile failed to wow audiences, leaving the film as a commercial failure and a rather forgettable entry in Sam Worthington&#39;s catalog.





 7  The Debt 
2010
        

Among Worthington&#39;s blockbuster appearances following the release of Avatar, The Debt stands out as a shockingly solid espionage thriller with an interesting fractured storyline. The film&#39;s story goes back and forth between two time periods, with Worthington playing a younger incarnation of one of the protagonists alongside CiarÃ¡n Hinds. He manages to do a great job convincingly laying the groundwork for his older counterpart as a ferocious Nazi-hunting spy. At once a love story and a tense spy movie, The Debt wobbles a bit under its ambitious storytelling format, but is ultimately carried by Helen Mirren&#39;s knockout performance.





 6  Everest 
2015
        

Helmed by Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin, Everest tells the astonishing true story of mountaineer Rob Hall&#39;s perilous tale of survival during a botched climb up the titular summit. Clarke and Brolin&#39;s believable performances manage to hold their own against the dizzying cinematography, on-location scenes, and depth-defying stunts sure to rattle any viewer with even the slightest fear of heights. Although Worthington&#39;s role is more minor, he still manages to eke his way into an incredibly solid film that stands among the best survival stories inspired by true events to be made in recent years.





 5  Somersault 
2004
        

Something of a breakout role for Sam Worthington, not on the scale of Avatar but enough to put him on James Cameron&#39;s radar, Somersault is a poignant coming-of-age story with perhaps the greatest emotional stakes within the scope of the actor&#39;s filmography. Set in Sam Worthington&#39;s home country of Australia, Somersault tells the intimate tale of a young woman forced out of her home after embroiling herself in a relationship with her mother&#39;s boyfriend, only to find herself in a new romance amidst the touristy town. Worthington manages to hold his own against lead Abbie Cornish&#39;s knockout performance, proving that he can do more than swing a rifle around an alien planet.





 4  Hacksaw Ridge 
2016


 







Another gripping tale based on a true story under Sam Worthington&#39;s belt, Hacksaw Ridge is one of the most critically-successful World War 2 films within recent memory. While Andrew Garfield steals the show as the unabashedly earnest Desomond Doss, the pacifist soldier who single-handedly saved countless lives within the confines of a hostile battlefield, Worthington holds up his end as Doss&#39; commanding officer, Captain Glover. Even if Hacksaw Ridge&#39;s Hallmark movie feel-good sensibilities somewhat clash with its overwhelming depiction of violence, it represents a decidedly high point in Sam Worthington&#39;s post-Avatar career.





 3  Avatar: The Way of Water 
2022


 







After over ten long years waiting for a sequel to one of the biggest original science-fiction hits since Star Wars, James Cameron managed to up the ante on visual spectacle with Avatar: The Way of Water. Even if Sam Worthington&#39;s Jake Sully is both somewhat sidelined as a protagonist, with much of the focus landing on his children instead, as well as trapped within the confines of a CGI Na&#39;vi body, he manages to convey a palpable sense of desperation, now a dangerous man willing to do anything to protect those he loves. While still not anything groundbreaking in terms of story, the Avatar sequel upped the ante for the series&#39; reputation as a visual marvel.





 2  Last Night 
2010
        

A criminally-underrated romantic drama, Last Night poses questions of loyalty and desire in a gripping, tantalizing way that shines light on Sam Worthington&#39;s ability to get hot under the collar. In the film, Sam Worthington plays a married man, across from an excellent performance by Kiera Knightley, who both have chance encounters with an attractive co-worker and an old ex-boyfriend, respectively. Simultaneously struggling to maintain their faith to their partner in the midst of temptation, Last Night provides a tense look into an often-overlooked aspect of martial upkeep with the aid of a pair of truly standout performances.





 1  Avatar 
2009
        

It&#39;s impossible to understate the cultural significance Avatar had on the movie-making landscape, proving the success that a lovingly CGI-crafted world can have on an eager audience to such a powerful degree, that following its release, many viewers experienced &#34;post-Avatar depression&#34; in the wake of Pandora&#39;s breathtaking scenery. Sam Worthington truly lends himself to the character of Jake Sully, an idealistic marine with enough experience to know how to follow orders, but enough of a heart to dare to defy them. Even if the narrative wasn&#39;t the most original, Avatar&#39;s significance on pop-culture, filmmaking, and Sam Worthington&#39;s own filmography cannot be understated.
