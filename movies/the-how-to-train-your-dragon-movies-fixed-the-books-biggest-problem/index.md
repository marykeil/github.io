# The How To Train Your Dragon Movies Fixed The Books  Biggest Problem


## SUMMARY 



  The How to Train Your Dragon franchise made changes when adapting the books, fixing the lack of female characters by introducing Astrid in the films.   The addition of Astrid provided representation of a strong female character with skills and abilities equal to the male protagonist, adding balance to Hiccup&#39;s hero&#39;s journey.   The author, Cressida Cowell, approved of the change and believes that Astrid&#39;s inclusion not only corrected an oversight but also strengthened the fictional Viking world and inspired Hiccup to strive for his best.

## Literature Review

How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s media franchise exhibits its appeal. But the biggest mistake from the books was fixed by the movies, adding to its success.




The DreamWorks Animation franchise How to Train Your Dragon made changes when adapting that fixed the biggest mistake in the books. Starting in 2010, How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s franchise includes three animated feature films, three television series, six short films, numerous video games, comics, graphic novels, and theme park attractions, as well as a live show. Clearly, the adaptations indicate the appeal of the source material, Cressida Cowell&#39;s novel series. The story follows Hiccup, a Viking overcoming obstacles on his hero&#39;s journey.




However, there are numerous ways the movies changed book details to suit the medium. For instance, protagonist Hiccup is 15 years old in the first film, yet he&#39;s 10 and a half years old in the first book. The iconic Toothless is small and can fit on Hiccup&#39;s arm, yet he&#39;s large enough for Hiccup to fly on in the films. While changes are common during the adaptation process, some alterations can even improve the story.

                  The Live-Action How To Train Your Dragon Movie Has 1 Major Problem To Overcome   A live-action How To Train Your Dragon movie is confirmed to be in the works, but one element from the animated films poses a major issue.   


 The How To Train Your Dragon Movies Fixed The Books&#39; Female Character Problem 
          

Aside from Hiccup and Toothless&#39; changes and other minor character tweaks, the films solved the issue of no female characters being in the books by including Astrid. Astrid is a female Viking of Clan Hofferson of the Hooligan Tribe. She&#39;s Hiccup&#39;s longtime love interest and one of his fiercest supporters throughout the films. However, Astrid has no book counterpart. In fact, a very similar female character, Camicazi, was written into the third book How to Speak Dragonese after Cowell was made aware that there were no females in the series yet.




Astrid&#39;s dedication and sense of duty are formidable, as she typically works very hard to improve her fighting and dragon-riding skills. Her drive to protect those she cares about often showcases her prowess as a warrior and her deep loyalty. Including her in the films with these traits brings good balance to Hiccup&#39;s hero&#39;s journey as it provides representation of a female character in an equal position as the male protagonist in terms of skill and ability.

                  8 Biggest Challenges How To Train Your Dragon&#39;s Live-Action Remake Must Overcome   How to Train Your Dragon might be getting a live-action remake, but the beloved animated series will have some big challenges to overcome.   



 How To Train Your Dragon&#39;s Author Appreciated The Book Change 
          

While the How to Train Your Dragon franchise has female characters aside from Astrid in the films, like Hiccup&#39;s mother Valka, they don&#39;t have big roles. Although Astrid was made entirely for the film and TV installments, Cowell was in full support. She noted that DreamWorks was very communicative about any changes they made and that she didn&#39;t realize she hadn&#39;t included a female character when writing the first two books in the series (via Austin American-Statesman). Check out Cowell&#39;s response to the films adding Astrid:





It&#39;s good to have a female character, and [Astrid] fits into that world. It&#39;s a world where the boy is actually looking up to the girl as &#34;How am I going to live up to this?&#34;


What Cowell&#39;s approval suggests is that Astrid&#39;s addition not only corrects an oversight but also strengthens the franchise&#39;s fictional Viking world. By giving Hiccup competition via a no-nonsense female character, How to Train Your Dragon further pushes him to strive for his best - much like Astrid does - which ultimately impacts his hero&#39;s journey. Additionally, a female warrior lead is an inspirational depiction to include in a franchise mostly marketed for kids because it normalizes equality in achievements, regardless of gender.
