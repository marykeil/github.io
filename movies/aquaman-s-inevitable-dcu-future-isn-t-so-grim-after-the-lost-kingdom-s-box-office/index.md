Summary

  Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s box office performance exceeds expectations despite the DCEU&#39;s poor earnings across various consecutive movies.   The sequel&#39;s success suggests that Aquaman&#39;s popularity will secure his future in the DCU despite potential recasting and lineup changes.   While the DCEU left the bar too high, it may be a matter of time until the DCU introduces its new Aquaman.  





Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s box office performance is a good sign for the King of Atlantis&#39; future in James Gunn&#39;s DCU reboot. After a string of critical and commercial disappointments, the DCEU&#39;s last hope to end on a high note rested on James Wan&#39;s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, which chose not to include any nods to the rest of the DCEU and instead focused on Aquaman and Atlantis. But while Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s cast, self-contained plot, and connection to the highly popular Aquaman were always in its favor, the sequel faced an uphill battle at the box office due to DC&#39;s recent unfortunate streak.




Regardless of what Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s ending suggests, Jason Momoa is unlikely to return as Aquaman in James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe, as the reboot will recast the whole Justice League and will likely shake up the team&#39;s line-up in order to stand out from the DCEU&#39;s version. However, Aquaman is a key DC hero and a proven success on the big screen, and his presence in the DCU stands on the line. Whether Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom thrives or flops, its box office results will likely influence the character&#39;s relevance in the DCU, as they reflect the general audience&#39;s interest in the character.


 Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom&#39;s Box Office Isn&#39;t As Bad As Predicted 
          

Although the odds were against Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, James Wan&#39;s Aquaman sequel has definitely exceeded expectations. By December 31, 2023 — 39 days after its December 22 2023 worldwide release date — Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s second-weekend $250 million earnings had already surpassed The Marvels&#39; $199 million, which the MCU movie earned in 51 days since its November 10 worldwide release date. The Aquaman sequel suffered a 51% drop on its second weekend, signaling a worse performance than what its estimated $28.1 million domestic opening suggested. Still, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s performance is nowhere near as bad as other DCEU entries like The Flash, which earned a total of $270.6 million worldwide.






 Aquaman&#39;s Brand Power Is Good For His DCU Future 
         

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom may not match Aquaman&#39;s impressive $1.152 billion, but it will likely stand out from recent movies as the only DCEU title to resist the franchise&#39;s downward trend. The fact that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom also lacks specific criticisms similar to The Flash&#39;s poor CGI and Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson&#39;s monotone performance in Black Adam suggests that its lukewarm reception isn&#39;t entirely due to its quality. Therefore, there&#39;s little keeping Aquaman from appearing in the DCU soon after Jason Momoa&#39;s last DCEU appearance as the King of Atlantis.

                  Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom Post-Credits Scene Explained   We discuss whether Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has a credits scene and explain what it means, how it concludes the DCEU and sets up the DCU.   




Another factor that makes Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s box office run so impressive is that it managed to break the DCEU&#39;s negative streak with very little marketing and no premiere ceremony. Just by popularity and word of mouth alone, Jason Momoa&#39;s Aquaman and DC&#39;s Atlantis have proved to be appealing enough to save the movie from flopping. The Flash, in comparison, became a unanimous box office bomb despite having Barry Allen, Supergirl, Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman, Michael Keaton&#39;s Batman, the DCEU multiverse, and several DC cameos as major draws for fans and general audiences.



 Aquaman&#39;s DCU Future Is Inevitable 
          

James Gunn&#39;s DCU has the option of leaving Aquaman&#39;s introduction for later in the franchise. In fact, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s status as the last DCEU movie supports this idea. However, Jason Momoa has brought the King of Atlantis to A-list status on the big screen, and both Aquaman movies have achieved box office feats that are difficult to ignore. Even if it takes a while for Aquaman to appear in the new DC Universe, Aquaman isn&#39;t a character James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe would want to ignore for too long, both as a box office draw and an appealing character.




                  Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom Fails To Justify Why The Justice League Are Missing   The Justice League is nowhere to be found in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, a problem found throughout the DCEU.   

Aquaman&#39;s comic-accurate costume, characterization, story, and lore have been less divisive than those of Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman and Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman. It may be difficult for the DCU to reinvent Aquaman without too much DCEU overlap. But just like Superman: Legacy has found a way to reinvent Superman for the DCU and The Brave and the Bold will coexist with Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman franchise, the DCU&#39;s Aquaman will likely flourish as an original take on the character and still respect the DCEU&#39;s Aquaman legacy after Jason Momoa&#39;s departure in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
