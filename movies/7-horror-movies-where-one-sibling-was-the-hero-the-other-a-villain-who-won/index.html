  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Siblings in horror movies don&rsquo;t always team up to survive, and sometimes one turns out to be the villain and the other becomes the hero.</p>
<p>Summary
Siblings in horror movies can be heroes or villains, leading to emotional confrontations and traumatic endings.
In &ldquo;Malignant,&rdquo; the twist reveals that Madison&rsquo;s childhood imaginary friend is her parasitic twin who commits murders through her.
The Halloween saga initially had Laurie Strode targeted by her brother, Michael Myers, but later retcons changed their relationship.</p>
<p>Various horror movies have featured siblings as the main characters, and while they usually team up to defeat the villain and survive, there are some where one sibling is the hero and the other the villain. Sibling dynamics can be found in movies of all genres, but when they are the focus of a horror movie, a completely different and often darker side of them is brought to light. Various horror movies have siblings as their main characters, joining forces to stay safe and coming up with a plan to defeat or overcome whatever threat they are facing, while others serve as the villains of the story.
Siblings in horror movies aren’t always on the same side, and some movies have one sibling as the hero and another one as the villain. This, of course, leads to confrontations between them that can sometimes be quite emotional due to the inevitable bond between them, but it also depends on the context. Some villainous siblings end up completely losing their humanity and connection with their sibling, forcing the heroic one to make hard decisions for the benefit of both, though others are completely irredeemable and thus set themselves and their sibling for a traumatic ending.</p>
<p>7  Madison &amp; Gabriel
Malignant</p>
<p>James Wan’s Malignant gave a twist to twins in the horror genre. Malignant follows Madison (Annabelle Wallis), who after her abusive husband smashes her head against the wall, starts having nightmares of people being murdered, beginning with her husband. Malignant opens with a group of doctors treating a violent, disturbed, and seemingly deformed patient named Gabriel, who is later revealed to be not only the killer but also Madison’s imaginary childhood friend. However, the big twist in Malignant is that Gabriel was Madison’s parasitic twin who appeared as a half-formed child facing out of Madison’s back. Although his body was removed, his brain was inside Madison’s cranium and remained dormant until Madison’s head hit the wall.
Madison’s visions were memories of the murders that Gabriel committed by taking control of her body, and Gabriel was also the cause of Madison’s miscarriages as he was feeding on the fetuses. Madison is eventually able to regain control of her body as Gabriel is about to kill her sister, and in a mindscape, she locks an enraged Gabriel behind bars. Madison won that fight, but the final shot of Malignant teases that Gabriel isn’t totally gone and still has enough power to manifest in the physical world.</p>
<p>Malignant: Every Clue To The Gabriel Twist You Missed
Malignant&rsquo;s third act comes with a major reveal about the villain, Gabriel, and there are many clues to this twist throughout the movie.</p>
<p>6  Ginger &amp; Brigitte
Ginger Snaps</p>
<p>Ginger Snaps follows Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) and Brigitte Fitzgerald (Emily Perkins), teenage sisters with a weird fascination with death, so much so that they made a pact to die together at the age of 16. Their lives take a violent turn when, one night, while on their way to exact revenge on a bully, Ginger has her first period, and the blood attracts a creature that had been causing a series of maulings in town. The creature bites Ginger, and she slowly starts to change, gaining a lot of confidence, becoming highly sexual, and physically transforming into a werewolf.
Ginger’s transformation tests her bond with Brigitte and the latter’s loyalty. Brigitte does her best to find a cure for Ginger, and while she finds a temporary solution, Ginger fully transforms before she can give her the cure. With no way out as werewolf Ginger completely lost her humanity, Brigitte kills her sister, but she had already infected herself earlier to show her loyalty. Ginger lost, but it can’t really be said that Brigitte won as she not only lost her sister (and her friend Sam) but she also set herself up for the same fate.</p>
<p>5  Mia &amp; David
Evil Dead (2013)</p>
<p>Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead got the remake treatment in 2013 with big changes to the characters and the story. Evil Dead 2013 didn’t have Ash Williams (Bruce Campbell) as the main character, and instead, it introduced Mia Allen (Jane Levy), who is taken to a cabin by her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez), his girlfriend, and their friends to help her overcome her heroin dependency. When one of their friends reads an incantation from a mysterious book found in the cabin, he unleashes a malevolent force that begins to possess those in the cabin, beginning with Mia.
Mia and David serve as heroes in Evil Dead but at different points, as Mia is also the villain at first. Mia infects David’s girlfriend and the evil force kills the rest, including David. Before his death, David buried Mia in hopes of saving her, and after his death, she goes back to normal and becomes the sole survivor of the massacre after defeating a monstrous creature known as “Abomination”. Mia, then, went from villain (which was caused by another person) to hero, while David died trying to save his sister.</p>
<p>4  Beth &amp; Ellie
Evil Dead Rise</p>
<p>The Evil Dead franchise was rebooted in 2022 with Evil Dead Rise, which is unrelated to Raimi’s trilogy and the 2013 movie. Evil Dead Rise follows Beth (Lily Sullivan), who visits her estranged sister Ellie (Alyssa Sutherland) and her children: teenagers Danny (Morgan Davies) and Bridget (Gabrielle Echols), and child Kassie (Nell Fisher). After an earthquake, Danny finds a book, some recordings, and religious artifacts hidden in a chamber in the basement parking lot, and he makes the huge mistake of reading the book and playing the recordings, summoning demonic entities known as Deadites. Unfortunately, the first one to be possessed is Ellie, becoming the villain, and she goes on to kill and infect the neighbors, as well as Danny and Bridget.
Beth and Kassie team up to find a way out of the building and get rid of the possessed Ellie, who then merges with Bridget and Danny to create a multi-limbed monster known as the Marauder. The possessed Ellie tries to emotionally manipulate Kassie and taunts Beth telling her she will fail as a mother, but together, Kassie and Beth get rid of Ellie and the Marauder by throwing them into a wood chipper – however, this wasn’t the end of the presence of the evil force, as it then targeted another girl.</p>
<p>3  Sidney &amp; Roman
Scream 3</p>
<p>Wes Craven’s Scream 3 saw Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) confronting a new Ghostface killer, now in Los Angeles, during the filming of a new Stab movie. To everyone’s surprise, this time it wasn’t two killers behind the murders but one, and it was Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the movie’s director, who had previously been found dead. More shocking than the reveal of Roman faking his death and targeting the cast and crew of his movie was the reveal that he was Sidney’s half-brother, as he was the son of her mother, Maureen.
Roman explained that Maureen gave him up for adoption, and when he tried to reconnect with her, Maureen rejected him as he was the product of sexual abuse. Unable to take the rejection, Roman started stalking her and filmed her affairs with other men, including Billy Loomis’ father. Roman used this to exact revenge on Maureen, and after showing Billy the footage of his father’s affair, which was the reason for his mother leaving him, he motivated Billy and Stu to kill her, and they later continued with the Woodsboro murders. After getting into a physical fight, Sidney stabbed Roman multiple times and Dewey shot him in the head, defeating another vengeful Ghostface killer.</p>
<p>2  Ruby &amp; Mars, Pluto, &amp; Mercury
The Hills Have Eyes</p>
<p>Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes introduced the audience to a family of cannibals led by Papa Jupiter (James Whitworth) and Mama (Cordy Clark). When the Carter family is targeted by Papa Jupiter and his clan, a series of nightmarish events take place. Helping Papa Jupiter in his horrible cannibalistic actions are his sons Mars, Pluto, and Mercury, but he and Mama also had a daughter, Ruby (Janus Blythe), whom they constantly tortured and abused.
Ruby didn’t share her family’s lifestyle and cruelty and she sympathized with the Carters, helping them escape from her brothers. It’s thanks to Ruby that the baby of the Carter family, Katy, wasn’t eaten by her family. Ruby risked her own life by standing against her family, and thanks to her, Katy, her father, her uncle, and her aunt survived, but the rest of the family were killed.</p>
<p>1  Laurie &amp; Michael
The Halloween saga</p>
<p>John Carpenter’s Halloween introduced viewers to Michael Myers, who, at the age of six, killed his older sister Judith on Halloween night for no apparent reason. Michael was sent to Smith’s Grove Sanitarium, from which he escaped 15 years later, and returned to his hometown, where he targeted Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends. Carpenter’s original movie didn’t give a reason for Michael going after Laurie, but that changed in the sequel. In it, it was revealed that Laurie was Michael’s youngest sister, who was given up for adoption at some point after Judith’s murder. Laurie defeated Michael in Halloween II, but as the saga continued to expand, Michael was brought back, but Laurie was killed off-screen in a car accident.
The first retcon in the Halloween franchise’s timeline brought Laurie back in Halloween H20: 20 Years Later, where she once more defeated Michael… who was brought back again in Halloween: Resurrection, where he killed Laurie. Laurie’s wins were temporary as the Halloween saga kept expanding and bringing Michael back, and in the reboot trilogy, the sibling link was omitted and they weren’t related at all, and Laurie was finally able to kill and get rid of Michael Myers for real this time.</p>
