## Literature Review

Disney&#43; is home to some great movies including animated classics, Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, and so much more. Here are the best available.





While animation undoubtedly remains Disney&#39;s bedrock, Disney&#43; offers much more than the company&#39;s classic, kid-friendly theatrical features. Alongside the likes of Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast sit live-action Oscar winners, sci-fi gems, and soaring romances. Coupled with a strong slate of upcoming Disney movies destined for the platform — not to mention the best TV shows on Disney&#43; — Disney&#43; caters to a wide range of tastes with its film catalog. To guarantee that viewers get a good sense of what&#39;s available, here are the best movies you can stream on Disney&#43; in January 2024.
For more movie streaming recommendations, be sure to check out the best movies on Apple TV&#43; and the best movies on Hulu.

 Best Drama Movies On Disney&#43; 
Miracle On 34th Street (1947)
        

  Miracle on 34th Street  
Family
Comedy
Drama



  Release Date    June 11, 1947     Director    George Seaton     Cast    Edmund Gwenn , John Payne , Natalie Wood , Maureen O&#39;Hara , Gene Lockhart     Runtime    96 minutes    


 An undisputed Christmas classic, 20th Century Fox&#39;s Miracle on 34th Street is both an affecting parable about the power of faith and a thoughtful meditation on the true meaning of Christmas, although it&#39;s one of the best drama movies to stream on Disney&#43; all year round. Telling the story of an old man who gets a job at Macy&#39;s department store as Santa Claus only to claim to be the real thing, Miracle on 34th Street&#39;s message and story has been parodied and imitated endlessly over the years.
However, even though its narrative and message have influenced countless other Christmas movies, it remains a rarely-bettered seasonal gem. Given that it regularly tops lists of the best Christmas films of all time, it&#39;s little surprise that Disney chose to feature it on its streaming platform.

Hidden Figures (2016)


 







  Hidden Figures  
Drama



  Release Date    January 6, 2017     Director    Theodore Melfi     Cast    Jim Parsons , Glen Powell , Kirsten Dunst , Taraji P. Henson , Octavia Spencer , Janelle Monae , Aldis Hodge , Kevin Costner , Mahershala Ali     Runtime    126 minutes    


 Based on the novel by Margot Lee Shetterly, Hidden Figures is a historical drama that deservedly ranks among the best Disney&#43; movies currently available to stream. Telling the inspirational true story of three African American mathematicians (Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae) who worked at NASA during the Space Race, the movie explores the lives of three extremely significant yet often ignored women. Despite some historical inaccuracies, the movie was a box office success, was highly praised by critics, and picked up three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture.

 Best Animated Movies On Disney&#43; 
Aladdin (1992)
        

  Aladdin (1992)  
Animation

Fantasy

Romance



  Release Date    November 25, 1992     Director    Ron Clements , John Musker     Cast    Scott Weinger , Robin Williams , Linda Larkin , Jonathan Freeman , Frank Welker , Gilbert Gottfried , Brad Kane , Lea Salonga     Runtime    90 Minutes    


 Aladdin created a whole new world for Disney when it arrived in theaters in 1992. It tells the story of Aladdin (Scott Weinger), a young and charming street urchin who finds a magic lamp with a genie (Robin Williams) who grants him three wishes. With the Genie&#39;s help, Aladdin disguises himself as a prince to woo Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) but has to contend with the evil Jafar (Jonathan Freeman), who wants both the lamp and Jasmine for himself.
When Aladdin was released, the Disney Renaissance was well underway, but this movie brought it to a whole new level, and became the highest-grossing movie of 1992. Williams&#39; performance also pioneered the casting of A-list actors in voice roles, as he created one of Disney&#39;s most memorable characters. With its colorful animation, catchy soundtrack, and of course, Williams, Aladdin isn&#39;t only one of Disney&#39;s best animated movies, but one of their best movies overall.

Encanto (2021)


 







  Encanto  


  Release Date    November 24, 2021     Director    Jared Bush , Byron Howard , Charise Castro Smith     Cast    Mauro Castillo , John Leguizamo , Carolina Gaitan , Rhenzy Feliz , Diane Guerrero , Wilmer Valderrama , Jessica Darrow , Stephanie Beatriz , Adassa , Alan Tudyk , Angie Cepeda , María Cecilia Botero , Maluma     Runtime    99 minutes     Main Genre    Animation    


 One of two animated Disney movies released in 2021, Encanto has already cemented its status as a studio classic. The movie follows a magical Colombian family, all of whom had powers except for loveable misfit Mirabel. However, when a tragedy occurs and the family finds their powers disappearing and their magical house falling apart, it is up to Mirabel to step up and save her family.
The movie wasn&#39;t as financially successful as other Disney animated movies thanks to its early Disney&#43; release, but it picked up three Oscar nominations, winning Best Animated Feature. Just don&#39;t talk about Bruno.

Beauty and the Beast will go down in history as the movie that changed the relationship between animated features and the Oscars. After its release in 1991, the Disney movie was nominated for the Best Film Oscar, and it was one of the favorites to win the award. However, after it lost, a sweeping measure was passed that finally created a new category for animated movies. Only one other animated movie was nominated for Best Film since, but every animated movie that won an Oscar owed it to this tale of a beast who has to make a woman fall in love with him in order to lift a curse.

 Disney&#43;: 10 Collections That True Fans Should Watch 
Disney&#39;s streaming service has a fantastic slate of collections covering short films, the MCU, Star Wars, animated classics, and much more.



The Lion King (1994)
        

 The cornerstone of the so-called Disney Renaissance, The Lion King is perhaps the pinnacle of the studio&#39;s traditional hand-drawn animation style. A huge hit in 1994 (pulling in close to $1 billion at the worldwide box office, via Box Office Mojo), The Lion King is an innovative take on Shakespeare&#39;s Hamlet, telling a Machiavellian tale of succession and betrayal. These themes meant that the movie unusually dark for Disney, but compelling characters, wonderful songs, and a gripping story gave The Lion King a reputation as one of the best-animated films ever made, and easily one of the best Disney&#43; movies.

  Release Date    November 22, 1995     Director    John Lasseter     Cast    Tom Hanks , Don Rickles , Annie Potts , Tim Allen , Jim Varney     Runtime    81 minutes    


 Toy Story is a landmark movie, credited with kicking off Pixar&#39;s journey to becoming one of the great animation studios as well as beginning one of the greatest movie franchises of all time. The movie&#39;s ground-breaking animation and premise of what toys do when their kids leave the room all laid the groundwork for Pixar&#39;s signature style and effective world-building. However, beyond this, Toy Story is fundamentally one of the best movies about friendship ever made, with the rocky relationship between Woody and Buzz Lightyear turning them both into instant icons. All this easily makes Toy Story one of the best movies available right now on Disney&#43;.

Ratatouille (2007)
        

A fish out of water story that serves as a love letter to cooking, Ratatouille is rightly regarded as one of the best Pixar stories to date. The movie sees a gourmand rat named Remy team up with unassuming waiter Linguine to take over the kitchen at a top French restaurant. The strange premise is starting point for a beautiful story of creativity and the importance of embracing talent in the most unexpected places. Moving and hilarious, Ratatouille is understandably seen as a must-watch for any fans of food and film.

 Proof that Pixar is still capable of producing seminal animated movies, Turning Red has quickly gained a reputation as one of the studio&#39;s best recent releases. The story follows Mei, a young girl living in Toronto who, along with struggling with an overbearing mother and the changes of adolescence, turns into a giant red panda whenever she gets excited. The film is a novel examination of what it means to come of age, doing so in a way that&#39;s simultaneously thoughtful, funny, and entertaining. Originally released directly onto Disney&#43; it remains one of the best-animated movies of 2022, nominated at both the Oscars and Golden Globes.

 Although Avatar 2 has effectively added to James Cameron&#39;s vibrant alien world, the saga&#39;s original adventure on Pandora remains unsurpassed in terms of world-building. The story of Jake Sully learning about the Navi culture and becoming a part of it while trying to thwart the threat of Earth colonizers is both timeless and thrilling. Avatar did the seemingly impossible in becoming the top-grossing movie of all time (via Box Office Mojo), kick-starting an epic Avatar franchise in the process. Cameron combined stunning visuals with masterful storytelling to create something special, resulting in one of the best Disney&#43; movies on the service.

 Ryan Reynolds continued to prove that there&#39;s more to his repertoire than Deadpool with the hugely entertaining and original action-comedy Free Guy. A box office hit on its release in 2021, Free Guy&#39;s cameo-heavy narrative sees Reynolds become a sentient NPC stuck inside a popular video game. The movie&#39;s virtual setting allows it to push visual boundaries, creating a thrilling and often hilarious story. However, it&#39;s the movie&#39;s surprisingly touching emotional core that helps mark Free Guy as one of the best sci-fi movies on Disney&#43;.

 One of the most influential and significant movies in cinema history, Star Wars: A New Hope created an unrivaled legacy and started one of the biggest media franchises of all time. Boasting incredible special effects and an unforgettable story of rebellion against the evil and oppressive Empire, the movie&#39;s iconic components are almost too numerous to count. The introduction of now-iconic characters like Han Solo and Darth Vader, inventions like the lightsaber, and music that continues to pervade popular culture all make A New Hope a must-watch for science fiction fans and indisputably one of the best movies on Disney&#43;.

 Deciding upon the best Star Wars movie is, to many fans, like asking to choose a favorite child, yet many will often agree that The Empire Strikes Back stands head and shoulders above the rest. A dark follow-up to the breezy A New Hope, the movie sees the sinister forces of Darth Vader and the Empire pursue Luke, Leia, and Han across the Galaxy, resulting in iconic one-liners and unforgettable parental revelations. The movie&#39;s 8.7 IMDb score is higher than any movie in the franchise according to fan votes, which coupled with a 94% on Rotten Tomatoes marks The Empire Strikes Back as one of the best movies of any genre on Disney&#43;.

 Disney&#39;s Star Wars acquisition has seen a proliferation of content set in a galaxy far, far away — not all of it good. Rogue One, however, is living proof that there are still plenty of thrilling stories to be told in the Star Wars universe. A prequel set before the events of A New Hope, Rogue One focuses on a daring Rebel mission to locate the Death Star plans. Starring Diego Luna, who has since gone on to star in his own spin-off Andor, the film made over $1 billion worldwide (via Box Office Mojo) and remains one of the highest-rated Star Wars movies based on critics&#39; scores.

 Following the record-breaking success of the original trilogy, the Star Wars prequels were — at least initially — seen as something of a let-down. However, even before the subsequent revaluation, it was clear that Revenge of the Sith was a worthy and epic conclusion to Anakin Skywalker&#39;s tragic arc. Chronicling the end of the Clone Wars and the final fall of the Jedi, Episode III marks Skywalker&#39;s transformation into Darth Vader with some truly epic lightsaber duels, a sweeping gothic narrative, and an undeniably moving finale. While some of the dialogue may not stand up to scrutiny, Revenge of the Sith&#39;s reputation has justifiably grown with age.

 In proving that an R-rated comic book movie based on a Marvel Comics character could become a massive success, Deadpool did what many considered to be impossible. It also gave Ryan Reynolds the superhero role he was born to play after failures like Green Lantern and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.
The movie serves as a revamped origin story for Deadpool and ended up making $782 million on a $58 million budget (via Box Office Mojo). This led to a successful sequel and the film&#39;s release as one of the first R-rated movies to make it to Disney&#43;. Marvel is also making a third movie, also R-rated, under the MCU banner, proving Deadpool&#39;s enduring popularity.

 After years spent languishing in Sony-owned mediocrity, Spider-Man: Homecoming saw the character flourish in the MCU after a cameo appearance in Captain America: Civil War. The result was a reminder of what makes Spider-Man such a unique comic book character. Expertly played by Tom Holland, the MCU&#39;s Peter Parker is both endearingly innocent and frustratingly naive. However, it&#39;s a testament to Holland&#39;s performance that the audience never stops routing for him, resulting in one of Spidey&#39;s most straightforwardly enjoyable cinematic outings yet.

 Directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark, 2008&#39;s Iron Man is the film that launched the MCU, making it easily one of the most influential superhero films ever. Iron Man gave audiences an unlikely protagonist: an egotistical billionaire playboy who starts on a path to becoming the Armored Avenger after being forced to build a metal suit for a group of terrorists. With Downey Jr. now out of the MCU, Iron Man feels all the more impactful and cements its place as one of the best and most important additions to the ever-expanding cinematic universe.

 After the massive cultural impact of Black Panther, the sequel had understandably huge expectations. The movie faced even greater difficulties with the tragic and unforeseen death of star Chadwick Boseman, leading to serious questions about how best to honor the actor&#39;s legacy. The fact that the sequel turned out to be a worthy follow-up and tribute to Boseman is a testament to Ryan Coogler and his team. From Shuri&#39;s rise as the new Black Panther to the introduction of Namor, to Angela Bassett&#39;s Oscar-nominated performance, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever was a fitting end to Phase 4 and a touching tribute to T&#39;Challa.

 If there was ever any question about whether the MCU could maintain its success post-The Avengers, the studio answered the question emphatically with Guardians of the Galaxy. Utilizing a relatively obscure Marvel property, the movies have surprised many with their swashbuckling stories of criminal misfits coming together to save the galaxy. James Gunn&#39;s uniquely irreverent sense of humor was perfectly suited to the Guardians&#39; stories, while the trilogy&#39;s iconic soundtrack has given all three films a distinct identity, resulting in some of the best Disney&#43; movies and a highlight of the MCU.

 Although they exist separately from the MCU, the Sony Spider-Man movies remain a significant achievement in the superhero genre. While they all have their merits, Spider-Man 2 is undoubtedly the best of the bunch. The movie brought back Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, but what really made the film stand out was the villain. Alfred Molina starred as Doctor Octopus, a good man driven mad by artificially intelligent metal arms and an insatiable desire to complete an ill-advised science project. The movie was one of 2004&#39;s highest-grossing movies and picked up three Oscar nominations, winning one.

Jackson , Bradley Cooper , Karen Gillan , Brie Larson , Paul Bettany , Chris Evans , Jeremy Renner , Chadwick Boseman     Runtime    3 hours, 2 minutes    


 Arguably the most ambitious crossover movie ever attempted, Endgame tied up over a decade of interconnected storytelling into an epic, no-holds-barred finale. Following the devastating ending to Infinity War, the current final Avengers movie saw the survivors of Thanos&#39; snap attempt to rebuild the broken world, and even try to restore what was lost.
A mixture of taught storytelling, touching character development, and sly humor saw Avengers: Endgame, for a time, become the highest-grossing movie ever, before being surpassed by an Avatar re-release. However, irrespective of the numbers, the movie is a staggering achievement and one of the best Marvel and superhero movies on Disney&#43;.

 A delightful coming-of-age comedy, The Princess Diaries centers on shy and awkward teenager Mia Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway), who finds out that she is, in fact, a real princess. Mia undergoes a dramatic makeover and is given &#34;princess lessons&#34; from her grandmother Clarisse Renaldi (Julie Andrews), the Queen regent of Genovia.

 Part-typical fairytale romance, part-complete rejection of the genre, The Princess Bride plays with audience expectations to create a completely original and beguiling story. Using the charming framing device of a grandfather reading a story to his grandson, The Princess Bride tells the tale of a common girl who falls for her devoted stable boy only for fate, villainy, and mayhem to challenge their quest for &#34;happily ever after.&#34; As well as its sense of humor, The Princess Bride&#39;s characters may be its biggest strength with the swashbuckling hero Inigo Montoya and gentle giant Fezzik among the highlights.

 Representing the start of one of Disney&#39;s most important live-action franchises, Pirates of the Caribbeans: Curse of the Black Pearl is still the pinnacle of the long-running series. The movie introduces the romance between Orlando Bloom&#39;s Will Turner and Keira Knightley&#39;s Elizabeth Swann, two lovers who became embroiled in a battle with pirates and the Royal Navy. However, the movie will forever be associated with Johnny Depp&#39;s Oscar-nominated performance as the melodramatic Jack Sparrow. Along with the fun of the characters, Pirates of the Caribbean is pure adventure movie entertainment that feels like a throwback, and few movies on Disney&#43; right now can match its huge and thrilling action sequences.

 Easily one of the most popular cult classic Halloween movies ever made, Hocus Pocus also ranks among the best fantasy movies on Disney&#43; movies. Simultaneously scary and funny, the movie focuses on the evil Sanderson witches, who are accidentally resurrected by a teenage boy in Salem, Massachusetts on Halloween night.

 Best Action Movies On Disney&#43; 
The Indiana Jones Series (1981-2023)


 







 One of the most celebrated action-adventure sagas ever, the Indiana Jones series has defined the genre for generations. Starring Harrison Ford as the titular archaeologist, the movies invariably see Indy setting off on a daring, globe-trotting adventure to retrieve a mysterious, historically significant MacGuffin. On the way, Dr. Jones usually faces booby traps, dangerous animals, and, more often than not, Nazis. While some entries are more popular than others, Indiana Jones&#39; impact on cinema culture as a whole cannot be overstated, making the franchise&#39;s arrival on Disney&#43; a welcome addition to the roster.
The fifth film in the franchise, 2023&#39;s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, is now available on Disney&#43;.

Ever After (1998)
        

Ever After fits in well with the best Disney&#43; movies, as it is an innovative retelling of the classic Disney Cinderella movie. Drew Barrymore stars as Danielle, a woman treated terribly by her stepmother and sisters. However, one day, she runs into Prince Harry, and the two fall in love. The movie itself is set up as Cinderella&#39;s &#34;true story,&#34; as told by the Grand Dame to the Brothers Grimm when she was not happy with their written version. The movie ended up with mostly positive reviews and was a box office success, with Barrymore receiving great reviews for her performance.

 Remaking a cinematic classic is a daunting prospect for any director – even for one as decorated as Steven Spielberg – yet West Side Story is a resounding triumph. The Best Picture nominee follows the Romeo and Juliet-like love story of a former member of a street gang who falls in love with the sister of one of his rivals. Fans will recognize the wonderful songs and the tragic love story, but Spielberg revitalizes the narrative with so much energy and beauty that even devoted fans of the original will be blown away. As such, West Side Story deservedly ranks as one of the best movies on Disney&#43;.
