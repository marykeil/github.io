## Literature Review

With the popularity of shows like Chucky, Ash vs. Evil Dead, and The Haunting of Hill House, many horror movies should be turned into TV shows.




With the increasing popularity of horror TV shows, many movies in the genre should be considered for a small-screen adaptation. Though it started out less abundant than its movie counterpart, the horror TV genre has been a mainstay since the 1940s. Iconic shows like The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery paved the way for modern shows like American Horror Story and Slasher. Nowadays, horror is frequently showing up on the small screen.
In addition to creating new concepts for series, it&#39;s becoming increasingly common for networks and streaming sites to make TV shows based on horror movies. Some of the best horror franchises like Scream and Chucky have already been adapted for the small screen. Other shows that haven&#39;t come out yet, like Crystal Lake – the Friday the 13th prequel – and Welcome to Derry – the IT prequel – already have hype among horror fans. The trend of adaptations brings up the question of what other horror movies should be turned into TV shows.
            
 
 10 Horror TV Shows That Are Scarier Than Most Movies 
While horror movies typically boast higher production values, the best horror TV shows can outpace them thanks to the longer storytelling format.












 








 10  The Innocents (2021) 
An Anti-Hero Horror Film With A Strong Premise
        

The Norwegian horror film The Innocents is the perfect choice for a TV show adaptation. This film centers on Nordic children who develop a friendship in which they each reveal that they have supernatural powers that get stronger when they’re together. This premise seems like a setup for a superhero movie, but the film takes a dark, homicidal turn. A TV series version of The Innocents could further explore the dark side of having powers, making the show moody and atmospheric. Additionally, it could serve as a coming-of-age story that looks at the angst of growing up different from peers.
The Innocents is available to stream on AMC&#43; Amazon Channel, Shudder, and Shudder Amazon Channel. 






 9  Midsommar (2019) 
A Psychological Thriller Cult Movie


 







Midsommar is a terrifying horror movie that isn’t paranormal, making it a great option for a TV adaptation. This central cult is complex and includes horrifying practices like the coerced mating ritual and skinning of people. A show could introduce a slow burn that reveals more and more details about the cult as episodes go on. They could remove the problematic representation of bipolar disorder, which is the biggest negative about the movie. Moreover, if they did proper research beforehand, a Midsommar series could easily explore the psychology of cults – a topic that would appeal to audiences who enjoy true crime and crime dramas.
Midsommar is available to stream on Amazon Prime. 






 8  The Shining (1980) 
A Tainted Stephen King Adaptation
        

The Shining is considered one of the best horror movies of all time, displaying Stanley Kubrick‘s genius vision. However, the movie is now tainted for many audiences due to Kubrick’s controlling and cruel tactics on set (via The Hollywood Reporter). Additionally, as an adaptation of Stephen King’s novel, it leaves a lot to be desired.
This film deserves an adaptation that remains faithful to the source material and isn’t the product of abuse. TV would be the perfect format because it allows for much more introspective writing that displays Jack’s progression into a paranoid and homicidal individual. It would also mean that plot points wouldn’t need to be condensed or removed for the sake of time. Important book scenes left out of The Shining movie could appear in a TV adaptation.
The Shining is available to stream on Paramount&#43; Apple TV Channel and DIRECTV. 






 7  The Ring (2002) 
A Terrifying Horror Film With A Vast Backstory
        

The Ring franchise includes over a dozen films and six novels that develop the lore, characters, and horror. Samara’s backstory is so complex that it feels impossible to fit into a single movie, but it would make for a great TV series. A Ring show could help put the story together linearly, honing in on the drama instead of horror. Alternatively, they could focus solely on the deaths tied to the VHS tape. This would make for a good paranormal mystery similar to The Outsider or Orphan Black.
The Ring is available to stream on Paramount&#43; Apple TV Channel and Hoopla. 






 6  It Follows (2017) 
A Slow-Burn Horror Film With A Mystery


 







The incredible standalone horror film It Follows is unique in that it is extremely bare-bones. There isn’t any explanation as to what the entity following everyone is or how it came to be. All that’s known is that it transfers from person to person through sex, and it will kill whoever it’s following.
A TV adaptation of It Follows would have a lot of potential due to the lack of lore. A show would be able to offer some kind of backstory for the entity. Moreover, it would be a good examination of morality, humanity, and consent. Characters would be forced to choose between dying or violating someone’s consent if they couldn’t find a partner willing to take on the entity.
It Follows is available to stream on Netflix, fuboTV, Paramount&#43; with Showtime, Paramount&#43; Apple TV Channel, Paramount&#43; Amazon Channel, Showtime Roku Premium Channel, Showtime, and DIRECTV. 

            
 
 They Follow: Everything We Know About It Follows 2 
They Follow is the upcoming sequel to the critically acclaimed 2014 horror movie, and here&#39;s what we know about It Follows 2. 








 5  A Quiet Place (2018) 
A Sci-Fi Horror Film With Incredible World-Building


 







John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place movie series does a great job of world-building, playing with the senses, and creating a unique alien species. The characters are so well-written that it’s easy to invest in their emotional journeys. A Quiet Place’s timeline and concept are so vast that there are an almost infinite number of directions that a story could go. All these elements make it the perfect choice for a horror TV show adaptation. A series would be able to explore another family or group&#39;s experience living through the horrifying events.
A Quiet Place is available to stream on fuboTV, Paramount&#43;, Paramount&#43; Apple TV Channel, Paramount&#43; Amazon Channel, Paramount&#43; Roku Premium Channel, FXNow, and DIRECTV. 






 4  Cabin in the Woods (2011) 
A Satirical Horror Film With An Expansive Concept
        

One of the best horror satire films is Cabin in the Woods which involves a group of college students staying in a cabin in the woods where they get attacked by monsters. The movie reveals that technicians orchestrated the entire incident. The only letdown caused by this is the fact that Cabin in the Woods chose the most boring monsters. After seeing options like the merman and the sugarplum fairy, it’s disappointing they faced the Buckners. A Cabin in the Woods TV show could take an anthological approach, showing different groups of people facing the other monsters. Additionally, it could take a look at the people running the underground facility.
Cabin in the Woods is available to stream on DIRECTV. 






 3  The Blair Witch Project (1999) 
A Found Footage Mystery Horror Film
        

A prime option for a horror movie-to-TV adaptation is The Blair Witch Project. This movie has all the makings of a good TV show. The lore is mysterious, allowing episodes to reel in audiences with the question of who the Blair Witch really is. The messages about insecurity and fear of the unknown are timeless. Additionally, because not much is known about the Blair Witch, writers would have room to explore other themes through flashbacks to the 18th century. What’s more, the shaky cam and found footage elements would set it apart from other TV series in the genre.
The Blair Witch Project is available to stream on Paramount&#43; Apple TV Channel, Criterion Channel, MUBI, MUBI Amazon Channel, and Amazon Freevee. 






 2  Cube (1997) 
A Gory Horror Movie With A Major Mystery
        

One of the most underappreciated horror franchises of all time is Cube. These movies explore themes like trust, existentialism, capitalism, and nihilism. With the current chaos of the world, Cube is more relevant than ever. This makes it the ideal time to adapt the franchise into a TV series. A show could continue to explore these topics while offering more blood and gore. Additionally, the movies only provide a very loose explanation as to who made the cube, how the characters got there, and why their memories are missing. A TV adaptation could keep this mystery going while offering little clues about the people responsible for the death trap.
Cube is available to stream on Amazon Prime Video, Hoopla, Tubi, and Amazon Freevee.

There has been a massive outpouring of horror TV shows in 2023 across streaming sites and network television, with some standing well above the rest.








 1  The Bad Seed (2018) 
A Psychological Thriller Movie Centering On A Child
        

While many movies speak to the time in which they came out, The Bad Seed is a timeless horror story that has been told in book, play, and movie formats. Each of these versions has its own unique strengths due to the medium. Despite this, The Bad Seed could be best told through a TV show because the story is a slow burn and highly psychological. A show could explore more of the nuances of child psychology and the things that drive humans to kill. Additionally, by splitting it up into episodes, the horror story could show the escalation of Emma’s behaviors as she becomes homicidal.
The Bad Seed is not currently available to stream.
