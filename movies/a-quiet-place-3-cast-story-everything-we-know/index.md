## Literature Review
John Krasinski&#39;s A Quiet Place franchise is officially two films deep, and here&#39;s what we know about A Quiet Place 3&#39;s release, cast, and story.




A Quiet Place 3 news has been slow, but there is still a lot of hope for more from the acclaimed horror franchise. Paramount found a surprise franchise starter in 2018 when John Krasinski&#39;s A Quiet Place was praised by critics and became a box office hit. After several delays caused by COVID-19 shutting down theaters, A Quiet Place 2 moved from early 2020 to the summer of 2021. The sequel was once again directed by Krasinski and stars Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott, who continues to guide her children through an alien-plagued existence where any sound can get them killed.




It has been announced that Mud director Jeff Nichols is writing and directing a Quiet Place spinoff in 2024, known as A Quiet Place: Day One. This A Quiet Place prequel will detail the initial invasion of the terrifying sound-sensitive aliens â€” and while it will be the third A Quiet Place movie, it isn&#39;t A Quiet Place 3. The story of A Quiet Place Part II sets up how this franchise can continue to form a proper trilogy, and what&#39;s been teased of A Quiet Place 3 so far shows that all due care is being taken to only move forward with a worthy next chapter.


 The Latest A Quiet Place 3 News 
Emily Blunt Discusses The Sequel
   Close     

The most recent A Quiet Place 3 news offers an update from one of the franchise stars. Emily Blunt addressed A Quiet Place 3 possibilities and confirmed that it has recently been discussed with her husband and director John Krasinski, as well as Blunt&#39;s Oppenheimer and A Quiet Place 2 co-star Cillian Murphy. Blunt reveals that &#34;Cillian [Murphy] and I were having a chat with John [Krasinski] about it last night. We were sitting on a rooftop together drinking wine and... &#39;You know what would be great? Is if we keep this going...&#39;&#34;




This news isn&#39;t a confirmation of any concrete plans for A Quiet Place 3, but it&#39;s still positive to see that the key creative minds behind A Quiet Place are exploring how to continue the story. However, Blunt also revealed that there is a stipulation for her returning for the sequel as she suggested that &#34;it would have to be that we would all do it together. I don&#39;t want it to be with a different director if we did it again.&#34; It isn&#39;t clear if Krasinski would return as director for the third movie.

What Could Happen In A Quiet Place 3?
          




There are no official details available for A Quiet Place 3 story at this time, but Krasinski does have a tentative idea of where the trilogy capper could go narratively. A Quiet Place 2&#39;s main storyline saw Regan and Emmett track down a mysterious radio signal where they discover an island that&#39;s a safe haven for humans. Presumably, A Quiet Place 3 will try and extend this plot point, seeing the humans attempt to fight back. Emily Blunt has said a Quiet Place trilogy has been planned, and it is safe to say that Quiet Place 3 will continue to explore how humanity resists the aliens.
