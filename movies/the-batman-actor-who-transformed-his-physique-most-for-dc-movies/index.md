Summary

  Christian Bale underwent an extreme physical transformation to play Batman, gaining 100lbs to portray the character&#39;s imposing physique.   Bale&#39;s dedication to bulking up for Batman was so high that Christopher Nolan asked him to drop around 20lbs due to how much he had gained.   Bale&#39;s training regime for Batman included focusing on eating to slowly gain weight after The Machinist, followed by intense workouts targeting different muscle groups.  





A Batman actor takes the top spot among the rest due to how his physique was transformed to play DC&#39;s Dark Knight. Many actors have played Batman in live-action over the years, with Michael Keaton, Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, and Robert Pattinson&#39;s versions of the Dark Knight currently standing as the most popular takes on Batman in his long movie history. To play a hero who is at peak abilities for a human, the Batman actors have had to undergo extreme transformations.




Strict diets and intense training regimes are to be expected whenever an actor gets cast to play a superhero. However, as Batman is an extremely demanding role that means so much to a lot of people, becoming the perfect representation of the character takes a lot of work. With three different versions of Batman appearing in live-action over the past two years — Pattinson in 2022&#39;s The Batman and Keaton &amp; Affleck in 2023&#39;s The Flash — Bruce Wayne remains as popular as ever. Whoever plays Batman in The Brave and The Bold could learn from how the previous Batman actors prepared for the role, especially from how one of them did.

 Christian Bale Changed His Body Most To Play Batman 
          




Christian Bale is famously known for being one of Hollywood&#39;s chameleons, who are actors that can go through extreme physical transformations to fit their characters. That led to Bale becoming the Batman actor who changed his body the most to play the DC hero in the first of director Christopher Nolan&#39;s Batman movies — 2005&#39;s Batman Begins. While Bale would have to add a little muscle to his usual physique to play Batman, the actor&#39;s busy schedule made that transformation a lot more drastic.

Bale had six months to go from his role in The Machinist, which he had lost 60lbs for, to starting filming on Batman Begins. The physical transformation for his role in The Machinist reportedly brought Bale&#39;s weight down to just 120lbs. To convincingly portray Batman&#39;s imposing physique, Bale would not only regain the weight he had lost for The Machinist but also put on an extra 40lbs, totaling a 100lbs-gain to play Bruce Wayne in Batman Begins. Bale&#39;s dedication to bulking up for Batman was so high that Nolan ended up asking the actor to drop around 20lbs due to how much he had gained.






For comparison, Ben Affleck put on 40lbs to play Batman in his first DCEU outing, which is the closest physical transformation from an actor to play Batman after Bale&#39;s impressive weight gain.






 How Christian Bale Got Into Batman Shape For DC 
          

Speaking to TRAIN Magazine, Bale explained his training regime to play Batman. According to the actor, he had to first focus on eating rather than working out, as he had to slowly gain weight to safely exercise, saying, &#34;At the start I was eating often, and I was eating foods very high in calories because I lost 60lb.&#34; After Bale could work out properly, the actor revealed that he &#34;would do splits – every day focusing on a different muscle group. I would do three sets of 10 to eight, depending on what I was working on.&#34; In the end, Bale had the biggest physical transformation to play Batman yet.
