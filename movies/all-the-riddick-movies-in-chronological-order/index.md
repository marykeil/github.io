## Literature Review

The Riddick movies helped launch the career of Vin Diesel and make him a star, but what is the chronological order of the films in the franchise?




The Riddick movie franchise was a major stepping stone in Vin Diesel&#39;s career, but without consistency in the titling of the three installments, their viewing order is not immediately clear. Starting in the year 2000 with the sci-fi/horror film Pitch Black, the series quickly found its star in the form of its antihero, Richard Riddick (Diesel), and the franchise continued with additional movies. Though the Riddick movies have received mixed critical reactions, the series gained a loyal fanbase and its films became cult classics in their own right.




Even if the Riddick movies weren&#39;t critical darlings, there was enough interest to keep the franchise going, with 2013&#39;s Riddick boasting modest box office success, which was enough to greenlight a fourth film, the upcoming Riddick 4: Furya. Every Riddick movie has its own strengths, and the series has the uncanny ability to build a compelling world within the universe of the story. The extraneous media and short films helped to further flesh out that world-building, but the features are essential viewing. The Riddick movies can be enjoyed as standalone adventures, but they are best experienced in the order in which they were released.

                  Riddick 4: Furya - Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Vin Diesel is returning for Riddick 4: Furya. Here&#39;s what we know about the sequel&#39;s development status, story details, and potential release date.   


 Pitch Black (2000) 
The Humble Sci-Fi Horror That Kickstarted A Franchise
         




   Pitch Black      Release Date    February 18, 2000     Director    David Twohy     Cast    Claudia Black , Vin Diesel , Keith David , Cole Hauser , Radha Mitchell     Runtime    109 minutes      

The 2000 sleeper hit Pitch Black is set in the distant future and follows the passengers aboard the Hunter-Gratzner, which crash-lands on a mysterious planet with their only hope of survival coming from a notorious criminal named Riddick. Unlike the other Riddick movies&#39; more action-oriented slant, Pitch Black plays up the horror elements of its plot for a moderately scary result. Though Diesel wasn&#39;t the original choice for Pitch Black&#39;s Riddick, he turned out a star-making performance only a year before 2001&#39;s The Fast and the Furious made him a household name.



 The Chronicles Of Riddick (2004) 
The Second Riddick Movie Significantly Expands The Lore Of Vin Diesel&#39;s Hero
          




   The Chronicles of Riddick      Release Date    June 11, 2004     Director    David Twohy     Cast    Colm Feore , Vin Diesel , Thandie Newton , Karl Urban , judi dench     Runtime    119 minutes      

Hot on the heels of Pitch Black, 2004&#39;s The Chronicles of Riddick catches up with the titular criminal five years after the first movie and sees him take on the Necromongers, a race bent on destroying all human life in the galaxy. The sequel elevates the action, and by equal measure, ramps up the cheesiness for an appealing popcorn movie. Diesel got a chance to show off more of his action hero abilities, and the high-octane thriller introduced more of the universe within the Riddick movies. The Chronicles of Riddick grossed $115 million (via Box Office Mojo) but still fell short of expectations both critically and commercially.

                  Riddick&#39;s Home World Furya Explained (Why It Was Wiped Out)   Vin Diesel&#39;s antihero Riddick came from a planet named Furya, which will feature in the upcoming fourth movie. There&#39;s his home planet explained.   






 Riddick (2013) 
The Third Riddick Movie Cemented The Trilogy
          

   Riddick      Release Date    September 6, 2013     Director    David Twohy     Cast    Katee Sackhoff , Vin Diesel , Dave Bautista , Bokeem Woodbine , Karl Urban , Raoul Trujillo , matt nable , Jordi Molla     Runtime    119 Minutes      

After The Chronicles of Riddick found new life on DVD, it joined the ranks of some of the best Diesel movies and was eventually followed by 2013&#39;s Riddick. This installment centers on Riddick after he&#39;s left stranded on a desert planet with his only means of escape coming from a beacon that will summon his greatest enemies to kill him. After almost 10 years away from the role, Diesel returned as Riddick with absolutely no rust. Though Riddick was dismissed by critics as a generic action romp, it grossed almost $100 million (via Box Office Mojo) and ensured the Riddick movies would continue in the future.

The Riddick franchise is finally receiving another installment with the announcement that Riddick 4: Furya is in development. It’s been another 10 years since Diesel played Richard Riddick and this time, he’s returning to his homeworld, Furya following the events of Riddick. After having mentioned his harsh planet in previous films, this will be the first time Riddick has returned and by meeting people from his past, more light will be shed on his backstory.

In the next Riddick movie, Vin Diesel&#39;s hero will also have to contend with a new enemy as he takes up the fight alongside his fellow Furyans. No release date has been announced but David Twohy, director of the previous three Riddick films, will return to the helm.
