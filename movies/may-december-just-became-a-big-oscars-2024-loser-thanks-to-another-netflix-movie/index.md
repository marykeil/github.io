# May December Just Became A Big Oscars 2024 Loser Thanks To Another Netflix Movie


## SUMMARY 



  &#34;May December&#34; lost momentum after a disappointing showing at the Golden Globes, receiving no awards and losing steam for the upcoming Oscars.   The film&#39;s lead actors, Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton, did not receive nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards, further damaging their Oscar chances.   Another Netflix movie, &#34;Nyad,&#34; featuring Annette Benning and Jodie Foster, has stolen some of &#34;May December&#39;s&#34; thunder and may be safer bets for Oscar nominations.

## Literature Review

The key cast of Todd Haynes&#39; melodrama May December initially generated a lot of Oscar buzz, but recent award season road bumps may block their paths.




Todd Hayne&#39;s May December, once thought to be a formidable 2024 Oscar contender, has lost a lot of steam after a disappointing showing at the 2024 Golden Globes. The acclaimed film was nominated in four categories at the Golden Globes, which aired Sunday, January 7, 2024 on CBS, including Best Actress, Comedy or Musical (Natalie Portman), Best Supporting Actress (Julianne Moore), Best Supporting Actor (Charles Melton), and Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. Going into the ceremony, Melton had gained some momentum after picking up a win at the Gotham Awards in late November 2023.




While there&#39;s been some confusion regarding May December&#39;s classification as a comedy movie, which most would call more of a melodrama than anything, the film likely wouldn&#39;t have garnered any additional advantage if it were categorized as a drama anyway. May December and its main cast of Portman, Melton, and Moore had already picked up several notable regional Film Critic awards in Chicago, Florida, and New York, but a new development may have thwarted any lingering hope that May December will have a big night at the 2024 Academy Awards.

                  Golden Globes 2024&#39;s 10 Biggest Snubs &amp; Surprises   The 2024 Golden Globes had a fairly straightforward and expected list of winners, but there were a few surprises and snubs at the 81st ceremony.   


 May December&#39;s Three Leads All Missed Out On SAG Nominations 
         




In a surprising turn of events, Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, and Charles Melton all did not receive nominations for the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards, which are set to stream live for the first time on Netflix on February 24, 2024. Once considered potential Oscar favorites, especially in the case of Melton&#39;s breakthrough performance as Joe Yoo, all three of May December&#39;s key cast will not be in consideration at this year&#39;s SAG Awards. This, combined with its 0 for 3 performance at the Golden Globes, paints a much dimmer outlook on its Oscar chances.

It&#39;s unclear whether the recent public emergence of Vili Fualaau, who Melton&#39;s Joe character is based on, has affected May December&#39;s award season momentum. Fualaau hadn&#39;t publicly commented on the film following its December 1 release on Netflix until an article from The Hollywood Reporter, published on the morning of January 4th, the day of the Golden Globes, expressed Fualaau&#39;s frustration that he hadn&#39;t been contacted about the film. “I’m offended by the entire project and the lack of respect given to me — who lived through a real story and is still living it,&#34; Fualauu stated.




                  May December Ending Explained   The multifaceted ending of Todd Haynes&#39; May December finds Portman&#39;s Elizabeth contemplating the truth of Moore&#39;s controversial Gracie character.   



 Netflix&#39;s Movie Nyad Has Stolen Some Of May December&#39;s Thunder 
         

What is clear is that another Netflix movie has apparently stolen some of May December&#39;s thunder. Annette Benning and Jodie Foster star in the biographical sports drama Nyad and were both nominated for SAG Awards over Portman and Moore, respectively. The key May December cast could certainly bounce back with expected nominations in their individual acting categories. However, after leaving the Golden Globes empty-handed and being out of consideration at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Benning and Foster might be safer bets to be nominated at the upcoming 2024 Oscars.
