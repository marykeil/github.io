## Literature Review

There have been quite a few films about kids with powers in recent years and they showcase how young people can be the heroes of their own stories. 




There are a lot of movies about kids with powers, mostly in superhero films and magical young adult fantasy releases. It&#39;s a popular subgenre of movies that attracts audiences of all ages, making them some of the most profitable franchises of all time as well. One franchise that features children with magical powers has not only made over $7.7 billion worldwide at the box office, but spawned sequels, theme park rides, and an entire subculture that revolved around the magical world. Thanks to those success stories, more movies about kids with powers are sure to come, many of varying levels of success.

However, some are very different, including superhero movies based on kids and teens and movies in a dystopian world where their powers put them at odds with evil authority figures. There are also horror, animation, and fantasy versions of these tales, offering the best movies about kids with powers to entertain kids of all ages.
            
 
 20 Best Movies About Magic Ever Made 
From the charm of old Disney animated films to the thrills of Guillermo del Toro&#39;s work, these are the best movie about magic and illusion.












 








 20  Escape To Witch Mountain (1975) 
Starring Kim Richards &amp; Ike Eisenmann
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
Disney was ahead of the game with 1975&#39;s Escape to Witch Mountain, which introduced the mysterious siblings, Tia and Tony, who have psionic powers similar to premonitions, telepathy, and telekinesis that make them targets of an occult-obsessed millionaire. The film follows Tia (Real Housewives star Kim Richards) and Tony as they follow a map to Witch Mountain, hoping to uncover the secrets of their mysterious origins. The film launched film and TV sequels, a TV remake, and a big-budget re-imagining starring AnnaSophia Robb and Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson called Race to Witch Mountain in 2009.





 19  The Darkest Minds (2018) 
Starring Amandla Stenberg, Miya Cech, Harris Dickinson &amp; Skylan Brooks


 







 Rent Now On Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

The Darkest Minds is an adaptation of Alexander Bracken&#39;s YA novel of the same name, which takes place in a dystopian future plagued with a disease that wipes out nearly the entire population of minors. The survivors are gifted with powerful abilities, which leads to their imprisonment and the development of a powered resistance. The film was intended to launch a franchise that followed the book series, though a sequel has yet to move into development. Part of the reason was that it was a box office bomb, making only $41.1 million off a $34 million budget (via Box Office Mojo), although it was never as bad as reviews indicated.





 18  Miss Peregrine’s Home For Peculiar Children (2016) 
Starring Eva Green &amp; Asa Butterfield
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
Tim Burton is one of those directors who can find both the right material and the right actors to bring his vision to life. He seems to have found both in Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children, since the book is very much the sort of thing that Burton has shown an affinity for in his career, and Eva Green is just the right kind of off-beat star to bring the titular character to brilliant life. The movie introduces audiences to the kids at Miss Peregrine&#39;s home for kids with powers and shows their relationship and awkward situations as a young boy from the future travels back in time to find out what happened to his grandfather.





 17  Percy Jackson And The Olympians (2010-2013) 
Starring Logan Lerman, Brandon T. Jackson, &amp; Alexandra Daddario
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
It takes a particular sort of writing talent to make Greek mythology unique and do something new and exciting with it. However, that’s precisely what Rick Riordan’s books do. The film version of Percy Jackson and the Olympians and its sequel manages to keep the spirit of Riordan’s books with a fantastic starring turn from Logan Lerman. Fans of the books often slammed the movies for changes made to the story, which made it almost impossible to carry on. However, taken on their own, the movies are great fun, and a new Disney&#43; Percy Jackson series arrived in 2023, delivering something even better - and more loyal to the books.





 16  I Am Number Four (2011) 
Starring Alex Pettyfer &amp; Teresa Palmer


 







Stream Now On Hulu
I Am Number Four is another young adult movie that was based on a YA novel. The novel series by Pittacus Lore (a pseudonym for James Frey) tells the story of alien children sent to Earth and put into hiding as a monstrous alien race attempts to wipe out their entire species. Each child was numbered and would gain their powers while mentored by a &#34;guardian.&#34; Alex Pettyfer stars as Number Four (John Smith) and when the aliens find and start killing the other kids, he begins to realize he has to power up to save himself and the rest of his kind. Teresa Palmer plays another of the kids. While the movie was a box office disappointment, it deserved a better reception than it received.





 15  Power Rangers (2017) 
Starring Dacre Montgomery, RJ Cyler, Naomi Scott, Becky G, &amp; Ludi Lin
        

 Stream Now On MGM&#43; 

Power Rangers was supposed to relaunch the franchise on the big screen in 2017. It was mostly an entertaining spectacle of a movie and did a lot of great things, although nothing ever followed it on the big screen to continue the story. The five Rangers were a very diverse cast of characters and both Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Banks were great as Zordon and Rita Repulsa. The movie made $142.5 million at the box office, but that wasn&#39;t enough to warrant the budget of $100 million (via Box Office Mojo). The kids were all great in their roles with Dacre Montgomery, RJ Cryer, Naomi Scott, Becky G, and Ludi Lin set up as the Power Rangers of the future.

 14  Sky High (2005) 
Starring Michael Angarano &amp; Danielle Panabaker
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
2005&#39;s Sky High took place at the titular school for superheroes where the son of the world&#39;s greatest superheroes (played by Kurt Russel and Kelly Preston) attended, despite not developing any superpowers of his own. The movie explored typical norms of high school life through a superhero filter and featured a number of cameos and surprising stars, while also providing a fun adventure with some great costumes and a wide variety of powers from the superheroes, sidekicks, and even future villains in training. Sky High was always supposed to be light fun, and it delivered on that, becoming a minor cult film in the years after its release.





 13  Brightburn (2019) 
Starring Jackson A. Dunn
        

 Stream on Fubo 

James Gunn proved his mettle as a comic book movie director with both Guardians of the Galaxy and The Suicide Squad. However, he also worked in the genre with his movie Super, and then in 2019, he produced the R-rated supervillain movie Brightburn. This film asked an interesting question: What if Superman crashed on Earth as a baby and grew up to be a villain instead of a hero? When Brandon crashed on Earth, a family took him in and adopted him. When he turns 12, he discovers he has powers and that is not good since he has also developed anger issues and soon goes on a murderous rampage, showing the effects of superpowers gone wrong.





 12  Shazam! (2019) 
Starring Zachary Levi &amp; Asher Angel


 







Stream on Max
While they don&#39;t look like movies about kids with powers, the Shazam! movies are just that. Billy Batson and his foster siblings are all kids, from late teens down to tweens. However, after Billy became Shazam! and shared his powers with his siblings, they became the Marvel Family and set out to save the world from danger as the newest team of superheroes. It is an interesting look at the idea of kids with powers because they also gain the adult bodies to use the powers while keeping their childlike mentality. The first movie was a wide critical success, while the second Shazam ended up a slight disappointment as one of the final DCU movies in Zack Snyder&#39;s world.





 11  Matilda (1996) 
Starring Mara Wilson
        

 Rent on Roku 

Matilda was released in 1996, based on the novel of the same name by Roald Dahl. The novelist’s books have had a bit of a checkered history when it comes to their translation to the big screen, but this one manages to do the original book justice, in no small part because of the performances of both Mara Wilson as Matilda and Danny DeVito as her father (DeVito also directed the film). This is one of the movies about kids with powers set in the world of magic, as Matilda has immense powers but has to learn how to control her emotions so she can achieve happiness in the face of people wanting to control her future.





 10  The Craft (1996) 
Starring Fairuza Balk, Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell, &amp; Rachel True
        

 Stream now on Paramount&#43; 

Another one of the movies about kids with powers set in the world of magic, The Craft followed four high school friends who practiced black magic and developed powers of varying levels thanks to tapping into this world. However, each of the women would take their powers in a different direction, and when they started to go to the side of evil, it took one of them to stand up and stop their reign of terror before everything spiraled out of control. The movie ended up as a cult classic and even picked up a sequel 24 years later called The Craft: Legacy.





 9  The Golden Compass (2007) 
Starring Dakota Blue Richards
        

 Rent On Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

The Golden Compass is a textbook case of what might have been. Based on Philip Pullman’s enormous trilogy of novels and following the girl Lyra, it seemed to have all the makings of a blockbuster. Unfortunately, a number of ill-advised creative choices robbed the film of much of the novel’s original bite, and it limped along at the box office. For all of that, it is actually quite a good film, with some truly beautiful special effects and strong performances, most notably from Nicole Kidman as the villainous and cunning Mrs. Coulter. The books got another chance years later on HBO with His Dark Materials.





 8  Chronicle (2012) 
Starring Dane DeHaan, Alex Russell, &amp; Michael B. Jordan


 







 Rent on Prime Video &amp; Apple TV 

Chronicle brought a fresh turn to movies about kids with powers in that it was an addition to the found footage movies genre. Unlike many found footage movies that were often straight horror movies with jump scares, this one was a little different. While still a horror movie at heart, it followed a group of teens who learned they had developed superhuman powers and then learned how to use them. However, as is the case with the genre, not all the teens wanted to use the powers for good and when one of them went evil, it was up to his friends to try to stop him. The movie was such a success that Fox hired director Josh Trank to reboot The Fantastic Four.





 7  Moana (2016) 
Starring Auliʻi Cravalho
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
Moana is a Disney Princess movie that took things in a fresh and unique direction. Moana never needed a man to come and save her, as she instead set out to save her home when a mysterious ooze started to destroy all signs of life on her island. She did find a man in Maui, the demigod, but he was more of a hindrance than a help and she had to force him to accompany her so that she could deal with the threat head-on thanks to her newfound control of water. While the movie didn&#39;t win the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it was still a massive success, making $682 million at the box office (via Box Office Mojo) and sitting at 95% on Rotten Tomatoes.





 6  Kiki’s Delivery Service (1989) 
Starring Fuka Koshiba
        

Stream on Max
Anyone who has seen a film from the famous Studio Ghibli knows that their films manage to capture a certain whimsy that one associates with both childhood and young adulthood. There’s a certain manic energy to Kiki’s Delivery Service, and there’s no question that the young witch Kiki is an entrancing hero. The movie has Kiki as a 13-year-old who leaves home, flying away on her broomstick looking for a place to live. Directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, this is one of the movies about kids with powers that are more about finding independence and coming of age than it is about fighting any villain.





 5  Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018) 
Starring Shameik Moore &amp; Hailee Steinfeld
        

 Watch on Fubo 

Peter Parker was an early example of kids with powers in other mediums, as he first became Spider-Man while still in high school at the age of fifteen, though 2018&#39;s Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse focused on another teen hero with abilities. While the adult Spider-Man played a large role in the movie, Into The Spider-Verse focused on young Miles Morales as he was bitten by a spider and forced into his new role as Spider-Man after the death of his universe&#39;s Spider-Man. The movie wowed audiences with cutting-edge animation and won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.





 4  Let The Right One In (2008) 
Starring Kåre Hedebrant &amp; Lina Leandersson
        

Stream on Prime Video
Let the Right One In continued the idea of a vampire luring in someone much younger to become their companion. However, unlike movies like Twilight, where it is an older male vampire wooing a teenage girl, Let the Right One In turns that trope on its head. In this one, it is the young girl who is the actual ancient vampire, changed while she was a child and never aging. This means she needed someone to care for her and find her food (i.e. human victims). With her current partner aging out, she sets her sights on a young boy and becomes friends with him, soon taking him as her next companion. The movie was a BAFTA nominee and remains one of the best vampire movies ever made.





 3  Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse (2023) 
Starring Shameik Moore &amp; Hailee Steinfeld


 







Stream on Netflix
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse kept the spirit and heart of the first movie and added even more impressive animation to help it exceed even the high expectations of the first movie&#39;s fans. The release remains one of the stronger movies about kids with powers, as Miles is still a young teen who finds the weight of the world on his shoulders when the Spider-powered heroes from other universes set out to stop a cataclysmic event from happening, one that Miles finds himself on the opposite side of the fight in. The film was, like its predecessor, met with widespread acclaim and anticipation is high for the third installment.





 2  The Incredibles (2004) 
Starring Sarah Vowell &amp; Spencer Fox
        

Stream on Disney&#43;
Pixar is one of those animation studios that seems to know the exact way to produce a film that manages to be both exciting and full of heart at the same time, and the result is a film like The Incredibles. It’s impossible not to love the titular family with superpowers who are still trying to live a traditional suburban life in post-superhero America. When the story starts, superheroes were outlawed after numerous lawsuits and two of the greatest in history are now raising their kids, who have superhero powers they have to keep hidden as well. The kids remain as important as their parents in both movies, with the first considered one of Pixar&#39;s best movies.





 1  Harry Potter (2001-2011) 
Starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, &amp; Emma Watson


 







Stream on Max
Harry Potter became the most successful young adult book franchise in the history of publishing. It’s equally unsurprising that the film franchise based on Harry Potter has also been enormously successful, making over $7.7 billion worldwide at the box office. The story is that of the Boy Wizard, expected to defeat one of the most dangerous wizards in history, Lord Voldemort. However, what makes the Harry Potter movies so popular are the kids in the lead, with the three close friends, their friends, and allies all working together to make these the best movies about kids with powers ever made. A series is coming soon to Max to retell the story.
