## Literature Review

Filming for How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s live-action movie adaptation has begun, getting announced with a behind-the-scenes photo from Dean DeBlois.




How to Train Your Dragon director Dean DeBlois announces the filming of the live-action remake with a behind-the-scenes photo. The DreamWorks franchise based on a book series of the same name will be rebooted in live-action, with DeBlois returning after directing the original animated trilogy. The film is expected to revisit the plot of the 2010 original in a new format.




Now, DeBlois has taken to Instagram, announcing that How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s live-action remake has started filming.


 

The director poses with a clapperboard featuring what seems to be a logo for the movie. The background also appears to be a physical set for the village Berk, as featured in the original movies.

The upcoming How to Train Your Dragon remake will see DeBloise return to the director&#39;s chair, just as Gerard Butler will be coming back as Stoick. Other cast members include Mas Thames (The Black Phone) as Hiccup and Nico Parker (The Last of Us) as Astrid. Gobber the Belch has also been cast, with comedian Nick Frost (Hot Fuzz) taking up the role in a live-action form.




While the story of the live-action adaptation is unclear, the movie will likely be a remix of the 2010 movie, with just enough changes to make it stand out. The biggest challenge of How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s remake will be offering a unique take on the trilogy, which only ended in 2019. Given how close in time the remake will be arriving, it will have to encapsulate the themes of the original in a unique yet familiar way.

With DeBlois behind the remake, though, it&#39;s likely the live-action rendition will maintain the same heart as the original animated features. Since it will be DreamWorks&#39; first live-action remake, How to Train Your Dragon could establish a new trend for the animation studio&#39;s projects. However, it remains to be seen how the movie will feel compared to the original until it arrives next year.



How to Train Your Dragon&#39;s live-action remake arrives in theaters on June 13, 2025.
