## Literature Review
While the Monsterverse&#39;s Godzilla vs. Kong was a huge hit, one monster movie provided the perfect blueprint for this franchise years earlier.

While the MonsterVerse is best known for 2021’s action-packed grudge match Godzilla vs. Kong, the best unofficial entry in the series arrived a lot earlier. The MonsterVerse is a complicated beast. Some of its outings are relatively self-serious and grounded, like 2014’s gritty and surprisingly solemn Godzilla. Others, like 2017’s Kong: Skull Island and 2021’s Godzilla vs. Kong, are much more playful and self-aware. Still, others uneasily straddle the line between these two approaches, as seen in 2019’s Godzilla: King of the Monsters. However, all of the franchise’s outings have attempted to bring classic Kaiju movie thrills to Western audiences with plots that focus on both monsters and human drama.
