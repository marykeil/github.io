## Literature Review

Carey Mulligan&#39;s brief but unforgettable performance as Elspeth&#39;s friend Pamela gave Saltburn one of its greatest characters. What was her fate?






This article contains references to suicide and murder.







Carey Mulligan’s brief but unforgettable performance as Elspeth’s clingy friend Pamela gave Saltburn one of its most compelling characters, but her fate is left somewhat ambiguous. Set in early-‘00s England, Saltburn stars Barry Keoghan as middle-class Oxford student Oliver Quick, who becomes infatuated with a rich kid named Felix Catton, played by Jacob Elordi. Over the summer break, Oliver goes to stay with Felix’s absurdly wealthy family at their massive estate – the titular Saltburn – and learns some harsh truths about the one percent. During his stay, Oliver meets a handful of colorful characters in this eccentric family’s orbit – and that includes Pamela.

Saltburn is the second feature film written and directed by Emerald Fennell. Mulligan’s supporting role as Pamela marks a reunion with Fennell after playing the lead role in her directorial debut, Promising Young Woman. Mulligan’s role in the Saltburn cast isn’t as prominent as her role in Promising Young Woman, but the character is just as memorable. When Oliver arrives at Saltburn, Pamela is already there. But she doesn’t stay as long as him, and her fate is left somewhat uncertain. The specifics are vague, and it’s possible to speculate, but one thing is clear about what happened to this character: it’s really, really dark.




                  Saltburn Ending Explained: What Really Happened To Felix   The ending of Emerald Fennell&#39;s Saltburn is built on a web of lies spun by Oliver Quick and reveals the twisted layers of his obsession with Felix.   


 Who Carey Mulligan&#39;s Pamela Was &amp; How She Fit Into The Catton Family 
          

When Oliver arrives at Saltburn, he’s introduced to the rest of Felix’s family, the Cattons, and Pamela, the woman who’s been staying at the house. Pamela is a good friend of Felix’s mother, Elspeth, and she’s hiding out at Saltburn to avoid her dangerous ex-boyfriend. It’s unclear exactly how long she’s been staying at Saltburn, but she seems comfortable enough to have been there for at least a few months. Elspeth insists that Saltburn’s visitors are welcome to stay for as long as they want, but she also heavily insinuates that Pamela has outstayed her welcome and she’d like her to leave.




Elspeth often refers to her as “Poor Dear Pamela,” which points to how she views their friendship. Much like Oliver, Pamela is a less fortunate person that a member of the Catton family has taken pity on and brought to the estate as a sort of lost puppy. Felix invited Oliver to visit Saltburn as his lower-class pet, showing him how the other 99 percent lives, and Elspeth views Pamela with a similar curiosity. They bring these people to the estate and allow them to share their luxuries so they can feel like good-hearted, compassionate people without having to actually do anything good.



 Pamela Was Seemingly Killed By The Man She Was Hiding From In Saltburn 
She was on the run from a dangerous Russian billionaire
          

A short while after Oliver arrives at Saltburn, Pamela leaves to find a place of her own. It’s not quite clear how long she’d been at Saltburn or how long she waited to leave after Oliver’s arrival. The timeline of Saltburn is a little murky, because Oliver is an unreliable narrator who can’t necessarily be trusted to tell the story exactly as it happened. Sometimes, the film settles on a single day for a while, and sometimes, it skips ahead a few months in a fleeting montage. Some time after Pamela leaves Saltburn, the Cattons learn that she’s died under mysterious circumstances.




The death is ruled an apparent suicide, but it’s suggested that Pamela’s death is a murder that was staged to look like a suicide. Elspeth had mentioned that Pamela was staying with them because she was hiding from a Russian billionaire she met in rehab. It’s also mentioned that this billionaire’s business associates were also being killed in staged suicides (falling out of windows, etc.). The Cattons never directly explain Pamela’s cause of death, but it’s likely due to this situation with the murderous Russian billionaire after Elspeth pretty much encouraged Pamela to leave Saltburn because she was becoming an inconvenience.



 The Catton Family&#39;s Response To Pamela&#39;s Death Confirmed Their True Nature To Oliver 
They really didn&#39;t care about the lost souls they invited in
         

Pamela’s subplot in Saltburn acts as a cautionary tale for Oliver. The fact that the Cattons nudged Pamela out of their house, knowing full well that she had a murderer on her tail, and didn’t care very much when she turned up dead, confirmed to Oliver that this family really didn’t care about these lost souls they were bringing in. People like Pamela and Oliver are a novelty to the Cattons. Pamela is to Elspeth what Oliver is to Felix, so understanding how little care they really had for her death undoubtedly contributed to Oliver setting his diabolical plan into motion.
