## Literature Review

Lucasfilm has confirmed that Star Wars: New Jedi Order is still in development, despite rumors claiming the movie was delayed indefinitely.




Rumors have recently been circulating in the Star Wars fandom that Rey&#39;s upcoming movie, Star Wars: New Jedi Order, was delayed indefinitely, but Lucasfilm has confirmed that the movie is still in active development. Daisy Ridley will reprise her role as Rey, following her efforts to reestablish a Jedi Order in the aftermath of the fall of the First Order and the death of Emperor Palpatine. Rey&#39;s return in New Jedi Order hasn&#39;t received many updates recently, but Lucasfilm confirmed the movie is still in the early stages of development and remains on the list of upcoming Star Wars movies.




                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   

According to Germain Lussier of Gizmodo, the movie&#39;s writer, Steven Knight, is still revising his script and Lucasfilm is waiting on the latest draft. The confusion over Rey&#39;s next installment in the franchise came from Lucasfilm&#39;s recent announcement that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie would be the next movie from the studio, replacing New Jedi Order in the franchise&#39;s release schedule. New Jedi Order has also become controversial recently for absurd reasons, which could have increased the popularity of this unfounded rumor - including misinformation surrounding director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s &#34;make men feel uncomfortable&#34; comment.

The rumor was that Knight was frustrated by Lucasfim&#39;s feedback during the revision process of his script and had walked away from the project, but this isn&#39;t true. As pointed out by Lussier, script revisions are a healthy and natural part of the moviemaking process. Instead, Knight will continue to work with the notes of his fellow creative team members, writing draft after draft until New Jedi Order is ready to film.





 


 When Will We Hear More News About Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order Movie? 
          

This most recent confirmation of the movie&#39;s development from Lucasfilm could signal that more news is on the horizon. Knight may soon finish his final draft, which Ridley has called &#34;a really cool way of taking the story on.&#34; The actress has recently been speaking about the movie more frequently during her press tours for another movie, and this - along with Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s words earlier this year - seem to hint that New Jedi Order may soon begin production. Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s phrasing in her update implied that production was moving along, and as the movie develops, more news is sure to come.






Star Wars: New Jedi Order does not currently have a set release date, though it is expected to be the franchise&#39;s next theatrical release after The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.




Despite rumors to the contrary, New Jedi Order has not been indefinitely delayed. Rey&#39;s new movie is still being produced, and the script is actively being written. While the movie has been plagued by misguided controversy that could continue, as of now, it is still on track for release sometime in the near future. Rey will be an important player in the galaxy far, far away as she begins to rebuild the Jedi Order in New Jedi Order.
