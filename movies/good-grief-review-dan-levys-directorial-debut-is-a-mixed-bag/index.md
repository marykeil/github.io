## Literature Review

What results in Good Grief isn&#39;t exactly original or revelatory, but it does hold moments of genuine heart, partially because of the excellent cast.




After conquering television with his Emmy-winning series Schitt&#39;s Creek, Dan Levy returns to writing with his first feature, Netflix&#39;s Good Grief. In what is also his directorial debut, he turns to the theme of grief — something most people are, unfortunately, all too familiar with — and examines its effects on a trio of friends. The result isn&#39;t exactly original, nor is it especially revelatory, but it does lead to some moments of genuine heart, partially because of the excellent cast Levy has assembled.




              Good Grief  Good Grief is a comedy-drama film by writer-director Dan Levy, who also stars in the film as protagonist Marc. After Marc&#39;s husband dies suddenly, he and his two best friends head to Paris for some much-needed soul searching - where each of the three is forced to face elements of themselves and their pasts they try to bury away.    Release Date    January 5, 2024     Director    Dan Levy     Cast    Dan Levy , Ruth Negga , Himesh Patel , Luke Evans , Celia Imrie     Rating    R     Runtime    100 Minutes     Genres    Comedy , Drama     Writers    Dan Levy     Studio(s)    Not A Real Production Company , Sister Pictures     Distributor(s)    Netflix      

Like in Schitt&#39;s Creek, Levy also stars, flanked by impressive performers such as Ruth Negga, Himesh Patel, and Luke Evans. From the premise alone, which features Levy&#39;s Marc grappling with the loss of his husband Oliver (Evans), it&#39;s clear the multi-hyphenate has some big emotional aspirations for Good Grief. In some ways, though, it follows a predictable path, even when it seeks to throw in some curveballs regarding Oliver and Marc&#39;s marriage. The movie begins on a melodramatic note, with a picture-perfect Christmas party (complete with a sing-along among the guests) hosted by Oliver and Marc at their gorgeous London home that takes a devastating turn. Oliver is a famous author and must leave early for a book signing in Paris, but his cab doesn&#39;t get very far before it&#39;s caught in a crash.




                  Good Grief Cast &amp; Character Guide – Who Else Stars In Dan Levy&#39;s Netflix Rom-Com   Not only did Dan Levy write and direct Netflix’s Good Grief, but the actor is also starring in the rom-com alongside a few notable names.   


 Good Grief Gets Off To An Awkward Start 

 

The suddenness of Oliver&#39;s death is no doubt meant to shock, but instead it feels purposely heartbreaking, written to extract the maximum amount of sympathy from us. Marc&#39;s immediate grief is believable and palpable, but the film races through the first year after Oliver&#39;s death. Not long after Marc is forced to confront the demands of Oliver&#39;s publisher only one month after his death, Levy&#39;s script jumps ahead to the summer, when Marc&#39;s flighty best friend Sophie (Negga) is signing him up for a dating app. Swiftly thereafter, it&#39;s Christmas again, and Marc is faced with an uncomfortable revelation about Oliver. To say more would be a spoiler, but the twist isn&#39;t too surprising when it comes to this kind of story about the sudden loss of a spouse.




Nevertheless, it prompts Marc to invite Sophie and their lovelorn pal Thomas (Patel), the third part of the central trio, on a weekend trip to Paris. It&#39;s in the Paris stretch that Good Grief settles into a more stable rhythm and tone, and that Levy finally takes the chance to explore his characters. Up until then, Sophie&#39;s refusal to be pinned down is often mentioned but then hastily glossed over (intentionally, not because of poor writing), and Thomas&#39; yearning for true love is his only defining trait outside his loyalty to Marc. However, the Paris trip proves to be enlightening for all of them and leads to some fierce confrontations within the friend group.



 Good Grief&#39;s Performances Are A Highlight

As the grieving Marc (who is also grappling with the prior loss of his mother), Levy perfectly portrays the confusing mix of rage, heartbreak, and occasional joy he feels as he comes to terms with Oliver&#39;s death. Marc occasionally falls into moments of selfishness, and Levy plays this in such a way that we never feel compelled to turn against him, even as we nod along with Thomas&#39; blistering indictment after a night out in Paris leads to all kinds of issues. Patel gets perhaps the most sympathetic character, and his quiet, unwavering friendship almost suggests Thomas is a pushover; that only makes his eventual outburst so much more refreshing, and Patel truly shines.






Ultimately, Good Grief makes for a solid directorial effort for Levy, though the strength of the movie lies more in the performances than the story being told.




If there is a standout among the main trio, though, it is Negga, whose character dances along the line of being, as she puts it at one point, &#34;a lot.&#34; Negga gets a wonderful, aching monologue during an awkward dinner in Paris that becomes an acting showcase for the Oscar-nominated star. She&#39;s warm and funny and frustrating, and it&#39;s easy to see why Marc and Thomas would remain friends with her. Special credit should also go to Kaitlyn Dever in a cameo as the star of the movies based on Oliver&#39;s books, even if her cringe-inducing eulogy at Oliver&#39;s funeral is representative of Good Grief&#39;s tonal awkwardness.

Ultimately, Good Grief makes for a solid directorial effort for Levy, though the strength of the movie lies more in the performances than the story being told. This isn&#39;t a film that has new things to say about grief, nor does it offer a particularly gripping story for Marc. Levy&#39;s script ambles along at its own, at times uneven, pace, which at least has the pleasant side effect of giving the cast a showcase for their talents. In a way, Marc&#39;s messy path through navigating his grief represents the real experience of it, even if it didn&#39;t resonate as strongly as it could&#39;ve.






Good Grief is now streaming on Netflix. It is 100 minutes long and rated R for language and brief drug use.
