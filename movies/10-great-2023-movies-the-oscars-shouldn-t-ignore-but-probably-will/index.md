# 10 Great 2023 Movies The Oscars Shouldn t Ignore (But Probably Will)


## SUMMARY 


 Genre films struggle to gain recognition from the Academy, as they often prefer more conventional dramas. 
 Several outstanding films from last year may not receive the level of attention they deserve. 
 Despite being overlooked, films like 
The Boy and the Heron 
and
 The Killer 
deserve consideration for categories beyond their genre.

## Literature Review

Awards season is heating up, but some great movies from 2023 won’t get the attention they deserve from the Academy and will be ignored for Oscars.




The nominations for the 96th Academy Awards will be announced on January 23, but several great films from 2023 will not be present. While Oscar nominations do not affect the quality of a film, it is always a pleasure when great art and artists are awarded and given time to shine. Films like Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Poor Things are among the favorites going into awards season. And while those films deserve the praise they are receiving, several terrific films won&#39;t receive the same level of attention.
Genre films are often a tougher sell for the Academy, as they prefer to reward more conventional dramas — but many of the best movies of 2023 broke the mold of what an Oscar movie should be. Releasing earlier in the year can also prove a disadvantage, as recency bias will always be a factor, and some of the spring releases may have a harder time getting votes. With an extra crowded field this year, it would be hard to nominate every film that deserves an Oscar. However, these movies shouldn&#39;t go unrecognized by the Academy.
            
 
 Oscars 2024 Best Picture Predictions: Nominees &amp; Winner 
The Best Picture race is already heating up for the 2024 Oscars. Here&#39;s a prediction for the 10 nominees and which movie will be the winner.












 








 10  The Boy And The Heron 
Anything Outside Animated Feature


 







  The Boy and the Heron  


  Release Date    July 14, 2023     Director    Hayao Miyazaki     Cast    Soma Santoki , Masaki Suda , Aimyon , Shōhei Hino , Kô Shibasaki , Takuya Kimura , Yoshino Kimura     Runtime    124 Minutes     Writers    Hayao Miyazaki     Studio(s)    Studio Ghibli    


For a while, it seemed like The Boy and the Heron would be the final film by legendary animator Hayao Miyazaki. While recent comments have thrown that into question, it is still a late masterpiece by one of the best filmmakers of all time. The movie is almost guaranteed a nomination for Best Animated Feature, but The Boy and the Heron deserves a lot more than that. A staggering piece about legacy, grief, and art, The Boy and the Heron should be in serious consideration for Best Picture, Best Score, and Best Director. Sadly, since it is an animated film, it will most likely be limited to that category.





 9  Beau Is Afraid 
Best Lead Actor &amp; Screenplay


 







  Beau Is Afraid  


  Release Date    April 21, 2023     Director    Ari Aster     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Nathan Lane , Patti LuPone , Amy Ryan , Kylie Rogers , Parker Posey , Stephen McKinley Henderson , Hayley Squires     Rating    R     Runtime    179 minutes     Writers    Ari Aster     Studio(s)    A24    


Due to its spring release and divisive reaction, Ari Aster&#39;s Beau Is Afraid has been absent from most awards conversations. Although the film may be a little strange, it is still a technical marvel that deserves recognition. Aster&#39;s screenplay is beyond creative, managing to build tension throughout the film despite its surreal tone. The most impressive part of the movie, however, is Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s dedicated and uncomfortable performance at the center of it. Phoenix did manage to get a Golden Globe nomination in the Comedy/Musical category, but he should also be considered for an Oscar nomination.
Beau is Afraid is now available to stream on Paramount&#43; 






 8  The Killer 
All Categories


 







  The Killer (2023)  


  Release Date    November 10, 2023     Director    David Fincher     Cast    Michael Fassbender , Tilda Swinton , Kerry O&#39;Malley , Charles Parnell , Lacey Dover , Monique Ganderton , Sala Baker     Rating    R     Runtime    118 Minutes     Writers    Andrew Kevin Walker     Story By    Alexis Nolent, Luc Jacamon     Distributor(s)    Netflix    


Netflix is often a major player during awards season. Its massive campaigns, along with the availability of its movies, make it easy for voters to see the films. However, sometimes the lack of a theatrical run hurts a movie&#39;s reputation, and this is the case for David Fincher&#39;s The Killer. On the surface, The Killer is a straightforward revenge film. However, under its cold, calculated exterior is a darkly funny meditation on life in late-stage capitalism. Like most Fincher films, The Killer will be appreciated years after its release. Still, it&#39;s a shame if it&#39;s absent from this year&#39;s Oscars, especially for its immaculate cinematography and sound.
            
 
 Why David Fincher&#39;s The Killer Took 20 Years To Make 
The Killer has been a passion project for David Fincher for almost two decades. This is why it took so long to get the Netflix thriller made.








 7  Ferrari 
Supporting Actress, Director


 







  Ferrari  


  Release Date    December 25, 2023     Director    Adam Driver , Shailene Woodley , Jack O&#39;Connell , Sarah Gadon , Penelope Cruz , Patrick Dempsey     Cast    Michael Mann , Brock Yates     Runtime    130 Minutes     Writers    Troy Kennedy-Martin , Michael Mann , Brock Yates     Distributor(s)    Neon , STXfilms    


Michael Mann made a triumphant return to the big screen with the biopic Ferrari, and while the film seems like a textbook Oscar player, it will likely struggle to get nominations. Unlike Oscar favorite Ford vs. Ferrari, Mann&#39;s look at the life of Enzo Ferrari is not a triumphant underdog story but a dour look at masculinity and grief. The film just isn&#39;t fun or flashy enough to get awards attention, but it is a technical beast, as Mann fires on all cylinders as a director. Penélope Cruz also delivers one of her best performances as Laura Ferrari, which is, sadly, overshadowed by many other supporting performances from 2023.





 6  Priscilla 
Best Actress


 







  Priscilla  


  Release Date    October 1, 2023     Director    Sofia Coppola     Cast    Cailee Spaeny , Jacob Elordi , Dagmara Dominczyk     Runtime    110 Minutes     Writers    Sofia Coppola , Priscilla Presley     Distributor(s)    A24    


Sadly, Sofia Coppola&#39;s Priscilla will always live in the shadow of Baz Lurmahn&#39;s Elvis. Both films are thoughtful explorations of the legacy of Elvis Presley, but while Elvis was one of the most nominated films of last year, Priscilla will most likely be left out of 2024&#39;s ceremony. There is so much to love about Coppola&#39;s marriage drama, but Cailee Spaeny&#39;s central performance as the titular character is one of the most thoughtful and fully realized of 2023. She should be in the conversation not just for the nomination, but for the win.
            
 
 Jacob Elordi&#39;s Elvis In Priscilla Compared To Austin Butler: 7 Biggest Differences &amp; Who&#39;s Better 
Sofia Coppola&#39;s Priscilla and Baz Luhrmann&#39;s Elvis are drastically different takes on the iconic musician, but one had a better lead actor. 








 5  Bottoms 
Best Screenplay


 







  Bottoms  


  Release Date    August 25, 2023     Director    Emma Seligman     Cast    Rachel Sennott , Ayo Edebiri , Havana Rose Liu , Kaia Gerber , Nicholas Galitzine , Dagmara Dominczyk , Marshawn Lynch     Rating    R     Runtime    92 Minutes     Writers    Emma Seligman , Rachel Sennott     Distributor(s)    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer , Warner Bros. Pictures    


Genre films always have a hard time getting Oscar attention, and while there were many thoughtful dramas and historical epics in 2023, no script was as funny or as quotable as Emma Seligman and Rachel Sennott&#39;s Bottoms. The sapphic teen comedy is purposefully absurd and unrealistic, and it&#39;s one of the best studio comedies to come out in years. A movie this silly will always have a hard time breaking through to Academy voters. However, with Best Original Screenplay seeming uncompetitive this year, a nomination for Bottoms would be a well-deserved recognition of some of the funniest women working in Hollywood.
Bottoms is now on Prime Video 






 4  Are You There God? It&#39;s Me, Margaret 
Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay


 







  Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret  


  Release Date    April 28, 2023     Director    Kelly Fremon Craig     Cast    Rachel McAdams , Abby Ryder Fortson , Elle Graham , Benny Safdie , Kathy Bates     Rating    Not Yet Rated    


One of the most underrated movies of last year was Kelly Fremon Craig&#39;s adaption of the beloved Judy Blume novel Are You There God? It&#39;s Me, Margaret. Focusing on the changing life and desires of a middle school girl, the film tells one of the sweetest stories about growing up — and does so from a much-needed female perspective. Craig&#39;s screenplay perfectly adapts the &#34;unfilmable&#34; book, translating the awkwardness of publicity to the big screen. Rachel McAdams steals the show as Margaret&#39;s mother, turning her into a three-dimensional character in a performance that deserves recognition from the Academy but likely won&#39;t get it.





 3  John Wick: Chapter 4 
All Tech Categories


 







  John Wick: Chapter 4  


  Release Date    March 24, 2023     Director    Chad Stahelski     Cast    Hiroyuki Sanada , Clancy Brown , Scott Adkins , Keanu Reeves , Ian McShane , Bill Skarsgard , Laurence Fishburne , Rina Sawayama , Donnie Yen , Lance Reddick , Shamier Anderson     Rating    R     Runtime    169 minutes     Writers    Shay Hatten , Michael Finch     Studio(s)    Lionsgate    


It makes sense that the fourth installment in a brutal action franchise wouldn&#39;t be an Oscar frontrunner, but John Wick: Chapter 4 took every element of the series and improved upon it, making it one of the best American action movies of all time. Sadly, the film has already missed out on several categories, as it did not make the shortlists for either Sound or Visual Effects. A cinematography nomination would be very much deserved, but the Academy will most likely go with more conventional picks.





 2  The Iron Claw 
All Categories


 







  The Iron Claw  


  Release Date    December 22, 2023     Director    Sean Durkin     Cast    Zac Efron , Jeremy Allen White , Harris Dickinson , Maura Tierney , Holt McCallany , Lily James     Runtime    132 Minutes    


Everything about Sean Durkin&#39;s sports drama feels like it should be a surefire Oscar favorite. The Iron Claw is an emotional gut punch, with beautiful cinematography, an incredible ensemble of performances, and an ending that won&#39;t leave a dry eye in the house. Unfortunately, its Christmas release, along with a lack of festival appearances, has left The Iron Claw out in the cold, as most categories seemed filled up by the time the movie came out. Hopefully, there is still a chance the film could get some recognition, especially for the knockout performance of Zac Efron.





 1  Asteroid City 
All Categories


 







  Asteroid City  


  Release Date    June 23, 2023     Director    Wes Anderson     Cast    Tom Hanks , Margot Robbie , Scarlett Johansson , Adrien Brody , Jeffrey Wright , Bryan Cranston , Bill Murray , Jeff Goldblum , Edward Norton , Liev Schreiber , Hope Davis , Jason Schwartzman , Steve Carell , Willem Dafoe , Hong Chau     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    104 Minutes     Writers    Wes Anderson , Roman Coppola     Distributor(s)    Focus Features    


Outside The Grand Budapest Hotel, Wes Anderson&#39;s work has been mostly ignored by the Academy, and Asteroid City looks like it will be the director&#39;s latest film to get no love from the Oscars. While Anderson has stuck to his cinematic style and voice, he is constantly improving and pushing the boundaries of what he can do. It often feels as though critics and the industry take Anderson for granted, as Asteroid City has some of the best cinematography, production design, and music of any film released in 2023. However, because it is so in line with what Anderson has done before, it will likely be ignored.
