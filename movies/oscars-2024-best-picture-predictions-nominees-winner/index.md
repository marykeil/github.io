## Literature Review

The Best Picture race is already heating up for the 2024 Oscars. Here&#39;s a prediction for the 10 nominees and which movie will be the winner.




The Oscars 2024 race is heating up, as a growing list of movies hope to compete for a coveted Best Picture nomination with hopes of winning the Academy Awards&#39; top prize. Hollywood&#39;s biggest awards ceremony has undergone significant changes in recent years that have brought in an expanded and more diverse voting body. The effects of this have been seen across the board, but the Best Picture nominees have become more varied in genre and style than before. This has also been aided by the decision to expand the category to always nominate 10 movies, which is perfect for a year like 2024 with several strong contenders.
Predictions for Best Picture have long included a few front-runner titles among the expected 2024 Oscars nominees, such as Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer and Martin Scorsese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon, and that has not changed after their releases. While they might seem like the strongest contenders to earn the biggest Academy Award, awards season is still in its relative infancy, with plenty of jockeying, campaigning, and shrewd tactics sure to factor into the final decision. With that in mind, this list of the 2024 Oscars&#39; Best Picture nominations and predicted winner will be updated as the January 2024 nominations announcement date approaches. Screen Rant&#39;s predicted Best Picture nominees are:
    Movie   Studio   Producers    1   Oppenheimer   Universal   Emma Thomas, Charles Roven, Christopher Nolan    2   Killers of the Flower Moon   Apple Studios   Dan Friedkin, Martin Scorsese, Bradley Thomas, Daniel Lupi    3   Barbie   Warner Bros.   David Heyman, Margot Robbie, Tom Ackerley, Robbie Brenner    4   Poor Things   Searchlight Pictures   Ed Guiney, Andrew Lowe, Yorgos Lanthimos, Emma Stone    5   Maestro   Netflix   Fred Berner, Bradley Cooper, Amy Durning, Kristie Macosko Krieger, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg    6   The Holdovers   Focus Features   Mark Johnson, Bill Block, David Hemingson    7   The Zone of Interest   A24   Ewa Puszczynska, James Wilson    8   Past Lives   A24   David Hinojosa, Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler    9   American Fiction   Amazon Studios/MGM   Ben LeClair, Nikos Karamigios, Cord Jefferson, Jermaine Johnson    10   May December   Netflix   Jessica Elbaum, Will Ferrell, Christine Vachon, Pamela Koffler, Natalie Portman, Sophie Mas, Grant S. Johnson, Tyler W. Konney    
Past Lives returns to the predicted top 10, knocking out Origin 

The list of predicted Best Picture nominees at the 2024 Oscars is bound to change, as more movies are released and the positioning of them in the eyes of the Academy&#39;s voting body switches. That means several other movies should still be considered contenders to earn nominations if they have an incredibly strong reception or re-appraisals of previously released movies take place. Other potential movies that could receive Best Picture nominations include:
  Movie   Studio   Producer    Origin   Neon   Ava DuVernay, Paul Garnes    The Color Purple   Warner Bros.   Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg, Scott Sanders, Quincy Jones    Anatomy of a Fall   Neon   Marie-Ange Luciani, David Thion    The Iron Claw   A24   Tessa Ross, Derrin Schlesinger, Juliette Howell, Angus Lamont    Napoleon   Apple Studios   Ridley Scott, Kevin J. Walsh, Mark Huffam, Joaquin Phoenix    Ferrari   Neon   Michael Mann, P.J. Van Sandwijk, Marie Savare, John Lesher, Thomas Hayslip, John Friedberg, Andrea Iervolino, Monika Bacardi, Gareth West, Lars Sylvest, Thorsten Schumacher, Laura Rister    The Killer   Netflix   Ceán Chaffin    Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse   Sony   Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Amy Pascal, Avi Arad, Christina Steinberg    Saltburn   Amazon Studios/MGM   Emerald Fennell, Josey McNamara, Tom Ackerley, Margot Robbie    Air   Amazon Studios   David Ellison, Jesse Sisgold, Jon Weinbach, Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Madison Ainley, Jeff Robinov, Peter Guber, Jason Michael Berman    Priscilla   A24   Sofia Coppola, Youree Henley, Lorenzo Mieli    All of Us Strangers   Searchlight Pictures   Graham Broadbent, Pete Czernin, Sarah Harvey    Asteroid City   Searchlight Pictures   Wes Anderson, Steven Rales, Jeremy Dawson    The Boys in the Boat   Amazon Studios/MGM   Grant Heslov, George Clooney

/ 10 




  Release Date    December 1, 2023     Director    Todd Haynes     Cast    Natalie Portman , Julianne Moore , Charles Melton     Distributor(s)    Netflix    


Netflix has a contender for Best Picture it appears in Todd Haynes&#39; movie May December. The film started to gain recognition following its debut at the Cannes Film Festival, which is when Netflix came aboard to distribute the drama. Natalie Portman stars as an actress researching a woman, played by Julianne Moore, who she is about to play in a movie. The meta-movie story could hit well with the Academy just as it has with critics at large. This would be the first Best Picture Oscar nomination for any movie Todd Haynes has directed. Its case looks stronger after a Golden Globes Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy nomination.

Even though the ceremonies are different, there&#39;s no doubt that the 2024 Golden Globes nominations will have a big impact on the upcoming Oscars race.








 9  American Fiction 
        

  American Fiction

/ 10 




  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Cord Jefferson     Cast    Jeffrey Wright , Tracee Ellis Ross , John Ortiz , erika alexander , Leslie Uggams , Adam Brody​ , Keith David , Issa Rae , Sterling K. Brown     Distributor(s)    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer    


Amazon Studios and MGM have hope of hearing American Fiction earn a Best Picture Oscar nomination in 2024 based on current trends. The directorial debut of Cord Jefferson looks to be among the biggest crowd-pleasers of the year, one that is only bolstered by the strong performances of Jeffrey Wright and Sterling K. Brown. Its most notable awards season victory so far is winning the People&#39;s Choice Award at TIFF following its premiere. The praise and adoration for American Fiction has only grown since then, including earning a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy.





 8  Past Lives 
        

  Past Lives  


  Release Date    January 21, 2023     Director    Celine Song     Cast    Greta Lee , Teo Yoo , John Magaro    


Past Lives has been pinpointed as a likely 2024 Oscars contender since before 2023&#39;s ceremony even took place. The emotional romantic drama had its debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2023, which is where the first wave of rave reviews came from. The movie had a slow rollout as it was taken to many other film festivals ahead of its June theatrical release. Past Lives is among the best-reviewed movies of 2023, and the 98% Rotten Tomatoes score has started bringing in some recognition ahead of the Oscars, including a Best Motion Picture - Drama nomination from the Golden Globes.





 7  The Zone of Interest 
        

Director: Jonathan Glazer
Cast: Christian Friedel, Sandra Hüller
The return of Jonathan Glazer over a decade after his last movie has helped position The Zone of Interest firmly in the Best Picture race. The historical drama focused on an Auschwitz commandant starting a life near a concentration camp has been heralded by critics for tackling difficult subjects and re-examining horrific events. The Zone of Interest had its world premiere at Cannes, where it lost the Palme d&#39;Or to Anatomy of a Fall, but continued to earn high praise at subsequent showings at Telluride and the Toronto International Film Festival. The fact that it earned a Golden Globes nomination for Best Motion Picture - Drama bolsters its chances.





 6  The Holdovers 
        

  The Holdovers

/ 10 




  Release Date    November 10, 2023     Director    Alexander Payne     Cast    Paul Giamatti , Da&#39;Vine Joy Randolph , Dominic Sessa , Carrie Preston     Distributor(s)    Focus Features    


The Holdovers is heading toward a Best Picture Oscars nomination in 2024 barring any major setbacks it seems. Alexander Payne is no stranger to such potential success, as he delivered his first Best Picture nominee in 2012 with The Descendants. He has also won two Oscars for his screenplays, and The Holdovers looks to be a contender for that award in 2024, along with Paul Giamatti thought of as in the running for a Best Actor nomination too. From the initial reviews following the movie&#39;s debut at Telluride to its Golden Globes nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, The Holdovers is contending.





 5  Maestro 
        

  Maestro

/ 10 




  Release Date    December 20, 2023     Director    Bradley Cooper     Cast    Bradley Cooper , Carey Mulligan , Maya Hawke , Sarah Silverman , Matt Bomer     Distributor(s)    Netflix    


Five years after A Star Is Born received a Best Picture nomination, Bradley Cooper&#39;s biopic about the legendary composer Leonard Bernstein is poised to repeat the awards success of his directorial debut - as long as Maestro&#39;s controversy does not stop it. While it was always thought to be an awards contender, Maestro&#39;s likelihood of receiving a Best Picture nomination at the 2024 Oscars increased with its debut at the Venice International Film Festival, where it was nominated for the top prize, the Golden Lion. Now that Bradley Cooper&#39;s movie is out and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Motion Picture - Drama, its position has strengthened.

 4  Poor Things 
        

  Poor Things

/ 10 




  Release Date    September 8, 2023     Director    Yorgos Lanthimos     Cast    Emma Stone , Willem Dafoe , Mark Ruffalo , Ramy Youssef , Jerrod Carmichael , Christopher Abbott     Distributor(s)    Searchlight Pictures    


Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone have joined forces again to create one of the biggest contenders to win the 2024 Oscars&#39; Best Picture. Following their shared success with The Favourite in 2018, Poor Things has been lauded for its creativity and uniqueness ever since it premiered at Venice, where it won the prestigious Golden Lion award. The result greatly increased the chance of a nomination, and possibly even a win, for Best Picture. Recent Golden Lion winners that became Best Picture winners include Nomadland and The Shape of Water. Adding a Golden Globes nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy should help too.





 3  Barbie 
        

  Barbie

/ 10 




  Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Greta Gerwig     Cast    Margot Robbie , Ryan Gosling , Simu Liu , Ariana Greenblatt , Helen Mirren , Nicola Coughlan , John Cena , Will Ferrell , Ritu Arya , Michael Cera , America Ferrera , Alexandra Shipp , Kate McKinnon     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


The overall success of Barbie is expected to translate to a 2024 Oscars nomination for Best Picture. The movie surpassed all box office expectations on its way to becoming the biggest movie of the year, and it now is on track to continue Greta Gerwig&#39;s Oscars streak. Her previous two movies, Little Women and Lady Bird, both received Best Picture nominations under the older format. The support for Barbie&#39;s 2024 Oscars campaign can be seen with its various love from critics circles to dominating the 2024 Golden Globes nominations, where it tied for the second most nominations by a single film in history.





 2  Killers of the Flower Moon 
        

  Killers of the Flower Moon  


  Director    Martin Scorsese     Cast    Leonardo DiCaprio , Louis Cancelmi , Jillian Dion , Scott Shepherd , Jesse Plemons , JaNae Collins , Robert De Niro , Jason Isbell , Cara Jade Myers , Lily Gladstone     Studio(s)    Paramount Pictures     Distributor(s)    Apple , Paramount Pictures    


Martin Scorsese has one of the strongest Best Picture contenders for the 2024 Oscars with Killers of the Flower Moon. Its premiere at Cannes led to a rapturous response heralding the true story as the latest Scorsese masterpiece, bringing all three of its leads to be viewed as locks for their own Oscar nominations. Martin Scorsese&#39;s Oscars nomination history is significant, as he&#39;s had nine movies nominated in the biggest category, but only The Departed won. The career legacy angle and a Golden Globes Best Motion Picture - Drama nomination could be used to the movie&#39;s benefit, giving Killers of the Flower Moon a strong narrative to win.





 1  Oppenheimer (Winner) 
        

  Oppenheimer  
9 
/ 10 




  Release Date    July 21, 2023     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Cillian Murphy , Emily Blunt , Matt Damon , Robert Downey Jr. , Rami Malek , Florence Pugh     Distributor(s)    Universal Pictures    


Oppenheimer winning Best Picture at the 2024 Oscars appears to be the most likely outcome at this point. Christopher Nolan&#39;s biopic about J. Robert Oppenheimer is arguably his best movie to date. Like Scorsese, a Nolan movie has never won Best Picture, but his movies have only received nominations twice before. Oppenheimer is guaranteed to at least be among the list of nominees announced in January 2024. Its case to win the award comes through the overall acclaim and success of the movie, which now includes a Best Motion Picture - Drama nomination from the Golden Globes.
