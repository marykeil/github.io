## Literature Review

Leonardo DiCaprio joins Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s next movie alongside Sean Penn and Regina Hall with other early details reportedly revealed.




Leonardo DiCaprio joins Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s next movie with other early details reportedly revealed. Anderson is one of the most acclaimed filmmakers alive and the auteur behind Boogie Nights, Magnolia, There Will Be Blood, The Master, and Phantom Thread, with his most recent film being 2021&#39;s Licorice Pizza. Similarly, DiCaprio is one of the most distinguished actors currently working, with his most recent performance coming in Martin Scorsese&#39;s Killers of the Flower Moon.




According to Deadline, DiCaprio has officially joined writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s next movie alongside fellow Oscar winner Sean Penn and Regina Hall. The film is currently untitled and the logline is being kept under wraps, though it is set to shoot this year in California. Sources suggest the film will have a contemporary setting, which is unusual for Anderson. It&#39;s also being called the &#34;most commercial&#34; movie Anderson has ever attempted and carries a considerable budget.



Anderson&#39;s last film with a contemporary setting was 2002&#39;s Punch-Drunk Love, and his biggest budget was $40 million for Licorice Pizza.





 A Leonardo DiCaprio &amp; Paul Thomas Anderson Collaboration Is Long Overdue 
          

DiCaprio and Anderson have never worked together before, and the pairing would unite a highly-regarded director and actor. Over his illustrious career, DiCaprio has largely worked with only great directors, including Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron. Currently, DiCaprio is fresh off his sixth collaboration with Scorsese, portraying Ernest Burkhart in Killers of the Flower Moon, and is a virtual lock for his seventh Academy Award nomination for acting.




                  Every Leonardo DiCaprio Movie Ranked From Worst to Best   From Titanic to The Revenant and beyond, Leonardo DiCpario is one of the biggest movie stars working, but how do his films rank from worst to best?   

Similarly, Anderson regularly collaborates with great actors, including the now-retired Daniel Day-Lewis, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Joaquin Phoenix. Anderson is one of the few acclaimed auteurs left that DiCaprio hasn&#39;t worked with, and the two even expressed interest in a collaboration in the past. It will now finally come to fruition, and based on the report, it could be Anderson&#39;s biggest movie yet.

Though Anderson&#39;s films are frequently acclaimed by critics and cinephiles, they tend to struggle at the box office, with many of them failing to recoup their budgets. By taking a more &#34;commercial&#34; approach, while still maintaining his signature style,  Anderson&#39;s upcoming collaboration with DiCaprio could produce the director&#39;s biggest movie yet.
