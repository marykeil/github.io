# The Mandalorian Season 2 s Attack Of The Clones Parallel Means Much More Than You Think


## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian TV show rewrites the representation of the Tuskens, depicting them as allies of the main character instead of brutal torturers, challenging the unfair treatment they received in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.   The scenes in The Mandalorian parallel Anakin&#39;s journey in Attack of the Clones, with both characters visiting the Tuskens in a different context. However, The Mandalorian showcases a more positive and collaborative relationship between Din Djarin and the Tuskens.   The Mandalorian successfully reverses the negative portrayal of the Tuskens in Attack of the Clones, making them more complex and &#39;human,&#39; along with other Star Wars projects like the Kenobi novel and The Book of Boba Fett. This marks a significant shift in the representation of the Tuskens within the franchise.

## Literature Review

One Attack of the Clones parallel in The Mandalorian season 2 depicts one Star Wars group in a vastly different light, vitally improving their legacy.




In the Star Wars Disney&#43; TV show The Mandalorian, the representation of the Tuskens on Tatooine sharply contrasts the prior representation of the Tuskens in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones when Anakin Skywalker slaughters them. Attack of the Clones paints the Tuskens in a brutal light, depicting them as captors and torturers when Anakin comes across his dying mother at one of their camps. After Anakin kills them for what they did to his mother, he even likens them to &#34;animals&#34; in his anger, leaving a dark stain on the legacy of the Tuskens as a whole.




Despite this depiction of the Tuskens as faceless, brutal torturers in the prequel Star Wars trilogy, The Mandalorian sees the Tuskens as Din Djarin&#39;s allies, helping the Mandalorian to defeat a krayt dragon. This shift in their representation is a fascinating and monumental one; it takes an entire Star Wars race and rewrites them and their culture. That Din would seek their assistance is a complete reversal of the Tuskens&#39; nature in Attack of the Clones, and it suggests that the Star Wars franchise is beginning to explore some of its flaws of the past, including its perhaps unfair treatment of the Tuskens - and The Mandalorian culminates this with its Attack of the Clones parallel.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Din Djarin&#39;s Ride Through The Dune Sea Parallels Anakin&#39;s 
          




The Mandalorian signals its connection to this massacre in Attack of the Clones by mirroring the scene in which Anakin is seen furiously driving a speeder on Tatooine in an effort to track down and rescue his mother. In The Mandalorian, Din Djarin similarly rides a speederbike to the Tuskens. The vehicle is not the only parallel, though; in The Mandalorian, Din visits a Tusken camp at night, reminiscent of Anakin stopping to get directions from Jawas in Attack of the Clones, although in a very different context. The scenes also differ, critically, in the settings of their travels. While Anakin travels at night, Din travels during the day, expressing very different moods about the terms of their travel.



 These Scenes Paint Two Different Pictures Of The Tuskens 
         

In Attack of the Clones, the Tuskens are little more than a plot device to trigger Anakin&#39;s fall to the dark side by murdering his mother, which fills him with hate and instills in him a fear of loss that catapults the Chosen One toward becoming Darth Vader. Still, it seems they captured Shmi with no known motive, making them seem as if they crave cruelty for no good reason. Anakin slaughters them all for this; he explicitly says he killed the men, women, and children when he confesses his actions to PadmÃ©. Despite that &#34;confession,&#34; Anakin is not remotely apologetic. In The Mandalorian, the representation of the Tuskens is very different, if not the complete opposite.




In The Mandalorian season 2, episode 1 &#34;Chapter 9: The Marshal,&#34; Din Djarin works alongside the Tuskens to fight the krayt dragon. Although they still must negotiate with the Tuskens to prevent them from seeking revenge on the town for a previous conflict, which still somewhat ties into their history of violence, this kind of collaboration would have been unfathomable based on their representation in Attack of the Clones alone. Ultimately, their attack on the dragon is successful, in large part because of the efforts of the Tuskens, who even gifts Din Djarin and Grogu a hefty chunk of dragon meat to take with them. This presents them in a much more positive light as compared to Star Wars&#39; past.



Din Djarin is, so far, the only character other than the Tuskens themselves who has demonstrated the ability to communicate with them in their own tongue, both verbally and with sign language - further proving the strong allyship the Tuskens have made with the Mandalorian.






 The Mandalorian Perfectly Reverses Attack Of The Clones&#39; Tusken Treatment 
          




Attack of the Clones presents the Tuskens as explicitly subhuman, particularly in the line in which Anakin refers to them as &#34;animals.&#34; Even beyond that cruel phrasing by Anakin - and worse still, his genocide of the Tuskens - it&#39;s difficult not to perceive them in the same way given what they do to Shmi. It isn&#39;t clear what exactly her torture entailed, although imagination can often be even worse than reality, but she is tied up, hung up, clearly cut and injured, and she seems to be delirious, likely starved and dying of thirst. This torture does make the Tuskens seem to lack basic humanity, even if Anakin&#39;s brutality remains horrifying.

The Mandalorian reverses this representation of the Tusken Raiders, making them more complicated and &#39;human.&#39; This is not the first Star Wars reversal of the idea that Tuskens are nothing more than violent monsters. Although taking place in Legends rather than canon, the Kenobi novel, which details Obi-Wan&#39;s time on Tatooine after the fall of the Jedi, explores the Tuskens in a more complex way by showing their family relationships and dynamics.




The Book of Boba Fett also spends a considerable amount of time developing the Tuskens within Boba&#39;s tribe, especially as the ones who saved him from the outskirts of the Sarlacc pit. Despite holding him as a prisoner at first, the Tuskens welcomed Boba in once he proved his loyalty and made him one of their own. Of course, Star Wars never really showed Anakin&#39;s slaughter in a positive light; this was essentially his first major step toward Vader, but it&#39;s nice to see a project as major as The Mandalorian walk back the representation of the Tuskens somewhat.
