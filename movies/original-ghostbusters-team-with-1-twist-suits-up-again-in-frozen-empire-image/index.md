## Literature Review

Three members of the original 1984 Ghostbusters team suits up again with one added member in a new image for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. 




The original Ghostbusters crew puts on their suits again in a new image from Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. Ghostbusters was first released in 1984, and featured a leading cast of Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Ernie Hudson. The whole team would reunite in 1989&#39;s Ghostbusters 2, and then again for brief cameos Ghostbusters (2016) and Ghostbusters: Afterlife (though sadly without Ramis, who passed away in 2014, but did have his character Egon resurrected via CGI for Afterlife). Now, Murray, Hudson, and Aykroyd will return to fight ghosts in Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire releasing on March 22.




From Empire, a new image from Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire shows members of the original cast with one twist. In the image, Aykroyd, Murray, and Hudson are again clad in their Ghostbusters attire, but rather than Ramis&#39; Dr. Spengler, another original movie cast member, Annie Potts’ Janine, suits up to join the ghostbusting team. Check out the image below:

          


 What To Expect From Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire 
         

The new Ghosbusters sequels represent the second attempt to remake the franchise for a 21st century audience, the first being the widely-criticized 2016 remake of Ghostbusters. Ghostbusters: Afterlife was a true sequel to the 1980s movies and directed by Jason Reitman, son of original Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman, who steps in as a producer and writer for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire. That film introduced new cast members Carrie Coon, McKenna Grace, and Finn Wolfhard as Spengler&#39;s family living in Oklahoma, and saw them face off against the returning villains Gozer, Zuul, and Vinz Clortho.




Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will see Afterlife&#39;s cast return alongside several of the original cast members, who will also have much larger roles in this outing. The film will return to New York City where a new supernatural threat is covering the city with a deadly freeze. The familiar setting and including the older actors alongside newer stars will allow Frozen Empire to continue following the franchise&#39;s new direction while still retaining the nostalgia for the original movies.

                  Frozen Empire Is Taking Ghostbusters In A Direction It Should&#39;ve Gone Over 3 Decades Ago   Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is taking the franchise in an exciting new direction, and one it really should have gone in over 30 years before.   

As per the new image, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will also expand upon the Ghostbusters lore by expanding on the roles of the older cast members as well. Janine has historically assumed the role of the secretary for the Ghostbusters, who only occasionally busts out the ghoul-fighting garb herself. In the image, Janine’s costume would suggest she&#39;s become a more full-time entry into the main Ghostbusters team. Just how involved she&#39;ll be in the action remains to be seen, but it certainly appears Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will incorporate Janine as Spengler&#39;s replacement in the original line-up as they work in tandem to save NYC with the new generation of Ghostbusters.
