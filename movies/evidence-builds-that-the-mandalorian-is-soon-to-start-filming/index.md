## Literature Review

New social media evidence points towards The Mandalorian beginning production soon - but is it for season 4, or The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie?




New evidence from Star Wars cast and crew suggests The Mandalorian is starting production soon and thus ready to film. Star Wars shocked audiences with its recent announcement of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, which was said to be in development and entering production in 2024. Lucasfilm, however, made no mention of The Mandalorian season 4, which was previously confirmed to be fully written and ready to enter production before the Hollywood strikes. Now, new evidence suggests that Din Djarin&#39;s and Grogu&#39;s next chapter of The Mandalorian may be starting sooner than expected.




                  The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   After The Mandalorian season 3’s conclusion in 2023, the story of The Mandalorian season 4 is shaping up to be one of the show’s biggest yet.   

A variety of cast and crew members have started to share social media hints towards production on The Mandalorian starting soon. Maria Sandoval, a hair designer for The Mandalorian in addition to The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka, has recently shared her equipment all packed up and ready for a trip. In the caption, she writes, &#34;All ready to go……. Where do you think I am off to this time? hint: there WILL be sand!)&#34; She also likes a comment suggesting the destination is Hawai&#39;i, a setting often used for various The Mandalorian planets - including Nevarro and Morak.


 




Actor Simon Kassianides, known for his role in The Mandalorian as Axe Woves, has also recently shared a picture of him suited up as Axe. While this could very well be from the set of The Mandalorian season 3, the post was made very recently, perhaps hinting at what&#39;s to come for his character. Sandoval has also commented on this post, further spreading her own excitement about the future of The Mandalorian.


 


 Is This The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu... Or The Mandalorian Season 4? 
          

It&#39;s clear something related to The Mandalorian is on the brink of filming, but it&#39;s uncertain whether this will be for The Mandalorian season 4 or The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie. While the movie announcement did say it would enter production in 2024, it gave no indication that production would be starting so soon. Additionally, prior to the movie announcement, various unconfirmed reports and rumors insisted The Mandalorian season 4 would be entering production as early as February 2024 - with one Din Djarin actor, Brendan Wayne, also building excitement for season 4.




Lucasfilm is now in a unique situation, as they have yet to give official confirmation as to whether The Mandalorian season 4 is still happening or not, and whether it will come before or after The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie. The movie could end up being the final act of a potential season 4, which may be Star Wars&#39; way of trying something new after The Mandalorian season 3 was met with mixed reviews. Either way, it&#39;s clear The Mandalorian will be starting a new chapter soon, which is very exciting - no matter which project it&#39;s bringing to light.
