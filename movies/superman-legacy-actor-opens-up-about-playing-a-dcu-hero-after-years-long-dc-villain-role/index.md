## Literature Review

One of the first heroes cast for the DCU comments on how playing a hero in Superman: Legacy is different from his fan-favorite past DC villain role.




Anthony Carrigan has opened up about playing Metamorpho in Superman: Legacy. Carrigan will finally play a hero in the DC Universe after having given life to villain Victor Zsasz in the Batman prequel series Gotham. With many heroes in Superman: Legacy&#39;s cast, it stands to be seen how Carrigan&#39;s Metamorpho will stand out among the rest, though the actor has an idea.




Speaking to Rolling Stone, Carrigan talked about what it is like going from villain roles, such as Victor Zsasz in Gotham, to now playing the hero Metamorpho in Superman: Legacy. According to the DCU star, &#34;It’s very refreshing to be playing a superhero, finally.&#34; Carrigan also explained his connection to Metamorpho in James Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy, saying, &#34;With Metamorpho, this is a character who was almost cursed with his powers and thought that he was freakish in terms of what he looked like, and that’s something I could totally relate to because of my alopecia.&#34; Check out the full quote below:


&#34;It’s very refreshing to be playing a superhero, finally, but I don’t think it quite matters to me. My favorite game is to, no matter what I’m given, try to find the opposites. See what’s possible in terms of stretching a character in different directions. With all of my characters, I really try to find some sense of authenticity and truth on what I can relate to about the character. With Metamorpho, this is a character who was almost cursed with his powers and thought that he was freakish in terms of what he looked like and that’s something I could totally relate to because of my alopecia.&#34;





                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   


 What Role Anthony Carrigan’s Metamorpho Could Play In The DCU 
          

Superman: Legacy will focus on David Corenswet&#39;s Man of Steel; however, the DCU&#39;s first movie will also introduce multiple heroes. While Supergirl is rumored to cameo in the film, Gunn has confirmed that Nathan Fillion will play the Green Lantern Guy Gardner, Edi Gathegi will play Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced will be the face of Hawkgirl, and Carrigan will become Metamorpho. That could lead to a few possibilities.

Carrigan&#39;s Metamorpho will play a role alongside the other heroes in one of the two important parts of Superman: Legacy. Gunn previously spoke about how the movie will give equal focus to the Clark Kent and Superman sides of the DCU film&#39;s title character. Metamorpho has been part of the Justice League International in the comics, as have some of the characters confirmed or rumored for the DCU. Based on that, and the fact that DC Comics writer Tom King, who used the JLI in his acclaimed The Human Target series, is one of the DCU&#39;s architects, Metamorpho&#39;s ties to the team could be explored in or after Superman: Legacy.




There is also another possible team for Carrigan&#39;s Metamorpho to join following his role in Superman: Legacy. Gunn has teased The Terrifics on social media, and given how two members of the obscure team will debut in the DCU&#39;s first movie — Metamorpho and Mister Terrific — it would make sense for that to be the next step in Carrigan&#39;s DC future. Whatever the actor&#39;s DCU path holds after Superman: Legacy, it will be interesting to see Carrigan as a DC hero like Metamorpho after his past villain roles.





Superman: Legacy releases in theaters on July 11, 2025.
