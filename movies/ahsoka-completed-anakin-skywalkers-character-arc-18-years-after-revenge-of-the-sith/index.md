## Literature Review

After leaving the Jedi Order in The Clone Wars, Ahsoka Tano completes Anakin Skywalker&#39;s arc to become a Jedi Master after Revenge of the Sith. 




After walking away from the Jedi Order in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Anakin Skywalker&#39;s Padawan Ahsoka Tano finally completed Anakin&#39;s Jedi Master character arc by finishing her Jedi training in Star Wars&#39; Disney&#43; TV series Ahsoka 18 years after Star Wars: Episode I - Revenge of the Sith. Introduced in the Clone Wars movie, Ahsoka Tano was co-created by George Lucas, who wanted Anakin Skywalker to have a Padawan.




Anakin&#39;s quest for mastery can be seen in Revenge of the Sith. There, Anakin was put on the Jedi Council at Chancellor Palpatine&#39;s request, and he clearly hoped this meant he would be a master - which he saw as primarily being about power. The Jedi Council refused to grant Anakin this honor, however, prompting an outraged reaction from Anakin: &#34;How can you do this? This is outrageous. It&#39;s unfair. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?&#34; Despite Anakin taking this as an affront, though, Star Wars: The Clone Wars revealed how Ahsoka may have played into this decision.

 Anakin Skywalker Was Never A Real Jedi Master - Because Of Ahsoka 
The Clone Wars
          




Anakin&#39;s reaction to the Council&#39;s decision makes it clear that he believes he is owed the rank of Jedi Master, in part because he seemingly believes that &#34;Master&#34; is a position obtained based on skill set and, perhaps in light of his heroism during the Clone Wars, accolades. This understanding of the Jedi Order&#39;s ranking system is incorrect, though; the rank of Master signals that a Jedi Knight&#39;s Padawan has completed their training. Anakin never achieved that rank because his Padawan, Ahsoka, never finished her training; Ahsoka left the Jedi Order after they did not back her while she was on trial, falsely accused of murder.

In truth, many other factors likely affected this decision. The Council, particularly Mace Windu, didn&#39;t fully trust him, and granting him that rank would have signaled otherwise and been a risk (for reasons made clear by his actions later on). Even his response to their decision demonstrates that Anakin was not ready. He responds with anger, ego, and a sense of entitlement to &#39;fairness.&#39; None of these is befitting a Jedi, let alone a Jedi Master, and those flaws are not only why he did not achieve the rank of Master, but also why he fell. Despite that, Ahsoka was one more block on his path to Master status.






 Ahsoka Finally Completed Her Training In The World Between Worlds

Hayden Christensen returned as Anakin Skywalker in Ahsoka, appearing as a Force Ghost to teach his former Padawan one last lesson. He was confronting a former Padawan who lived in a sense of ambiguity, because Ahsoka had famously insisted she was no Jedi when she confronted Darth Vader in Star Wars Rebels, claiming she fought for revenge. That notion stuck to the character, with discourse going back and forth about whether that was true; in so many ways throughout Rebels, she still came across as a Jedi. Her use of lightsabers, her commitment to helping others, her Force abilities, and her moral compass all suggest she was still living as a Jedi.



The lesson, live or die, leaves Ahsoka confronting not only the brutality of The Clone Wars but also the reality that Anakin became Vader.







Despite that, at the beginning of the Ahsoka series, her status as a Jedi remained ambiguous. Ahsoka was training Sabine in the ways of the Force and still relied on old training clips of Anakin, suggesting that her Jedi background remained important, but her resistance to being a Jedi needed to be resolved. That answer comes in the form of Anakin&#39;s final lesson in the Ahsoka series, which takes place in The World Between Worlds. The lesson, live or die, leaves Ahsoka confronting not only the brutality of The Clone Wars but also the reality that Anakin became Vader. In the end, Ahsoka chooses to live.

The debate can at last come to an end, as this exchange with Anakin in The World Between Worlds officially concluded her Jedi training. She becomes Ahsoka the White and has a shift in demeanor, from subdued and bleak to calm and confident. Moreover, Rosario Dawson herself, who has played live-action Ahsoka in The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka, indicated that during her time in The World Between Worlds, Ahsoka &#39;graduated,&#39; signaling that this experience was her Jedi Trial, and she is now truly a Jedi. This transformation has a massive impact on Anakin&#39;s own arc.






 Ahsoka Is A True Jedi At Lastâ€¦ &amp; Anakin Is A True Jedi Master

If a Jedi Master is someone who has successfully trained a Padawan into becoming a Knight, then Anakin has finally completed his own arc, becoming a true Jedi Master. Hayden Christensen himself has confirmed that Anakin is now a Jedi Master. Although this change did not come until he was already a Force ghost, this move in the Ahsoka series was a beautiful addition to Anakin&#39;s arc. Star Wars continues to demonstrate that characters can overcome the flaws that they have and the choices that they make and hold true to Lucas&#39; idea of Anakin&#39;s story, which shows how the good can become bad, and the bad can become good. The fact that change can happen even after death is especially exciting, given that the franchise has become so much more willing to engage Force ghosts as active characters.




This new stage of Ahsoka&#39;s Jedi path and Anakin&#39;s sets up some exciting future plot points for the recently-confirmed Ahsoka season 2. Both Rosario Dawson and Hayden Christensen seem very willing to come back and reprise their roles either in Ahsoka or in some other capacity, and that means that the characters could flesh out their roles as true Jedi and Jedi Master. The image of Force Ghost Anakin looking down upon his former Padawan in the Ahsoka season finale also suggests that he may continue to play a role in her future.
