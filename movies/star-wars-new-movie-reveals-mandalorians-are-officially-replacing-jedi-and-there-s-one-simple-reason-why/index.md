## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will explore the master and apprentice dynamic in a different way than previous Star Wars movies.   The Jedi&#39;s rule against attachments created conflicts within the master and apprentice relationship, which the Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie seeks to address.   Grogu&#39;s choice to prioritize his attachment to Din Djarin over becoming a Jedi reveals a new approach to the master and apprentice theme in Star Wars.

## Literature Review

The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie announcement proves Mandalorians are now replacing the Jedi, and there&#39;s one major reason why this decision makes sense.




Star Wars recently announced The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, which will follow Din Djarin and his newly adopted son, Grogu, after the conclusion of The Mandalorian season 3. As Grogu has become Din&#39;s apprentice, the movie will see the Mandalorians&#39; version of the master and apprentice dynamic that has often been at the heart of Star Wars movies. Typically, the masters and apprentices have all been Jedi, from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy to Luke Skywalker and Rey in the sequel trilogy.




The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has already made itself distinct from previous Star Wars content because The Mandalorian itself has leaned into the bond between Din Djarin and Grogu, making them official family in season 3. Now that Grogu is not only Din&#39;s son but also his apprentice, their master and apprentice relationship will be much different than what&#39;s previously been seen with the Jedi. This fits with the previous master and apprentice relationship themes of the other Star Wars movies, but it also reveals a glaring problem The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be fixing.

                  Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie   The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.   


 The Master &amp; Apprentice Theme Is Central To Star Wars - But There&#39;s One Problem 
         




The master and apprentice dynamic has been a part of the Star Wars franchise since its inception; both the Jedi and the Sith followed that structure for centuries. Both have also equally demonstrated its flaws. In the case of the Sith, the master/apprentice dynamic doesn&#39;t work, because the apprentice is always seeking to destroy and take the place of the master. With the Jedi, the problem was much more complex; although the Jedi Order had Padawans become paired with particular Jedi Masters and train alongside them for years, the two were supposed to maintain a neutrality that simply wasn&#39;t natural or realistic.

The Jedi were against attachments, yet the very structure of their Order created them. Particularly because apprentices are fairly young when they begin training with their master, a sibling or even parental bond easily forms between the two. While pairs like Barriss Offee and Master Luminara Unduli may have succeeded in holding each other at arm&#39;s length, more central characters did not. The most prominent of these include Anakin and Obi-Wan, as well as Ahsoka and Anakin (with Anakin, unsurprisingly, as the common denominator). The conflict with attachments is not only Anakin&#39;s, though; all three struggle in similar ways.






The Jedi were against attachments, yet the very structure of their Order created them.




While Obi-Wan often adheres to the Jedi code, he gives himself away in his encounter with Anakin on Mustafar in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. As Anakin burns, Obi-Wan, who looks and sounds utterly heartbroken, says, &#34;You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.&#34; Even Obi-Wan felt the attachment between master and apprentice, and Anakin certainly reciprocated, as he told Padmé that Obi-Wan was like his father in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones.

Anakin then repeats the pattern with his own apprentice, Ahsoka, who refers to Anakin as an older brother when she is on the run. Anakin also, at multiple points in the Star Wars: The Clone Wars series, said he couldn&#39;t let Ahsoka die. Given the extent to which these Jedi demonstrated the conflict between the master and apprentice dynamic and the rule against attachments, it&#39;s clear that the policy did not work - and surprising that the Jedi Order never revisited it.






 Grogu&#39;s Return To Din Djarin Shows A Better Approach 
          

It seems, however, that the Star Wars franchise is revisiting the master and apprentice attachments rule with a brand-new group of people. In The Book of Boba Fett, Grogu decides to reunite with Din Djarin rather than become a Jedi—in other words, he chooses attachments over the path of a Jedi. This is a positive shift. A re-writing of the idea that attachments are inherently dangerous is long overdue, particularly since the pain that mentality causes is evident.



In The Book of Boba Fett, when the Armorer explains the Jedi rule against attachments, Din Djarin responds, &#34;That is the opposite of our creed. Loyalty and solidarity are the Way.&#34; 




This change will almost certainly be better for Grogu. Both Luke and Ahsoka expressed concern about the way Grogu&#39;s thoughts lingered on Din and how he clearly missed him when he briefly attended Luke&#39;s Jedi Temple. It was a bit disappointing to see Luke repeat this old mistake from the prequel era&#39;s Jedi Order, fearing attachments rather than trying to understand them. Even so, Grogu would have felt torn between Din and the Jedi because of this rule, and that conflict, even if it only ever remained internal, would have posed problems.






 Star Wars&#39; New Movie Confirms Mandalorians Have Embraced The &#34;Master &amp; Apprentice&#34; Theme 
          

A critical component of Grogu&#39;s choice is that he isn&#39;t choosing attachments over becoming a Jedi in the way Anakin did. Grogu truly prioritized his attachment to Din Djarin over his Jedi future, choosing an entirely different path. That new path suggests an exciting update to the franchise, wherein the Mandalorians have adopted the master and apprentice dynamic but without the strict, counterintuitive rules. In The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, Grogu will be an apprentice to his adoptive father, and, seemingly, that attachment will only strengthen their dynamic, ushering in a new era for Star Wars master and apprentice relationships.
