## Literature Review



There are plenty of older women, younger men relationships movies. When it comes to movies about women who love younger men, they are often rare and sometimes fail to deliver without falling into cliché tropes. However, this is not always the case and some films treat these romances with respect and don&#39;t shame the characters on either side of the love story. Love can look like many things, whether that be a friendship, a family bond, or even a relationship that strays from the usual conventions seen of &#34;acceptable&#34; love.
When it comes to these movies, some love stories feature younger men and mature women, even in movies like The Graduate where the actors playing them are closer in age than the characters they portrayed. However, sadly, in some movies that showcase a romance where there is a large age gap between the two leads, viewers can be met with an ensemble of films that seek to sexualize and fetishize the age difference. In these cases, there are plenty of movies that showcase this romance in a better light. These movies create some lovely onscreen representations of love between an older woman and a younger man.

The Proposal employs the fake dating-to-dating trope alongside some funny scenes between Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock. While the movie never made a huge deal about the age gap between them, Reynolds&#39; character was her PA, so the story implied she was at least a fair number of years his senior. The relationship between the two symbolizes this very subtly by Margaret being much more put together than Andrew. But in the end, the two fell in love anyway. The pair&#39;s onscreen chemistry mirrored in their healthy relationship which developed between them, earning them nominations for Best Couple at the People&#39;s Choice Awards.
