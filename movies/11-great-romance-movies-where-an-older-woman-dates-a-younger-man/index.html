  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>There are plenty of older women, younger men relationships movies. When it comes to movies about women who love younger men, they are often rare and sometimes fail to deliver without falling into cliché tropes. However, this is not always the case and some films treat these romances with respect and don&rsquo;t shame the characters on either side of the love story. Love can look like many things, whether that be a friendship, a family bond, or even a relationship that strays from the usual conventions seen of &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; love.
When it comes to these movies, some love stories feature younger men and mature women, even in movies like The Graduate where the actors playing them are closer in age than the characters they portrayed. However, sadly, in some movies that showcase a romance where there is a large age gap between the two leads, viewers can be met with an ensemble of films that seek to sexualize and fetishize the age difference. In these cases, there are plenty of movies that showcase this romance in a better light. These movies create some lovely onscreen representations of love between an older woman and a younger man.</p>

<p>9  Film Stars Don&rsquo;t Die In Liverpool (2017)
Annette Bening (59) &amp; Jamie Bell (31)</p>
<p>Rent now on Apple TV &amp; Prime Video</p>
<p>The heartbreaking but wholesome story of Peter Turner and Hollywood film star Gloria Grahame is one to behold. Film Stars Don&rsquo;t Die In Liverpool showcases the history of their love story through memories due to the return of her breast cancer. The romantic drama uses visual storytelling to create a lovely onscreen portrayal of a true romance that very much took &ldquo;Till Death Do Us Part&rdquo; seriously. Film Stars Don&rsquo;t Die In Liverpool may be tragically sad, but it shows the ups and downs of romance and pays very little attention to the obvious age gap. Bening won the AARP Movies for Grownups Award and Bell won the New Hollywood Award.</p>
<p>8  White Palace (1990)
Susan Sarandon (44) &amp; James Spader (30)</p>
<p>Not available for streaming</p>
<p>At first, White Palace looks as though it is going to be another stereotypical sleazy addition to the age-gap romance movie. However, before it gets a chance to enter that world, the film surprises its viewers and creates an endearing love story. White Palace sees a burst of chemistry when Max first meets Nora, which soon leads to the couple being completely enamored with one another. White Palace creates a conversation that strays away from the stereotype that renders older characters uninterested in sex, whilst avoiding the seedy older woman/younger man complex.</p>
<p>7  The Graduate (1967)
Anne Bancroft (36) &amp; Dustin Hoffman (30)</p>
<p>The Graduate
In The Graduate, Dustin Hoffman stars as college student Benjamin Braddock, who becomes involved in an affair with an older woman, Mrs. Robinson, played by Anne Bancroft. The film explores themes of alienation and the generation gap in 1960s America, and features a memorable soundtrack by Simon &amp; Garfunkel.
Release Date   December 21, 1967    Director   Mike Nichols    Cast   Dustin Hoffman , Katharine Ross , Murray Hamilton , Anne Bancroft , William Daniels    Rating   PG    Runtime   106 minutes</p>
<p>Streaming now on Roku</p>
<p>The Graduate contains a complex ending and one of the most complicated love triangles in history, making the movie such a compelling watch. Ms. Robinson and Ben&rsquo;s relationship is something of a power dynamic where she holds all the power. Unfortunately, this plays into the stereotypes of a relationship with a large age gap. Whilst the movie does adhere to those tropes, it also provides an insight into the impact of age gaps even if it isn&rsquo;t that big. The movie provides interesting dialogue regarding a couple&rsquo;s working dynamic and contrasting lifestyles. The movie earned seven Oscar nominations, winning for Best Director (Mike Nichols). The AFI calls it the 17th-best American movie of all time.</p>
<p>6  The Reader (2008)
Kate Winslet (33) &amp; David Kross (18)</p>
<p>Streaming now on Roku</p>

It affects the audience when Hanna ends up betraying Michael due to the investment in their story. The love story between the two sees them act as role models to one another, with Hanna embracing life for what it is and Michael becoming more mature throughout their relationship. The movie also may not have the happy ending fans are after.</p>
<p>5  Don Jon (2013)
Julianne Moore (53) &amp; Joseph Gordo-Levitt (32)</p>
<p>Stream now on DirecTV</p>
<p>Don Jon is a surprising movie that, on the surface, looks like a seedy romantic comedy. However, it is much more than that, especially in its representation of Esther and Don Jon. Esther and Don Jon represented one of the most open and honest portrayals of mutual understanding whilst also having a great sexual bond. Their relationship showcased a healthy portrayal of love through non-judgment, with each of the characters developing throughout their relationship. While Jon struggled with women his age, it wasn&rsquo;t until he found an older woman that he was finally satisfied.</p>
<p>4  The Age Of Adaline (2015)
Blake Lively (28 - Her character is over 100) &amp; Michiel Huisman (33)</p>

The Age Of Adaline is a fantasy romance movie that plays with viewers&rsquo; heartstrings. It was Adaline&rsquo;s relationship with Ellis that won the hearts of fans. The pair may have looked the same age, but Adaline was over 100 years old when she fell desperately in love with Ellis. Unfortunately, his father was a previous love of hers. The love between the pair is so strong that she breaks her rule of dating, making it a heartwarming watch that ultimately leaves viewers with a satisfying conclusion.

<p>3  I Could Never Be Your Woman (2007)
Michelle Pfeiffer (49) &amp; Paul Rudd (38)</p>
<p>Stream now on Starz</p>
<p>I Could Never Be Your Woman is a romantic comedy, but it also delves into the exact stereotypes that haunt older women who enter into a relationship with a younger man. Adam is one person who doesn&rsquo;t care what others think about him, which leads to what is a healthy relationship between the pair. This forces Rosie to think of their relationship differently. The movie removes the restraints age puts on love and makes for a wholesome, heartwarming, and hilarious watch. While it ended up going straight to DVD, it received mostly positive reviews with credit going to the positive representation of a relationship, despite the gap in age.</p>
<p>2  The Proposal (2009)
Sandra Bullock (45) &amp; Ryan Reynolds (33)</p>
<p>the proposal
After being threatened with deportation back to Canada, Margaret Tate tries forcing her assistant to marry him so she can keep her US visa. The Proposal was released in 2009 and stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Celebrities Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson, and Betty White also appear in the Anne Fletcher-directed film.
Release Date   June 19, 2009    Director   Anne Fletcher    Cast   Sandra Bullock , Ryan Reynolds , Betty White    Rating   pg-13    Runtime   108minutes</p>
<p>Stream now on Prime Video
The Proposal employs the fake dating-to-dating trope alongside some funny scenes between Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock. While the movie never made a huge deal about the age gap between them, Reynolds&rsquo; character was her PA, so the story implied she was at least a fair number of years his senior. The relationship between the two symbolizes this very subtly by Margaret being much more put together than Andrew. But in the end, the two fell in love anyway. The pair&rsquo;s onscreen chemistry mirrored in their healthy relationship which developed between them, earning them nominations for Best Couple at the People&rsquo;s Choice Awards.</p>
<p>1  Harold And Maude (1971)
Ruth Gordon (75) &amp; Bud Cort (23)</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Stream now on Paramount+</p>
<p>Harold And Maude is a perfect example of a great romance between an older woman and a younger man from the moment the pair meet. Through acts of service and personal affection, the pair develop a complete love for one another despite the huge age gap. The couple grasps the attention of viewers and highlights what a healthy relationship looks like. Maude helps Harold move away from his somewhat boring life, while Harold helps Maude to re-discover her youth. Ultimately, the movie ends in a tragedy, but the time the pair spent together left viewers with a new outlook on relationships with an age gap.</p>
