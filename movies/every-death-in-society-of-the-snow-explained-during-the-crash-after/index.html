  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>29 people tragically died during the 1972 Andes flight disaster; many passengers sadly did not survive the tragedy shown in Society of the Snow.</p>
<p>Summary
&ldquo;Society of the Snow&rdquo; pays extreme attention to detail, including the names and fates of all 29 people who died in the Andes flight disaster.
The movie portrays the emotional impact of the deaths, with one of the most moving moments being Nando&rsquo;s recollection of his father&rsquo;s plea to take care of his mother and sister.
The film reinforces the message that the meaning of who survives is up to the viewer by highlighting the tragic deaths and honoring the 29 people who perished.</p>
<p>The scale of the tragedy of J.A. Bayona&rsquo;s Society of the Snow is so immense, it can be hard to keep track of everyone who died during and after the 1972 Andes flight disaster. Throughout the movie, text appeared on-screen giving the names and ages of those who died. While they were left on screen for several seconds to let the weight of the deaths sink in, there were so many who died in the Andes that remembering all of them properly can be challenging.
Bayona paid extreme attention to the details of Uruguyan Air Force Flight 571, going as far as to actually film Society of the Snow on a mountaintop, just like the Andes where the plain crashed in real life. His attention to detail also extended to the real people who died on the mountain, as Society of the Snow includes the names of everyone on the flight. In total, 29 of the 45 passengers and crew died over the 72 days the survivors lived on the mountain before being rescued. Society of the Snow went to great lengths to remember everyone who died in the Andes.</p>
<p>Society Of The Snow Cast &amp; Real-Life Character Comparison Guide
The critically acclaimed survival movie Society of the Snow features an outstanding cast made entirely of Argentine and Uruguayan actors.</p>
<p>29  Eugenia Dolgay de Parrado
Crash</p>
<p>Nando and Susy&rsquo;s mother, Eugenia died during the plane&rsquo;s initial crash into the mountain. She was at the front of the plane and died when the seats broke free from the floor, crushing her. While she was not featured prominently in the movie, her death brought one of the most emotional moments as Nando recalled his father telling him to take care of his mother and sister.</p>
<p>28  Graziela Gumila de Mariani
First day</p>
<p>Graziela was one of the last passengers to die on the first day. She had been trapped underneath the wreckage of the seats. The other survivors tried to move the seats from her, but they failed. In the movie, she was referred to as &ldquo;the lady who was screaming,&rdquo; due to the pain she was experiencing through the night. She was on her way to attend her daughter&rsquo;s wedding.</p>
<p>27  Dante Lagurara
First night</p>
<p>Dante was the co-pilot of flight 571, and he was flying the plane when it crashed. He was a new pilot with little experience, and he misread the plane&rsquo;s position over the Andes. Thinking they had already passed the mountain range, he turned too soon and hit a peak. Dante was pinned against the dashboard of the plane and later succumbed to his fatal wounds.
In the movie and in real life, Dante survived the initial crash until the morning of the first day. When the survivors found him in the cockpit, he tried to explain why he turned the airplane when he did. In real life, he also asked some of the survivors to take his pistol and end his life, but the survivors refused.</p>
<p>26  Esther Horta de Nicola
Crash</p>
<p>Esther died in the initial crash. She died with her husband, Francisco, who was traveling with the team. The death of her and her husband left the couple&rsquo;s four children orphaned.</p>
<p>25  Francisco Nicola
Crash</p>
<p>Francisco was the rugby team&rsquo;s physician. As he was sitting at the front of the plane, he died immediately after being thrown forward and crushed. His wife, Esther, was sitting next to him, and the couple died together.</p>
<p>24  Julio Ferradás
Crash</p>
<p>Julio was the pilot of the plane, but he was not flying when they hit the mountain. He was killed instantly during the crash after being thrown through the cockpit window. He was a colonel in Uruguay&rsquo;s army.</p>
<p>23  Julio Martínez Lamas
First night</p>
<p>Julio died on the first night while sleeping in the fuselage due to injuries from the crash. He was not a member of the rugby team, but a fan. He also founded the Stella Maris School, where many of the passengers had attended.</p>
<p>22  Felipe Maquirriain
First night</p>
<p>Felipe died on the first night due to trauma he sustained in the crash. Arturo invited Felipe to come along to Chile. He was a member of the rugby team and an economics student, and he died at the age of 22.</p>
<p>21  Francisco &ldquo;Pancho&rdquo; Abal
First night</p>
<p>Francisco was also on the rugby team and Nando described him as one of his best friends. He died from severe head trauma on the first night, before Nando had awoken from his coma. Francisco invited Javier, his cousin, and Liliana to the rugby match.</p>
<p>20  Fernándo Vázquez
Crash</p>
<p>Fernándo was a medical student and friend of Roberto. Roberto and his other friends nicknamed him &ldquo;El Flaco.&rdquo; The two studied together at the Faculty of Medicine, and Roberto invited Fernándo along for the trip. His leg was cut open during the plane crash, and he bled to death soon after.</p>
<p>19  Carlos Valeta
Crash</p>
<p>Carlos&rsquo;s death was not shown on screen, but he was also thrown from the plane when the tail broke off. In real life, Carlos survived his initial fall from the plane, but died while making his way down the glacier. He fell into a snow pile and suffocated. In real life, the rest of the survivors saw Carlos before following the plane crash, but his fall put him out of their sight. His body was not found until Day 63.</p>
<p>18  Susana &ldquo;Susy&rdquo; Parrado
Day 9</p>
<p>Susy survived for several days after the crash, though she was in poor health throughout. During the crash, she received multiple bruises and cuts, and she had frostbite on her feet. In the movie, Susy succumbed to her wounds and the cold on Day 9 in her brother&rsquo;s arms. Nando would protect Susy and Eugenia&rsquo;s bodies from being eaten until he departed to find help on Day 61. Then, he gave the other survivors permission to use his mother and sister to stay alive.</p>
<p>17  Gastón Costemalle
Crash</p>
<p>Numa, Gustavo, and Daniel found Gastón&rsquo;s body on Day 12 while searching for batteries for the radio in the tail of the plane. Gastón died after being sucked out of the plane during the initial impact and had been dead for days before his body was found. He was one of the friends who convinced Numa to accompany them to the rugby match in the beginning of the movie.</p>
<p>16  Ramón Martinez
Crash</p>
<p>The survivors also found Ramón&rsquo;s body while searching for the tail of the plane on Day 12. He had also fallen from the tail of the plane on impact, and had been dead for days prior. He was a lieutenant and the navigator on the plane.</p>
<p>15  Ovidio Ramírez
Crash</p>
<p>Ovidio&rsquo;s body was also discovered during the search for the plane&rsquo;s tail and batteries. He had been dead since the initial crash. He was a sergeant in the Air Force and acted as the plane&rsquo;s purser, meaning he handled money and supplies.</p>
<p>14  Alexis Hounié
Crash</p>
<p>Alexis was a member of the rugby team and one of the bodies the survivors found during their search on Day 12. He was a veterinary student in life.</p>
<p>13  Guido Magri
Crash</p>
<p>Guido was also described by Nando as one of his best friends and teammates. He died in the initial crash and was found on the mountain after being pulled from the plane mid-crash. He studied agronomy, a subsection of agriculture.</p>
<p>12  Daniel Shaw
Crash</p>
<p>Daniel had also been pulled from the plane during the crash, but his body was found further away and not until Day 62. He was a cattle rancher in life. He was a substitute player for the Old Christians club and the Stauchs&rsquo; cousin.</p>
<p>11  Liliana Navarro de Methol
Day 17</p>
<p>Lilliana was Javier&rsquo;s wife and the mother of several children. She survived 17 days, but the avalanche during the blizzard killed her. She was buried alive under the snow and her husband. Throughout the movie, the survivors look for meaning as to why this tragedy happened to them. Liliana&rsquo;s death gave Javier his meaning, as it inspired him to bring her love for him back to their children.</p>
<p>10  Marcelo Pérez Del Castillo
Day 17</p>
<p>Marcelo was the leader of the Old Christian Club rugby team and the defacto leader of the survivors during the first days following the crash. He believed that a rescue operation was underway and that they would be found within days, which led several characters to put off leaving the crash site or eating human meat until the radio was repaired. Once the radio was working again, Marcelo realized that the search had been called off and he had made a mistake, and apologized to the other survivors and asked them to begin eating to survive longer. Marcelo died during the avalanche on Day 17.</p>
