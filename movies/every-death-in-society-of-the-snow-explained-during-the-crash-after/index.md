The scale of the tragedy of J.A. Bayona&#39;s Society of the Snow is so immense, it can be hard to keep track of everyone who died during and after the 1972 Andes flight disaster. Throughout the movie, text appeared on-screen giving the names and ages of those who died. While they were left on screen for several seconds to let the weight of the deaths sink in, there were so many who died in the Andes that remembering all of them properly can be challenging.
Bayona paid extreme attention to the details of Uruguyan Air Force Flight 571, going as far as to actually film Society of the Snow on a mountaintop, just like the Andes where the plain crashed in real life. His attention to detail also extended to the real people who died on the mountain, as Society of the Snow includes the names of everyone on the flight. In total, 29 of the 45 passengers and crew died over the 72 days the survivors lived on the mountain before being rescued. Society of the Snow went to great lengths to remember everyone who died in the Andes.

Graziela was one of the last passengers to die on the first day. She had been trapped underneath the wreckage of the seats. The other survivors tried to move the seats from her, but they failed.

Dante was the co-pilot of flight 571, and he was flying the plane when it crashed. He was a new pilot with little experience, and he misread the plane&#39;s position over the Andes. Thinking they had already passed the mountain range, he turned too soon and hit a peak. Dante was pinned against the dashboard of the plane and later succumbed to his fatal wounds.
In the movie and in real life, Dante survived the initial crash until the morning of the first day.

In the movie, Susy succumbed to her wounds and the cold on Day 9 in her brother&#39;s arms.

Day 17
        

Marcelo was the leader of the Old Christian Club rugby team and the defacto leader of the survivors during the first days following the crash.

Once the radio was working again, Marcelo realized that the search had been called off and he had made a mistake, and apologized to the other survivors and asked them to begin eating to survive longer. Marcelo died during the avalanche on Day 17.
