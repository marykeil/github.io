## Literature Review

Dwayne Johnson returning for Disney’s live-action Moana means the movie will break a major trend when it comes to the studio’s live-action remakes.




Dwayne &#34;The Rock&#34; Johnson confirmed that his next project is a live-action Moana movie, which means Disney will break a major live-action remake trend. The news of a live-action Moana is exciting, as a sequel has never been greenlit in the years following 2016&#39;s animated hit. With a live-action adaptation on the horizon, Moana&#39;s popularity will endure — and maybe even prompt further animated movies set in the same world.




That&#39;s just one of the reasons a Moana remake is a big deal, but Johnson&#39;s involvement also promises a compelling adaptation. Although Disney&#39;s live-action remakes haven&#39;t been tremendously successful, involving a member of the original cast will help Moana feel authentic. Unfortunately, Moana&#39;s original voice actor won&#39;t return for the project. Even still, Johnson&#39;s comeback marks a nice change of pace from Disney&#39;s usual approach to its live-action adaptations.



Moana is available to stream on Disney&#43;.





 Dwayne Johnson Returning For Moana Means Maui Won&#39;t Be Recast In Live-Action 
          

If Johnson is returning for the live-action Moana movie, it means Maui won&#39;t be recast in the remake. Johnson captures the role perfectly in the original film, so it&#39;s fitting that he&#39;ll be able to bring Maui to life in another medium. There&#39;s little doubt the actor will do a good job with this iteration of the character, and it&#39;s clear he&#39;s passionate about Moana overall. Discussing the upcoming project during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (via YouTube), Johnson even began rapping Maui&#39;s &#34;Your Welcome&#34; from the movie. This offered a glimpse of what his live-action Maui would be like, and it bodes well.






 Dwayne Johnson Is Only The Third Actor To Reprise Their Role In A Disney Live-Action Remake 
         

Johnson&#39;s casting as Maui in the live-action Moana breaks a Disney trend, as it&#39;s only the third time an actor has reprised their animated role for a live-action movie. The first star to do so was Jim Cummings, who went from voicing Pooh and Tigger in the Winnie the Pooh cartoon to voicing the duo in 2018&#39;s live-action Christopher Robin. James Earl Jones, who voiced Mufasa in the original Lion King movie, was also so iconic that he returned for 2019&#39;s live-action remake.

Of course, The Lion King and Winnie the Pooh mostly feature CGI characters, which means Johnson will be the first actor to reprise a role in live-action and actually appear on-screen. While Cummings and Jones both made the jump from an animated story to a live-action project, they were still voicing characters rather than physically playing them. As Maui takes on a human appearance, Johnson will be front and center in the live-action Moana, marking a first for Disney.
