# 10 Movie Recasts That Ended Up Backfiring


## SUMMARY 


 Recasting can lead to disappointment and backlash from fans who believe the new actor is unable to live up to the legacy of the original.

## Literature Review

There have been a few instances when certain movie roles are recast and fans are not pleased with the decision. 




Now and then, movie roles will be recast and fans aren&#39;t too happy with the chosen replacement. Recastings happen for a variety of reasons. A few reasons include scheduling conflicts, disagreements between actors and film studios, or a reboot years later that features the original characters but is portrayed by different actors.
Often, the consensus from fans is that the recasts ruin what was great about the original actor playing these characters. Other times, however, despite the talent of the new actor stepping into the role, it&#39;s impossible for them to live up to the legacy of the original actors. No matter the reason, these recast roles caused problems for film studios and left audiences upset.









 








 10  George Clooney 
Replaced Val Kilmer In Batman &amp; Robin


 







  Batman and Robin  


  Release Date    June 20, 1997     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    George Clooney , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Chris O&#39;Donnell , Uma Thurman    


The character of Batman has been played by various actors throughout the years. In the 1997 film Batman &amp; Robin, George Clooney gave his version of the superhero, replacing Val Kilmer. Clooney was unable to bring anything exciting for audiences to the role and disappointment with the actors playing Batman continued as Kilmer&#39;s previous performance wasn&#39;t celebrated either. However, the weight of the recasting backlash doesn&#39;t lie entirely on Clooney. Upon its release, Batman &amp; Robin received largely negative reviews for being too comical and jokey and continues to be seen as the worst among all the Batman films.

 9  Dan Castellaneta 
Replaced Robin Williams In The Return Of Jafar
        

Robin Williams as the Genie in Disney&#39;s Aladdin is a highly recognizable and beloved character. However, Williams found himself in disagreement with Disney after they used his voice for merchandising despite their original deal claiming the company would not do so. This led to Williams refusing to return for the sequel film, The Return of Jafar.
Instead, Williams was replaced by Dan Castellaneta. Castellaneta is no stranger to voice work, as his most notable work includes voicing the character of Homer Simpson. Still, audiences&#39; and critics&#39; displeasure with the recast was inevitable, as Williams&#39; version of the character was a difficult task for any other actor to take on. In 1996, Williams reprised his role in the second sequel film, Aladdin and the King of Thieves.





 8  Emilia Clarke 
Replaced Linda Hamilton In Terminator Genisys
        

  Terminator Genisys  


  Release Date    July 1, 2015     Director    Alan Taylor     Cast    Emilia Clarke , Jai Courtney , Arnold Schwarzenegger , Jason Clarke    


Emilia Clarke took on the role of Sarah Connor in Terminator Genisys after Linda Hamilton had played the character previously. Overall, the film is heavily disliked by both critics and audiences and holds a 26% score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Many people found Clarke, and Jai Courtney, to be widely miscast. Clarke was unable to do anything new with the character or bring a toughness to Sarah similar to how Hamilton had done in prior films. However, everything seemed to go wrong with Terminator Genisys. Planned sequels were canceled, much to the relief of Clarke who, following the release of the film, gave insight into the chaotic production.





 7  Jessie Cave 
Replaced Jennifer Smith In Harry Potter And The Half-Blood Prince
        

  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  


  Release Date    July 7, 2009     Director    David Yates     Cast    Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , Rupert Grint , Michael Gambon , Tom Felton , Alan Rickman , Jim Broadbent , David Thewlis , Maggie Smith , Robbie Coltrane , Julie Walters    


Jessie Cave played Lavender Brown in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Lavender is another Gryffindor student whose prominence grows with each film. Cave continued to play Lavender in the films that followed, but the two other actresses cast were Kathleen Cauley and Jennifer Smith. The biggest issue people had with this recast was the fact that Cave was white and the previous actresses were people of color. Cave&#39;s casting is likely due to her having more film experience compared to Smith or Cauley, but fans argue that since there&#39;s no description of Lavender&#39;s race in the books, another Black actress with similar film experience could have been cast instead.
            
 
 Harry Potter: Every Actor Who Has Been Recast 
While Harry Potter stars like Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson made their roles iconic, many characters were recast in the movie franchise.








 6  Vince Vaughn 
Replaced Anthony Perkins In Psycho (1998)


 







As a film overall, the 1998 remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s Psycho was dubbed pointless by critics and audiences. Rather than a typical remake or reboot, the film is more or less a shot-for-shot replication. Vince Vaughn took on the role of Norman Bates, following a noteworthy performance by Anthony Perkins. In the eyes of both critics and audiences, Vaughn was unable to tap into the demeanor needed for the character. Rather than being seen as subtle and unsuspecting, the Norman portrayed by Vaughn was unsettling and sinister in an obvious way.





 5  Bryce Dallas Howard 
Replaced Rachelle Lefevre In The Twilight Saga: Eclipse
        

  The Twilight Saga: Eclipse  


  Release Date    June 30, 2010     Director    David Slade     Cast    Dakota Fanning , Nikki Reed , Jackson Rathbone , Billy Burke , Kellan Lutz , Taylor Lautner , Kristen Stewart , Robert Pattinson , Peter Facinelli , Bryce Dallas Howard , Elizabeth Reaser , Ashley Greene    


In the third installment of the Twilight Saga, Bryce Dallas Howard played Victoria, the antagonist vampire after Bella Swan. Victoria was previously played by actress Rachelle Lefevre in the first two films. Lefevre wanted to remain part of the franchise as Victoria but was ultimately let go. Her removal from The Twilight Saga: Eclipse was due to miscommunication about schedules between Lefevre and the Summit Entertainment production company. Which actress plays the best Victoria varies from fan to fan. The mannerisms and overall appearance of both variations differ from one another and while some fans were upset to see Lefevre go, others appreciated what Howard brought to the character.





 4  Julianne Moore 
Replaced Jodie Foster In Hannibal
        

In The Silence of the Lambs sequel, Hannibal, the role of Clarice Starling was played by Julianne Moore, replacing Jodie Foster. Despite the efforts to get Foster back to play the iconic role, she declined. Foster had stated early on that she felt the characterization of Clarice was a disservice to what she was originally. Later on, Foster said the opportunity to film another movie, Flora Plum, provided an excuse to walk away from Hannibal. As with many recast roles, Moore&#39;s performance was compared to that of the original and audiences left the film unimpressed with her spin on the character.





 3  Robert Burke 
Replaced Peter Weller In RoboCop 3
        

RoboCop 3 is disliked by critics and audiences alike. The film stars Robert Burke as the titular character, also known as Alex Murphy, who was previously played by Peter Weller in prior films. Weller was unable to fulfill the role of Alex Murphy due to scheduling conflicts and production on the film continued without him. Many of the negative reviews of RoboCop 3 are about the toned-down violence and Weller&#39;s absence. Burke was unable to meet the standard Weller had set for the character. Weller was praised for his performance as he was able to let the character&#39;s vulnerability and humanity shine through the heavy, mechanical suit.





 2  Maria Bello 
Replaced Rachel Weisz In The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor
        

  The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor  


  Release Date    August 1, 2008     Director    Rob Cohen     Cast    Brendan Fraser , John Hannah , Jet Li , Michelle Yeoh , Maria Bello    


In The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Maria Bello replaced Rachel Weisz as the character Evelyn O&#39;Connell. While fans weren&#39;t staggeringly upset at the recast role, Bello&#39;s performance wasn&#39;t noted as anything spectacular due to the precedent Weisz set during her portrayal in the franchise&#39;s previous films. Various reasons have been given for Weisz&#39;s departure from the franchise, including her dissatisfaction with the script, scheduling conflicts, and wanting to be at home with her newborn child. However, the potential of a fourth installment in The Mummy franchise is the perfect opportunity for Weisz to return as Evelyn.





 1  Jonathan Groff 
Replaced Hugo Weaving In The Matrix Resurrections


 







  The Matrix Resurrections  


  Release Date    December 22, 2021     Director    Lana Wachowski     Cast    Brian J. Smith , Jada Pinkett Smith , Jessica Henwick , Jonathan Groff , Neil Patrick Harris , Priyanka Chopra Jonas , Max Riemelt , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Toby Onwumere , Keanu Reeves , Telma Hopkins , Carrie-Anne Moss , Christina Ricci    


As the fourth film in The Matrix franchise, The Matrix Resurrections saw Jonathan Groff take on the role of Agent Smith after being played by Hugo Weaving. The response to Groff&#39;s casting and performance was another example of recast actors incapable of fitting into the shoes of previous acclaimed performances. While the characters of both Agent Smith and Morpheus are played by new actors, the role of Morpheus is almost an entirely new character.
However, audiences are meant to believe Groff is the same character Weaving portrayed. For most audiences, Groff&#39;s version of Agent Smith isn&#39;t terrible. Still, he doesn&#39;t bring the grit and intensity needed for the well-known character. Therefore, audiences didn&#39;t buy into Resurrections&#39; Smith being the same agent they were familiar with.
