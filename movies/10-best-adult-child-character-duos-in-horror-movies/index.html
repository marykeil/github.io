  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Although not seen often in horror movies, adult-child duos in this genre show the different connections that can grow between these characters.</p>
<p>Adult and child duos don’t often happen in horror movies, but when they do, they offer different perspectives on the bonds that can be created between them. Adult-child duos are often found in children’s movies, but these have also appeared in the horror genre and have made way for some of the most exciting and at times tragic stories in this genre. The chemistry between the child actors and the adult ones was key to the bond of their characters and making their dynamic and relationship believable, complementing each other’s performances while also adding to the horror and suspense of their movies.
The horror genre has seen different types of adult-child pairs, unlike other genres where they are usually a team-up of a troubled adult and a child or they share the same issues and help each other overcome them. In horror movies, adult-child duos often join forces to defeat whatever threat they are facing, or they share the same supernatural abilities, were brought together by tragic circumstances, or one had to save the other from the horrors they were being haunted by – however, this doesn’t always mean that both get a happy ending.</p>
<p>10  Heather &amp; Dylan in Wes Craven’s New Nightmare
Played by Heather Langenkamp &amp; Miko Hughes</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Wes Craven’s New Nightmare took the mythology of Freddy Krueger and gave it a twist by explaining Krueger was a fictional movie villain, but the movies caught an ancient supernatural entity that was freed with the release of Freddy’s Dead: The Final Nightmare. Now, disguised as Krueger, the entity goes after Heater Langenkamp as killing her would allow it into the real world. Unfortunately, the real world overlaps with Krueger’s realm and Krueger abducts Heather’s son, Dylan, forcing Heather to take on the role of Nancy Thompson to save Dylan.
Dylan was haunted and traumatized by Krueger before the latter abducted him, but being the son of one of the most famous Final Girls in horror history, he escaped from Krueger and reunited with Heather, and together, they pushed Krueger into a furnace and lit it, destroying him and his reality. New Nightmare is the story of a mother and a son and the strong bond and love between them, which not even an evil entity from the dream realm could break, nor did he really stand a chance against that.</p>
<p>9  Gemma &amp; Cady in M3GAN
Played by Allison Williams &amp; Violet McGraw</p>
<p>M3GAN follows Gemma, a roboticist at a high-tech company who becomes the guardian of her eight-year-old niece, Cady, after her parents die in a car accident. Gemma and Cady struggle to connect, but after seeing her interact with one of her motion-capture robots, Gemma is motivated to complete M3GAN, a child-sized humanoid robot doll powered by artificial intelligence. Although they successfully bond, Cady grows dependent on M3GAN, while the doll begins to operate independently, targeting anything that she considers a threat to Cady, going as far as to kill.
Cady had trouble processing her grief and felt lonely while with Gemma, who didn’t know how to raise Cady nor how to emotionally connect with her, resulting in Cady trusting M3GAN more than her aunt. It wasn’t until M3GAN attempted to kill Gemma that Cady understood M3GAN wasn’t her friend, and she saved her aunt by stabbing M3GAN’s main chip. Cady and Gemma show the complexity of relationships between relatives and how difficult the grieving process can be, and hopefully, their relationship improved after the whole M3GAN chaos.</p>

After Todd kills rival barber Adolfo Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen), Lovett adopts Pirelli’s assistant, Toby. The young boy grows suspicious of Todd’s plans and vows to protect Mrs. Lovett, to the point where he kills Todd after witnessing him throwing Mrs. Lovett into the oven.
Mrs. Lovett was a lonely woman, while Toby was verbally and physically abused by Pirelli, and drank a lot of alcohol to cope. Toby found safety and comfort with Mrs. Lovett, though he had no idea of what was happening at the bakery, while Mrs. Lovett found the love and attention she wasn’t getting from Todd. Despite Mrs. Lovett locking Toby after he revealed his suspicions about Todd, he remained loyal to her until the very end.</p>

Norman went from antagonist to antihero in Don’t Breathe 2, as he rescued and adopted Phoenix and went to lengths to rescue her again when Raylan and company kidnapped her to transplant her organs to her dying mother. Norman even trained her to survive in case she was ever in serious trouble, yet he didn’t rest until she was safe, but as they were a family (though an unconventional one), Phoenix also did her part in saving the only father she ever had.</p>
<p>6  Michael &amp; Sam in The Lost Boys
Played by Jason Patric &amp; Corey Haim</p>

Sam, with the help of his new friends and self-proclaimed vampire hunters, Edgar (Corey Feldman) and Alan Frog (Jamison Newlander), investigates the gang in hopes of finding a cure for Michael.
Although the brothers don’t join forces properly until the third act of the movie (but Michael asks Sam for help when he realizes what’s happening to him), The Lost Boys quickly establishes that Michael and Sam have a very special and strong bond as brothers, and while Sam tried to save Michael from fully turning into a vampire, Michael did his best to keep his brother and their mother safe from the vampires.</p>

In it, Danny Torrance, now an adult working at a hospice, meets Abra, a young girl with exceptional shining who is targeted by a group of psychic vampires.

Claudia becomes Louis’ companion, and though physically she never ages, she grows and matures mentally and emotionally, falling in love with Louis.
Louis and Claudia are one of the best love stories in the horror genre, and Louis also falls in love with Claudia, though in a non-romantic way. Louis and Claudia kept each other company for many years and protected each other from all types of dangers, especially from Lestat. Sadly, when Louis and Claudia were ready to part ways, as painful as it was for both, they were attacked by another group of vampires, resulting in Claudia’s death.</p>

Together, Ripley and Newt confront the aliens and stay together through the whole chaos, while complementing each other as Ripley knows how to fight and Newt how to move through the colony.

<p>1  Malcolm &amp; Cole in The Sixth Sense
Played by Bruce Willis &amp; Haley Joel Osment</p>
<p>M. Night Shyamalan’s The Sixth Sense not only has one of the best plot twists in horror history but also one of the best adult-child duos. The Sixth Sense follows child psychologist Malcolm Crowe, who begins working with nine-year-old Cole Sear, whose mom has depression and has noticed mysterious signs of physical harm, along with Cole isolating himself and other alarming signs. Cole confides his biggest secret in Malcolm: he can see dead people, and so Malcolm helps him deal with this unique ability. Cole starts doing better socially and personally, and when his work with Cole is over, Malcolm realizes he’s a ghost and finally departs.
Malcolm and Cole were key in their respective emotional processes: Cole needed guidance about his special powers, which terrified him to the point of affecting all other areas of his life, and Malcolm felt he needed to make up for his mistakes with Vincent (a patient and his killer), which he did with Cole, who also helped him accept he was a ghost. Malcolm was also the only adult to truly listen to Cole and offer him help, while he served as Malcolm’s only real connection to the physical world.</p>
