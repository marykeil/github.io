<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s Jane Eyre has been adapted to film many times, and here are 10 of its best film translations of all time, ranked.</p>
<p>Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s most popular work, Jane Eyre, published in 1847, has been adapted many times and in numerous ways, and the best Jane Eyre movies feature excellent performances. The novel&rsquo;s discussion of Christianity, social class, feminism, and romance caused ripples when it was published that have lasted until today. Despite taking place in Victorian England, the story of a young woman&rsquo;s journey towards independence and love is timeless and people can still connect to that story.
Unlike Jane Austen&rsquo;s Pride &amp; Prejudice or Emma, Jane Eyre hasn&rsquo;t been adapted nearly as many times into movies. It did start with stage productions and radio plays before being adapted for the screen. Most of the best Jane Eyre movies adhere to the story presented in the novel, but there are some very interesting adaptations of the novel that take creative leaps. The biggest strength of the adaptations has been in the performances of the actors. Those who play Rochester and Jane have to have perfect chemistry, and these adaptations feature fantastic performances alongside their interesting stories.</p>
<p>The 50 Best Movies Of All Time
Screen Rant breaks down the 50 best movies of all time, which are based on original scores weighted by rankings from IMDb and Metacritic.</p>
<p>15  Jane Eyre (1910)
Starring Irma Taylor &amp; Frank Hall Crane</p>
<p>Unavailable to stream</p>
<p>The 1910 film adaptation of Jane Eyre is thought to be the first. It was produced less than 70 years after the debut of the novel. The novel made its debut much closer to the age of modern cinema than some fans might think. The silent movie is, at the very least, the first English-language version of the story on screen. It’s a relatively straightforward adaptation of the novel with many condensed parts of the story summarized for the audience according to reviews from the time.
It’s also one of the earliest silent movies in which the actors are credited on screen, something that just wasn’t done in the early days of silent films. It proved so popular that additional prints of the film were ordered by theaters. It saved Thanhouser Film Corporation at the time, a studio that found itself with very few successful moving pictures. The film, unfortunately, is presumed lost today.</p>
<p>14  Jane Eyre (1934)
Starring Virginia Bruce &amp; Colin Clive</p>
<p>Available to stream on Tubi</p>
<p>The 1934 version was the first &ldquo;talkie&rdquo; adaptation. Monogram Pictures, a small production company at the time, did the best they could on a relatively small budget. Jane never visits her dying aunt or runs away to Moor House, but the audience at least gets to see her childhood at Gateshead and a brief scene at Lowood. This is one version where much of the story is changed to fit Hollywood&rsquo;s idea of a fairy tale; Jane is beautiful, talented, and accomplished, while Rochester is kind and paternal. For those who like the story of Jane Eyre but wish it were more upbeat and less gothic, then this version may be the one for them.</p>
<p>13  Jane Eyre (1949)
Starring Mary Sinclair &amp; Charlton Heston</p>
<p>Unavailable to stream</p>
<p>This made-for-television version, which aired on CBS, was restricted due to time constraints and filmed on one set. This inevitably led to the removal of some major plot points from the book, such as Jane&rsquo;s time at Gateshead and Moor House. The only time we see Lowood is during a brief scene at the start of the film where Jane indignantly states that she has been mistreated and will never return. The most enjoyable elements of this adaptation are Charlton Heston as Rochester and the ridiculous wife in the attic.</p>
<p>12  Jane Eyre (1957)
Starring Joan Elan &amp; Patrick Macnee</p>
<p>Unavailable to stream</p>
<p>This adaptation leaves out any plot points that don&rsquo;t take place at Thornfield. Much of the plot is shifted around, likely due to time constraints. For example, rather than being interrupted at the altar, Rochester is in the middle of his proposal when Mason storms in and demands he tell Jane about Bertha. Rochester is a creepy alcoholic who leers after Jane, and Jane is much less plain than she is described in the novel. Mrs. Fairfax plays a larger role here, serving as Rochester&rsquo;s confidant about Bertha and helping him keep his secret. Some of the choices can seem a bit bizarre for fans of the novel, but they are entertaining nevertheless.</p>
<p>11  Sangdil (1952)
Starring Madhubala &amp; Dilip Kumar</p>
<p>Available to rent on Amazon</p>
<p>The first known Hindi-language adaptation of Jane Eyre, the movie took some liberties with the source material but stayed true to the bones of the story. It featured beloved Indian star Madhubala in the leading role opposite Dilip Kumar, whom she had a real-life relationship with for many years, which did aid in their chemistry on screen. While some critics said that this particular adaptation was boring, Sandgil formed the basis for several other Indian adaptations of Jane Eyre that would follow. It also paved the way for numerous other adaptations in different languages in India, like a Tamil and a Telugu adaptation in the 1970s.</p>
<p>10  SCTV’s Jane Eyrehead (1982)
Starring Andrea Martin &amp; Joe Flaherty</p>
<p>Unavailable to stream</p>
<p>While not a movie, and not a full-length television adaptation either, &ldquo;Jane Eyrehead&rdquo; deserves a spot among the best Jane Eyre adaptations for its creativity alone. Crafted by the Second City Comedy Troupe for television, the sketch parodies Jane Eyre at a time when the BBC was adapting one classic after another for TV movies and miniseries. In addition to Martin and Flaherty in the lead, the sketch features John Candy, Eugene Levy, and Martin Short. It also takes the story of Jane Eyre from her usual manor home to the set of Benny Hill, a popular series at the time.</p>
<p>9  Jane Eyre (1970)
Starring Susannah York &amp; George C. Scott</p>
<p>Available to stream on Tubi</p>
<p>Skipping Gateshead and going straight to Lowood, this version still manages to show the harsh beginnings of Jane&rsquo;s childhood. Many elements of the plot are condensed. This is the first version to show Jane&rsquo;s time at Moor House, and it includes the proposal from St. John, both being important story elements that often get left out by other adaptations. This portrayal of the central romance between Jane and Rochester may not be brimming with passion, but Susannah York and George C. Scott capture some of the most central elements of their characters. Perhaps the greatest feature of this adaptation is an instantly memorable score by John Williams.</p>
<p>8  Jane Eyre (1997)
Starring Samantha Morton &amp; Ciarán Hinds</p>
<p>Available to stream on Peacock</p>
<p>Everything but Jane&rsquo;s trip to Gateshead to visit her dying aunt is included in this TV romance adaptation. Ciarán Hinds&rsquo; take on Rochester certainly stands out among the others, and fans of the novel either love or hate this particular portrayal. Hinds often chooses to play Rochester as aggressive and abrasive, raising his voice frequently to convey Rochester&rsquo;s passionate nature. Both Jane and Rochester certainly fit their physical descriptions in the book, both in terms of age and physical features.</p>
<p>7  I Walked With A Zombie (1943)
Starring Betsy Connell &amp; Tom Conway</p>
<p>Available to stream on Tubi</p>
<p>This horror movie for RKO Pictures is very loosely based on Jane Eyre. It’s based on an article by Inez Wallace but uses her story to reinterpret the events of Jane Eyre. It’s one of the more unique takes on the story. I Walked With A Zombie follows a nurse as she takes a job caring for the sick wife of a sugar plantation owner in the Caribbean. Though it initially received mixed reviews when it was released, film scholars have changed their tune in the modern day, citing it as one of the earliest movies to have a thoughtful approach to its depiction of voodoo practices on screen and highlighting the African Diaspora more authentically.</p>
<p>6  Jane Eyre (1983)
Starring Zelah Clarke &amp; Timothy Dalton</p>
<p>Available to stream on Britbox</p>
<p>Of all the Jane Eyre movies, the 1983 version is by far the most faithful to the source material. Technically a television limited series, this version spans 11 episodes and details the events of every chapter of the novel. It features the most detail of the Jane Eyre adaptations, which fans will surely appreciate. Because of the length of this adaptation, Jane and Rochester&rsquo;s relationship is given plenty of time to grow. For novel purists who want to see an adaptation that is the novel translated to the screen, this is the version for them.</p>
<p>5  Jane Eyre (1996)
Starring Charlotte Gainsbourg &amp; William Hurt</p>
<p>Available to stream on Paramount+</p>
<p>Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, this version offers a somewhat muted take on the classic tale. Anna Paquin plays young Jane, excellently capturing her defiant spark and temper. Charlotte Gainsbourg plays Jane as an adult. She is still passionate, but this side of her nature is tempered by her experiences at Lowood and her knowledge that, as a single young woman with no fortune, the world will not react kindly to strong displays of emotion on her part.</p>
<p>4  National Theatre Live: Jane Eyre (2015)
Starring Madeleine Worral &amp; Felix Hayes</p>
<p>Recordings of National Theatre Productions Are Available For A Limited Time Through National Theater At Home</p>
<p>One of the great things about the UK’s National Theatre productions is that sometimes, productions are recorded for broadcast. In the case of Jane Eyre, a 2015 version of the stage show was recorded and broadcast in theaters, but it was also saved and made available for streaming as part of the National Theatre At Home program. It’s longer than most Jane Eyre movie adaptations at 3 hours and 20 minutes, but shorter than most miniseries would be, meaning that it has ample details that might be removed from the shorter adaptations. It employs clever uses of the theater stage, including ladders and equipment to make scenes work that other productions might have tried to hide away.</p>
<p>3  Jane Eyre (1943)
Starring Joan Fontaine &amp; Orson Welles</p>
<p>Available to rent on Prime VIdeo &amp; Google Play</p>
<p>Jane Eyre is a gothic romance, but many adaptations treat it as a classic period piece and ignore the gothic elements. With long shadows and stark black-white contrast, the locations feel the way they are described in the book in the 1943 Jane Eyre movie. Lowood feels lonely and oppressive, while Thornfield feels truly haunted by secrets bordering on the supernatural. Orson Welles gives a fantastic performance as Rochester, commanding every scene he is in. The actor&rsquo;s larger-than-life screen presence is perfect for the character and the story. He&rsquo;s one of the best Rochesters of any adaptation.</p>
<p>2  Jane Eyre (2006)
Starring Ruth Wilson &amp; Toby Stephens</p>
<p>Available to stream on Hulu
The 2006 Jane Eyre movie is another version that aired as a television miniseries on BBC. These four episodes cover everything in the novel, from Gateshead to Moor House. Scenes with Jane and Rochester pulse with romance and mystery, and the chemistry between Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is undeniable. Certain changes are made to the dialogue in an attempt to modernize the story for newer audiences, and these changes may not work for everyone. However, between Ruth Wilson&rsquo;s wonderful performance and the strength of the central love story, this version certainly does justice to Brontë&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>1  Jane Eyre (2011)
Starring Mia Wasikowska &amp; Michael Fassbender</p>
<p>Available to stream on Starz</p>
<p>Each version of a Jane Eyre movie has its strengths, but no other has captured the essence of the novel the way that the 2011 version has. Director Cary Fukunaga and screenwriter Moira Buffini make the brilliant decision to begin the movie with Jane fleeing Thornfield. The rest of the story—Jane&rsquo;s childhood, her romance with Rochester, her attempted marriage—is told through flashbacks. This improves the pacing of the film and keeps the audience engaged.
Though many actors have put their spin on these characters, this cast cannot be matched. Michael Fassbender is a nearly perfect Rochester. Meanwhile, Judi Dench and Jamie Bell, as well as the rest of the supporting cast, give great performances, as well. Mia Wasikowska is the star, and perhaps the greatest strength of this adaptation is the way it is so clearly meant to be Jane&rsquo;s story. Wasikowska&rsquo;s performance is perfect in every scene, capturing the nuances and contradictions of the iconic character. The 2011 adaptation is the best Jane Eyre movie.
