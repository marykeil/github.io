## Literature Review
Coyote vs. Acme voice actor Eric Bauza shares the first look at the uncancelled Loony Tunes movie, teasing the live-action and animation combination.




Despite being temporarily canceled, Coyote vs. Acme reiterates it is still becoming a reality with its first look image. The Looney Tunes movie has had a turbulent route towards the big screen. In November, Warner Bros. Discovery sparked outrage when it announced it was shelving the fully completed movie in favor of gaining a tax write-down. The studio had done this before with Batgirl and Scoob! Holiday Haunt. However, the Coyote vs. Acme backlash was strong enough that the studio reversed its decision. While the film is looking for a new distributor, it is still gearing up for its release.




Eric Bauza, who is voicing Wile E. Coyote in the film, took to X, formerly Twitter, to share the first look at the uncanceled Coyote vs. Acme.


 

The photo teases the film&#39;s unique combination of live-action and animation, as it sees the animated Coyote sitting next to his live-action lawyer (portrayed by Will Forte). Additionally, Lana Condor can be spotted sitting behind Coyote and his lawyer, although her role has not yet been disclosed. Meanwhile, Bauza&#39;s update seems to confirm the film is aiming for a 2024 release date.


 What To Expect From Coyote vs. Acme 
          




The first look image of Coyote vs. Acme also teases the film&#39;s primary plot. Given the premise, much of the film is expected to occur in a courtroom, with Coyote represented by Forte&#39;s character. Meanwhile, they will be fighting a legal battle against an Acme lawyer portrayed by John Cena. The movie will see Coyote taking legal action against Acme Corporation, the business that makes most of the outlandish products he uses to catch the Road Runner, which always backfire terribly.

The movie is inspired by a fictional 1990 New Yorker article by Ian Frazier, which reported on Coyote&#39;s lawsuit against Acme for personal and emotional injuries and damages he suffered from their products. A release date for Coyote vs. Acme remains unknown, but a 2024 release is possible if it finds a distributor quickly. Despite the cancelation attempt, insiders alleged that test screenings drew positive results, boding well for another studio saving it.



While Warner Bros. Discovery isn&#39;t shelving Coyote vs. Acme, it still won&#39;t distribute it. Instead, it&#39;s allowing the film to be shopped out to other studios, but it remains to be seen if any will ultimately pay the hefty $70 million Warner Bros. Discovery is allegedly asking for it.







Whether Coyote vs. Acme will release in theaters or boast an exclusive streaming release also depends on which studio nabs it. Streamers like Netflix and Amazon have expressed interest in the movie. These studios will likely be anxious to premiere the film as quickly as possible, given that it was initially supposed to be released in July 2023 and has been sitting in post-production for months. The cancelation and backlash have also likely heightened anticipation of the film. The first look image confirms that Coyote vs. Acme is remaining positive on its chances of being picked up and released by 2024.
