## Literature Review



Wonka has passed an important box office milestone. The new movie musical, which is a prequel to the 1971 Roald Dahl adaptation Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, stars Timothée Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka. It follows Wonka attempting to start his chocolate empire despite the efforts of a cabal of rich chocolatiers who pull the strings in town, in addition to being trapped in a yearslong contract to work at a corrupt laundry service.




Per Deadline, the Wonka box office has passed a major milestone in North America. The movie has taken No. 1 again at the post-Christmas Wednesday box office, grossing an additional $8 million on its 13th day and continuing its dominance after reclaiming the top spot on Tuesday. Its cumulative domestic total of $102.5 million makes it just the 24th movie of the year to cross the $100 million threshold to date.


 How High Up The Chart Can Wonka Climb? 
          

The Wonka release is in rarefied air now that it has crossed this financial threshold. It seems improbable that it will be able to match the high domestic grosses of huge 2023 releases such as Barbie ($636.2 million) and The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($574.9 million), but it will most likely climb even further up the chart before the end of its theatrical run. Check out Wonka&#39;s current total compared with the next highest-grossing domestic movies of the year below (excluding the No. 20 movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, which was a 2022 carryover release):




 Chart Rank  Title  Domestic Box Office   24  Wonka  $102.5 million   23  The Flash  $108.1 million   22  Scream VI  $108.2 million   21  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem  $118.6 million   19  Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s  $137.3 million   18  Fast X  $146.1 million   



If the Wonka musical takes in a comparable amount on the post-Christmas Thursday, it will quickly rise two spots up the chart, outgrossing both The Flash and Scream VI at the domestic box office. On top of that, Deadline is reporting that it is tracking well, just behind 2018&#39;s Marry Poppins Returns, which eventually earned a domestic total of $171.9 million. If it manages to reach a similar gross, the Timothée Chalamet movie would become the 14th highest-grossing domestic movie of the year, just behind the $172.1 million total of Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One.




However, it remains to be seen if Wonka could potentially climb even higher than No. 14. The movie has shown an astounding level of audience hold, which has allowed it to rise back to No. 1 in the holiday season in spite of the fact that more than seven newer wide releases have crowded theaters in the meantime. It should carry on performing well through January, which won&#39;t see the release of a new musical competitor until Mean Girls on the 12th.
