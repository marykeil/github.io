Summary

  Hutcherson hopes to explore the dream world and reality further in the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s sequel, potentially finding answers about his brother&#39;s disappearance.   The dense lore of the games provides many potential storylines and directions for the sequel, which the filmmakers are currently figuring out.   The first movie&#39;s clues and character connections could lead to a continuation of the haunting by William Afton and a deeper exploration of the sister location and Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza.  





Josh Hutcherson reveals which aspect of the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s lore he hopes to flesh out in the sequel. Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s was a massive hit for Blumhouse, earning more than $295 million at the box office and becoming Blumhouse&#39;s biggest hit ever. Hutcherson recently confirmed that a sequel is in development, although details are being kept under wraps at this time.




In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for The Beekeeper Hutcherson also discussed his wildly successful new horror franchise, Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s. He shared what from the first movie he&#39;d like to explore further in the sequel. Hutcherson also explained that the dense lore of the game has many potential storylines to explore, which is where they are in the development process of the highly anticipated sequel. Check out Hutcherson&#39;s full quote below:


Josh Hutcherson: We kind of tap into the world a bit with him playing with the dream world and reality, so I have a feeling that he’s going to dive deeper into that to get some more answers about his brother’s disappearance. Maybe find a way to leap between the dream world and the reality world. I feel like that could be a place it goes to.
But honestly, the lore of the games is so dense, and there’s so much material there that they could take this thing in a million different directions. I think that’s what they’re trying to figure out now. They have so many potential doorways to walk through, and I think they’re trying to figure that stuff out now.






 The First FNAF Movie Already Provides Clues For Where Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Can Go Next 
   Close     

In the first movie, William Afton finally reveals who he is, only to be killed by the spring trap within his costume and dragged away by the ghosts of his victims. Afton is the boogeyman of this franchise, so although he seemed to die, he&#39;ll inevitably return and continue to haunt Mike, Abby, and Vanessa. Hutcherson&#39;s desire to further flesh out the dream world could be the perfect setup.

              Related   Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2: Confirmation &amp; Everything We Know   Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 is the next installment in the FNaF live-action movie franchise, although exactly what to expect remains mysterious.    

Although Afton told Mike he killed his younger brother, there are still questions surrounding what happened the day he was lost. Mike likely won&#39;t stop in his hunt for the truth, but he may also want to revisit the dream world to try and help the ghosts of Afton&#39;s other victims. Afton could potentially bleed into this world, infecting it with his own darkness and turning the animatronics back into the killers they had become in the Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s movie.






Mike and Abby&#39;s connection to the ghosts, as well as Vanessa&#39;s personal connection to Afton, could be what pulls them back into the nightmare of this world.




It could also draw them to the sister location or a newly reopened Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza. Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s has a rich lore for the filmmakers to pull from, and the characters introduced in the first movie can be at the heart of the franchise, slowly peeling back the layers of the mystery that Afton set up many years ago.

             Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is an adaptation of the popular video game franchise of the same name, directed by Emma Tammi. The film centers around a maintenance worker handling night duties at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza, a children&#39;s amusement center home to a grizzly tragedy in its history. The animatronics come to life at night, and the worker must survive until daybreak.  Release Date   October 27, 2023    Director   Emma Tammi    Cast   Josh Hutcherson , Matthew Lillard , Elizabeth Lail , Piper Rubio , Mary Stuart Masterson , Kevin Foster , Jade Kindar-Martin , Jessica Weiss , Roger Joseph Manning Jr.    Rating   R    Runtime   109 Minutes    Genres   Horror , Thriller    Writers   Scott Cawthon , Seth Cuddeback , Emma Tammi    Story By   Scott Cawthon, Chris Lee Hill, Tyler MacIntyre    Budget   $25 Million    Studio(s)   Blumhouse Productions , Scott Cawthon Productions , Striker Entertainment    Distributor(s)   Universal Pictures    Franchise(s)   Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s
