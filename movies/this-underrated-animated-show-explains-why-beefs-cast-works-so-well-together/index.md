## Literature Review

Ali Wong and Steven Yeunâ€™s chemistry in Beef contributed to the show&#39;s success, and the two previously worked together in a lesser-known series.




Ali Wong and Steven Yeun&#39;s chemistry in Netflix&#39;s Beef is one of the best things about the comedy-drama TV miniseries, and a previous collaboration between the two actors perfectly explains why Beef was bound to be successful. Wong and Yeun star in the miniseries about Amy and Danny, two strangers, who engage in a longstanding feud with growing stakes after allowing a road rage incident to consume every aspect of their personal lives. Created by Lee Sung Jin, Beef has plenty of shocking moments and is known for its dark humor, unexpected violence, and a cautionary tale about controlling one&#39;s emotions in the heat of tense situations.




Known primarily for her comedic roles and stand-up specials Baby Cobra, Hard Knock Wife, and Don Wong, and 2019&#39;s Always Be My Maybe, Wong has established herself as one of the funniest actresses in Hollywood, thus contributing to many of Beef&#39;s best comedic moments. Additionally, Yeun sheds his image from The Walking Dead with his portrayal of the more reserved Danny, thus resulting in one of the most engaging onscreen duos in recent memory. However, Wong and Yeun&#39;s previous collaboration on a lesser-known, short-lived TV show already proved that the two actors&#39; chemistry would translate well into the cast of Beef.

                  What The Crows Mean In Netflix&#39;s Beef   Crows reoccur throughout Netflix and A24&#39;s new show Beef and they hold an important meaning for the characters.

Tuca &amp; Bertie is an animated sitcom that centers around two anthropomorphic birds named Tuca, voiced by Tiffany Haddish, and Bertie, voiced by Wong, and the daily shenanigans of their fellow anthropomorphic neighbors, friends, etc. Although Tuca &amp; Bertie is one of the Netflix animated shows canceled too soon, it has developed a loyal following due to the show&#39;s beautiful animation, strong voice-over cast, and interesting take on mature subjects like alcoholism, sex, and financial woes. More notable in Tuca &amp; Bertie is Yeun&#39;s voice-over work as Bertie&#39;s boyfriend, Speckles, another anthropomorphic bird who maintains a protective attitude over the more introverted Bertie.


 

Whereas Beef sees the two actors as forces of antagonism against one another, Tuca &amp; Bertie goes completely against the grain by presenting Wong and Yeun in a committed relationship. Bertie and Speckles undergo bumps in their relationship that test their love, but they maintain a healthy degree of respect for one another, thus resulting in a healthy portrayal of a relationship while also highlighting Wong and Yeun&#39;s chemistry earlier on. Beef, on the other hand, sees the two starting as tense enemies while gradually learning how to see each other in a more respectable light, maintaining a realistic depiction of a relationship.






 Why Beef Fans Should Watch Tuca &amp; Bertie (Despite Its Cancellation)

Although Tuca &amp; Bertie was canceled in 2022, it&#39;s still worth a watch as its art style and brand of humor offer viewers quality entertainment while also presenting them with thought-provoking subjects to consider. Additionally, the level of voice-over talent involved with Tuca &amp; Bertie displays a different side of its performers given the nature of its premise. Audiences expecting Yeun to carry over the same essence of Glenn or Invincible will be pleasantly surprised to see his much more meek Speckles. Alternatively, Wong also displays a more introverted and less frenetic energy than her character in Beef, thus showcasing her range as well.
