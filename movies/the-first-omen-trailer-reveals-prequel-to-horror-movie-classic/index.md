## Literature Review

The first official trailer has been released for The First Omen, revealing more about the terrifying upcoming prequel film from Arkasha Stevenson.




The First Omen&#39;s debut trailer has been released, teasing what&#39;s to come from the upcoming prequel film. Directed by Arkasha Stevenson, the new movie serves as a prequel to Richard Donner&#39;s iconic 1976 horror film, The Omen. Starring Nell Tiger Free, Bill Nighy, Ralph Ineson, and Sonia Braga, the prequel chronicles a young American woman&#39;s journey to Rome to begin a life of religious service, only to find herself in the midst of a demonic conspiracy.




Now, ahead of The First Omen&#39;s release date this spring, 20th Century Studios has released the first trailer for the film. Check it out below:


 

The trailer, which, in a demonic twist, features scenes played in reverse, promises a whole lot of horror to come in the prequel, with scenes teasing cult-like rituals, shocking deaths, and perhaps even the birth of the Antichrist.



Intriguingly, the end of the trailer seems to feature dialogue in reverse, with one keen-eared viewer in the comments suggesting it&#39;s the nanny&#39;s (Holly Palance) line from The Omen in which she says: &#34;Look at me, Damien. It&#39;s all for you!&#34; before she hangs herself.





 What To Expect From The First Omen 
          




The upcoming movie marks Stevenson&#39;s feature film debut, though the director previously worked on the cancelled Channel Zero horror series. Stevenson also serves as co-writer on the film alongside Tim Smith and Keith Thomas, both of whom have some horror titles under their belts. As it serves as a prequel to Donner&#39;s The Omen, the story will seemingly take place in the early 1970s, with Rome set to serve as the principal location.

While the trailer doesn&#39;t reveal what the film&#39;s MPA rating will be, the previous Omen movies have all earned R ratings, with each film featuring moments of gruesome violence and other shocking and disturbing scenes. The new trailer doesn&#39;t feature any real bloodshed, but purely from a tone standpoint, it does seem like the movie is intended for more mature audiences.

The trailer also reveals how the different members of The First Omen&#39;s cast will factor into the story. Free, for example, plays the lead role, while Nighy&#39;s Lawrence is seemingly a villainous figure intent on bringing about the birth of the Antichrist. It&#39;s not yet clear exactly how Ineson&#39;s Father Brennan, Braga&#39;s Silvia, Taweek Barhom&#39;s Gabriel, or Mia McGovern Zaini will fit into the narrative, but more is sure to be revealed as the film&#39;s April 5, 2024, release date approaches.
