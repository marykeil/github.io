# Iron Mans Original Ending Predicted Tony Starks Entire Arc And Nobody Noticed


## SUMMARY 


 

The iconic song &#34;Iron Man&#34; by Black Sabbath that played at the end of 2008&#39;s Iron Man may have predicted Tony Stark&#39;s entire MCU arc.


The lyrics of Black Sabbath&#39;s &#34;Iron Man&#34; tell the story of a man who sees the apocalypse and becomes a villain while trying to avoid this destructive future.


Tony Stark, like the character in the song, ends up causing more harm despite his attempts to avoid it, perhaps making him the villain of his own MCU story.
