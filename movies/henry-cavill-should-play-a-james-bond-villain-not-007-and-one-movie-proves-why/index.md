# Henry Cavill Should Play A James Bond Villain, Not 007 - And One Movie Proves Why


## SUMMARY 


 

Henry Cavill would be better suited as a 007 villain rather than James Bond due to his physique and previous experience playing a compelling antagonist.


Cavill&#39;s upcoming projects, including the spy thriller Argylle, offer fans the opportunity to see him in more spy roles.


Cavill&#39;s performance in Mission: Impossible - Fallout demonstrates his ability to play both sides of the secret agent dynamic and establishes him as a potential iconic action nemesis in future Bond films.
