## Literature Review

Grown Ups 3 may not have seen the light of day as a full-fledged movie, but, in some ways, it always happened three years ago - and it was perfect.




The perfect Grown Ups 3 might have already happened three years ago. Produced by Happy Madison Production, the first two Grown Ups movies had all the ingredients of a typical Adam Sandler movie â€” from an ensemble cast to slapstick humor, from everyday characters to familial themes. Similar to most Adam Sandler comedies, both Grown Ups movies did not receive favorable reviews from critics, but their box office numbers told a completely different story.




Against a budget of $75 million, the first Grown Ups movie earned close to $272 million at the worldwide box office. Grown Ups 2 continued the movie series&#39; financial success by grossing $247 million on an $80 million budget. Strangely, even though the second movie solidified that the franchise was commercially lucrative, a third movie never officially happened. Someone did, however, write an unofficial script for Grown Ups 3, which surprisingly does an incredible job at capturing the franchise&#39;s essence.

                  Happy Madison: The 5 Best (&amp; 5 Worst) Movies, According To Rotten Tomatoes   Critics have a reputation for hating Adam Sandler and the movies produced through his company, Happy Madison, but there are a few that they like too.   


 The Perfect Grown Ups 3 Script Has Already Been Written 
          

Grown Ups 3 may not have an official storyline yet, but the perfect script for the film already exists. Comedian and writer Tom Scharpling crafted a script for the movie because he had always admired the original movies and Adam Sandler&#39;s SandlerVerse. Although he wrote the script with no prior expectations and just wanted to put it out there for fun, his script went surprisingly viral online because of all the intriguing ideas it introduces and the unexpected twists and turns it brings to the movie franchise. Scharpling&#39;s Grown Up 3 follows more of a meta-narrative that initially has all the elements of a quintessential Adam Sandler comedy.




However, with a twist of events, the story reveals that it is less of a family comedy like Grown Ups 1 and 2 and more of a slasher thriller. After kicking off as just another Grown Ups movie, the film moves in a meta direction, revealing that it is about Adam Sandler and other cast members of the franchise filming the third installment of the franchise. While they are at it, a killer chases them, which seems to serve as a metaphor for the gradual collapse of the aspirations, dreams, and ambitions of the film&#39;s cast as they realize they are getting older. The script&#39;s narrative may be a little too serious in tone compared to the regular fare of Happy Madison films. However, it is still creative and hilarious enough to be considered for a real Grown Ups 3 film.



 What We Know About The Chances Of Grown Ups 3 Happening 
          




Considering the box office returns of Grown Ups 1 and 2, a third film would be a lucrative endeavor for Adam Sandler and his production company. However, no official announcements surrounding it have been made yet, and its likelihood seems low because Adam Sandler is busy with other bigger projects. The fact that Happy Madison Production has churned out several Netflix comedies with Adam Sandler as the lead in recent years but has not considered greenlighting Grown Ups 3 proves that the movie is currently not a priority for the production company.

              Grown Ups  Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider star in Grown Ups as a group of childhood friends who reunite after their basketball coach passes away. The film was a box office hit, leading to a sequel in 2013.
