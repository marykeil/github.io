# One Item From The Super Mario Bros. Movie Makes A Nintendo Cinematic Universe So Much Easier


## SUMMARY 



  The success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie opens up the possibility for more movies set in the Super Mario Bros. universe.   The use of Warp Pipes in the movie allows for connections between different worlds, suggesting the potential for a Nintendo Movie Universe similar to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   Warp Pipes have been used in other Nintendo games, like Animal Crossing, making it easier for the studios to combine different properties in future films.

## Literature Review

An important part of The Super Mario Bros. Movie can easily provide an in-story explanation when incorporating other Nintendo games into the universe.




The success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie undoubtedly gives Nintendo and Illumination an incentive to make more movies set in the Super Mario Bros. universe, and the film studios already have some projects in the works. However, one item in the 2023 animated adventure comedy film could help expand the inevitable franchise by using it in future movies to incorporate games outside of Mario. The item in question would make it much easier for the studio to combine the worlds of Mario with other Nintendo properties without having to give a convoluted (and ridiculous) explanation.




The Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive triumphant for Nintendo and Illumination when it premiered in 2023. Although the film received mixed reviews from critics, audiences everywhere thoroughly enjoyed it, and its Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes reflects that. The movie grossed around $1.36 billion, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 2023 (after Barbie) and the third-highest-grossing animated movie ever (after 2019&#39;s The Lion King and Frozen II). At the end of the day, studios don&#39;t care what critics think â€” it&#39;s all about the audience&#39;s opinions and the box office numbers. Consequentially, fans should expect a Nintendo Movie Universe in the near future.


 Super Mario Bros. Movie Connects 2 Worlds With A Warp Pipe (But There Could Be More) 
         

The Super Mario Bros. Movie connected the human world to different worlds using Warp Pipes. In the film, Mario and Luigi go underground in the sewers to see if they can fix a water main leak in Brooklyn (and finally be recognized for their plumbing work in the process). However, Mario and Luigi accidentally stumble upon a Warp Pipe, and they get sucked into it. The green tube transports Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom, while Luigi lands in the Dark Lands. As the movie goes on, more Warp Pipes can be seen, especially in Princess Peach&#39;s world, as the citizens use them to get from one place to another.




More Warp Pipes that transport individuals between worlds may exist throughout the universe (or multiverse). After all, Peach got to the Mushroom Kingdom as a little girl by walking through one of the pipes. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if there were more Warp Pipes aside from the ones that brought Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom and the Dark Lands, respectively. If this is true, Nintendo and Illumination already have an easy explanation for if (and when) the studios decide to combine Nintendo&#39;s properties.



 Illumination Can Use This Super Mario Bros. Item To Set Up A Nintendo Movie Universe 
          

It should come as a shock to no one that Illumination and Nintendo are looking to make more films together following the success of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Among the rumored (but not confirmed) projects are a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, a Luigi&#39;s Mansion film, a Donkey Kong spinoff, and a Princess Peach spinoff. All these movies fall under the world of Super Mario Bros. But the Warp Pipes&#39; presence in the 2023 animated film indicates that more Nintendo properties could enter the conversation while the studios plan for a possible Nintendo Movie Universe.




Warp Pipes could connect to other universes, like Kirby or Animal Crossing. As a result, The Super Mario Bros. Movie might only have been the start of an enormous cinematic universe, similar to how Iron Man kicked off the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Perhaps, in the future, fans will get to see the likes of Mario and Princess Peach interact with Roald and Raymond from Animal Crossing on the big screen, and that&#39;s possible because of Warp Pipes.

                  Cranky Kong Is The Key To Peach&#39;s Past In The Super Mario Bros Movie 2 - Theory Explained   The Super Mario Bros Movie 2 is likely to reveal Peach&#39;s home world, and it could connect with Cranky Kong and another canon Mario princess.   



 Other Nintendo Games Have Used Warp Pipes Or Similar Items 
          

Nintendo games outside the ones in Super Mario Bros. have incorporated Warp Pipes (or items that resemble or act like them) into their worlds. For example, Animal Crossing has introduced the same Warp Pipes from Mario that gamers can use to easily travel from one location to another in their villages. Other Nintendo games use similar items to make transport simpler for users.




Nintendo has an easy way to combine its properties in the company&#39;s upcoming film projects. But only time will tell if the executives recognize the opportunity and jump on it or make things difficult by trying to build a Nintendo Movie Universe a different way. Whatever the case, Warp Pipes will undoubtedly come back as a significant device in the inevitable reveal of where Princess Peach came from in another Super Mario Bros. Movie.



The Super Mario Bros. Movie is available to stream on Netflix.
