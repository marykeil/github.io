# Where Margot Robbie s Harley Quinn Could Appear In James Gunn s DC Universe


## SUMMARY 



  Harley Quinn could potentially appear in &#34;The Brave and the Bold&#34; Batman film, bringing a new dynamic to her conflicted relationship with the Dark Knight.   Margot Robbie&#39;s return as Harley Quinn in the upcoming &#34;Waller&#34; TV show makes sense due to the established connection between Quinn and Amanda Waller in the DCEU.   Reviving the shelved &#34;Gotham City Sirens&#34; project in the DCU would provide the perfect story for Harley Quinn&#39;s appearance, rectifying the disappointment of its cancellation in the DCEU.

## Literature Review

Margot Robbie could be set for renewed Harley Quinn appearances in James Gunnâ€™s DCU, but which projects would the character best fit into?




Margot Robbie&#39;s tenure as Harley Quinn may continue, leading many to wonder which of James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe projects the character could appear in. Now that the DCEU has come to an end, attention will quickly turn to James Gunn&#39;s slate of DC movies and shows. With Creature Commandos likely to be the first DCU TV release in 2024 and Superman: Legacy set to kickstart the rebooted franchise&#39;s theatrical projects, there are several upcoming DC movies and small-screen stories on the horizon.




Recently attention has turned to which characters from the DCEU could transition to the DCU now that the former has ended. One of these characters is the DCEU&#39;s Harley Quinn with many hoping Margot Robbie will return to play the character after appearing in 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad, 2020&#39;s Birds of Prey, and 2021&#39;s The Suicide Squad. In January 2024, Gunn commented on Harley Quinn&#39;s DC Universe future, seemingly hinting that Robbie has a place in DC films going forward. This begs the question of which potential stories Robbie could appear in as Harley Quinn from both the announced slate and projects that could yet be placed into production.


 

 



 Harley Quinn Could Appear In The Brave And The Bold Movie 
Quinn&#39;s past with The Dark Knight could see her play a role in the DCU&#39;s first Batman film.
          




The first potential project in which Harley Quinn could appear is The Brave and the Bold. This movie was announced by Gunn in January 2023 as part of the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1: Gods and Monsters and will introduce the franchise&#39;s new iteration of Batman. In the DCEU&#39;s various projects, Quinn is shown to have conflicts with Batman via her relationship with the Joker, meaning she has been a villain of the Caped Crusader in the past. This means that the DCU could bring in a new dynamic between Batman and Harley Quinn, with the latter terrorizing the franchise&#39;s revamped version of Gotham City.

                  New Batman Movie: The Brave &amp; The Bold Story, Cast &amp; Everything We Know   DC Studios will introduce an important new version of Batman in The Brave and the Bold. Here&#39;s everything we know about the upcoming DC Universe film.   

Utilizing Margot Robbie in The Brave and the Bold would be a smart move on Gunn&#39;s part. Much like Superman: Legacy will use characters like Hawkgirl, Metamorpho, Guy Gardner, and Mister Terrific to flesh out the DCU as a lived-in universe, Brave and the Bold will likely do the same. Using Harley Quinn as an established rogue of Batman would achieve this effect, all while boosting the excitement for the film by including an actress as fantastic and renowned as Robbie in a role that was universally beloved in the DCEU.






 Margot Robbie Could Return As Harley Quinn In The Waller TV Show 
A former acquaintance of Harley Quinn could lead to the character&#39;s DCU appearance on the small screen.
         

One of the characters that has already been confirmed to transition between the DCEU and DCU is Viola Davis&#39; Amanda Waller. This was confirmed by Gunn who revealed that Davis would star in her own TV show simply titled Waller. The show is expected to include other former DCEU members from the HBO Max show Peacemaker, meaning the connections to the prior franchise will be overt concerning Amanda Waller&#39;s upcoming DCU story.

As such, Harley Quinn makes sense as one of the characters who could appear in the Waller show. The reason for this stems from the established albeit antagonistic relationship between Waller and Quinn in the DCEU. The latter character worked for the former in both Suicide Squad and The Suicide Squad. This could provide the foundation for Quinn to appear in Waller should the titular character need more firepower from someone she has worked with in the past.




                  Waller: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know About The Suicide Squad Spin-Off   With the James Gunn announcing that Waller would get her own spinoff in the DCU, details about the cast have been revealed. Here&#39;s everything we know.   



 Harley Quinn Could Join A Gotham City Sirens Movie 
The DCEU&#39;s broken promise could become a reality in James Gunn&#39;s DCU.
          

Throughout the DCEU&#39;s tumultuous reign, several projects were announced but never came to fruition. One of these projects spawned from 2016&#39;s Suicide Squad, with David Ayer reportedly returning to direct a Gotham City Sirens movie. In DC Comics, Gotham City Sirens refers to the team-up between three infamous criminals of the city: Catwoman, Poison Ivy, and Harley Quinn. The DCEU project was announced in December 2016 after Robbie&#39;s debut as Quinn in Suicide Squad with the actress set to return for the spin-off. Geneva Robertson-Dworet was hired to write the script for Gotham City Sirens, though production never began and the film was not released before the DCEU&#39;s ending.




That said, this project could easily be revived in the DCU. If James Gunn were to either hire new creatives to craft a Gotham City Sirens movie or even revive the project with Ayer and Robertson-Dworet in the DCU, it would provide the perfect story for Harley Quinn to appear. The film could even be set up in Brave and the Bold by a Quinn appearance alongside the establishment of Poison Ivy and Catwoman in the new franchise. Not only would this make for an exciting new film, but it would rectify the disappointment of the DCEU&#39;s version never being fulfilled.



 Margot Robbie Could Star In A Solo Harley Quinn Movie

Finally, another potential DCU project that could star Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn is a solo movie focusing on the character. Throughout her career, Robbie has made it abundantly clear that she can lead a movie with ease. From Barbie to I, Tonya, Robbie&#39;s screen presence is more than strong enough for her to be positioned as a lead in the DCU. Similarly, the character of Harley Quinn has been made all the more popular with general audiences by Robbie&#39;s performances in the DCEU.




All of this means that a Harley Quinn solo movie could be the best course of action for introducing Robbie&#39;s character to the DCU. Furthermore, this possibility would offer more of an opportunity to explore the character of Harley on a deeper level. While both Suicide Squad movies and Birds of Prey did this to an extent, Robbie spearheading a solo film as Quinn would naturally offer more character development. This would also be more beneficial to Robbie&#39;s character than something like a Gotham City Sirens project.

Birds of Prey proved that Harley Quinn had a wealth of depth to explore as did The Suicide Squad. Not only that, but both films managed to explore Harley&#39;s character more deeply while still providing the whacky, zany antics the character is known for in DC Comics. In a solo movie, this could be done on an even bigger scale while giving Robbie and the character the platform they deserve. As such, a solo Harley Quinn movie might prove to be the best course of action for transition the character between the DCEU and James Gunn&#39;s upcoming DC Universe.
