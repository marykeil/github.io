## Literature Review

Denzel Washington&#39;s addition to the Gladiator 2 cast is incredibly exciting, but the movie also represents a significant career first for the actor.




Denzel Washington is making a huge career first with his upcoming role in Gladiator 2. Following the confirmation that Ridley Scott was indeed making a Gladiator sequel after 20 years, the movie began to take shape with an exciting cast list headlined by Paul Mescal. One of the best pieces of news came with the reveal that Denzel Washington had landed a role in Gladiator 2&#39;s cast. It makes the movie a reunion between Washington and Ridley Scott following their previous collaboration with 2007&#39;s American Gangster. The wait to see them work together again has increased anticipation for Gladiator 2.




The interest in seeing Denzel Washington in Gladiator 2 is not deterred despite the lacking amount of details about his actual role. It has been confirmed by Ridley Scott that Washington&#39;s character is a former slave who has now earned his freedom through the gladiator arena. He&#39;s said to be extremely wealthy and looking to get revenge on the people who wronged him in the past. Considering how selective Denzel is about what movies he tackles, his decision to play this part in Gladiator 2 shows how great it could be. But, it is also something he&#39;s never done before.


 Gladiator 2 Is Denzel Washington&#39;s First Time Joining An Existing Franchise 
          

The significance of Gladiator 2 comes with it being the first time Denzel Washington has joined an existing franchise. He has had roles in remakes before, like The Magnificent Seven, and even has a few sequels under his belt, thanks to the Equalizer movies. However, he has never previously been in a franchise sequel where he was not in the previous installment. The supremely talented star has instead preferred to be part of original or standalone films. These roles always give him a chance to craft new characters and performances and often be the central star of a production.




Gladiator 2 is not the first time that Denzel Washington has been approached about joining an existing franchise, though. Universal approached Denzel about joining Fast &amp; Furious, with him originally eyed to play the part of Mr. Nobody in Furious 7, which eventually went to Kurt Russell instead. While he turned down that opportunity, Gladiator 2 must have had a strong enough part that he could not pass up the sequel. Denzel Washington choosing Gladiator 2 to be the first sequel in an already-established franchise he would join indicates how special of a project he believes it might be.

The intriguing element of Denzel Washington joining Gladiator 2 is that it could signal a shift in his career and mindset. Whereas he might have previously been more hesitant to join a franchise that was already successful, the actor might now have an interest in doing more of them if the Gladiator 2 experience is good. That would potentially open the door for Denzel Washington to join Marvel or DC. He could even begin to consider seeking out roles in other franchises. If that is what happens, there will certainly be no shortage of franchises that want Denzel Washington aboard.
