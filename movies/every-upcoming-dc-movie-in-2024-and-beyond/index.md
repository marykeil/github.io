## Literature Review

Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.





There are plenty upcoming DC movies to come in 2024 and beyond, with a wide array of films being in various stages of development at the newly-established DC Studios. Fundamentally, 2024 represents a new beginning for DC&#39;s on-screen installments, as the stage begins to be properly set for the start of James Gunn&#39;s rebirth with 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy. Alongside that, of course, is the Batman annex Matt Reeves is handling with the upcoming The Batman Part II and Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s Joker sequel.
With Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash,Blue Beetle, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom all now released, 2023&#39;s DC movie slate is complete, as is the DCEU movie timeline. For 2024, only Todd Phillips&#39; Joker: Folie à Deux is set in stone, but 2025 onwards will see Gunn and Safran fully take the reins, as Superman: Legacy kick-starts the new DCU alongside several projects already announced to revitalize the subsequent shared universe. Here&#39;s every DC movie coming in 2024, and the full list of DCU movies set to release in the coming years.
  Every DC Movie Released In 2023    Release Date    Shazam: Fury of the Gods   March 17, 2023    The Flash   June 16, 2023    Justice League: Warworld   July 25, 2023    Blue Beetle   August 18, 2023    Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom   December 22, 2023    









 








 1  Joker: Folie à Deux - October 4, 2024 


 







2019&#39;s Joker was one of DC&#39;s biggest success stories, reaching critical acclaim and earning a number of accolades, including two Academy Awards for Best Original Score and Best Actor for Joaquin Phoenix. Though initially conceptualized as a standalone feature, a sequel, Joker: Folie à Deux, was announced to be in development in May 2021, set to release on October 4, 2024, DC&#39;s only release in that year. Todd Phillips&#39; Joker franchise takes place in DC&#39;s Elseworlds category, so isn&#39;t affected by the reset of the main DC Universe, meaning a completely fresh and separate story can unfold.
Joaquin Phoenix is set to reprise his role of Arthur Fleck, a.k.a. Joker, and Zazie Beetz is also set to return from the first film. Alongside Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey, Lady Gaga will also be introduced in Joker: Folie à Deux as Harley Quinn, with set photos implying her portrayal could be an incredibly sinister version of the character. Joker: Folie à Deux is also expected to be a movie musical, taking on a completely different genre to its gritty and dark predecessor - though there&#39;s no doubt the sequel will still have these qualities in spades.





 2  Superman: Legacy - July 11, 2025 
Main DC Universe Timeline


 







After Waller and Creature Commandos kick-start James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s new DC Universe on the small screen, the upcoming Superman: Legacy is set to be the new franchise&#39;s first feature film. Scheduled for release on July 11, 2025, Superman: Legacy will replace Henry Cavill&#39;s DCEU Man of Steel with David Corenswet, introducing a new Superman for the rebooted DCU. Crucially, Superman: Legacy will not be a retelling of Superman&#39;s origin story. Instead, this installment will focus on Clark Kent balancing his Kryptonian heritage with his Kansas upbringing, already working as a reporter for the Daily Planet, and already having met main characters such as Lois Lane. The film is written and directed by Gunn himself.
Alongside David Corenswet&#39;s new Man of Steel, Superman: Legacy&#39;s cast will be headed by Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane (after her breakout performance in The Marvelous Ms. Maisel). James Gunn promised that his new Superman would arrive in a world already populated by superheroes, and delivered immediately with the news that Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion playing Guy Gardner), Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), and Metamorpho (Anthony Carrigan) are all confirmed for Superman: Legacy.





 3  The Batman Part II - October 3, 2025 
DC Elseworlds Project


 







Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman was intended to kick-start a new trilogy of standalone DC projects focused on the Caped Crusader, so the confirmation of a sequel was inevitable. The Batman - Part II is set for release on October 3, 2025, and will be a DC Elseworlds project, continuing the story of the 2022 original and the upcoming Penguin series. Robert Pattinson will reprise his role of Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman, though not much else is known about the film. Current speculation suggests The Batman - Part II could adapt DC Comics&#39; No Man&#39;s Land storyline, which sees Gotham City become a battlefield in the wake of a catastrophic earthquake.





 4  Watchmen - 2024 
Animated Movie
        

Despite two adaptations also existing, Warner Bros are once more adapting Alan Moore&#39;s seminal comic book event, with an animated Watchmen movie coming in 2024. The movie will adapt the original twelve issues between September 1986 and October 1987, and follows Zack Snyder&#39;s 2009 movie take and HBO&#39;s short-lived 2019 TV adaptation. Watchmen will release direct to streaming in 2024.





 5  Justice League: Crisis On Infinite Earths - 2024 
DC Animated Universe
        

Announced alongside Watchmen, the next WB DCAU release is the first feature length adaptation of Justice League: Crisis On Infinite Earths, which was almost part of Walter Hamada&#39;s rumored plans for the DCEU before its reset. The upcoming animated movie is based on the landmark 1985 DC comic book crossover, long considered to be one of the most important ever published. Like The Flash, Justice League: Crisis On Infinite Earths is another multiverse event, and follows the 2023 release of Justice League: Warworld. The same voice cast should return including Jensen Ackles&#39; Batman, Stana Katic&#39;s Wonder Woman, and Darren Criss&#39; Superman.





 6  Batman Azteca: Choque De Imperios - TBA 
Animated Movie
        

Batman Azteca: Choque De Imperios provides a fresh take on the Dark Knight&#39;s lore based in the Aztec Empire, following the story of Yohualli Coatl as he takes on the Spanish Conquistadors after they murder his parents. Batman has seen many wonderful reminagings, with iterations being steampunk geniuses, trapped in Lovecraftian versions of Gotham, and occaisonally becoming a cyborg - so Batman Azteca: Choque De Imperios is set to follow in one of DC&#39;s most iconic traditions even as it fleshes out exciting new lore. The movie is set to release on Max, allowing audiences to experience more adventures of the Caped Crusader prior to the release of The Batman - Part II in 2025 and The Brave And The Bold.





 7  The Authority - TBA 
Main DC Universe Timeline
        

The Authority was announced by James Gunn on January 31, 2023, and while it doesn&#39;t yet have an attached release date, the film will be part of the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1, titled Gods and Monsters. The Authority is a very different type of superhero team for DC, as they often go to extreme methods to get the job done, so The Authority is expected to take inspiration from Amazon Prime Video&#39;s The Boys. Though no writer or director has yet been attached, Gunn did confirm that the team would have connections to the DCU&#39;s new Superman, who&#39;s set to debut in 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy.





 8  The Brave And The Bold - TBA 
Main DC Universe Timeline
        

The Brave and the Bold is set to reboot the character again, placing a new actor in the role of Bruce Wayne, separate from Ben Affleck and Robert Pattinson&#39;s iterations. While there&#39;s no current release date set, The Brave and the Bold will introduce Damian Wayne, Bruce Wayne&#39;s estranged son, to the DCU as a version of Robin. The film will be based on Grant Morrison&#39;s 2006 - 2013 run of Batman in DC Comics, but there hasn&#39;t been much more news about the development of the project since Gunn&#39;s January 2023 announcement.





 9  Supergirl: Woman Of Tomorrow - TBA 
Main DC Universe Timeline
        

Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow was also announced by James Gunn in January 2023, though no release date has yet been set. In stark contrast to Superman, Supergirl was raised on Krypton and witnessed horrific events for fourteen years before making her way to Earth. Gunn promised a very different take on Supergirl, making her a much more formidable force than previous iterations of the character. There&#39;s been no news on casting for Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and its unclear what this project means for The Flash&#39;s Sasha Calle, though it appears the character will be rebooted completely.





 10  Swamp Thing - TBA 
Main DC Universe Timeline
        

Swamp Thing is expected to be an honest-to-goodness horror film for the DCU, exploring the dark origins of the mysterious Swamp Thing, based on Alan Moore&#39;s 1984 The Saga of the Swamp Thing storyline from DC Comics. James Mangold, who had previously expressed interest in working with Gunn and Safran in the DCU, was quickly attached to the project as writer and director. Despite being darker, Swamp Thing will still be connected to the rest of the DCU, proving that Gunn and Safran aren&#39;t afraid to play with genre in the development of their new franchise.

Every Other DC Movie In Development
        

Prior to the creation of DC Studios in November 2022, several other projects had been in development. While some of these might never come to fruition, others could easily be folded into James Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe or be produced as DC Elseworlds projects akin to The Batman and Joker franchises. Potential DC projects seem to come and go, some only forming as rumors and others being canceled only a few months before their supposed release, such as Batgirl. Here are all the rumored upcoming DC movies:
Black Canary 
was announced to be in development in August 2021 after the release of 
Birds of Prey
. The Max-exclusive film would see Jurnee Smollett reprise her role of Dinah Lance, a.k.a. Black Canary. In June 2022, Smollett revealed the film was still in development. 
Constantine 2
, a sequel to the 2005 cult classic, was announced in 2022, with Keanu Reeves set to return as the titular character. However, following the creation of DC Studios, it&#39;s unclear whether production on this project will still go ahead. 
Deadshot
, a spinoff of 2016&#39;s 
Suicide Squad
, had been in development since the latter&#39;s release, and Will Smith was expected to return as Floyd Lawton, a.k.a. Deadshot. However, he left the project in 2019, and production was delayed even further after Smith&#39;s Oscars controversy. 
Gotham City Sirens 
would have seen the return of Margot Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn teaming up with Catwoman and Poison Ivy. This project seems to have stalled following the financial failure of the similar team-up project 
Birds of Prey.
Hourman
 was reported to be in development in March 2021, written by Gavin James and Neil Widener, but not much else has been heard of this project since its announcement. 
Lobo
 has been in development since 2009, though has never come to fruition, and has passed through a variety of directors including Guy Ritchie, Brad Peyton, and Michael Bay. 
Aquaman
 actor Jason Momoa expressed interest in portraying the character, though Gunn and Safran confirmed he wouldn&#39;t play two different characters in the DCU&#39;s future. 
The Metal Men
, much like 
Lobo
, has been in development at DC for a long time, first being announced in 2007 with Barry Sonnenfeld attached as director. In 2022, Gunn and Safran confirmed they had plans for the team in the DCU&#39;s future, despite its remarkably long development. 
Nightwing
 was originally in development though it now appears to be in production limbo. The project is set to be directed by 
The LEGO Batman Movie&#39;s
 Chris McKay, based on a script from 
Ozark&#39;s 
Bill Dubuque. 
Plastic Man
, a female-centered comedy-action adventure film was announced in December 2018, with Cat Vasko hired to rewrite an initial script penned by Amanda Idoko, though it&#39;s unclear what stage of production this film is currently at. 
Static Shock
 was originally announced in 2020, with Michael B. Jordan attached as a producer. Randy McKinnon was brought on to rewrite the script, but the current status of Virgil Hawkins&#39; big-screen debut is unclear. 
 Ta-Nehisi Coates&#39;
 Black Superman
 was announced in 2021, putting a Black version of the Man of Steel front-and-center with Coates as writer and J.J. Abrams attached as a producer. Should this project still be produced for DC Studios, it will be a DC Elseworlds project rather than part of the main DCU continuity.
