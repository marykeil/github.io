## Literature Review

Wonka is an even bigger blockbuster hit than expected, breaking several box office records for its franchise, its star talent, and the post-COVID era.




Wonka has proven to be an even bigger box office smash than expected, breaking several records for its franchise, its star talent, and the post-COVID era. This prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stars Timotheé Chalamet as a young, ambitious Willy Wonka during his rise to fame and fortune. Although Wonka initially seemed like it might be a shameless cash-grab, it ended up being a really sweet, earnest, beautifully made movie. Thanks to positive word-of-mouth amongst families looking for the right film for a trip to the movies over the holiday season, Wonka has been a massive blockbuster success.
At the end of a year in which proven franchises like Fast &amp; Furious, Mission: Impossible, and even the Marvel Cinematic Universe have disappointed, Wonka managed to top the box office. It arrived as a timely reminder to Hollywood studios that the only sure-fire way to get audiences back in movie theaters is to hire a passionate filmmaker to tell a great story with lovable characters, dazzling visuals that demand to be seen on the big screen, and an infectious sense of fun. Wonka’s box office run isn’t over yet, but it’s already broken a handful of records.

 4  Wonka Is The Highest Grossing Willy Wonka Movie 
And, by extension, the highest grossing Roald Dahl adaptation


 







With a $507.9 million worldwide gross (via Box Office Mojo), Wonka has surpassed Tim Burton’s Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to become the highest grossing movie featuring Willy Wonka – and, by extension, the highest grossing film adaptation of a Roald Dahl property. From Matilda to Fantastic Mr. Fox, films based on Dahl’s literary works have traditionally underperformed at the box office, but audiences have always responded to the Wonka character. Ever since Gene Wilder made this eccentric chocolatier a cinematic icon, audiences have been intrigued to see other famous actors deliver their take on the character.
Since Netflix has acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company, it’ll probably be a long time before Wonka is topped as the biggest Dahl adaptation ever made. Most of the upcoming Dahl movies will be released exclusively on Netflix’s streaming service. Netflix might give some of these movies a theatrical release, either to make a few extra bucks or to qualify for Oscar consideration, but they likely won’t garner the half-a-billion-dollar returns of Wonka. So, it looks like Wonka will hold onto this record for a while.





 3  Wonka Became Timotheé Chalamet&#39;s Biggest Movie As A Lead 
But Interstellar is still his biggest movie overall
        

Thanks to franchises and I.P.s dominating the box office, the traditional movie star is quickly becoming a thing of the past. But Timotheé Chalamet’s career is definitive proof that actors can still rise to A-list status based on their own merits, without having to don a cape or pick up a lightsaber. Chalamet has the best of both worlds, with the indie cred to appear in smaller movies like Lady Bird and Call Me By Your Name and the mainstream recognition to appear in bigger movies like Dune and Don’t Look Up.
The enormous box office success of Wonka has made it Chalamet’s highest grossing movie as a lead (via The Numbers). Wonka has outperformed the previous record holder, Dune, by more than $100 million. Christopher Nolan’s sci-fi epic Interstellar is still Chalamet’s highest grossing movie overall. Interstellar was just Chalamet’s second movie and it made a whopping $731 million. The success of Wonka – paired with the upcoming success of Dune: Part Two, which is almost a guarantee – will surely lead to more starring roles in big-budget movies in the future.





 2  Wonka Was The First Post-COVID Live-Action Musical To Top The Box Office 
Post-COVID box office success stories are even more impressive
        

The theatrical exhibition industry took a massive hit in the COVID-19 pandemic. Lockdowns forced movie theaters to close their doors and studios moved up the streaming releases of their films, so a lot of casual moviegoers got used to watching new movies at home. Huge hits like Barbie, Oppenheimer, Top Gun: Maverick, and Spider-Man: No Way Home have proven that audiences will still come out to theaters if a film feels like a cultural event, but a lot of movies that would’ve done well pre-COVID have bombed at the box office post-COVID.
The musical genre has struggled to make a post-COVID comeback, with both Steven Spielberg’s West Side Story and Jon M. Chu’s In the Heights bombing at the box office. Between Wonka and the musical reimaginings of Mean Girls and The Color Purple, the movie musical has been enjoying a moment in recent months. While Mean Girls and The Color Purple have both performed well, Wonka performed so well that it became the first live-action musical to top the box office in the post-COVID era.
There’s been a lot of discussion lately about how viable musicals are at the box office, because studios have been afraid to market their musicals as musicals. In the trailers for Wonka, Mean Girls, and The Color Purple, the musical elements are kept to a minimum to instead focus on the movies’ star-studded casts and stunning visuals. This is a questionable practice, because even if they can trick audiences who don’t like musicals into watching them, the resulting word-of-mouth will be resoundingly negative. Either way, it worked out for Wonka, because it became the biggest post-COVID live-action musical.





 1  Wonka Is Paul King&#39;s Highest Grossing Movie 
Wonka grossed about the same as both Paddington movies combined
        

Wonka’s box office isn’t just a new career-best for Chalamet; it’s the highest grossing movie for its director, too. Paul King made his feature directorial debut with the twisted dark comedy Bunny and the Bull, but he’s come a long way since then. After the success of Bunny and the Bull, King was entrusted with the beloved I.P. of Paddington Bear and made two modestly budgeted Paddington movies back-to-back. Then, he took on his first nine-digit budget to helm Wonka. Wonka was the biggest risk of King’s career to date, but the biggest risks yield the biggest rewards.
The first Paddington movie made $282,370,135 at the worldwide box office (via Box Office Mojo), while Paddington 2 grossed a global total of $227,291,591 (via Box Office Mojo). The combined gross of both Paddington movies comes out to around $510 million, which is just a couple of million dollars higher than the current worldwide total amassed by Wonka. If Wonka can rake in another million or two, then it’ll surpass the gross of both Paddington movies combined.
