Exclusive: Star Connie Nielsen teases details about Nobody 2 and her excitement to return for the sequel to Bob Odenkirk&#39;s sleeper action hit.


Summary

  Bob Odenkirk&#39;s &#34;unbelievable energy&#34; and &#34;fun and sweet&#34; personality made him a beloved presence on the set of Nobody.   The movie&#39;s success on Netflix is a positive sign for the sequel, indicating strong audience interest in both Odenkirk and the property.   The sequel has the potential to fill the void left by the conclusion of the John Wick franchise, offering grounded action and exploring different aspects of the Nobody world.  





As the wait continues for the movie, Connie Nielsen shares some new insight for Nobody 2. The 2021 action-thriller centered on Hutch Mansell, a seemingly average family man who is revealed to be a former government assassin and must put his skills to use when he runs afoul of a local Russian mobster, putting his family and his secrets in danger. With an ensemble cast led by Bob Odenkirk, Nobody was a modest hit upon its release, garnering largely positive reviews for its action sequences, dark humor and Odenkirk&#39;s performance, and grossing over $57 million against its $16 million production budget, earning a sequel order in late 2022.




While speaking with Screen Rant for the similarly-premised action-thriller Role Play, Connie Nielsen was asked about the development of Nobody 2. The star heaped praise on Odenkirk for his &#34;unbelievable energy&#34; and bringing a &#34;fun and sweet atmosphere&#34; to the first movie&#39;s set, while also teasing new details regarding the family&#39;s changed dynamic following Hutch&#39;s secret life coming to the surface. Check out what Nielsen shared below:


Who doesn&#39;t love Bob? Bob is just so cool and fun and sweet, and he has unbelievable energy. I adore him. That guy is just so great. And then, on top of that, you have this family again. I&#39;m a family person and I love depicting the tensions inside of a family; the natural tensions, but also the sweetness that underlies the love that connects all of these people together. This is a great family. It&#39;s a great story that I look forward to returning to, definitely.



 Nobody&#39;s Recent Netflix Success Is A Great Sign For The Sequel 
         




While it may not have broken new genre ground in the same vein as Keanu Reeves&#39; John Wick movies, from which producer David Leitch launched his directing career on, Nobody proved to be a unique continuation of that franchise&#39;s influence on the action world. Much like Reeves, Odenkirk devoted much of his effort into filming the movie&#39;s fight sequences himself, with the physical training even going so far as to later save him when he had a heart attack filming Better Call Saul&#39;s final season. Having John Wick creator Derek Kolstad as the script&#39;s writer also lent the 2021 movie a unique sense of worldbuilding for its criminal underworld and Hutch&#39;s past to open the door for future sequels.

                  Nobody Ending &amp; Post-Credits Scene Explained: How It Sets Up Nobody 2   Bob Odenkirk&#39;s Nobody ends on an explosive note. Here&#39;s everything that goes down in the movie&#39;s finale, along with its mid-credits scene.   

It&#39;s unclear who on the behind-the-scenes creative team are returning for Nobody 2, but the original movie&#39;s recent success on Netflix proves a promising sign for the sequel being produced even sooner than before. There were originally plans for it to shoot sometime in 2023, though the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes led to it being delayed. With Odenkirk&#39;s first post-Better Call Saul show, Lucky Hank, being cancelled by AMC after just one season, his schedule should be open now to shoot the movie.




The first movie&#39;s streaming success also shows that audience interest remains strong in both Odenkirk and the property, giving more confidence for Universal to move ahead with Nobody 2. Given the John Wick franchise has closed its doors for the time being following Chapter 4, aside from the upcoming spinoff Ballerina, Odenkirk&#39;s sequel would also go a long way to filling the void left by Reeves&#39; movies, giving more of the grounded action audiences fell in love with in the first two movies and exploring more unique elements of the Nobody world, including how Hutch&#39;s family adjust to knowing of his skills.

              Nobody  Bob Odenkirk stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad, and husband, taking life’s indignities on the chin and never pushing back. However, when two thieves break into his suburban home, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son is disappointed in him, and his wife seems to pull only further away - but the incident triggers the underlying rage in Hutch, leading him down a path to become a dangerous man with brutal skills and the attitude to match.     Release Date    March 26, 2021     Director    Ilya Naishuller     Cast    Paisley Cadorath , J.P.
