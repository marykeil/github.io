## Literature Review

The cast of Andor, Star Wars&#39; latest Disney&#43; series, is filled with faces both familiar and new. Here are all the characters &amp; their actors explained.




The beloved Star Wars Disney&#43; series, Andor, has a cast of characters packed full of faces both familiar and new to audiences. Andor serves as a prequel to Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, following the character of Cassian Andor long before he meets Jyn Erso and steals the plans for the Death Star. Taking place five years before the events of Rogue One, it follows a cast of characters as they slowly come together to form what will become the official Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire.




Andor is ambitious, not only the longest Disney&#43; Star Wars series at 24 episodes in total, but also much darker in tone and action. Andor season 1 received largely positive reviews, with critics and viewers alike praising its departure from the typical, formulaic Star Wars story and its more adult tone. Andor boasts a lineup of incredibly talented actors, from veterans of the industry to new faces that have since become breakout stars - and yes, its own lovable droid. Here&#39;s the cast of Andor and all the characters explained.

                  Andor Season 2: Story, Updates, &amp; Everything We Know   Andor season 1 ended with an explosive finale, leading many to wonder what season 2 has in store for the characters of Star Wars’ most exciting show.   


 Diego Luna as Cassian Andor 
         




In Andor, Diego Luna returns as the titular character, Cassian Andor, to whom audiences were first introduced in Rogue One. Cassian lives on the rough-and-tumble planet of Ferrix, and is known as a scoundrel to the town: a wastrel, a swindler, and a guy who doesn&#39;t always make the best decisions. When he is involved in a crime one night, Luna&#39;s Cassian Andor gets on the Empire&#39;s radar. But someone is soon to offer him a chance to do something more with his life.

Luna is best known to TV watchers as Miguel in Narcos: Mexico, and the voice of Krel in the Tales of Arcadia series. Beyond Rogue One, movies he&#39;s known for include Elysium, Milk, The Terminal, The Book of Life, and If Beale Street Could Talk, among others. Luna also serves as an executive producer on Andor, alongside showrunner Tony Gilroy.



 Stellan Skarsgård as Luthen Rael 
          




Veteran character actor Stellan Skarsgård takes a turn in Andor as the wily Luthen Rael. On the surface, Luthen acts as a collector and something of a black market dealer. His real aim, however, is to quietly build the seeds of rebellion. His meeting with Cassian Andor has changed both their lives, and potentially the fate of the galaxy itself.

Skarsgård is well-known to geek culture lovers from his recurring role as Dr. Erik Selvig in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He&#39;s also beloved for his turns in, among other things, Dune, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Angels &amp; Demons, Mamma Mia!, the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Good Will Hunting, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang, and so many more. Skarsgård&#39;s performance in Andor season 1 has been one of the show&#39;s most highly praised thus far, particularly for his iconic monologue in episode 10, &#34;One Way Out.&#34;


 






 Kyle Soller as Syril Karn 
          



 
Syril Karn, played by Kyle Soller, is a major antagonist in Andor. As a young and ambitious Imperial officer, he is uptight and zealous in his duty. He develops something like an obsession with Cassian Andor, determined to catch him for his crime, but it&#39;s not clear he&#39;s up to the task. In TV, Soller is best-known for his work in You, Me and the Apocalypse, as well as from playing Francis Poldark in Poldark. Some of his movies include Fury, The Fifth Estate, and the 2012 adaptation of Anna Karenina.

                  BBY 5 Explained: Andor&#39;s Timeline Is More Important Than You Realize   Andor takes place in BBY 5, a point in the Star Wars timeline that&#39;s significant not only for the Rogue One prequel, but other events in the galaxy.   



 Genevieve O&#39;Reilly as Mon Mothma 
         




The Star Wars faithful welcome back another familiar face in the form of Genevieve O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Mon Mothma. As a savvy politician in the Imperial Senate, Mon Mothma is also one of the most important architects of what will become the Rebellion. Along with Luthen Rael, she plays a key role in helping to turn the tide against the Imperial regime.

O&#39;Reilly has previously appeared as Mon Mothma in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, Ahsoka, and voiced her character in Star Wars: Rebels. In other movies, one can spot her in The Kid Who Would Be King, Tolkien, and The Legend of Tarzan. TV series include Episodes, Glitch, and Tin Star. Some may be surprised to learn she also voices the character of Moira in the video game Overwatch.



 Adria Arjona as Bix Caleen 
          




Adria Arjona plays new character Bix Caleen in Andor. Bix is a longtime ally of Andor&#39;s and one of the few friends who hasn&#39;t given up on him. She has a shop selling starship parts, but also has a foot in the shadowy underworld of smuggling. As the story unfolds, she finds herself pulled into the same rebellion as Cassian.

Arjona is a rising star in Hollywood, with a number of big movies already under her belt, including Morbius, 6 Underground, Pacific Rim: Uprising, The Belko Experiment, and Triple Frontier. Audiences will also recognize her from her work in True Detective, the short-lived Emerald City, and Good Omens.



Fellow Star Wars stars Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron) and Pedro Pascal (Din Djarin, The Mandalorian) also starred alongside Arjona in Triple Frontier.






 Fiona Shaw as Maarva 
          




The legendary Fiona Shaw takes a surprising turn in Andor as Maarva. Maarva is a wily ship raider who adopted Cassian when he was young and taught him all she knows. While she doesn&#39;t condone Cassian&#39;s shadier activities, she loves him dearly. As a former leader of Star Wars&#39; proto-Rebellion, Maarva has become part of the new uprising as her son gets drawn into events, despite her declining health.

Shaw is one of the UK&#39;s most beloved actresses. She&#39;s best known to audiences for her longtime role as Petunia Dursley in the Harry Potter franchise, as well as for playing Marnie Stonebrook in True Blood and Carolyn Martens in Killing Eve. She also can be spotted in Channel Zero, Enola Holmes, The Tree of Life, and more. After Andor, she&#39;ll next be seen as Maeve Livingstone in the adaptation of Neil Gaiman&#39;s Anansi Boys.



 Forest Whitaker as Saw Gerrera 
          




Similar to Mon Mothma, Forest Whitaker&#39;s Saw Gerrera is known to Star Wars audiences, having first appeared in Rogue One before later voicing his character in Star Wars: Rebels and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. In Andor, he returns again to help Luthen Rael and Mon Mothma build the Rebellion. His extreme methods, however, create a rift between the early cells of the Rebellion, posing problems for the blooming Rebellion effort.

Whitaker is a veteran name in Hollywood, having won an Oscar for his turn as Idi Amin in 2006&#39;s The Last King of Scotland. Other movies in his resume include The Color of Money, Good Morning, Vietnam, Platoon, The Crying Game, Repo Men, The Butler, Arrival, and Zuri in Black Panther. On the TV side of things, Whitaker has had major roles in Godfather of Harlem, Empire, The Shield, and the Criminal Minds franchise, to name just a few.

                  Upcoming Star Wars Shows: Story, Casts &amp; Everything We Know   Several exciting Star Wars TV shows are set to be released on Disney&#43; in the coming years from the realm of both live-action and animation.
