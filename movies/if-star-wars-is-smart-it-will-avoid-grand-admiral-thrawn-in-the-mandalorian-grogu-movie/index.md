# If Star Wars Is Smart, It Will Avoid Grand Admiral Thrawn In The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie


## SUMMARY 



  The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu should avoid including Grand Admiral Thrawn to prevent over-reliance on the villain and allow for a focused story on the main characters.   The film could feature other members of The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s Imperial Shadow Council as primary antagonists, such as Captain Pellaeon or Brendol Hux.   This approach would save Grand Admiral Thrawn for his big-screen debut in Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming movie, ensuring his importance is not diminished.

## Literature Review

Star Wars has announced an upcoming Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, though if Lucasfilm is smart, Grand Admiral Thrawn will be absent from the story.




If Lucasfilm is smart, the newly-announced The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will leave Grand Admiral Thrawn out of the story. In a shocking turn of events, it was announced that The Mandalorian season 4 is being reworked as an upcoming Star Wars movie. Jon Favreau announced that the scripts for The Mandalorian season 4 had been written as far back as February 2023 before season 3 had even been released, though the delay in confirmation for the fourth outing can now be attributed to the reworking of the story as a feature film.




Star Wars&#39; The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie is set to be a different film than the one announced at Star Wars Celebration directed by Dave Filoni. Filoni&#39;s film is still expected to be the culmination of Star Wars&#39; New Republic timeline, while the Jon Favreau-directed The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is another stepping stone on the journey. Given this, it would be smart of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu to avoid the inclusion of Star Wars&#39; Grand Admiral Thrawn, the theorized and likely villain of Dave Filoni&#39;s New Republic theatrical release.

                  Who Is Grand Admiral Thrawn? Star Wars Villain Origin &amp; Future   Ahsoka Tano is working hard to prevent the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn - but who is the Empire&#39;s warlord, and why is he so important?   


 Star Wars Could Overdo It With Grand Admiral Thrawn If He&#39;s In The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu 
          




The reason as to why The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu should arguably not feature Grand Admiral Thrawn lies in the confirmation of Ahsoka season 2 and the reaffirmation that Filoni is still working on his New Republic film. Given that Thrawn is heavily expected to be involved in both projects after Ahsoka season 1 introduced the character to live-action Star Wars, the franchise could risk over-relying on the villain should he also be included in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Therefore, utilizing The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu as exactly what the title promises - a story centered squarely on the two titular characters - is undoubtedly the better course of action for Lucasfilm.



 Who Could The Villain Of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Be Instead? 
          

This raises the question then, of who the villain could be in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Regarding the film&#39;s story, it will undoubtedly carry on from where The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s ending left off. At the end of the duo&#39;s most recent Disney&#43; journey, Mando and Grogu began living peacefully on Nevarro in an official adoptive father-son relationship. What&#39;s more, Din unofficially pledged himself to the New Republic&#39;s cause, offering his services to Carson Teva in hunting down Imperial remnants in the Outer Rim. With that in mind, it is expected that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu continue this journey of Din and Grogu&#39;s Imperial bounty-hunting exploits.






This all but proves that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has several villain candidates besides Grand Admiral Thrawn...




This means that the film could include other members of The Mandalorian season 3&#39;s Imperial Shadow Council as its primary antagonists. One such example is Captain Pellaeon, the man steadfastly loyal to Grand Admiral Thrawn whom Din and Grogu could target to put a dent in Thrawn&#39;s plans. Another potential villain is Brendol Hux, the man responsible for working on Project Necromancer and an instrumental figure in the First Order&#39;s rise to power. This all but proves that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has several villain candidates besides Grand Admiral Thrawn, saving the latter for his big-screen debut with Dave Filoniâ€™s upcoming movie.
