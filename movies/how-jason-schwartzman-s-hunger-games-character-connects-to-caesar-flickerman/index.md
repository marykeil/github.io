## Literature Review

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes reveals Caesar Flickerman&#39;s Hunger Games host predecessor—and they have much more in common than their jobs. 




Jason Schwartzman plays Lucky Flickerman in The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes — a character whose surname will sound familiar to Hunger Games fans. Lucky is a weatherman and amateur magician who also serves as the official host of the 10th Hunger Games, just as Caesar Flickerman did during Katniss&#39; 74th and 75th Games. This is certainly not a coincidence, and the Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes books provide some clues about how these characters would be connected.




Few characters in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes that also appear in Katniss Everdeen&#39;s story, since the Hunger Games prequel is set approximately 65 years earlier. A younger Coriolanus Snow is at the center of the story, but aside from this, the individuals who work as part of the Games are new to audiences. Still, this isn&#39;t to say there aren&#39;t several familiar surnames. Characters from the Heavensbee, Crane, and Cardew families, to name a few, are all briefly mentioned. However, Lucky Flickerman makes for one of the most obvious connections, not only because of his name, but also the role he plays in the Hunger Games themselves.

Lucky Is An Important Character In The Evolution Of The Hunger Games
          




Jason Schwartzman&#39;s Lucky Flickerman is a brand new character in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. He was a weatherman for Panem&#39;s Capitol until he was asked to become the first-ever host of the annual Hunger Games. This was an important step in the history of the brutal events. Before the 10th Games, the yearly battle to the death between District children had been a spectacle that even the Capitol citizens despised, and most refused to watch. This inspired those who organized the Games to rethink how they presented the Hunger Games — and they turned it into a major festivity.

The first step in this change to the Hunger Games was televising the event in a way that would appeal to Capitol audiences, so Lucky Flickerman was brought in to commentate and entertain during the low points of the fights. It wasn&#39;t much fun to watch the District tributes hunker down and fight for survival on their own, so the host would discuss tactics, interview mentors, give weather reports, and even do some magic tricks to keep Capitol citizens glued to their screens.




                  What Happened To Every Surviving Hunger Games Character After Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes   Though The Hunger Games prequel didn&#39;t show it, here is what happened to every surviving character in The Ballads of Songbirds &amp; Snakes.    



 Is Lucky Flickerman   To Stanley Tucci&#39;s Caesar? 
The Movie Includes A Hint At Their Relation
          

Since Lucky Flickerman shared a surname with Caesar Flickerman, it can be assumed that he is a relative. Some fans even speculated that Lucky was Caesar and that he changed his name in future years hosting the Games. However, this would not be likely, since Caesar is revealed in The Hunger Games to have been the host for 40 years, not the 65 years that had passed since Lucky hosted the 10th Hunger Games.

The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes never specifies how these two characters are related but there is a subtle reveal in the movie as Lucky calls to change his restaurant reservations and mentions it is dinner for two with a highchair. This hints that Caesar was born, and he is indeed Lucky&#39;s son. The movie further embraces this idea in casting Schwartzman who shares quite the resemblance to actor Stanley Tucci who played Caesar Flickerman in the original movies.




                  Is Lucy Gray Baird   To Katniss Everdeen In Hunger Games?   The Hunger Games’ prequel introduces a new protagonist, Lucy Gray Baird, leading to questions of whether she is related to Katniss Everdeen.   



 What Happened To Caesar Flickerman In The Hunger Games 
Was Caesar Loyal To Snow Or Just Playing A Part?
         

Caesar Flickerman, unlike his ancestor Lucky, was easy to like and highly skilled at presenting the District tributes in the best light possible. Even Katniss, whose first instinct was to despise the Capitol citizens, always felt Caeser was on her side. Of course, once the District rebellion was in full swing, Caesar was quick to call Katniss a traitor and criminal and publicly celebrated her supposed Hunger Games death. After President Snow&#39;s downfall, Caesar&#39;s fate was never revealed. However, given President Coin&#39;s methods, it can be assumed that he was assassinated for his role in Snow&#39;s Panem.




Of course, it&#39;s difficult to know what Caesar&#39;s true feelings were regarding President Snow. The man was an ever-smiling mask who never missed a beat and used his position on Panem&#39;s screens with great care. Ultimately, the reveal that Caesar&#39;s relative had been his predecessor sheds a little more light on the character&#39;s loyalties. Coriolanus Snow despised Lucky Flickerman in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, and if he &#39;did away with&#39; the silly host and replaced him with his son or grandson, Caeser would have learned early on what would have happened if he didn&#39;t perform precisely to Snow&#39;s standards.
