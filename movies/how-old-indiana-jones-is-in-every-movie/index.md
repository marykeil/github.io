# How Old Indiana Jones Is In Every Movie


## SUMMARY 



  Indiana Jones&#39; age has never been explicitly stated in the movies, but thanks to the spinoff show The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, it can be determined that he was born in 1899.   The Indiana Jones films are not in chronological order and cover various periods of the character&#39;s life, from his formative years to retirement.   In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Harrison Ford was de-aged for flashback scenes that take place in 1944, making Indy 45 years old during those events.

## Literature Review
The Indiana Jones films take place out of chronological order and span multiple decades, making it difficult to track the archeologist&#39;s age.


Summary

  Indiana Jones&#39; age has never been explicitly stated in the movies, but thanks to the spinoff show The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, it can be determined that he was born in 1899.   The Indiana Jones films are not in chronological order and cover various periods of the character&#39;s life, from his formative years to retirement.   In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Harrison Ford was de-aged for flashback scenes that take place in 1944, making Indy 45 years old during those events.  






Harrison Ford has played iconic archeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones across five movies as of 2023&#39;s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, but none of them state how old Indian Jones is. With the first part of the film series set during the buildup to World War II, Indiana Jones often battled the Nazis in exotic lands full of mystery, death, and, unfortunately, snakes. The Indiana Jones films take place out of chronological order and span most of the character&#39;s life, which can make keeping track of the intrepid archeologist’s age a bit difficult.

In Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Indy is shown at different parts of his life and Ford was de-aged for some scenes. This allows Ford to turn in a great performance as both the older, crotchety Indy and the younger devil-may-care version of the character. With Indiana Jones appearing in one form or another since he was a teenager, the entire franchise takes a look at an adventurer from his formative years to retirement, though doesn&#39;t state his specific age. Thankfully, because of spinoff show The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, it&#39;s possible to work out Indiana Jones&#39;s age in every movie.
