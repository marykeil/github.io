# This Video Game Movie Is The Perfect John Wick Replacement (&amp; Better Than John Wick 5 With Keanu)


## SUMMARY 


 

The success of the John Wick franchise should not be prolonged with a fifth film, but should instead open the door for a new action franchise with Ghost of Tsushima.


Chad Stahelski&#39;s direction and practical stunt work are what truly excite audiences, which will make any story he tackles engaging and thrilling.


Building a Ghost of Tsushima franchise would be a better career move for Stahelski, allowing him to showcase his range as a filmmaker beyond the John Wick series.
