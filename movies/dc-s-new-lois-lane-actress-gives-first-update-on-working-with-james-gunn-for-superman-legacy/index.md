## Literature Review

Rachel Brosnahan has commented on her Superman: Legacy role, revealing how she and David Corenswet are preparing to play Clark Kent and Lois Lane.




Superman: Legacy Lois Lane actress Rachel Brosnahan describes what it is like to work with James Gunn to prepare for the DC Universe movie. Brosnahan will play Lois Lane across David Corenswet&#39;s Superman in Gunn&#39;s Superman: Legacy. The duo has made few to no comments about Superman: Legacy since they were cast, but Brosnahan has now shined a light on their process to prepare for the film.




Speaking to ExtraTV on the red carpet of the Golden Globes, Brosnahan revealed how she and Superman: Legacy&#39;s Clark Kent actor Corenswet are getting ready for the reboot of the Man of Steel.


 

According to the actress, she and Corenswet are having constant talks with Gunn &#34;about where this project fits into the canon of the Supermen&#39;s that we know.&#34; While the duo is looking to past versions of Lois and Clark to help orient their portrayal of the characters in the upcoming DCU film, Brosnahan says that they want to put their &#34;own stamp on things.&#34; Check out the full quote below:


&#34;We&#39;ve been having a lot of great conversations, David and I with James Gunn, the director, and we&#39;ve been talking a lot about where this project fits into the canon of the Supermen&#39;s that we know. So, hopefully, this will be putting our own stamp on things.&#34;





                  Every Actor Cast In Superman Legacy (So Far)   Superman: Legacy will be the first film released in James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s DC Universe, and the Man of Steel reboot boasts an impressive cast.   


 What To Expect From Lois Lane &amp; Clark Kent In Superman: Legacy 
          

While the core story of Superman: Legacy has yet to be revealed, Gunn has shared some tidbits about how the movie will portray Clark Kent and Lois Lane. Superman: Legacy might feature multiple DCU heroes; however, that does not mean that the character&#39;s life as Clark will suffer due to that. Gunn has made a few comments about how important Corenswet&#39;s dual performance as Clark and Superman will be for the movie.

Superman: Legacy will divide its main character&#39;s life in two, with Superman interacting with the other DCU heroes while Clark works at the Daily Planet with Jimmy Olsen and Brosnahan&#39;s Lois Lane. Brosnahan&#39;s Lois will not have her role affected by the movie&#39;s large scope, with Gunn clearly stating in the past that &#34;Superman and Lois are the very clear protagonists&#34; of Superman: Legacy. Based on that, Brosnahan&#39;s Lois will already have a bigger part than Amy Adams&#39; had in the DCEU.




Corenswet&#39;s Clark Kent will have to deal with his Kryptonian and human side in the movie, which should leave plenty of room for Brosnahan&#39;s Lois Lane to shine through. Given how the actress is known for portraying wit like no other in The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, DC fans can expect the DCU&#39;s Lois Lane to be as sharp-tongued as she is in the comics. And with Corenswet having commented years before he was cast that he wanted a new Superman to be lighter like he is in the comics, Superman: Legacy should bring forward new takes on the characters but with the same feel of the beloved, classic Superman stories.











Superman: Legacy releases in theaters on July 11, 2025.
