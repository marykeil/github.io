## Literature Review

Jack Fisk is a talented production designer who has created the sets and practical visuals of some of the most acclaimed movies in the last 30 years. 




Jack Fisk is a prolific and incredibly talented production designer who has built the sets for many iconic directors&#39; films. A production designer is responsible for the overall look of a movie in the practical sense. While a cinematographer is responsible for positioning the camera and capturing the scene, a special effects supervisor for determining how visual computer effects integrate into the movie, and a director for bringing the film&#39;s vision together, it&#39;s the production designer (and often their deputy known as the &#34;art director&#34;) who will take scenes from the script and recreate them on a set or on location, utilizing carpenters, artists, prop designers, and more.
Though visual effects are so important, production designers are not properly lauded. However, the work of artists like Jack Fisk is still highly sought after by any director hoping to make a visually stunning creation. His first credit as an art director on the movie Angels Hard as They Come (1971), and his talent was quickly recognized by director Terrence Malick whom he&#39;s worked with several times. Fisk&#39;s thoroughly researched set designs reward pausing his movies at any instant, allowing his meticulous details to be closely examined. From his collaborations with Paul Thomas Anderson to Martin Scorsese, each film Fisk works on has a mesmerizing look.
            
 
 The 10 Cinematographers With The Most Oscar Nominations 
From Joseph Ruttenberg to Roger Deakins, these iconic cinematographers have earned several Oscar nominations and wins.












 








 10  Phantom Of The Paradise (1974) 
A rock opera from Brian De Palma.
        

Phantom of the Paradise is one of Brian De Palma&#39;s earlier movies and his first collaboration with Fisk. The movie, a rock musical comedy horror, is a confusing but fascinating look at the style De Palma was perfecting. Fisk showed his talent for working under a small budget and repurposing existing sets in the movie. As it takes place in a theater hall, Fisk combines many different theatrical elements for purposefully low-budget-looking sets, that culminate in the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari-inspired showpiece. Fisk&#39;s mix of horror and grandeur has always been a signature of his work, and it&#39;s plainly seen here.







 9  Movie Movie (1978) 
A throwback double feature.
        

Jack Fisk did the production design for both movies in this double feature. Movie Movie, by Stanley Donen, is an experimental film that tries to replicate the double-billed films of classic Hollywood. A boxing movie, &#34;Dynamite Hands&#34;, and a 1930s musical, &#34;Baxter&#39;s Beauties of 1933&#34; combine to form a nostalgic and propulsive film that&#39;s an admiring look back at the &#34;Golden Age of Hollywood&#34;. Fisk cleverly, and period accurately, reuses sets from one movie to the next, building a visual motif that runs through the entire double feature. He showcases an ability to take the themes a director is going for and present them in the art direction.

 8  The Master (2012) 
Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s funny and odd cult picture.
        

  The Master  


  Release Date    September 14, 2012     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Amy Adams , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Laura Dern , Ambyr Childers , Rami Malek , Jesse Plemons , Kevin J. O&#39;Connor     Genres    Drama    


In Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s The Master, a World War II veteran, Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix), falls in with a charismatic cult leader, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), only to become disillusioned with the religion and its leader. The film takes place in drabby townhomes, bars, boats, and manors set in San Francisco, the East Coast, and England, and Fisk&#39;s designs make each location unique. The construction of the rooms where the cult meets are cavernous and wooden, much like the ships Freddie fought on and the one he met Dodd on. Their design is intimidating but also ridiculous with how sparse they are considering the supposed wealth of the cult.







 7  Days Of Heaven (1978) 
Fisk creates the star of the movie: the manor house.
        

Days of Heaven takes place primarily in one lonely location and yet Fisk manages to turn that singular setting into something amazing. Terrence Malick&#39;s romantic period movie follows a young poor couple who travel to Texas to harvest a wealthy farmer&#39;s crops. However, the movie was filmed in Alberta, Canada, and Fisk manages to recreate the panhandle with a striking and memorable manor home built in the middle of a field of wheat. Fisk meticulously built the interiors and exteriors of the mansion, giving cinematographer Néstor Almendros unparalleled angles to shoot from, creating the gorgeous aesthetic of the movie.

 6  Mulholland Drive (2001) 
David Lynch&#39;s surreal and colorful mystery thriller.
        

  Mulholland Drive  


  Release Date    October 19, 2001     Cast    Laura Elena Harring , Mark Pellegrino , Justin Theroux , Naomi Watts , Ann Miller     Genres    Mystery , Thriller , Drama    


David Lynch movies often take place in real locations, but the plots are so psychedelic that these settings feel warped and dream-like. Mulholland Drive, for instance, takes place in Los Angeles, the title being a reference to the actual road in the Hollywood Hills. Fisk designs both the grim LA flophouses to represent the dark underside of the city and the flashy, bubble gum-like soundstages and mansions to represent the wealthy half. The backdrops are magical and brightly painted, and the interiors are delightfully retro, reminiscent of the 1950s. It&#39;s these colorful and starkly contrasted sets that help Lynch&#39;s surreal story feel plausible.

 5  The Thin Red Line (1998) 
Malick&#39;s gripping, contemporary war epic.


 







Another Malick collaboration, The Thin Red Line depicts US marines fighting in the Pacific during World War II. A philosophical, violent, and moving war epic, The Thin Red Line is one of the first movies to feel like a contemporary war picture. Fisk had the difficult duty of designing sets on location in the jungles of Australia where the movie was filmed, (via The ASC). He and his crew built villages and camps, both undamaged and destroyed, that feel like they have been in the jungles for decades. Nothing looks out of place or intentional in the ramshackle army camps, and the destroyed villages and bunkers are appropriately depressing.

 4  The New World (2005) 
A carefully crafted and expertly designed film about the Jamestown colony.
        

Fisk was able to try his hand at 17th-century set design in Malick&#39;s The New World. The film depicts the founding of the Jamestown settlement and the relationship between Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q&#39;orianka Kilcher). This historical tale has some of the most astonishing cinematography in Malick&#39;s filmography, largely in part due to Fisk erecting the structures of the Jamestown camp in the manner they would have been by the settlers. The resulting ugly, slapdash village is much more realistic than any other movie set during that time. There are moments in The New World that feel more like documentary with the organic set design.

 3  Killers Of The Flower Moon (2023) 
Martin Scorsese&#39;s biographical tale about the murders of Osage Indians.


 







  Killers of the Flower Moon  


  Cast    Leonardo DiCaprio , Louis Cancelmi , Jillian Dion , Scott Shepherd , Jesse Plemons , JaNae Collins , Robert De Niro , Jason Isbell , Cara Jade Myers , Lily Gladstone     Genres    History , Drama , Crime    


In Killers of the Flower Moon, Fisk&#39;s first collaboration with Martin Scorsese, Osage County, Oklahoma is recreated in vivid and beautiful detail. Scorsese&#39;s epic, winding, and disturbing Killers of the Flower Moon is filled with behind-the-scenes details, but what&#39;s on-screen is even more intricate thanks to Fisk&#39;s production design. He used personal insights and intense research to design the look of a film that collides ancient Osage beliefs and traditions with colonist and capitalistic enterprise. A prime example is Mollie Kyle&#39;s (Lily Gladstone) enormous but empty house. Fisk searched old court records to determine what her house would look like.
&#34;Following the lead to Lizzie’s probate records, he tracked down a five-bedroom home on the reservation... Fisk thought the house’s modesty, its open floor plan and many bedrooms, reflected Burkhart’s restraint, her embrace of her family.&#34; (via New York Times). It&#39;s this ability to dig deeper and uncover more that has made Fisk&#39;s sets as memorable as the movies that are filmed inside them.

 2  The Revenant (2015) 
Fisk, DiCaprio, and Iñárritu had a difficult shoot.
        

  The Revenant  


  Release Date    December 25, 2015     Cast    will poulter , Leonardo DiCaprio , Paul Anderson , Tom Hardy , Domhnall Gleeson     Genres    Adventure , Drama    


The Revenant not only earned Leonardo DiCaprio his first Academy Award for Best Actor, but it also gave Fisk only his second Academy Award nomination for Best Production Design. There is no better example of Fisk&#39;s ability to build on location than in his work on the famously difficult shoot for The Revenant. The film required a fur trapper&#39;s village, an Old West town, and an Arikara village as part of director Alejandro G. Iñárritu&#39;s efforts to correctly replicate the 1800s Dakotas. Fisk&#39;s remarkably real set designs are only upstaged by his work building snowbanks and maintaining snowfalls that dominate the movie, presumably a Herculean task.

 1  There Will Be Blood (2007) 
Fisk&#39;s incredible picture of capitalism and the American West.


 







  There Will Be Blood  


  Release Date    December 26, 2007     Cast    daniel day-lewis , Russell Harvard , Ciarán Hinds , Dillon Freasier , Paul Dano , Kevin J. O&#39;Connor     Genres    Epic , Drama    


Jack Fisk earned his first Academy Award nomination for his art direction on Paul Thomas Anderson&#39;s 2007 epic There Will Be Blood. This sprawling Western follows Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he becomes the biggest oil magnate in America. There are jet-black oil rigs set against orange and blue skies, desolate oil towns that look like the wind could knock them over, and a monstrous mansion that appears to have come out of time just for the movie. Every surface is carefully designed and manages to both be of the early 20th century and timeless, adding to the almost mythical nature of the movie.
