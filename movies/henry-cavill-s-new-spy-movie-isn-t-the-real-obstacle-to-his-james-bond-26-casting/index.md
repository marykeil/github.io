# Henry Cavill s New Spy Movie Isn t The Real Obstacle To His James Bond 26 Casting


## SUMMARY 



  Argylle and the Bond franchise are completely different in tone and style, making it unlikely that Cavill starring in one would prevent him from being considered for the other.   Cavill&#39;s age may be a bigger obstacle for him to become the next James Bond, as he is already older than Daniel Craig was when he started in the role.   Despite being previously considered for the part, it seems unlikely that Cavill will ever get to play Bond, regardless of his involvement in Argylle.

## Literature Review

With Henry Cavill set to appear in another spy movie, many feel his chances of being Bond are over. However, the new film isn&#39;t the real problem.




Although he&#39;s long been fated as the natural successor to Daniel Craig in the James Bond franchise, Henry Cavill&#39;s separate upcoming spy movie isn&#39;t the main reason why a Superman/007 casting crossover wouldn&#39;t work. For years, Cavill&#39;s easy charm, good looks, and compelling screen presence have made him a bookies&#39; favorite to become the next iteration of Britain&#39;s famous super spy. Alongside the likes of Tom Hardy and Idris Elba, he consistently tops lists of actors best suited to be the next James Bond. However, developments around a separate venture into the spy movie genre have seemingly poured cold water on any prospects of Cavill picking up a Walther PPK any time soon.




Slated to release in February 2024, Argylle is a genre-bending comedic thriller directed by Matthew Vaughan – the man behind projects such as Kick-Ass and Kingsman: The Secret Service. The film sees Cavill star as fictional spy Agent Argylle, a character created by Bryce Dallas-Howard&#39;s Elly Conway, a successful author. The fact that Cavill is starring in a spy movie that, superficially at least, looks very similar to the Bond series has led many to conclude that he now has no chance of appearing in both franchises. However, despite the obvious comparisons, Argylle and Bond&#39;s shared DNA isn&#39;t the main reason that Cavill is unlikely to feature as 007.

                  When Will The Next James Bond Actor Be Announced?   Exactly who will fill the role of the iconic superspy has been a huge point of contention, but when will the next 007 actor be announced for Bond 26?   


 Why Argylle May Not Matter To Henry Cavill&#39;s James Bond Chances 
The movies are completely different
         




Despite sharing a genre, the reality is that Argylle and Bond operate at opposite ends of the spy movie scale. Under Craig&#39;s stewardship, Bond was defined by a gritty, ultra-realistic approach to its action and characters, eschewing some of the flamboyant touches pioneered by the likes of Roger Moore for a more believable tone. Argylle has a different attitude. Stuffed with Vaughan&#39;s bombastic visuals and signature humor, the movie is determined not to take itself too seriously, focusing instead on a twisted story-within-a-story plot and off-beat humor typified by Sam Rockwell&#39;s quippy Aiden Wilde. While the future direction of the increasingly serious Bond franchise is uncertain, it&#39;s highly unlikely that the as-yet-unnamed Bond 26 will follow in Argylle&#39;s footsteps.

This means that, should Cavill wish to pursue an opportunity as Bond, Argylle shouldn&#39;t be an obstacle. The two projects are simply too different tonally and stylistically for anyone to seriously accuse either Cavill or Bond&#39;s producers of playing to type. In much the same way as August Walker in Mission: Impossible – Fallout didn&#39;t stop Cavill from being cast in Argylle due to the differences in film and character, Argylle wouldn&#39;t be a legitimate reason to discount him from Bond. That said, just because Argylle wouldn&#39;t necessarily hurt his chance, it doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;s guaranteed the part.






 Henry Cavill Probably Wouldn&#39;t Be The Next James Bond Even Without Argylle 
There are bigger obstacles in the way
          

While Henry Cavill might once have been a serious contender to play James Bond, times have changed. If the Bond franchise is looking for a long-term incumbent for the role, to follow Craig&#39;s 16-year stint, the sad truth is that Cavill is now probably too old for such a commitment. At 40 years of age, he&#39;s already two years older than Craig was when Casino Royale released in 2006. Considering that production on Bond 26 has not yet even begun, Cavill would be older still, placing further restrictions on his potential time in post.

                  Henry Cavill&#39;s Big New Spy Movie Looks Nothing Like James Bond (&amp; That&#39;s Good)   Henry Cavill is starring in a huge new spy movie. Fortunately, his secret agent looks nothing like James Bond, which is good for him and his fans.   




A second important consideration is that Cavill has already been considered, and rejected, for the part of Bond. Before Craig was confirmed, a 22-year-old Cavill was in serious contention for the role. However, it was felt that he was too young, and by the time he reached the correct age, Craig had already made the part his own. Considering his past affiliation with the James Bond franchise, and pedigree as an action star, it&#39;s easy to see why many believe Cavill to be a natural choice. Unfortunately for him, it seems unlikely that he will ever get to play Bond, through no fault of his decision to star in Argylle.
