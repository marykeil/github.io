## Literature Review

Recent comments from Margot Robbie regarding her Ocean&#39;s prequel may be disheartening, but the update is not necessarily bad news for the project.




Margot Robbie&#39;s latest update regarding her Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel sounds disappointing; however, this may not be all bad news for the movie. After the success of Barbie, it seemed like the Ocean&#39;s franchise may be the actress&#39; next project, but her recent comments suggest the film could be far away. Robbie shared an update on the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel&#39;s development, stating, &#34;Well, that&#39;s still in development. We didn&#39;t release anything because it&#39;s way too soon.&#34; With the project being announced in mid-2022, it wouldn&#39;t be unreasonable to assume that production would be further along than Robbie suggested, which raises slight concerns about when the film will now be released.




The Barbie star also claimed, &#34;Whether it winds up being the next thing, I don&#39;t know&#34;, which indicates that she may feature in other projects before the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel releases. From Robbie&#39;s comments, it can be assumed that the movie is still a long way away and in the early development stages. This is disheartening for fans of the franchise and those excited about the prequel, yet the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel update isn&#39;t all bad news. While it is true it will probably be a while before the movie hits theaters, there are several reasons why this is a promising sign for the project.



The Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel is Margot Robbie&#39;s only confirmed upcoming acting role.





 Margot Robbie&#39;s Ocean 11 Prequel Update Is Disappointing (But Not Necessarily Bad) 
          




Although Margot Robbie&#39;s update regarding the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel is disappointing, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Since there hasn&#39;t been a release date given for the movie, it hasn&#39;t been officially delayed, but the seemingly lengthier production does give the film a chance to be properly worked on. Rather than attempting to rush the prequel out to fit its targeted schedule, taking time to make sure it is high-quality and fully developed is the right choice. It also grants the opportunity for Margot Robbie&#39;s Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel to fix some franchise problems and not run into the same issues the more recent films have faced.

Alongside giving the movie the best chance to thrive, the longer production will also help its marketing. Both Robbie and her Ocean&#39;s co-star, Ryan Gosling, were already big stars before last year, but 2023 elevated their status even more. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling&#39;s Barbie success is perfect for the Ocean&#39;s prequel as they have already shown that they have a lot of chemistry. Their dynamic in Barbie was great and proved popular among fans of the film. By waiting longer to reunite them, people will start to miss the duo on screen, making their return together all the more impactful.






 Margot Robbie &amp; Ryan Gosling&#39;s Reunion Will Be More Exciting After More Time Apart 
         

More time apart will make the appetite to see Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling&#39;s reunion even bigger. There is still a lot of buzz around the duo after their performance together in Barbie, but they haven&#39;t had a long time apart just yet. Although some time has passed since the movie was released, Robbie and Gosling have still appeared together on award shows and interviews since Barbie debuted. Awards season has only just gotten started as well, meaning there will still be more public appearances from the pair and a few more Barbie and Ken references before they move on to their next projects.

Robbie doesn&#39;t have any other acting roles in the pipeline, but she will act as a producer in a few upcoming projects. The Fall Guy will be Gosling&#39;s next big movie which releases in May, and only then will their on-screen dynamic begin to be missed. There is also a large chance that Barbie 2 won&#39;t happen after Margot Robbie outlined the difficulties of a potential sequel. As time passes, the chances of a Barbie sequel will likely diminish, making the enthusiasm for Robbie and Gosling&#39;s reunion even greater. This plays perfectly into the hands of the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel as it will entice fans who miss the duo after their time apart.




                  Margot Robbie &amp; Ryan Goslingâ€™s First Collaboration Was 8 Years Before Barbie In $133M Box Office Hit   8 years before tackling the roles of Barbie and Ken in Greta Gerwig&#39;s billion-dollar hit, Robbie &amp; Gosling appeared in another big film together.   



 Why The Ocean&#39;s 11 Prequel Shouldn&#39;t Wait Too Long To Reunite The Barbie Stars 
          

Despite the Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel most likely benefiting from the Barbie stars&#39; absence on screen, the movie shouldn&#39;t wait too long to reunite them. The project must find the right balance between not coming too soon but also not waiting too long. Of course, it is important the film takes time to ensure it is ready and not released before its finished, but the Barbie buzz will wear off eventually. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie&#39;s Ocean&#39;s 11 prequel must avoid the mistake of letting people move on from Barbie, as it can be a big marketing tool despite the films being so different. However, it should still wait long enough that people actually miss Robbie and Gosling&#39;s dynamic.
