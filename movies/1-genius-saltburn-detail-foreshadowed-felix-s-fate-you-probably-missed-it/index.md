Summary

  The breakfast scene in Saltburn subtly foreshadows Felix&#39;s death through the mention of Percy Shelley&#39;s doppelgänger.   Oliver&#39;s reflections throughout the film and his unsuccessful rock throw hint at his lies and deceit.   Venetia&#39;s overflowing wine cup during breakfast mirrors her death in the bathtub after slitting her wrists.  







Saltburn is packed with subtle details that foreshadow Oliver’s (Barry Keoghan) real intentions, but there’s a genius yet easy-to-miss detail that foreshadows Felix’s (Jacob Elordi) tragic fate. Among the best movies of 2023 is the black comedy psychological thriller Saltburn, written and directed by Emerald Fennell. Saltburn has been a hit with critics and general audiences, more so after its quick arrival to streaming thanks to Amazon Prime Video, and with a wider audience comes closer attention to the many hidden details throughout the movie.

Set in the early 2000s, Saltburn follows Oliver Quick, a scholarship student at the University of Oxford who befriends wealthy student Felix Catton, who invites him to spend the summer at his family’s estate. Oliver becomes obsessed with Felix, and the more time he spends at Saltburn with Felix’s family, the more obsessed he becomes with Felix, his family, and their lifestyle. Saltburn has various shocking moments and plot twists, but one in particular, related to Felix’s fate, was subtly but brilliantly foreshadowed during Oliver’s first breakfast with the Cattons at Saltburn.





 Saltburn&#39;s Breakfast Scene Subtly Foreshadowed Felix&#39;s Death 
          

Oliver had his first interactions with the Cattons at Saltburn when he arrived and they were all watching a movie at the library, and they later had dinner together. However, more important than their first dinner is the next day’s breakfast, where, after an awkward moment between Oliver and Duncan, the butler, Felix tells Oliver they were talking about the biography of poet Percy Shelley, with Venetia sharing the story of his housekeeper who saw Shelley’s doppelgänger. According to Venetia, the housekeeper saw Shelley walk past the window and he waved at her, and when the housekeeper waved back at him, she remembered she was on the top floor and Shelley was in Italy. Hours later, Shelley drowned.

As noted by ThereAreTooManyMovies on TikTok, as Venetia says “Shelley walked past the window”, Felix’s doppelganger walks past the window behind her. Felix’s double is wearing the same pink shirt Felix is wearing at that moment, and the real one is sitting next to Venetia. When Venetia reveals the part where Shelley couldn’t have walked past the window, Felix covers his ears and tells her to stop.




Felix’s doppelgänger and the story of Percy Shelley’s housekeeper foreshadowed Felix’s death, and adding to it is when, after Felix’s death, during breakfast, Duncan asks Mr. Catton if he can close the curtains as the coroner was outside and was going to go past the window with Felix’s body, but he struggled to close the curtain from the window where the doppelgänger had been seen days before.



 How Saltburn Foreshadowed Oliver&#39;s Lies &amp; The Deaths Of Felix &amp; Venetia 
          

As mentioned above, there are many details throughout Saltburn that foreshadow Oliver’s intentions and the tragic fates of the Cattons, particularly Felix and Venetia. At different points in Saltburn, Oliver’s reflection is shown, either in fragments caused by light or mirrors, and in some scenes, like one of the dinners at Saltburn, his reflections don’t match. When Oliver throws a rock into the river in honor of his supposedly deceased father, as Felix told him it was a tradition in his family, the rock doesn’t fall into the river and lands on the side, hinting at Oliver’s lies as it’s later revealed his father is alive and well. 




As for Venetia and her death, during the breakfast scene after Felix’s death, when Duncan is closing the windows, Venetia pours wine into her cup and it overflows but she doesn’t stop, and this scene ends up mirroring her death in the bathtub after slitting her wrists. Many of Saltburn’s little details are easy to miss, inviting the audience to rewatch the movie a couple more times.
