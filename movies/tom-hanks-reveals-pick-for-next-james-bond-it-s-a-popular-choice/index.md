## Literature Review

As rumors continue to swirl regarding who will be the next James Bond, Tom Hanks now weighs in and shares his ideal candidate for the role.




Tom Hanks shares his thoughts on who the next James Bond should be, naming a very popular candidate. After first taking up the role in 2006&#39;s Casino Royale, Daniel Craig bid farewell to 007 with 2021&#39;s No Time To Die. Since then, it&#39;s largely been unclear who will be next to don the tuxedo and drive the character&#39;s iconic Aston Martin, with a number of actors seemingly in the running. Countless names of names have been bandied around when speculating about who the next James Bond should be - from frontrunners like Henry Cavill to wildcard choices like Harry Styles - and now Tom Hanks has weighed in.




As the Bond saga turns a new page post-Daniel Craig&#39;s gritty and nuanced portrayal, the quest for his successor has been a hot topic. Tom Hanks&#39; selection is particularly noteworthy, considering his industry experience and a keen eye for cinematic flair and talent. The suggested actor, praised for his versatility and magnetic screen presence, has already proven his mettle in roles that demand a blend of action, wit, and depth - qualities essential for the next agent 007. With Hanks&#39; endorsement, the buzz around this candidate for the next James Bond has intensified, adding a layer of celebrity backing to what many believe is an inevitable and well-deserved casting decision.

                  Bond 26: Who Could Play Bond &amp; Everything We Know   The Daniel Craig 007 era is ending with the release of No Time to Die, but what comes next? Here&#39;s everything that&#39;s been revealed about Bond 26.   


 Tom Hanks Thinks Idris Elba Should Be James Bond 
Elba Is A Popular Choice For The Spy 
         




As the search for the next James Bond continues, Hanks now reveals his ideal choice for the role in a recent interview with BBC News (via Variety). According to Hanks, popular fan-cast film star Idris Elba is the man for the job. Check out Hanks&#39; full comment below:


“Understand this, James Bond has a licence to kill. I would issue that licence to Idris Elba just based on the work that I’ve seen him do.”


Hanks, known for his astute assessments and a career that includes a plethora of critically acclaimed performances, sees in Elba the quintessential elements that make up the quintessential Bond. Citing Elba&#39;s impressive body of work, Hanks feels confident in issuing Elba the proverbial &#34;license to kill,&#34; a privilege reserved for those who can bring a unique blend of charisma, physicality, and depth to the role. Elba&#39;s performances have consistently showcased his ability to navigate complete characters, such as the morally ambiguous detective in Luther. For Hanks, Elba isn&#39;t just a suitable choice; he&#39;s the embodiment of Bond&#39;s future, ready to bring a new dimension to the character&#39;s legacy.






 Idris Elba Probably Won&#39;t Be The Next James Bond 
Elba Is Not Interested, And May Be Too Old For A Long-Term Commitment To The Character 
          

Even during Craig&#39;s early days in the role, Elba has been a very popular choice for Bond. However, Elba has commented on his James Bond chances and whether he will ever actually become 007, and it&#39;s not looking likely. While thankful that he continues to be a popular choice, he says clearly that he&#39;s &#34;not that guy&#34; and that being Bond &#34;is not a goal for [his] career.&#34; Even if he was interested in being 007, there&#39;s one big obstacle working against him. Considering James Bond 26 is still several years away, Elba has probably already aged out of the role.

 James Bond Actor  Years  Films   Sean Connery  1962 - 1967, 1971, 1983  Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds are Forever, Never Say Never Again   David Niven  1967  Casino Royale   George Lazenby  1969  On Her Majesty&#39;s Secret Service   Roger Moore  1973 - 1985  Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy, A View to a Kill   Timothy Dalton  1987 - 1989  The Living Daylights, License to Kill   Pierce Brosnan  1995 - 2002  GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day   Daniel Craig  2006 - 2021  Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre, No Time to Die   






Elba is currently 50 years old and Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson have made clear that they&#39;re looking for someone who can make at least a 10-year commitment to the franchise for several films. It seems much more likely that the next actor to play Bond will be in his early or mid-30s. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Richard Madden, two of the biggest names seemingly in contention for the role, both fit this age bracket, but nothing has been officially announced. It remains to be seen who the next James Bond will actually be, but it doesn&#39;t seem like Hanks will be getting his wish.



 Other Celebrities Have Weighed In On Who Should Be The Next James Bond 
Harry Styles Is Another Popular Choice
         

Tom Hanks isn&#39;t the only Hollywood name who has weighed in on who should play the next James Bond. Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Barbie believes that Kingsley Ben-Adir should play 007 in James Bond 26. The actor played one of the Kens in Barbie, and Gerwig was left stunned by his performance on set. Gerwig commented:






Everybody’s jaws dropped. I was like, get this footage to whoever is making James Bond immediately.




David Arnold is one of the most respected film composers working in Hollywood today, and he has scored five Bond movies, including Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough, Die Another Day, Casino Royale, and Quantum of Solace. The composer has also commented on who he wants to see play James Bond, which comes as something of a surprise (via Mirror). Arnold wants to see Harry Styles play the next James Bond, and the composer commented:



“Why would anything be off the table? Daniel was in the title sequences in a storytelling way - that was something that never really used to happen. These things develop - and should develop.”
