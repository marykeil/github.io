## Literature Review

Mallrats star Shannen Doherty tells director Kevin Smith that the 1995 film killed her film  career when it ended up becoming a box office flop.




Mallrats star Shannen Doherty candidly tells director Kevin Smith that his film killed her career. Doherty is best known for her roles in TV series such as Beverly Hills, 90210, and Charmed. Mallrats was released in 1995 and was the sophomore feature from then-emerging independent film director Smith.




Speaking on Doherty’s Let’s Be Clear podcast, the actress speaks honestly with Smith regarding the fallout of Mallrats. According to Doherty, both Mallrats and her film career “died” as a result of the film’s box office failure. As a reason for this, Doherty said that “People literally thought [she] was carrying the movie” and its box office troubles were “completely on [her].” Check out the full quote from Doherty below:


“It died. So did my film career. That was it.”
“That was it. People literally thought that I was carrying the movie so therefore it was a box office failure it was completely on me. So there was no film career after that, which was a little brutal.”
“I really thought ‘Mallrats’ was going to kick me into that gear [of making movies.]”

Smith made his feature directorial debut in 1994 with the micro-budget film Clerks. Made for a mere $27,000, Clerks turned a profit multiple times over with a theatrical gross of $3.1 million. For Mallrats, Smith was awarded a comparatively massive budget of $8 million and was hopeful to see returns on his next feature given the rampant success of his initial indie darling.

                  Every Kevin Smith Movie Ranked From Worst To Best (Including Clerks III)   With Clerks III now in circulation, it’s time to look back at the daring films of Kevin Smith’s oddball career, ranked from worst to best.   

Such was not the case with Mallrats, for the film only grossed $2.1 million. This total is remarkably low based on the raw number alone, but also considering that this sum is lower than the gross of Clerks, and represents a huge money loss for the film. Mallrats became briefly known as a failure for Smith, who had previously been seen as a promising indie director.

In the years since its release, however, Mallrats has become a cult classic as a result of rentals and home video. Now, the 1995 film is looked at as a quintessential piece of ‘90s media, and a seminal work in Smith’s oeuvre. The delayed love of Mallrats has even spurred talk of Mallrats 2. Luckily, Doherty&#39;s work in Mallrats no longer goes unappreciated.
