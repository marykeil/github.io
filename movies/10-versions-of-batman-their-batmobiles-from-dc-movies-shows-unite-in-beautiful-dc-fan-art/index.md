## Literature Review

Past, present, and future versions of Batman, along with their Batmobiles, from DC movies and TV shows join forces across the multiverse in new art.




New DC fan art brings together multiple versions of Batman from past movies and TV shows, while also showcasing their respective incarnations of the Batmobile and Batwing. The DCEU officially ended in 2023, paving the way for James Gunn&#39;s new DC Universe, which is currently being worked at DC Studios. One of the heroes who will be rebooted for the new continuity is Bruce Wayne, a.k.a. Batman, as he continues to be one of the DC heroes to have been depicted the most in live-action.




While the world awaits new details on DC Universe&#39;s Batman, Steven Defendini shared new artwork that pays tribute to past and present versions of Batman. Along with the different iterations of the DC hero, the fan art includes various versions of the Batmobile and Batwing, which have been reimagined numerous times in past Batman live-action movies and TV shows.


 

Defendini&#39;s Batman art piece also honors the late Kevin Conroy, who played the Caped Crusader in Batman: The Animated Series, the Batman: Arkham video games, and multiple other DC animated properties. Within the expansive Batman art, the following on-screen versions of the Dark Knight can be seen:

 Batman Actor Featured (From Left to Right)  Featured From The Following TV/Movies/Video Games   Christian Bale  The Dark Knight Trilogy   Val Kilmer  Batman Forever   Adam West  Batman &#39;66   Robert Pattinson  The Batman   Kevin Conroy  Batman: Arkham Trilogy   Michael Keaton  Batman &#39;89, Batman Returns   Kevin Conroy  Batman: The Animated Series   George Clooney  Batman &amp; Robin   Ben Affleck  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad, Justice League, The Flash   






                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   


 What&#39;s Next For Batman In Movies &amp; TV In The Rebooted DCU? 
         

In January 2023, Gunn and Peter Safran revealed their initial set of DC Universe TV shows and movies for Chapter 1, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34; One of them will focus on the Dark Knight, as Batman: The Brave and The Bold is in development. The Flash movie director Andy Muschietti is currently attached to helm the movie, while a script is still in the works. Batman: The Brave and The Bold will focus on Bruce and his biological son, Damian Wayne, a.k.a. the fifth Robin, suggesting much of Batman&#39;s history may have already occurred by the time he&#39;s first shown in the DCU.




While not initially revealed to be part of the DC Universe, there is another Batman-related project in the works from DC Studios. In December 2023, Gunn revealed that Matt Reeves&#39; Arkham TV show is part of the DC Universe, rather than one of his The Batman spinoffs as it was initially reported to be. Plot details are still being kept under wraps, as Reeves has not given any further updates ever since Gunn revealed Arkham&#39;s DC Universe status.



Batman: The Brave and The Bold will reportedly feature other members of the Bat-Family.




Time will tell what DC Studios have in mind for Batman in the rest of the DC Universe outside of Batman: The Brave and The Bold, but with this being a new franchise, there are a lot of directions Gunn and Safran can explore with his mythology that the DCEU didn&#39;t do during its run. Hopefully, with the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes over, the DC Universe will be able to cast its new Batman at some point in 2024.
