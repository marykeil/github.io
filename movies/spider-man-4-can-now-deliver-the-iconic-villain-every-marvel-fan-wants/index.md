Summary

  The ending of Spider-Man: No Way Home sets up a variety of storylines for Spider-Man 4, making it the perfect opportunity to bring Spider-Man back to his street-level hero roots.   Kingpin&#39;s appearance in the TV series Hawkeye and the miniseries Echo confirms his presence in the MCU, making him a likely candidate to be the next big Spider-Man villain.   Kingpin running for mayor of New York City and targeting vigilantes aligns perfectly with the current climate of the MCU, making him an ideal antagonist for Spider-Man 4.  





While the status of Spider-Man 4 remains unclear, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has now set up the perfect villain for it thanks to the finale of a recent miniseries. The MCU continues expanding in both film and TV, and now that the Disney&#43; TV shows are connected to the film side of the MCU, these have been used to set up major characters and storylines on the big screen. Among the most intriguing future projects in the MCU is Spider-Man 4, more so after the multiversal chaos seen in Spider-Man: No Way Home.




The ending of Spider-Man: No Way Home was a massive shake-up for Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who, after the final spell that closed the gates of the multiverse, was left completely alone as no one remembers him. This makes way for a variety of storylines for Spider-Man 4, and is the best chance for Marvel to bring Spider-Man back to his roots and make him a street-level hero. This also means that a variety of villains can now join the MCU to confront Spider-Man, and one rumored and theorized to be the next big Spider-Man villain is Kingpin – and this is now more likely after the end of Echo.

                  Spider-Man 4: Cast, Story, &amp; Everything We Know   After Spider-Man: No Way Home, Marvel and Sony have an even bigger task to make Spider-Man 4, but will Tom Holland return and would it be in the MCU?

Echo Leads Into An Adaptation Of The Kingpin-Mayor Marvel Comics Story
         




Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio) made his Marvel debut in Netflix’s Daredevil, but it’s still unclear if this and the rest of Netflix’s Marvel TV shows are part of the MCU’s canon. Still, D’Onofrio’s Kingpin is now part of the MCU after his surprise appearance in the TV series Hawkeye, and he took a bigger role in the miniseries Echo. Kingpin is a crime lord in New York and Maya’s adoptive uncle, as well as the one responsible for her father’s death. At the end of Echo, Kingpin seems to have become a different man after Maya, tapping into the power of her ancestors, healed him of his pain and rage, while also provoking a series of flashbacks to Kingpin that showed his traumatic past.

 Kingpin Appearances     Daredevil  27 Episodes   Luke Cage  Mentioned only   The Punisher  Mentioned only   Hawkeye  2 Episodes   Echo  4 Episodes   






In the post-credits scene of Echo, Kingpin was shown aboard his private jet, where he saw two political commentators on the TV discussing the NYC mayoral race. The reporters say the people of New York want “a fighter” and a “bare-knuckle brawler” as their mayor so he can deal with the city’s problems, and when one of them asks if that candidate is “even out there”, Kingpin leans forwards in his chair, showing interest in the idea of running for mayor. This teases the MCU adapting a Marvel Comis storyline in which Kingpin runs for mayor of New York City and wins, and uses this new position to target vigilantes, which sets him up as the perfect villain for Spider-Man 4.



The Mayor Fisk storyline takes place over Daredevil #595-605, as well as Daredevil Vol 5 #28, Amazing Spider-Man Vol 5 #41-61, and Giant-Size Amazing Spider-Man: King&#39;s Ransom #1. 






 Why Kingpin Is The Perfect Villain For Spider-Man After No Way Home 
Bringing Peter&#39;s Story Back To Street Level
          




Kingpin has been suggested as the best villain for Spider-Man 4 as he’s a street-level bad guy, which is what Spider-Man needs for his next movie. The MCU skipped Spider-Man’s street-level hero phase and immediately sent him into big battles with a variety of villains, but if Spider-Man 4 goes back to the character’s roots, Kingpin will be the perfect antagonist, helping Spider-Man reconnect with his neighborhood and giving him a street-level villain with a lot of power. Kingpin is an even more perfect villain for Spider-Man 4 after Echo’s ending, as the idea of having him as the mayor hunting vigilantes, which would obviously include Spider-Man, fits perfectly in the current MCU climate.

              Marvel&#39;s Echo  Alaqua Cox returns as the anti-hero Maya Lopez in Marvel&#39;s Echo, one of the street-level MCU&#39;s Disney&#43; series that take place during the Multiverse Saga. After her confrontation with Clint Barton and Kate Bishop in Phase 4&#39;s Hawkeye, the titular Echo returns to her hometown and reconnects with her Native American heritage.    Release Date    January 9, 2024     Cast    Chaske Spencer , Zahn McClarnon , Graham Greene , Alaqua Cox , Cody Lightning , Charlie Cox , Tantoo Cardinal , Devery Jacobs , Vincent D&#39;Onofrio     Seasons    1     Writers    Amy Rardin , Marion Dayre
