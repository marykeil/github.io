## Literature Review



DC Comics are known for being substantially darker than their Marvel counterparts, but some scenes from the DCEU proved way more brutal than many audiences expected. Several iconic scenes from the DCEU timeline have been marked by excessive violence and mature themes. These often indicate the franchise&#39;s darker tone, but several proved surprisingly savage, even for DC.




The DCEU concluded with 2023&#39;s Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, leaving behind a legacy of violent and brutal superhero movies. This trend will likely continue into the DCU&#39;s future, particularly with James Gunn at the helm. Nevertheless, there are a litany of existing examples of times when the DCEU displayed unabashed violence and brutality.

              Related   Superman: Legacy: Release Date, Plot Details &amp; Everything We Know   Superman: Legacy is the first entry in James Gunn&#39;s much anticipated new DCU, and here is everything we know from cast to story and release date.    


 Superman Snaps General Zod&#39;s Neck 
Man Of Steel (2013)
   Close     

  Man of Steel This new take on Superman&#39;s origin story, Man of Steel, centers on young journalist Clark Kent/Kal-El, a being who came to Earth as a child from Krypton. Though he has trouble fitting in with his secret superpowers and questions his purpose in life, Clark is forced into action when fellow Kryptonian General Zod arrives on Earth hellbent on conquest. Clark is built by the values set upon him by his parents, Martha and Jonathan Kent, who adopted him as an otherworldly orphan, inadvertently raising him to become the hero humanity needs.  Release Date   June 14, 2013    Director   Zack Snyder    Cast   Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe    Runtime   143 minutes       




In the climactic scene of Man of Steel, Superman faces a moral dilemma that transcends his commitment to protecting humanity. General Zod, a fellow Kryptonian with a formidable lust for power, engages in a devastating battle with Superman in Metropolis. Zod threatens innocent lives as the conflict intensifies, leaving Superman only one option. In a heartbreaking moment, the hero makes an agonizing choice and, with great reluctance, Superman violently snaps General Zod&#39;s neck.

This pivotal moment serves as a poignant exploration of the burden and sacrifices that come with being a superhuman protector, adding layers of complexity to the iconic superhero&#39;s characterization in the DCEU.



 Nam-Ek Decapitates A Pilot 
Man Of Steel (2013)
          

In a harrowing scene from Man of Steel, Nam-Ek, one of General Zod&#39;s imposing Kryptonian warriors, unleashes his brutal strength during the intense battle in Smallville. Amidst the chaos, Nam-Ek ruthlessly decapitates a military pilot, demonstrating the warriors&#39; callous nature. This brutal act serves as a stark reminder of the stakes involved in the conflict and the peril faced by those caught in the crossfire.




The scene contributes to the movie&#39;s darker tone, emphasizing the destructive consequences of superhuman clashes and the collateral damage that ensues. The scene also underscores the vulnerability of humanity compared to the extraterrestrial threat, intensifying the challenges Superman must confront in protecting his adopted world.



 Wonder Woman Stabs General Ludendorff 
Wonder Woman (2017)
          

  Wonder Woman Wonder Woman is the first film in DC&#39;s series focusing on Diana Prince. Gal Gadot reprises her role from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and, this time, must stop the villainous Ares with the help of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The film received generally positive reviews upon release and was followed by Wonder Woman 1984 in 2020.   Release Date   June 2, 2017    Director   Patty Jenkins    Cast   Elena Anaya , Robin Wright , Lisa Loven Kongsli , Connie Nielsen , Lucy Davis , Gal Gadot , Danny Huston , Chris Pine , David Thewlis , Mayling Ng    Runtime   141 Mins       

In Wonder Woman, the dramatic confrontation between Wonder Woman and General Ludendorff unfolds with gripping intensity. As Diana believes Ludendorff to be the god Ares, responsible for the devastation of World War I, she confronts him with a determination to end the conflict.




In a shocking and emotionally charged moment, Diana, fueled by both anger and a profound desire for peace, stabs Ludendorff with the Godkiller sword. However, the narrative takes an unexpected turn when it is revealed that Ludendorff is not Ares. The pivotal scene functions as a turning point for the character, prompting her to grapple with the ambiguity of good and evil.



 Lex Luthor Creates Doomsday 
Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016)
          

  Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In this high-action film by Zack Snyder, the two DC superheroes face off against one another in a conflict spurred on by the villainous Lex Luthor. The film also features WonderWoman playing a role in the fight against Doomsday and other villains from beyond the Earth. As the world&#39;s two most powerful superheroes prepare to destroy each other, an unexpected commonality brings them together to defeat their real enemy.  Release Date   March 24, 2016    Director   Zack Snyder    Cast   Ben Affleck , Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Jesse Eisenberg , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Jeremy Irons , Holly Hunter , Gal Gadot    Runtime   152 minutes       

In Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Lex Luthor&#39;s malevolent ambitions reach their zenith as he manipulates Kryptonian technology to create the monstrous entity known as Doomsday. Obsessed with destroying Superman and Batman, Luthor combines General Zod&#39;s corpse with his own blood, triggering a nightmarish transformation.




The result is Doomsday, a force of unparalleled destruction. Luther&#39;s unhinged pursuit of power and chaos unleashes a cataclysmic that that forces the heroes to unite against this terrifying enemy, highlighting the consequences of unchecked technological manipulation and the dark depths of Lex Luthors&#39;s cunning and cruelty - through the horrifying Frankenstein-style reanimation of General Zod&#39;s lifeless body.



 Superman And Doomsday Stab Each Other Simultaneously 
Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice (2016)
          

In the climactic battle of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Superman faces the monstrous Doomsday. As the relentless brawl unfolds, Superman and Doomsday, locked in a desperate struggle, thrust themselves into a chilling and sacrificial moment. In a shocking turn of events, both adversaries simultaneously impale each other with fatal blows.




This poignant and tragic climax symbolizes the ultimate sacrifice, as Superman willingly risks his life to save humanity from the destructive force he unintentionally unleashed. The synchronized stabbing underscores Superman&#39;s unwavering commitment to protecting the world, delivered through an especially brutal final bout.



 The Joker Tortures And Manipulates Harley Quinn 
Suicide Squad (2016)
   Close     

  Suicide Squad The Suicide Squad team is made up of villains, captured and kept in a secret prison, and offered reduced sentences if they participate in dangerous missions. In the tradition of continuity within DCEU films, the event comes in the wake of Superman&#39;s death and the seclusion of Batman after the events that occurred in Batman V Superman. Agency head Amanda Waller, played by award-winning actress Viola Davis, is the one striking deals with the inmates of Belle Reve Prison. Heading “Task Force X” is Joel Kinnaman’s Rick Flag, alongside Will Smith’s Deadshot, Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn, Jai Courtney’s Captain Boomerang, Jay Hernandez’s El Diablo, Adewale Akinnuoye’s Killer Croc, and Adam Beach’s Slipknot. Karen Fukuhara’s Katana also joins the mission to keep Rick safe from the villains. Jared Leto (Joker) and Ben Affleck (Batman) have smaller roles in David Ayer’s Suicide Squad, as does Cara Delevingne’s Enchantress.  Release Date   August 5, 2016    Director   David Ayer    Cast   Joel Kinnaman , Will Smith , Cara Delevingne , Jai Courtney , Jared Leto , Viola Davis , Margot Robbie , Jay Hernandez , Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje , Scott Eastwood    Runtime   123 minutes       

The relationship between Harley Quinn and the Joker is fraught with darkness, and several particularly chilling moments in Suicide Squad highlight the extent of the Joker&#39;s cruelty. The Clown Prince of Crime subjects Harley to psychological and physical torment, including a ruthless electrocution scene and convincing Harley to jump into a vat of acid.




These capture the Joker&#39;s sadistic tendencies as he inflicts emotional and physical pain on Harley, emphasizing their romance&#39;s twisted dynamic. These sequences are marked by excessive cruelty, and serve as a stark reminder of the tragic consequences of their tumultuous relationship, contributing to the movie&#39;s exploration of the complexities of villainy.



 Batman And Supergirl Die Repeatedly 
The Flash (2023)
   Close     

  The Flash The Flash is a DC Extended Universe film starring Ezra Miller as Barry Allen, A.K.A. The Flash. Wishing for a world where his mother still lives, Barry Allen manages to find a way to travel through time to save her. However, Barry ends up in an alternate universe where metahumans aren&#39;t present, meaning a living General Zod arrives to conquer the planet. To save this world and return home, Barry will seek the help of two alternate reality heroes, Batman (Michael Keaton and Supergirl (Sasha Calle).  Release Date   June 16, 2023    Director   Andres Muschietti    Cast   Ezra Miller , Michael Keaton , Ben Affleck , Sasha Calle , Michael Shannon    Runtime   2 hours 24 minutes       

In the compelling final scenes of The Flash, Batman and Supergirl&#39;s repeated deaths create a gripping narrative tension, delving into the complexities of time travel and parallel universes. The Flash inadvertently becomes entangled in temporal paradoxes, and the consequence is that both Batman and Supergirl meet tragic fates in multiple timelines.




These surprising and brutal deaths emphasize the inherent danger of tampering with time and showcase the emotional toll on the Scarlet Speedster, who must grapple with the recurring loss of close allies. The fact the heroes died at all was shocking enough, but their repeated deaths as the Flash attempts to save them were an especially brutal surprise.



 Aquaman&#39;s Submarine Fight Scene 
Aquaman (2018)
          

  Aquaman Released in 2018, Aquaman is an action-adventure film that centers on the DC Comics hero of the same name. Set after the events of Justice League, the story follows Arthur Curry as he avoids his destiny as king of Atlantis. A vendetta forces Arthur to step up to protect Atlantis - and the world - from dangerous forces seeking to control the ocean.  Release Date   July 6, 2018    Director   James Wan    Cast   Willem Dafoe , Patrick Wilson , Randall Park , Ludi Lin , Dolph Lundgren , Michael Beach , Amber Heard , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Jason Momoa , Temuera Morrison    Runtime   143 Minutes       

In Aquaman, the submarine fight scene stands out as a visceral and brutal display of Aquaman&#39;s physical prowess. Aquaman engages in a high-stakes battle against Black Manta and his henchmen inside a submarine, showcasing dynamic choreography and intense combat. The clash is punctuated by bone-crushing blows, acrobatic maneuvers, and the powerful use of Aquaman&#39;s trident.




The brutality is a marked change from earlier scenes, indicating the emotionally heightened stakes prompted by personal vendettas and the threat to innocent lives. James Wan&#39;s direction captures the raw energy of the underwater brawl, making the submarine fight a standout moment in Aquaman.



 Team 1&#39;s Death In Corto Maltese 
The Suicide Squad (2021)
          

  The Suicide Squad James Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad acts as a soft reboot for David Ayer&#39;s 2016 Suicide Squad. Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) is again recruiting a group of superheroes for a dangerous mission, this time pairing Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman) with Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Bloodsport (Idris Elba), Peacemaker (John Cena), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Ratcatcher 2 (Daniela Melchior), Savant (Michael Rooker), King Shark (Sylvester Stallone), Blackguard (Pete Davidson), and Javelin (Flula Borg).

In The Suicide Squad, the concept of expendability within Task Force X is starkly illustrated when Team 1 faces a gruesome and harrowing demise. Assembled with a mix of new and returning characters, Team 1 ventures into a perilous mission only to encounter a devastating and violent end.




The unapologetically brutal scene exposes the movie&#39;s dark humor and stark violence, as each team member faces a grueling demise that is wholly unexpected. The graphic and unceremonious deaths of Team 1 reflect the high-stakes nature of the Suicide Squad&#39;s missions, reinforcing the movie&#39;s gritty and irreverent tone while keeping the audience on the edge of their seats.



 Harley Quinn Cripples Roman Sionis&#39;s Driver 
Birds Of Prey (2020)
          

  Birds of Prey Birds of Prey takes place after the original Suicide Squad film and shines the spotlight on Harley Quinn. After being dumped by The Joker, Harley Quinn finds herself on the road to recovery through various comical and destructive (but not to herself) means. Following a stolen diamond and a young pickpocket that has won her over, Quinn is forced to join forces with three vigilante female superheroes - Black Canary, Huntress, and Renee Montoya to save a little girl&#39;s life from the crime lord Roman Sionis, AKA the Black Mask.  Release Date   February 7, 2020    Director   Cathy Yan    Cast   Jurnee Smollett-Bell , Matthew Willig , Bojana Novakovic , Ali Wong , Ewan McGregor , Charlene Amoia , Margot Robbie , Rosie Perez , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Chris Messina    Runtime   109 minutes       

The most brutal moment in the DCEU occurs in Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn. While partying at Roman Sionis&#39;s club, Harley savagely cripples Sionis&#39;s driver by leaping into the air and crashing down on his knees, causing them to bend backwards. The scene unfolds with Harley&#39;s signature unpredictability and dictated early on that the movie was notably more mature than other DCEU installments.




Harley not only asserts her lethal potential away from the Joker but also delivers a symbolic blow against the oppressive forces she once served. Harley&#39;s uniquely unhinged charisma makes the moment a highly memorable example of Harley&#39;s newfound agency.
