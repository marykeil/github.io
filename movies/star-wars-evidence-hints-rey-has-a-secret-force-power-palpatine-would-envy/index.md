# Star Wars Evidence Hints Rey Has A Secret Force Power Palpatine Would Envy


## SUMMARY 



  Rey Skywalker may be able to access to the World Between Worlds following the sequels with a more balanced approach to the Force.   Acts of balance seem to tap into the power of the World Between Worlds, a Force nexus that offers access to multiple points in time and space.   Rey&#39;s knowledge of the World Between Worlds, as indicated by the sacred Jedi texts, could lead to her accessing this powerful Force nexus in her upcoming movie.

## Literature Review

The sequel trilogy&#39;s Rey Skywalker may have access to an impressive new Force power her Emperor Palpatine wanted for decades in the Star Wars canon.




Rey Skywalker may have access to a new Force power her evil grandfather would envy in the Star Wars canon. At the very end of the sequel trilogy, Rey is seemingly ready to become a new kind of Jedi, one who&#39;s learned from the mistakes of past Jedi while looking toward a bright new feature. To that end, her new status quo may allow her to access a key nexus in the Force in her upcoming New Jedi Order movie in development from director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy.




Having been part of a rare Force dyad with Kylo Ren, it&#39;s speculated that Rey Skywalker is more focused on balance following the sequel trilogy, having learned from the mistakes of Luke Skywalker in his attempt to bring back the Jedi Order as it was during the prequels, itself being largely corrupt and compromised. She&#39;s also wielding a new yellow-bladed lightsaber which has been tied to the idea of balance as well. Keeping that in mind, Rey being a more balanced Jedi may give her access to a notable source of power as evidenced by past events in the Star Wars timeline.

 Star Wars Has Hinted Light &amp; Dark Together Can Access The World Between Worlds 
Acts of Balance May Be The Key
         




As seen in Star Wars Rebels and in the live-action Ahsoka series, the World Between Worlds is known as vergence scatter, a Force nexus beyond the physical realm offering access to multiple points in time and space. Although there are doorways across the galaxy that can be unlocked using the Force such as the mural found by Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren on Lothal, there seem to be other ways in which a Force-sensitive&#39;s spirit can access the nexus as well. By using both the dark and light sides of the Force, acts of balance seem to tap into the World Between Worlds.

When Maul and Ezra merged a Jedi and Sith holocron together, they learned previously unknown and hidden knowledge which may have been granted via the World Between Worlds with the nexus being more about knowledge rather than overt time travel according to Lucasfilm&#39;s Dave Filoni. During the events of the original trilogy, Luke Skywalker used his growing powers in the light to connect with a Sith Lord&#39;s kyber crystal, an act which saw his spirit meeting with his father&#39;s twenty years apart in a Force nexus that was more than likely the World Between Worlds (or a very similar nexus).




Ahsoka Tano herself is also a more balanced Force-sensitive, which could explain her experience with Anakin in the World Between Worlds. However, Rey and Kylo Ren were able to interact and confront each other regardless of the space between them. It&#39;s a strong hint that their bond as a rare dyad could tap into the Force nexus&#39; power as a merging of both the light and dark sides. It&#39;s also worth noting that it&#39;s been confirmed that a Force dyad can also manipulate time just as well as space(just like the World Between Worlds).

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   



 The Sacred Jedi Texts Contain Notes On The World Between Worlds 
Rey Knows About The Vergence Scatter
          




As seen in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The Visual Dictionary, pages from the sacred Jedi texts are shown in detail, the very same books taken by Rey which she used to continue her Jedi training with Leia as her new master after Luke died in The Last Jedi. One of these pages includes the &#34;Chain World Theorem&#34; written down by a past Jedi who theorized the World Between Worlds&#39; existence. Assuming that Rey has already read or will eventually read the entirety of the sacred texts, it means that Rey Skywalker will more than likely be aware of the powerful Force nexus in her upcoming movie.

The concept of a dyad is bound to the balance of the Force rather than just the light alone, so it&#39;s certainly possible that Rey will be working to bring her own New Jedi Order to life with a greater focus on balance, a greater embodiment of what she once was with Ben Solo/Kylo Ren. As such, perhaps Rey will have learned to access the World Between Worlds through said balance.



 Palpatine Always Sought Access To The World Between Worlds 
The Sith Lord Couldn&#39;t Enter The Vergence Himself
          




Although Emperor Palpatine tried to enter the World Between Worlds in Star Wars Rebels, he never succeeded. He only got close when he tried to grab onto Ezra and Ahsoka with Ezra having entered via the Lothal mural and Ahsoka being pulled in by Ezra. As such, there would certainly be a strong degree of poetic justice if Palpatine&#39;s granddaughter ends up succeeding where he failed, having attained something the Sith could have never achieved in the Star Wars timeline: balance in the Force itself.
