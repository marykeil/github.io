Summary

  Ryan Gosling&#39;s upcoming film, &#34;The Fall Guy,&#34; has the potential to redeem the disappointment that came with &#34;The Gray Man.&#34;   &#34;The Fall Guy&#34; is an action-thriller that stars Gosling as a stuntman who becomes involved in a plot to save a missing movie star.   The key to the success of &#34;The Fall Guy&#34; lies in director David Leitch&#39;s track record of delivering exciting action sequences and memorable characters.  





Ryan Gosling returns to action movies in 2024 with The Fall Guy, and it has all the makings to help redeem the disappointment that came with The Gray Man. Gosling is no stranger to action movies, as he has starred in a handful of them over the course of his career. However, 2022&#39;s The Gray Man was meant to be a new franchise starter that showcased his skills. Anthony and Joe Russo&#39;s movie did well enough on Netflix to move forward with sequel plans, and while The Gray Man 2 will look to improve upon its disappointing predecessor, it is not the most exciting action movie in Gosling&#39;s upcoming filmography.




That title instead belongs to the new movie The Fall Guy, co-starring Emily Blunt and directed by David Leitch. The remake of the popular 1980s TV series sees Ryan Gosling star as a stuntman who becomes part of a plot to save the lead of a movie after he&#39;s gone missing. The Fall Guy is an action-thriller built around Gosling&#39;s Colt as he attempts to save the missing movie star, played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. The Fall Guy&#39;s cast also includes Stephanie Hsu, Hannah Waddingham, Winston Duke, and Teresa Palmer, and the ensemble nature and the action elements provided by David Leitch give Gosling a chance for action movie redemption.

 : The Fall Guy: Cast, Story Detail &amp; Everything We Know


 The Fall Guy Can Be The Ryan Gosling Action Movie The Gray Man Was Meant To Be 
          

The general plot of The Fall Guy is very different from The Gray Man, but it does serve a similar purpose in Ryan Gosling&#39;s career. The movie is already envisioned as a potential new action movie franchise for Universal. It also sees Gosling take on the lead role in a great ensemble cast as he works with a very successful action movie director in the hopes of delivering some massive and impressive sequences. This is essentially what The Gray Man was meant to be as well, as Gosling worked with the Russo Brothers, a cast that included Chris Evans and Ana de Armas, and went big on action.




Ultimately, The Gray Man failed to really deliver on its promise. It was met with negative reviews, as represented by its 45% score on Rotten Tomatoes, as a result of it feeling too similar to better action movies. The movie&#39;s Netflix viewership helped save the general perception a bit, but The Gray Man&#39;s record budget contributed to the negativity, as it did not generally look like a movie that cost $200 million to make. This especially came to fruition during action sequences that had underwhelming visual effects. The bigger reliance on CGI was not that surprising given the Russo brothers&#39; history with Marvel movies, but it was still disappointing nonetheless.



 David Leitch&#39;s Track Record Is The Key To Gosling&#39;s New Action Movie 
          

The key reason why The Fall Guy can beat The Gray Man is David Leitch. He is a former stuntman himself, so the stuntman focus of The Fall Guy&#39;s story already speaks to him. However, it is his work as the director for several memorable action movies, like Atomic Blonde or Deadpool 2, that shows how he can deliver on The Fall Guy&#39;s promise. While some of his movies have had a tendency to get lost in CGI or not have fully realized characters despite a great cast, he still manages to do a good job of making his action sequences exciting and fresh.




Leitch&#39;s most recent movie, Bullet Train, had great hand-to-hand fights and a bit of ridiculous CGI, but it also had some memorable characters. This is hopefully a sign that he will carry a similar approach to The Fall Guy. If he does, then Ryan Gosling will get the new action movie franchise he&#39;s been searching for and one that lives up to his usual standards.
