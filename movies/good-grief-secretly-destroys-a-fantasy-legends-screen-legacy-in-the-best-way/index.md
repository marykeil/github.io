Summary

  Good Grief, directed by Dan Levy, is a dark dramedy about love and loss that upends the screen persona of actor David Bradley.   Bradley&#39;s character, Duncan, is a sincere and sensitive older man, a departure from his usual villainous roles, and delivers a heartbreaking eulogy for his son.   This role in Good Grief continues Bradley&#39;s trend of challenging his legacy as a villainous actor, showcasing his impressive range and skill set.  







While Netflix’s dramedy Good Grief does upend the screen persona of a legendary fantasy actor, the movie does so in the best possible way. Good Grief is the directorial debut of Schitt’s Creek star Dan Levy. A dark dramedy about love and loss, Good Grief sees Levy play Marcus, a children’s book illustrator married to a tremendously successful, charismatic author. When his husband is killed in a tragic accident, Marcus is initially overcome by grief until he reads a shocking Christmas card from his late partner. This message complicates Marcus’s feelings, sending him on a soul-searching trip to Paris with two of his oldest friends.

Good Grief’s bittersweet ending sees Marcus come to terms with the contradictory feelings surrounding his loss, but the character takes a long and messy journey to achieve this closure. In the process, he spends a few pivotal scenes speaking to his late husband’s father, Duncan. A stoic elderly man, Duncan couldn’t be less like the bombastic son that he lost. However, he is a sincere, sensitive character beneath his frown, and Duncan ends up providing Good Grief with its most moving scene early on when he delivers a heartbreaking eulogy for his son. This moment is only improved by a meta-awareness of his actor’s onscreen oeuvre.





 David Bradley’s Good Grief Character Is Nothing Like His Most Famous Roles 
          

David Bradley is a British screen veteran best known for playing the Game of Thrones villain Walder Frey and the Harry Potter antagonist Argus Filch. For years, Bradley has carved out a successful niche playing uniquely nasty bad guys, which makes his role in Good Grief a welcome shock. Good Grief’s entire cast is strong, but Bradley’s touching performance as a grieving father proves incredibly poignant. It&#39;s a wild surprise for viewers who only know him as a miserly, callous, and even gleefully cruel villain. Bradley’s streak of villainous roles dates way back to &#39;90s BBC period dramas like Vanity Fair and Our Mutual Friend.

However, in Good Grief, Duncan is a sweet, well-meaning older man who simply wishes that he spent less time casting a shadow over his son’s light. His eulogy sees Duncan metaphorically apologize for standing in the way of his young son when he just wanted to play and be his uninhibited self. Bradley’s masterful performance underplays Duncan’s regret, with the taciturn older man pausing a moment before admitting that he struggled to embrace his son’s unconventional personality. While the writing is strong and the acting is skillful, it is Bradley&#39;s recognizable status as a legendary screen villain that makes this scene so uniquely moving.






 Good Grief Continues Bradley’s Best Career Trend 
          

Though Good Grief’s Duncan marks a departure from Bradley’s usual rogue’s gallery of bad guys, this is not the first time the actor has challenged his legacy in recent years. He recently played Geppetto in Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, another movie that dealt with love, loss, and the tragedy of grief in ways that few viewers saw coming. After establishing himself as a standout villainous actor over the years, Bradley is now taking advantage of his screen history with a string of roles that show another side of the actor’s skill set. As Good Grief’s strongest scene proves, this is a canny choice that displays his impressive range.
