## Literature Review

Ariana DeBose stars in a new thriller set in space, and the options for where to watch I.S.S. range from showtimes to a later streaming release.




I.S.S. is a new sci-fi thriller, and there are options for where to watch the movie. Directed by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, I.S.S. tells the story of a group of astronauts and cosmonauts living on the International Space Station whose lives are changed due to a global conflict that erupts on Earth. Each person aboard the station is ordered to take control of the I.S.S. for the betterment of their country. The thriller story of I.S.S. comes from Nick Shafir&#39;s screenplay, which first gained recognition in 2020 by appearing on the Black List of great new scripts that have yet to be made.




I.S.S. features a well-known group of cast members, led by Ariana DeBose from West Side Story and Wish. She&#39;s joined by Chris Messina (Air, The Boogeyman), Pilou Asbæk (Game of Thrones), and John Gallagher Jr. (10 Cloverfield Lane). Assembling this group of actors and having them tackle a thrilling story set in space certainly makes I.S.S. an intriguing movie worth checking out. Audiences will have options to choose how, when, and where to watch I.S.S. depending on a variety of factors.


 I.S.S. Releases In Theaters On January 19, 2024 
          

The earliest opportunity to see I.S.S. is through its theatrical release on January 19, 2024.

The movie is receiving an exclusive theatrical release at the start and has no direct competition opening up against it. This gives the film a chance to potentially find an audience at the box office if enough people go to one of the I.S.S. showtimes.

 When Will I.S.S. Release On Streaming? 
          

Those who want to wait and watch I.S.S. on streaming have no clear timeline for when that will happen. Bleecker Street has not announced any plans for when the movie will be released on streaming. The studio does not have any deals set up with one main streaming service that brings its titles to streaming after a specific amount of time. However, most of Bleecker Street&#39;s movies wind up available to stream through Fubo TV later on. For I.S.S., that might not be until April or May 2024.






 When Will I.S.S. Release On Digital? 
          

Anyone wanting to watch I.S.S. at home should get the first opportunity to do so through the film&#39;s digital release. Bleecker Street has not confirmed when this will happen, but the studio does have a tendency to make their films available to rent or buy digitally through major PVOD services. The timing of I.S.S.&#39;s release on digital could depend on its performance at the box office. The best case scenario is likely a February or March 2024 digital release.
