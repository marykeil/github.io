Summary

  The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes gives a deeper understanding of President Snow&#39;s ruthlessness and The Hunger Games franchise as a whole.   While Peeta and Katniss remain fan-favorite characters, the setting of the prequel prevented their appearance, but there&#39;s potential for their return to the big screen.   There are potential stories that can be explored after Mockingjay, focusing on the roadblocks Peeta and Katniss face while healing from their trauma or reintroducing the concept of the games.  





The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes hit theaters on November 17, 2023, and gave new life to Suzanne Collins&#39; The Hunger Games franchise. Releasing nine years after Mockingjay – Part 2, the prequel is based on Collins&#39; 2020 novel and tells the origin story of the series&#39; main antagonist. Coriolanus Snow&#39;s unexpected affection for his District 12 mentee provides a deeper understanding of the president&#39;s ruthlessness but does little to absolve him of his sins. Whether he truly loved Lucy Gray remains up to interpretation, as his actions in the prequel leave plenty of room for skepticism.




Despite the introduction of a new star-crossed lovers romance, Peeta and Katniss remain fan-favorite characters and the primary relationship of The Hunger Games. The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&#39; setting prevented Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence from appearing in the films, but that doesn&#39;t mean the characters won&#39;t find their way back to the big screen. In an exclusive interview with Screen Rant, Hutcherson revealed whether he&#39;d be interested in returning to the franchise. Read his full quote below:


Screen Rant: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes has also reawakened a love of your hit Hunger Games franchise. Would you ever want to revisit Peeta and Katniss&#39; stories onscreen?
Josh Hutcherson: Absolutely. Absolutely. Getting me and Jen, Liam, Woody, and Elizabeth (Banks). If we get the whole gang back together, I’m in 100%.



 How The Hunger Games Franchise Can Reintroduce Peeta &amp; Katniss 
         




Although Collins has yet to write a novel taking place after the events of Mockingjay, there are plenty of potential stories to be told. Mockingjay – Part 2 ends with a fifteen-year time jump and sees Peeta and Katniss raising their two children. The couple is presumed to have lived in peace since the games were dissolved, but both characters&#39; recovery from their time in the arena was surely a long and difficult road.

While Peeta shows significant improvement following the revolution, it&#39;s unclear if he&#39;s ever fully able to regain all his memories. In turn, Katniss must come to terms with the loss of Prim, as well as Gale&#39;s accidental role in her death. A film can easily fill in gaps left by the time jump and focus on the roadblocks Peeta and Katniss face while healing from their trauma.



Alternatively, the story could pick up after Mockingjay&#39;s epilogue and reintroduce the concept of the games.







The Hunger Games are abolished after Katniss kills Coin and Commander Paylor is elected president of Panem, but given how many people supported the brutal competition, it could easily find its way back into the universe. Regardless of what direction a hopeful follow-up takes, it&#39;s likely to be a success if Hutcherson and Lawrence are both on board.
