## Literature Review



Many internet memes capture the tumultuous year that 2023 has been for the DCEU. Under the stewardship of DC Studios, first founded in 2022, DC is headed for a new future cinematically with the announcement of the DCU franchise, which will formally get underway with 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy. Unfortunately, that means that the DCEU is effectively being brought to a premature end in 2023.
With four movies debuting in 2023 in Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, the DCEU has had a decidedly rough year commercially. Many fans on Reddit and elsewhere on the internet have illustrated this with hilarious memes, either addressing the general state of DC on film, along with mining humor from 2023&#39;s individual DCEU movies. Here are 10 memes that perfectly capture the DCEU&#39;s place in 2023.

Several Marvel and DC projects have given life to or recreated popular memes over the years, and some of them have truly exploded in fan recognition.













 








 10  Supergirl Rivals Batman&#39;s Brutality 
Supergirl Takes Lives With Ease In The Flash Movie


Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman dips into more brutal methods of fighting crime in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but Sasha Calle&#39;s Supergirl proves herself to be far more uncompromising when fighting villains in The Flash. Reddit user SameBatChannel00 points this out, describing Calle&#39;s Supergirl as essentially an even more punishing killing machine than Affleck&#39;s Batman ever was during his fall into darkness. Given that Affleck&#39;s Batman returns to being a stalwart hero in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League while Calle&#39;s Supergirl kills right from the beginning in The Flash, the point itself is hard to dispute.





 9  Aquaman 2 Going The Way Of Batgirl 
Batgirl Was Declared A Tax Write-Off By Warner Bros.


 Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom 
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the sequel to the 2018 film that sees Jason Momoa reprise his role as Arthur Curry (AKA Aquaman.) In the film, Aquaman is forced to forge a strained alliance with a new ally to protect his kingdom of Atlantis and the world from total destruction. 
 Release Date   December 22, 2023    Director   James Wan    Cast   Jason Momoa , Amber Heard , Patrick Wilson , Dolph Lundgren , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Temuera Morrison    




The shocking cancelation of Batgirl by Warner Bros. sent waves through the film industry and DC fandom alike and raised big question about what upcoming movie could be the next to be declared a tax write-off. Reddit user stanofnolan has drawn some humor in this, with a meme designed as a mock Variety article announcing that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom had been lost from Warner Bros. server. Obviously, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom did make it into theaters, but the meme pokes fun at how art, like movies, can take a sharp turn into becoming commodities.





 8  DC&#39;s 2023 Box Office Misfortunes 
2023 Hasn&#39;t Been A Good Year For Superheroes


2023 has been a very rough year for DC at the box office. Following the unfortunate box office letdowns of Shazam!: Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle, Reddit user HummingLemon49 illustrates that unfortunate trend with the popular Grim Reaper meme. With how rocky a year 2023 has been for superhero movies in general, hopefully the DCEU&#39;s 2023 releases can find a second life on streaming and home media after their unfortunate box office woes.





 7  Life As A Marvel Fan Vs A DC Fan 
DC Fans Are In Disagreement With Their Studio A Lot More


While the MCU has hit a rough patch post-Avengers: Endgame, Reddit user Dry-Lemon1382 shows the contrast of MCU and DCEU fans and their relationships with their respective studios. With Marvel fans seemingly having plenty to smile about, DC fans have had a rougher go with sharp turns in their franchise, amid seemingly never-ending calls for unreleased cuts of movies and the completion of unfinished movie arcs with the Justice League. It seems likely that only time will tell whether the upcoming DCU quells or intensifies the hashtag campaigns that seem to have become part and parcel of DC fandom.

 DCEU: 10 Memes That Perfectly Sum Up Batman As A Character 
While the Batman of the DC Extended Universe is a grim figure, there are some genuinely funny memes that sum him up pretty well.









 6  No Rogues For The Flash Movie 
General Zod Returns From His Man Of Steel Death


 The Flash 
The Flash is a DC Extended Universe film starring Ezra Miller as Barry Allen, A.K.A. The Flash. Wishing for a world where his mother still lives, Barry Allen manages to find a way to travel through time to save her. However, Barry ends up in an alternate universe where metahumans aren&#39;t present, meaning a living General Zod arrives to conquer the planet. To save this world and return home, Barry will seek the help of two alternate reality heroes, Batman (Michael Keaton and Supergirl (Sasha Calle).
 Release Date   June 16, 2023    Director   Andres Muschietti    Cast   Ezra Miller , Michael Keaton , Ben Affleck , Sasha Calle , Michael Shannon    




The Scarlet Speedster has a vast rogue&#39;s gallery of villains, fittingly known as the Rogues, which includes Reverse-Flash, Gorilla Grodd, Captain Cold, Mirror Master, The Trickster, and many others. While many of them have been seen on The Flash TV series, as Reddit user Some-Dog9800 humorously points out, The Flash movie features none of them and instead brings back Michael Shannon&#39;s General Zod from Man of Steel. Admittedly, Zod&#39;s role in The Flash movie works perfectly well for the film&#39;s reworked version of the Flashpoint comics story, but the revival of one of Superman&#39;s arch-enemies for Barry Allen&#39;s first movie is nonetheless a funny irony to point out.
The Flash villain Captain Boomerang does appear in the DCEU, played by Jai Courtney, but the two only briefly meet in David Ayer&#39;s Suicide Squad, with Boomerang being killed off early on in James Gunn&#39;s The Suicide Squad. 






 5  Nicolas Cage&#39;s Superman Finally Takes Flight 
He Brings The Giant Spider With Him


Tim Burton&#39;s unproduced Superman Lives has long been one of the most fascinating unrealized superhero movies, but despite this, Nicolas Cage&#39;s Superman is no longer a relic of an unrealized film thanks to the multiverse story of The Flash - a very show-stopping cameo indeed, as the meme of Reddit user BottleCompetitive546 illustrates. In the movie&#39;s climactic Chronobowl sequence, Cage&#39;s Superman is among the DC heroes glimpsed in alternate realities throughout the multiverse, complete with Cage&#39;s Man of Steel fighting a giant spider as was intended for Superman Lives.





 4  The Flash&#39;s CGI Was Very Polarizing 
The Chronobowl Sequences Drew Mixed Reactions


While The Flash opens many doorways and possibilities in DC&#39;s multiverse, the movie&#39;s CGI is one of its more divisive elements. One aspect of The Flash that has been particularly polarizing is the movie&#39;s Chronobowl sequences, in which CGI snapshots of the past appear in a kind of temporal amphitheater, while several of the film&#39;s multiverse cameos use stock footage and deepfake technology for characters like Christopher Reeve&#39;s Superman and Adam West&#39;s Batman. While this was reportedly a stylistic decision per director Andy Muschietti, Reddit user RodrigoMedrado&#39;s meme likening The Flash&#39;s effects to the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns shows it&#39;s still a polarizing element of the film.





 3  Henry Cavill Is A Beloved Superman 
His Superman Return Was Cut Short


Henry Cavill&#39;s tenure as Superman has seen him appear in some divisively received movies, like Man of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, but as Reddit user Content_Dragonfly_53&#39;s meme makes clear, Cavill&#39;s portrayal of Superman has been popular even among detractors of said movies. Indeed, following the infamous mustache disaster of 2017&#39;s Justice League, the 2021 release of Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League greatly re-invigorated the franchise and love for Cavill&#39;s Superman. Following Cavill&#39;s much-hyped return in Black Adam and the subsequent heartbreak of his departure with the announcement of the DCU slate, his Superman has clearly resonated with many.

 2  Shazam! Fury Of The Gods Picked The Wrong Weekend To Open 
John Wick Is A Formidable Box Office Force


 Shazam! The Fury of the Gods 
In the sequel to 2019’s Shazam!, Billy Batson and his foster siblings struggle to live a typical teenage life with their newfound superpowers. But their lives get even more complicated when the Daughters of Atlas, Hespera and Kalypso, plot revenge on Shazam as they search for the magic stolen from their family long ago. 
 Release Date   March 17, 2023    Director   David F. Sandberg    Cast   Helen Mirren , Adam Brody​ , Michelle Borth , Faithe Herman , Jack Dylan Grazer , Ian Chen , Jovan Armand , Asher Angel , Lucy Liu , Ross Butler , Marta Milans , Meagan Good , Cooper Andrews , Rachel Zegler , Zachary Levi , D.J. Cotrona , grace fulton    




 Shazam!: Fury of the Gods didn&#39;t achieve even the moderate box office success of its 2019 predecessor, but the news of the DCU reboot probably wasn&#39;t the only reason for its box office letdown. As Realistic_Crew1095 on Reddit points out, Fury of the Gods opened just one week before the highly anticipated John Wick: Chapter 4, which became the biggest hit of its franchise. With Shazam!: Fury of the Gods already off to a weak start at the box office and with the wind taken out of its sails by news of the DCU slate, Billy Batson sadly never stood a chance against the Baba Yaga.





 1  The Immortal Quote Of Michael Keaton&#39;s Dark Knight 
&#34;I&#39;m Batman&#34;
        

Michael Keaton returns as an older Batman in the multiverse adventure of The Flash, and as Crow_Se7en on Memedroid points out, his classic line of &#34;I&#39;m Batman&#34; hasn&#39;t lost any of its impact. Keaton has been prone to drop his famed quote as a humorous one-liner in interviews, and The Flash itself is clearly acutely aware of how much of a meme Keaton&#39;s line is in isolation. With both The Flash&#39;s marketing and the movie itself going out of their way to emphasize Keaton&#39;s quote of &#34;Yeah...I&#39;m Batman&#34; as a big moment in the film, it&#39;s still as much of a DC geek-out quote in 2023 as it originally was in 1989, and a hilarious DCEU meme.
