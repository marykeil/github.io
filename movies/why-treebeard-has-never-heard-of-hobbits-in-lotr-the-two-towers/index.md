# Why Treebeard Has Never Heard Of Hobbits In LOTR The Two Towers


## SUMMARY 



  Treebeard, the ancient and wise Ent in The Lord of the Rings, had never encountered Hobbits before meeting Merry and Pippin, despite being nearly as old as Middle-earth itself.   The reason for this is that Hobbits were not widely known until the end of the Third Age and remained a private and secluded species.   It is possible that Treebeard may have come across Hobbits in the past when he ventured far from his home looking for the Entwives, but he likely never learned their name or considered them important until his encounter with Merry and Pippin.

## Literature Review

Treebeard had no idea what a Hobbit was in the Lord of the Rings, despite being an ancient and wise being - but this wasn&#39;t really all that strange. 




Treebeard had never heard of Hobbits when he met Merry and Pippin in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and given how ancient the Ents are, this seems strange. Treebeard is the oldest of the Ents, thought to be nearly as old as the land of Middle-earth itself. This made him extremely wise in The Lord of the Rings, having a profound understanding that even the Elves lacked. Still, simple beings like Merry and Pippin perplexed him, and their clarifying that they were Hobbits (not orcs) didn&#39;t seem to mean anything to Treebeard. However, this fact isn&#39;t as strange as it may seem.




Merry and Pippin came upon Treebeard the Ent in Fangorn Forest in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and the tree shepherd immediately accused them of being Orcs. It took a significant amount of convincing for Treebeard to accept that the Hobbits were not a danger—rather, they were just a species he had seemingly never come across before. Treebeard was at least 11,000 years old by the events of The Lord of the Rings (and likely even older), yet he had somehow never come across Hobbits before. However, given how private both Halflings and Ents have always been, this makes a good deal of sense.

                  LOTR Plot Hole Debunked: Why Saruman Didn&#39;t Kill Treebeard &amp; The Ents   Saruman&#39;s lack of action against the Ents in The Lord of the Rings has been called a plot hole, but there&#39;s a good reason for his ignorance.   


 The Term &#34;Hobbit&#34; Only Emerged In Middle-earth&#39;s Third Age 
          




Hobbits were not widely known until the end of the Third Age, and it was only because of Frodo&#39;s efforts that halflings were introduced to the other kingdoms of Middle-earth. At the start of The Lord of the Rings, Gandalf is one of the few not from the North who knows enough about these beings to call them Hobbits. This was part of why Bilbo had the One Ring for so long without anyone noticing. Even Sauron had never heard of Hobbits until he captured Gollum and tortured the information about Bilbo out of him.

Similarly, Ents typically stayed within the confines of their ancient forests since caring for the trees was their job. Just like Hobbits, the beings of Middle-earth often didn&#39;t know anything about the tree shepherds, so they developed stories about dangerous tree men who dwelled in the forests. Since Hobbits and Ents kept to themselves for centuries of Middle-earth&#39;s history, Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard meeting one another was quite an event.



 Treebeard May Have Known Hobbits By Another Name 
          




Treebeard does explain in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers that he once needed to stray far from his home, and it&#39;s possible that when he did, he came across Hobbits. Centuries before the events of LOTR, the Entwives—female Ents—migrated North and never returned. Treebeard and the other Ents went looking for them but never discovered what had happened to the Entwives (this is among the unsolved mysteries of Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings). Given the area where the Entwives were thought to have ended up, it seems that Treebeard couldn&#39;t have avoided seeing Hobbits, but he likely never learned of the name they called themselves.

As large as Treebeard is, he may not have noticed much of a difference between the Men and Hobbits of the North, or he might have mistaken the small folk for Human children. Ultimately, Hobbits weren&#39;t what he and the other Ents were looking for, so they wouldn&#39;t have seemed of any importance. It wasn&#39;t until Merry and Pippin wandered into Fanghorn forest that Hobbits became essential to the Ents, and it&#39;s a good thing this meeting happened since, without this unlikely friendship, Saruman might never have been dealt with in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
