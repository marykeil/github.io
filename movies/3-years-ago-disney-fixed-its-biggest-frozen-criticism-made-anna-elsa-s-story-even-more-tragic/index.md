# 3 Years Ago, Disney Fixed Its Biggest Frozen Criticism - &amp; Made Anna &amp; Elsa s Story Even More Tragic


## SUMMARY 



&#34;Frozen 2: Dangerous Secrets&#34; by Mari Mancusi adds depth to the backstory of Anna and Elsa&#39;s parents and addresses a major criticism of the franchise.

The phrase &#34;conceal, don&#39;t feel&#34; was initially taught to Elsa by her parents to maintain the image of the royal family, but it took on a new meaning when her magical powers were discovered.

The family motto of &#34;conceal, don&#39;t feel&#34; was driven by fear, as Elsa and Anna&#39;s parents feared societal judgment and punishment, which shaped their sheltered lives and parenting techniques.

## Literature Review
Frozen&#39;s success has already guaranteed two more films in the franchise, though it was a prequel novel that fixed a major backstory criticism.
