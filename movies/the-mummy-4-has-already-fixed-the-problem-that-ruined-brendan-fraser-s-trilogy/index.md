## Literature Review

If The Mummy 4 comes to fruition, it could fix The Mummy franchise&#39;s storyline problem that brought down the luster of Brendan Fraser&#39;s trilogy. 




The prospect of The Mummy 4 with Brendan Fraser returning following his Oscar win is exciting and could repair the worst parts of The Mummy trilogy&#39;s legacy. Fraser&#39;s relevant cinematic comeback in recent times has boosted anticipation for any news about The Mummy 4. Although not much pertaining to a fourth installment has come to pass, The Mummy 4 would still fix a lot about what went wrong within the franchise, particularly in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and perhaps reinvigorate Fraser&#39;s classic trilogy.




Fraser, who famously played adventurous hero Rick O&#39;Connell in The Mummy trilogy, has indicated that he would reprise the role under the right circumstances (via Variety). His sentiment is promising given that the once beloved actor&#39;s comeback has been critically received and the high demand to continue The Mummy narrative. Unquestionably, the right circumstances for the making of The Mummy 4 is an engaging enough storyline that not only caters to the satisfaction of Fraser following his career revival but also to longtime fans who want The Mummy 4 done right.

                  What Went Wrong With The Mummy: 10 Ways The Franchise Got Worse After Brendan Fraser&#39;s 1999 Debut   In 1999 Brendan Fraser&#39;s The Mummy was a spectacular blockbuster sensation, but with every sequel movie and reboot, the franchise got worse and worse.   





 The Mummy 4 Won&#39;t Have The Story Problem That Killed The Franchise Before 
The Stale Formula Of The Trilogy Could Be Replaced With The Excitement Of Brendan Fraser Back In Action
         

With such a huge gap in time since the last chapter, 2008&#39;s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, The Mummy 4 could feasibly avoid mistakes in the direction of its overarching storyline. Audiences may recall that the classic The Mummy formula — O&#39;Connell and his team taking on an undead monster hellbent on ruling the world — had worn thin and didn&#39;t go over as well in the third film, causing it to become an unfortunate flop. Seeing as enough time has passed to forget the overdone mistakes of the franchise and begin anew, The Mummy 4 could essentially capitalize off of avoiding the same recycled storyline problems.


 




A The Mummy 4 Brendan Fraser appearance would bring with it the need to explain the passage of time, the circumstances of Rick O&#39;Connell&#39;s return to adventuring, and what happened to the original The Mummy gang in the interim. Besides the fact that this type of storyline would be relatively new to The Mummy franchise, The Mummy 4 following in this direction would give a fresh feel. A perfect mix of nostalgia and an explanation of where the well-missed cast of characters ended up could restore the hype behind the ingenuity of the original The Mummy and the aspects that worked well throughout the rest of the franchise.

                  5 Ways The Mummy 4&#39;s Story Can Remake The Original 1932 Movie   The Mummy movies are based on the classic film from 1932, but there are several missed plot points that The Mummy 4 could cover in tribute.    



 Top Gun: Maverick Proves The Mummy 4 Could Work 
Tom Cruise&#39;s Return To The Fan-Favorite Role Could Signal How Brendan Fraser&#39;s Mummy 4 Return Could Work
          




Capitalizing on the passing of time has benefited other franchise sequels, such as Bad Boys For Life, Rambo: Last Blood, and Top Gun: Maverick, and could also ensure that The Mummy 4 with Brendan Frasier brings success back to the franchise. Top Gun: Maverick is the more recent case in point. Decades later in real time and more than 30 years after completing the Top Gun program, Captain Pete Mitchell (Tom Cruise) returned to the big screen to train pilot graduates for a special mission.

Top Gun: Maverick was a huge success, as the other time gap sequels were in their own right, and it was partially due to the movie bringing back the sentimentality and utilizing the elements of the story that worked in the original movie. The epic blockbuster called back to its predecessor with a persuasive soundtrack and action-packed aerial scenes simultaneously as the time gap informed Maverick&#39;s narrative and unpacked the stories of Top Gun&#39;s supporting characters. The Mummy 4 could take a step away from its own repeated formula and venture into the time gap blueprint that made Top Gun: Maverick so popular.




                  Rachel Weisz&#39;s Mummy 4 Return Makes Perfect Sense (Despite Being Recast)   There&#39;s so much talk about Brendan Fraser returning for The Mummy 4, but Rachel Weisz reprising her role as Evelyn is just as important.

Picking Up After The Mummy 4 Could Flip The Franchise&#39;s Fortunes
          

Tom Cruise may have reinvigorated the Top Gun franchise, but that wasn&#39;t the case with 2017&#39;s The Mummy reboot. Cruise starred as The Mummy&#39;s protagonist and mercenary Nick Morton - and although Cruise had major star appeal for the reboot of the classic trilogy, the newest The Mummy was disastrous enough to generate the fall of Universal Pictures&#39; Dark Universe enterprise. Universal had planned to unload a series of monster movies that took place in a shared universe, but the plan was quickly scrapped after the 2017 movie&#39;s failure at the box office.





 

Cruise&#39;s The Mummy wasn&#39;t representative of the time gap initiative that made Top Gun work. 2017&#39;s The Mummy largely ignored the storyline found in The Mummy trilogy (or the 1932 classic of the same name), had no familiar characters, and lacked the enchanting idiosyncrasies that made Brendan Fraser&#39;s films so great. Now that Fraser is back on the scene and the potential for a fourth The Mummy installment exists, The Mummy saga has a much better chance at becoming properly reinvigorated and fixing the repetitive story problem that condemned the franchise.

              The Mummy (1999)  The Mummy (1999) is an action/adventure/fantasy film directed by Stephen Sommers that stars Brendan Fraser as the dashing Rick O&#39;Connell, an adventurer who always manages to get into trouble. Back in 1290 BC, Imhotep killed Pharaoh Seti I with the help of his wife, Anck-Su-Namun, and the two of them died with the promise to reunite in the future. Fast forward to the 1900s, siblings Jonathan and Evelyn acquire a map that will lead them to the lost city of Hamunaptra. Rick, wanting his map back, cuts a deal with them, agreeing to travel together for the promise of untold treasures. However, Hamunaptra is where Imhotep is and accidentally resurrects the now ancient mummified priest, who seeks to restore his body and revive his lost love. Rick, Jonathan, and Evelyn will have to battle with ancient mummies, death traps, and more to stop the return of Imhotep.
