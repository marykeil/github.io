# 10 Great Movie Villains Wasted In Terrible Movies


## SUMMARY 


 Jim Carrey&#39;s Riddler in Batman Forever was fun and energetic, despite the film&#39;s overall shortcomings. 
 Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron had potential but was underutilized and focused too much on humor.

## Literature Review

A villain can be the defining quality of a fantastic movie. Unfortunately, even these villain performances couldn&#39;t save their bad movies.




Nothing heightens a movie like a great villain, making it all the more disappointing when they&#39;re wasted in terrible movies. Many of the most chilling movie villains, like the Joker in The Dark Knight or Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds, prove the prestige an excellent antagonist is held to. An iconic villain can become the most memorable part of a great film, with them occasionally even overshadowing the hero.
Many factors contribute to the quality of the villain. Actors like Heath Ledger and Christoph Waltz enhanced their characters with unbelievable performances. Villains like Roy Batty in Blade Runner or Darth Vader in Star Wars are made complex by moral ambiguities and motivations, allowing audiences to connect with them. On the other hand, a villain like Sauron in The Lord of the Rings doesn&#39;t have a nuanced reasoning for his actions, yet he&#39;s still a captivating character. It&#39;s entirely subjective, but sometimes, a clearly compelling villain isn&#39;t allowed to shine due to the story around them.









 








 10  The Riddler 
Batman Forever


 







  Batman Forever  


  Release Date    June 16, 1995     Director    Joel Schumacher     Cast    Jim Carrey , Nicole Kidman , Tommy Lee Jones , Drew Barrymore , Chris O&#39;Donnell , Val Kilmer , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough , Debi Mazar     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    117 Minutes    


While it&#39;s certainly not as good as Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker or even Paul Dano&#39;s iteration of the Riddler, Jim Carrey brought eccentric, attention-grabbing energy that made his performance fun. Switching from Tim Burton to Joel Schumacher marked a notable tone shift in the classic Batman saga, and ideally, Carrey was the perfect actor to embrace the campy, comedic elements. Batman Forever is one of the worst Batman movies, but if it had all been slightly toned down and less corny, Jim Carey&#39;s Riddler could&#39;ve been a hit.





 9  Ultron 
Avengers: Age of Ultron
        

  Avengers: Age of Ultron  


  Release Date    May 1, 2015     Director    Joss Whedon     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Clark Gregg , Robert Downey Jr. , Cobie Smulders , Aaron Taylor-Johnson , Jeremy Renner , Thomas Kretschmann , Chris Evans , Don Cheadle , Mark Ruffalo , Elizabeth Olsen , Scarlett Johansson , Paul Bettany , Samuel L. Jackson , James Spader     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    141 minutes    


Being the middle film between The Avengers and Infinity War/End Game, Age of Ultron had the difficult task of utilizing a villain who could contend with a team of superheroes but not present a threat on the scale of Thanos. Ultron was as good an option as any, delivering a forceful antagonist that could reasonably hold his own against the Avengers. Unfortunately, the villain was underutilized and didn&#39;t reach his full potential, with too much focus on his quips and humor. James Spader was still excellent in the role with what he was given to work with.
            
 
 10 Best Sci-Fi Movie Villains, Ranked 
From Thanos to the Xenomorph, science fiction movies are packed with distinct and memorable villains. Here are the best sci-fi villains of all time.








 8  Hannibal Lecter 
Hannibal


 







The most significant waste of a great movie villain is one that&#39;s already proven to work. After an Academy Award-winning performance in The Silence of the Lambs, Anthony Hopkins returned to the Hannibal Lecter character for two more films, neither of which worked. Both Hannibal and Red Dragon failed to utilize Thomas Harris&#39; material. Despite Ridley Scott&#39;s direction and an excellent cast with Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, and Ray Liotta, Hannibal was a critical disaster.





 7  Catherine Tramell 
Basic Instinct (1992)
        

  Basic Instinct  


  Release Date    March 20, 1992     Director    Paul Verhoeven     Cast    Michael Douglas , Sharon Stone , George Dzundza , Jeanne Tripplehorn , Wayne Knight , Denis Arndt , Leilani Sarelle , Bruce A. Young     Rating    R     Runtime    128 minutes    


1992&#39;s Basic Instinct was a hugely popular movie for its time, but that&#39;s primarily due to the appeal for Sharon Stone, who&#39;s iconic as Catherine Tramell. Aside from her and Michael Douglas&#39; performances, the erotic thriller doesn&#39;t have much going for it. Stone doesn&#39;t shy away from the foul character, and despite her upsetting difficulties with the film&#39;s production, it remains her most impactful and famous character.





 6  Bullseye 
Daredevil (2003)
        

  Daredevil  


  Release Date    February 14, 2003     Director    Mark Steven Johnson     Cast    Ben Affleck , Jennifer Garner , Colin Farrell , Michael Clarke Duncan , Jon Favreau , Ellen Pompeo     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    103 Minutes    


Ben Affleck&#39;s Daredevil film has an assortment of missteps, as did many of the pre-MCU Marvel movies. While the superhero movie is genuinely awful, Colin Farrell&#39;s performance as the villain, Bullseye, stands out as the movie&#39;s best part. Farrell is a fantastic actor who seems to give every part his all, and the Marvel film sees him give a truly ridiculous performance as the psychotic killer. It&#39;s not the most prestigious role in his career, but Farrell made the most of his first dip in the superhero genre.





 5  Profion 
Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2000)
        

Jeremy Irons&#39; best-known villain roles are Scar in The Lion King and Ozymandias in Watchmen, but he also played a fantastic antagonist in 2000&#39;s Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The film is entirely abysmal, with a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but Jeremy Irons managed to be memorable and enjoyable in one of his most ridiculous, corny roles. Irons is extremely over-the-top as Profion, but even he couldn&#39;t save the absolute mess of the film. Luckily for fans of the game, a much better adaptation was released in 2023.





 4  Lex Luthor 
Superman Returns (2006)
        

  Superman Returns  


  Release Date    June 28, 2006     Director    Bryan Singer     Cast    Sam Huntington , James Marsden , Eva Marie Saint , Kate Bosworth , Kevin Spacey , Frank Langella , Kal Penn , Parker Posey , Brandon Routh , Marlon Brando     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    2h 34m    


There are definitely Superman movies worse than Superman Returns, but the main issue with the 2006 reboot is an entire lack of action and uninspired narrative. Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor was a perfect fit, as he had the look and proven demeanor in other films to bring a comic-accurate version of the character to life. The film&#39;s business scheme plot sacrificed much of Lex&#39;s nuance, meaning Spacey couldn&#39;t play the character to its full potential. Both Spacey and Brandon Routh as Superman were excellent casting choices that deserved better material than they were given.





 3  Darth Maul 
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999)


 







  Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace  


  Release Date    May 19, 1999     Director    George Lucas     Cast    Ewan McGregor , Liam Neeson , Natalie Portman , Jake Lloyd , Ahmed Best , Ian McDiarmid , Anthony Daniels , Kenny Baker , Pernilla August , Frank Oz , Ray Park , Samuel L. Jackson     Rating    PG     Runtime    133 minutes    


From the worst Star Wars films to the best in the series, one thing the universe has consistently excelled at is creating visually compelling characters. Well-designed appearances can go a long way in action/adventure movies, and Darth Maul is exceedingly intimidating despite having minimal dialogue in The Phantom Menace. Not to mention, the double-bladed lightsaber and fast-paced, mobile lightsaber combat brought something fresh and exciting to the prequels. The Clone Wars proves Darth Maul had a captivating story waiting beneath the surface, and the film could&#39;ve been much better with more focus on him and less on a particular Gungan.





 2  Francisco Scaramanga 
The Man with the Golden Gun
        

While Roger Moore played an excellent 007, he unfortunately was given some of the worst James Bond movies to work with, and The Man with the Golden Gun was a particularly low note. There&#39;s a vast disparity between the quality of the movie and the quality of the villain, however, as Francisco Scaramanga is played by the great Christopher Lee. Known for playing Saruman, Count Dooku, Dracula, and more, Lee is unmatched at playing twisted antagonists, and his role as the golden gun-wielding assassin is the saving grace of the awful Bond film.





 1  Sheriff Of Nottingham 
Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves
        

Alan Rickman played Hans Gruber, one of the most fantastic villain characters ever, in Die Hard, which added to the compelling mystery of Snape&#39;s morality in Harry Potter. The late great actor was terrific at playing bad guys, and he proved it by shining in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. While Kevin Costner was criticized for his performance as the titular character, Rickman was praised for adding energy and flavor to a character who&#39;d had many prior on-screen interpretations.
