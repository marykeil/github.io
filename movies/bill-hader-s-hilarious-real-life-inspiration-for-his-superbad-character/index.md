## Literature Review

Superbad is loosely based on Seth Rogen&#39;s teenage life, but Bill Hader&#39;s Superbad police officer character has an interesting backstory too.




Officer Slater is one of the best things about Superbad, and Bill Hader&#39;s Superbad character has a surprising origin story. Superbad became a cultural touchstone, encapsulating the essence of teenage antics and the quest for acceptance. The 2007 film cleverly blends crude humor with poignant moments of friendship and the bittersweet pains of growing up. Its legacy endures as a benchmark in the genre, often cited for its authentic dialogue, memorable characters, and the way it captured the zeitgeist of the 2000s. With its raw portrayal of high school life and the awkward journey into adulthood, Superbad is a Millennial-defining coming-of-age movie.




Among the standout performances in Superbad is Bill Hader&#39;s portrayal of Officer Slater. Officer Slater deviates from the typical portrayal of a movie cop, instead presenting a quirky, somewhat inept, yet surprisingly endearing personality. His unconventional approach to police work, often marked by a lack of seriousness and a penchant for getting into ridiculous situations with McLovin&#39; (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), even knowing that the character is underage, adds a unique flavor to the film&#39;s comedy. Surprisingly, however, just as Superbad is loosely based on a true story, Bill Hader&#39;s Superbad character is based on a real-life person.

 Bill Hader Based His Superbad Character On A Real-Life Cop Who Arrested Him 
          




During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Bill Hader shared an intriguing backstory about his Superbad character, Officer Slater. The actor revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life encounter with a bespectacled police officer who arrested Hader following a prank gone wrong. Hader recounted:



That is the guy that I based my character in Superbad on. I remember when I did that movie… and I go, &#39;I got messed with by a cop with glasses,&#39; and Seth [Rogen] was like, &#39;Oh yeah, that&#39;s, like, so lame. I can&#39;t take a cop with glasses seriously!&#39;&#34;





 

The origin of the prank came from Hader&#39;s father, who shared a mischievous idea from his own youth. &#34;My dad did the classic &#39;let me tell you something I did, but hey, you guys can&#39;t do this,&#39; and we were like, &#39;Uh-huh,&#39;&#34; Hader said. Following his father&#39;s footsteps, Hader and his friends set up a prank involving two trash cans and a rope across a four-lane street so the trash cans would clang against whichever car drives through the rope. The plan backfired when their unsuspecting victim turned out to be a cop car.




Hader humorously described the incident, saying, &#34;It scared the s**** out of this cop,&#34; and detailed how he tried to play it cool before ultimately getting arrested. The cop&#39;s reaction, particularly his sarcastic comment while Hader picked up beer cans — &#34;What, are y&#39;all on a budget?&#34;, referencing the Natty Light cans — added a layer of humor to an already tense situation. This real-life encounter not only provided Hader with material for his character but also added authenticity to his performance in Superbad.


 



 Superbad Writer &amp; Star Seth Rogen Loved Hader&#39;s Cop Character 
          




The inspiration behind Bill Hader&#39;s Superbad character struck a chord with Seth Rogen, the film&#39;s writer and star. Rogen appreciated Hader&#39;s humor and authenticity so much that apparently, Hader didn&#39;t have a choice in starring in the movie (via Slash Film). Hader recalls his interaction with Rogen and producer Judd Apatow:



I met with Judd Apatow and he said, &#39;So Seth and Evan said they met you and they enjoyed meeting you. They wrote this movie called Superbad, and there&#39;s a part for a cop that you&#39;re going to play.&#39; I remember he didn&#39;t ask if I would play it. He said, &#39;You&#39;re gonna play this.&#39;




Hader&#39;s ability to draw from his own experiences and channel them into his character added depth and relatability to Officer Slater, making him more than just a typical comedy movie cop. Officer Slater, as portrayed by Hader, stands out in the landscape of comedic cinema, not just for his humorous antics but for his human qualities. The character&#39;s charm lies in his approachability and the underlying sense of humor he brings to his interactions. This level of characterization is a testament to Hader&#39;s skill as an actor and Rogen&#39;s vision as a writer, both of whom understood the importance of creating Superbad characters that are as quotable as they are fresh and memorable.
