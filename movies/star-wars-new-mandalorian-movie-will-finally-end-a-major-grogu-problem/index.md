# Star Wars  New Mandalorian Movie Will Finally End A Major Grogu Problem


## SUMMARY 



  Grogu&#39;s name, initially seen as a joke, has now been accepted and acknowledged in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu show.   Naming Grogu was a challenge due to his identification as Baby Yoda, but giving him a mature name reflects his species&#39; longevity.   Naming Grogu with a Y name would have felt contrived and not true to his character arc as a Mandalorian.

## Literature Review

For the last 4 years, Star Wars has had a major Grogu problem, but The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will finally resolve the issue once and for all.




Star Wars has a Grogu problem, but The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will finally fix it. When The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu was first announced, it was exciting news due to the popularity of The Mandalorian. First released in 2019, Star Wars&#39; first live-action TV show was an instant hit. The sweet relationship between Din Djarin (then referred to exclusively as &#34;Mando&#34;) and his adopted son Grogu (then called &#34;the Child&#34;) was a refreshing change from a franchise that often focuses on a religious order that rejects such bonds. However, The Mandalorian season 2 created a problem that has plagued the show for four years. Now, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has finally rectified the issue.




In The Mandalorian season 1, Din Djarin had no way of knowing Grogu&#39;s real name. Grogu is still too young to speak, and, unlike Ahsoka, Din Djarin could not use the Force to ask Grogu his name telepathically. As such, for all of season 1 and part of season 2, Grogu was simply called &#34;the Child&#34; and &#34;kid&#34; by other characters in the show. However, from the very first episode, viewers gave him another nickname: Baby Yoda. This nickname has persisted even though his official name was revealed four years ago.

 Grogu&#39;s Name Was Originally A Joke - We All Knew He&#39;s Baby Yoda! 
          




Grogu&#39;s name was originally received by viewers as a joke. The memes mocking the name began almost the instant it was revealed. Most viewers rejected it outright, insisting that his true name was &#34;Baby Yoda.&#34; Even The Book of Boba Fett acknowledged the backlash. When Peli Motto first learns Grogu&#39;s name, she states that it is a terrible name and that she will never call him that. This attitude reflected viewers who felt that the name wasn&#39;t suitable for such a cute creature. It became such a big joke that Dave Filoni almost had Ahsoka call Grogu &#34;Baby Yoda&#34; when she first met him in season 2, episode 5 &#34;Chapter 13: The Jedi.&#34;



 The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Proves His Name Has Now Been Accepted 
         

Now, with The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu including his name in the title, Baby Yoda&#39;s real name has finally been accepted. After all, if people hated the name as much as they did before, the movie&#39;s title would be much more controversial. This signals a change in viewers&#39; attitude toward the name. It also shows that the name has become more accepted in canon. It&#39;s possible that, with the title officially acknowledging Grogu&#39;s name, even Peli Motto could start calling the adorable Force-sensitive Mandalorian apprentice &#34;Grogu.&#34;




The Mandalorian creators were always going to struggle with naming Grogu. Because he was so identifiable as Baby Yoda, no name was going to be completely accepted right away. Showrunner Jon Favreau explained why he chose the name Grogu over something cuter. As Favreau explained, Grogu&#39;s species live for an incredibly long time. Yoda was 900 years old when he died. While a cute name, such as &#34;Baby Yoda,&#34; might work when he&#39;s little, it&#39;s doubtful that Grogu would want a cutesy name at 600&#43; years old. As such, Favreau chose to give the boy a mature name.

Favreau has a valid point here. The only other two canon members of Grogu&#39;s species are Jedi Masters Yaddle and Yoda. Both were mature, ancient, and formidable Jedi. If they had been named, for example, &#34;Silly and Sparky&#34; or, even worse, had &#34;baby&#34; in their names, it would&#39;ve undermined the authority and respect they commanded. Grogu is also a powerful Force-user, and, while he is currently the human equivalent of a toddler or preschooler, he won&#39;t remain that way. He will live as a fully matured adult for hundreds of years. Forcing a silly, cutesy name on Grogu in the canon would negatively impact him when he&#39;s older.






Din Djarin actor Pedro Pascal has also been firm about using Grogu&#39;s true name, as he addressed this in his Saturday Night Live monologue by saying, &#34;His name is Grogu.&#34;




It is also good that Favreau didn&#39;t give Grogu a name that starts with the letter Y. It is already enough of a coincidence that Yoda and Yaddle had names that sounded so similar. There&#39;s no reason to believe that their entire species uses exclusively Y names. Giving Grogu a Y name would feel contrived. It would be an obvious nod to some other famous Jedi and not a name that is truly his own. Given the fact that Grogu ultimately chose the path of the Mandalorian rather than the path of the Jedi, naming him after the conventions of traditional Jedi wouldn&#39;t match his character arc. Now, Star Wars is sticking to their decision in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, and that&#39;s a wonderful sign for the galaxy&#39;s future.
