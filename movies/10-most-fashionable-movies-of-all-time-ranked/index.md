 10  Annie Hall (1977) 
Brought androgynous fashion to the forefront
        

  Annie Hall  


  Release Date    April 19, 1977     Director    Woody Allen     Cast    Woody Allen , Diane Keaton , Tony Roberts , Carol Kane , Paul Simon , Shelley Duvall     Rating    PG    


Annie Hall became an iconic fashion inspiration after its 1977 release thanks in large part to Diane Keaton’s memorable costumes. Keaton opted to style her own wardrobe for the film, appearing on screen in oversized men’s blazers, wide-legged trousers, vests, neckties, and wide-brimmed hats. Her androgynous style struck a chord, offering women a new kind of freedom of expression through fashion that blended masculine and feminine pieces. Annie Hall sparked a movement of relaxed, menswear-inspired looks among women. Its clever mixing of tailored jackets and pants with feminine blouses and accessories paved the way for a more fluid approach to fashion that still feels modern even decades later.





 9  A Single Man (2009) 
A Single Man set a new standard for men&#39;s style
        

Tom Ford&#39;s 2009 directorial debut A Single Man put a spotlight on refined men&#39;s fashion through character George&#39;s immaculately-fitted suits and elegant casual wear. Costume designer Arianne Phillips collaborated closely with Ford to craft George&#39;s elegant story, emphasizing lean, precisely-cut silhouettes with polished accessories. The film popularized slim-fitting menswear that appeared both timelessly classic yet modern. Beyond the suits, sweaters and casual collared shirts with tight knits and muted colors also permeated men&#39;s closets post-film. Its classy aesthetic and emphasis on fit over flash shifted men&#39;s fashion toward sleek sophistication. Years later, the film&#39;s aesthetic remains influential in its less-is-more approach.

The Devil Wears Prada set trends that permeated both high-fashion runways and office attire for years. Anne Hathaway&#39;s character Andy captures the transformative power of fashion as she evolves from dowdy to chic. Costume designer Patricia Field masterfully juxtaposed Andy&#39;s initial ill-fitting skirts and cardigans with the crisp blazers, pencil skirts and heels she dons as her fashion sense develops. Beyond the aesthetic shift, the film emphasized fashion as self-expression. From the beginning to the ending of The Devil Wears Prada, Andy discovers how style communicates confidence and demands respect, a valuable lesson for women climbing corporate ladders.

To Wong Foo marketed drag fashion to the masses for the first time, paving the way for RuPaul&#39;s Drag Race and other media highlighting fluid styles.





 6  Marie Antoinette (2006) 
A cutting-edge take on 18th century fashion
        

Considered one of Sofia Coppola’s best movies, Marie Antoinette stands as one of cinema’s most influential historical fashion films. 18th century silhouettes with punk rock details were crafted for an avant-garde revisionist vision of Marie Antoinette’s wardrobe. The film sparked a revival of rococo style, from decadent ball gowns with pastel hues to sky-high wigs and whimsical shoes. The Oscar-winning costumes reinvigorated interest in the craft and aesthetics of period dressing. Its creative license to reframe stuffy costumes with modern touches expanded the possibilities for integrating vintage pieces into one’s personal style.

As both a defining snapshot of 1990’s youth culture and an influential fashion inspiration, Clueless remains one of cinema’s most iconic depictions of decade-defining style. Costume designer Mona May brought Cher Horowitz’s vision to life through quintessential staples like plaid miniskirts, knee-highs, crop tops, and kitten heels. The blend of Valley Girl fashions with preppy, polished accents, Clueless paved the way for a playful and glamorous school-centric aesthetic that still feels fresh today. Its costumes sparked trends for baby doll dresses, fluffy pens, two-piece suit sets, and tiny purses that endured years beyond its release.

With Margot Robbie in a series of scene-stealing, candy-hued outfits, each more playful and fun than the last, Barbie delivered a contemporary twist on timeless glamour. The Barbie movie’s best outfits celebrate fashion at its most experimental. The level of enthusiasm surrounding its costumes has cemented Barbie’s status as a revolutionary fashion moment bound to ignite new trends.





 2  The Matrix (1999) 
Highlighted 1990s subcultures and their fashions
        

The cyberpunk sci-fi film The Matrix made an unparalleled impact on futuristic fashion. Black leather trench coats and slim sunglasses became pop culture symbols, and the innovative wire-work technology even allowed costumes to defy physics onscreen. Rendering virtual reality through a brooding, post-apocalyptic lens, The Matrix dictated millennial subcultures from Goth to streetwear. Its groundbreaking aesthetic still persists through ongoing revivals of 90s rave, grunge and cyberpunk styles. The enduring status of Neo’s signature look cements The Matrix as the preeminent Genesis of postmodern science fiction fashion.





 1  Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s (1961) 
Holly Golightly became fashion’s first Hollywood icon
        

  Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s

Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s is cinema&#39;s most enduring style inspiration due to Audrey Hepburn&#39;s iconic portrayal of eccentric socialite Holly Golightly. Acclaimed designer Givenchy handcrafted the character’s looks, including her famed black Givenchy gown, opera-length gloves and dazzling tiara that define timeless elegance to this day. However, Hepburn’s influence permeates deeper than that single, classic ensemble. Her style exuded Parisian sophistication while feeling uniquely her own. Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s revolutionized how costume design could propel new trends by blending designer pieces with a star&#39;s personal flair. No subsequent cinema style moment has achieved such staying power or volume of real-world style imitation.
