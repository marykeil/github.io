## Literature Review

Over the course of the Oscars’ extensive history, only seven women have been nominated for Best Director at the awards show – who are they?




The 96th Oscars are approaching, and over the course of the award show&#39;s 96-year history, seven females have been recognized for their directorial work, and only three of them have won. The Best Director category is notorious for snubbing women, a resolution anyone could come to just by looking at the past 95 awards ceremonies. However, some have slipped through the cracks and received praise for their filmmaking efforts, and one woman has even been nominated twice, 29 years apart.
The nominees for the upcoming 96th Academy Awards have not been announced yet — the reveal is scheduled for January 23, 2024. However, one female (who has already received a nod in the category before) is a shoo-in to claim one of the prestigious five spots in the Best Director category. Greta Gerwig directed Barbie, which was the highest-grossing film of 2023 and received widespread praise. It would be a complete shock if Gerwig isn&#39;t one of the Best Director nominees at the 96th Academy Awards, but even if she is, there would still be only seven female directors who have been recognized for their work at the Oscars.









 








 8  Lina Wertmüller: Seven Beauties (1976) 
Lost to John G. Avildsen for Rocky
        

Lina Wertmüller was the first woman to receive a Best Director nomination, and she was recognized for helming Seven Beauties, a 1975 Italian film. Seven Beauties revolves around an Italian everyman who is captured and sent to a German prison camp, where he reminisces about his seven unattractive sisters and a plethora of noteworthy events in his life. Wertmüller, who also wrote the movie, ultimately lost to John G. Avildsen for Rocky at the 49th Academy Awards. But being the first person to represent women in the Best Director category was a significant feat, and everyone should celebrate Wertmüller&#39;s accomplishments.

 7  Jane Campion: The Piano (1993) 
Lost to Steven Spielberg for The Schindler&#39;s List
        

Almost 20 years following Lina Wertmüller&#39;s Best Director nomination, Jane Campion became the second female to be honored in the category at the 66th Academy Awards. Campion, a renowned filmmaker from New Zealand, was nominated for directing The Piano, a historical drama movie about a mute Scottish woman, played by Holly Hunter, who moves to New Zealand with her daughter when her father sells her into marriage. The 1993 film received positive reviews and eight nominations at the Oscars that year, winning three — Best Actress for Hunter, Best Supporting Actress for Anna Paquin, and Best Original Screenplay for Campion. However, Campion lost Best Director to Steven Spielberg for The Schindler&#39;s List.





 6  Sofia Coppola: Lost In Translation (2003) 
Lost to Peter Jackson for The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
        

Ten years following Jane Campion&#39;s nomination, Sofia Coppola earned a spot in the Best Director category at the 76th Academy Awards, making her the third woman recognized for her directorial efforts. Coppola was nominated for her film Lost in Translation, which starred Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson and told the story of a movie star going through a midlife crisis. The movie received widespread praise and four nominations at the Oscars. Coppola won the award for Best Original Screenplay but lost to Peter Jackson in the Best Director category.
























 5  Kathryn Bigelow: The Hurt Locker (2009) 
First female to win the Best Director Oscar


 







Kathryn Bigelow made Oscars history when she became the first woman to win Best Director. She was nominated for her work on The Hurt Locker at the 82nd Academy Awards ceremony, and Bigelow was up against the likes of James Cameron for Avatar, Lee Daniels for Precious, Jason Reitman for Up in the Air, and Quentin Tarantino for Inglourious Basterds. Ultimately, Bigelow pulled out a win for herself and women everywhere.





 4  Greta Gerwig: Lady Bird (2017) 
Lost to Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water


 







As referenced above, Greta Gerwig has many accomplishments in her relatively short directorial career, and it all started when she was nominated for Best Director at the 90th Academy Awards for her first (solely) directed film, Lady Bird. Unfortunately, Gerwig lost to Guillermo del Toro for The Shape of Water (which also won Best Picture that night in 2017). Given her talent, though, Gerwig will undoubtedly have many more opportunities to take home the award for Best Director (perhaps she will win for Barbie at the 96th Oscars, but she will likely have to beat out the favorite, Christopher Nolan for Oppenheimer).

Barbie will undoubtedly be nominated for multiple Oscars at the upcoming awards show, including one that will rectify a previous Greta Gerwig snub.








 3  Emerald Fennell: Promising Young Woman (2021) 
Lost to Chloé Zhao for Nomadland
        

In a surprise turn of events, the 93rd Academy Awards featured two women nominated for Best Director, including Emerald Fennell for Promising Young Woman. This was Fennell&#39;s first recognition in the category, and Promising Young Woman was her feature directorial debut. The 2020 movie depicts a woman, played by Carey Mulligan, seeking vengeance for a sexual assault that happened to her friend in college. Although Fennell won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay at the 2021 awards ceremony, she lost Best Director to another woman on this list.





 2  Chloé Zhao: Nomadland (2021) 
Second female to win the Best Director Oscar
        

Chloé Zhao became the second woman to win Best Director at the Oscars when she was honored at the 93rd Academy Awards ceremony for helming Nomadland. The 2020 drama also took home the award for Best Picture that night, which secured Zhao another Oscar. Aside from her two wins, Zhao was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing but lost in both categories. Nevertheless, the 93rd Academy Awards was a night to celebrate Zhao, who was also the first woman of color to win Best Director.

Marvel&#39;s Eternals and 2021 Best Picture winner Nomadland share more than just a director - the films have similarities within them, too. 








 1  Jane Campion: The Power of the Dog (2022) 
Third female to win the Best Director Oscar


 







Jane Campion became the first woman to be nominated twice for Best Director at the Oscars and the third woman to win when she took home the trophy for her work on The Power of the Dog at the 94th Academy Awards. Campion was previously recognized at the prestigious awards show for directing The Piano in 1993. But her first win came in 2021 for the Western psychological drama based on the 1967 novel of the same name by Thomas Savage. So, as one can tell, the Oscars are making progress regarding honoring female directors, and hopefully, the 2024 ceremony will recognize another woman filmmaker — Greta Gerwig for Barbie.
The 96th Academy Awards will take place on March 10, 2024.
