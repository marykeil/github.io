  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Zack Snyder&rsquo;s involvement in Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is extensive, with him being credited as writer, director, producer, and cinematographer, showcasing his dedication to the project.   The film embodies Snyder&rsquo;s signature visual style, featuring slow motion, high-contrast color palettes, and other trademarks that both fans and critics recognize.   Rebel Moon is a notable departure for Snyder, as it is one of his few original properties and allows him full creative control, making it the most &ldquo;Snyder-y&rdquo; film in his career.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Zack Snyder&rsquo;s iconic style is apparent throughout his filmography, but Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is Zack Snyder&rsquo;s most Snyder-y movie yet.</p>
<p>Zack Snyder is a director known for putting a lot of himself into all of his movies, but Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is the most Zack Snyder-y movie Zack Snyder has ever made. Ever since the release of 300 in 2007, the phrase &ldquo;a Zack Snyder movie&rdquo; has meant something very specific and audiences can quickly identify key traits like slow motion, desaturated and high-contrast color palettes, muscled physique, over-the-top violence, and more.</p>
<p>While any single movie made by Snyder bears his creative stamp, many of them differ on some level, such as the lack of slo-mo in Man of Steel or the less stylized approaches of Dawn of the Dead or Army of the Dead, but Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire checks all the boxes of what one should expect from Zack Snyder while also seeing one of the highest levels of the filmmaker&rsquo;s involvement at many stages of production, earning him numerous credits in addition to his role as director, including some uncredited participation in areas like art design and storyboarding.</p>

<p>Zack Snyder Has 4 (Official) Credits On Rebel Moon
Zack Snyder&rsquo;s name is all over Rebel Moon&rsquo;s Credits.
Close</p>
<p>Zack Snyder is credited as writer, director, producer, and cinematographer on Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire, tied only with Army of the Dead as the director&rsquo;s most-credited project. Snyder has been developing the Rebel Moon story for several decades since he originally pitched it in film school in the 1980s, but he also shares a screenplay credit with Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad who helped him flesh out the actual script. Snyder began acting as his own cinematographer with Army of the Dead, although he served as cinematographer on his own projects as a music video and commercial director in the 90s and 2000s.</p>
<p>Zack Snyder even had a set of custom anamorphic Leica lenses created to shoot Rebel Moon.</p>
<p>In addition to his credited roles, Snyder was also highly involved with drawing Rebel Moon&rsquo;s concept art and storyboarding process. Snyder typically draws storyboards for every scene of his movies before entering production, and for Rebel Moon Snyder drew over 3,000 storyboards, but he also drew hundreds of concept images as he worked with the production design and art teams to flesh out the look and feel of the Rebel Moon universe. Snyder didn&rsquo;t receive official credit for any of these roles, but it shows he was involved far beyond his four official credits.</p>
<p>Rebel Moon&rsquo;s Visual Style Has All the Snyder-isms
Slow motion, monochromatic high-contrast colors, and all the other Snyder-y touches.
Close</p>
<p>Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire&rsquo;s visual style has everything you&rsquo;d expect visually from a Zack Snyder movie, from its use of high-contrast monochromatic color palettes to the abundance of slow-motion, Rebel Moon includes a little bit of everything Snyder&rsquo;s style is known for, for better or worse. Audiences that appreciate Snyder&rsquo;s movies tend to embrace his visual style, while his detractors find it bombastic and over-indulgent. In either case, Snyder&rsquo;s iconic visual style in Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire is instantly identifiable by lovers and haters alike.</p>

<p>Of course, Snyder&rsquo;s visual style was established by many movies prior to Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire, so it wouldn&rsquo;t be a stretch to claim 300 or Watchmen or Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Justice League are a more accurate sample of his work; however, given Snyder&rsquo;s level of involvement in Rebel Moon, particularly his role as cinematographer, while the other movies mentioned were collaborations with Larry Fong and Fabian Wagner as cinematographer, makes Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire&rsquo;s style rise to the top as the most &ldquo;Snyder&rdquo; of all Snyder&rsquo;s movies.</p>
<p>Rebel Moon is a Totally New, Original Property From Zack Snyder
While most of his filmography is adapting works of other writers, Rebel Moon is of of Snyder&rsquo;s few original properties.
Close</p>
<p>Zack Snyder&rsquo;s rise to fame in Hollywood came as the director of reboots and adaptations, beginning with Dawn of the Dead, before he adapted Frank Miller&rsquo;s 300, Kathryn Lasky&rsquo;s Guardians of Ga&rsquo;Hoole, Alan Moore&rsquo;s Watchmen, and directed three DC Comics adaptations. Snyder&rsquo;s biggest films being adaptations make Revel Moon all the more novel, as Snyder isn&rsquo;t only unrestrained by studio demands, but also has no pre-established lore or canon to which he&rsquo;s beholden, meaning Snyder has full creative control of Rebel Moon. The Rebel Moon universe can be whatever Snyder wants it to be, making it the most &ldquo;Snyder-y&rdquo; any of Snyder&rsquo;s movies could be.</p>
<p>Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire isn&rsquo;t Snyder&rsquo;s first original work, Sucker Punch and Army of the Dead were also original stories conceived by Snyder, although Sucker Punch was made as a one-off story and Army of the Dead, while it also kicked off its own universe (with tangential ties to Rebel Moon), isn&rsquo;t quite as expansive as Snyder&rsquo;s core Rebel Moon mythology. In the case of Sucker Punch, studio meddling and MPAA requirements hobbled Snyder&rsquo;s full vision for the story (although plans for the director&rsquo;s cut seem to be coming to fruition).</p>
<p>Rebel Moon&rsquo;s PG-13 Cut Re-Creates and Ironic Snyder Tradition
Once again, everyone is calling for the release of a Zack Snyder director&rsquo;s cut.
Close</p>
<p>Of course, with an expanded R-rated cut of Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire on the way, some might say that makes the PG-13 version of the movie &ldquo;less&rdquo; Snyder-y than the full &ldquo;Snyder Cut&rdquo; of the movie, which will inherently be even &ldquo;more Snyder-y&rdquo; than this cut, but in an ironic twist, a cut compromised by runtime and rating requirements is another strong aspect of Snyder&rsquo;s Hollywood lore. While it may be somewhat cynically baked into the release cycle to amplify demands for the &ldquo;Snyder Cut&rdquo; of Rebel Moon, it&rsquo;s also a core aspect of any Snyder movie to anticipate a superior, longer, more R-rated version to be released later.</p>
<p>Whether or not releasing a two-hour PG-13 cut of Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire and making audiences wait for the three-hour R-rated version was a smart strategy by Netflix remains to be seen, but it does ironically maintain Snyder&rsquo;s tradition of releasing shorter &ldquo;compromised&rdquo; cuts of his movies first, leaving fans demanding the more pure, more &ldquo;Snyder,&rdquo; version later. Regardless, Rebel Moon - Part 1: A Child of Fire and Rebel Moon - Part 2: The Scargiver are both set to provide audiences the full Snyder experience.</p>
