## Literature Review

Jason Statham&#39;s 2005 action movie Transporter 2 is launched to Netflix success following the debut of his latest action movie The Beekeeper. 




The action movie Transporter 2 has been launched to success on the Netflix Global Top 10. Transporter 2 is a 2005 action movie directed by Louis Leterrier and starring Jason Statham alongside Amber Valletta, Keith David, Matthew Modine, and Kate Nauta. Its plot focuses on the titular transporter, Frank Martin (Statham), who becomes implicated in a mysterious kidnapping involving the son of a US official.




Now, Transporter 2 has found Netflix success on the platform’s Global Top 10. The movie came in at No. 2 for the week of January 8 through January 14, with 5.8 million views. Topping the list this week was Netflix’s new action movie Lift, which boasted an impressive 32.8 million views.


 How The Beekeeper Is Contributing To Transporter 2’s Success 
          

Transporter 2 is the second entry in an early Statham franchise. The movie made a small splash at the box office, raking in $89 million worldwide on an estimated $32 million budget. It received mixed reviews from critics, holding a 52% on Rotten Tomatoes. The film was successful enough to warrant a sequel, Transporter 3, as well as a spinoff TV series and a less successful film reboot, The Transporter Refueled.



The Transporter Refueled was released in 2015 and starred Ed Skrein rather than Statham.







While these sequels gave The Transporter franchise a legacy of their own, its Netflix renaissance is likely due to Statham’s current action hit, The Beekeeper. Released on January 12, The Beekeeper has had a relatively successful run in theaters thus far. It opened to over $21 million worldwide and boasts a respectable Rotten Tomatoes score of 69%.

                  The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes Scores Break Jason Statham&#39;s 18-Year Record   The Beekeeper&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes scores have solidified, and the movie broke records for a Jason Statham action movie franchise starter with them.   

Those who have just been excited by the action of The Beekeeper were likely looking to Netflix for more Statham action films. The success of Transporter 2, as a result, will probably also help the new movie, as the exposure of Statham in the Netflix charts might encourage more people to see his current theatrical work. Time will tell as The Beekeeper continues its run in wide release.
