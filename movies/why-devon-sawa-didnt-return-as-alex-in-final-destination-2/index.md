## Literature Review

Devon Sawa&#39;s Alex was the protagonist in Final Destination&#39;s first installment. However, he only made one appearance in the long-running series.




Final Destination&#39;s protagonist, Alex Browning, is one of Final Destination&#39;s most popular characters despite only appearing in one of the franchise&#39;s movies. Final Destination is a supernatural horror movie that centers around the strange and gruesome deaths of a group of teenagers after they narrowly avoid meeting their untimely fates aboard a doomed airline flight. Known for its creatively brutal deaths and the tension and suspense that builds up to each character&#39;s respective demise, the Final Destination franchise debuted in 2000 with Final Destination, and the upcoming Final Destination 6 is reported to be a reboot of the franchise, thus continuing the long-running series&#39; legacy.




While the horror genre thrives on its ability to write compelling scream queens and feature some of the best final girls in horror movies, the genre has featured just as interesting male protagonists who enjoyed acclaim either because of their intuition, bravery, or overall personality. In the case of Final Destination&#39;s Alex, he&#39;s respected among horror fans because he possesses all the great traits of a horror movie protagonist. Despite Alex&#39;s reception, actor Devon Sawa didn&#39;t reprise the role in 2003&#39;s Final Destination 2. With Final Destination 6 in the works, developments regarding Sawa&#39;s departure have surfaced.

As is typically the case when actors can&#39;t reprise a popular role for subsequent entries in a long-running franchise, Sawa&#39;s busy schedule prevented him from appearing in Final Destination 2. Following the success of Final Destination, Sawa starred alongside Bill Pullman in the American crime film, The Guilty, and he played what is arguably his second most recognized role as Stan in the music video for Eminem&#39;s smash hit, &#34;Stan,&#34; the same year. Additionally, series creator Jeffrey Reddick confirmed he always intended to bring Sawa back as Alex, but because of the actor&#39;s busy schedule, Clear Rivers&#39;s role was beefed up in Final Destination 2.




Despite his absence from Final Destination 2, Sawa has remained a prominent figure in the horror genre, with notable appearances in Fred Durst&#39;s The Fanatic, and even more significantly, his multiple roles in the horror TV series, Chucky. In Chucky, Sawa plays twin brothers Logan and Lucas Wheeler in season 1, Father Bryce in season 2, and as the President of the United States, James Collins, in season 3. Furthermore, Sawa appears in a cameo in Final Destination 5, as Alex is seen being escorted off the ill-fated Flight 180 that claims the lives of the movie&#39;s protagonists. Despite Sawa&#39;s departure, Alex has left a strong impression on Final Destination.

While it is true that Sawa&#39;s schedule prevented him from returning to Final Destination 2, it&#39;s possible he could have made an appearance in Final Destination 3 had the studios decided to keep his character alive. However, as revealed in 2006&#39;s Final Destination 2, Alex is unceremoniously killed off-screen sometime prior to the events of the film in a freak accident involving a falling brick. In an interview with Collider, Reddick clarified that while there was an issue with scheduling, he was still annoyed with the decision to kill off Alex in such a manner.




Although Reddick&#39;s quote implies Sawa and the studio may have had a falling out, it does lend credence to Final Destination&#39;s cliffhanger ending, setting the stage for not just a sequel, but also for Alex&#39;s return. However, Reddick was able to strengthen Clear&#39;s character in the sequel by depicting her in a mental health institute as she blamed herself for Alex&#39;s untimely death. Furthermore, Clear&#39;s role as the new Alex in Final Destination 2 meant that she was able to help Kimberly Corman navigate the deadly cat and mouse with death. Nevertheless, Reddick had interesting plans for Alex if he appeared in Final Destination 2.

Sawa&#39;s Alex appearing in Final Destination 2 would have sent the franchise in a different direction, as Reddick originally planned to depict Alex and Clear as a couple with a newborn baby. However, the studios&#39; decision to kill Alex off-screen resulted in Clear losing most of her sanity and being committed to a mental health institute instead. Regardless of Alex&#39;s absence from Final Destination 2, his bravery when confronting death, and compassion for his friends and even bullies solidify him as one of the best characters in Final Destination.
