## Literature Review

Tom Cruise has announced an exciting new deal to develop movies with Warner Bros. Discovery, meaning that he should move on from Mission: Impossible.




Tom Cruise has just announced a new deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, meaning that he can finally do what he does best - and it&#39;s not Mission: Impossible. Tom Cruise is one of the most recognizable and bankable stars of the modern era, with nearly every film he touches being guaranteed gold. Despite this, Cruise has only been associated with a handful of franchises for the past few decades, which is a real shame. Luckily, Tom Cruise&#39;s new Warner Bros. Discovery deal could change that, allowing the beloved actor to enter an all-new era of his prestigious film career.




Tom Cruise and Warner Bros. will be joining forces to develop original movies as well as movies that dip into the studio&#39;s legendary well of IPs, with the announcement of this collaboration being immensely exciting for fans of movies as a whole. This deal potentially means that Tom Cruise could get his hands on some of Warner Bros.&#39;s biggest franchises, with him potentially revitalizing some of their biggest properties. However, it also means that Tom Cruise can take some big risks on original films, with this potentially signaling a major shift in the currently blockbuster-centric Hollywood model that has been growing for the past few decades.

                  Edge of Tomorrow 2 Is Now  r Than Ever Thanks To Tom Cruise&#39;s New Deal   Tom Cruise has signed a brand new deal with Warner Bros., and the terms of it can be what Edge of Tomorrow 2 needs to finally happen.   


 It&#39;s Time For Tom Cruise To Retire The Mission: Impossible Franchise 
         




Tom Cruise&#39;s deal with Warner Bros. Discovery signals a big change in his career path, hinting that it is finally time for Cruise to retire the Mission: Impossible franchise. Mission: Impossible is arguably the actor&#39;s most iconic series, with it being where he got his reputation for being an action star who does his own stunts. 2023&#39;s Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One is the seventh film in the franchise, and with Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two on the way, now is the perfect time to conclude Cruise&#39;s biggest franchise.

More Mission: Impossible movies will only distract from Tom Cruise being able to make exciting new films under the Warner Bros. Discovery deal, and now that the franchise has had its time in the sun, it is time to move on. Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One&#39;s box office failure is a sign that the franchise may be running out of steam, with it not doing nearly as well as its predecessors. Tom Cruise should end the Mission: Impossible franchise while it&#39;s ahead and move on to the next big thing, with the next big thing in question presumably being an exciting new product of the Warner Bros. Discovery deal.






 Tom Cruise Has Excelled In Unexpected And Risky Roles 
          

Throughout his career, Tom Cruise has excelled in unexpected and risky roles, something that can be brought back with the Warner Bros. Discovery deal. Cruise&#39;s role as Vincent in Collateral went completely against the actor&#39;s public image, with him playing a psychotic killer who shows little emotion or remorse. Appearing in Stanley Kubrick&#39;s immensely sexual film Eyes Wide Shut was also a big gamble, but he pulled it off fantastically. Even Cruise&#39;s role as Les Grossman came completely out of nowhere, but the comedic performance has gone down as one of the best in the actor&#39;s extensive and varied filmography.

While Tom Cruise took on a variety of exciting and risky roles throughout the 1990s and 2000s, this career trend has fallen to the wayside, with Cruise instead putting more focus on surefire franchise successes like Mission: Impossible, Top Gun: Maverick, Jack Reacher, and The Mummy. While this has gone a long way in propelling Cruise into being an A-list action star, it has had the downside of taking away from Cruise&#39;s dramatic and comedic performances. The Warner Bros. Discovery deal could allow Cruise to tap back into this side of the medium, and it would only require him to back off of Mission: Impossible movies.






 The WBD Deal Could Mean Another New Chapter In Tom Cruise&#39;s Legendary Career 
          

The Warner Bros. Discovery deal is immensely exciting for Tom Cruise fans, as it could signal the start of a new chapter in Tom Cruise&#39;s legendary career. The deal could cause the actor to take on more daring and risky roles once again, hearkening back to some of Tom Cruise&#39;s other best performances. While there is no telling what movies could come out of the Tom Cruise and Warner Bros. Discovery deal, it will undoubtedly be something new, which is why it is one of the most exciting stories to come out of Hollywood in a while.
