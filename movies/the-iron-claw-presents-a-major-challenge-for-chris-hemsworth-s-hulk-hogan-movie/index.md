After the incredible reception to The Iron Claw, Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan film has plenty to live up to and presents a major challenge. The Iron Claw achieved Zac Efron&#39;s highest-rated Rotten Tomatoes score in a film where he plays the lead role, emphasizing what an instant success the movie became for the actor. Efron&#39;s performance alongside a strong cast helped make the wrestling movie a hit, creating more pressure for Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan biopic. There has already been some trouble with the movie&#39;s production as Hulk Hogan provided an update on the film starring Chris Hemsworth, claiming Netflix missed the date.

While Hogan claimed he still wanted Chris Hemsworth and director, Todd Phillips, to make the film, he also claimed to have moved on. It does appear the biopic will still happen at some point, but it now must compete with The Iron Claw&#39;s monumental success. The Wrestler and Fighting with My Family have already created big expectations to produce good wrestling films and The Iron Claw has only made things even more challenging for Hemsworth&#39;s movie. Hemsworth may have the physique and charisma to lead such a daunting project, but after so many positive reviews for The Iron Claw, there will be even more scrutiny on his film.

After receiving such strong reviews, The Iron Claw forces Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan film to step up and meet the same standard. While the Von Erichs don&#39;t have the same notoriety as Hulk Hogan or other mainstream wrestlers, the family was legendary in the wrestling world and had a compelling story to tell. Efron&#39;s film did the family justice, as did his individual performance, which is evidenced by the glowing reviews. Although there were some tweaks for entertainment purposes, The Iron Claw told Kevin Von Erich&#39;s true life story and highlighted how exciting films focused on the wrestling industry can be.

The endorsement from people within the industry was also beneficial to The Iron Claw being as accurate and realistic as possible while still focusing on entertainment. Real wrestlers appeared in The Iron Claw, including former AEW champion Maxwell Jacob Friedman (MJF), adding to the biopic&#39;s legitimacy. With serious performances, real-life wrestling endorsement, and an accurate portrayal of the family&#39;s interesting story, The Iron Claw has set the standard for wrestling films while simultaneously raising the bar for future projects. In doing so, it has also ensured Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan movie must be of a similar quality, otherwise it will fall flat in comparison.



Chris Hemsworth&#39;s untitled Hulk Hogan biopic still has no official release date.






 Chris Hemsworth Will Have To Try And Beat Zac Efron&#39;s The Iron Claw Performance 
          

One of the biggest takeaways from The Iron Claw was Zac Efron&#39;s performance, which Chris Hemsworth will have to try and top. Efron has been lavished with praise for his portrayal of Kevin Von Erich. The supporting cast also helped elevate Efron&#39;s role, and it is easily some of the actor&#39;s best work in years. These are the sort of expectations that will be placed on Hemsworth and, given the actor&#39;s accolades and Hulk Hogan&#39;s lively persona, the pressure is even greater. Hulk Hogan is one of wrestling&#39;s most iconic figures and this gives Hemsworth more to work with, but his performance will be pivotal to the movie&#39;s success.

Regardless of what the Hulk Hogan movie&#39;s story focuses on, Chris Hemsworth will be the most significant factor in making it work. If his performance isn&#39;t memorable and believable, the plot of the film likely won&#39;t matter. On the other hand, a strong outing from Hemsworth could save the movie, even if it doesn&#39;t have the best story. Zac Efron certainly hasn&#39;t done Hemsworth any favors by being so good as Kevin Von Erich, but it is something the Marvel star can learn from and use to boost his performance. Nailing the role of Hulk Hogan could potentially see Hemsworth&#39;s biopic not only compete with The Iron Claw but surpass it.

 How Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan Movie Can Be Better Than The Iron Claw 
          

There are many ways Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan movie could be even better than The Iron Claw. A film focused on Hulk Hogan already has an advantage given his notoriety, longevity, and legendary status in the wrestling world. Including Hulk Hogan&#39;s most iconic matches and moments in Hemsworth&#39;s movie, will be more memorable for casual wrestling fans and be even bigger than those in The Iron Claw. The Von Erich family&#39;s story is more emotional and is a true underdog tale. Hogan&#39;s biopic can offer something different by playing to his status as one of the most renowned wrestlers of all time.

Using massive crowds, iconic WrestleMania moments, and even bigger names in the industry will all help elevate the project. Not only will Hogan have contacts that can feature in the film, but Hemsworth will also be able to attract some big co-stars. There are plenty of actors who could join Hemsworth&#39;s Hulk Hogan movie and could play some well-known, real-life figures. Leaning into Hogan&#39;s over-the-top wrestling persona would also make for a memorable performance while making the more real and emotional moments hit deeper. The Iron Claw will be hard to beat, but with how different Hogan&#39;s biopic could be, there is real potential that Hemsworth could pull it off.
