## Literature Review

Jeffrey Wright, who played CIA operative Felix Leiter, addresses whether a Black James Bond could be on the cards after Daniel Craig’s farewell.




Former James Bond franchise actor Jeffrey Wright, who played Felix Leiter, comments on whether there could be a Black 007. Based on the acclaimed novels by author Ian Fleming, the role of Bond has now been played by seven actors (counting David Niven) across almost many decades. Daniel Craig was the most recent star to take on the role, and, after his exit as 007 during No Time To Die&#39;s emotional ending, countless rumors and reports have surfaced regarding who could be next in line.




Now, as news on Bond 26 remains scarce, Wright shares his thoughts about the possibility of a Black 007 during a recent interview with Deadline. Although seven actors have now portrayed 007, all of them have been white, and Wright expresses an openness to see a Black star take on the role instead. Check out the actor&#39;s full comment below:



&#34;I mean, it’s feasible. They’re out there now. Those guys are out there now at the underbelly of all of this, yeah. So why not, if you find the right actor.&#34;
