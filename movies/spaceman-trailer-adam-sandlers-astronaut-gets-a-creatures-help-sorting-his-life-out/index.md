## Literature Review

Netflix unveils the official trailer for the upcoming science fiction drama Spaceman, starring Adam Sandler, Paul Dano, and Carey Mulligan.




The Spaceman trailer has been released. The upcoming Netflix science fiction drama movie, which was directed by Johan Renck, is an adaptation of the 2017 Jaroslav Kalfař novel Spaceman of Bohemia. It is the latest collaboration between Netflix and Adam Sandler, whose most recent starring role for the streamer was in the animated movie Leo. It also features a star-studded ensemble cast that includes Paul Dano, Carey Mulligan, Kunal Nayyar, Lena Olin, and Isabella Rossellini.




Following up on the Spaceman teaser trailer that was released in December, Netflix has now unveiled the full-length trailer. Check it out below:


 

The trailer opens by setting up how lonely Sandler&#39;s title character Jakub Procházka feels after being on a solo space mission for nearly 200 days. However, things change for him when a mysterious creature named Hanuš (Dano) appears and helps him work to mend the growing rift between the astronaut and his wife Lenka (Mulligan).


 What the Spaceman Trailer Reveals About the Upcoming Movie 
          

The Spaceman trailer is relatively unusual for a collaboration between Netflix and Sandler, as it doesn&#39;t feature a single moment that is played for laughs. This isn&#39;t necessarily a surprise, as Renck is best known for helming the decidedly non-comic Chernobyl. Also, Sandler has long switched between broad humor and artistic drama throughout his career. However, his Netflix movies have typically been low-rated comedies such as The Ridiculous Six, The Do-Over, and Sandy Wexler.




                  Adam Sandler&#39;s Uncut Gems Follow-up Can Fully End His Bad Movie Curse   Following the rampant success of Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler&#39;s upcoming projects are an indication that his bad movie streak could be coming to an end.   

Although he dabbled in drama for the 2022 Netflix movie Hustle, Sandler followed that sports drama up with the comedies You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah and Leo. Spaceman coming so soon after Hustle would nevertheless seem to indicate that Adam Sandler Netflix movies are shifting toward a more dramatic focus. This could be a boon for the actor, who recently received awards buzz for his dramatic role in the 2019 drama Uncut Gems.

It remains to be seen if Spaceman gets any play in the 2025 awards season. This may be unlikely considering how early in the year it comes out, as many awards bodies tend to focus on movies released during the prestige season later in the year. However, it will nevertheless showcase Sandler&#39;s range as a performer and perhaps lead to even more dramatic roles in the future.
