## Literature Review

The new Mean Girls musical remake has an opportunity to make the film feel modern, and the trailer proves it put a meta spin on an iconic scene.




The new Mean Girls film has an opportunity to set itself apart from the beloved 2004 comedy and it does that with a hilarious meta spin on one of the original&#39;s most iconic scenes. When it comes to iconic moments, Mean Girls was filled with them, so the new musical remake has many options to adapt two decades later. From wearing pink on Wednesday and so many &#34;fetch&#34; Mean Girls quotes, the comedy film is a true cult icon, which is why a remake is happening.




The new version of Mean Girls will be a musical, based on the Broadway musical of the same name and it has a new cast. Angourie Rice plays Cady Heron, Reneé Rapp reprises her role from the musical as Georgina George, and they star alongside Auliʻi Cravalho, Christopher Briney, Jaquel Spivey, and Bebe Wood. The remake will premiere on January 12, 2024, with a screenplay from Tina Fey, who reprises her role as Ms. Norbury, as well as Tim Meadows as Principal Duvall. Among the newcomers are Jenna Fischer, Busy Philipps, Jon Hamm, and Ashley Park, and the musical remake found a way to set itself apart from the original.

                  10 Most Exciting Things To Expect From 2024&#39;s Mean Girls Remake   The recent success of musicals and a promising trailer are enough reasons to get excited about the new Mean Girls musical remake&#39;s release.

The new Mean Girls trailer proves that the film put its own hilarious meta spin on the original film&#39;s sex ed scene. In the original Mean Girls, Coach Carr (then played by Dwayne Hill) holds a sex ed class where tells students not to have sex, otherwise they&#39;d get chlamydia and then die. That is before handing out condoms to everybody, and before it was revealed he had relationships with his students. Carr was by far the least qualified person for the sex ed class, but he did it anyway, and the scene made it the remake, as well.

In the new version of Mean Girls, the film puts a hilarious meta spin on the same scene. Instead of recreating the original moment, this time, Coach Carr, who is played by Jon Hamm, is even more outwardly sexist about the sex ed class when trying to spell &#34;hormones.&#34; The next shot cuts to Tina Fey&#39;s Ms. Norbury shaking her head at it, telling Principal Duvall not to worry about it when she notices his shock, which proves the musical is aware of how absurd the moment is.





 



 2024&#39;s Mean Girls Is Blending A Modern Perspective With The Original (&amp; It&#39;s Working) 
The new musical should find new iconic one-liners
         

Although Mean Girls is a timeless classic and some scenes worked well for the 2004 film, the 2024&#39;s remake is adapting to the current times. The new Mean Girls should avoid recreating the iconic scenes of the original so it could provide a fresh, modern perspective, and it looks like it&#39;s doing just that in its own meta way. There are many instances where the Mean Girls musical remake uses the old iconic quotes, but the new Coach Carr scene proves that the modern remake has found a way to mix the original with a modern perspective, and the trailer proves that the new approach works well.
