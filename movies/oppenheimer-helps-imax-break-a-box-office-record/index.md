## Literature Review

Oppenheimer helps IMAX break a box office record in 2023, assisting the company in one of its best yearly performances financially of all time.




Oppenheimer has helped IMAX break a box office record thanks to its stellar performance on their screens in 2023. The biopic directed by Christopher Nolan earned a total of $955.1 million worldwide during its theatrical run. Some of this money was earned from IMAX screens, which had been pushed as the definitive way to see the movie in promotions leading up to its release.




Now, Variety reports that Oppenheimer&#39;s remarkable box office success helped IMAX break a box office record. The company had its second-highest grossing year in history, earning $1.06 billion thanks to movies playing on their screens worldwide. The biopic is now the highest-performing movie to release on IMAX in 2023, earning $183.2 million from screenings.


 Why Oppenheimer&#39;s IMAX Performance Was So Massive 
         

Nolan particularly stated that he preferred watching the biopic he crafted in an IMAX theater, no doubt prompting viewers to attend screenings in the format where available. This was exacerbated by a temporary exclusivity deal, which saw Oppenheimer as the only movie to play on the company&#39;s screens throughout the US and Canada for a limited time. This is a result of the movie being shot using IMAX cameras, making such screenings a more authentic experience.




While the promotion of the format influenced its impressive financial success, the movie was also widely praised by critics and audiences alike. These include both the story of the movie and its performances, including Cillian Murphy&#39;s Golden Globe-winning acting. Oppenheimer also works well because of its smaller details, like the depiction of realistic villains that maintain truth to their history.

                  What Happened To Lewis Strauss After Oppenheimer   Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer features Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss. Here&#39;s what happened to him after the events of the movie.   

From where it was screened to the quality of the film, Oppenheimer pushing IMAX to their second-best year of all time indicates just how successful the movie was. While it didn&#39;t beat the likes of Barbie and The Super Mario Bros. Movie in terms of overall box office performance, it&#39;s still a record-setting entry in cinematic history. This success will likely continue to be reflected as awards season for 2023 continues.






Oppenheimer has already won Best Motion Picture - Drama at the Golden Globes.
