## Literature Review

Lift director F. Gary Gray gives a cautious update about a potential Lift 2 as Kevin Hart&#39;s latest action comedy becomes available on Netflix.




The director of Lift sees the possibility of a franchise in Netflix&#39;s latest hit. Starring Kevin Hart and a large ensemble cast, the movie is all about stealing gold before it can get into the hands of terrorists. Unfortunately, the gold happens to be on an international flight, meaning that the team needs to steal an entire plane just to get their hands on it. The movie was released on January 12 on Netflix.




Because of the way Lift&#39;s gold heist ended, director F. Gary Gray thinks that there is a way to continue the story. In an interview with Variety, he revealed that the response from audiences has been very positive, which could be a good sign for a potential sequel. While he can&#39;t make the decision himself, he does think that Netflix can even make an entire franchise out of it, rather than just a single follow-up. Check out his full quote below:


After the premiere, that’s exactly what we keep hearing from the people who watch the movie, like, “We want to see more of them.” I think that’s a Netflix choice. I think they have an opportunity for a sequel. They may have an opportunity for a franchise. I think that’s above my pay grade, but I do believe that based on the response, there’s an opportunity there, and I think Netflix and Kevin and the cast will have a lot to do with the choice if that happens or not.



 Will Lift Get A Sequel? 
          




There is a lot of potential for a Lift sequel. Because the movie ends with most characters surviving the attempted theft, there is always a chance for them to reunite to launch another major heist. There can always be new absurd ideas in even more renowned settings, so Lift is hardly limited by an altogether closed ending.

                  Why Netflix’s Lift Feels So Much Like A Fast &amp; Furious Movie   Netflix&#39;s Lift seems too similar to the Fast and the Furious movies, making it hard not to wonder if there is a hidden connection between the two.   

Because of the enormous ensemble cast, Netflix also does not need to convince every member of Lift&#39;s cast to return. If some choose not to return, they can easily be replaced by another character within the universe, and little would be changed. Kevin Hart would be the only actor that Netflix would desperately need to return, largely because he played such a significant role in the movie&#39;s marketing.



Lift&#39;s cast includes Kevin Hart, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Sam Worthington, Billy Magnussen, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio, Paul Anderson, Úrsula Corberó, and more.







There would be some challenges in pitching a sequel, of course. The movie had a massive budget of $100 million, and Netflix will likely need to earn twice that number to break even. While it can be difficult for the public to determine the profitability of a streaming movie, a sequel announcement would clarify that the original proved to be everything that Netflix hoped for and more in terms of returns. Considering that it is currently sitting at #1 on Netflix&#39;s movie list, it is certainly possible. Still, it remains to be seen if Lift will ever receive a sequel.
