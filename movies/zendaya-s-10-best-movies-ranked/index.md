## Literature Review

Zendaya is one of the biggest stars among young Hollywood actors, and her filmography has already proven she has the talent to back up her fame. 




Zendaya has many exciting upcoming movies, but the roles in the films she&#39;s already starred in showcase the success and longevity of her career. Though best known for her work in the Max original series Euphoria, as Rue, she has quickly made headway into the film world in various genres. So far, she has been part of several major franchises, like the MCU and the new adaptation of the Dune series. However, she has not been pigeonholed by either of these high-profile projects.
As a child actress, Zendaya started on the Disney Channel with shows like Shake It Up, and other Disney Channel Original movies. After that, she successfully transitioned into more adult roles and has long been viewed as an actress capable of taking on complex and difficult characters. Through her work with strong directors, and by choosing movies of many types and genres, she has paved the way for maintaining her fame and polishing her considerable skills.









 








 10  Frenemies (2012) 
As Halley Brandon
        

Teaming up with her Shake It Up costar Bella Thorne, Zendaya plays Halley, an up-and-coming young writer working with her best friend Avalon (Thorne) in the Disney movie Frenemies. The film features three different plots about pairs of friends getting into a fight, working it out, and reconciling in the end. Thorne and Zendaya maintain the chemistry they had in their show and play believable best friends. Though the movie doesn&#39;t require much from either of the young girls, it still teaches a positive message about friendship, and it&#39;s fun to see the beginnings of who Zendaya would become.

Before starring in hit series and blockbuster films like Euphoria and Spider-Man No Way Home, Zendaya worked on several Disney Channel projects.








 9  Zapped (2014) 
As Zoey Stevens


 







A few years after Frenemies, but still in her Disney Channel era, Zendaya starred in Zapped, another Disney Channel Original, but with a more mature twist. As her character, Zoey, struggles to cope with changes, she gets the power to control men around her by using an app on her phone. In the end, Zoey does the right thing and stops using it, but it&#39;s interesting to see Zendaya&#39;s roles start to grapple with moral questions, even if the stakes are quite low. As with other Disney roles, she has the opportunity to showcase her dancing, but this is a talent that she won&#39;t utilize much in her later work.





 8  Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021) 
As Lola Bunny
        

  Space Jam: A New Legacy  


  Director    Malcolm D. Lee     Cast    Eric Bauza , Don Cheadle , Jeff Bergman , Gabriel Iglesias , Sonequa Martin-Green , LeBron James , Cedric Joe , Bob Bergen     Rating    PG     Runtime    1h 55m     Genres    Animation , Adventure , Action     Writers    Tony Rettenmaier , Juel Taylor , Terence Nance , Keenan Coogler     Budget    $161.9 million     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Franchise(s)    Space Jam    


In the recent Space Jam sequel, Space Jam: A New Legacy, Zendaya lends her voice to the character Lola Bunny, for a fun reboot of the character. The film has an interesting take on the emergence of AI technology, and its influence on popular culture, and this is how LeBron James gets transported into the Tune World. This is where Lola comes in, but not much is asked of the character, and it would have been more fun to see Zendaya in one of the live-action roles. It&#39;s unlikely that the film will be well remembered, but it&#39;s still a fun project she was a part of.





 7  Smallfoot (2018) 
As Meechee
        

 Smallfoot 


  Release Date    September 28, 2018     Director    Karey Kirkpatrick , Jason Reisig     Cast    Channing Tatum , LeBron James , Yara Shahidi , James Corden , Danny DeVito , Gina Rodriguez , Ely Henry , Common , Zendaya , Jimmy Tatro     Rating    PG     Main Genre    Animation     Genres    Comedy , Animation , Adventure     Writers    Sergio Pablos , Karey Kirkpatrick    


For Zendaya&#39;s other foray into voice acting, she gets to spend a little more time on screen as Meechee, a yeti living in the Himalayan mountains. In a fun twist of the bigfoot legend, it&#39;s the human who is the unknown creature, and the village full of yetis, including Meechee, are shocked to discover him. The film is a sweet tale of acceptance and learning to communicate with someone different from oneself, and Zendaya&#39;s character is a great example of this message. Though her voice is quite recognizable, it doesn&#39;t take the viewer out of the fantastical world.





 6  Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) 
As MJ
        

  Spider-Man: No Way Home  


  Release Date    December 17, 2021     Director    Jon Watts     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    148 minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure ,  Sci-Fi , Superhero     Writers    Erik Sommers , Chris McKenna     Story By    Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers     Budget    $200 million     Studio(s)    Marvel     Distributor(s)    Sony     prequel(s)    Spider-Man: No Way Home , Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse ,  Avengers: Endgame , spider-man homecoming     Franchise(s)    Marvel Cinematic Universe    


The new live-action Spider-man films by Marvel made an excellent choice, casting Zendaya as MJ. Peter Parker&#39;s (Tom Holland) damsel in distress love interest finds new life through Zendaya&#39;s performance as a layered character with a rich inner life of her own. In the most recent film of the franchise, Spider-Man: No Way Home, the characters come face to face with the multiverse, which allows MJ to interact with other fabulous actors and bring to life meta dialogue and plot points. Though the film ends on a cliffhanger for the future of MJ and Peter&#39;s relationship, there&#39;s plenty in store for her character in the future.





 5  Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) 
As MJ
        

  Spider-Man: Homecoming  


  Release Date    July 7, 2017     Director    Jon Watts     Cast    Michael Keaton , Martin Starr , Angourie Rice , Robert Downey Jr. , Marisa Tomei , Bokeem Woodbine , Logan Marshall-Green , Garcelle Beauvais , Michael Mando , Zendaya , Tom Holland , Jon Favreau , Donald Glover , Hannibal Buress     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    133 minutes     Genres    Superhero , Action , Adventure , Sci-Fi , Comedy , Drama     Writers    Christopher Ford , John Francis Daley , Jon Watts , Erik Sommers , Jonathan Goldstein , Chris McKenna     Budget    $175 Million     Studio(s)    Marvel , Sony     Distributor(s)    Disney     Sequel(s)    Spider-Man: Far from Home , Spider-Man: No Way Home     Franchise(s)    Spider-Man    


The first of the new Spider-Man movies was Spider-Man: Homecoming, which served as an introduction to MJ, and the new cast of characters who would be portraying the beloved characters. Though MJ evolves a lot over the three films, it&#39;s in Homecoming that she has the opportunity to distinguish herself as a uniquely qualified actress for the role, and does excellent work finding the comedy in the narrative. Her MJ is a bit of an outcast, and a little bit strange, but this is what the audience, and Peter, come to love about her, and let her be a voice of reason amidst the fanatical elements of the film.





 4  Malcolm &amp; Marie (2021) 
As Marie


 







  Malcolm And Marie  


  Release Date    February 5, 2021     Director    Sam Levinson     Cast    John David Washington , Zendaya     Rating    R     Runtime    106 minutes     Genres    Romance , Drama     Writers    Sam Levinson     Budget    $2.5 million     Studio(s)    Netflix    


For Malcolm &amp; Marie, Zendaya paired up again with the director and creator of Euphoria, Sam Levinson. Though Malcolm &amp; Marie got mixed reviews, it still has a lot to offer in terms of the craft of the performers. The film is a marathon for herself and her costar, John David Washington, as they are the only two characters in the film, and it deals with emotionally wrought topics. Zendaya&#39;s character, Marie, is the girlfriend of Malcolm (Washington), a writer-director, and the film portrays an all-night argument after the premiere of his new film.
It&#39;s the work of the two actors that make the film, and the way they authentically play out the power dynamic between the characters. Though the premise and dialogue of the movie have been critiqued, it&#39;s still an excellent example of what Zendaya is capable of as a performer. It&#39;s clear that Zendaya&#39;s work with Levinson has broadened her dramatic range, and that she will go on to inhabit many intricate characters in the future.





 3  The Greatest Showman (2017) 
As Anne Wheeler
        

  The Greatest Showman  


  Release Date    December 20, 2017     Director    Michael Gracey     Cast    Zac Efron , Hugh Jackman , Zendaya , Natasha Liu Bordizzo , Rebecca Ferguson , Michelle Williams , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II     Rating    PG     Runtime    1h 45m     Genres    Musical     Writers    Jenny Bicks , Michael Arndt , Bill Condon     Budget    84 million     Studio(s)    20th Century     Distributor(s)    20th Century    


The movie musical The Greatest Showman features Zendaya as Anne, an acrobat in P.T. Barnum&#39;s circus (Hugh Jackman). Following a fictionalized account of Barnum opening his famous circus, the film is a grand spectacle that allows Zendaya to showcase the musical abilities she exhibited in her early years as a child actor. Her chemistry with costar Zac Efron is an enjoyable feature of the film, and their sensitive love story is a welcome addition to the bombastic nature of the film. It will be intriguing to see if Zendaya seeks out roles in movie musicals in the future after the success of The Greatest Showman.

 2  Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) 
As MJ
        

  Spider-Man: Far From Home  


  Release Date    July 2, 2019     Director    Jon Watts     Cast    Michael Keaton , Tom Holland , Jacob Batalon , Jon Favreau , Zendaya , Samuel L. Jackson , Martin Starr , Marisa Tomei , Cobie Smulders , Jake Gyllenhaal , Tony Revolori , Angourie Rice     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    129 minutes     Genres    Adventure , Comedy , Superhero , Action     Writers    Erik Sommers , Chris McKenna     Budget    $160 million     Studio(s)    Marvel , Sony     Distributor(s)    Sony     Sequel(s)    Spider-Man: No Way Home     prequel(s)     Spider-Man: Homecoming     Franchise(s)    Spider-Man    


Spider-Man: Far From Home is the Marvel film that Zendaya has the most to do as MJ, and features the most development in her relationship with Peter. When the students of Peter&#39;s and MJ&#39;s high school go on a trip to Europe, Peter wants to tell MJ how he feels, but he gets swept up in hero work, and she finds out his secret. The moment when MJ confronts Peter about his secret identity is one of the funniest in the film thanks to Zendaya&#39;s comedic timing, and seeing her get to be a part of the crime-fighting team is a satisfying end to the best film of the trio.





 1  Dune (2021) 
As Chani


 







  Dune  


  Release Date    October 22, 2021     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Dave Bautista , Rebecca Ferguson , Sharon Duncan-Brewster , Jason Momoa , David Dastmalchian , Stephen McKinley Henderson , Stellan Skarsgård , Charlotte Rampling , Chang Chen , Oscar Isaac , Zendaya , Javier Bardem , Timothee Chalamet , Josh Brolin     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    155 minutes     Genres    Action , Adventure , Science Fiction , Drama     Writers    Frank Herbert , Eric Roth , Denis Villeneuve , Jon Spaihts     Studio(s)    Legendary Pictures     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures     Franchise(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Though Zendaya&#39;s Chani doesn&#39;t get the most screen time in Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Dune, her presence hangs over the film and her mystery is an essential facet of the movie&#39;s atmosphere. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) has recurring dreams about her and the future of their relationship, so when she finally appears in his film it&#39;s a significant moment. In her role, Zendaya seamlessly blends into the grand scale of the film and is not lost in the large set pieces and deep lore that Dune deals with. She holds her own and then some in the narrative, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats for the coming sequel.
