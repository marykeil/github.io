## Literature Review

Anakin Skywalker&#39;s and Padme Amidala&#39;s trip aboard the Halcyon starcruiser in one Star Wars story shows how close they came to exposing their secret.




The Star Wars: Halcyon Legacy comic book miniseries revealed that Anakin Skywalker and Padmé Amidala took a luxury cruise trip together, which risked exposing the Star Wars franchise&#39;s best-kept secret romance. After Anakin became smitten with Padmé in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, the two reconnected in Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones, quickly moving from recognizing they could never be together to secretly getting married and agreeing to hide the marriage. This relationship risked Padmé&#39;s position in the Senate and Anakin&#39;s inclusion in the Jedi Order, but the two did not exactly work hard to conceal the truth; they made many bold choices that put them at risk of being found out.




Based on Disney&#39;s recently closed Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser, Halcyon Legacy explores the history of the ship on which the immersive experience was based. In the comic miniseries, multiple canonical characters from various Star Wars eras travel aboard the ship, including Padmé and Anakin, who take a trip in disguise to spy on a senator suspected of working with the Separatists. Although on the surface this sounds like a legitimate Republic mission during the Clone Wars, the two quickly begin to enjoy their travels as a couple, which is both humorous and a jarring reminder that the newlyweds were not always very careful.

                  Star Wars: 10 Things Most Fans Don&#39;t Know About Anakin And Padme&#39;s Relationship   The relationship between Anakin and Padme is the foundation of the Skywalker Saga, but what do most fans not know about the Star Wars couple?   


 Anakin &amp; Padmé Went On A Luxury Cruise Ship Together 
          




Despite the aforementioned façade of a Republic mission, Anakin&#39;s and Padmé&#39;s trip aboard the Halcyon quickly devolves into a luxury trip for two. After a brief discussion about their need to remain undercover, the two are depicted bounding off excitedly in the comic with Anakin telling Padmé, &#34;That means we have a little bit of time to enjoy the cruise.&#34; As if that wasn&#39;t glaringly obvious enough, when Padmé counters they need to be discreet, Anakin responds, &#34;What better disguise than a couple in love on a romantic getaway?&#34; Padmé and a shirtless Anakin then go on to spar in the lightsaber training pod, visit the climate simulator, and kiss on board the ship.



Anakin goes on to duel Asajj Ventress on the Halcyon, leaving behind marks that were later filled in with gold to preserve their history.






 Anakin &amp; Padmé Weren&#39;t Very Subtle With Their Romance 
          




By the time Anakin becomes Darth Vader in Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith, Obi-Wan is aware the two are together, and that Anakin is the father of Padmé&#39;s unborn child. Although he asks the question, he seems to already know the answer; even the fact that he thought to go to Padmé when he was looking for Anakin shows that Obi-Wan knew the truth about their relationship to some extent. This really isn&#39;t surprising given how obvious the two were about their feelings for one another beginning in Attack of the Clones, and it has since been revealed that not only Obi-Wan but also Ahsoka knew that Anakin and Padmé were together.

Throughout the prequel era, the two engage in behaviors that very clearly signal the nature of their relationship. On Geonosis, Padmé leans over and kisses Anakin while all in the stands are watching, and later on, after Anakin has lost his arm to Dooku, Padmé runs to Anakin and embraces him right in front of Obi-Wan and Master Yoda. In The Clone Wars series, Anakin also shows his hand and intense jealousy over Rush Clovis to the Jedi Council. Although Anakin and Padmé do somewhat successfully hide their relationship before their tragic demise, Halcyon Legacy reveals the humor behind this secret Star Wars romance.
