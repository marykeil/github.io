## Literature Review

Unlike every other movie in the Star Wars franchise, Jon Favreau’s The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie can do something we haven’t seen since A New Hope.




The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will be Star Wars’ triumphant return to the big screen, but it will also be much more. Following the success of The Mandalorian, Jon Favreau plans to translate Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu’s episodic adventures into one long story. Given how The Mandalorian season 3 was bogged down with unnecessary fillers and cameos, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu promises to focus on its titular characters. And despite being sandwiched between Return of the Jedi and Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Favreau’s movie has one important trick up its sleeve.




With The Mandalorian season 4 in limbo, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is expected to reinvigorate the series—and the entire franchise—by showing Din’s heroic struggle against a resurgent Empire. Of course, both Din Djarin and Grogu will need to be reintroduced to the theater for the few who never watched Disney&#43;’s The Mandalorian series, and this is what sets Favreau’s movie apart from almost every other Star Wars movie ever released. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu focuses on entirely new Star Wars characters.

The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has the unique opportunity to tell a story that isn’t fettered to any other Star Wars characters. Furthermore, given how far away it is from The Force Awakens, it doesn’t even need to tie into the rise of the First Order. Instead, Din Djarin and Grogu freelancing for a fledgling New Republic can be its own self-contained story in the franchise. And while it would be nice to catch up with some of the franchise’s classic characters from the original trilogy, the movie is free to brush past them.



 Star Wars Hasn&#39;t Had A Movie Like This Since Its 1977 Debut 
          

A New Hope, released in 1977, is the only Star Wars movie that didn’t lean on another character or idea in the franchise, mainly because it was the first Star Wars story. But ever since then, every Star Wars movie has been a prequel, sequel, or spin off of the Skywalker Saga. For example, Solo: A Star Wars Story focused entirely on Han Solo. And while Gareth Edwards’ Rogue One: A Star Wars Story featured an almost entirely new cast of characters, it ultimately led up to A New Hope.




On the other hand, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu has the opportunity to free itself from the shackles of the Skywalker Saga and tell a completely unique story without needing to reference other characters and movies in the franchise. Favreau is building the New Republic Era of Star Wars to help the franchise break away from the characters it has continually relied on. With The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, Star Wars is finally free to reinvent itself in a fresh and exciting new way.
