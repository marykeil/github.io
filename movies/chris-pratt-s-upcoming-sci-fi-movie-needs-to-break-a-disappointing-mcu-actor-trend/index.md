## Literature Review
Chris Pratt has several movies coming out in 2024, but his sci-fi title has an opportunity to break a surprising trend linked to MCU actors.




Chris Pratt&#39;s role in The Garfield Movie might be getting attention, but it&#39;s his upcoming 2024 sci-fi movie that could end up breaking a concerning trend plaguing MCU actors. 2023 marked Pratt&#39;s most recent Marvel Cinematic Universe appearance with the release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. To date, the actor has appeared in six MCU movies and The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special as Star-Lord. While Pratt continues to be one of the most recognizable stars in the MCU, he has had immense success outside of the Disney franchise.




Aside from the MCU, Pratt has led the Jurassic World trilogy alongside Bryce Dallas Howard since 2015. The reboot series may have acquired some criticisms, but there was no doubt that Pratt was a capable lead for a major franchise, which is why he garnered prominent roles in other action films like The Magnificent Seven, The Tomorrow War, and the TV show The Terminal List. Interestingly, some of his biggest successes stem from voice acting roles, specifically as Mario in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The Garfield Movie will look to match the Mario Bros. movie&#39;s box office success, but Pratt&#39;s other 2024 movie might not be as lucky based on history.

 The Russo Bros. Have A Poor Track Record With MCU Actors (Outside The MCU) 
          




Chris Pratt&#39;s 2024 sci-fi movie is The Electric State, which Anthony and Joe Russo are directing. The filmmaking pair of brothers is undoubtedly no stranger to Pratt after having directed Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. In fact, the Russo brothers have a history of working with fellow MCU actors on projects outside of Disney. That said, the track record for the Russo brother&#39;s projects has not been good outside of the MCU. Not including The Electric State, the Russos worked on five movies that heavily featured MCU actors, but all have been forgettable.

Following Endgame, the Russo brothers served as producers on 2019&#39;s 21 Bridges. Though the performance of the late Chadwick Boseman was praised, the movie itself was a disappointment. The following year saw the debut of Extraction starring Chris Hemsworth, with Joe Russo serving as the screenwriter while his brother co-produced. The movie&#39;s action sequences were noteworthy, but reviews were relatively mixed. Joe also wrote the sequel, but it didn&#39;t fare much better. The same goes for Cherry, starring Tom Holland, and The Gray Man, featuring Chris Evans in the lead. Both were directed by the Russos, but both were heavily criticized.






 Can Chris Pratt&#39;s The Electric State Fix The Russos&#39; Track Record? 
          

Hopefully, Chris Pratt&#39;s The Electric State can finally put the Russo brothers back on track with a quality film starring an MCU actor. The movie set for Netflix is based on Simon StÃ¥lenhag&#39;s graphic novels that center on a teenager in a dystopian alternate version of the &#39;90s and her companion robot setting out to find her missing brother. The girl will be played by Stranger Things&#39; Millie Bobby Brown, while Pratt is said to be playing Keats, a smuggler Brown&#39;s character meets during her journey. The fact that the Russos&#39; next movie is based on established IP is a reason to be optimistic, but the cast is also a positive sign.

Besides Pratt and Brown, The Electric State will feature a live-action cast consisting of Ke Huy Quan, Stanley Tucci, and Jason Alexander alongside a voice cast that includes names like Brian Cox, Jenny Slate, Giancarlo Esposito, Anthony Mackie, and Billy Bob Thornton. Mackie and Tucci, of course, have a history with the MCU, with the former, in particular, working with the Russo brothers on three MCU movies. He could ultimately assist Chris Pratt in breaking the filmmakers&#39; poor track record outside of the MCU, proving that the cinematic universe isn&#39;t vital for their career success.
