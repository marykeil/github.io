## Literature Review
While the Maze Runner movies took inspiration from the source material, the franchise changed storylines and character arcs from the books.




The Maze Runner movies adapt their story from the eponymous books by James Dashner, but they also change multiple characters and storylines. In 2014, The Maze Runner was released when teen dystopian film adaptations were at the height of their popularity. The movie series centers on a society destroyed by the Flare Virus, which causes scientists to commit heinous experiments on children in the hopes of finding a cure.
The movies pull many of their storylines from the Maze Runner books; however, they also take creative liberties. Some of these changes are small and unimportant to the plot, like the organization name WCKD (called WICKED in the books). However, other changes from the books to the movies have a significant impact on the overall narrative and character arcs.









 








 10  The Maze Runner Movies Cut Thomas And Teresa&#39;s Telepathic Powers 


Close







In the Maze Runner books, Thomas and Teresa can talk to each other via telepathy. This allows them to communicate at any time, no matter where they&#39;re located. Often, Thomas and Teresa&#39;s inner dialogue provides context for the events occurring throughout the series. When adapting the books into films, the director decided to cut out the pair&#39;s telepathic powers due to the difficulty of including telepathy in a movie format (via MTV). Ultimately, by severing the psychic connection, the movies could focus on developing the characters individually. It also made Teresa&#39;s death more significant because the two characters built a stronger external connection.





 9  The Griever Attacks Look Different 
        

The Grievers play an important role in the first Maze Runner movie and book. However, their attacks look vastly different between the two mediums. In the books, the Grievers take characters from the Glade one by one. Their stings also don&#39;t pose a threat to the Gladers because they have ample access to the Grief Serum. This contrasts with the movies, where the Grievers massacre numerous Gladers all at once. The Grievers kill with their teeth, as well as their stings, and the children have no access to the serum until Teresa arrives with two vials. These changes provided more tension and urgency in the movie.





 8  Maze Runner: Death Cure Removes WCKD’s Secret Motives 
        

Maze Runner: Death Cure&#39;s ending diverges greatly from The Death Cure book in many ways, but one of the most significant is the missing epilogue. In the book&#39;s epilogue, Chancellor Ava Paige writes a memorandum about WCKD&#39;s secret motivation. After realizing that they couldn&#39;t find the cure, WICKED shifted their focus to saving the Immunes, allowing them to rebuild society. This explains the phrase &#34;WCKD Is Good,&#34; which appeared in the Maze Runner movies. Unfortunately, the movie removed this context entirely. While the change created a better enemy for the Gladers and the Right Arm, it also left an unanswered question about the phrase&#39;s meaning.





 7  Only The First Phase Of WCKD’s Experiment Appears 
        

The first Maze Runner movie centers on the first phase of WCKD&#39;s experiment. By the time the second movie comes around, though, the characters are no longer in the experiment. Instead, the Gladers go off with the Right Arm, the resistance group fighting against WCKD. In the books, the Right Arm doesn&#39;t appear until halfway through The Death Cure. The second phase of the experiment requires them to make it across the scorch, a task they do because they believe WICKED gave them all the Flare Virus. In the third phase, each subject faces a unique test catered to them.





 6  Newt’s Tragic Backstory Is Absent 


Close







One major change from the Maze Runner books to the movies is Newt&#39;s backstory. The movie series establishes that everyone in the Maze Trial is immune to the Flare Virus. In Maze Runner: Death Cure, Newt gets infected. The only explanation given for this change is that WCKD needed a control subject for the experiment. Unfortunately, this creates more questions in the Maze Runner movies than it answers. The books provide a tragic backstory that better explains Newt&#39;s presence. WICKED wants to take his sister, Lizzy, and murders their parents when they refuse. They put Newt in the experiment as a control subject, knowing he&#39;ll eventually become a crank.





 5  The Movies Don’t Explore WCKD’s Mind Control Abilities 
        

The Maze Runner movies only briefly allude to the fact that WCKD can control the minds of the experiment subjects. This is seen in Maze Runner: Death Cure, when Minho starts hallucinating about the Maze Trial, something WCKD seemingly triggers to withdraw the cure from his blood. However, WICKED controls subjects much more frequently in the books. For example, in The Maze Runner, Gally throws a knife at Thomas due to WICKED&#39;s mind control — an act that ultimately kills Chuck, who dives in front of his friend. This is only one instance where the Gladers act through mind compulsion.





 4  The Origin And Stages Of The Flare Virus Aren’t Explained 
        

The Maze Runner movie franchise only briefly touches on the origins of the Flare Virus. The films state that the Post-Flare Coalition created the virus to control the population after The Flare. The movies never explain why they decided to create the virus. On top of this, the movies barely touch on the stages of the Flare Virus, simply showing Cranks in their final stage. The book series explores all of these things in detail, providing more lore and world-building.





 3  Maze Runner: Scorch Trials Cuts The Book’s Most Terrifying Scene 
        

One of the most terrifying scenes in The Scorch Trials never appears in the movie adaptation. In the book, the Gladers walk down a dark tunnel, where they encounter metal balls on the ceiling. These balls, created by WICKED, fall onto the Gladers. When they latch onto a person, the metal covers their entire head, ultimately decapitating them. The metal balls can defy gravity by flying sideways too. When the Gladers realize what the metal balls do, they start screaming and run as fast as they can to escape with their lives. It&#39;s unfortunate that the movie left this scene out because it would&#39;ve made a great action sequence.





 2  WCKD’s Search For The Cure Looks Different In The Books 
        

In the Maze Runner movie franchise, WCKD conducts the experiment to induce the production of cure enzymes in the Immunes&#39; brains. By The Maze Runner: Death Cure, the organization finds a way to extract the cure from the Immunes&#39; blood. This is vastly different from the book series. Throughout the books, WICKED does brain scans on the Immunes, trying to understand why they can&#39;t get the Flare Virus. In The Death Cure, WICKED reveals that there is no existing cure for the virus, meaning the Cranks will all die out. In the epilogue, Ava Paige reveals that the organization discovered this earlier and shifted their focus to saving the Immunes.





 1  Thomas Never Returns to The Maze In The Movies 
        

In The Death Cure, Thomas must return to the Maze Trial to save the other Immunes who get stuck with the Grievers. This takes up a good chunk of the book. Once he finally gets to the Immunes, they use the teleporter — called the Flat Transportation — to reach the Safe Haven. None of this occurs in The Maze Runner: Death Cure because the plot had diverted so drastically by that point that it wouldn&#39;t have made any sense. All the Gladers escaped the Maze Trial, and Thomas was entirely focused on taking down WCKD.
