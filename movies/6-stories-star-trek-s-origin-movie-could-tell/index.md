# 6 Stories Star Trek s Origin Movie Could Tell


## SUMMARY 


 A new Star Trek origin movie set &#34;decades before&#34; the Chris Pine movies could potentially explore the Earth-Romulan War, providing new information to fans of the franchise. 
 Another possibility for the new movie is to focus on the USS Kelvin and the life of George Kirk, shedding light on Kirk&#39;s family history and ending where Star Trek (2009) began. 
 A Captain Pike origin story could feature an early version of the character from the Kelvin timeline, exploring his conflicting views on the response to the USS Kelvin&#39;s destruction.

## Literature Review

With a new Star Trek movie set decades before Chris Pine&#39;s Kirk on the way, it can tell various stories from both sides of the Kelvin Timeline divide.




A new Star Trek origin movie has been announced by Paramount, set &#34;decades before&#34; the Chris Pine movies, but what story could it tell? It&#39;s unclear at this stage if the new Star Trek origin movie is set before or after the divergence in the timeline caused by the destruction of the USS Kelvin. While a Star Trek movie set in the early days of the Kelvin timeline would still fulfill the promise of a movie set decades before the events of J.J. Abrams&#39; movies, the time frame also allows for an origin story set in the Prime universe.
It&#39;s too early to tell what story Seth Grahame-Smith will be telling with his script for the new Star Trek origin movie. Whether Grahame-Smith and Paramount Studios opt for a story rooted in established canon or tell an original story with brand-new Star Trek characters remains to be seen. However, there are some established moments in Star Trek canon on both sides of the Kelvin timeline divergence that could provide strong material for a newmovie.

 6  An Earth-Romulan War Movie 
Set eight decades before Star Trek (2009)
        

A Star Trek movie about the war between humans and Romulans was first pitched by Band of Brothers writer Erik Jendresen in 2006. Entitled Star Trek: The Beginning, it centered on Star Trek&#39;s Earth-Romulan War and was set in the six-year period between the events of Star Trek: Enterprise, season 4, episode 21, &#34;Terra Prime&#34; and the series finale &#34;These Are the Voyages...&#34; The lead character in the movie was Tiberius Chase, an ancestor of James Tiberius Kirk (William Shatner), whose ambitions to join Starfleet were hindered by his family background. Seth Grahame-Smith will be writing a brand-new script, but there&#39;s a great deal of promise in finally telling the story of the Earth-Romulan War in Star Trek.
Taking place eight decades before J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movies, the Earth-Romulan War would be a suitably cinematic conceit for a wider theater audience. The chance for Star Trek fans to finally learn more about a conflict first referenced in Star Trek: The Original Series would sweeten the deal. Jendresen&#39;s pitch was eventually rejected in favor of J.J. Abrams&#39; Kelvin Timeline reboot, which fulfilled the studio&#39;s desire for a new Star Trek movie to have recognizable characters. It will be interesting to see if Paramount&#39;s outlook has changed when the new origin movie enters production.





 5  A USS Kelvin Movie 
Set immediately before J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek


 







Paramount Studios had previously tried to get Chris Hemsworth to reprise the role of Lieutenant George Kirk in one of the many abandoned Star Trek 4 projects. The proposed Star Trek time travel movie would have paired Hemsworth with Chris Pine as father and son. Disagreements over contracts were said to be the reason behind the movie being abandoned. However, a Star Trek movie with Chris Hemsworth as the lead could be a more enticing prospect for the actor. That&#39;s if the Thor actor wants to take on another franchise.
A movie about the USS Kelvin and the life of George Kirk could give Paramount a recognizable character and starship with which to sell their Star Trek origin movie. For fans, a movie about the life of George before he sacrificed his life to save 800 people from Nero (Eric Bana) could reveal new information about Kirk&#39;s family history. For added emotional impact, a USS Kelvin movie could depict the final mission before they encounter Nero and the Narada, ending where Star Trek (2009) began.

 4  A Captain Pike Origin Story 
Set before and after the Kelvin Timeline divergence.
        

Seth Grahame-Smith will likely want to steer clear of legacy characters currently featured in Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. However, the existence of Bruce Greenwood&#39;s Kelvin Timeline Pike could allow for some creative freedom. Pike is estimated to have enrolled at Starfleet Academy in the early 2220s, which is 13 years before the Kelvin Timeline divergence. As a Star Trek character that audiences already know of via the Abrams movies and Strange New Worlds, Pike could be the perfect guide to the timeline changes that occur after the destruction of the USS Kelvin.
A Captain Pike movie could begin with a young and idealistic Starfleet Academy cadet who witnesses Starfleet embrace a more military and defensive approach in the wake of the USS Kelvin&#39;s destruction. J.J. Abrams&#39; Captain Pike was originally a recruitment officer for Starfleet Academy, which would be a perfect way to explore his conflicting views on the response to the Kelvin. It would certainly fit the brief of a Star Trek origin movie, showing how Pike became the man who would eventually mentor the young and brash Jim Kirk.





 3  The Adventures of George Samuel Kirk 
Set in the Prime Star Trek timeline


 







If Paramount were unable to get Chris Hemsworth back for their new Star Trek origin movie, then there is a workaround. A young George Samuel Kirk Sr. could be an ideal character to shed light on the early days of Starfleet. George Kirk was 30 when he died on the USS Kelvin, meaning that he would be a student of Starfleet Academy just over a decade before J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movie. This would date a young George Kirk Star Trek movie to some time between 2215 and 2223, a period of Starfleet history of which not much is known.
In 2223, the Federation and the Klingon Empire begin a Cold War, which could provide Paramount with some recognizable villains on which to hang the Star Trek origin movie. It&#39;s implied in Star Trek: The Original Series that Kirk&#39;s brother Sam was born in that year, too. This would lend a George Kirk movie some emotional family drama, as the young Starfleet officer would be forced to choose between his young family and protecting the Federation from the aggression of the Klingon Empire.





 2  A Captain Edison Movie 
Set before the USS Franklin went missing.


 







Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Thor co-star Idris Elba played Captain Balthazar M. Edison a.k.a. Krall in Justin Lin&#39;s Star Trek Beyond. Edison was the commanding officer aboard the USS Franklin, which went missing in action in 2164, three years after the United Federation of Planets was founded. Edison was resentful of a more peaceful and diplomatic future which rendered him obsolete. Idris Elba&#39;s Captain Edison could be a fascinating protagonist for a very different, more morally ambiguous Star Trek movie.
Since he broke out with his performance as Stringer Bell in The Wire, Idris Elba has excelled in roles that tread the fine line between good and evil. Idris Elba is also a huge box office draw, which would go some way to assuaging Paramount&#39;s concerns about appealing to a wider audience. As Star Trek Beyond was the lowest-performing of the J.J. Abrams movies, theatergoers may not be aware of how Edison&#39;s story ends, allowing the movie to pull off some big twists as the Starfleet officer embraces the darkness on Altamid.

 1  A Proper Star Trek: Enterprise Finale 
Set between the Enterprise finale and J.J. Abrams&#39; Star Trek movies.


 







A Star Trek: Enterprise comeback is at the extreme end of possibilities for the new Star Trek origin movie. A theatrical sequel to a TV show that was canceled in 2005 doesn&#39;t scream box office gold. However, it&#39;s hard to deny that Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) and the crew of the Enterprise NX-01 don&#39;t have unfinished business. There was a six-year gap between the final two episodes of Enterprise season 4, which does allow plenty of opportunities for more adventures for the NX-01. However, it&#39;s been almost 19 years since Enterprise ended, which would be a difficult hurdle to overcome to believably return to that era.
However, production artwork for Star Trek: Enterprise season 4, episode 19, &#34;In a Mirror, Darkly, Part II&#34; revealed that Jonathan Archer became Federation President in 2145. Scott Bakula could therefore be the perfect casting for a movie that tells the origin story of Starfleet and the Federation. Even if it was a supporting role, Archer playing an integral role in the new Star Trek origin movie could finally give Enterprise the send-off that it deserves.
All three J.J. Abrams Star Trek movies are available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
