## Literature Review



The Harry Potter movies don&#39;t get everything right about the books they&#39;re based on, and they even mess up some of the best characters from the source material — though Max&#39;s upcoming TV show can finally do right by these wronged characters. Like any movie adaptation, the Harry Potter films have to squeeze a lot of material into a short runtime. It&#39;s natural that some aspects of the books are absent. However, the Harry Potter movies&#39; book changes make some characters far less important to the narrative while completely altering the personalities of others.
Diehard fans were always going to be disappointed by such developments, and the movies&#39; approach to certain characters make up some of the biggest complaints about them today. Fortunately, the Harry Potter TV remake has the opportunity to capture book details that the movies leave out. The series can introduce characters the films don&#39;t have time to. It can also offer justice for the characters the movies do include but portray very differently than their book counterparts.

 10  Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) 
The Harry Potter Movies Don&#39;t Do Him Justice


Close







The Harry Potter movies keep many of Ron Weasley&#39;s worst moments from the books while cutting some of his best. In fact, the films outright give several of his best lines to Hermione, robbing Ron of the chance to prove his worth within the Golden Trio. Although Rupert Grint is a great casting choice for Ron&#39;s character, the actor can&#39;t overcome the writing decisions that make Ron seem like nothing more than a passive-aggressive sidekick. The movies fail to capture his intense loyalty or humor, two things that make Ron a fan-favorite character. The Harry Potter remake can finally amend this, allowing Ron to show off his strengths.





 9  Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) 
Book Ginny Is Way Spunkier Than Movie Ginny
        

Ron isn&#39;t the only Weasley the Harry Potter movies destroy through poor writing choices. Ginny Weasley meets a similar fate, with her on-screen iteration proving far less spunky than her book counterpart. It&#39;s a shame because Ginny really grows as a character over the course of the books, becoming an independent and fierce member of Harry&#39;s friend group. Her development cements why Harry becomes interested in her during Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. It also allows her to be more than just a love interest, something Bonnie Wright&#39;s iteration of the character doesn&#39;t get the chance to do.





 8  James Potter (Adrian Rawlins/Alfie McIlwain) 
Prongs&#39; Best Moments Are Barely Shown


Close







The lives and deaths of Harry&#39;s parents have a major impact on his story in the Harry Potter books and movies, but the latter don&#39;t show as much of James Potter as the source material. Although they give a glimpse into James&#39; past as a bully, they don&#39;t feature some of James&#39; best moments. Unlike the books, the movies don&#39;t depict how James fights off Voldemort to buy Lily and Harry time. They also don&#39;t send a clear enough message about how he changes in adulthood, leaving viewers with a more negative perception of Harry&#39;s father than the books do.





 7  Percy Weasley (Chris Rankin) 
The Movies Cut Percy&#39;s Character Arc
        

Ron&#39;s pompous older brother, Percy, is only at Hogwarts with the Golden Trio for a few years. The Harry Potter movies write off his character after he graduates, even though the books give him a compelling character arc. In the source material, Percy has a falling out with his parents after they begin to question the Ministry of Magic. Percy&#39;s ambition negatively impacts his relationship with his family, making it that much more satisfying when he finally admits they&#39;re right. Percy&#39;s growth in the books makes him an infinitely better character, but the Harry Potter movies don&#39;t bother with his development.





 6  Peeves The Poltergeist 
Peeves Doesn&#39;t Appear In The Movies At All
        

While most Harry Potter characters the movies mess up simply aren&#39;t fleshed out as well, Peeves the Poltergeist is absent from the films completely. Peeves provides comic relief at Hogwarts, wreaking havoc on the students and teachers every chance he gets. He appears frequently over the course of the seven Harry Potter books, and he&#39;s a big part of Hogwarts&#39; nighttime landscape. Harry and his friends run into Peeves on more than one late-night adventure in the castle, and he even gets Harry out of a tight spot or two. Hopefully, the Harry Potter TV show will have time to include this entertaining character, as he&#39;s too fun to ignore.





 5  Charlie Weasley (Alex Crockford) 
He Only Shows Up In A Photo
        

Charlie Weasley isn&#39;t cut from the Harry Potter movies like Peeves, but he might as well be. The films only show Charlie once, and it&#39;s in the picture of the Weasleys vacationing in Egypt. While the books give Charlie a role in transporting Norbert in Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, the movies don&#39;t make this connection. They also don&#39;t feature any of Charlie&#39;s later appearances or involve him the war against Voldemort. It&#39;s likely they don&#39;t have time to elaborate on another Weasley sibling — they barely flesh out Percy and Bill — but Charlie&#39;s absence is noticeable to anyone familiar with the source material. A faithful adaptation must include him.





 4  Dobby The House Elf (Toby Jones) 
Major Dobby Moments Are Cut


Close







The Harry Potter movies don&#39;t do a terrible job with Dobby, and the impact of his death in Deathly Hallows - Part 1 is a testament to this. However, the films leave out major storylines that highlight how Dobby&#39;s personality changes over the series. The films remove most of the House Elf scenes from the books, doing away with Barty Crouch&#39;s Winky and ignoring the Elves working in Hogwarts&#39; kitchen. This means Dobby doesn&#39;t get a job from Dumbledore, and he isn&#39;t shown becoming a rebellious House Elf who wants the others to embrace freedom. His absence from Hogwarts also means that some of Dobby&#39;s best scenes are cut.





 3  Dudley Dursley (Harry Melling) 
Dudley Loses His Shot At Redemption
        

Neither the Harry Potter books nor the movies do a great job with Dudley Dursley, but the former give Harry&#39;s cousin a shot at redemption. Following Order of the Phoenix&#39;s Dementor attack, Dudley comes to feel sorry about his treatment of Harry, trying to atone in odd ways, like leaving tea outside his bedroom door. Before Harry parts with the Dursleys, Dudley demands to know why Harry isn&#39;t going with them. His concern for his cousin is touching, but Dudley&#39;s redemption doesn&#39;t make the Harry Potter movies&#39; final cut. The TV show should make an effort to capture Dudley&#39;s growth, as it&#39;s an important piece of the final book.





 2  Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) 
Sirius And Harry&#39;s Bond Isn&#39;t As Strong
        

Gary Oldman&#39;s iteration of Sirius Black finds itself in the same predicament as Dobby. Although Oldman&#39;s portrayal of Harry&#39;s godfather is iconic, the Harry Potter movies cut many of his best scenes from the books. While this is likely due to time constraints, it makes Sirius feel less well-rounded — and it takes away from the impact of his death. Sirius is far more present in Harry&#39;s life in the books, visiting him in Goblet of Fire and spending more time with him in Order of the Phoenix. This makes it that much more tragic when he&#39;s torn away from Harry. The TV remake must highlight their bond.





 1  Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) 
Harry Potter&#39;s Villain Is Too Over The Top
        

Ralph Fiennes is iconic as Voldemort in the Harry Potter movies, but his over-the-top performance sometimes makes it difficult to take him as seriously as the villain demands. The later Harry Potter movies especially turn Voldemort into a spectacle, and the scene where he hugs Drago Malfoy is proof of this. Deathly Hallows - Part 2 also changes Voldemort&#39;s death, removing the weight of him dying as a mortal. If the Harry Potter TV remake wants to do its villain justice, it should learn from the films&#39; mistakes.
The Harry Potter movies are currently streaming on Max.
