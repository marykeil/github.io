 Mean Girls 2024&#39;s 9 Easter Eggs &amp; References To The 2004 Movie 
It&#39;s been 20 years since the original Mean Girls film was released and the new movie musical is paying tribute to it with references and Easter eggs.












 








 13  “I See Stars” 
Performed by Angourie Rice
        

The Mean Girls 2024 ending is almost identical to the one in the 2004 film, where Cady wins Spring Fling Queen, breaks the tiara, and gives pieces to her fellow nominees and students. In Mean Girls 2024, Cady sings a song, &#34;I See Stars,&#34; during the scene which has a double meaning in the title. Earlier in the film, she told Aaron that she missed being able to see the stars at night in Kenya. When she sings “I See Stars,” she is calling everyone at the dance stars while accepting her new home and a different kind of star.
It’s a sweet moment, but “I See Stars” is a bit anti-climatic as the finale song, especially considering the numbers that came before it. In general, Cady’s songs, one of which was written just for Mean Girls 2024, weren’t as impressive when compared to others on the soundtrack. However, “I See Stars” being at the bottom of the list says more about the strength of the songs in Mean Girls than its weaknesses.





 12  &#34;A Cautionary Tale&#34; 
Performed by Auli’i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey
        

The opening song of Mean Girls is meant to set the scene, and “A Cautionary Tale” does this well. Rather than having Cady narrate the story as she had in the 2004 movie, Mean Girls 2024 uses Janis and Damian. It’s a comedic song that establishes them as somewhat unreliable narrators–Janis sings about Regina dying, which Damian corrects. It’s one of the shorter songs on the Mean Girls soundtrack at just 1:08, and though it ends a bit abruptly, &#34;A Cautionary Tale&#34; serves its purpose.





 11  &#34;Stupid With Love&#34; 
Performed by Angourie Rice
        

The main romantic storyline in Mean Girls is between Cady and Aaron. Though Cady’s crush on Regina’s ex-boyfriend is “totally against the rules of feminism,” it doesn’t stop her from developing feelings for her AP Calculus classmate. In “Stupid With Love,” Cady sings about how she’s been “smart with math, but stupid with love,&#34; foreshadowing her plan to play stupid to get Aaron to notice her.
The Mean Girls song was significantly slowed down from the Broadway production for the movie musical, making it more of a ballad. Rather than singing lines like “I am filled with calcu-lust” with comedic excitement, Angourie Rice’s voice conveys longing. It’s a cute, catchy number, but it suffers from its pacing and not giving Rice much to do vocally.





 10  &#34;What’s Wrong With Me?&#34; 
Performed by Bebe Wood
        

As Regina’s henchwomen, Gretchen and Karen each get a solo of their own, though they’re vastly different. “What’s Wrong With Me?” adds a depth to Gretchen that may have been missing behind the comedy in Mean Girls 2004. It’s the most stripped-down song in Mean Girls, with just Gretchen’s voice and the soft sounds of a music box as the backing instrumental.
Alone in the closet with Cady, Gretchen shares some of her insecurities and reveals why she stays friends with Regina, despite how mean the queen bee can be to her. She asks the titular question “What’s Wrong With Me?” both to herself as she looks in the mirror, and to Regina, constantly seeking her approval to feel worthy. The number is heartbreakingly performed in Mean Girls by Bebe Wood, who sings it like a broken lullaby.





 9  &#34;Meet The Plastics&#34; 
Performed by Reneé Rapp


 







“Meet The Plastics” was the first of three songs in Mean Girls sung by Reneé Rapp as Regina George. As the title suggests, it introduced the viewers, as well as Cady, to The Plastics. The title is also somewhat misleading, as the Mean Girls movie musical cut Gretchen and Karen’s Broadway verses from the song, leaving just Regina’s. At just under a minute and a half, it’s one of the shortest songs in the musical, and while it does a great job of establishing Regina as a character, cutting Gretchen and Karen’s verses could be seen as a mistake.





 8  &#34;What Ifs&#34; 
Performed by Angourie Rice
        

“What Ifs,” which was co-written by the Mean Girls Broadway lyricists and Rapp, is one of two new songs that was added specifically for the movie musical. As Cady’s first solo, it replaced Broadway’s “It Roars,” and had a similar effect as the “Stupid With Love” changes did. Introducing Cady through a ballad makes her appear like a daydreamer who longs for a different life than the one she’s currently living. In the stage version, Cady is full of excitement and naivety. These characteristics are largely missing from Mean Girls 2024, offering a different take on the source material.
            
 
 Wait, What Happened To Cady&#39;s Dad In Mean Girls 2024? 
Cady Heron&#39;s dad, Chip, is missing from Mean Girls 2024, raising questions about what happened to Mr. Heron. Here&#39;s what the movie reveals about him.








 7  “Apex Predator” 
Performed by Auli’i Cravalho &amp; Jaquel Spivey
        

Since Cady was homeschooled and is more familiar with African jungles than high school hallways, Janis and Damian used “Apex Predator” to warn her about Regina and the social hierarchy. In Mean Girls, Regina George is at the top of the food chain, she’s “the queen of beasts,” the “Apex Predator.” The metaphorical lyrics interestingly connect Cady&#39;s two worlds while avoiding some of the more problematic jokes about Africa from the original Mean Girls.

Mean Girls is a beloved teen comedy full of memorable scenes, yet despite it being a cult classic, rewatching the 2004 film today can be cringeworthy.



The musical number has some of the most creative choreography in the film, with the dancers behaving like animals in the fantasy sequence. “Apex Predator” takes the scene from the original Mean Girls where Cady imagined the teenagers at the mall turning into jungle animals to another level. Cravalho and Spivey’s voices work well together, making for another fun duet between the two of them.





 6  “Not My Fault” 
Performed by Megan Thee Stallion &amp; Reneé Rapp


 







“Not My Fault” plays at the end credits of Mean Girls 2024, ending the movie musical on a high note. The catchy collaboration between rapper Megan Thee Stallion and Rapp plays over scenes of the characters having fun and dancing together at the end of the Spring Fling, making viewers want to join in as well. The song opens with a sample from the original Mean Girls movie of Lindsay Lohan as Cady saying, “it’s not my fault you’re like in love with me or something” to Janis.
This iconic Mean Girls line is repeated throughout the song as Rapp sings it in the chorus. “Not My Fault” is a good pump-up song that is meant to build confidence in listeners and will have audiences leaving the theater in a good mood. The true message of Mean Girls is about the power of female solidarity and building each other up rather than tearing each other down, making “Not My Fault” a fitting finale.





 5  “I’d Rather Be Me” 
Performed by Auli&#39;i Cravalho
        

While Janis was one of the meanest characters in Mean Girls 2004, she is more sympathetic in the movie musical. When she confesses how she and Cady ruined Regina’s life at the school assembly, she breaks into “I’d Rather Be Me” to share her philosophy. In the lyrics, Janis points out the double standards in “how girls should behave” and shares her mission to just be herself and rise above the competition required to fit in as a teenage girl. 
The repetitive lyrics of “I’d Rather Be Me” make it easy to sing along to as a powerful anthem. In the Mean Girls scene, Janis runs around the school, gaining supporters as she shares her message. It’s Cravalho’s shining moment in the film, allowing her to show off her vocals and for Janis’s story to end on a better note than it did in Mean Girls 2024.





 4  “Sexy” 
Performed by Avantika
        

Karen’s big solo is by far the funniest song in the Mean Girls soundtrack, capturing her character and her views on Halloween perfectly. As Karen sings, on Halloween, “I can be who I want to be and sexy,” listing off the various sexy costumes worn by the party attendees, including a sexy shark and sexy Eleanor Roosevelt. The humorous lyrics, Avantika’s delivery, and the mid-song dance break make “Sexy” one of the most memorable songs and performances in Mean Girls.





 3  “Someone Gets Hurt” 
Performed by Reneé Rapp
        

Perhaps the most visually stunning performance in Mean Girls is “Someone Gets Hurt,” with Rapp’s impressive vocals perfectly matching the scene. In “Someone Gets Hurt,” Regina manipulates Aaron at the costume party into getting back together with her. The sound is fitting for Halloween, creating an ominous, spooky vibe behind Rapp’s seductive singing. As the turning point in Mean Girls, the song and scene come together to live up to the moment, which is both horrifying and mesmerizing.

 2  “Revenge Party” 
Performed by Auli’i Cravalho, Jaquel Spivey &amp; Angourie Rice
        

When Janis and Damian come together to perform a song, viewers know they’re in for a good time, and “Revenge Party” is the perfect example of this. It’s the catchiest song in Mean Girls, with shocking lyrics like “we&#39;ll roll on the grass and stare up at the sun / And we&#39;ll stuff her remains in a bag” potentially getting overlooked for the sing-along chorus. “Revenge Party” is another opportunity for Cravalho and Spivey’s voices to shine.
“Revenge Party” is also the biggest number in the movie musical. As the trio envisions getting revenge on Regina, they enter a dream sequence full of color, costumes, and dancing. At 4:45, “Revenge Party” is also the longest song on the Mean Girls soundtrack, having iconic dialogue like “you go Glen Coco” mixed in with the singing. “Revenge Party” is a certified earworm, sticking in your audience members&#39; heads far after the credits roll.





 1  “World Burn” 
Performed by Reneé Rapp


 







The climax of Mean Girls also happens to be the highlight of the soundtrack, with Rapp performing “World Burn” as she reveals the contents of the Burn Book to everyone at North Shore High. Just like “Someone Gets Hurt,” it’s a chilling moment, strengthened by Rapp’s strong vocals and conviction as Regina. “World Burn” builds throughout until it ends with Rapp belting about wanting to watch the world burn and turn everyone mean.
“World Burn” is by far the most impressive vocal performance in Mean Girls, as the movie musical saved Rapp’s best for last. In the musical number, she embraces her full power as Regina George, unleashing not just amazing vocals but sinister energy as well. By having some of the best songs on the Mean Girls soundtrack, Regina and Rapp are true stars of the movie musical.
