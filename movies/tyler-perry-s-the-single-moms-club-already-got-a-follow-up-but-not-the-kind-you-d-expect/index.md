## Literature Review

A follow-up to Tyler Perry&#39;s comedy-drama The Single Moms Club debuted less than a year after the film&#39;s premiere, but it wasn&#39;t a traditional sequel.




As the title suggests, Tyler Perry&#39;s The Single Moms Club revolves around five single mothers joining forces to support one another. Perry had so much faith in the movie that he created its follow-up before it premiered. The 2014 comedy-drama film was directed, written, and produced by Perry and starred Nia Long as May, Amy Smart as Hillary, Cocoa Brown as Lytia, Terry Crews as Branson, William Levy as Manny, Wendi McLendon-Covey as Jan, Ryan Eggold as Peter, Zulay Henao as Esperanza, and Perry as TK. Unfortunately, the movie received widespread negative reviews and flopped at the box office, grossing only $16.4 million against an $8 million budget.




Despite its failure in theaters, the ending of The Single Moms Club was not the conclusion of this premise on the screen. Perry created, directed, wrote, and executive produced a follow-up story to the 2014 film prior to its release. The project was already in motion, so even a bad performance at the box office did not stop it from going forward. However, the follow-up to The Single Moms Club was not a traditional sequel.


 Tyler Perry&#39;s The Single Moms Club Was Also Turned Into A TV Show Called If Loving You Is Wrong 
          

In January 2014, a couple of months before The Single Moms Club premiered in theaters, reports revealed that the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN) had ordered a television show from Tyler Perry based on the comedy-drama film â€” If Loving You Is Wrong. It was not a sequel to the movie, as it featured new characters (and one old one) with different stories, but it followed a similar premise. The adaptation revolved around the lives and relationships of five couples who happened to be neighbors. The prime-time television soap opera series premiered on September 9, 2014, on OWN, and it was much more successful than The Single Moms Club.




Perry&#39;s If Loving You Is Wrong ran for five seasons on the network, and its pilot was the highest-rated series premiere in the history of OWN. So, whereas The Single Moms Club garnered negative reviews and a terrible box office outing, the soap opera received excellent ratings and a long run on television. Overall, the only concrete similarities between the movie and the show were that Perry created them and Zulay Henao starred as Esperanza Willis in both projects (although her character and storyline were restructured for the OWN series).

 Why A TV Show Was Made Instead Of The Single Moms Club 2 
          




If Loving You Is Wrong was developed before Tyler Perry&#39;s 2014 comedy-drama film was released, and given the reactions to both projects, it makes sense why a traditional sequel was never made. The soap opera was a massive success compared to the movie, which was a box-office failure and received negative reviews. It wouldn&#39;t have been wise for Perry to produce a direct sequel to The Single Moms Club since the adapted television series was performing well, and there was no need to make another film.



The Single Moms Club is available to stream on Netflix.
