## Literature Review
Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire introduces a spider woman whose heartbreaking story is overshadowed by her desire for revenge. 




The sci-fi epic Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire introduces a massive universe filled with a variety of sentient species, including a type of spider-like creature native to the caves of Daggus. The vast interplanetary landscape is integral to Rebel Moon&#39;s story, which aims to document the stand taken against the prepotent empire known as the Motherworld and its military faction, the Imperium, by the epic&#39;s leading protagonist, Kora (Sofia Boutella). The Motherworld&#39;s reach envelops the galaxy, and as such, it rules over not just human-inhabited worlds, but planets occupied by fantastical species of creatures, all of whom are affected differently by the Motherworld&#39;s subjugation.




As Kora travels through the galaxy to rally constituents for her cause, she encounters many of Rebel Moon&#39;s cast of characters and eventually recruits an expert sword wielder called Nemesis (Bae Doona) on the planet, Daggus. Nemesis does not immediately pledge herself to Kora&#39;s insurgency though, because she is committed to stopping the onslaught of Harmada, a spider woman who has been terrorizing a mining town on Daggus. Harmada is the only member of her species who is shown in the Rebel Moon movie, and as a result, much of what audiences can deduce about her kind is established from her conflict with Nemesis.

 Harmada Is Played By Jena Malone In Rebel Moon 
          




Harmada&#39;s appearance is so otherworldly that it is hard to discern that well-known actress Jena Malone plays the spider woman. Malone is perhaps best recognized for her role in The Hunger Games film franchise as District 7 victor, Johanna Mason, but the actress also performed in a myriad of noteworthy roles throughout her career. Malone can be recognized as Young Ellie in Contact, Gretchen Ross in Donnie Darko, Lydia Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, Jenet Klyburn in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Ruby in The Neon Demon, among countless other roles.

In Rebel Moon, Malone is hidden under a combination of practical and digital effects, including prosthetic devices and layered CGI, to attain her characteristic spider appearance. Visual effects supervisor Marcus Taormina elaborates on the process of creating Harmada in an interview with befores &amp; afters, confirming the use of all sorts of innovative equipment:


So what we did was, special effects made this swivel rig. And we had five or six stunt performers moving the rig, but also with pool noodles to interact as the Spider&#39;s leg with Doona. So when Doona blocks, she&#39;s blocking a pool noodle, which becomes a leg, so on and so forth. Then it&#39;s just this cohesive marriage of stunts, special effects, Jenna&#39;s performance, Doona&#39;s performance, and just all of that timed out perfectly.





The complicated process turns out to be a triumphant complement to Rebel Moon&#39;s sci-fi premise, as Harmada&#39;s gargantuan and chilling appearance makes her one of the film&#39;s most notable inhuman species.



 Harmada&#39;s Ogumo Species &amp; What Happened To Them Explained 
          

Harmada&#39;s character arc, though short, is also a notable aspect of Rebel Moon, because it is complex and quite heartbreaking as well. Harmada comes from a spider-like alien species known as the ogumo, who are characterized by large spider-like lower halves, upper torsos that are humanoid in nature, and exoskeletons meant to endure the harsh conditions of Daggus. As is the case for Harmada, the ogumo are said to be native to the caves of Daggus, which are also prime locations for the Motherworld&#39;s mining initiatives.

According to Rebel Moon&#39;s lore, the Motherworld took advantage of the resources generated by the caves of Daggus, demolishing the environment in their pursuit of reaping resources and hunting down any ogumo who hindered the process. The ogumo were rendered nearly extinct as a result of the Motherworld&#39;s mining venture, as they were considered to be savage creatures as well as dangerous threats to industrial operations. Harmada is allegedly the last of her kind by the events of Rebel Moon, which prompts her brutal plot for revenge against Daggus&#39; miners.






 Why Harmada Wanted Revenge On Daggus&#39; Miners 
          

The mining operations in Daggus&#39; caves left the environment toxic and heavily polluted, and Harmada confirms that the deleterious conditions have weakened her body during her confrontation with Nemesis. Harmada also verifies that the toxic environment of the caves stunted the maturation of her eggs, making it impossible for her to hatch offspring. Harmada is not only devastated by her inability to reproduce, but distressed by her inability to maintain her species that has become doomed to true extinction.

While heartbreaking, Harmada&#39;s life story is what leads her to enact a revenge plot against the miners of Daggus, and she attempts to kidnap the children of mining families to force her pain upon their mothers. Her desperation is acknowledged by Nemesis, yet still, the swordmaster makes it a mission to end her onslaught of terror on the mining town and recover a child that Harmada has already kidnapped. By the conclusion of their confrontation, Nemesis successfully thwarts Harmada, but is deeply aggrieved by the circumstances of the kill.

 What The Spider Woman&#39;s Death Means For Nemesis &amp; Rebel Moon Part 2 
   Close     

The confrontation between Nemesis and Harmada may have been short in the grand scheme of Rebel Moon&#39;s story, but the event could be an indicator of what could occur for Nemesis in the upcoming Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver. While unlikely to transpire for Harmada, resurrection has become a big aspect of Rebel Moon&#39;s canon and could come to be a facet of Harmada&#39;s storyline. With the extinction of her species to motivate her, Harmada could come to blows with Nemesis again in the sequel.



Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver is set for release on April 19, 2024.







However, because Harmada is presumably dead, Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver will probably become a measure of Nemesis&#39; character growth and motivations. Much of Nemesis&#39; disposition is demonstrated after the murder of Harmada - Nemesis expresses deep remorse for the spider woman, as she was simply a victim of the Motherworld&#39;s agenda who fell prey to her desire for revenge. This pivotal event in Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire could mean that Nemesis becomes a moral compass for Kora&#39;s group of insurgents, a staunch proponent of the rebellion against the Motherworld, or even a lone swordmaster with her own agenda in the events of the upcoming sequel.
