## Literature Review

The initial plan for DC Studios&#39; new DC Universe timeline mirrors the early days of the DCEU, which may be the best choice for the upcoming franchise.




The plans for the timeline of the new DC Universe suggest the DC Extended Universe&#39;s own timeline was the perfect layout. Filmmaker Gunn and producer Safran were hired as co-CEOs of the newly-established DC Studios in November 2022, and immediately set into motion plans to reset DC&#39;s live-action superhero franchise. The DCEU timeline officially came to an end with the December 2023 release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, while 2024 marks the beginning of a new chapter for DC Studios with the releases of Creature Commandos and Waller, leading up to 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy.




James Gunn revealed part of the line-up for the DC Universe&#39;s Chapter 1, titled &#34;Gods and Monsters&#34;, in January 2023, announcing the development of ten new projects across film, TV, and animation. DC Studios&#39; new franchise is expected to properly kick-off with Superman: Legacy in 2025, which will introduce David Corenswet as the titular superhero and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane. Although it&#39;s been stressed that DC Studios&#39; new franchise will make many changes from the previous DCEU, the initial plans for the DC Universe&#39;s timeline are actually strikingly similar to the original plans for the DCEU, which also started with a Superman-centric project with 2013&#39;s Man of Steel.

                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   


 DCU&#39;s Initial Movie Timeline Mirrors The DCEU&#39;s Own 
          




It&#39;s interesting to note that the DC Extended Universe and the upcoming DC Universe begin with a project putting Superman front-and-center. Man of Steel debuted Henry Cavill as Clark Kent and Amy Adams as Lois Lane, both of whom became cornerstones of the franchise, although they were arguably neglected by Warner Bros. and DC Films. Superman: Legacy will kick-start the DCU with a new Superman story, but is also expected to spend a great deal of time building the world of DC Studios&#39; new franchise, whereas Man of Steel involved a more insular storyline. Both franchises starting with a project focusing on Superman isn&#39;t the only similarity in their timelines, however.

Controversially, Warner Bros. continued the DCEU with 2016&#39;s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, debuting Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne and thrusting him immediately into a skirmish with Superman. This is set to be repeated in the DC Universe: The Brave and the Bold, a Batman-focused story introducing a new actor as the Caped Crusader and exploring his family dynamic with his son, Damian Wayne, a version of Robin, will follow Superman: Legacy. It&#39;s unclear whether Superman will appear in The Brave and the Bold, or if the DCU&#39;s first Batman project will be a separate story, but this DCU release schedule seems to be repeating that of the DCEU.






 Why The DCU Needed To Begin By Introducing Superman &amp; Batman 
          

Even though starting the DC Universe with a Superman project followed by a Batman project might hint at DC Studios simply repeating the mistakes of the past, this timeline choice actually makes perfect sense for the upcoming franchise. Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck were at the core of the DCEU as Superman and Batman, so Superman: Legacy and The Brave and the Bold can quickly establish the recastings of these integral and iconic characters. These stories will be proof for audiences of the DC Universe that DC Studios is actually making widespread and immediate changes, potentially building up hype for future adventures and new storytelling techniques in the franchise&#39;s future.
