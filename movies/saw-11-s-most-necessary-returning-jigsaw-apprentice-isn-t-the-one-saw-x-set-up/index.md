# Saw 11 s Most Necessary Returning Jigsaw Apprentice Isn t The One Saw X Set Up


## SUMMARY 



  Saw X&#39;s success with John Kramer as the lead suggests that Saw XI will likely continue this trend.   Mark Hoffman&#39;s appearance in the mid-credits scene of Saw X sets him up as the next apprentice to appear in a Saw movie.   Logan Nelson, Kramer&#39;s first apprentice, would be a better option to explore in the story of Saw XI, filling in the gap in their working relationship and bringing back a character that is more similar to Kramer in personality.

## Literature Review
Saw X&#39;s mid-credits scene sets up one Jigsaw apprentice to return in Saw XI, but there&#39;s a much better option that has been greatly overlooked.




Though Saw X sets up one character&#39;s return, Saw XI needs to bring back a different Jigsaw apprentice. John Kramer&#39;s back in the front seat as the Jigsaw Killer with the assistance of his apprentice Amanda Young in the 2023 film Saw X. The film was expected to flop because it turned Kramer into a hero, but it did exceptionally well, grossing 111 million dollars against a 13 million dollar budget (via Box Office Mojo). After this success, Lionsgate quickly confirmed Saw XI with a 2024 release date.




Considering Saw X did well with Kramer as the lead, it&#39;s likely they will continue this trend in the next film. As such, it would need to occur sometime between Kramer becoming Jigsaw and him dying. A Saw XI prequel story also needs to bring back more beloved characters from the franchise. The most obvious option – Amanda Young – has already happened; however, the film could switch gears by incorporating another one of Jigsaw&#39;s apprentices.

Hoffman Will Almost Definitely Appear In Saw XI
          

John Kramer talks to a detective in Saw X to ask about finding someone&#39;s location. This is a small nod to Detective Mark Hoffman, an apprentice of Kramer and successor as the Jigsaw Killer. The phone call could be seen as a voice-over cameo meant to appease fans of the franchise. While he isn’t well-liked by Saw fans, he is one of the most recognizable and significant Jigsaw apprentices, alongside Amanda. It would’ve seemed incomplete if both characters didn’t at least get recognition in the movie.




However, at the end of Saw X, the detective makes an appearance in the mid-credits scene. This is seemingly meant to set up Hoffman as the next apprentice to appear in a Saw movie. This could go one of two ways. Like Saw X, Saw XI could be a prequel that focuses on Jigsaw and one of his apprentices. In this case, it makes sense that the movie would move on from Amanda. Alternatively, if the writers wanted to move forward in the timeline, the story could focus on Hoffman’s reign as the Jigsaw Killer, adding a prequel between Saw V and Saw VI.

Even though they set up Mark Hoffman for Saw XI, the story would be much better off exploring Jigsaw’s Logan Nelson. Firstly, he’s Kramer’s first apprentice, but the movies don’t really explore their working relationship. The only thing known is that he helped build some of Kramer’s old traps. By the time Amanda and Hoffman arrive in the Saw franchise, Kramer and Nelson have already parted ways. Presumably, they had an amicable split because neither revealed each other’s identities. As such, there’s a huge gap in the story that the writers can fill without disrupting the timeline.

Additionally, he’s one of Kramer’s most fascinating apprentices. Hoffman and Amanda both show sadistic tendencies with their traps, going much further than Kramer would. They both seem to revel in the pain of their victims. On the other hand, it’s unclear how and why Nelson would become involved in the Jigsaw apprenticeship. He doesn’t seem to take joy in others’ pain the way the two primary apprentices do. The only time he displays a sadistic tendency is when he’s getting revenge on Halloran for killing his wife. This would give Saw XI a villain that is much more like Kramer in personality and demeanor.




              Related   Saw 11 Loses Part Of What Made Saw X So Great   New confirmation from one of the writers of Saw X has revealed Saw XI will be losing part of what made the newest installment so great.    

Lastly, Nelson is the best option to include if the Saw franchise ever wishes to continue the story chronologically instead of only doing prequels. Amanda and Hoffman are both dead, so they couldn’t take the lead in the franchise. Dr. Gordon doesn’t have enough backstory to be a compelling Jigsaw Killer at this point in the franchise – an issue that could be rectified in future installations. This leaves Nelson, who is similar to Kramer and takes over as the killer in Jigsaw.

The best option for Saw XI to include Logan Nelson is to set the movie after his test when Kramer takes him on as an apprentice. This would allow audiences to develop more of a connection with Logan. It would also allow him to grow as a character, showing his personality and values in relation to the deadly games. Except for his slightly vengeful side directed at Halloran, it&#39;s unclear why he wants to be involved in Kramer&#39;s games.




Most importantly, it would set up a clear-cut future for the franchise. While Saw X was a surprising success, it&#39;s unlikely they could continue with prequels for very long without boring audiences. As of now, Kramer is the only character who can hold up a Saw movie on their own. By focusing Saw XI on this time period, they could develop Nelson into a character who is compelling enough to maintain the franchise as they move forward with Saw XII and other future films.
