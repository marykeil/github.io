 Kung Fu Panda 4 Wishlist: 10 Things We Need To See 
With a story that began in 2008, Dreamworks will likely incorporate elements from both the television shows and the movies into Kung Fu Panda 4.












 








 10  Jack Black Reprising The Role Of Po 
The beloved Kung Fu Panda star is reprising the iconic titular role


 







Since the very beginning, the heart and soul of the Kung Fu Panda franchise has been Jack Black’s performance in the titular role of Po. On top of the character’s hilarious goofiness, Black has always brought an endearing warmth to this character, making him easy to root for. Kung Fu Panda 4 is worth getting excited about just for the prospect of hearing another brilliant voice performance by Black as this lovable martial arts master. Black proved with his turn as Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie that he’s still worth his weight in gold as a voice actor.





 9  The Next Chapter Of Po&#39;s Journey 
Po is seeking his successor for the title of Dragon Warrior
        

Following on from the initial Kung Fu Panda trilogy, Kung Fu Panda 4 will see Po embark on the next chapter of his journey. This isn’t another standalone adventure for the Dragon Warrior; it’ll see Po looking to retire and seeking out a new kung fu master to take on that title. With this storyline, Kung Fu Panda 4 will bring the saga full circle as Po passes on the mantle he worked so hard to earn in the first film.





 8  Ke Huy Quan&#39;s Appearance 
Ke Huy Quan plays Han, the leader of a den of thieves
        

Ever since his Oscar-winning turn as Waymond Wang in Everything Everywhere All at Once, Ke Huy Quan has been enjoying a much-deserved Hollywood comeback. He’s since appeared in Loki season 2 as the TVA’s gatekeeper, Ouroboros, and starred as Jamie Yao in the short-lived Disney&#43; series American Born Chinese. That career comeback will continue in Kung Fu Panda 4 with the role of Han, the leader of a den of thieves. Whenever Quan pops up in a movie or TV show, he always lights up the screen with infectious enthusiasm.





 7  The Return Of Tai Lung 
The formidable villain from the first Kung Fu Panda movie is back


 







Way back in the original Kung Fu Panda film, Po proved himself to be worthy of the title of Dragon Warrior by defeating Tai Lung. Tai Lung is Shifu’s adopted son and former apprentice who turned evil. He was the first and still remains one of the most memorable Kung Fu Panda villains. In Kung Fu Panda 4, the new villain, The Chameleon, will bring Tai Lung back from the Spirit Realm. It’ll be interesting to see if his stint in the Spirit World has given him time to reflect on his past mistakes.





 6  Viola Davis&#39; Performance As The Villain

Viola Davis has been cast to play The Chameleon, the main antagonist of Kung Fu Panda 4. Not only is Davis one of the few performers to have earned the EGOT; she’s also great at playing villains. Davis’ turn as the villainous Dr. Volumnia Gaul was one of the highlights of The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes and her cold-hearted portrayal of Amanda Waller in The Suicide Squad was genuinely unsettling in some parts. It’ll be interesting to see what Davis does with a Kung Fu Panda villain role.





 5  The Chameleon&#39;s Sinister Shapeshifting Ability 
Kung Fu Panda 4&#39;s villain can take the form of whoever she chooses
        

The villain in Kung Fu Panda 4 isn’t just exciting because the role is played by a world-class actor. She also has a sinister superpower that gives her the potential to become the most formidable villain in the entire franchise. The Chameleon has the ability to shapeshift. When she’s taking on an opponent in a fight, she can absorb that person’s kung fu abilities – and even morph herself to assume their form – and use them against them. She’s a perfect match for any opponent, because she can turn herself into that opponent.





 4  Hans Zimmer&#39;s Epic Musical Score 
After scoring the first three Kung Fu Panda films, Hans Zimmer is returning to compose the music for Kung Fu Panda 4
        

Hans Zimmer is one of the most legendary film composers working today. His music brought an appropriate weight and gravitas to the visually stunning action of the first three Kung Fu Panda movies, and now, he’s returning to do the same for Kung Fu Panda 4. Zimmer is best known for scoring epic-scale blockbusters like Dune, Gladiator, and The Dark Knight trilogy. By bringing the same grandeur to his Kung Fu Panda music, Zimmer has elevated the material and given the franchise some dynamism.





 3  Awkwafina&#39;s Role As Po&#39;s Sidekick 
Awkwafina plays Zhen, a thief who joins Po in his latest adventure


 







Awkwafina is joining the Kung Fu Panda ensemble to play Po’s sidekick in Kung Fu Panda 4. Zhen is a thief who joins Po in his latest adventure. Awkwafina can always be counted on to provide some fun comic relief and stand out in a supporting role in a star-studded blockbuster. This can be seen in her performances as Constance in Ocean’s 8, Goh Peik Lin in Crazy Rich Asians, and Katy in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.





 2  A Star-Studded Supporting Cast 
The voices of Bryan Cranston, James Hong, and Lori Tan Chinn will be heard in Kung Fu Panda 4
        

The A-list stars in the main cast of Kung Fu Panda 4 are backed up by even more A-list stars appearing in supporting roles. Dustin Hoffman is reprising his role as Master Shifu; James Hong is reprising his role as Mr. Ping, Po’s adoptive father; Bryan Cranston is returning as Li Shan, Po’s biological father (who he met in Kung Fu Panda 3); and Ian McShane is back as Tai Lung. Plus, the great Lori Tan Chinn and Ronny Chieng are joining the cast as Granny Boar and a fish that lives in a pelican’s mouth, respectively.





 1  The Furious Five&#39;s Secret Role 
The Furious Five will appear in Kung Fu Panda 4 – but they&#39;re mysteriously left out of the trailer
        

When the trailer for Kung Fu Panda 4 dropped, the most confusing aspect was that Po’s colleagues in the Furious Five – Masters Tigress, Monkey, Crane, Mantis, and Viper – were completely absent. Director Mike Mitchell told NBC that the Furious Five are, indeed, in the movie, which makes it all the more tantalizing that they were left out of the trailers. What could the Furious Five’s secret role in Kung Fu Panda 4 entail? Maybe they’re off on their own adventure in a B-plot.
