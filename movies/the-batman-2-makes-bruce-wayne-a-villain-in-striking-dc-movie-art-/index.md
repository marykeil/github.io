# The Batman 2 Makes Bruce Wayne A Villain In Striking DC Movie Art 


## SUMMARY 



  The Batman - Part II will not be part of the new DC Universe, and Robert Pattinson returns as the Dark Knight in one of the first DC Elseworlds movies.   The fan poster suggests that Hush should be the main villain in The Batman - Part II.   However, James Gunn has revealed that Hush and other characters will not appear in the sequel, leaving room for other interesting Batman foes like Mr. Freeze, Killer Croc, or a return of Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker.

## Literature Review

The Batman - Part II could have a few different foes; however, a gritty DC fan poster transforms Bruce Wayne into the villain with a clever twist.




The Batman - Part II fan poster transforms Bruce Wayne into the villain. The sequel to the beloved The Batman will not be part of the new DC Universe, with Robert Pattinson&#39;s return as the Dark Knight happening in one of the first DC Elseworlds movies. Following a setup in the original movie, The Batman - Part II&#39;s story could feature Hush as its main villain.




On Instagram, artist @marvels.wolverine shared a striking The Batman - Part II fan poster that spotlights Hush&#39;s connection to Bruce Wayne.


 

In the comics, Tommy Elliot, aka Hush, is Bruce&#39;s childhood friend who attempts to murder his own parents to inherit their money. As an adult, Elliot got plastic surgery to look just like Bruce Wayne. The Batman - Part II fan poster makes a nod to that, with half of Pattinson&#39;s cowl being replaced by Hush&#39;s characteristic bandages.

                  Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond   Here&#39;s every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.   


 Who Could Be The Batman 2’s Main Villain? 
          




While the fan poster makes the case for why Hush as The Batman - Part II&#39;s villain would be interesting and the first movie in the franchise teased the character, Hush should not appear in the sequel. The reason for that is that James Gunn has revealed that Hush and other characters are not in The Batman - Part II. According to the DC Studios co-CEO, Batman villains Hush, Clayface, Professor Pyg, and Scarecrow — as well as the first Robin, Dick Grayson — are not in the DC film.

The Batman teased director Matt Reeves&#39; version of Hush a couple of times, with the most blatant nod being a quick scene where a reporter is referred to as Elliott, and the word &#34;Hush&#34; appears across the screen in a video Batman watches. With Gunn debunking Hush&#39;s involvement in the sequel, The Batman - Part II loses a great villain. However, there are many interesting Batman foes available to make up for Hush&#39;s absence from the sequel.

Based on The Batman&#39;s ending, if the sequel chooses to continue with the plot of Gotham City being flooded, then either Mr. Freeze or Killer Croc could become the main threat to Pattinson&#39;s Dark Knight. Alternatively, Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker could also return in a big way, taking the place of his friend, The Riddler, as the main villain of The Batman - Part II. With Batman having one of the comics&#39; best Rogues Gallery, even if Hush is not the main villain of the movie, The Batman - Part II has plenty of exciting options to make the sequel even better than the original film.








The Batman - Part II releases on October 3, 2025.
