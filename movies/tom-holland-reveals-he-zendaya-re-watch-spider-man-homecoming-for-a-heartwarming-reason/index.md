## Literature Review

Tom Holland has revealed the emotional reason why he and Zendaya often rewatch Spider-Man: Homecoming, the actor&#39;s first solo movie as Peter Parker.




Tom Holland and Zendaya continue to rewatch Spider-Man: Homecoming, their first Marvel Cinematic Universe Spider-Man film, for a heartwarming reason, as revealed by the Peter Parker actor. Holland will soon return as the wall-crawler for the MCU&#39;s Spider-Man 4. While Zendaya&#39;s MJ might not be in the film, given her status in Spider-Man: No Way Home&#39;s ending, which would mark the first of the MCU Spider-Man movies without her, the actress continues to share a deep bond with the franchise, as does Holland.




Speaking to Extra, Holland revealed that he and Zendaya have a habit of rewatching Spider-Man: Homecoming to &#34;reminisce about being 19.&#34;


 

Spider-Man: Homecoming reviews were great when the movie came out, making Peter Parker&#39;s first MCU movie an instant classic. The movie&#39;s high school setting was refreshing among the rest of the MCU heroes. Now, Holland reveals that he and Zendaya rewatch Spider-Man: Homecoming &#34;every now and then&#34; to remember that moment of their lives &#34;and making those movies again.&#34; Check out the full quote:


“Zendaya and I will, every now and then, watch &#39;Spider-Man 1&#39; and reminisce about being 19 and making those movies again. I love those movies, and I love savoring those moments, so I try not to watch them as often as I would maybe like to because it’s so special. It&#39;s such a luxury, such a gift to be able to sit down and sort of relive your youth. I wouldn’t be the man I am today without that job.”





                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.   


 What Tom Holland’s Spider-Man Future May Hold 
A Major Villain Has Been Set Up For Spider-Man 4
          

Holland is returning as Peter Parker for the MCU&#39;s Spider-Man 4. The movie currently has no release date set, with work on the MCU&#39;s next Spider-Man adventure being resumed after the 2023 Hollywood strikes. While the movie has no script, the name of director Drew Goddard has come up in recent rumors as a possible replacement for MCU Spider-Man trilogy director Jon Watts.

Goddard would be a fantastic pick for Spider-Man 4, as the movie is also rumored to continue a major storyline that Marvel is setting up across multiple projects. Echo&#39;s season finale teased that Vincent D&#39;Onofrio&#39;s Wilson Fisk will become the Mayor of New York City, which should be a major plot point of Daredevil: Born Again. In the comics, Kingpin started a hunt for NYC&#39;s heroes, even assembling his own team of supervillains to track down Daredevil, Spider-Man, the Punisher, and others.




Daredevil: Born Again could begin the setup for that major event, which is rumored to be the plot of Holland&#39;s Spider-Man 4. That would align with the talk about Goddard helming the movie, as he was responsible for creating Netflix&#39;s Daredevil series. Spider-Man: No Way Home was a major multiverse story that ended with the perfect setup for a more mature, street-level story for Spider-Man 4. Based on the MCU rumors and how Kingpin&#39;s story is shaping up, it seems like Spider-Man 4 could pay that off, going for a completely different tone from Spider-Man: Homecoming, which shows how much Holland&#39;s Peter has grown.
