## Literature Review

The full line-up of the MCU&#39;s Thunderbolts team - plus a couple exciting additions - has been imagined in a brilliant new fan-made Phase 6 poster.




The first line-up for the titular team in Marvel Studios&#39; Thunderbolts join forces in a new fan-made poster promoting the upcoming film, releasing as part of Phase 6 of the MCU. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige first confirmed the development of Thunderbolts in July 2022, with Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell, Hannah John-Kamen, Olga Kurylenko and Julia Louis-Dreyfus revealed to be reprising their previous MCU roles only two months later. Set to release on July 25, 2025, Marvel Studios&#39; Thunderbolts will bring these previous villains and antiheroes together under the rule of the CIA and United States government, putting a spin on the MCU&#39;s typical team-up stories.




When Thunderbolts&#39; cast of characters was revealed in September 2022, there was some confusion about the omission of some of the team&#39;s most iconic members from Marvel Comics. Most notably, Daniel BrÃ¼hl&#39;s Baron Helmut Zemo, who led versions of the Thunderbolts in Marvel Comics, was left off the roster. However, he has now been depicted alongside the team&#39;s other members in a brilliant fan-made Thunderbolts poster shared by MJD Artworks.


 

Interestingly, the art also features the MCU&#39;s Red Hulk as a member of the team, despite the character not being confirmed for the MCU. There is huge speculation that Phase 5 will finally see the highly-anticipated Red Hulk emerge, however.

                  Red Hulk&#39;s MCU Introduction May Prove Fatal For 1 Powerful MCU Villain   The Red Hulk is finally on his way to the Marvel Cinematic Universe--but that may be bad news for one of the franchise&#39;s oldest villains.   





 Will President Ross Become Red Hulk In Captain America 4 &amp; Thunderbolts? 
         

When the villain debuted in Marvel Comics&#39; 2008 story Hulk (Vol. 3) #1, the identity of Red Hulk was kept hidden, but was soon revealed to be none other than General Ross, a long-time antagonist to Bruce Banner&#39;s Hulk. In the MCU, General Ross was portrayed by William Hurt between 2008&#39;s The Incredible Hulk and 2021&#39;s Black Widow, but the character was recast following Hurt&#39;s passing in 2022. Harrison Ford is set to make his first appearance as Ross, now the President of the United States, in 2025&#39;s Captain America: Brave New World, and has been confirmed for Thunderbolts, too, raising speculation that he will finally transform into Red Hulk.

The idea of the President of the United States transforming into a powerful MCU villain may seem outlandish, but with rumors that President Ross and Sam Wilson&#39;s Captain America won&#39;t see eye-to-eye, and Ross&#39; involvement in Thunderbolts, this evolution seems quite likely. The MCU&#39;s Multiverse Saga has put a lot of focus on Hulk-related characters, including Bruce Banner&#39;s Smart Hulk, Jennifer Walters&#39; She-Hulk, Emil Blonsky&#39;s Abomination and Samuel Sterns&#39; Leader, who will reappear in Brave New World. This suggests that Marvel Studios may be gearing up to showcase President Ross&#39; transformation into Red Hulk in Thunderbolts, which makes the Phase 6 project even more exciting.
