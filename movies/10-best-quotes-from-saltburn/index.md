## Literature Review

Saltburn&#39;s blackly comedic tone and sharp script produce some incredibly funny and illuminating quotes. Here are 10 of the movie&#39;s best.




Warning: Contains SPOILERS for SaltburnWritten and directed by Emerald Fennell, Saltburn is a wickedly sharp black comedy, boasting one of 2023&#39;s wittiest scripts and providing plenty of delicious quotes for audiences to enjoy. A play on the likes of Evelyn Waugh&#39;s Brideshead Revisited, as well as a satire on England&#39;s relationship with class, the movie is full of colorful characters delivering killer lines. As such, many of the movie&#39;s best quotes are not just hilarious but also help to illuminate the rest of the action and themes.
Saltburn stars Barry Keoghan as Oliver Quick, a student at Oxford University who quickly finds himself drawn towards the charismatic and aristocratic Felix Catton. After revealing his difficult family circumstances, Oliver is invited by Felix to stay at his titular Saltburn estate. However, it soon becomes clear that all is not as it seems, sparking a riotous story of lust, love, and violence. Populating the background are members of Felix&#39;s eccentric family, who not only help shape the plot, but also provide some of the most memorable one-liners in the movie. Whether subtly revealing or just laugh-out-loud funny, here are Saltburn&#39;s best quotes.
            
 
 Saltburn Ending Explained: What Really Happened To Felix 
The ending of Emerald Fennell&#39;s Saltburn is built on a web of lies spun by Oliver Quick and reveals the twisted layers of his obsession with Felix.












 








 10  &#34;I wasn&#39;t in love with him...&#34; 
Oliver Quick


 







Oliver&#39;s complicated relationship with Felix is one of the central themes in Saltburn. At times, he seems simultaneously besotted, revolted, and enamored with him – a dynamic that leads to several of Saltburn&#39;s most shocking moments. His opening monologue, in which he outlines several contradictory aspects of their relationship, is therefore crucial in understanding his behavior throughout the rest of the film. Not only does it establish Oliver as a potentially unreliable narrator, but establishes that Saltburn itself is a movie full of deception and dishonesty. It might be less immediately memorable than other quotes, but it offers great insight into the film&#39;s themes.





 9  &#34;Ask me a sum&#34; 
Michael Gavey
        

Oliver&#39;s outsider status at Oxford is established early on. One of the funniest ways the film does this is to juxtapose him against the socially inept and often combustible Michael Gavey. A maths prodigy, Gavey attempts to bond with Oliver by displaying his numerical prowess – daring him to &#34;ask me a sum.&#34; This memorably devolves into a screaming match in front of the whole college, with Gavey bellowing at Oliver to &#34;ask me a f***ing sum, then!&#34; It may not be the most illuminating Saltburn quote, but Gavey&#39;s outburst is shocking and hilarious in equal measure.





 8  &#34;Hi, Granny!&#34; 
Felix Catton
        

Oliver&#39;s arrival at Saltburn is a moment of wonder for both him and the audience. The estate&#39;s history, size, and splendor are awe-inspiring from an outside perspective, and clearly captivate Oliver from the outset. However, the movie hilariously contrasts this with the ostentatiously casual attitude displayed by Felix when he gives his guest the grand tour. Pointing out a succession of &#34;ghastly&#34; paintings by the Dutch painter Vermeer, he then waves his hand at some portraits of &#34;dead rellies&#34; before finally mentioning the ghost of his grandmother who inhabits one of the bedrooms. Greeting her with a supplicatory &#34;Hi, Granny!&#34; instantly established Saltburn as a house unlike any other in the funniest way possible.





 7  &#34;We&#39;re all about to lose our minds&#34; 
Venetia Catton
        

Felix&#39;s younger sister, Venetia, is secretly one of the most observant and prescient characters in the movie. This is typified by her remarks about the upcoming full moon. Made before the full extent of Saltburn&#39;s madness is made clear, her prediction that &#34;We&#39;re all about to lose our minds&#34; is not only a great piece of foreshadowing but also alerts the viewer to the fact that this house and these characters are a potentially explosive combination. It may seem off the cuff, but this comment sets the tone for the rest of the movie.
            
 
 7 Saltburn Theories That Totally Change How You See The Movie 
Saltburn is a film packed with hidden details and references. Examining it in between the lines, there are plenty of theories that change its meaning.








 6  &#34;Lots of people get lost in Saltburn&#34; 
Duncan


 







Another incredibly perceptive comment is made by the valet, Duncan, as both an observation and a warning. Said to Oliver as he is examining some of the house&#39;s collection of artifacts, the remark suggests that Duncan is all too aware of the intoxicating effect that the house and the Cattons&#39; lifestyle can have on anyone not already inoculated. Considering what is later revealed about Oliver&#39;s plan to murder the house&#39;s inhabitants and claim Saltburn for himself, these words only become more significant as the film progresses.





 5  &#34;It couldn&#39;t have been about me. I&#39;ve never wanted to know anything&#34; 
Elspeth Catton
        

Elspeth Catton, Felix&#39;s gloriously arch mother, is probably the funniest character in the movie. Equal parts malicious, vulnerable, dry, and pompous, she embodies the Cattons&#39; casual privilege, dropping extraordinary anecdotes with a triviality that only makes them more impactful. Her remarks about the Pulp song &#34;Common People&#34; are a perfect example.
Discussing a rumor that she was the real inspiration for Jarvis Cocker&#39;s lyrics about a young woman who &#34;Came from Greece and had a thirst for knowledge&#34;, Elspeth coquettishly explains how it couldn&#39;t possibly have been about her as she&#39;s &#34;never wanted to know anything,&#34; despite her connection to the band. The mere suggestion that she could have inspired one of the greatest indie rock songs ever instantly reveals just how significant a figure Elsepth is, with her blasé attitude to this status providing a witty insight into her character.





 4  &#34;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a spider. I think you&#39;re a moth.&#34; 
Venetia Catton
        

Venetia and Oliver&#39;s complex dynamic is one of the most compelling things in Saltburn. While it initially seems that Venetia has the upper hand, Oliver is soon able to turn the tables – as he is on all the Cattons. One quote from Venetia simultaneously reveals how perceptive she is, while also revealing the extent to which she underestimates Oliver.
Immediately, she can recognize that Oliver wants something more than a memorable summer in the country, likening him to a &#34;moth&#34; drawn towards Saltburn&#39;s flame. However, she mistakenly believes him to be, &#34;Quiet, harmless, drawn to shiny things, batting up against the window, just desperate to get in.&#34; This is an early warning sign that there&#39;s much more to Oliver than meets the eye – a precursor to Saltburn&#39;s dramatic twist ending.





 3  &#34;Only rich people can afford to be this filthy&#34; 
Oliver Quick
        

The extreme hedonism of the wealthy is on full display throughout Saltburn, and the movie&#39;s attitude towards it is neatly summed up by this quote from Oliver. Made as a comment about the state of Felix&#39;s room at university, it draws a stark contrast between the two characters, while also providing a window into Oliver&#39;s true feelings about his new friend. Even though Oliver is clearly infatuated with Felix, this moment makes it clear that his attitude is more complex than straightforward devotion – explaining how he can behave so coldly as the movie continues.
            
 
 Saltburn Takes One Of The Best Actor Trends Of The Last 10 Years To A Whole New Level 
Emerald Fennel&#39;s Saltburn is certainly one of the year&#39;s most provocative movies. Part of its success lies in capitalizing on a great actor trend. 








 2  &#34;Bring on the slutty faeries&#34; 
Farleigh Start


 







The contrast between high and low culture is a key concern throughout Saltburn. Throughout the film, the Cattons are seen watching films like The Ring and enjoying karaoke, in contrast to the austere surroundings of the estate. The family&#39;s complicated relationship with notions of class are on full display in this hilarious one-liner from adopted family member Farleigh Start. A reference to Shakespeare&#39;s A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream, the quote lays bare how the Cattons represent the confluence of two worlds – one of low-brow smuttiness and indulgence, and another of more stereotypically impenetrable high culture. This combination makes them simultaneously beguiling and appalling – the attitude Oliver is continually wrestling with.





 1  &#34;She&#39;d do anything for attention&#34; 
Elspeth Catton
        

Perhaps the funniest and darkest line in the entire film, Elspeth&#39;s off-hand remark about her friend Pamela&#39;s death reveals just how detached the Cattons really are. Even though the family all but condemned her to her fate, kicking her out and leaving her at the mercy of her Russian lover, they are all remarkably unconcerned with what happened and their responsibility – especially Elspeth. This moment reveals how the family really feel about those they consider beneath them, which undoubtedly includes Oliver. While not justifying his later actions, it does suggest that the Cattons are much more than simple victims in Saltburn.
