## Literature Review

Two years after his cameo in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Sir Patrick Stewart addresses the problems with his Professor X cameo.




Sir Patrick Stewart breaks his silence on the issues he had with his Marvel Cinematic Universe cameo as Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. While the franchise for the original X-Men movies has been over for years, one of the prominent cast members of the film series who got a shot at reprising his role was Stewart, but with a twist. Even though he played Charles Xavier, Stewart portrayed an alternative variant of the iconic X-Men hero.




It has nearly been two years since Stewart&#39;s cameo in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, giving fans another chance to briefly enjoy Fox&#39;s X-Men era. During an appearance on Happy Sad Confused, Stewart talked about his experience working on Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness while sharing his frustrations with his Professor X cameo:


I was alone ... I think that the big scene, I think that each one of the leading actors had the same experience. They were shot on their own. It was frustrating and disappointing. That&#39;s how it&#39;s been. The last few years have been challenging.


                  Doctor Strange 2 Cast Guide: Every Marvel Character Who Appears   Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness sees the return of Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen &amp; a few other big surprise characters who appear.   


 Will Professor X Return To The MCU? 
         




Even though Professor X&#39;s brief MCU moment in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was disappointing to not just Stewart but also many audience members, the door is definitely not closed on future Xavier appearances. Given how The Multiverse Saga has continued to lean into the old X-Men franchise, most recently with The Marvels, featuring Kelsey Grammer&#39;s Beast, and 2024 will be a crucial year for the old Fox-Marvel movies. With Deadpool 3 bringing back Hugh Jackman&#39;s Wolverine, it would not be shocking if Xavier somehow shows up there too.

In fact, during the same interview, Stewart teased potential involvement with the Deadpool 3 movie. Since the MCU is rumored to go through a soft reboot with Phase 7 after The Multiverse Saga, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise if Stewart gets to play Professor X at least one or two more times before Avengers: Secret Wars changes the status quo for the franchise. That would be a more organic transition for a new actor to then take on the role of the MCU&#39;s main Professor X.






Marvel Studios reportedly began meeting with writers for the new X-Men movie reboot in late 2023.




Time will tell what other X-Men plans Marvel Studios have in mind for The Multiverse Saga when it comes to honoring the previous series of films based on the mutants. Deadpool 3 might give some more clues as to how much further they are planning to go with the old X-Men franchise. Until Stewart returns as Professor X, the world can relive Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness on Disney&#43;.
