The DC Universe has seen major upheaval in 2023, suggesting that 2024 will feature several vital announcements regarding the future of DC movies.

The official beginning of James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe is a little complicated considering some of the very first projects that will soon be released.













 








 10  Who Will Play The DCU&#39;s Batman 
The DCU&#39;s Batman Will Likely Debut In The Brave And The Bold
        

Numerous rumors have speculated on who will play Batman in the DCU reboot, who is due to star in the DCU&#39;s third movie - The Brave and the Bold. With the franchise&#39;s new Superman confirmed as David Corenswet, the actor that will portray the famed caped crusader is perhaps the most hotly anticipated announcement for Gunn&#39;s DCU reboot. As a key figure, Batman will presumably play a vital role in the franchise, and choosing the correct actor would belay any fears that they might not live up to the impressive precedent set by previous performances. Promptly announcing the DCU&#39;s new Batman will be essential in establishing the new franchise.





 9  Peacemaker Season 2&#39;s Release Date 
James Gunn Has Confirmed Peacemaker Season 2 Will Be Part Of The DCU


Close







One of the few facets of the DCEU that is transitioning into Gunn&#39;s DCU is Gunn&#39;s own Peacemaker series. The show released a single season in 2022, with a second season confirmed but delayed after Gunn was bestowed his new position with the DCU. As such, Peacemaker&#39;s future was relatively uncertain and seemingly awaited an appropriate place among the wider franchise. Gunn has confirmed the show will remain canon and that season 2 will follow the planned Waller series, suggesting that Peacemaker season 2 will not arrive any time soon, but a provisional release date will likely be announced in 2024.





 8  Jason Momoa’s Future Role In The DCU 
James Gunn Has Expressed Interest In Retaining Momoa In A New Role
        

Jason Momoa was celebrated for his performances as Aquaman, even if his solo movies were less highly regarded. Consequently, there was some disappointment following the announcement that Aquaman, along with the entire Justice League, would be recast in Gunn&#39;s DCU. However, there has been speculation that Momoa would be retained by Warner Bros. and could appear as a different character in the DCU reboot. Jason Momoa has since addressed rumors that he will portray the villain Lobo, with some indication that he could appear as soon as 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy, which would mean Momoa&#39;s new role in the DCU would be confirmed in 2024.





 7  How Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn Fits Into The DCU 
James Gunn Has Stated Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn Will Be Included In The DCU


Close







James Gunn previously confirmed Margot Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn would return after the success of his movie The Suicide Squad. Gunn was emphatically enthusiastic about keeping Robbie&#39;s acclaimed portrayal of the iconic antihero but has not commented on the issue since his DCU reboot was announced. Considering The Suicide Squad spawned John Cena&#39;s Peacemaker, which is confirmed as canon, there is a strong potential that Harley Quinn could also be carried over into the DCU. The general opinion seems to be that Gunn will confirm Robbie&#39;s place in the reboot after his plans for the DCU&#39;s Chapter 1 have been formalized, which should hopefully occur in 2024.





 6  A Release Schedule For The DCU Chapter 1 &#34;Gods And Monsters&#34; 
Only One Movie Has A Firm Release Date
        

Since James Gunn&#39;s DCU reboot was announced, a slew of upcoming movies and television series have been confirmed. However, only one movie, Superman: Legacy, has a firm release date (July 11, 2025). One television series, Creature Commandos, has been given an estimated release date of late 2024, with Waller expected shortly afterward. As Gunn&#39;s plans are slowly revealed, so too will the release schedule for the first chapter in the DCU reboot, &#34;Gods and Monsters.&#34; As seen with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the DCEU, release schedules for multiple movies tend to be released well in advance, so they will likely be announced very soon.





 5  If There Will Be A Joker 3 
The Second Joker Movie Was initially Unplanned


Close







Joker was initially intended as a standalone origin story for the iconic Batman villain. However, the movie proved so popular that a sequel was announced soon afterward. Joker: Folie à Deux will continue Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s revered performance as the Clown Prince of Crime, this time alongside Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn. Though this is also considered a singular event, the success of the sequel could prompt a further movie and establish a Joker trilogy.
Whether this will happen or not will likely be decided shortly after its theatrical release. This is pretty standard for superhero movies (and cinema in general), with Folie à Deux, for example, confirmed just one month after Joker. As Folie à Deux bears an October 2024 release date, a potential third movie would likely be confirmed by the end of 2024.





 4  Plot Details For The Batman - Part II 
The Batman Part 2 Has Released No Details In 2023
        

The Batman Part II is expected in October 2025, and thus far has not revealed any significant details regarding its plot or villains. Very little information is known about The Batman Part II, other than the state of Gotham City after The Batman and the presumed prominence of Colin Farrell&#39;s Penguin. Considering the 2025 release date, cast additions and a teaser trailer would likely appear sometime in 2024, with major promotion beginning early in 2025. Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman trilogy will continue alongside the DCU reboot, which will exist separately under the name &#34;DC Elseworlds.&#34; Announcements concerning The Batman Part II will, therefore, not become complicated by the DCU.





 3  If The Flash Really Reset The Universe 
Gunn Claimed The Flash Would Mark The Transition To The DCU
        

James Gunn suggested that The Flash would reset the DCEU as the DCU. Indeed, the narrative did lend itself to this possibility, effectively altering the universe&#39;s primary timeline for good. On the other hand, this new timeline included George Cooney as Batman, who definitely will not be playing the Caped Crusader in the DCU reboot. The notion that The Flash could mark the conclusion of the DCEU and the beginning of the DCU was suggested early in the DCU&#39;s development and did not consider that two further movies would be released within the DCEU. Gunn will hopefully elucidate on this in 2024 as more details of upcoming movies are released.





 2  Whether Blue Beetle Is DCU Canon 
Gunn Stated That Blue Beetle Could Be The First Movie In The DCU
        

Released after The Flash, Blue Beetle was considered a potential first movie for the DCU reboot. This was somewhat complicated by Aquaman and the Last Kingdom being released after and being confirmed as the last DCEU movie. However, Blue Beetle is largely unconnected from the previous movies and could, therefore, be considered DCU rather than DCEU. James Gunn previously suggested that Blue Beetle would be part of the DCU reboot but has thus far proffered no real details concerning its place in the pending shared universe. Designed as a DCEU movie, Blue Beetle does contain references to Metropolis and Superman, though these could readily serve to set up Superman: Legacy.





 1  Who Will Play The DCU&#39;s Supergirl 
Supergirl Will Appear In Superman: Legacy
        

Perhaps the most pressing announcement from the DCU is who will play the reboot&#39;s Supergirl. Rumors suggest that Supergirl will appear in 2025&#39;s Superman: Legacy, ahead of her solo movie, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow. Superman: Legacy is due to begin filming in 2024, so if the rumors are true, Supergirl will be cast soon. Whether through official channels or leaks, it is probable that the actor portraying the famed hero will be confirmed in 2024. Of course, rumors are not entirely reliable, and Supergirl could be kept as a surprise revealed in Superman: Legacy. Nevertheless, 2024 will prove a vital year for the superhero and the entire DC Universe.
   Key Release Dates             Joker: Folie a Deux Release Date: 2024-10-04                  Superman: Legacy Release Date: 2025-07-11                  The Batman - Part II Release Date: 2025-10-03
