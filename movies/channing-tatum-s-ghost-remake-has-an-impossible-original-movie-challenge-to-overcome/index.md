# Channing Tatum s Ghost Remake Has An Impossible Original Movie Challenge To Overcome


## SUMMARY 



  Channing Tatum&#39;s Ghost remake faces the challenge of replacing Patrick Swayze and finding the right balance between honoring the original and making its mark.   Remaking a classic movie like Ghost requires decisions on which key scenes to recreate or change, with the iconic pottery scene being a particularly difficult task.

## Literature Review

Channing Tatum is set to star in an upcoming remake of 1990&#39;s Ghost, but the movie has a very difficult decision to make regarding a key scene.




The upcoming Ghost remake with Channing Tatum doesn&#39;t just have the challenge of replacing Patrick Swayze, there&#39;s another tough call they&#39;ll have to make during the production process. Tatum already has some big shoes to fill by replacing Swayze in the movie&#39;s lead role, but that&#39;s only one of the challenges that needs to be overcome. Channing Tatum&#39;s Ghost remake needs to make its mark while honoring the original&#39;s legacy. However, that level of balance may be difficult to find with such a classic and beloved movie.




Ghost is one of the most iconic movies from 1990, with one scene in particular sticking out above the rest. Swayze shared the screen with other 90s legends in the original movie, including Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. Currently, there is no release date for the Ghost remake. As such, the creative team behind the endeavor has plenty of time to decide which parts of the original need tweaking.

 The Ghost Remake Will Need To Decide Whether To Recreate The Iconic Pottery Scene

One of the more intimidating aspects of remaking a classic movie is deciding how faithfully to recreate its key scenes. There&#39;s also the argument that they shouldn&#39;t be addressed at all in subsequent versions of the original. Channing Tatum&#39;s Ghost has already acknowledged that certain aspects of the movie will be changed, but the elements to which the actor was referring remain unclear. Speaking with Vanity Fair, Tatum mentioned his production company, Free Association, has the rights to Ghost, and that the movie will &#34;change a little bit&#34; in their hands.

At some point, a decision will need to be made regarding whether the inclusion of the Ghost pottery scene is among the &#34;changes&#34; in question. The sequence is a legendary cinematic moment, as well as the very heart of the movie itself. Recreating or adapting the scene for a remake is therefore a giant task, but Channing&#39;s team may need to attempt it to keep the fabric of the movie intact.



1984&#39;s Karate Kid underwent a similar overhaul for its 2010 remake with Jackie Chan. The famous &#34;Wax on, wax off&#34; scene was replaced by &#34;Jacket on, jacket off.&#34; In addition, the setting of the movie changed, as did the name of all its characters.






 Why The Ghost Remake Should Still Include The Righteous Brothers&#39; &#34;Unchained Melody&#34;

If the Tatum remake retains the pottery scene, the song that helped make the original Ghost so special also needs to remain in place. If the on-screen events were to take place without the Righteous Brothers&#39; track, it would feel hollow and incomplete. It&#39;s possible that a fresh take on the pottery scene could feature a newer version of &#34;Unchained Melody.&#34; However, the original is so intrinsically tied in with the story that it may be jarring to hear a different artist performing the song in the context of the movie. In short, Channing Tatum and his Free Association colleagues have a tough decision to make.



The original Ghost movie, starring Patrick Swayze, is available to stream on Max.
