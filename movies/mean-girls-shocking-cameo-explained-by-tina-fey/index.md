Summary

  Tina Fey explains the surprise cameo in Mean Girls (2024).   Mean Girls features a leading cast of Fey, Angourie Rice, Renee Rapp, Auli’i Cravalho, and Jaquel Spivey.   Fey chose the person she best felt captured the &#34;heart&#34; of 2004&#39;s Mean Girls when asked by Paramount to include a cameo in the film.  







Actor and screenwriter Tina Fey explains the major Mean Girls cameo that surprised audiences. The new musical is based on the 2004 classic comedy of the same name, which starred Lindsay Lohan, Rachel McAdams, and Amanda Seyfried. Like the original, the latest iteration follows the new student Cady Heron (Angourie Rice), who tries to climb up in social status at her high school while joining the elite group called The Plastics. The new movie features the leading cast of Fey, Rice, Renee Rapp, Auli’i Cravalho, and Jaquel Spivey.

Speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Fey explains Mean Girls&#39; shocking cameo. She said Paramount asked if she could “get any of the original ladies.” Fey chose Lohan as the best original cast member to make a cameo because she thought that she was the “heart of that movie.” Check out Fey&#39;s full quote below:


&#34;Paramount was like, &#39;Can you get any of the original ladies? And I was like, &#39;I can&#39;t fit five people in.’ I felt like if I could only get one person as a surprise, the original movie is really Lindsay&#39;s movie. As great as they all are, she&#39;s the heart of that movie. And I thought, well, what could she do? I didn&#39;t think [she should] play a teacher. I was trying to think of something that you wouldn&#39;t expect. And just to have her do that late in the movie, it also feels like it comes, I hope, at a time where fans weren&#39;t expecting one more little surprise. It also lets her be smart, which Cady is.&#34;






 Lindsay Lohan’s Mean Girls Legacy, Explained 
          

Ahead of the film’s debut, Lohan made a surprising appearance at the Mean Girls premiere, posed for pictures with former co-star Fey, and met the new Cady Heron actor, Rice. At the time, it was not confirmed that Lohan would appear in the movie. The former Cady actor eventually featured at the end of 2024&#39;s Mean Girls, portraying the moderator at the math competition. As a result, this makes Fey, Lohan, and Tim Meadows (who reprises his role of Principle Duvall) the only actors from the original movie to feature in the new iteration.

While Lohan has had a long acting career that started with 1998&#39;s The Parent Trap and continued with the 2003 remake Freaky Friday, her role of Cady remains one of her most iconic characters to date. Rather than being a titular “mean girl,” Cady is the character who is portrayed as the outsider trying to fit into her new school. The actor was only 18 years old when she acted in the high school comedy Mean Girls in 2004. Interestingly, her cameo comes at a time at which the original movie will celebrate its 20th anniversary.




                  Mean Girls 2024 Soundtrack Guide: Every Song &amp; When They Play In The Movie   Mean Girls 2024 is a musical adaptation of the 2004 movie. Here&#39;s every song on the Mean Girls soundtrack and when each plays in the movie.   

Lohan&#39;s recent cameo is not her first time appearing in anything related to Mean Girls. Late last year, she reprised her role of Cady in a Walmart commercial, which also featured other cast members from the 2004 movie. It revealed the character&#39;s life since those high school years, coincidentally showing her as the new principal. This comes as many cast members from the original movie have called for a sequel, but the idea has yet to happen. Nevertheless, Lohan&#39;s appearance in 2024&#39;s Mean Girls makes up for that and exemplifies her legacy in the classic teen comedy.
