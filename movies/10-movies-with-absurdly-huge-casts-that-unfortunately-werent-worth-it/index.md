# 10 Movies With Absurdly Huge Casts That Unfortunately Werent Worth It


## SUMMARY 


 Huge casts can make a movie immersive and believable, but they can also draw focus away from the main characters and harm the plot. 
 Just because a movie has a star-studded cast doesn&#39;t mean it will be good. Some movies with large ensembles end up being disappointing and weighed down by too many characters. 
 Even with a talented cast, a movie can still fail to live up to its potential. Examples like &#34;Eternals&#34; and &#34;Cats&#34; show that a stellar cast isn&#39;t always enough to save a film.

## Literature Review

Movies with huge ensemble casts can be incredibly immersive, but they can just as easily be bloated messes which lack a clarity of purpose.




Handling a massive ensemble cast isn&#39;t an easy task for any director, and some movies could have benefited from simplifying things and focusing on fewer characters. When done well, movies with huge casts can be incredibly immersive, portraying a detailed world filled with believable characters. To name just two recent examples, Oppenheimer and Barbie both succeeded with this formula. They each featured huge casts, but they maintained a sharp focus on their core protagonists. Problems often arise when a huge cast draws focus from the main characters, and the plot suffers as a result.
Huge casts can be a great box office draw, since audiences are keen to see so many great actors all working together. Unfortunately, the reality doesn&#39;t always live up to expectations. There are just as many bad examples of large ensemble casts as there are good ones. Often, there is something about the movie which could have been great, if only the cast could have been trimmed down a little. Plenty of these movies aren&#39;t necessarily bad, but their enormous casts weigh them down and spread the focus too thin. Big ensemble casts are a dangerous ingredient for a movie, and they can sometimes ruin a good idea.









 








 10  Les Misérables (2012) 
Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham-Carter, Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Samantha Banks, and many more.


 







Based on the theatrical adaptation of Victor Hugo&#39;s epic novel, Les Misérables attempts to tell the story of a violent popular revolution, a love story, and a decades-long feud. While its ambition and visual design are both admirable, Les Misérables sometimes fails to hit the rousing highs of the stage musical. Hugh Jackman is a seasoned musical star, and Anne Hathaway is also outstanding, but some other performances leave a lot to be desired. Les Misérables has more show-stopping numbers than most musicals could ever dream of, and the casting for Tom Hooper&#39;s 2012 movie doesn&#39;t often do them justice.

 9  Cats (2019) 
Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swift, Rebel Wilson, Idris Elba, James Corden, and many more.


 







While Les Misérables is still well-respected in spite of a few minor drawbacks, one of Tom Hooper&#39;s other musical movies was both a critical and financial failure. From the moment the first images were released, Cats looked like a disturbing fever dream. The cast boasts some serious musical talent, including Taylor Swift and Jason Derulo, but audiences&#39; worst fears were confirmed. The disturbing visuals are one of the most immediate problems, with the CGI character design turning fans away. Cats has gained some fans after the initial shock has subsided, but a movie with such a stellar cast should aspire to much more than so-bad-it&#39;s-good status.





 8  The Expendables (2010) 
Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Bruce Willis, Terry Crews, and many more.
        

The end product didn&#39;t quite live up to the explosive standards of its stars 

The original announcement for The Expendables resembled a fantasy draft of iconic action heroes. The throwback action franchise features some of the biggest action stars of all time finally teaming up after years of competing at the box office. Unfortunately, the end product didn&#39;t quite live up to the explosive standards of its stars. The Expendables wants to conjure The Terminator, Rambo, Die Hard, and other action classics, but this means that it&#39;s derivative in nature. When action stars have left The Expendables franchise, they have been replaced by other heavy-hitters like Chuck Norris and Wesley Snipes, but the result is always the same.





 7  Eternals (2021) 
Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington, Gemma Chan, Barry Keoghan, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, and many more.
        

Marvel have produced a number of great movies with huge ensemble casts, especially the Avengers movies, but their winning formula was poorly misused with Eternals. The cast of Eternals boasts an impressive mix of Hollywood legends and fresh, exciting talent. Even with an overly long runtime, Eternals struggles to introduce so many new characters into the MCU, and the pacing is hampered by excessive flashbacks. The other problem is the obligatory inclusion of a set number of eye-popping CGI-heavy action sequences, which disrupt any kind of emotional storytelling director Chloé Zhao attempts to get going. Eternals is a rare disappointment for the box office behemoth of Marvel.





 6  Suicide Squad (2016) 
Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, Will Smith, Viola Davis, Cara Delevigne, Joel Kinnaman, Scott Eastwood, and many more.
        

Just like Eternals, Suicide Squad proves that superhero movies need more than a star-studded cast and some poppy fight scenes to succeed. The DC antihero crossover failed to win over audiences, and James Gunn even rebooted Suicide Squad a few short years later by adding the prefix &#34;The&#34; to the title and bringing in a new raft of misfits. A few characters from the original remained, including Margot Robbie&#39;s Harley Quinn, but Jared Leto&#39;s Joker was gone. Suicide Squad&#39;s portrayal of the Joker was widely panned, not just because of Leto&#39;s interpretation, but also because of the character&#39;s visual design.





 5  Don&#39;t Look Up (2021) 
Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Jonah Hill, Mark Rylance, Meryl Streep, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry, Cate Blanchett, Ariana Grande, and many more.


 







Adam McKay&#39;s apocalyptic allegory satirizes political and media indifference to the ongoing climate crisis, and it attempts to draw a broad cross-section of society. This requires a large cast, and McKay fills each role with big-name talent. Don&#39;t Look Up proved divisive in its approach to climate change. Its satire can come across as self-satisfied and heavy-handed, but if Don&#39;t Look Up sparks conversations about society&#39;s approach to the environment, then McKay is achieving at least part of his aim. Despite the controversy, Don&#39;t Look Up was a huge streaming success, and it remains one of Netflix&#39;s most popular movies.





 4  Wet Hot American Summer (2001) 
Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, Christopher Meloni, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Molly Shannon, and many more.
        

Wet Hot American Summer is a critically-panned parody of teen comedies, but it still gained a cult following. This is partly due to the success that the movie&#39;s stars enjoyed later in their careers, which helped to cast Wet Hot American Summer in a more sympathetic light. Initial reception to the movie did not indicate that it would be revived for a Netflix series over a decade later, but Wet Hot American Summer was much funnier the second time around, proving that the cast just needed the right conditions in order to thrive. Many of the actors returned to play characters who were much younger than them by then.





 3  The Dead Don&#39;t Die (2019) 
Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, Tilda Swinton, Tom Waits, Danny Glover, Iggy Pop, Selena Gomez, Austin Butler, and many more.
        

Somewhere in the muddle of Jim Jarmusch&#39;s The Dead Don&#39;t Die, there is the kernel of a potentially great movie trying to get out. 

Somewhere in the muddle of Jim Jarmusch&#39;s The Dead Don&#39;t Die, there is the kernel of a potentially great movie trying to get out. The trio of Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Chloë Sevigny are excellent as a team of mild-mannered police officers in a small town facing supernatural danger. The zombie gore-fest isn&#39;t too much of a distraction, but the movie&#39;s tiresome meta-commentary isn&#39;t as interesting as it thinks it is. Zombie horror movies often have huge casts so that plenty of the characters can be picked off and eaten, but there will still be enough left behind to carry on the story.





 2  Amsterdam (2022) 
Christian Bale, Margot Robbie, John David Washington, Chris Rock, Anya Taylor-Joy, Taylor Swift, Robert De Niro, Mike Myers, Michael Shannon, Rami Malek, and many more.
        

Amsterdam tells the meandering story of three friends who reunite to investigate a suspicious death. The conspiracy is confusing enough by itself, but the addition of an absurdly large supporting cast and some strangely timed flashback sequences make everything even more obscure. Amsterdam isn&#39;t straightforward enough to be a compelling mystery, and it isn&#39;t calculated enough to be a farcical comedy. Although the warm glow of its 1930s setting is stylish and inviting, Amsterdam&#39;s characters don&#39;t often appear to be reading from the same script. Christian Bale borders on caricature, and John David Washington occupies the other end of the spectrum, mostly stone-faced and still.





 1  Movie 43 (2013) 
Kate Winslet, Hugh Jackman, Emma Stone, Chris Pratt, Jason Sudeikis, Richard Gere, Uma Thurman, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Kristen Bell, Elizabet Banks, Johnny Knoxville, and many more.
        

Movie 43 was the brainchild of the producer Charles B. Wessler, who channeled his own experiences into a story about a washed-up Hollywood producer who pitches a number of increasingly bizarre comedy movies in an attempt to stage a career comeback. The comedy anthology features some outstanding comedic talents, but the sketches don&#39;t work either in isolation or as part of a cohesive whole. Movie 43 is a movie about bad movies which no studio would ever make. It could have been a metatextual commentary on the movie industry, but the huge number of creative talents never aligned to a single vision.
