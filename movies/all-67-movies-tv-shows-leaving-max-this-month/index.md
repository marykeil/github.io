## Literature Review



The streaming service Max offers a vast content library of TV shows and movies, as well as original programming, and in January, like every month, the service is losing some of its offerings. Max includes content from several brands, such as HBO, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, DC, and Max Originals. After the April 2022 merger between WarnerMedia and Discovery, Inc., the streaming service was relaunched as Max on May 23, 2023.




Every month, Max brings on new movies and TV shows to add to its content library, and every month, some are taken away. In January 2024, movies and TV shows are disappearing from Max in a slow trickle before the last day of the month when nearly 60 titles will be removed. Often, Max removes movies in a franchise or series at the same time, but there are also plenty of standalone movies that will disappear soon as well. The clock is ticking on certain TV and movie titles and those interested should sign on in order not to miss anything.
