## Literature Review

The heroes of the Justice League have many memorable lines in the DCEU - we rundown each hero&#39;s first and last line of dialogue in the DCEU.




The first and last lines of dialogue of each Justice League member illustrate elements of their respective arcs in the DCEU. Beginning its story with Man of Steel in 2013, the DCEU&#39;s eventual formation of the Justice League has a very unusual history, with 2017&#39;s Justice League being an extensively reworked version of the film after Zack Snyder&#39;s departure from the project. Snyder&#39;s subsequent return led to it being finished and released as Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League in 2021, but the DCEU ended in 2023 with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.
Next, DC Studios is set to kick off a new cinematic franchise in the DC Universe, though what role the Justice League will play in the DCU - if any - still remains unclear. Meanwhile, the individual journeys of each Justice League member in the DCEU are curiously encapsulated in different ways in their first and last lines of spoken dialogue. Here are the first and last lines of each Justice League hero in the DCEU, and their larger meaning.

 7  Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman 
First Line - Man of Steel; Last Line - Black Adam


 







Clark Kent&#39;s first line in the DCEU is heard in a flashback to his childhood in Man of Steel, with the young Clark (Cooper Timberline) overwhelmed by his super-hearing and X-ray powers and telling his mother Martha (Diane Lane), &#34;The world&#39;s too big Mom.&#34; While Clark is referring to his lack of control over his powers, in a larger sense, it speaks to the young Kryptonian feeling isolated, confused, and alone in a world he does not understand. with powers he cannot control. Ultimately, through his discovery of his Kryptonian heritage, Clark manages to finally find his place in the world as Superman (Henry Cavill).
Superman&#39;s last DCEU appearance is seen in his end-credits cameo in Black Adam, with the Man of Steel arriving at Kahndaq and saying to Dwayne Johnson&#39;s Black Adam, &#34;It&#39;s been a while since anyone&#39;s made the world this nervous. Black Adam, we should talk.&#34; While serving as a clear set-up for The Rock&#39;s intended Superman-Black Adam battle royale, the line itself is a major callback to the world&#39;s once polarized view of Superman in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Here, Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman makes an effort to extend Black Adam the benefit of the doubt, while recognizing that the more violent Kahndaqi anti-hero does need to be kept in check.





 6  Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman 
First Line - Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Last Line - The Flash
        

 Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice opens with Ben Affleck&#39;s Bruce Wayne narrating over the funeral of his parents, with the Dark Knight intoning, &#34;There was a time above, a time before. There were perfect things, diamond absolutes. How things fall. Things on Earth, and what falls is fallen.&#34; In his first line in the DCEU, Affleck&#39;s Batman reminisces over the life he once had as a child with his loving parents and the destruction of his world after their murder being the &#34;fall&#34; he refers to. In turn, this gives way to his &#34;rise&#34; years later as Batman.
The last DCEU appearance of Ben Affleck&#39;s Batman occurs in The Flash, with his final scene in the movie seeing him warning Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) about the dangers of traveling into the past to prevent his mother&#39;s murder. When Barry asks Bruce if he&#39;d like to get something to eat, Bruce replies &#34;No, not this time. Maybe some other time,&#34; before departing. This is an oddly meta line that could be read as referencing Affleck&#39;s notorious departure and return as Batman due to the DCEU&#39;s behind-the-scenes issues, referring both to Bruce Wayne&#39;s own mercurial nature and Affleck&#39;s willingness to only return as Batman on his own terms.
Before his tenure as Batman, Ben Affleck previously played Matt Murdock in the 2003 Marvel superhero movie Daredevil.

 5  Gal Gadot&#39;s Wonder Woman 
First Line - Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Last Line - The Flash


 







In her first DCEU appearance in Batman v Superman, Gal Gadot&#39;s Wonder Woman says her first line when Bruce Wayne confronts her at a museum for her theft of his encryption device containing some of Lex Luthor&#39;s top secret files. Responding to Bruce&#39;s observation that the alleged Sword of Alexander on display is a fake, Diana replies that the real sword hangs &#34;over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.&#34; This line alludes to Diana&#39;s extended lifespan as an Amazon and a demi-goddess, exemplifying that her knowledge of history and other cultures is far more vast than even the most learned human history.
Wonder Woman&#39;s last DECU appearance is seen in her cameo in The Flash during her meeting with Batman and The Flash on a bridge after the movie&#39;s opening chase scene. After aiding Bruce and Barry, Diana remarks, &#34;Well, I have to run. Always a pleasure.&#34; This line says a lot about how far Diana has come in her journey, having once kept herself largely hidden from the world only to become a public heroine in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League. Wonder Woman remains somewhat fickle, but thanks to her relationship with the Justice League, she no longer feels the need to do so alone.
Gal Gadot was originally considered for the role of Faora-Ul in Man of Steel, but chose to decline since she was pregnant at the time of filming. 






 4  Jason Momoa&#39;s Aquaman 
First Line - Justice League/Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League; Last Line - Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom
        

Following his non-speaking cameo in Batman v Superman, Jason Momoa&#39;s first line in the DCEU is somewhat complicated by the release of the theatrical cut of Justice League and the later release of Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League. His first line in the former is to Bruce Wayne, &#34;Icebergs in the harbor, four months since the last ship got through.&#34; It doesn&#39;t say much about his character, but his first line in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League of &#34;Talk&#34; is much more revealing. In the latter, Arthur&#39;s personality as a wanderer and a loner is more clearly represented. While keeping Bruce Wayne at arm&#39;s length, Arthur is nonetheless willing to hear a stranger out.
In his last line in the DCEU in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Arthur addresses the United Nations, revealing the existence of Atlantis to the surface world, vowing to help the surface dwellers combat climate change, and declaring, &#34;I&#39;m the King of Atlantis. I am Aquaman,&#34; before letting out an enthusiastic, Momoa-style shout. In this line, Arthur demonstrates that he fully embraces his Atlantean heritage and role as the King of Atlantis that he once did everything he could to avoid. Additionally, Arthur&#39;s triumphant yell after his speech shows how much Arthur has lightened up into a fun-loving superhero and Atlantean king since joining the Justice League.

 3  Ezra Miller&#39;s The Flash 
First Line - Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Last Line - The Flash


 







 The Scarlet Speedster&#39;s chronological DCEU debut comes in Batman v Superman, when Ezra Miller&#39;s Flash visits Bruce from the Knightmare future to warn &#34;Bruce! Listen to me now! It&#39;s Lois, it&#39;s Lois Lane. She&#39;s the key!&#34; While this line sets up the Knightmare and Snyder&#39;s intended Justice League sequels, Barry&#39;s first line in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League of &#34;Am I late? I am so late?&#34; while heading into a job interview speaks to the dichotomy of Barry&#39;s powers and personality. The Flash may be The Fastest Man Alive, but he&#39;s frequently more absent-minded and tardy in matters pertaining to his personal life.
The Flash&#39;s last DCEU line is heard in the end-credits scene of The Flash as Barry walks out of a bar with a very inebriated Aquaman, telling Aquaman, &#34;Yep, you&#39;re sailor,&#34; and whispering, &#34;He&#39;s fine,&#34; while running to his apartment to grab Arthur some more beer. This line speaks to Barry as both the comic relief and the youngest member of the Justice League aside from Ray Fisher&#39;s Cyborg. Even with Aquaman face-planting into a puddle while drunk and singing about being a sailor, Barry can offer both humor and some dry observation of an awkward situation.





 2  Ray Fisher&#39;s Cyborg 
First Line - Justice League/Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League; Last Line - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League
        

Ray Fisher&#39;s Cyborg is a supporting player at best in the theatrical cut of Justice League, with his first line in the movie, &#34;I&#39;m processing. I can access everything,&#34; referencing his newfound technological powers. By contrast, his first line in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, as the vastly more in-sync follow-up to Batman v Superman, is much deeper. Replying to his father Silas (Joe Morton) referring to Parademons as monsters, Cyborg replies, &#34;You know a lot about monsters, especially how to make them.&#34; This line establishes Victor Stone&#39;s anger at his father and the horror Victor feels at the cybernetic man he&#39;s become, setting up Victor&#39;s eventual acceptance of himself.
Cyborg&#39;s last DCEU line is also heard in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, specifically in Snyder&#39;s Knightmare epilogue when Henry Cavill&#39;s Superman arrives to battle the remaining members of the Justice League, with Superman being under Darkseid&#39;s control via the Anti-Life Equation. Cyborg ominously intones, &#34;He&#39;s found us,&#34; just before Superman lands, which alludes to Snyder&#39;s intended plans for Justice League 2 and Justice League 3. In this post-apocalyptic future, even Superman himself has gone from hero to unwilling villain, showing the stakes of the League&#39;s battle with Darkseid, the horror of Superman being weaponized and how important the mission to save Superman and the world from Darkseid is.

Victor Stone comes to accept his life as Cyborg in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, and the scene of him repairing the Flying Fox is a key part of that.








 1  Harry Lennix&#39;s Martian Manhunter 
First Line - Man of Steel; Last Line - Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League
        

J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz a.k.a. Martian Manhunter spends the entirety of his role in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman disguised as General Calvin Swanwick. In his first scene in Man of Steel, Swanwick&#39;s first line of &#34;What am I looking at Doc?&#34; to Doctor Emil Hamilton (Richard Schiff) comes as General Zod&#39;s ship is nearing Earth. On the surface, Swanwick&#39;s line is a simple question for Hamilton to fill him in on the situation. However, it retroactively can be viewed as Swanwick covertly requesting information that impacts him directly, with the disguised Martian wanting to be prepared as more aliens like him are about to arrive on Earth.
Swanwick is later revealed to be Martian Manhunter in Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League, with the Martian hero arriving at Bruce Wayne&#39;s lake house to warn of Darkseid&#39;s coming attack and join the Justice League to stop him. Martian Manhuter&#39;s last DCEU line comes as the scene ends, with J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz stating, &#34;Well, I&#39;ll be in touch. Oh, and some have called me the Martian Manhunter.&#34; In this line, Martian Manhunter makes clear that the Justice League have inspired him to come out of hiding to protect Earth, with the Martian immigrant being fully comfortable in revealing himself to a fellow hero like Batman.
