## Literature Review

The Oscars 2024 Best Actor race has several strong contenders hoping to get nominations in January, but only one of them will be crowned the winner.




The Best Actor race for the Oscars 2024 looks to be among the most competitive categories at the Academy Awards this season, with several major stars vying for the coveted award. The pool of movies from 2023 has undoubtedly delivered a handful of incredibly memorable acting performances. Audiences have witnessed incredible showings from former nominees and Best Actor Oscar winners, as well as breakout roles for longtime actors and newcomers. They all are now hoping to contend for the award that went to Brendan Fraser for The Whale at the 2023 Oscars, which marked his first-ever Oscar win.
The frontrunners for the Best Actor have held that status for quite some time thanks to their association with the most likely Oscars 2024 Best Picture nominees. But, the campaigning that happens during awards season is only just beginning. This first comes for the hopes of earning a Best Actor Oscar nomination, as there are only five nominations available - or even fewer if the proverbial favorites are, indeed, locks. With that in mind, this list of the 2024 Oscars&#39; Best Actor nominations and predicted winner will be updated as the January 2024 nominations announcement date approaches. Screen Rant&#39;s predicted Best Actor nominees are:
    Actor   Movie    1   Cillian Murphy   Oppenheimer    2   Bradley Cooper   Maestro    3   Paul Giamatti   The Holdovers    4   Leonardo DiCaprio   Killers of the Flower Moon    5   Colman Domingo   Rustin    
The five nominees have stayed the same, with Giamatti and DiCaprio swapping spots 

While these five actors might be the strongest contenders to receive a Best Actor nomination from the Academy Awards voting body in early 2024, they are far from the only ones chasing a nomination. Several other performances are worthy of receiving the nomination and could ultimately do so if reviews remain positive and the right narrative is built around their campaign. Other potential actors who could be nominated in the 2024 Oscars include:
  Actor   Movie    Andrew Scott   All of Us Strangers    Adam Driver   Ferrari    Jeffrey Wright   American Fiction    Zac Efron   The Iron Claw    Joaquin Phoenix   Napoleon    Nicolas Cage   Dream Scenario    Anthony Hopkins   Freud&#39;s Last Session    Christian Friedel   The Zone of Interest    Koji Yakusho   Perfect Days    Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal   Cassandro    Michael Fassbender   The Killer    Barry Keoghan   Saltburn    Paul Dano   Dumb Money    Teo Yoo   Past Lives    Matt Damon   Air    









 








 5  Colman Domingo in Rustin 
Role: Bayard Rustin
        

Colman Domingo has emerged as a strong contender to secure a Best Actor nomination for the 2024 Oscars thanks to his work in Rustin. Netflix&#39;s biographical film about Bayard Rustin, the gay Civil Rights activist who helped orchestrate the 1963 March on Washington, gives Domingo a powerful role to play. The buzz for the movie has been great ever since it debuted at the Telluride Film Festival, and the praise for Domingo&#39;s performance, in particular, has grown since then. The attention has turned more to his favor now that Rustin has been released on Netflix, bringing more eyes to his tremendous work.
            
 
 Oscars 2024: Predictions For All 23 Categories 
The Oscars 2024 race is well underway, with the likes of Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Barbie hoping to win big at the Academy Awards.



This would be Colman Domingo&#39;s first Oscar nomination of his career. He&#39;s come close before, such as with Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom, but his supporting work there was not awarded. Now that he&#39;s reunited with director George C. Wolfe and is in the starring role, all eyes have turned to Domingo, and the Academy very well might nominate him now. The 2024 Golden Globes nominated him after all for Rustin. If it happens, Domingo could attempt to make history, as only six Black actors have ever won the Best Actor Oscar.





 4  Leonardo DiCaprio in Killers of the Flower Moon 
Role: Ernest Burkhart
        

It should come as little surprise that Leonardo DiCaprio is viewed as one of the frontrunners for a Best Actor nomination thanks to his work in Killers of the Flower Moon. His role as Ernest Burkhart allowed him to deliver another memorable performance where he had to try and make a character doing despicable acts at least slightly sympathetic to audiences. Martin Scorsese&#39;s movie is viewed as a strong contender for Oscar nominations across the board, as DiCaprio likely will not be the only Killers of the Flower Moon performance nominated for an award.
This would be Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s sixth Oscar nomination in his career, making him the 12th actor to achieve at least that many Best Actor nominations. Such a nomination would give DiCaprio a shot to win his second Best Actor Oscar, following up his first win for 2018&#39;s The Revenant. If he accomplishes that feat, he&#39;ll be the ninth actor to have won the award twice. Despite the acclaim of his role initially, he has lost some steam in the race at this point, it appears, thanks to other performances rising to the top, even though he got a Golden Globe nomination.
Daniel Day-Lewis is the only person to win the Best Actor Oscar three times 






 3  Paul Giamatti in The Holdovers 
Role: Paul Hunman
        

Paul Giamatti is seemingly closing in on a locked-in status for an Oscar nomination in 2024. His role in Alexander Payne&#39;s The Holdovers has all the makings of one of the feel-good stories of awards season. The veteran of Hollywood was suddenly launched into contending status upon The Holdovers&#39; debut at Telluride Film Festival and subsequent screenings of the movie have only brought more praise for the movie overall, but also more specifically for Giamatti&#39;s performance.
If Paul Giamatti is nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for The Holdovers, it would mark his second nomination from the Academy, but the first in this category. He previously received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2006 for Cinderella Man. While he lost that award to George Clooney in Syriana, Giamatti could now look to finally win an Oscar by re-teaming with Alexander Payne. Their prior collaboration, Sideways, won a screenplay Oscar even though Giamatti was not individually nominated for his performance. With a Golden Globe nomination secured and recognition from the National Board of Review, Giamatti is gaining momentum.





 2  Bradley Cooper in Maestro 
Role: Leonard Bernstein
        

Bradley Cooper has once again found himself in the thick of a Best Actor race at the Oscars. Not only is he a potential candidate to be nominated for his directorial work with Maestro, but his performance as legendary composer Leonard Bernstein has also garnered celebration. This started when Maestro debuted at the Venice International Film Festival and reviews began to affirm the great acting Bradley Cooper displayed. The biggest obstacle for him in receiving a nomination at this point might be the controversy surrounding Bradley Cooper&#39;s Maestro appearance, so voters will have to overlook the criticism.
A Best Actor nomination for Bradley Cooper would continue a great run of success in the category over the last decade. He received his first nomination in 2013 for Silver Linings Playbook and received another nomination two years later for American Sniper, which came a year after a Best Supporting Actor nomination for American Hustle. While he was thought of as a frontrunner for the victory in 2019 with A Star Is Born, he fell short of winning the award. His Golden Globe-nominated turn in Maestro presents another opportunity for the Academy to reward Bradley Cooper&#39;s several memorable performances at last.





 1  Cillian Murphy in Oppenheimer (Winner) 
Role: J. Robert Oppenheimer


 







The current predicted winner of the Best Actor Academy Award at the 2024 Oscars is Cillian Murphy. He starred as J. Robert Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer. Although the duo worked together several times before, this was Murphy&#39;s first starring role in a Nolan movie. He delivered the strongest performance of his career by playing the brilliant and tormented scientist. Bringing all the layers to Oppenheimer&#39;s life and Murphy&#39;s ability to show him at his best and his worst helped define one of the best performances of 2023 and the won deserving of winning the Oscar.
Cillian Murphy&#39;s Oscar nomination for Oppenheimer would be a first in his career. He has received praise for his previous works, but none of them have come from the Academy Awards. Cillian Murphy would be the third consecutive first-time Best Actor winner, following Will Smith and Brendan Fraser, and the second straight first-time nominee who won the award. After also earning a Golden Globe nomination, Cillian Murphy needs to continue a strong campaign and pick up momentum to hold off Bradley Cooper and Paul Giamatti in the Best Actor Oscars 2024 race.
