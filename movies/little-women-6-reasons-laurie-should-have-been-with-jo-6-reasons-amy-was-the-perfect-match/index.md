## Literature Review



Louisa May Alcott&#39;s classic novel about the four March sisters, Little Women, has inspired readers since it was first published in 1868. It also inspired many directors to create their film representations of the classic story. In 2019, audiences received Greta Gerwig&#39;s version of the story. Previously, in 1994, many fell in love with Gillian Armstrong&#39;s version. Still, others remember older versions where Katharine Hepburn played Jo (1933) or when Elizabeth Taylor played Amy (1949). Most of the story centers on Jo following her dreams to become a writer, but the bonds between the sisters, and their romantic relationships, also help propel the story forward. While the versions of Little Women have somewhat changed the plot or the character arcs, one element of the plot that has stayed constant is the love triangle between Jo, Laurie, and Amy.

Jo and Amy are the two March siblings who are most different from one another. The two things they have in common are their love for their family and their love for their neighbor Laurie. The love they feel for him is a little different though. Jo and Laurie have been best friends, and Jo balks when he proposes to her, professing his love and wanting to make their friendship into a romance. Rejected, Laurie leaves, and later marries Amy, Jo&#39;s little sister, who nursed a crush on him throughout her childhood. While Laurie might have initially thought he wanted to spend his life with Jo, he did grow to love Amy, leaving fans of the book and the movie adaptation debating who his perfect match was for years.



Little Women (1994) is available to stream on PlutoTV while Little Women (2019) is available to stream on Starz.








 Laurie And Jo Should Have Been Together 
Jo Had An Instant Connection To Laurie
   Close     

No matter which version of Little Women is examined, one thing remains true about the bond between Jo and Laurie: it happened immediately. Jo and Laurie met at a party that Jo only attended to accompany Meg. She might have had little use for making society appearances, but Meg adored it.

Laurie, for his part, was uninterested in the events of the evening until he met Jo. They bonded by talking about everyone else there and hiding the scorch marks on Jo&#39;s dress. Their connection was instantaneous and didn&#39;t waver until Laurie told Jo how he feels much later in life. It was Jo who introduced him to the rest of the family, and he didn&#39;t have the same bonding experience with everyone else, not even Amy.

Jo Admired Laurie Without Idolizing Him
          




Jo thought the best of Laurie, even encouraging her sisters to let him into their theatre group and to be an active member of it. She always thought the best of him and welcomed him to be part of her family, her inner sphere.

However, unlike Amy, she never idolized him. Laurie was as human as she was, and they&#39;d bicker. It made them real. He wouldn&#39;t have to live up to extremely high expectations with Jo. She&#39;d accept him as he was.

The Fans Wanted Jo And Laurie Together
          

It&#39;s said that when Alcott wrote the book in two volumes, fans really wanted Jo and Laurie to end up together. Even by modern conventional romantic-comedy standards, the structure makes sense. Two friends who grew up together discover that they love each other. Movie fans see this in films like Always Be My Maybe (2019). Or one friend harbors romantic feelings for the other, and it takes time for the other friend to realize that they feel the same like in Made of Honor (2008).




It&#39;s a classic romantic story structure, and it provides both conflict and resolution. It could be that Laurie and Amy ending up together feels unsettling because their partnership isn&#39;t the standard structure of conflict and resolution; it&#39;s more open-ended than that.

Jo Pushes Laurie to Do More with His Music
   Close     

While this aspect of Laurie isn&#39;t focused on as much in the 2019 version, Laurie is the son of a musician. He is also talented, though not always as driven as Jo. Jo encourages him to continue his craft.

This is something that Amy wouldn&#39;t do because it may make for a more unstable future. She&#39;d encourage him to follow his family&#39;s practical pursuits, rather than music.

Jo Has Been Laurie&#39;s Romantic Interest for Years
          




In all Little Women film versions and the book, Laurie tells Jo that he&#39;s been in love with her for a long time. His affection for her didn&#39;t occur suddenly; it manifested throughout their friendship. Because he&#39;s enamored with her, he becomes enamored with her family. In the 1994 film, Laurie tells Amy that he&#39;d be jealous of any suitor that the March sisters had because he wants to be a part of the March family.

This and the sudden relationship he has with Amy does make Amy seem second fiddle to Jo. Additionally, Jo was always the March family member that he was closest to, a bond that the audience sees even with the name that Jo calls him, &#34;Teddy.&#34;

Jo Is Laurie&#39;s Best Friend
          

Jo and Laurie have been best friends all the time that they have known each other. They joke together, they jab at each other, and they support each other. They know each other, and they know each other well. They both enjoy one another&#39;s company, and they prefer it over other people&#39;s.




Since their friendship has been so solid, a romance built upon it could be just as solid. Additionally, Jo encourages Laurie to be playful, and they have a lot of fun together, laughing and joking around.



 Amy And Laurie Were A Perfect Match Because 
Amy Got Laurie To Grow Up And Face His Feelings
          

If there&#39;s one place where Amy and Jo differ in their approach to Laurie, it&#39;s in facing their feelings - and getting him to face his own. Jo wanted to pretend that there were no romantic feelings between them. In every version, she has begged him not to say anything when he starts to tell her how he feels. Jo also then, in every version, has avoided him, allowing Laurie to wallow in his misery instead of facing the rejection.

Amy, on the other hand, was not going to put up with that. When she met up with him again in Europe, she chastised his attitude, his treatment of others, and, naturally, his treatment of her. There has never been avoidance in Amy&#39;s character, and her tendency to dive headfirst into situations meant that Laurie had to meet her in the deep end.




Amy Never Thought of Him Platonically
   Close     

Now, this depends on which version of Little Women a fan sees. It&#39;s suggested that Amy always thought of Laurie as a potential romance though. When she&#39;s sent away when Beth is sick with scarlet fever, young Amy fears that she could die and worries that she&#39;ll do so without being kissed.

Laurie jokingly, but sincerely, swears to her that he would give her a kiss before she dies. Amy longs for Laurie, and although he is her friend, in her mind, he could be so much more.

Alcott Chose To Pair Laurie And Amy
          

Laurie ended up with Amy because Alcott decided to make Amy Laurie&#39;s romantic partner. It could&#39;ve been the way that Alcott, often a writer of more scandalous stories, wanted to bring in a little scandal to this otherwise moral story.




Additionally, while Laurie loves Jo, he doesn&#39;t quite understand what is most important to her -- her writing. He doesn&#39;t take that aspect of her that seriously. In one film version, he actually tells her that she doesn&#39;t have to write once since he marries him unless she wants to do so. Of course, Jo has to write because it&#39;s who she is, which could lead us to think that Jo&#39;s creativity may have been stifled if she had married Laurie.

Amy Is More Pragmatic Than Jo
   Close     

Even though Amy may not encourage his music, in other ways, Amy&#39;s logical thinking could help Laurie. She&#39;s like the ground in the relationship. Laurie can be a little wild like Jo, and he may need someone to hold him stable and accountable from time to time.

In the 2019 film version, Amy fulfills this role even more than she did in previous versions. Amy can chide and call Laurie out, and it could be that he needs that.

Amy Is Diplomatic and Can Fit Into Laurie&#39;s World Easily
          

Amy can cross social statuses more easily than Jo. She understands how to be diplomatic, but not walked over. When Jo worked for Aunt March, she didn&#39;t adapt or temper her feelings. Amy was able to thrive with Aunt March. In the film version, this relationship means that Amy gets more opportunities, like traveling to Europe to do art or help in arranging a wealthy suitor match. Also, she understands how to present herself, dressing in a way that may suggest more wealth than her family has.

This is not to say that Amy becomes someone else or feels ashamed of her background, but rather that she understands how to present it and how each situation may require her to adapt just a little. Jo wouldn&#39;t have had this attention to detail, and she wouldn&#39;t have liked having to hold or rearrange her words for others. She&#39;d have felt a bit more caged than Amy did.




Amy Loves Laurie
          

When all is said and done, Amy does love Laurie. Amy has loved him for a long time, and Laurie needs to be loved. If he had married Jo, she may have tried to convince herself that she loved him romantically, but Amy does it without trying.

Laurie gets a love match. From it, he gets to be part of the March family, so he&#39;ll always be connected to everyone, including Jo. Greta Gerwig&#39;s version of Little Women also does a good job at making it clear that Amy isn&#39;t Laurie&#39;s second choice, though she believes that. Laurie clearly loves Amy; it just takes him longer for those feelings to grow. Gerwig&#39;s Little Women makes the match between Amy and Laurie much clearer than previous adaptations.
