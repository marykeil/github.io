# Why Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour Left Netflix


## SUMMARY 



  Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour has been removed from Netflix without explanation. It was a successful concert film that portrayed Swift&#39;s historic tour.   The reason for the movie&#39;s removal could be related to the ownership of Taylor Swift&#39;s album Reputation, which has yet to be released in her &#34;Taylor&#39;s Version.&#34;   However, fans can still stream Miss Americana on Netflix, a documentary that offers a deep and emotional look into Swift&#39;s life as a global superstar.

## Literature Review

Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour is the fourth documentary starring the international pop star but it has been mysteriously removed from Netflix.




Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour has surprisingly been removed from Netflix, but it is unclear for exactly what reason. International pop star Taylor Swift has been the subject of plenty of documentaries, beginning in 2010 with Taylor Swift: Journey To Fearless. In 2010, Swift had only released three albums and, though her popularity was rocketing, she was still not the massive music, video, and pop culture icon she went on to become. With her impressive singing range, ear for catchy tunes, and seeming preternatural ability to understand what her fanbase will love, Swift&#39;s essence is hard to capture in one standalone film, or even in a documentary series.




One of the documentaries that attempt to harness just a small portion of Swift&#39;s power is Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour. This is a concert film released in December 2018 and depicts Swift&#39;s second performance at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas for her Reputation Stadium Tour. It was the fifth concert tour of Swift&#39;s career and a celebration of the release of her sixth studio album, Reputation (2017). The movie succeeded in accurately showcasing what went on to be a historic and award-winning tour. But despite the movie&#39;s success and important role in telling the story of Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour is no longer on Netflix.

 No Reason Was Given For Why Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour Left Netflix 
          




Neither Netflix nor anyone else involved in Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour has given a reason for the concert movie leaving the platform on December 30, 2023. As a Netflix original, it&#39;s a little strange that the movie would ever leave the streamer. It&#39;s not an entirely unprecedented move, however, and Netflix originals do occasionally get removed if ownership belongs to some other party (via What&#39;s on Netflix). That could be the simple answer, or it could be a messier issue considering Taylor Swift&#39;s fight to retain some of her albums.

Reputation is one of two remaining Swift albums that the pop star has yet to make a &#34;Taylor&#39;s Version&#34; for, along with Taylor Swift (2006). If Reputation is up for rerelease, Netflix may have decided to avoid controversy by giving the rights to their concert movie back to Swift. At the moment, Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour is not available to stream anywhere else, and it doesn&#39;t appear to be returning to Netflix anytime soon.






 What Taylor Swift Documentaries Are Still On Netflix? 
          

Fortunately for fans of Taylor Swift who have Netflix subscriptions, there is still one Taylor Swift documentary available to stream on the platform. Miss Americana (2020) is one of her few non-concert movies that instead follows Swift for several years between Reputation&#39;s release and Lover&#39;s (2019) rollout. It&#39;s a probing, emotional, and honest documentary that details the exhaustion and frustration that comes with being an international superstar. Swift&#39;s trademark vulnerability and down-to-earth qualities are on full exhibit in Miss Americana.



 Is Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour Available For Streaming? 
          




Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour is another of Swift&#39;s celebrated concert movies with a 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. The 2023 doc is not currently streaming but is playing in theaters, and it&#39;s been released for rent on select streaming platforms. According to Town &amp; Country, Swift has the option to put Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour on streaming 13 weeks after its theatrical premiere, which would mean January 12, 2024 is the earliest time it can arrive, though that doesn&#39;t mean it has to go to streaming, just that the option is there. Similar to Taylor Swift: Reputation Stadium Tour, streaming fans will have to wait for their music documentary.
