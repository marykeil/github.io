# 2 Subtle Details Gave Away Five Nights At Freddy s Big Villain Twist


## SUMMARY 



  Matthew Lillard&#39;s villain twist in the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie was foreshadowed in the opening credits, where his name appeared alongside the Spring Bonnie character, hinting at his true identity.   Before his reveal as the serial killer William Afton, Afton&#39;s voice in the Spring Bonnie suit was distorted but recognizable as Lillard&#39;s, and his knife move was a nod to Lillard&#39;s previous role in the Scream franchise.   Afton&#39;s transformation into Springtrap suggests that Lillard&#39;s character will continue in future Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s installments, promising a darker and deadlier direction for the franchise.

## Literature Review



Two subtle details gave away Matthew Lillard&#39;s villain twist in the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, and one of those details came within the film&#39;s first five minutes. Lillard played the role of William Afton in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s cast, but he was first introduced as Steve Raglan, the career counselor who hires Mike to work as Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza&#39;s night guard. Lying about his identity was bad enough, but it turned out Afton was the serial killer who murdered several children, including Mike&#39;s younger brother, and hid their bodies in the pizzeria&#39;s giant animatronics.




Whereas Afton wore the yellow rabbit Spring Bonnie suit during Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s ending, the rest of the movie&#39;s animatronics came to life through the power of the souls trapped inside them. Initially targeting Mike as a threat, the young murder victims were reminded of the truth, causing them to turn on Afton. Upon attacking him, the spring lock in Afton&#39;s suit malfunctioned, essentially turning Lillard into the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s Springtrap character. Afton was gravely injured, but franchise details implied Lillard would return in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 and beyond. Even though Lillard&#39;s multi-film deal hinted at his character&#39;s fate, his character&#39;s identity was teased several times before the big reveal.


 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Opening Credits Gave Away Matthew Lillard&#39;s Role As The Villain 
          




Before William Afton was seen wearing the Spring Bonnie suit, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s confirmed a &#34;yellow rabbit&#34; had something to do with Garrett&#39;s disappearance. That yellow rabbit turned out to be the leader of the souls powering the animatronics and, more importantly, the man who kidnapped and murdered the kids whom Mike had been seeing in his nightmares. However, during Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s opening credits sequence, Matthew Lillard&#39;s name appeared just as the Spring Bonnie character was shown. Using his name with the yellow rabbit was a subtle sign that Lillard&#39;s character was more than just a career counselor.

              Related   If You Thought William Afton Was Evil In Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s, Just Wait Until The Sequels   If you watched the FNAF movie (but haven&#39;t played the games) and thought William Afton was evil in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s, just wait for the sequels.    



 William Afton&#39;s Knife Move In FNAF Is A Callback To Matthew Lillard&#39;s Scream Role 
          




Even before Steve Raglan revealed himself to be William Afton, there were a few more clues to Lillard&#39;s Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s villain twist. While talking to Mike in the Spring Bonnie suit, the voice was distorted, but it was still clearly Lillard&#39;s. That said, Afton made a particular move with his weapon that doubled as a reference to another villain linked to Lillard. While taunting Mike, Afton wiped his knife blade clean the same way Ghostface does in the Scream franchise.

Lillard, of course, played Stu Macher, one of the first characters revealed as Ghostface in the slasher series. Those familiar with Ghostface&#39;s signature knife swipe may have instantly connected Lillard&#39;s Scream homage in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s moments before Afton even revealed his true identity. Unlike Scream, which seems unlikely to bring back Lillard&#39;s character in any form, Afton still has a future in Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s now that he transformed into Springtrap. What&#39;s more, Springtrap will be even deadlier, suggesting future franchise installment will be even darker than Blumhouse&#39;s initial movie adaptation.
