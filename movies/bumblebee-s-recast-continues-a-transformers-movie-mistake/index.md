# Bumblebee s Recast Continues A Transformers Movie Mistake


## SUMMARY 



Bumblebee&#39;s voice recasting in the upcoming Transformers One movie misses the opportunity to bring back Dylan O&#39;Brien, who did a great job in the Bumblebee spin-off.

The decision to recast multiple Transformers characters for the animated film contradicts the goal of a unified continuity in the franchise&#39;s timeline.

Dylan O&#39;Brien is a better fit for the role of Bumblebee than Keegan-Michael Key because O&#39;Brien captures the youthful and reckless nature of the character introduced in the Bumblebee movie.

## Literature Review
Keegan-Michael Key is voicing Bumblebee in Transformers One, which misses the option to bring back Dylan O&#39;Brien from the Bumblebee movie.
