## Literature Review
The Star Trek franchise&#39;s 13 movies have introduced a series of important, intriguing, and intrepid new female characters.




With 13 bold and adventurous space-faring movies (so far), the Star Trek franchise has introduced many new, exciting, daring, and interesting female characters. Most of the franchise&#39;s feature films have anchored, warped, or enriched the central stories with a balance of gendered characters, from allies to enemies to old flames to mentored cadets. With Persis Khambatta&#39;s Lieutenant Ilia establishing the precedent in the franchise&#39;s cinematic premiere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, most Star Trek movies have seen plot and character developments with a wide-ranging wealth of powerful and remarkable women. 
Bridging the gaps between the crews of Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek: The Next Generation in the Prime universe, and J.J. Abram&#39;s rebooted Star Trek in the alternate Kelvin timeline, several of the characters listed below overlap the two realities or leapfrog movies with different actors playing the same role. Other Star Trek movies introduce brand-new characters from unexplored worlds or far-flung heroines with previous history with the franchise&#39;s established (mostly male) heroes. Other movies find inspiration from people in past eras. But with such a wealth and variation of possibilities, thesefresh female players hit the big screen with style. Let&#39;s look at Star Trek&#39;s best new female movie characters.

Caithlin Dar appeared as the Romulan representative on Nimbus III in Star Trek V: The Final Frontier and was one of three diplomats captured by the radical Vulcan Sybok (Laurence Luckinbill) and subjected to his mental influence during his quest to find Sha Ka Ree. Aligning with Sybok&#39;s Galactic Army of Light, Caithlin Dar and the Human and Klingon diplomats quickly work to entrap and disarm the USS Enterprise-A shuttle crew officers, sending out a staged hostage transmission and ultimately taking over the ship. An important figure by profession and placement, Caithlin Dar personifies the progressive importance and contrasting risks of cooperation, commitment, and trust.

Star Trek: Insurrection
        

In Star Trek: Insurrection, Anij (Donna Murphy) stars as a peaceful Ba&#39;ku settler over 300 years old. With the metaphasic particles from the planet&#39;s rings providing renewing properties, the Ba&#39;ku are extraordinarily long-lived and have developed a degree of mental influence. As a Son&#39;a/Starfleet conspiracy begins to take root against the Ba&#39;ku, Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Anij develop a romantic relationship and set out to defend the Ba&#39;ku against the despicable scheme. Notable for her enhanced youth, mental abilities, and loyalty to her people, Anij&#39;s commitment emphasizes the significance of her long life and considered peaceful ideals.

Star Trek: The Motion Picture
        

In Star Trek&#39;s 1979 movie premiere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Lieutenant Ilia (Persis Khambatta) is assigned to the USS Enterprise as navigator when Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) assumes command to investigate the V&#39;Ger entity. A Deltan, Ilia had pain-relieving abilities during tactile contact with others and comforted Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig) following a wrist injury. Ilia is killed on the Enterprise&#39;s Bridge by V&#39;Ger&#39;s probe during the mission and soon replicated almost exactly as a second probe by V&#39;Ger, sent to the Enterprise to collect information on the &#34;carbon unit&#34; crew. Kirk later listed Lieutenant Ilia, alongside her lover, Commander Will Decker (Stephen Collins), missing in action.

Faking an assignment to the Enterprise, Carol conceals her identity and joins the crew as Dr. Carol Wallace. Boasting a doctorate in applied physics, specializing in advanced weaponry, Carol is significantly willing to investigate the shady irregularities despite the proximity of her familial relationship, ultimately risking her life and standing against her father in an attempt to save the Enterprise crew. Confident, capable, and quietly intellectual, Carol Marcus displays an idealistic, hopeful belief in the good intentions of others coupled with a wary, experienced distrust.

Formerly a Starfleet officer, the human Jessica Wolff was assigned to the USS Franklin under the command of Captain Balthazar Edison (Idris Elba). Wolff transforms into Kalara, an alien form, using energy transfer technology found on the planet. Part of a Starfleet ship crew-turned-bad, Kalara mirrors the movie&#39;s protagonists and subverts the expectation of Starfleet as a force for good. Though not singularly responsible for the loss and devastation created through the original Franklin crew&#39;s actions, Kalara is nonetheless an agent of evil and bears significant responsibility for the colossal loss.

Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country

However, Valeris has another agenda and participates in a conspiracy to sabotage the Klingon-Federation peace talks through assassination and political framing.

Later, Donatra fought against Shinzon&#39;s starship, the Scimitar, aiding Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the USS Enterprise-E, sending medical shuttles and aid to the Enterprise after the battle. Later, informing Picard that a friendship had formed between them, Donatra solidifies the character&#39;s importance in multiple regards. Indicative of Romulan culture and behaviors, Donatra&#39;s red lines forged great significance, established alliances, and saved lives.

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home


Close







Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (the one with the whales) introduced Dr. Gillian Taylor (Catherine Hicks) as the kindly cetacean biologist caring for two humpback whales, George and Gracie. Showing a commitment to her charges, Dr Taylor becomes frustrated by the unusually evasive Admiral James T. Kirk and Captain Spock. Though disbelieving of their claims, she nonetheless seeks their assistance when the whales are released ahead of schedule. Later insisting on returning to the future with the stolen Klingon-ship crew and the two whales, Dr Taylor proves her resolute commitment to the whales&#39; welfare, and boldly goes into the future facing a brand new life.

 5  Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis) 
Star Trek III: The Search For Spock, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home


Close







Lieutenant Saavik (Robin Curtis), initially played by Kirstie Alley in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, picks up the adventure in Star Trek III: The Search For Spock. Having transferred to the USS Grissom following events in the previous movie, Saavik works with David Marcus (Merrick Butrick) to study the Genesis Planet, where they find the rejuvenated but young and rapidly aging Spock. With rapid aging comes the sudden onset of Pon Farr, the Vulcan time of mating, and Saavik has little option but to help Spock through this violent ordeal. Later reunited with the Enterprise crew, Saavik assists with returning Spock to Vulcan to reunite his body and Katra.





 4  Lieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley) 
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan


Close







One of two new female characters introduced in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (with Bibi Besch as Dr. Carol Marcus), Lieutenant Saavik (Kirstie Alley) stars as a Vulcan mentored by Spock (Leonard Nimoy). Failing the infamous Kobayashi Maru command simulation near the movie&#39;s beginning, Saavik embarks on a learning quest parallel to the Enterprise&#39;s mission. Assigned to the Enterprise as a navigator, Saavik&#39;s curiosity and inquisitiveness simultaneously demonstrate her Vulcan intellect and professional inexperience. With this movie the first of a multiple-part story, Alley sets up Saavik&#39;s story arc with an approachable, emotionally invested character that serves as a comparison for an established, tested crew. 





 3  Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) 
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan


Close







Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) starred in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, appearing as the noted Chief Scientist who created the Starfleet-funded life-forming Genesis Project. Alongside her scientific work, Carol Marcus was previously romantically involved with William Shatner&#39;s Admiral Kirk (at the time a junior officer in Starfleet) and mother to their son, David Marcus (Merrick Butrick). Stationed on Regula I with the now-grown David and their team, ready to test their creation, Carol Marcus is drawn into the conflict between Kirk and the vengeance-driven augment, Khan Noonien Singh (Ricardo Montalban). Though the interruption derails the project, Carol Marcus uses the situation to unite David with his father.





 2  Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) 
Star Trek: First Contact
        

Lily Sloane (Alfre Woodard) starred in Star Trek: First Contact as a 21st-century human working to develop Earth&#39;s first warp-capable spacecraft, the Phoenix. A strong and formidable character, Lily was a highly determined survivor of Earth&#39;s World War III, somewhat jaded by her experiences. No stranger to the struggles of life&#39;s hardships or the dark potential of others, Lily rises to meet a series of trying situations and possible foes, even verbally taking on Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart). Working mainly with Picard to overcome the Borg threat and restore the timeline, Lily&#39;s bold actions, courage, and grounded morality are a weighty measure that establishes her remarkable character and sets the movie&#39;s tone.
