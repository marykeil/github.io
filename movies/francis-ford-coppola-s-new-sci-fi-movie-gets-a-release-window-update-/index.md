## Literature Review

Francis Ford Coppola teases the release window for when audiences will be able to view his long-awaited sci-fi passion project, Megalopolis.




Acclaimed director Francis Ford Coppola opens up about the current status of Megalopolis, teasing the tone of his longtime sci-fi passion project and when audiences can expect the film to release. With its development tracing back to the early days of the director&#39;s career in the 1980s, the movie is a tale of two lovers amidst a conflict over the fate of New York, where traditionalist minds clash with futurist visionaries over the devastated city&#39;s future. Megalopolis&#39; all-star cast includes Adam Driver, Nathalie Emmanuel, Forest Whittaker, Giancarlo Esposito, Jason Schwartzman, Laurence Fishburne, and Aubrey Plaza.




With Megalopolis wrapping filming in March 2023, Indiewire reports that Coppola opened up about the current status of his sci-fi tale to the Accutron podcast, discussing its release window and his experience with the movie&#39;s production. While the director&#39;s comments were few, Coppola did confirm that Megalopolis could be expected to release in 2024, while teasing that the cast&#39;s performances helped ensure that audiences would never be lost throughout its runtime. Check out Coppola&#39;s comments below:


It’s only going to be a few months and it’ll be out. All I can say is I love the actors in it. It’s unusual, and it’s never boring. Other than that, wait and see.



 Megalopolis&#39; Release Will Mark The End of Almost 40 Years Of Development 
          

Megalopolis began its life in the 1980s as a dream of Coppola&#39;s, and would be financed by a number of the director&#39;s productions throughout the 20th century, including his 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula. Despite his dedication to the idea, however, the film would face numerous setbacks, including Coppola&#39;s own unease surrounding the appropriateness of the movie&#39;s narrative in a post-9/11 American cultural landscape, and his time raising the funds for the project. However, the pauses and potential abandonments would eventually lead to 2019, when Coppola confirmed the project had been revived, with November 2022 marking the start of filming.

Despite this, however, Megalopolis&#39; production hasn&#39;t been free from trouble, as discussions began to circle about production troubles in January 2023. Rumors suggested that the movie was surpassing Coppola&#39;s self-funded $120 million budget, and a change of hands in the art production teams had caused chaos midway through filming. However, both Coppola and Driver have both come out to defend the production from statements they claim were far from the truth, with Driver going so far as to praise his Megalopolis experience as a standout example of how movies should be made.

With Coppola&#39;s past acclaim, an all-star cast, and extensive development, Megalopolis has been a highly-anticipated feature. However, with its troubled history and further rumored on-set issued, many moviegoers have been wary as to whether the dream project would ever be brought to screen. That being said, with Coppola&#39;s confident 2024 release window tease, it is clear audiences will not have to wait long to get a glimpse at the director&#39;s sci-fi epic.
