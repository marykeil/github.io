 Is Whiplash Based On A True Story? Damien Chazelle&#39;s Real Inspirations Explained 
The 2014 movie Whiplash stars Miles Teller as an aspiring drummer and J.K. Simmons as his ruthless teacher. What was the inspiration for the film?












 








 Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) 
Available on Peacock, The Roku Channel, Hoopla, Vudu, Kanopy, Pluto TV and Plex
        

Part of what makes Whiplash such an exciting movie is the fast-paced energy and captivating dialogue in a high-pressure world. In that way, Glengarry Glen Ross is a similar movie as it follows the various desperate men working as real estate brokers hungry for a sale.
The movie is stacked with talent, with Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Jack Lemmon, and more giving wonderful performances. Written by the great David Mamet, it is a funny, tense, and thrilling movie that is all about people talking to each other.





 The Prestige (2006) 
Available on Paramount&#43;
        

  The Prestige  


  Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Michael Caine , Christian Bale , Hugh Jackman , Scarlett Johansson , Piper Perabo     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    130 minutes    


Though not talked about as often as some of Christopher Nolan&#39;s other movies, The Prestige is an excellent thriller that deserves more attention. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as rival stage magicians in the late 1800s who long war with each other terms darker over the years.
While a movie about magicians might not seem to have much in common with Whiplash, The Prestige is another movie about the obsession for perfection. The need to find the perfect trick drives both men to some dark places in this gripping mystery tale.





 First Man (2018) 
Available on Fubo
        

  First Man  


  Release Date    October 12, 2018     Director    Damien Chazelle     Cast    Jason Clarke , Christopher Abbott , Jon Bernthal , Kyle Chandler , Brian D&#39;Arcy James , Shea Whigham , Cory Michael Smith , Lukas Haas , Ryan Gosling , Pablo Schreiber , Claire Foy , Corey Stoll , Patrick Fugit     Rating    PG-13    


While La La Land is another of Damien Chazelle&#39;s movies to focus on jazz, Whiplash actually has more in common First Man. Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong who, after suffering his own tragedy, dedicates himself completely to his ambitions with going to space, regardless of the risks.
No movie has made space exploration look as terrifying as Chazelle does here. It is an endeavor filled with dangers and a million things that could go wrong. It is also an interesting look at a side of this American hero the world doesn&#39;t often get to see.





 Foxcatcher (2015) 
Available to rent on Prime Video and AppleTV&#43;
        

  Foxcatcher  


  Release Date    November 14, 2014     Director    Bennett Miller     Cast    Steve Carell , Channing Tatum , Mark Ruffalo     Rating    R    


Whiplash goes to some dark places in this tale of a young man who put his trust in an older mentor. However, it is nothing compared to what is seen in the sports drama Foxcatcher. Based on a true story, it follows wrestler Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) who is given a shot at Olympic glory by eccentric millionaire John du Pont (Steve Carrell).
The movie is a mix of Whiplash&#39;s story of a young man looking to make a name for himself at all costs and the dark path a manipulative relationship like this can take. The cast is exceptional, including Mark Ruffalo as Mark&#39;s brother who is weary of John from the beginning.





 Chef (2014) 
Available on STARZ
        

  Chef  


  Director    Jon Favreau     Cast    Jon Favreau , John Leguizamo , Bobby Cannavale , Emjay Anthony , Scarlett Johansson , Dustin Hoffman     Rating    R     Runtime    114minutes    


Chef is a much lighter movie than Whiplash and is perhaps the more optimistic way of telling a similar story with the movie set in the restaurant world. Jon Favreau wrote, directed, and starred in this movie about a renowned Los Angeles chef who loses his job following a breakdown and attempts to reconnect with his love of food by going cross-country in a food truck.
The movie is a light and funny comedy with Favreau leading a great cast including John Leguizamo, Scarlett Johansson, and Robert Downey Jr. It also holds a nice message about embracing a passion however possible.

Damien Chazelle is an acclaimed and fascinating director with a filmography spanning multiple genres, from musical to epic Hollywood drama.








 Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom (2020) 
Available on Netflix
        

  Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom  


  Director    George C. Wolfe     Cast    Glynn Turman , Chadwick Boseman , Colman Domingo , Viola Davis , Michael Potts     Rating    R     Runtime    93 minutes    


Another movie set in the music world that tells a story of trying to make it is Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom. Viola Davis stars as the titular singer with the movie focusing on a recording session with her and her band, including the ambitious yet rebellious trumpet player, Levee (Chadwick Boseman).
While a very different movie from Whiplash in many ways, there are some interesting similarities to find. The combative relationship between Ma Rainey and Levee is another tense power dynamic while Levee&#39;s own desperate journey mirrors Andrew in some ways.





 Good Will Hunting (1997) 
Available on MAX


 







  Good Will Hunting  


  Director    Gus Van Sant     Cast    Robin Williams , Ben Affleck , Minnie Driver , Matt Damon , Stellan Skarsgård     Rating    R     Runtime    126 minutes    


While there are various possible interpretations for what the ending of Whiplash says, it seems quite clear that the movie sees the student-teacher relationship between Andrew and Fletcher to be an unhealthy one. Yet it is hard to deny the relationship is the most compelling aspect of the movie.
By contrast, Good Will Hunting is a story that shows the power a relationship like this can have. Though the conversations between troubled young man Will (Matt Damon) and psychiatrist Sean (Robin Williams) start with a lot of tension, Sean teaches Will to forgive himself and accept a life he deserves. It makes Good Will Huntingone of the most inspiring movies.





 Birdman (2014) 
Available to rent on Apple TV, Prime Video, and Vudu
        

  Birdman  


  Director    Alejandro González Iñárritu     Cast    Andrea Riseborough , Naomi Watts , Emma Stone , Edward Norton , Zach Galifianakis , Michael Keaton , Amy Ryan     Rating    R     Runtime    120minutes    


Birdman is another movie about an artist trying to create something great and pushing himself too far to achieve it. Michael Keaton stars as an actor made famous for playing a superhero who tries to regain some credibility by staging an ambitious Broadway play.
Alejandro González Iñárritu directed the movie in long takes to make it all appear as one continuous take and help to further resemble a play itself. It makes for a unique cinematic experience with great performances from the cast that also includes Edward Norton and Emma Stone.





 The Social Network (2010) 
Available on STARZ


 







  The Social Network  


  Director    David Fincher     Cast    Jesse Eisenberg , Rooney Mara , Andrew Garfield , Justin Timberlake , Armie Hammer     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    120 minutes    


The interesting thing about Whiplash is that the more Miles Teller&#39;s character becomes a talented musician, the worse he becomes as a person. This kind of tortured genius approach also helps to make The Social Network such a brilliant movie with a fascinating main character.
Jesse Eisenberg stars as Mark Zuckerberg in the riveting exploration of how he built the massive, ground-breaking company Facebook and the relationships that were destroyed along the way. The movie has been hailed as one of the best of the decade with a sharp script and quotes that have already become classics.





 8 Mile (2002) 
Available to rent on AppleTV&#43;, Vudu, and Prime Video


 







  8 Mile  


  Director    Curtis Hanson     Cast    Mekhi Phifer , Kim Basinger , Brittany Murphy , Michael Shannon , Anthony Mackie , Eminem     Rating    R     Runtime    110 minutes    


Jazz drumming and freestyle rapping might not appear to have too much in common, but 8 Mile does feel like a similar story to Whiplash in many ways. The movie marks the screen debut of Eminem in the semi-autobiographical story of a young man from Detroit looking to break out in the world of underground rap.
The movie is a fascinating look into a kind of music not everyone will be familiar with, yet it hooks the audience effectively. It is also about someone whose dedication to their craft does not waiver no matter what is thrown in his way.





 Amadeus (1985) 
Available to rent on Apple TV and Prime Video
        

Though set a couple of hundred years before Whiplash, Amadeus feels like a similar story of obsession over art. The movie tells the story of Italian composer Antonio Salieri who developed deep and resentful jealousy towards the more successful and younger Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
Though largely fiction, the story is nonetheless compelling as it sees the lengths this man will go to rid himself of his supposed rival. It is a beautiful-looking, wonderfully acted drama with an epic scope.





 Uncut Gems (2019) 
Available on Netflix and Hoopla


 







  Uncut Gems  


  Director    Josh Safdie , Benny Safdie     Cast    Jonathan Aranbayev , Eric Bogosian , The Weeknd , Idina Menzel , Noa Fisher , Kevin Garnett , Tommy Kominik , LaKeith Stanfield , Jacob Igielski , Adam Sandler , Julia Fox , Keith Williams Richards     Rating    R     Runtime    134 minutes    


Despite focusing on the world of jazz, Whiplash is one of the most anxiety-inducing movies in recent memory. It is the kind of movie that will tie the audience&#39;s stomach in a knot yet still entertain you. Uncut Gems also pulls off that special trick with an even more heart-racing story.
Adam Sandler stars as a New York City jeweler who is also a gambling addict. The movie follows him as he makes deal after deal, barely keeping his head above water as it all threatens to come crashing down on his head. Sandler is astounding in the role, giving one of the great dramatic performances from a comedic actor.

Movies are known for entertaining but some films go beyond that, providing viewers with an intense viewing experience that requires more thinking.








 Black Swan (2010) 
Available on Hulu
        

  Black Swan  


  Director    Darren Aronofsky     Cast    Natalie Portman , Mila Kunis , Vincent Cassel , Barbara Hershey , Winona Ryder , Benjamin Millepied     Rating    R     Runtime    108 minutes    


Black Swan is another movie that takes a look at a unique and stylish art form and explores the sacrifices a character has to make in order to achieve perfection. Natalie Portman stars as a ballet dancer who is given the chance to perform the lead in Swan Lake. As the pressure mounts, she begins to lose touch with reality.
Portman gives a powerhouse performance which earned her a well-deserved Oscar while the movie is a dark and mind-bending nightmare from Darren Aronofsky. It is unsettling, beautiful, and unforgettable.





 Sound Of Metal (2020) 
Available on Prime Video
        

  Sound of Metal  


  Director    Darius Marder     Cast    Shaheem Sanchez , Riz Ahmed , Paul Raci , Jeremy Stone , Mathieu Amalric , Olivia Cooke , Lauren Ridloff , Chelsea Lee     Rating    R     Runtime    130 minutes    


While drummers might get a lot out of Whiplash, it is not necessarily just a movie for music lovers, even if it does a great job of showing that passion. Sound of Metal follows a similar path as it focuses on the story of a heavy metal drummer who must cope with losing his hearing.
Ruben isn&#39;t so much on a mission to be the best but is rather desperate to have the life back that he loved. His slow realization that all that is gone and his trying to make this new life work is heartbreaking yet inspiring.





 Nightcrawler (2014) 
Available on STARZ
        

  Nightcrawler  


  Director    Dan Gilroy     Cast    Riz Ahmed , Bill Paxton , Jake Gyllenhaal , Rene Russo , Kevin Rahm , Michael Hyatt , Ann Cusack     Rating    R     Runtime    117 Minutes    


Like Whiplash, Nightcrawler is an intense movie that explores the dark side of ambition. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as a man with endless determination to become successful yet who is willing to do immoral things to achieve that success. He finds his calling in the seedy world of freelance crime scene videographers.
The movie is a chilling and compelling look at a self-made man who is deeply unsettling to watch. Gyllenhaal gives a haunting performance in this grim and gripping tale of Los Angeles at night. The intensity of the story and performances will appeal to fans looking for more movies like Whiplash.
