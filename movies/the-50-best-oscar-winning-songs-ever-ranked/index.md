## Literature Review

The Oscars best song category celebrates the original musical numbers that are beautiful and thematic additions to already celebrated films.




The Oscars best song awards category, Best Original Song, celebrates the talented musicians who have crafted some of the most beautiful and memorable arrangements in film history. The Academy Awards is the most prestigious movie awards ceremony and a win in any category is an acknowledgment of technical, cultural, and industry success. Nearly every aspect of filmmaking is recognized, and music has two awards celebrating their efforts: Best Original Song and Best Original Score. Best Original Song goes to the songwriters of one original song made specifically for a movie of that year.
The award was first presented at the 7th Academy Awards, which took place in 1935 with the Oscar going to &#34;The Continental&#34; from The Gay Divorcee. Since then, the Oscar has been presented at every Academy Award ceremony. How movies get nominated for Oscars can be a complex process and, over its history, between two and 14 songs have been nominated in a single year. However, since 2012, the rules have outlined that there would be five nominees per year, via Billboard. Best Original Song winners have sometimes left a larger mark than the movie they featured in, and often, they&#39;ve managed to elevate an already celebrated title.

The buddy Western starring Robert Redford and Paul Newman ended up winning four awards that night.

 46  &#34;Theme From Shaft&#34; By Isaac Hayes (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
Shaft (1971) at the 44th Academy Awards
        

Most people may know the controversial Isaac Hayes for playing Chef in South Park, but long before that, Hayes was a Grammy-winning soul musician who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 (via Rockhall). He composed the theme song for the blaxploitation crime thriller Shaft, which plays at the beginning of the film, making him the first Black man to win the award. Funky, cool, and setting the groove for the movie, the song could be considered one of the first superhero themes.

 45  &#34;No Time To Die&#34; By Billie Eilish &amp; Finneas O&#39;Connell (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
No Time To Die (2021) at the 94th Academy Awards
        

  No Time to Die  


  Release Date    October 8, 2021     Cast    Daniel Craig , Rami Malek , Lea Seydoux , Ralph Fiennes , Lashana Lynch , Jeffrey Wright , Billy Magnussen , Dali Benssalah , Naomie Harris , Rory Kinnear , Ben Whishaw , Ana De Armas , David Dencik     Genres    Action , Adventure , Thriller    


The James Bond theme songs are key aspects of the enduring franchise and are just as important to the movies as new villains or gadgets. Billie Eilish became the youngest person to write one of the themes when she and her brother Finneas O&#39;Connell composed &#34;No Time to Die&#34; for the movie of the same name. The groundbreaking and hip Eilish went for a more classical approach to the theme, which helps to make it a dark and mysterious number to open Craig&#39;s final Bond movie.

 44  &#34;I&#39;m Easy&#34; By Keith Carradine (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
Nashville (1975) at the 48th Academy Awards
        

Nashville is a satirical musical-comedy by Robert Altman that follows five different people in the lead-up to a gala concert. There is nearly an hour of musical numbers in the film, but it&#39;s &#34;I&#39;m Easy&#34; by Keith Carradine that received the Oscar for Best Original Song. Carradine, who plays Tom Frank, sings this love ballad about a man who is enraptured by the woman of his dreams. The song makes a funny juxtaposition compared to Tom&#39;s character as a cad and manipulative womanizer.

 43  &#34;If I Didn&#39;t Have You&#34; By Randy Newman (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
Monsters, Inc. (2001) at the 74th Academy Awards
        

  Monsters, Inc.  


  Release Date    November 2, 2001     Cast    John Goodman , Billy Crystal , Steve Buscemi , James Coburn , Jennifer Tilly , Mary Gibbs     Genres    Adventure , Animation , Comedy    


Randy Newman continues his long collaboration with Pixar in Monsters, Inc. with the Academy Award-winning song &#34;If I Didn&#39;t Have You&#34;. Monsters, Inc. is the third feature-length Pixar movie and a sign that the studio&#39;s success with Toy Story was not a fluke after the excellent but less critically lauded A Bug&#39;s Life. Newman&#39;s &#34;If I Didn&#39;t Have You&#34; is a catchy and whip-smart duet between Sulley (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal). It&#39;s a bit of a riff on &#34;You&#39;ve Got A Friend In Me&#34; but Goodman and Crystal&#39;s earnest vocals give it heart and charm.

The song has a funky and uplifting beat that obscures the frightening and foreboding lyrics that are a warning to Hampton and his allies.

 41  &#34;I Just Called To Say I Love You&#34; By Stevie Wonder (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
The Woman in Red (1984) at the 57th Academy Awards
        

Stevie Wonder&#39;s &#34;I Just Called to Say I Love You&#34; also earned three Grammy nominations to go along with its Oscar win for its role as the lead single on the soundtrack for The Woman in Red. It&#39;s a bubbly and optimistic song that fits well with this sex farce where Ted Pierce (Gene Wilder) becomes infatuated with a woman in a red dress and attempts to start a relationship with her.

It&#39;s a poppy, joyous end to the movie and a perfect capper to the vivid and colorful movie with some commendable singing from Egerton.

Fame (1980) at the 53rd Academy Awards
        

The title track for Fame is performed by Irena Cara in the movie, but the music is by Michael Gore and the lyrics are by Dean Pitchford. Cara plays Coco Hernandez in the teen musical drama about aspiring students attending a performance arts school in New York City. &#34;Fame&#34; serves as the theme song of both the movie and the TV show that followed, and it was Cara&#39;s debut single.

 38  &#34;Last Dance&#34; By Paul Jabara (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
Thank God It’s Friday (1978) at the 51st Academy Awards
        

Thank God It&#39;s Friday is a musical-comedy that tells several intertwining stories of the patrons and employees of the LA disco, The Zoo, over one Friday night. &#34;Last Dance&#34; is a funky, disco-infused party song that would still be appropriate at clubs four decades later. Donna Summer sings as Nicole Sims, an aspiring disco act, and Summer won a Grammy for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Song while Paul Jabara took home the Oscar.

 37  &#34;The Weary Kind&#34; By Ryan Bingham &amp; T Bone Burnett (Music &amp; Lyrics) 
Crazy Heart (2009) at the 82nd Academy Awards
        

&#34;The Weary Kind&#34; is the main theme from Crazy Heart, and it&#39;s heard multiple times throughout the movie. Colin Farell (Tommy Sweet) and Jeff Bridges (Otis &#34;Bad&#34; Blake) both play the song at different points in the movie, with Ryan Bingham and his Dead Horses band serving as backup. It&#39;s a sad, beautiful arrangement that also won a Grammy for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media thanks in part to how well it paints the picture of &#34;Bad&#34; as a talented but self-sabotaging country star.

 36  &#34;Naatu Naatu&#34; By M. M. Keeravani (Music); Chandrabose (Lyrics) 
RRR (2022) at the 95th Academy Awards

The much-hyped RRR took the English-speaking world by storm as Tollywood movies do not often gain much traction with audiences outside India. The Academy recognized the film&#39;s achievement by giving M. M. Keeravani and Chandrabose an Oscar for their centerpiece dance number &#34;Naatu Naatu&#34;. It was the first song from an Asian film to win the award. As would be expected of a Tollywood or Bollywood movie, the dance number for &#34;Naatu Naatu&#34; is extremely catchy and incredibly choreographed.

The Prince of Egypt (1998) at the 71st Academy Awards
        

DreamWorks&#39; animated film The Prince of Egypt tells the biblical story of Moses and the plagues of Egypt, and it doesn&#39;t hold back from any of the violence or terror, despite ostensibly being a children&#39;s movie. &#34;When You Believe&#34; is one of the many fantastic songs on the soundtrack and is a powerful and beautiful number sung when the Jewish slaves are released from Egypt. In the movie, the song is sung by Sally Dworsky, who provides the singing voice of Miriam, and Michelle Pfeiffer, who voices Tzipporah. The end credits feature a pop version sung by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.
