Summary

  Speculations are circulating that Jason Momoa may join the DC Universe as Lobo, and he shares his thoughts on what he would bring to the role.   Momoa expresses interest in having custom-made props for the character, including a great chain with a sickle and other personalized accessories.   While it&#39;s not confirmed that Momoa will play Lobo, the fact that he is still being considered for another role in the DC Universe shows that DC Studios wants to continue working with him.  





With speculations fueling that Jason Momoa is joining the DC Universe as Lobo, the former Aquaman star shares what he would like to bring to the role. The DCEU timeline came to an end with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, as DC Studios is getting ready for their new DC Universe under James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s leadership. While Momoa may be done playing Arthur Curry, his time with DC Studios isn&#39;t over yet, as he is reportedly being eyed for another role.




Following the ending of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, Screen Rant recently interviewed Momoa about his new documentary series, On the Roam, which is coming January 18 to Max. While promoting his latest project, Momoa was asked, &#34;You’ve gotten knives made for See from artists Richard Baggett, Terry Shanks, and Neil Kamimura. Let’s say, hypothetically, you do play a character like Lobo. What is something you’d want custom-made for a character like that?&#34; to which he shared the following:


Jason Momoa: What’s Lobo got? He’s got the great chain with the sickle on it, right? He’s got the chain and the hook. I mean, obviously, we’re going to have to do stuff like that. But I’d throw in something kind of custom. A custom piece. I’d have to think about that. That’s a good question. I’d have to think about what I would make.


                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Far    James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.   





 Is Jason Momoa Actually Playing Lobo In James Gunn&#39;s DC Universe? 
         

The idea of Momoa playing Lobo in the DC Universe has been floating around for over a year following the announcement that Gunn and Safran were going to lead DC Studios. When Momoa revealed that he was working on a passion project with DC Studios, many began to speculate that he was referring to Lobo. For years, it has been known that Momoa is a massive fan of Lobo, as he has talked about his passion for the character.

However, despite this being a perfect fit for Momoa, the Aquaman actor is not officially locked in as Lobo at this point. It is possible that Momoa and DC Studios haven&#39;t formalized a deal yet or that they are waiting for some time to pass after Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom before announcing his new role in the DC Universe. Time will tell if Lobo is even on the table for him or if there is another character that Momoa will end up getting cast as in Gunn&#39;s DC Universe.






Back in 2019, the Krypton TV show almost had a Lobo spin-off series on SYFY after the character&#39;s introduction in season 2.




For the time being, as Gunn is getting ready to start filming Superman: Legacy, it might be a while before DC Studios reveal Momoa&#39;s DC Universe future. But given that he is the only Justice League actor to return from the DCEU, it says a lot about DC Studios still wanting to work with him. But for now, the world will have to wait and see how Momoa will factor into Gunn&#39;s DC Universe in the coming years.

Catch Momoa in On the Roam on Max, with the first 2 episodes premiering on January 18.
