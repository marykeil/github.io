# Oscars 2024 Robert Downey Jr. Can Avenge His 15-Year-Old Loss To Christopher Nolan... Thanks To Christopher Nolan


## SUMMARY 


 

Robert Downey Jr. could finally win an Oscar for his role in Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer, after losing to Heath Ledger in 2009.


Downey Jr.&#39;s memorable performance as Kirk Lazarus in Tropic Thunder was overshadowed by Ledger&#39;s iconic portrayal of the Joker.


Despite not even being nominated for his most famous role as Iron Man, Downey Jr.&#39;s career impact and strong performance in Oppenheimer make him a serious contender for the 2024 Best Supporting Actor Academy Award.
