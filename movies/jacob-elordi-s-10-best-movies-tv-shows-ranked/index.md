## Literature Review

From The Kissing Booth and Euphoria to Priscilla and Saltburn, Jacob Elordi’s career already includes popular hits and critically acclaimed work.




One of the best talents to come out of young Hollywood in the past five years, Jacob Elordi has locked in some stellar onscreen performances across film and television already. The Australian native started acting professionally in his 20s as an extra on film sets. He did a few short films before making his feature film debut in the Australian comedy Swinging Safari in 2018, also starring Kylie Minogue and Guy Pierce. That same year, Elordi landed his breakout role in the first installment of The Kissing Booth movies, a trilogy of Netflix original coming-of-age films.
Elordi continued to gain prominence for starring as Nate Jacobs in the cast of HBO&#39;s teen drama series Euphoria. Since then, Elordi has starred in a handful of films across different genres. He may not have the most expansive filmography just yet, but at this rate, he seems to already be in high demand. In 2023, Elordi had the best year of his career so far: he starred in three films, all of which rank highly in his overall catalog and are among some of his best works.









 








 10  The Kissing Booth 3 
Noah Flynn
        

  The Kissing Booth 3  


  Release Date    August 11, 2021     Director    Vince Marcello     Cast    Molly Ringwald , Jacob Elordi , Joey King , Maisie Richardson-Sellers , Meganne Young , Joel Courtney , Taylor Zakhar Perez    


The third and final installment in The Kissing Booth film trilogy also happens to be the worst of the three. In this concluding chapter, Elle (Joey King) is once again forced to choose between her loyalty to her boyfriend, Elordi&#39;s Noah, or her lifelong best friend (and Noah&#39;s brother), Lee (Joel Courtney), but this time, it&#39;s about her post-grad future. As she faces the tough decision between Harvard with Noah or Berkeley with Lee, Elle sends an empowering message by going to USC instead, ultimately choosing herself.
This last hurrah felt like exactly that: one final lap around the loyalty triangle to wrap up the oft-corny Netflix teen romcom saga and bid farewell. Still, The Kissing Booth 3 offers the same cheesy goodness that got viewers to tune in to the first two and made them so successful, even if it doesn&#39;t quite compare to its predecessors. As the final chapter of the franchise that put Elordi on the map, The Kissing Booth 3 warrants a spot in his top 10 projects, even if it&#39;s at the very bottom.

 9  Deep Water 
Charlie De Lisle
        

  Deep Water  


  Release Date    March 18, 2022     Director    Adrian Lyne     Cast    Ana De Armas , Lil Rel Howery , Michael Braun , Dash Mihok , Brendan C. Miller , Kristen Connolly , Jeff Pope , Rachel Blanchard , Finn Wittrock , Devyn Tyler , Grace Jenkins , Tracy Letts , Jacob Elordi , Ben Affleck , Jade Fernandez    


In 2022, Elordi starred in the erotic thriller, Deep Water, starring Ben Affleck and Ana de Armas. Co-written by Euphoria creator, Sam Levinson, Deep Water follows the Van Allens, a married couple in which the wife, Melinda (de Armas), carries out extramarital affairs that her husband, Vic (Affleck) allows to keep their marriage afloat. However, when several of Melinda&#39;s lovers start going missing, Vic becomes the prime suspect in their disappearances.
Elordi plays Charlie De Lisle, a piano teacher and one of Melinda&#39;s many lovers. Elordi&#39;s appearance in the film is brief but impactful, as he turns up dead in the pool from a suspicious drowning. Despite the thematic similarities to director Adrian Lyne&#39;s other erotic thrillers, Deep Water doesn&#39;t compare to some of his seminal and genre-defining films like Indecent Proposal and Fatal Attraction. However, for fans of the genre, or any of the top-billed movie stars featured, Deep Water is still worth a watch. Among Elordi&#39;s filmography, it ranks second to last for his minor role and not a particularly memorable performance.





 8  The Kissing Booth 2 
Noah Flynn
        

  The Kissing Booth 2  


  Release Date    July 24, 2020     Director    Vince Marcello     Cast    Molly Ringwald , Taylor Perez , Joey King , Maisie Richardson-Sellers , Jacob Elordi , Joel Courtney    


In 2020, Elordi reprised his role as Noah in The Kissing Booth 2, the follow-up to the 2018 coming-of-age Netflix original that had viewers hooked. In the sequel, Elle and Noah&#39;s long-distance relationship proves to be an obstacle as she juggles their poor communication skills as a couple, her college applications, and her romantic tension with the new kid, Marco. By the end of The Kissing Booth 2, Elle and Noah are still together and it successfully sets up Elle&#39;s college conflict in the final movie.
Though it never quite lived up to the first movie, The Kissing Booth 2 is a worthy sequel that manages to deliver drama, laughs, and many of the same romance tropes like unconventional love triangles and miscommunication mishaps that made viewers fall in love with the first. The Kissing Booth 2 ultimately ranks lower than the first movie, and the rest of Elordi&#39;s top 10, because it&#39;s too bogged down with intertwining subplots, and can&#39;t help but live in the shadow of its better predecessor.





 7  2 Hearts 
Chris
        

In 2020, Elordi landed a lead role in the romantic drama, 2 Hearts. Based on a true story, 2 Hearts is a tale of two seemingly unrelated but paralleled love stories that take place in completely different places and periods. One of these love stories takes place between two college students, Chris (Elordi), who also narrates the story, and Sam (Tiera Skovbye). The film plays with chronology by cutting back and forth from past to present to foreshadow the pivotal future events.
Despite receiving less than favorable critical reviews, 2 Hearts was a hit with audiences. It maintains an 87% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes compared to its 17% critical score. 2 Hearts clearly resonates with viewers, and it fulfills its tear-jerking promise by the end. Elordi will always shine as a romantic lead and 2 Hearts is no exception. It doesn&#39;t quite live up to the first Kissing Booth on his roster, but it&#39;s up there.





 6  The Kissing Booth 
Noah Flynn
        

  The Kissing Booth  


  Release Date    May 11, 2018     Director    Vince Marcello     Cast    Molly Ringwald , Joey King , Jacob Elordi , Joel Courtney     Genres    Romance , Comedy    


Despite its sequels&#39; best efforts, the first Kissing Booth movie remains the best of the trilogy. Based on the book series by Beth Reekles, 2018&#39;s The Kissing Booth depicts the origin of Elle and Noah&#39;s relationship, which they kept hidden from Lee for fear of ruining Elle and Lee&#39;s friendship. Lee eventually gives them his blessing, and despite (or perhaps because of) its predictable premise and ending, The Kissing Booth solidified itself in the teen rom-com canon.
While Euphoria launched him into the spotlight, it was through The Kissing Booth that audiences got acquainted with Elordi, who played the forbidden bad boy brother of the female lead&#39;s best friend. His performance isn&#39;t anything to write home about, but The Kissing Booth did put him in the public eye in a much wider scope, for which it deserves some credit. As its film, The Kissing Booth provided the perfect foundation for multiple sequels while still managing to never be outshined by its follow-ups. It may not be up there with his absolute best work, but it certainly outranks the sequels and a few of Elordi&#39;s lesser projects.





 5  The Mortuary Collection 
Jake
        

In 2019, the same year Elordi first appeared in Euphoria and gained major recognition, he also had a role in Ryan Spindell&#39;s anthology horror film, The Mortuary Collection. The film is comprised of four segments, all of which are horror stories told by a mortician to a prospective employee during a job interview and tour of his mortuary. In the second segment titled &#34;Unprotected,&#34; Elordi plays Jake, a frat boy from the 1960s who faces some extremely gory and unexpected consequences for secretly removing the condom during sex with a girl named Sandra (Ema Horvath).
The Mortuary Collection manages to pull off the intimidating horror anthology structure with a consistent lineup of gruesome tales. The film also boasts an unusually high critical score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes, with many reviews praising its impressive ability to maintain high quality through each segment. The Mortuary Collection is a truly underrated gem for fans of horror and anthology stories alike and stands out amongst Elordi&#39;s filmography.





 4  The Sweet East 
Ian
        

  The Sweet East  


  Release Date    May 18, 2023     Director    Sean Price Williams     Cast    Talia Ryder , Earl Cave , Simon Rex , Ayo Edebiri , Jeremy O. Harris , Jacob Elordi , Rish Shah    


The first of Elordi&#39;s 2023 films is Sean Price Williams&#39; directorial debut, The Sweet East. In an Alice in Wonderland-esque tale set against the backdrop of modern-day America, The Sweet East follows a high school senior named Lillian (Talia Ryder), who gets separated from her classmates during a school trip to Washington, D.C. and ends up on a journey through various cities across the United States. Lillian encounters various bizarre characters, including Elordi&#39;s Ian, Lillian&#39;s co-star in a movie she stumbles into on one of her various quests.
Serving as both a social commentary and visual feast, The Sweet East is a bold and daring adventure that isn&#39;t afraid to take risks even when they don&#39;t pay off. The satirical whirlwind of a film keeps the audience on their toes for its duration. Among Elordi&#39;s 2023 projects, The Sweet East ranks the lowest of the three, but the wonderfully weird cinematic fever dream is still high up the ranks of his overall catalog for being unlike anything else the actor has ever starred in.





 3  Saltburn 
Felix Catton


 







  Saltburn  


  Release Date    November 17, 2023     Director    Emerald Fennell     Cast    Barry Keoghan , Jacob Elordi , Rosamund Pike , Richard E. Grant , Alison Oliver , Archie Madekwe , Carey Mulligan    


Elordi continued to impress in 2023 with his role as the effortlessly charming Felix Catton in Emerald Fennell&#39;s psychological thriller Saltburn. Felix is a student at Oxford University who comes from the absurdly wealthy Catton family. As summer approaches, Felix invites his new seemingly harmless friend, Oliver (Barry Keoghan) to stay with him at his family&#39;s Saltburn estate. As the veil of Oliver&#39;s lies begins to lift, Felix starts to see his true colors.
As a whole, Saltburn is a wild ride with some particularly enticing moments. It alsofeatures some phenomenal performances, not excluding Elordi, who brings a lovable innocence to the spoiled Felix. Compared to most of Elordi&#39;s filmography, Saltburn delivers a more coherent and compelling finished product, for which it warrants a third-place ranking among his finest work.
            
 
 Saltburn Cast &amp; Character Guide 
Since Saltburn&#39;s compelling drama is primarily driven by its well-written character beats, one cannot help but wonder who plays whom in the movie.








 2  Euphoria 
Nate Jacobs


 







  Euphoria  


  Release Date    June 16, 2019     Cast    Storm Reid , Jacob Elordi , Maude Apatow , Hunter Schafer , Zendaya , Barbie Ferreira , Alexa Demie , Nika King , Colman Domingo , Eric Dane , Sydney Sweeney , Angus Cloud , Algee Smith     Genres    Drama     Seasons    2     Showrunner    Sam Levinson    


In 2019, Elordi captivated and terrified audiences on Euphoria with his bone-chilling role as Nate Jacobs, an abusive high school student. Based on an Israeli miniseries of the same name, Euphoria follows a group of Gen Z teenagers, led by struggling drug addict Rue Bennett (Zendaya). Season 1 of Euphoria was a smash hit: it balanced complex themes like abuse, addiction, gender exploration, and mental illness with stunning visuals and a hauntingly beautiful score.
Unfortunately, Euphoria dropped significantly in quality with season 2, which premiered in 2022. Though it started strong with a New Year&#39;s Eve episode that rounded up all the leads in a house party setting, the season took a major nose dive from there. It had its high points, like the Rue-centred fifth episode, but overall, it couldn&#39;t compare to season 1. Regardless, as a whole, Euphoria is still Elordi&#39;s second-best project. He gives an almost too-good performance as a twisted, tortured teenage boy reckoning with his own desire. Had it not been so unbalanced, Euphoria might have ranked in the top spot.
            
 
 Euphoria Season 3: Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know 
Euphoria season 2 ended its eight-episode run more popular than ever before and with a long wait until season 3, here&#39;s everything we know about it.








 1  Priscilla 
Elvis Presley


 







  Priscilla  


  Release Date    October 1, 2023     Director    Sofia Coppola     Cast    Cailee Spaeny , Jacob Elordi , Dagmara Dominczyk    


Finally, the best project in Elordi&#39;s catalogue is 2023&#39;s Priscilla. Based on Priscilla Presley&#39;s 1985 memoir Elvis and Me,  Sofia Coppola&#39;s Priscilla tells the story of the eponymous ex-wife of Elvis Presley and the development of their tumultuous relationship. As a biopic, Priscilla flips the script on the traditional narrative by telling the story from the perspective of Elvis&#39; much younger wife and depicting a raw and darker side of him in doing so.
Elordi stars as Elvis himself, with Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla. Though the comparisons between Elordi and Elvis (2022)&#39;s Austin Butler as Elvis Presley were inevitable, Elordi&#39;s rendition brings a new and refreshing spin on the music legend. Elordi&#39;s Elvis felt natural and grounded in reality, while also exposing his controlling tendencies. Overall, Priscilla is a harrowing and revealing tale of fame and abuse and delivers one of Elordi&#39;s best performances to date. It&#39;s more consistent in quality while still maintaining entertainment value than any of Jacob Elordi&#39;s other films or his TV series.
