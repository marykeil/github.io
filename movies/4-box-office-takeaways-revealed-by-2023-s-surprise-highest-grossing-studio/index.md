## Literature Review

The highest-grossing movie studio of 2023 highlights some of the year&#39;s key box office takeaways that led to so many financially successful films.




The 2023 box office had plenty of key takeaways, with the year&#39;s highest-grossing movie studio revealing the key ingredients to success. As reported by Screen Rant, Universal beat Disney to become the top studio at 2023&#39;s box office. It is a huge triumph for Universal Pictures, managing to reclaim the top spot for the first time since 2015. While there were a few underperforming films in their 2023 calendar, there were far more hits, proving the studio did something right this year. A few major films provided plenty towards their overall box office, but Universal managed to do some other key things right in 2023.
Universal was able to beat its competition, with the likes of Disney having no $1 billion box office movies for the first time since 2014. The 2023 box office proved that studios like Disney were struggling, while Universal came up with a winning formula. Between their calculated risks as well as investing heavily in safe projects, Universal Pictures revealed some of the biggest takeaways from the year. Studios don&#39;t always learn from their mistakes, but previous years have allowed Universal to rethink their strategy and provide not only some of the most financially successful movies of 2023, but several high-quality, and potentially award-winning films.









 








 1  Universalâ€™s Christopher Nolan Gamble Was Instrumental To Its Success 
Oppenheimer Came With Plenty Of Risk Despite Becoming One Of The Biggest Films Of 2023


 







By far, Universal&#39;s biggest success story was the studio&#39;s gamble on Christopher Nolan and Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer smashed box office records, became the third highest-grossing film of 2023, and is an Oscar contender in many categories. It is undoubtedly one of the year&#39;s most popular movies and Universal&#39;s gamble paid off massively. Although it didn&#39;t become the top financial hit of 2023, it is ironically fitting as Oppenheimer is also the highest-grossing non-number one film at the box office. It never reached the number one spot domestically and didn&#39;t top the box office come the end of the year, but Oppenheimer was still a huge success.
Non-franchise films have struggled at the box office at the best of times in recent years, yet Oppenheimer had an even harder sales pitch. A three-hour, R-rated biopic doesn&#39;t sound too appealing on paper for most studios, but Universal&#39;s investment in Oppenheimer worked in their favor. The Barbenheimer campaign also helped the movie grow to unprecedented heights, gaining traction alongside Barbie, which even helped the film outgross every sequel and superhero movie produced in 2023. Oppenheimer helped Universal top the 2023 box office, and it is a lesson for other studios that taking on these riskier projects can work out when done correctly.
            
 
 Bob Iger&#39;s Defense Of Disney&#39;s 2023 Box Office Failures Proven Wrong... By The 2023 Box Office 
Disney CEO, Bob Iger, gave a strong opinion about movies with messages. However, 2023&#39;s box office perfectly highlights that Iger is wrong.








 2  Investment In Video Game Adaptations Is Finally Paying Off 
Universal Cashed In On The Growth Of Video Game Adaptations
        

Video game adaptations have been a risky investment, to say the least, but this risk finally paid off for Universal. Super Mario is one of the largest gaming franchises in the world, hence why Universal chose to make a movie about the gaming series. Unlike the 1993 failed Mario movie, this project was animated and was much better for it. The Super Mario Bros. Movie made over $1 billion at the 2023 box office and, for a while, was the highest-grossing film of the year until Barbie overtook it. The same movie that helped Oppenheimer do so well is ironically the one that denied Universal the highest-grossing movie of 2023.
Although such a high-profile franchise working in a cinematic environment may seem obvious, Universal had to be creative to make such a linear game work. They also proved their gaming adaptations weren&#39;t a one-hit wonder. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s was also a big hit for Universal, making just under $300 million despite having a $20 million budget. FNAF has also become a huge franchise in the gaming world, but its cult following wasn&#39;t a guarantee it would do well. In the end, these gaming movies proved to be two of Universal&#39;s best-selling films, which is yet another takeaway studios can learn from.





 3  Fast &amp; Furious Is Still Profitable Despite Fast X&#39;s Underwhelming Performance 
Fast X Wasn&#39;t The Triumph Universal Were Looking For But It Still Made Money
        

Fast &amp; Furious is one of Universal Pictures&#39; most iconic modern franchises and while it may not be the Hollywood powerhouse it once was, Fast &amp; Furious is still profitable. The latest installment, Fast X, was the fifth highest-grossing film of the year, which would make it seem like an instant win for Universal. However, it isn&#39;t that simple. Fast X&#39;s box office breakdown shows that it made $704 million from a $340 million budget. After the theater cuts and advertising costs, the movie is still profitable, but it is not quite the same success that it looks at first glance.
After ten films and a spinoff movie, it is no surprise Fast &amp; Furious&#39; star power has started to dwindle, but there is still life left in the franchise. Since Fast X is not the end of the movie series, Fast &amp; Furious 11 or a potential twelfth film should put an end to the main series for good, which could result in a box office boost once again. Fast &amp; Furious has always been a bit of a safe bet for the studio, and utilizing this has helped 2023 be so profitable. Universal continuing to use its most reliable franchise shows the importance of having a big blockbuster movie series to rely on.





 4  New IPs Were Key To Universal&#39;s 2023 Success 
Universal Had Plenty Of New Creations That Found Box Office Success
        

One of the key parts of 2023 being so strong for Universal was the creation of new IPs. The addition of gaming movies alongside hit franchises like Fast &amp; Furious worked well. The Exorcist reboot, The Exorcist: Believer, also had a good box office outing, but new projects were critical for the studio. M3gan was one of the surprise hits of 2023, making Universal a healthy profit. M3gan&#39;s box office profit showcased why it is worth investing in new properties, even if they are a gamble. The film grossed over $180 million despite costing just $12 million to make.
Cocaine Bear and Knock at the Cabin are some of Universal&#39;s other 2023 triumphs, proving that big franchises aren&#39;t the only way to make money. These films are all so different from one another and are also pretty unique in comparison to what is usually released. Universal&#39;s new movies, alongside the more franchise-focused hits, all helped achieve an incredible 2023 for the studio. The combination of calculated risk-taking as well as surefire projects is the reason Universal Pictures was so successful and is the sort of lesson that other studios could learn from in 2024.
