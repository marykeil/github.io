## Literature Review

Role Play&#39;s action leaves a lot to be desired, but it excels thanks to the character-driven story that explores the humanity of its characters.




Directed by Thomas Vincent from a screenplay by Seth Owen, Role Play follows Emma, a seemingly ordinary working suburban mom, and Dave, a supportive, loving husband, as the two dabble in some sexy role play to spice up their marriage. Little does Dave know that role play is something Emma is very familiar with, since she is an assassin for hire.




As True Lies becomes a distant reference point, Mr. and Mrs. Smith is likely the standard Role Play will be held to. In the 2005 actioner, John and Jane are skilled and dangerous operatives concealing their identity from each other. The married duo upholds their marriage to protect what they have and hide in plain sight. The movie wasn&#39;t necessarily the first of its kind, but it was a touchstone for films trying to replicate its success; recently, 2023&#39;s Ghosted attempted such a feat. Role Play is a more mature, tactful version of Ghosted. And while it&#39;ll draw comparisons to both films, Prime Video has an actual hit on their hands.

               6 / 10   Role Play is a Prime Video original action film starring Kaley Cuoco and David Oyelowo. The movie follows a married couple whose lives become very complicated when dark secrets from their past come to life. The film is directed by Thomas Vincent, who previously worked on Possessions, Bodyguard, and Reacher.    Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    Thomas Vincent     Cast    Kaley Cuoco , David Oyelowo , Connie Nielsen , Bill Nighy     Rating    R     Runtime    100 Minutes     Genres    Action , Thriller     Writers    Andrew Baldwin , Seth W. Owen     Studio(s)    Le Studio Canal&#43; , Yes, Norman Productions , The Picture Company     Distributor(s)    Prime Video      


 Kaley Cuoco &amp; David Oyelowo&#39;s Onscreen Dynamic Really Sells The Film&#39;s Premise 
         




Cuoco and Oyelowo are delights to watch and have tangible chemistry, and though it screams more platonic than romantic, it endears us to the film more due to its humorous nature. The role of Emma had the danger of being a stereotypical femme fatale, and the actress could have easily played it that way, but she imbues Emma with a sense of humor, warmth, and authenticity that the average actress would have avoided in favor of a vapid depiction of an assassin. To complement her performance is Oyelowo, who is given the space to lighten up and freely engage with the absurdity of the premise.



The film attempts to uncover the humanity behind the suburban mom who moonlights as an assassin, and it&#39;s successful in that regard.




The two work very well together, painting a picture of a couple with mutual respect, openly embracing their idiosyncrasies and a shared sense of humor. A key scene where the two come face-to-face for the first time following the revelation doubles down on this perception, as Emma reveals that Dave&#39;s ability to make her laugh is what led her to fall in love with him. Cuoco, who has an innate ability to transform depending on the situation, nails the quiet desperation that lurks behind her steely gaze as she professes this to a shaken Dave. The two are complete opposites, but are totally in sync.

 Role Play Has Heart - It&#39;s Not A Lazy Repackaging Of Similar Films 

 

The film moves briskly, not dwelling on the intricacies of the couple&#39;s life before diving into the meat of the story. Role Play is funny in a quiet, chuckle-to-yourself kind of way, but it is nevertheless entertaining and sweet. The action does leave a lot to be desired, but once you understand that this is more character-driven than action-driven, you can quickly forgive and enjoy the ride. The film attempts to uncover the humanity behind the suburban mom who moonlights as an assassin, and it&#39;s successful in that regard.




The script allows us to understand the characters&#39; dynamic, touching upon their shared values and love for their children. The latter aren’t overused but are helpful details that flesh out Emma&#39;s life, adding credence to her desperate attempt to stop the impending implosion. Where something like Ghosted felt contrived and vague, Role Play does its due diligence to make the audience like its characters and believe in their romance. The film could have easily shelled out for baseless cameos, but instead has a delightful Bill Nighy chewing up his short and sweet scenes. Similarly, Connie Nielsen is immaculate as a poorly disguised villain.

Role Play is poorly timed as a January release — it&#39;s clearly better suited for Valentine&#39;s Day, and it would be a shame for an engaging and charming film to fly under the radar. It&#39;s the right amount of romantic, funny, and thrilling, and it does what it needs to do to make its narrative feel less derivative and more dynamic and fun.
