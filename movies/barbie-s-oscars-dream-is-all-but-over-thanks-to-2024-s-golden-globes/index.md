# Barbie s Oscars Dream Is All But Over Thanks To 2024 s Golden Globes


## SUMMARY 



  Despite its critical and audience success, Barbie was snubbed in multiple categories at the Golden Globes, which is a bad sign for its Oscars hopes.   The limited number of awards at the Golden Globes and the event&#39;s more lighthearted nature make Barbie&#39;s loss even more disappointing.   Barbie was already unlikely to win major Oscars due to its flamboyant tone, PG-13 rating, and mass-market appeal conflicting with the Oscars&#39; conservative reputation.

## Literature Review

Due to its popular and critical acclaim, many felt that Barbie would do well at the 2024 Oscars. However, its Golden Globes performance suggests not.




Although many felt Barbie was all but guaranteed success at the 2024 Oscars ceremony, the results of the Golden Globes suggest that things aren&#39;t looking good for Greta Gerwig&#39;s hit film. Barbie was met with critical and audience acclaim when it opened in the summer of 2023. Boasting an aggregate Rotten Tomatoes score of 88% and making over $1.4 billion at the box office, the film was one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, becoming a certified cultural phenomenon. Given this impact, hopes were high ahead of the awards season.




While final Oscars nominations are yet to be confirmed, Barbie has already been shortlisted in several categories. The film has a total of five nominations, including three submissions for Best Original Song, one for Best Sound, and another for Best Original Score. With many more categories still to be announced, the early signs were good that Barbie (starring previous Oscar nominee Margot Robbie) would have a successful night at the 96th Academy Awards. However, the 2024 Golden Globes results, which can provide an early benchmark ahead of other major ceremonies, seem to spell bad news for the film.

 Barbie&#39;s Golden Globes 2024 Haul Is A Bad Sign For Its Oscars Hopes 
         




Despite popular acclaim, Barbie was snubbed in seven out of nine nominations at the Golden Globes ceremony. The movie failed to win either Best Motion Picture – Musical/Comedy, or Best Performance by a Female Actor – Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy, losing both to Yorgos Lanthimos&#39; off-beat macabre comedy Poor Things. Barbie also fell short in Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role – Motion Picture, Best Director – Motion Picture, and Best Screenplay – Motion Picture, only winning Best Song – Motion Picture, and Best Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.

Both the limited number of awards and the context of the Golden Globes make this haul a major disappointment. Historically, the Golden Globes have been generally regarded as a more lighthearted affair than the conservative Oscars ceremony, making a movie like Barbie more likely to succeed at the January event. The fact that it was beaten even here suggests that its chances are slim ahead of March. While many commentators predicted that Poor Things would itself be too quirky for the Oscars, its early success suggests that it may be a stronger candidate than many realized – perhaps at Barbie&#39;s expense.






 Barbie Was Already Unlikely To Win Any Major Oscars In 2024 
          

Although the movie&#39;s poor performance at the Golden Globes may have been difficult to predict, Barbie was already unlikely to have a strong showing at the 2024 Oscars. For starters, in the early round of nominations, the film was surprisingly snubbed for Best Makeup and Hairstyling – an indication perhaps that the judging panel is already reluctant to recognize it as a contender. Coupled with the Oscars&#39; somewhat stuffy reputation, a movie with Barbie&#39;s distinctive flamboyant tone, PG-13 rating, and mass-market appeal was perhaps always unlikely to be taken seriously – however unfair this assessment may be in reality.
