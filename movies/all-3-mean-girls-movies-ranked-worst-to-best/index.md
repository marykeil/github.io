## Literature Review

With there now being three Mean Girls movies, a clear hierarchy has emerged of which ones are worth the watch and which ones didn&#39;t need to happen. 




With Mean Girls being one of the most popular and iconic teenage comedies in movie history, it is natural to compare it to the other two films that spawned from it. Released in 2004, Mean Girls was the brainchild of comedian Tina Fey, who managed to create a global phenomenon with her social commentary on the American high school experience. Since the movie&#39;s release, it has been a cultural staple, with audiences continuing to reference some of the most iconic Mean Girls quotes. The film&#39;s popularity continues to grow, and there was even a Broadway musical that was created based on the original movie.
That Broadway musical was then turned into a film that was released in January of 2024. The movie was highly anticipated, as audiences looked to see how it changed the original Mean Girlsto fit with modern times. This musical rendition was not the only follow-up to the original Mean Girls, as there was a direct-to-TV sequel released in 2011. Because of how beloved the original film is, it&#39;s not surprising that viewers have had high standards for projects that build off of it. While some franchises are made more successful by follow-up projects, Mean Girls is one whose general sentiment is to let it stand on its own. With the release of the follow-up films, there is a clear hierarchy that has emerged of which ones are films worth watching and which ones should have been left on the drawing board.

Mean Girls 2 was a long-awaited follow-up to Mean Girls, but unfortunately, it was not able to come close to the original. The film feels like a weak attempt to try to capture the hilarity and originality of the first film, and it ultimately lacked the sharp wit that made Mean Girls a phenomenon. The storyline ended up feeling predictable and formulaic, and the new characters weren&#39;t able to live up to their predecessors. They felt one-dimensional and clichéd and brought down the overall film. In addition, Mean Girls 2 just didn&#39;t have the resources that the original did to make it such a success. It was a direct-to-tv sequel made for ABC Family, which meant that it didn&#39;t have the same budget as the first Mean Girls.

Part of what makes 2024&#39;s Mean Girls a strong addition to the franchise is that it was not trying to simply recreate the original but instead add a new twist to it. The film welcomed back the comedic mind of Tina Fey and incorporated musical numbers that added a new layer to the well-known story. While the movie was definitely directed toward newer audiences, it managed to incorporate a number of moments that captured the spirit of the original Mean Girls. Reneé Rapp does an excellent job of bringing the catty and iconic character of Regina George to life in a new way with a fresh spin. In addition, Avantika Vandanpu&#39;s amazing performance as Karen Shetty was a standout. 2024&#39;s Mean Girls didn&#39;t live up to the original film, but it also wasn&#39;t trying to which is why it comfortably sits in second place.

The Mean Girls franchise proves that oftentimes it doesn&#39;t get better than the original. Mean Girls has managed to be a pop culture phenomenon for decades and continues to be a film people reference constantly. The characters and storylines felt new and exciting and have stood the test of time in terms of still being relevant. Though released in the early 2000s, the movie tackles universal high school experiences that make it a strong watch to do this day. On the flip side, Mean Girls also has the nostalgia factor going for it, as the fashion, music, and technology depicted in it remind viewers of a specific and memorable era.
The satirical lens that Mean Girls takes on allows for social commentary that feels natural rather than preachy. It touches on important issues such as body image, bullying, and the consequences of conformity. This allows for the movie to not only serve as a lighthearted and humorous watch but also one that can portray an important message. The film does have moments that don&#39;t live up to the more rigid standards viewers have for content when it comes to things like body image and bullying, but these serve as conversation-starters and present the opportunity for younger viewers to see what is not acceptable.
