## Literature Review



Grammy-winning artist Ciara plays a small but significant role in The Color Purple musical, the latest on-screen adaptation of Alice Walker&#39;s 1982 classic novel. The Color Purple follows the journey of a young Black girl named Celie from childhood to adulthood as she encounters many hardships living in the Southern United States in the early 1900s. Based on the Tony Award-winning Broad musical, The Color Purple (2023) brings Celie&#39;s harrowing story to the big screen for a new generation, serving as the second film adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel after Steven Spielberg&#39;s The Color Purple movie in 1985.




The cast of The Color Purple (2023) is stacked with incredible talent. Fantasia Barrino stars in the lead role as Celie, with Phylicia Pearl Mpasi playing the younger version of the character. The cast also features Taraji P. Henson as Shug Avery, Danielle Brooks as Sofia, Colman Domingo as Mister, Corey Hawkins as Harpo, H.E.R. as Squeak, and many more. Spielberg also serves as a producer on the 2023 film, along with Oprah Winfrey, who played Sofia in Spielberg&#39;s original movie. Toward the end of 2023&#39;s The Color Purple, Ciara also makes an appearance as a familiar character.
