## Literature Review

Kieran Culkin has always had the star power to lead fantastic films &amp; TV series. His greatest roles over the years showcase this talent &amp; ability. 




Now that Kieran Culkin has been receiving such high praise and recognition for his role as Roman Roy in HBO&#39;s Succession, it&#39;s a reminder that he has many excellent roles in film and television dating back to the beginning of his career. Though Culkin was not an enormous star before he was cast in Succession, he did make his name with several high-profile works, as well as projects that have become cult classics in the years since their release. Though not always cast in the leading role, Culkin easily steals scenes and makes himself a memorable part of the cast.
His performance of Roman may lead audiences to believe that Culkin has always been type-cast as the neurotic wise guy, but he has been known to explore deeply sensitive themes, especially in his early work. Like his brother, Macaulay Culkin, who starred in Home Alone, Kieran Culkin got his start as a child actor and developed his skills from there. He displayed great range from an early age, which allowed him to test the waters in terms of the genres and roles he was most interested in. In the future, he will certainly continue his trend of picking smart and compelling characters.

Kieran Culkin has stepped out of his brother Macaulay&#39;s shadow and raised his own star. At Rotten Tomatoes, these are his best movies.












 








 10  Margaret (2011) 
As Paul
        

Culkin&#39;s Succession co-star J. Smith Cameron also appears in Margaret, an intense coming-of-age drama that explores the life of a teenage girl in the aftermath of a bus accident that she partially caused. He has a small part as Paul, a secondary love interest for protagonist Lisa (Anna Paquin). Due to his youth and inexperience, much like Lisa&#39;s own, he doesn&#39;t have the emotional awareness to understand what she&#39;s going through, so the pair have a difficult time connecting.
It&#39;s a softer and less taxing role than the others in the film, but it&#39;s a much-needed respite to the high drama going on in the rest of the plot. Despite the short screen time, Culkin provides an effective foil to Lisa&#39;s tortured character. Where she rejects the innocence and joy of youth because of the accident, Culkin is able to embody it and show what she&#39;s missing.





 9  The Cider House Rules (1999) 
As Buster


 







The Cider House Rules portrays complex issues and the trials of coming-of-age in an atmospheric and unique package. Based on the novel of the same name by John Irving, the film is set during World War II at an orphanage in Maine. Culkin plays Buster, an older boy living at the orphanage who takes care of the younger boys and looks up to Homer (Tobey Maguire), the protagonist. Though Homer leaves, Buster is still too young and must stay to be a role model for the other children. Despite being so young when playing Buster, Culkin imbues the role with sensitivity, becoming a source of joy within the orphanage.





 8  The Dangerous Lives Of Altar Boys (2002) 
As Tim Sullivan
        

The titular altar boys in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys are unafraid to make their mark and rebel from the strict teachings of the Catholic school they attend. As Tim Sullivan, Culkin is part of a group of friends who find ways of expressing themselves through art, pranks, and rock music. Although the boys put up a front of not caring about the repressive forces in their lives, they struggle to fit in and find themselves in their environment.
Tim is no different, but is shown time and again to be a supportive and loyal friend to the other boys. It&#39;s in this film that Culkin starts to emerge from his child star roots and begins to be taken seriously as an actor. Though he still has his youthful innocence and energy, the things he goes through are much more adult and tragic. He is no longer used entirely for comedic relief, or as a symbol of youth, but as a fully-fledged person.





 7  Lymelife (2008) 
As Jimmy Bartlett
        

In Lymelife, Culkin teams up with his younger brother, Rory Culkin, as brothers in the film. Kiernan Culkin plays Jimmy, the older brother who returns home from the army to find the family in a mess of interpersonal drama. His performance gives insight into Scott&#39;s (Rory Culkin) behavior, as Jimmy has often played the role of protector. It&#39;s the parents who create the biggest mess, and the children, like Jimmy, must step up and fend for themselves. Jimmy has a lot of anger in the film, and though his real-life brotherly love for Scott comes through, he balances it well with the rage of a child who feels abandoned.





 6  Wiener-Dog (2016) 
As Brandon
        

Told in a loose series of vignettes, Wiener-Dog stars Culkin as part of the ensemble cast with Greta Gerwig as his story&#39;s companion. His character, Brandon, is a drug addict whose father recently died due to complications with alcoholism. He and Dawn (Gerwig) attempt to rekindle their relationship, but it&#39;s clear that they both are lost in life and have a lot of growing to do before they can commit to anyone. Somewhere between a coming-of-age role and one of someone struggling with adulthood, Culkin&#39;s performance makes it hard not to root for him and hope that, given time and support, he&#39;ll make it out of his hardships.





 5  Infinity Baby (2017) 
As Ben


 







Infinity Baby has a concept that seems impossible, but the performances ground the film and make it worth the watch. Culkin plays Ben, one of the many characters who are disillusioned with their lives, and trying to do something about it. Though an adult, Ben wishes for nothing more than to not grow up and return to the comfort and simplicity of childhood. He&#39;s at his best as a sarcastic cynic who can&#39;t find it in himself to commit to anyone or anything. The good news is, that only makes it more satisfying when he finally realizes how great it can be to grow up.





 4  Fargo - Season 2 (2014 - ) 
As Rye Gerhardt
        

  Fargo  


  Release Date    April 15, 2014     Genres    Anthology , Crime , Drama , Comedy , Thriller     Rating    TV-MA     Seasons    5     Writers    Noah Hawley     Network    FX     Streaming Service(s)    Hulu     Franchise(s)    Fargo    


Considered one of the best seasons of the anthology TV show Fargo, season 2 features Culkin in his most outlandish and memorable characters. Rye Gerhardt is the victim at the center of the season-long investigation, as he is the son of a notorious crime boss who is killed in a murder by car. He is only a guest star, as he is killed off so quickly, but his presence is felt by the killers and the investigators alike throughout the whole season. It takes skill to make a short-lived character so prominent, but Culkin has never had trouble taking up space on-screen, and nor should he.





 3  Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World (2010) 
As Wallace Wells
        

  Scott Pilgrim vs. the World  


  Release Date    August 13, 2010     Director    Edgar Wright     Cast    Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Brandon Routh , Kieran Culkin , Aubrey Plaza , Anna Kendrick , Jason Schwartzman , Alison Pill , Brie Larson , Chris Evans , Michael Cera     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    112 minutes     Genres    Action , Romance , Fantasy , Comedy     Writers    Edgar Wright , Michael Bacall     Story By    Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley     Budget    $60 million     Studio(s)    Marc Platt Productions , Big Talk Films ,  d on Mondays Entertainment , Dentsu     Franchise(s)    Scott Pilgrim    


Edgar Wright&#39;s 2010 adaptation of the beloved comic, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World stands out for its style, editing, and fantastic performances by a hilarious cast. Wallace (Culkin) is Scott&#39;s friend and roommate who provides fantastic commentary on the wild events of Scott&#39;s life. As one of the more mainstream projects he has been a part of, most audience members recognize the grown-up Culkin from his work on the film, which helped establish the wry wit he is known to bring to every role. Along with the rest of the cast, Culkin does an excellent job bringing the comic character to life and has plenty of fun doing it.

 2  Igby Goes Down (2002) 
As Igby
        

Igby Goes Down is a quiet film that has flown under the radar since its release in 2002, but that&#39;s a shame because it&#39;s one of Culkin&#39;s best performances to date. Igby (Culkin) doesn&#39;t have an easy time in the world and his distant dysfunctional family is no help as he struggles to find a connection in the world. Shunted from place to place, Igby seeks solace in romantic partners, parental figures, and anyone available, but still pushes them away, or is pushed, when it counts. In the sometimes brutal film, Culkin manages to make the audience feel deeply for the reflective Igby, who has too many walls up.





 1  Succession (2018 - 2023) 
As Roman Roy


 







  Succession  


  Release Date    June 3, 2018     Cast    Hiam Abbass , Alan Ruck , Sarah Snook , Kieran Culkin , Natalie Gold , Nicholas Braun , J. Smith-Cameron , Matthew Macfadyen , Peter Friedman , Brian Cox , Arian Moayed , Jeremy Strong , Rob Yang , Dagmara Dominczyk     Genres    Drama , Comedy     Seasons    3     Story By    jesse armstrong     Writers    Jesse Armstrong     Network    HBO Max     Streaming Service(s)    HBO Max     Directors    Mark Mylod     Showrunner    Jesse Armstrong    


Perverse, well-written, and comically tragic, Roman Roy is a career-making character who will doubtlessly define Culkin in the remainder of his work. As one of the obscenely wealthy Roy children and potential heir to his father&#39;s media empire, the immature Roman is constantly trying to prove himself and distinguish himself from his siblings. Though every season has plenty of twists in store for the Roy children, season 4 is especially hard on Roman, but Culkin knocks the performances out of the park.
In the shocking conclusion of season 4, the final scenes for Kendall, Roman, and Shiv in Succession all reveal something different about the future of the characters. Based on Culkin&#39;s performance, Roman has truly become disillusioned with the games of the industry and his family, but can&#39;t stop himself from wanting his father&#39;s approval, even when it&#39;s too late. Throughout the series, Culkin has been singled out as a vital part of the show&#39;s dynamic, and it&#39;s obvious that no one else could have been Roman Roy.
