## Literature Review

The live-action How To Train Your Dragon reboot is bringing back Gerard Butler to play Hiccup&#39;s dad, marking the first voice star to return.




While two new stars are taking over the movie&#39;s lead roles, the How to Train Your Dragon live-action reboot has set Gerard Butler to return as Hiccup&#39;s dad. Butler starred in the DreamWorks Animation trilogy as Stoick the Vast, the chieftan of the central village who initially is vehemently opposed to the titular creatures and conflicts with his son in an effort to prepare him to take over the leadership role. Stoick ultimately realizes the beauty of the dragons thanks to Hiccup and forming a unique bond between them and the village, though is killed in the second movie as he sacrifices himself to save his son.




As development continues on the project ahead of its 2025 release, Deadline has brought word that Butler has been confirmed for the How to Train Your Dragon live-action reboot. The Greenland star is set to reprise his role as Stoick for the movie, joining a roster that already includes The Black Phone&#39;s Mason Thames as Hiccup and The Last of Us&#39; Nico Parker as Astrid. No production start date has been confirmed as of the time of writing.


 Butler&#39;s Casting Opens The Door For More How To Train Your Dragon Returns 
         

While much of the animated movies&#39; cast felt perfect for their roles, few felt better picked than Butler as Stoick in the original How to Train Your Dragon movies. Set in a mystical Viking world, the star&#39;s natural Scottish voice lent a real sense of power and heart to the character, nicely balancing his gruff determination as the village chieftan as well as his genuine desire to see his son grow and take his place. This also proved a fitting approach to the character when it came to exploring his darker nature, including his initial hatred of dragons and his own tragic past. 




With Butler now back for the movie, the question becomes whether the live-action How to Train Your Dragon reboot will feature more returning stars from the animated efforts. Given many of the main cast of characters were teenagers, those voiced by adult actors already seem unlikely to be similarly reprised, especially considering the lead roles of Hiccup and Astrid have already been recast with new stars. That being said, it would be interesting to see if writer/director Dean DeBlois finds a way to include other actors as a touching nod to longtime fans of the franchise. 



DeBlois was also the writer/director of the animated How to Train Your Dragon movies, having co-written/co-directed the first with Chris Sanders and Will Davies before working solo on the subsequent sequels.




Whether this be simple cameos in the central village or full characters created for said actors, should audiences prove excited by the announcement of Butler&#39;s return in the How to Train Your Dragon reboot, it would be surprising if DeBlois didn&#39;t consider the possibility. Between Ming-Na Wen in Disney&#39;s live-action Mulan to Lynda Carter&#39;s surprise cameo in Wonder Woman 1984, it wouldn&#39;t be the first time that a creative team has brought back iconic actors for new roles in updated versions of a property.
