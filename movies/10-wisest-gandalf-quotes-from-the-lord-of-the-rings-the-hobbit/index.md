 Lord Of The Rings: How Gandalf The Grey &amp; White Are Different 
The difference between Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White goes beyond a wardrobe change. Here&#39;s how the wizard transformed in Lord of the Rings.












 








 10  “Many That Live Deserve Death. Some That Die Deserve Life. Can You Give It To Them, Frodo? Do Not Be Too Eager To Deal Out Death In Judgment. Even The Very Wise Cannot See All Ends.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
        

Gandalf is someone who has a lot more insight into life and death than the average Hobbit or human in The Lord of the Rings. As an Istari, he has an extremely long life similar to the Elves. When Frodo expresses disgust over Gollum (Andy Serkis) and wishes for his death, Gandalf offers these words of advice. While wishing that evil people weren’t around anymore might be normal, Gandalf reminds Frodo that it’s not anyone&#39;s place to deal out death and that how the way things work together, in the end, can’t always be seen.
            
 
 Why Gandalf Couldn&#39;t Carry The One Ring In Lord Of The Rings 
Gandalf told Frodo not to &#34;tempt&#34; him with Sauron&#39;s One Ring in Lord of the Rings, and this wasn&#39;t just an old wizard being overly cautious.








 9  &#34;The Old Wisdom Born Out Of The West Was Forsaken. Kings Made Tombs More Splendid Than The Houses Of The Living And Counted The Names Of Their Descent Dearer Than The Names Of Their Sons.&#34; 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
        

One of the wisest Gandalf quotes only makes it into the extended version of The Return of the King, but it&#39;s a moment that&#39;s worth highlighting for its relevance to some of the key themes seen in that film. As Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) walk away from their disheartening first meeting with Denethor (John Noble), Gandalf explains to Pippin how the line of kings had failed and how Gondor had gone into a state of decline.
Though he would never have listened to them, Denethor needed these words most of all, his treatment of Faramir (David Wenham) directly echoing Gandalf&#39;s assessment of the rot lying at the heart of the world of Men.





 8  &#34;True Courage Is About Knowing Not When To Take A Life But When To Spare One.&#34; 
Gandalf in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
        

Despite facing many dangers in his journeys over the course of The Lord of the Rings movies, Gandalf is not one to kill even his enemies without thought. He further establishes this belief during a significant moment when Gandalf hands Bilbo his iconic sword, Sting, an iconic fictional weapon that Frodo would inherit in The Lord of the Rings.
The Gandalf quote from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is profoundly wise advice, but it also has an interesting connection to the plot, as this is the part of the story in which Bilbo meets and then spares the life of the character Gollum. Taking pity on Gollum as Frodo would also do, Bilbo&#39;s decision not to kill Gollum sets in motion the acts that ultimately destroy both Gollum and the Ring of Power in the fires of Mount Doom many years later in the events of The Return of the King.





 7  “If In Doubt, Meriadoc, Always Follow Your Nose.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
        

While the best Gandalf quotes are often quite serious, he can also be rather funny. Gandalf has a lighter side and a good sense of humor that comes out fairly often. This is especially true when he is talking to Hobbits. When the Fellowship gets lost in Moria, Gandalf finds their way through using a less-than-scientific method. Despite his great intelligence and relying on that intellect to steer him in the right direction, Gandalf is also willing to admit he is not perfect and that sometimes his choices are based on little more than gut feeling and instinct.

Gandalf the Grey’s transformation into Gandalf the White changed the tides in Middle-earth’s favor during The Lord of the Rings trilogy.








 6  “The World Is Not In Your Books And Maps. It&#39;s Out There.” 
Gandalf in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey


 







In The Hobbit, especially in the books, Gandalf is less serious than he is in The Lord of the Rings. This is because the overall situation in Middle-earth gets much worse as the story goes on, but when he meets Bilbo he’s in rather good spirits. Bilbo is a rare Hobbit who loves both comfort and adventure, and Gandalf encourages him to experience the world. This wise Gandalf quote is also a good reminder for fans of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit to go out and enjoy things in the real world.





 5  “Death Is Just Another Path. One That We All Must Take.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
        

The Lord of the Rings series deals with many heavy themes, such as war and death. When Pippin, someone who is quite young and very sheltered, is exposed to the horrors of death and war in Gondor, he’s understandably scared. Gandalf manages to provide him with some comfort by reminding him that death is an inevitability that shouldn&#39;t be feared, and is the next path everyone in the world goes on once their time is over. Gandalf shares his wisdom about the afterlife, and it&#39;s powerful enough to provide Pippin with some courage during those frightening moments.





 4  “I Will Not Say: Do Not Weep; For Not All Tears Are An Evil.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King


 







One of the themes of the Lord of the Rings series is the importance of friendship. The bonds between the members of the Fellowship of the Ring are strong bonds forged from loyalty as they go through traumatic events together. When Gandalf and Frodo leave Middle-earth to go to the Undying Lands, they must say goodbye to Sam (Sean Astin), Merry, and Pippin. Gandalf reminds them all that crying and feeling sad isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and it’s alright to feel these things when it comes to saying goodbye.





 3  “I Have Found It Is The Small Things, Everyday Deeds Of Ordinary Folk, That Keeps The Darkness At Bay. Simple Acts Of Kindness And Love.” 
Gandalf in The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey
        

Gandalf shares this heartwarming observation that speaks to the themes of the entire franchise:
“Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that is not what I have found. I have found it is the small things, everyday deeds of ordinary folk, that keeps the darkness at bay. Simple acts of kindness and love.” 
The quote speaks once again to Gandalf’s understanding of the importance of regular people. The Hobbits in the series are a representation of how even the most regular people can make a big difference in the world. This Gandalf quote is all about how important it is to do good wherever possible and treat other people with kindness, and it’s definitely a pearl of wisdom that can be applied to life in the real world as well as Middle-earth.
            
 
 Why Gandalf Was So Interested In Hobbits In The Lord Of The Rings (Did He Know They&#39;d Be Important?) 
Gandalf seemed to know that Hobbits would be important in saving Middle-earth, but was this the only reason he befriended them in Lord of the Rings?








 2  “A Wizard Is Never Late, Frodo Baggins. Nor Is He Early. He Arrives Precisely When He Means To.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring


 







Gandalf&#39;s first line in the Lord of the Rings movie is another example of his sense of humor as well as his somewhat dramatic nature. When Frodo accuses him of being late, Gandalf refuses to accept this. Instead, he retorts back with a quip that sums up both the mentality of wizards and their eccentricity. There is, however, a certain kind of wisdom to this Gandalf quote, as the wizard illustrates that, as one of the Istari, he acts according to a will greater than his own. Gandalf is always where he needs to be when he needs to be there, and he knows it.





 1  “All We Have To Decide Is What To Do With The Time That Is Given To Us. There Are Other Forces At Work In This World, Frodo, Besides The Will Of Evil.” 
Gandalf in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
        

This Gandalf quote from The Fellowship of the Ring film is one of the most popular Gandalf quotes. It speaks to how living in difficult times isn’t something anyone asks for, but it doesn&#39;t rob people of their ability to choose. It’s an inspiring quote that speaks to inner strength and making the best of life. Gandalf&#39;s understanding of the inner workings of existence is deeper than anyone else&#39;s in the Fellowship and this Gandalf quote really reminds Lord of the Rings fans of that.
