# The Hunger Games Movies Need To Move Beyond District 12 Now


## SUMMARY 


 

The Hunger Games franchise has had success with audiences, but a change is needed for it to continue.


District 12 has been the focus in previous movies, but new films should explore other districts in Panem.


The other districts offer new locations, characters, and stories that can be explored in future Hunger Games movies.

## Literature Review
Although the past five Hunger Games movies have been successful, a big change is necessary if the franchise is going to continue releasing movies.
