## Literature Review

Jake Johnson assembles an excellent cast for his directorial debut, Self Reliance. We break down the full cast, their previous roles &amp; who they play.




Jake Johnson has been a staple of television for a long time, but he’s graduated to directing movies — and his directorial debut, Self Reliance, has a stellar cast to tell its wild, twisty comedic tale. Self Reliance has received a mostly positive critical reception, and while it’s quite absurd in its premise, the exceptional cast make the most out of it and turn their characters into memorable ones (even if some actors are just playing themselves).




Self Reliance premiered at the 2023 SXSW Film Festival and follows Tommy, a man who’s seemingly hit rock bottom and doesn’t have much going on his life, as he agrees to be on a reality TV show streaming on the dark web in the hopes of winning one million dollars. Johnson most recently starred in Minx, and takes the leading role in his directorial debut. And though he plays the main character, the rest of Self Reliance’s cast, including comedian Wayne Brady and the beloved Christopher Lloyd, is made up of actors of equal caliber who have decades of experience between them.


 Jake Johnson as Tommy 
          

Jake Johnson was born in Evanston, Illinois and has been well-known to television viewers since playing Nick Miller in the Fox comedy New Girl alongside Zoeey Deschanel. The actor has also had leading roles in the short-lived series Stumptown opposite How I Met Your Mother’s Cobie Smulders, the animated movies Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, in which he voiced Peter B. Parker, Hoops, and the aforementioned Minx. Johnson has also had roles in comedies like Neighbors and 21 Jump Street. He’s set to reprise his role as the web-slinging superhero in Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse.




As Tommy, Johnson has mastered the portrayal of an emotionally stunted, self-deprecating man who lacks any finesse. In Self Reliance, Tommy is still heartbroken after his girlfriend of more than a decade left him. He’s still living in his mom’s house and is constantly told that he should get a job. So, when he’s presented with the opportunity to be on a reality show that sees him having to survive 30 days of hunters attempting to gun him down for prize money, Tommy figures he might as well do it, adding some excitement to his life.



Prior to Self Reliance, Jake Johnson also directed the New Girl episode, &#34;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Nick &amp; Schmidt&#34;.






 Anna Kendrick as Maddy 
          




Anna Kendrick can not only act, but she can sing her way to some very high notes, as her roles in The Last Five Years, Camp, her debut film, Into the Woods, and Pitch Perfect can attest. The latter was Kendrick’s ticket to full-fledged fame, but she received a lot of attention for her supporting role in Up in the Air opposite George Clooney. Kendrick’s career has a lot of variety, with the actress having starred in dramas, comedies, and musicals.

She most recently directed her first feature, Woman of the Hour, and has also had leading roles in the anthology series Love Life, A Simple Favor opposite Blake Lively, Alice, Darling, and Drinking Buddies, with a minor role in the Twilight Saga. In Self Reliance, Kendrick plays Maddy, a woman who meets Tommy after she claims to also be appearing in the same reality series. After feeling isolated for so long, the pair form a romantic connection.



 Biff Wiff as James 
          




Biff Wiff has spent his career primarily appearing in guest-starring roles in various television shows, such as iCarly, Night Court, Jury Duty opposite James Marsden, Doll Face, and Grace and Frankie. Wiff, however, is most notable for playing Rick in Everything Everywhere All At Once. As James in Self Reliance, the actor plays a homeless man who is paid by Tommy to stay with him at all times, as it’s the only way to ensure he isn’t killed by the reality show hunters. The pair get up to quite a few shenanigans during their time together.
