## Literature Review

Although the details surrounding James Wan&#39;s H. P. Lovecraft movie are scarce, its success could lead to the revival of an abandoned 2010 idea.




Horror director James Wan has his sights set on a The Call of Cthulhu adaptation that could bring about renewed interest in the classic H. P. Lovecraft story if it turns out to be a success. Known primarily for his work on the Insidious and The Conjuring franchise, Wan has solidified himself as one of the entertainment industry&#39;s most notable and prolific horror directors in the modern age. Nevertheless, the details surrounding James Wan&#39;s The Call of Cthulhu movie are scarce, thus leaving room for speculation regarding the horror director&#39;s exciting new project. Nevertheless, its success could set the stage for subsequent entries in a possible Lovecraft adaptation franchise.




The 1928 short story of the same name centers around anthropologist Francis Thurston, as he investigates a cult obsessed with worshiping the ancient cosmic entity known as Cthulhu. Based on The Call of Cthulhu&#39;s reputation as one of the greatest cosmic horror stories ever written, the success of Wan&#39;s adaptation could lead to Hollywood producing a number of horror movies based on Lovecraft&#39;s work, thus bringing about a new trend in the horror movie genre. As exciting as Wan&#39;s take on The Call of Cthulhu is, there&#39;s another legendary horror director who&#39;s had an idea for an H. P. Lovecraft movie since 2010.

Although there are no guarantees regarding the future of H. P. Lovecraft movie adaptations, the success of Wan&#39;s The Call of Cthulhu has the potential to spawn a franchise similarly to Wan&#39;s The Conjuring and Insidious movies. While the first entries in both movies were solid standalone movies, their box-office success and popularity among audiences set the stage for Wan to develop fully fleshed-out universes around the respective projects. Hollywood&#39;s greatest interest is in franchise potential as seen by the industry&#39;s taking on various franchises, so if Wan&#39;s The Call of Cthulhu performs well at the global box-office, there&#39;s a strong chance that audiences will see more adaptations.

If The Call of Cthulhu&#39;s movie adaptation is successful or, at the very least, performs well at the box-office, viewers might see the writer&#39;s work expanded in the form of new TV series as well. Despite the cancelation of HBO&#39;s Lovecraft Country, the modern take on Lovecraft&#39;s 1928 novel generated enough interest that it made viewers scratch their heads when it suddenly disappeared. As seen in Wan&#39;s body of work, his specific vision and acute attention-to-detail would be a perfect fit for The Call of Cthulhu, and its potential success could see other horror movie directors like Jordan Peele and Guillermo del Toro interpret more of Lovecraft&#39;s work, particularly del Toro&#39;s long-suffering adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness.






 Why Guillermo del Toro&#39;s At The Mountains Of Madness Movie Needs To Happen In Some Way

Horror director Guillermo del Toro first proposed an idea for his take on The Call of Cthulhu in 2006 to Warner Bros. titled, At The Mountains of Madness, but couldn&#39;t secure funding due to its bleak climax and minimal romance. Furthermore, James Cameron and Tom Cruise attempted to help del Toro make At The Mountains of Madness in 2010, to no avail. However, del Toro&#39;s version of The Call of Cthulhu still needs to happen as the Academy Award-winner&#39;s use of practical effects, ironclad understanding of horror, and impressive horror pictures like Cronos, Pan&#39;s Labyrinth, and Guillermo del Toro&#39;s The Cabinets of Curiosities perfectly display his mastery of the genre.
