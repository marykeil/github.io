## Literature Review

With Jonathan Majors officially out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Kang, new Avengers 5 fan art brings a popular actor in to replace him.




A popular choice to replace Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror comes to life through new Avengers: The Kang Dynasty fan art, showing what he could look like in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The biggest question currently haunting Marvel Studios is whether or not the MCU will move on without Kang, with Majors no longer attached to the role. With 2024 having the least amount of MCU movies in a long time, the Multiverse Saga is definitely getting slowed down until next year.




For the time being, the world is speculating as to whether or not Kang will be recast in the MCU, with various names being suggested by the audience. One candidate who is emerging as a big favorite is The Color Purple and Euphoria star Colman Domingo, and it didn&#39;t take long for digital artists BenSolo_Cup and spdrmnkyxxiii to show what he could look like in the villainous role.


 

BenSolo_Cup did a design of Domingo as Kang, specifically the version that Majors played in Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp: Quantumania. While referencing Domingo being rumored to play Kang, Marvel Studios has not made any statements at this time.


 




The Kang variant that spdrmnkyxxiii used as inspiration for his Domingo artwork was He Who Remains, who played an integral role in the Loki TV show. As referenced by the artist himself, Domingo has previously stated that he would love to take part in a superhero franchise like the MCU.

 Why Jonathan Majors Is No Longer The MCU&#39;s Kang Explained 
         

Throughout 2023, Majors was arrested for misdemeanor charges of assault, among other charges, and the court case following this took placing during most of the year. This sparked speculation as to whether or not Marvel Studios would keep him as Kang, but the executives remained silent for most of 2023. It wasn&#39;t until his trial verdict that Marvel Studios and Disney made their move about Majors&#39; future with the MCU franchise.




Once Majors was officially found guilty on two misdemeanor counts of harassment and assault, the Kang actor was officially fired by Marvel Studios, hours after the verdict came in. For the time being, Avengers: The Kang Dynasty is currently being referred to as Avengers 5, meaning it is currently unclear whether the MCU will continue to focus on Kang, especially as every variant of the character was played by Majors. Even if the Marvel villain is recast, there&#39;s still a chance that the character could still take a backseat in the franchise&#39;s future, so the MCU can instead focus on new storylines and building in a direction that isn&#39;t as tied to the legal battles of the original Kang actor.



Loki&#39;s Michael Waldron is writing the screenplays for both Avengers 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars.




Even though Majors&#39; termination came quickly, it is possible that Marvel Studios is still trying to figure out how to go from here. With the Multiverse Saga currently being a mixed bag among critics and fans, time will tell how Marvel Studios will go forward when it comes to Kang. As Marvel Studios gets further into 2024, they will hopefully have an update on Avengers 5 and whether or not Kang will continue to serve as the central antagonist of the Multiverse Saga.
