# 10 Reasons 2023 s Superhero Movie Box Office Results Were So Poor


## SUMMARY 



  The MCU and DCEU both suffered historically poor box office numbers in 2023, and there are several reasons as to why.   General superhero fatigue may be hurting the number of general audiences interested in seeing Marvel and DC movies on the big screen, especially with streaming.   Simply put, several Marvel and DC movies in 2023 just weren&#39;t very good, and better movies might fix things.

## Literature Review

2023 was an uneven year for the MCU and DCEU, but several often overlapping factors can explain the brands&#39; disappointing box office performances.




2023 was a tumultuous year for superhero movies, with both the MCU and DCEU suffering poor results at the box office for a myriad of reasons. The very public decline in enthusiasm for each studio&#39;s superhero offerings will have hurt both in more ways than one, threatening the future of the genre as a whole and signifying that the heady days of superhero movies at their peak may be taking a break. Both studios released two record-breakers in 2023, with The Marvels and Blue Beetle both grossing the lowest-ever worldwide box office for their respective franchises. Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse, conversely, was a big win for Sony.




The truth, however, is that the outlook may not be so bleak. The superhero genre&#39;s future is not yet written in stone, with plenty of actionable solutions for both studios to pursue. Not only that, but 2023 hosted a miasma of unfortunate circumstances that could easily explain the failures of the DCEU and MCU offerings. 2024, meanwhile, will offer a reprieve from the typical deluge of superhero movies as the DCU gears up for a fresh spin on the genre, and the MCU is set to release just one movie instead of the typical 3. Plus, on reflection, the reasons for the 2023 box office results may be easier to avoid with the benefit of hindsight.

 Superhero Fatigue May Be At Its Peak 
Lack Of Enthusiasm Is Worse Than Ever
         




The dreaded specter of superhero fatigue is probably the biggest reason superhero movies suffered in 2023. The argument that the superhero genre has been done to death is looking more valid than ever before, with both of the foremost superhero genre studios experiencing historic flops in just one year. A steady rise in combined box office takings across all cinematic releases since 2020 does not seem to have extended to the MCU and DCEU, with Barbie and Avatar: The Way Of Water clinching the worldwide box office top spot in 2023 and 2022, respectively, while previous years have gone to MCU offerings.



 There Is A General Downturn In Cinema Attendance 
There Is Less Cinema Attendance Overall As People Budget And Stream
          

Since 2020 hit the movie industry where it hurts, cinemas have been slowly clawing back attendance figures. The shift in attitudes, however, as streaming platforms become more prolific and offer greater value for money, is difficult to counteract. Combined worldwide box office takings are still over $10 billion behind where they were in 2019, and the superhero movies of 2023 seem to have taken the hit from a seemingly choosier audience. Marvel&#39;s Disney Plus offerings will also play their part in distracting audiences away from visiting cinemas for new releases, as they can wait until the movies drop on the streamer.






 Less Popular Characters Headlined 2023&#39;s Lineup 
Audiences Are Not As Interested In Ant-Man, The Marvels, Or Blue Beetle
         

Unfortunately, Ant-Man, The Marvels, and Blue Beetle do not carry the same star power as Spider-Man, the Avengers, and Superman. The consequences of this are reflected in the comparatively poor performances at the box office, as audiences seem less prepared to shell out for movies featuring new or less popular characters. This is particularly concerning for the MCU, as its highest performer of 2023 was the last in a trilogy, splitting the Guardians of the Galaxy apart, while Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania and The Marvels attempted to spotlight the central figures in its new Multiverse Saga, but fell flat regardless.



 


 The SAG-AFTRA Strikes Took Their Toll 
The Strikes Hurt Marketing For The Marvels And Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom
          




After striking a deal with studios, the SAG-AFTRA strikes over the summer were a huge success for the writers and actors of Hollywood. Unfortunately, The Marvels, in particular, suffered the most out of all superhero movies in 2023 as the months leading up to its release were distinctly devoid of its main stars helping to promote the movie. Their absence took its toll on the marketing drive for The Marvels, which is indicative of just how valuable their involvement is. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, meanwhile, which released just over a month later, will have also felt the effects of the summer silence.



 The DCEU Was Made Redundant By The DCU Reveal 
The DCU Announcement Will Have Made Seeing A DCEU Movie Feel Like A Waste Of Time
          

James Gunn and Peter Safran&#39;s plans for the DCU - a reboot of DC&#39;s cinematic universe - was a double-edged sword. While the promise of a revamped DC cinematic universe has reinvigorated enthusiasm for the genre, it was also the death knell for the several movies under the DCEU banner that were still to be released. Given that the DCU is entirely separated from the events of the DCEU, audiences lost reasons to catch up on Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, Blue Beetle, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom beyond a general fondness for the characters, knowing that these would no longer factor into a wider narrative.






 The MCU Is Struggling To Tie Its Wider Narrative Together 
There Has Been No Avengers Movie For Too Long
          

Similarly to the DCU&#39;s announcement, the MCU has struggled to tie its movies together throughout MCU Phases 4 and 5. The Multiverse Saga has yet to release an Avengers movie, relying on post-credits scenes and cameos to unite its new lineup of heroes. Kang the Conqueror, meanwhile, featured in 2023&#39;s Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania, and was defeated by the end. The decision to save the next team-up movie for the climax of the entire Multiverse Saga has made the MCU seem more disjointed than ever, removing impetus for audiences to get up to speed with the presumed stars of the new Avengers lineup.



 


 There Is A Reduced Interest In The Multiverse Saga 
There Is A General Lack Of Interest Since Avengers: Endgame
         




MCU movie attendance has steadily declined since Avengers: Endgame, which wrapped up 22 movies&#39; worth of narrative. Unsurprisingly, fully investing in a whole new saga is a daunting prospect for casual viewers. The likelihood is that the MCU will not replicate the near-$3 billion success of its highest-grossing movie, with some of the most beloved characters of that era being phased out in favor of unknown ones. This puts Marvel in a difficult position, as reviving old characters will feel desperate if not done correctly.



 Marvel And DC Suffered Production Woes 
Tumultuous Productions Have Resulted In Sub-Par Products
          

Production issues that plagued movies like Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and The Marvels will have taken their toll on the quality of last year&#39;s superhero movies. Three rounds of reshoots for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom and a severe delay for The Marvels aren&#39;t great signs, and that seems to have borne fruit for both movies, given the lackluster response to each. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania, meanwhile, was lambasted partly for its overzealous special effects, proving once again that money spent on CGI does not always entail high satisfaction.




                  Ant-Man &amp; The Wasp Quantumania Ending Reshoots: What Changed?   Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&#39;s ending was reshot only a few weeks before the film hit theaters. What changed and what does it mean for the MCU?   



 The Quality Of The Movies Wasn&#39;t Great 
2023 Superhero Movies Garnered Middling To Poor Reviews
         

There are notable exceptions in the underwhelming year of 2023, with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 netting Marvel around $850 million at the worldwide box office, as well as a slew of glowing reviews. Unfortunately, while Blue Beetle and The Marvels were stellar offerings, the quality alone was not enough to make them soar financially. Meanwhile, middling-to-poor reviews plagued the other four superhero movies released in 2023, which will have affected the general zeitgeist surrounding the genre as a whole as audiences start to feel like they are losing their luster.






 Both Studios Suffered From Controversies Behind The Scenes 
Legal Troubles Plagued Multiple Stars
          

Dramas plagued both the MCU and DCU behind the scenes, as the public allegations, trial, and subsequent conviction of Jonathan Majors (Kang the Conqueror) marred his involvement in the MCU. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, meanwhile, was also subject to its own controversies as public opinion in Amber Heard (Meera) was swayed by her incredibly public legal battle with Johnny Depp, and rumors swirled around Jason Momoa (Aquaman) being drunk during filming. Conscientious viewers may have been turned away by the controversies surrounding these stars, especially now that Marvel has decided to drop the Kang actor entirely.
