## Literature Review

The Japanese movie Godzilla Minus One passes a huge milestone at the domestic box office, shattering an important record for a non-English title.




Godzilla Minus One has broken a gargantuan record. The movie is the 33rd Japanese-language movie made by Toho, following the story of a former kamikaze pilot&#39;s attempts to rebuild his life in post-World War II Tokyo being derailed by the emergence of the titular giant monster, which rampages throughout Japan. Although it was only intended to run in North America for one week, the movie became a record-breaking smash hit and its release has expanded considerably.




Per Deadline, the Godzilla Minus One box office has crossed the $50 million milestone in North America this weekend, its seventh in domestic theaters. This makes it the highest-grossing Japanese movie ever in U.S. and Canadian theaters, including both live-action and animation. It is also now the fifth highest-grossing non-English domestic release of all time.


 Godzilla Minus One Is Unprecedented 
          

It is difficult to predict how Toho will respond to the success of the Godzilla Minus One American release, as it has become a hit at a completely unprecedented level. While the chart of highest-grossing Japanese-language releases doesn&#39;t include English-dubbed animated releases like PokÃ©mon: The First Movie - Mewtwo Strikes Back, which earned $85.7 million domestic, it is nevertheless a major accomplishment. Check out Godzilla&#39;s total compared to the only four non-Japanese foreign language movies to outgross it in the domestic market below:




 Title  Domestic Gross   Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)  $128 million   Life is Beautiful (1998)  $57.2 million   Hero (2004)  $53.7 million   Parasite (2019)  $53.4 million   Godzilla Minus One (2023)  $50 million&#43;   



It seems highly probable that a sequel would be greenlit given these numbers. The Godzilla Minus One ending leaves the option open for a follow-up, but making another entry would break a Toho tradition of more than 20 years. With the exception of an animated trilogy of Godzilla features, the company hasn&#39;t made a direct sequel to any of their Godzilla movies in decades.

Were Godzilla Minus One to get a sequel, it would mean that two branches of the franchise would be in active competition with one another. The Hollywood franchise known as the Monsterverse is still going strong, having recently concluded the show Monarch: Legacy of Monsters ahead of the 2024 release of Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire. Whether the possible dilution of the franchise impacts Toho&#39;s decision remains to be seen, but the success of the new movie must be difficult to ignore.
