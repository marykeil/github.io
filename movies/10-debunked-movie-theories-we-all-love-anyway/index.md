## Literature Review

Iconic movies like Titanic and Harry Potter have spawned a lot of theories, and even though they have been debunked, they still enthrall audiences.




It is customary for cult classics to be surrounded with the most surreal fan theories that remain endlessly popular even after they have been debunked numerous times by the creator or other involved parties. Some stories grip audiences in such a way that they are unable to let go of the characters and move on, forced to come up with theories, each one wilder than the last. For instance, Titanic&#39;s door debate has been going strong ever since the film&#39;s original release in 1997, and James Cameron has even run scientific tests to determine whether Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s Jack could have survived in reality.
While the reason for some theories&#39; popularity lies in the fact that they have substantial backing and are neither confirmed nor denied by the director or on-screen, other claims, no matter how many times they have been debunked, remain a hot topic for discussion years after the movie in question first premiered. The codename James Bond theory has been around for decades before Skyfall ruined it with the infamous gravestone scene, although an argument that James Bond is a codename can still be made nonetheless. Agent 007&#39;s biggest secret isn&#39;t the only example of a movie theory gaining a life of its own.









 








 10  Heimdall Has Or Is A Soul Stone 
The MCU


 







In the early years of the MCU, the location of the Soul Stone used to be the most anticipated reveal, and one of the most well-recognized theories had to do with Heimdall, the gatekeeper of Asgard, either having or being the stone in question. Much like the Soul Stone, Heimdall&#39;s eyes are orange, and he has the power to see and hear &#34;every soul&#34; in the Nine Realms. By the time Avengers: Infinity War rolled around, all but one Infinity Stones had been extensively used, and the expectations were running high. Unfortunately, the film debunked the glorious Heimdall theory, revealing that the Soul Stone had been on Vormir all along.





 9  Harry Becomes A Hogwarts Professor 
Harry Potter
        

Although the Harry Potter film saga doesn&#39;t feature what the future holds in store for the Golden Trio, apart from marriage and children, devoted Potterheads have always believed that the titular character went on to land the Defense Against the Dark Arts post at Hogwarts, which allowed him to develop the teaching skills he first showcased in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. However, J.K. Rowling gave Harry a different career by making him an Auror. This doesn&#39;t sit well with audiences to this day, so it is widely accepted that Harry quit his law enforcement job at some point and returned to Hogwarts. After all, the Boy Who Lived had had a lifetime of dangerous missions and didn&#39;t need any more.





 8  There Is A Matrix Within A Matrix 
The Matrix
        

In 1999, The Matrix franchise was launched, and it completely revolutionized the sci-fi genre. Ever since the first movie&#39;s premiere, a theory about the existence of another Matrix within a Matrix has started circulating in the community. The gist of it is that Zion isn&#39;t part of the real world but is instead a deeper level of the Matrix simulation, and it might not even be the last one. This claim garnered even more traction with the release of further installments, but as of the latest film, The Matrix Resurrections, it remains unconfirmed, and thankfully so — this Matrix theory never really made much sense.





 7  Jack Could Have Survived 
Titanic


 







Titanic&#39;s ending is easily one of the most divisive moments in cinematic history, and the debate about whether Jack had to die to save Rose seems to be never-ending. The director, James Cameron, weighed in on the discussion and confirmed that Jack wouldn&#39;t have survived because he wouldn&#39;t have endangered Rose by trying to hold on to the debris, but that doesn&#39;t stop countless viewers from arguing that Rose should have made room for her lover on the door. Jack and Rose&#39;s love story has touched a lot of hearts, so it is understandable why Jack&#39;s death is still such a sore point.





 6  Sandy Is Dead From The Start 
Grease
        

Grease is a fairly lighthearted musical about young love, but its seemingly happy ending has been deemed too perfect to be true, spawning a theory that Sandy has been dead all along. According to Danny, he saved Sandy from drowning upon their meet-cute, but in reality, he might not have succeeded. The wild theory is supported by the film&#39;s fantastical ending that transcends all the genre tropes by having the happy couple literally fly off into the sunset — it might have been a metaphor for Sandy going to the afterlife after her final fever dream ended. This interpretation would put a dark yet entertaining spin on Grease if only creator Jim Jacobs hadn&#39;t debunked it.





 5  George Recognizes Marty As Calvin Klein 
Back to the Future
        

Back to the Future&#39;s time travel rules aren&#39;t exactly consistent, but the fact that Marty&#39;s parents never realize that Marty is Calvin Klein is particularly bothersome. One theory suggests that George knew that his son was a time traveler all along. Since George was a huge sci-fi fan and, therefore, susceptible to its core concepts, he could have picked up on the clues that Marty had left over time and kept it all to himself, as he didn&#39;t want to risk destroying his own past. The franchise&#39;s creators, Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, however, prefer a simpler explanation — Marty&#39;s parents didn&#39;t recognize their son because of how much time had passed since their high school years.
            
 
 10 Time Travel Movie Rules, Ranked Worst To Best 
Time travel movies are often riddled with plot holes, but some of them, like Interstellar, manage to stick to their own rules from beginning to end.








 4  Jar Jar Binks Is A Sith Lord 
Star Wars
        

Jar Jar Binks is one of the most infuriating characters in Star Wars and, incidentally, the subject of the most well-known theories. It is believed that he may in fact be a Sith Lord, and there is a surprising amount of evidence to support the Darth Jar Jar theory. From his body language being a telltale sign that Jar Jar is a Force user to his similarities with Yoda and connection to Darth Vader, this character is now thought to be far more layered than he originally appeared to be. Despite all the arguments, the theory is rather far-fetched, and it is unlikely that Darth Jar Jar will ever see the light of day within the Star Wars canon.





 3  James Bond Is A Codename 
James Bond


 







Since 1962, a total of seven actors have portrayed the legendary agent 007 on-screen, which has naturally given rise to the theory that James Bond is an honorary codename, attributed to a select few agents. Eon Productions have yet to make this claim canon, although throughout the years, hints that could both confirm and deny it have been featured in the movies. Most notably, Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig, nearly buried the theory with the scene where Bond looks at his parents&#39; gravestone bearing his famous last name. However, No Time to Die made the codename theory possible again by killing off Craig&#39;s Bond in its final plot twist.





 2  Elvis Was Alive In 1990 
Home Alone
        

Elvis Presley, the King of Rock and Roll, died in 1977, but his most diehard followers refused to accept it and continued to come up with suggestions about the singer&#39;s whereabouts. In a Home Alone scene where Kevin&#39;s mother is trying to book a flight back to Chicago at the airport, there is a bearded man who, according to the theory, looks a lot like an older Elvis. For years, this scene was the source of hope for all who clung to the idea that Elvis was still alive, but in 2018, it was revealed that the bearded man was portrayed by the late actor Gary Richard Grott.





 1  The Pevensie Siblings Are The Hogwarts Founders 
The Chronicles of Narnia &amp; Harry Potter
        

Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia are exemplary fantasy works that were written decades apart, but one crossover theory suggests that there is a connection between the two. The Pevensie siblings, who eventually become the rulers of Narnia, bear quite a lot of similarities to the Hogwarts founders, especially when it comes down to their most distinctive traits. For instance, Peter, who is as brave as Godric Gryffindor, is also thought to be &#34;the best duelist of his time,&#34; much like his Harry Potter counterpart. J.K. Rowling has confirmed that C.S. Lewis&#39; works have influenced her as a writer, but there is no further proof that the Pevensies ended up founding Hogwarts.
