# Henry Cavill Addresses Whether New Spy Movie Affects His James Bond Chances


## SUMMARY 



  Henry Cavill says that whether his role in Argylle affects his James Bond chances is up to producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.   Cavill auditioned for 007 for Casino Royale and was deemed too young, but he&#39;s now found himself a popular choice again following Daniel Craig&#39;s departure.   Cavill&#39;s age and busy schedule could hurt his chances at becoming 007.

## Literature Review

Argylle star Henry Cavill addresses whether his upcoming Matthew Vaughn spy movie will affects his chances of being cast as James Bond.




Henry Cavill shares this thoughts regarding whether staring in Argylle affects his shot at becoming James Bond. Following Daniel Craig&#39;s farewell to the role of 007 in 2021&#39;s No Time To Die, Cavill has once again found himself in the conversation regarding who could be next to play the iconic British superspy. While producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson haven&#39;t shared any real announcements regarding who the next actor will be to play the character, Cavill will get his chance to play an suave spy figure in Matthew Vaughn&#39;s Argylle.




Now, as audiences await news about James Bond 26, Cavill addresses in an interview with Total Film (via GamesRadar) whether playing a spy in Argylle will hurt his 007 chances. While the actor doesn&#39;t share what he thinks his chances are, he makes clear that it&#39;s not up to him anyway. Check out Cavill&#39;s comment below:



“It’s a fun character. Whether I’m ruled out of Bond because of this or not is up to Barbara Broccoli and Mr. Wilson.”



  


 Is It Too Late For Henry Cavill&#39;s 007? 
          

As has now been widely shared, Cavill did audition for Bond in Casino Royale. The actor, who was one of a number of stars considered in the early 2000s, was ultimately deemed too young at the time, with the role going to Craig. Now that Craig has departed the role, Cavill is among names like Aaron Taylor-Johnson, James Norton, Papa Essiedu, and Regé-Jean Page, among many others, frequently topping odds lists.






Casino Royale director Martin Campbell recently opened up about Cavill&#39;s Bond audition to Express UK, calling it &#34;tremendous,&#34; and revealing that the actor would&#39;ve made a great 007 &#34;if Daniel [Craig] didn&#39;t exist.&#34;




Although Cavill has been careful not to speak at length about Bond and whether he&#39;s currently involved in any conversations behind-the-scenes, there&#39;s some question regarding whether the casting could still happen. Typically, actors first play Bond when they are in their mid-30s, allowing them to play the role across at least three films. Cavill now being 40 years old certainly doesn&#39;t take him out of the running, but it has also been reported that the franchise&#39;s producers are looking for someone a little younger this time around.

Another factor working against Cavill is just how busy he is as an actor. Playing Bond is proven to be very demanding and time-consuming, and with Cavill currently involved in bringing a Warhammer 40K TV show to life, in addition to being attached to projects like Highlander, it&#39;s not clear if the actor would be able to make the kind of contractual commitments 007 producers might be looking for. While Cavill is certainly not out of the running just yet, it does feel like his James Bond chances go down with each passing year.
