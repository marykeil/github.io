## Literature Review

Musical remakes of movies can alter a lot of their source material, but they are likely to succeed if they can retain the same essence as the original




Over the years, some movies have been remade as musicals, but they haven&#39;t always been improved upon in the process. With The Color Purple and Mean Girls shaping up to be two of the biggest movies in January, musical remakes are bigger than ever. It seems possible that there will be more on the horizon if there proves to be an appetite for musical remakes, but there are already plenty of examples to look back on. These movies can show the best way to adapt older films, although sometimes they only prove which types of movies should be left alone.
Some of the most popular musicals of all time started out as movies without any songs. Their very existence is a great example of lateral thinking, and the artistic spirit of reinvention. Some movies are recreated as musicals decades after they are first released, showing that any movie could potentially be given the same treatment years down the line. The best musical remakes might change the tone and style of their source material, but they can succeed as long as they keep the essence of what makes the original movie so popular. Musical remakes don&#39;t need to resemble the originals too much, but they should enhance a different aspect of the material.









 








 10  Nine (2009) 
8 1/2 (1963)
        

There are some films which seem like perfect choices to be adapted into musicals, and Federico Fellini&#39;s introspective surrealist masterpiece 8 1/2 is not one of them. Nevertheless, Nine enjoyed a long and successful run on Broadway, and it attracted a prestigious ensemble cast to the movie, which includes Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. The musical adaptation lacks the personal touches of Fellini, and it toes the line between adaptation and pastiche. Marion Cotillard is the standout performer, and her ballad is the most uniquely moving song, but there are few other moments when Nine justifies being a musical.





 9  Kid Galahad (1962) 
Kid Galahad (1937)
        

Although it isn&#39;t up there with Elvis Presley&#39;s best movies, like Jailhouse Rock and Viva Las Vegas, the King of Rock and Roll gives a good account of himself as an aspiring boxer in Kid Galahad. The story is based on a film noir from 1937 starring Wayne Morris as the titular pugilist, and Humphrey Bogart as a gangster. The musical version alters the story to heap more focus onto Elvis, and it gives him a chance to do what he does best. None of the songs caught on massively, but the most notable is probably &#34;King of the Whole World,&#34; which swings along with Elvis&#39; trademark smooth drawl.





 8  Reefer Madness (2005) 
Reefer Madness (1936)
        

It&#39;s more than just a stoner comedy, since its 1930s setting draws parallels between contemporary society and the doldrums of the temperance movement. 

The original Reefer Madness is an exploitation film designed to scare young people away from the effects of marijuana, but its laughable misunderstanding of the drug and its overblown melodrama have given it a cult following among smokers. The 2005 musical adaptation mocks the absurdity of American moralist paranoia. It&#39;s more than just a stoner comedy, since its 1930s setting draws parallels between contemporary society and the doldrums of the temperance movement. Reefer Madness doesn&#39;t work with the grand scale of some other musicals, but it injects its dance scenes with plenty of dynamism. Most of the performers are more adept at comedy than music.





 7  Silk Stockings (1957) 
Ninotchka (1939)
        

Fred Astaire stars as an American movie producer who romances a stoic Russian operative in Silk Stockings. The dance sequences are packed with as much flair and joy as any of Astaire&#39;s movies, and Cyd Charisse makes a great dance partner for him. Greta Garbo plays Ninotchka in the original, and her deadpan comedy is sorely missed in Silk Stockings. Peter Lorre is a very unusual choice for some comic relief, and his casting is symptomatic of Silk Stockings trading in the acute humor of Ninotchka. Fortunately, Silk Stockings wins some high-caliber musical talent from this trade, with Cole Porter producing the songs.





 6  State Fair (1945) 
State Fair (1933)
        

State Fair is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical written for film rather than the stage. It&#39;s a charming slice of life story about a family who visit the Iowa State Fair, and the people they meet there. There is a sick pig, a game of ring toss, and some disagreements about cooking. All of these elements and more contribute to a strangely immersive narrative about young love, tied together by songs which reveal the emotional secrets of their characters. &#34;It Might as Well Be Spring&#34; won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, and State Fair&#39;s enduring popularity spawned another remake in 1962.





 5  High Society (1956) 
The Philadelphia Story (1940)
        

Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby teamed up for High Society in 1956, an adaptation of a popular screwball comedy starring Cary Grant and James Stewart in the same roles. The two men compete for the affection of Grace Kelly, whose role was played by the similarly glamorous Audrey Hepburn in The Philadelphia Story. High Society provides one of Grace Kelly&#39;s most memorable movie roles, in her final appearance. The cast boasts such immense musical talent that even the great Louis Armstrong only has a minor role to play. Despite these positives, High Society falls shy of its incredible potential, and it lacks the emotional resonance of The Philadelphia Story.





 4  The Producers (2005) 

The Producers (1967)


 







Mel Brooks&#39; original version of The Producers had a number from the fictional musical Springtime for Hitler, but the movie itself didn&#39;t have any other songs. The Producers is one of Gene Wilder&#39;s best movies, featuring him as a neurotic accountant who gets caught up in a scheme producing the worst Broadway musical conceivable. In the 2005 remake, Matthew Broderick takes on Wilder&#39;s role, opposite Nathan Lane as the shady, small-time producer. The extra songs add to the lavish style of the Broadway caper. Highlights include Will Ferrell singing &#34;Der Guten Tag Hop-Clop&#34; and the flamboyant Broadway director Roger Debris.





 3  Little Shop Of Horrors (1986) 
The Little Shop of Horrors (1960)


 







Little Shop of Horrors pays tribute to its B-movie roots, reveling in the joy of its outlandish plot and some deliberately obvious practical effects. Although the musical movie was made in the 1980s, its music mimics the soulful rock and roll of 1960s Motown hits. Little Shop of Horrors is campy and fun. In that regard, it strikes the perfect tone for a musical about a man-eating plant. The best songs from Little Shop of Horrors were mostly lifted from the off-Broadway production, with the exception of &#34;Mean Green Mother from Outer Space&#34; which became the first song nominated for an Academy Award which featured profanity.





 2  Hairspray (2007) 

Hairspray (1988)


 







The musical version of Hairspray has become such a huge success that it has outperformed the John Waters comedy from 1988. Most of Waters&#39; movies are transgressive cult hits, but Hairspray marked a move toward the mainstream which spawned an award-winning stage musical. The 2007 version of Hairspray stars Nicki Blonsky as Tracy, a Baltimore teenager who dreams of stardom as a dancer. The brilliant ensemble cast features James Marsden, Zac Efron, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Queen Latifah, among others. John Travolta plays Tracy&#39;s mother Edna, continuing the tradition of the role being played by a man in drag, after Divine starred in Waters&#39; original.





 1  A Star Is Born (1954) 
A Star is Born (1937)
        

A Star is Born is both a grand romance and a bitter tragedy. Above all, it is a showcase of Garland&#39;s exceptional talent. 

A Star is Born has been remade twice more since 1954. In 1976, Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson played the lead roles, and Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper made their own version in 2018. Judy Garland and James Mason were the duo who set the blueprint in 1954, and their version has stood the test of time. A Star is Born is both a grand romance and a bitter tragedy. Above all, it is a showcase of Garland&#39;s exceptional talent, not just as a singer but also as an actor. The songs are exceptionally entertaining, but they never disrupt the flow of the narrative.
