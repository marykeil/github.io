## Literature Review

Star Wars has officially announced The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie, confirming The Mandalorian season 4 will be taking place on the big screen.

 The Mandalorian Season 4 Is Now Officially A Movie 
        

The rumor of The Mandalorian season 4 becoming a movie rather than a season of television has been circulating for many months, and now, it has a truthful response from Star Wars. Given Din Djarin&#39;s and Grogu&#39;s The Mandalorian season 3 ending and their popularity as Star Wars characters, they truly are the perfect choice to bring the franchise back to the theaters. Just as the beloved duo ushered in a new age for Star Wars via live-action television, they will herald the new age of Star Wars movies.

Favreau previously confirmed he had already written The Mandalorian season 4, which means the story of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is more than likely a condensed or revised version of that same story. This movie is expected to lead the way for Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming The Mandalorian movie culmination event, which was announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023. It seems The Mandalorianhas at last grown beyond the bounds of Disney&#43;, and now viewers will get to experience this iconic duo in Star Wars&#39; original format at long last.
