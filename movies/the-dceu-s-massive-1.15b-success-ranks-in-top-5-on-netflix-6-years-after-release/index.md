## Literature Review

The DCEU&#39;s most successful film is currently dominating the charts on Netflix, over 5 years after it billions of dollars at the box office.




The DCEU&#39;s most successful film, Aquaman, continues to be popular as it sits in the top 5 of the Netflix film charts. The DCEU has a handful of misfires, but it also had several hits, topped by Aquaman&#39;s $1.15 billion performance at the worldwide box office. It&#39;s the only DCEU film that made over $1 billion, and it&#39;s clearly still of interest to viewers to stream.




While Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is doing significantly worse at the box office than its predecessor, Aquaman is succeeding on streaming while its sequel remains on the big screen. Several movies from the DCEU were recently been added to Netflix. Per Netflix, Aquaman sat at the No. 5 spot of their top 10 movies for the week of January 1-January 7. The film has dropped, now sitting at No. 10, but its recent success shows that the film has a lot of staying power with viewers.

                  Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom Review: The DCEU Ends Not With A Bang, But With A Whimper   Aquaman &amp; The Lost Kingdom is as goofy and adventurous as the first movie, but tries too hard for a seriousness it can never achieve with Jason Momoa.   


 Why Aquaman Was Such A Massive Success For The DCEU 
         

   Aquaman      Release Date    July 6, 2018     Director    James Wan     Cast    Willem Dafoe , Patrick Wilson , Randall Park , Ludi Lin , Dolph Lundgren , Michael Beach , Amber Heard , Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Jason Momoa , Temuera Morrison      




Momoa debuted as the DCEU&#39;s Arthur Curry, aka Aquaman, in Justice League, and his charismatic, rugged approach to the character stood in stark contrast to superhero media that historically treated him as a joke. There was a lot of anticipation for his first solo film, which seemed set to be a success before it came out. It has a phenomenal cast, including Nicole Kidman, Patrick Wilson, and Willem Dafoe, and it was helmed by James Wan, a director most associated with horror films like Insidious and The Conjuring. The mix of established talent in Aquaman&#39;s cast and a character under-explored on the big screen was easy to get excited about.

When the film debuted, it was met with mixed reviews from critics, with some finding fault in its generic story and goofy tone. However, audiences clearly found the film to be a ton of fun, likely enamored with its exquisite action sequences and massive underwater world. In a cinematic universe that was often criticized for taking itself too seriously, Aquaman was a refreshing change of pace despite its flaws. After the DCEU ended with an unfortunate string of several commercial failures, it&#39;s nice to look back at Aquaman and see the universe at its peak of success.
