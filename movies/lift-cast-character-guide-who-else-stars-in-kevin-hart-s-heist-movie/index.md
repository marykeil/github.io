## Literature Review

From Kevin Hart and Gugu Mbatha-Raw to Vincent D’Onofrio and Sam Worthington, Lift has a talented roster of actors who play intriguing characters.




Netflix&#39;s heist film, Lift, is driven by its talented cast members, who do an incredible job at portraying their respective characters. Directed by F. Gary Gray, known for helming films like Friday and The Fate of the Furious, Lift unfolds as a typical heist film that walks through the high takes and meticulous plans of a group of skilled individuals who take up a nearly impossible mission. From a diverse group of characters to intricate security systems and hacks, from hi-fi technology to twists and turns, the movie has all the ingredients of a compelling heist drama.




With its runtime of an hour and forty-four minutes, the Kevin Hart movie does not waste its time and jumps straight into the action by delivering a taut storyline. While its well-timed twists and overarching heist plan alone are gripping enough to keep viewers hooked, its action and drama are further elevated by the performance of its cast members. This makes it hard not to wonder which character is portrayed by whom in the film.

                  15 Best Heist Movies Of All Time, Ranked   The best heist movies can be comedies, dramas, or thrillers. But they all need an eclectic crew and a big score waiting for them at the end.   


 Kevin Hart as Cyrus Whitaker 
          

In Netflix&#39;s Lift, Cyrus is portrayed by Kevin Hart, who is best known for his leading roles in movies like Central Intelligence, Ride Along, The Man from Toronto, and Jumanji. However, long before he became one of the leading men in so many films, he started his career as an artist by winning several stand-up comedy competitions. He made his breakthrough by landing a recurring role in the TV series Undeclared and later went on to star in several comedy movies like Scary Movie 3, Soul Plane, Superhero Movie, and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Hart is also set to star in the videogame adaptation Borderlands and will also reprise his role as Ben Barber in Ride Along 3.




Kevin Hart plays the main character, Cyrus Whitaker, in Netflix&#39;s Lift, who leads an international heist crew. Although Cyrus steals art and rakes in huge sums of money from his heist endeavors, he ensures that the original artist of the art he steals always gets paid in dividends. This makes him somewhat of a Robin Hood-esque figure in the world of art. However, his central mission in Lift does not involve stealing art. Instead, he is given the responsibility of nicking $500 million in gold from a passenger plane as it flies from London to Zurich. Although the mission seems impossible, Cyrus ingeniously finds a way to make it happen.



 Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Abby Gladwell 
          

Gugu Mbatha-Raw convincingly portrays Abby Gladwell in Netflix&#39;s Lift. Born in Oxford, United Kingdom, she started her acting career with small roles in shows like Bad Girls. However, she now has over 50 credits in her acting portfolio and is mostly recognizable for playing roles in movies like Concussion, Beauty and the Beast, Belle, Motherless Brooklyn, The Cloverfield Paradox, and Summerland. She has also starred in several renowned TV shows, such as Loki, Black Mirror, and Doctor Who.




Abby Gladwell is a clever Interpol agent in Lift, who also happens to be Cyrus&#39; ex-flame. Although she initially tracks Cyrus and tries to stop him from abducting an artist, she later gets involved in Cyrus&#39; mission to steal gold from the passenger flight. Because of her history with Cyrus, things often get awkward between the two. However, the more time they spend together during the mission, the more they get to reconsider their feelings for one another. Abby is initially apprehensive about joining forces with Cyrus and his team but later becomes one of the leading forces in their heist mission.



 Vincent D’Onofrio as Denton 
          

Before Lift, Vincent D’Onofrio starred in several big-budget films, but he is best known for portraying Edgar in Men in Black, Pvt. Pyle in Full Metal Jacket, Carl Stargher in The Cell, and Vic Hoskins in Jurassic World. Many would also know from his recent appearances as Kingpin in the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s Echo, Hawkeye, and Daredevil. Long before Vincent D’Onofrio garnered fame for his diverse roles in Hollywood, he embraced a career in theater and was even a part of a Broadway play titled Open Admissions.




Vincent D’Onofrio&#39;s character, Denton, in Lift, is a master of disguise who has accompanied Cyrus on several missions in the past. In the gold-stealing mission, Denton adopts his usual role and uses his disguise mastery to distract the cabin crew from the aircraft they have to steal from. In the film&#39;s opening arc, he also becomes the key for Abby to finding Cyrus&#39; whereabouts.



 Sam Worthington as Dennis Huxley 
          

Born in Godalming, Surrey, UK, Sam Worthington started his acting career with the Aussie dance film Bootmen. He garnered acclaim and recognition for playing a major role in 2004&#39;s Somersault and became a household name in 2009 when he starred as Jake Sully in James Cameron&#39;s Avatar. Apart from the James Cameron franchise, Worthington has also played roles in other widely known films like Terminator Salvation, Clash of the Titans, and Hacksaw Ridge. He will also be reprising his role as Jake Sully in the future installments of James Cameron&#39;s Avatar films.




Lift introduces Sam Worthington&#39;s character as Dennis Huxley, Abby&#39;s boss at Interpol. It is his idea to hire Cyrus to steal the $500 million in gold. He uses his authority over Abby to make her convince Cyrus to take the mission. Although Huxley initially seems well-intended, the movie eventually reveals that there is more to him than meets the eye.
