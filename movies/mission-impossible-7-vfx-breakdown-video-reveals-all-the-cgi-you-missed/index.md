# Mission Impossible 7 VFX Breakdown Video Reveals All The CGI You Missed


## SUMMARY 



  A new VFX breakdown video reveals just how extensively Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One relies on digital effects.   Mission: Impossible&#39;s practical stunts and filmmaking often overshadow the extensive and crucial role that VFX play in bringing the movies to life, including in non-action scenes.   Unlike some of its contemporaries, Mission: Impossible&#39;s VFX often aren&#39;t jarring because they are used to enhance elements that were filmed practically.

## Literature Review

A breakdown video from Industrial Light &amp; Magic reveals all the hidden VFX work used to bring Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One to life.




Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One gets a new VFX breakdown video, revealing all the digital effects work that may have gone unnoticed. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the seventh installment in the long-running Mission: Impossible franchise sees Tom Cruise return as IMF agent Ethan Hunt to take down a rogue AI threat known as The Entity. The new film features some of the series&#39; most breathtaking stunts yet, with McQuarrie and Cruise putting a big focus on practical action.




A new video from Industrial Light &amp; Magic now breaks down the important role that VFX played in everything from Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One&#39;s ending train set piece to even a more straightforward sequence like Benji&#39;s airport bomb defusal. Check out the video below:


 

While certain scenes, like much of the train action, clearly rely on VFX to be pulled off safely, the video highlights just how important digital effects are in non-action scenes as well.

  


 Mission: Impossible&#39;s Reliance On VFX Explained 
          




Starting really with Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol&#39;s Burj Khalifa stunt, the Mission: Impossible movies now put practical stunt work front and center in their marketing, with Cruise&#39;s death-defying stunts able to serve as a movie&#39;s main selling point. While the filmmakers&#39; focus on practical action filmmaking is undoubtedly impressive and worth celebrating, it does sometimes overshadow the fact that most of the movies&#39; best stunts are only possible because of VFX.

Cruise&#39;s HALO jump in Mission: Impossible – Fallout, for example, features the star actually doing a high-altitude parachute jump. Most of the aerial background in this scene, however, which includes storm clouds and lightning, is all digital. The franchise&#39;s latest installment takes a similar approach with Cruise&#39;s motorcycle cliff-jump. While the actor does make the death-defying jump himself, VFX are used to replace the long ramp he drives off of with a rocky outcropping.



Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One&#39;s streaming release date is not yet known, but all six previous installments are available to stream on Paramount Plus.







As shown in the video above, Mission: Impossible&#39;s reliance on VFX goes far beyond just stunt work. Sometimes, certain sequences are just too expensive or too time-consuming to be worth doing entirely practically. Why Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One and its predecessors are visually a step above so many other action flicks, though, is because the franchise doesn&#39;t solely rely on VFX, often using it to enhance elements that have been filmed practically.
