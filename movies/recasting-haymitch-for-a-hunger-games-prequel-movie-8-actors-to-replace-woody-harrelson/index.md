## Literature Review

The Hunger Games franchise recently released its first franchise film, opening the door for a movie revolving around a young Haymitch and his Games.




With the recent expansion of The Hunger Games franchise, social media users have expressed interest in another prequel book/film that would take place during Haymitch&#39;s Games, which would require a recasting with a younger actor. Woody Harrelson is such a vital part of The Hunger Games franchise, that it can be hard to imagine someone else stepping into the role, but there are plenty of actors who could take on the challenge. With Mockingjay’s happy ending, there is no need for a sequel. However, there are many potential Hunger Games prequels, including one about the 50th Hunger Games where Haymich was named the victor.
Haymitch’s Games were mentioned briefly in The Hunger Games books and films. It was the Second Quarter Quell, where the number of tributes were doubled from 24 to 48. Though Haymitch came out on top as the lone survivor, like Katniss, Peeta, and so many others, he paid the price for his actions in the arena. The Haymitch prequel film could follow the storytelling of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes by being both about the Games and the aftermath. Just as Tom Blyth was able to bring a young President Snow to life in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, another actor can do the same with Haymitch.









 








 8  Louis Hofmann 
Know for Dark and All the Light We Cannot See


 







A popular fancast on social media for Young Haymitch in a Hunger Games prequel is 26-year-old German actor Louis Hofmann. The actor bears a strong resemblance to Harrelson, which would make the transformation into a younger version of him easily believable for audiences. Though Haymitch has become known for his shady burns and sarcastic remarks, it can be assumed that his snarkiness is more of a result of his life after the Games. Haymitch was just 16 when he competed in the 50th Hunger Games, and while growing up in District 12 may have hardened him, he would likely have a more youthful, perhaps even optimistic personality.
The actor playing Haymitch would also have to be physically strong to win the Games, with the role making physical demands. Hofmann has proven himself capable through his portrayal of a prisoner of war in Land of Mine and a soldier in All The Light We Cannot See.In these historical dramas, Hofmann’s characters deal with difficult, life-threatening circumstances while trying to remain hopeful for survival and a brighter future. With these roles under his belt, Hofmann would be a strong choice for Haymitch in a Hunger Games prequel.

 7  Tom Glynn-Carney 
Known for Dunkirk and House of the Dragon


 







With his long blonde hair, English actor Tom Glynn-Carney resembles Haymitch, but the justification for his potential casting goes beyond surface-level similarities. Glynn-Carney first gained attention through his breakthrough role as Peter Dawson in Christopher Nolan’s Dunkirk. Like Hofmann, the physical demands of the war drama would have primed him for the deadly arena of The Hunger Games.
Lately, Glynn-Carney has received praise for his performance as Aegon II Targaryen in the Game of Thronesprequel series, House of the Dragon. In his youth, Aegon indulges heavily in alcohol, which leads him to make some poor, sometimes violent decisions. He is also characterized as lazy, which can be seen in Haymitch’s often lackadaisical approach to mentoring. If the Hunger Games prequel were to explore the tragic aftermath of Haymitch’s victory and his downward spiral into substance abuse, Glynn-Carney has already shown he can perform such a role.





 6  Taz Skylar 
Known for One Piece
        

By being cast for Netflix’s live-action One Piece series, Taz Skylar has already brought a popular character to the screen in a different way. For the Netflix show, the Spanish and British actor changed up his looks to play Sanji, who happens to have some physical similarities to Haymitch. While One Piece isn’t Skylar’s first role, it’s his most notable, as well as the one that proves he’d make a great Young Haymitch in a Hunger Games prequel film.
Like Haymitch, Sanji is calm and cool, which likely worked in his favor when being thrown into a bloodbath in The Hunger Games. He also possesses Haymitch’s cleverness, which won him his Games as he outsmarted both the tributes and Gamemaker. However, what makes Skylar a strong choice for Young Haymitch is his charisma, which Harrelson oozes as Haymitch in The Hunger Games films. Even when Haymitch can be abrasive and short with people, which is a part of his character that probably didn’t develop until later in life, it’s hard not to be drawn to him.





 5  Ewan Mitchell 
Known for House of the Dragon and The Last Kingdom


 







Another House of the Dragon actor who could take on the role of Young Haymitch is Ewan Mitchell, who plays Aemond Targaryen, the younger brother of Aegon. Unlike Aegon, Mitchell plays Aemond with a serious disposition that would show off a different side of a young Haymitch as he goes to face what he may have believed to be sure death. He also has a frightening drive that would have helped Haymitch make it to the very end of The Hunger Games. This would also be fitting for Haymitch’s character post-Games when he loses his family and any of the innocence and youthfulness he may have had left.

 4  Drew Starkey 
Known for Outer Banks
        

Another fancast that has gained traction on social media for Young Haymitch in The Hunger Games is Drew Starkey, best known for his role as Rafe Cameron in Outer Banks. While Haymitch would be the hero of the 50th Games, Starkey’s Rafe is the villain of Outer Banks. He’s been excessively violent with other characters and even killed Sheriff Peterkin, showcasing the kind of behavior that someone might need to be the last one standing in a group of 47 others. Starkey could embody the darker side of Haymitch both during and after the Games in a Hunger Games prequel film that haunts him to this day. 







 3  Harris Dickinson 
Known for Triangle of Sadness and The Iron Claw


 







An actor who has received great attention recently is Harris Dickinson, who is fresh off his performance as David Von Erich in A24’s The Iron Claw. For this role, Dickinson had to get into fighting shape, which could be a bonus in playing Young Haymitch. The wrestler is portrayed in The Iron Claw as a great showman, which may draw more similarities to Peeta than Haymitch. Yet, Haymitch was the one who nurtured and guided Peeta towards that strategy in The Hunger Games, suggesting he used similar tactics during his own Games.
Dickinson also has experience playing a character thrown into battle from his performance in The King’s Man. Rather than being reaped like Haymitch, his character goes against his father’s wishes to fight in the Great War. The rebelliousness and desire to blaze his own trail can be seen in Haymitch as well, which Dickinson could bring out of him in a Hunger Games prequel film.





 2  Judah Lewis 
Known for The Babysitter and The Christmas Chronicles
        

Judah Lewis began acting as a young teenager and is one of the younger options at 22, making him a more age-appropriate choice to play 16-year-old Haymitch in The Hunger Games prequel. Lewis has appeared in a variety of films, including black comedy slasher The Babysitter and its sequel, in which he plays a boy who discovers his babysitter is trying to kill him. Though they were comedic, The Babysitter films allowed Lewis to show off his acting chops, including the PTSD he grappled with in the sequel that Haymitch also would have dealt with after the Games. 





 1  Will Poulter 
Known for The Maze Runner and Dopesick


 







With his previous role in The Maze Runner, Will Poulter has experience with young adult dystopian adaptation films. Though he was initially a villain in the series, he was afforded a redemption arc in the sequel. Maze Runner: The Death Cure aired 5 years ago, and Poulter has moved on to more mature roles, including his Emmy Award-nominated performance in the Hulu miniseries Dopesick.
While he’s on the older side, Poulter’s experience as an actor would benefit him when playing a complex character like Young Haymitch in The Hunger Games. Through Maze Runner, he solidified himself as an action star who can tell a more complex story aimed at younger audiences. Poulter being a recognizable face could also work in his favor as it could make viewers even more excited for the potential The Hunger Games prequel.
