## Literature Review



From HAL 9000 to Thanos, some sci-fi villains stand out as the very best. Many of the best sci-fi movies of all time are defined by their iconic villains, from alien lifeforms to enhanced AI to human beings with a lust for power. Sci-fi antagonists tend to pose mass existential threats, adding an edge of terror to them. Given the immense commercial popularity of the genre, many great sci-fi villains have had a profound cultural effect and inspiring cinematic impact.
Many factors can make a great science fiction antagonist. Characters like Roy Batty and Khan excel due to the complexity of their motivations, while Darth Vader and the Xenomorph became instantly iconic due to the ingenuity of their design. Hugo Weaving and Robert Patrick brought their legendary villains to life with unbelievable performances in The Matrix and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, respectively. Through decades of science fiction films, some villains stand out due to these parameters.

From Star Trek and Star Wars to The Expanse, sci-fi movies and TV shows are littered with iconic spaceships, but which one is actually the fastest?













 








 10  The Thing 
The Thing (1982) 
 The Thing (1982) 
A team of researchers set out to study an alien spacecraft found in Antarctica, where they also discover an alien body on the site. The alien buried in ice is actually alive and has the ability to imitate human form. The group must find a way to distinguish who the real person is from The Thing and stay alive. John Carpenter&#39;s 1982 film is a remake of 1951&#39;s The Thing from Another World and stars Kurt Russel as the hero RJ MacReady.
 Release Date   June 25, 1982    Director   John Carpenter    Cast   T.K. Carter , David Clennon , Keith David , Kurt Russell , wilford brimley    Rating   R    Runtime   109 minutes    




The titular character in the John Carpenter classic is distinct from many sci-fi villains because it&#39;s more of a force of nature than a refined character. The Thing is a species trying to survive and assimilate, and its grotesque practical effects make it a terrifying threat. However, the ability to shapeshift creates a captivating sense of paranoia and suspense, something Carpenter excels at with his monster movies.





 9  Immortan Joe 
Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) 
 Mad Max: Fury Road 
Mad Max: Fury Road is the fourth film in George Miller&#39;s long-running sci-fi franchise, with Tom Hardy starring as Max Rockstansky, a vagabond who lives on the road in an apocalyptic wasteland. When Max comes across a cult group that keeps its people in fear and under control with a monopoly on water and other crucial supplies, he joins up with Imperator Furiosa, a warrior woman leading a rebellion against the cult&#39;s leader, Immortan Joe.
 Release Date   May 14, 2015    Director   George Miller    Cast   Tom Hardy , Charlize Theron , Nicholas Hoult , Zoe Kravitz , Hugh Keays-Byrne , Riley Keough , Courtney Eaton , Abbey Lee , Rosie Huntington-Whiteley    Rating   R    Runtime   120 Minutes    




Despite being released decades after its predecessor, Mad Max: Fury Road became the best film in its franchise, and Immortan Joe was a huge reason why. The intense, power-hungry tyrant adds to the bleak, post-apocalyptic world portrayed in the Mad Max franchise, excellently performed by Hugh Keays-Byrne. Immortan Joe is such a despicable, terrible character, yet he&#39;s made complex by his societal leadership that holds together the last threads of structure.

 8  T-1000 
Terminator 2: Judgement Day 
 Terminator 2: Judgment Day 
Directed by James Cameron, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a direct sequel to the original Terminator and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Robert Patrick, and Linda Hamilton. In this installment, John Connor is being hunted by an advanced Skynet prototype from the future. Thankfully, he receives help from a reprogrammed T-800 sent back in time by the resistance to protect him.
 Release Date   July 3, 1991    Director   James Cameron    Cast   Arnold Schwarzenegger , Linda Hamilton , Robert Patrick , Edward Furlong    Rating   R    Runtime   137 Minutes    




While The Terminator introduced Arnold Schwarzenneger as the antagonist T-800, the sequel cleverly subverted expectations by making him the hero. And the only thing more threatening than the original Terminator is an upgraded version. T-1000&#39;s sole motivation is to eliminate its target, making him a relentless threat, perfectly brought to life by Robert Patrick&#39;s cold, calculating performance. The upgraded machine&#39;s ability to shapeshift and mimic gives it an edge, making T-1000 an unrelenting and unpredictable force.





 7  Xenomorph 
The Alien Franchise 
  Alien (1979) 
Alien is a sci-fi horror-thriller by director Ridley Scott that follows the crew of a spaceship known as the Nostromo. After the staff of the merchant&#39;s vessel perceives an unknown transmission as a distress call, its landing on the source moon finds one of the crew members attacked by a mysterious lifeform, and they soon realize that its life cycle has merely begun.
 Release Date   June 22, 1979    Director   Ridley Scott    Cast   Sigourney Weaver , Ian Holm , John Hurt , Veronica Cartwright , Harry Dean Stanton , Tom Skerritt , Yaphet Kotto    Rating   R    Runtime   117 minutes    




Ridley Scott&#39;s original Alien film was lightning in a bottle, creating one of the most iconic movie monsters ever. The allure that spawned a franchise of sequels was for the Xenomorph, a villain so terrifying because of its relentless, single-minded nature. The Xenomorph is an invasive predator that wants to get to survive, reproduce, and kill. While movies like E.T. portrayed aliens as friendly creatures, Alien posed the idea that they might be horrifying, murderous creatures, and the practical effects and design perfectly established its threat.





 6  Khan 
Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan (1982)
        

Ricardo Montalb√°n&#39;s Khan Noonien Singh distinguished himself as one of the greatest Star Trek villains in the original series. In just one episode, Khan proved to be such a good villain that it launched Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, widely considered the best Star Trek movie. Among great alien or AI sci-fi villains, Khan distinguishes himself as a human being with complex motivations of revenge and lust for power. Given the franchise&#39;s enormous popularity, being at the pinnacle of Star Trek antagonists solidifies Khan as a legendary sci-fi villain.





 5  Thanos 
The Marvel Cinematic Universe
        

 Marvel Cinematic Universe 
The Marvel Cinematic Universe is a multimedia superhero franchise that began in 2008 with Paramount&#39;s Iron Man starring Robert Downey Jr. The franchise quickly grew in popularity, with Disney eventually buying out Marvel Entertainment in 2009. The MCU consists of dozens of movies and TV shows, most notably Avengers: Endgame, WandaVision, and Loki.
 Created by   Kevin Feige    




While many of sci-fi&#39;s best villains have been around for decades, Thanos became an instant legend in phase one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It&#39;s always enjoyable to watch a villain who thinks he&#39;s doing the right thing, and actor Josh Brolin brilliantly brings him to life, delivering iconic quotes left and right. Set up in The Avengers, the anticipation for the Mad Titan to arrive built excitement for years, making Thanos&#39; victory in Avengers: Infinity War so powerful.





 4  Roy Batty 
Blade Runner (1982)
        

 Blade Runner 
The original Blade Runner is a sci-fi neo-noir film set in 2019 in a dystopian cyber-punk society. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard as a Blade Runner for the LAPD, tasked with hunting rogue replicants, genetically engineered humans designed to tackle tasks that human beings cannot. When four replicants go rogue and begin killing humans, Deckard is forced out of retirement to hunt them down and stop them - but the truth isn&#39;t as simple as it seems. Deckard will have to reckon with the philosophical dilemma of what makes someone human.
 Release Date   June 25, 1982    Director   Ridley Scott    Cast   Harrison Ford , Rutger Hauer , Sean Young , Edward James Olmos , M. Emmet Walsh , Daryl Hannah , William Sanderson , Joe Turkel    Rating   R    Runtime   117 minutes    




Despite being a replicant, Blade Runner&#39;s Roy Batty is an iconic villain due to his deeply human qualities. In the final action sequence of the 1982 classic, Batty is as menacing as any character in movie history. However, it&#39;s the final soliloquy he gives before his death that makes him so memorable. He doesn&#39;t want to be evil; he just wants to live longer than his coding allows. Batty chooses to save Deckard as a final moment of redemption, proving that replicants aren&#39;t just mindless machines but beings who want to leave some mark on the world, just like humans.





 3  HAL 9000 
2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)
        

 2001: A Space Odyssey 
2001: A Space Odyssey is one of Stanley Kubrick&#39;s most well-known films. A science-fiction epic, the film tells the story of the journey of Discovery One, a spacecraft operated by a group of scientists, astronauts, and a sentient computer, on a mission to Jupiter to investigate a mysterious monolith. Considered one of the greatest films ever made, Kubrick combines sparse dialogue with the heavy use of scoring and ambiguous imagery to create something that eschews conventional filmmaking.¬†
 Release Date   April 2, 1968    Director   Stanley Kubrick    Cast   Keir Dullea , Gary Lockwood , William Sylvester , Daniel Richter , Leonard Rossiter , Margaret Tyzack    Runtime   149 minutes    




Stanley Kubrick&#39;s 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the best movies of all time, and while that&#39;s in large part due to the artistic mastery of its director, HAL is the film&#39;s most iconic and memorable character. The ship&#39;s AI is a rather subtle villain with a simple, eye-like design and a calm, emotionless voice. That unsettling simplicity and clearly artificial nature make HAL such a timeless cinematic villain, as it makes its malevolent motivations so believable and existentially frightening. In a film filled with abstract sequences, the confrontation with HAL is the most straightforward and resonant.





 2  Agent Smith 
The Matrix Franchise


Close







Hugo Weaving expertly brought the menacing Agent Smith to life in The Matrix trilogy. His uniform design and intense demeanor make him the perfect representation of the machine force that controls the simulation. As a physical threat, his ability to replicate himself makes him the perfect foil to a human resistance: an overwhelming, relentless, all-powerful opposition. But it&#39;s Agent Smith&#39;s monologues and dialogue scenes that make him so memorable, presenting philosophical ideas like the &#34;human beings are a disease&#34; speech.





 1  Darth Vader 
Star Wars Original Trilogy


Close







 Star Wars 
Star Wars is a multimedia franchise that started in 1977 by creator George Lucas. After the release of Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope (originally just titled Star Wars), the franchise quickly exploded, spawning multiple sequels, prequels, TV shows, video games, comics, and much more. After Disney acquired the rights to the franchise, they quickly expanded the universe on Disney&#43;, starting with The Mandalorian.
 Created by   George Lucas    




From his opening entry in Star Wars, Darth Vader brings an imposing presence very few movie villains possess. But beneath the iconic mechanical helmet, there&#39;s a tragic hero who fell from grace, with something deep down tugging back and forth between light and dark. Vader&#39;s reveal as Luke Skywalker&#39;s father was a pivotal moment in cinematic history, making his redemption in Return of the Jedi even more poignant. He&#39;s not only the best sci-fi villain; Darth Vader is arguably one of the greatest movie villains ever.
