## Literature Review

A new Spider-Man 4 fan trailer imagines Tom Holland&#39;s Peter Parker becoming a massively twisted version of Venom in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.




Tom Holland&#39;s Peter Parker becomes a new incarnation of Venom for the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a new Spider-Man 4 fan trailer. Despite some of the ups and downs with the MCU in Phases 4 and 5, Spider-Man: No Way Home is still the biggest success in the Multiverse Saga. Following its massive box office results, Holland is expected to return for Spider-Man 4 as the start of a potential sequel trilogy.




While the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA strikes ended in 2023, there have been very few Spider-Man 4 movie updates to this point. As the world waits to get any news for Spider-Man 4, which is still in development at Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios, TeaserPro shared a fan trailer for what could potentially be the plot point for the upcoming MCU movie.


 

The Spider-Man 4 fan trailer pitches the idea that Peter is now attending college while still being a crime-fighter. However, the bigger twist with the Spider-Man 4 trailer is that not only does Peter bond with the symbiote, but he also becomes a different iteration of Venom.

                  6 Perfect Spider-Man 4 Villains The MCU Has Already Set Up   Tom Holland&#39;s Spider-Man 4 is in the works, and following his first trilogy, the MCU has already set up great villain choices for his next film.   





 How Venom Is Set Up For Spider-Man 4 
         

Despite having a small cameo in Spider-Man: No Way Home, Tom Hardy&#39;s Venom managed to set up Peter&#39;s own symbiote arc for Spider-Man 4. As Eddie Brock was being sent back to his own universe, a piece of the Venom symbiote ended up getting left behind on Earth-199999 as it slowly began to crawl away. With the MCU being known for having post-credits scenes setting up future adventures, this was clearly meant to soft start Holland&#39;s sequel trilogy.

However, Spider-Man: No Way Home&#39;s symbiote tease is also the perfect setup in light of where Peter is by the end of the film. With the whole world having forgotten who he is, Peter is now on his own - and at some point, that loneliness can and will likely consume him, making him a perfect target for the symbiote. That in itself becomes an intriguing challenge as he, without the resources of the Avengers, will have to find a way to get rid of the symbiote in Spider-Man 4, if that ends up being the main storyline.






Based on Venom 3 set photos, the Sony movie will pick up directly with Eddie after the events of Spider-Man: No Way Home.




As the Multiverse Saga goes forward, time will tell how Spider-Man 4 fits into the future of the franchise. With all the shake-ups going on at Marvel Studios, Spider-Man 4 will ideally not get lost in the mix. Hopefully, as 2024 goes forward, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures will have more to reveal about Spider-Man 4 sooner rather than later.
