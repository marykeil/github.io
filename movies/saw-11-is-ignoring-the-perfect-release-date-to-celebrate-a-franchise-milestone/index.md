# Saw 11 Is Ignoring The Perfect Release Date To Celebrate A Franchise Milestone


## SUMMARY 






  The release of Saw 11 one month before the franchise&#39;s 20th anniversary misses a big opportunity to celebrate.   Releasing Saw 11 on the anniversary date or the Friday before would be a better timed release for the franchise.

## Literature Review

Saw 11 already has a September 2024 release date, but the franchise is missing a huge opportunity to celebrate an important milestone in October.




Saw 11 already has a release date, but it ignores a perfect one with which it could have celebrated a big franchise milestone. The Saw franchise is far from over and will continue to expand with an eleventh movie, known for now simply as Saw 11. After the disappointment of Jigsaw in 2017 and the 2021 spinoff movie Spiral, the Saw franchise went back to John Kramer (Tobin Bell) in Saw X. To reunite with Kramer, Saw X is both a sequel and a prequel, set between the events of Saw and Saw II, and it set up a sequel that is also expected to serve as a prequel to one of the previous movies.




Saw X followed John Kramer as he traveled to México City for an experimental procedure that would supposedly cure his terminal cancer. Unfortunately, it turns out to be a scam, so he goes back to his Jigsaw ways to teach them a lesson. The ending of Saw X left the door open for a sequel, which was confirmed to be in development in December 2023. Saw 11 already has a release date of September 27, 2024, almost a year after the release of Saw X – however, by releasing Saw 11 in late September, the franchise is missing the perfect way to celebrate a big milestone.

                  Saw 11 Is The Perfect Chance To Bring Back The Franchise&#39;s Original Protagonist   If Saw XI follows the steps of Saw X, it can naturally bring back the franchise&#39;s original protagonist, who was unfairly killed in Saw III.   


 Saw 11 Is Releasing One Month Before The Franchise&#39;s 20th Anniversary 
          




The Saw franchise has become one of the most popular ones in the horror genre and has built a solid fanbase that continues to watch the horrors designed by Kramer and his followers. The saga began in 2003 with the short film Saw 0.5, which Leigh Whannell and James Wan used to pitch the movie and get the financial backup to produce it. The short film was a success and Saw was brought to life, with Wan as director and Whannell playing Adam, one of Jigsaw’s victims in the infamous bathroom. Saw was released on October 29, 2004, marking the beginning of one of the best horror franchises in recent years.

The franchise will celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2024, and it’s quite fitting that a new Saw movie will be released this year. However, Saw 11 is missing a huge opportunity to celebrate this big milestone by being released a month before the anniversary. Saw 11 arriving almost a year after Saw X came out follows a recent horror trend seen with movies like David Gordon Green’s Halloween reboot trilogy in which a sequel is released a year later, and while this ensures that the audience will keep its interest in the franchise, in Saw 11’s case it has a much more significant release date option.






 The Saw Franchise&#39;s Anniversary Would Make For A Better Saw 11 Release Date 
          

While releasing Saw 11 on September 27, 2024, works as it’s a sequel to Saw X, the franchise’s anniversary would be a better release date, regardless of the story and place in the timeline of the new movie. Although releasing Saw 11 on the exact day of the franchise’s anniversary would be tricky as October 29 falls on a Tuesday in 2024, putting Saw 11 out the Friday before (October 25) would be better timed than releasing it in September. There’s still time for Saw 11 to get a different release date, but for now, it’s missing a huge chance.
