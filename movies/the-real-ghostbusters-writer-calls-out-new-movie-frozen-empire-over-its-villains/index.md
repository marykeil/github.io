## Literature Review

The Real Ghostbusters animated show writer J. Michael Straczynski calls out Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire for how they handled their new villains.




The writer behind The Real Ghostbusters calls out Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire for its villains. The Real Ghostbusters was an animated series that ran from 1986 to 1991. Soon, the Ghostbusters franchise will continue with Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which is set for release on March 22.




The Real Ghostbusters writer J. Michael Straczynski criticizes the new film’s approach towards the villains. As Straczynski notes on Twitter, he was not consulted when the upcoming Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire decided to adapt villains from the animated series into the film.


 

Straczynski, joking but with a hint of saltiness, said that he was “trying to remember who created and/or developed some of those &#39;weird-as-f*ck villains.&#39;” He went on to say that “he could have been of help if they had just reached out to him.”


 Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire’s Connection with The Real Ghostbusters 
         




Straczynski&#39;s quote Tweet featured an Empire article where Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire director Gil Kenan said that the film will feature some of the “wild, original and weird-as-fuck villains” from The Real Ghostbusters. Kenan mentioned that they “wanted to bring that show’s looseness and fearlessness to this movie.” Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire will include monsters such as a Sewer Dragon and a horned beast in the mist.

                  Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire Avoiding 1 Character’s Return Is A Great Sign For The Franchise   One of the franchise&#39;s most infamous characters will not return for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire, which is a good sign for the franchise&#39;s future.   

However, despite Straczynski&#39;s involvement with creating said iconic villains from The Real Ghostbusters — including a werechicken and a boogeyman — it seems he was not consulted in the character development for Frozen Empire. Instead, the film was co-written by Kenan and Ghostbusters: Afterlife director Jason Reitman. Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire is credited as being based on the film Ghostbusters written by Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd and directed by Ivan Reitman, rather than the stories developed by Straczynski.




Consulting with Straczynski could have been the right move for Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire if Kenan is correctly characterizing the film’s inspiration. For a movie attempting to balance nostalgia with a new story, it seems odd not to honor The Real Ghostbusters creators who made some of the franchise oddities happen. Hopefully, Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire still manages to craft worthwhile villains.
