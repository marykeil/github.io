## Literature Review

Chuck Norris has an action and martial arts filmography that lives up to his legendary meme status.




An accomplished actor, Chuck Norris has a diverse array of action films under his belt that run a wide gulf in quality, with the ten best among them being indicative of a star-status-worthy career. Though he may be better known by many of the younger generation for the series of memes using Chuck Norris&#39; name, depicting him as a stalwart, legendary figure with unparalleled machismo and ability, these jokes did, in fact, stem from his movie appearances. Typically playing characters that are stoic, indomitable forces of gritty heroism, Chuck Norris&#39; filmography makes it clear how he got his reputation.
Like all the best martial arts movie stars, Norris was a fighter first, and an actor second, earning a black belt in the Korean fighting style Tang Soo Do long before ever stepping on a film set. Chuck Norris would go on to develop his own unique martial art, Chun Kuk Do, proving his mastery of hand-to-hand combat displayed many times over in his acting career. While he may be the most well known for his work in T.V., carrying Walker, Texas Ranger for 9 seasons, his movie appearances are nothing to scoff at.









 








 10  Firewalker 
1986
        

An attempt to cash in on the success of Indiana Jones&#39; globe-trotting adventures that audiences were devouring in the mid 80s, Firewalker is a fun film that, while entertaining, doesn&#39;t put Chuck Norris in the best light he&#39;s ever been in. Playing one half of an uncharacteristically funny treasure-hunting duo, across Lou Gosset, Norris&#39; Max Donigan must contend with dangerous jungles, ravenous alligators, and the devious villain El Coyote. While not a bad showing for an action adventure exploration romp, Firewalker&#39;s limited imagination, paper-thin dialogue, and very dated indigenous representation keep it in the bottom echelon of Chuck Norris&#39; filmography.





 9  The Delta Force 
1986
        

Certainly nothing groundbreaking, both within the context of Chuck Norris&#39; own career and 80s action films in general, The Delta Force features the star as Major Scott McCoy, returning to the titular special forces group after a five-year absence. It&#39;s up to Major McCoy to save a plane full of innocent hostages from a volatile terrorist group with limited backup, presenting a tense shoot-em-up that more than earns its R-rating. Almost more of a disaster or war movie at times, The Delta Force presents some great action setpieces that are undercut by the film&#39;s sluggish final edit.





 8  The Octagon 
1980


 







 r to Chuck Norris&#39; martial arts roots rather than the super-cops and commandos of his later career, The Octagon is an amazingly cheesy martial-arts thriller with a surprisingly heady tone. Master of two worlds, Norris faces off entire hordes of ninjas as expert combatant Scott James, all the while giving the audience a window into his mind with an intrepid inner monologue. Sprinkle in a surprise appearance by Lee Van Cleef of all people as James&#39; martial arts nemesis and ninja clan master, and The Octagon leaves an unforgettable impression, despite its uneven tone and bizarre narrative choices.





 7  Missing In Action 
1984


 







As a veteran of the U.S. Air Force himself, it&#39;s no wonder that Chuck Norris would frequently play military men throughout his acting career. Enter Missing In Action, which sees Norris as Colonel James Braddock, a former prisoner of the Vietnam War who goes back to rescue imprisoned soldiers callously written off as M.I.A. As great as Missing In Action is, it&#39;s impossible to ignore the Rambo series comparison, though it managed to beat the release of Rambo: First Blood Part II by a whole year.





 6  Code Of Silence 
1985
        

Continuing Chuck Norris&#39; penchant for beating hallmark 80s action movies to the punch, Code of Silence saw Chuck Norris contending with violent gangs alongside a robotic sidekick a solid two years before Robocop could lurch into theaters. Beyond the surface-level similarities, Norris&#39; Sergeant Cusack also finds himself facing corruption within his department, unwilling to support his crusade due to his enduring principles. Featuring the use of a rocket launcher that nearly outdoes Arnold&#39;s Commando of the same year, Code of Silence is a gritty, grueling urban slog through a near-future Chicago that is still ultimately hampered by point of comparison to other 80s classics.





 5  Silent Rage 
1982
        

Whereas much of Chuck Norris&#39; filmography is unable to avoid direct comparison to other iconic action films, Silent Rage is a wholly original chiller that pits a typical hero of the actor&#39;s range against a horror movie villain. Pitting a kung-fu-wielding Texas Sheriff against an un-killable, undead ax killer is an exciting enough logline to raise eyebrows, and Silent Rage delivers on its promises with great fight scenes, supporting performances, and one of Norris&#39; less one-note characters. A delicate balance of horror and action, Silent Rage is only held back by the utter ridiculous conceit of its premise.





 4  The Expendables 2 
2012
        

Not keen to draw out his career past the point of credulity, Norris had largely retired from action movie roles before returning to star in The Expendables 2. Taking his place in the tribute series to action legends alongside Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Jet Li, Norris got in on the gloriously over-the-top action with more than one nod to the camera. The Expendables 2 comes the closest to any film to acknowledging Norris&#39; meme status -- When asked about a cobra bite his character had received, Norris responds, &#34;after five days of agonizing pain, the cobra died&#34;.





 3  Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial By Fire 
2005
        

After four years, Chuck Norris returned to reprise the role of Texas Ranger Captain Cordell Walker for Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire. A triumphant return to form for the series, Captain Walker doesn&#39;t miss a step shouldering the responsibilities of a winding plot regarding a runaway boy and the dangerous weapons targeting system he possesses. While the film doesn&#39;t quite stand on its own, being somewhat reliant on previous knowledge of the original show to be fully appreciated, it nonetheless presents some of Norris&#39; best action, sullied somewhat by the film&#39;s lackluster conclusion to Walker&#39;s overarching story.





 2  Lone Wolf McQuade 
1983
        

Ever typecast as a Texas Ranger, Chuck Norris&#39; performance as J.J. McQuade in his eponymous movie appearance is the all-American hero at his gunslinging, explosion dodging best. Best described as a modern Western, Lone Wolf McQuade gives viewers a lot to appreciate, from the social commentary and unlikely alliance of McQuade and two federal officers to Norris&#39; bristling chest hair and ever-unbeatable martial arts acumen. The film slowly builds to its climactic final battle like a high-power pressure cooker, resulting in one of the all-time greatest showings of Chuck Norris&#39; action career.





 1  The Way Of The Dragon 
1972


 







Despite being known for playing a hero, Chuck Norris&#39; breakout role saw him instead taking the mantle of a villain, as the vicious thug, Colt. It says a lot that Norris is able to not only hold his own against the late Bruce Lee&#39;s charisma, but can convincingly trade blows with the martial arts icon in what is widely considered to be one of his best films. With some of the best hand-to-hand fighting of the decade that was committed enough to its final battle to film illegally in the Roman Colosseum, The Way of the Dragon is the undeniable crowning achievement of Chuck Norris&#39; storied career.
