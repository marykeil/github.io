 Non-linear narratives can create mystery and ambiguity, challenge audience expectations, and showcase innovative storytelling techniques. 




Non-linear movies can play with time in ways beyond a character traveling to the past or future. A select number of directors and writers can expertly weave together the past, present, and future into intriguing non-linear narratives. Their options include narratives that work backward or are completely scattered, comprising several different timelines.
While flashbacks are the most straightforward way to form a non-linear narrative, this is not where the concept ends. Some movies compare seemingly unrelated events to demonstrate the significance of recurring patterns and themes throughout history. Intentional ambiguity about the separation of the past and present creates an intriguing mystery. A character hunting for answers after a case of amnesia is also common in non-linear movies. Overall, the non-linear category includes some of cinema&#39;s most innovative movies that defy all expectations.



 10  Cloud Atlas (2012) 
Different people affect each other&#39;s lives across 500 years.


Close







 Cloud Atlas 

 Release Date   October 26, 2012    Director   Tom Tykwer , Lilly Wachowski , Lana Wachowski    Cast   Tom Hanks , Halle Berry , Jim Broadbent , Hugo Weaving , Jim Sturgess , Doona Bae    Rating   R    Runtime   172minutes    




 The Wachowski sisters&#39; Cloud Atlas encompasses many characters, places, and times. Cloud Atlas&#39; story is split among five narratives: a lawyer who is slowly poisoned by his doctor during a voyage across the Pacific in the mid-19th century; an aspiring composer writing letters to his lover in Britain in the early 20th century; a reporter investigating a corrupt power plant in 1970s San Francisco; a failing British publisher trapped in a nursing home in 2012; a clone rebelling again the system in 2144 Seoul; and a tribesman investigating mysterious ruins in post-apocalyptic Hawaii.
Cloud Atlas cuts between narratives, showing moments of action centuries apart as though they are happening at the same time. The lives of all the characters are intertwined: The composer reads the lawyer&#39;s journal; the journalist finds the love letters that belonged to her informant&#39;s ancestor; the fugitive clone becomes a deity to the future tribesmen. Noteworthy actors, including Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, and Jim Broadbent, take on various roles across different periods. Ultimately, Cloud Atlas is based on the theme that the entire cast is bound by their love for and dependence upon other people.

 9  Mulholland Drive (2001) 
A woman loses her memory in a car crash and searches for answers in Hollywood.
        

 Mulholland Drive 

 Release Date   October 19, 2001    Director   David Lynch    Cast   Laura Elena Harring , Mark Pellegrino , Justin Theroux , Naomi Watts , Ann Miller    Rating   R    Runtime   147 minutes    




 David Lynch&#39;s Mulholland Drive follows an aspiring actress new to Hollywood helping a woman with amnesia piece together the events surrounding the car crash on Mulholland Drive in which she lost her memory. Betty and Rita investigate the mysterious Diane Selwyn, trying to solve a puzzle that may have no answer. However, Mulholland Drive&#39;s ending disrupts the seemingly linear narrative and throws into question what timeline coincides with reality. There are many interpretations of Mulholland Drive, and it requires multiple watches before the audience can completely understand its events, heightening the story&#39;s mystery.


 8  Citizen Kane (1941) 
Orson Wells was a pioneer of non-linear movies.
        

 Citizen Kane 

 Release Date   April 17, 1941    Director   Orson Welles    Cast   Orson Welles , Joseph Cotten , Dorothy Comingore , Agnes Moorehead , Ruth Warrick , Ray Collins    Rating   PG    Runtime   119 minutes    




Orson Welles was one of the first directors of a successful movie with a non-linear narrative. In Citizen Kane, different flashbacks from various perspectives slowly reveal details about the life of the reclusive publisher Charles Foster Kane as present-day reporters try to understand the meaning of his last words. Citizen Kane&#39;s ending reveals the meaning of &#34;rosebud,&#34; but the movie has still been a topic of debate for decades. Citizen Kane is considered the &#34;greatest movie ever made&#34; because of its innovative storytelling, introducing unreliable narrators and twist endings to cinema.


 7  Last Night In Soho (2021) 
Thomasin McKenzie in the present overlaps with Anya Taylor-Joy in the past.
        

 Last Night in Soho 

 Release Date   October 29, 2021    Director   Edgar Wright    Cast   Anya Taylor-Joy , Lisa McGrillis , Michael Ajao , Matt Smith , Margaret Nolan , Synnove Karlsen , Diana Rigg , Oliver Phelps , Thomasin McKenzie , Jessie Mei Li , Terence Stamp , Rita Tushingham , James Phelps    Rating   R    Runtime   116 minutes    




Thomasin McKenzie plays Eloise &#34;Ellie&#34; Turner, an aspiring fashion designer who moves to London for school and finds her life affected by the ghost of Anya Taylor-Joy&#39;s Sandie, an aspiring singer of 1960s London. Eloise is initially thrilled by her dreams of Sandie&#39;s life, making Sandie her fashion muse. Yet the tragic events of Sandie&#39;s life start to intrude upon Eloise in the form of violent visions, leading up to Last Night in Soho&#39;s shocking ending. While Eloise and Sandie&#39;s narratives overlap, Matt Smith and Diana Rigg play memorable supporting roles.

 6  Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) 
A couple have their memories of each other surgically removed.
        

 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 

 Release Date   March 19, 2004    Director   Michel Gondry    Cast   Kate Winslet , Jim Carrey , Elijah Wood , Kirsten Dunst , Mark Ruffalo    Rating   R    Runtime   108 minutes    




Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star in the unusually psychological rom-com, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. After the main characters&#39; romance falls apart, they both undergo surgery to remove their memories of each other. A present-day narrative about the surgeries is interwoven with flashbacks of the relationship. However, the flashbacks are also revealed out of chronological order. The unusual narrative sequence leading to Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&#39;s ending is used to demonstrate the mistake Joel and Clementine made in wanting to forget each other.


 5  Glass Onion (2022) 
Benoit Blanc&#39;s second mystery resets midway.


Close







 Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery 

 Release Date   December 23, 2022    Director   Rian Johnson    Cast   Dave Bautista , Daniel Craig , Edward Norton , Janelle Monae , Kathryn Hahn , Leslie Odom Jr. , Jessica Henwick , Madelyn Cline , Kate Hudson , Ethan Hawke    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   139 minutes    




 Knives Out follows a relatively linear narrative, depicting Marta Cabrera and Benoit Blanc in the present with occasional flashbacks revealing more details about Harlan Thrombey&#39;s death. In the sequel Glass Onion, Benoit Blanc mysteriously arrives at tech billionaire Miles Bron&#39;s private island to witness a scenario that supposedly leads up to two deaths, before the narrative completely resets. The second half of Glass Onion relives the events from a different perspective, revealing the truth of Benoit Blanc&#39;s mission. It is characteristic of the franchise&#39;s original approach to the whodunit plot; Knives Out 3 will be challenged with doing something equally interesting.

 4  Gone Girl (2014) 
Nick Dunne becomes the main suspect in his wife&#39;s disappearance.
        

 Gone Girl 

 Release Date   October 1, 2014    Director   David Fincher    Cast   Ben Affleck , Rosamund Pike , Neil Patrick Harris , Tyler Perry , Carrie Coon , Kim Dickens    Rating   9.50    Runtime   2h 29m    




Gone Girl is based on Gillian Flynn&#39;s novel of the same name, in which the image of Nick and Amy Dunne&#39;s perfect marriage begins to crumble when Amy goes missing on their fifth anniversary. Flashbacks reveal truths about Nick and Amy&#39;s life that affect the present. Gone Girl&#39;s timeline can be viewed chronologically, but the slow reveal of the past increases the tension and mystery. Gone Girl is known for its twists and turns, which would not have the same effect incorporated into a linear narrative.


 3  Memento (2000) 
A man with short-term memory loss hunts his wife&#39;s killer.
        

 Memento 

 Release Date   May 25, 2001    Director   Christopher Nolan    Cast   Joe Pantoliano , Guy Pearce , Carrie-Anne Moss , Stephen Tobolowsky , Mark Boone Junior    Rating   R    Runtime   113 minutes    




Most of Memento happens in reverse chronological order, with some flashbacks of a single fragmented throughout and an opening scene that takes place in the future (or the present, depending on the perspective). The protagonist Leonard uses a strict system to remind himself of meetings and people, which serves as another way the audience is clued into the mystery. As Memento works backward to the ending, more information about the main character&#39;s mission and the people involved with it is revealed, demonstrating how nothing is as it seems in a non-linear narrative.


 2  Arrival (2016) 
A linguist learns an alien language that transcends time.
        

 Arrival 

 Release Date   November 10, 2016    Director   Denis Villeneuve    Cast   Michael Stuhlbarg , Forest Whitaker , Tzi Ma , Amy Adams , Mark O&#39;Brien , Jeremy Renner , Nathaly Thibault    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   1h 56m    




Arrival opens with a scene that appears to set up a heartbreaking backstory for its protagonist, linguist Louise Banks. Louise is called upon when alien spaceships descend upon Earth to figure out a way to communicate with the aliens. As Louise learns more about their language, it is revealed that this form of communication interacts with time differently. Events that appear to have happened in the past are actually in the future. Arrival&#39;s timeline is an intriguing take on a non-linear narrative. The movie features flashbacks that are revealed to be flashforwards as the main character gains the ability to see into the future.

 1  Pulp Fiction (1994) 
Quentin Tarantino&#39;s iconic non-linear crime drama.


Close







 Pulp Fiction 

 Release Date   October 14, 1994    Director   Quentin Tarantino    Cast   John Travolta , Bruce Willis , Ving Rhames , Samuel L. Jackson , Uma Thurman , Christopher Walken , Tim Roth , Harvey Keitel , Eric Stoltz , Rosanna Arquette    Rating   R    Runtime   154 minutes    




Pulp Fiction is broken into several narratives about various criminals out of chronological order. The opening scene depicts an armed robbery happening at a diner, but its conclusion is not shown until the end. The movie shows events that happened both before and after this robbery. A character is killed and appears in a different timeline later; two characters appear in one scene wearing uncharacteristic clothing, and it is not revealed why until later. Quentin Tarantino&#39;s witty dialogue meets the satisfaction of Pulp Fitcion&#39;s timeline coming together. Non-linear movies are entertaining because they move beyond the basic linear structure, leading to a satisfying conclusion as the narrative sequence is revealed.
