## Literature Review

Superhero movies have plenty of excellent quotes, and these 20 are just a few of the most memorable lines of dialogue from the genre&#39;s history.




While 2023&#39;s MCU release delivered some great quotes, both the Marvel franchise and the DC Universe have consistently delivered many of the most thought-provoking and meaningful quotes in cinema. Superhero movies are filled with unforgettable quotes from both heroes and villains that have joined the pantheon of the most memorable committed to screen. The superhero genre in film has gone through many highs and lows, but even in its lowest moments, there are memorable quotes and moments that audiences remember. Since 1978&#39;s Superman, the genre has become filled with iconic quotes, whether delivered by a hero, villain, or hilarious sidekick.
Movies like The Dark Knight trilogy, James Gunn&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy series, and the Avengers movies all have some remarkably memorable lines of dialog. While cynics still don&#39;t take the genre too seriously, these intriguing lines prove there may be more to superhero films than CGI fights, explosions, and cheesy one-liners. Here are the best 20 superhero movie quotes of all time.
            
 
 10 Best Superhero Movies Of All Time 
From multiple Batmans to Spider-Man, multiverses and time travel, here&#39;s our rundown of the best superhero movies ever.












 








 20  &#34;You Think Darkness Is Your Ally? You Merely Adopted The Dark. I Was Born In It&#34; 
Bane - The Dark Knight Rises (2012)


 







  The Dark Knight Rises  


  Release Date    August 16, 2012     Director    Christopher Nolan     Cast    Christian Bale , Anne Hathaway , Michael Caine , Gary Oldman     Runtime    2h 45m    


Bane is one of the few villains who can face Batman in a one-on-one fight and win with nothing but his bare hands. As Christian Bale&#39;s Bruce Wayne struggled to defeat Bane, he turned off the lights, trying to utilize the dark to his advantage. However, Bane is accustomed to the dark and utters this iconic line before defeating Batman in a brutal duel.





 19  &#34;He Doesn&#39;t Want To Be Famous? Then I&#39;ll Make Him Infamous&#34; 
J. Jonah Jameson - Spider-Man (2002)
        

  Spider-Man (2002)  


  Release Date    May 3, 2002     Director    Sam Raimi     Cast    Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst , James Franco , Cliff Robertson , Rosemary Harris , J.K. Simmons , Joe Manganiello     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    121 Minutes    


J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is a quote machine. Almost every piece of dialogue is hilarious and delivered with perfect comedic timing. However, this early line stands out as it&#39;s clever, and it fully illustrates Jameson&#39;s motives and feelings toward the spider menace.





 18  &#34;Bury Me In The Ocean, With My Ancestors That Jumped From The Ships, Because They Knew Death Was Better Than Bondage.&#34; 
Erik Killmonger - Black Panther (2018)


 







  Black Panther  


  Release Date    February 16, 2018     Director    Ryan Coogler     Cast    Chadwick Boseman , Lupita Nyong&#39;o , Letitia Wright , Angela Bassett , Winston Duke , Michael B. Jordan , Danai Gurira , Forest Whitaker     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    134 Minutes    


Black Panther diverged from the standard MCU formula as it provided commentary on social and political themes, specifically historical and modern issues regarding the black community. This final line from Michael B Jordan&#39;s Killmonger shows tremendous bravery from the villain, but also shows how important his culture and people were to him. He desperately wanted to help his people, even though his methods were morally reprehensible. This quote is also one of the most badass lines delivered by any MCU villain.





 17  &#34;Everyone Keeps Telling Me How My Story&#39;s Supposed to Go. Nah. I&#39;m Gonna Do My Own Thing.&#34; 
Miles Morales - Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)


 







  Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse  


  Release Date    June 2, 2023     Director    Joaquim Dos Santos , Kemp Powers , Justin K. Thompson     Cast    Shameik Moore , Hailee Steinfeld , Oscar Isaac , Jake Johnson , Issa Rae , Brian Tyree Henry , Luna Lauren Velez , Jorma Taccone , Jason Schwartzman     Rating    PG     Runtime    120 Minutes    


Everyone knows the famous quote from Spider-Man about power and responsibility. However, when presented with his canon event, Shameik Moore&#39;s Miles elects to change his destiny by saving his father, despite the risk that it could destroy his universe. While Miles&#39; decision could have unintended consequences, it&#39;s awesome to see a character forging his own path rather than sticking with the status quo.





 16  &#34;Before We Get Started, Does Anyone Want to Get Out?&#34; 
Steve Rogers - Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014)
        

  Captain America: The Winter Soldier  


  Release Date    April 4, 2014     Director    Joe Russo , Anthony Russo     Cast    Chris Evans , Hayley Atwell , Scarlett Johansson , Samuel L. Jackson , Robert Redford , Anthony Mackie , Cobie Smulders , Frank Grillo , Sebastian Stan     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    136 minutes    


One of the most epic fight scenes in the MCU is the elevator fight from The Winter Soldier. The fight is set up perfectly as the various challengers join Cap in the elevator before he becomes suspicious that he&#39;s about to get jumped. Rather than running from a fight, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) delivers this line, showing his pure confidence that he will win.





 15  &#34;Where&#39;s My Super Suit?&#34; 
Frozone - The Incredibles (2004)
        

  The Incredibles  


  Release Date    November 5, 2004     Director    Brad Bird     Cast    Sarah Vowell , Samuel L. Jackson , Craig T. Nelson , Spencer Fox , Holly Hunter , Jason Lee     Rating    PG     Runtime    115 minutes    


Edna Mode&#39;s &#34;No capes!&#34; certainly deserves a spot on this list, but Frozone&#39;s &#34;Where&#39;s my super suit?&#34; argument with his wife has become enshrined in the memories of audiences. It&#39;s not only a hilarious moment in The Incredibles, but it showcases the complications of balancing being a superhero with being a husband. The lines are delivered perfectly by Samuel L. Jackson, along with Kimberly Adair Clark, who voices his wife.





 14  &#34;I Love You Guys&#34; 
Groot - Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)


 







  Guardians of the Galaxy  


  Release Date    July 30, 2014     Director    James Gunn     Cast    Zoe Saldana , Karen Gillan , Vin Diesel , Michael Rooker , Djimon Hounsou , Lee Pace , Benicio Del Toro , Glenn   , Dave Bautista , ​Chris Pratt2 , Bradley Cooper , John C. Reilly     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    122 Mins    


Despite basically working with a very small number of words across his appearances as Groot, Vin Diesel&#39;s delivery of &#34;I Am Groot&#34; varied massively throughout the MCU. After initially changing to &#34;We are Groot&#34; in the first Guardians of the Galaxy, it mainly stayed the same throughout the MCU. The exception was in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3, when Groot said &#34;I love you guys&#34;, finally marking the moment when the audience understood him for the first time in a touching choice by Gunn.





 13  &#34;You Will Give The People Of Earth An Ideal To Strive Towards&#34; 
Jor-El - Man of Steel (2013)
        

  Man of Steel  


  Release Date    June 14, 2013     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Kevin Costner , Laurence Fishburne , Richard Schiff , Amy Adams , Harry Lennix , Antje Traue , Michael Shannon , Henry Cavill , Christopher Meloni , Diane Lane , Russell Crowe     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    143 minutes    


This inspiring monologue delivered by Russell Crowe&#39;s Jor-El not only perfectly summarizes Superman&#39;s role in the world, but superheroes in general. Superheroes are role models who teach people to fight for what&#39;s right, and even when humanity is at its darkest point, Superman must be a beacon of light and hope. It&#39;s too bad Henry Cavill&#39;s time as Superman got cut short, but maybe David Corenswet can become this symbol as the character.





 12  &#34;Just Because Someone Stumbles... Loses Their Way... Doesn’t Mean They&#39;re Lost Forever&#34; 
Charles Xavier - X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014)
        

  X-Men: Days of Future Past  


  Release Date    May 22, 2014     Director    Bryan Singer     Cast    Hugh Jackman , James McAvoy , Michael Fassbender , Jennifer Lawrence , Patrick Stewart     Rating    pg-13     Runtime    132minutes    


Charles Xavier is an optimist for humanity, and this quote shows why he has significant ideological differences with Magneto. Instead of giving up on humanity, he understands that everyone deserves another chance, including Mystique, who is losing herself to hate. It&#39;s the necessary words James McAvoy&#39;s Professor X needed to say, but it&#39;s also excellent wisdom that people should remember.





 11  &#34;You Wanna Get Nuts? C’mon. Let’s Get Nuts&#34; 
Bruce Wayne - Batman (1989)
        

  Batman (1989)  


  Release Date    June 23, 1989     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Jack Nicholson , Kim Basinger , Billy Dee Williams , Robert Wuhl , Pat Hingle , Michael Gough     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    126 Minutes    


This scene from Tim Burton&#39;s Batman also includes the Joker&#39;s &#34;You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?&#34; but it&#39;s Michael Keaton&#39;s crazed delivery that makes this quote stand out more. Keaton was a phenomenal Bruce Wayne, and he had no fear of taking on the bad guys, whether under the cowl or not. The quote was so good that Keaton reused it in The Flash, over 30 years later.





 10  &#34;You Should Have Gone For the Head&#34; 
Thanos - Avengers: Infinity War (2018)
        

  Avengers: Infinity War  


  Release Date    April 27, 2018     Director    Joe Russo , Anthony Russo     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Anthony Mackie , Elizabeth Olsen , Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlett Johansson , Mark Ruffalo , Sebastian Stan , Paul Rudd , Chadwick Boseman , Don Cheadle , Samuel L. Jackson , Josh Brolin , Tom Holland , Evangeline Lilly , Paul Bettany , Chris Evans , Jeremy Renner     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    149 minutes    


The writers behind Thanos&#39; dialogue deserve an award because almost every quote from Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War could be framed and mounted on a wall. However, the most memorable one is this one, which he says after being stabbed by Thor. Thor wanted his moment to look Thanos in the eye, but it cost him his victory as Josh Brolin&#39;s Mad Titan used his last bit of strength to snap his fingers, wiping half of the universe&#39;s population out of existence. It&#39;s a devastating moment and this quote is a reminder that if you&#39;re going to come for the king, you better not miss.





 9  &#34;I’m Not Locked in Here With You, You’re Locked in Here With Me&#34; 
Rorschach - Watchmen (2009)
        

  Watchmen  


  Release Date    March 6, 2009     Director    Zack Snyder     Cast    Patrick Wilson , Malin Akerman , Billy Crudup , Matthew Goode , Carla Gugino , Jackie Earle Haley , Jeffrey Dean Morgan     Rating    R     Runtime    163 Mins    


Jackie Earle Haley&#39;s perversely iconic Rorschach is an excellent fighter and feels no fear when he finds himself in prison with plenty of enemies who want him dead. He issued this warning, telling everyone that they should be scared of him, no matter how many people they have on their side. He followed through on this warning later, and this was a hardcore quote demonstrating how dangerous Rorschach can be.





 8  &#34;Avengers…..Assemble!&#34; 
Steve Rogers - Avengers: Endgame (2019)
        

  Avengers: Endgame  


  Director    Joe Russo , Anthony Russo     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    April 26, 2019     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Anthony Mackie , Paul Rudd , Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlett Johansson , Mark Ruffalo , Evangeline Lilly , Sebastian Stan , Josh Brolin , Elizabeth Olsen , Tom Holland , Don Cheadle , Samuel L. Jackson , Bradley Cooper , Karen Gillan , Brie Larson , Paul Bettany , Chris Evans , Jeremy Renner , Chadwick Boseman     Runtime    3 hours, 2 minutes    


While &#34;On your left&#34; is another worthy quote, &#34;Avengers...Assemble&#34; is a moment MCU viewers have been waiting for ever since Nick Fury told Tony Stark about the Avengers initiative. Nobody could have imagined that this lineup scene could ever happen, and the line delivered by Chris Evans&#39; Captain America after catching Mjölnir was perfection. No matter how audiences feel about the MCU now, this moment made investing in the universe worth it.





 7  &#34;You Wanna Know How I Got These Scars?&#34; 
The Joker - The Dark Knight (2008)
        

  The Dark Knight  


  Director    Christopher Nolan     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    July 18, 2008     Cast    Nestor Carbonell , Morgan Freeman , Ritchie Coster , Cillian Murphy , Chin Han , Gary Oldman , Eric Roberts , William Fichtner , Aaron Eckhart , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Christian Bale , David Dastmalchian , Michael Caine , Anthony Michael Hall , Heath Ledger     Runtime    152 Minutes    


It&#39;s hard to choose the best quote from Heath Ledger&#39;s Joker, but this quote best defines his character. He&#39;s a chaotic man of mystery, and this line only makes him more intimidating as he constantly changes his story, never allowing the audience to know who he really is. It&#39;s a line he repeats several times, showing how much he enjoys bringing other people into his mindset.





 6  &#34;That’s My Secret Captain…I’m Always Angry&#34; 
Bruce Banner - The Avengers (2012)
        

  The Avengers  


  Director    Joss Whedon     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    May 4, 2012     Cast    Chris Hemsworth , Mark Ruffalo , Robert Downey Jr. , Scarlett Johansson , Samuel L. Jackson , Stellan Skarsgård , Clark Gregg , Paul Bettany , Cobie Smulders , Tom Hiddleston , Jeremy Renner , gwyneth paltrow , Chris Evans     Runtime    2h 23m    


The MCU&#39;s Incredible Hulk is a loose cannon who is often dangerous due to the lack of control he has over when he appears. However, this line shows that Mark Ruffalo&#39;s Bruce Banner has more control over the big guy than audiences thought. It&#39;s also a line that defines Banner perfectly and is exclaimed right before Hulk executes an epic punch on a massive Chitauri.





 5  &#34;It’s Not Who I Am Underneath, But What I Do That Defines Me&#34; 
Bruce Wayne - Batman Begins (2005)


 







  Batman Begins  


  Director    Christopher Nolan     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    June 10, 2005     Cast    Ken Watanabe , Liam Neeson , Gary Oldman , Tom Wilkinson , Linus Roache , Christian Bale , Katie Holmes , Mark Boone Junior , Michael Caine , Rutger Hauer , Cillian Murphy , Morgan Freeman     Runtime    2h 20m    


This quote is first delivered to Bruce Wayne by Katie Holmes&#39; Rachel Dawes, before he says it back to her later, revealing that he&#39;s Batman. The point of this phrase is that it doesn&#39;t matter who is under the mask, because people will only know Batman by what he does rather than by his secret identity. He is a mysterious vigilante but one who is defined by his heroic deeds.





 4  &#34;With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility&#34; 
Uncle Ben - Spider-Man (2002)
        

This iconic line was ripped right from the Spider-Man comics and became the defining motto for Spider-Man, no matter which version. It was first shared by Cliff Robertson&#39;s Uncle Ben to Tobey Maguire&#39;s Peter Parker in Spider-Man, but it&#39;s been repeated and slightly altered in The Amazing Spider-Man and Spider-Man: No Way Home. All three Spider-Men carried this wisdom with them and rallied behind it together when they united in No Way Home.





 3  &#34;I Am Iron Man&#34; 
Tony Stark - Iron Man (2008)


 







  Iron Man  


  Director    Jon Favreau     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    May 2, 2008     Cast    Robert Downey Jr. , Jeff Bridges , gwyneth paltrow , Terrence Howard , Leslie Bibb , Shaun Toub , Clark Gregg , Paul Bettany     Runtime    126 minutes    


Robert Downey Jr&#39;s Tony Stark shocked the world when he declared he was Iron Man and unknowingly entered a world of superheroes he didn&#39;t know existed. This line was even more epic when he repeated it before snapping Thanos and his army out of existence in Avengers: Endgame, sacrificing his life at the same time. This quote presented a full circle moment for Tony, giving audiences a perfect character arc that makes him one of, if not, the best hero in the MCU.





 2  &#34;I Can Do This All Day&#34; 
Steve Rogers - Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)
        

  Captain America: The First Avenger  


  Director    Joe Johnston     Rating    PG-13     Release Date    July 22, 2011     Cast    Chris Evans , Hayley Atwell , Hugo Weaving , Sebastian Stan , Tommy Lee Jones , Samuel L. Jackson , Dominic Cooper , Stanley Tucci , Toby Jones     Runtime    124 Minutes    


One of Captain America&#39;s best attributes is his stubbornness and inability to give up, even when the odds are stacked against him. This line first comes as he&#39;s getting beat up by a random bully in an alley, but he still gets up every time. Chris Evans&#39; Rogers uses this quote multiple times throughout the MCU in films such as Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame, and it&#39;s badass every time.





 1  &#34;You Either Die A Hero Or Live Long Enough to See Yourself Become the Villain&#34; 
Harvey Dent - The Dark Knight (2008)
        

This line by Aaron Eckhart&#39;s Harvey Dent is one of the most eerie forms of foreshadowing there is. Harvey was a hero in Gotham but was manipulated by the Joker into becoming Two-Face and took the law into his own violent hands. Instead of allowing Harvey to be turned into a villain, Batman takes the fall for his crimes and becomes the villain that Gotham needs, therefore being the hero that the DC city deserves.
