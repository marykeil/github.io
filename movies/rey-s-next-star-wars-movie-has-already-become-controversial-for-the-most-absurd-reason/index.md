# Rey s Next Star Wars Movie Has Already Become Controversial, For The Most Absurd Reason


## SUMMARY 



  Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, the director of Star Wars: New Jedi Order, has raised criticisms that she is disregarding past female workers in the Star Wars franchise.   Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s comments instead refer to her as the first woman of color to direct a Star Wars feature film, meaning the criticisms against her are entirely ridiculous as they are taken out of context.   Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s qualifications and past experience - including directing the best, most emotional episode of Marvel Studios&#39; Ms. Marvel - make her an excellent choice to helm Star Wars: New Jedi Order.

## Literature Review

Rey’s New Jedi Order movie is already receiving criticism from specific facets of the Star Wars fandom for the most overwhelmingly absurd of reasons.




Rey&#39;s upcoming Star Wars movie, presumably titled Star Wars: New Jedi Order, is already facing backlash for a ridiculous reason. Upon the announcement of the upcoming Star Wars movie at Star Wars Celebration 2023, criticisms were being aimed at the project based on the sequel trilogy. The sequel films are often regarded as the worst-ranked Star Wars trilogy, with sections of the franchise&#39;s fan base pinning a lot of their issues on the trilogy&#39;s storytelling, writing, and characters including Rey Skywalker.




As such, the Star Wars fans less than enthused about the sequels only raised more concerns when it was announced that Rey Skywalker would return in an upcoming Star Wars project. Also attached to the next Star Wars movie is Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy as director who recently voiced her excitement about her upcoming film in the franchise stating:


“I’m very thrilled about the project because I feel what we’re about to create is something very special. And we’re in 2024 now, and it’s about time that we had a woman come forward to shape a story in a galaxy far, far away.”


The latter section of these comments only furthered the criticisms being pinned against Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order movie with many stating that the comments disregard the women who have previously worked on the Star Wars franchise. This argument is taking Obaid-Chinoy wildly out of context as the filmmaker is clearly referring to her status as the first woman of color director of a theatrical Star Wars film. The argument is often raised that it should not matter which gender a filmmaker identifies as or what their ethnicity is as long as a good movie is crafted. However, this argument has been lacking concerning Star Wars movies of the past.





 Star Wars Fandom Has Nothing To Fear From Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy 
          

Despite these criticisms, it is clear that the Star Wars fandom has nothing to fear from Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. The director is a fantastic filmmaker with a wealth of prior experience in the industry that promises a compelling, well-made Star Wars film. Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s profile on the World Economic Forum outlines her fantastic prior work as do her other credits in Hollywood.

Obaid-Chinoy is known for directing two episodes of Marvel Studios&#39; Ms. Marvel. One of the better episodes of that show was episode 5, a heartwarming exploration of family amid the Partition of India, which Obaid-Chinoy helmed. All of this points towards Star Wars: New Jedi Order being in extremely solid hands, with the criticisms being raised against the film&#39;s director arguing for something that is entirely not necessary.
