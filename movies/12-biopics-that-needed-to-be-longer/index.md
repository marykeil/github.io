## Literature Review

Some historical figures and celebrities need more than a single movie to tell their story faithfully, and their biopics don’t dig deep enough.




Biopics often attempt to condense the entire story of a historical figure&#39;s life into one neatly packaged movie, but they could often benefit from having some more time to play with. Biopics have always been popular, but they seem to be gaining even more prominence. Music biopics are the latest Hollywood trend, with Elvis, Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman, and more all being released in the last few years. Biopics aren&#39;t just commercially viable, they also seem to be perfectly tailored for awards-season success, so they probably won&#39;t slow down any time soon.
Some celebrities and historical figures are so interesting that a single movie isn&#39;t enough to adequately tell their story. Some biopics prefer to focus on a specific period of someone&#39;s life rather than attempting to describe the entire span of it, but this approach also comes with problems. In other cases, historical figures are better suited to biographical TV series that allow enough time to examine their lives in detail. The Crown is one famous example of this approach. If a biopic can keep things interesting, it&#39;s always worth considering adding some extra detail in a movie or making a TV series instead.









 








 12  Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) 
Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury


 







Like many biopics from the past few years, Bohemian Rhapsody garnered an Oscar win for its star. Rami Malek plays legendary Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, as the movie tracks the band&#39;s rise to the very top. The movie is an interesting artifact for any fan of Queen&#39;s music, but it only dips a toe into the darker facets of Mercury&#39;s life. The cast of Bohemian Rhapsody also struggle at times to maintain a compelling narrative throughout so many time jumps. A longer runtime could have helped Bohemian Rhapsody delve into Mercury&#39;s less glamorous side.





 11  The Imitation Game (2014) 
Benedit Cumberbatch as Alan Turing
        

Like Bohemian Rhapsody, the British war thriller The Imitation Game only shows a fraction of the uncomfortable truth facing its subject. Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician and computer scientist whose work was pivotal to cracking the German enigma code. He was also persecuted by the British government for his homosexuality. His story is proof that even national heroes were not above barbaric legislation, and the true story behind The Imitation Game is more complex and interesting than the movie&#39;s short runtime has scope to deal with.





 10  The Greatest Showman (2017) 
Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum


 







The songs in The Greatest Showman often push plot considerations to one side. 

The Greatest Showman is a musical movie meant to evoke the same feelings of ritzy spectacle as P.T. Barnum&#39;s famous circus. It&#39;s not a traditional biopic in this sense, and some stories are completely fabricated to fit into the overall tone of the movie. However, the movie still feels a little short, purely from a storytelling point of view. Barnum&#39;s reconciliation with his wife in the third act is extremely rushed, and if it weren&#39;t masked by a song, it would make very little sense. This is just one example, but the songs in The Greatest Showman often push plot considerations to one side.





 9  Frost/Nixon (2008) 
Michael Sheen as David Frost &amp; Frank Langella as Richard Nixon
        

Rather than focusing on the broad scope of someone&#39;s whole life, Frost/Nixon zeroes in on a brief moment when two men&#39;s lives intersect. Journalist David Frost&#39;s famous interviews with Richard Nixon took place five years after the Watergate scandal which saw Nixon leave office. Frost/Nixon uses this as the historical backdrop for an intimate character study. Two excellent central performances and a compelling script by Peter Morgan are the keys to the movie&#39;s success. Frost/Nixon tells such a fascinating story so well that it feels short, and audiences are left wondering what happens next for both men.





 8  Legend (2015) 
Tom Hardy as Reggie and Ronnie Kray
        

Legend serves up hard-hitting action coupled with cheeky East London humor, but it falls short as a biopic of its two subjects. The Kray twins were London&#39;s most feared gangsters in the 1960s, and Tom Hardy does a fine job at distinguishing the idiosyncracies of the two men. But Legend only scratches the surface of their inner lives. One of the most fascinating aspects of the Kray twins&#39; reign was their celebrity status, despite their illegal activities. Legend shows some mid-century glitz and glamor, but it doesn&#39;t have enough time to explore the ways this changed the twins.





 7  Elvis (2022) 
Austin Butler as Elvis Presley


 







Baz Luhrmann&#39;s biopic of Elvis Presley clocks in at over two and a half hours, but there&#39;s still plenty more to explore. Elvis&#39; monolithic status changed the landscape of modern American media consumption and celebrity worshiping culture. Luhrmann wants to make an Elvis miniseries to expand upon the movie, and reveal a slightly different story. He recently turned his period romance Australia into a streaming series, renamed Faraway Downs, using previously unseen footage. He could do the same for Elvis. 





 6  Malcolm X (1992) 
Denzel Washington as Malcolm X
        

Malcolm X is one of Spike Lee&#39;s most highly-praised movies, drawing from The Autobiography of Malcolm X to paint a detailed portrait of the revolutionary civil rights activist. At over three hours, the movie provides a fascinating glimpse into the life of a politically divisive figure, and the chaotic world that he lived in. The autobiography was published after Malcolm X&#39;s assassination, based on over 50 interviews he gave to the journalist Alex Haley. At over 500 pages, there is more than enough material to make an even more extensive biopic of Malcolm X as a TV series.





 5  Chaplin (1992) 
Robert Downey Jr. as Charlie Chaplin
        

Robert Downey Jr. garnered widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal of one of the most popular movie stars of the silent era, but Chaplin was forced to choose what it included carefully to squeeze into its runtime. Chaplin primarily adapted Charlie Chaplin&#39;s autobiography, which is over 500 pages long, and David Robinson&#39;s Chaplin: His Life and Art, which has an astounding 1000 pages. Chaplin&#39;s rise from the slums of Victorian-era London to the excess of Hollywood could easily stretch into a miniseries, and his 75-year career has many chapters which the movie had to exclude.





 4  J. Edgar (2011) 
Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover
        

J. Edgar Hoover was crucial in establishing the FBI, and he served as the director of the Bureau for 37 years. During that time, he amassed an incredible amount of political power via unscrupulous means. Although he helped to modernize law enforcement in many ways, he is most often remembered for the allegations of corruption and the swirl of rumors about his personal life. Clint Eastwood&#39;s biopic benefits from a powerhouse performance from Leonardo DiCaprio, but the nonlinear narrative can be difficult to follow. The movie doesn&#39;t have the scope required to show how Hoover changed American politics.





 3  Jobs (2013) 
Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs
        

Long before a biopic was even in the works, Ashton Kutcher&#39;s physical similarity to Steve Jobs had already been widely noted. Unfortunately, Jobs provided only a surface-level examination of the computer scientist. The abrupt shift in Jobs&#39; personality between his first and second stints as Apple goes largely unexplained, since his NeXT years occupy such a short section of the movie&#39;s runtime. Jobs doesn&#39;t have enough time to truly explore the mindset of Jobs and his Silicon Valley peers.





 2  Judy (2019) 
Renée Zellweger as Judy Garland
        

Slightly more time would allow for it to flesh out some of the details that are only on the periphery, like her relationship with her children. 

Judy Garland was thrust into the spotlight from a very young age when she starred in The Wizard of Oz, but Judy chooses instead to focus on her later years as she clings to her fame by performing in London. It&#39;s less about her career as a child actor and more about how that experience affected her psychologically throughout the rest of her life. Judy doesn&#39;t attempt to tell her whole story, nor does it need to, but slightly more time would allow for it to flesh out some of the details that are only on the periphery, like her relationship with her children.





 1  The Aviator (2004) 
Leonardo DiCaprio as Howard Hughes
        

The Aviator isn&#39;t just a showcase for Leonardo DiCaprio, as it also features one of Cate Blanchett&#39;s best roles as the Hollywood icon Katherine Hepburn. Howard Hughes was an American business mogul who diversified from film production and aerospace engineering into myriad other profitable businesses. The Aviator spans several decades of Hughes&#39; life, and its rich period detail is remarkable. The movie was a critical and commercial success, but any further reading into Hughes reveals all the details of his life which Martin Scorsese had to omit.
