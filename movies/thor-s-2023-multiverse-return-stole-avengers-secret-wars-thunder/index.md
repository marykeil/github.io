## Literature Review

Thor Odinson had a very strong multiversal presence in 2023 thanks to What If...?, though one battle in particular stole some of Secret Wars&#39; thunder.





Summary

  Marvel&#39;s What If...? Season 2 teases the possibility of multiple Thor variants in Avengers: Secret Wars.   The concept of the Thor Corps from the Secret Wars comics could be adapted for the MCU&#39;s Secret Wars.   The finale of What If...? Season 2 showcases an impressive handful of Thor variants, offering a glimpse at the potential for an army of hammer-wielding Thors in the MCU&#39;s future.  







Thor&#39;s multiversal return in 2023 has stolen some thunder from Avengers: Secret Wars (in a good way). As seen in Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 2, multiple variants of the God of Thunder were featured across several episodes. However, the season finale featured the best tease regarding what might be in store for Thor&#39;s future in the MCU with the culminating film in the ongoing Multiverse Saga.

As seen in What If...? season 2, more traditional versions of Thor were featured, such as the God of Thunder who aided a new assembly of Avengers in 1988 to take on a Celestial-powered Peter Quill in a reality where he was delivered to Ego as promised. Likewise, another reality saw Thor becoming a king in 1602 in a reality where this past timeline was intermingling with the heroes from the 21st century. However, the finale saw the release of multiple Thor variants that had been captured by Strange Supreme, bringing to mind an original comics concept that could be brought to the MCU&#39;s Secret Wars in 2027.




                  Every Upcoming Marvel Movie: Full MCU Phase 5 &amp; 6 List (&amp; Beyond)   Between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment, here is every upcoming Marvel movie release date and what we know about the projects so far.   


 Secret Wars Could Introduce Multiple Thor Variants 
Multiple Odinsons Just Like Loki, Strange, and Spider-Man
          

As seen in the MCU&#39;s Loki show, Thor&#39;s brother has interacted with multiple versions of himself from different timelines and realities. The same is true for Doctor Strange as seen in Multiverse of Madness, and Spider-Man: No Way Home when Tom Holland&#39;s Peter Parker teamed up with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield&#39;s past Spider-Men, each of them living and saving the day in their own reality within the greater multiverse. To that end, the same could be done for Chris Hemsworth&#39;s Thor in the MCU&#39;s future.




As far as Avengers: Secret Wars is concerned, there&#39;s certainly a precedent for a massive assembly of Odinsons as seen in the Secret Wars crossover event published by Marvel Comics in 2015. Known as the Thor Corps, multiple variants of the God of Thunder were brought together in the patchwork of realities known as Battleworld ruled by God Emperor Doom. Serving at the pleasure of Doom himself, the Thor Corps was tasked with policing and protecting Battleworld, an idea that could be very exciting to see adapted for the MCU&#39;s Secret Wars.



 What If...? Season 2 Showed How Cool The MCU Thor Corps Could Be 
An Army Of Asgardian Gods Would Be Quite Impressive
          

As seen in What If...? season 2&#39;s finale, a handful of Thors are seen fighting in the middle of the massive battle that took place within Strange Supreme&#39;s Sanctum Infinitum. This included an impressive Hulked-out Thor, one of What If...? season 2&#39;s most exciting new variants despite his limited screentime.




Although these Thor variants were largely seen fighting each other, they did come together by the episode&#39;s end to offer their hammers and weapons to Captain Carter which helped her defeat Strange before he could feed all the variants to his multiversal forge, hoping to bring back his lost world. As such, it&#39;s a small yet exciting moment that proves just how cool it would be to potentially see an army of hammer-wielding Thors when Avengers: Secret Wars releases in 2027.

All episodes of Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 2 are now streaming on Disney&#43;.
