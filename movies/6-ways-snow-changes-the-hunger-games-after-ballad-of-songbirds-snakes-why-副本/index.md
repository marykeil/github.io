# 6 Ways Snow Changes The Hunger Games After Ballad Of Songbirds &amp; Snakes (&amp; Why)


## SUMMARY 



Snow implemented changes to the Hunger Games, including turning tributes into celebrities, to make the Games more appealing to Capitol audiences.

Snow made the Games more complex by introducing elaborate arenas, giving Gamemakers more control over manipulating the events and keeping the Capitol citizens engaged.

Snow established the Hunger Games escorts and changed the reaping process to ensure that it couldn&#39;t be rigged, maintaining the sanctity of the Games and preventing rebellion.
