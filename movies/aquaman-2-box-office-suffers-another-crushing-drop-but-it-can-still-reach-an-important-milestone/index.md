## Literature Review

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s box office totals suffer another crushing drop, but it still has the potential to reach an important DCU milestone.




While it may not be trending well at the box office, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom still has the potential to be DC&#39;s best of the year. Set to be the last movie from the original DC Universe, Aquaman&#39;s second live-action solo movie stars Jason Momoa, Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. It comes after several DC box office disasters, including Shazam! Fury of the Gods, Blue Beetle, and The Flash.




Despite DC&#39;s hopes that an aquatic hero could turn the tide, Variety reports that Aquaman 2 has only secured fourth place at the box office this week, behind Wonka, Night Swim, and Migration. It fell 56 percent from last week, a massive drop for a movie that was already trending downwards. Despite its severe fall, Aquaman 2 is still on track to soon gross $100 million and is about to pass the entire domestic gain from The Flash. That would make it DC&#39;s highest-grossing domestic movie of all of 2023.


 Will Aquaman 2 Become The Highest-Grossing 2023 DC Movie? 
          

2023 was a painful year for the DCU. It began with Shazam! Fury of the Gods, which earned under $135 million worldwide with a budget of $125 million, before DC released the blockbuster that was intended to dominate the market: The Flash. Made controversial by Ezra Miller&#39;s various criminal allegations, the movie grossed under $275 million, despite having a budget of $220 million. The next disaster was Blue Beetle, which had a budget of approximately $100 million and grossed just under $130 million.




                  Predicting The Box Office Performance Of Every 2024 Marvel &amp; DC Movie   With fewer movies than in past years, Marvel and DC&#39;s 2024 films will have to face superhero fatigue to come out on top at the box office.   

Sitting at just under $100 million at the domestic box office and having already passed $250 million worldwide in its second week, it remains to be seen if Aquaman 2 will break even. It needs $400 million just to achieve profitability against its $215 million budget. Regardless, it&#39;s likely that Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom will easily outpace The Flash. The final movie from the original DCU will be its best of 2023.



Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&#39;s streaming release date has not yet been scheduled. The Flash is already available on Max and Prime Video.




Unfortunately, the box office results still pale in comparison to the $1.1 billion that the original Aquaman earned during its run. The DCU has had a disappointing year, and it is not scheduled to release any movies in 2024. 2025 could be a much-needed change of fortune, as Superman: Legacy has the opportunity to revitalize the universe under the direction of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Time will tell, but Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom brings a quiet but hopeful end for the dying DCU.
