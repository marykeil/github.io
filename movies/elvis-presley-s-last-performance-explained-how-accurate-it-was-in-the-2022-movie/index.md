# Elvis Presley s Last Performance Explained &amp; How Accurate It Was In The 2022 Movie


## SUMMARY 



  The movie &#34;Elvis&#34; directed by Baz Luhrmann provides a fairly accurate portrayal of Elvis Presley&#39;s life and fame, but takes some creative liberties for a better narrative.   The film focuses on Elvis&#39; career from a young musician to his rise to international fame, with flashbacks from Colonel Tom Parker&#39;s perspective.   The movie includes footage from Elvis&#39; last performance, using real footage and prosthetics for actor Austin Butler, showcasing the musician&#39;s passion, talent, and dedication to his craft.

## Literature Review

Austin Butler had a haunting portrayal of the King of rock and roll in 2022&#39;s Elvis, and the film featured a scene of Elvis Presley&#39;s last concert.




The 2022 movie Elvis also included a glimpse of Elvis Presley&#39;s last performance, and many fans might wonder how accurate the portrayal is. Directed by Baz Luhrmann, the film stars Austin Butler in the titular role, and he earned plenty of award recognition for it, including a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role at the Oscars among the seven other Academy Awards nominations the film received. The film followed the &#34;King of Rock and Roll&#34; through a series of flashbacks from Colonel Tom Parker&#39;s perspective (played by Tom Hanks), focusing on Elvis&#39; career from a young up-and-coming musician to his rise to international fame.




Luhrmann&#39;s take on Elvis Presley&#39;s life and his fame was fairly accurate, but it did take some creative freedom in favor of a better narrative. Although the director did a lot of research in Memphis Tupelo, Mississippi, Presley&#39;s birthplace, some scenes were changed or enhanced for dramatic purposes. For example, Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker&#39;s relationship is oversimplified, as the latter underwent several changes in the film. However, although the movie isn&#39;t accurate in its entirety, the director managed to successfully tell the story of his career and his presence on stage, and it included footage from Elvis&#39; last performance.

                        Elvis True Story: How Accurate It Is &amp; What The Movie Changes   Baz Luhrmann&#39;s biopic Elvis plays fast and loose with the truth. However, there are some ways that the movie remains historically accurate.   


 Elvis Presley&#39;s Final Public Performance Was In June 1977 
His last performances also led to a concert special
          




Elvis Presley&#39;s career lasted for over two decades, and his last performance was on June 26, 1977. The legendary singer performed at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana, in what would become his last performance. The same month, CBS taped two of his concerts for a television special called Elvis in Concert, billed as his final concert but taped earlier, on June 19 in Omaha and June 21st in Rapid City. No one knew June 26, 1977, would mark his final concert, as the King of Rock and Roll passed away of heart failure six weeks later at his Graceland mansion in Memphis at the age of 42.

Despite his fast-approaching death, Elvis Presley put on a huge show that was described to have &#34;unparalleled energy and enthusiasm&#34; (via Hank FM), and performed in front of almost 18,000 people. Elvis Presley struggled with drug abuse throughout his career, which led to fatigue and several health issues in his final years. This part was overlooked in the film, even though the Elvis movie ending addressed part of his pill addiction. However, when he took the stage for the last time, Elvis Presley proved his passion for music, with a strong charisma and stage presence, as well as powerful vocals, pouring his heart and soul into every song.






 What Songs Did Elvis Perform During His Last Concert? 
         

On June 26, 1977, Elvis Presley performed his 55th show of the year, which included a set list filled with his biggest hits. The tracklist was carefully chosen to showcase his range and talents, a journey through Elvis&#39; discography, which includes 23 studio albums, 8 live albums, 13 compilation albums, and 29 EPs (via Elvis Presley&#39;s website). He performed rock and roll hits like “Jailhouse Rock” and “Hound Dog” to heartfelt ballads like “Love Me Tender” and “Can’t Help Falling in Love.”

Among other songs that Elvis performed during his last concert were &#34;C.C. Rider,&#34; &#34;I Got A Woman/Amen,&#34; &#34;Love Me,&#34; &#34;Fairytale,&#34; &#34;You Gave Me A Mountain,&#34; &#34;It&#39;s Now Or Never,&#34; &#34;Little Sister,&#34; &#34;Teddy Bear,&#34; &#34;Don&#39;t Be Cruel,&#34; &#34;Release Me,&#34; &#34;I Can&#39;t Stop Loving You,&#34; &#34;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&#34; &#34;Early Mornin&#39; Rain,&#34; &#34;Johnny B. Goode,&#34; &#34;I Really Don&#39;t Want To Know,&#34; and &#34;Hurt&#34; (via Nights with Alice Cooper).




                  Every Song In Elvis (&amp; Who Sings What)   Elvis boasts an impressive soundtrack whose maximalist approach perfectly complements the film. Here is every song and where they appear.   



 How Accurate The Elvis Movie&#39;s &#34;Unchained Melody&#34; Scene Is 
The scene blends into a real video of Elvis Presley
          

The Elvis biopic covers 42 years, from the legendary Rock and Roll singer&#39;s birth to his death in 1977, and it also features &#34;Unchained Melody&#34; from his last concerts, and it&#39;s highly accurate. The 2022 film&#39;s last scenes are a recreation of an actual performance of one of Elvis Presley&#39;s last performances. Although it was not based on the King of Rock and Roll&#39;s last concert from June 26, 1977, Austin Butler and Baz Luhrmann drew inspiration from his performance at Rapid City, South Dakota on June 21, 1977, and the attention to detail in this final scene was astounding, especially as it blended into a real video with Presley.





 

The production created prosthetics for Austin Butler to wear and used real footage of Elvis Presley&#39;s performance that Butler assimilated down to every gesture (via LA Times). The scene is probably one of the most accurate from the film because, during Butler&#39;s portrayal of Elvis, it cuts to real footage of Elvis Presley performing &#34;Unchained Melody,&#34; using his real vocals. The film might&#39;ve depicted some dark parts of Elvis Presley&#39;s life and taken some liberties with others, but the &#34;Unchained Melody&#34; performance&#39;s accuracy stands as proof of the musician&#39;s passion, talent, and dedication to his craft, as well as of why Elvis became critically acclaimed.
