  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Michael Bay&rsquo;s directorial style brought the U.S. military as a major focus in the Transformers franchise, which was not present in the original animated series.   Bay&rsquo;s version of Transformers heavily emphasized human characters, deviating from the source material where the Autobots were the main focus.   The G1 designs of the Transformers were not used in Bay&rsquo;s films, but a different director could have incorporated them from the start, satisfying both mainstream and nostalgic audiences.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Michael Bay&rsquo;s Transformers movies were very successful and also harshly criticized, but the franchise would&rsquo;ve been completely different without him.</p>
<p>Michael Bay directed the first five Transformers movies, and the franchise has become synonymous with his name, but it would&rsquo;ve been completely different with another creative mind at the helm. The live-action Transformers franchise continues to be incredibly successful at the box office, with a total gross of $4.3 billion (via The Numbers), yet most of the films failed to strike a chord with the critics. Bay&rsquo;s direction involves excessive action and explosions, poor character development, female objectification, and a lack of distinctiveness for the Transformers. The first movie has a critic score of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes, and each subsequent sequel has had a lower rating than the last.</p>
<p>Bay&rsquo;s version of Transformers didn&rsquo;t sit well with some of the animated series&rsquo; fans. The live-action Transformers franchise timeline is extensive, but the lore is rich, with many interesting characters and story arcs Bay didn&rsquo;t approach. His films were heavily criticized for having complex robot designs, making it very difficult to distinguish the characters during action sequences. Bay was hesitant to do the project, but he did change the Transformers franchise a lot to fit his style. Even though the saga&rsquo;s massive success on the big screen was due in large part to Bay&rsquo;s directorial style, it is interesting to imagine what the Transformer movies would&rsquo;ve been like without him.</p>
<p>Transformers&rsquo; Military Focus Wouldn&rsquo;t Exist Without Michael Bay
The U.S. Military is a defining feature of Michael Bay&rsquo;s Transformers films.</p>
<p>The Transformers film franchise is based on the animated series that aired in the &rsquo;80s, but Michael Bay&rsquo;s movies take a different approach in one particular way. The animated series is more lighthearted and takes a more fantastical and science fiction approach, while Bay&rsquo;s version has a big focus on the U.S. military, which is one of the defining features of his films. There are many real military weapons, vehicles, and personnel since the director worked closely with the U.S. military for a better sense of realism.</p>
<p>A different direction of Transformers wouldn&rsquo;t have made the military such an important part of the story. Bay created many military characters with important roles, who proved to be as capable as the Autobots, which didn&rsquo;t happen in the animated series. The source material did include military characters, but they weren&rsquo;t vital for the narrative, as it focused on the Autobots and Decepticons. Bay&rsquo;s direction was often criticized for glorifying the American military, and Bumblebee, with Travis Knight at the helm, took a different approach, focusing on a more fantastical story while also keeping some of the realism that Bay tried to bring in the first four films.</p>
<p>Transformers&rsquo; Focus Would&rsquo;ve Been On The Transformers, Not Humans
One major complaint about Michael Bay&rsquo;s Transformers movies was their focus on human characters.</p>
<p>One of the biggest differences between the source material and Michael Bay&rsquo;s version of Transformers was the focus on human characters. Transformers includes many great human characters, and they have been present since the beginning of the series. However, almost all the animated series, comics, and video games have Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, as the main character. Although Optimus Prime was important in the films, the main storyline in Bay&rsquo;s Transformers franchise revolved around the human characters.</p>
<p>The Transformers franchise could&rsquo;ve given the Autobots and the Decepticons the screen time they deserved. Given how extended the universe is, and how much history there is to the characters, a different director could&rsquo;ve delved deeper into their origins and relationships, and gave them better personalities and distinct traits, just like the source material had, instead of focusing on humans. Characters like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee got more screen time, but there are more interesting characters that could be explored, like Mirage, the most famous female Autobot Arcee, Oreo Bot, and more.</p>
<p>The Transformers&rsquo; G1 Designs Could Have Been Used From The Start
Bay&rsquo;s CGI robots were heavily criticized.</p>
<p>Michael Bay&rsquo;s Transformers movies were huge blockbusters, but they were also criticized for the complexity of the robot designs. The director heavily used CGI to make the robots look imposing, yet they became too complicated, difficult to recognize, and strayed a lot from how the characters originally looked. Bumblebee and Transformers: Rise of the Beasts both adopted the classic Generation One (G1) designs introduced in the &rsquo;80s and that only happened after Michael Bay departed from the franchise.</p>
<p>A different director could&rsquo;ve used the G1 designs in the first five Transformers films. That way, the beloved Autobots could&rsquo;ve stayed true to their original cartoon appearance, instead of the complicated robot form they had in Michael Bay&rsquo;s films. Although Bay&rsquo;s visual style was impressive and appealed to the masses, opting for the G1 designs from the beginning of the Transformers franchise could&rsquo;ve satisfied both the mainstream and brought much-needed nostalgia.</p>
<p>Transformers Could&rsquo;ve Been More Character-Driven
Michael Bay&rsquo;s main characters weren&rsquo;t very well-written.</p>
<p>From Sam Witwicky in the first three films to Cade Yeager later on, Bay&rsquo;s Transformers films had a lot of human characters. However, Bay&rsquo;s characters weren&rsquo;t very interesting, and the narrative was never character-driven. They got more and more one-sided and unlikable as the franchise progressed, and there were many comedic relief characters and goofy figures intended for laughs, without giving them depth. Another detail about Bay&rsquo;s films was the obvious female objectification where women were reduced to their exteriors for the enjoyment of the male gaze, and a different direction would&rsquo;ve fixed that.</p>
<p>Bumblebee, the franchise&rsquo;s prequel, and the subsequent Transformers reboot, Transformers: Rise of the Beast, which had Steven Caple Jr. at the helm, did a better job with their human characters. Although neither excelled at creating remarkable characters, they did a better job of introducing the human characters into the robot action, keeping the comedic relief characters to a minimum, and bringing more heart to the franchise. The first Transformers had heart, focusing on Sam and his connection with his car, but that changed in the sequels. A Transformers franchise that didn&rsquo;t have Michael Bay at the helm could&rsquo;ve had a more character-driven narrative, with more likable humans.</p>
<pre><code>              What If Steven Spielberg Directed Transformers Instead Of Michael Bay   Steven Spielberg only executive-produced Transformers while Michael Bay directed. But what if Spielberg was in the director's chair instead of Bay?   
</code></pre>
<p>Transformers Would&rsquo;ve Been More Accurate To The Source Material
Michael Bay&rsquo;s Transformers used a different tone</p>
<p>Michael Bay struggled to find a fitting tone for the Transformers movies, and he often leaned on humor. Some of the reviewers criticized the excessive, juvenile, and inappropriate humor in Bay&rsquo;s films. His focus was mostly on making realistic yet over-the-top action scenes, with many explosions, and a sense of global crisis. Although he succeeded in doing all of that, the sense of urgency was very different from the original Transformers series, and he used a much bigger scale, as opposed to the animated show, where the battles happened on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>The Transformers franchise without Bay could have been more faithful to the source material. It could&rsquo;ve used a better focus on character development, a coherent plot, and less humor. At the same time, a different director could&rsquo;ve delved deeper into the mythology of the Transformers than Bay ever did. That way, it could&rsquo;ve aligned more with the lighthearted and optimistic tone of the source material, which had a balance of action, drama, and humor. If the Transformers franchise hadn&rsquo;t had Bay at the helm, it might not have become so popular with the mainstream masses, but it could&rsquo;ve been more faithful to the original animated series.</p>
