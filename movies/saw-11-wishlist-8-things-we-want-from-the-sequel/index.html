The return of escape room style traps could bring nostalgia and add a modern twist to the franchise.
Saw 11 should focus more on John Kramer and his complex character, providing further development and backstory.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>With the Saw franchise releasing Saw 11 in line with its 20-year anniversary, there is plenty that can be hoped for in the next installment.</p>
<p>Saw 11 is hitting theaters in the fall, and there are a number of things audiences and franchise fans hope to see in the sequel. The first Saw movie was released back in 2004, meaning that Saw 11 will be on screens during the franchise&rsquo;s 20-year anniversary. The introduction of the chaos of John &ldquo;Jigsaw&rdquo; Kramer&rsquo;s (Tobin Bell) mind completely redefined the horror genre as a whole, and there&rsquo;s no doubt that Saw 11 will continue to do so.
With so many films in the franchise, there is the concern that Saw 11 may not be to the same standard as some of its predecessors. While there are only so many plot points and character types that can be used in such a film, horror films are known for giving unexpected twists, and Saw is no different. With an eleventh film on the horizon, there are a few things expected from Saw 11.</p>
<p>8  Longer Runtimes
The Saw Films Could Do With More Screen Time</p>
<p>The most recent installment, Saw X, which was released in 2023, had a runtime of 118 minutes. However, this wasn&rsquo;t the case for all of the Saw films. It&rsquo;s been a common criticism in the franchise that some of the films simply haven&rsquo;t been long enough, most notably Saw 3D, which came in at exactly 90 minutes.
Saw III, released in 2006, had a runtime of 108 minutes, but the franchise failed to release another installment that exceeded that until the record-breaking Saw X.If Saw 11 has a longer runtime, or at least one that rivals its predecessor, it would allow for a lot more content to be included. Not only that, but Saw 11 could see better pacing, more character development, and, overall, be more horrifying.</p>
<p>7  The Return Of Escape Room Style Traps
The Earlier Installments Had More Complex Traps</p>
<p>Throughout the franchise, various Jigsaw traps have caused the deaths of many people. For the element of surprise, or perhaps even nostalgia, the return of a previously seen trap could shake up Saw 11. While there are several that could be brought back, some would make more sense than others. Saw and Saw II both had traps that resembled that of an escape room, which allowed victims to explore their environment.
For example, Saw II was mainly set within one house, and Saw had one notable scene that featured its iconic bathroom trap. In recent years, escape rooms have become increasingly popular in general society. The franchise hasn&rsquo;t always followed a chronological order, with Saw X being set between Saw and Saw II in the Saw timeline, but the return of an escape room trap that reflects the modern world could be a possibility.</p>
<p>6  Saw 11 Needs More John Kramer
The Franchise&rsquo;s Main Villain Should Be Featured More</p>
<p>Despite John Kramer being the core of the Saw films, a majority of the franchise&rsquo;s installments have instead revolved around another character. For example, Saw II primarily focused on Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), and who he was as a person, even if his main motivation was catching Kramer. Even though each film has revealed more about Kramer&rsquo;s backstory and what led him to become Jigsaw, the character is extremely complex, and there&rsquo;s still room for more development.
Saw X&rsquo;s twist ending saw Kramer give away $250,000 to Carlos (Jorge Briseño). Although he&rsquo;d bonded with the young boy earlier in the film, it seemed like an unusual action from the horror villain. However, this decision of his allows for a new angle on who the character once was, something that will hopefully be expanded upon in Saw 11.</p>
<p>5  More Complex And Developed Traps
The Saw Traps Need To Be Shaken Up</p>
<p>Over the years, there have been several ways that characters have found a solution to Jigsaw&rsquo;s traps. Some of the easier Saw traps had simpler solutions, upon examination, but with ten films under the franchise&rsquo;s belt, it&rsquo;s no surprise that some escapes have started to feel a little repetitive or obvious. While Jigsaw is supposedly the ultimate mastermind, it would be great to see some of his victims get more creative with the traps. Perhaps Saw 11 will even see a character find a solution to a trap that Kramer himself couldn&rsquo;t have predicted, which could really throw the villain for a loop.</p>
<p>4  No More Secret Apprentices
The Reveal Of An Apprentice Has Become Predictable</p>
<p>Throughout the franchise, there have been several Saw characters who were working for Jigsaw. The reveal of a secret apprentice is no longer as secret as it once was, however. Jigsaw&rsquo;s secret apprentices have become such a staple for the films that it&rsquo;s now expected, with the first being Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) who had survived the reverse beartrap test in the first film, only to return in Saw II, with the reveal that Kramer had taken her under his wing.
While this plot twist brings interesting development for its characters, it&rsquo;s time for Saw 11 to hang up this trope. However, the next entry to the Saw series could still use this concept. Perhaps delving deeper into the ins and outs of working with John Kramer would allow for a deeper understanding of his character and how, without his apprentices, the events of each film could have been very different.</p>
<p>3  Saw 11 Needs To Fix The Series&rsquo; Mortality Rate
Too Many Characters Are Being Killed Off</p>
<p>While the earlier films saw survivors of Jigsaw&rsquo;s traps, later installments saw the franchise&rsquo;s mortality rate increase rapidly. The kill count in the Saw movies has varied, but the first Saw had only six deaths, whereas 2010&rsquo;s Saw 3D had an incredible 27. While it&rsquo;s expected that these films have had many, many deaths, especially with such a gorey concept, the possibility of survival was what kept audiences on the edge of their seat in anticipation.
Not knowing whether a character would escape the horror of Jigsaw&rsquo;s traps added to the atmosphere of the movie, but the extreme number of deaths in the later films loses that spark. If Saw 11 was to return to more of its original premise and have fewer deaths overall, it would allow for building more suspense. It would also give audiences more time to connect with the characters, rather than someone being introduced and needlessly killed before they could be developed properly.</p>
<p>2  Further Character Development For Existing Characters
Returning Characters Need To Have Their Stories Expanded</p>
<p>Although early story details for Saw 11 are rather minimal, there has been the implication that the next installment of the franchise will see the return of some existing characters. Saw X gave Cecilia (Synnøve Macody Lund) a rather ambiguous ending, trapped and supposedly being left for dead, despite surviving the test. Given that Cecilia had led a plot to convince Kramer he had been cured of cancer, it would be silly of him to let her live. Although, with his twisted mind, it&rsquo;s possible he has something more in mind for her, and hopefully this is something that may be addressed in Saw 11.
Saw X&rsquo;s post-credit scene also teased what could be potentially expected in Saw 11, with Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) returning for the first time since Saw 3D. Hoffman appeared in several points throughout the franchise, starting as a police officer and eventually becoming Kramer&rsquo;s successor, but did not appear in Saw X until this post-credit scene. Given where Saw X and Saw 11 are placed in the timeline, this version of Hoffman would be during his earlier days as Jigsaw&rsquo;s apprentice, which means that more of his backstory could be revealed.</p>
<p>1  Saw 11 Needs To Introduce More New And Relatable Victims
Being Able To Connect With A Character Is Essential For Any Story</p>
<p>Although the Saw franchise has seen many of Jigsaw&rsquo;s victims over the years, some of the later films have lacked in introducing more relatable victims. Saw II managed this aspect brilliantly, for example, as it was easy to root for Eric and be invested in his story as he tried to save his son from Jigsaw&rsquo;s games. The same could be said for Adam Faulkner-Stanheight (Leigh Whannell), who was simply a photographer who was roped into Kramer&rsquo;s world after taking a job.
Characters like these aren&rsquo;t as prominent in later Saw films, despite them being such a core part of what makes them work. If Saw 11does bring in some new characters, it&rsquo;s hoped that they will be more fleshed out. Characters with both relatable qualities and their respective flaws are essential for any film, but within the context of the Saw films, it really doubles down on the fear factor elements if the audience can see themselves in these characters.
