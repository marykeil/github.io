# Winnie-the-Pooh Blood &amp; Honey 2 s New Images Show A Closer Look At Christopher Robin &amp; Terrifying Pooh 


## SUMMARY 



  New images from Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 show a close-up of Pooh&#39;s new face and Christopher Robin looking horrified.   Although the first movie was critically panned, it performed well enough at the box office to justify a sequel.   Blood and Honey 2 will have a bigger budget than the first movie, which will allow for better creature effects, more kills, and the inclusion of characters like Owl and Tigger.

## Literature Review

New images have been released from Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood &amp; Honey 2, revealing a closer look at Pooh’s redesign and a terrified Christopher Robin.




Winnie-the-Pooh: Bloody and Honey 2&#39;s new images reveal the closest look yet at Pooh, in addition to revealing a first look at Christopher Robin. Taking advantage of A.A. Milne&#39;s beloved character, Winnie-the-Pooh, entering the public domain, filmmaker Rhys Frake-Waterfield&#39;s Blood and Honey was released last year. The horror film, which sees a murderous Winnie-the-Pooh seeking revenge against Christopher Robin, performed well enough at the box office to secure a green light for a sequel.




Now, as Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2&#39;s release date approaches, Collider shares two new images from the film. Check out the new images below:

         

One image depicts the return of Scott Chambers as Christopher Robin, looking quite scared as Pooh&#39;s murderous quest against him continues, while the other provides an up-close look at Winnie-the-Pooh&#39;s redesign.

                  How Winnie The Pooh: Blood And Honey Can Be Made (What About Disney?)   Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey is a horror retelling of a children’s classic. Here’s how the adaptation is possible without Disney’s permission.   


 What To Expect From Winnie-The-Pooh: Blood &amp; Honey 2 
          




Winnie-the-Pooh: Bloody and Honey&#39;s box office managed to cross some big milestones, relatively speaking, due to the viral nature of the film and its marketing, eventually crossing $5.2 million on a budget of only $100,000. Despite being critically panned, these numbers led to the confirmation of a sequel, and the follow-up will feature some notable changes.

The biggest change to come in the sequel is a bigger budget. While still seemingly still well below $1 million, the increased budget has allowed for a total redesign of the film&#39;s killer Winnie-the-Pooh, with Frake-Waterfield revealing that the prosthetics for the creatures featured in the sequel cost more than $20,000. According to the director, this increased budget also means more kills and more gore, and an all-around bigger movie.



Frake-Waterfield teased in an interview with EW that Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 will have a budget at least &#34;five times&#34; what the first movie had, suggesting the sequel has been made for around $500,000. This still makes it very much a micro-budget feature.







Another big change to come in Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 involves its characters. While Pooh and Piglet were the perpetrators of the violence in the first film, the sequel is adding Owl and Tigger into the mix as well. While story details have not yet been shared, Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey 2&#39;s impending Valentine&#39;s Day release date means a trailer is likely not far away.



The first Blood and Honey movie is currently available to stream on Peacock.
