## Literature Review



The Social Network 2 isn&#39;t officially confirmed, but director David Fincher teased the possibility of a sequel — and though there&#39;s a challenge when it comes to continuing this story, the advancement of social media offers an easy way to fix it. The original Social Network debuted back in 2010, chronicling the story of Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg in the lead-up to the platform&#39;s launch. Given the popularity of Facebook when the movie came out, The Social Network proved a massive hit. It might be difficult to replicate its success more than a decade later, but that doesn&#39;t mean Fincher and Aaron Sorkin shouldn&#39;t try.




One obstacle facing The Social Network 2 is how to continue the story of Zuckerberg and Facebook for a modern-day audience. Both the platform and its creator have become controversial since The Social Network&#39;s release, and Facebook&#39;s declining popularity among new generations may cause the movie to flop. As such, The Social Network 2 probably shouldn&#39;t focus on Facebook — and it really doesn&#39;t need to.

 The Social Network 2 Should Focus On A Different Social Media Platform 
          

The Social Network 2 can solve its Facebook problem by abandoning the social media platform altogether and focusing on another in the sequel. The title doesn&#39;t allude to any specific app or network, and there&#39;s no shortage of social media channels for a sequel to follow. Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have all grown massively between The Social Network&#39;s release and now, and each platform has its own backstory and creator. There&#39;s no need for The Social Network 2 to return to Zuckerberg and Facebook, especially when doing so might hurt the movie&#39;s chances of success.

Given the time that&#39;s passed between The Social Network and its potential sequel, jumping to another platform would make the most sense. It would offer a fresh take on the story, one that could appeal to younger generations familiar with different social platforms. It would also eliminate the need to continue the story from the first film, solving a lot of problems in the process.



 A Social Network Sequel Doesn&#39;t Need To Connect To The First Movie 
          

The Social Network 2&#39;s challenges aren&#39;t limited to the evolution of Facebook, and continuing the first movie is a difficult task regardless. For one, there&#39;s no need to continue The Social Network&#39;s story. The film already delivers a satisfying conclusion, and the continued growth of Facebook directly after wouldn&#39;t make for a compelling narrative. Likewise, it might be difficult to get the original Social Network cast to return for a sequel. Fortunately, The Social Network 2 doesn&#39;t need to connect to the first movie to work. It can have a similar story and themes, but its characters, plot, and network can be completely new.
