## Literature Review

Kevin Smith&#39;s beloved stoner duo is returning to lead another movie, and there are already exciting updates about Jay and Silent Bob&#39;s next adventure.




Kevin Smith&#39;s beloved stoner duo Jay &amp; Silent Bob will be returning in another cinematic adventure with Smith once again penning the hilarious script. Making their debut in the indie sensation Clerks in 1994, Jay &amp; Silent Bob quickly became one of the most popular parts of Kevin Smith&#39;s View Askew universe, and only a handful of the director&#39;s films don&#39;t feature an appearance by the loudmouthed Jay and his quite buddy. Though they typically play supporting roles, Jay &amp; Silent Bob have also starred in two solo movies of their own, further solidifying their place in pop culture.




Seen most recently in 2022&#39;s Clerks III, Jay &amp; Silent Bob were once again on hand to lend a bit of levity with their outlandish antics. While Clerks III was something of a disappointment, every Jay and Silent Bob movie is elevated by their presence, and they may come to truly represent Kevin Smith&#39;s legacy as a director in the future. As such, it only makes sense for the director to return to the well again and again, especially when he can continue to do other projects. Smith obviously loves the characters, which is why he is bringing Jay &amp; Silent Bob back again.

Not long after Kevin Smith formally announced the project, the acclaimed director provided story details for Jay &amp; Silent Bob 3. While honoring the 30th anniversary of the characters, Smith took to social media to clarify the third movie starring the stoner duo, and he shined a light on what their newest adventure will entail. Smith teased that Jay &amp; Silent Bob 3 would involve an &#34;escalating war in the Central Jersey legal weed business&#34;. Smith also mentioned that he and his co-star Jason Mewes would be donning the costumes in 2024, suggesting production might begin soon.





 



 A New Jay &amp; Silent Bob Universe Movie Is Confirmed 
          

A new Jay &amp; Silent Bob movie was confirmed by Kevin Smith in December 2023, and it is an exciting continuation of his View Askewniverse following Clerks III. Speaking in a somewhat joking manner, Smith (who plays Silent Bob) mentioned that he &#34;lost a bet&#34; with Jason Mewes (who plays Jay), and thus was forced to write another script. All jokes aside, Smith reaffirmed his love for the characters and contextualized the upcoming movie through his own experience with his co-star Mewes. Smith said &#34;we always kind of have fun doing those and stuff...so I&#39;m writing another Jay and Bob movie&#34;.






 The New Jay &amp; Silent Bob Movie Cast 
          

So far, the only two cast members that are confirmed for the new Jay &amp; Silent Bob movie are the titular stoner duo themselves. With Kevin Smith penning the script and presumably directing as well, he is guaranteed to return as Silent Bob, while his long-time co-star Jason Mewes will be back as Jay. Though nothing is certain yet, it wouldn&#39;t be entirely out of the question to see other characters from the View Askewniverse show up as well.



 How Does The New Movie Fit Into The Jay &amp; Silent Bob Universe? 
          

If the movie focuses squarely on the eponymous pair, they will likely embark on a wacky standalone adventure that won&#39;t have much to do with the larger View Askewniverse narrative. The characters have bounced in and out of Smith&#39;s other films, but they have also existed largely on the outside as supporting characters. However, if Smith continues his nostalgic streak seen most recently in Clerks III, this new movie could see the 30-year-old characters finally settle down.

Smith spoke candidly about what the new movie will entail, and though the details were scant, it&#39;s obvious that Jay &amp; Silent Bob will continue the stoner duo&#39;s wacky adventures. Smith teased a war within the legal cannabis business in New Jersey, and there is no doubt that the pot-loving pair will be in the middle of the fracas. As the world has grown since the characters debuted three decades ago, it only makes sense for Jay and Silent Bob&#39;s story to evolve while still maintaining their hilarious core values.
