# Barry Keoghan s Famous Co-Star Predicted He d Play The Joker 5 Years Before He Was In The Batman


## SUMMARY 



  Barry Keoghan&#39;s The Batman and The Killing of a Sacred Deer co-star Colin Farrell accurately predicted Keoghan&#39;s casting as the Joker five years before Matt Reeves cast him as Batman&#39;s archnemesis.   The Batman&#39;s ending sets up a potential team-up between the Riddler, the Joker, and other Arkham patients in future sequels, but Robert Pattinson&#39;s Dark Knight may not fight Joker in The Batman - Part II.   Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker could have a minor supporting role in The Batman - Part II before a potential main villain role in The Batman - Part III.

## Literature Review

A member of The Batman&#39;s cast accurately predicted that Barry Keoghan would play the Joker long before Matt Reeves began developing the movie.




The Batman actor Barry Keoghan reveals that his co-star and Penguin actor Colin Farrell once accurately predicted his DC movie casting. Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman follows Robert Pattinson&#39;s Dark Knight as he crosses paths with three iconic Gotham villains for the first time: the Riddler, the Penguin, and Catwoman. However, a fourth Batman enemy is introduced during The Batman&#39;s ending scenes, when the Riddler meets his cellmate â€” who&#39;s none other than the Joker. Although The Batman doesn&#39;t fully show the Dark Knight&#39;s archnemesis on screen, a deleted scene confirms that Barry Keoghan portrays the Joker in Matt Reeves&#39; The Batman trilogy.




Barry Keoghan&#39;s limited screentime in The Batman is just a small taste of what the actor has in store for the character, but it seems like his potential has been clear for years. In a recent GQ video (via YouTube), Barry Keoghan reminisces about his experience shooting Yorgos Lanthimos&#39; The Killing of a Sacred Deer, where he co-starred with Colin Farrell, who plays the Penguin in The Batman. According to Keoghan, Farrell was so impressed with his performance as the eccentric teenager Martin Lang that he said &#34;you&#39;re gonna probably play the Joker one day after this character&#34;.

Little is known about The Batman - Part II&#39;s plot and cast, but The Batman&#39;s ending does seem to set up an eventual team-up between the Riddler and the Joker. It&#39;s unlikely that Robert Pattinson&#39;s Batman will fight Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker in the first sequel, though, as such a story would likely share too many similarities with Christopher Nolan&#39;s The Dark Knight. Besides, there are many other members of Batman&#39;s rogue gallery that could make for a more interesting threat on the big screen than the Joker, who has been translated to the big screen multiple times already.

Nevertheless, Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker could still be a supporting character in The Batman - Part II, possibly as the mastermind behind a brewing plan to break himself and other patients out of Arkham. Otherwise, Keoghan&#39;s Joker could be the Arkham patient Batman could resort to when he needs help to defeat The Batman - Part II&#39;s main villain. After all, the fact that the Joker is already at Arkham suggests that he and Batman already have an established history despite Batman&#39;s short career as a vigilante.




Another possibility for the Joker&#39;s role in The Batman - Part II would be a flashback scene that either shows how exactly Robert Pattinson&#39;s Batman captured Barry Keoghan&#39;s Joker and sent him to Arkham or reveals how he developed his facial scarring and adopted the Joker persona. Alternatively, The Batman - Part II could simply feature another brief Joker cameo that sets up a bigger role for the villain in The Batman - Part III, or skip a new appearance altogether and instead incorporate The Batman&#39;s deleted scene at some point in The Batman - Part II&#39;s story.
