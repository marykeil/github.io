 10  South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut (1999) 
Banned in Iraq


 







South Park is one of the most successful adult animated shows in history, and it received a movie adaptation in 1999. The movie depicts Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny sneaking in to see an R-rated Terrence &amp; Philip movie at the cinema and starting to swear repeatedly. Because of this, a movement led by Kyle&#39;s mother results in the United States declaring war on Canada, and the kids must try to save Terrence and Philip and put things right.
South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut was praised for its story, parodies, and its soundtrack of catchy songs. However, it was banned in Iraq as it portrayed a parody of their then-President Saddam Hussein, as being in a relationship with the Devil. After Hussein was captured, tried, and executed for his crimes against humanity, it was rumored that he was forced to watch the movie repeatedly as part of his torture. While this rumor has not been confirmed, the show&#39;s creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker later received a signed photo of the dictator from the U.S. Marines (via Telegraph).





 9  The Da Vinci Code (2006) 
Banned in the Solomon Islands
        

Adapted from the 2003 Dan Brown novel, The Da Vinci Code stars Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon, the prime suspect in the murder of a curator at the Louvre Museum. Escaping with the help of Sophie Neveu, they begin a search for the Holy Grail in the hopes of clearing his name. They discover clues in Da Vinci&#39;s famous paintings that could lead to the discovery of the legendary treasure.
The movie received a mixed reception from critics and proved controversial for its fictional portrayal of historical events and figures. Among different countries, it was banned in the Solomon Islands. The minister of the Solomon Islands decided to ban The Da Vinci Code in 2006 as he stated that its message threatened the country&#39;s prominent Christian faith.





 8  All Quiet on the Western Front (1930) 
Banned in France until 1963
        

Based on the 1929 book by Erich Maria Remarque, All Quiet On The Western Front was one of the first anti-war films released in history. The movie shows a group of young German schoolboys who are encouraged to enlist in the war by their teacher. But once they enter the battleground, they are introduced to the harsh realities of war; the movie received a positive reception, winning the Best Picture Academy Award in 1930 and later received a remake in 2022 that was also nominated for Best Picture.
Despite the critical acclaim, both the movie and the original book were criticized due to their depiction of World War I; the movie was banned in France for its anti-war messages to audiences. The ban was eventually lifted in 1963 and the 2022 remake was later released in cinemas with no issues.

 7  The Exorcist (1973) 
Banned in the United Kingdom until 1984


 







The Exorcist is often regarded as one of the most frightening horror films ever made. The movie depicts a young girl possessed by a demon after she accidentally summons it through an Ouija board. With the help of two Catholic priests, her mother attempts to save her from the demon&#39;s hold through an exorcism.


Due to its disturbing content and its dark portrayal of religion, The Exorcist faced concern from parents about being too frightening for younger audiences. While it was initially shown in cinemas, the movie was later removed and banned from VHS release in the United Kingdom to protect children from its frightening story. The movie remained banned for 11 years until it was finally released on video, in 1984.





 6  The Hunger Games (2012) 
Banned in Vietnam


 







Starring Jennifer Lawrence, The Hunger Games is set in a dystopian future where the nation of Panem is divided into 12 districts and hosts an annual event called The Hunger Games, a televised competition where only the winner emerges alive. Skilled archer Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her younger sister&#39;s place in the 74th Hunger Games. Alongside fellow tribute Peeta Mellark, Katniss fights to survive the game and ends up starting a rebellion that changes everything.
The movie was a successful book-to-film adaptation, receiving praise for its acting and faithfulness to the source material, so many were surprised when The Hunger Games was banned in Vietnam upon its initial release in 2012. A member of the National Censorship Board in Vietnam declared that the concept of young people fighting was too cruel for audiences. Surprisingly, all three sequels in the franchise were later released in Vietnamese cinemas, with no issues.





 5  Halloween (2007) 
Banned in Thailand
        

Many horror films have seen remakes over the years, and the Halloween franchise received one in 2007. Directed by Rob Zombie, Halloween portrays Michael Myers, a man who murdered his family as a child, breaking out of a mental asylum. He stalks a young teenager, Laurie Strode, and her friends, planning to cause true horror on their Halloween night.
The 2007 remake of Halloween received a mixed reception from critics, with some citing it as insufficient compared to the original movie; it was also criticized for its disturbing and gory murder scenes. The movie was banned in Thailand due to its graphic depictions of violence; the 2018 remake was later released in the country with an 18&#43; rating.





 4  Meet the Feebles (1989) 
Banned in Ireland
        

Director Peter Jackson brings his adaptation of animalized puppets to life in this 1989 black comedy. Depicted as the exact opposite of Jim Henson&#39;s Muppets, Meet the Feebles sees a group of puppets working as part of a variety show. With a combination of drug addiction, pornography, and murder, the movie offers a sleazier side of show business to viewers using puppets.
Meet the Feebles caused significant controversy upon its release, for its depiction of puppets committing acts such as murder. It was one of many films that were censored and banned in Ireland because its dark themes and inappropriate language went against the beliefs of the Irish Catholic Church. While many banned films have since been certified as viewable by the Irish Film Classification Office, Meet the Feebles remains one of the few films still banned in Ireland, as of 2023.





 3  Barbie (2023) 
Banned in Vietnam


 







Greta Gerwig&#39;s Barbie offered a humorous and emotional insight into the world of the famous doll. When Barbie suffers an emotional crisis, she ventures into the real world with Ken to set things right. With the help of a teenage girl and her mother, Barbie begins a journey of self-discovery and what the future holds for her; meanwhile, Ken searches for a way to be seen by the world as more than just Barbie&#39;s boyfriend.


Barbie was released to high acclaim from critics and audiences, with many regarding it as a hilarious and heart-warming insight into the world of the famous doll. However, it was surprisingly banned from Vietnam upon release, with critics pointing out a scene depicting a world map with a nine-dash line representing China and its claims to the Red Sea. Barbie&#39;s distribution company, Warner Bros, later released a report, saying that the world map was not meant to cause any harm and was not making any political statement (via Variety).

 2  The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) 
Banned in the United Kingdom
        

Created by Carl Theodor Dyer, The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the greatest silent films ever made. It stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as the French heroine and depicts her trial for heresy before being burned at the stake. In the decades following its initial release, the movie has been acclaimed for Falconetti&#39;s performance and Dyer&#39;s direction.
While it did receive positive reviews upon its initial release, The Passion of Joan of Arc was also criticized by the Catholic Church for its depiction of the infamous trial. The movie also received a ban in the United Kingdom for portraying British soldiers as pompous terrorizers. Despite the ban imposed in the United Kingdom, The Passion of Joan of Arc is still often regarded by many as the greatest film ever created.





 1  Back to the Future (1985) 
Banned in China


 







Starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, the 1985 film Back to the Future shows Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time by his scientist friend, &#34;Doc&#34; Brown. After inadvertently stopping his parents from falling in love in the past, Marty must find a way to bring them together again to save his future. The movie saw the release of two successful sequels and is recognized as one of the greatest science fiction movies in history.
In the years since its release, Back to the Future is shockingly no longer considered appropriate for audiences in China. According to Chinese regulators, the concept of time travel in the movie was used inappropriately and &#34;disregarded the importance of past events&#34; (via The Atlantic). Despite China&#39;s decision to ban it from viewership, Back to the Future is still regarded as one of the greatest time-travel movies ever made.
