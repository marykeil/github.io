## Literature Review

There are some major franchises, where the best stories don&#39;t happen in the movies at all, but instead are seen in books, comics, or television.




There are some franchises that, despite being major blockbuster box office successes, have even better stories occurring outside the movies. Plenty of blockbuster franchises also have firmly established releases in the world of books, comics, and television that expand the characters and lore seen in their films. Due to the limited run time of movies, other mediums often work better to further develop characters&#39; backstories, tell interesting side stories, or shed new light on another aspect of the franchise.
There are some blockbuster franchises, such as The Matrix, that have utilized the power of animated television series to tell interesting stories that expand on the history and narratives outlined in the original films. Some movie franchises, like The Wizarding World, were based on already existing book series and, despite the films behind enjoyable spectacles in and of themselves, did not have time to tell some of the best side stories within the novels. Other franchises are based on comic books, like Batman, which, despite releasing films for decades, still have so many fantastic stories that have yet to get the big screen treatment.









 








 10  The Matrix (1999 – 2021) 
The best stories happen in The Animatrix animated series


 







The original Matrix movie by the Wachowskis was a revolutionary moment in the history of cinema that acted as the definitive example of the cyberpunk genre. However, the sequels were incredibly complex and there was a sense that each new entry led to diminishing returns. However, The Matrix franchise arguably produced some of its best stories not in the world of film but through the animated anthology series The Animatrix. This compilation of nine animated short films helped expand the world of The Matrix and gave major insight into the war between humanity and machines that led to the creation of the Matrix in the first place.





 9  The Lord of the Rings (2001 – Present) 
The best stories happen in The Silmarillion book
        

For those with a deep interest in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth, his poetical collection of myths, The Silmarillion, can be an even more interesting experience than Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings film series. Although unpublished in Tolkien’s lifetime, The Silmarillion provided a deep backstory into the lore of Middle Earth and gave incredible insight into events that happened long before Bilbo Baggins came into contact with the One Ring. While The Silmarillion may be a step too far into the realm of Middle Earth for the casual viewer, for those with an obsessive interest in the fantasy series it provided even better stories than the movies.





 8  The Wizarding World (2001 – Present) 
The best stories happen in the Harry Potter books
        

The film releases of the Wizarding World consist of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies that have wowed viewers with their spectacular representation of magic and wonder. Despite this, the best stories of the Wizarding World remain in J.K. Rowling’s original Harry Potter book series. With so much extra time to develop its characters, focus on interesting side stories, and further expand the series lore, the books add depth and maturity to the series and provide plenty of incredible stories that don’t happen in the movies. Examples include the mischievous Peeves the Poltergeist, an in-depth backstory of the Marauders, and Hermoine’s activism to promote elf welfare.





 7  Batman (1943 – Present) 
The best stories happen in the Batman comics


 







Of course, the Batman movies are some of the most successful superhero films of all time and Christopher Nolan’s trilogy of movies helped revitalize the genre with a darker, grittier tone. But despite this, the best Batman stories always came from the original comics, and this still stands as the definitive way to experience the character. Legendary comic book runs, like Alan Moore’s Batman: The Killing Joke, have acted as the primary source for the many depictions of The Dark Knight on screen, and those who wish to experience the character as originally intended would be wise to read the comics.





 6  Star Trek (1966 – Present) 
The best stories happen in the television series
        

Despite 13 Star Trek movies being made, it was on television that the franchise truly shined. Starting in 1966 with the release of Star Trek: The Original Series, Star Trek’s best moments came from its many television series. Despite the characters from the original having appeared on the big screen, and The Next Generation also leading their series of feature films, the best stories in this series usually came from a more episodic style of storytelling. While the rebooted Star Trek film series was a hit at the box office, the movies could never overtake the legacy of the television shows.





 5  The Terminator (1984 – 2019) 
The best stories happen in Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles


 







  Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles  


  Release Date    January 13, 2008     Cast    Lena Headey , Thomas Dekker , Summer Glau , Brian Austin Green , Garret Dillahunt , Richard T. Jones , Leven Rambin , Stephanie Jacobsen     Genres     Sci-Fi , Action     Seasons    2    


While the best story in the Terminator franchise remained James Cameron’s original narrative outlined in Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, the franchise failed to reach those highs ever again in anything except the television series Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. Over two seasons and 31 episodes, the series, which starred Lena Headey as Sarah Connor, featured some of the best adventures ever seen in the franchise. Despite being the only entry in the franchise that proved it could work without Arnold Schwarzenegger, The Sarah Connor Chronicles was quickly canceled due to low ratings and never got a chance to live up to its potential.





 4  Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992 – Present) 
The best stories happen on the Buffy the Vampire Slayer television series


 







  Buffy The Vampire Slayer  


  Release Date    March 10, 1997     Cast    Sarah Michelle Gellar , Nicholas Brendon , Alyson Hannigan , Charisma Carpenter , Dan Rubin , David Boreanaz , Seth Green , James Marsters     Genres    Action , Comedy , Drama , Horror , Supernatural     Seasons    7    


Buffy the Vampire Slayer was one of the most iconic television series of the late 1990s and early 2000s to such a degree that it was easy to forget that it started in the world of film. The original 1992 Buffy the Vampire Slayer did not feature Sarah Michelle Geller in the role of Buffy Summers and instead starred Kristy Swanson as the titular vampire slayer. Lacking much of the charm and maturity of the later TV series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer failed as a film and was luckily revived by its writer Joss Whedon for the small screen five years later.





 3  Marvel Cinematic Universe (2008 – Present) 
The best stories now happen on the television series
        

The Marvel Cinematic Universe revolutionized the modern movie landscape. However, since the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, superhero movie fatigue has started to kick in and the feature releases in the franchise have not felt as exciting. However, this was not the case on the small screen, as television series like WandaVision and Loki have been telling the best new stories the franchise has to offer. After decades of major cinematic releases such as the Avengers movies, the more episode style of storytelling available to television series has been a breath of fresh air when it comes to the MCU.





 2  Karate Kid (1984 – Present) 
The best stories happen on Cobra Kai on Netflix
        

  Cobra Kai  


  Cast    Tanner Buchanan , Xolo Mariduena , Mary Mouser , Connor Murdock , Ralph Macchio , Nichole Brown , Jacob Bertrand , Griffin Santopietro , William Zabka     Genres    Comedy , Drama , Action     Seasons    5     Story By    josh heald    


The coming-of-age franchise The Karate Kid has been depicting teenagers taught in the ways of martial arts for 40 years now and, despite the original film’s reputation as a 1980s classic, even better stories have been told on the small screen. The Cobra Kai television sequel series on Netflix helped revitalize the franchise after years of movie sequels and reboots that varied in quality. With an awareness of the legacy of the original film, Cobra Kai blended nostalgia with well-written stories and an incredible cast of characters in an insanely watchable series that delivered the best stories in the franchise.





 1  Star Wars (1977 – Present) 
The best stories happen in the television series
        

Star Wars made a name for itself with the original movie trilogy, but, since then, the best stories have occurred not in the films but in television series. An early example of a Star Wars series overtaking the films in quality was the 2008 animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars which helped expand the lore of the universe and became one of the greatest entries in the entire franchise. The success of Star Wars on the small screen continued with incredible live-action television series on Disney&#43; like The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka, that showcased the franchise telling smaller more intimate stories.
