# Quentin Tarantino s Final Movie Is Reusing A Genius Once Upon A Time In Hollywood Trick


## SUMMARY 



  Quentin Tarantino&#39;s upcoming film, The Movie Critic, will continue his trend of featuring real movies from the era in which the film is set, just like he did in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.   The inclusion of real films in The Movie Critic makes sense because the film is all about movies and film criticism, similar to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&#39;s homage to 1960s Hollywood.   Incorporating real footage and scenes from old &#39;70s movies allows Tarantino to pay tribute to the art of filmmaking while reflecting on a ripe era for great cinema in what will be his final film.

## Literature Review

In his upcoming movie, which will serve as his final film before retirement, Quentin Tarantino is reusing an old Once Upon A Time In Hollywood trick.




In his upcoming final film, The Movie Critic, Quentin Tarantino is reusing a movie trick that proved successful in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Tarantino is one of modern cinema&#39;s most renowned and talented directors, boasting an impressive roster of iconic films. In his own view, Tarantino has made nine films throughout his career so far, as he discounts his directorial debut and considers both Kill Bill installments to be one movie. His most recent film was 2019&#39;s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which takes place during the end of Hollywood&#39;s golden age in 1969.




Tarantino&#39;s next cinematic venture will mark the tenth film of his directorial career, and also his last. Set in the &#39;70s, Tarantino&#39;s The Movie Critic will follow a pornographic film critic whose crass and comedic movie reviews are said to be inspired by Travis Bickle&#39;s journal entries from Martin Scorsese&#39;s Taxi Driver (1976). The Movie Critic will also be similar to one of Tarantino&#39;s previous films by paralleling Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in one key way.

                  Every Actor Who Must Return For Quentin Tarantino&#39;s 10th &amp; Last Movie   Quentin Tarantino has said he plans to retire after making 10 movies, and with one more to go, here&#39;s who must return for his 10th and final movie.   


 Quentin Tarantino&#39;s The Movie Critic Will Feature Older Movies (Similar To OUATIH) 
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood incorporated real scenes from old movies
          

It looks like Tarantino will be continuing a movie trend of his in The Movie Critic by featuring extracts and recreations of real movies from the same era in which the film is set. Acclaimed Taxi Driver screenwriter Paul Schrader revealed that Tarantino&#39;s final movie will feature footage from real &#39;70s movies. In fact, Tarantino sought Schrader&#39;s permission to &#34;redo the ending of Rolling Thunder,&#34; a 1977 revenge movie that Schrader wrote. The ending of Rolling Thunder was different in Schrader&#39;s original screenplay before it was &#34;completely rewritten and watered down.&#34; It seems Tarantino wants to feature the original ending of Rolling Thunder in The Movie Critic.




This is not the first time Tarantino has inserted era-specific movies in his period pieces. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, featured archive footage from 1960s movies like Lady in Cement and Three in the Attic, as well as The Wrecking Crew starring Sharon Tate, whom Margot Robbie plays in OUATIH. Tarantino also digitally altered footage from the &#39;60s by inserting Leonardo DiCaprio&#39;s fictional movie star character, Rick Dalton, into select scenes and replacing the original actors. These include Burt Reynolds in F.B.I., Ty Hardin in Death on the Run, and Steve McQueen in The Great Escape.



 Why The Movie Critic&#39;s Story Choice Makes A Lot Of Sense 
It&#39;s fitting that Tarantino is continuing this trend in The Movie Critic
          

Tarantino&#39;s use of real 60s movie footage worked well in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood because the film served as an homage to 1960s Hollywood and filmmaking. It sounds like The Movie Critic might be a similar type of celebratory film about filmmaking (or rather, film criticism), only this time, it&#39;s touching on the &#39;70s. Reusing the same OUATIH technique in The Movie Critic makes sense because this movie will also be all about movies. The Movie Critic&#39;s premise warrants the inclusion of real movies from the same era it&#39;s exploring.




                  11 Greatest Moments From All Quentin Tarantino Movies   Quentin Tarantino&#39;s films are known for having tons of great moments, filled with iconic quotes, witty dialogue, suspense, and violence.   

It&#39;s also fitting that Tarantino is planning to incorporate more real films in The Movie Critic because it will be his last movie. Using real footage and even recreating particular scenes from old &#39;70s movies can allow Tarantino to reflect on a particularly ripe era for great cinema while honoring his love for the art form. With his self-imposed retirement on the horizon, Tarantino has the opportunity to pay tribute to the art of filmmaking in his final film, The Movie Critic.
