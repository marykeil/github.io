  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The ending of Emerald Fennell&rsquo;s Saltburn is built on a web of lies spun by Oliver Quick and reveals the twisted layers of his obsession with Felix.</p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>Ollie&rsquo;s obsession with Felix and the Saltburn estate leads him to murder both Felix and Venetia in a premeditated plan to gain control and power.   Ollie poisons Felix with a lethal amount of cocaine, framing his death as an accidental overdose or suicide.   Ollie manipulates the situation to reinsert himself into Elspeth&rsquo;s life after James&rsquo;s death in order to become the heir of the Saltburn estate.</p>
<p>The shocking ending of Saltburn reveals the true intentions behind Oliver Quick&rsquo;s obsession with Felix Catton and the luxurious Saltburn estate. Ollie (Barry Keoghan) is introduced as a lonely outcast at the prestigious Oxford University who becomes unlikely friends with the larger-than-life Felix (Jacob Elordi) and his socially elite friends. Transfixed by Felix&rsquo;s carefree lifestyle and effortless ability to get everything he wants, Ollie devises a master plan of winning Felix over, which is fully revealed in the final moments of Emerald Fennell&rsquo;s provocative dark thriller.</p>
<p>Saltburn is the sophomore directorial effort by Fennell, who rose to prominence as a director with her Oscar-winning 2020 film Promising Young Woman which starred Carey Mulligan. The film has apparent similarities to the plot of Anthony Minghella&rsquo;s 1999 classic The Talented Mr. Ripley, in which Matt Damon&rsquo;s con artist protagonist Tom Ripley becomes enamored with the magnificence of the wealthy, cultured, and adventurous Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law) and Marge Sherwood (Gwenyth Paltrow). In the end, Saltburn becomes a twisted and unsettling premeditation of a parasite in human form.</p>

<p>What Happens In Saltburn&rsquo;s Ending
Close</p>
<p>Saltburn starts heading for its climactic finale after the sudden death of Felix, which at first glance appears to be from an accidental overdose or some other type of fatal error. James and Elspeth try to carry on with their regularly formal and proper lifestyles in spite of their son&rsquo;s death as Farleigh (Archie Madekwe) and Venetia (Alison Oliver) can barely hold their composure at the table. Felix&rsquo;s body is taken away and the Catton family essentially disowns Farleigh after Ollie reveals that he had been serving large amounts of cocaine at Ollie&rsquo;s massive birthday party the night before.</p>
<p>Venetia is later found in a Saltburn bathtub filled with her own blood. James, distraught and perplexed by the back-to-back deaths of his two children and the ostracization of his symbolic third child Farleigh, pays Ollie off to leave Saltburn once and for all. Ollie appears to have been living in his own luxury from the buyout money until he comes across James&rsquo; obituary in the newspaper nearly two decades later. The film, which took place during the mid-2000s, jumps to the present day when Ollie &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; runs into Elspeth at a cafe, gets invited back to Saltburn, and swiftly prompts her death so he will become the heir of the Saltburn estate.</p>
<p>Ollie Poisoned Felix With A Lethal Amount Of Cocaine</p>
<p>While Felix&rsquo;s death in Saltburn appears to be some type of fatal accident or potentially even death by suicide, Ollie reveals his plan to murder Felix all along in the closing minutes of the film. Ollie is seen pouring something into his bottle of wine or liquor before he sneaks up on Felix in the hedge maze the night of his death. Felix tells Ollie that he makes his blood run cold, which ends up being exactly what Ollie does to Felix. Ollie undoubtedly poisoned Felix and likely used a lethal amount of Farliegh&rsquo;s cocaine to do it. He essentially killed two birds with one stone in his sinister pursuit to take control of Saltburn.</p>
<p>Ollie Killed Venetia &amp; Framed It As A Suicide</p>
<p>Ollie wasted little time in taking out the last living Catton child and heir to the Saltburn throne by framing Venetia&rsquo;s death as a suicide. Ollie strangely walks in on Venetia as she is taking a bath. Knowing she is clearly drunk, Ollie finds it an opportune time to take advantage of the situation and kills Venetia with razor blades. Venetia, like Felix, had exposed Ollie as the parasitical force that he was, which led Ollie to take her out of the picture in order to preserve his shot at staying at Saltburn in the long run. Interestingly, a police investigation regarding the deaths of Felix and Venetia never followed Ollie after James asked him to leave Saltburn.</p>
<p>Ollie&rsquo;s Bizzare Graveyard Scene Explained</p>
<p>The scene that fully encapsulates the disturbing strangeness of Ollie is his unforgettable display above Felix&rsquo;s grave. Following Felix&rsquo;s death, Ollie falls to his knees and sobs uncontrollably on the dirt where Felix&rsquo;s body is buried. He goes from hugging the ground to caressing it and eventually gets fully naked and sexual in a bizarre display of his deepest and most conflicting feelings toward Felix. Ollie is certainly viewed as a heathen at Saltburn who is obsessed with having the rank, power, and wealth that comes with the territory. This creates the extreme love/hate dynamic that Ollie develops for Felix, as portrayed quite clearly in the explicit graveyard scene.</p>
<p>Ollie Waited Years For James&rsquo; Death To Take Advantage Of Elspeth</p>
<p>Ollie left Saltburn with a check in his pocket and honored James&rsquo; wishes to never return, that is until he was dead. Ollie was likely very happy to have made it out of Saltburn unscathed and with a large sum of money, which he used to live a luxurious lifestyle in England for many years. Once he discovered that James had died naturally, he knew it was his best, and final, shot of becoming the heir to Saltburn. Since he had stalked and manipulated Felix into making him think that they had just naturally become friends, he clearly developed a similar premeditated strategy to &ldquo;randomly&rdquo; run into Elspeth and reinsert himself into her life, which he ultimately ended.</p>
<p>The Real Meaning of Saltburn&rsquo;s Ending</p>
<p>The ending of Saltburn leaves Ollie as the last person standing to claim ownership of the Saltburn estate, which is apparently the only thing that he has wanted throughout the entire movie. Although Ollie claims repeatedly that he had loved Felix, his obsessive greed and lust for power are apparently much stronger than any genuine feelings he had developed for him or any member of the Catton family. Saltburn&rsquo;s ending proves that Ollie is a complete monster who ended the Catton family piece by piece so that he could basically dance in the nude around their multimillion-dollar mansion.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no doubt by the end of Saltburn that Ollie is a sociopath, a murderer, and an incredibly deceitful individual who is motivated only by power and wealth. The first sign of this is revealed when Felix drives him to his parents&rsquo; house, who are nothing like the horrible people Ollie had claimed them to be. Ollie would have liked to become an honorary member of the Catton family, like Farleigh, and live together as one for potentially the rest of his life. However, when the Catton&rsquo;s saw what he really was, his dream of living at Saltburn could only be realized through the same path of lies, betrayal, and manipulation that got his foot in the door in the first place.</p>
