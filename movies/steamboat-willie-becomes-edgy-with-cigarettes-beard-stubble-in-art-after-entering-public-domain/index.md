# Steamboat Willie Becomes Edgy With Cigarettes &amp; Beard Stubble In Art After Entering Public Domain


## SUMMARY 



  Steamboat Willie, the early version of Mickey Mouse, has entered the public domain as of January 1, 2024, after almost a century of being copyrighted.   Comic book artist Francesco Francavilla has created a unique drawing of an edgier version of Steamboat Willie, with crossed arms and a cigar, leaning against the steamboat&#39;s wheel.   As Mickey Mouse enters the public domain, artists and filmmakers are free to adapt the character, leading to discussions of potential horror movies and the announcement of two Steamboat Willie-based horror films.

## Literature Review

Steamboat Willie is transformed into a much edgier version of Mickey Mouse in new art, just after the character has entered the public domain.




Steamboat Willie is made edgier in new art as the early version of Mickey Mouse enters the public domain. Released in 1928, Steamboat Willie is a Disney animated short that positions Mickey as a ship captain steering a steamboat down a river. After spending almost a century copyrighted, this version of Mickey Mouse entered the public domain as of January 1, 2024.




Now, comic book artist Francesco Francavilla has rendered a unique drawing of Mickey’s Steamboat Willie. In the art, the edgy version of the character has his arms crossed and is smoking a cigar. He is leaning against the steamboat’s steering wheel.


 

In the caption for their post, Francavilla calls attention to the fortune at the bottom, which reads, “Boats and water are in your future.” This is his first drawing of 2024.


 The Steamboat Willie Renaissance Explained 
          

Prior to the dawn of the new year, Steamboat Willie was already being discussed again. This was due to the knowledge that the Steamboat Willie copyright would expire in 2024, leaving artists and filmmakers open to do what they choose with the early Mickey Mouse product. Even early conversations in 2023 prepped audiences for the likelihood of a Mickey Mouse horror movie, given the rise of mascot horror (a subgenre that subverts the innocence of childhood mascots by turning them into ruthless killers) and the impending entrance of Steamboat Willie into the public domain.




                  After Mickey Mouse, All Other Major Characters &amp; Franchises Who Lose Copyright In The 2020s   Mickey Mouse&#39;s appearance in Steamboat Willie isn&#39;t the only major character to lose copyright in the 2020s, with many famous examples soon to follow.   

As soon as the new year arrived, the internet was abuzz with conversation about potential Steamboat Willie horror movies, spoofing titles like “Steamboat Killie” and suggesting specific ways to adapt scenes from the short. Less than 24 hours later, not one, but two Steamboat Willie-based horror films were announced. The first is a Jamie Bailey-directed slasher horror titled Mickey’s Mouse Trap, which dropped its trailer and aims for a March release date. The second will be a comedy-horror film from The Mean One director Steven LaMorte, which is eyeing this spring for the start of production.



Steven LaMorte&#39;s Steamboat Willie movie will position Mickey Mouse as a devious ship captain who wreaks havoc on unsuspecting ferry passengers.







Francavilla’s Steamboat Willie art is the next in what is likely to be a long line of artistic renditions of the Mickey Mouse character. With the character in the public domain, there is now no limit on who can adapt him, leaving room for myriad interpretations. As both Steamboat Willie horror films prepare for release, Mickey Mouse fans can take enjoyment from the slew of art to come in this renaissance.
