## Literature Review



Ed and Lorrain Warren movies are based on the paranormal investigators&#39; demon-hunting adventures and are the focus of The Conjuring franchise. Released in 2013, The Conjuring was a huge hit that spawned a lucrative franchise and numerous successful spinoffs. The film followed the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren, a portrayal of the real-life married couple who claimed to have intervened in numerous hauntings and exorcisms throughout their decades together. With The Conjuring: Last Rites on the way there&#39;s no better time to look back at all the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies — of which there have been dozens.




The third film in the Conjuring franchise, the less scary Conjuring 3: The Devil Made Me Do It, gave a look at the trial of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, who claimed demonic possession led him to murder. While the mega-successful Conjuring franchise may be the most lucrative iteration of the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies, the series was far from the first to adapt their stories for the screen. Before the Conjuring franchise began, there were numerous films based on cases that the duo was involved in that are far less famous.

              Related   The Conjuring Movies &amp; Spinoffs Ranked, Worst To Best   Since 2013&#39;s The Conjuring, James Wan&#39;s Conjurverse has expanded to 8 films, with 2 more and a series due - but what is the best Conjuring movie?    


 The Amityville Horror (1979) 
The First Of Dozens Of Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Movies About The Infamous Haunting
   Close     




  The Amityville Horror The Amityville Horror is the first film in the long-running horror franchise. In the original 1979 film, a family moves into a home where years prior, a brutal murder was committed. Quickly after moving in, they begin to experience supernatural events that take a toll on the father&#39;s sanity. James Brolin and Margot Kidder star as the newlyweds George and Kathy Lutz.  Release Date   July 27, 1979    Director   Stuart Rosenberg    Cast   Murray Hamilton , Margot Kidder , James Brolin , Don Stroud , Rod Steiger    Runtime   117 minutes       

Based on the supposed haunting of the Lutz family in Amityville, 1979&#39;s The Amityville Horror was the first of the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies and also the first of a whopping thirty Amityville Horror movies (and counting) to address the contentious real-life case. The Amityville Horror was a huge hit upon release despite some brutal reviews and is still fondly recalled as a classic of the haunted house genre despite feeling incredibly dated.

Interestingly, the Warrens aren’t mentioned in the movie at all and are replaced in the story by a string of priests and nuns brought in to relieve the house of its haunting. This may be because, as iconic horror author Stephen King wrote, this hit was actually as much about the financial woes of the family as their experiences with the supernatural, an idea that was expanded on more explicitly by later entries into the genre.




              Related   Amityville Horror: The True Story That Inspired The Movie   Was 1979&#39;s The Amityville Horror based on a true story? Here&#39;s the disturbing story that inspired the author and director when developing the tale.    



 The Haunted (1991) 
The First Movie To Feature The Warrens As Characters
          

One of the less well-known Ed and Lorraine Warren movies, 1991’s The Haunted fared fine in terms of reviews but has been largely forgotten in the decades since its initial release. The depicts the story of the Smurl family, who claim that they were haunted by a demon that caused all manner of horrifying incidents in their home. Notably, this was the first film to feature Ed and Lorraine Warren onscreen, here played by Marnie’s Diane Baker and Stephen Markle. Despite this, though, the outing is mostly a merely serviceable horror with little to distinguish the Smurls’ on-screen ordeal from that of the Warrens’ more famous clients.






 The Haunting In Connecticut (2009) 
A Forgettable And Innacurate Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Movie From The 2000s
          

The Haunting In Connecticut is one of the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies that didn&#39;t fare well with critics. The 2009 horror movie is purported to be based on the true story of Carmen Snedeker, whose home the Warrens proclaimed haunted after launching an investigation into reported paranormal occurrences on the property, a former mortuary. However, the author of the book on which The Haunting in Connecticut’s story is based later stated that he was told to sensationalize the story and embellish reality, and the movie further exaggerates his version of the case. So, what made it to screens was likely not particularly close to the Warrens’ investigations.



 The Conjuring (2013) 
The First Movie In The Hit Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Franchise
   Close     




  The Conjuring Based on the real-life case files of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring chronicles the haunting of the Perron family after moving into a Rhode Island farmhouse. The film went on to kickstart the Conjuring franchise, a series of supernatural horror films.  Release Date   July 19, 2013    Director   James Wan    Cast   Joey King , Vera Farmiga , Lili Taylor , Patrick Wilson , Ron Livingston    Runtime   112 minutes       

Based on another infamous Warren case, The Conjuring is notable for making the Warrens the focus of its story rather than the Lutz family. Directed by Saw horror franchise co-creator James Wan, this tight, tense, and terrifying horror won critical acclaim for its fictionalized account of the Perron family’s haunting in their Rhode Island home. Bolstered by some supremely effective scare sequences and a stellar central turn from the always-underrated Lili Taylor, The Conjuring was the first of the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies to make the pair its heroes and stars and remains the most positively received movie made about their adventures.

              Related   How The Conjuring Made Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Popular After 3 Movies Failed   After several failed movie attempts, The Conjuring was able to popularize Ed and Lorraine Warren&#39;s supernatural investigations - here&#39;s how.     






 The Conjuring 2 (2016) 
The Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Movie That Dives Into The Enfield Poltergeist
   Close     

  The Conjuring 2 The sequel to 2013&#39;s horror hit, The Conjuring 2 is a supernatural horror film that again follows Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators who travel to London to investigate the case of the Hodgson family. When one of the Hodgson&#39;s daughters becomes seemingly possessed after playing with an Ouija board, supernatural occurrences begin happening all over the home.   Release Date   June 10, 2016    Director   James Wan    Cast   Robin Atkin Downes , Vera Farmiga , Madison Wolfe , Patrick Wilson , Abhi Sinha , Simon McBurney , Maria Doyle Kennedy , Sterling Jerins , Frances O&#39;Connor    Runtime   134 minutes       

Released three years after the success of the original Conjuring, The Conjuring 2 story only added to the growing franchise. This louder, more action-packed horror story told the famous story of the Enfield poltergeist, a renowned British haunting that occurred in a family’s council house during the &#39;70s. Although imperfect, this installment to the Ed and Lorraine movies catalog was largely seen as a solid sequel and introduced the terrifying Conjuring franchise demon Valak. The real-life case of the Hodgson family was certainly exaggerated for the movie, although this sequel did at least feature an appearance from a skeptic calling the whole affair into question.






 The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (2021) 
The Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Courtroom Drama About Demonic Possession
          

  The Conjuring 3 The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It is based on another one of Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren&#39;s (Vera Farmiga) case files. This time, Ed and Lorraine investigate a murder suspect, Arne Cheyenne Johnson, who is claiming demonic possession made him kill. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do is the third film in the mainline series and the seventh overall movie in The Conjuring universe.   Release Date   June 4, 2021    Director   Michael Chaves    Cast   Sarah Catherine Hook , Ashley LeConte , Sterling Jerins , Ruairi O&#39;Connor , Shannon Kook , Andrea Andrade , Vera Farmiga , Eugenie Bondurant , Ingrid Bisu , Keith Arthur Bolden , Patrick Wilson , Julian Hilliard , John Noble , Steve Coulter , Ronnie Gene Blevins    Runtime   112 minutes       

Based on the real-life case of Arne Cheyenne Johnson, The Conjuring 3 brings the Warrens back to the screen in the form of a courtroom drama rather than their normal haunted house format. Here, the pair are attempting to establish a precedent for Johnson’s claim that demonic possession was responsible for the manslaughter he committed. The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It&#39;s less demon-focused approach is new ground for the couple in terms of genre, but this entry into the roster of Ed and Lorraine Warren movies is solid.






 Annabelle (2014) 
The Haunted Doll Is Based On A Real Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Case
          

  Annabelle The 2017 horror film Annabelle is a spinoff of James Wan&#39;s Conjuring universe. Starring Annabelle Wallis as Mia and Ward Horton and John, the plot centers on a couple who experiences supernatural events after having their house invaded by members of a satanic cult and bringing home an antique doll. The doll is possessed by a demonic spirit and begins to terrorize them and their newborn daughter.  Release Date   October 2, 2014    Director   John R. Leonetti    Cast   Annabelle Wallis , Alfre Woodard , Michelle Romano , Eric Ladin , Tony Amendola , Ward Horton    Runtime   99minutes       

Though the Annabelle sequels were fictional stories, the first was based on another real-life case that Ed and Lorraine Warren encountered, despite them not being in it. As with many Ed and Lorraine Warren movies, it takes some creative liberties; in real life, the haunted doll now in possession of the Warrens is actually a Raggedy Ann Doll, not an antique porcelain doll. It tells the story of two young nurses who were haunted by a doll possessed by the spirit of a little girl, but the Warrens were called in when things took a sinister turn, and it was determined a demonic spirit was attached to the doll.






 Annabelle Comes Home (2019) 
Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Acquire The Haunted Doll In The Sequel
          

  Annabelle Comes Home The third installment of the Conjuring spin-off franchise, Annabelle Comes Home brings back the possessed doll to terrorize a family once again. Determined to keep Annabelle from wreaking more havoc, demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren bring the possessed doll to the locked artifacts room in their home, placing her &#34;safety&#34; behind sacred glass and enlisting a priest&#39;s holy blessing. But an unholy night of horror awaits as Annabelle awakens the evil spirits in the room, which all set their sights on a new target - the Warren&#39;s ten-year-old daughter Judy and her babysitters.  Release Date   June 26, 2019    Director   Gary Dauberman    Cast   Patrick Wilson , Vera Farmiga , Mckenna Grace , Katie Sarife , Madison Iseman , Steve Coulter , Emily Brobst    Runtime   106 Minutes       

Both Ed and Lorraine Warren are in the sequel Annabelle Comes Home, and it marks the seventh installment of The Conjuring franchise. The story follows the couple as they take Annabelle back to their museum and lock the doll in her famed case. The Warrens invite babysitter Mary Ellen and charge her with babysitting their daughter Judy for a night while they go out on another case. Mary Ellen&#39;s friend Daniela comes over and lets Annabelle loose, causing a string of events in which other spirits begin to wreak havoc on the home while the Warrens are out.




Ghostbusters: Afterlife&#39;s McKenna Grace plays Judy, while Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga reprise their roles as Ed and Lorraine Warren. While the Annabelle case is based on a real doll, much of the narrative was made up for the movie. Interestingly, the scene where Ed drives the doll home and faces supernatural forces is a story that has been corroborated by the Warrens, though it was dramatized for the film. Annabelle Comes Home is dedicated to Lorraine, who passed away on April 18th, 2019. The 2017 prequel, Annabelle: Creation, didn&#39;t feature the Warrens despite being (loosely) based on the real-life Annabelle doll.



 Other Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Movies 
There Are Dozens Of Movies Inspired By Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Cases
          

There are other Ed and Lorraine Warren movies outside The Conjuring universe — including the Steven Spielberg classic Poltergeist. The parapsychologist, Dr. Lesh, who visits the home is rumored to be based on Lorraine Warren. Not only that but the entirety of the Amityville universe, which contains 30 films and counting in addition to The Amityville Horror, is based on the famous Warren case. The film The Nun and its sequel, The Nun 2, stars Vera Farmiga&#39;s sister, American Horror Story&#39;s Taissa Farmiga, and is based on cases built by Ed and Lorraine Warren.




In addition, the Spanish tale of The Curse of La Llorona makes no mention of the Warren couple, but it is based on the Mexican folklore of the Weeping Woman. All in all, there are plenty of horror movies both outside of and within The Conjuring universe that are based on the experiences of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and there will surely be more to come — they&#39;ve led a fascinating life.



 The Nun Is Connected To Several Ed And Lorraine Warren Movies 
The Warrens Don&#39;t Feature Heavily In The Conjuring Spinoff But Are Still Important
   Close     

The Nun is a spinoff movie set within the events of The Conjuring movie universe. Like some of the other spinoffs and sequels to the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies, the Warrens don’t feature in The Nun. The Nun does center on a demon that they discover in an earlier movie though: Valak. Valak is the real main antagonist in The Conjuring, and the demon takes many forms in the different movies. Both the Crooked Man and the Nun are versions of Valak.




It’s the latter that appears in both The Nun and its sequel. Valak is first mentioned in The Conjuring, becoming a full-blown antagonist in The Conjuring 2. The Nun, however, is set before the events of those movies, giving fans of the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies an idea of what Valak was up to before crossing paths with the Warrens. Valak, sealed in a rift below an abbey in Romania, emerges when bombs during World War II reopen that seal. It takes the form of a nun so it can torment those who reside there until Sister Irene believes she seals it away again.

Valak even has cameos in the Annabelle movies that spin out of the Conjuring universe. In Annabelle: Creation Valak appears in a photograph from the abbey in Romania. Footage of Valak being exorcised from the character Maurice, who appears at the end of The Nun, also appears in Annabelle Comes Home. Valak’s connections to so many other Ed and Lorraine Warren movies make it clear that the demonic entity is a major threat in the Conjuring universe.




              Related   The Nun 2&#39;s Post-Credits Scene Explained: What Conjuring Movie It Sets Up   The Conjuring Universe expands again with The Nun 2, and there is a post-credits scene setting up the franchise&#39;s future with major characters.    



 What Warren Case Will The Conjuring: Last Rites Be Based On? 
The Next Ed &amp; Lorraine Warren Movie Is A Mystery
          

The Conjuring franchise is going to continue with The Conjuring: Last Rites. Speculation is running rampant as to what Warren case The Conjuring: Last Rites will cover. While the Smurl haunting was chronicled in the 1991&#39;s The Haunted, it&#39;s one of the biggest contenders to make it to the big screen. The Smurl haunting is one of Ed and Lorraine Warren&#39;s largest cases, with patriarch Jack Smurl even claiming that he was sexually assaulted by one of the spirits in his home. Lorraine believed that the Smurl house was infested with four spirits, including a demon which used the other three to attack the family.




If studios want to go a similar route as The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, the next installment could cover the Donovan family. This family experienced blood running from their faucets and unidentifiable animal noises in their home, only for the Warrens to find out that the Donovan&#39;s daughter had been experimenting with an Ouija board. Of course, there is also a Conjuring TV series in development for Max. There are no details available about the series either, which could feature one of the Warren&#39;s most famous stories as well. Either way, fans of The Conjuring should be pleased to know that Ed and Lorraine&#39;s stories aren&#39;t finished yet.
