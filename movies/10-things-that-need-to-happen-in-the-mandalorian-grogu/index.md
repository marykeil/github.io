## Literature Review

If The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is going to be a true continuation of Din Djarin and Din Grogu&#39;s story, it absolutely must do these 10 things.




These 10 things must happen in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu for it to properly continue The Mandalorian&#39;s storyline. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be a continuation of Din Djarin and Din Grogu&#39;s story after the TV show&#39;s most recent events. As such, there are a few things it must do to properly tie into the show.
While official plot details have not been released for The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, the movie will likely focus on Din Djarin and Din Grogu&#39;s fight against the Imperial Remnant. After all, the most recent season of The Mandalorian saw the two commit to hunting down the last scraps of the Empire for the New Republic. This is an exciting prospect. However, the movie shouldn&#39;t only focus on their fight against the Imperial Remnant. Some other important characters and themes should show up in the movie as well if it is to truly be a continuation of the show&#39;s storyline.
            
 
 How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order 
Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.












 








 10  Grogu Must Continue To Explore His Connection To The Force 
The Force is an important part of Grogu&#39;s identity and past
        

In The Mandalorian season 3, Grogu used his Force abilities at his father&#39;s behest when sparring with the other Mandalorian children. This was a touching moment because it showed his father acknowledging his heritage. While Grogu chose Din Djarin over the Jedi, his time as a youngling and connection to the Force is still an important part of his identity. He probably doesn&#39;t have any memories before the Jedi. Grogu surviived Order 66 and was on the run for years, protected by a group of mercenaries. Continuing to explore his connection to the Force will allow him to honor and acknowledge his previous life.
Grogu should continue to explore his connection to the Force, not only because it is an important part of his identity, but also because he needs the advantage. He is tiny. He can&#39;t walk as quickly or easily as other Mandalorians - or the Imperials he and his father will be hunting. He is also not very physically strong and, unless the Armorer can make him a specialized jetpack, he is too small to use one. He isn&#39;t going to be able to defend himself without the Force. Therefore, his connection to the Force is absolutely essential for his survival.
            
 
 Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie 
The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.








 9  Din Djarin Must Continue To Teach Din Grogu About The Way 
The Way is an important part of Grogu&#39;s adopted heritage


 







The Way of the Mand&#39;alor is at the heart of Din Djarin&#39;s character. It is more than a religion to him. It is the creed by which he lives, which is why &#34;this is the Way&#34; has become such a staple phrase throughout the show. As such, Din Djarin must continue to teach his adopted son about his belief system and heritage.





 8  The Mandalorians Must Make An Appearance 
Found family is an important meta-theme of The Mandalorian
        

When Din Djarin was first introduced, he had very little family. Other than his small covert - who he did not seem to spend that much time with - he had no one. He was often alone and distant from people. Throughout the show, he gains a family. He adopts a son and helps to unite all Mandalorians. He fights with the people who took him in as their own to reclaim their homeworld. This is an important part of the show, and it should continue in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. For this theme to be included properly, the Mandalorians must make an appearance.





 7  Bo-Katan Must Appear As The Mand&#39;alor 
Bo-Katan has become an essential figurehead for Din Djarin&#39;s religion


 







The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be a continuation of season 3, so important plot points from the most recent season of The Mandalorian should appear. The Mandalorian season 3 set up the Mandalorian prophecy and the Mythosaur as important plot points. As such, they should play a role in the upcoming movie. Since Bo-Katan Kryze has been declared the Mand&#39;alor, she is essential to that role. Further, as the leader of the Mandalorians, Bo-Katan is also a significant part of the theme of found family. It would be interesting to see her ride the Mythosaur in a battle against the Imperial remnant if they decide Mandalore is worth pursuing again.
            
 
 The Mandalorian&#39;s Prophecy Is The Key To Star Wars&#39; Future 
The Mandalorian&#39;s prophecy of the Mand&#39;alor has massive implications for the future of Star Wars, and it could impact The Mandalorian movie.








 6  Grogu Should Learn To Talk 
As a Mandalorian apprentice, Grogu should start to mature
        

Since Grogu is a Mandalorian apprentice now, he should start talking. When Din Djarin requested to take Grogu on as his apprentice, the Armorer pointed out that Grogu&#39;s inability to speak meant that he was too young to take the Creed. While he was still able to take Grogu on because he adopted him, the Armorer has a point. Grogu is essentially a toddler. While he has been in battle before, being a full apprentice is more dangerous as he will be trained to fight by engaging in combat alongside his father. As such, Grogu should mature to fit this new role, and part of that is learning to talk.





 5  Din Djarin And Din Grogu Must Continue To Build Their Father-Son Bond 
The familial bond between Din Djarin and Din Grogu is essential to their characters
        

When Din Djarin adopted Din Grogu as his son, per the Way, it marked a milestone in their relationship. While Din Djarin had already been acting as a pseudo-father figure to Grogu, this official acknowledgment of their relationship was a big step for both characters. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu should continue to explore this.





 4  Din Djarin&#39;s Face Must Be Seen Once Again 
It&#39;s been too long since audiences last saw Din Djarin&#39;s face
        

Din Djarin&#39;s face hasn&#39;t been shown since the end of The Mandalorian season 2. Seeing other people&#39;s faces is important for emotional connection. As such, that is too long to go without seeing the main character&#39;s face. While the movie shouldn&#39;t undo Din Djarin&#39;s redemption arc, it is possible to show his face without making him an apostate again. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu could have him remove his helmet in a scene where he is alone. This would allow the audience to see his face without undoing important character development.





 3  The Imperial Remnant Must Pose A Big Enough Threat 
For the story to be interesting, there must be high stakes


 







It is not interesting or compelling if there is no risk to the heroes. While the fact that stormtroopers can&#39;t aim has become a funny joke, there are only so many times that a franchise can get away with making a joke like that before it starts to feel like having any villains at all is pointless. If the Imperial Remnant is composed of a bunch of incompetent buffoons, the movie will have no stakes. Without stakes, the narrative would feel boring and pointless. Therefore, if The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is to be a successful movie, the Imperial Remnant must pose a legitimate threat.





 2  Grand Admiral Thrawn Must Be Teased 
The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will likely lead up to the culmination movie
        

Since The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be a continuation of The Mandalorian season 3, it will likely lead into Dave Filoni&#39;s New Republic era culmination movie. That movie will feature Grand Admiral Thrawn as the big bad. As such, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu should tease Thrawn&#39;s appearance to maintain continuity - and that&#39;s assuming he doesn&#39;t appear outright.





 1  The Story Must Stay Focused On Din Djarin &amp; Grogu 
The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu shouldn&#39;t repeat The Book Of Boba Fett&#39;s mistake
        

The end of The Book Of Boba Fett essentially turned into The Mandalorian season 2.5, with Din Djarin and Grogu taking the spotlight away from who was supposed to be the main character. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu shouldn&#39;t make this same mistake. This particular movie isn&#39;t meant for crossovers, so it should keep the focus on its title characters.
The Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney&#43;.
