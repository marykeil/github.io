## Literature Review

From Prom Night to Barbarian to Carrie, there are a number of lethal horror movie villains whose final moments proved surprisingly sympathetic.




While horror movie villains aren’t exactly known for being likable, some of the genre’s best antagonist death scenes manage to make their monsters surprisingly sympathetic. Horror villains are usually a terrifying bunch, but there are plenty of monsters who garner sympathy from viewers. As far back as Frankenstein, the horror genre has been filled with figures who fall somewhere between reluctant villains and tragic antiheroes. For every remorseless, sadistic monster like Freddy Krueger, there are more morally ambiguous, complicated anti-villains like the eponymous Candyman. Some of these villains even become more popular than the ostensible heroes of their respective movies.
Furthermore, some horror victims are worse than the villains who dispatched them, and these unsympathetic characters can make antagonists look better by comparison. However, not all horror villains can charm viewers from the moment they first appear onscreen. Some horror movie monsters don’t seem sympathetic until the finale when they shuffle off their mortal coil, at which point the audience can’t help but feel bad for them despite their crimes. Whether they are satanic babysitters, alien parasites, or a tragically misguided maternal figure, all of the monsters here had an unlikely moment of redeeming sweetness before they were snuffed out for good.
            
 
 10 Horror Movie Moments That Never Happened (But You Swear You Remember) 
Many popular horror moments have been distorted in collective memory, and the truth is that they either happened differently or didn&#39;t happen at all.












 








 10  Bee — The Babysitter 
The Babysitter’s titular villain has a moving final moment with her would-be victim


 







  The Babysitter  


  Release Date    October 13, 2017     Cast    Robbie Amell , Hana Mae Lee , Bella Thorne , Judah Lewis , Samara Weaving , Andrew Bachelor     Genres    Horror     Director    McG     Rating    TV-MA     Runtime    85minutes     Writers    Brian Duffield     Distributor(s)    Netflix    


2017’s The Babysitter sees the young Cole go up against his demonic babysitter, but it is tough to hate Samara Weaving’s charming Bee. She’s friendly, stands up for Cole, and seems to be a lot of fun if it weren’t for the bloody sacrifices. A rare horror movie villain defeated by a child, Bee has her most redemptive moment when she earnestly congratulates Cole on beating her. The character is so likable that 2020’s sequel, The Babysitter 2: Killer Queen, even brought her back as a dark antihero.





 9  Steve Hadley — Cabin In The Woods 
The minor Cabin in the Woods villain just wanted to see a mermaid
        

  The Cabin in the Woods  


  Release Date    April 13, 2012     Cast    Richard Jenkins , Fran Kranz , Chris Hemsworth , Bradley Whitford , Kristen Connolly     Genres    Horror , Comedy     Director    Drew Goddard     Rating    R     Runtime    95 minutes     Writers    Drew Goddard , Joss Whedon     Budget    $30 million     Studio(s)    Lionsgate    


It is hard to hate Steve Hadley in Cabin in the Woods, even if Bradley Whitford’s technician is technically responsible for engineering the gruesome deaths of numerous college students. After all, Hadley and his colleagues are only staging horrific killing sprees to appease Lovecraftian elder gods and avoid the apocalypse. Of course, none of this matters when their facility’s zoo full of monsters is unleashed, and Steve suffers an ironic death, finally coming face to face with the mermaid that he always wanted to see in person.





 8  Marybeth — The Faculty 
This alien parasite’s killer could relate to her pain
        

  The Faculty  


  Release Date    December 25, 1998     Cast    Clea DuVall , Josh Hartnett , Jordana Brewster , Laura Harris , Elijah Wood     Genres     Sci-Fi , Horror     Director    Robert Rodriguez     Rating    R     Runtime    104 minutes     Writers    Kevin Williamson     Budget    $15 million     Studio(s)    MiraMax    


While the villains of Cabin in the Woods are trying to avoid the end of the world (albeit by killing innocent people), the villain of 1998’s sci-fi horror The Faculty wants to bring about the end of civilization. Specifically, the alien parasite that takes the form of naive high school girl Marybeth wants to assimilate the faculty and student body, so she can find a new home. When Elijah Woods’ nebbish hero Casey stabs her in the eye with a caffeine-filled pen, dehydrating and killing the alien, he wistfully tells her she wouldn’t have liked the school anyway.





 7  Brundlefly — The Fly 
Jeff Goldblum’s tragic monster didn’t deserve his horrific demise


 







  The Fly  


  Release Date    August 15, 1986     Cast    Jeff Goldblum , John Getz , Geena Davis     Genres    Horror ,  Sci-Fi , Drama     Director    David Cronenberg     Rating    R     Runtime    96 minutes     Writers    Charles Edward Pogue , David Cronenberg     Budget    $15 million     Studio(s)    20th Century     Franchise(s)    The Fly    


While Seth Brundle is always arrogant, the scientist doesn’t deserve to become the thoughtless monster that he is by the end of The Fly. The tragedy of Cronenberg’s nightmarish body horror springs from the fact that Brundle’s mind gradually merges with the housefly with whom he has fused his DNA. This makes him an instinct-driven, uncaring monster, but there are still flashes of Brundle’s humanity straight through to The Fly&#39;s bitter end. By the time his love interest is forced to kill him, it’s impossible not to feel for the guy.





 6  The Newborn — Alien: Resurrection 
Ripley killing the Newborn Xenomorph was sadder than anticipated
        

  Alien Resurrection  


  Release Date    November 12, 1997     Cast    Sigourney Weaver , Winona Ryder , Dominique Pinon , Ron Perlman , Gary Dourdan , Michael Wincott     Genres    Action , Horror , Sci-Fi , Thriller     Director    Jean-Pierre Jeunet     Rating    pg-13     Runtime    109minutes     Budget    $70 million     Studio(s)    20th Century     Franchise(s)    Alien 3    


The Newborn Alien from Alien: Resurrection is an infamously un-scary movie monster thanks to its lumbering creature design and bizarre appearance. However, it does rack up a pretty impressive body count during the sequel’s action, and for most of the movie, franchise heroine Ellen Ripley is more than ready to take down the latest Xenomorph that is making her life Hell. However, Ripley’s anguish over killing the Newborn is still tough to watch when she finally has to do the deed and put the creepy creature out of its misery.
Alien: Resurrection is available to stream on Disney&#43; 






 5  The Mother — Barbarian 
Barbarian’s monster straddles the line between hero and villain
        

  Barbarian  


  Release Date    September 9, 2022     Cast    Bill Skarsgard , Georgina Campbell , Justin Long , Richard Brake , Kurt Braunohler , Matthew Patrick Davis     Genres    Horror , Thriller     Director    Zach Cregger     Rating    R     Runtime    102 minutes     Writers    Zach Cregger     Budget    $4–4.5 million     Studio(s)    20th Century , Disney    


Barbarian’s real villains are Justin Long’s AJ and the monstrous figure who lives alone in the house’s basement, but the movie’s most dangerous character is The Mother. A lanky monster with superhuman strength, the Mother desperately attempts to trap people in her squalid subterranean home so she can care for them in her own twisted way. When she rips Long’s villain in half for trying to sacrifice the movie’s heroine, Tess, she almost becomes an outright heroic figure. As such, it is devastating but understandable when Tess shoots The Mother in the head afterward.
Barbarian is available to stream on Hulu and MAX. 






 4  Carrie White — Carrie 
It is hard not to root for Stephen King’s psychic teen
        

1976’s Carrie sees the title character relentlessly bullied by brutally cruel teens until she eventually gets bloody revenge on prom night. Admittedly, Carrie does accidentally kill a lot of innocent people in the ensuing melee. However, when she uses her final moments to finally defeat her abusive, hypocritical mother, it is tough to view Carrie as anything other than a misunderstood heroine.





 3  Alex Hammond — Prom Night 
Prom Night’s slasher killer is arguably almost justified in his murder spree
        

  Prom Night  


  Release Date    July 18, 1980     Cast    Jamie Lee Curtis , Leslie Nielsen , Casey Stevens , Eddie Benton , Michael Tough     Genres    Horror , Thriller     Director    Paul Lynch     Rating    R     Runtime    93 Minutes     Writers    William Gray     Studio(s)    Simcom Productions , Prom Night Productions    


Although 2008’s Prom Night remake turns its killer into an unambiguous monster, the villain of the original movie is arguably justified in his actions. After witnessing a group of children kill his sister when he was a boy, Alex Hammond grows up to become a serial killer who stalks and murders the killers who evaded justice years earlier. He dies in his sister&#39;s arms after explaining his motives, shot by the police as he attempted to attack his final victim.





 2  Jennifer Check — Jennifer&#39;s Body 
Megan Fox’s moving depiction of Jennifer is memorably tragic


 







  Jennifer&#39;s Body  


  Release Date    September 18, 2009     Cast    Megan Fox , Adam Brody​ , J. K. Simmons , Johnny Simmons , Amanda Seyfried     Genres    Horror , Comedy     Director    Karyn Kusama     Rating    R     Runtime    102 minutes     Writers    Diablo Cody     Budget    $16 million     Studio(s)    20th Century    


The advertising of Jennifer’s Body makes the movie’s monster out to be a remorseless man-eater, but the dark horror drama actually depicts Megan Fox’s troubled teenager as a conflicted, tragic figure. Jennifer is turned into a demon after she&#39;s sacrificed by a fame-hungry band, and for all of her flaws, Jennifer isn’t really responsible for the insatiable hunger of her demonic form. A great horror movie with a bad Rotten Tomatoes score, Jennifer’s Body was profoundly misunderstood by viewers and critics all too ready to dismiss its villain as a one-dimensional monster when it was first released.





 1  David Kessler — An American Werewolf in London 
The eponymous monster is an ordinary guy who never meant any harm
        

  An American Werewolf In London  


  Release Date    August 21, 1981     Cast    David Naughton , Jenny Agutter , Griffin Dunne , John Woodvine , Lila Kaye , Joe Belcher     Genres    Horror , Comedy     Director    John Landis     Rating    R     Runtime    97 minutes     Writers    John Landis     Budget    $10 million     Studio(s)    Universal Pictures    


If Jennifer’s fate is brutal, David Kessler’s tale in An American Werewolf in London is arguably the horror genre’s most tragic story. Kessler is both the hero and the villain of John Landis’s seminal horror comedy as he slowly succumbs to lycanthropy after a brutal attack leaves him maimed and his friend dead. When Kessler realizes he is a werewolf, it is too late for him to save himself, and he ends up dying in the arms of his love interest, a moving fate that could make even the most hardened horror viewer feel for the misunderstood villain.
