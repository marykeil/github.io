## Literature Review

Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s 45-year-old classic war movie, considered one of the greatest films ever made, fails to impress an expert with its accuracy.




Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s Apocalypse Now fails to impress an expert with its historical accuracy. Released in 1979, the film follows an Army captain (Martin Sheen) who is secretly sent to sail upriver to find and kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has gone rogue during the Vietnam War, with its ensemble cast also including Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, and Harrison Ford. Apocalypse Now is one of the best war movies of all time, though its historical accuracy, on the other hand, is up for debate.




In a video from Insider, military history professor Bill Allison assessed Vietnam War movies, including Apocalypse Now, for their historical accuracy.


 

The Vietnam War historian broke down the use of helicopters in Apocalypse Now, which is &#34;pretty accurate,&#34; and napalm, though he seemed to take issue with the scene&#39;s iconic use of &#34;Ride of the Valkyries.&#34; Allison admits that Apocalypse Now, &#34;as a piece of film,&#34; is a perfect 10, but in terms of its realism, is only a 5/10. Read a portion of his commentary below:


All that&#39;s pretty accurate. The helicopters themselves are the UH-1 Hueys, as well as the helicopter in the scene, the smaller helicopter, that&#39;s a Loach. That&#39;s actually Filipino pilots. They borrowed those helicopters from the Filipino Army to use for this scene.
Now, you might wonder why they&#39;re attacking this village. It&#39;s supposedly a VC stronghold. VC, the Viet Cong. Why do they have to get it over this village into the river? Why can&#39;t they just go up the coast? If you&#39;ve not seen the film, there&#39;s a river patrol boat they need to get on the Nung River. Problem there is, the tidal flow is not deep enough for the boat to actually get across the sandbars, and that actually is real. That&#39;s a problem. Playing &#34;Valkyries&#34; just kind of blew your mind, right? Is that real? Probably less so.
Napalm does smell. Obviously, with everything that&#39;s in it, it&#39;s going to have a very gasoline-y, petroleum-like smell. So it has a very distinct odor to it, for sure. Now, there&#39;s Robert Duvall as Col. Kilgore, probably one of the most iconic characters in any Vietnam film. He is based on a guy, in part by a guy, named John Stockton, who was the commander of the unit that&#39;s depicted here, the 9th Cav of the 1st Cavalry Division.
As far as it being a piece of film, I&#39;d give it a 10. Right? In reality, eh, you know, it&#39;s a little ludicrous on a lot of levels. So I&#39;m guessing probably about a five.





                  10 War Movies That Were Criticized By Military Experts   Whether they are based on real-life events or are fully fictional, many war movies have been criticized by military experts for a variety of reasons.   


 Apocalypse Now&#39;s Historical Accuracy Isn&#39;t Its Strong Suit 
It&#39;s Acclaimed For Its Artistic Achievements
         

Apocalypse Now is not only considered one of the greatest war movies ever made, but one of the greatest films of all time. This isn&#39;t because it captures the Vietnam War with meticulous historical accuracy, but because of how it explores the psychological and moral challenges of war. Apocalypse Now is based on Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad&#39;s 1899 novella, but changes the setting from 19th-century Congo to the Vietnam War. In turn, by following Captain Willlard&#39;s increasingly hallucinatory journey, Apocalypse Now&#39;s portrayal of the Vietnam War is often surreal and symbolic, and its characters and events are often fictionalized.




Even Allison admits that the fictionalized Colonel Kilgore (played by Duvall) is &#34;probably one of the most iconic characters in any Vietnam film.&#34; In place of precise historical accuracy, Apocalypse Now brilliantly depicts the chaos, brutality, and moral ambiguity of the Vietnam War. Furthermore, Coppola&#39;s direction, Duvall&#39;s performance, and Vittorio Storaro&#39;s cinematography are widely acclaimed, which resulted in eight Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Duvall, and a win for Best Cinematography. All in all, Apocalypse Now is acclaimed for its artistic achievements rather than its strict adherence to historical accuracy.



 Francis Ford Coppola Once Co-Wrote A More Historically Accurate War Movie 
And It Even Won Him His First Oscar
          

Coppola co-wrote, but did not direct, the 1970 film Patton, which provides a much more historically accurate portrayal of its events than Apocalypse Now. The film follows the career of the controversial General George S. Patton during World War II, providing a glimpse into his personality and leadership style. While co-writing the film, Coppola consulted historical sources and aimed to capture the essence of Patton&#39;s life. The result, with a perfect performance from George C. Scott, was a sympathetic and unflinching portrayal of the titular general.






Similar to some scenes in Apocalypse Now, the opening monologue in Patton, delivered in front of an enormous American flag, is iconic and often quoted.




As a biopic based on the book Patton: Ordeal and Triumph by historian Ladislas Farago, Patton provides a much more straightforward portrayal of its characters and events. Apocalypse Now, on the other hand, takes a more abstract and allegorical approach, using the Vietnam War as a backdrop to explore broader themes. However, like Apocalypse Now, Patton still ranks as a resounding artistic achievement in Coppola&#39;s filmography, earning him the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay as part of the film&#39;s seven Academy Award victories, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Scott.
