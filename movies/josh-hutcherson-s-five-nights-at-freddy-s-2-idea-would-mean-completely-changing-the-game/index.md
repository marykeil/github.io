## Literature Review

Five Nights at Freddy’s star Josh Hutcherson has an idea for the franchise’s sequel, but if it’s done, it could totally change the course of the game.




The star of the 2023 Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, Josh Hutcherson, recently revealed what he hopes Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 will delve into, however, if his idea does happen, it will completely change the plot of the original video game. Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s is a horror video game franchise that first premiered in 2014 and has since gone on to spawn various games and a feature film. The story follows a set of haunted animatronics that inhabit an abandoned pizzeria called Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizzeria. While the games include many layers of lore, the main goal is for Freddy&#39;s night security guard to survive five ghostly nights.




Since the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 movie was confirmed, there has been speculation about what the film will be about. When asked his thoughts, Mike Schmidt actor Josh Hutcherson told Screen Rant, &#34;We kind of tap into the world a bit with him playing with the dream world and reality, so I have a feeling that he’s going to dive deeper into that to get some more answers about his brother’s disappearance.&#34; Although this seems like a strong guess, it is also raises a serious problem. Following Mike Schmidt in the second film means completely changing the story of Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2.


 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s Already Took Dream Theory Further Than The Games 
          

First and foremost, the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie already changed the plot of the very first video game. This happened in many ways, but one particular aspect was Mike&#39;s dream theory. Although dream theory did appear somewhat in the original Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s game, it went even further in the movie. Namely, Mike uses dream theory to purposely fall asleep and dream about his brother&#39;s disappearance so that he might figure out what happened. Furthermore, the ghost children that haunt Freddy&#39;s used Mike&#39;s dreams to communicate with him.




Frankly, expanding on Mike and his dreams was somewhat necessary in order to make the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie, as audiences need a strong main character and plot to pull them in. However, on the flip side, this puts the original plot of the games in jeopardy. When it comes to Mike and dream theory, this is an expanded story that will not just affect the first movie, but inevitably, the sequel as well. This is because Mike never actually finds out what happened to his brother and the franchise cannot leave audiences hanging.



 Five Nights At Freddy&#39;s 2 Exploring Mike&#39;s Dream Abilities Loses More Of The Game 
          

But even then, diving back into Mike and his dream abilities takes away from the plot of the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 video game. In fact, the game does not even include Mike, and instead, has the player assume the role of Jeremy Fitzgerald, a new night security guard. Ultimately, this leaves Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 in a tough spot. The film must wrap up Mike&#39;s plot, but fans will likely be disappointed if the movie does not hark back to the video game. Though nothing has been confirmed yet, Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s 2 plot will likely be a hot topic for fans and non-fans alike.
