## Literature Review

Denis Villeneuve&#39;s passion for the Bene Gesserit heavily influenced Dune 2 and could lay a solid foundation for a successful Dune spinoff series.




Director Denis Villeneuve&#39;s biggest narrative change in Dune: Part Two explains the franchise&#39;s interesting future plans for a Dune spinoff. Despite the release of the highly-anticipated Dune 2 being pushed back from October 20, 2023, to March 15, 2024, expectations are still exceptionally high for Villeneuve&#39;s follow-up to the 2021 sci-fi epic starring Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, and Zendaya. Dune fans can also look forward to an upcoming prequel spinoff series that some consider an unusual but nonetheless gripping direction for the modern Dune franchise.




The previously announced MAX spinoff series Dune: The Sisterhood was supposed to be directed by Villeneuve himself and has gone through a series of hires and rehires of both actors and directors throughout a tumultuous 2023. Anna Foerster (Outlander, Westworld) is currently slated as the director of the pilot of the series. While the Dune prequel spinoff show was somewhat of an odd choice to expand the Dune franchise, Villeneuve&#39;s Dune 2 comments indicate that the project moved forward because of his personal appreciation for the Bene Gesserit while making his Dune films.

 Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Interest In The Bene Gesserit Explains Sisterhood Prequel Show 
          

Villeneuve himself has a specialized interest in the Bene Gesserit, referring to the characters in the novel as one of the most alluring and rich parts of the entire story. The acclaimed director previously said &#34;My version of Dune is different because the thing that really seduced me about the book was the Bene Gesserit. My adaptation is more oriented toward their impact – they are the puppet masters of the universe!&#34; Villeneuve also commented on the mesmerizing new member of the Bene Gesserit in Dune 2 Lady Fenring, who is played by Léa Seydoux (No Time To Die, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol).




The impact of the Bene Gesserit in Dune 2 makes the resultant spinoff series make sense, especially since Villeneuve was supposed to direct it as of 2019. Based on Villeneuve&#39;s passionate draw for the Bene Gesserit, his adaptation of Dune is set to offer more attention to the mysterious group of &#34;puppet masters of the universe&#34; than Lynch&#39;s 1984 rendition. Villeneuve&#39;s heightened emphasis on the Bene Gesserit in his upcoming film could pave the way for Dune: The Sisterhood&#39;s success.



 Dune 2&#39;s Bigger Bene Gesserit Role Could Be Crucial To The Prequel&#39;s Success 
          

If Villeneuve can effectively seduce audiences with the Bene Gesserit the same way that he was affected, then there will certainly be much more excitement for the prequel series than ever before. The combined star power of Ferguson and Seydoux in Dune: Part Two will inevitably lay the foundation for the Bene Gesserit and Dune: The Sisterhood, which is set to have Emily Watson (Chernobyl) and Olivia Williams (The Crown) star alongside Jodhi May (The Witcher). Villeneuve&#39;s comments have certainly generated excitement around the Bene Gesserit in both Dune: Part Two and its eventual spinoff series.
