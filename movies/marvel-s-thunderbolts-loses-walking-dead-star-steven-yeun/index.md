Summary

  Steven Yeun is leaving the Thunderbolts movie, causing some cast changes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   Marvel Studios and Yeun have not released an official statement about this.   There are no updates on who will replace Yeun as Sentry.  





The Thunderbolts movie undergoes a major casting change as Steven Yeun exits the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The former Walking Dead actor was reportedly playing Sentry, one of the most powerful Marvel Comics characters. With Sentry essentially being the MCU&#39;s response to Superman, Thunderbolts was staging a massive challenge for the members of the titular team.




While the Thunderbolts movie has yet to start filming, Marvel Studios is facing its latest cast shake-up. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Yeun is exiting Thunderbolts. At the time of this story&#39;s publication, Yeun and Marvel Studios have yet to make an official statement on his departure.


 Will Sentry Still Be In Thunderbolts? 
         

The bigger question that remains unanswered at the moment is whether Thunderbolts intends to recast the Sentry role, or if the creative team will replace the character altogether. If Sentry is meant to be the central antagonist to the Thunderbolts team, Marvel Studios is obviously going to tap another actor, and likely as soon as possible. However, if casting takes longer than expected, principal photography on Thunderbolts will get pushed back even further.




The news of Yeun stepping away from Thunderbolts came only a few months after Robert Kirkman accidentally let slip that he was playing Sentry. They had even gotten to the point where they were costume-fitting for Yeun. This is now the latest big recasting announcement following Jonathan Majors officially being fired from his role as Kang the Conqueror.



Thunderbolts was one of many MCU movies that got delayed due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.




Time will tell if there were specific reasons for why Yeun is parting ways with Marvel Studios, though the filming delays caused by the 2023 Hollywood strikes could be a likely culprit. Given how massive Sentry is as a Marvel character, whoever they tap to replace him will possibly get to play the character for a number of movies and TV shows. Hopefully, Marvel Studios will address the Sentry situation sooner rather than later as Thunderbolts gets ready to start filming this year.
