# Disney Caps Off Disappointing 2023 By Losing Top Spot At Global Box Office


## SUMMARY 



  Disney lost its reign as the top-grossing studio at the 2023 box office to Universal due to a string of underperforming films.   Universal&#39;s success was largely attributed to surprise hits like Oppenheimer and franchises like The Super Mario Bros. Movie.   Disney&#39;s disappointing year was marked by underperforming sequels and remakes, leading to the studio&#39;s loss in the box office race.

## Literature Review

Disney caps off a disappointing 2023 by being dethroned as the highest-grossing studio at the global box office for the first time since 2015.




Disney caps off a disappointing 2023 by losing the top spot at the global box office. For the past decade, Disney has dominated the box office with the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the height of its popularity, the release of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, and animated movies becoming big office successes. However, in 2023, Disney started to struggle at the box office with most of the studio&#39;s major releases, including multiple MCU movies, falling well short of expectations.




As a result, Universal dethroned Disney as the highest-grossing studio at the global 2023 box office. Disney&#39;s slate – which includes Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, and The Little Mermaid – grossed $4.8 billion globally. Universal&#39;s slate, with Oppenheimer&#39;s box office and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, grossed $4.9 billion. According to Variety, this marks the first time since 2015 that Disney didn&#39;t take the top spot.

                  Mario’s Success Isn’t Surprising - Disney Hasn&#39;t Beaten Universal Since 2019   Even Disney hasn&#39;t beaten Universal&#39;s animated movies at the box office since 2019, so Super Mario Bros&#39; record-breaking success isn&#39;t shocking.   


 How Universal Dethroned Disney At The 2023 Box Office 
          

Though the studio released seven fewer films than Universal, Disney&#39;s dethroning is largely attributed to its series of underperforming sequels and the success of original movies. At the 2023 box office, Disney was shut out of the top three spots, which belonged to Warner Bros.&#39; Barbie movie ($1.4 billion) and Universal&#39;s Oppenheimer ($950 million) and Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.3 billion). Universal also had the fifth-biggest movie of the year, Fast X ($704 million), and two of the biggest horror movies of the year, Five Nights at Freddy’s ($295 million) and M3GAN ($181 million).




Disney, on the other hand, saw the MCU movies Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania ($476 million) and The Marvels ($205 million) both disappoint at the box office. Additionally, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny ($384 million) was a box office bomb, The Little Mermaid ($569 million) underperformed considering its big budget, and the studio&#39;s centennial film Wish ($176 million) also flopped. Disney remains a powerhouse, though its disappointing 2023 has resulted in the studio ceding its box office supremacy to Universal.
