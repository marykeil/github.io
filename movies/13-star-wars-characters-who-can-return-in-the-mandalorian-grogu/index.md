## Literature Review

Star Wars announced that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie will go into production later this year, but what other Star Wars characters might appear?




Star Wars has just announced that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will begin production later this year, and it raises the question of which characters will return for the next installment of Din Djarin&#39;s and Grogu’s story. The Mandalorian season 3 ended with Din Djarin officially adopting Grogu as his son and becoming a Mandalorian apprentice. It’s not entirely clear where the movie&#39;s director, Jon Favreau, will take the story, but more details will likely be coming out in the coming weeks and months. It also seems that The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be taking the place of The Mandalorian season 4, though this has not yet been confirmed.
With The Mandalorian having three seasons worth of history, plus an appearance in The Book of Boba Fett, there are any number of characters audiences can expect to see. Most obviously, Din Djarin and Grogu will be returning, but beyond that, the cast largely remains up in the air. Hopefully, Favreau will be bringing back some of The Mandalorian’s best supporting cast to make this theatrical release closely tied to the Disney&#43; TV show. Here are some Star Wars characters audiences may see in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.
            
 
 Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie 
The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.












 








 13  Greef Karga 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 8
        

Greef Karga has been integral in Din Djarin’s story up to this point. Not only did he employ Din Djarin while he was a bounty hunter, but he also acted as a good friend. Carl Weathers became more active behind the scenes as well, directing episodes of The Mandalorian in the last two seasons, so it’ll be sad if the High Magistrate of Nevarro is absent from The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Especially since Din and Grogu now officially call Nevarro home, it’s likely Karga will at least make an appearance in the upcoming movie.





 12  Bo-Katan Kryze 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 8
        

First introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars as a member of the Mandalorian Death Watch, The Mandalorian not only brought Bo-Katan Kyrze to live-action, but it also showed her coming into her own as a leader truly meant to unite her people. Her friendship and trust with Din Djarin was one of the highlights of The Mandalorian season 3, and it’s hard to see The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu not feature such a loved and tenured character. While Bo-Katan is busy rebuilding Mandalore, she will likely still appear to help Din Djarin in any way she can, and if it calls for it, may even lead her people back into battle.





 11  Captain Carson Teva 
Last Appeared: Ahsoka Season 1, Episode 7


 







Captain Carson Teva has become Din Djarin’s link to the New Republic, and the two even struck up a deal that Din would help the New Republic monitor the Outer Rim. The two have mutual respect for one another, and if politics play any role in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu, then it’s likely Carson Teva will reappear. It’s hard to discern how large of a role Teva will play, but it seems likely that he will at least cameo in the film.





 10  Zeb Orrelios 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 5
        

Zeb Orrelios was originally introduced in the animated show Star Wars Rebels, but made a live-action cameo in The Mandalorian season 3. It was further explained in Ahsoka season 1 that Zeb works for the New Republic training recruits. With Din Djarin working closely with Carson Teva at Adelphi Base, it’s possible that Zeb will appear. His cameo in The Mandalorian may be a precursor to his role in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.





 9  Omera 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 1, Episode 4
        

Omera was a villager on the planet Sorgan, which Din Djarin and Cara Dune helped protect in The Mandalorian season 1. The two developed feelings for each other and Omera begged Din and Grogu to stay, even kindly attempting to remove Din Djarin’s Mandalorian helmet to help him decide. In order to protect Omera, her daughter Winta, and the rest of the village, Din Djarin decided to leave, taking Grogu—who was still wanted by Moff Gideon—with him. If Din Djarin and Grogu get a happy ending, it’s possible that they&#39;ll return to Sorgan and reunite with Omera.
            
 
 The Mandalorian Cast &amp; Characters Guide 
The Mandalorian has created a long list of new Star Wars characters and brought back some familiar ones, with an incredible cast to match.








 8  Migs Mayfeld 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 2, Episode 7
        

Migs Mayfeld couldn’t really be considered an ally to Din Djarin and his friends, but he was vital in getting the location of Moff Gideon’s ship. Additionally, Mayfeld didn’t tell others that he had seen Din Djarin without his helmet. He may be a criminal that many of the Star Wars heroes don’t trust, but he has a level of respect for Din Djarin that makes his character worth revisiting. Mayfeld has only appeared in two episodes of The Mandalorian, but there’s no reason why he can’t appear on the big screen.





 7  Boba Fett 
Last Appeared: The Book of Boba Fett, Episode 7


 







Temuera Morrison’s Boba Fett was noticeably absent from The Mandalorian season 3, much to the audience&#39;s dismay. Star Wars hasn’t treated Boba Fett well since his series, The Book of Boba Fett, wasn’t quite up to the quality fans were hoping for. Hopefully, The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will see the return of the Daimyo of Mos Espa. Fett and Din Djarin became good allies, and it’s a shame the two former bounty hunters haven’t been seen onscreen together in such a long time.





 6  Fennec Shand 
Last Appeared: The Book of Boba Fett, Episode 7
        

Fennec Shand is Boba Fett’s right-hand man and is completing a life-debt to him. Fennec is an incredibly likable character and is an expert assassin. With her skills, Din Djarin may appeal to his friend Boba Fett for help and get help from Fennec in return. It would be wonderful to see Ming-Na Wen back onscreen, as it was obvious the legendary actress enjoyed her time in Star Wars.





 5  The Armorer 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 8
        

The Armorer is still one of the most interesting characters in The Mandalorian, mainly because she is so mysterious. A quasi-guide to Din Djarin and Bo-Katan, the Armorer should be seen again in The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu. Whether it be setting up Grogu’s future as the next Mandalore the Great who rides the Mythosaur, or just fitting new beskar armor, the Armorer should make an appearance in the upcoming movie.





 4  Ezra Bridger 
Last Appeared: Ahsoka Season 1, Episode 8


 







Ezra Bridger recently returned to the main Star Wars galaxy after nine years of exile following the liberation of Lothal. Bridger could factor into The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu in several ways. Ezra is a Jedi and could provide Grogu with more training, if that’s something he chooses. Alternatively, Ezra has connections to the Mandalorians and, more specifically, Bo-Katan. If Ezra is making a push to rescue the stranded Ahsoka Tano and Sabine Wren from Peridea, he may be reaching out to as many Mandalorian contacts as he has.
Lucasfilm has recently confirmed that Ahsoka season 2 is in active development with Dave Filoni at the show&#39;s helm. 






 3  Hera Syndulla 
Last Appeared: Ahsoka Season 1, Episode 8
        

General Hera Syndulla has close relationships with characters like Carson Teva and has connections to Bo-Katan Kryze, so it’s entirely possible that the Twi’lek pilot will appear. It’s also been rumored that Hera may be the leader of Adelphi Base, which is where Carson Teva, and by extension, Din Djarin operate out of. If this is true, it makes Hera’s appearance all the more likely. However, Dave Filoni may have plans for her in Ahsoka season 2, and Jon Favreau may not want to confuse storylines.





 2  Grand Admiral Thrawn 
Last Appeared: Ahsoka Season, Episode 8


 







The Imperial master strategist, Grand Admiral Thrawn, made his way back to the main Star Wars galaxy after being exiled in another galaxy for close to a decade. It’s still unclear what Thrawn’s overall goal is now that he’s hiding out on Dathomir, but war seems imminent. With Din Djarin being a big part of the efforts to take down Moff Gideon, it’s possible the New Republic would also want his help when it comes to ending whatever Thrawn has been planning.





 1  Kelleran Beq 
Last Appeared: The Mandalorian Season 3, Episode 4
        

After three seasons, Favreau and Filoni finally revealed who rescued Grogu from the Jedi Temple on Coruscant during Order 66. Kelleran Beq was an interesting choice, but it’s still unknown what happened to the Jedi following their escape from Coruscant. Hopefully, Star Wars alum Ahmed Best returns once again to the franchise and portrays Kelleran Beq in more flashbacks. What happened to Grogu has been one of the biggest mysteries throughout the show, so getting some kind of resolution to that should be near the top of Jon Favreau’s things to accomplish in his upcoming The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie.
