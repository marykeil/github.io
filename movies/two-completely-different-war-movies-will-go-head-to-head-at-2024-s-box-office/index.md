## Literature Review

2024 is already a good year for war dramas. With two promising war movies releasing in April, it will be competitive despite their vast differences.




2024 is already shaping up to be a phenomenal year for audiences expecting interesting takes on war movies, with the year&#39;s first half releasing a few interesting but completely different titles. Notable for their ability to mix thought-provoking themes with suspenseful drama and musings about the ethics of war, most war movies resonate with audiences because they inspire hope and pride in one&#39;s nation. Furthermore, the realism depicted in war movies helps audiences gain an understanding of the bravery and valor the men and women who&#39;ve laid their lives down for their respective nations have displayed throughout humanity&#39;s greatest times of need.




However, viewers are also witnessing changes and innovations in the war movie genre as the thoughts and feelings about politics and war are ever-changing in real life. Whereas most films of years past were ostensibly recruitment tools designed to embolden people to join their country&#39;s army, war movies in more contemporary times are offering a more complex and nuanced take on the establishments meant to protect and serve, thus resulting in truly unique movies about war. With two war movies with vastly different subjects and themes debuting in the same month, audiences will have plenty of things to consider once they both hit theaters.

                  Every A24 Movie Releasing In 2024   The industry’s leading production and distribution company A24 has several projects set to release in 2024. Which one will be the year’s next big hit?   


 Lionsgate&#39;s Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare Debuts The Same Month As A24&#39;s Civil War 
The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare releases on April 19 and Civil War on April 26
          




Based on the book by Damien Lewis, Guy Ritchie&#39;s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare set its release date for theaters on April 19. It sees Henry Cavill as the unnamed lead in a movie about the British military recruiting a small group of highly-skilled soldiers to infiltrate Nazis during World War II. While further details are scarce, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is a reteam of Cavill and Ritchie, who first worked together in 2015&#39;s The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and is billed as an action comedy. With a cast consisting of Cavill, Eiza Gonzalez, Henry Golding, Alan Ritchson, and Cary Elwes, Ritchie&#39;s new film aims to be a lot of fun.

On the other hand, A24&#39;s Civil War, which is set for an April 26 release date, aims to go in the opposite direction tonally. While the details surrounding Alex Garland&#39;s newest movie are also minimal, the film stars Kirsten Dunst as a reporter embroiled in a civil war set in a dystopian America where political unrest is at an all-time high. As seen in Civil War&#39;s trailer, the upcoming movie is devoid of the humor and charm typical of a Guy Ritchie movie, thus making it starkly different from its competition. Nevertheless, their differences position both movies to benefit immensely since they both bring something unique to the table.





 



 The Two War Movies Are Competing At The Box Office (But Their Differences Will Help) 
Civil War will be more dramatic whereas The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare will be more comedic
          

Despite both war movies releasing in 2024, their different approaches to the subject will allow them both to be successful without taking away from the other. With Ritchie&#39;s signature flashy filmmaking flair and gut-busting sense of humor, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare is no doubt going to present a more lighthearted approach to its commentary about war. Garland&#39;s track record of making moody, thought-provoking pieces, such as Ex Machina and Annihilation, guarantees that Civil War will present viewers with shocking imagery designed to inspire critical thinking. Irrespective of their differences, both war movies are sure to be welcome additions to the genre.
