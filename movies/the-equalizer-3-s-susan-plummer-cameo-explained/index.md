Summary

  The Equalizer 3 includes a brief cameo from Melissa Leo as Susan Plummer, in a memory of a conversation with Robert McCall.   Susan Plummer died in The Equalizer 2, making her unexpected appearance in The Equalizer 3 surprising.   The movie uses footage from the first movie for the cameo, which becomes more important as the ending reveals the true identity of Emma Collins.  





The Equalizer 3 brings back Melissa Leo as Susan Plummer in a surprising cameo, given that the character dies in The Equalizer 2. The third and final installment of Denzel Washington&#39;s vigilante action franchise brings back Denzel Washington as Robert McCall, as he battles a crime organization in Italy. The Equalizer 3 brings back few other characters from earlier in the franchise, though, focusing on a new story with a new set of characters. However, the movie does include some notable connections to the previous installments, including a brief appearance by Melissa Leo&#39;s Susan Plummer, that helps connect to the events of The Equalizer 3&#39;s ending.




Melissa Leo appeared as Susan Plummer in the first two The Equalizer movies, a DIA agent who helped Robert McCall. However, Susan Plummer dies in The Equalizer 2, killed in a hotel room while investigating a murder. McCall then went on to avenger her death, wrapping up the story (seemingly) neatly, and removing her from the franchise. This is why it came as a surprise to see Susan and Robert having a brief conversation in The Equalizer 3. The scene is part of a look inside McCall&#39;s mind, and exists as an important part of the movie&#39;s big reveal about Emma Collins.



The Equalizer franchise is loosely based on the TV series of the same name, which ran from 1985 - 1989.





 The Equalizer 3 Uses Footage From The First Movie To Include Susan Plummer 
Melissa Leo Did Not Film Any New Scenes For The Cameo 
          




Melissa Leo did not film any new scenes for The Equalizer 3, as the movie used footage from the original movie for this moment. The cameo comes after Robert first speaks to Emma Collins (Dakota Fanning), as Robert remembers a conversation with Plummer. This memory is lifted directly from the first movie when the two friends have a conversation about what McCall has gotten himself involved in. Plummer mentions that McCall has always been the type of guy to take action against someone who has wronged others. It is a snippet of this exchange that Robert is shown remembering and thinking about again.

Since the initial The Equalizer movie came out in 2014 and this scene was quite short, it is understandable if The Equalizer 3 viewers do not immediately recall that this moment happened previously. It proves to be a rather clever way of including Plummer without requiring Melissa Leo to return. It is unclear if there were ever intentions to have Leo and Washington film a new scene together as part of this memory sequence. The Equalizer 3 could have used a potential newly filmed scene between the co-stars to further tease one of the movie&#39;s big reveals.






 The Equalizer 3&#39;s Ending Makes Susan&#39;s Cameo More Important 
The Memory Reminds Audiences of Who Plummer Is
         

The relatively early reminder of Susan Plummer becomes even more important when The Equalizer 3&#39;s ending takes shape and the true identity of Emma Collins is revealed. The movie confirms that Emma Collins is Susan Plummer&#39;s daughter with Brian Plummer (Bill Pullman), explaining why Robert trusted her so much throughout the process and wanted to work with her specifically. The connection between Robert and Emma is a surprising one, but explains their connection beautifully.

Furthermore, the fact that the memory of Susan plays in Robert&#39;s head shortly after talking to her daughter for the first time could explain why he is suddenly thinking about that previous exchange. It could also be considered foreshadowing, creating a link between the characters before the big reveal. Finally, it serves as a fresh reminder of Susan&#39;s role in the franchise before The Equalizer 3&#39;s reveal - which, for a franchise that spans a decade, is a helpful was to ensure that audiences remember exactly who Susan Plummer is.
