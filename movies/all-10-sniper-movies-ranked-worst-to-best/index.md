## Literature Review
Although the Sniper franchise has proven surprisingly resilient, not every movie in the series has had the same impact — so which is the best?




The Sniper franchise has proven to be a remarkably enduring series, but not all of its installments have had the same impact. Following the character Master Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett, portrayed by Tom Berenger, the franchise distinguishes itself with high-stakes sniper missions set across various global landscapes. This consistent focus on the intense and perilous world of sniping has granted the series a unique niche within the action genre, contributing to its lasting appeal.
The enduring charm of the Sniper franchise rests on multiple factors. Despite criticisms of its formulaic elements and undeveloped characters, the Sniper series strikes a balance between captivating portrayals of jungle warfare, tense sniping sequences, and evolving character dynamics. As a result, the Sniper franchise has carved out a distinctive name for itself, alluring audiences with its blend of suspense and tactical intrigue — though such strengths work better in some Sniper installments than others.

 How To Watch The Sniper Movie Series In Order 
Sniper is a cult action movie franchise that has been quietly running for 30 years and counting, but in which order should the films be viewed?













 








 10  Sniper: Reloaded (2011) 
A Poor Plot Prevents Its New Perspective From Shining


Close







Sniper: Reloaded deviates from the well-known Thomas Beckett story to center on his son, Marine Sgt. Brandon Beckett, who is looking into the murder of his partner. While the film has fantastically visceral action sequences, it is easily the weakest entry in the franchise. Even with Billy Zane&#39;s return as Richard Miller, its biggest flaws include a boring plot and flimsy execution. Despite this, Sniper: Reloaded offers a fresh viewpoint to the Sniper series, with a personal quest for justice set against a backdrop of big guns and military intrigue. It adds a layer of complexity to the established narrative, exploring themes of legacy and personal sacrifice.





 9  Sniper: Ghost Shooter (2016) 
Relies Too Heavily On Familiar Tropes &amp; Plot Developments
        

Sniper: Ghost Shooter pits two of the best snipers in the business — Beckett and Miller — against the deadly terrorist sniper Ravshan Gazakov. Similar to other titles in the franchise, the movie is chock-full of intense action sequences. Sniper: Ghost Shooter enhances the franchise by putting elite snipers in the face of a cunning foe, which adds suspense and complexity to the established story. Unfortunately, the film&#39;s reliance on familiar tropes and predictable plot developments prevent it from ranking higher among Sniper&#39;s installments, as its approach is both formulaic and predictable.





 8  Sniper: Legacy (2014) 
Its Bait-And-Switch Plot Brings Down An Otherwise Deep Story
        

Sniper: Legacy, the fifth installment in the Sniper series, centers on the deaths of military leaders and follows Brandon Beckett&#39;s search for the person who caused them. The film has been praised for exploring familial relationships, which adds emotional depth to the story that wasn&#39;t present in earlier chapters. Its bait-and-switch plot, however, came across as manipulative, leading to an overly complicated script. Despite its complex plot, Sniper: Legacy enriches the series by delving into interpersonal relationships and offering unexpected twists. The film&#39;s attempt to blend emotional moments with intricate plot dynamics provides a unique flavor, even if the complexity prevents it from ranking higher.





 7  Sniper: Rogue Mission (2022) 
Fails To Live Up To An Intriguing Premise


Close







The ninth film in the Sniper series, Sniper: Rogue Mission, showcases CIA sniper Brandon Beckett teaming up with unconventional allies — National Security Agent Zero and the enigmatic Lady Death — as they investigate a federal agent involved in human trafficking. Due in large part to its humorous tone, the film fails to live up to the intriguing premise it sets up. Even though the movie mainly focuses on its high-octane action scenes, the drab plot is made even worse by its poor acting, especially since it misses out on the chemistry between Berenger and Zane. Sniper: Rogue Mission&#39;s forgettable narrative prevents it from being a standout in the series, even though the on-screen chemistry between its main characters is refreshing at times.





 6  Sniper: Assassin&#39;s End (2000) 
Thrilling Action Can&#39;t Make Up For Its Lack Of Originality
        

Sniper: Assassin&#39;s End once again follows Special Ops Sniper Brandon Beckett, played by Chad Michael Collins, and his father, Sniper Master Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Beckett, as they hunt for a corrupt operative within the government. Criticized for its lack of originality, Sniper: Assassin&#39;s End fails to break free from the formulaic elements of the franchise, limiting its potential to stand out as a unique addition, even though it adds a new layer of complexity and action. The movie, despite its familial and suspenseful elements, falls short of delivering a fresh and innovative storyline within the established Sniper narrative. Therefore, it can&#39;t break into the top-five installments.

 5  Sniper: Ultimate Kill (2017) 
An Entertaining &amp; Engaging Story With Some Flaws
        

Sniper: Ultimate Kill, the seventh chapter in the series, follows DEA agent Kate Estrada and sniper Brandon Beckett as they tackle a Colombian drug lord and his hired assassin, El Diablo. Praised for its slick production and credible character portrayals, the film delivers a straightforward, engaging story with occasional surprises. Its script can be predictable and poorly written at times, but its simplicity can be fun from an entertainment perspective. Despite some accuracy issue when it comes to military tactics and technical things, the film is an enjoyable and humorous ride with great sarcastic commentary. It&#39;s not the best Sniper movie, but it&#39;s memorable enough to make the top five.





 4  Sniper: G.R.I.T. - Global Response &amp; Intelligence Team (2023) 
Emotional Depth &amp; Compelling Action Breathes Life Into The Franchise
        

Sniper: G.R.I.T. proves a respectable follow-up that adds genuine value to the franchise. The plot centers on a recently formed CIA offshoot, the Global Response &amp; Intelligence Team (G.R.I.T.), as they combat a terrorist threat. Although G.R.I.T. has received some negative feedback, the storyline offers stronger emotional depth by revealing deeper backstories for franchise characters. The consistent tone wins out despite the film’s sporadic CGI violence. Director Oliver Thompson breathes life back into the series with a story that may not be revolutionary but has interesting sniper kills and compelling action.





 3  Sniper 3 (2004) 
A Well-Crafted Script &amp; Strong Performances Elevate The Film
        

Sniper 3 navigates the challenges faced by Thomas Beckett, now a Marine adjusting to life after the events of Sniper 2. The film is praised for Tom Berenger and Byron Mann&#39;s strong performances, with both stars managing to elevate the production despite its low budget. The narrative takes Beckett on a personal mission to eliminate a former comrade turned drug and weapons trafficker known as &#34;King Cobra.&#34; The film explores the dark history of Beckett&#39;s past missions and unveils a conspiracy within the CIA. Despite its low budget, the combination of a well-crafted script and strong performances sets Sniper 3 apart, landing it among the best of the franchise.





 2  Sniper 2 (2002) 
Heart-Pounding Action, An Engaging Story, &amp; Solid Acting Make For A Thrill Ride
        

Sniper 2 follows Marine sniper Thomas Beckett as he teams up with death-row sniper Jake Cole and an underground resistance member to assassinate a Serbian general. As Beckett and Cole navigate challenges and orchestrate a daring escape post-assassination, the film&#39;s strengths lie in its ability to maintain suspense and deliver heart-pounding action sequences, offering a thrill ride all around. While the film is praised for its script, acting, and gripping plot, it has also been criticized for technical flaws, such as linguistic inaccuracies. Despite its low budget, Sniper 2 impresses with its engaging story, solid performances, and intense action sequences.





 1  Sniper (1993) 
A Distinct Narrative With Many Strengths


Close







The original Sniper movie follows Master Gunnery Sergeant Tom Beckett and inexperienced sharpshooter Richard Miller on a mission in Panama. Sniper has been praised for its competent direction, engaging plot, and strong performances, especially by Tom Berenger and Billy Zane. The film also boasts great tension and powerful depictions of violence. While there are some underdeveloped characters and formulaic elements, the movie&#39;s portrayal of jungle warfare and chemistry between the lead characters makes up for any flaws. The distinct narrative — especially for its time — set Sniper apart, establishing it as the best installment in the Sniper franchise.
