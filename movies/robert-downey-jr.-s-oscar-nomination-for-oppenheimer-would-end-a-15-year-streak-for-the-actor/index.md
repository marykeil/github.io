# Robert Downey Jr. s Oscar Nomination For Oppenheimer Would End A 15-Year Streak For The Actor


## SUMMARY 



  Oppenheimer is among Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s best performances yet and could earn him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor.   Downey&#39;s previous Oscar nomination was in 2009 for Tropic Thunder, and since then, his roles in the MCU haven&#39;t earned him any nominations.   Oppenheimer is likely to be nominated for Best Picture, marking Downey&#39;s first Best Picture nomination since 2005&#39;s Good Night, and Good Luck.

## Literature Review

Robert Downey Jr. has had an incredibly successful career and an Oscar nomination for Oppenheimer would put an end to an unwanted 15-year streak. 




Despite being one of the most recognizable actors in Hollywood, Robert Downey Jr. has an unwanted 15-year streak that Oppenheimer may finally end. Oppenheimer is among Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s best performances and not only could his role earn a nomination, but the movie will likely be up for Best Picture as well. All signs point towards at least one Oscar nomination for Oppenheimer, but it could be a contender for many awards because of its sound, design, and performances. The film has already been a huge financial and critical hit, and with the Academy Awards set to take place in March, Oppenheimer looks destined to continue its success.




This is great news for Downey and his potential to be part of an award-winning movie. While he has had a successful career, Downey has not always received accolades and acknowledgment for his great work, and that has been evident over the last 15 years. His performance as Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer has been a reminder of just how talented he is, and the Oscars could finally validate such a memorable career. A potential Oscar for Oppenheimer would be overdue for Robert Downey Jr., but he does have some fierce competition in the Best Supporting Actor category. A win for Downey or Oppenheimer would finally avenge his 15-year streak.


 Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Last Oscar-Nominated Role Came The Year He Joined The MCU 
          

Despite his huge role in the MCU, Downey&#39;s last Oscar-nominated performance happened in the same year he joined Marvel&#39;s Cinematic Universe. He was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2009, for 2008&#39;s Tropic Thunder. Ironically, it is the same category that may put an end to his winless streak at the Oscars. Downey&#39;s performances as Tony Stark in the Iron Man films and the wider MCU have been captivating yet haven&#39;t earned him any Oscar nominations. Iron Man and Sherlock Holmes have been his biggest roles since his last nomination, with few other movies making a big impact or gaining much critical praise.




Before joining Marvel, Downey was part of many serious movies and looked capable of winning an Oscar, as his Tropic Thunder nomination suggests. It was a Christopher Nolan film that denied Robert Downey Jr. his Oscar in 2009, and it may be Christopher Nolan who helps him win one 15 years later. Despite Downey&#39;s MCU and Sherlock Holmes performances being favorable among audiences, they are not the type of roles that tend to win much at the Oscars. The Judge won accolades for lead, Robert Duvall, but didn&#39;t do much for Downey. Fifteen years after joining the MCU, his fortunes may finally change through Oppenheimer.

                  Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Next Project Shows Oppenheimer Wasn&#39;t A Fluke   After Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s Oppenheimer, role it&#39;s easy to assume the outcome was just a fluke. His next project, however, proves this is not the case.    



 Oppenheimer Will Be RDJ&#39;s First Best Picture Nominated Movie Since 2005 
          




With Oppenheimer almost certain to be nominated for Best Picture, it will be Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s first since Good Night, and Good Luck. The movie also shares the same kind of themes around communism that Oppenheimer does despite being such widely different movies. Christopher Nolan&#39;s Oppenheimer Best Picture nomination at the Oscars could also redeem the director&#39;s winless run at the ceremony, while simultaneously ending a near two-decade streak for Downey. Good Night, and Good Luck is Downey&#39;s only ever Best Picture nominated movie, which is baffling considering the number of quality projects he&#39;s been involved with.

Chaplin was never nominated for an Oscar, likely due to only five movies being nominated for the award each year until it changed to 10 nominees in 2009. This may also have granted Wonder Boys a nomination at the 2001 Academy Awards. While Downey&#39;s unlucky streak at the Oscars has lasted a long time, it does seem Oppenheimer will finally give him redemption. His 18-year run without a Best Picture nominated film will likely come to an end, and it could even be his first movie to win the award. Likewise, he will likely receive his first acting nomination in 15 years, and Oppenheimer may provide him with his first individual Oscar.
