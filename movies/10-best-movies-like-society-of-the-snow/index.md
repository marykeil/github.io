## Literature Review

Society of the Snow is the latest survival film based on a true story among other films such as The Revenant and The Perfect Storm. 




Society of the Snow is the latest survival drama film that draws upon real-life events, similar to films like The Impossible and Apollo 13. Society of the Snow, directed by J. A. Bayona, is about the 1972 Andes flight accident. The film&#39;s main source is a book of the same title by Pablo Vierci which provides first-hand details about the crash from its survivors.
The Old Christians Club rugby team members, and some of their family and friends, boarded the Uruguayan Air Force Flight, making their way to Chile for a match. The plane crashed into the Andes mountains and the rugby team and other passengers would have to survive for 72 days before being rescued. Society of the Snow has already received much acclaim. Many other acclaimed dramas have been inspired by real-life events, including another film based on the 1972 Andes crash, Alive.









 








 10  Alive (1993) 
An early account of the 1972 Andes Flight Disaster


 







Alive is the survival drama film directed by Frank Marshall that tells the story of the 1972 Andes flight crash, the same story depicted in Society of the Snow. Aside from the true story each film is based on, the directors are similarly praised for their handling of the story. Much like the compliments given to J. A. Bayona, critics praised Marshall for his ability to focus on the humanity among the survivors, rather than sensationalizing their story. Additionally, the survivors were asked to work on the films. Nando Parrado worked on Alive as a technical advisor and a few of the real-life survivors acted in Society of the Snow.

 9  The Revenant (2015) 
A journey guided by determination
        

  The Revenant  


  Release Date    December 25, 2015     Director    Alejandro González Iñárritu     Cast    will poulter , Leonardo DiCaprio , Paul Anderson , Tom Hardy , Domhnall Gleeson     Rating    R    


The Revenant is loosely based on the novel of the same name by Michael Punke. The film follows the journey of a fur trapper and mountain man in the 1800s, Hugh Glass, after he is attacked by a bear, comes close to death, and seeks revenge for those who&#39;ve left him behind. The film also introduces a familial aspect to Glass&#39; character, providing more fuel to his need for revenge after his son is killed, though historically, no son has been recorded. Similar to the survivors in Society of the Snow, Glass makes his way through rigorous weather conditions, motivated by others to survive and keep going.





 8  Cast Away (2000) 
A film made with firsthand experience
        

  Cast Away  


  Release Date    December 22, 2000     Director    Robert Zemeckis     Cast    Paul Sanchez , Lari White , Leonid Citer , David Allen Brooks , Jelena Papovic , Valentina Ananyina     Rating    PG-13    


Unlike other films mentioned, Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks as Chuck Noland, is not based on one real-life event but is rather inspired by multiple sources. Chuck is a FedEx worker whose plane crashes as he&#39;s on his way to Malaysia for work. Hanks was inspired to make Cast Away after questioning what would happen if the real-life aircraft that flies FedEx packages over the Pacific Ocean were to crash. Cast Away and Society of the Snow are similar in the way preparation and research were done before the films were made.
Cast Away screenwriter William Broyles Jr. spoke to survival experts and even went as far as to strand himself on an isolated beach for a week. Society of the Snow director J. A. Bayona made sure to shoot on the location of the real-life plane crash as a way to understand the journey the survivors endured. This atmosphere was also created by the isolation of filming in Spain for six months and the weather conditions that came with filming on location.





 7  127 Hours (2010) 
A survivalist story with a gruesome way to recovery
        

127 Hours is a film by Danny Boyle that details the story of Aron Ralston who gets his arm trapped under a boulder. Similar to Society of the Snow, 127 Hours focuses on love as a motivator for the survivalist. Another similarity comes from real-life instances in which Ralston resorts to cutting his right arm off and how the Andes survivors turn to cannibalism as a way to keep fed. The latter of the gruesome details isn&#39;t emphasized as much in the film as the director felt camaraderie was a more important detail to focus on. However, in 127 Hours, Ralston&#39;s amputation is shown in a graphic and detailed manner.





 6  Everest (2015) 
An expedition through a blizzard on Mount Everest
        

  Everest  


  Release Date    September 18, 2015     Director    Baltasar Kormakur     Cast    Jason Clarke , Elizabeth Debicki , Robin Wright , Josh Brolin , Jake Gyllenhaal , Sam Worthington , Keira Knightley     Rating    PG-13    


Everest is based on the true story of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, mainly focusing on the expedition groups led by Rob Hall (Jason Clarke) and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal). Just like Society of the Snow, the climbers in Everest are met with brutal, cold weather conditions which would lead to eight of the climbers dying. Blizzards and hypothermia are the common causes of death among the Mount Everest climbers and the film, similarly to Society of the Snow, utilizes cinematography techniques to connect to audiences and make the expedition as realistic as possible. Although some critics and audiences are indifferent to some of Everest&#39;s dizzying effects.





 5  The Impossible (2012) 
A fight for survival against nature
        

The Impossible is a film by Society of the Snow director, J. A. Bayona. The film follows the story of the real-life Belón-Álvarez family and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Thailand. The Impossible and Society of the Snow are alike, not only in the characters&#39; battle against nature but in the way Bayona went about telling these stories. Bayona is praised for his intention to be accurate in the storytelling, rather than amp up the drama or take considerable creative liberties. Similar to how Bayona called to film at the real-life location for Society of the Snow, The Impossible was filmed in Thailand.

 4  Apollo 13 (1995) 
A lunar mission that was quickly aborted


 







  Apollo 13  


  Release Date    June 30, 1995     Director    Ron Howard     Cast    Tom Hanks , Bill Paxton , Kevin Bacon , Gary Sinise , Ed Harris , Kathleen Quinlan     Rating    PG    


Different from other movies listed, the story of Apollo 13 takes place in space. The film is based on the true story of the 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission and the book written by Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger about the mission. Where J. A. Bayona focused on accuracy in filming locations and the actors cast in Society of the Snow, Apollo 13 director, Ron Howard, made sure to be as technically accurate as possible. Both films also involve failing aircraft, with one cause being a navigation error and the other an electrical short.





 3  Into The Wild (2007) 
A solo journey in the Alaskan wilderness
        

Into the Wild follows the real-life story of Christopher McCandless who hiked through the Stampede Trail in Alaska and attempted to live in the wilderness. Similar in its biographical and survival storytelling elements, Into the Wild differs from Society of the Snow in a few ways. Into the Wild is a solo journey and not a group effort to make it back to civilization. McCandless also chose to venture into the wild, not knowing what his fate would be. While the survivors in each film differ, audiences might find similarities in their human nature.





 2  The Perfect Storm (2000) 
A fishing expedition cut short due to dangerous weather
        

Critics, audiences, and the families of the fishermen have mixed feelings about the portrayal of the Andrea Gail fishing expedition in The Perfect Storm. Unlike Society of the Snow, this film dramatizes real-life events, and due to there being no survivors from the expedition, much of what follows after the last radio call are speculated details. However, Into the Storm, while exaggerated, shows the fishermen working to avoid the catastrophic weather conditions out on the sea. It&#39;s similar to the survivors&#39; journey with avalanches and frigid weather in Society of the Snow.





 1  Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) 
A return home depicting Australian history


 







The Australian film, Rabbit-Proof Fence, is based on a book by Doris Pilkington Garimara. Garimara&#39;s mother, Molly, was one of three girls who escaped a settlement and made the journey back to their Aboriginal community at Jigalong. Similar to the theme of friendship among the survivors in Society of the Snow, the familial relationship of the three girls is what makes their story all the more emotional. Though the film is loosely based on Garimara&#39;s book and takes creative liberties to dramatize the story, its emotional essence and the history of Australia&#39;s child removal policy act as the foundation for the girls&#39; return home.
