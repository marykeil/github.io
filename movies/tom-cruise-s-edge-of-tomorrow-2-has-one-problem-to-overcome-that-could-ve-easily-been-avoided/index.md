## Literature Review

Edge of Tomorrow 2 has one of the most unique problems a sequel has ever faced: picking between its predecessors&#39; two separate titles.




Tom Cruise&#39;s 2014 action movie Edge of Tomorrow may be finally getting a sequel, but Edge of Tomorrow 2 would inherit a problem with its title from the original film. Edge of Tomorrow was an action-packed, sci-fi time loop story that starred Cruise and Emily Blunt in futuristic mechanized armor. The pair fought off an alien invasion, but every time they died, the day, and battles, began anew until they could find victory. The movie, based on the All You Need Is Kill light novels, was a critical success, but it had a mediocre showing at the box office, partly due to confusion over its name.




Edge of Tomorrow had a unique problem: it had two titles. Throughout its theatrical run, it also came to be known as Live Die Repeat, a confusing change that contributed to its lackluster earnings. Two superstar leads, incredible action set pieces with pristine visuals, and an original futuristic setting weren&#39;t enough to overcome the confusion of having two titles brought into a relatively new IP. A sequel would have to finally solve this problem and settle on a single, clear title to let viewers refer to it without confusion. This problem never should have happened in the first place, and a potential Edge of Tomorrow 2 will have to fix it.

                  10 Best Tom Cruise Movies, Ranked   With a career spanning more than 40 years, Tom Cruise is one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest stars. From comedies to action movies, the actor has done it all.   


 Why Edge Of Tomorrow Has Two Different Titles 
          




There is an interesting reason why Edge of Tomorrow has two different titles. Live Die Repeat was originally the movie&#39;s tagline, but the poster displayed it in a much larger font than the actual title, leading audiences to confusion over what to call it. Director Doug Liman pushed for the title to be Live Die Repeat, which helps explain why the tagline was so prominent on the poster in the first place. The movie also earned a third title combining the previous two when it was made available for streaming on Amazon Prime, becoming Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow to rebrand and clear up confusion.


 



 Edge Of Tomorrow 2 Needs A Clear Sequel Title 
          




Development for a sequel to Edge of Tomorrow has been slow, and the title problem hasn&#39;t been a high priority on the project&#39;s list of tasks. Ten years later, no form of sequel to Edge of Tomorrow, be it a prequel or an actual continuation of the first movie, has entered active development. From Live Die Repeat and Repeat or Edge of Tomorrow 2, the possibilities as to what title this potential sequel should have are many. However, they are not necessarily great titles for the continuation of a 2014 film that didn&#39;t have a strong box office run.



Production of the sequel isn&#39;t guaranteed, but its chances have improved due to a new deal between Tom Cruise and Warner Brothers.




While Live Die Repeat and Repeat is a unique and interesting title, it doesn&#39;t clearly convey that it is the sequel to Edge of Tomorrow. On the other hand, Edge of Tomorrow 2 would confuse the fans who thought the original tagline was the name of the movie. The best option could be to follow the streaming strategy and combine the two into Live Die Repeat: Edge of Tomorrow 2, which is also not a very inspired title. Whatever title it chooses, Edge of Tomorrow 2 needs to pick one and be very obvious that there&#39;s no other way to reference it.






 Will Edge Of Tomorrow 2 Actually Happen? 
         

Edge of Tomorrow 2 has had a few updates, but nothing has been confirmed yet. Emily Blunt said she has read a script for the film and would be willing to reprise her role, but things seem to be moving slowly. That could change in the near future, though, as Tom Cruise&#39;s new deal with Warner Brothers could include an Edge of Tomorrow sequel. The deal would put Cruise&#39;s company and Warner Bros. into an agreement to jointly produce and develop films. Cruise also originally made Edge of Tomorrow with Warner Bros., so the deal could be enough to get production started.

Still, Cruise has been busy with his Mission: Impossible filming schedule, and making time for a movie that isn&#39;t guaranteed to be a box office hit may not fit into his schedule. He still has Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 2 to focus on until its release in 2025. Blunt also did not seem optimistic about the chances of returning to the franchise, despite her excitement. While nothing is certain about Edge of Tomorrow 2, hopes for the sequel&#39;s production have brightened in recent days compared to previous years.




Edge of Tomorrow 2 is already facing challenges even before an official confirmation, but they should be relatively easy to fix. Having two titles to choose from isn&#39;t an obstacle many movies have to face, but the futuristic action series can rise to the challenge. Production of the sequel isn&#39;t guaranteed, but its chances have improved due to a new deal between Tom Cruise and Warner Brothers. Once development begins, the only problem left for the franchise is deciding not only which title to use but how to market such a peculiar sequel.
