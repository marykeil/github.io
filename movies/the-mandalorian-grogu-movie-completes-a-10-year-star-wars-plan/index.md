## Literature Review

One iconic Star Wars character was originally going to have their own movie, and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is the perfect replacement - 10 years later.




Prior to Din Djarin, Star Wars had created and canceled big ideas for another infamous bounty hunter, Boba Fett, and now The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will fulfill those decade-long plans. Boba was an iconic character due to his mysterious background and ruthless efficiency in his first appearance in The Empire Strikes Back. Out of all the bounty hunters Darth Vader recruited to track down the Millenium Falcon, only Boba was successful, proving he was one of the best in the business. He was also briefly employed by Jabba the Hutt, when he was eventually thrown into a Sarlacc pit.




Despite his popularity, Boba didn&#39;t have much screen time in the Star Wars movie timeline. In an attempt to rectify that and give the infamous character his time in the spotlight, Lucasfilm created a plan to focus a movie on Boba. That movie was eventually dropped, but later turned into a show. The Book of Boba Fett season 2 is unlikely, though, leaving Boba out of the plan his character started. Lucasfilm&#39;s plans for the mysterious bounty hunter in Mandalorian armor had a rocky road and constantly intersected with Din&#39;s, and the next movie in the franchise will finally see those plans completed after 10 years.

                  Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie   The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.   


 Star Wars&#39; Boba Fett&#39;s Movie Plan Is Complete With The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu 
          




There was a standalone Boba Fett movie originally announced in 2013, but by 2018, it had been canceled in favor of The Mandalorian. Then, after the story of Din and Grogu became a smash hit for Disney, Boba received his own show. Boba Fett&#39;s canceled movie could have been better than his TV show, which received mixed reviews and raised controversies over its quality and changes to the character. Despite the rocky path it took, Star Wars&#39; plans for a movie focusing on a fan-favorite bounty hunter are finally being fulfilled by The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu.



 How The Mandalorian Replaced Boba Fett In Star Wars 
          

Boba Fett had a promising but ultimately disappointing journey in Star Wars. He began as a ruthless villain in cool armor, but was seemingly killed off in Return of the Jedi. Then, both his motivations and his backstory as the son of legendary bounty hunter Jango Fett were explored in depth in the prequels and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Finally, the rug was pulled out from under him in The Book of Boba Fett. His reputation as a cold-blooded killer with a grudge against the Jedi for killing his father was instantly undone in favor of turning him into a friendly daimyo on Tatooine.




Din, on the other hand, filled the void left by Boba perfectly. His character has been fleshed out since his debut in The Mandalorian, but he still has an air of mystery to his backstory. While he also works for the New Republic and allies with the heroes of the story, he can still be ruthlessly efficient in battle and deliver amazingly intimidating threats. He quickly became the franchise&#39;s new favorite bounty hunter, and he was chosen to bring the series back to the big screen due to his popularity and importance.

While Boba may not hold the coveted place in Star Wars that he once did, his impact on the franchise is still being felt. His legacy as the coolest armor-clad bounty hunter in the galaxy lives on through Din, who ushered in a new side of the series. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will see the plans originally made for Boba finally completed.

              The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu  The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is a Star Wars movie directed by Jon Favreau that continues Disney&#43;&#39;s immensely popular TV Show, The Mandalorian. The film will replace The Mandalorian season 4 to bring the franchise back to the big screen and follow Din Djarin and his adventures with Grogu. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu is the first Star Wars film to be released since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019.
