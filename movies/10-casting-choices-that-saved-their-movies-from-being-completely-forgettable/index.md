# 10 Casting Choices That Saved Their Movies From Being Completely Forgettable


## SUMMARY 


 Certain castings can take what otherwise would be a mediocre or forgettable movie and elevate it into something great. 
 For example, Robert Downey Jr.&#39;s charismatic portrayal of Sherlock Holmes saves the forgettable action movies from being complete duds. 
 Alyssa Sutherland&#39;s understanding of the tone in Evil Dead Rise makes her performance as the main deadite standout and keeps the film engaging.

## Literature Review

Plenty of bad movies have great performances, but these castings elevated the entire movie from mediocrity and made them very watchable. 




Filmmaking is a tricky business and casting the right actor for the right role is always a challenge, but some casting decisions have been so good they made mediocre movies better. Plenty of bad movies have good performances in them, but certain performances are more than a solid part of an average movie. They instead raise the rest of the movie and make the film worth more than the sum of its parts. With another actor in the role, these films would suffer greatly.
This is often the case when an actor understands the main character and the movie better than the script or director does, and their unique spin on the character gives the film more substance than it would have had without them. Sometimes a key supporting actor can also save a movie, as their performance stands out among the cast. A simple understanding of tone can make a world of difference for both the character and the movie, and these actors understood their films the best.
            
 
 10 Great Movie Performances That Received Way Too Much Hate 
From big swings that were taken the wrong way, to over-saturation, to poor timing and a bad script, some performances were unfairly maligned.












 








 10  Reneé Rapp As Regina George 
Mean Girls 2024


 







  Mean Girls (2024)  
Not Yet Rated



  Release Date    January 12, 2024     Director    Samantha Jayne , Arturo Perez Jr.     Cast    Angourie Rice , Auli&#39;i Cravalho , Jaquel Spivey , Reneé Rapp , Jon Hamm , Ashley Park , Jenna Fischer , Tina Fey , Tim Meadows     Writers    Nell Benjamin , Tina Fey     Distributor(s)    Paramount Pictures    


Despite its musical twist, the 2024 version of Mean Girls doesn&#39;t add much to the original film. The remake is mostly a glossy retread of the 2004 teen classic, with the best jokes being ripped straight from the first. However, Reneé Rapp does deliver a star-making turn as Regina George, the leader of the plastics. While this Regina isn&#39;t as well drawn as Rachel McAdams&#39; version, the role still allows Rapp to shine, showing her vocal and comedic chops. Rapp is a highlight of Mean Girls and the only new cast member who rivals her original counterpart.





 9  Robert Downey Jr. As Sherlock Holmes 
Sherlock Holmes


 







  Sherlock Holmes  
PG-13



  Release Date    December 25, 2009     Director    Guy Ritchie     Cast    Mark Strong , Eddie Marsan , Robert Downey Jr. , Rachel McAdams , Jude Law     Runtime    128 minutes     Writers    Anthony Peckham , Simon Kinberg , Michael Robert Johnson     Studio(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


All adaptations of Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s Detective are heavily reliant on the actor starring as Sherlock. Still, Robert Downey Jr. does some extra lifting in the two films by Guy Ritchie. Sherlock Holmes and its sequel are mostly forgettable and not particularly smart action movies that are saved by their all-star cast. Downey can play cocky and charismatic in his sleep, and he is effortlessly charming as Sherlock. Neither film is particularly good, but this interpretation became a franchise solely off the love for Downey as the character. Sherlock Holmes 3 has been stuck in development hell for over a decade, but there&#39;s still a desire by many to see the trilogy be completed.





 8  Alyssa Sutherland As Ellie 
Evil Dead Rise
        

  Evil Dead Rise  
R



  Release Date    April 21, 2023     Director    Lee Cronin     Cast    Alyssa Sutherland , Lily Sullivan , Gabrielle Echols , Morgan Davies , Nell Fisher , Mia Challis     Runtime    120 minutes     Writers    Lee Cronin , Sam Raimi     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Last year&#39;s Evil Dead Rise was a good update to the franchise that never reached the heights of the originals but had just enough clever scares to get by. Most of the film&#39;s fun came from Alyssa Sutherland&#39;s performance as the main deadite and possessed mother. Sutherland seemed to understand the tone of Evil Dead better than the film itself and is joyfully nasty in the role. From the smallest grin to the biggest yell, she is what keeps the film engaging for two hours.
























 7  Paul Giamatti As Marty Wolf 
Big Fat Liar
        

 Big Fat Liar 
PG



  Release Date    February 8, 2002     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Frankie Muniz , Paul Giamatti , Amanda Bynes , Amanda Detmer , Donald Faison , Sandra Oh     Writers    Dan Schneider , Brian Robbins    


For the most part, Big Fat Liar is a below-average children&#39;s film, but one performance is so funny it elevates the entire film to become a solid comedy. While Frankie Muniz is a charming kid lead, what makes Big Fat Liar stand out from something like Agent Cody Banks is Paul Giamatti as Marty Wolf. Giamatti is a delight in everything he is in, but his over-the-top take on a slimy movie producer is hilarious to both kids and adults. The image of a blue Giamatti has alone cemented Big Fat Liar as an early 2000s classic.





 6  Rachel McAdams &amp; Ryan Gosling As Allie &amp; Noah 
The Notebook


 







  The Notebook  
PG-13



  Release Date    June 25, 2004     Director    Nick Cassavetes     Cast    Ryan Gosling , Rachel McAdams , James Garner , Gena Rowlands , James Marsden , Kevin Connolly , Sam Shepard , Joan Allen     Runtime    124 Minutes     Story By    Nicholas Sparks     Distributor(s)    New Line Cinema    


Most adaptions of Nicholas Sparks’ books are critically panned upon release and fade from the public memory shortly after, except The Notebook which is still talked about and watched two decades later. Nothing about the story of The Notebook is inherently better than anything else Sparks has written, but the chemistry and charisma of the two leads are enough to make the movie a very watchable romance. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are two actors who can elevate any material given them and ar by far the best Nicholas Sparks couple.





 5  Robert De Niro As Dick Kelly 
Dirty Grandpa
        

  Dirty Grandpa  
R



  Release Date    January 20, 2016     Director    Dan Mazer     Cast    Dermot Mulroney , Aubrey Plaza , Robert De Niro , Julianne Hough , Jason Mantzoukas , Zoey Deutch , Zac Efron , Adam Pally     Runtime    102minutes     Writers    John Phillips     Studio(s)    Lionsgate    


In the latter part of his career, Robert De Niro has swung from starring in modern masterpieces like The Irishman or Killers of the Flower Moon and lending his star power to C-grade comedies like The War with Grandpa. Dirty Grandpa is by far the most irreverent and tasteless film De Niro has ever been in, but it goes so far that it almost becomes funny again. The script doesn&#39;t have well-written jokes, but it is undeniably funny to see De Niro in such outlandish situations, and the film would be infinitely more painful with another actor.
Dirty Grandpa is now streaming on Netflix 






 4  Owen Wilson As Jedediah 
Night At The Museum


 







  Night at the Museum  
pg



  Release Date    December 17, 2006     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Ben Stiller , Owen Wilson , Robin Williams , Rami Malek , Dick Van Dyke     Runtime    108minutes     Writers    Shawn Levy     Studio(s)    20th Century    


Owen Wilson&#39;s role in Night at the Museum was originally intended to only be a cameo, and he is in fact not credited in the first movie at all. However, the character was so popular, that his role wasn&#39;t only expanded, he became one of the faces of the franchise. The first Night at the Museum is an average execution of a great premise, but Wilson as Jedediah walks away with the movie. Wilson is hilarious as usual, but he is also the actor most locked into the premise of the movie and sells the mythical realism of being a tiny cowboy better than anyone could.





 3  Nicolas Cage As Nick Cage 
The Unbearable Weight Of Massive Talent
        

  The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent  
R



  Release Date    April 22, 2022     Director    Tom Gormican     Cast    Jacob Scipio , Pedro Pascal , with Neil Patrick Harris , Ike Barinholtz , Tiffany Haddish , Lily Sheen , Nicolas Cage , Alessandra Mastronardi , Neil Patrick Harris , Sharon Horgan     Runtime    107 minutes     Writers    Kevin Etten , Tom Gormican     Studio(s)    Lionsgate    


The entire premise of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent is that Nicolas Cage plays a fictional version of himself, so obviously his casting is important, but Cage turns in a shockingly good performance as himself. The film&#39;s script is a surface-level satire on the star&#39;s image, but Cage doesn&#39;t play the movie as a joke, instead trying to find some real pathos in this cartoon version of himself. While the movie may waste the central premise, Cage is too good for the role, as he doesn&#39;t go for the easy laughs, instead making what could have been a joke of a movie into an interesting chapter of his filmography.





 2  Joaquin Phoenix As Arthur Fleck 
Joker


 







  Joker  
R



  Release Date    October 4, 2019     Director    Todd Phillips     Cast    Joaquin Phoenix , Robert De Niro , Zazie Beetz , Frances Conroy     Runtime    122 minutes     Writers    Todd Phillips , Scott Silver     Distributor(s)    Warner Bros. Pictures    


Joker surprised the entire world when it ended up grossing over a billion dollars and became an awards season player, and most of the film&#39;s success must be attributed to Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s central performance. Todd Phillips&#39; take on the DC Comics character is a rather superficial retread of early Scorsese films, but Phoenix manages to find something interesting in the character and give a new and exciting take on the clown prince of crime. Completely avoiding previous takes on the character, Joker becomes a one-man show for Phoenix, and his commitment to the character gives the film more gravitas and meaning than it has on the page.





 1  Kristen Stewart As Bella Swan 
Twilight


 







  Twilight  
PG-13



  Release Date    November 21, 2008     Director    Catherine Hardwicke     Cast    Robert Pattinson , Ashley Greene , Peter Facinelli , Rachelle Lefevre , Elizabeth Reaser , Kristen Stewart , Nikki Reed , Jackson Rathbone , Cam Gigandet , Kellan Lutz , Taylor Lautner , Anna Kendrick , Billy Burke     Runtime    121 minutes     Writers    Melissa Rosenberg    


The internet unfairly ganged up on Kristen Stewart after the release of Twilight, mocking the actor&#39;s performance as Bella Swan. While Twilight was never high art, she actually made the films better with her awkward performance as a young teenager. Recent comments about Twilight by Kristen Stewart show that she understood what was appealing about the story more than anyone else involved, and she came to the character of Bella with a real take and performance. Bella Swan could have easily been a paycheck role for Stewart, but she put in the effort and made Twilight a cultural phenomenon.
