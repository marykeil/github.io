# Another Avengers Replacement Could Bring Back 2 Underused MCU Heroes &amp; Solve A Huge Phase 5 Issue


## SUMMARY 



  A rumored UK Avengers team could bring back underused characters like Kit Harrington&#39;s Dane Whitman and Olivia Colman&#39;s Sonya Falsworth, providing an interesting alternative to the Avengers.   This new team would also solve the problem of G&#39;iah, the MCU&#39;s most overpowered hero, by limiting her impact on the main Avengers and keeping the power balance intact.   With Falsworth proposing a partnership to G&#39;iah in Secret Invasion, it is likely that Emilia Clarke&#39;s character will be involved with the UK Avengers team if it becomes a reality.

## Literature Review



A perfect Avengers replacement team would bring back two underused Marvel Cinematic Universe characters and fix a major problem that was created by the MCU&#39;s Phase 5. While Marvel&#39;s Avengers movies will soon make a return, with Phase 6 set to count with two new adventures for Earth&#39;s Mightiest Heroes — 2026&#39;s Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and 2027&#39;s Avengers: Secret Wars — the team will not be the only one in the MCU&#39;s future. Thunderbolts is already set to unite multiple Marvel anti-heroes in 2025, providing an exciting alternative for the Avengers.




Thunderbolts might not be the only upcoming MCU movie or series to feature a new team that serves as an alternative to the Avengers, as rumors have pointed to another team of heroes possibly assembling in the near future. Given how many characters Marvel has introduced in recent years, having multiple teams would be the best way to move forward for the MCU, as it would allow Marvel to deal with the criticism that many characters disappear for years or only have cameos with not further appearances. Now, a new rumor suggests an Avengers replacement team could be on the way, bringing back underused characters.

 A British Avengers Team Could Bring Back 2 Underused Favourites 
          




The latest MCU rumor claims that a UK team might be making its way into the MCU soon. If that were to happen, Marvel could do right by two underused characters. A British Avengers team could finally see Kit Harrington&#39;s Dane Whitman ditch his regular clothes to don armor and the Ebony Blade, becoming the Black Knight like was teased in one of Eternals&#39; post-credits scenes. If the UK Avengers were to form, then they would need their own version of Nick Fury, and thankfully, the MCU already has the perfect choice.

While Disney&#43;&#39;s Secret Invasion was not the success Marvel expected it to be, the MCU series added an incredibly entertaining character in the form of Olivia Colman&#39;s Sonya Falsworth. Colman&#39;s character proved to be every bit as smart and mysterious as Samuel L. Jackson&#39;s Nick Fury was in his heyday. Falsworth did not mind getting a little blood on her hands, always keeping her end goal in mind. Bringing back Whitman, who was one of the fan favorites of Eternals despite his short role, and Falsworth, one of the few bright spots of Secret Invasion, would make the UK Avengers an interesting team.






 The UK Avengers Could Give G&#39;iah Something To Do 
          

A UK Avengers team could also solve a major problem that was created by the MCU&#39;s Phase 5. In Secret Invasion, Emilia Clarke&#39;s G&#39;iah became the MCU&#39;s most overpowered hero, as her Super-Skrull abilities allow her to use the powers of pretty much every major MCU character. Having G&#39;iah appear only in a possible UK Avengers franchise would limit her impact on the rest of the MCU, keeping the power balance of the main Avengers intact. With Secret Invasion&#39;s ending showing Falsworth proposing a partnership to G&#39;iah, if a UK Avengers team becomes a reality, Clarke&#39;s G&#39;iah will likely be involved with it.
