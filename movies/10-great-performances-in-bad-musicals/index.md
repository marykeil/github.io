## Literature Review

Despite being notorious for criticism from critics and fans alike, these musicals still showcase some truly exceptional performances.




Musicals, one of the most beloved genres in Hollywood, have produced some great performances even in bad movies. Full of enchanting performances, catchy songs, and dazzling theatrics, it&#39;s easy to see why they are so popular. When done well, they can be extraordinary, but not all musicals hit the mark. Over the years, some have failed to resonate with critics and audiences. But even in less successful musicals, there can be outstanding performances by actors that make them worth watching. These performances shine through and past the bad elements of the film and provide a reminder of the great skill and talent it takes to deliver a stellar musical performance.
Movies like The Sound of Music, West Side Story, and Mary Poppins have been named as some of the best musicals of all time. However, even if a musical is considered a failure by critics or at the box office, the performances in it can still be exceptional. When an actor delivers a great performance, it&#39;s hard not to be captivated, even if the overall production is disappointing. This just goes to show that standout talent can shine through in any setting, even turning a less popular musical into something special. This redeeming quality can even make some of the worst musicals enjoyable to watch.









 








 10  Maddie Ziegler Gives It Her All 
Music (2021)
        

Co-directed by singer and songwriter Sia, Music follows the story of a non-speaking autistic girl named Music. The film focuses on the relationship between a newly sober drug dealer (Kate Hudson) and her autistic sister. Music failed to perform at the box office, grossing only a sliver of its initial budget. The film was also slated by critics for being insensitive and distasteful in its portrayal of autism. Sia faced criticism due to her insensitivity towards individuals with disabilities, and many accused the film of actually being harmful in its portrayal of autism. Nonetheless, Maddie Ziegler gives it her all as Music, truly committing to the character in her performance.
Music can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 9  Gene Kelly Is A Timeless Talent 
Xanadu (1980)
        

Gene Kelly&#39;s final film appearance in the 1980 musical fantasy Xanadu showcases his timeless talent despite the movie&#39;s critical failure. In the film, he plays Danny McGuire, a 1940s big band musician turned businessman who partners with the protagonist, Sonny, to create a nightclub. This story combines elements of 1940s MGM musicals and 1980s New Wave, complete with Greek muses on roller skates. At the age of 67, Kelly even roller-skated himself. Kelly&#39;s performance, combined with the fantastic choreography and special effects, adds a unique charm to the film. Over time, Xanadu has gained cult status and has become one of those must-see musical movies.
Xanadu can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 8  Kelly Clarkson&#39;s Impressive Vocal Abilities Are On Full Display 
From Justin to Kelly (2003)
        

Kelly Clarkson&#39;s only acting role was a reflection of her career&#39;s trajectory - it wasn&#39;t headed anywhere. The musical comedy From Justin to Kelly was poorly received when it was released in 2003, and it didn&#39;t do justice to Kelly&#39;s talents. Kelly even admitted that she didn&#39;t want to win American Idol initially because she knew it would mean starring in this movie. The film was heavily criticized for lacking a clear direction and being strangely cartoonish. Not even Kelly&#39;s charm and vocal abilities were able to save the film from its harsh reception, and she didn&#39;t go on to pursue more acting roles.
From Justin to Kelly can be streamed on Amazon Prime Video. 






 7  Michelle Pfeiffer Portrays A Strong Female Protagonist With Great Ease 
Grease 2 (1982)


 







When it was originally released, Grease 2 was slammed by critics for not bringing anything new to the franchise. Despite its commercial and critical failure, Michelle Pfeiffer&#39;s performance stands out. Playing the role of Pink Lady Stephanie Zinone, Pfeiffer brings a new, stronger, and independent female character to the franchise. Unlike Sandy from the original Grease, her character challenges traditional gender roles by rejecting the notion of changing herself for a man. This aspect of her performance, along with the movie&#39;s more progressive themes, resonated with more modern audiences over time.
Grease 2 can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 6  Cher Cements Herself As An Entertainment Legend 
Burlesque (2010)
        

The 2010 musical Burlesque, despite not initially getting the recognition it deserved in Hollywood, has since become a cult classic. The film marked Christina Aguilera&#39;s first major movie role and was also the first screen musical for Cher. Cher plays Tess, the tough owner of a glamorous but struggling Los Angeles club who mentors the main character, Ali (Christina Aguilera). Her powerful vocal performances, particularly in numbers like &#34;You Haven&#39;t Seen the Last of Me,&#34; are some of the film&#39;s most iconic moments. The film provides a stage for Cher&#39;s unique voice and definitely cements her legendary status in the entertainment industry.
Burlesque can be streamed on Netflix. 






 5  Francesca Hayward&#39;s Background As A Ballerina Shines Through IHer Performance 
Cats (2019)
        

  Cats  


  Release Date    December 20, 2019     Director    Tom Hooper     Cast    Rebel Wilson , Jennifer Hudson , Robbie Fairchild , Idris Elba , Taylor Swift , Laurie Davidson , Zizi Strallen , Ray Winstone , Ian McKellen , Jason DeRulo , judi dench , James Corden , Mette Towley     Rating    PG    


Tom Hooper&#39;s film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s musical Cats was a catastrophic failure, hated by both critics and viewers alike despite its cast of A-list stars. In the film, Francesca Hayward, a principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, stars as the abandoned white kitten Victoria. The bizarre digitally animated fur of the cats in the musical particularly disturbed viewers, creating a sort of uncanny valley. Despite the heavy use of digital effects, Hayward&#39;s exceptional ballet prowess shines through, showcasing her exquisite and precise movements, even through all the chaos. However, not even a trained ballerina could save this movie from a critical catastrophe.





 4  Daniel Day-Lewis Displays His Acting Versatility 
Nine (2009)
        

Nine is a musical film adaptation of Federico Fellini&#39;s 8 1/2, focusing on the life of Guido Contini, a famous Italian director. Daniel Day-Lewis excels as the struggling artist. Despite the film&#39;s mixed reviews from critics and audiences, Day-Lewis&#39;s performance, distinct from his previous roles, shows a vulnerable, subdued Guido struggling with scriptwriting pressure. His singing and dancing are captivating and blend well with the film&#39;s artistic style. The role even landed Day-Lewis a nomination for a Golden Globe. Day-Lewis has a habit of continuously playing unique and complicated characters, delivering an exceptional performance every time.
Nine can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 3  Quvenzhané Wallis Showcases Her Remarkable Talents At A Young Age 
Annie (2014)
        

  Annie  


  Release Date    December 25, 2014     Director    Will Gluck     Cast    Rose Byrne , Cameron Diaz , Quvenzhané Wallis , Bobby Cannavale , Jamie Foxx     Rating    pg    


Quvenzhané Wallis, at only 11, shines in the 2014 Annie remake. The role even earned her a Golden Globe nomination. Her performance, following an Oscar-nominated role in Beasts of the Southern Wild, brings fresh energy to the classic musical, now set in a modern, social-media-driven New York. Wallis&#39;s portrayal of Annie stands out for its maturity and charm, especially for such a young talent. Her ability to enthrall audiences helps lift the film&#39;s overall message of optimism. Despite delivering a wonderful performance, Wallis failed to elevate the film&#39;s standing among critics, some even hailing her as the best part of the movie.





 2  Tom Cruise Perfectly Embodies The Persona Of An &#39;80s Rockstar 
Rock of Ages (2012)


 







Despite the film&#39;s overall critical and commercial failure, Tom Cruise delivers a standout performance as Stacee Jaxx in Rock of Ages. His portrayal of the over-the-top rock star, complete with enthusiastic renditions of classic rock songs like Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar on Me,” brings a punchy edginess that adds so much life to the film. Cruise captures the essence of an &#39;80s rock band frontman with infectious energy, embodying the extreme traits of real-life rock stars like Axl Rose and Steven Tyler. With his transformed physical appearance, Cruises embodies the role, and his performance is a highlight in a movie that otherwise didn&#39;t meet expectations.
Rock of Ages can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video. 






 1  Emmy Rossum&#39;s Portrayal of Christine Is Outstanding 
Phantom of the Opera (2004)


 







Joel Schumacher&#39;s adaptation of Andrew Llyod Webber&#39;s Phantom of the Opera was slated by critics for being boring, melodramatic, and unimpressive. Despite such scathing reviews, Emmy Rossum&#39;s portrayal of Christine is remarkable. Her performance brilliantly captures Christine&#39;s innocence, grace, emotional journey, and seduction by the Phantom. Rossum&#39;s singing, particularly in &#34;Think of Me,&#34; is stunning and demonstrates her immense skill, even rivaling many stage renditions of the character. Rossum&#39;s stage presence and nuanced portrayal of Christine secure her place among the greatest to ever play the role.
The Phantom of the Opera can be streamed on Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video.
