# 1 Incredible Western Book Could Be The Next Brokeback Mountain (But Better)


## SUMMARY 



The Western genre has experienced a resurgence in recent years and is enjoying newfound popularity, with new twists and unique stories being told.

&#34;Whiskey When We&#39;re Dry&#34; is a novel that stands out in the Western tradition and could provide a daring exploration of queer identity in the genre, potentially surpassing &#34;Brokeback Mountain.&#34;

While there are plans to adapt &#34;Whiskey When We&#39;re Dry&#34; into a movie or TV show, there is currently no news regarding its adaptation, and it is unlikely to happen soon due to the busy schedule of the writers/producers who acquired the rights.

## Literature Review
The Western genre has enjoyed a modern resurgence, but one modern book adaptation would surpass Brokeback Mountain in its daring spin on the Western.
