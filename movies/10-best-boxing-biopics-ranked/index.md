## Literature Review

Boxing movies are known for their engaging action and compelling drama as well as their ability to continue a decorated or underrated boxer&#39;s legacy.




Boxing biopics are among some of the best sports movies based on real-life events, and they&#39;ve earned such a distinction by weaving in the tense, adrenaline-fueled action of the sport with the often tumultuous and dramatic lives of the real-life people the films are based on. Furthermore, boxing biopics tend to be far more grounded and rooted in reality than most other sports movies, since many of the biopics made in the genre are based on well-documented events. While the entertainment industry has to take some liberties with the source material to translate the real-life drama into more compelling filmmaking, boxing biopics are still a cut above the rest.
Similar to any other biopic in the sports movie genre, filmmakers typically have a much easier time developing fictitious stories based on real-life athletes, since they can better manipulate the onscreen drama and facts without facing any backlash about insincerely portraying its events. Biopics - or more specifically, boxing biopics world, have a much more difficult time attaining success because the athletes are typically well-respected globally, and it is far more challenging to tell an exciting story without sensationalizing the real-life events depicted. Nevertheless, Hollywood has produced a few quality boxing biopics that successfully strike a balance between compelling movie drama and a healthy respect for historical accuracy.

Michael Jai White stars as Mike &#34;Iron Mike&#34; Tyson in the TV Movie Tyson
        

Directed by Uli Edel, Tyson is a 1995 made-for-TV movie that sees martial arts star and prolific B-movie actor Michael Jai White in the role of the former world heavyweight boxing champion, Mike &#34;Iron Mike&#34; Tyson. The movie chronicles Tyson&#39;s troubled upbringing navigating the rough streets of New York City, to becoming the youngest heavyweight boxing champion ever, to his unfortunate fall from grace and imprisonment. Although Mike Tyson is one of the most respected figures in the world of boxing, his tumultuous personal life and the toxic relationship between himself and former promoter Don King are covered extensively in a movie that humanizes Tyson without vilifying him.





 9  Chuck (2016) 
Liev Schreiber stars as one of Muhammad Ali&#39;s rivals Chuck Wepner in Philippe Falardeau&#39;s Chuck
        

Inspired by the 1975 heavyweight bout between Muhammad Ali and Chuck Wepner, Chuck centers around a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the then relatively unknown Wepner to fight against Ali in a fight that was predicted to end within three rounds in Ali&#39;s favor. However, despite losing in the last round, the resolve that Wepner displays makes him a local hero to his community while also inspiring a young Sylvester Stallone to write the screenplay for Rocky. Although Wepner lets the fame get to his head, thus resulting in drug use and prison time, Chuck is ultimately an endearing story about beating the odds through sheer belief in oneself.





 8  Big George Foreman (2023) 
Khris Davis stars as &#34;Big&#34; George Foreman in George Tillman Jr.&#39;s Big George Foreman

Despite everyone telling Foreman to retire and pursue other avenues, he displays an uncanny resolve and beats a heavyweight champion half his age, thus displaying anything is possible.

Blending well-choreographed boxing scenes with engaging drama, Hands of Stone benefits from stellar performances and a formulaic story that&#39;s broken up with emphasis on the lives and challenges of more than just its protagonist, thus making it a unique entry in the boxing biopic genre.

While Smith lacks the appropriate energy and charisma that Ali proudly boasted, he captures the essence of the former champion in a sincere retelling of some of the icon&#39;s most important moments inside and outside the right. Moreover, Mann&#39;s masterful direction of the source material and attention-to-detail combined with Emmanuel Lubenezki&#39;s rich cinematography and the inspired performances of the supporting cast make Ali one of the most faithful boxing biopics in the genre.
