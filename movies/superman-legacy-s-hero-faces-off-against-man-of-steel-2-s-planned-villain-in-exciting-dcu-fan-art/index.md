# Superman Legacy s Hero Faces Off Against Man Of Steel 2 s Planned Villain In Exciting DCU Fan Art


## SUMMARY 



  New DC fan art imagines David Corenswet&#39;s new Superman facing off against comics villain Brainiac.   Brainiac should be the main villain in Superman: Legacy, as he has yet to be featured in a central role in any previous Superman films.   Bringing Brainiac to life in Superman: Legacy would open up the possibility for him to become a future Justice League villain in the DC Universe.

## Literature Review

As David Corenswet&#39;s Superman: Legacy will be the first prominent DC Universe movie, Brainiac gets pitched as the main villain in new fan art.




Brainiac takes on David Corenswet&#39;s Man of Steel in new Superman: Legacy fan art, showing what he could look like in the DC Universe. With the Superman: Legacy cast now mostly set, the new DC Universe by James Gunn and Peter Safran is getting closer to release. While plot details are still being kept under wraps, Superman: Legacy will focus on Clark being early into his superhero career.




With Superman: Legacy advancing through pre-production, one thing remains unclear: whether Nicholas Hoult&#39;s Lex Luthor will be the only villain or if there&#39;s another threat yet to be unveiled. As such, the DC Universe audience is actively speculating who will be the actual villain in the film. Abraham Knapp and Arifinity collaborated on a new Superman: Legacy art piece, picturing Corenswet in the suit, but also who would be his first DC Universe villain.


 

In this scenario, the iconic Superman villain, Brainiac, takes on Krypton&#39;s last son in the Superman: Legacy artwork. Brainiac was reportedly going to be the main baddie in Man of Steel 2 when Warner Bros. Discovery was looking to continue with Henry Cavill&#39;s version of the DC icon in the DCEU.




                  26 DCU Rumors That James Gunn Has Debunked So Farâ€¨   James Gunn has been very active on social media as DC Studios&#39; co-CEO, and he has debunked several major DCU rumors about Superman, Batman, and more.   


 Why Superman: Legacy Should Feature Brainiac As The Main Villain 
         

While it remains to be seen who is actually serving as the main foe in Superman: Legacy, Brainiac would be the ideal candidate. Even though there have been several Superman movies, Brainiac has yet to be featured as the central villain. On the small screen, however, several Superman live-action TV shows have featured Brainiac and shown what a creative team can do with him when he gets the spotlight.

Even in animated DC movies, Brainiac has been able to thrive and demonstrate the danger of his world-collecting, which would be fascinating to see adapted for Superman: Legacy. With this being the first Superman movie in almost a decade since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Superman: Legacy will need a major big bad as an impact. There are also ways for Brainiac to come back to the DC Universe down the line after Superman: Legacy, as he could serve as a future Justice League villain.






Following Nicholas Hoult&#39;s official casting as Lex Luthor, it is still unclear if he is the main enemy in Superman: Legacy.




Whoever ends up being Superman: Legacy&#39;s big bad will hopefully be someone who hasn&#39;t already filled that role in past Superman movies. With such rich lore in the comics, seeing Gunn bring Brainiac to life would be interesting, as there are a lot of directions he can go with him. Since Superman: Legacy will start principal photography in March, the world will hopefully know sooner rather than later which villains Clark will be facing in his DC Universe adventure.
