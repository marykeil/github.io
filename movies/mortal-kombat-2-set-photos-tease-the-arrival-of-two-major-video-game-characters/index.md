## Literature Review

Mortal Kombat 2 producer Todd Garner teases the arrival of two major video game characters in the upcoming sequel via some exciting new set photos.




A pair of new photos from the set of Mortal Kombat 2 has teased the arrival of two of the franchise’s biggest characters. Based on the hit video game series, Mortal Kombat 2 serves as the follow-up to the 2021 reboot that starred Lewis Tan, Jessica McNamee, and Josh Lawson as a group of Earthrealm warriors targeted by the sorcerer Shang Tsung before they can compete in the titular interdimensional martial arts contest. While the first movie introduced several key characters from the video games, Mortal Kombat 2 is also set to feature characters such as Johnny Cage, Shao Kahn, and Kitana.




Most recently, producer Todd Garner shared some new photos from the Mortal Kombat 2 set teasing the weapons of Shao Kahn and his adopted daughter Kitana.


 

The first image gives a close-up glimpse of Kitana’s instantly recognizable razor-edged steel fans.


 

Meanwhile, the producer also followed up with a photo of Kahn’s signature weapon, the giant maul referred to in the games&#39; lore as the “Wrath Hammer.”


 How Shao Kahn &amp; Kitana’s Introduction Will Deepen Mortal Kombat 2’s Story 
          




While Karl Urban’s debut as Johnny Cage is highly anticipated, it is the introduction of Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn and his adopted daughter that makes for the most dramatic storytelling possibilities. Initially based on Emperor Palpatine from the original Star Wars trilogy, Mortal Kombat game co-creator John Tobias wanted to introduce a mysterious ruler who stood behind the first game’s primary villain, Shang Tsung. Making his own debut as the final boss in 1993’s Mortal Kombat II, Kahn’s imposing physical form and immense strength were also supported by a rich backstory that became central to the continuing lore.

Foreshadowing the apocalyptic fate currently facing Earthrealm, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn once conquered Kitana&#39;s native realm, Edenia, after it too had lost ten successive Mortal Kombat tournaments. Slaying Edenia’s King Jerrod and claiming his widow Sindel for his own, Kahn adopted the young princess Kitana and raised her to become his personal assassin. As an added measure, Kahn also ordered Shang Tsung to create a disfigured clone of Kitana, named Mileena, whose role was to spy on the young princess and ensure her continuing loyalty.






Mileena appeared briefly in 2021&#39;s Mortal Kombat, played by Sisi Stringer.




While Shao Kahn’s previous live-action debut in 1997’s Mortal Kombat Annihilation largely fell flat with audiences, Mortal Kombat 2 has the potential to provide a far more faithful look at the Outworld villain and his adopted daughter. With the 2021 movie only scratching the surface of the games’ rich background lore, with any luck the sequel will be able to leverage its new characters and explore some of the more fascinating stories to come out of the original games.
