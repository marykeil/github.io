## Literature Review

Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes may not be canon to the original Planet of the Apes movies, but the trailer has already established one connection.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes may not be canon to the franchise&#39;s first films, but the movie already has one subtle link to the original 1968 Planet of the Apes movie. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the fourth entry in the modern Planet of the Apes reboot series, which is the origin of how the apes overtook the planet long before the original Planet of the Apes movies. However, the timelines of both canons have slowly been inching closer, with Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes establishing one firm connection to the sci-fi classic.




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the upcoming continuation of Matt Reeves&#39; Planet of the Apes trilogy, although there are some key differences. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&#39; timeline placement is set many years after War for the Planet of the Apes, with a lot of time having passed since Caesar&#39;s death. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will follow new characters in a much more advanced ape civilization, with the titular kingdom seeming much closer to the planet from the original 1968 film than ever before.

                  Every Single Planet Of The Apes Movie (In Chronological Order)   The Planet of the Apes timeline is a bit confusing, so we arranged them in their proper chronological order   


 Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes&#39; Beach Setting Is Similar To The 1968 Movie 
         




Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&#39; trailer has shown off a lot of exciting new locations, but one setting looks eerily familiar to fans of the franchise. One prominently featured setting is a beach, with it seeming as if a good chunk of the film is going to take place there. This beach seems incredibly similar to the beach from the end of the original Planet of the Apes movie, on which astronaut George Taylor finds the Statue of Liberty buried in the sand.

It has not been confirmed if Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&#39; beach setting is the same one that is seen in the 1968 film&#39;s iconic ending, but it is entirely possible. While the previous three Planet of the Apes movies mostly take place around San Francisco, it is expected that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes will take place in all kinds of different locations. It could be that Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes&#39; main characters find their way to New York, with the Statue of Liberty already being buried in the sand.






 Kingdom Of The Planet Of The Apes Could Pull Off Another Statue Of Liberty Twist Now 
          

The Statue of Liberty&#39;s appearance in the 1968 original film was the first reveal that the planet of the apes was actually a post-apocalyptic Earth. While it is already known that the apes have taken over Earth in the modern Planet of the Apes movies, this setting and iconography can still be used in a big way in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.

The Statue of Liberty at the beach could be a major setting in Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, with a nearby ape civilization possibly using it for shelter or as a defensive tower. An action setpiece centered around a destroyed Statue of Liberty would be a fun way to recontextualize the original scene while still paying homage to it. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes would still have to explain why the Statue of Liberty was destroyed, however, as well as how it wound up on a beach.




              Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes  Set several years after the events of War for the Planet of the Apes, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the next installment in the Apes saga. Ape clans have taken up residence in the oasis that Caesar sought to colonize, but humans have reverted to their animalistic nature in their absence. Now battling between enslavement and freedom, outliers in the Ape clans will take sides in a newly burgeoning society.
