## Literature Review

The horror mavens at Blumhouse are producing a film adaptation of the popular survival game Dead By Daylight, and terrifying updates are rolling in.




The popular survival horror video game Dead by Daylight is coming to the big screen, and the brilliant minds at Blumhouse are involved in the adaptation. First released in 2016 and developed by Behaviour Interactive, the simple but effective game casts players as either a survivor or a slasher, and they must live to the end of the round or wipe out the victims in as many clever and gruesome ways as possible. One of the pioneering games of the asymmetric multiplayer survival genre, Dead by Daylight has become a pop culture phenomenon.




Though the gameplay and objectives are quite simple, the franchise has remained fresh thanks to the inclusion of iconic slashers from movies, and brand-new story chapters that keep the scares coming. Besides the tongue-in-cheek dating sim game Hooked On You, the Dead by Daylight franchise has expanded into other forms of media such as comic books, and plans are in the works for more spinoff games soon. Now, Blumhouse is opting to bring Dead by Daylight to the big screen, possibly cashing in on the smashing success of their Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie.


 The Dead By Daylight Movie Latest News 
          

After announcing the project in early 2023, Blumhouse has been rather tight-lipped, but now the latest news sees the Dead by Daylight movie get a promising update from the horror studio. Blumhouse Vice President Ryan Turek spoke at length about their planned video game adaptation and reassured fans that active work is taking place. &#34;I will say that one of the projects that I&#39;m active on is Dead by Daylight,&#34; said Turek, &#34;I look at that as the celebration of horror that the video game itself is&#34;.




Taking a page from Blumhouse&#39;s wildly popular Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s adaptation, the studio wants to recreate that success with another simple horror game, Dead by Daylight. Based on Turek&#39;s comments, Blumhouse believes that fan service is the key to a good video game adaptation, and the VP stressed that the movie is being designed to cater to fans of the video game.



 The Dead By Daylight Movie Is Confirmed 
          

Blumhouse officially announced their Dead by Daylight movie adaptation back in March 2023, but there was almost nothing by way of updates throughout that year. The studio is constantly churning out horror hit after horror hit, but 2023 saw Blumhouse strike gold in an unusual way. Blumhouse&#39;s long-gestating Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s movie was released on Peacock to surprisingly positive reviews, and that may have emboldened the studio to move forward with their Dead by Daylight plans.






 Who Is Making The Dead By Daylight Movie? 
          

Though a director and cast haven&#39;t been attached to the fledgling project yet, big names are still involved with the Dead by Daylight movie adaptation. Blumhouse, the studio behind hit film franchises like Insidious and The Purge, will be at the helm, and they are partnering with horror maven James Wan&#39;s company Atomic Monster. Most importantly, Blumhouse and Atomic Monster are partnering with Behaviour Interactive to develop the film, the studio that created the Dead by Daylight game.



 The Dead By Daylight Movie Story Details 
          

Nothing has been announced about the story for the Dead by Daylight film adaptation, but it&#39;s safe to say it will focus on the game&#39;s original characters and not any of the movie and TV icons the game is known for. While the basic slasher plot is easy to bring to life on screen, the movie will flourish if it fleshes out the mysterious entity that haunts the game. The lore of the Dead by Daylight franchise is its strongest aspect, and the Five Nights at Freddy&#39;s adaptation soared because it was a love letter to the games.
