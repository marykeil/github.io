## Literature Review

Women have long since played a critical role in bringing the galaxy far, far to life. It&#39;s about time that one of them directed a Star Wars movie.




Since the beginning of a galaxy far, far away, women have been shaping the franchise, which is why it&#39;s time for a woman to direct a Star Wars movie. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, director of the upcoming Star Wars: New Jedi Order, will be the first woman to direct a Star Wars movie. New Jedi Order will take place 15 years after the events of Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker and will focus on Rey Skywalker as she works to rebuild the Jedi Order. When asked about the film, Obaid-Chinoy made the following statement:





I&#39;m very thrilled about the project because I feel what we&#39;re about to create is something very special. And we&#39;re in 2024 now, and it&#39;s about time that we had a woman come forward to shape a story in a galaxy far, far away.


Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s statement has become controversial. The reason for this focuses on the second sentence. Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s words imply that her introduction as director marks the first time that a woman has (at least significantly) influenced a Star Wars story. However, many people have disagreed with this idea, and for good reason.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.   


 Star Wars Has Always Been Shaped By Women 
         




Not only has Star Wars always had complex, strong female characters such as Princess Leia Organa and Ahsoka Tano, but female staff have also been influential since the conception of a galaxy far, far away. For example, George Lucas&#39; ex-wife, Marcia Lucas, worked as an editor on the original trilogy. As an editor, she did far more than just cut scenes together; she shaped the narrative of Star Wars. She was willing to tell George Lucas when she thought he was wrong, and she was key to ensuring that many of the small, intimate moments that make Star Wars more than just an action movie stayed in the final cut.

Marcia was the one who insisted that the scene where Chewbacca yells at a small droid, causing it to squeal and zoom away, was included in the movie. She was also the one who made sure that Leia&#39;s Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope good luck kiss stayed in the movie. She continues to have a strong emotional connection to the franchise despite no longer working on it. She was devastated when she first watched Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace because she didn&#39;t think it was a very good movie, and that broke her heart. She wasn&#39;t a fan of the sequel trilogy, either.




Marcia Lucas wasn&#39;t the only woman who shaped Star Wars. A woman named Leigh Brackett wrote the original screenplay for Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back. Tragically, Brackett died of cancer before the screenplay was finalized. George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan used Brackett&#39;s screenplay as a jumping-off point for the creation of the final script. Further, while Brackett and Marcia are two important examples, they are far from the only women who have shaped Star Wars. Women have been involved throughout every movie and TV show in the franchise.



 Women Have Led Star Wars&#39; TV Shows As Well 
          

Not only have women had a profound influence on Star Wars movies since the beginning of a galaxy far, far away, but they continue to lead Star Wars TV shows. For example, Kiri Hart, the Senior Vice President of Development at Lucasfilm, was a producer on Star Wars Rebels. Carrie Beck, the Vice President of Lucasfilm Animation and a member of Lucasfilm Story Group, has worked on several Star Wars TV shows. These are only two of the many influential women who have helped make Star Wars TV shows happen.




Despite their important contributions, very few women have acted as directors on Star Wars TV shows. There have only been three so far: The Mandalorian director Bryce Dallas Howard, The Mandalorian and Obi-Wan Kenobi director Deborah Chow, and The Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka director Steph Green. Leslye Headland, showrunner for the upcoming show The Acolyte, will be the first female showrunner on a Star Wars TV show. While Headland proves that directors aren&#39;t replacing showrunners on all projects, it&#39;s still clear that directors are taking on a bigger role. Because directors seem to be taking on more responsibility, having more female directors would be a big step for the Star Wars TV universe.



 It&#39;s (Past) Time For A Woman To Direct A Star Wars Movie 
          

Given that Bryce Dallas Howard, Deborah Chow, Steph Green, and Leslye Headland have all directed or run Star Wars TV shows, it is odd that a woman has yet to direct a Star Wars movie. While Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is wrong about women&#39;s influence on Star Wars, she isn&#39;t wrong that having a woman directing a Star Wars movie is exciting. With so much content within the franchise, four female directors/showrunners is a minuscule number. Since Hollywood hired fewer female directors in 2023 than in 2022, it is a step forward for Disney to make an effort to include more female directors in a galaxy far, far away.




When Obaid-Chinoy&#39;s New Jedi Order movie will be released is not known, although it is expected to come out sometime between 2025 and 2029. Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy has confirmed the movie will be about the Jedi in crisis as the galaxy tries to decide if the Order is necessary or more trouble than it&#39;s worth given decades of war. This description suggests a departure from the typical Star Wars story, as up until now, the franchise has focused heavily on the necessity of the Order, despite its faults. This could offer a fresh perspective, and it will be interesting to see where Obaid-Chinoy takes her Star Wars story.



All Star Wars movies and TV shows are available to stream on Disney&#43;.




              Star Wars: New Jedi Order  The tenth mainline installment in the Star Wars franchise is the first movie to follow the sequel trilogy, where Mark Hamill&#39;s Luke, Carrie Fisher&#39;s Leia, and Harrison Ford&#39;s Han Solo gave their final farewell. After the release of The Rise of Skywalker, development on a direct sequel had become dormant as Disney shifted focus on other parts of the galaxy, namely, Disney&#43; shows such as The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ahsoka. However, a movie starring Daisy Ridley as Rey Skywalker was officially announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023.
