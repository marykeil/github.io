## Literature Review

After years of development hell, a Bride of Frankenstein remake is getting positive updates, as Maggie Gyllenhaal is directing the Warner Bros. movie.




Universal has been trying to get a Bride of Frankenstein movie off the ground for years, but now there&#39;s been some long-awaited Bride of Frankenstein remake news as the production finally finds new life. The original Bride of Frankenstein movie was released in 1935. It sees Dr. Frankenstein being forced to return to his monstrous experiments, and this time, he creates a bride for his first creation. The Frankenstein&#39;s Bride character is just as well-known as Frankenstein&#39;s Monster, if not more so. Her makeup and hairstyle with lightning streaks have made The Bride iconic and an LGBTQ&#43; icon, so it&#39;s unsurprising that Universal has tried so hard to remake the film.




The closest the studio came to making the remake was with the Universal Dark Universe, a cinematic universe planned to include several iconic monsters such as Dracula, The Wolfman, The Mummy, and many others. The Bride of Frankenstein was one of them, and a remake within the Dark Universe had entered early conceptual development. However, after the critical and commercial failure of 2017&#39;s The Mummy, all Universal Dark Universe plans were instantly canceled. Thankfully, another Bride of Frankenstein project is in the works, and the remake is in development once again.


 Bride Of Frankenstein Remake Most Recent News 
          

As the film has slowly progressed over the last year, the latest news is a major casting announcement for the Bride of Frankenstein remake. Multi-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening has officially joined the already star-studded cast, though no information about her character has been revealed. Bening joins the likes of Jessie Buckley and Christian Bale in the movie&#39;s impressive ensemble, but nothing is known about which characters from the original story will appear nor who will play them. 






 Bride Of Frankenstein Remake Is Confirmed 
          

The Bride of Frankenstein remake is confirmed, with Maggie Gyllenhaal attached to direct the long-awaited monster movie. Production on Maggie Gyllenhaal&#39;s Bride of Frankenstein movie is planned to start in early 2024, and the delay is likely due to the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes which brought Hollywood to a standstill throughout most of 2023. The confirmation comes as a surprise following years of development hell.



The WGA strike began in May 2023 and was resolved in September 2023, and the SAG-AFTRA strike began in July 2023 and was resolved in November 2023. 




Even Gyllenhaal&#39;s star-studded remake hit a stumbling block of its own as Netflix backed out of the project at some point in 2023. Fortunately, Warner Bros. swooped in to pick up the beleaguered remake, and the project is still slated to continue and has even added more big names to its ensemble. 






 Bride Of Frankenstein Remake Cast 
          

While not much has been revealed about the cast of the Bride of Frankenstein remake, a few huge Hollywood stars have already been attached to the project. First announced was Oscar winner Christian Bale (The Dark Knight), and the actor will be reuniting with former co-star Maggie Gyllenhaal who is directing the film and will presumably play a role as well. Peter Saarsgard is also attached to the project, along with Jessie Buckley and PenÃ©lope Cruz. In early 2024, multi-time Oscar nominee Annette Bening was added to the cast as well. At this juncture, no roles have been announced.



 Bride Of Frankenstein Story 
          




The story of the Bride of Frankenstein remake has long been speculated on, but it has now been officially confirmed that the standalone remake will not exclusively follow the plot of the original movie. Instead, Gyllenhaal&#39;s take on the Bride will be set in 1930s New York City and will see Dr. Frankenstein once again set out to create another patchwork being. This time, the story will focus more on the chaos caused by the bride, which is a far cry from her brief cameo in her eponymous 1935 film. More details are expected soon. 

               Bride of Frankenstein   Summary:   A reboot of Bride of Frankenstein. Plot details are currently unknown.    Director:   Bill Condon    Genres:   Horror    Writers:   David Koepp    Release Date:   1935-04-22    Cast:   Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester    Rating:   17&#43;    Runtime:   75minutes    Budget:   $397,000    Studio(s):   Universal Pictures    Distributor(s):   Universal Pictures
