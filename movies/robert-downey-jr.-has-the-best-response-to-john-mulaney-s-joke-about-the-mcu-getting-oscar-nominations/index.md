## Literature Review

John Mulaney took aim at the MCU as he hosted the Governors Awards and got an excellent response from Robert Downey Jr. for his Oscars jab.




John Mulaney took the opportunity to joke about the MCU getting Oscar nominations during the Governors Awards - garnering a great response from Robert Downey Jr. Mulaney, who is most famous for his work on Saturday Night Live and his stand-up comedy sets, was chosen to host the prestigious ceremony and brought a healthy dose of humor with him. The Governors Awards are a precursor to the Academy Awards, and while organized by the same body, they are comparatively short as they bestow just three lifetime achievement awards to film industry aficionados.




Mulaney&#39;s playful jab at the MCU was reposted by @FutureHasbeen one X/Twitter, in which he compared winning an Oscar for a Marvel movie to winning a Pulitzer Prize for a Reddit Comment. Robert Downey Jr., who was sitting in the audience, responded more than amicably as he could be seen &#34;losing it&#34; with laughter while the audience laughed alongside him. Evidently, Robert Downey Jr. is comfortable with his career-defining tenure as one of the MCU&#39;s most iconic heroes and doesn&#39;t mind being on the receiving end of a joke that pokes fun at the notion that MCU movies prioritize entertainment over art. 


 

                  Every Marvel Cinematic Universe Movie Ranked Worst To Best   Over 15 years and 33 movies, the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies have redefined blockbuster cinema. But how do all the films stack up?   





 What MCU Movies Have Been Nominated For The Oscars 
          

 MCU Movie  Amount of Oscar Nominations/Wins   Iron Man  2 Nominations   Iron Man 2  1 Nomination   The Avengers  1 Nomination   Iron Man 3  1 Nomination   Captain America: The Winter Soldier  1 Nomination   Guardians of the Galaxy  2 Nominations   Doctor Strange  1 Nomination   Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2  1 Nomination   Black Panther  4 Nominations, 3 Wins   Avengers: Infinity War  1 Nomination   Avengers: Endgame  1 Nomination   Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings  1 Nomination   Spider-Man: No Way Home  1 Nomination   Black Panther: Wakanda Forever  4 Nominations, 1Win   






Mulaney&#39;s joke specifically references the fact that Angela Bassett, who played Queen Ramonda in the MCU, earned an Oscar nomination for her phenomenal portrayal. Her deserved recognition isn&#39;t the only time the MCU received a nod from the Academy Awards, however. Black Panther won three Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design, while its sequel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, won an Oscar for Best Costume Design and was also the movie in which Angela Basset was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. Yet, there are plenty of other MCU movies that earned nominations over the years. 

                  10 Academy Award-Winning Actors Who Were Underused In The MCU   Between Forest Whitaker getting killed off too early and F. Murray Abraham&#39;s brief voiceover stint, Marvel Studios has wasted a lot of talent.   

All three Iron Man movies, for example, received nominations for Best Visual Effects - which, unsurprisingly, is the category for which the MCU has scored the most nominations. Guardians of the Galaxy was nominated for Best Makeup and Hair Styling in 2015, while Iron Man also received a nomination for Best Sound Design. Black Panther, which received the most nominations of any MCU movie, was even nominated for Best Picture, though Angela Bassett remains the only MCU actor to receive a nomination specifically for their role.
