# Timothée Chalamet s Most Exciting Movie Franchise Is No Longer Dune


## SUMMARY 



  Timothée Chalamet&#39;s success in the Dune franchise could be followed by another exciting run of films, potentially in the Wonka movie franchise.   A second Wonka movie with Chalamet would offer more originality and creative changes compared to the faithful adaptations of Roald Dahl&#39;s book that have already been done.   Timothée Chalamet&#39;s age gives the Wonka franchise ample time to explore both Dahl&#39;s sequel and rework Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, making it a promising endeavor for his future.

## Literature Review

Dune may be the most prominent of Timothée Chalamet&#39;s current projects, but another franchise could hold greater promise for him going forward.




Although Timothée Chalamet is currently fronting the Dune franchise, there&#39;s another recent property of his that arguably allows for greater levels of creativity. Chalamet is enjoying a spell as one of the most popular figures in Hollywood, and he&#39;s quickly becoming a household name. Among all of his successes, there&#39;s a movie other than Dune that could mark the start of an exciting run of films.




Dune hit cinemas in 2021, with the Dune: Part Two release date set for March 2024. Although Dune 3 is yet to be greenlit by Warner Bros., it would be a surprise if director Denis Villeneuve wasn&#39;t afforded the chance to finish his trilogy. Dune franchise aside, Chalamet might find himself landing on his feet once the saga has concluded, as another of his recent movies affords him the chance to continue his streak of success.

                  Dune Story &amp; World Explained: Characters, Spice &amp; Sandworms   The world of Frank Herbert&#39;s novel Dune is vastly complicated despite the success of Denis Villeneuve&#39;s movie. Let&#39;s break down this complex story.   


 A Wonka Movie Franchise Can Be Timothée Chalamet&#39;s Perfect Dune Replacement

Although vastly different in tone, Wonka and Dune are both part of blockbuster franchises based on literary works. Dune: Part Two is set to add to the world of the first movie, and while a second Wonka movie with Chalamet isn&#39;t confirmed, it would likely once more revisit the events of Roald Dahl&#39;s &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.&#34; However, the difference lies in how future sequels would work within the context of each franchise.




Dune: Part Two continues from the ending of the first Dune movie, adapting the second half of Frank Herbert&#39;s original 1965 Dune book. As a result, the narrative is relatively easy to predict for anyone familiar with Herbert&#39;s work. Inversely, a second Wonka movie could further reinvent the character of Willy Wonka and his world. Dahl&#39;s 1964 book has already been adapted into movies in 1971 and 2004, both times remaining faithful to the source material. As such, replicating the feat a third time would feel redundant without some interesting creative changes. Therefore, a &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34; movie with Chalamet could offer more originality than the Dune franchise.

With Wonka&#39;s origin story already addressed, it&#39;s clear that a second movie would also prioritize Willy Wonka&#39;s perspective over that of Charlie Bucket. Charlie is the main character in the original book and both of its existing adaptations. Therefore, although Charlie should still appear in the second film, he&#39;d be much more suited to a secondary role. Following Chalamet&#39;s &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34; movie, the franchise could then move into truly uncharted territory.




                  Wonka 2: Confirmation Chances, Franchise Plans &amp; Everything We Know   Willy Wonka is getting an origin story in 2023, but will Timothée Chalamet&#39;s take on fiction&#39;s most famous chocolatier get followed up with Wonka 2?   

Roald Dahl wrote a second book featuring the character of Willy Wonka. The 1972 sequel to &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#34; was called &#34;Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator.&#34; The book has never been adapted for the screen, so the second Wonka sequel could break even more new ground. In addition, Chalamet&#39;s age gives the Wonka franchise plenty of time to get to the events of Dahl&#39;s sequel as well as reworking &#34;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.&#34; So, although Dune may currently be the biggest franchise associated with Timothée Chalamet, Wonka could hold even greater promise for his future endeavors.



The 2021 Dune movie is streaming now on Max.
