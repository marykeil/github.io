## Literature Review

Edge of Tomorrow 2 development could be part of Tom Cruise&#39;s deal with Warner Bros., allowing the star&#39;s original cult hit to finally get a sequel.




Edge of Tomorrow 2 development could be part of Tom Cruise&#39;s newly announced Warner Bros. deal. Released in 2014, Cruise’s sci-fi action movie about an out-of-his-depth PR officer battling aliens while caught in a time loop was a big hit with critics, as reflected in its 91% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The film proved a tough sell to audiences, however, and it only grossed $370 million on a budget of $178 million. The movie’s post-theatrical life was strong though, as it went on to become a cult favorite, prompting hopes of a sequel.




Those long-bubbling Edge of Tomorrow sequel hopes have happily been given a boost now, as it’s reported that Cruise’s new deal with Warner Bros. could include development of a follow-up to the 2014 film. WB execs Michael De Luca and Pam Abdy reportedly are eager to make the sequel with Cruise. However, Cruise’s deal reportedly does not guarantee he will ever make a movie for the studio, and even if he does, he would not begin work on a new project until after finishing Mission: Impossible 8. Cruise himself is said to be keen on developing a project that would launch a new franchise.


 Edge Of Tomorrow 2 Would Be More Exciting Than Another Mission: Impossible Or Top Gun 
          

Mission: Impossible 8 is going to happen at Paramount regardless of what Cruise might be cooking up with WB. As for any potential Cruise action vehicle beyond the possible end of his long-running secret agent franchise, a return to sci-fi would be an exciting proposition, as opposed to a safeer project like Top Gun 3. If Cruise does decide to return to the sci-fi arena with Warners, Edge of Tomorrow 2 would be the perfect vehicle.






Edge of Tomorrow was originally titled All You Need Is Kill, and for its home release, was retitled Live. Die. Repeat.: Edge of Tomorrow.




The original Edge of Tomorrow sported a truly ingenious premise, and provided Cruise with a great character to play. According to the film’s director Doug Liman, the sequel he and Cruise have in mind would be a smaller, more character-driven film. As Liman told Collider back in 2021, “I get sometimes the sequel just has to have more firepower or more explosions, but no visual effect is going to top what you’re going to get from a great scene performed by Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.”

Thanks to Cruise’s new deal, Edge of Tomorrow 2 seems closer to happening than ever before. If the long-awaited sequel does come to fruition, it would be more exciting than Cruise returning to his more familiar, less-risky big franchises. Cruise has made gold with sci-fi in the past, with movies like Minority Report and the original Edge of Tomorrow, and he could do it again by reuniting with Blunt and Liman.
