## Literature Review
The role of Celia St. James in Netflix&#39;s The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo adaptation will not go to Jessica Chastain, the actor has now confirmed.




The Netflix film adaptation of The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo will not star Jessica Chastain, she confirms. Written by Taylor Jenkins Reid, the popular novel centers on a fictional Hollywood star who recounts her life story over the course of the book, which includes the titular seven husbands as well as her true love and secret relationship with fellow actress Celia St. James. Netflix announced last year that the studio is set to adapt the novel into a film, leading fans to speculate about who will be cast in the glamorous roles of Evelyn and Celia, with Jessica Chastain serving as a popular choice for Celia.




Chastain previously expressed interest in the role after commenting on the online buzz attached to The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, saying, &#34;Sure, send me a script.&#34; However, she later stated that she was not attached to the project, and has now confirmed that she will not star in it. While speaking with E! News, Chastian said that there is &#34;zero possibility&#34; that she will play Celia in the future film adaptation, though she will &#34;look forward to watching it.&#34; See Chastain&#39;s message for fans below:


But I love how excited the fans are. When I was working on Broadway, every single day, they&#39;d be outside, when I was signing, with the books. I just love how wonderful that fan base is. I look forward to watching it and I&#39;m sorry to disappoint everyone out there!



 Who Will Play Celia St. James And Evelyn Hugo? 
          




The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has endured a long road to the screen, spending several years in development before being greenlit by Netflix. As a result, the movie seems to still be in the early stages and no casting announcements have been released, leaving fans of the novel to continue speculating about who will play the beloved characters. With Chastain officially out, there are plenty of talented actors matching Celia&#39;s description that could take on her role in the movie.



In the book, Celia is described as having round pale blue eyes and strawberry blonde hair.




Popular fan casts include Sophie Turner, Saoirse Ronan, Bridget Regan, and several others. Netflix may decide to cast lesser-known actors for the role, but Celia&#39;s status in the story as a Hollywood star means that casting someone familiar with that level of fame could serve the part well. This may also be true for the role of Evelyn, for whom popular fan casts include Ana de Armas and Sofia Vergara, with Rita Moreno being the overwhelmingly popular choice for the older version of Evelyn who recounts her life story.
