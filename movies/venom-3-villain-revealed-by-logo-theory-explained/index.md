# Venom 3 Villain Revealed By Logo - Theory Explained


## SUMMARY 



  Venom 3&#39;s new logo seems to tease a potential new Marvel villain for the upcoming film.   The inclusion of Toxin as a potential villain makes sense, considering its connection to Carnage and its status as a third-generation symbiote.   Introducing Toxin as a villain in Venom 3 could be risky due to similarities with previous symbiote villains in the franchise, potentially leading to repetitive fight scenes. It may be more effective to expand Venom&#39;s enemies beyond symbiotes and introduce a visually distinct threat.

## Literature Review

Details are scarce on Sony&#39;s upcoming Venom 3, but the movie&#39;s new logo seems to tease the symbiote&#39;s next antagonist in more ways than one.




A new stylized logo for Venom 3 was recently revealed, and it seems to tease the villain for Sony&#39;s upcoming Marvel movie. After Venom kick-started Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe in 2018, its sequel went the subtitle route with the name Venom: Let There Be Carnage. However, it appears the franchise is breaking form for the third (and presumably final) Venom franchise entry. Venom 3&#39;s logo was revealed at Sony&#39;s CES 2024 presentation, along with a handful of non-Marvel projects. Unless something changes before the movie&#39;s marketing officially begins, it appears the third Venom will indeed simply be Venom 3.




Of more note than the nondescript title is that the movie&#39;s logo seems to be teasing a Marvel villain perfect for Venom 3. There&#39;s precedence for superhero movie logos and title changing after being revealed, so there&#39;s no saying if this logo will stick, but there&#39;s surely intention behind the artistically rendered &#34;3&#34; that must connect to the movie&#39;s characters in one way, shape, or form. While the connection hasn&#39;t been confirmed, the new Venom 3 logo makes one particular villain theory seem much more likely than ever.

                  Venom 3 Confirmed: Everything We Know So Far   Venom 3 is coming, but several details are still being held under wraps.   


 Venom&#39;s New Logo Teases Toxin 
Toxin Was Subtly Teased At The End Of Venom: Let There Be Carnage

The Venom 3 logo features the word &#34;Venom&#34; stylized as it has been in the previous two movie titles, but it&#39;s backed with a sinewy red &#34;3.&#34; The inclusion obviously doesn&#39;t give anything away as clearly as &#34;Let There Be Carnage&#34; did, but it&#39;s inspired theories that the next Venom movie will feature the Toxin symbiote. In Marvel Comics, Toxin is an offspring of Carnage who&#39;s bonded with several hosts and, while generally presented as more of an anti-hero, has spent time on both sides of the hero/villain divide. The character makes sense for Venom 3 for several reasons.


 




The biggest reason Toxin is in the conversation about potential Venom 3 villains is that he was teased at the end of Venom: Let There Be Carnage. The nod is vague and likely didn&#39;t mean anything specific to non-comics readers, but after being injured in the climactic battle between Venom and Carnage, Detective Mulligan gains a glow in his eyes and speaks of &#34;monsters.&#34; In Marvel Comics, Mulligan is the first and most important host of the Toxin symbiote, and this scene seems likely to set up his future bond with the creature.

With Toxin in mind, the new Venom 3 logo seems to gain some symbolism. The most obvious connection is that the logo is red, and, like Carnage, so is Toxin. Given symbiotes are often differentiated by their color, it&#39;s a strong mark in Toxin&#39;s favor, given that Carnage is dead. Moreover, &#34;3&#34; makes sense for Toxin as he&#39;s a &#34;third generation&#34; symbiote: Venom birthed Carnage, and Carnage births Toxin in Marvel Comics.



 Why Toxin Is Risky For Venom 3 
         




Even though Toxin has already been teased in the Venom franchise, there are a few reasons why the symbiote would be a risky conclusion in the trilogy-closer. While the Venom movies have proven the most successful in Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe so far, one complaint revolvers around both projects&#39; villains being too similar to Venom himself. Venom features Riot, and Venom: Let There Be Carnage features Carnage, both symbiote that create spikes and weapons with their symbiote bodies. The result can make for fights that are hard to read on screen, and a third villain with the exact same power set risks being overly repetitive.

Given Sony&#39;s Spider-Man Universe is all about Spider-Man villains, it would be odd not to expand Venom&#39;s enemies past Symbiotes. Given Venom&#39;s position as an anti-hero, he could conceivably come up against any of Spider-Man&#39;s many memorable rogues. To avoid a villain repeat, it&#39;s possible Venom 3 will position Toxin as the more heroic figure that he often is in Marvel Comics, and the two will team up against a different, hopefully visually distinct threat. Regardless, with Venom 3 set for release on November 8, 2024, more information should be on the way soon.
