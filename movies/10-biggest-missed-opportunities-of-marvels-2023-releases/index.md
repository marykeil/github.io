# 10 Biggest Missed Opportunities Of Marvels 2023 Releases


## SUMMARY 



The ways in which the MCU wasted some prime opportunities are showcased via the way Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania portrayed the villain M.O.D.O.K., turning him into a comical caricature instead of a compelling supervillain.

Quantumania also failed to establish Kang as a real threat, undermining his reputation and future role as the main villain.

Secret Invasion and The Marvels also missed opportunities to expand characters&#39; arcs and connect the overall franchise more cohesively and consistently.
