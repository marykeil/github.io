## Literature Review

The families of the diseased and the survivors’ involvement was a key element in the making of Society of the Snow, and that included several cameos. 




Both the survivors and the families of those who died in the Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 accident were closely involved in Society of the Snow, and several cameos are proof of that. Juan Antonio Bayona&#39;s adaptation of the true story, known both as &#34;The Tragedy of the Andes&#34; and &#34;The Miracle of the Andes&#34;, has already been released worldwide on Netflix and has received praise from critics and the audience. The movie follows a Uruguayan rugby team that managed to survive 72 days in the middle of the Andes after a terrible plane crash while traveling to Chile for a series of matches.
Although there are some changes to the true story in Society of the Snow, plenty of the film&#39;s positive response is due to its realism and faithfulness to historical facts. The movie successfully captures the essence of the tale, which lies somewhere in between the miraculous and the tragic. The film is based on Pablo Vierci&#39;s novel, the first to collect the testimony of all 16 survivors. Vierci was crucial as he put director J.A. Bayona in contact with the Society of the Snow survivors of the Andes plane crash and the relatives of the diseased, whose involvement in the film contributed to the quality of the final product and can be appreciated in several cameos.
Society of the Snow is available to stream on Netflix. 










 








 9  Fernando Parrado 
Nando Parrado Is An Extra In The Carrasco Airport Scene
        

Fernando “Nando” Parrado is one of the most recognized figures in the story. He, together with Roberto Canessa, walked 38 miles from the location in the Andes of the plane crash to the Chile valleys. Parrado, who was severely injured during the crash, and lost both his mother and sister in the tragedy, became a crucial man for the survival of the entire team. In a very meaningful cameo, Parrado can be spotted opening the door for the actor portraying him during the pre-boarding scene at the Carrasco Airport in Montevideo.





 8  Roberto Canessa 
Roberto Canessa Is An Extra At The Hospital
        

Roberto Canessa, along with Fernando &#34;Nando&#34; Parrado, is one of the most remembered names of all 16 Society of the Snow&#39;s survivors. As previously established, Roberto and Nando were the ones who managed to get to Chile with no mountain equipment and sought help. Canessa&#39;s role in Society of the Snow is crucial as he becomes a natural leader after the plane crash. In the film, similarly to Parrado&#39;s cameo, the real Canessa can be spotted right behind the actor who plays him in the movie. In this case, he is one of the doctors receiving him at the hospital after the rescue. 
            
 
 Society Of The Snow Ending Explained 
Society of the Snow retells the story of the 1972 Andes plane crash with great accuracy, allowing the viewer to interpret the outcome for themselves.








 7  Carlitos Paez 
Carlitos Paez Plays His Own Father
        

Carlitos Paez, portrayed in the film by Felipe Gonzalez Otaño, was the youngest man in the plane crash. During the 72 days in the Andes, one of his key jobs was to perfectly seal the airplane cabin in order not to freeze to death during the night. Being younger than the rest, he is portrayed as the funny, imprudent type. Carlitos&#39;s father, Carlos Paez Vilaro, was a very well-known Uruguayan artist, and his role during the search for the plane was crucial. In a very moving cameo, Carlitos plays his own father and is the only special cameo with dialogue as he reads the names of the survivors on the radio.





 6  Daniel Fernandez Strauch 
Fernadez Strauch Appears During The Church Scene
        

Daniel Fernandez Strauch, portrayed in Society of the Snow by Argentinian actor Francisco Romero, has a very small cameo in the film. Fernandez&#39;s participation happens during the church scene where Gaston Costemalle, portrayed by Argentinian musician Jaime James &#34;Louta&#34;, meets Numa Turcatti to try and convince him to travel to Chile with his rugby teammates. Fernandez Strauch, in real life, is the cousin of the Strauch brothers, the two key men after the Society of the Snow plane crash in charge of cutting the meat from the bodies during their time in the mountains. Stauch can be spotted seated in the second row on the left side of one of the widest shots during the Mass.





 5  Jose Luis &#34;Coche&#34; Inciarte 
&#34;Coche&#34; Inciarte Appears In The Bar Scene In Montevideo
        

José Luis &#34;Coche&#34; Inciarte, played by Simon Hempe in Society of the Snow, has a rather noticeable cameo during the bar scene. Numa gets together with Gaston Costemalle and a couple of his rugby teammates, and they try to convince him to go with them to Chile. In one of the widest shots, Inciarte can be spotted playing a man reading the newspaper at the back on the left edge of the frame.
Jose Luis &#34;Coche&#34; Inciarte died on July 23rd, 2023, before Society of the Snow was released. 






 4  Antonio &#34;Tintín&#34; Vizintín 
Vizintín Is One Of The Many Extras In the Airport Scene
        

Antonio &#34;Tintin&#34; Vizintín, played by Agustín Della Corte in Society of the Snow, participated in the making of the film during the pre-boarding scene. Vizintín is credited as an extra in the Carrasco Airport scene in Montevideo. However, his cameo might not have made the final cut; at best, it&#39;s incredibly hard to spot if there.





 3  Ramón &#34;Moncho&#34; Sabella 
Ramón Sabella Has A Very Small Cameo In The Airport Scene
        

Ramón &#34;Moncho&#34; Sabella, played by Rocco Posca in Society of the Snow, also participated in the shooting of the movie as an extra in the Carrasco Airport scene. However, in opposition to his former rugby teammate, he can be spotted during a very brief moment for eagle-eyed viewers. Javier and Liliana Methol are saying goodbye to their relatives and, in one of the wider frames, Sabella can be seen passing by wearing a dark suit and his head turned slightly toward the camera.





 2  Gustavo Zerbino 
Gustavo Zerbino Is The Rugby Team Coach
        

Gustavo Zerbino, played by Tomás Wolf in the film, is credited in Society of the Snow as the Old Christians&#39; rugby team coach. However, there are no noticeable cameos that support that credit. It is possible that his participation didn&#39;t make the final cut. It&#39;s also possible that it&#39;s just really hard to spot given that the coach does not travel with the team, so he is not present at the airport nor on the plane, and during the rugby match there are no close shots from the bench.





 1  Joaquin de Freitas Turcatti 
Joaquin Freitas Is Numa&#39;s Neighbor
        

Joaquin de Freitas Turcatti makes one of the most significant cameos in Society of the Snow as Numa&#39;s neighbor. Numa is the narrator of the film and has a signfiicant role, even though the movie has more of a coral structure regarding its characters. What&#39;s more, all the voices of the passengers and crew members who died in the Andes tragedy are conveyed by Numa&#39;s character, which is the cornerstone of Juan Antonio Bayona&#39;s approach to the film. In Society of the Snow, Freitas has a small but significant cameo when he greets Numa before he enters his home with his bike.
