## Literature Review

Dune: Part Two should have a lot of momentum leading up to its March 1, 2024 release following the box office success of Chalamet&#39;s latest hit movie.




The likelihood of Denis Villeneuve&#39;s highly-anticipated Dune: Part Two smashing the box-office performance of 2021&#39;s Dune just got higher after one December hit. After a series of delays that pushed the release of Dune: Part Two, we are less than two months away from the blockbuster&#39;s March 1, 2024 debut. Dune: Part Two will see the return of Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides and feature Rebecca Ferguson, Josh Brolin, Zendaya, Javier Bardem, Dave Bautista, and Stellan Skarsgård in recurring roles.




Dune: Part Two will also see the addition of several major actors such as Florence Pugh, Austin Butler, Léa Seydoux, and Christopher Walken. With such a star-studded cast and an expectation of being even more action-packed than 2021&#39;s Dune, hopes are high that Villeneuve&#39;s sequel will be his highest-grossing feature film yet. Dune earned just over $402 million at the 2021 worldwide box office in a year that was greatly affected by movie theater closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                  Wonka Breaks 1 Major Theme From The Wilder &amp; Depp Movies (&amp; Makes Willy Wonka So Much Better)   Both the Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp Willy Wonka movies had a major theme that Wonka breaks, making Paul King&#39;s version of Willy Wonka much better.   


 Timothée Chalamet&#39;s Wonka Success Is A Huge Boost For Dune 2&#39;s Box Office 
         

Timothée Chalamet quickly disproved any critics who had predicted Wonka to be a box office flop. Its impressive $403 million worldwide box office, which continues to grow into the new year, greatly helped the 2023 United States overall box office become a landmark $9 billion year. Wonka surpassing Dune&#39;s total box office revenue is an excellent sign for Dune: Part Two as the universal hype for Chalamet films has shown no signs of slowing down anytime soon.




While not every Wonka fan will likely be a Dune: Part Two one as well, there is certainly a large enough audience of Dune fans who may have missed their opportunity to see the 2021 film in theaters. This, along with the momentum of Wonka and the hype of Chalamet in the leading role, should do a lot to propel Dune: Part Two&#39;s box office to become Villeneuve&#39;s, and potentially even Chalamet&#39;s, highest-grossing movie of all time.

                  Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Biggest Dune 2 Change Explains The Franchise&#39;s Spinoff Plans   Denis Villeneuve&#39;s passion for the Bene Gesserit heavily influenced Dune 2 and could lay a solid foundation for a successful Dune spinoff series.   



 How Much Could Dune 2 Actually Make? 
         

Dune: Part Two has a massive theatrical appeal based on its enhanced cast, story, and action sequences compared to the original movie. The various formats in which Dune: Part Two will be screened, such as Standard, Dolby, and IMAX, could also inspire repeat ticket sales, a feature that certainly played into Oppenheimer&#39;s nearly $1 billion worldwide box office. With Dune: Part Two slated to be the first, and one of the best, blockbuster epics of 2024, it could make even more than Chalamet&#39;s highest-grossing film Interstellar at $681 million.
