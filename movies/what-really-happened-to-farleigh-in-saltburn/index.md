Farleigh&#39;s fate is left ambiguous, but it is possible that Oliver plans to kill him before he can return and reclaim Saltburn.  







Farleigh is one of the most interesting characters in Saltburn, but the film doesn&#39;t make it clear what happens to him, so here&#39;s the actual fate of Farleigh at the end of the film. Throughout Saltburn, Farleigh is one of the more antagonistic forces in Oliver&#39;s attempts to get involved in Felix&#39;s life, with the two having a bit of a rivalry. While Farleigh&#39;s fate may not be as tragic as that of some of Felix&#39;s other family members, he definitely has a sad ending in Saltburn.

2023&#39;s Saltburn is an exciting film from director Emerald Fennell, with the film being one of the most talked about movies of the year. Saltburn follows Oliver Quick, a university student who falls for a peer named Felix Catton, with him eventually traveling to Felix&#39;s family home, Saltburn, and living with them. Things quickly take a dark turn, with the controversial film spiraling into madness as Oliver&#39;s story takes a dark descent.

                  Saltburn Cast &amp; Character Guide   Since Saltburn&#39;s compelling drama is primarily driven by its well-written character beats, one cannot help but wonder who plays whom in the movie.   





 Farleigh Was Officially Cut Off By The Catton Family &amp; Seemingly Returned To America 
          

At the end of the film, it is revealed that Oliver has spent the entirety of Saltburn putting a plan in motion that would allow him to inherit the Saltburn estate and all of the family&#39;s assets. This involved Oliver systematically killing off the various family members in various ways, but he didn&#39;t actually have to kill all of them. Rather than killing Farleigh, Oliver framed Farleigh for the death of Felix, causing the Catton family to cut him off and return him to America.

Unbeknownst to the Catton family, Felix was poisoned by Oliver, leading to his death. However, Oliver made it seem like Felix died of a drug overdose, with this being connected to Farleigh&#39;s drug use. The Cattons bought this story, with James angrily sending Farleigh away for good, with him not returning for the rest of the film.






 Oliver&#39;s Plan Means He Likely Still Killed Farleigh When Inheriting Saltburn 
         

While it seems like Farleigh simply got sent away at the end of Saltburn, it&#39;s likely that he had a much darker fate. Oliver&#39;s plan to inherit Saltburn involved him killing off most of the members of the Catton family, with this plan being incredibly meticulous. It is unlikely that Oliver would leave the door open for Farleigh to return from America and take Saltburn back, meaning that he could have found a way to kill him off.

While killing off someone in America may seem like a difficult task, Oliver&#39;s meticulous planning and attention to detail show that it is entirely possible. It could even be that Oliver is awaiting Farleigh&#39;s return, planning to kill him before he has a chance to take Saltburn back. Saltburn is a dark and violent story that is full of death, so one more murder doesn&#39;t seem all that far-fetched.
