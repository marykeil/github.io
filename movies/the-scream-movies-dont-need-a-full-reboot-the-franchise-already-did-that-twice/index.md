## Literature Review

Scream VII has caused speculation that the Scream franchise may get a reboot, but this is actually a bad idea, as the franchise already did that.




There has been a lot of speculation regarding whether the Scream series will reboot again with the release of Scream VII, but a full reboot isn&#39;t needed, as the franchise has already done that (twice). Despite the long-running Scream franchise releasing six movies from 1996 to 2023, the films have always maintained a consistent continuity, with each one being a sequel to the last. However, it seems like a reboot may finally be approaching with the release of Scream VII, but that really isn&#39;t necessary.




2023&#39;s Scream VI was a huge box office success, with the film making the studio eager to get a seventh movie out. While development on Scream VII was going smoothly for a while, Spyglass Media Group made the controversial move to fire Scream V and Scream VI star Melissa Bererra from the sequel due to her support of Palestine on social media, with Spyglass deeming her remarks antisemitic. Since then, Jenna Ortega has also left Scream VII, putting the franchise in shambles and setting the stage for a potential reboot.

                  9 Sam &amp; Tara Storylines That Will Never Be Resolved After Scream 7&#39;s Exits   Now that Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega have exited Scream 7, the slasher franchise will leave many lingering Sam and Tara mysteries unanswered.   


 The Scream TV Show Did 2 Full Reboots Already 
         




While Scream VII could be a reboot, this move is unnecessary, as the Scream TV show has done two full reboots already. MTV&#39;s 2015 Scream series followed the same basic premise as the original movies, but the TV show wasn&#39;t canon to the films. Instead, Scream seasons 1 and 2 told a self-contained story that was completely disconnected from the stories of Sidney Prescott and the rest of the recurring characters from the movies.

However, the Scream TV show also rebooted the series a second time, further cementing that another reboot isn&#39;t necessary. The Scream TV series moved to VH1 for its third season, with it being completely disconnected from the previous two seasons. Scream season 3 was a full reboot, with it once again focusing on all-new characters in an all-new setting.



 Why A Full Reboot Would Be Bad For The Scream Movies 
         




Despite the massive speculation surrounding Scream VII being a reboot, doing a full reboot of the Scream franchise would be bad for the movies. Much of the appeal of the Scream movies is the continuous storyline, with each past Ghostface killer being important to the story of subsequent films. Scream VI featured Easter eggs that referenced every single Scream movie so far, and rebooting the franchise would throw out all kinds of important lore.

                  Scream 7: Returning Cast &amp; Everything We Know   Scream 7 could push the franchise in wild new directions when Ghostface returns, but whether it&#39;s greenlit is a question that still needs answers.   

Although Sam and Tara Carpenter may not be returning for the next Scream film, there are still all kinds of beloved characters that would be lost if the Scream movies rebooted. Courtney Cox&#39;s Gale Weathers has been around since the very beginning, while Kirby Reed, the Meeks-Martin twins, and more could still reappear in the seventh movie. It may be hard to write the Carpenters out of Scream VII, but it is a much better choice than rebooting the Scream movies entirely.
