## SUMMARY 


 

The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 could include iconic Donkey Kong characters like King K. Rool, Lanky Kong, and Tiny Kong, expanding the roster of the franchise.


Candy Kong and Wrinkly Kong could be further developed in The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2, adding depth to their characters and enhancing the story.


The sequel should also consider featuring the Kremlings, Rambi the Rhinoceros, Squawks the Parrot, and Donkey Kong Jr., as they contribute to the unique charm of the Donkey Kong series.
