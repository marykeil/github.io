## Literature Review

Many great movies will celebrate their twenty-year anniversary in 2024. Here are the best films of 2004 that still hold up perfectly today.




Aside from the many exciting upcoming films of the year, many iconic classics are celebrating their 20th anniversary in 2024. Though it&#39;s only been two decades, the film industry has changed dramatically since 2004, and it&#39;s important to reflect on what movies have aged well. Many of the biggest box office releases and Best Picture nominees aren&#39;t considered among the most enduring films of the year, which is typical, given how the industry and filmmaking styles develop. In contrast, movies that didn&#39;t receive their deserved acclaim at the time become beloved and essential classics.
From superhero movies to beloved animation to laugh-out-loud comedies, several films stand out among 2004&#39;s best. Most of the year&#39;s best movies are highly re-watchable, allowing them to stand the test of time through audiences continuously engaging with them. In retrospect, 2004 was a fantastic film year, with a variety of great movies in different genres and for different target audiences.
            
 
 10 Movies That Are Essential To Understanding The 2000s 
Movies enormously impacted 2000s pop culture in music, humor, fashion, and more. These classics are quintessential to the 2000s decade.












 








 10  Shaun Of The Dead 
Directed by Edgar Wright
        

  Shaun of the Dead  


  Release Date    September 24, 2004     Director    Edgar Wright     Cast    Kate Ashfield , Nick Frost , Simon Pegg , Lucy Davis , Dylan Moran     Rating    R     Runtime    99 minutes    


One of the decade&#39;s best comedies is Shaun of the Dead, the first film in Edgar Wright&#39;s Cornetto trilogy (followed by Hot Fuzz and The World&#39;s End). Co-written by star Simon Pegg, the 2004 movie stars Shaun, a slacker who&#39;s left to fend off a zombie apocalypse in London. Shaun of the Dead is the perfect combination of classic zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and witty British humor. Comedy is a genre that typically doesn&#39;t age well, but the sharp humor of Edgar Wright&#39;s cult classics still holds up.





 9  The Incredibles 
Directed by Brad Bird
        

  The Incredibles  


  Release Date    November 5, 2004     Director    Brad Bird     Cast    Sarah Vowell , Samuel L. Jackson , Craig T. Nelson , Spencer Fox , Holly Hunter , Jason Lee     Rating    PG     Runtime    115 minutes    


The 2000s was a golden age for Pixar movies, and 2004&#39;s The Incredibles is still a beloved animated classic. Many of the era&#39;s animated films developed a perfect mix of appeal for both children and adults, telling thoughtful and engaging stories fit for all ages. The Incredibles revolves around a superhero family forced into action to save the world, with themes of family and identity. Given the immense popularity of superhero stories in modern culture, The Incredibles has managed to remain timely and relevant.





 8  Million Dollar Baby 
Directed by Clint Eastwood
        

  Million Dollar Baby  


  Release Date    December 15, 2004     Director    Clint Eastwood     Cast    Hilary Swank , Mike Colter , Jay Baruchel , Clint Eastwood , Morgan Freeman     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    132 minutes    


Million Dollar Baby is one of Clint Eastwood&#39;s best movies, but the standout is Hilary Swank, who plays aspiring boxer Maggie Fitzgerald. The film explores the complex, strenuous relationship between athlete and trainer, driven by the powerful performances of its stars. Winner of the 2005 Academy Award for Best Picture, among other awards, Million Dollar Baby holds up better than other Best Picture winners in the 2000s.





 7  Anchorman 
Directed by Adam McKay
        

  Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  


  Release Date    July 9, 2004     Director    Adam McKay     Cast    Will Ferrell , Christina Applegate , Paul Rudd , Steve Carell , David Koechner , Fred Willard     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    94 minutes    


Anchorman is the first and best collaboration between Adam McKay and Will Ferrell and one of the best absurd comedies ever. Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy, a San Diego news anchor in the 1970s who struggles when a more talented female journalist joins the news team. With stars like Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carell, and several celebrity cameos, Anchorman became one of the biggest and most celebrated comedies of the 2000s and is still frequently quoted.





 6  Collateral 
Directed by Michael Mann
        

  Collateral  


  Release Date    August 4, 2004     Director    Michael Mann     Cast    Tom Cruise , Jamie Foxx , Jada Pinkett Smith , Mark Ruffalo , Peter Berg , Bruce McGill     Rating    R     Runtime    120 minutes    


For lovers of Heat, Michael Mann&#39;s Collateral is the next best thing, starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays a cab driver who incidentally finds himself as the chauffeur for a contract assassin, played by a silver-haired Cruise. The dangerous assassin is on a one-night killing spree with multiple targets, and the driver must figure out how to escape with his life and humanity intact. Set in a visually stunning Los Angeles, the intense crime thriller sees Mann utilizing new digital film technology to capture a unique aesthetic.





 5  Spider-Man 2 
Directed by Sam Raimi
        

  Spider-Man 2  


  Release Date    June 30, 2004     Director    Sam Raimi     Cast    Donna Murphy , Alfred Molina , Tobey Maguire , James Franco , Rosemary Harris , Kirsten Dunst     Rating    PG-13     Runtime    127 minutes    


Superhero films became immensely popular in the 2010s, which can largely be credited to the work of Sam Raimi in his Spider-Man trilogy. After so many great interpretations of the classic Marvel hero, Spider-Man 2 is still one of the best Spider-Man movies, capturing a classic hero and villain dichotomy with Peter Parker and Doc Ock. The mature superhero film has been massively influential on many that proceeded it, given the attention it places on its darker villain development and balancing action and adventure with personal conflicts.





 4  Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban 
Directed by Alfonso Cuarón
        

  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  


  Release Date    May 31, 2004     Director    Alfonso Cuarón     Cast    Gary Oldman , David Thewlis , Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , Rupert Grint , Robbie Coltrane , Timothy Spall , Maggie Smith , Michael Gambon , Richard Griffiths , Fiona Shaw , Alan Rickman     Rating    pg-13     Runtime    144 Minutes    


The Harry Potter film series was one of the biggest markets of the 2000s, and The Prisoner of Azkaban marked a notable tone shift in the series. Academy Award winner Alfonso Cuarón helped establish a darker, more mature side of the Wizarding World that persisted as the characters grew into their late teen years. Still widely considered the best Harry Potter movie, The Prisoner of Azkaban notably introduced David Thewlis&#39; Remus Lupin, Gary Oldman&#39;s Sirius Black, and Michael Gambon&#39;s portrayal of Albus Dumbledore. In a series packed with beloved movies, the third is the most visually artistic and narratively celebrated.





 3  Howl’s Moving Castle 
Directed by Hayao Miyazaki


 







  Howl&#39;s Moving Castle  


  Release Date    November 19, 2004     Director    Hayao Miyazaki     Cast    Chieko Baisho , Takuya Kimura , Akihiro Miwa , Tatsuya Gashûin , Ryûnosuke Kamiki , Mitsunori Isaki     Rating    8-12 years     Runtime    119minutes    


Hayao Miyazaki is one of the most unique auteur directors, given that his filmography consists of animated features. Movies like Howl&#39;s Moving Castle are celebrated by both children and adults for their portrayal of magical fantasy and complex themes through vibrant, hand-drawn worlds. His 2004 classic is a beautiful tale about a cursed young woman who transforms into an older woman and seeks the help of the wizard Howl to lift it. Howl&#39;s Moving Castle is a masterpiece about love and war that, decades later, still fascinates new audiences.





 2  Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind 
Directed by Michael Gondry


 







  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  


  Release Date    March 19, 2004     Director    Michel Gondry     Cast    Kate Winslet , Jim Carrey , Elijah Wood , Kirsten Dunst , Mark Ruffalo     Rating    R     Runtime    108 minutes    


Jim Carrey is primarily known for his comedy work, yet the dramatic Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the actor&#39;s best film. Michael Gondry&#39;s sci-fi romance story sees Carrey play Joel, a man who discovers that his ex-partner has undergone a procedure to erase him from her memory. In response, he decides he has to do the same thing, leading Joel to contemplate both the joy and heartbreak of their romance. The innovative and highly emotional classic offers a complex narrative about love and memory that still engages with audiences in the 2020s.

 1  Before Sunset 
Directed by Richard Linklater
        

The long-awaited sequel in Richard Linklater&#39;s romance series, the Before trilogy, is 2004&#39;s best film. Jesse and Céline, two people who spent a singular, romantic night together in Vienna nine years prior, meet for the first time again in Paris. Before Sunset is a masterpiece of dialogue and performance, as the two catch up in real-time, spending eighty minutes together where they probe at the idea of destiny and their meaning to each other after years apart. No one captures authentic romance, chemistry, and themes about life choices like Linklater.
