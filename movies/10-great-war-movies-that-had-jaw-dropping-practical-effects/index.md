## Literature Review

Some of the best war movies of all time prefer practical effects over CGI. This creates a more authentic sense of danger and chaos in battle scenes.




War movies are often judged based on their realism, and using practical effects is a great way to add some weight to battle scenes. Using CGI has become the industry standard for many movies, especially with large-scale battles that require explosions, gunshots, and blood. All of these elements can be extremely difficult to shoot with practical effects, and if they aren&#39;t done well, they won&#39;t look very convincing. But the rewards of using practical effects can be enormous, and that&#39;s why many seasoned directors will use dynamite, artificial blood, and real military equipment rather than CGI.
CGI technology has advanced exponentially in recent years. Cutting-edge digital effects can fool even the most observant moviegoers, but nothing shatters an audience&#39;s suspension of disbelief faster than poorly executed CGI. This is vital to war movies, since so much of their appeal often hinges on creating immersive scenes of historical battles. Practical effects can inject a movie with a more potent sense of danger. It&#39;s not just about how the effect looks on camera, but also about how the actors are able to react in the moment. War movies are one genre that use practical effects more than most others.









 








 10  Tropic Thunder (2008) 
A war parody with genuine effects
        

Tropic Thunder may be a spoof of more serious war movies, but it features as many genuine, massive explosions as the genuine article. The opening scene is supposed to imitate war epics like Apocalypse Now, and the massive napalm explosion required 1,100 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel, which sent a fireball 350 feet into the air. The explosion was in the movie for 1.25 seconds, and Ben Stiller made sure to set up 12 cameras, so they could avoid wasting money like Tropic Thunder’s fictional director Damien Cockburn. Some of the explosions in the movie were digitally exaggerated for comic effect.





 9  1917 (2019) 
Trenches laden with dynamite
        

The two continuous takes of 1917 required some expert digital manipulation. Director Sam Mendes wanted to avoid any obvious cuts, so he enlisted a digital effects team to stitch the movie together as seamlessly as possible. But 1917 still relied on practical effects for some of its most memorable scenes. The final run across the battlefield features roughly 500 extras, as explosions go off all around them. It’s the emotional culmination of Will’s harrowing journey, and the weight of the practical effects adds a realistic sense of fear. 1917’s effects are so refined that it can often be hard to tell what is real and what is computer-generated.





 8  Saving Private Ryan (1998) 
Thousands of gallons of artificial blood


 







Steven Spielberg insisted on realism during the production of Saving Private Ryan. This extended to giving his actors very little rest between takes, so that they would always appear tired and on edge, more closely resembling how a real soldier might feel during war. He also chose to film most of the movie chronologically to inject some added emotion. The practical effects of the famous D-Day landing sequence bolster Saving Private Ryan’s credentials. The crew set an enormous number of explosive charges on the beach in Ireland, and they used thousands of gallons of artificial blood to change the color of the tide.





 7  Dunkirk (2017) 
Genuine period-appropriate naval craft


 







Some of the small boats which were used in the evacuation of Dunkirk also appeared in the movie. 

Dunkirk has been praised by historians and military experts for its realism. The movie’s attention to historical accuracy is admirable, and this includes the period-appropriate costumes and props, not just the story of how Operation Dynamo unfolded. Christopher Nolan and his production team managed to secure genuine British Spitfires for some of the aerial sequences, and some of the small boats which were used in the evacuation of Dunkirk also appeared in the movie. Nolan had several ships reconditioned to look like British 1940s naval craft. He preferred this method over CGI, and he also chose to use cardboard cutouts and 3D printed models for massive crowd scenes.





 6  Hacksaw Ridge (2016) 
Stringent commitment to an incredible true story
        

Director Mel Gibson used his own experiences of acting in war movies to harness practical effects for Hacksaw Ridge. The movie was shot in Australia, but Gibson commissioned extensive landscaping projects to make the area resemble Okinawa more closely. He had to select his shots carefully so that he wouldn’t accidentally include Australia’s native eucalyptus trees in the background. Gibson wanted to honor the true story behind Hacksaw Ridge, so he only used visual effects for excessively bloody scenes, including those with napalm-burnt soldiers and severed limbs. For the most part, the explosions are genuine, and the large crowd scenes are achieved with extras.





 5  All Quiet On The Western Front (2022) 
A revolutionary blend of CGI and practical effects
        

The German adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque’s seminal World War I novel is a masterpiece of digital effects. The production conjured photorealistic elements on the battlefield, including tanks and planes, which look remarkably believable. Still, the production paired this cutting-edge technology with a healthy dose of practical effects, including explosions made by dynamite and air pipes laid under the ground to produce the effect of bullets hitting the dirt. Despite the movie’s technologically advanced visuals, some of the most difficult shots were achieved more naturally. The opening of the movie features a fox and her cubs, and this was filmed with a wildlife photographer, rather than using CGI.





 4  Napoleon (2023) 
Old-school effects from a veteran director
        

Ahead of its release date, Ridley Scott confirmed that Napoleon used practical effects for most of its large-scale battle sequences. The production tried to stick to historical realism with its costumes, flags, and weaponry, and this carried over into Scott’s depiction of Napoleon’s most famous battles. The Siege of Toulon features real explosions out at sea, and cannon fire with genuine recoil to add hefty drama to the scene. Scott had already proved that he could conduct enormous battle scenes with Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven. Napoleon may have received some criticism about its tone and adherence to historical events, but the battle scenes are appropriately epic.





 3  Inglourious Basterds (2009) 
Tarantino takes realism to the limit
        

Tarantino admitted that he took his role as a hands-on director to the next level by genuinely strangling Diane Kruger for one scene. 

Quentin Tarantino’s story of espionage and treachery in the Second World War doesn’t have as much action as many other movies in the war genre, but Inglourious Basterds still utilizes its director’s cinematic flair for a few large scenes. The fire in the cinema is one scene which stands out, and the inferno was achieved using practical effects. The fire burned much hotter than the crew anticipated, so the scene is even more terrifying than envisioned. Tarantino admitted that he took his role as a hands-on director to the next level by genuinely strangling Diane Kruger for one scene, which is about as rudimentary as practical filmmaking can get.





 2  The Bridge On The River Kwai (1957) 
One of the most iconic practical effects scenes of all time
        

In 1957, practical effects were the only way filmmakers could achieve certain feats on film. The explosion of the bridge on the River Kwai is one of the most iconic scenes in British cinematic history, and it probably wouldn’t feel as exciting if it were made using modern CGI technology. As Nicholson falls on the detonator, the bridge explodes spectacularly, and a Japanese train plummets into the river below. The brief moment of silence after the explosion, as the smoke rises and the reality sets in for the characters, is another compelling way to communicate the gravity of the event.

Many British filmmakers have found inspiration in the country’s military history, and some of the best British movies of all time focus on war.








 1  Apocalypse Now (1979) 
A dizzying number of practical explosions


 







Although it is set during the Vietnam War, Apocalypse Now was mostly filmed in the Philippines. The shoot was notoriously punishing, as it stretched to take over half a year. The production was plagued by a typhoon, cast changes, and Martin Sheen suffering a near-fatal heart attack on set. The iconic napalm explosion remains one of the biggest practical effects sequences of all time, but Apocalypse Now used many more practical tricks to create an immersive and chaotic image of the Vietnam War. The Philippine Air Force was brought in to perform many of the flying stunts, and the ritualistic water buffalo sacrifice was sadly genuine as well.
