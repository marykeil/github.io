## Literature Review

Titanic focuses on Rose&#39;s story on board the title ship, but it also revealed some parts of her life after the Titanic and Jack&#39;s death.




The story of Titanic is told by old Rose DeWitt Bukater, and while the movie focuses on her time on board the ship with Jack Dawson, it also reveals a couple of things about Rose’s life after the tragedy of the Titanic. Although over two decades have passed since the release of James Cameron’s Titanic, it continues to be one of the biggest and most successful movies ever made. In addition to that, the romance between Rose and Jack on board the infamous ship is still one of the most beloved love stories in film history.
Watch on Paramount&#43;
Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) was 17 years old when she boarded the Titanic with her fiancé, Cal Hockley (Bill Zane), and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Rose came from a wealthy family, but they were going through financial problems that would make them lose their upper-class status, so it was important to Ruth that Rose married Cal. Rose’s life changed completely after meeting Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and following the sinking of the Titanic, she made radical but necessary changes in her life. Rose broke free from her family and social status after the sinking of the Titanic, and here’s what’s known about her life after that traumatic night.

James Cameron&#39;s Titanic is a fictionalized love story set on the tragic 1912 voyage, but Kate Winslet&#39;s Rose was partially based on a real person.












 








 8  Rose Changed Her Last Name To “Dawson” 
Rose Honored Jack&#39;s Memory


 







Rose Dewitt Bukater became one of only six passengers rescued from the water following the sinking of the Titanic, and the survivors were later rescued by the RMS Carpathia. Once on board the Carpathia, Rose hid among the steerage passengers to avoid Cal, who she saw walking around looking for her. When an officer asked her name, Rose changed it to “Rose Dawson” to honor Jack’s memory and further avoid being found by Cal and Ruth. Rose’s name changed again years later after she got married, but she never got over Jack and their short-lived but intense romance on board the Titanic.





 7  Rose Never Contacted Her Mother And Cal Again 
Rose Completely Started Over
        

Before Rose Dewitt Bukater boarded the Titanic and met Jack, she was manipulated by everyone around her. Rose was being used by her mother to not lose their wealth and upper-class status, and she was going to marry a man who was much older than her and with whom she wasn’t in love. Titanic showed glimpses of Cal manipulating and abusing Rose, so it’s not surprising that the latter decided not to contact him and her mother after the sinking of the Titanic. As mentioned above, Rose hid from Cal when he looked for her among the passengers, and it’s implied she never reunited with her mother again.
However, and linking to the above point, it’s unlikely she would have been able to hide from them for long. It has been pointed out on forums and social media that Cal and Ruth would have noticed a “Rose Dawson” on the list of survivors, which was published days later, though it’s also possible that they wouldn’t have remembered Jack’s last name. Rose’s public image years later would have also made it difficult to hide from them, but it looks like she still managed to stay far away from them.
            
 
 What Happened To Cal After The Titanic Sank (It&#39;s Worse Than Expected) 
Titanic&#39;s villain, Cal Hockley, managed to get on a lifeboat as the ship sank, but what happened to him after the Titanic&#39;s tragedy in 1912? 








 6  Rose Became A Successful Actress 
Rose Worked On Screen In The 1920s
        

Rose no longer relied on her family’s wealth (or what was left of it) after the sinking of the Titanic, but she found a way to maintain herself. It’s revealed at the beginning of Titanic, when she’s about to join Brock Lovett and his crew, that Rose was an actress in the 1920s, and she continued to use the name “Rose Dawson” during her acting career. This, along with “Rose DeWitt Bukater” being registered as one of the victims of the sinking of the Titanic, made one of Lovett’s crew members believe Rose wasn’t who she claimed to be.





 5  Rose Married A Man Named Calvert 
Rose Dewitt Bukater Eventually Became Rose Calvert
        

Although Rose Dewitt Bukater changed her name to “Dawson” to honor Jack, used this name during her acting career, and ultimately revealed she never got over Jack, she moved on and got married at some point in her life. Rose married a man named “Calvert” and moved to Cedar Rapids, and that’s the only information there is about her husband. Mr. Calvert passed away before Rose met Lovett and company, but Titanic’s ending completely sold him short. Mr. Calvert never knew about Jack, he was nowhere to be seen in the photos old Rose took with her, and in the afterlife right at the end of Titanic, Rose reunited with Jack and the rest of the passengers who died in the sinking of the Titanic, and Mr. Calvert wasn’t included in Rose’s life after death.





 4  Rose Had Children (&amp; Grandchildren) 
Only One Grandchild Is Shown
        

Rose not only married Mr. Calvert, but she formed a family with him. Rose and Mr. Calvert had children, though it’s unclear how many, and it’s only mentioned that she “punched out a couple of kids”. Rose was also a grandmother, though how many grandchildren she had is also unknown. One of them, Elizabeth (who she called “Lizzie”), accompanied her to the Keldysh research vessel to meet Lovett and his crew and became the only family member to learn about Jack Dawson’s existence and his romance with Rose.





 3  Rose Rode A Horse On The Beach 
She Honored Jack With Her Choices
        

When Rose and Jack were getting to know each other, Rose mentioned she would have loved to be free like Jack and to imagine they went to the Santa Monica pier, where Jack used to make portraits for a living. Jack said they would drink cheap beer, ride the roller coaster until they got sick, and ride horses on the beach, but she had to do it “like a real cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff”. The photos Rose brought with her to the Keldysh are shown at the end of Titanic, and one of those sees young Rose riding a horse on the beach, like a cowboy, with the pier and the roller coaster in the background, so she fulfilled one of the plans she made with Jack.

Although Titanic&#39;s ending is a big part of what makes the film so popular, it actually leaves a huge question about Rose&#39;s fate unanswered.








 2  Rose Flew A Plane 
This Is Another Tie To Jack
        

The above-mentioned photos show some of the many things Rose did and achieved after she broke free from Cal and her family following the sinking of the Titanic. One of the photos shows Rose next to a plane, showing that young Rose had the chance to fly a plane at some point. This has been interpreted as a reference to Jack and Rose’s song “Come Josephine in My Flying Machine”, thus also linking this memory to Jack, though in a more subtle and even ambiguous way. Of course, flying has also long been equated with freedom as well, and Rose and Jack discussed being free.





 1  Rose Went Ice Fishing 
Jack Used To Go Ice Fishing
        

Riding a horse on the beach like a cowboy is not the only activity Rose did after the tragedy of the Titanic that is directly linked to her story with Jack. When Rose and Jack first met (that is, when he saved her life), Jack mentioned going ice-fishing in his hometown, and this stayed in Rose’s memory for years. One of the photos at the end of Titanic shows that Rose went fishing at some point, referencing her conversation about ice fishing with Jack. Rose Dewitt Bukater honored Jack not only by taking his name but in many of the choices she made following his death.
