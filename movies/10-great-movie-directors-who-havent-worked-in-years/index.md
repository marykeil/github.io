## Literature Review

From up-and-coming auteurs to the most influential and established filmmakers of all time, no director is immune to the unexplained years-long hiatus.




It can come as a surprise that there are many great movie directors who haven&#39;t worked in years. Whatever their reasons for going on a years-long hiatus from filmmaking, the prolonged absence of great directors can cause not just speculation about their personal lives, but also typically results in higher demand for their films. It&#39;s actually not uncommon for even highly successful film directors to take long-term breaks from their duties in the entertainment industry.
Even the best movie directors of all time aren&#39;t immune to taking such long breaks. Whether it&#39;s a case of burnout from the notoriously demanding job, pursuing other artforms, or more serious career trouble, it&#39;s not unusual for a director to take a hiatus that can last for several years. Regrettably, even just one poorly-received feature can derail the careers of even the most promising film directors, suddenly halting their consecutive years of making movies. In any case, when great directors stop making films, it deeply affects not just the audiences craving their unique cinematic style, but also the actors and other professionals that they&#39;ve collaborated with over the years.









 








 10  Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Beverly Hills Cop) 
Last Feature Film: Gigli (2003)


 







After directing Gigli - one of the three career-ending movies Ben Affleck somehow survived in 2003 - American director Martin Brest hasn&#39;t made any new full features. For long-time followers of the filmmaker, it&#39;s unfair to judge Brest by Gigli alone. Best known for his work in the &#39;80s and &#39;90s, the director&#39;s most notable movies include Meet Joe Black, Beverly Hills Cop, and Scent of a Woman, which earned Brest critical acclaim particularly for directing Al Pacino to a Best Actor Oscar-winning performance. Despite his later hiatus and a rather short filmography, Brest&#39;s impact on popular cinema endures through his highly influential early films.





 9  Na Hong-jin (The Wailing, The Chaser) 
Last Feature Film: The Wailing (2016)
        

A rising star in the action and crime genres, South Korean director Na Hong-jin is the mind behind the intense and violent crime dramas The Chaser and The Yellow Sea. In 2016, Na Hong-jin revolutionized modern horror through The Wailing, a movie driven by its genre-bending twists and unorthodox storytelling. He hasn&#39;t directed any new feature films since then. It&#39;s a pity because Hong-jin has earned critical and audience acclaim for his meticulous directing, attention to detail, and keen understanding of tension-building. The director made the short thriller Faith in 2023, but Na Hong-jin&#39;s loyal followers are still waiting for his next full feature.

 8  Peter Weir (Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show) 
Last Feature Film: The Way Back (2010)


 







Australian director Peter Weir earned Academy Award nominations for Best Director in films such as Dead Poets Society, The Truman Show, Witness, and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. With a cinematic style characterized by strong character development and a knack for capturing poignant moments, Weir has certainly made his mark on blockbuster cinema. Unfortunately, this trend of Oscar nominations didn&#39;t extend to his 2010 true story-inspired drama, The Way Back, even though it also starred Colin Farrell, Jim Sturgess, and Ed Harris. While Hollywood and audiences alike mourn the long absence of Weir&#39;s mainstream artistic vision, there&#39;s a reason why Peter Weir quit making movies.





 7  Panos Cosmatos (Beyond the Black Rainbow, Mandy) 
Last Feature Film: Mandy (2018)
        

Despite being the son of Tombstone and Rambo 2 director George P. Cosmatos, Panos quickly stepped out of his father&#39;s shadow through his mastery of horror and psychedelia. In Beyond the Black Rainbow, Panos Cosmatos delivers a sci-fi horror tale steeped in surreal imagery and American history. Meanwhile, Mandy takes the same concepts and infuses them with action and an even deeper sense of melancholic insanity. While these films received mixed reviews, they showcase Cosmatos&#39; uniquely strange vision and engaging methods of pushing cinematic boundaries. Unfortunately, Cosmatos hasn&#39;t created anything else after Mandy, leaving the world wanting for his fresh takes on contemporary sci-fi, horror, and fantasy.

 6  Joe Dante (Gremlins, Small Soldiers) 
Last Feature Film: Nightmare Cinema (2018)
        

It&#39;s no surprise that Joe Dante was one of the three directors hired for Nightmare Cinema, an anthology horror mystery film about a haunted movie theater. Indeed, Dante is known for directing Gremlins, one of the most influential creature features of all time. What&#39;s surprising is that Dante hasn&#39;t directed more full features after Nightmare Cinema. From Gremlins and The &#39;Burbs to Small Soldiers, Dante has shown a knack for satirical storytelling, genre-blending, and exploring suburban paranoia with a comedic touch. Dante has directed more TV series than films in the last decade, and American filmmaking remains lacking without his fantastical take on mainstream horror comedy.





 5  Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira, Steamboy) 
Last Feature Film: Short Peace (2013)
        

One of the best anime movies of all time, Akira, was not only directed by Katsuhiro Otomo - he also wrote the manga that the landmark cyberpunk action film is based on. Indeed, Otomo&#39;s contributions to cinema include pushing the boundaries of animated storytelling, introducing mature and thought-provoking content, and inspiring a generation of filmmakers worldwide. While Otomo is among the most influential Japanese writers and filmmakers of this era, his last work involving a full feature was 2013&#39;s Short Peace, in which he directed a segment of the acclaimed sci-fi fantasy. Otomo is also known for directing Steamboy and Memories, but his most impactful film remains to be Akira.

 4  Francis Ford Coppola (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now) 
Last Feature Film: Distant Vision (2016)
        

Renowned for his role in The Godfather trilogy, Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s directorial style is marked by rich character development and profound exploration of power dynamics. Apocalypse Now further showcased his ability to navigate complex narratives, earning critical acclaim for its portrayal of the Vietnam War, and eventually inspiring countless films in the anti-war subgenre. Coppola&#39;s cinematic contributions include redefining the gangster movie, pioneering innovative filmmaking techniques, and being a key figure in the New Hollywood era. His latest project, Distant Vision, sees Coppola exploring experimental film in a personal and inter-generational narrative. Meanwhile, expectations are high for Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s upcoming movie Megalopolis.





 3  Bong Joon Ho (Parasite, Snowpiercer) 
Last Feature Film: Parasite (2019)


 







Bong Joon Ho&#39;s Parasite made history by winning the Palme d&#39;Or and multiple Oscars, illustrating Bong&#39;s ability to seamlessly weave social commentary and dark humor into compelling narratives. Alongside Parasite, Snowpiercer and The Host exemplify his mastery of merging genres, combining social issues with elements of science fiction and horror. The director has even shown a penchant for family-oriented adventure in Okja. Bong&#39;s cinematic contributions include breaking language and genre barriers, gaining international recognition for contemporary Korean cinema, and influencing a new wave of filmmakers. Apart from the upcoming sci-fi drama Mickey 17, not much else is known about Bong&#39;s future film plans.





 2  Raya Martin (Independencia, How to Disappear Completely) 
Last Feature Film: Death of Nintendo (2020)
        

While Raya Martin is an obscure name in the west, he is the first Filipino to be accepted in the Cannes Film Festival&#39;s Cinéfondation Résidence, a non-profit program for post-graduate student filmmakers. His most notable films include Smaller and Smaller Circles, a crime thriller about priests investigating a gruesome murder, and Independencia, an authentically produced experimental silent film about the cultural history of the Philippines. Martin further explores this history in Death of Nintendo - a comedic period movie set in the &#39;90s. Characterized by avant-garde approaches that challenge filmmaking conventions, Martin&#39;s career makes him one of the most promising albeit relatively unknown Asian filmmakers today.





 1  Spike Lee (Malcolm X, Do The Right Thing) 
Last Feature Films: David Byrne&#39;s American Utopia, Da 5 Bloods (2020)
        

A trailblazing director known for his impactful films addressing race, identity, and social issues, Spike Lee &#39;s works often feature bold visual choices and powerful narratives that confront systemic injustices. Do the Right Thing is a seminal work, capturing racial tensions in a Brooklyn neighborhood during a scorching summer day. Malcolm X is a biographical epic exploring the life of the civil rights leader. Lee&#39;s impact transcends the entertainment industry, promoting diversity in filmmaking, and using his platform to address social challenges. Lee&#39;s last movies were David Byrne&#39;s American Utopia and Da 5 Bloods. While he may seem to be on hiatus, Lee actually has several upcoming movies.
