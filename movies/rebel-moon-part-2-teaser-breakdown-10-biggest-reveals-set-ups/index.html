  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Released a few days after the premiere of the first movie, the teaser trailer for Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver sets up and reveals many exciting things to come in the Netflix sequel. Broken up into two movies, Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Rebel Moon follows Kora, a mysterious farmer living on Veldt. When the Motherworld&rsquo;s forces arrive to threaten the small moon, she travels across the universe with a fellow farmer named Gunnar and recruits warriors to fight to defend her home.
The first installment, Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire introduces many characters, develops some of their relationships, and hints at the massive battle yet to come. Based on what can be seen in the trailer for Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver, the sequel will give more insight into the characters&rsquo; backstories, develop more relationships, and deliver an exciting finale as Kora and her new allies fight to protect Veldt. There are many other more specific things the trailer teases that fans can look forward to seeing with the release of Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver in April 2024.</p>

10 Biggest Rebel Moon Questions Part 2 Needs To Answer
The first part of Zack Snyder&rsquo;s Rebel Moon saga gets the story started, but there are still many questions that the sequel needs to address.</p>
<p>10  A Giant Battle On Veldt
The intense battle teased in Rebel Moon: Part One will take place in Part Two.</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The exciting final action sequence at the end of Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire seems to suggest that the main antagonist, Admiral Atticus Noble, is defeated and that the battle on Veldt will never happen. Characters even make remarks about how the fight that they have been recruited for won&rsquo;t actually occur. However, the final reveal that Noble is, in fact, alive teases the idea that the fight isn&rsquo;t over yet, and the first trailer for The Scargiver all but confirms this.
The teaser for the second part of Rebel Moon is full of action. Gunfire fills the beautiful, usually peaceful Veldt landscape while dozens of imperial warships are shown landing on the small moon. Plenty of explosions and shots of intense battle sequencesappear in the trailer, teasing some exciting moments to look forward to in the sequel involving the epic climactic showdown that Kora and her team of warriors have prepared for.</p>
<p>9  Veldt Farmers Training Alongside Skilled Warriors
Peaceful farmers will learn to become warriors in order to defend their home.</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>In preparation for the massive battle on Veldt, the experienced warriors who are recruited in A Child of Fire are shown in the Rebel Moon sequel&rsquo;s trailer training alongside the kindly locals. General Titus instructs them to &ldquo;gather every hunting rifle, every knife, every round of ammunition in the village&rdquo; in order to prepare for the fight. Farmers practice with straw men, and Nemesis does the same.
Sam showcases the skills she has developed with a weapon, and Titus remarks that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;impressive&quot;what she&rsquo;s capable of. This is especially satisfying since Sam is attacked by imperial soldiers in the first film. In The Scargiver, Sam and the other people of Veldt will have the weapons and the skills to fight back in a dazzling defense against the Realm.</p>
<p>8  The Return Of Admiral Atticus Noble &amp; The King&rsquo;s Gaze
The main antagonist of Rebel Moon is back to launch an attack on Veldt.</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>The attack against Veldt will be led by Admiral Atticus Noble, who is shown to have survived at the end of Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire. He appears in the sequel&rsquo;s teaser trailer recovering in the same vat of liquid seen in the first movie. In the final moments of the trailer, he stands face to face with Kora, as the two prepare to fight each other again. The question remains, however, whether he will be defeated for good in The Scargiver.
The King&rsquo;s Gaze — the massive, imperial ship commanded by Noble — is shown returning to Veldt in the trailer. This is interesting considering Darrian Bloodaxe crashes the ship into a bridge during the final battle in A Child of Fire, presumably causing it a lot of damage. It does, however, fall in line with what Kora said would happen next at the end of the first film: that the Realm will recall the ship since Noble is presumed dead. In The Scargiver, the King&rsquo;s Gaze seems to have been effectively repaired and is preparing to launch an attack against Veldt.</p>

<p>7  A Look Into General Titus&rsquo; Tragic Past
Rebel Moon: Part Two may reveal how Titus&rsquo;s men were killed.</p>
<p>Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire reveals that, upon surrendering to the Imperium, Titus&rsquo;s men were all killed. He holds a tremendous amount of guilt because of this, but Kora motivates him to join the fight against the Motherworld in order to avenge his men. The trailer for The Scargiver indicates that the sequel will dive more into Titus&rsquo;s backstory and reveal what exactly happened to his men.
A group of men appears in the trailer bound, on their knees, with bags over their heads, and they have matching crying eye symbols on them. The men are seemingly bombed while Titus stands at a distance, wearing a suit of armor and crying out for them. This is likely the incident in which his men were killed. These scenes in the trailer indicate that the film will reveal more about Titus and the tragic events that ultimately motivated him to join the fight for Veldt.</p>

<p>6  More Insight Into Kora&rsquo;s Past
There are still many unanswered questions about Kora&rsquo;s backstory.</p>
<p>The Rebel Moon sequel will apparently give a greater look into Kora&rsquo;s harrowing backstory. Many things are revealed about Kora&rsquo;s past in A Child of Fire. After her home world was brutalized by the Motherworld and her family was killed, she was adopted by Balisarius, given the name &ldquo;Arthelais,&rdquo; and trained as a soldier. She conquered many worlds and killed many people in the name of the Realm, earning the moniker &ldquo;Scargiver&rdquo; before she became Princess Issa&rsquo;s sworn protector. She deserted her position and came to live on Veldt, becoming, as Noble explains, the most wanted fugitive in the universe.
Kora appears in the trailer for The Scargiver with the short hair she had and the clothes she wore while she was Arthelais, standing next to a burning landscape. She shouts as she approaches someone, pointing her gun at them. These seem to be flashbacks, indicating that the sequelwill reveal more about Kora&rsquo;s past. There are still many unanswered questions about her backstory, such as what role, if any, she played in Princess Issa&rsquo;s death, or why she was unable to save the princess. The Scargivermay give answers to these questions and more.</p>

<p>5  Darrian Bloodaxe Is Alive (Or Maybe Those Were Flashbacks)
Bloodaxe could be shown fighting again in the present or, perhaps, in the past.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s never confirmed, Bloodaxe presumably dies in A Child of Fire. After jumping onto the King&rsquo;s Gaze, he is shot multiple times by the pilot before stabbing and killing him. He then steers the ship into a bridge, crashing it. Millius, a fellow fighter in the rebellion, cries out at his presumed death, and Bloodaxe isn&rsquo;t seen or mentioned again.
In the sequel&rsquo;s teaser trailer, however, Bloodaxe appears standing in the midst of a battle, wielding a gun while explosions go off behind him. This hints thatBloodaxe is alive and set to return to fight in The Scargiver, or the film will include flashbacks that reveal more about his character. Either way, fans can look forward to seeing more of Bloodaxe in Rebel Moon: Part Two.</p>
<p>4  More Development For Kora &amp; Gunnar&rsquo;s Relationship
The pair kiss in the Rebel Moon: Part Two trailer.</p>
<p>From the moment they are introduced in the first film, it is clear that Gunnar has feelings for Kora. He admires her as she farms in the opening scene. Later, when he is commanded to kill Kora, Noble proclaims that Gunnar loves her before Gunnar fights back, freeing her and the rest of the captured rebels. The two bond throughout A Child of Fire as they travel across the Rebel Moon universe to recruit fighters to defend Veldt.
Kora opens up to Gunnar and reveals dark truths about her past, and he grabs her hand to comfort her. Based on their passionate kiss in the trailer for The Scargiver, the sequel will include even more development for Kora and Gunnar&rsquo;s relationship, revealing that the feelings between them are mutual. Considering what Kora&rsquo;s friend Hagan says in the first film, perhaps Kora starting a relationship with Gunnar will allow her to finally be considered a fully integrated member of the Veldt farming community.</p>
<p>3  Kora&rsquo;s New Hairstyle
Her haircut shows she&rsquo;s ready for battle and calls back to her past as Arthelais.</p>
<p>Kora appears in the trailer for the Rebel Moon sequel with a hairstyle similar to the one she had as Arthelais. Perhaps this haircut shows that Kora will tap back into the fighter mentality she had when she was Arthelais in order to defend Veldt. Maybe this haircut also indicates that Kora will fully come to terms with her past as Arthelais. By donning a similar appearance as she did back then, perhaps Kora will show that her past doesn&rsquo;t haunt her anymore.</p>

How Many Rebel Moon Movies Will There Be?
The first two Rebel Moon movies are confirmed and will appear on Netflix, but Zack Snyder has plans to expand his new space opera further.</p>
<p>2  More Of Jimmy
The lovable robot will appear once again in Rebel Moon: Part Two.</p>
<p>Close</p>
<p>Jimmy stands out as a kind and lovely character in A Child of Fire. Although he&rsquo;s a robot, Jimmy shows more compassion and humility than most of his imperial soldier counterparts. He appears in the trailer for The Scargiver warning the other characters that they won&rsquo;t win their fight against the Motherworld and donning the deer-like antlers he wears at the end of the first film.
Jimmy was once a soldier for the Realm and was programmed to fight to defend the king. He shows his potential to fight once more in Rebel Moon: Part One when he delivers the final gunshot that saves Sam&rsquo;s life. Exactly what Jimmy&rsquo;s role in Rebel Moon: Part Two will be is yet to be seen, but based on his sense of humanity and his actions in the first film, it&rsquo;s likely Jimmy will fight to protect Veldt or otherwise assist in their defense against the Realm.</p>
<p>1  A Potential New Character
The Scargiver trailer reveals a potentially new, presumably high-ranking character.</p>
<p>One minute into the trailer, the back of an unknown character appears. They are wearing a black suit jacket with a black skirt or dress and a shirt with a large, white collar. Their arms are outstretched in front of skyscrapers that a giant ship, perhaps the King&rsquo;s Gaze, crashes into. A black, smokey sky is in front of them, and the silhouette of another character wearing a hat is behind them.
Based on this character&rsquo;s clothing, they appear to be a high-ranking member of the Imperium. Noble is also seen wearing similarly formal clothing in A Child of Fire, which seems to be a clue to his status. Who this character is in Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver and what role they will play in the sequel has yet to be seen.
Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver
Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver is the second part of Zack Snyder&rsquo;s sci-fi epic and will continue the story where the prior movie leaves off. Little details exist on the project besides its release in April 2024.
Release Date   April 19, 2024    Director   Zack Snyder    Writers   Zack Snyder    Cast   Sofia Boutella , Ed Skrein , Anthony Hopkins , Djimon Hounsou , Michiel Huisman</p>
