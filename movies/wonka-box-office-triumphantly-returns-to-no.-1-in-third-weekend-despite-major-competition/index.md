## Literature Review
Wonka bounces back to No. 1 at the domestic box office the weekend after it was knocked down by the Christmas release Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.




Wonka has bounced back up to the top of the box office chart. The new movie musical, which is a prequel to the 1971 Roald Dahl adaptation Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and was directed by Paddington&#39;s Paul King, stars Timothée Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka attempting to start up his chocolate empire. The movie kicked off the holiday season when it opened two weekends before Christmas, claiming the No. 1 spot at the box office with a 3-day haul of $39 million.




Per Deadline, the Wonka box office has scored another golden ticket in North America. After falling to No. 2 behind Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom over Christmas weekend, the movie is projected to dominate New Year&#39;s in its third weekend with a 4-day total of $33 million. This total means the movie will reclaim the No. 1 slot, something that was presaged by the fact that it had already been No. 1 on the daily chart three consecutive times since the day after Christmas.


 How Long Can Wonka Stay At No. 1? 
          

The Wonka release has shown an astounding audience hold during its first three weekends at the domestic box office. The fact that it has risen above all seven major wide-release titles that debuted over the 4-day Christmas weekend is already impressive. However, the tendency for holiday hits to continue to show good week-on-week holds through January could mean that Wonka is at the beginning of a streak of No. 1 weekends.




One thing that helped the Wonka musical reclaim the top slot this weekend was the fact that it has rather consistently been dominating other holiday releases. In a weekend without any new theatrical wide releases, it was only natural for the movie that was trending above the others to claim the top slot. However, as 2024 heats up, there will be slightly more competition in the theatrical marketplace.



The seven major holiday movies other than Wonka are Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, The Color Purple, Anyone But You, Migration, Ferrari, The Iron Claw, and The Boys in the Boat.




Wonka will first have to square off against the Blumhouse horror movie Night Swim. The PG-13 title could very well open below the musical, which has a broader family demographic, unless it gets a boost from being created by the producers of M3GAN, 2023&#39;s surprise January horror hit. However, it seems probable that the Chalamet movie will at least have a streak of two No. 1 weekends in a row, though a streak of three will be challenged more vigorously by the release of the rival IP-driven musical Mean Girls the following weekend.
