## Literature Review

Jasmin Savoy Brown, who plays Mindy, breaks her silence on the behind-the-scenes controversies that have plagued the development of Scream 7.




Scream 7 has experienced a rocky development, and Mindy actor Jasmin Savoy Brown now addresses the franchise and her recent reunion with her costars. After the success of 2022&#39;s Scream and its 2023 sequel, it was promptly announced that a seventh film is in the works. The sequel, however, has experienced a host of behind-the-scenes issues, including the departures of Scream 6 cast members Melissa Barrera and Jenna Ortega, in addition to the departure of director Christopher Landon.




Now, with the confirmed Scream 7 in a state of limbo, Brown breaks her silence on the behind-the-scenes drama during a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight.


 

The actor is careful not to directly address any specific behind-the-scenes developments, instead celebrating the Core Four and the recent red carpet reunion the cast had at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund&#39;s 17th Annual Evening Before event. Check out her full comment below:


“I think that everything that we did, the Core Four, is amazing and important and should be celebrated forever. And I’m glad that we got to capture that on-screen, and I’m proud to have four people of color in that horror film.
“It was so random and fun [to reunite]. We did not plan that. Jenna [Ortega] is my heart and soul, I’ll protect her forever. I love her, I love Melissa [Barrera], I love Jack [Quaid], I love Mason [Gooding]. They just make me happy. It’s fun to see them.”





  


 Scream 7&#39;s Behind-The-Scenes Issues Explained 
Why Melissa Barrera &amp; Jenna Ortega Aren&#39;t Returning
          

The Scream 6 box office success took the franchise to new heights, but enthusiasm for Ghostface&#39;s return took a hit when it was announced that Barrera, who plays Sam Carpenter in the two most recent installments, had been fired. Barrera was let go from the sequel due to her social media posts about the Israel-Hamas conflict, which Spyglass deemed antisemitic. The actor would later address her firing, condemning antisemitism and &#34;prejudice of any kind,&#34; while affirming that she will continue to use her platform to speak out about issues she is passionate about.




Days later, it was also announced that Ortega would not be returning as Tara Carpenter in Scream 7, a role she had played in the previous two installments. It should be noted, however, that the actor reportedly left the sequel months before the news was actually reported in the trades, meaning it wasn&#39;t a response to Barrera&#39;s firing. Reports state that Ortega&#39;s departure from Scream 7 was mostly due to scheduling conflicts with Wednesday season 2, though disagreements over salary could also have been a factor.



Wednesday season 2 is set to start filming this April in the U.K.




As if the loss of two key actors wasn&#39;t bad enough, Landon, who had been announced as the Scream 7 director last summer, confirmed in December that he had left the project. He calls the movie a &#34;dream job that turned into a nightmare,&#34; though he didn&#39;t elaborate beyond that. Now down two stars and a director, Scream 7 remains a big question mark, and it&#39;s not clear how Spyglass will carry the franchise forward.






Scream (2022) and Scream 6 are both available to stream on Paramount Plus.
