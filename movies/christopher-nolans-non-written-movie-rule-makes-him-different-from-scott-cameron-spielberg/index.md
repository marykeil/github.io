# Christopher Nolans Non-Written Movie Rule Makes Him Different From Scott, Cameron &amp; Spielberg


## SUMMARY 



  Christopher Nolan has never made a sequel outside of the Batman movies, which sets him apart from other major directors like Spielberg and Cameron.   Nolan&#39;s decision not to make sequels to his non-Batman films has made his filmography even better, as each movie is a unique and complete experience.   While it could be interesting to see Nolan revisit some of his original stories, the element of surprise in not knowing what he will direct next is worth sacrificing sequels.

## Literature Review



One non-written Christopher Nolan movie rule makes his career different from that of other major blockbuster directors like Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Steven Spielberg. One of the most influential filmmakers of his generation, Christopher Nolan arguably changed how blockbusters are made and set the bar high when it comes to the movie experience. While Nolan’s filmography will always be associated with the game-changing Batman trilogy, especially The Dark Knight, his career has followed one exciting rule regarding original stories.




After Memento granted Nolan the opportunity to tackle Batman, the director went on to become one of the most important names behind the camera in Hollywood. Not many directors can become a “brand” themselves as recognizable names that audiences trust will always deliver good work, and Nolan is part of that select group. Still, compared to other filmmakers who directed multiple commercial successes across different genres, Christopher Nolan’s movie career includes one major difference.


 Christopher Nolan Has Never Made A Sequel Outside The Batman Movies 
          

Christopher Nolan has directed two sequels – or a sequel and a threequel – both of which were part of the Dark Knight trilogy. Following the critical and commercial success of Batman Begins, which revitalized the Batman movie franchise after the Batman &amp; Robin fiasco, it was clear that the studio would want more films from that same creative team. Likewise, after The Dark Knight’s billion-dollar success, it was only natural that Nolan and his team returned for at least one more Batman. That said, when it comes to non-Batman movies, Nolan has never made a sequel – neither to one of his films nor to other franchises.




This is a significant difference compared to the filmographies of some of the best directors of all time, including Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, and James Cameron. Scott has revisited the world of Alien, a movie franchise he began, twice now with Prometheus and Alien: Covenant. Spielberg has directed multiple sequels to some of his most iconic movies, namely in the Jurassic Park and Indiana Jones franchises. Lastly, James Cameron has directed sequels to movies he was not originally involved with, such as Piranha II and Aliens, as well as to his films – Terminator 2 and all the Avatar sequels. Nolan, however, never made an Inception 2 or Tenet 2.



 Christopher Nolan’s Sequel Rule Makes His Filmography Even Better 
          

Whether Nolan consciously decided not to make sequels to any of his non-Batman films is difficult to say. Regardless, Nolan’s “sequel rule” has made his filmography and career even better. By not revisiting his original stories, such as Inception and Memento, Nolan has retroactively made those movies better. For example, more than a decade later, Inception’s open ending is still at the center of debates and theories. Each new Christopher Nolan film feels like an event, mostly because it will not be the beginning of a multi-movie story but rather one definitive experience with a clear beginning, middle, and end.




Of course, having Nolan revisit one of his non-Batman films in a sequel or even a prequel could be interesting. For example, an Inception prequel could make for a great movie. Likewise, a new story set in the world of Tenet could follow new characters and play with the concepts of the first movie again. Still, considering how every new Christopher Nolan film, including the record-breaking Oppenheimer, sees the director trying something different, sequels are not really necessary for his career. Being surprised by what Christopher Nolan will direct next is worth the fact he might never revisit his previous movies.
