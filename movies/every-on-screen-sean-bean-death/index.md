## Literature Review

British actor Sean Bean has become one of Hollywood’s most killable actors, with a staggering two dozen on-screen deaths in his nearly 40 year career.




The number of Sean Bean deaths throughout the actor&#39;s long career has become so numerous that few have been killed on-screen as often, and the Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones star is perhaps best known for his ability to sell a death scene. Bean is known for his tough demeanor and piercing performances, but his success as an actor has become somewhat overshadowed by his propensity for death. Sean Bean has been involved in some of the most impactful death scenes in history, having died in 24 separate films and TV shows, comprising approximately a quarter of his on-screen catalog. From stabbing to shootings to death via cow, every Sean Bean death is different.
Bean has appeared in several of the most successful franchises in history, including James Bond, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones. As if to highlight the high body count of his characters, Sean Bean dies in each of those franchises. Whether it be getting offed by Bond in GoldenEye, Boromir&#39;s heroic death in Lord of the Rings, or Ned Stark&#39;s execution in Game of Thrones, Bean is known for making a memorable exit — and it&#39;s almost more surprising when his characters are still alive by the time the credits roll. Taking a look at all the Sean Bean deaths makes it clear how he earned this unusual reputation.
            
 
 10 Actors Who Do The Same Thing In Almost Every Movie 
Just like Brad Pitt&#39;s always eating, there are certain character quirks and personality traits that actors bring to all of their movies.












 








 1  Caravaggio (1986) 
Method Of Death: Throat Slashed
        

 One of Sean Bean&#39;s earliest movies, Caravaggio, is a fictionalized retelling of events from the life of the baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio. Bean plays Ranuccio Tommasoni, an acquaintance of Caravaggio’s who develops a deadly infatuation. Sean Bean&#39;s first on-screen death came in this movie when Ranuccio had his throat slashed by the titular artist. Although there is some debate regarding the artist’s intentions, the real Caravaggio did murder Ranuccio — though it was as a result of a duel via a lacerated femoral artery that some theorize was meant to castrate him.





 2  War Requiem (1989) 
Method Of Death: Bayonetted
        

 War Requiem is a film adaptation of a 1963 musical piece of the same name written by Benjamin Britten. The film is notably different from every modern war movie as there is no dialogue or sound effects other than what is included in the original recording, using only music and Wilfred Owen’s own words to tell his story. Bean plays an unnamed German soldier who is fatally stabbed with a bayonet by the main character.





 3  Lorna Doone (1990) 
Method Of Death: Drowned
        

 Lorna Doone is a British TV movie based on the 1869 novel of the same name by R.D. Blackmore. West Country yeoman John Ridd vows to avenge to death of his father by destroying the notorious Doone Clan, but his plan is quickly interrupted when he falls in love with their daughter, Lorna. The story is as romantic as it is tragic, seemingly taking nods from the works and plays of William Shakespeare. Sean Bean plays Carver Doone, heir to the Doone family who kills Lorna on her wedding day before being chased into a bog and subsequently drowning.





 4  The Field (1990) 
Method Of Death: Death By Cow
        

 The Field is an Irish drama film based on the 1965 stage play by John B. Keane. “Bull” McCabe has spent three decades tending a plot of land tending a field on the Irish bluffs, but when the widow who owns the plot puts it up for auction, McCabe will do anything to keep the land from falling into the hands of an ill-intentioned American businessman. Sean Bean plays Tadgh McCabe, the emotionally stunted son of “Bull”, who is pushed off of a cliff by a herd of cattle in the film’s climax. The Field was nominated for several Academy Awards, including a Best Actor nomination for lead actor Richard Harris.

 5  Clarissa (1991) 
Method Of Death: Stabbed
        

 Clarissa is a British period drama series based on the 1748 novel by Samuel Richardson. The story follows the virtuous Clarissa (Saskia Wickham) as she is manipulated by family members and potential suitors in search of her inherited fortune. Sean Bean plays Lovelace, Clarissa’s love interest who reveals his true intentions in the story’s climax before being fatally stabbed by his disapproving comrades.





 6  Patriot Games (1992) 
Method Of Death: Impaled By An Anchor


 







Patriot Games is the second entry in the Jack Ryan movie franchise based on Tom Clancy&#39;s novels, serving as an effective sequel to 1990’s Hunt for Red October (although many of the roles were recast). After thwarting an assassination attempt on the British Minister of State, Jack Ryan becomes the target of a powerful Irish terrorist group bent on revenge.
Sean Bean plays Sean Miller in Patriot Games, a high-ranking member of the terrorist group whose brother is killed during the attempted assassination. Miller is ultimately killed during the high-octane climax, rammed onto an anchor atop a moving boat by Jack Ryan in the movie’s end. This memorable scene was one of the first that put Sean Bean on the map as a go-to actor for convincing death scenes.





 7  Scarlett (1994) 
Method Of Death: Stabbed
        

 Scarlett is an American miniseries based on the 1991 book by Alexandra Ripley, which served as an effective sequel to Margaret Mitchell’s 1936 novel Gone With the Wind. The story follows the eponymous Scarlett O’Hara (Joanne Whalley-Kilmer) on a journey around the world as she meets various friends and family members in an attempt to win back Rhett’s heart. Sean Bean plays Lord Richard Fenton, an Irish noble with a romantic interest in Scarlett. When Fenton rapes one of his female servants, the woman retaliates by stabbing and killing the Lord, a murder for which Scarlett takes the blame.





 8  GoldenEye (1995) 
Method Of Death: Crushed By A Satellite Dish


 







GoldenEye is the first of the Pierce Brosnan James Bond movies, the 17th film in the 007 franchise, and the first Bond story to not be adapted from the works of author Ian Fleming. After a mission gone awry, Agent 006 is presumed dead. Nearly a decade after the failed mission when a deadly satellite falls into the hands of a Russian crime syndicate, it becomes clear that things are not as they seem.


Sean Bean plays Agent 006 Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye, who is thrown from the satellite in the climactic fight with Bond and then has the dish crash on top of him. While this wasn&#39;t the first Sean Bean death, it was arguably the most prominent of his career until that point, and still ranks among those that first come to mind when discussing his many on-screen fatalities.

Actor Sean Bean seems to have a knack for dying brutish deaths in his films. Here are 7 of Bean&#39;s deaths we found to be particularly ugly.








 9  Airborne (1998) 
Method Of Death: Shot
        

 Airborne is a little-known 1990s action film with a famous cast and forgettable story. A group of thieves break into a top-secret government facility and steal a deadly virus, so a special ops team called Mach 1 is tasked with recovering it. Sean Bean plays Dave Toombs, the leader of the thieves who is fatally shot by Bill McNeil (played by comedy actor Steve Guttenberg) in the film’s climax.





 10  Essex Boys (2000) 
Method Of Death: Shot
        

 Essex Boys is a British crime film loosely based on real events. In 1995, three notorious drug dealers from Rettendon, Essex, UK were lured to Workhouse Lane where they were gunned down while sitting in their car. Sean Bean plays Jason Locke, a fictionalized version of one of the drug dealers who was shot and killed on that day in 1995.





 11  Don’t Say A Word (2001) 
Method Of Death: Buried Alive
        

Don’t Say A Word is a psychological thriller based on the 1991 novel by Andrew Klavan. A team of thieves kidnaps the daughter of a prominent psychiatrist, forcing him to extract a passcode from a girl with PTSD that will unveil the location of a precious gem in exchange for his daughter’s life. Sean Bean plays Patrick Koster, the leader of the thieves who is kicked into a grave and buried by an excavator in the film’s climax. While Don&#39;t Say A Word isn&#39;t the most well-known Sean Bean death it is arguably one of the most difficult to watch, as being buried alive is a common feat.





 12  The Fellowship Of The Ring (2001) 
Method Of Death: Shot With Arrows


 







The Fellowship of the Ring is the first film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy based on the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. A group of representatives from various factions and races of Middle Earth is tasked with destroying a ring imbued with powerful magic in the fires of Mt. Doom before it could be used as an implement of war. Sean Bean plays Boromir, a dangerous and untrustworthy member of the Fellowship who redeems himself in his final moments by giving his life to protect the ring and those who bear it.


Boromir&#39;s death in The Fellowship of the Rings remains one of the high points of the trilogy. Sean Bean&#39;s death in The Lord of the Rings is a prolonged moment, with Boromir getting shot by multiple arrows before finally succumbing to his injuries. It&#39;s fair to say that until the release of Game of Thrones in 2011 the death of Boromir was the most well-known Sean Bean death.

Method Of Death: Shot


 







2002&#39;s Equilibrium is an Orwellian science fiction movie set in a dystopian and uncompassionate future. All emotion and artistic expression have been outlawed by the Tetragrammaton Council, and the populace is forced to take powerful psychoactive drugs to suppress their feelings. When an enforcement officer misses a dose, he begins to question the morality of his world, inevitably joining forces with a resistance movement to help take down the regime that he once defended. Sean Bean plays Partridge, a fellow enforcement officer who is shot and killed by the protagonist for reading poetry, an emotional act of defiance to the regime.





 14  Henry VIII (2003) 
Method Of Death: Hanged
        

 Henry VIII is a British miniseries based on the history of the infamous real-life King of England. The two-part series focuses on the 38-year reign of the controversial king, from his ascension to the throne up to his death in 1547. Henry VIII is among the most damning shows based on the English Monarchy, pulling few of its punches against the unscrupulous king. Sean Bean plays Robert Aske, a former comrade of Henry who is tricked by the nefarious king into incriminating himself, leading him to be hanged for treason.





 15  The Island (2005) 
Method Of Death: Shot With Grappling Hook And Hanged
        

 The Island is a science fiction thriller that has been described as a pastiche of the “escape from dystopia” style films popularized in the ‘60s and ‘70s. The residents of a futuristic facility labor under the promise that they might be granted the opportunity to move to the Island, a supposed utopia and the last uncontaminated place on Earth. However, one of the residents begins to uncover dark secrets when the woman he loves is chosen to leave the facility. Sean Bean plays Dr. Bernard Merrick, the scientist who runs the compound and is brutally killed by the protagonist in one of the most gruesome climaxes in any of Michael Bay’s movies.





 16  Far North (2007) 
Method Of Death: Froze
        

 Far North is an independently produced film based on the short story by Sara Maitland. The film follows two native women, Anja and Saiva, in the arctic regions of Siberia who come across a badly injured soldier (Bean) deserted in the frozen tundra.

Distraught, Loki flees naked into the cold to freeze in one of the most unique deaths in horror, let alone Bean’s career.

 17  Outlaw (2007) 
Method Of Death: Shot
        

 Outlaw is a British action thriller featuring a Boondock Saints-esque style of vigilantism. A group of people who feel betrayed by their government and let down by their Police force form a modern-day outlaw posse in order to right what they see as the wrongs of society. Sean Bean plays Danny Bryant, a member of the Outlaws who is killed in a firefight with a corrupt police force in the film’s climax. Bean&#39;s performance is solid as always, although this Sean Bean death is far less memorable than some of the more inventive ways his characters have died.





 18  The Hitcher (2007) 
Method Of Death: Shot


 







The Hitcher is a remake of the 1986 thriller by the same name. Two college students pick up a hitchhiker who quickly turns violent, with the two only barely managing to escape with their lives. When the couple finds themselves framed for murder, a terrifying game of cat and mouse begins between them and their newfound rival. The Hitcher is different than the original 1986 slasher flick, making the film more suspenseful than gruesome. Sean Bean plays the eponymous hitcher John Ryder, who is dramatically shot several times in the film’s final moments.





 19  Red Riding: The Year of Our Lord 1974 (2008) 
Method Of Death: Shot
        

 Red Riding: The Year of Our Lord 1974 is the first installment of the three-part Red Riding TV adaptation of the Red Riding Quartet novels by David Peace. Plagued by guilt, a corrupt police official attempts to solve the case of a missing schoolgirl after seeing connections between her disappearance and a rash of prior abductions. Sean Bean appears as John Dawson, an unscrupulous and powerful real estate developer seemingly involved in several gruesome murders, who is shot by the show’s protagonist in desperation shortly before he is killed in a car accident.





 20  Black Death (2010) 
Method Of Death: Torn And Quartered


 







Black Death is a German-British horror film set in medieval England. Set during the first outbreak of bubonic plague, a young monk is sent to investigate reports of people being brought back to life in a small village. Sean Bean plays Ulric, an envoy for the bishop who travels to the village with the monks only to be brutally ripped apart by horses after the group refuses to renounce their God. This is easily one of the most painful and gruesome Sean Bean deaths, even if Black Death isn&#39;t among the most renowned movies in his career.
