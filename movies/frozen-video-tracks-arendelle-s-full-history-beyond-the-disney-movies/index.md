## Literature Review
A new video gives an expansive look at the history of Frozen&#39;s Arendelle, from its founding to Elsa&#39;s coronation in the first hit movie.




A new video explores the entire history of Frozen&#39;s kingdom of Arendelle, compiling information from across the franchise. The kingdom was first established in 2013&#39;s influential Disney animated feature, which began as Idina Menzel&#39;s Elsa assumed the throne once she came of age. Frozen 2 would expand the realm of Arendelle into its surrounding territories and reveal secrets that were hidden about its darker history.




With Frozen 3 now on the way, YouTube channel Geekritique revisits the story of Frozen as it stands so far in an expansive timeline video that compiles lore established across the movies, animated shorts, and tie-in books to create a detailed history of Arendelle.


 

With the aid of dedicated fan group Arendelle Archives, the video begins with the grand designs of King Runeard (Jeremy Sisto), the shameful conflicts with Northuldra over the dam, Anna(Kristen Bell) and Elsa&#39;s troubled childhood, and the deaths of Agnarr (Alfred Molina) and Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood) that would lead into the original movie. The timeline takes into account the events of Joe Caramagna&#39;s comics that bridge the gap between each movie, as well as the novels Dangerous Secrets: The Story of Iduna and Agnarr, Forest of Shadows, and Polar Nights: Cast Into Darkness.





 Will Frozen 3 &amp; 4 Contradict Any Expanded Media Stories? 
          

At the end of Frozen 2, Arendelle once more underwent a transformation that will change the country forever. With Elsa and Anna righting the sins of Runeard&#39;s reign by destroying the dam between the kingdom and Northuldra, the younger sister assumed the throne once Elsa abdicated to take her place in the Enchanted Forest. Now married to Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), Anna leads the kingdom, with stories such as Polar Nights: Cast Into Darkness and the Frozen: Forces of Nature podcast exploring events following the second movie.

              Related   Where Elsa Goes At The End Of Frozen 2 &amp; What It Means For Frozen 3   Elsa rides off to a distant land at the end of Frozen 2, but where is she going, and how will her departure impact the plot of the upcoming Frozen 3?    




However, with Frozen returning to the big screen with two more movies, there is the question of whether the sequels will take the expanded media into account. While they were limited to a post-credits scene, the Snowgies from the short film Frozen Fever were acknowledged in the second movie, making the short canon. Furthermore, with stories set after Frozen 2, including Cast Into Darkness and Forces of Nature, focusing on lore established in the second movie, the creators of the next two installments are free to establish new tales that expand Arendelle without overwriting expanded media.

Despite only featuring in two movies, Geekritique&#39;s detailed video shows that Frozen&#39;s Arendelle has a rich, expansive history including cultural movements and a developed monarchy. The series has barely explored the histories before Runeard, leaving room for more of Arendelle&#39;s mysteries to be explored. While it is unknown what Frozen 3 and Frozen 4 could unveil, the detailed timeline is an informative glimpse at Disney&#39;s magical kingdom.






While Frozen 3 and Frozen 4 have yet to be slated in Disney&#39;s release schedule, Frozen and Frozen 2 are currently streaming on Disney&#43;.
