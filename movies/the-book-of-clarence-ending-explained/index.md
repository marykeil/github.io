Summary

  The Book of Clarence is a bold adventure story that reimagines biblical tales, such as the crucifixion of Jesus, with the character Clarence as a false messiah.   Clarence walks on water and performs miracles, converting him from an atheist to a believer, and leading to his crucifixion by order of Pontius Pilate.   The ending of the film reflects a deviation from its stoner-comedy beginnings, as Clarence&#39;s journey from a con artist to a believer is rewarded with resurrection by Jesus and a genuine knowledge of God&#39;s presence.  







The Book of Clarence ends with a poignant, and intentionally sacrilegious, reimagining of the crucifixion of Jesus. Written and directed by Jeymes Samuel (The Harder They Fall), The Book of Clarence is a bold adventure story of Lakeith Stanfield&#39;s Clarence, who is determined to prove to his brother Apostle brother Thomas (also played by Stanfield) that his life has great purpose. After being rejected as the 13th Apostle of Jesus, Clarence goes on a tour around Jerusalem with his best friend Elijah (RJ Cyler) proclaiming that he is the new messiah. This declaration brings about many new foes and oppressors, specifically the Roman Empire.

Along the way, Clarence earns the loyalty of the freed gladiator Barabbas (Omar Sy) and the affection of his long-time love interest Varinia (Anna Diop) before he is met by the formidable force of the Roman Empire in Pontius Pilate (James McAvoy). As the story goes, Pilate orders the crucifixion of Clarence, who has essentially replaced the role of Jesus in the film. Jesus is portrayed by Nicholas Pinnock in The Book of Clarence but takes a backseat to the false prophet Clarence who, by the end of the movie, is one of many charlatans who gets nailed to a cross but ultimately in the process finds his faith.




  7:25                       The Book Of Clarence Interview: Jeymes Samuel &amp; LaKeith Stanfield On Biblical Storytelling And Music Choices   The Book of Clarence star LaKeith Stanfield and filmmaker Jeymes Samuel discuss stepping into the strange and Biblical world of the apostles.   


 What Happens In The Book Of Clarence Ending 
          

The ending of The Book of Clarence begins once Clarence has established himself as the new messiah and is using his newfound charm to win over Varinia. After a party, he is confronted by Jedediah the Terrible (Eric Kofi-Abrefa)looking to claim his debt from Clarence. The Romans show up looking for Clarence with the intention of killing him and Jedediah stands up for him but yields when they threaten his sister, Varinia. In the process, Barabbas punches Roman commander Decimus (Tom Glynn-Carney) and runs away, only to be impaled by three thrown spears but still miraculously lives.




Clarence is taken before Pontius Pilate and comes clean about being a false messiah. Pontius Pilate instructs Clarence to prove he&#39;s a fraud by trying to walk on water, but by some miracle, Clarence actually walks on water. Pontius Pilate, who has grown to like Clarence, has no choice but to order his crucifixion. Clarence is then whipped and forced to carry a large wooden cross through Jerusalem and is ultimately crucified along with several other false prophets, including the beggar Benjamin (Benedict Cumberbatch). Clarence dies on the cross as Thomas, Varinia, and his mother watch tearfully, but is resurrected by Jesus.



 Did Varinia Set Up Clarence With Jedediah? 
          

As the sister of Jedediah, Clarence believes that Varinia set him up by agreeing to meet him at a party only to be met by Jedediah waiting for him outside. Varinia, who has been reluctant to show Clarence affection throughout the movie due to his apparent lack of honor, claims that Jedediah followed her and that she did not intentionally mean to set Clarence up. Varinia seems to be telling the truth as she remains compassionate towards Clarence through his crucifixion but by the time she is ready to love Clarence, he is already on his way to a death sentence.






 How Did Barabbas Survive The Roman&#39;s Spears? 
          

Jesus isn&#39;t the only character with miraculous healing powers in The Book of Clarence as Barabbas somehow survived being impaled by three spears, two of which go straight through his chest. When a Roman soldier goes to retrieve the spears from Barabbas&#39; apparently dead body, the former gladiator springs back to life and kills him before running away. The only explanation for Barabbas surviving such lethal force is the fact that earlier in the film, he claimed to be immortal, which proves to be somehow true. He claims that he can only be defeated through a strike in the heel like Achilles, but the Romans hit the wrong one, and Barabbas lived.

                  The Book Of Clarence Review: LaKeith Stanfield Is Brilliant In Bold &amp; Meaningful Biblical Comedy   Jeymes Samuel&#39;s The Book of Clarence has style &amp; daring concepts. LaKeith Stanfield&#39;s performance positions him as an actor who can do anything.   






 How Did Clarence Walk On Water? 
          

Clarence surprises himself when he walks on water in front of Pontius Pilate and a crowd of people who believe that he is the true messiah. Up until that point, Clarence had never done anything miraculous in his life despite fooling his followers through a series of scams that he was an actual prophet. By the logic of The Book of Clarence, Clarence is granted the ability by God to walk on water during that brief moment, which Clarence later tells Thomas that he does not only believe, but he knows. This converts Clarence from being an atheist to actually becoming an instrument of God but ultimately leads to his crucifixion.



 Why Was Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s Beggar Character Crucified? 
          




Jesus blesses the beggar Benjamin in The Book of Clarence, giving him the ability to produce shekels out of the palm of his hand. Benjamin uses that money to clean himself up and get a makeover, which makes him look like a spitting image of the traditional white Jesus Christ. While it&#39;s not explicitly shown how Benjamin is captured and crucified in the movie, it&#39;s safe to say that the Romans got a hold of him once they saw the miraculous power that Jesus gave him. Benjamin, like Clarence, is punished for possessing God-given gifts while the actual Jesus remains unscathed throughout the movie.

 The Real Meaning Of The Book Of Clarence Ending 
          




The intense ending of The Book of Clarence is quite a deviation from its stoner-comedy beginnings as the famous crucifixion of Jesus is retold through the lens of Clarence, an idol who was ultimately betrayed by God. Clarence spews blasphemy throughout the movie and rigidly remains a nonbeliever until God grants him the ability to walk on water which leads to his crucifixion. In this light, Clarence is punished by God for his atheism and blasphemy by being granted a God-given ability. This makes a believer out of Clarence in the end and finally gives him a sense of meaning in his life that he has sought throughout the film.

Even during his campaign as a false prophet, Clarence was able to perform some great deeds such as freeing Barabbas and many more Gladiator slaves as well as choosing not to betray Jesus as Judas had. Clarence&#39;s journey, which is driven mostly by the lust for power, status, and wealth, ultimately ends in his absolution and a genuine knowledge of God&#39;s presence and the true power of Jesus. He has become enlightened through this unlikely yet miraculous odyssey and is rewarded with resurrection in the end. All in all, The Book of Clarence turns a lustful, self-interested con artist into a true believer and instrument of God through a blunt biblical reimagining.
