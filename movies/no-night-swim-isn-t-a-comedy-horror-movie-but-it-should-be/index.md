# No, Night Swim Isn t A Comedy Horror Movie (But It Should Be)


## SUMMARY 



  Night Swim is intended to be a chilling supernatural horror flick, but its scares often come across as unintentionally hilarious.   The film, helmed by first-time director Bryce McGuire and produced by Jason Blum and James Wan, explores the haunting origins of a spring-fed pool.   Despite its attempts to tap into primal fears (and its impressive cast), Night Swim falls short of delivering genuine scares — and unintentionally takes on a campy, cult-classic tone.

## Literature Review

Horror film Night Swim is one of 2024&#39;s first theatrical releases. Unfortunately, it&#39;s left viewers wondering if Night Swim is a horror-comedy flick.




One of 2024&#39;s first theatrical releases, Blumhouse&#39;s Night Swim isn&#39;t so much scaring viewers as it is prompting them to ask a truly horrifying question: Is Night Swim supposed to be funny? The short answer is &#34;no&#34; — Night Swim is meant to be a chilling supernatural horror flick, though its alleged scares are pretty lukewarm and unintentionally hilarious. Despite being written and helmed by first-time feature film director Bryce McGuire, Night Swim is based on McGuire and collaborator Rod Blackhurst&#39;s 2014 short film of the same name. Not to mention, it&#39;s produced by both Jason Blum and James Wan under their respective Blumhouse Productions and Atomic Monsters banners.




Released by Universal Pictures, Night Swim also boasts an impressive cast. Wyatt Russell, who&#39;s most well-known for starring in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, returns to the horror genre as Ray Waller, a former pro baseball player who&#39;s forced into an early retirement due to illness. Kerry Condon, the Oscar-nominated Banshees of Inisherin actor, plays Ray&#39;s supportive-yet-concerned wife, Eve. The Wallers and their kids, Izzy and Elliot, move into a new home, complete with a self-sustaining, spring-fed pool. As part of his treatment, Ray spends a lot of time in the water; Ray&#39;s illness goes into remission, but the pool&#39;s true nature surfaces.

                  Night Swim Review: Blumhouse&#39;s Latest Horror Film Delivers Some Pretty Weak, Ineffective Scares   Night Swim has compelling themes and an intriguing family dynamic, but its weakest element is that of its horror, which is severely lacking in bite.   


 Night Swim&#39;s Haunted Pool Concept Is Hard To Take Seriously 
          




In true supernatural horror movie fashion, Night Swim attempts to set up the pool&#39;s haunted origins with a prologue. One night, Rebecca Fuller, a young girl whose family lives in the house the Waller&#39;s end up buying, tries to retrieve her terminally ill brother&#39;s toy from the pool. Suddenly, an unseen something pulls her under. In the present story, the pool&#39;s therapeutic benefits come at a cost. Eve is the first to notice the changes in her husband&#39;s demeanor, though the pool also makes its sinister side known when the Waller kids are attacked by something lurking in its waters. Even the family&#39;s cat can&#39;t catch a break.

                  How Scary Is Night Swim? PG-13 Rating Explained   Night Swim is Blumhouse&#39;s latest, but is it actually scary considering its rating? We explore the reasons behind its rating and if it&#39;s frightening.   



Night Swim has made $19.6 million at the box office against its $15 million budget.







After Ray seemingly forces their kids underwater, Eve takes matters into her own hands and tracks down Rebecca&#39;s mother, Kay (Jodi Long), who explains that the spring-fed pool is a healing spring — one that demands sacrifices. The entity-possessed husband who slowly tries to kill his family isn&#39;t a new formula; Amityville Horror is a prime example of the popular genre narrative. In fact, Night Swim has a lot in common with horror greats, from Poltergeist (1982) to The Conjuring. Unfortunately, there&#39;s just something inherently silly about a sinister swimming pool — and it&#39;s something that even Russell and Condon&#39;s best line deliveries can&#39;t amend. 

                  Blumhouse&#39;s First 2024 Horror Movie Is So Different 1 Year After M3GAN&#39;s $180M Success   It&#39;s been almost one full year since M3GAN was released and became a box office hit, but Blumhouse&#39;s first 2024 horror movie is so different.   



 Night Swim Unintentionally Nails The Cult Classic Comedy Formula 
         




Despite some eerie shots and its earnest attempts to tap into humanity&#39;s almost-primal fear of water at night, Night Swim isn&#39;t very successful at conjuring up scares. Part of the problem is that Night Swim takes itself too seriously. The film&#39;s subject doesn&#39;t help matters; unintentionally funny line deliveries run rampant, especially when the movie&#39;s otherwise-strong actors try to intone their fear of the pool. Nothing suggests Night Swim was going for campy horror, but, likely accidentally, it nails that kind of midnight-movie, cult-classic tone. For viewers looking to wade in, it&#39;s best to approach Night Swim from that should-be camp perspective.
