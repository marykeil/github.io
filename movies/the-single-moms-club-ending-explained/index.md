## Literature Review

The ending of Tyler Perry&#39;s The Single Moms Club conveys important messages about chosen friendships, family, and life as a single mother.




Tyler Perry’s The Single Moms Club is a hilarious comedy with important messages and a heartfelt ending. Five different single moms – Lytia, May, Hillary, Jan, and Esperanza – meet at a parent-teacher conference where the principal of their kids’ private school informs them that their kids will be expelled if they don’t put on a fundraiser dance. As they spend time together, they learn that they have similar experiences despite being of different races, jobs, and socioeconomic statuses. After connecting, they decide to start a support group called “the single moms club.”




They take turns watching each other’s kids so that the other four can go out together and do something fun. This allows them to relax, vent, and take a break from the stresses of being a single mom. This plan helps each of the moms break out of their comfort zone and re-evaluate what’s important in their lives. Unfortunately, a rift splits up the group after one of the kids goes missing while being babysat. This leads to The Single Moms Club’s endearing ending that shows the importance of support and friendship between mothers.



Tyler Perry&#39;s The Single Moms Club is available to stream on Netflix.





 How The Single Moms Club Gets Back Together 
          




Towards the end of Tyler Perry’s The Single Moms Club, the group of friends breaks up because of the fallout from Rick disappearing while under the watch of Hillary. The rest of the group agrees it won’t be the same without May, who refuses to speak to them. At the suggestion of TK, they start leaving incessant messages on May’s answering machine. They say that they miss her and that they won’t stop calling. Unfortunately, this part of the movie conveys the concerning idea that it’s okay to cross someone’s boundaries with good intentions.

When May listens to the messages at the end of The Single Moms Club, she struggles to overcome her embarrassment about how she reacted. With a little encouragement from SK, she decides to go to the fundraiser dance to see her friends. She arrives and apologizes to the group for disappearing. They immediately forgive her and agree to restart the group. This shows that friendships can mend if people put their relationships above conflict or their pride.

 Rick’s Disappearance Explained 
          

While most of the moms are out at the movies with their dates in Tyler Perry’s The Single Moms Club, Hillary is watching the kids. She’s asked to come outside by the neighbor she likes. Initially, she declines because she’s babysitting but decides to go out on the porch with him since the kids are sleeping. When they are about to kiss, her daughter runs outside and tells her that Rick is missing. They expect to find him at home, but he’s not there either. This panic is relatable for any parent whose child has ever snuck out or disappeared for even a short period of time.

When Rick returns the next morning, he confronts May about the fact that she never told him that his dad had a substance use disorder. Rick got a call from his dad asking to see him. When he got to where his dad was staying, his dad asked for money and sold Rick’s possessions to buy more drugs. To add insult to injury, he had to walk all the way home. This left Rick feeling betrayed and unloved. The conversation between May and Rick in The Single Moms Club is possibly the most impactful moment in the whole movie.

Rather than demonizing Rick’s father, she tells him that his father is struggling. She reminds him that his dad is doing the best that he knows how.

Since their group breaks up after she starts the book, it’s assumed the book will never get published. The last moments of the movie reveal that Jan’s new book will be published. While wildly unrealistic in the way the publishing business works, this is a happy ending that May deserves.
