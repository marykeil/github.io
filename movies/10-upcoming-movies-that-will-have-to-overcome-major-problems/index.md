## Literature Review

All of these movies have the potential to achieve historic levels of success. However, they each need to overcome certain major problems first.




Upcoming movies that will have to overcome major problems face a wide variety of challenges. These films typically have to deal with stellar expectations in terms of their box office performance, critical appeal, and overall audience impact. Such potential problems can also be further compounded by crucial players getting canned from already slated projects, or the huge pressure that comes with being the next chapter in an already massively successful franchise. Meanwhile, upcoming movies aimed at starting new cinematic universes face their own problems as well.
From the upcoming movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and DC, to the new Avatar, Mission: Impossible, and Star Wars films, every fresh entry into today&#39;s biggest cinematic franchises face their own respective challenges. However, this was also the case for nearly every certified Hollywood blockbuster in the past. Indeed, overcoming these problems won&#39;t be easy - but the directors, casts, and crews of these upcoming films have everything they need to get past these challenges. The reality is that every new film that goes into production is a huge gamble for everyone involved. However, with great risk comes great reward - especially in the billion-dollar film business.









 








 10  Avengers: The Kang Dynasty (2026) 
Replacing Jonathan Majors as Kang won&#39;t be easy.
        

  Avengers: The Kang Dynasty  


  Release Date    May 1, 2026     Director    Destin Daniel Cretton     Cast    Kathryn Newton , Iman Vellani , Mark Ruffalo , Hailee Steinfield , Anthony Mackie , Benedict Wong , Simu Liu , Benedict Cumberbatch , Dominique Thorne , Xochitl Gomez , Chris Hemsworth , Brie Larson    


Unfortunately, the reason why Jonathan Majors won&#39;t be the MCU&#39;s Kang the Conqueror anymore is due to the actor being convicted of harassment and assault. After Majors stole the show as various Kang variants in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Loki, this presents the huge problem of replacing one of the few actors versatile enough to play the MCU&#39;s next big bad. Alternatively, the MCU could also move on from Kang and focus on a different villain, which could help avoid the negative press attached to the character&#39;s brand. This could result in a title change for Avengers: The Kang Dynasty, or other major shifts in Marvel&#39;s future plans.





 9  Dune: Part Two (2024) 
Completing Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Dune trilogy and Muad&#39;Dib&#39;s story relies on Dune 2&#39;s success.


 







  Dune: Part Two  


  Release Date    March 1, 2024     Director    Denis Villeneuve     Cast    Timothee Chalamet , Zendaya , Florence Pugh , Austin Butler , Rebecca Ferguson    


Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Dune has the potential to become the best and biggest sci-fi franchise of the 21st century. However, this can only happen if Villeneuve can pursue his plans of making a film trilogy, which is hinged on the overall success of Dune: Part Two. As the sequel will adapt the comparatively more exciting second half of Frank Herbert&#39;s iconic novel, Dune: Part Two already seems slated for box office success. At the same time, matching or exceeding Dune&#39;s $402 million box office gross is a tall order for any sequel - and it&#39;s what&#39;s needed for Villeneuve to adapt Dune: Messiah into Dune 3 and finish Muad&#39;Dib&#39;s story.

Denis Villeneuve&#39;s Dune only tells half the story from the original novel by Frank Herbert. The story continues in 2024&#39;s Dune: Part Two










 8  Deadpool 3 (2024) 
Anything short of immense box office success would be disappointing.
        

  Deadpool 3  


  Release Date    July 26, 2024     Director    Shawn Levy     Cast    Ryan Reynolds , Hugh Jackman , Morena Baccarin , Brianna Hildebrand , Jennifer Garner    


The Deadpool movies have an average box office gross of around $780 million. Combined with how the third movie is set to introduce both Ryan Reynolds&#39; Wade/Deadpool and Hugh Jackman&#39;s Logan/Wolverine into the MCU, Deadpool 3 is under immense pressure to achieve blockbuster status. Indeed, with the Marvel Cinematic Universe facing a myriad of problems, Deadpool 3 achieving anything short of stellar commercial success would be a disappointment for both Marvel audiences and executives alike. Thankfully, everything seems to have aligned for Deadpool 3&#39;s success. That being said, whether the third Deadpool movie can meet or exceed such huge expectations can only be answered after the Deadpool 3 release date.





 7  Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024) 
The answer to why Furiosa became Imperator could make or break the movie.


 







  Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga  


  Release Date    May 24, 2024     Director    George Miller     Cast    Yahya Abdul-Mateen II , Chris Hemsworth , Anya Taylor-Joy    


A prequel to Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga faces the challenge of revealing Furiosa&#39;s backstory - particularly how she became Imperator Furiosa and ended up working for Immortan Joe. This presents the problem of Furiosa potentially undermining what&#39;s already been established about the Imperator - the breakout character of Fury Road. Indeed, Furiosa&#39;s answer to how she rose to an elite position of command among the sadistic Immortan Joe&#39;s forces will either make or break the Mad Max prequel. With Anya Taylor-Joy being cast as Furiosa - alongside Chris Hemsworth&#39;s new villain Dementus - Furiosa seems poised to do justice to the beloved character&#39;s origin story.

 6  Beetlejuice 2 (2024) 
What made the original Beetlejuice great wouldn&#39;t sit well in today&#39;s political climate.
        

  Beetlejuice 2  


  Release Date    September 6, 2024     Director    Tim Burton     Cast    Michael Keaton , Jenna Ortega , Winona Ryder , Monica Bellucci , Willem Dafoe , Justin Theroux , Catherine O&#39;Hara    


Beetlejuice is one of the greatest movie characters ever. However, the fact is that much of the character&#39;s popularity is not just due to Michael Keaton&#39;s performance, but also Beetlejuice himself being such a ridiculously evil and chaotic person. In Beetlejuice, he tried to trick 16-year-old Lydia into marrying him so he could roam free in the living world. That was business as usual for movies in the &#39;80s, but such plots won&#39;t fly in today&#39;s political climate. Changing this approach, which is a big part of why Beetlejuice remains popular, is a big risk which could either usher the character into the 21st century or ruin his legacy.





 5  Gladiator 2 (2024) 
Most audiences are unattached to or unfamiliar with the original Gladiator story.
        

  Gladiator 2  


  Release Date    November 22, 2024     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Paul Mescal , Denzel Washington , Connie Nielsen , Derek Jacobi , Djimon Hounsou , Joseph Quinn , Fred Hechinger , Pedro Pascal    


Neither Russel Crowe&#39;s Maximus nor Joaquin Phoenix&#39;s Commodus will return for Ridley Scott&#39;s Gladiator 2, which is about the life of Commodus&#39; nephew Lucius 20 years after Gladiator. Played by Stephen Treat Clark in the first movie, Lucius could&#39;ve become emperor after Commodus&#39; death, but instead, he swore to carry on Maximus&#39; legacy. Gladiator was one of the most epic period dramas from 2000 - but audiences today can scarcely remember what happened in the original film. Indeed, it&#39;s promising how both the Oscar-nominated Paul Mescal and Denzel Washington are attached to Gladiator 2 - but this doesn&#39;t change the fact that most viewers are unattached to the first Gladiator.





 4  Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two (2025) 
Dead Reckoning Part One was a box office failure.
        

  Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part Two  


  Release Date    May 23, 2025     Director    Christopher McQuarrie     Cast    Tom Cruise , Pom Klementieff , Rebecca Ferguson , Vanessa Kirby , Hayley Atwell , Hannah Waddingham ,  Simon Pegg    


Even at a worldwide box office gross of $567.5 million, Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One failed because it had a budget of $291 million, the biggest production cost of any Mission: Impossible film to date. Moreover, apart from being the first Mission: Impossible sequel to fail at the box office, Dead Reckoning Part One also represents an over $200 million dip in the franchise&#39;s consecutive ticket sales. Unfortunately, everything points to how the Mission: Impossible franchise is potentially losing steam. Curiously, however, Dead Reckoning Part Two - or Mission: Impossible 8 - isn&#39;t even slated to be the last film in the franchise.

The Mission: Impossible 8 release date is set for 2025, and there&#39;s intense speculation on what&#39;s next for Ethan Hunt after Dead Reckoning Part One.








 3  Star Wars: New Jedi Order (2026/2027) 
Star Wars sequels have a history of being very divisive.
        

  Star Wars: New Jedi Order  


  Director    Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy     Cast    Daisy Ridley    


Every other upcoming Star Wars movie must deal with the franchise&#39;s history of releasing highly divisive sequels. This is especially true for Star Wars: New Jedi Order, which is focused on the journey of Daisy Ridley&#39;s Rey - one of the franchise&#39;s most divisive characters. While New Jedi Order will be set 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker and focused on Rey rebuilding the Jedi Order, these promising plot points are no guarantee that the upcoming sequels won&#39;t be just as divisive as the last. On the other hand, if the sequel can overcome this problem, New Jedi Order could also redeem Star Wars&#39; cinematic legacy.





 2  Avatar 3 (2025) 
Retreading familiar ground could jeopardize the Avatar franchise&#39;s staying power.


 







  Avatar 3  


  Release Date    December 19, 2025     Director    James Cameron     Cast    Zoe Saldana , Sigourney Weaver , Sam Worthington , Stephen Lang    


Avatar 3, also known as Avatar: The Seed Bearer, could face the same criticism thrown at Avatar: The Way of Water - how the sequel was a massive rehash of the first movie&#39;s key elements. With its overarching themes of environmentalism, transhumanism, and war, Avatar 3 runs the risk of retreading familiar and already heavily-trodden ground, which could eventually turn off audiences from the franchise. On one hand, after Cameron dealt with worldbuilding in the first two movies, Avatar 3 could easily stand apart. On the other hand, with 2 more movies down the line after Avatar 3, it will be difficult not to repeat anything from the previous films.





 1  Superman: Legacy (2025) 
Everything about David Corenswet&#39;s new Superman will be under heavy scrutiny.
        

  Superman: Legacy  


  Release Date    July 11, 2025     Director    James Gunn     Cast    David Corenswet , Rachel Brosnahan , María Gabriela De Faría    


Slated to be the first feature film in James Gunn&#39;s new DC cinematic continuity, Superman: Legacy is already facing great pressure, with every revealed and rumored creative decision already receiving scrutiny from audiences. This isn&#39;t surprising to anyone who has followed DC movies over the years. Apart from Gunn being responsible for rebooting the entire DC cinematic universe, new actor David Corenswet will be stepping into the shoes of Superman in the wake of arguably the greatest actor to have ever been cast in the role - Henry Cavill. For now, it remains to be seen whether Gunn and Corenswet can impress viewers in the shadow of Cavill&#39;s enduring legacy.
