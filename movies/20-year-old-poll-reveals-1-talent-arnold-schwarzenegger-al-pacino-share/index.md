## Literature Review



From the vast lexicon of Hollywood&#39;s illustrious history, few names evoke as strong a resonance as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Al Pacino, and while they&#39;re completely different actors, they have something very specific in common: the ability to perfectly play both heroes and villains. Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilding champion turned silver screen sensation, became the cornerstone of action epics, his distinct Austrian timbre punctuating cinema&#39;s most iconic lines. Pacino, with a fierce immersion in his roles, has been the bedrock of dramas, delving deep into the human psyche. Their cinematic realms may seem worlds apart, yet a unique confluence emerges in their ability to etch both heroes and villains with profundity.




In 2003, the American Film Institute (AFI) launched its &#34;100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains&#34; list, which recognized the best movie heroes and movie villains of all time. These characters have either made audiences fervently root for them, loathe them with a passion, or both. The list was a culmination of opinions polled from over 1,500 industry leaders, aiming to honor characters that stood out between 1903 and 2003. While the characters on the list are undoubtedly popular, the poll wasn&#39;t simply a popularity contest, but it was also about the depth, complexity, and lasting impact the characters had on audiences, and both Pacino and Schwarzenegger appear twice.

 Schwarzenegger &amp; Pacino Have Played Iconic Heroes &amp; Villains 
          




Al Pacino&#39;s Michael Corleone in The Godfather Part II is a masterclass in character progression. The scene where he confronts his brother, Fredo — his eyes cold, voice chillingly calm, noting, &#34;You broke my heart&#34; — is the dialogue of a true villain. This moment crystallizes Michael&#39;s transformation, his moral compromise evident, which contrasts with his earlier reticence in the series. Meanwhile, Pacino&#39;s role as Detective Frank Serpico, epitomized in scenes where he stands isolated amid corrupt comrades, showcases the actor&#39;s knack for heroism. In Serpico, Pacino portrayed the anguish of integrity in a rotting system. As a result, both characters were recognized on the AFI&#39;s heroes and villains lists.

Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s T-800 set a precedent in action cinema. While the relentless pursuit scenes from the first Terminator movie — the T-800 emotionless as he mows down anyone in its path — show its malevolent programming, the second movie elevated its complexity. Watching Terminator 2: Judgment Day, it&#39;s impossible to not become invested in the character when it states with a stoic expression, &#34;I know now why you cry,&#34; signaling its growing understanding of humanity. This evolution challenged not only the boundaries of action cinema but also questioned the very essence of what it means to be human, cementing the T-800 as both a villain and a hero.






 Schwarzenegger Made Both Lists By Playing The Same Character 
          

The dual nature of Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s T-800 is an ode to his adaptability as an actor. Introduced as an unyielding assassin in the first Terminator movie — exemplified in the police station massacre — the character undergoes a metamorphosis in the sequel. The T-800&#39;s protection of John Connor, displayed in the Terminator 2: Judgment Day ending when he sacrifices himself, delineates its transition from an emotionless machine to a self-aware entity. As a result, the actor achieved something unprecedented, as the T-800 is on both the heroes and villains list. The T-800 is on the AFI villains list for The Terminator, and the heroes list for Terminator 2: Judgment Day.


 




Contrasting this with Al Pacino&#39;s Michael Corleone offers a narrative dichotomy. In The Godfather, Michael is less of a villain and more of a war hero who&#39;s conflicted and wants to avenge his father&#39;s death, all before becoming corrupted by power. While Corleone&#39;s chilling moment with his brother Fredo in Cuba exemplifies his transition to a remorseless figure in The Godfather Part II, Schwarzenegger&#39;s T-800 moves from an object of fear to one of empathy and sacrifice. Al Pacino, armed with his unparalleled prowess, seamlessly traverses the spectrum from a tragic hero in The Godfather to a villain in The Godfather Part II. Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s T-800 does the complete opposite.
