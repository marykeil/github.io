## Literature Review

The sequel to the popular 2015 Pixar animated film Inside Out will premiere in 2024, and the upcoming movie contains many exciting developments.




Inside Out 2, one of Pixar&#39;s most highly anticipated sequels, will finally premiere nine years following the release of the first movie, and future viewers and fans of the first installment have plenty to be excited about. The upcoming 2024 animated coming-of-age film, directed by Kelsey Mann and written by Meg LeFauve, will jump ahead one year following the events of Inside Out. Riley will enter her puberty years in the movie, meaning that Joy and the rest of the original gang from the first film will have a wide range of new emotions to contend with.
The Inside Out 2 trailer teases one of Riley&#39;s new emotions, who shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise, given that she is becoming a teenager. However, not much is known about the other new characters, seeing as Pixar remains tight-lipped regarding plenty of the plot elements in the sequel. However, we know that Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, and Lewis Black are reprising their roles as Joy, Sadness, and Anger. The rest of the cast has either been undisclosed or new players who did not voice characters in Inside Out in 2015. Nevertheless, the animated movie&#39;s premise is intriguing, and given the quality of the first film, Inside Out 2 contains many compelling developments and should be worth the wait.









 








 10  Maya Hawke Voices Anxiety 
        

Anxiety being chosen as one of the new emotions in Inside Out 2 is an exciting factor all on its own, given that Pixar and Disney are willing to explore uncomfortable topics and make them easier to discuss openly. But the fact that Maya Hawke is voicing the character makes this development even more enticing. Hawke, best known for playing Robin Buckley in Stranger Things, is the perfect casting choice to play Anxiety in the upcoming sequel. Based on the teaser trailer, which featured a glimpse at Hawke&#39;s character, it seems like Anxiety will play a significant role in the movie.

Inside Out 2 will add new emotions to Riley’s mind. Carroll Izard’s work may reveal the seven most likely new emotions to join the Pixar sequel cast.








 9  The Sequel Introduces 3 More New Emotions 
        

Even though they were not seen in the Inside Out 2 teaser trailer, more new emotions besides Anxiety have been teased. So far, Pixar has revealed that three other characters will join Anxiety as the newbies at headquarters in the sequel, including Embarrassment, Ennui, and Envy. Unfortunately, the actors voicing these emotions are unknown, but the names of the new characters are interesting, given that Riley is starting puberty in the 2024 animated picture.





 8  Different Actors Voice 2 Significant Characters From Inside Out 
        

Mindy Kaling and Bill Hader voiced Disgust and Fear in Inside Out, but their parts were recast for the sequel. Liza Lapira and Tony Hale join the cast and take over for Kaling and Hader as Disgust and Fear. According to IGN, Kaling and Hader declined the opportunity to reprise their roles because of a pay dispute between the actors and Pixar. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see what Lapira and Hale do with the characters and if they put their spin on Disgust and Fear. Hale previously voiced Forky in Toy Story 4, so playing Fear is right up his alley.





 7  The Return Of Sadness &amp; Joy&#39;s Complex Dynamic 


 







One of the best parts of Inside Out was the complicated relationship between Joy and Sadness and how it developed over the course of the film. At their core, they were opposites, but Joy eventually learned that Sadness was a necessary emotion to help Riley grow, especially as a preteen. By the end of the 2015 movie, Joy and Sadness were on good terms and were actively working together to help Riley. So, the sequel will undoubtedly revisit their complex dynamic since they were the central duo in the first installment.





 6  Riley Is Turning 13 


 







For most of Inside Out, Riley is 11 and in a new city with no friends or familiarity. The pressure of change and trying to adapt to her new normal was overwhelming, which led to Sadness overpowering Joy. By the film&#39;s end, Riley finally opens up to her parents (once Joy hands over control to Sadness), leading to progress and a chance to properly process her emotions. She turns 12 near the movie&#39;s conclusion, and when the sequel begins, it will be one year later, with Riley turning 13. Thirteen is a trying time for anyone, and becoming a teenager and entering puberty will undoubtedly be a central theme in Inside Out 2.

 5  Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, &amp; Disgust&#39;s Reactions To The New Emotions 
        

Joy developed tremendously in Inside Out, as she learned to let Riley feel sad, angry, afraid, and disgusted instead of just focusing on her being happy all the time. However, perhaps Joy will revert to her old ways once the new emotions arrive at headquarters in the sequel. It will undoubtedly be stressful for all the characters, including Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger, as they adjust to sharing Riley in Inside Out 2.





 4  The Possibility Of Additional Unannounced Emotions 
        

So far, Pixar has disclosed four new emotions entering the picture in Inside Out 2 — Anxiety, Envy, Ennui, and Embarrassment. However, the film studio may have more tricks up its sleeve that they are waiting to reveal when the sequel begins its theatrical run. It is possible that, aside from the four new characters, the 2023 animated film will introduce more emotions. Turning 13 years old brings on a wave of new feelings for everyone, and Riley won&#39;t be any different.
























 3  An Update On Riley &amp; Jordan 
        

At the end of Inside Out, Riley bumps into a boy named Jordan during one of her hockey games, and he is clearly flustered by her. Jordan returns in the Pixar short Riley&#39;s First Date, which depicts him and Riley (maybe) going on a skating date. However, the story mainly focuses on Riley&#39;s parents and their emotions as they react to the possibility of their daughter going on her first date. Pixar hasn&#39;t confirmed whether Jordan will appear in the sequel, but the upcoming movie should provide viewers with an update on his relationship with Riley.





 2  Inside Out 2 Is Pixar&#39;s Second Chance At Tackling Puberty 
        

Inside Out 2 will not be the first time Pixar has addressed the subject of puberty in one of their films — puberty was also at the center of the story in Turning Red. However, while Turning Red received positive reviews and a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 95th Academy Awards, the 2022 movie had a limited theatrical release, and it was simultaneously added to Disney&#43;&#39;s streaming library (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The film didn&#39;t bring in much revenue for Pixar, so the Inside Out sequel will be its second chance at tackling puberty, and perhaps it will do a better job than Turning Red.

 1  Returning To One Of Pixar&#39;s Best Films 


 







Inside Out surprisingly became one of Pixar&#39;s best movies following its release in 2015, and it&#39;s exciting that the film studio is returning to its compelling characters, intriguing storylines, and perfect balance of humor and heartfelt emotions. Hopefully, the upcoming sequel will not be a carbon copy of its predecessor but will bring something refreshing to the established story. Only time will tell if Inside Out 2 lives up to the hype that has been building for nine years.
Inside Out 2 premieres in theaters on June 14, 2024.
