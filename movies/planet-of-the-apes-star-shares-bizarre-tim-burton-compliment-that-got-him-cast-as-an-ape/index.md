# Planet Of The Apes Star Shares Bizarre Tim Burton Compliment That Got Him Cast As An Ape


## SUMMARY 



  Paul Giamatti&#39;s role in Planet of the Apes came about when Tim Burton said he looked like a monkey, resulting in an offer to be in the film.   Giamatti insisted on playing an ape despite his agents suggesting he play a human, so his face could be seen.   The Burton-directed Planet of the Apes film received mixed reviews and was criticized for its depiction of the ape characters.

## Literature Review

One Planet of the Apes (2001) actor shares the strange compliment from director Tim Burton that wound up with him getting cast as an ape.




Planet of the Apes star Paul Giamatti reveals the Tim Burton compliment that landed him a role in the film. Released in 2001, Planet of the Apes is a Burton-directed entry into the franchise that sees an Air Force astronaut who lands on a foreign planet where apes are the dominant force against a race of more primitive humans. In addition to Giamatti, the film stars Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Estella Warren.




Speaking with GQ, Giamatti recounts the odd compliment that led him to receive his role in Planet of the Apes.


 

While Giamatti “didn’t audition,” for the role, Burton approached the actor to say that he “look[ed] like a monkey,” so he wanted to give him a part in the film. While Giamatti’s agents expressed trepidation towards his role, the actor was insistent that he “want[ed] to play an ape.”


The notion that I could be in one of those [movies] was mind-blowing to me. I didn&#39;t audition for that. Tim Burton came to me with that, because I guess he was like, &#39;You look like a monkey, so I&#39;ll have you do this.&#39; It was one of the funnest things I&#39;ve ever done. I was covered head to toe, shoulders in a fat suit, and my feet, and my agents were like, &#39;Don&#39;t you think you should play a human, so they can see your face?&#39; And I was like, &#39;If you tell them I want to play a human in this, I will kill you all. I want to play an ape!&#39;





The Planet of the Apes Films’ Evolution Explained
         

While it has gained somewhat of a cult following over the years, Planet of the Apes was widely panned at the time of its release. The film currently holds a 44% Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes, with an even lower audience score of 27%. Giamatti and the other ape characters were seen as goofier in this version, which was released before the advent of more sophisticated CGI and motion capture technology for the apes.

                  Every Single Planet Of The Apes Movie (In Chronological Order)   The Planet of the Apes timeline is a bit confusing, so we arranged them in their proper chronological order   

The 2010s Planet of the Apes trilogy took a vastly different approach from Burton’s version, setting the films on Earth in a plot that originated from a corrupt laboratory experiment in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Through this choice, the Planet of the Apes trilogy felt a lot more grounded in displaying power dynamics that borrowed from human nature rather than a sci-fi recasting of society. This potency is especially visible in War for the Planet of the Apes, which takes the ape-versus-human battle to a larger scale in an epic film.




Now, the Planet of the Apes universe will expand further as the series continues for Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes. Set just over three centuries after the end of War for the Planet of the Apes, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes casts a new set of ape characters as they reform society years after Caesar has passed. Like the 2010s trilogy, this film will differ from the choices of Burton&#39;s Planet of the Apes significantly. Hopefully, they will do so successfully as Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes prepares for release on May 24, 2024.
