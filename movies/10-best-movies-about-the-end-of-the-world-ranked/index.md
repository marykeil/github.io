As Viggo Mortensen and Kodi Smit-McPhee traverse the stark post-disaster landscape in search of hope, the film grapples with weighty themes of morality and sacrifice in times of desperation.

 3  Melancholia (2011) 
An intense exploration of sadness and anxiety
        

With melancholy beauty, Lars von Trier confronts mortality through an intimate portrait of two sisters facing an extinction event. As a rogue planet hurtles toward Earth, Melancholia explores the dichotomy between Kirsten Dunst’s clinically depressed Justine and Charlotte Gainsbourg’s anxious Claire. Justine embraces doom with almost tranquil apathy, finding solace staring at the sky rather than hunkering in a bunker. Meanwhile, Claire unravels, trying to hold onto normalcy even as the planet literally crumbles beneath her feet. This haunting parable ponders inner peace in the face of oblivion, suggesting that everyone meets the end differently; some with denial or panic, others with quiet acceptance.

As society resorts to bombing farms and humanity loses hope for survival, a team of astronauts embarks on a daring interstellar mission through a recently-discovered wormhole to find a new home planet. Both an immersive space thriller and meditation on the human drive to endure, Interstellar merges spectacle with intimacy. As the astronauts traverse distant worlds and the story tackles quantum physics, above all, it spotlights the emotional resilience that emanates from the ties between parent and child even light years apart.
