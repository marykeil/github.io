## Literature Review

May December&#39;s real-life inspiration for Charles Melton&#39;s Joe, Vili Fualaau, bluntly responds to the new Netflix film based on his story.




May December&#39;s real-life inspiration for Joe bluntly responds to the movie. In the Netflix film, Joe (Charles Melton) is a man who, as a boy, was involved in a notorious tabloid romance with an adult woman, Gracie (Julianne Moore). Twenty years later, the two are married, and when an actress, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), arrives to research for her role as Gracie in a film about their past, their marriage begins to buckle under the pressure. May December is an awards season favorite, with each of its three stars receiving Golden Globe nominations.




Talking to The Hollywood Reporter, May December&#39;s real-life inspiration for Joe, Vili Fualaau, bluntly responded to the movie using his story. He has seen the film and is profoundly disheartened by what he considers to be an exploitation of his story and trauma, though his primary source of bewilderment stems from the fact that director Todd Haynes, screenwriter Samy Burch, or Melton never consulted him about a character clearly based on his life. Read Fualaau&#39;s full comments below:


I’m still alive and well. If they had reached out to me, we could have worked together on a masterpiece. Instead, they chose to do a ripoff of my original story. I’m offended by the entire project and the lack of respect given to me — who lived through a real story and is still living it. I love movies — good movies. And I admire ones that capture the essence and complications of real-life events. You know, movies that allow you to see or realize something new every time you watch them. Those kinds of writers and directors — someone who can do that — would be perfect to work with, because my story is not nearly as simple as this movie [portrays].

 May December&#39;s Real-Life Inspiration Explained 
          

May December is loosely inspired by the Mary Kay Letourneau scandal, which screenwriter Samy Burch has been open about. Letourneau was a schoolteacher who gained notoriety for her sexual relationship with her 6th-grade student, Fualaau, during the 1990s. Letourneau later pleaded guilty to child rape and served a prison sentence, but after her release, she and Fualaau married, and their relationship continued to face scrutiny. The scandal sparked nationwide media coverage. The couple separated in 2019, and Letourneau passed away from cancer in 2020, with Fualaau at her bedside.




The similarities between May December and the Mary Kay Letourneau scandal are striking. In the movie, Joe is 13 when Gracie, 36 years old, initiates an illicit sexual relationship, while Fualaau was 12 and Letourneau was 34. Furthermore, both men married their female abusers after the woman served time in prison for their crimes. A pivotal May December scene even incorporates the dialogue, &#34;Who was the boss?&#34; taken directly from an interview with Letourneau and Fualaau. The character of Joe is clearly based on Fualaau, so it is curious why no one reached out to consult him.



May December is streaming on Netflix.
