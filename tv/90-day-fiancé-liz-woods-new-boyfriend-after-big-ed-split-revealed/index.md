Meanwhile, someone mentioned, “She’s still married though” referring to rumors of Big Ed and Liz’s wedding in August 2023. A now-deleted wedding website had confirmed that the couple had tied the knot in front of their close friends and family during a wedding ceremony and reception held on August 29, 2023, in Bentonville, Arkansas. Big Ed and Liz had moved from San Diego to Arkansas after filming 90 Day: The Last Resort which had surprisingly ended on a happy note for them. They reportedly had bought a house together, but while Big Ed is now working as a realtor in Arkansas, Liz has been spending time in San Diego.

Liz started posting about her new man around November 2023. Liz made sure to never show the man’s face in the photos from her date nights, but his body did not look like it belonged to Big Ed. Considering Big Ed and Liz may have gotten married, their breaking up after the wedding may have been due to a major reason that is yet to be revealed. Big Ed has sparked speculation that they filmed for 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 8 which premieres in March 2024.




Fans have noticed how Liz is looking different now from how she looked when she was with Big Ed. Liz not only seems happier but also healthier as she seems to have lost weight. 90 Day: The Single Life viewers were always disapproving of her relationship with Big Ed. The pairing was toxic and making one wrong decision after another on camera as they struggled to see the problems they had between them. Liz leaving Big Ed was just a rumor until she began flaunting her new boyfriend on Instagram. With his face now being revealed, it’s safe to assume that Big Ed and Liz have indeed gone their separate ways.
