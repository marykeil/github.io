# 1 Small Bridgerton Detail Makes No Sense After Anthony s Backstory


## SUMMARY 



Bridgerton is a popular show known for its love stories, lavish costumes, and emotional moments.   
The inclusion of bees as a motif in the show may seem strange, but it represents feminist undertones and women in positions of power.   
Despite the meaning, it would make more sense if the children of Edmund did not wear bees on their clothing.

## Literature Review
Despite Bridgerton&#39;s superior storytelling skills, it continues to include one small detail that makes no sense given what was learned about Anthony.




Bridgerton&#39;s repeated inclusion of one small detail seems absurd after viewers learn of Anthony&#39;s backstory. Based on a series of books by the same name, Bridgerton has been one of Netflix&#39;s greatest hits. The show follows the stories of the eight Bridgerton siblings who are all on the hunt for love during the social season, while also trying to navigate the complications of life in Regency-era England. Given the show&#39;s immense popularity, it is no surprise that Bridgerton has been renewed for a third season and that it is highly anticipated by viewers.




At its core, Bridgerton is a love story through and through. Not only do each of the characters embark on their own romantic journeys, but the love the family has for one another is palpable. Along with all of the love, the show is marked by its lavish and opulent costumes, witty banter, and emotional moments that culminate into a memorable show that takes audiences on a wild ride. The one thing that doesn&#39;t make sense about Bridgerton is why it continues to include a certain reference in each of its seasons.

How Old All 8 Bridgerton Siblings Are In Seasons 1 &amp; 2   The Bridgerton family has a large number of siblings that vary in ages from Anthony to Hyacinth. Here&#39;s an explanation of how old all 8 siblings are.    


 Benedict Wearing A Bee Waistcoat In Bridgerton Season 2 Is Really Morbid 
Given that it was revealed through Anthony&#39;s backstory in season 2 of Bridgerton that the family&#39;s patriarch, Edmund, died after being stung by a bee, it is very morbid that one of his sons is seen wearing a bee waistcoat. It would make more sense for bees to be something that the Bridgerton family actively avoided, rather than something they find ways to incorporate into their daily lives. Though Benedict wearing a bee waistcoat seems incredibly strange, there is actually symbolism behind it that makes it more understandable.



Bridgerton&#39;s Bee Motif Explained 
          

Bees are a recurring theme throughout Bridgerton, with them appearing in major moments throughout the show. For example, a bee is seen in season one when it lands on Daphne and Simon&#39;s carriage as they head for their honeymoon. It is then seen again when Daphne is giving birth to her first child with Simon. Not only does it connect to Edmund, but the bee can also be seen as a symbol of the feminist undertones throughout the show.

Even though Bridgerton is based in a Regency Era of a very patriarchal society, Bridgerton has always displayed women in positions of power, which is represented through the bees. These women are also unapologetic in how they fight against social norms. A &#34;Queen Bee&#34; refers to a woman who establishes herself in a place of power in societal circles, and the women of Bridgerton do just that. Though this meaning doesn&#39;t really make Benedict&#39;s wearing of a bee waistcoat more logical, it explains why Bridgerton chooses to keep the bees around.
