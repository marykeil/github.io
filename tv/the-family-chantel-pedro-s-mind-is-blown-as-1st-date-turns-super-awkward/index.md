## Literature Review
The Family Chantel star Pedro Jimeno&#39;s first date after his divorce from Chantel Everett does not go well amid Chantel wanting to date Drake.




The Family Chantel star Pedro Jimeno&#39;s first date after getting divorced from Chantel Everett is turning into a major disaster. Pedro, who&#39;s from the Dominican Republic, made his franchise debut alongside Chantel during 90 Day Fiance season 4. Pedro was deeply in love with Chantel at the time. They got married but faced difficulties in their relationship once they were cast in their spin-off The Family Chantel. After four seasons of drama, quarrels, and family fights, Pedro decided to divorce Chantel in May 2022. Pedro and Chantel returned to the show, despite the split. It is the final chapter of their story together where Pedro and Chantel are documenting life after divorce.




A clip shared by People from the next episode of The Family Chantel season 5 reveals Pedro is ready to move on from Chantel. The real estate agent admits he&#39;s been seeing someone new. However, Pedro has yet to meet the person in real life. It&#39;s his first date ever since he divorced Chantel. Pedro is shown waiting for his date Nallely with a bouquet of pink roses. When Nallely walks in, he does a double take. Nallely looks exactly like Chantel and could be passed off as her twin. &#34;The first moment that Nallely walked into the room, I saw Chantel in her face, like no. Are you kidding me?&#34; Pedro says during his confessional.

 Pedro Jimeno Reacts To Rumors That Chantel Is Dating Drake 
          




Side by side photos of Chantel and Nallely are then shown to viewers. &#34;Are you kidding me?&#34; asks Pedro. He gasps at how similar Chantel and Nallely look. &#34;That looks the same like Chantel,&#34; laughs Pedro. He points out the only different between his ex-wife and possible new girlfriend is that Nallely is &#34;more skinny&#34; and a little bit taller. &#34;That **** is crazy,&#34; he adds. Meanwhile, the producers ask Pedro if he knows about Chantel dating anyone new after the divorce. Pedro says that he heard a rumor about Drake sliding into Chantel&#39;s DMs and mocks her. It&#39;s almost as if he is giving Chantel a dare to date Drake.


 

Chantel is trying to keep anything that allegedly happened between her and Drake private. She thinks Drake is hot. However, she&#39;s not ready yet to address the rumors about the two of them. Chantel admits she had an interaction with a celebrity in her messages, but she doesn&#39;t want to reveal who it was just yet. Chantel has teased that fans might find out the answer to the question if they continue watching The Family Chantel.




Pedro grew distant from Chantel once he started to focus on his work life. Chantel finally realized that her marriage was ending when she feared Pedro was having an affair with a co-worker. Now his former in-laws want to get Pedro deported from the U.S. Pedro, meanwhile, has been sharing thirst traps online and shows off his fancy lifestyle on social media, perhaps with the intention of wooing potential partners. Pedro is surely living his American dream regardless of the criticism he&#39;s received. It hasn&#39;t been confirmed if Pedro continued to date Nallely. However, her close resemblance to Chantel may have urged him not to meet her again.



The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
