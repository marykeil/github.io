  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Fuller House may have staged a beautiful send-off for the Tanner extended family, but it leaves several questions that may never ber answered.</p>
<p>The Fuller House series finale ended on a high note, but it left several questions that may never be answered. Netflix&rsquo;s sequel to Full House came to an end as the Tanner-Fuller family closed its doors once again after five seasons. The Fuller House season 5 finale saw DJ Tanner-Fuller, Stephanie, and Kimmy Gibbler start their new lives together after they got married to the respective love of their lives. Its final episode was full of cameos, making the triple wedding at the famed San Francisco home much more special.
Despite its well-crafted send-off, it&rsquo;s no secret that Netflix pulled the plug on Fuller House earlier than expected. While the cast was thankful for the five seasons that they were able to return, they were also vocal about saving some plot lines for the potential season 6, fully convinced that the streamer would give them at least one more year. That being said, that wasn&rsquo;t the case as Fuller House was canceled with season 5 being split into two parts.

<p>10  How Did Stephanie Get Pregnant?</p>
<p>The Fuller House series finale saw the triple wedding of DJ, Stephanie, and Kimmy to Steve, Jimmy, and Fernando, respectively. The festivities gave the Tanners something to celebrate and a reason to gather, with the event also functioning as a reunion for the clan&rsquo;s relatives and friends. The next morning, it was revealed that Stephanie was pregnant, which was good news. However, it raised questions about how this was possible, considering that she was previously deemed physically incapable of doing so. It was the reason why Kimmy offered to be her surrogate.</p>
<p>9  How Does The Extended Tanner Family Fit In Their Home?</p>
<p>Fuller House&rsquo;s wedding was a bittersweet moment for the She-Wolf Pack as Stephanie and Kimmy decided to move out of the Tanner family home after they all got married. Kimmy and Fernando were supposed to relocate to Palo Alto, while Jimmy and Stephanie wanted to move closer to the original location of Uncle Monty&rsquo;s to keep an eye on that branch. The farewells the next morning were emotional, but Kimmy and Stephanie walked back on their plan at the last minute, meaning they continued to live all together under one roof. Granted that the San Francisco home was massive, it&rsquo;s curious how exactly that many people will fit in the house.</p>
<p>8  Will DJ and Steve Have More Kids</p>
<p>DJ reconnecting with his first love, Steve was one of the most emotional moments in Fuller House. Had the pair not ended up together, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine the backlash that the show would have gotten. While it was clear that they were meant to be with each other, their plans beyond the wedding were unclear, including whether they planned on having their own kids. For context, DJ already had three from her previous marriage, but Steve didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>7  What Happened To Nicky and Alex?</p>
<p>Debuting in Full House season 5, Nicky and Alex&rsquo;s introduction came at a point where Michelle was old enough to become a big sister figure to her cousins. Jesse and Becky&rsquo;s sons returned in Fuller House, but instead of the bright boys that they were, they were portrayed as dense and lazy. Like their mother, they weren&rsquo;t in attendance during the finale&rsquo;s triple wedding, although Jesse was there. The Netflix series didn&rsquo;t give any explanation for their absence.

<p>6  What Was Becky Doing In Nebraska?</p>
<p>Fan-favorite character Aunt Becky didn&rsquo;t return in Fuller House season 5 despite being an integral player in the early years of the spin-off. Her absence was due to Lori Loughlin&rsquo;s involvement in the college admissions bribery case, causing Netflix to fire her. The show came up with the explanation that she went back to Nebraska for some undisclosed reason and was never revisited again. Considering how important that triple wedding in the Fuller House finale was, however, it&rsquo;s curious what she was doing back home that he couldn&rsquo;t attend the celebration.</p>
<p>5  Why Didn’t Michelle Ever Come Home?</p>
<p>Michelle, the younger Tanner sister never made any appearance in Fuller House after Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen refused to reprise their Full House role. For context, the twins have long moved on from acting and have opted to keep a low profile despite being massive fashion moguls. Throughout the spin-off sequel&rsquo;s run, there were references to the character, revealing that is now based in New York. That being said, it&rsquo;s still odd that Michelle never once came back home — not when DJ lost her husband, not when Danny suffered a mid-life crisis, and not even when both of her sisters got married at the same time.</p>
<p>4  Will Vicky and Danny Get Back Together?</p>
<p>When Fuller House started, Danny was married to Teri. Not much was revealed about the character, and she only made an appearance once. Eventually, they got secretly divorced by season 3, although the reason was unclear. Eventually, Fuller House brought back Danny&rsquo;s ex-fiancee, Vicky Larson, who also attended the triple wedding. The former lovers seemed like they still had feelings for each other, but the Full House spin-off left their fate in limbo.</p>
<p>3  Where Were Kimmy and Jimmy&rsquo;s Parents?</p>
<p>As Kimmy became an honorary Tanner daughter and Jimmy started dating Stephanie, there was an increased focus on the siblings. This included the prospect of introducing their never-before-seen parents. The Gibblers were excited at the prospect of having Mr. and Mrs. Gibbler in town since their parents hadn&rsquo;t returned home for two decades. Unfortunately, things fell apart and the couple never made an appearance. There was no proper explanation for why they didn&rsquo;t attend their kids&rsquo; wedding in the Fuller House finale, which makes the Gibblers&rsquo; family dynamic so much weirder.

<p>2  What Would Have Happened In Fuller House Season 6?</p>
<p>The cast of Fuller House was expecting another season order from Netflix, ending the show with six seasons instead of five. Convinced that they still had time, the spin-off saved some storylines for what would have been its final year, including an increased focus on Stephanie&rsquo;s firstborn, Danielle, who was almost non-existent in the show after being born. She didn&rsquo;t even play a part in her parents&rsquo; wedding. Aside from that, Stephanie&rsquo;s first pregnancy was also supposed to be at the center of its storytelling. Whether these plans would have been followed remains unclear.</p>
<p>1  Where Was Baby Dani In The Fuller House Finale?</p>
<p>Fuller House already missed the opportunity to capitalize on its young cast, especially Tommy - DJ&rsquo;s youngest son who was around the same age the Olsens were when they began playing Michelle in Full House. Instead, the focus was mainly on the adult characters as they dealt with their personal issues. However, at least Tommy was incorporated into many scenes. Stephanie and Jimmy&rsquo;s first daughter was essentially forgotten once she was born. While the whole family celebrated the triple wedding. Dani was nowhere to be seen, raising questions about her whereabouts.</p>
