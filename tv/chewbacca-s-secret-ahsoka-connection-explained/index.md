## Literature Review
Chewbacca has a secret Clone Wars connection to Ahsoka Tano, and he knew about the Jedi for years before A New Hope.




Han Solo&#39;s best friend Chewbacca has an often-forgotten Star Wars connection to Ahsoka Tano. The Wookiee Chewbacca is one of the greatest heroes of the Rebel Alliance, participating in so many key battles in galactic history. However, his connection to the Jedi goes far deeper than some realize. After all, Chewbacca had many adventures before meeting Han Solo.




Chewbacca was 200 year old when he appeared in the first Star Wars movie, and he was relatively young by Wookiee standards. What&#39;s more, he&#39;d often been offworld, meaning he&#39;d crossed paths with many other cultures and civilizations; this is why he didn&#39;t cameo in Jedi: Survivor, because he was offworld when Cal Kestis visited the planet. For all that&#39;s the case, though, Chewbacca did ineed have more Jedi connections that most viewers wouldn&#39;t be aware of.

 Ahsoka &amp; Chewbacca Teamed Up Against Trandoshans During The Clone Wars 
          

In Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 3, episode 22 (appropriately titled &#34;Wookiee Hunt&#34;), Chewbacca is taken captive by a group of Trandoshans - the reptilian nemeses of the Wookiees, who love hunting them for sport. The younger Chewbacca is dropped off an unfamiliar planet to be hunted down. At the beginning of the episode, a young, teenage-looking Chewbacca is dropped on an unfamiliar planet by the Trandoshans. There, he runs into Ahsoka Tano and Jedi younglings O-Mer and Jinx, who have also been kidnapped.




In &#34;Wookiee Hunt,&#34; Ahsoka, O-Mer, Chewbacca, and Jinx join together to fight their attackers. Since the planet they are on is so isolated, the young group realizes it is very unlikely anyone will find them. Chewbacca, however, has an idea. His homeworld, Kashyyyk, is not far from where they are being held captive. He explains that he can send a distress signal if he can get the right parts. The four then team up to steal parts from the wreckage of a ship to build a transmitter. This causes a group of full-grown Wookiee warriors to show up just in time to aid the younglings as they fight their captors.



 Chewbacca Always Knew Far More About The Jedi Than Han 
          

This gives new context to the first Star Wars movie. Han Solo makes it abundantly clear from his early conversations with Luke and Obi-Wan that not only does he know nothing about the Jedi, but he also doesn&#39;t believe in the Force at all. He writes it off as a bunch of party tricks and old religious hogwash. Star Wars: The Clone Wars, however, reveals that Chewbacca knew about the Jedi years before he even met Han. During the episode, Ahsoka and the younglings use the Force in front of Chewbacca several times. As such, Chewbacca had seen firsthand that the Force was anything but a simple party trick.




This was not the only time that Chewbacca fought with a Jedi. He also fought in the Clone Wars alongside Master Yoda at the Battle of Kashyyyk. It is interesting then that Han Solo didn&#39;t believe in the Force even though his best friend had direct interactions with them. Considering how close the two are, it seems unlikely that Chewbacca never mentioned his time with Ahsoka or Master Yoda. However, Han Solo is a skeptic at his core. He probably dismissed Chewbacca&#39;s experience, choosing to take an I&#39;ll-believe-it-when-I-see-it approach instead - and setting up his famous Star Wars scenes.
