# Squid Game The Challenge Season 2 Renewed By Netflix


## SUMMARY 



  Squid Game: The Challenge season 2 has been officially greenlit by Netflix, continuing the success of the reality competition spin-off of the hit Korean drama.   The show follows a similar format to the scripted series, with hundreds of people competing in challenges to win a cash prize, but without the deadly consequences seen in the drama.   Netflix is excited to continue the franchise and considers Squid Game: The Challenge to be the most ambitious unscripted show they have premiered, with the season 1 finale releasing on December 6.

## Literature Review
The Squid Game spin-off has been a hit for Netflix, and now the streaming service is ready to start casting for Squid Game: The Challenge season 2.




Squid Game: The Challenge season 2 has officially been greenlit by Netflix. The reality competition show is a spin-off of the hit Korean drama Squid Game, which was released on the streaming service back in 2021. Squid Game season 2 is already in the works, with the cast list having been announced in June. The reality show version works similarly to the scripted series: hundreds of people compete against each other in a series of challenges to win $4.56 million. On the drama series, the players are killed if they fail a challenge. Obviously, nothing that horrendous happens on the reality show.




Netflix is already moving forward with Squid Game: The Challenge season 2, which the company announced just ahead of the inaugural finale.


 

In a press release, Brandon Riegg, Netflix&#39;s VP of Nonfiction Series, said, &#34;There was no red light in our decision to green light season 2 of Squid Game: The Challenge, the most ambitious unscripted show we&#39;ve premiered at Netflix. We&#39;re so excited to continue the franchise for Squid Game with our team in Korea, and producers at Studio Lambert and The Garden for this epic competition series.&#34;


 Squid Game: The Challenge Season 2 Casting Currently Underway 
          




The inaugural season isn&#39;t over yet, but Netflix has already begun the casting process for Squid Game: The Challenge season 2. Future contestants, who must be at least 21 years old, can fill out an online application now. There are three different applications, depending on everyone&#39;s location: U.S., U.K. and global. Applicants, who will have to be available to film the show for up to four weeks, are required to submit a video and headshot with their form. According to the casting website, the grand prize of $4.56 million will remain the same for Squid Game: The Challenge season 2.

There&#39;s only one episode left in Squid Game: The Challenge season 1. After the Circle of Trust in episode 9 eliminated six contestants--including Ashley, who has been considered a villain this season, mostly due to her behavior on the Glass Bridge--only three players remain: Sam, Mai and Phill. Squid Game: The Challenge has included some of the most iconic games featured in the original scripted Squid Game series, including Red Light, Green Light; Dalgona; Marbles; and Glass Bridge. The competition began with a whopping 456 players, which has been whittled down to only three across the first nine episodes.




Squid Game: The Challenge has faced intense scrutiny over allegedly inhumane filming conditions and allegations that some of the games are rigged in favor of certain players. Despite all of that, it shouldn&#39;t come as a surprise that Netflix renewed the reality show for another season. Not only is it an extremely buzz-worthy show, but Squid Game: The Challenge reached number 1 on Netflix&#39;s Top 10 English TV list. Most of Netflix&#39;s shows release entire seasons all at once, but Squid Game: The Challenge has been an exception, releasing batches of episodes every week, which was a smart move and has led to increased anticipation every Wednesday.

The Squid Game: The Challenge season 1 finale will be released December 6 at 9 p.m. EST on Netflix.
