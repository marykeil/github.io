## Literature Review
American Idol season 22&#39;s on the horizon, and with potential casting changes and a confirmed premiere date, AI&#39;s getting a lot of buzz.  




American Idol season 22 is coming to ABC, but what do we know about the upcoming season of the long-running reality competition series? After making waves in its initial run on FOX, American Idol moved to ABC in 2018 and revamped the series from its original format. While it&#39;s still recognizable, the show has implemented new judges and some new twists on the competition to make things more interesting for the contestants and viewers. With new contestants coming out to audition for American Idol each year, there&#39;s never a shortage of talent in the series. After years of creating brand-new idols, American Idol season 22 will continue the legacy.




Even though American Idol has been renewed by ABC for another season, there are still possible changes to come. Currently, the judges are Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie. The judges have all been present since American Idol made the shift to ABC, and before its current run, the judges changed out frequently and caused flurries of drama throughout its time on FOX. With the judges potentially switching up, it may finally be time for a change in the new iteration of the series. While American Idol is great as is, a fresh panel could be refreshing.


 American Idol Season 22 News 
          

American Idol season 22 has been renewed, and the judges have spoken with the press about their excitement for the upcoming season. With the American Idol season 21 winner, Iam Tongi, having been crowned in late May 2023, things have been quiet in terms of news outside the renewal. Currently, American Idol&#39;s gearing up for auditions for the upcoming season. With posts on their social media platforms asking for hopefuls to sign up, things seem to be moving smoothly regarding the upcoming season.






 American Idol Season 22 Is Confirmed 

 

American Idol season 22 was confirmed as renewed by ABC in late May 2023. It wasn&#39;t much of a question whether or not there would be another season of American Idol, as it&#39;s one of the highest-performing reality TV competition series on the network. With fans of the old American Idol tuning in to watch every week along with new fans, there&#39;s a lot of buzz surrounding each season and very little reason for ABC not to continue to renew the series. American Idol season 22 was renewed along with other ABC reality shows before the American Idol finale.

 American Idol Season 22 Potential Cast 
          

Though the contestants of American Idol season 22 are not yet known, the cast of the series may be facing a change in other spaces. After several seasons of judging, it may be possible that any of the three judges on the panel could decide their time with American Idol is over. While Katy, Lionel, and Luke have all spoken about the upcoming American Idol season 22 positively, one or more of them may choose to move away from the series in the upcoming months. With quite a bit of time, before the show is set to air, the possibilities are endless.
