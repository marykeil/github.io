## Literature Review
Welcome To Plathville&#39;s Micah Plath has gotten less attention than some of his siblings on the series, but many have noticed he&#39;s not a nice guy.




Micah Plath, one of the Plath children featured on Welcome To Plathville, has always been in the spotlight less than his siblings but has turned out just as nasty as most. Micah is the family’s second-born son, and while drama has always swirled around his older brother, Ethan Plath, and his younger sister, Moriah Plath, Micah has tried to stay more neutral in his behavior. Unfortunately, Micah&#39;s being raised by Kim Plath and Barry Plath has made it impossible for him to retain the level of normalcy he’d want. Although somewhat worse, Micah has become the same nasty person his parents and siblings are.
After years of seeing Micah on screen, Welcome To Plathville season 5 has re-introduced him as one of the more problematic members of the Plath family. Leaving his family behind in Georgia at one of the most critical times in their lives, Micah moved to Los Angeles to pursue his modeling career as his parents’ marriage was breaking down and his siblings needed him the most. While Micah has the right to pursue his dreams, his selfish behavior toward his family has made it clear he’s not the person they can depend on in the future.

Micah Appeared On Watch What Happens Live


 







In a recent Watch What Happens Live appearance, Micah appeared as the night’s bartender, and Andy Cohen asked him a few questions surrounding Welcome To Plathville’s most recent drama. Ethan and his wife, Olivia Plath, recently announced they were getting divorced after five years of marriage, and many jumped to the conclusion that Ethan was cheating on Olivia. The couple has yet to speak out about the reasoning behind their split. Still, during his appearance on WWHL, Micah insinuated that rather than Ethan having cheated on Olivia, it was more likely that Welcome To Plathville viewers would be shocked to discover Olivia had cheated on Ethan.

Micah Doesn&#39;t Do Serious Relationships
        

Although his relationships are rarely featured on Welcome To Plathville, Micah is known for his dating life. A serial dater, Micah never seems to be able to settle down into a long-term relationship. While the rest of his older siblings have managed to get into somewhat serious relationships, even if they haven’t lasted, Micah seems unable to stay with one woman or commit to a relationship at all. During his WWHL appearance, Micah said he “maybe” was dating someone new, but even the fact that he wasn’t clear on his confirmation shows that he’s not serious about anyone he’s ever with.





 6  Micah Plath’s So Vain

As an aspiring model, Micah tends to be all about his looks. When it comes to the Welcome To Plathville star pursuing his modeling career, Micah takes his passion very seriously. He’s been talking about modeling on the series for most of his time on the show, and in recent years, Micah has left his family to pursue his modeling career. Being a model, Micah is all about his looks. The intrinsic vanity of being a model isn’t foreign to Micah, who’s spent years of his life working to enhance his physical body, hoping that improving his outward appearance will make him the best version of himself.

While Kim and Barry ran a tight ship for the Plath family when Micah was younger, sheltering their children from modern technology as it was part of their fundamentalist religious beliefs, Micah took pride in rebelling against his parents. Though he appeared to be a well-behaved son, Micah did his best to live outside his parents’ rules and still worked hard to ensure his life was different now than it was when he was young. As a role model for his many younger siblings, Micah rebelling against his parents’ wishes has been difficult for the Plath family, who are still raising some younger children.

Although Micah’s entire family seems to be doing the same, his aspirations and how he presents himself make it clear that Micah is just chasing clout. His scenes on Welcome To Plathville show him working out or fussing with his appearance, which shows Micah&#39;s obsession with his looks.

 3  Micah Plath Can Be Selfish Sometimes 
Micah Isn&#39;t A Team Player
        

Micah’s behavior in the past has been selfish, especially in the years he’s been independent of his family. While Micah is still involved in his siblings’ lives, he moved from Georgia to Los Angeles to pursue his career, which was selfish for someone with many siblings he’s helped care for. Micah’s choice to move away made it impossible for his siblings to rely on him, especially with Ethan out of the picture. While Micah should be able to live his own life, his decision to move across the country was selfish.

Although Micah and Olivia didn’t seem to have animosity, they never had a close relationship. Micah and Ethan had always been close to one another as the oldest boys in the Plath family. For Micah, seeing Ethan marry Olivia when they had such different outlooks on life was an issue, and he’s been holding Olivia at arm’s length ever since their wedding in 2018. The Plath family, including Micah, even released a statement against Olivia in 2022, trying to discredit things she’s claimed during Welcome To Plathville season 4. Micah has always been more loyal to the people he considers his family than Olivia.

Micah’s position in the family has always been tricky for him to manage, as he’s the third oldest sibling and the second oldest son. Being more in the middle of the pack, Micah had siblings before him to pave the way and siblings after him to keep his parents busy. He’s always been less of a stand-out because of his birth order, which has made him closed off from having a deep relationship with his parents. Even on Welcome To Plathville, it’s clear that Micah doesn’t feel a close bond with Kim or Barry, no matter how hard he tries.
