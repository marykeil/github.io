## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 brought many stars from different shows together, including Peter Weber, Trishelle Cannatella, and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu.




The Traitors US season 2 introduced many cast members from different reality TV franchises, like The Challenge’s Trishelle Cannatella, The Bachelor’s Peter Weber, and Love Island UK’s Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu who sat down with Screen Rant to share about their experiences on the show. While many reality TV personalities mingle outside of their series, it’s not as typical to appear on shows with so many other big names. The Traitors US has become one of the few shows that invites different franchises into a game that puts them on an even playing field. Without The Traitors US season 2, many of the cast members likely wouldn&#39;t have met. 




The Traitors US season 2&#39;s all-star cast includes a huge mix of personalities and interpersonal relationships. For some, The Traitors US is the first time they’re crossing paths with big names in reality competition like Big Brother’s Dan Gheesling or Survivor’s Sandra Diaz-Twine. For others, the reality TV series is a reunion, like for Sandra and her Survivor rival Pavarti Shallow or former Big Brother allies Dan and Janelle Pierzina. The series even invited The Real Housewives Of Miami&#39;s Larsa Pippen, along with her boyfriend, Marcus Jordan, to compete in the game of deception, bringing them all to the Scottish highlands to play.

With huge names in reality, like The Bachelor’s Peter and Married To Medicine’s Phaedra Parks on The Traitors US season 2, the series has already been explosive in its early episodes. While Peter came in as the only representative of The Bachelor franchise, Ekin-Su was met with Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen of Love Island USA season 5 when she got to the castle, and Trishelle had two veterans from The Challenge waiting for her, Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio and Chris “C.T.” Tamburello. Coming into the game was tricky for all three players, and their experiences were exciting to learn about.




Screen Rant: Hello, hello! Alright, so, although you all have reality TV experience, you also have some really diverse other experiences within your backgrounds. What from your past have you been able to take into this game, and what experiences did you bring into it that were helpful to you?


Trishelle Cannatella: I’m a poker player. So, for me, I didn’t really want to put it out there too much, but there’s a lot of strategy, it’s about how people perceive you at the table, it’s about how you read people. So I’m sort of used to, mostly males, playing with them, but used to seeing people and getting tells and seeing that. So I think it was very helpful in this game.
Peter Weber: I would say, you know, with what I do with my job of flying planes, it’s a very analytical job, and I was able to really kind of use that skill, I think, in this kind of game. In an airplane you always want to have really good situational awareness of all your surroundings, always observing everything, any kind of tell, monitoring systems and all that. And you could kind of see how that could go towards a game like this, using those skills. Just staying super analytical about it, and keep thinking with your head, and making smart, sound decisions, and observing your environment as best as possible.
Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: And then for me, it’s more that I come from an acting background, I studied acting as a degree. I was doing acting in Turkey, in soaps. So for me, I was all about body language, eye contact - if someone’s lying, they tend to look to the left, they fidget a lot - you know, I was looking at more the physical things. If someone was sweating a lot when I would confront them, or if they would look away or if they would walk away. So, for me, it helped me in the show a lot.
But some people surprised me, you know, they were very good at portraying an innocent character. But sometimes you would see the odd slip, when you think, that person could be, but then they’d played the game again. So, it isn’t exactly easy.





Screen Rant: I can imagine it being incredibly difficult, especially with such a high-caliber cast. So, for your initial roles, were you satisfied with the roles that you received? Or would you have hoped to have been a traitor?


Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: I think everyone’s going to say no, I think everyone wants to be a traitor.
Peter Weber: Yeah, I think everyone wanted to be a traitor. Again, you get so much power with traitor. A lot of stress –
Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: How cool would it have been if us 3 were traitors, right? I would love that.
Trishelle Cannatella: Yeah.
Peter Weber: Oh, I’d play with you girls for sure.


Screen Rant: That would’ve been so fun.


Trishelle Cannatella: Just the ability to sleep well at night, and not having to worry about getting a note saying that you’re murdered, it’s just huge. Yeah.





Screen Rant: I can imagine. So would you say, if you came back into the game, completely fresh, all 3 of you would’ve wanted to be traitors? 


Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: 100%.
Trishelle Cannatella: I would, yeah.
Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: And I think we’d make a great team, us 3. I really do.
Trishelle Cannatella: I think so too. We’d be on the same page, I feel like we would pretty much…
Peter Weber: We’d be dangerous, for sure.


Screen Rant: Incredible. Now, all 3 of you have very different franchise experience, obviously, we have The Challenge, The Bachelor, Love Island. Who from your franchise would you be interested to see on The Traitors in the future if you could pick one person?


Trishelle Cannatella: I think from MTV, I feel like Beth [Stolarczyk] would be amazing. She was just such a villain. She even has a villainous laugh. I mean, she would be really good on The Traitors, I could see her giving some good one-liners as well, so, I would like to see Beth.





Screen Rant: That’s an incredible choice.


Trishelle Cannatella: Yeah!
Peter Weber: You know, I think – Trishelle, actually brought this up a little bit ago – I think Hannah, Hannah Brown. She obviously has had great success in other competition shows that she did post-Bachelorette, so, I think she’d do really well.


Screen Rant: That’s awesome, good answers, good answers. And who do you think from this season of The Traitors would do well on your initial franchise?


Trishelle Cannatella: Peter would kill it in a Challenge!
Peter Weber: Hell yeah, let’s go.
Trishelle Cannatella: I was blown away by his athletic ability, and I was just like, oh my god, Peter. I could not believe it. And Bergie as well. There were just people that I just had no clue had so much athletic ability, I was just… wow.
Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: I think Peter would be good on Love Island.
Peter Weber: You guys are too sweet.





Screen Rant: Peter getting his flowers today.


Peter Weber: Well, I’m still single, so.
Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu: I do think he’d be good on Love Island, yeah, I think.
Peter Weber: I think – he’s not single, so it’s not going to happen, but if Bergie was single, I think he would steal America’s heart as The Bachelor. He would be a great Bachelor. I love that guy, we became very close. So, I’m going Bergie.
Trishelle Cannatella: Oh yeah, I love that.
