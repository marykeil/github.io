## Literature Review
The best TV friendships feel relatable and fun, not just because the characters share some laughs, but also because they ride out the tough times.




The best TV friendships aren&#39;t just vicarious, aspirational relationships, they also show the difficult realities of platonic love. Watching great friendships can be very enjoyable, but they ultimately don&#39;t resonate with audiences if they aren&#39;t representative of real life. In reality, friendships aren&#39;t always idealized fun-and-games, like some sitcoms portray. Friendships can go through difficult or awkward periods, but the real test of a friendship is if they are able to withstand tough times and become stronger.
Even unusual TV friendships must have an element of truth about them for people to relate to. They should be broadly relatable but specific to the individual traits of each character. The best fictional friends bring the best out of each other, and they can often help each other deal with their character flaws. Since some shows can last for a long time, on-screen friendships get the chance to develop slowly and organically. It can often help if the actors share great chemistry or if they are friends in real life, because enjoyable TV friendships need to feel like open and inviting to the audience.









 








 15  Olivia Benson &amp; Elliot Stabler 
Law and Order: Special Victims Unit


 







Benson and Stabler’s partnership means more to them than just work. They work some extremely disturbing cases together in the Special Victims Unit, and this allows them to see each other at their absolute lowest. Nevertheless, they will always be there to pick each other up and go again. They’ve saved each other’s lives countless times, and Benson showed that their friendship is still important years later by showing up in Law and Order: Organized Crime to help him cope with the loss of his wife.





 14  Jerry &amp; Kramer 
Seinfeld
        

Kramer bursts into Jerry’s apartment pretty much every day, leaving Jerry little choice but to accept his aggressive brand of friendship. 

Kramer starts out as Jerry’s oddball neighbor, but they become good friends very quickly. Kramer bursts into Jerry’s apartment pretty much every day to share the wacky schemes he’s gotten himself into, leaving Jerry little choice but to accept his aggressive brand of friendship. Kramer gifts Jerry with a pasta sculpture, he drives out to Long Island to pick him up from a party, and he even gives Jerry some of his own blood. In response, Jerry doesn’t do much of anything, but Kramer takes enough of his food over the years that they are probably even.





 13  Jake &amp; Finn 
Adventure Time
        

Finn’s origins are a mystery to him, and although he is a young orphan in a magical land, he can always count on Jake to be there for him. The duo love going off on daring adventures across Ooo, slaying monsters and rescuing those in need, but they are just as happy playing card games in the treehouse or making a movie together with BMO. No matter how many demons or mutants are coming at them, Jake and Finn never give up on each other.





 12  Mark &amp; Jez 
Peep Show
        

Mark is uptight and often snobbish, while Jez is a reckless party animal. They should be polar opposites, but their strange friendship keeps them together for years. Mark tries to get rid of Jez at one point, after he confesses his love to Dobby, but the El Dude Brothers eventually reunite, dragging Mark’s new roommate out of his bed in the middle of the night. They argue constantly, but deep down they know that there a few people out there who will put up with each other’s disfunction, and they depend on one another.
            
 
 Peep Show: The 10 Best Episodes Ranked 
British comedy Peep Show was famous for its ridiculous, irreverent humor, and here are the 10 best episodes of Peep Show, ranked.









 11  Will &amp; Carlton 
The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
        

Will could hardly be more out of place when he moves to Bel-Air, and this is emphasized by the difference between himself and his cousin Carlton. Fresh Prince’s Banks family heaps a lot of pressure on Carlton as the eldest child, and this responsibility makes him a little too self-serious at times. Will helps him see the lighter side of things, and he breaks Carlton out of his shell. In return, Carlton helps Will assimilate to his new surroundings.





 10  Liz &amp; Jack 
30 Rock
        

Liz and Jack get off to a rough start, as Jack announces Liz’s old boss is dead, and he promptly tries to fire her producer, Pete. They are complete opposites, and they rub each other the wrong way. Liz is an idealistic, creative liberal, and Jack is a greedy, cynical conservative. However, they develop a mutual respect, and their friendship shows that even diametrically opposed people can find common ground if they give each other a chance. Jack ends up being Liz’s biggest supporter. He’s a mentor as well as a friend.





 9  Frank &amp; Charlie 
It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia


 







Frank is a multimillionaire, but he happily trades in his luxurious lifestyle to live in squalor with Charlie. The friends share a bed, a can, and a toe knife, for no reason other than the fact that they choose to live that way. Frank can fund any hair-brained scheme the gang cooks up while also investing in Wolf Cola and buying a ski resort, but he doesn’t want to change his life with Charlie in any way.





 8  Penelope &amp; Derek Morgan 
Criminal Minds
        

Morgan and Penelope have a flirty friendship, but there are no real romantic feelings between the two. They only flirt with each other as a way of building each other up, and expressing how much they mean to one another. Amid the highly pressurized work that the BAU does, Penelope and Morgan support one another. They are a perfect team, not only helping each other on the case, but also making sure that one another is handling the emotional strain.





 7  Abbi &amp; Ilana 
Broad City
        

Broad City focuses on a sex-positive, queer, 21st Century female friendship, which is still a rarity for modern sitcoms. 

Broad City focuses on a sex-positive, queer, 21st Century female friendship, which is still a rarity for modern sitcoms. Sitcom friendships are more often about bromances or platonic male-female relationships, but Broad City proudly stands out and dares to be different. Abbi and Ilana share a classic introvert-extrovert dynamic. Abbi is an overthinker who struggles to live in the moment, and Ilana is a non-committal free spirit. They are both at a time in their lives when they don’t know what they want, but they have completely different ways of dealing with that realization.





 6  Troy &amp; Abed 
Community


 







Troy and Abed allow each other to indulge in their fantasies, no matter how immature or obscure they may be. Their apartment is a perfect example of their friendship, as they would rather sleep on bunk beds in the living room than take down their “dreamatorium”, a holodeck-inspired imaginary play space. Their playful personalities align perfectly, like they are two members of a very special club with strange rules. Hopefully, the upcoming Community movie will revive “Troy and Abed in the Morning” or their pillow fort wars.





 5  SpongeBob &amp; Patrick 
SpongeBob SquarePants
        

They annoy pretty much everyone in Bikini Bottom, especially Squidward, but they always do so together, and they are a perfect match. SpongeBob has the edge over Patrick in the brains department, just barely, but the two love getting into poorly-conceived shenanigans. They are at their happiest when they embrace their ignorance. SpongeBob seems keenly attuned to Patrick’s particular brand of buffoonery, so even when nobody else will tolerate Patrick, SpongeBob is more than happy to go and catch jellyfish with him.





 4  Christina &amp; Meredith 
Grey&#39;s Anatomy
        

Christina and Meredith are there for each other through thick and thin, and that includes break-ups, deaths, plane crashes and a laundry list of other traumatic events. They have plenty of highs and lows, but their friendship is extremely resilient, and they never stop being “each other’s person.” They are still friends with the other doctors, but their bond is much stronger than average. Christina and Meredith both understand that sometimes a problem is so big that the only solution is to dance it out.
            
 
 Grey&#39;s Anatomy: 10 Episodes To Watch If You Miss Meredith &amp; Cristina 
Meredith and Cristina&#39;s peculiar friendship shined through Grey&#39;s Anatomy seasons 1 to 10, but some specific episodes are central to understanding it.









 3  Chandler &amp; Joey 
Friends
        

Friends, obviously, is about a whole group of friends, but Chandler and Joey’s dynamic still stands out. Since they live together for such a long time, Chandler and Joey share a much closer bond than some others in the friend group. Joey’s airheaded personality perfectly complements Chandler’s sarcasm, and Joey rarely gets tired of Chandler’s comments the way that everyone else does. Their friendship faces a few challenges, like when Chandler kisses Joey’s sister, or when Joey accidentally lets their apartment get robbed, but they always forgive each other before too long.





 2  Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte &amp; Miranda 
Sex and the City
        

The four friends in Sex and the City have completely different views and personalities, but this is exactly what makes them such a strong friendship group. They each feel free to express their opinions and life and love without judgment from the others, and this is much more interesting than a group of friends who simply agree with each other on every point. There is always respect between the women, and they help each other push the boundaries of their comfort zones.





 1  Turk &amp; J.D. 
Scrubs
        

In the high-pressure, high-stakes environment at the hospital, the duo help each other regress to their gleeful childish selves. 

On his very first day at Sacred Heart Hospital, J.D. meets Turk and Elliot, and they quickly become the most important people in his life. J.D. and Elliot endure a rocky on-again-off-again relationship for a while, but J.D. can always count on Turk to take his mind off things. In the high-pressure, high-stakes environment at the hospital, the duo help each other regress to their gleeful childish selves. Scrubs stars Zach Braff and Donald Faison are friends in real life too, and their dynamic translates perfectly onto the screen.
