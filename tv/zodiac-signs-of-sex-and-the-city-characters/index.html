  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sex And The City is one of the most iconic TV shows of all time. Find out the zodiac signs of Carrie Bradshaw and the other main characters!</p>
<p>The Sex and the City zodiac signs both give key insight into the personalities of the characters, and are a way for long-time fans of the classic sitcom to find out who they most align with. While Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), Samantha (Kim Cattrall), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) navigated love and life in the Big Apple, each of them possessed certain personality traits that helped them balance their professional and romantic struggles and triumphs.</p>
<p>The very first episode of the series opened up with Miranda&rsquo;s 35th birthday, and the birthday celebrations represented more than just milestones in the lives of the Sex and the City characters from the start to the sequel show And Just Like That. They indicate how their personalities correspond to their zodiac sign with their inherent strengths and weaknesses. Birthdates help determine star signs, while moon signs help understand the shadow selves of the characters, which are parts of their personality that influence their decisions but don&rsquo;t always allow others to see.</p>
<pre><code>    Sex &amp; The City: 10 Things That Happened In Season 1 That You Completely Forgot About  A lot changed over Sex and the City's six seasons, so much so, it is surprising to look back at some of the stuff that happened in HBO's season 1.   
</code></pre>
<p>Mr. Big - Aries
Played By Chris Noth</p>
<p>Born on April 7, 1955, Mr. Big is a business tycoon as well as a womanizer and knows how to work a room. His confidence and charisma stole Carrie&rsquo;s heart, but their relationship was the only deal he had a hard time closing. When it comes to the Sex and the City zodiac signs, he is a natural Aries. Big is aptly named for his larger-than-life presence. His aggressive tendencies make him impulsive and quick-tempered, but beneath his bravado beats the heart of a romantic if only he could get over his fear of commitment.</p>
<p>While Mr. Big and Carrie eventually settled down, he unfortunately died in the first episode of
And Just Like That.</p>
<p>Mr. Big Moon — Libra
Played By Chris Noth</p>
<p>Thanks to the moon on his birthday, Big is always going to be a softy. Despite his confidence and swagger, a tender-hearted romantic lurks inside, waiting for the right person to engage his Libra tendencies. An actual Libra like Carrie fits perfectly. Big finds one person who can emotionally satisfy him, and despite how ambiguous he is with his feelings, he remains devoted to Carrie. He wines and dines her, and tries to introduce her to the things that mean something to him. Like his Henry Mancini records, he is a classic.</p>
<p>Che Diaz - Aries
Played By Sara Ramirez</p>
<p>Appearing in And Just Like That as Carrie&rsquo;s boss and the host of a popular podcast, Che Diaz takes an active role in Carrie&rsquo;s private life after Big&rsquo;s death and her hip surgery. Besides Carrie, they also feature prominently in Miranda&rsquo;s life as a romantic partner, which muddies the water of Miranda and Carrie&rsquo;s bond in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Che has the swagger and charisma of an Aries, and while these traits can lead to several moments of confrontation in the series, they would rather be momentarily uncomfortable than let fear govern their life. Che&rsquo;s not as much of an impulsive Aries as Big, but they can be a selfish Aries, not understanding when Miranda chooses to put her son first.</p>
<p>Samantha Jones - Taurus
Played By Kim Cattrall</p>
<p>Born on April 28, 1958, Samantha Jones is a notorious seductress in the New York City social scene as well as an influential publicist. She is as lethal in dealings of business as she is with pleasure — taking no prisoners and living authentically. She shows loyalty and warmth with her friends, but with celebrities and business partners, she is self-indulgent and downright greedy. With lovers, she often runs hot and cold, needing a lot of security before feeling comfortable opening up. Those are all hallmark Taurus traits.</p>
<p>Samantha Jones: Moon - Leo
Played By Kim Cattrall</p>
<p>Her birthday assigns her the lunar sign, Leo, and the moon seems to know that Samantha would only risk her self-respect when it comes to someone she truly loves. Even then, she would never expect her independence to go away. Samantha demands to feel prized by whomever she is with, whether it is a fling or someone like Richard Wright, who showers her with affection only to abandon her when she returns it in earnest. Like many Leos, Samantha can love and live boldly, but it has to be on her terms.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Carrie Bradshaw - Libra
Played By Sarah Jessica Parker</p>
<p>Carrie Bradshaw&rsquo;s birthday is October 10, 1968, making her the most naturally romantic sign — Libra. Her weekly column about love in the big city provides the framework for each episode, and her opinions on dating provide a sign for modern single women everywhere. Like a true Libra, Carrie believes in love, &ldquo;Real love. Ridiculous, inconvenient, consuming, can&rsquo;t-live-without-each-other-love&rdquo;, and will do anything to find it. She is the most flirtatious and easygoing, though she has a tendency to be easily influenced.</p>
<p>Carrie Bradshaw: Moon - Taurus
Played By Sarah Jessica Parker</p>
<p>While Carrie Bradshaw&rsquo;s zodiac star sign may be a loving Libra, according to the lunar chart for her birth, her moon sign is Taurus, which aligns with her tendency to pull away from those who hurt her, like Mr. Big. She craves affection and passion, but when she doesn&rsquo;t get it she can turn cold, petty, and cruel. Things go badly once Carrie starts to date Big, including drawing a rift between her friends.</p>
<p>When it comes to her friends, she can be loyal and dependable, acting as the social &ldquo;glue&rdquo; that keeps them all together, but her irrational temper can divide them just as much.</p>
<p>Smith Jerrod - Gemini
Played By Jason Lewis</p>
<p>Samantha Jones&rsquo; boyfriend Jerry &ldquo;Smith&rdquo; Jerrod may not have had a birthday shout-out. Still, his resourceful attitude, sense of humor, and youthful energy certainly point to him being a Gemini. Among the Sex and the City zodiac signs, Smith is a natural fit. As a Gemini, Smith often has to be adaptive, whether it means auditioning for a Hollywood blockbuster or a spot on Samantha&rsquo;s social calendar. He demonstrates his sign&rsquo;s inquisitiveness whenever he wants to break down Samantha&rsquo;s emotional walls.</p>
<p>Charlotte York - Aquarius
Played By Kristin Davis</p>
<p>Born on January 23, 1967, Charlotte York is a gallerist and a homemaker and is the most traditional of all her friends. Her birthday places her just at the start of the Aquarius season. She loves vintage glamour and elegance and believes her romantic partner is just there waiting for her. Friendly and loyal, Charlotte is often the mediator in her group of friends. While she isn&rsquo;t as wildly creative as some Aquarius, she values the creativity of others and supports the art world.</p>
<p>Charlotte York: Moon - Gemini
Played By Kristin Davis</p>
<p>Playful and optimistic, it&rsquo;s not surprising that Charlotte&rsquo;s birthday makes her moon sign a Gemini. Though she tends to overthink things during a good gossip session with her friends, she can never be pessimistic for too long. With her peppy, youthful demeanor, her sign makes her a perfect social darling at any party or gallery opening. She is never afraid to mingle, speak her mind, or have new experiences (even when it comes to sexual activities she never thought she&rsquo;d try).</p>
<pre><code>    Sex And The City: Why Charlotte Is Actually The Show's Main Character  Sex and the City fans agree Carrie is the de facto protagonist of the series, but what about Charlotte? What qualifies her to be the main character?   
</code></pre>
<p>Miranda Hobbes - Cancer
Played By Cynthia Nixon</p>
<p>Born in July 1966, Miranda Hobbes is a high-powered lawyer who never feels like she needs a man to get what she wants out of life. She sees any lover in her life as her equal and not someone who needs to support her. Within the Sex and the City zodiac signs, Miranda is a Cancer.</p>
<p>As a Cancer, Miranda is incredibly cautious and shrewd, almost going so far as to be skeptical of men who act in good faith. Once Miranda&rsquo;s boyfriend Steve gets past her moody side, she can be quite loving, warm, and loyal. The nurturing instincts of Cancer are best exhibited among the Sex and the City zodiac signs when she drops everything to help her son, no matter how it might affect her own life.</p>
<p>Miranda Hobbes: Moon - Sagittarius
Played By Cynthia Nixon</p>
<p>Given that she was born in July, Miranda could have had any number of lunar signs given the position of the moon on her birthday, but she most closely resembles a Sagittarius. She is vocal when she gets emotional, often relying on humor to diffuse a situation she feels vulnerable in, but isn&rsquo;t known for being effusive in general. Despite her need for control, she needs freedom in her relationships to do as she pleases. She knows the benefits of a relationship, but unless it meets her standards, it is easier to be single.</p>
<p>Harry Goldenblatt - Leo
Played By Evan Handler</p>
<p>The gregarious and good-natured second husband of Charlotte York, Harry Goldenblatt begins their courtship as her divorce lawyer. Though his birthday isn&rsquo;t celebrated in the series, those qualities indicate he&rsquo;s got the bravado of the lion sign and is almost definitely a Leo. When he is working, Harry can be bossy and pompous, but when he is home with his wife, he is devoted and loving. Leos are known for being open-minded, and Harry is quick to agree about adopting a baby with Charlotte when she can&rsquo;t have a child of her own.</p>
<p>Seema Patel - Leo
Played By Sarita Choudhury</p>
<p>First introduced as Carrie&rsquo;s realtor in And Just Like That, Seema Patel becomes a close friend to her when she sells her apartment and helps her start her new chapter after Big. Smart, exacting, and with a fabulous sense of style, she&rsquo;s very similar to Samantha Jones, but with distinct differences. Seema might be straightforward and tough, but she&rsquo;s also generous and is a natural leader — all traditional Leo traits. Unlike Samantha, Seema has romantic sensibilities beneath her well-put-together exterior.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Stanford Blatch - Virgo
Played By Willie Garson</p>
<p>While most of the gay men in Sex and the City strut on the streets of NYC like they are on the runway, Stanford Blatch is modest and shy. He is the first to admit to Carrie that he doesn&rsquo;t feel like he fits in anywhere. While his birthday is never mentioned in the series, his meticulous traits point to him being a Virgo among the Sex and the City zodiac signs, especially when he gets overly fussy and critical. He constantly worries about how he is perceived in public, and how his family views him, given he isn&rsquo;t out to all of them.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Petrosvky - Scorpio
Played By Mikhail Baryshnikov</p>
<p>The series never expressly states Aleksandr Petrovsky&rsquo;s birthday. Still, it seems like the mercurial and brooding artist would have been born sometime in the winter months of October or November. That makes his Sex and the City zodiac sign a Scorpio. Like many Scorpios, he can be passionate and emotionally provocative. He is world-renowned and has a magnetism that entrances Carrie, but when it comes time for him to let her share the spotlight, he becomes jealous and resentful.</p>
<p>Lisa Todd Wexley - Scorpio
Played By Nicole Ari Parker</p>
<p>Lisa and Charlotte bond over their children attending the same school before exploring a deeper side to their friendship through a shared love of art collecting. A gifted documentary filmmaker who balances her career with her children&rsquo;s recitals, she lives in a world that thrives on culture, art, and music. Sex and the City zodiac signs point to her being a Scorpio. The series shows her being incredibly decisive and strong-willed with her mom group, but capable of some heartwarming scenes with Charlotte.</p>
<p>Aidan Shaw - Sagittarius
Played By John Corbett</p>
<p>The second-biggest love in Carrie&rsquo;s life doesn&rsquo;t get a birthday mention in Sex and the City, but his easygoing attitude, laconic charm, and straightforward approach to love make him a perfect Sagittarius. Aidan loves Carrie despite her neurotic flaws, perhaps too carelessly to realize that she doesn&rsquo;t respond with the same fervor. He is a country boy, and she will forever be a city girl. Despite Carrie being a terrible girlfriend at times, his enduring optimism never lets them be enemies.</p>
<pre><code>    Sex And The City: Miranda's 10 Worst Flings, Ranked  If anyone in Sex and the City has had their excessive amount of awkward or bad flings, it's Miranda. Yet, which of them are considered her worst?   
</code></pre>
<p>Anthony Marantino - Capricorn
Played By Mario Cantone</p>
<p>Anthony Marantino bursts into Charlotte York&rsquo;s life as a loud, proud gay event planner who has no problem telling her exactly what is on his mind, especially after he helps plan her wedding. His presence in And Just Like That has only been amplified as he&rsquo;s become more of a part of these women&rsquo;s lives. Though his birthday is never mentioned, with his absolute candor, his pessimism about love, and his eternally practical way of looking at life, he seems like a perfect Capricorn within the Sex and the City zodiac signs.</p>
<p>Dr. Nya Wallace - Capricorn
Played By Karen Pittman</p>
<p>Miranda&rsquo;s professor at Columbia Law School, Dr. Nya Wallace is more similar to her student than she realizes. Industrious, analytical, and goal-driven, she doesn&rsquo;t let Miranda get too comfortable in her interpretation of her studies. Dr. Wallace&rsquo;s birthday isn&rsquo;t mentioned, but like Miranda, she seems shrewd and focused as a Capricorn. Similarly, the two women struggle with being open and honest about subjects that come from the heart, but when they can broach sensitive issues, their discussions are very fulfilling.</p>
<p>Brady Hobbes - Aquarius
Played By Niall Cunningham</p>
<p>It is July when Miranda announces she is two months pregnant to Samantha, making Brady a February baby. And Just Like That treats fans to a very adult Brady, who has a live-in girlfriend and doesn&rsquo;t back down from his mother when she questions his choices. Like many Aquariuses, he&rsquo;s a rebel at heart and marches to the beat of his own drum. Though he might come across as a defiant teen, he can be insightful, especially when calling out his mother&rsquo;s hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Steve Brady - Pisces
Played By David Eigenberg</p>
<p>Of all of Miranda&rsquo;s boyfriends, Steve Brady is the most sensitive and earnest. He is giving and selfless, and eventually, he wins over her New York cynicism. These qualities indicate he is a Pisces. He is prone to seeing the world through rose-colored glasses, which Miranda first thought made him naive. But his carefree attitude rubs off on her, and he is the best possible husband and dad. Like all the Sex and the City zodiac signs, Steve&rsquo;s certainly compliments his personality and decisions made in the series.</p>
