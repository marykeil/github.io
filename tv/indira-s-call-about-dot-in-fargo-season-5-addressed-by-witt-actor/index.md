Summary

  Lamorne Morris explains the significance of Indira&#39;s call to save Dot in Fargo season 5, episode 9 - it aligns with Witt&#39;s character and mission.   The call sets the stage for the final episode by putting Witt in a leading role in the FBI&#39;s case.   Witt&#39;s decision to save Dot is driven by a sense of duty and personal connection to his own family.  







Fargo star Lamorne Morris opens up about the meaning behind Indira&#39;s call to Witt about being the one to save Dot. During the events of season 5, episode 9, Witt gets a call from the deputy, who tells him he needs to be the one to save Dot from Roy Tillman. This leads to the officer becoming a leading figure in the FBI&#39;s case to find her and bring the sheriff holding her captive to justice.

Speaking with Variety, Morris explains his reaction to the phone call between Indira and Witt in Fargo season 5 episode 9. The actor reveals how the development made sense for both the story and character, setting the stage for the upcoming final episode. Check out what Morris has to say below:


It felt expected, because it seems like he’s on this solo mission. He’s got Indira helping him here and there, but being a Black dude in this type of town, this environment, maybe you want to stay out of the way. And when I read that, I thought, “Well, this makes sense to who he is.” Not to the average person, but to who he is because he owes this debt, and it’s just the right thing to do. Witt Farr has sisters and a mother, that’s his thing. It just made sense that this would be his mission to go and try to fix things.






 How Will Fargo Season 5 End? 
          

The latest episode of Fargo ended with Munch setting Dot free, killing three of Roy&#39;s men in the process. While Witt is still leading the FBI onto the Stark County sheriff&#39;s land, Dot&#39;s escape indicates the season finale will be even more complex than previously thought. It&#39;s possible she will instead use her newfound freedom to confront her first husband, bringing the series to a brutal end on her terms.

Given how shocking the series often is, though, it&#39;s unclear who will survive the final episode. This includes FBI agents like Tony and Meyer, who could be caught in the crossfire, as well as Gator, whom Munch may still utilize for an act of revenge. No matter what events transpire in the final episode, it&#39;s clear Dot, Witt, and the members of Roy&#39;s ranch will be heavily involved in the climactic confrontation.




                  Joe Keery’s Dark Fargo Season 5 Role Is A Great Reminder To Watch This Horror Movie From 4 Years Ago   Known for being in Stranger Things, Joe Keery played a dark villain in season 5 of Fargo which serves as a reminder to watch a great horror film.    

The final episode could also offer a more direct connection between Fargo season 5 and the previous entries of the series. So far, there haven&#39;t been any indications of how this season connects to the others, a staple of the show that may be addressed when the finale airs. With plenty of events and Easter eggs that could still arrive, it appears the newest season&#39;s finale will be one of its most explosive.



Fargo&#39;s season 5 finale airs on Tuesday, January 16 on FX. It will be available for streaming on Hulu the following day.
