# The Secret Behind Star Trek DS9 s 26 Hour Day


## SUMMARY 



  On Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, a day is measured as 26 hours, which is based on Bajoran time. This is because DS9 orbited Bajor and needed synchronized clocks for communication and travel purposes.   The use of &#34;26 hours&#34; as a standard measurement of time in DS9 was unique to the show and not a random decision. It helped emphasize that DS9 was not a Federation station and had a close relationship with Bajoran customs and traditions.   Implementing a 24-hour Earth-based day on DS9 would have complicated communication between Bajor and the station, and gone against the Federation&#39;s value of respecting and honoring other cultures.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine uses a 26 hour day cycle instead of Earth&#39;s 24 hours, and there&#39;s a logical reason why.




On Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, 26 hours was often referenced as a typical measurement of time. First heard in DS9 season 1, episode 3, &#34;A Man Alone,&#34; with Constable Odo (Rene Auberjonois) delivering an ultimatum to an unwanted guest, &#34;26 hours&#34; sounded like a particularly arbitrary decision on Odo&#39;s part. It was close enough to 24 hours, which one might expect to be a standard day, but why were there two extra hours? Was Odo just making up a random length of time? It turns out there was a reason that Deep Space Nine counted time differently from the way that modern Earth-based viewers of the show did.




Even the actors who were on Star Trek weren&#39;t sure about the seemingly random number of hours for this deadline. On The Delta Flyers season 9, episode 3, discussing &#34;A Man Alone&#34;, podcast host and Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Harry Kim actor, Garrett Wang, expressed confusion over Odo&#39;s decision to give the guest 26 hours to leave. Co-host Terry Farrell, DS9&#39;s Jadzia Dax actor, agreed that it was an unusual choice, and likened it to releasing the podcast at an odd hour. Read their quotes below, and check out The Delta Flyers podcast, beginning at the 14:05 mark:


Garret Wang: &#34;Odo gives the Bajoran 26 hours to leave the station, which I thought was funny ... 26 hours? That&#39;s a weird number. It&#39;s not even 24 hours ... you have one day and two hours to leave.&#34;



Terry Farrell: &#34;It&#39;s a weird number. ... It&#39;s like us saying &#39;the podcast starts at 4:11&#39;.&#34;



 





 Deep Space Nine Uses Bajor&#39;s 26-Hour Day 
DS9&#39;s Bajoran Customs Remind Viewers It&#39;s Not a Federation Station
         

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s frequent use of &#34;26 hours&#34; as a standard measurement of time was based on the fact that a day on Bajor was 26 hours long. It made sense for DS9 to use a Bajoran day as a reference point when describing time on the station, because Deep Space Nine orbited Bajor, and clocks could be easily synchronized between the station and the planet below for communication and travel purposes. DS9 had operated on Bajor&#39;s 26-hour day since it was built as a Cardassian mining station, and there was no reason to change the clocks once the Federation arrived to help ease Bajor&#39;s transition to an independent state.



In DS9 season 6, episode 20 &#34;His Way&#34;, Vic Fontaine (James Darren) converted 10:00 PM to 2200, but on a 26-hour clock, 10:00 PM would correspond to 2300.







Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&#39;s space station population was primarily Bajoran, so they celebrated Bajoran holidays like the gratitude festival in DS9 season 3, episode 10 &#34;Fascination&#34;, and honored the Bajoran religion with the local temple on the Promenade. The Bajoran militia remained in charge after Starfleet&#39;s presence ended, seen in Star Trek: Lower Decks season 3, episode 6 &#34;Hear All, Trust Nothing&#34;, with Colonel Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) in command of DS9 as of 2381. Starfleet never intended to stay on DS9, so implementing an Earth-based 24-hour day would have made communication between Bajor and DS9 more complicated, and worse, gone against the Federation&#39;s ideal of respect for other cultures.

Star Trek: Deep Space Nine is streaming on Paramount&#43;.
