## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin takes home the America&#39;s Favorite Player prize, but he thought someone else would come out on top instead.




Big Brother season 25 houseguest Cameron Hardin won America&#39;s Favorite Player, but he thought his fellow houseguest Cirie Fields would&#39;ve taken home the $50,000 prize. Cameron established himself as a new Big Brother legend, winning three Head of Household (HOH) and two Power of Veto competitions, along with resurrecting his game through the Resurrection Rumble and the Do or Die competition. He was also nominated for eviction five times. Cameron prided himself on being an agent of chaos and was a joy to watch. On finale night, host Julie Chen Moonves revealed that the top three America&#39;s Favorite Player vote-getters were Cameron, Cirie, and runner-up Matt Klotz, and Cameron won.




In an interview with EW, Cameron revealed that he thought Cirie was going to win America&#39;s Favorite Player. He said, &#34;I was fully banking on Cirie. I was standing next to her. I was just like, &#39;Man, at least I&#39;m in the top three. This is pretty cool. Man, Cirie, this is really awesome.&#39;&#34; Cameron shared that he was so surprised to have won, saying, &#34;I still don&#39;t have the words. I can&#39;t put it all together, man. My favorite television show since 2001. I can&#39;t believe that fans of my favorite TV show decided that I was their favorite player. I cannot wrap my brain around it still.&#34;

 Big Brother&#39;s Cameron Hardin Reveals Why He Voted For Jag Bains 
          

Cameron also revealed that the reason he voted for Jag Bains to win Big Brother 25 instead of Matt was because &#34;he was absolutely hands down—between the two of them—the better player, the most deserving. I believe that he had the most control over his game. I believe that he had the most planning opportunity.&#34; He added that although Matt &#34;definitely came through&#34; with competitions and &#34;the execution of the plans,&#34; &#34;Jag walked the whole thing home. He knew piece by piece exactly what he wanted to do.&#34; Cameron was &#34;honored&#34; he got to play Big Brother alongside Jag.





 

Cameron deserved to win America&#39;s Favorite Player. He brought entertainment and chaos to Big Brother 25 and played the game fearlessly. He often said that he wanted to have fun, which is exactly what he ended up doing. As a Big Brother superfan, Cameron played strategically. However, he never really had any true allies in the game, so it was hard for him to pull off executing his plans. Early in the game, there were times when it seemed that Cameron was the only one who was actually playing. It might have shocked him to win America&#39;s Favorite Player, but did not come as a surprise to his many fans who supported him throughout the game.

While Cirie is very popular because of her four Survivor stints and winning The Traitors season 1, Cameron has a love for Big Brother that Cirie doesn&#39;t share. His enthusiasm for the game was apparent. He was also a competition beast, while Cirie didn&#39;t win any competitions during her time in the game. Fans recognized this and voted accordingly. It would be exciting to see Cameron return in a legends season, in which every houseguest shared his passion for the game. Cameron has established himself as a Big Brother icon, and hopefully the new America&#39;s Favorite Player will play the game again in the near future.
