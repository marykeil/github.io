## Literature Review

Moriah Plath surprises her followers by unveiling her latest hair makeover. The Welcome To Plathville star no longer sports a blonde hair color.




Welcome To Plathville star Moriah Jasper Plath has changed her appearance with a new hairstyle. The 21-year-old Cairo resident first debuted on the show in season 1. She lived with her family then and wasn’t part of any major drama. Moriah’s journey began in the later seasons when she moved out of her parental home to pursue her music career. She befriended her brother’s wife, Olivia Plath, and became a prominent figure on the show. Unfortunately, her relationship with her sister-in-law worsened due to personal issues. Moriah accused Olivia of stealing her music proceeds, which also impacted her relationship with her brother, Ethan Plath.




Moriah has been working on her music career over the last few months. She has been learning more and embracing her singer persona with confidence. Recently, the rising star posted a few pictures from the recording session of her new song. She captioned the post, “dear me, sincerely you,” teasing what her followers can expect from her upcoming piece.


 

Moriah didn’t just flaunt her song but also showed off her new hair makeover. The popular Welcome To Plathville star posted a few close-up shots of herself showing that she now rocks a blonde high bun with dark highlights. She also sported a dark red lipstick that complimented her new hairstyle.

A social media user commented, “ur beautiful and can achieve whatever ur heart desires,” adding that the reality TV star should stay close to her family as she pursues her dreams. Another user wrote, “you look in you’re pure happiest in these photos,” stating that the Welcome To Plathville star should keep doing what she loves. Many fans also shared their compliments for Moriah’s hair makeover. Someone even wrote, “your new hairstyle is exceptional. It really compliments your career as a singer.” The fan added that Moriah’s new hair makeover makes her look like a true professional.

Seeing Moriah thrive and reach her goals as a musician is great. She has struggled a lot over the years due to her family issues. Therefore, she deserves the happiness and success she has worked hard to achieve. Moriah’s past feud with Olivia was probably the worst time of her life. She liked her sister-in-law and bonded with her over their mutual artistic interests. However, things worsened when Olivia allegedly stole the proceeds from Moriah’s music. The two ladies clashed numerous times and never got along again. Thankfully, the Olivia rivalry didn’t permanently ruin Moriah’s relationship with her brother, Ethan.




Moriah is slowly learning to become a better singer every day. She started at a pretty amateur level. However, she has since grown a lot and become a professional. Moriah has been experimenting with her hair over the years. However, the high bun suits her new look for her new persona. Moriah’s latest look seems inspired by a retro era. Her bright red lipstick, dark outfit, and blonde hair make her look like she has traveled into the present from the past. Moriah understands now that a music career calls for experimentation. The Welcome To Plathville cast member knows evolution is important to keep her fans engaged.
