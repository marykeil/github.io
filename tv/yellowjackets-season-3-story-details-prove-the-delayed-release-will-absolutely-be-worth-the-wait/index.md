## Literature Review

New and emerging details about the storyline of season 3 of Yellowjackets will make the extended time between the seasons worth the wait.




What we already know about the Yellowjackets story proves that the wait until 2025 will absolutely be worth it. Ever since the second season of the hit Showtime drama ended in late May 2023, fans have been clamoring for any piece of news for when the follow-up season may be released. Updates from the cast in recent days have confirmed that Yellowjackets season 3 will release in 2025 and will be treacherous, even if fans have to wait slightly longer to see it.




The smash hit on Showtime created by Ashley Lyle and Bart Nickerson follows a group of high school girls and their coaches who survive a plane crash in remote Canada while they are on the way to a soccer tournament. Bridging timelines in both the crash year of 1996 and 2021 after some of the girls have returned from the wilderness, Yellowjackets has proved to be one of the more popular horror and mystery-box shows on television. After a dramatic end to Yellowjackets season 2, the next set of episodes promises to be even more heart-stopping.



Both seasons of Yellowjackets are available to stream on the Paramount&#43; with Showtime service.





 Yellowjackets Season 3 Story Teases Suggest The Delay Will Be Worth It 
          




With the Yellowjackets cast and show-runners now making plenty of public appearances after the pair of Hollywood work stoppages, they are beginning to comment on what to expect from the third season. When Entertainment Tonight asked Samantha Hanratty (young Misty) on the red carpet at the Emmys what to expect in Yellowjackets season 3, she said to expect a &#34;meltdown&#34; of a season. That could have a double meaning of the winter fading away, but also the melting away of the remaining sanity of the girls.

Steven Kreuger (Coach Ben) had a much more horrific prediction for the upcoming season. He recently spoke at the Emmys and predicted that season 3 would be the &#34;wildest, bloodiest season&#34; of the show so far. While the writing process is currently underway, the cast is preparing for a dramatic turn.

One thing is already known for season 3, which is that the remaining Yellowjackets will have to try and survive after the cabin they were living in burned to the ground. The arsonist who burned their shelter is presently unknown, but this might be the event that tips the girls bordering on cannibalism over the edge. The tease that was shown in season 1 with the girls as feral survivors might finally come to fruition as food disappears and it becomes harder for the survivors to stay alive.






 Yellowjackets Season 3&#39;s Release Update Makes 2025 Even Bigger 
          

The anticipation for Yellowjackets is certainly heightening with the latest news and updates from the cast and creators, but it&#39;s far from the only show releasing in 2025 that is getting massive amounts of hype. Many shows that would have debuted in 2024 were delayed to the following year due to the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes that lasted from early summer until mid-fall. In addition to Yellowjackets on Showtime, many others are eagerly anticipated.

HBO might dominate the 2025 landscape with flagship shows like Last of Us, White Lotus, Euphoria, and a Sex in the City spin-off slated to appear. In addition to those, the long-awaited It prequel series, Welcome to Derry, will debut in 2025. It is expected that the Marvel Cinematic Universe will dip their toes back into the scripted series water after limited 2024 releases when Daredevil: Born Again releases in 2025. Each of these - plus many more - join Yellowjackets in what could be one of the best years of television in recent memory.
