## Literature Review
Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season is one of the most memorable anime ever, for good and bad reasons.




Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 adapted one of the most critically acclaimed shonen manga arcs in recent times, the Shibuya Incident, and despite being marred by controversies, this season of the anime more than lived up to the hype, exceeding even fans&#39; expectations.




Jujutsu Kaisen made its long-awaited return after more than 2 years since the wildly successful first season. Airing from July 6, 2023, to December 28, 2023, the second season was split into two parts: the first 5 episodes comprising the Hidden Inventory arc and the rest of the 18 episodes dedicated to the highly anticipated Shibuya Incident arc. The first part was definitely entertaining, showcasing Gojo and Geto&#39;s emotional and tragic past while introducing awesome characters and villains. The Shibuya Incident Arc, however, is what fans were waiting for, being considered the best arc in Jujutsu Kaisen.

                  Every Jujutsu Kaisen Arc Ranked From Worst to Best   After being serialized for over 5 years Jujutsu Kaisen has a variety of arcs, all of which are great but some of which are better than others.    


 The Plot Is The Backbone Of The Shibuya Incident Arc 

 




There are very few storylines as chaotic as that of the Shibuya Incident Arc. The financial district of Tokyo was in total mayhem, and on a holiday that was meant to be joyous, thousands were killed, and many more lives ruined, all to seal away Gojo Satoru. Led by Geto, the disaster curses and curse users join together to take down the strongest sorcerer alive, but the nearby sorcerers that constitute the main characters find out about the plot and fight back. With many battles taking place, and each one as exciting as the other, the Shibuya Incident arc was the push that Jujutsu Kaisen needed to be included in the discussion of the best modern anime.

The pure chaos that ensued changed Japan forever. Gojo&#39;s sealing rained down endless curses on humanity, Sukuna&#39;s Domain Expansion obliterated everything in sight, Mahito brutally took down fan-favorite characters, Geto ushered in a new age of Jujutsu similar to that of the Heian Era, and the most powerful curses were all taken down in one night. From planes dropping from the sky, buildings being leveled, trains being thrown around like toys, a river of blood soaking the streets, and explosions going off in multiple areas, Shibuya was definitely the most dangerous place on Earth on October 31st.






A third season of Jujutsu Kaisen has been announced that will cover the Culling Games arc following the season&#39;s finale.






 The Boundaries Of Animation Were Pushed Further Than Ever - But At What Price? 
         

Week after week, fans were treated to some of the most high-quality episodes in recent anime history. Furthermore, art and animation styles varied, which kept fans guessing, but every episode had in common the stellar quality that was the talk of the anime community multiple times throughout the season&#39;s run. Although both seasons 1 and 2 had great animation, they are a far cry from each other, which can be explained by the dramatic change of staff. Nonetheless, the Shibuya Incident arc&#39;s animation came at a steep price, and controversies exploded surrounding the intense workload forced upon the employees.




What makes Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s level of animation even more impressive is the time constraints the animators had to work with, sometimes having a few hours to complete the episode before it aired. MAPPA&#39;s cruel treatment of the passionate and hard-working animators quickly became known around the world due to the employees venting out their frustration online. Despite all the controversies, however, the staff kept working, and they consistently put out some of the best work of 2-D animation seen in recent years. Still, the debate sparked by MAPPA&#39;s working condition will hopefully not end here, and fans can only hope that season 3 will not be built on the same practices.



 1 To 1 Adaptation And Great Additions 
         

The Shibuya Incident arc has some of the most iconic manga panels in modern years, and fans are more relieved than ever that the anime did them justice. The anime adaptation of the Hidden Inventory arc experimented with Gojo&#39;s &#34;I Alone Am The Honored One&#34; scene, leaving fans with a bad taste. Fortunately, the mistake was not repeated, with scenes such as Sukuna&#39;s flame arrow, Itadori&#39;s &#34;I Am You&#34; scene, and Todo&#39;s appearance being perfectly replicated, with the same art style and angling as Gege Akutami&#39;s manga.




As much as the animators were faithfully following the map laid out in the source material, they also had creative freedom to enhance the experience. Todo Aoi got an incredible send-off during the battle with Mahito, which wasn&#39;t present in the manga. Miwa&#39;s emotional moment with Mechamaru was prolonged and made even sadder. Sukuna and Mahoraga&#39;s destructive fight featured an Easter egg that mocked Mappa&#39;s management of the production. The staff took a risk in putting their unique twists in the arc, and it paid off massively with the additions improving the story even further.



 Majestic Sound Design And Incredible Voice Acting 
         

Although sound design does fall under production, Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s use of sound deserves its own discussion. The masterful use and timing of music forcefully evoked the desired emotions from watchers. The eerily silence used in multiple scenes, such as Gojo&#39;s sealing and Itadori&#39;s awakening, sent shivers down the viewer&#39;s spine. The original soundtrack perfectly complimented each character&#39;s personality, such as Sukuna&#39;s theme song displaying his all-mighty power and evil. Cinema-level sound design was implemented throughout, which makes sense, since talented composers such as Yoshimasa Terui and the sound director of Naruto Shippuden, Yasunori Ebina, were recruited.





 

The voice actors were also a huge reason why the season was so well-received. In an arc that featured heartbreaking deaths, shocking plot twists, and exciting moments, the voice actors were crucial in conveying the characters&#39; emotions. Junya Enoki, the voice behind Yuji Itadori, and Nobunaga Shimazaki, the voice actor of Mahito, were absolutely brilliant and were the highlight of episode #20. Kenjiro Tsuda gave Nanami the proper send-off he needed.



 Memorable and Evil Villains That Challenged The Main Heroes 
         

Although the season saw great performances from heroes, such as Gojo, Itadori, Megumi, and others, the villains were the true champions of the arc. The strongest cursed spirits and curse users gathered to kill, destroy, and antagonize the humans there. They didn&#39;t stop there though, as the villains were so bloodthirsty they started fighting each other, most notably Sukuna obliterating Jogo and Mahoraga, and Toji hunting down anyone he deemed strong. Mahito&#39;s evil actions changed Itadori, and the series as a whole forever. With the death of many heroes and villains, Jujutsu Kaisen has the opportunity to introduce new characters to usher in the new arc, and the final episodes did just that, reintroducing Yuta Okkotsu and Yuki Tsukumo, and Sukuna&#39;s loyal servant Uraume.




Everything that makes Jujutsu Kaisen&#39;s second season a masterpiece has a common denominator: the staff. Through terrible deadlines and poor pay, they have managed to keep fans entertained for 6 months straight and gave them a glorious 23 episodes that will not be forgotten soon. From the animators, musicians, color artists, and sound designers to the episode directors, this season wouldn&#39;t have been possible without their tireless hard work, and fans should be aware of whom their gratitude and praise should be directed towards: the employees who elevated Jujutsu Kaisen season 2 to one of the best shōnen anime seasons of all time.
