# Why Sutton Stracke Might Be To Blame For Lisa Rinna s RHOBH Exit


## SUMMARY 



  Lisa Rinna&#39;s departure from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills may have been triggered by her feud with Sutton Stracke over their gala attendance.   Lisa&#39;s husband, Harry Hamlin, blamed Sutton for Lisa&#39;s decision to leave the show, claiming that Sutton insisted she paid for their spot at the event.   Despite the drama, Sutton initially expressed sadness over Lisa leaving the show but later revealed that she would have liked to fight Lisa if given the chance.

## Literature Review
RHOBH icon Lisa Rinna left the popular Bravo series. Her husband, Harry Hamlin, revealed the possible reason why she chose to give up her diamond. 




Lisa Rinna gave up her diamond ahead of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13, and while signs have pointed to her feud with Kathy Hilton being the reason why, Sutton Stracke may have triggered the exit. Lisa, who was introduced to Real Housewives fans in 2014, has been involved in her fair share of arguments since RHOBH season 5. From her infamous showdown with Kyle Richards&#39; sister Kim in Amsterdam, to the public demise of her and Denise Richards&#39; 20-year friendship, Lisa has never been one to keep her opinions quiet on one of the best reality TV shows. While Lisa is nowhere to be found on RHOBH season 13, there&#39;s still curiosity regarding why she left the show.




Naturally, it didn&#39;t take long for Lisa to run into problems with her co-stars, especially Sutton, on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 12. Lisa and Sutton, who attended the Elton John AIDS Foundation Gala in 2019, couldn&#39;t agree on how Lisa scored an invitation. Sutton claimed that she bought Lisa&#39;s table, which Lisa vehemently denied. Although Diana and Erika criticized Sutton&#39;s quest for the truth, Sutton made Garcelle Beauvais happy when she produced emails that confirmed she&#39;d paid for Lisa&#39;s table. Months after Lisa and Sutton rehashed the event in front of Bravo&#39;s cameras, Lisa announced that RHOBH season 12 would be her last stint as a housewife. It&#39;s unclear why Lisa ultimately decided to part ways, but Sutton may have played an unintentional hand.

While Lisa and Kathy&#39;s feud dominated headlines throughout 2022, it was actually Lisa and Sutton&#39;s public showdown that ultimately appeared to trigger Lisa&#39;s departure from the show. When Lisa&#39;s husband Harry Hamlin attended the Sundance Film Festival on January 21, a source (as per Page Six) overheard him discussing Lisa&#39;s decision to leave, which he blamed on Sutton&#39;s insistence that she paid for their spot at Elton John&#39;s event. “[Lisa] might still be on the show had Sutton not said that,” Harry reportedly said. He also claimed that IMDb gifted them tickets, rather than Sutton, adding, “She might still be on the show, but the audience believed Sutton.”



 What Sutton Stracke Has Said About Lisa Rinna&#39;s RHOBH Exit 
          

Although Sutton may have had a hand in Lisa&#39;s final Real Housewives season, the fan favorite housewife said that Lisa would be missed ahead of RHOBH season 13. &#34;I think we&#39;re all sad that Lisa&#39;s leaving,&#34; Sutton told E! News on January 7, 2023, although she also predicted, &#34;I don&#39;t think this is the last we&#39;ll see from her.&#34; Despite her initial kind words, however, Sutton later told Page Six that if she could fight any of her RHOBH co-stars, her first opponent would be Lisa. &#34;I would like to get Lisa, but she is gone now,&#34; Sutton revealed, and added, &#34;I think Lisa needs to enjoy her time and reflect and be quiet.”




Lisa&#39;s exit from RHOBH wasn&#39;t a surprise, in light of her controversies, but it does create a sense of curiosity. For example, the contents of Lisa&#39;s mysterious envelope at the RHOBH season 12 reunion are still unknown, and it may have contained documents related to the gala. Also, RHOBH star Lisa may have been fired behind-the-scenes. Regardless of the truth about Lisa&#39;s departure, rumors swirled for months that her former nemesis, Lisa Vanderpump, would reprise her role on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 13. However, this prediction never came to fruition.
