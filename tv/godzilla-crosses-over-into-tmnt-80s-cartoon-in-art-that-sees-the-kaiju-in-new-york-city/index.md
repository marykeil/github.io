## Literature Review
Godzilla crosses over into the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&#39; world in art that sees the famous kaiju in the New York City of the &#39;80s cartoon.




Godzilla crosses over into the world of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in art depicting the famous kaiju stomping around the setting of the &#39;80s cartoon. The giant monster is best known for appearing in Japan within his franchise, often dueling other monsters in city settings. Meanwhile, the beloved cartoon turtles call New York City their home, stopping crime from the many villains that threaten to destroy it.




Now, @mista__jonz has created fan art featuring Godzilla stomping around New York City, the setting of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &#39;80s cartoon.


 

The artist says this particular version of the King of the Monsters was inspired by 2001&#39;s Godzilla, Mother and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack. The Channel 6 building and a blimp reading &#34;Turtles&#34; in the background establish the crossover setting.



Godzilla has appeared in New York City before, in the critically panned 1998 American remake. The monster in the film was later rebranded as &#34;Zilla&#34; by Toho.





 Could Godzilla Beat The TMNT? 
          




Godzilla Minus One&#39;s incredible box office success has led to a surge in popularity for the more destructive rendition of the giant monster. A similar version appears in the movie inspiring the TMNT crossover art, indicating just how dangerous he can be in some interpretations. There&#39;s no doubt that, if he did show up in the &#39;80s cartoon universe, he would prove a challenge for the Turtles to take down.

However, the ninja team is no stranger to extradimensional threats, with General Krang of Dimension X acting as one of their most prominent antagonists. At the same time, the Turtles have rarely fought a monster of Godzilla&#39;s magnitude, last doing so at the end of Mutant Mayhem. The only reason they were able to win was with the help of other citizens of New York. If they were to do battle with the famed kaiju, they may not be able to do it alone.

                  Godzilla’s 6 Best Fights In Toho’s Movies, Ranked   Over the years, Godzilla has been involved in a long list of exciting kaiju battles. Here are Godzilla&#39;s six best monster fights in Toho&#39;s movies.    




Despite the difficulty, though, the Turtles may be able to find some creative solution to beating the monster without any outside help. However, the Godzilla franchise has proven the kaiju to be a powerful force, making his appearance in the &#39;80s cartoon a threat to all of New York City. Given how much damage the monster could do, it seems Godzilla would be the most likely victor when taking on the TMNT.
