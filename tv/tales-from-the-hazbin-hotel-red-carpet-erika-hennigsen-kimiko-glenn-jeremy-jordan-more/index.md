## Literature Review
Screen Rant attended a red carpet in NYC to celebrate the premiere of Hazbin Hotel and speak with stars like Keith David about the new series.




Over four years after the original pilot was uploaded to YouTube, the raunchy musical cartoon Hazbin Hotel is now a fully-fledged series. After the independently-created first episode became a viral sensation, it was picked up by A24 to produce its first season in conjunction with Amazon MGM Studios. The new show stars a mix of talented screen and theater actors, like In the Heights&#39; Stephanie Beatriz, The Princess and the Frog&#39;s Keith David, and Erika Henningsen, who played the role of Cady Heron in the Mean Girls Broadway production until 2020.




Created by Vivienne Medrano, the series follows Charlie Morningstar (Henningsen), the daughter of King Lucifer and princess of Hell. The titular Hazbin Hotel is the brainchild of Charlie and her loving partner Vaggie (Beatriz), aiming to provide a place for sinners to be rehabilitated and get into Heaven. This would save them from the annual extermination inflicted upon Hell&#39;s residents by the angels to avoid overpopulation, but the two face pushback from both their eccentric residents, like adult-film star Angel Dust, and figures from Heaven and Hell who want to maintain the status quo.

Screen Rant interviewed several of Hazbin Hotel&#39;s stars on the red carpet during the show&#39;s New York City premiere earlier this week to discuss voicing eccentric and extreme characters, the art of adult animation, and the most standout behind-the-scenes moments.





 Cast &amp; Crew Talk Hazbin Hotel 
  

Vivienne Medrano - Creator &amp; Executive Producer
Screen Rant: Since the original pilot, which took off like wildfire, there have been some changes to things like the character design. Can you talk about what that process was like deciding what wanted some updating and what you wanted to leave the same?


Vivienne Medrano: I am kind of an ever-changing person. Even during making the pilot, there were certain changes I wanted to make to the characters. But obviously, once you&#39;re a certain amount of time in, it&#39;s just - I mean, that would kill everybody to redo all that in animation. So there were already changes I knew I wanted to make to the characters.
So when we went to series, it was simplifying them so that it&#39;d be easier for the outsourced studio, just like anyone touching them. But also, there were just changes I had authentically already wanted to make. So it felt very natural to just adjust them. And nobody asked me to, I just was like, &#34;No, I&#39;m going to.&#34;





What was it like to revisit it with a bigger budget and a bigger team behind it? Did that change things for you?


Vivienne Medrano: It definitely was a different process. I learned so much about how to work with a different studio and kind of the collaboration, and working with an outsource studio and all these things that I&#39;d never experienced before. And I loved it, I learned so much. And I actually was able to bring a lot of the original people who made the pilot on board as well, as well as my studio. So it feels like it was just such a amazing learning experience.


What other animated pieces of media do you find yourself taking the most inspiration from? Either aesthetically or humor-wise or anything like that.


Vivienne Medrano: I have been influenced by so many things. I&#39;ve been influenced a lot by Seth Rogen comedies. And I also grew up - my first adult series was South Park, so it changed something in me. And from then on I was really invested in adult comedy, in animation.
But it&#39;s also not really a world where a lot of women exist. So I feel like all my influences are very, very male-centric, and I just wanted to bring that in with my voice and my want for more representation and LGBT stories and things like that. So yeah, it just felt like a fun space to be in.





There&#39;s a huge fan community around the show; we saw some downstairs. I&#39;m curious if when you were planning out this season and even next season, do you ever find yourself taking influence from fan ideas, fan art, fan fiction, or?


Vivienne Medrano: Well, we can&#39;t really look at the things that would influence the story or change it or anything. But one thing that&#39;s really cool about Hazbin is that I&#39;ve had it mapped out since we were working on the pilot. We worked on the pilot for about two years, the original one on YouTube, and during that time I was working on pitching it as a series, so I really dived into the story.
So the story has been low-key kind of figured out for years. So what&#39;s nice about it is that that allows me to really see - I&#39;ll see the fans, and they&#39;ll be pretty close, and I&#39;ll be like, &#34;Oh wow.&#34; It didn&#39;t take much for them to kind of put the pieces together of who these characters are.
And I feel like as the story goes on, it&#39;s going to be even more like that. People are going to be figuring it out, but I&#39;m just like, &#34;Nope, it&#39;s set.&#34; So hopefully people are along for the ride, but I love it. The fan energy fuels us in terms of how much we - it&#39;s hard working on a show, and so seeing how much people love it and how much we know people are going to look at it and enjoy it and absorb everything, it makes our jobs easier because we&#39;re like, &#34;We&#39;re not doing this for nothing.&#34;
