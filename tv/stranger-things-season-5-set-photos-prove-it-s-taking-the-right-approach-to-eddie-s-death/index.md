## Literature Review
Stranger Things season 5 set photos have already surfaced, and they prove the final episodes are taking the right approach to Eddie Munson’s death.




Stranger Things season 5 has taken a massive step toward becoming a reality, and if set photos are anything to judge by, the Netflix series&#39; final chapter is taking the right approach to Eddie Munson&#39;s death. Eddie became a fan-favorite Stranger Things character after making his entrance in season 4, and the leader of the Hellfire Club had many redeeming qualities. This became more apparent when he sacrificed himself to save his friends in the Upside Down, forcing viewers to bid farewell to the character just after they&#39;d gotten to know him.




Eddie&#39;s untimely demise took a toll on the Stranger Things crew, especially Dustin, who&#39;d found common ground with him as the fourth outing continued. The tragedy of Eddie&#39;s death was made worse by the fact that Hawkins blamed him for what unfolded at the end of Stranger Things season 4 rather than facing the reality of the supernatural. It looks as though this thread will continue into Stranger Things season 5, which means the show will fully address the impact of Eddie&#39;s death.



Stranger Things seasons 1-4 are currently streaming on Netflix.





 Stranger Things Season 5 Set Photos Reveal It Won&#39;t Gloss Over Eddie Munson&#39;s Death 
          

Just days after filming started, set photos from Stranger Things season 5 surfaced — and some reveal Eddie Munson&#39;s vandalized grave site. Shots of Gaten Matarazzo were shared to Twitter, and he&#39;s standing in front of a grave with the name &#34;Edward&#34; on it. The tombstone is covered with graffiti, and while it&#39;s hard to tell what it says — &#34;Burn in Hell,&#34; perhaps? — it&#39;s clear that Hawkins hasn&#39;t forgiven Eddie for the crimes they accused him of in season 4. Although this realization is upsetting for Eddie&#39;s friends and fans of the character, it highlights that Stranger Things isn&#39;t glossing over his death during its final season.




Stranger Things has a habit of introducing new characters and killing them off, and their deaths aren&#39;t always felt when the series picks up again. Given Eddie&#39;s popularity among viewers and importance to the main gang, he deserves more than a quickly forgotten arc. While he certainly doesn&#39;t deserve Hawkins&#39; hatred, the fact that people are still thinking about him proves that Eddie will have a strong impact on the events of Stranger Things season 5. It also opens the door for redemption, even if he isn&#39;t alive to see it.


 



 Why Stranger Things Can&#39;t Make Light Of Eddie&#39;s Season 4 Sacrifice 
          




Stranger Things can&#39;t make light of Eddie&#39;s season 4 sacrifice, so it&#39;s promising that references to the character are already cropping up. Although Barb, Bob, and Billy all met tragic fates over the course of Stranger Things&#39; four seasons, Eddie was the first person whose death impacted all the younger characters so significantly. He&#39;s also the only one to receive so much attention from Hawkins, and it&#39;d be a shame if the Netflix series left Eddie&#39;s reputation in shambles after his heroic farewell. Stranger Things season 5 needs to redeem Eddie after the fact, proving to Hawkins that he isn&#39;t the person they&#39;ve made him out to be.
