# Jonathan Frakes Explains The Reason Why Star Trek Picard Finale s Poker Scene Worked 


## SUMMARY 



  Jonathan Frakes explains why the poker scene in Star Trek: Picard season 3 hit home with fans - it allowed the cast to ad-lib and showcase their real-life personalities.   Terry Matalas took a risk by letting the actors improvise during the poker game, resulting in a looser and more authentic scene.   The poker scene resonated because it reminded people of the end of Star Trek: The Next Generation and made viewers feel like they were among friends.

## Literature Review
Star Trek: Picard season 3 ended with a crowd-pleasing poker scene that brought the house down, and Jonathan Frakes reflects on why it worked so well.




Jonathan Frakes breaks down why Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s climactic poker scene resonated so much with audiences. Picard season 3 closed the book on the story of Star Trek: The Next Generation in a rousing fashion by giving Admiral Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and the crew of the USS Enterprise-D one more poker game at Ten Forward. Writer and director Terry Matalas filmed 45 minutes of the TNG icons improvising their poker game, and a few minutes of it is available as a special feature on Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s Blu-ray.




TrekTalks 3&#39;s Star Trek: Picard season 3 panel reunited Jonathan Frakes, Jeri Ryan, Brent Spiner, Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Todd Stashwick, Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut, and showrunner Terry Matalas to raise over $108,000 for the Hollywood Food Coalition. The freewheeling conversation moderated by Jonathan Del Arco and Kayla Lacovino touched upon Picard season 3&#39;s closing poker game, and Frakes explains how Matalas allowing the actors to improvise and be themselves fused their characters with their real-life personalities, which is why the moment is so resonant. Check out Frakes&#39; quote and watch the Picard season 3 panel at the 5:04:45 time stamp below:


The reason the poker scene reverberated so beautifully - obviously it reminded people of the end of Next Gen - but the reason it worked is because Terry took the chance to have us ad-lib, which we had never done. And he spent a long time with a lot of cameras just having us play poker and take the piss out of each other. It got looser and looser and looser. Some of those actions are what are in Terry’s cut. And it’s why, I believe, we, as fans, felt, ‘Oh my God, these are my friends!’ It was because Terry gave us the time to cross the lines so that Data and Brent were both playing poker. It was very clever and very, very effective.






 

                  Star Trek Picard Cast &amp; Character Guide: All 3 Seasons   Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s cast includes several new characters and the return of some of the biggest names and iconic characters in Star Trek.    


 Will Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s Characters Return? 
Fans want Star Trek: Legacy
         

Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s finale was a poignant farewell to the cast of Star Trek: The Next Generation, but audiences still hope to see more of them. Picard&#39;s ending set up a spinoff about the &#39;next Next Generation&#39; aboard the USS Enterprise-G commanded by Captain Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) that could potentially have some TNG characters appear. However, that series dubbed Star Trek: Legacy isn&#39;t in development, and this seems to put any comeback of TNG&#39;s icons to a halt.




Patrick Stewart has called for one more movie about Jean-Luc Picard that he would like Jonathan Frakes to direct, but that is merely theoretical thus far. TNG characters could potentially pop up as cameos or guest stars in the animated Star Trek: Lower Decks or Star Trek: Prodigy, but if that does happen, it may not be the same iterations of the characters whose stories continued in Star Trek: Picard season 3. If Star Trek: Picard season 3&#39;s poker game is the last time audiences see the crew of the USS Enterprise-D, it would still be a perfect last image of them, but there&#39;s still a desire by fans and the actors to see Star Trek: The Next Generation&#39;s characters&#39; stories go on.



Star Trek: Picard season 3 is available to stream on Paramount&#43;.
