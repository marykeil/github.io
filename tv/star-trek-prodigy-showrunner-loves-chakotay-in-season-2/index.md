## Literature Review
Showrunner Kevin Hageman loves Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran) in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2, as an improvement on Chakotay in Voyager.




Star Trek: Prodigy showrunner Kevin Hageman says he loves what season 2 does with Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s Captain Chakotay (Robert Beltran). Prodigy season 1 ends with Admiral Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) taking on most of the USS Protostar&#39;s young crew as warrant officers on a newly-adopted mission to rescue Chakotay from an alternate future after a new temporal anomaly carrying Chakotay&#39;s distress signal is detected by Starfleet. Janeway&#39;s determination to succeed promises Chakotay&#39;s inevitable return, but what will Chakotay be like when he&#39;s finally found?




Kevin Hageman believes Chakotay is even better in Star Trek: Prodigy than he was in Star Trek: Voyager. Appearing with his brother, Dan Hageman, on Virtual Trek Con&#39;s Star Trek and Chill podcast, Kevin shares his hopes that Prodigy&#39;s audience will enjoy watching Chakotay&#39;s Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 storyline as much as they had making it. Read Kevin&#39;s quote below and check out the video from Star Trek and Chill on YouTube, starting at 22:29.


I also wanted to say, I love what we do with Chakotay. Like, I love what we do. I think it’s totally not what you’re expecting, and it&#39;s awesome. I love it. Robert is fantastic... I&#39;ve already had, there&#39;s been females who&#39;ve watched [season 1]... This is an animated show. and they&#39;re like, &#34;He looks pretty good.&#34;... I love what we do with him more than what we&#39;ve seen in Voyager. I hope you agree.



 




                  Everything We Know About Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2   Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will stream on Netflix after the animated series was canceled by Paramount&#43;, with 20 brand new episodes coming in 2024.    


 The Reunion Between Admiral Kathryn Janeway and Captain Chakotay is Highly Anticipated 
Will Janeway and Chakotay Get Together in Prodigy season 2?
         

Kevin and Dan Hagemans&#39; eagerness to share Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 with viewers continues to build anticipation for the long-awaited reunion between Admiral Kathryn Janeway and Captain Chakotay. In Star Trek: Prodigy season 1, Chakotay is only seen in flashbacks and recordings, but those scenes punctuate Chakotay&#39;s importance to the narrative as the previous captain of the USS Protostar, and more saliently, as an important person in Janeway&#39;s life. When Janeway does find Chakotay -- and she will, because she&#39;s Janeway -- it will undoubtedly be a poignant and perhaps pivotal moment in Prodigy&#39;s overall story.




Janeway and Chakotay&#39;s emotional reunion could pave the way for a possible romance between Chakotay and Janeway in Star Trek: Prodigy season 2. It would be a long time coming for fans of the pairing, after Star Trek: Voyager&#39;s failure to follow through on the romantic tension between Janeway and Chakotay. While Kevin Hageman didn&#39;t confirm whether sparks will fly when Voyager&#39;s commanding officers reunite, he did place himself resolutely in the camp that favors pairing Chakotay with Janeway, and Dan Hageman easily agreed. Whether romantic or not, Chakotay and Janeway&#39;s impending Star Trek: Prodigy reunion is definitely one to look forward to.



Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 is streaming on Netflix. Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 premieres on Netflix in 2024.
