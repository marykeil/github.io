 Mike&#39;s Restoration Business Is Hugely Successful 
          

In 2023, Mike is 67 years old and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon. He owns a five-acre lot, including all the 400-plus cars in his collection. Mike realizes that he owns more than he could possibly fix, so he is looking for a savvy investor to take over. Until then, he keeps working on the cars with his team as he pursues his passion for vintage car restoration. His friends and family worry that he often &#34;fall[s] in love with the car they’re working to restore.&#34; They believe this can cloud Mike’s judgment and cause him to sometimes sell the car for less than he spent on the restoration to give people their dream vehicles.






 Mike&#39;s Wife Forbids Cars From Their Farm 
          

Mike doesn&#39;t talk much about his family on the show or keep an active social media account, but we know he has a wife and kids. His wife, however, does not share his love for vintage car restorations and forbids him from keeping them on their farm. His son Connor is a main member of the cast on the show, yet there is no information available about his other children.

Mike is an interesting character. His hippie appearance and experienced car knowledge make him a likable and exciting main character for this reality TV show. Watch the first three seasons of the History Channel&#39;s Rust Valley Restorers on Netflix to learn more about Mike Hall and his crew.
