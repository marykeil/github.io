## Literature Review
The popular Carol Burnett Show spinoff Mama&#39;s Family was one of the defining sitcoms of the 1980s, but which of the show&#39;s cast is still alive today?




The popular sitcom Mama&#39;s Family was one of the defining series of the 1980s, but which of the show&#39;s cast members are still alive today? Devised as a spinoff of the recurring sketch &#34;The Family&#34; on The Carol Burnett Show, Mama&#39;s Family further explored the hilarious world of &#34;Mama&#34; Harper (Vicki Lawrence) and her wacky kinfolk. Picking up right where the characters left off from their sketch origins, Mama&#39;s Family introduced more of the Harper clan and even saw the return of popular cast members from The Carol Burnett Show. All told, Mama&#39;s Family had an impressive six-season run and was an even bigger hit in syndication.

Lawrence, the sketch&#39;s original star, was on hand for all six seasons of the sitcom&#39;s run, and she was the glue that held the cast together through massive changes. Though Mama&#39;s Family was canceled after its first two seasons, the series found immense popularity in syndication and was revived for four more years. As is usually the case with the most rewatchable sitcoms, Mama&#39;s Family featured a strong mix of full-time cast members and one-off guest stars who helped to spice up each episode. In the end, though, it was the misadventures of the main Harper family that kept viewers tuning in for more.



Three seasons of Mama&#39;s Family are available to stream on PlutoTV, but the entire series is available to purchase from Amazon, AppleTV, Vudu, and GooglePlay.





 Vicki Lawrence (1949 - ) 
         




The titular &#34;Mama&#34; of the show&#39;s title, Vicki Lawrence reprised her role from The Carol Burnett Show as the sassy and wisecracking Thelma &#34;Mama&#34; Harper. Lawrence&#39;s big break came as a member of The Carol Burnett Show, and her years as a part of the cast of Mama&#39;s Family was an extension of the earlier show&#39;s popularity. After Mama&#39;s Family Lawrence made sporadic guest appearances in other sitcoms and even had a recurring role as &#34;Mamaw&#34; Stewart on Hannah Montana. Vicki Lawrence is still very much alive and working on television today. Lawrence has continued to work into the 2020s on shows like Call Me Kat, and The Really Loud House, both in 2023.



 Beverly Archer (1948 - ) 
          

Starting from season 3 on, Beverly Archer played Iola Lucille Boylen, the Harper&#39;s kind but annoying neighbor who was always involved in the family&#39;s business. Following her nearly 100 episodes of Mama&#39;s Family, Archer continued to find steady work in various TV series throughout the &#39;80s and &#39;90s. Archer was most recognizable for her co-starring role on the TV series Major Dad where she played the no-nonsense Sgt. Alva Bricker. The actress worked in the industry until 2002 when she quietly retired from performing.






 Dorothy Lyman (1947 - ) 
          

Brought to life by Dorothy Lyman, Noami Oates Harper was Vinton&#39;s second wife who often clashed with Thelma over her &#34;gaudy&#34; lifestyle choices. Lyman didn&#39;t miss a beat after the cancelation of Mama&#39;s Family, and she continued to land TV roles throughout the &#39;90s and into the 2020s. Besides appearing in myriad TV shows, Lyman also landed a cameo role in the 2006 Martin Scorsese film The Departed. Lyman has continued to work in the 2020s, guest-starring in The Girl from Plainville. Lyman is also a producer and director. She produced and directed 75 episodes of Fran Drescher&#39;s The Nanny during its run.



 Allan Kayser (1963 - ) 
          




Played by Allan Kayser for the final four seasons of the show, Bubba Higgins was the rambunctious teenage son of Ed and Eunice Higgins who was left to stay with Thelma after his parents moved away. Besides his starring role in the 1986 horror film Night of the Creeps, Kayser&#39;s biggest role came as a member of the cast of Mama&#39;s Family. He continued to work sporadically in the decades following the show&#39;s cancelation and even appeared as Nicky&#39;s Dad in the Disney Channel original movie Double Teamed in 2002.

 Eric Brown (1964 - ) 
          

Eric Brown played Vinton &#34;Buzz&#34; Harper Jr., Vinton&#39;s son from a previous marriage who was often the most patient and accommodating member of the family. After departing the series after its first cancelation in 1984, Brown was cast in a few parts in films and TV throughout the &#39;80s and &#39;90s. His biggest role came as James in the cult classic horror film Waxwork in 1988, and his latest acting credit came in 1999 when he had a cameo role as an English teacher in the film Outside Providence. He also worked as an assistant director on some of the horror movies he appeared in and acted in television commercials.






 Karin Argoud (1960 - ) 
          

Throughout the show&#39;s first two seasons, Karin Argoud appeared in the cast of Mama&#39;s Family as Sonja Harper, the teenage daughter of Vinton from a previous marriage who was generally oblivious to the world around her. Mama&#39;s Family was Argoud&#39;s biggest role by far, though she did appear in single-episode stints on shows like Nash Bridges and had a cameo appearance in the irreverent 2001 comedy film Bartleby. In 2022, Karin Argoud appeared as Maria in the Hallmark original movie Love in the Limelight.



 Carol Burnett (1933 - ) 
         




With Mama&#39;s Family spinning out of The Carol Burnett Show, it makes sense that Burnett would have a role in the series. Burnett played Ellen Harper-Jackson, Thelma&#39;s antagonistic middle child, in the cast of Mama&#39;s Family. A comedy legend, Burnett is, of course, famous for her self-titled The Carol Burnett Show. Following Mama&#39;s Family, Burnett has worked steadily across film and TV, winning an Emmy for her role as Theresa Stemple in Mad About You. In recent years, Burnett has done voice work for franchises like Toy Story and Trolls. Not limited to comedy, in 2022, Burnett appeared in four episodes of Better Call Saul. In 2019, the Golden Globes awarded her with the first Carol Burnett Lifetime Achievement Award for her legacy in television.



 Ken Berry (1933 - 2018) 
          




Throughout the show&#39;s entire run, Ken Berry was part of the cast of Mama&#39;s Family as Vinton Harper, Thelma&#39;s youngest child who was immature for his age, and somewhat goofy. Ken Berry was a TV veteran by the time he landed his role on Mama&#39;s Family, and he only made a few on-screen appearances after the show went off the air. Berry starred in an episode of The Golden Girls in 1992 and played his final role in the ill-fated TV series Maggie Winters in 1999. Ken Berry passed away in 2018 at the age of 85.



 Harvey Korman (1927 - 2008) 
          

Also reprising his role from The Carol Burnett Show, Harvey Korman played Ed Higgins, Eunice&#39;s exasperated husband who kept quiet despite his numerous disagreements with the family. Besides his award-winning work with Burnett, Korman was also famous for his appearance in the hilarious Mel Brooks film Blazing Saddles in 1974. After departing the cast of Mama&#39;s Family in 1984, Korman mostly transitioned to vocal work and lent his voice to the 1994 live-action adaptation of The Flintstones. Korman continued to work into the early 2000s in various voice-over roles, and the former Mama&#39;s Family cast member passed away at the age of 81 in 2008.






 Rue McClanahan (1934 - 2010) 
         

Rue McClanahan played Frances Marie Crowley, the younger sister of Thelma whose uptight attitude often clashed with her sister&#39;s brazenness. McClanahan departed the show after her character&#39;s death in 1984, and she immediately landed her signature role as Blanche Devereaux in the wildly popular sitcom The Golden Girls in 1985. She also appeared in family shows like Boy Meets World and Safe Harbor in the &#39;90s and early 2000s. Besides reprising the role of Blanche in other comedy series, McClanahan would work sporadically in television and movies until her death in 2010 at the age of 76.

 Betty White (1922 - 2021) 
         




Joining the cast of Mama&#39;s Family sporadically throughout its run, Betty White played Ellen Harper-Jackson, Thelma&#39;s elitist sister who avoided her working-class family as much as possible. A television legend, White was already in her fifth decade in show business by the time she was cast in Mama&#39;s Family, and in 1985 she landed the role of Rose Nylund on The Golden Girls, the part she would be most famous for. Betty White&#39;s movie and TV roles continued up until 2019. She earned a whole new generation of fans thanks to movies like The Proposal, and the Mama&#39;s Family star passed away in 2021 at the age of 99.
