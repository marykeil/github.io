## Literature Review

The Valley is a new reality series recently announced by Bravo that is bringing back a few familiar faces from Vanderpump Rules. Here are the updates.




The Valley was recently confirmed by Bravo, with the new reality series bringing back several familiar faces. A spin-off of Vanderpump Rules, rumblings of the show started a couple of years back after several flop seasons. It was rumored that a majority of the Vanderpump Rules cast members would move over to this new show, seeing as most of them, at the time, lived in the Valley. However, now that Tom Schwartz and Katie Maloney are divorced and no longer living in the Valley, and Ariana Madix and Tom Sandoval are over and on their way out of the Valley, it only made sense for Bravo to go in a different direction. 




Even though none of the current Vanderpump Rules cast members are making the jump over to The Valley, the show is bringing back a few iconic former cast members. Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright are making their return to the small screen on The Valley after being fired from Vanderpump Rules almost four years ago. Kristen Doute will also be joining the cast after she was fired following her and Stassi Schroeder&#39;s admitting to filing a police report against Faith Stowers for a crime she did not commit. The Valley is a fresh start for some former cast members and a new chapter for their new castmates.
