  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Killers of the Flower Moon is Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s new 3.5 epic western, and the movie has a suitably epic cast, including Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s next movie is a 3.5-hour epic, and the Killers of the Flower Moon cast is just as epic to fill its behemoth runtime. The new western is based on the true story of the Oklahoma murders, in which members of the Osage tribe were murdered in the 1920s due to an oil dispute. This led to an investigation operated by Tom White for the BOI (soon to be FBI). Apple TV funded Killers of the Flower Moon with $200 million, and the production is on such a monumental scale. However, one of the most exciting elements of a new Scorsese movie is its cast, and Killers of the Flower Moon boasts an impressive ensemble led by longtime Martin Scorsese collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio.</p>
<p>Like many directors, Martin Scorsese is known to work with the same group of actors with each release, with a few changes to the roster here and there but the same few members at its core, and many regulars from his previous movies appear among the Killers of the Flower Moon cast. Nevertheless, with every new film, Scorsese picks up more trusted talents that he&rsquo;ll keep in mind for future roles. This happened with The Irishman&rsquo;s Jesse Plemons and Louis Cancelmi, who both appear in Killers of the Flower Moon. Scorsese also likes to cast complete unknowns, who quickly become huge actors shortly after. The Killers of the Flower Moon cast is an exciting amalgam of regular collaborators, up-and-comers, and Osage tribe first-time actors too.</p>
<pre><code>              Killers Of The Flower Moon True Story: The Osage Murders &amp; Biggest Changes Explained   The grisly true story of the Osage murders, the inspiration behind Martin Scorsese's star-studded Western crime epic Killers of the Flower Moon.   
</code></pre>
<p>Leonardo DiCaprio As Ernest Burkhart</p>
<p>Actor: Leonardo DiCaprio, 49, was born in Los Angeles, California in 1974, with him quickly becoming one of the most prominent and well-respected actors of the modern era. Starting out in TV, DiCaprio had his first breakout film role in 1993&rsquo;s This Boy&rsquo;s Life, and later in the year earned an Oscar nomination for What&rsquo;s Eating Gilbert Grape. DiCaprio has gone on to appear in films directed by some of the most legendary directors of all time, collaborating with Steven Spielberg on Catch Me If You Can, Quentin Tarantino on Once Upon A Time&hellip; in Hollywood, and Martin Scorsese on The Wolf of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: This Boy&rsquo;s Life (1993), What&rsquo;s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Romeo + Juliet (1996), Titanic (1997), Catch Me If You Can (2002), Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), Shutter Island (2010), Django Unchained (2012), The Great Gatsby (2013), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), The Revenant (2015), Once Upon a Time&hellip; in Hollywood (2019), Don&rsquo;t Look Up (2021), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: Leonardo DiCaprio plays Ernest Buckhart in the Killers of the Flower Moon cast, the husband of Mollie Burkhart and one of the main conspirators in the Osage Murders. As the nephew of William King Hale, Ernest had a major hand in the conspiracy, with Leonardo DiCaprio bringing the evil of the character to life.</p>
<p>Robert De Niro As William K. Hale</p>
<p>Actor: Robert De Niro, 80, was born in New York City, New York in 1947. De Niro&rsquo;s big break was in Scorsese&rsquo;s 1972 movie, Mean Streets, and quickly won his first Academy Award for playing Vito Corleone in The Godfather Part II. The actor often plays anti-heroes (Tax Driver) or immoral gangsters in ensembles casts filled with corrupt characters (Goodfellas, The Irishman), but playing the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo; is refreshingly new, and it&rsquo;s a testament to how great of an actor De Niro is that he&rsquo;s still surprising audiences over 50 years into his career.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: Mean Streets (1973), The Godfather Part II (1974), Taxi Driver (1976), New York, New York (1977), The Deer Hunter (1978), Raging Bull (1980), The King of Comedy (1982), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), Brazil (1985), The Untouchables (1987), Midnight Run (1988), Goodfellas (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Casino (1995), Heat (1995), Jackie Brown (1997), Meet the Parents (2000), Silver Linings Playbook (2012), Joker (2019), The Irishman (2019), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: Robert De Niro&rsquo;s Killers of the Flower Moon character is William K. Hale, the uncle of Ernest Burkhart and the ringleader of the Osage Murders conspiracy. Hale is the Killers of the Flower Moon&rsquo;s villain, which is rare for De Niro, but he is truly able to bring the villain to life.</p>
<p>Lily Gladstone As Mollie Burkhart</p>
<p>Actor: Lily Gladstone, 37, was born in Kalispell, Montana in 1986. Killers of the Flower Moon is Gladstone&rsquo;s breakthrough movie, as, until now, the actor had only featured in small independent films such as Certain Women and First Cow. The actor is a perfect choice to play Mollie, as Gladstone&rsquo;s heritage is a major part of most of her movie roles. Gladstone is best known for her work in television, as the actor has featured in a number of popular and prestige TV shows.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: Jimmy P: Psychotherapy of a Plains Indian (2012), Certain Women (2016), Room 104 (2017-2020), Billions (2019-2023), First Cow (2019), Reservation Dogs (2022-2023), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: Gladstone joins the Killers of the Flower Moon cast as Mollie Burkhart. Mollie is a native of the Osage Nation and her family is in danger when Americans discover oil on the tribal land. Mollie is the wife of Ernest Burkhart, with her husband shockingly attempting to kill her throughout the film.</p>
<p>Tantoo Cardinal As Lizzie Q</p>
<p>Actor: Tantoo Cardinal, 73, was born in Anzac, Alberta in 1950. Cardinal&rsquo;s breakthrough role was in 1990&rsquo;s epic western Dances with Wolves, in which she played Black Shawl. Just like Gladstone, Cardinal wears her indigenous heritage like a badge of honor, and instead of casting Hollywood actors in Native American roles, Scorsese cast the lesser-known Canadian actor in the role of Lizzie Q, making Killers of the Flower Moon more authentic and respectful to the true story.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: Loyalties (1986), Dances with Wolves (1990), Legends of the Fall (1994), Longmire (2015-2017), Godless (2017), Wind River (2017), Wendell &amp; Wild (2022), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023), Echo (2024).</p>
<p>Character: Tantoo Cardinal plays Lizzie Q in the Killers of the Flower Moon cast.</p>
<p>Jesse Plemons As Tom White</p>
<p>Actor: Jesse Plemons, 35, was born in Dallas, Texas in 1988. Plemons&rsquo; breakthrough role was in the TV series Friday Night Lights, but based on Plemons&rsquo; roles in Breaking Bad and Jungle Cruise, along with many others, the actor has become somewhat typecast as a villain. Plemons makes for a perfect antagonist because he&rsquo;s impossible to read, and his quiet and slow speech makes him seem that much more menacing. Though being a prominent figure on the television landscape with Friday Night Lights, Breaking Bad, and Fargo, Plemons has made a name for himself in the movie landscape too.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: Friday Night Lights (2006-2011), Observe and Report (2009), Breaking Bad (2012-2013), The Master (2012), Fargo (2015), Bridge of Spies (2015), The Post (2017), Game Night (2018), Vice (2018), The Irishman (2019), El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019), I&rsquo;m Thinking of Ending Things (2020), Judas and the Black Messiah (2021), Jungle Cruise (2021), The Power of the Dog (2021), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: Jesse Plemons&rsquo; Killers of the Flower Moon character is Tom White. Tom White is the BOI (now known as the FBI) agent investigating the Oklahoma murders, with him appearing at the door of Ernest Burkhart and asking about the conspiracy.</p>
<pre><code>              How To Watch Killers Of The Flower Moon   Martin Scorsese's movie Killers of the Flower Moon released in theaters first before its eventual streaming release. Here is how and when to watch it.   
</code></pre>
<p>Brendan Fraser as W. S. Hamilton</p>
<p>Actor: Brendan Fraser, 55, was born in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1968. Fraser&rsquo;s breakthrough movie was Encino Man, in which two teenagers discover a frozen caveman who must adapt to 20th-century society. Killers of the Flower Moon follows The Whale, in which Fraser totally disappears into the role of a depressed teacher and delivers a powerful dramatic performance that many who know him from movies like The Mummy or George of the Jungle didn&rsquo;t know he was capable of. Fraser is enjoying a major comeback and quickly regaining his 1990s popularity, winning an Oscar for The Whale.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: Encino Man (1992), Airheads (1994), George of the Jungle (1997), Blast from the Past (1999), The Mummy (1999), Monkeybone (2001), Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003), Crash (2004), Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009), Doom Patrol (2019-2023), No Sudden Move (2021), The Whale (2022), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: Brendan Fraser joins the Killers of the Flower Moon cast as W. S. Hamilton, William Hale&rsquo;s corrupt attorney. Although Fraiser&rsquo;s role in Killers of the Flower Moon is small, he is a major part of some of the most significant moments, with him stealing the spotlight during the courtroom scene. Fraser&rsquo;s movies are generally family-friendly features, but Fraser&rsquo;s Killers of the Flower Moon character is a far cry from those previous roles.</p>
<p>John Lithgow as Prosecutor Leaward</p>
<p>Actor: John Lithgow, 78, was born in Rochester, New York in 1945. Lithgow&rsquo;s breakthrough role was in 1982&rsquo;s The World According to Garp, which earned him an Oscar nomination. Despite coming from a sitcom background, Lithgow has proven how great he is at playing corrupt and despicable old men with too much power, and his performance as Roger Ailes in Bombshell is a perfect example of exactly that. Lithgow might be a two-time Academy Award nominee, but he&rsquo;s best known for playing one of the aliens disguised as a human in the sitcom Third Rock from the Sun.</p>
<p>Notable Movies &amp; TV Shows: All That Jazz (1979), Blow Out (1981), Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), Footloose (1984), Harry and the Hendersons (1987), The Pelican Brief (1993), 3rd Rock from the Sun (1996-2001), Shrek (2001), Dreamgirls (2006), Dexter (2009), Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), Interstellar (2014), The Crown (2016-2019), Daddy&rsquo;s Home 2 (2017), Pet Sematary (2019), Bombshell (2019), Killers of the Flower Moon (2023).</p>
<p>Character: John Lithgow plays Prosecutor Leaward in the Killers of the Flower Moon cast, with him being the prosecutor tasked with convicting De Niro&rsquo;s Hale near the end of the film.</p>
