Siobhan Thomoson teases more of Aguefort Adventuring Academy in Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year as well as the usual silly adventures. The second season of Fantasy High spent no time at school with The Bad Kids setting off on their quest during Spring Break. However, while the first season was set largely during the school year and took place at Aguefort, classes were not a large part of the season&#39;s arc.




During an exclusive interview with Screen Rant for Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year, Thompson teases more time spent at Aguefort Adventuring Academy. She revealed that fans will get to see inside classrooms as The Bad Kids struggle with school and their future. Thompson discussed how this season feels more intimate and relatable than the past two seasons, with a more school-focused story. Check out Thompson&#39;s full quote below:


Siobhan Thompson: We&#39;re definitely going to be in Aguefort a lot more. We&#39;re going to see inside the classrooms for the first time. We&#39;re going to go to class with people and see what&#39;s happening there. It&#39;s The Bad Kids starting to suddenly have to take their future a little bit more seriously.
They&#39;re in that stage of school where they&#39;re like, &#34;Do I go to college? Do I get a job? What am I going to do after this? What&#39;s my path? We kind of coasted the last two years because it was pretty easy, but now suddenly school is really hard and the world is still not fixed, and we&#39;ve still got these quests to do.&#34;
...So it feels more intimate, I think, it feels smaller, but at the same time, more relatable. And we&#39;re still going on big quests to save various exciting things that I don&#39;t want to tell you anything about. But The Bad Kids are still gonna Bad Kid. We&#39;re still going to be running around doing adventures when we really should be doing our homework. But yeah, it&#39;s much more school-focused than it has been in the past.






 Fantasy High Digs More Into The High School Teenage Angst In Junior Year 
         

While Fantasy High follows teenage heroes, it has largely taken place outside the high school, with The Bad Kids often skipping out on class in the first season to investigate Kalvaxus&#39; scheme. Now it seems the heroes will have to reckon with not only the usual world-ending dangers and adventures; they will also need to confront questions about their futures. As juniors, they will need to begin thinking about their plans after high school, and, unlike the Seven Maidens, they may not be desperately trying to stick together.

  0:40                       Brennan Lee Mulligan Reveals What Inspired Dimension 20 Fantasy High Junior Year &#34;I Couldn&#39;t Stop Dreaming About It&#34;   Exclusive: Brennan Lee Mulligan teases silliness and how his dreams inspired the long-awaited new season of Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year.    




Fantasy High Junior Year began unlike any other at the tail end of the Night Yorb quest that was set up in the Sophomore Year cliffhanger. The first episode makes it clear: The Bad Kids have changed since the end of Sophomore Year, with Kristen Applebees perhaps making the most obvious changes. These changes will likely continue as some of the adventuring party, like Adaine, begin to take school more seriously while contemplating their future after Aguefort.



The teenage angst, silliness, and perceived sense of immortality are some of the most fun aspects of Fantasy High.




While the previous season dove into each of The Bad Kids trauma and nightmares, this season could unearth new fears as the reality of high school coming to an end may begin to hit this band of friends. Dimension 20: Fantasy High Junior Year is an opportunity to explore an aspect of The Bad Kids lives that has yet to be tapped, notably how they see themselves fitting into the world either all together or as individuals after Aguefort Adventuring Academy.
