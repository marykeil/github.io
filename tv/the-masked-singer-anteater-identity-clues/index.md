 Anteater’s One Hit Wonders Night Performances &amp; Clues 

 

When Anteater took the stage on The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders Night, Jenny wondered if he was &#34;a little guy,&#34; but couldn&#39;t tell because of the costume. Robin agreed that he was a little guy. Anteater sang a powerful version of &#34;Walking in Memphis&#34; by Marc Cohn. Anteater&#39;s clue package began with him standing in front of a red barn with two signs that said, &#34;Ant Farms For Sale&#34; and &#34;Gi-Ant Sale!!&#34;




Anteater was then seen on a yacht saying, &#34;I&#39;ve had a long career, but I&#39;ve had to learn the hard way that fame isn&#39;t everything.&#34; Anteater was then seen playing an electric guitar at the top of the yacht. He shared, &#34;Sure it got me the houses, the sports cars, R-O-C-K-ing on the yachts with the glitterati.&#34; Suddenly, a growling cougar appeared, scaring Anteater. He raised his arms and covered his eyes. As it began to rain, he revealed, &#34;But, at the height of my success, fame took its toll. I fell into some bad business deals. My personal life was a mess, and, worst of all, I lost my sense of self.&#34;

Anteater continued, &#34;All the signs were telling me I had to get away and take it easy.&#34; The rain stopped, and the sky cleared, revealing a white figure of an angel in the sky. Anteater was then seen on a farm. He said, &#34;So I traded the fancy houses for a chicken coop, and my entourage became a donkey named Jasper.&#34; Anteater pet the donkey&#39;s head.




A house was then shown on the screen as a rainbow appeared above it. Anteater went on to say, &#34;I built my dream home. I even found my true love and started a family.&#34; At that point, a wooden box with a large blue eye painted on it was shown, with roosters in the background. Anteater concluded with, &#34;If there&#39;s one thing I learned, life is all about redefining yourself. Sometimes you gotta lose it all to gain everything.&#34; A spinning windmill was the last image in the clue package.

After Anteater&#39;s performance, another clue was revealed about him. The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders karaoke machine played &#34;Somebody&#39;s Watching Me&#34; by Rockwell. Anteater explained his connection to the classic song, saying, &#34;Well, there was a time when I performed in front of 40% of the entire world.&#34; Robin said that the only event that came to mind that was watched by that many people was the Live Aid event in the 1980s.

Later in the episode, Anteater and Hibiscus went head-to-head in the Smackdown, during which they both sang &#34;Hey Mickey&#34; by Toni Basil. Anteater showed another side to his voice during his rousing rendition of the song. Nicole even commented that he sounded so different from his first performance. Anteater made it through to Trolls Night, while Hibiscus was later revealed to be Luann de Lesseps.




                  The Masked Singer Season 10: Every Celebrity Reveal   The Masked Singer season 10 had 17 incredible reveals. Here&#39;s every celebrity who was unmasked in the mystery singing competition&#39;s milestone season.    



 Anteater&#39;s Trolls Night Performances &amp; Clues 

 

On Trolls Night, Anteater sang a stirring rendition of &#34;I Want It That Way&#34; by Backstreet Boys. Anteater&#39;s clue package began with him saying, &#34;Last week was a blast, even though I had to fight my way out of the Smackdown. But of course I made it because, one thing people should know about me, is that I love to win.&#34; At that point, cars and a plane were shown.

Anteater continued, &#34;That&#39;s why I&#39;m so competitive at everything I do, whether it&#39;s music or sports. It&#39;s pushed me to become a star in my game.&#34; Anteater then looked at two boxes: one with CDs and one with red hearts with a &#34;Lost and Found&#34; sign on them. He said, &#34;I wrestled in high school, and was so good, I could&#39;ve gone to college for it, but I needed more.&#34; As several race cars were shown, Anteater continued, &#34;So I drove race cars, earned a competition license, and, like a boss, I raced all over America and the U.K. Behind the wheel feels like home sweet home.&#34;




A giant coin with Jenny and Nicole&#39;s faces was then shown resting on the hood of a race car. A bowl of oatmeal with two watermelon slices was also seen. One of the slices had a bite taken out of it. Anteater concluded by saying, &#34;You can talk the talk, but, in these challenges, you either got it, or you don&#39;t. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here to prove that I got what it takes to win it all. Who doesn&#39;t love a little competition?&#34;

After Anteater&#39;s performance, Poppy and Branch from Trolls gave another clue about him. It was a sign with a star on it that said, &#34;Hall of Fame.&#34; Anteater explained, &#34;I guess the Trolls just might know something about the Hall of Fame.&#34; Later in the episode, Anteater competed against Cuddle Monster in the Smackdown. They both sang &#34;Can&#39;t Stop the Feeling!&#34; by Justin Timberlake. Anteater advanced to the Group C finals, while Cuddle Monster was eliminated from the competition and later revealed to be Metta World Peace.




                  The Masked Singer: Donut Identity &amp; Clues   The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Donut placed second in the mystery celebrity singing competition. Here are the clues that revealed his true identity.    



 Anteater&#39;s Holiday Sing-A-Long Clue 

 

 During The Masked Singer season 10 Holiday Sing-A-Long, a new clue about Anteater was revealed. It was a cooked T-bone steak. Anteater explained, &#34;Finally, a meaty clue! This steak helped me get to the top. I don&#39;t know where I would be without it.&#34;



 Anteater&#39;s Soundtrack To My Life Night (Group C Finals) Performance &amp; Clues 

 

During The Masked Singer Soundtrack to My Life Night, Anteater sang &#34;Johnny B. Goode&#34; by Chuck Berry. He began his clue package by saying, &#34;Don&#39;t underestimate a short king. Cuddle Monster might have a few inches on me, but, like David and Goliath, this Anteater came out on top.&#34;




When asked what song has a special significance in his life, Anteater replied, &#34;Tonight I&#39;m singing Johnny B. Goode because I grew up listening to Chuck Berry on the radio, and I collected all of his 45 RPM singles.&#34; Anteater then held up a record with a kiss mark on it. He continued, &#34;When my mom signed me up for guitar lessons at five years old, this was one of the first songs I learned to play on my homemade right-handed guitar. And it&#39;s not easy when you&#39;re a lefty.&#34;

Anteater went on to say, &#34;Even after decades of creating my own unique sound, and becoming an inspiration to others, I&#39;m still influenced by those early musical pioneers.&#34; At that point, a four-leaf clover blossomed in a flower pot. Anteater concluded by saying, &#34;Now I can&#39;t wait to get on stage and show that real rock and roll never dies. And, hopefully, it&#39;ll get me to the finale.&#34;

After Anteater&#39;s performance, another clue was revealed about him. The contestants were asked to dedicate a mixtape to a panelist to whom they had a special connection. Anteater&#39;s said, &#34;Deep Thoughts.&#34; He explained, &#34;I had the greatest conversation when I was talking to Jenny.&#34; Jenny thought that maybe she interviewed him.




                  The Masked Singer: Sea Queen Identity &amp; Clues   The Masked Singer season 10 featured 16 mystery celebrities competing for the Golden Mask trophy. Here&#39;s how the clues revealed Sea Queen&#39;s identity.    



 Anteater’s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists 
          

When it came time for the Masked Singer panelists to make their guesses, Ken agreed with Robin&#39;s comments about Live Aid in the 1980s, and said that Anteater had to be an &#39;80s icon. He guessed that, based on the look and the height, he was Rick Springfield. Jenny agreed that Anteater was a rock legend, but she thought that he might be John Cougar Mellencamp. Nicole added that Bryan Adams also has a beautiful vocal like Anteater&#39;s.

On Trolls Night, The Masked Singer panelists had some new guesses for Anteater&#39;s identity. Jenny said that his voice felt very iconic. She guessed Bob Seger or Bob Dylan. Nicole disagreed. Jenny then said that she wished that he was Willie Nelson. Robin thought that maybe Anteater could&#39;ve been Paul Simon, but then he agreed with Jenny&#39;s Willie guess. Nicole went with Jenny&#39;s previous guess of John Cougar Mellencamp.




During The Masked Singer Soundtrack to My Life Night, the panelists offered their final guesses for Anteater&#39;s identity before he was unmasked. They guessed many rock legends, including Jackson Browne (Robin), John Cougar Mellencamp (Nicole), Billy Joel (Ken), and Steven Van Zandt (Jenny). However, no one guessed Anteater&#39;s identity correctly.



 Anteater&#39;s Identity Is Revealed 

 

Although the panelists came up with some great guesses for Anteater, none of them were able to guess that he was singer John Oates, who was part of the duo Hall &amp; Oates, with Daryl Hall. Not only did Anteater&#39;s voice sound exactly like him, but the clues matched him perfectly. The panelists noted that Anteater was short in stature and John is between 5&#39; 4&#34; and 5&#39; 5&#34;. He&#39;s also left-handed, but learned to play on a right-handed guitar. The &#34;Hall of Fame&#34; clue was obviously a reference to Hall &amp; Oates, but John was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.




John turned down college wrestling scholarships in high school. He also participated in auto racing for ten years. Anteater&#39;s reference to &#34;bad business deals&#34; referred to the fact that John and Daryl had signed a bad deal, in which they were paid up front for their music. However, this meant that others were paid most of their record royalties. In 1985, Hall &amp; Oates performed at Live Aid, which is what Anteater was referring to when he said that he once performed in front of 40% of the world. John eventually ended up moving to Colorado to live on a farm. Of course, the oatmeal is a play on John&#39;s last name, Oates.

Some of the clues pointed to Hall &amp; Oates songs, such as the cougar (&#34;Maneater&#34;), the wooden box with the eye (&#34;Private Eyes&#34;), and the record with the kiss mark (&#34;Kiss on My List&#34;). The T-bone steak was a reference to the late Tom &#34;T-Bone&#34; Wolk, who was the bassist for Hall &amp; Oates. In addition, Jenny once interviewed John.




As The Masked Singer&#39;s Anteater, John had some spectacular performances throughout his time on the show. He brought a fun energy to the stage, and set the bar high for future performers. John is a legendary singer, and The Masked Singer was lucky to have him as a contestant.

The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.
