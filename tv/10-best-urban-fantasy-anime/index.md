## Literature Review
Urban fantasy is an increasingly popular genre in anime and beyond, mixing modern with supernatural, allowing for unique modes of storytelling.




The best urban fantasy anime make the most of the increasingly popular genre. Broad and highly versatile, it mixes fantasy elements such as magic and fantastical creatures into more modern settings. Like urban legends, they don&#39;t necessarily have to take place in a city; the name only differentiates it from historical fantasy.
It&#39;s a toss-up whether humanity at large is aware of the magical elements of their society. In shows where they aren&#39;t, the protagonists stumble into a hidden world beneath their own, having to learn quickly how things work. When they are, they are often on the lower rungs of society, working jobs that are mundane to them but larger-than-life to audiences.









 








 10  Blue Exorcist Is A World Of Demons And Warriors 
Based on the manga by Kazue Kato


 







Blue Exorcist’s newest season will begin airing January 7, 2024. 

Rin Okumura has always known that he&#39;s different from everyone else, and not in a good way. But it&#39;s not until his thirteenth birthday that he discovers why: he&#39;s the son of Satan, and when his true demonic powers are unlocked, he&#39;s under suspicion from the entire supernatural world. Nevertheless, Rin is determined to hunt down and slay his father.
The world of demons and exorcists goes deeper than Rin ever imagined. His classmates at True Cross Academy all practice a wide variety of magical disciplines to protect unaware humans. Not only does Rin have to personally reconsider his place in the world, but he&#39;s faced with persecution from his own side, and what&#39;s more, the enemies they’re faced with extend far past Satan and his demons.

 9  Baccano! Is A Wild, Chaotic Ride 
Based on the light novels by Ryohgo Narita
        

As the vice president of the Daily Days newspaper laments in the show&#39;s first minutes, one really can&#39;t pin down a main character or story in Baccano! Its Italian title is difficult to translate directly, but more or less, it means a chaotic, confused mess of loud noises, and in the best possible way, that&#39;s exactly what this show is.
On the streets of Prohibition-era New York, ordinary criminals and mafiosos contend with mad scientists and homunculi. Aboard a state-of-the-art intercontinental train, terrorists and cultists both try to hold the train up, while thieves, monsters, and immortals pursue their own agendas. And all the while, there&#39;s Isaac and Miria, laws unto themselves whose thought processes and continued survival baffle everyone they meet.

Because each girl is from a different time period, some have to adjust to modern times as well.

 7  JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure Is Larger Than Life 
Based on the manga by Hirohiko Araki


 







JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure revolutionized manga and anime with its unique storytelling and art styles. One of its most famous aspects is its forward jumps in time and changes in protagonist from part to part. While Phantom Blood, taking place in Victorian England, falls under historical fantasy instead, the rest is urban fantasy all the way, from Battle Tendency onward.
Each part exemplifies urban fantasy in different ways. Part 2 brings Hamon into 1920s New York City and Italy, Part 4 focuses on the town of Morioh turned upside down by its many Stand users, and Part 6 sees the very fabric of reality torn apart all across Florida. Because Stand users can be anyone, anywhere, at any time, there is no limit to the supernatural effects they can have.

 6  Chainsaw Man Works As A Professional Devil Hunter 
Based on the manga by Tatsuki Fujimoto
        

Even before his yakuza boss murdered him to sacrifice to a Devil, Denji already had one of the worst jobs in anime. When he&#39;s resurrected with the ability to transform into Chainsaw Man and conscripted into the Public Safety Bureau, he believes he&#39;s hit the jackpot. But the life of a professional Devil Hunter might have even more pitfalls than before.
The existence of Devils, no matter how horrifying, is entirely commonplace to the people of this world. The Public Safety Bureau as an institution is just as well known and considered a dirty but viable career path, whether for vengeance like Aki or money like poor Kobeni. And as Denji knows too well, there are plenty of freelance Devil hunters and criminals who will take advantage of the powers Devils offer, by any means necessary.

 5  Jujutsu Kaisen Stars A Secret Society Of Sorcerers 
Based on the manga by Gege Akutami
        

With his cheerful personality and abnormal strength, Yuuji Itadori could easily have been the protagonist of a lighter kind of shounen anime. Instead, when he swallows two of Ryoumen Sukuna&#39;s cursed fingers, he becomes Jujutsu Tech&#39;s newest fighter of the cursed spirits that plague humanity. His days with them are numbered, though: already possessed by Sukuna, Yuuji fights to find and swallow all the other fingers so both of them can be killed, and the world rid of its worst curse.
Jujutsu sorcerers have been defending humanity from the shadows for centuries. A major theme of the series is the younger generation of sorcerers trying to overcome the oppressive traditions of the older ones. As audiences saw throughout the just-concluded Shibuya Incident arc, the longer the story goes on, the more visible the world of curses and jujutsu sorcery becomes to the public.

 4  Tokyo Ghoul Follows Ghouls And Humans Fighting To Survive 
Based on the manga by Sui Ishida


To Ken Kaneki, the ever-present threat of man-eating ghouls is a fact of life, but compared to his personal problems, they seem very distant. He probably should have been a little more worried – the date of his dreams turns out to be a ghoul hungry for him. Though he manages to survive the attack, he is turned into a half-ghoul in one of anime&#39;s scariest transformations.
As much as he initially hates it, Kaneki is forced to learn quickly about ghoul society and how they survive in a world that wants them dead. The Ghoul Countermeasures Bureau is one of the most powerful government agencies with considerable public backing, determined to wipe out even ghouls who refuse to kill. After considerable trauma, Kaneki is changed permanently, going from a shy human to one of the most feared ghouls in Tokyo.

 3  Noragami&#39;s Gods Fight To Be Believed In 
Based on the manga by Adachitoka
        

Hiyori Iki thought nothing of rushing into the road to push a boy out of the way of a bus. But as she discovers, that boy was the god Yato, and her brush with death has given her the ability to project out of her body and interact with spirits. As she becomes closer with Yato, she discovers more of the world of gods and monsters that will decide both of their lives.
Yato works tirelessly protecting humans from ayakashi and doing odd jobs for the traditional fee of five yen – in an age where this keeps him perpetually poor. He&#39;s determined to cultivate enough belief in himself among humans that he can thrive as the kind of god he wants to be. Like many anime based on Japanese mythology, it deals with the relationship of gods to humans in an age where the former are looked at considerably less.

 2  Yu-Gi-Oh!&#39;s World Revolves Around A Fantasy Card Game 
Based on the manga by Kazuki Takahashi


 







Counting spinoff series like Capsule Monsters, there are a total of 11 Yu-Gi-Oh! anime series. 

Duel Monsters took the world by storm immediately. Not only does it dominate much of the world’s entertainment, but it’s so ingrained in the culture that dueling is a lucrative career, new tech developments are devoted to it, and it’s even commonly used to settle arguments. However, as Yugi Muto and his successors as the main character discover, it isn&#39;t just any game: it&#39;s based on ancient battles between spirits that give the cards considerable power.
Similar to JoJo&#39;s Bizarre Adventure, Yu-Gi-Oh! changes protagonists and takes major leaps in time with each new series. Still, however advanced the world becomes, the game of Duel Monsters and its origins continue to fuel the story. While the contrast is prevalent enough in the original series, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and 5D&#39;stake it to higher levels as the world&#39;s technology improves, while the heroes&#39; supernatural threats and allies remain just as crucial.

 1  Durarara!! Turns Ikebukuro Into A Hotbed Of Fantasy 
Based on the light novels by Ryohgo Narita
        

At the invitation of his best friend, Mikado Ryuugamine moves to the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo. Here, the streets are patrolled by a spirit looking for her lost head, where residents occasionally have to dodge flying trash cans when the local strongman loses his temper, and never trusting anything Izaya Orihara tells you. Slowly but steadily, it becomes clear that Mikado himself also isn&#39;t quite as meek and innocent as everyone believes.
Another Ryohgo Narita work, Durarara!! takes place in a different time period but the same universe as Baccano!– confirmed whenIsaac and Miria make cameos as Dollars members. As the chaos in Ikebukuro builds and builds, the cast not only has to deal with more grounded problems like gang warfare, but supernatural threats like a brainwashing cursed sword.
