## Literature Review

Renowned Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise producer Brannon Braga praises Star Trek: Prodigy&#39;s approach to the space-faring franchise.




Brannon Braga – renowned Star Trek producer, writer, and director – praised Star Trek: Prodigy for taking a bold, creative approach to the space-faring series. Star Trek: Prodigy season 1 premiered on Netflix on Christmas Day 2023 with 20 episodes, after a fan campaign saved the beloved CGI-animated series from cancelation. Speaking with Prodigy&#39;s creators and showrunners, Kevin and Dan Hageman, and Aaron J. Waltke, Brannon Braga commented on the creative use of Admiral Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), highlighting the character’s appearance as a hologram on the USS Protostar and the inclusion of legacy characters across multiple series. The highly anticipated Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 is due in 2024.




Brannon Braga joined the Star Trek: Prodigy showrunners and TrekMovie.com panel moderator Anthony Pascale for TrekTalks 3’s Producing Trek Panel. Braga joined the franchise from Star Trek: The Next Generation season 4 through to the end of Star Trek: Enterprise, including work on two feature films and as showrunner on Star Trek: Voyager and Enterprise. During the panel, Braga reflected on his aspirations to break traditional Star Trek continuity with Voyager and Enterprise and Prodigy’s more successful approach to making these changes whilst also “trying to impart […] the essence of Star Trek.” Read Braga’s quote, and view the full panel at the 3:44:40 timestamp below:


I think what you guys were doing is way more radical. First of all, it’s animated but animated in such a way [as if] Pixar made a Star Trek show. Very sophisticated animation, 3D animation. There’s that. There’s the fact that you’ve got a non-human crew. [And] a lot of episodes. That’s a lot of episodes, man.






 



TrekTalks 3’s live-streamed Star Trek panels helped to raise over $109,000 for the Hollywood Food Coalition.




                  Netflix’s Star Trek: Prodigy Season 2 Release Plan Is A Mystery To Showrunners   Star Trek: Prodigy season 2 will premiere on Netflix in 2024, but when and how will the episodes drop? Prodigy&#39;s showrunners can only guess.   


 Voyager and Enterprise Took A New Approach To Star Trek 
Voyager&#39;s Female Captain Explored The Delta Quadrant &amp; Enterprise&#39;s Crew Retconned Star Trek’s History
         

In a pre-Star Trek: Prodigy effort to bring a new audience to the Star Trek franchise and to revitalize an essentially full timeline, Voyager and Enterprise creators Rick Berman, Brannon Braga, et al sought a creative approach to distinguish the shows. Designed as a prequel to other Star Trek shows (chronologically the first) and exploring a previously unseen part of the timeline, Enterprise&#39;s 22nd-century setting complemented a less formalized style and uniform with a greater focus on characterization and moral issues. Fans initially met Enterprise&#39;s contemporary political feel and &#34;different sensibility&#34; with a mixed response, but reception to Enterprise has steadily improved since the show&#39;s season four conclusion in 2005.




Star Trek: Voyager took direction from potential areas of improvement for The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, returning to starship-based exploration with a specific goal of getting home. Lost in the Delta Quadrant, Voyager introduced several firsts to the franchise and a fresh sense of progression. Presenting the first female live-action lead, Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), the show focused on feminist empowerment, equality, and strong, nuanced female roles. In the TrekTalks 3 Producing Trek Panel, Brannon Braga suggests efforts to think outside the box with Voyager and Enterprise achieved mixed results and praises Star Trek: Prodigy for a &#34;radical&#34; approach.



Star Trek: Prodigy is available for streaming on Netflix.
