## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor couple Theresa Nist and Gerry Turner&#39;s Instagram dance video has received some interesting responses from their former co-stars.




The Golden Bachelor couple Theresa Nist and Gerry Turner filmed themselves dancing, and their former co-stars offered warm words of support for the newly engaged pair. On The Golden Bachelor season finale, Gerry, a 72-year-old retired restaurateur from Hudson, Indiana, proposed to Theresa, a 70-year-old financial services professional from Shrewsbury, New Jersey. They got engaged, and will be married in a live television event on January 4, 2024.




On Instagram, Theresa posted a video of her and Gerry dancing to Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers&#39; &#34;Islands in the Stream.&#34;


 

Theresa captioned the post with lyrics from the song. Gerry&#39;s former Golden Bachelor flame, Faith Martin, commented on the video saying, &#34;Oh my gosh I love this sooo much!! Happy holidays to you and your united families!! Love you both so much! Call me soon! Miss u!&#34; In addition, Joan Vassos wrote, &#34;This just made me smile! You seem like you have been together foreverâ€¦just meant to be. BN did a great job on this matchmaking adventure! Enjoy your first holidays together with your families. XO.&#34;

 What&#39;s Going On With Gerry &amp; Theresa&#39;s Wedding? 
          

Theresa and Gerry will be married live in a television special on January 4, 2024. After host Jesse Palmer officiated Mari Pepin and Kenny Braasch&#39;s nuptials during the Bachelor in Paradise season 9 finale, fans speculated that he could do the same for Gerry and Theresa. However, their Golden Bachelor co-star, Susan Noles, is also a wedding officiant, so she could marry the couple instead. The Golden Bachelor cast is expected to attend. During the season finale, Jesse gave Theresa and Gerry with a trip to Italy, which will be their honeymoon trip.

It&#39;s beautiful to see Faith and Joan wishing Gerry and Theresa well as they continue their love story together. While Joan self-eliminated because her daughter needed her at home, Faith was blindsided when Gerry broke up with her. However, they both seem to have come to terms with what happened, and they are now close friends with the Golden Bachelor couple. Gerry and Theresa&#39;s happiness shines through in their video as they smile and dance together. Their romance began with them dancing in a flash mob to Journey&#39;s &#34;Don&#39;t Stop Believing&#34; on their first one-on-one date.




As Gerry and Theresa move forward with their wedding, ABC has put out a casting call for The Golden Bachelorette contestants, specifically senior men looking for love. There&#39;s a good chance that Faith and Joan, who were fan favorites, could be offered the lead role. The producers could also ask beloved contestants such as runner-up Leslie Fhima, Ellen Goltzer, Sandra Mason, Kathy Swarts, or Susan to be the Golden Bachelorette. With 22 extraordinary women to choose from, they really can&#39;t go wrong. It&#39;s wonderful to see that The Golden Bachelor not only resulted in true love for Gerry and Theresa, but also close and lasting friendships among the cast members.
