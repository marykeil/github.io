## Literature Review
A Hugo Award-winning science-fiction series, The Expanse pays homage to a classic sci-fi movie from nearly five decades ago by copying its opening.




The Expanse, a Hugo Award-winning science-fiction series, pays homage to a classic sci-fi movie from 45 years ago by directly copying its opening sequence. Based on a series of novels, The Expanse originally premiered on the SyFy network in 2015 before being picked up by Amazon Prime Video in 2019. Across its six seasons, the series showcases a future where humanity has colonized the solar system. The Expanse&#39;s ensemble cast of characters includes Chrisjen Avasarala (Shohreh Aghdashloo), a UN Security Council member; detective Josephus Miller (Thomas Jane); and ex-soldier James Holden (Steven Strait), who serves as an officer aboard the Canterbury in the show&#39;s first season.




While Chrisjen works to prevent a war from erupting between Mars and the United Nations, Joe searches for a missing woman with ties to a larger plot. However, it&#39;s what happens to James and the other surviving Canterbury crew members that will resonate with sci-fi fans. By the end of the pilot episode, all The Expanse&#39;s disparate main characters find themselves pulled into a system-wide conspiracy. With the solar system&#39;s carefully curated peace threatened, and the discovery of new alien technology causing existential disruption, the stage is set for The Expanse to tell an inventive story, all while borrowing from other genre greats.


 How The Expanse&#39;s Opening Perfectly Mirrors 1979&#39;s Alien 
          

The Expanse season 1, episode 1&#39;s opening scene perfectly mirrors the beginning of Alien, Ridley Scott&#39;s 1979 sci-fi horror classic. Rigged as an ice hauler, Expanse&#39;s Canterbury routinely collects frozen crystals from the rings of Saturn, which are then melted into potable water. On one of these standard outings, the Canterbury receives a distress signal, prompting the crew to investigate. Sensing something might be amiss with the S.O.S., which was sent out by the Martian transport Scopuli, some of the Canterbury crew members have misgivings, but they&#39;re legally obligated to respond. At the scene, the mysterious stealth frigate, Anubis, destroys the Canterbury, killing most of the crew.






After SyFy canceled The Expanse, the series was picked up by Amazon Prime Video, which made several additional seasons.




While the Canterbury&#39;s destruction leads to immediate system-wide chaos, the incident ultimately results in the discovery of extra-terrestrial life — not unlike Alien. That said, the Expanse&#39;s opening sequence is carefully plotted to mirror Scott&#39;s film. Memorably, Alien opens with the crew of the commercial space tug Nostromo, including Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), in stasis, but they&#39;re awoken by Alien&#39;s infamous computer, Mother, after it detects a strange transmission from a nearby moon. Company policy requires the Nostromo to investigate any potential distress signals. This, of course, leads the crew to discover an abandoned ship — and, later, the titular Xenomorph.



 The Expanse&#39;s Alien Parallels Are A Homage, Not A Ripoff 
          




There&#39;s no doubt that The Expanse and Alien&#39;s opening sequences feature the same key plot beats: a reluctant crew responds to a strange distress signal only to find a derelict ship and, eventually, aliens. One of the most influential sci-fi films of all time, Alien has inspired an incalculable amount of movies and TV shows — and The Expanse is no exception. The lauded science-fiction series isn&#39;t interested in ripping off Alien. Instead, it&#39;s paying homage to one of the genre&#39;s most enduring works. In doing so, The Expanse not only puts itself in conversation with Scott&#39;s film but deepens its own narrative by building on familiar tropes.

                  The Expanse Ignored One Of The Oldest Sci-Fi Tropes (&amp; It Was Much Better For It)   The Expanse tends to avoid certain sci-fi tropes. However, there&#39;s one in particular that has a huge impact on the show&#39;s narrative at large.    



 The Expanse Draws From Other Sci-Fi Franchises Too 
         




Of course, Alien isn&#39;t the only sci-fi franchise that The Expanse draws inspiration from. While the series incorporates some horror elements, it also leans heavily into the kind of political-thriller intrigue, universe-shifting twists, and unique world-building that make shows like Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek such fan-loved works. In fact, Easter eggs and sly homages are littered throughout the series. A bar on Ceres, dubbed Tech Noir, is a shout-out to 1984&#39;s Terminator, while a monitor in season 1, episode 4 of The Expanse mimics one found aboard Alien&#39;s Nostromo – complete with a line about &#34;scuttle procedure.&#34;

While The Expanse is eager to pay homage to its genre brethren, it also separates itself by not shying away from things like the gritty realism of space travel (and gravity). One of the most popular sci-fi series in recent years, The Expanse&#39;s team knows that genre fans love the show&#39;s willingness to be part of the larger science-fiction fabric. The show takes this trait to the next level with The Expanse finale&#39;s massive Easter egg, which features nods to iconic sci-fi heroes, from Alien&#39;s Ellen Ripley and Battlestar Galactica&#39;s Starbuck to Mass Effect&#39;s Commander Shepard and Dune&#39;s Duncan Idaho.
