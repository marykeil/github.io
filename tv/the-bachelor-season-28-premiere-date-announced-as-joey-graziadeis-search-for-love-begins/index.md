## Literature Review
The Bachelor season 28 starring Joey Graziadei has a winter 2024 premiere date, which the leading man himself announced in an Instagram post.




The Bachelor season 28 has a premiere date, which was announced by its leading man, Joey Graziadei. Joey, a 28-year-old tennis pro originally from Collegeville, Pennsylvania, who now lives in Koloa, Hawaii, got his start on Charity Lawson&#39;s Bachelorette season. Joey was Charity&#39;s runner-up when she broke up with him and got engaged to Dotun Olubeko. Although he was heartbroken, Joey eventually accepted the role of the Bachelor, and will set forth on his journey to find true love.




In a Bachelor Instagram post, Joey announced that The Bachelor season 28 will premiere on January 22, 2024.


 

The post&#39;s caption reads, &#34;Ready for his match. @joeygraziadei&#39;s season of #TheBachelor premieres January 22 on ABC!&#34; The word &#34;match&#34; is a play on Joey being a tennis player. In the clip, Joey smiles as he says, &#34;Hey everyone! It&#39;s Joey. I am so excited to share that my season will be premiering on January 22 on ABC. I can&#39;t wait!&#34; The first promotional photographs for his season then appear on the screen. In the first one, Joey wears a pink suit as he swings a tennis racket. In the second photo, Joey holds a red rose, the signature flower of the Bachelor franchise.

 What To Expect From The Bachelor Season 28 
          

Joey&#39;s Bachelor season filmed from September 19 to November 12, 2023. On September 16, 2023, 32 Bachelor contestants were unveiled. The ages of the contestants range from 23 to 31 years old. On Charity&#39;s &#34;After the Final Rose&#34; special, when Joey was announced as the Bachelor, a woman named Lea Cayanan from Hawaii was announced as one of the first contestants. Host Jesse Palmer handed Lea an envelope, which he said didn&#39;t contain a date card, but would help her on her journey with Joey. She wasn&#39;t allowed to open it until she stepped into the Bachelor mansion on premiere night.

Throughout his journey on Charity&#39;s season, Joey proved that he was there for the right reasons. He stayed out of the drama among the other men, and focused all of his attention on Charity. Although they had some rocky moments, including when his uncle questioned if he was being his authentic self around Charity, Joey and Charity really did fall in love with each other. However, her connection with Dotun was stronger.




Unlike some of the previous Bachelors, Joey was a fan favorite who people really wanted to see in the lead role. It will be exciting to see him take control of his own season. Joey is a kind and thoughtful man who deserves to find his happily ever after. Hopefully, he&#39;ll follow Sean Lowe, Matt James, and Zach Shallcross and become the fourth Bachelor to find lasting love on the show. Joey is the perfect choice for The Bachelor.
