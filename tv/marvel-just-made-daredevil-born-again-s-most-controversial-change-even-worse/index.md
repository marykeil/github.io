# Marvel Just Made Daredevil Born Again s Most Controversial Change Even Worse


## SUMMARY 



  Marvel Studios may have made the controversial changes to &#34;Daredevil: Born Again&#34; even worse with the release of the &#34;Echo&#34; trailer, which confirms connections to the Netflix show.   The rumored absence of Karen Page and Foggy Nelson in the MCU&#39;s &#34;Daredevil&#34; show makes little sense, especially if the Netflix show is now being considered canon.   It&#39;s still possible for Karen and Foggy to appear in &#34;Daredevil: Born Again&#34; since the show has undergone an overhaul, and the trailer for &#34;Echo&#34; suggests that Netflix&#39;s stories are now canon to the MCU.

## Literature Review
The most controversial alteration rumored for Phase 5â€™s Daredevil: Born Again in the MCU has just been made even worse by Marvel Studios.




The most controversial change for Daredevil: Born Again has just been made worse by Marvel Studios by another upcoming release. Perhaps one of the more interesting upcoming MCU projects is Phase 5&#39;s Daredevil: Born Again. The reason for this comes from the intense anticipation of the show combined with the planned overhaul of Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s story after Marvel Studios was reportedly not happy with what had been crafted thus far.




Similarly, the debate over whether Netflix&#39;s Daredevil show is MCU canon has long been waged by fans wondering whether Born Again will be a continuation of that story or a new iteration of the franchise. Concerning this argument, Daredevil: Born Again has been subject to several rumors that are controversial regarding changes to the original Netflix show. One of these controversial changes has now potentially been made worse by the release of a trailer for a different, Daredevil-adjacent MCU series and the ties it has to Netflix&#39;s three seasons centering on the Man Without Fear.


 Echo&#39;s Latest Trailer Makes Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s Missing Characters More Confusing 
          

The trailer in question was released in connection to Echo, Marvel Studios&#39; first 2024 release. The Echo trailer seemingly confirmed that Netflix&#39;s Daredevil is canon to the MCU by utilizing footage from that show to set up the involvement of Matt Murdock/Daredevil and Wilson Fisk/Kingpin. While the Netflix show inching closer to being considered MCU canon is incredibly exciting, it makes the rumors surrounding Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s MCU story that much more confusing.




It is worth noting that these elements of Daredevil: Born Again are not officially confirmed and are simply rumors. However, it was reported that Karen Page and Foggy Nelson - two major characters from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil - would not be present in the MCU&#39;s story. If Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s canon status to Netflix&#39;s show was kept unclear, the absences of these characters would be easier to justify. That said, the Netflix show being teased as canon means Karen and Foggy still being absent from the MCU&#39;s Daredevil show makes little to no sense.



 Why It May Not Be Too Late For Foggy And Karen In The MCU 
          

The rumors, again unconfirmed, stemming out of Daredevil: Born Again were that Karen and Foggy had been killed before the show began which forced Matt Murdock to retire as Daredevil until the fourth episode of the series. However, the reaction to this and other unsatisfactory elements of the show led to the production being entirely overhauled. Marvel Studios hired new writers, a new showrunner, and new directors for the project meaning it essentially - aptly given the show&#39;s title - began again from square one.




This could mean that characters like Karen and Foggy are being rewritten into the show to appear in the MCU&#39;s future. This is seemingly supported by the trailer for Echo which all but confirms Netflix&#39;s stories as canon to the MCU. If this is the case, it may not be too late for the duo to appear in Daredevil: Born Again, despite the initial confusion caused by Echo&#39;s new trailer and its connections to Netflix&#39;s Defenders saga.
