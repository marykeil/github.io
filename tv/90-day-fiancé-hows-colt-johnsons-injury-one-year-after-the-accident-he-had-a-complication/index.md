## Literature Review
A year after 90 Day Fiancé’s Colt Johnson’s trampoline accident, his wife, Vanessa Guerra, shares a heartbreaking update about his recovery.




Former 90 Day Fiancé star Colt Johnson isn’t doing so well since suffering a gruesome injury last year. The Las Vegas native is known for his controversial relationships on the show. At the beginning of his journey, he married Larissa Lima but didn’t stay with her for long. Soon after, he pursued Jess Caroline but betrayed her to be with Vanessa Guerra. In February 2021, Colt finally settled down when he married Vanessa. He initially lived with his mom, Debbie Johnson, but eventually decided to move out and get another place for himself and his wife.




Debbie’s relentless love and reliance on Colt caused many issues in his relationship with Vanessa. The pair even separated while filming 90 Day: The Single Life, citing personal issues. Fortunately, they managed to mend their differences and strengthen their marriage. The two reconciled before it was too late and continued to be together. Colt and Vanessa were supposed to be on 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1 to document their marital issues and seek therapy like other couples. However, a horrible accident prevented them from appearing on the spin-off.

 How Did Colt Injure Himself? 

 

Vanessa has been very open about Colt’s accident and how he picked up the life-threatening injury. According to her, the devastating mishap happened when she and her husband were filming for 90 Day: The Last Resort. During one of the scenes, the producers had the idea of putting Colt on a trampoline and telling him exactly how to jump. Since Colt isn’t a professional, he messed up and broke his “tibia/fibula” in addition to picking up various other injuries. Vanessa claimed that the network “bailed on” them when they realized Colt was “no good for content anymore.”






 What Did Vanessa Reveal About His Recovery In October 2023? 
          

Colt underwent numerous procedures and surgeries to fix his leg since the December 2022 accident. However, he couldn’t heal fast enough and struggled with many other severe health issues. Initially, Colt was in the hospital for over two weeks because of his leg injury when his bladder stopped working. Soon after, he had to undergo another two surgeries due to complications. In October 2023, Vanessa shared that her husband’s recovery was uncertain as doctors had scheduled him for a fourth surgery. She wrote, “one more surgery in December and hopefully his last.”

In mid-December 2023, Vanessa shared another update on Colt’s health. She revealed that things weren’t looking great for Colt, who still had to get more procedures to fix his leg. She wrote, “had a complication with surgery #4,” adding that Colt will have to get another surgery in the coming few weeks. Alongside the update, Vanessa shared a photo of Colt smiling. He didn’t seem as stressed as his wife and looked content about his situation. Hopefully, 2024 will be a good year for the 90 Day Fiancé alum, and his positive attitude will push him through his tough days.
