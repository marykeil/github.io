## Literature Review

The beloved Disney series Wizards of Waverly Place officially has a sequel show in development at Disney, featuring some of the original stars.




Wizards of Waverly Place is getting a sequel spinoff series at Disney. Showcasing the lives of the Russos, a family comprised of part-time sub shop owners and wizards, the series originally ran for four seasons from 2007 to 2012. Wizards of Waverly Place starred Selena Gomez, David Henrie, Jake T. Austin, Jennifer Stone, Maria Canals-Barrera, and David DeLuise in the main roles.




According to Deadline, Wizards of Waverly Place is now set to get a sequel show starring Gomez and Henrie. Disney has ordered a pilot for the show, which the two main actors will executive produce in addition to starring in. New cast members include Janice LeAnn Brown, Alkaio Thiele, and Mimi Gianopulos.


 What Will Be The Plot Of The Wizards Of Waverly Place Sequel? 
          

2012’s Wizards of Waverly Place series finale left the Russo siblings — Max, Alex, and Justin — poised for very different lives. As the trio competed for the title of Family Wizard, Alex won the competition and received full magic powers. Justin is able to keep some of his abilities when he takes on the role of headmaster of the boarding school WizTech. Max loses all his powers, but makes out swimmingly in the end when he gets the coveted role of taking over The Waverly Sub Station, his family’s sub shop.




The plot of the Wizards of Waverly Place sequel jumps forward over a decade, when, after a mysterious incident at WizTech, Justin decides to give up his magical powers. Instead, he will try to live a normal human life with his wife and two kids. Things shake up again, however, when a young wizard arrives at his doorstep in need of training, catapulting Justin back into the Wizard World.

                  Wizards Of Waverly Place: 5 Things That Changed After The Pilot (&amp; 5 That Stayed The Same)   Wizards of Waverly place made a star of Selena Gomez and fans of millions of kids. But not everything set up in its pilot ended up panning out.   

While it is confirmed that Gomez will appear in the Wizards of Waverly Place spinoff, how exactly Alex will feature into the story remains to be seen. The youngest Wizards of Waverly Place brother, Max, is not confirmed to appear on the show, but it is too early to completely rule out at least a cameo from Austin. Arriving over a decade after Wizards of Waverly Place originally went off the air, the sequel seems to be a far more mature take on the plot as the Russo siblings continue into adulthood.
