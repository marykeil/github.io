## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Tiffany Franco is dating someone new. She looks happy in a photo with her boyfriend, who shares his name with her ex-husband.




90 Day: The Single Life star Tiffany Franco has a new man in her life after her breakup with Ronald Smith and her recent split with Dan MacFarland. Tiffany, 31, who&#39;s from Maryland, got married to South African man Ronald during 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 1. Tiffany welcomed her daughter Carley Rose in July 2019. She already had a son named Daniel from a previous relationship. Tiffany and Ronald couldn&#39;t be together because of his visa issues. He was also not able to provide for his family. Tiffany began dating Dan, a comedian she met on a dating app, but announced their split in February 2023.




Tiffany suggested she was dating someone new in March 2023 and, in June 2023, sparked dating rumors with Scott Wern, but according to @90dayfianceupdate, Tiffany now has a new boyfriend.


 

The Instagram page shared a photo of Tiffany with a man at Magoo&#39;s. The man looked into the camera while the photo was being taken and had a hand wrapped around Tiffany, while the 90 Day Fiancé star looked lovingly at her boyfriend. Tiffany, who&#39;s lost over 80 pounds, was dressed in a black outfit. The Instagram page revealed that Tiffany&#39;s new boyfriend is not from America. She&#39;s dating internationally again as the man is from Ireland.


 90 Day Fiancé Fans React To News Of Tiffany Franco&#39;s Boyfriend 
          




The 90 Day Fiancé fan wrote in the caption that Tiffany&#39;s boyfriend is named Ronnie. In the comments section, fans reacted to the news of Tiffany dating someone new. A fan wrote, &#34;She don&#39;t care for her kids. Seeking older man after man.&#34; Someone else asked why Tiffany couldn&#39;t find someone from her own country to date. &#34;Anything to stay on tv lol,&#34; added a different reality TV show viewer. However, a few of the fans were also happy for Tiffany because she appeared to be happy in the relationship. Tiffany was last seen on 90 Day: The Single Life. Even though she said she was over Ronald, she had gone to South Africa to meet him where she got back together with her ex.

Tiffany found out Ronald was still in a relationship with a woman he had dated in the middle of his and Tiffany&#39;s split. Tiffany then decided that she was going to divorce Ronald. Dan, whom she met a couple of times before her South Africa visit, asked Tiffany out on a date. Tiffany did date Dan for a short while off-screen. However, after their split, Tiffany posted a video showing an unknown man whose identity she never disclosed. Lidia Morel&#39;s ex-boyfriend, Scott, expressed an interest in dating Tiffany. She seemingly declined Scott&#39;s offer and revealed they weren&#39;t in a relationship.




Tiffany has yet to make her relationship with Ronni Instagram official. Tiffany is a popular 90 Day Fiancé cast member, even if her poor life choices are criticized. Considering Ronnie is from Ireland, if things get serious between him and Tiffany, they could end up getting engaged, which could mean they get to document their new relationship on TLC. Tiffany is not a part of the upcoming 90 Day: The Single Life season 4, but there&#39;s always a possibility that she will make a comeback with her new boyfriend and an interesting new storyline that doesn&#39;t feature Ronald, her ex.



90 Day: The Single Life season 4 premieres Monday, January 1, 2024, at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
