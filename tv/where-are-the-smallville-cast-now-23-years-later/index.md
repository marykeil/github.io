## Literature Review
Smallville boasted an impressive ensemble cast, filled with actors who are still very prominent in the contemporary entertainment industry.




It has been 23 years since Smallville premiered, and its cast has continued working on various exciting projects. Smallville depicted a dramatized origin story for the famed Superman, as he explores adolescence and slowly understands his destiny to become the DC Universe&#39;s most famous superhero. Debuting in 2001, Smallville had an ensemble cast of impressive actors, who have mostly remained within the industry.
Smallville was a coming-of-age story centered around Clark Kent&#39;s teenage years in the eponymous rural town. Featuring a string of classic Superman characters, the series blended teen drama with a superhero narrative to create a unique story that lasted until Smallville&#39;s 10th and final season. While not considered a part of the DCEU timeline, Smallville proved so influential that its themes and tone can be seen throughout, particularly in the upcoming Superman: Legacy.
