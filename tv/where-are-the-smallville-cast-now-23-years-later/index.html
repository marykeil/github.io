<p>It has been 23 years since Smallville premiered, and its cast has continued working on various exciting projects. Smallville depicted a dramatized origin story for the famed Superman, as he explores adolescence and slowly understands his destiny to become the DC Universe&rsquo;s most famous superhero. Debuting in 2001, Smallville had an ensemble cast of impressive actors, who have mostly remained within the industry.
Smallville was a coming-of-age story centered around Clark Kent&rsquo;s teenage years in the eponymous rural town. Featuring a string of classic Superman characters, the series blended teen drama with a superhero narrative to create a unique story that lasted until Smallville&rsquo;s 10th and final season. While not considered a part of the DCEU timeline, Smallville proved so influential that its themes and tone can be seen throughout, particularly in the upcoming Superman: Legacy.</p>
