## Literature Review
The Umbrella Academy is set to embark on its final season, and many theories are swirling about what could happen during the Umbrella&#39;s last outing.




The Umbrella Academy is set to debut its fourth and final season in 2024, and the final outing is expected to answer a lot of questions about the Umbrellas. The Netflix series based on the comics by Gerard Way began streaming in 2019, and gained popularity thanks to the intrigue, mystery, comedy, and superpowered storylines. The Umbrella Academy follows a group of six siblings (and their deceased brother who appears as a ghost), attempting to hold back the impending apocalypse that could end the world.
In the first three seasons of The Umbrella Academy, the Hargreeves siblings have stopped the end of the world twice, and experienced a major reset by their adopted father, Reginald Hareeves in the season 3 finale. However, the series has continued to raise more questions than it answers. But with the final season incoming, it&#39;s now or never for the show to answer the burning questions and see the siblings save the world one last time.









 








 10  The Umbrella Academy Will Have To Start An Apocalypse 
To Finally Save The World
        

The Umbrella Academy season 3 ended with the Hotel Oblivion revealing it was some sort of highly advanced machine designed to reset the world and create Reginald Hargreeves&#39; perfect universe. Ultimately, the Umbrellas survived the reset, but the entire universe was changed as a result of Reginald&#39;s meddling, and the new one appears to be under his control. In order to save the world, the Umbrellas may be forced to cause a new apocalypse and reset the world one more time. In doing so, they may permanently lose their powers, or even be forced to sacrifice themselves.





 9  Allison Will Be The Villain 
Turning Against Her Siblings


 







Allison has struggled over the last few seasons after losing her dream life with her husband, Ray, and her daughter, Claire. In The Umbrella Academy season 3, she fully broke down and went to extreme lengths to cause damage to her family by assaulting her brother, Luther, and killing Harlan. Having entered into her villain arc, it seems unusual that Allison was just dropped into a happy ending, with her family back and no consequences. If the rest of the Umbrellas need to reset the world to overthrow Reginald, Allison will not give up her perfect life easily, and having seen the extreme lengths she has gone to get her way, she could easily be a major villain in season 4.
            
 
 The Umbrella Academy Season 4 Wishlist: 9 Things That Need To Happen 
With The Umbrella Academy ending with its upcoming fourth season, there are some things that need to happen in the series&#39; final episodes.









 8  Another New Hero Team 
The Squirrel Academy
        

During the scene where Allison is revealed to be reset into a home where Ray and Claire are alive, there is a brief glimpse of an unusual decoration in their home featuring a squirrel. This could be a clue about a new set of superheroes that has replaced the Umbrella Academy and the Sparrows Academy in this reality. The fact that this is also included in Allison&#39;s home could indicate that she is a part of this new team, or even her partner Ray, who could have some drastic differences from the original in this reality.





 7  Reginald Planned All The Apocalypses 
To Carry Out His Masterplan


 







Reginald Hargreeves was revealed to be an alien early in the series, but not much has been developed with that plot. In fact, while Reginald has been present throughout the series, his life and origins remain mostly obscured. The season 3 finale revealed that Reginald had orchestrated a way to bring his wife back and get control over the world with his advanced technology, but it&#39;s also possible that he was behind the earlier apocalypses and coordinated the events to try and reorganize the world to suit him.





 6  Sloane Betrays Luther And The Umbrellas 
She Disappeared At The End Of Season 3
        

When the Umbrellas emerge from the Hotel Oblivion and arrive in the new reality, some notable people are missing; Allison, Reginald, and Sloane. Both Reginald and Allison are revealed to be living their dream lives, but Sloane isn&#39;t shown with the others or anywhere else. It&#39;s possible that Sloane was secretly working with Reginald to unite the families by getting Luther to fall in love with her. The Sparrow&#39;s timeline version of Ben was seen with the others, so it would be reasonable to assume that, unless something were specifically altered to have her appear elsewhere, she would have been with the rest of the group.





 5  Five And Dolores Reunite 
Love Ultimately Wins Out
        

Five is a complex character who has lived a long life exploring and protecting timelines, before being sent back in time, and with a much younger body, to stop the apocalypse. During The Umbrella Academy, Five has only been seen to have one great love in his life; Dolores, the top half of a store mannequin. Five deserves a happy ending just as the rest of his siblings do, and having him reunite with his fateful partner once again would be an important part of that for his character.
            
 
 How Will The Umbrella Academy End? 
The Umbrella Academy is ending with its upcoming season 4, but how will the Hargreeves&#39; story end? Let&#39;s take a look at what needs to happen.









 4  Five Will Die 
To Save The World For Good


 







The Umbrella Academy has focused much of its attention on the story of Five and his experiences with the Commission and returning to team up with his siblings. His time travel abilities have allowed him to put a halt to apocalypses and protect others, but he also appears to be at the center of many of these controversies, with a version of himself even founding the Commission. Considering his story is so integral to the larger narrative, it appears that Five may be the most at risk of having his story wrapped up in season 4 in a final and definite way.





 3  Ben&#39;s Death And The Jennifer Incident Will Be Revealed 
How Ben Really Died
        

One of the ongoing mysteries in the series and the comics is about how Ben died in the first place. The series dropped some hints about what might have happened in season 3 with multiple references to the &#34;Jennifer incident.&#34; It appears that both Ben in the Umbrella Universe and the Sparrows had a connection with Jennifer, but this could be where their stories split. The series making explicit reference in multiple episodes strongly indicates that this storyline is likely to be addressed in The Umbrella Academy season 4.





 2  Revisiting Reginald Hargreeves&#39; Alien Origins 
Where Did Reginald Hargreeves Come From?
        

As previously mentioned, the fact that Reginald Hargreeves is actually an alien has already been revealed in the show in season 2, episode 9. With the reveal coming so late in season 2, and season 3 tackling a new intense storyline with the Sparrows, this reveal has largely taken a backseat, but with season 4 likely to focus more on the now-living Reginald and his wife, his alien origins are likely to be further explored and explained.





 1  The Links Between Abigail And The Powered-Up Babies 
And The Marigold Particles
        

In The Umbrella Academy season 1, Reginald Hargreeves can be seen with the mysterious marigold energy, which is potentially the source of super-powered beings on Earth. These particles are likely to come from Reginald&#39;s homeworld and could be how Reginald and Abigail&#39;s species reproduce. Very little is known about their species, so it is conceivable that they have a unique way of breeding. This would explain why Reginald was so determined to track down the children, as well as how the mysterious births of dozens of children all around the world appeared to have occurred simultaneously at random. Potentially with Abigail as their true mother.
