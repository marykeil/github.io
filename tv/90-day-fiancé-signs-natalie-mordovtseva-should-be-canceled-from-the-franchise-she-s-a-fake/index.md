## SUMMARY 



  Natalie Mordovtseva&#39;s acting background raises concerns about her authenticity and motives on 90 Day Fiancé, as she may be using the show to further her acting career.   It appears that Natalie used Mike to come to the U.S. and start her acting career, as their marriage ended after only six months and she pursued other opportunities on 90 Day: The Single Life while still married.   Natalie&#39;s desperation to stay in the spotlight is evident, as she relies on the 90 Day Fiancé franchise for her success and continues to pursue suspect storylines and highlight her time on the show on social media.

## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Natalie Mordovtseva should no longer be allowed to appear in the franchise because of all of her fake behavior. 




90 Day Fiancé franchise alum Natalie Mordovtseva has displayed a lot of fake behavior that should merit her being canceled from the network. Natalie and her now-ex Mike Youngquist have gotten a lot of screen time since their appearance on 90 Day Fiancé season 7. After breaking up on season 7, where Mike spent the whole time in Ukraine, the pair were on 90 Day Fiancé season 8 after Natalie&#39;s K-1 visa was approved. Despite being estranged, Natalie still came over to America to allegedly give her relationship with Mike another shot. After a tumultuous 90 days, they tied the knot on the very last day of Natalie&#39;s visa.




Mike and Natalie went on to appear on 90 Day Fiancé: Happily Ever After? season 6, where their marriage ended after only six months. Natalie ditched Mike&#39;s native Sequim, Washington, for Florida and a bachelorette life. Even though she and Mike were still married, Natalie went on to appear on 90 Day: The Single Life season 2 and 3. Now, with 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 looming and Natalie being spotted filming throughout the last year, she will likely continue in the network despite the many red flags she presents to the show&#39;s authenticity.


 Natalie Is An Actress 
Natalie has not attempted to hide the fact that she is an actress with aspirations towards stardom. And it appears she&#39;s using 90 Day Fiancé to launch her career further. In Ukraine, Natalie acted in several Ukrainian crime shows and was also a model. Natalie has been in America since 2020, and she&#39;s since landed in LA to pursue her acting career. In September 2023, Natalie announced the launch of her U.S. acting career with a post showcasing her acting headshots.




It is a major red flag that Natalie has had dreams of acting since before she came to America. Not only does her acting background mean she could be acting for the camera on 90 Day Fiancé, but it also means that she has ulterior motives. Natalie used the show to get her where she is in her acting career and has scammed viewers by being inauthentic.



 Natalie Is In The U.S. For The Wrong Reasons 
All signs point to Natalie having used Mike to get to America and start her acting career. When they broke up during 90 Day Fiancé season 7, it was clear that Natalie and Mike were not meant for each other on multiple levels. However, Natalie pushed the relationship and weasled her way into the U.S. for the wrong reasons. Given that she and Mike didn&#39;t even last past six months of marriage, it means Natalie did not give the marriage a fair shot before bolting to pursue her selfish goals.

Natalie showed her true colors by abandoning Mike and opting to appear on two seasons of 90 Day: The Single Life while she still had the obligation of marriage. Viewers watched Natalie manipulate Mike into staying married to her so she could get a green card. She also manipulated Mike into helping her mom come to America, only not to want to have a relationship with him. She broke Mike&#39;s heart and seemed unapologetic about it as she focused on her next time in the spotlight.






 Natalie Is Desperate To Stay In the Spotlight 
Without 90 Day Fiancé, Natalie would not be where she is today. Therefore, her time in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise equates to her success, which makes her desperate to cling to the network and continue to appear in it. Natalie is a D-list celebrity at best without her 90 Day Fiancé accolade, and she must know it because she keeps subjecting the 90 Day Fiancé audience to her suspect storylines and highlights her time on the show all over Instagram.



 Natalie Has Faked Her Storylines 
Many of Natalie&#39;s storylines across the different shows have not been believable, and she&#39;s made moves online to prove her fakeness. During a Cameo to a fan, Natalie admitted that her reconnection with Mike on 90 Day: The Single Life season 3 was fake. Furthermore, Natalie&#39;s love interest, Josh Weinstein, from 90 Day: The Single Life seasons 2 and 3, lives with his real partner, a woman named Callie. Josh and Natalie have been scamming 90 Day Fiancé viewers with a fake relationship to get more air time.




Natalie has also admitted to fans that &#34;drama sells&#34; and made a comment stating, &#34;dear if I act normal I won&#39;t be on a TV show,&#34; alluding to the fact she&#39;s acting over the top. Moreover, Natalie got caught DMing with controversial Bachelorette alum Josh Seitar over creating a fake narrative between the two to be on a TV show. It is clear that Natalie fakes her storylines to be able to continue in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise and make her life more appealing for filming.



 There Are Better And Newer 90 Day Fiance Cast Members To Replace Natalie 
         

Instead of continuing to give Natalie valuable 90 Day Fiancé attention, the network should be focusing on all the new and better cast members whom viewers want to watch more of. Natalie&#39;s personality is played out within the franchise, and she is a dark cloud on the show because of how fake she is. Giving more realistic cast members and situations a chance in the limelight would greatly benefit the show and make it more appealing in terms of authenticity. Natalie needs to be canceled from appearing in further shows and seasons in the 90 Day Fiancé network because she has ulterior motives that sour the point of the show.




Unfortunately, the 90 Day Fiancé franchise has a habit of beating a dead horse by continuously bringing back cast members viewers don&#39;t want to see. Like Elizabeth Potthast and Andrei Castravet, Angela Deem, or Loren and Alexei Brovarnik, Natalie has stayed in the 90 Day Fiancé spotlight far longer than she should have, given her fakeness and predictability. While official news of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 has not been announced, it is clear that the show would be doing viewers a disservice by having Natalie and her fakeness on the show once again.



90 Day Fiancé season 10 airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EDT on TLC.
