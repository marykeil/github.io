## Literature Review

Although April Kirkwood&#39;s fun personality shone on The Golden Bachelor, her time on the show was short. Here are some details about her.




April Kirkwood made her reality TV debut on The Golden Bachelor as one of the oldest contestants. April made an instant impact on The Golden Bachelor fans during her introduction when she stepped out of the limo carrying a basket of eggs to pay homage to her hometown, Ohio. April, who had lost her partner of two decades, Ralph, in 2021, appeared on the show hoping to fall in love again by trying to win The Golden Bachelor Gerry Turner&#39;s heart. April&#39;s antics on the show, which included faking an injury to seek attention during a pickleball game and redecorating the sleeping quarters at night, make her one of the entertaining contestants.




However, despite her playfulness, April could not make a connection with Gerry, and she was eventually eliminated from the show in week four. After April&#39;s exit from the inaugural season of The Golden Bachelor, April spoke about her time on the show, revealing that she was glad not to have made a connection with Gerry. April accused Gerry of looking past her during their discussions on the show and that it deeply hurt her how The Golden Bachelor lead ignored her without giving a reason for the snub.
