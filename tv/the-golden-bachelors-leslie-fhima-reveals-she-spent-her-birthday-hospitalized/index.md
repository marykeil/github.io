## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima reveals that she spent her 65th birthday on December 28 in an unexpected way - in the hospital.




The Golden Bachelor runner-up Leslie Fhima revealed that she spent her 65th birthday on December 28 in the hospital because she had unexpected surgery for a bowel blockage. Bachelor Nation first met Leslie when she stole Gerry Turner&#39;s heart on The Golden Bachelor. Even though they fell in love with each other, Gerry chose to get engaged to Theresa Nist in the end, leaving Leslie blindsided and heart-broken. However, there has been much speculation that Leslie might be the first-ever lead of The Golden Bachelorette, when ABC finally announces the show.




In an Instagram story posted from her hospital bed on New Year&#39;s Eve, Leslie shared her story. She said, &#34;I know that everyone was just curious to know what I did on my 65th birthday. I spent it in the hospital. Yes, I had a bowl blockage, severe cramping, came into the ER.&#34; Leslie revealed that the doctors saw that she had a blockage and needed surgery. She explained that it was &#34;just something so random. Actually, scar tissue from an appendectomy I had when I was 18 years old.&#34; Leslie then told fans, &#34;if you have severe stomach issues, don&#39;t wait 12 hours to go to the hospital like I did.&#34;

 Will Leslie Fhima Attend The Golden Wedding? 
          




Leslie concluded her video by wishing her followers a happy new year, and stating that she thought she&#39;d be getting out of the hospital that day after being there since Wednesday morning. She added that she was &#34;very excited&#34; to go home to her dog. Because she&#39;ll be recovering from her surgery, it&#39;s unclear if Leslie will be able to travel for Gerry and Theresa&#39;s wedding, which will air live on ABC on Thursday, January 4. Theresa said on the Bachelor Happy Hour podcast that she&#39;d invite Leslie to the wedding, but she was unsure if she&#39;d go. Gerry added that he&#39;d feel comfortable with Leslie being there, but it would be up to her.


 

Leslie became a Golden Bachelor fan favorite from the moment she stepped out of the limousine in a costume of an old woman with a gray wig, housedress, and a walker. When she revealed her actual dress, Gerry was thrilled. Leslie continued to captivate Gerry with her sexy and sweet personality, from a sensual dance routine in the talent show to sharing that she wears hearing aids like him. She was adventurous on their dates, riding ATVs and rappelling. However, it was Leslie&#39;s vulnerable side and her willingness to open up her heart to the possibility of new love after being hurt in the past, that really made everyone fall in love with her.




Leslie has had a difficult week, but hopefully she was able to ring in the new year at home. She&#39;ll definitely need some time to rest and recover from her surgery, so it&#39;s unclear if she&#39;ll attend the Golden Bachelor Golden Wedding. However, after everything that happened, it&#39;s possible that she might not want to go to the wedding anyway, and watch her ex-boyfriend get married on national television. Leslie is wished all the best for a speedy recovery. Hopefully, there will be a Golden Bachelorette announcement soon, with Leslie as the lead.
