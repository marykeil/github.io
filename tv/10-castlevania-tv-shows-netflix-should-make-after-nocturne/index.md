 10  Soma Cruz And Genya Arikado 
Castlevania: Aria Of Sorrow


 







Soma Cruz and Genya Arikado, central characters in the Castlevania universe, present an ideal narrative opportunity for a Netflix series. As Dracula&#39;s reincarnation, Soma wields the &#34;Power of Dominance,&#34; empowering him to control the souls of defeated monsters. Soma&#39;s journey explores his struggle with identity and destiny. The potential series could delve into encounters with characters like Graham Jones, a deranged missionary, and Arikado, who turns out to be Alucard. Soma&#39;s internal battle against Dracula&#39;s influence and the quest to avoid becoming the dark lord offer thematic richness. This proposed Netflix series would promise a fresh perspective on the eternal struggle against darkness, fueled by power, destiny, and self-discovery.





 9  Gabriel Belmont And The Brotherhood Of Light 
Castlevania: Lords of Shadow


 







Gabriel Belmont&#39;s saga tells a harrowing story that deserves adaptation into a Netflix original series. The story introduces Gabriel as a member of the Brotherhood of Light on a quest to defeat the malevolent Lords of Shadow and resurrect his wife. As Gabriel’s insurmountable loss and conflict with former friend, Mathias Cronqvist begins to whittle away at the holy knight’s commitment to righteousness, he gradually transforms into something he never expected. While Dracula has yet to be seen in Castlevania: Nocturne thus far, his origin story, Gabriel&#39;s tragic past, and its harrowing battles could provide compelling lore for the Castlevania universe against the backdrop of a visually spectacular Netflix production.





 8  Simon Belmont 
Castlevania
        

The original Castlevania vampire hunter, Simon Belmont, deserves his own Netflix series to explore the depth of his legendary status fully. Simon&#39;s story crosses several generations, offering plenty of material for Netflix to work with, and captures fights against the undead Dracula as well as the enduring Belmont heritage. An intricate portrayal of his unwavering pursuit, the curse that befell him, and the search for Dracula&#39;s remains are just a few major events the series could cover. Simon&#39;s story could be fleshed out in a way that simply wasn&#39;t possible with the technology of his era, making it a great way to pay homage to the character&#39;s historical gaming significance.





 7  Leon Belmont 
Castlevania: Lament of Innocence
        

Leon Belmont&#39;s rich narrative weaves a compelling tale deserving of a Netflix series. The story begins with Leon, an indomitable baron, and his strategic friend Mathias. The sudden death of Mathias&#39;s wife propels them into a dark world filled with monsters linked to a vampire named Walter. Denied Church support, Leon forsakes his title to confront Walter, guided by the alchemist Rinaldo. Along with capturing the origin of the iconic Vampire Killer whip, which goes on to be used by virtually every Belmont thereafter, a Netflix series could intricately explore Leon&#39;s journey, emphasizing his internal struggles, friendship dynamics, and the genesis of the Belmont legacy.





 6  Shanoa And The Order Of Ecclesia 
Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia
        

Shanoa and the Order of Ecclesia have always needed their own Netflix series. From the start, Shanoa is a resolute and unwavering fighter who serves as a vessel for the formidable Dominus to battle Dracula. After being betrayed by her adoptive brother Albus, she sets out to confront the evil forces at work and free the villagers who have been taken prisoner. Shanoa&#39;s journey provides a profound examination of sacrifice, atonement, and the struggle against inner darkness, further characterized by her forgotten memories and the burden of being Dominus&#39; vessel. A Netflix series could explore the intricate story, highlighting Shanoa&#39;s resourcefulness, emotional challenges, and the mysterious Order of Ecclesia.





 5  Jonathan Morris 
Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin
        

Jonathan Morris, the vampire hunter who becomes the heir to Belmont legacy, deserves a Netflix series for his unique journey in the Castlevania universe. Jonathan inherits the legendary Vampire Killer whip, setting out to thwart the vampire artist Brauner&#39;s apocalyptic plans alongside his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin. His complex relationship with his father, John Morris, adds layers to his character, as he grapples with feelings of resentment and eventually gains a profound appreciation for his heritage. Jonathan&#39;s adventures, marked by friendship, betrayal, and legacy, offer a fresh perspective on the Castlevania lore, making him an ideal candidate for an immersive Netflix adaptation.

 4  Demon Castle War: Battle of 1999 
First Mentioned In Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow
        

The Demon Castle War, a monumental conflict in the Castlevania universe, emerges as a compelling narrative that needs its own series. Set in 1999, this fictional war culminates in Count Dracula’s complete annihilation. Despite its gravitas, details of the conflict have only been mentioned briefly in a few of the games in the franchise. Julius Belmont, Alucard, and enigmatic characters like Saint Germain were central figures, meaning changes would have to be made considering what the show has already done. With elements of prophecy, sacrifice, and the sealing of Dracula&#39;s Castle, the Demon Castle War promises a rich, unexplored storytelling terrain, making it an ideal candidate for an immersive Netflix adaptation.





 3  Sonia Belmont 
Castlevania Legends
        

Sonia Belmont is a trailblazing vampire huntress who deserves a Netflix series for her pivotal role in Castlevania&#39;s rich lore. As the first member of the esteemed Belmont Clan, Sonia&#39;s unique ability to sense unseen spiritual beings sets the stage for a captivating narrative. Trained by her grandfather, armed with a whip, Sonia embarks on a quest against Count Dracula&#39;s forces after a tragic attack on her village. Although Sonia&#39;s journey is not considered canon, her journey features intriguing encounters with Alucard along with a decisive battle with Dracula. A Netflix series exploring Sonia&#39;s origins and the Belmont-Dracula feud promises a compelling and untold chapter in the Castlevania universe.





 2  Christopher And Soleil Belmont 
Castlevania Adventures
        

Christopher and Soleil Belmont&#39;s story offers a distinctive and captivating storyline within the Castlevania universe, making them prime candidates for a Netflix series. Christopher engages in a one-man battle against Count Dracula, achieving victory and establishing himself as a legendary hero in the late 1600s. Dracula&#39;s survival and subsequent manipulation of Christopher’s son, Soleil, create a harrowing conflict, leading to Christopher&#39;s quest to save his son and ultimately destroy Dracula again. The familial bond, generational legacy, and the unique challenges faced by both father and son make Christopher and Soleil&#39;s tale a rich and distinctive addition to the Castlevania lore, worthy of exploration in a Netflix series.





 1  Saint Germain And The Infinite Corridor 
Castlevania: Curse of Darkness


 







Saint Germain has already been introduced as a supporting character in the first Castlevania series, but his enigmatic personality along with his connection to the Infinite Corridor could present an interesting opportunity as its own Netflix series. Saint Germain&#39;s time manipulation could be further explored, especially against adversaries like Zead. Despite not being a true villain, his perplexing nature and ambiguous words create an intriguing character dynamic, enriched by historical references and ties to other time watchers. Additionally, the Infinite Corridor introduces a visually striking alternate realm with floating platforms and Dullahan encounters, promising a Netflix series about historical exploration and visiting other dimensions, enhancing the Castlevania universe.
Castlevania and Castlevania: Nocturne are both streaming on Netflix.
