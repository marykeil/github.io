Summary

  Fool Me Once&#39;s shocking ending generated a huge response online, with author Harlan Coben calling the reactions &#34;a thrill.&#34;   Coben expresses satisfaction at the way the ending of the show came together.   While Fool Me Once has generated a strong response online, not all of the responses have been positive, with the show not quite hitting the same highs as other Coben adaptations like The Stranger or Safe.  







Fool Me Once author Harlan Coben responds to the enthusiastic audience reactions to the ending of his latest Netflix adaptation. Following The Stranger, Safe, The Woods, and Stay  , Coben&#39;s books continue to make for popular Netflix shows, with the latest hitting the service on January 1. Michelle Keegan leads the Fool Me Once cast as Maya, with the story following the character as she investigates her late husband&#39;s mysterious appearance on her child&#39;s nannycam, with the series&#39; finale featuring some shocking developments and reveals.

Now, during a recent interview with RadioTimes.com, Coben celebrates the responses that the Fool Me Once ending has generated online. After a series of surprising twists, turns, and revelations, the finale sees Maya confront the Burkett family for their crimes, with Neil (James Northcote) ultimately grabbing her gun and killing her. The act, however, was caught on a nannycam that had been set up earlier, and this twist has elicited a range of responses from viewers. Check out Coben&#39;s reaction to the response below:





&#34;It’s a thrill. I don’t think I’ve ever seen this much response, even with The Stranger or Stay  , Safe – this much of the population just embracing the show.
&#34;It’s been kind of a marvel to watch, and yeah, the ending, I love that people are getting caught up in that.
&#34;When I wrote the book, I remember when I came up with the idea of the ending, I was like, &#39;That’s really twisted, can I pull that off?&#39; and I think we did - I think for the show, we did. I’m really happy with it.&#34;

 Is Fool Me Once The Best Harlan Coben Netflix Show? 
          




Judging from the sheer number of Coben adaptations now on Netflix, the author&#39;s work has made for reliable miniseries material for the streamer. Regardless of their critical reception, most of the shows spend at least some time on the Netflix Top 10 charts, with audiences evidently finding plenty to enjoy about the author&#39;s mysteries. While Fool Me Once has been very popular on the streamer, however, its reviews aren&#39;t as strong as other Coben adaptations.

 Title  RT Critics Score  RT Audience Score   Fool Me Once  75%  49%   The Stranger  92%  75%   Safe  71%  75%   Stay    92%  52%   The Woods  89%  59%   



Fool Me Once&#39;s Rotten Tomatoes critics&#39; score is a respectable 75%, but the audience score is a fairly disappointing 49%. A general trend in the negative user reviews is that the show, at a certain point, just isn&#39;t believable, with characters not behaving in logical ways. Although the response to the show has been lively and widespread, the nature of the response suggests the storytelling has been a little more frustrating this time around.




The best Coben adaptation will, of course, be a matter of personal preference, but Fool Me Once doesn&#39;t quite hit the same highs as The Stranger or Safe. Both of those hit Netflix shows, released in 2022 and 2018, respectively, seem to present more compelling and believable mysteries overall, and both enjoy stronger user scores on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. Love it or hate it, though, Fool Me Once has evidently managed to strike at the perfect time, and online chatter about the surprising ending has surely only contributed to its popularity.
