## Literature Review

From Geralt of Rivia to Aragorn to Captain Jack Sparrow, these characters are the most skillful sword fighters in movies and television. 




There&#39;s nothing quite like a sword fight, displaying a tense yet elegant form of combat between highly skilled adversaries, and some film and television characters stand out in their talent with the blade. An excellent sword duel feels as interpersonal as fist fights and as exhilarating as a shootout. From fencing foils to samurai katanas to Roman gladii, movies and shows have depicted great fighters of varying skill sets.
While there&#39;s no crossover in the works that will see the likes of Captain Jack Sparrow and Ser Arthur Dayne facing off in sword combat, their skill can be interpreted by their feats and training. Many of film and television&#39;s best sword fighters have fought off armies of foes or other great warriors, and world-renowned masters have trained many. While the sword skill is more important than a character&#39;s superhuman powers, those powers are still factored in as they matter relative to the world the character exists in.

 10  Jack Sparrow 
Pirates of the Caribbean
        

  Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  
PG-13



  Release Date    July 9, 2003     Director    Gore Verbinski     Cast    Orlando Bloom , Jack Davenport , Geoffrey Rush , Johnny Depp , Keira Knightley     Runtime    143 minutes    


Captain Jack Sparrow is best known for his humor, wit, and charisma, and his antics often prevent him from his full combat potential. However, Sparrow can compete with almost anyone when he&#39;s not messing around. He may not be able to compete in a chivalrous tournament, as a lot of his strength comes from being a willingly dirty fighter. In a matter of life or death, Jack Sparrow is worth considering as a fighter, though he may not have the skillset as more formally trained swordsmen.

 9  Maximus 
Gladiator


 







  Gladiator  
R



  Release Date    May 1, 2000     Director    Ridley Scott     Cast    Russell Crowe , Derek Jacobi , Oliver Reed , Connie Nielsen , Joaquin Phoenix , Djimon Hounsou , Richard Harris     Runtime    155 minutes    


Formally a Roman general, Maximus is enslaved and forced to fight in the gladiator arena in hopes of winning his freedom. In a brutal sport where fighters run the risk of death, Maximus stands out for his immense skill. He&#39;s a tough, gritty fighter who uses his physicality to face off better-equipped foes, and he&#39;s more skilled than highly trained warriors like Emperor Commodus himself. Maximus&#39; years of battle experience set him apart from other well-trained fighters, as he knows how to utilize tactics and his environment to survive.





 8  Arthur Dayne 
Game of Thrones
        

  Game Of Thrones  
Drama
Action
Adventure



  Release Date    April 11, 2011     Cast    Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage     Seasons    8    


Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, may not get to showcase his skillset much in Game of Thrones, as he&#39;s only shown in visions of Robert&#39;s Rebellion. Before his death, the young knight was one of the most skilled fighters the Seven Kingdoms had ever seen, portrayed in the TV series to be dual-wielding blades. Arthur is the best swordfighter in Game of Thrones, praised unanimously by swordsmen such as Jaime Lannister and Ned Stark.





 7  The Bride 
Kill Bill
        

  Kill Bill  
R



  Release Date    October 10, 2003     Director    Quentin Tarantino     Cast    David Carradine , Michael Madsen , Uma Thurman , Daryl Hannah , Lucy Liu , Vivica A. Fox     Runtime    111 minutes    


In terms of skillful swordplay, it&#39;s hard to top the Bride from Quentin Tarantino&#39;s Kill Bill films. Rather than the brute strength of a character like Maximus, the Bride&#39;s skill comes from years of delicate practice, traveling the world to train under different masters. The Crazy 88 scene is one of the most insane sword-fighting scenes in fictional media, with her skill on full display against waves of enemies. The heightened reality of Tarantino&#39;s world gives the Bride an edge, as she&#39;s essentially capable of crazy stunts he can imagine.





 6  Achilles 
Troy
        

Depicted in Greek Mythology as being immortal aside from his heel, the film Troy leaves Achilles&#39; partial immortality vague. Instead, Brad Pitt&#39;s version of the character is an immensely fierce and skilled warrior and leader. The sword fight between Achilles and Hector is one of the most epic movie sword fights, showcasing his talent against the best of the Trojans. Achilles is as close to god-like as movie characters come, but his fighting style relies heavily on the use of his shield, compared to other sword-wielders.





 5  Sanjuro 
Yojimbo
        

One of Toshiro Mifune&#39;s characters had to make the cut, as he&#39;s played some of the most prolific samurai in film. In Yojimbo and the companion film Sanjuro, some of the best samurai movies of all time, Mifune plays a wandering ronin who&#39;s considered a master sword fighter. The character who inspired Clint Eastwood&#39;s Western hero, &#34;Man with No Name,&#34; the samurai of Akira Kurosawa&#39;s films, is one of the most well-choreographed swordsmen in films, relying solely on talent and practice with blade to defeat twisted gang members.





 4  Zorro 
The Zorro Franchise
In terms of the most skilled sword matches in film history, the duel in the 1940 classic The Mark of Zorro is one of the most well-performed in film history. While the foil may not compare against the strength of Achilles or Geralt of Rivia, Zorro is undoubtedly one of the most skilled duelists of his style. In various interpretations, Zorro has been played by multiple actors and stunt performers who portray his skill level in different ways, but he&#39;s always an extremely talented fighter.





 3  Geralt Of Rivia 
The Witcher 
  The Witcher  
Adventure
Drama
Action
Fantasy



  Release Date    December 20, 2019     Cast    Tom Canton , Maciej Musial , BjÃ¶rn Hlynur Haraldsson , Anna Shaffer , MyAnna Buring , Lars Mikkelsen , Royce Pierreson , Eamon Farren , Wilson Radjou-Pujalte , Joey Batey , Jodhi May , Therica Wilson-Read , Anya Chalotra , Mimi Ndiweni , Henry Cavill , Freya Allan , Adam Levy , Amit Shah , Liam Hemsworth , Laurence Fishburne     Seasons    2    


Geralt of Rivia&#39;s Witcher abilities make him a threatening force, and his skill in slaying deadly, sometimes enormous monsters gives him unique experience. Even without his use of magical signs, the enhanced strength and reflex powers from being a Witcher make him a terrifying swordsman. In just the show&#39;s first episode, he&#39;s seen fighting outnumbered, taking out a gang of bandits, earning him the nickname &#34;The Butcher of Blaviken,&#34; which carries a weight of fear among those in his world. He may not be as skilled with the blade as other fighters, but his enhancements make up for it.





 2  Aragorn 
The Lord of the Rings


 







  The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring  
PG-13



  Release Date    December 19, 2001     Director    Peter Jackson     Cast    Elijah Wood , Ian McKellen , Liv Tyler , Viggo Mortensen , Sean Astin , Cate Blanchett , John Rhys-Davies , Billy Boyd , Dominic Monaghan , Orlando Bloom , Christopher Lee , Hugo Weaving , Sean Bean , Ian Holm , Andy Serkis     Runtime    178 Minutes    


While Aragorn arguably has significant plot armor that allows him to survive in battle against overwhelming odds, these feats can&#39;t be taken from the Lord of the Rings trilogy warrior. He&#39;s incredibly proficient with the longsword, with a history of over 60 years of combat, including fighting dangerous and giant beasts. Aragorn is one of the most powerful Lord of the Rings characters, known for being a legendary warrior and leader.





 1  Shu Lien 
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
        

The advantage of Wuxia powers certainly benefits Shu Lien in Ang Lee&#39;s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as the genre depicts martial arts warriors with superhuman strength, speed, and more. Shu Lien is a graceful and highly trained warrior who possesses abilities to enhance her swordplay. She has the perfect balance of skillful training and superpowered advantage, making her the most powerful sword wielder in film and television.
