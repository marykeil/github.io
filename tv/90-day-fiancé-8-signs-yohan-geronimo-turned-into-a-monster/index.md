## Literature Review
Daniele Gates from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way has finally realized that Yohan Geronimo is not &#34;human.&#34; Yohan&#39;s true colors have started to show.




Yohan Geronimo’s wife and 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way costar, Daniele Gates, has realized that the man she married is not who she thought he was. Yohan debuted on reality TV in 2022 and has been a part of multiple spin-offs with Daniele. Yohan was the man of Daniele’s dreams despite him being a foot taller and 10 years younger than her. Their age and cultural differences tested their relationship. Daniele had rose-tinted glasses on when they met, and she began worrying that he was only marrying her to move to the U.S.
Daniele got a lot of hate for emasculating Yohan more than once. It led fans to root for Yohan as they watched Daniele promise to take Yohan to America but didn’t. However, Yohan got what he deserved because he tricked them into believing he was the victim. All Yohan wanted in life was a sugar mama. Even her friends could tell that Yohan was using Daniele for money and to move to the U.S. Yohan made it look like he was doing Daniele a favor by being with her when he kept abusing her emotionally. Daniele let Yohan get away with it for a while until she finally saw Yohan&#39;s true colors.

 8  Yohan Married Daniele For A Green Card 
Daniele Wanted His To Get A Tourist Visa Instead


 







Yohan had always complained about Daniele supporting him financially, but in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5, episode 12, Yohan revealed why he had married Daniele. While working out at the gym with his cousin Alberto, Yohan explained that Daniele had promised him a good life, but it wasn’t happening. He didn’t want to live in a rented apartment for the rest of his life and expected Daniele to give him the “good life” she promised. Yohan groaned that all he got from Daniele a year after their wedding was a dog. “What is that ring good for?” Alberto had asked Yohan.
“I married an American woman to stay here and have nothing? That&#39;s like a horror story,” he told the cameras. When Daniele took Yohan to an immigration lawyer to discuss his different visa options to come to New York, Yohan kept mentioning the “green card” to Daniele. Meanwhile, Daniele wanted Yohan to apply for a tourist visa. He thought Daniele was selfish because, according to Yohan, a “man with an American wife” deserved a visa. Daniele believed that applying for a green card required an unbelievable amount of commitment and trust, which she didn’t have at the time.





 7  Yohan Wanted To Take Advantage Of His American Wife 
Yohan Had A Backup Plan After Daniele 
        

Daniele went to the Dominican Republic and promised Yohan they would move to the U.S. for a better life, only to take it away from him. Yohan wanted to get a job and make good money in America so he could send it to his family. She told Yohan she had started the visa paperwork while knowing she never intended to do so. The relationship was transactional from the start, and Daniele started to see it. However, as soon as Yohan realized he was not going to get things done his way, he checked out of the relationship. Yohan had a backup plan if Daniele left him anyway. 





 6  Yohan Didn&#39;t Like Daniele&#39;s Friendship With Her Ex-Boyfriend 
Daniele Met Up With Ex Taylen


The resentment that Yohan started to feel towards Daniele when she moved to the DR for good grew when she told him about her ex-boyfriend Taylen Alexander. Yohan did not believe in being friends with exes, even though he was having multiple affairs behind Daniele’s back. She made the mistake of telling Yohan about her ex Taylen visiting her in the Dominican Republic. She asked Yohan for permission to meet Taylen, and Yohan didn’t agree to it. Yohan insulted Daniele during their meeting with Taylen and drove her to tears by asking Taylen questions about their intimate life together.
He asked for Taylen’s shoe size and then said, “Daniele likes men with big penises.” Daniele laughed at first but realized Yohan wanted to compare his sizes with Taylen&#39;s. Yohan didn’t let go of the awkward questions even when Taylen was visibly uncomfortable answering them. Yohan then threatened to break up with Daniele during The Other Way&#39;s season 4 Tell All when he saw Taylen was with her on set.





 5  Yohan Pushed Daniele To Have A Baby 
Daniele Wanted To Go To A Fertility Clinic


 







Yohan wanted Daniele to have a baby, naturally, even though he was aware of her age and the problems that came with it. Daniele said they had tried to conceive a baby ever since they got married. Yohan used to get excited every time Daniele exhibited some sort of pregnancy symptom. &#34;I don&#39;t know how many more months I can do that,&#34; Daniele cried. She suggested they try visiting a fertility clinic even though Yohan was religious and didn’t want to get scientific help in having a child. While they discussed the process of choosing an egg donor, Daniele backed out when she discovered how much it would cost.





 4  Yohan Stole Money From Daniele&#39;s Bank Account 
He Took $168 And Lied About It 
        

Yohan said he wanted the life of a king in the DR. When Daniele refused to give him the money that he expected, he started taking it himself. Daniele found out that Yohan made several ATM transactions from her bank account without her permission. She asked him about it several times, but he kept denying it. Daniele didn’t mind that Yohan had withdrawn $168, but what bothered her was him saying no when she asked him if he had taken it. Daniele said she was “scared” of Yohan, so she gave him an ultimatum. Daniele told Yohan that she would be requiring money from Yohan at the start of every month.





 3  Yohan Refused To Pay For Household Expenses 
He Had Money Coming In From His Mistresses
        

Daniele wanted Yohan to pay his half of the household expenses. &#34;If you don’t want to pay that, you need to live at your mom’s house,” she told Yohan. &#34;I&#39;m not paying a dime of rent,&#34; Yohan was seen telling Daniele in a later episode. Daniele asked Yohan to pay 75,000 pesos for their rent in January, but Yohan claimed he had nothing left. Yohan was lying because he was getting a steady flow of money through his mistresses. However, he wanted to make Daniele look guilty as he complained, “You said we&#39;ll have a good life. And you said I&#39;d get my papers. I don&#39;t have s**t.”





 2  Yohan Tried To Steal Daniele&#39;s Dog 
Daniele Cried When Yohan Tried To Take Their Dog


Daniele told Yohan that he didn’t love her the way she loved him. She accused him of wanting a car and a house but not a wife. Yohan replied, “This relationship isn&#39;t going anywhere,” and decided he wasn’t going to stay with Daniele anymore. Yohan decided to move into his mother’s place. As Daniele stopped him from packing things she had paid for, Yohan decided he wanted their dog Gizmo because he bought him. Daniele screamed as she tried to grab Gizmo from Yohan. She cried, &#34;Give me the dog! You’re not human!”





 1  Yohan Had Affairs With Several Women 
Yohan Was Speaking With Six Women


 







A month after Yohan officially moved out of the apartment, a woman wrote to Daniele on social media to inform her that she had been in a relationship with Yohan for over two years. The woman wanted to know when Daniele would divorce Yohan and told Daniele she was giving money to Yohan and his family. Yohan left his computer behind when he left, and Daniele discovered Yohan was speaking to six different women. He had reached out to these women to ask for money, had video conversations with them, and even made plans to meet some of them.
