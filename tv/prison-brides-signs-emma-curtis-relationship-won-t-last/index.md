## Literature Review

Prison Brides season 1 features UK postal worker Emma, who travels to the US to marry inmate Curtis. Can the career criminal change his ways?




Prison Brides season 1 recently premiered on Lifetime with seven couples, including Emma and Curtis. The show follows seven international women from around the world who have found love in the most unlikely places: American prisons. The show documents these women&#39;s journeys to the United States to meet and marry the American federal prisoners they&#39;ve fallen in love with. These men are all in prison for violent crimes, ranging from carjacking to armed robbery to second-degree murder.




Like the other couples that Prison Brides season 1 follows, Emma and Curtis met through an online pen pal program and ended up falling in love. In the first episode of the series, Emma&#39;s parents express their concerns before she comes to the U.S. to marry Curtis. Erin endures the judgment of friends and family as she risks it all to be with the man she loves. Will Curtis be able to be the man Emma needs, or will he continue a life of crime?

 Emma Lives In The UK &amp; Was To Quick To Marry Curtis 
          

Emma is a postal worker from London, England. After a bad experience with an abusive romantic partner, Emma was closed off to finding love again. This was when she started corresponding with Curtis, who was serving a prison sentence in the U.S. Feeling that she could be open and honest with Curtis, the couple ended up having a strong connection. With Curtis preparing to be released from prison in 2023, he and Emma decided to get married while he was still incarcerated, as this could improve Curtis&#39;s chances of securing a UK passport. The couple&#39;s plan is for Curtis to move to the UK with Emma.






 Curtis Has A Long Criminal History 

 

Curtis has a long history of criminal activity. According to Starcasm, in 2016, he was arraigned on charges related to prostitution, including one count of prostitution, one count of conspiracy to commit prostitution, and one count of being a habitual offender. When he met Emma, he was serving a seven-year sentence from 2018 for his involvement in a carjacking and the possession of a firearm. The case is unusual because the person who Curtis carjacked and pointed a gun at was his cousin. Curtis is eager to prove that he is a changed man who won&#39;t go back to jail, like fellow Prison Brides castmate Michael.



 Emma And Curtis Aren&#39;t Compatible 
          




Emma is determined to marry Curtis, but it seems to be due to her personality rather than true love. During the first episode of Prison Brides, her parents admitted that Emma is a stubborn person with a history of doing the opposite of what she&#39;s told. Her marriage to a career criminal appears to be a symptom of this personality trait. Emma walks straight and narrow; she even works for the government, while Curtis is a career criminal with a violent past. The two have nothing in common and shouldn&#39;t get married.



Prison Brides airs Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. EST on Lifetime.
