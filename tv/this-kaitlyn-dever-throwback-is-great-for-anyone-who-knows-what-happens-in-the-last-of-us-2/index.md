Kaitlyn Dever will be playing Abby in The Last of Us season 2, with a hilarious image from the actor&#39;s past making the rounds since this casting announcement. Many fans of The Last of Us have been posting a picture of Kaitlyn Dever swinging a golf club in her backyard, with this coming from the Last Man Standing episode &#34;Vanessa Fixes Up Eve.&#34; While she had no idea she would be playing Abby when the episode was released in 2015, it foreshadowed her future role in a hilarious way.

Abby has always been associated with golf clubs since The Last of Us Part II was released, as that is the weapon she uses to kill Joel. Early in the game, The Last of Us protagonist Joel Miller has an encounter with Abby, with this moment ending with Abby brutally beating his head in with a golf club. While tragic, this moment has become a meme in The Last of Us fanbase, which is why this Kaitlyn Dever image is so funny.

If The Last of Us season 2 does end up following Abby&#39;s golf club moment from the games, it is sure to be a brutal introduction to the character.
