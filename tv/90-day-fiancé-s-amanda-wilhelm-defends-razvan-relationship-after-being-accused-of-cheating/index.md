## Literature Review
Amanda Wilhelm gets slammed for posting a heartbreaking video about her late husband by 90 Day Fiancé fans who are accusing her of cheating on Jason.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Amanda Wilhelm cleared up rumors about her and Razvan Ciocoi&#39;s dating timeline after being accused of cheating on her late husband Jason Wilhelm. Amanda is a 31-year-old widow from Eunice, Louisiana, who was first seen in Before the 90 Days season 6 with Romanian boyfriend Razvan, 26. Mom of two Amanda was grieving the loss of her husband Jason after he died suddenly due to ampullary cancer when she seemingly met Razvan on TikTok. Amanda found Razvan&#39;s personality to be silly and endearing, and within a few months, she was on her way to see him in person.




In the end, Amanda and Razvan split because he wanted to focus on his career. However, some 90 Day Fiancé fans are still confused about their relationship timeline. Recently, Amanda opened up about being a single and widowed mom, and replied to fans to clarify her situation.


 

A fan in her comments section mocked Amanda by writing, &#34;Girl...no comment,&#34; and accused her of dating Razvan while she was still married to Jason and then talking to someone else while she was with Razvan. &#34;I was not speaking to anyone while my late husband was alive. I met Razvan after,&#34; Amanda replied.

 Amanda Wilhelm Admits Being Widowed Single Mom Was “Hardest Thing” Ever 
          

Amanda also told them, &#34;I was also never talking to anyone while I was with Razvan.” She admitted that being a single mother and widow was the &#34;hardest thing&#34; ever. During the Before the 90 Days season 6 Tell-All, Amanda revealed she broke up with Razvan just a few weeks after coming back to America. As per Amanda, Razvan was too focused on himself and his career. However, Amanda&#39;s sister Ashley knew the real reason behind the couple&#39;s split. Her sister told the cast and audience that Amanda had been talking to someone on social media behind Razvan&#39;s back. She said that Amanda was being “flirtatious” with “one main guy.&#34;

Razvan didn&#39;t want her communicating with him, and he didn&#39;t know Amanda was being flirty with the man. There were rumors that Amanda was seeing a TikToker named Cody Alvers, but neither Cody nor Amanda confirmed them. Meanwhile, Razvan did express a desire to date Amanda again after he came to America on a tourist visa. Amanda hadn&#39;t told Razvan that she was already talking to someone else because she didn&#39;t want him to feel bad. This is why Amanda&#39;s post about how she handled grief after Jason&#39;s death has come under fire. Amanda claims that she allowed herself to get involved with someone else soon after because she couldn’t deal with his death.




Razvan is currently touring America. He has been sharing photos and videos from his adventures in New York. There seems to be little to no chance that Amanda and Razvan will get together during his trip because of what has happened in their past. Razvan eventually plans to move to the U.S. for good to focus on his acting career. His popularity might result in him being cast in a new show after 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. It will be interesting to see how Razvan and Amanda&#39;s lives fare next, considering both of them are probably single now.
