And Just Like That… season 2, episode 1 ushers in a new romantic chapter for Carrie, as she finds herself entwined with Franklyn, her charismatic podcast producer. This relationship marks a significant step for Carrie, who is still treading the waters of grief and healing after the loss of her husband, Mr. Big. Franklyn represents not just a new love interest, but a symbol of Carrie&#39;s resilience and her willingness to explore the complexities of love after loss. Their interactions, infused with a mix of trepidation and excitement, illustrate the delicate dance of moving forward while honoring the past.
However, while a hopeful step towards rediscovering intimacy, Carrie&#39;s journey with Franklyn is extremely casual. Their relationship solely consists of an &#34;every-Thursday&#34; hook-up, and Carrie becomes uncomfortable when Franklyn invites her to a social event. Carrie&#39;s internal struggles are on full display as she navigates new romances. Her character, once known for her adventurous spirit in love, now approaches romance with a more reserved and measured demeanor. The dynamics with Franklyn challenge Carrie to confront her fears and insecurities about her romantic life, setting the stage for a storyline that is as much about self-discovery as it is about romance.

Miranda Hobbes&#39; relocation to Los Angeles in And Just Like That… season 2 is a bold leap into a new chapter of her life.

Lisa&#39;s husband doesn&#39;t help the situation when he offers to write her a check for the same sum as the grant she&#39;s applying for, which he only offered to her so she could stay home with the kids. The misguided gesture totally undermines Lisa&#39;s work ethic and implies that Herbert believes his work is more important than Lisa&#39;s.
