## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way&#39;s Brandan Denuccio and Mary Demasu-ay have sparked split rumors with cryptic social media posts in the last few months.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way couple Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay revealed whether they are still together after having their first baby. Brandan and Mary, both 23, had met on a dating app over two years ago. The couple started talking and Mary suggested they could get on an endless video call. However, what made their relationship toxic was Brandan and Mary both not trusting their partner. Mary didn&#39;t like Brandan looking at other women, and Bradan made Mary drop out of college. Brandan moved to the Philippines where they got married and soon became parents to a little girl.




Mary and Brandan&#39;s journey on 90 Day Fiancé came to an end amid rumors of the couple&#39;s split after one too many Instagram fights. Brandan posted a rare video with Mary and their daughter.


 

Mary played with the baby lying on their bed as Brandan joined them to film the video. Brandan and Mary&#39;s little one seemed truly happy to be with her parents. The couple did not caption the video, but their expressions did all the talking. Brandan also used the video to confirm there was nothing wrong between him and Mary in their relationship. 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 star Daniele Gates commented, &#34;I love this,&#34; while Holly Weeks called them her &#34;favorite couple.&#34;


 What To Know About Brandan &amp; Mary&#39;s Baby On 90 Day Fiancé 
          




A few fans in the comments section were curious about the baby. Mary became pregnant with Brandan&#39;s baby three months after she arrived in the Philippines. They claimed they were trying to have a baby. However, they weren&#39;t prepared to become parents. Both Brandan and Mary didn&#39;t have a stable source of income. Their immaturity was visible every time they appeared together onscreen. The pair got married a couple of months later and Mary was tired of asking Brandan for financial help as she made money by reselling cell phones. Brandan and Mary recently revealed they welcomed their daughter in August 2023.

Brandan and Mary have named their daughter Midnight. She was born via C-section. Mary and Brandan even mentioned her name during one of their Instagram Lives in October 2023. Mary, who wanted money to buy a new phone, was upset because Brandan had spent the money on a video game. As Brandan apologized to Mary later, he also said he would improve himself for Midnight and promised he would take care of their baby more. However, it wasn&#39;t the end of Brandan and Mary&#39;s clues that suggested a split. Mary posted several Instagram Stories saying both she and Brandan deserved better.




Mary shared Instagram Stories saying this was not the right plan for her and that God had something better in store for her. She didn&#39;t bother telling her fans what she was talking about, so the assumption was that it had something to do with Brandan. Mary shared photos from when she was in college, expressing regret because she dropped out so early. Still, Brandan&#39;s new video with the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star and their baby explains that Mary could have been faking her emotional outbursts online for clout. If not, Mary was truly unhappy in her marriage lately, but Brandan and Midnight were able to convince her to stay.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
