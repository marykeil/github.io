## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne&#39;s first meeting with Sophie Sierra&#39;s mom Claire in the U.S. is not going well. He already hates his future mom-in-law.




Rob Warne is not a big fan of Sophie Sierra’s mother Claire on 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Los Angeles resident Rob, 32, plans to get married to Sophie, 23, on the reality TV show. Rob and Sophie met on Instagram after she sent him a message when she saw his photo on a page about mixed-race men. She came to the U.S. to live with him on a K-1 visa, where Sophie expressed disappointment upon seeing Rob’s apartment, which didn’t have a bathroom in it. Sophie also caught Rob cheating on her online and briefly split before getting back together with him.




As per a preview clip of the next 90 Day Fiancé season 10 episode, shared by Access Hollywood, Sophie’s mom has now arrived in the U.S.


 

Rob and Sophie meet Claire, and Rob tells her that joking about knocking her mom to the floor was aggressive. Sophie tells Rob that her mom was just joking. “I’m not aggressive,” Claire insists, while Rob compares Sophie’s mom to his mom. “As if I’m going to be at your wedding and knock a woman to the floor,” Claire says to defend herself. Sophie insists that her mom is sarcastic and jokey in general. “You guys are taking me literal. I didn’t take you literal,” Rob adds.

 Sophie&#39;s Mom Doesn&#39;t Think Rob Has Sense Of Humor 
          

Claire tells him she thought “that was a lowkey dig.” Rob tells the cameras that this is an example of why he’s always “on the edge when Claire’s around.” He explains that they could be sitting and joking, and he says a joke back, “Now we want to take it personal, or make it negative.” Rob says that he feels like he’s always one word away from saying the wrong thing when he’s with Sophie and Claire. Meanwhile, Sophie’s mom lets Rob know that she feels like he wants to “say something” to her because of the way he sits and his body language.

Claire doesn’t want to be a mother-in-law that Rob hates. Rob claims he doesn’t hate her, and Sophie says he just doesn’t get her. Sophie thinks Rob doesn’t get British humor. “I don’t think he gets humor, full stop,” Claire corrects her. Claire then tells Rob that she’s going to come to his house to see it. Claire tells the producers that she’s “dreading seeing the house” because it’s “obviously not very good.” Claire suspects her daughter has been “wrapped up in the whole fantasy” because Rob is a good-looking guy, but “there’s only so long you can stare at a beautiful painting before you get bored.”




Sophie is very close to her mom. She’s her friend and close confidant. Claire is aware of Rob’s house being a mess and not having a built-in bathroom. Claire doesn’t want her daughter to be getting married to a man who’s not financially secure and without ambition. Rumors suggest Sophie and Rob have split after 90 Day Fiancé season 10. However, they might have gotten married in the finale.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
