## Literature Review
A Grey&#39;s Anatomy cast member who was previously part of a divisive major couple reveals their imminent return on the upcoming season 20.




Grey&#39;s Anatomy star Alex Landi is returning to the show in the upcoming season 20. Landi played Dr. Nico Kim on the long-running medical drama, a character who was in a divisive relationship with his Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital co-worker Dr. Levi Schmitt (Jake Borelli), a coupling which was given the portmanteau &#34;Schmico.&#34; The star appeared on 43 episodes of the show between seasons 15 and 18, eventually making his exit in season 18, episode 18, &#34;Stronger Than Hate,&#34; meaning his character hasn&#39;t been seen since May 2022.




On his official Instagram account, Landi shared an image teasing his imminent return in Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 20. Check it out below:


 

Landi&#39;s image shows the actor in his trailer dressed in scrubs. The simple caption reads &#34;SEASON 20&#34; and tags the official Grey&#39;s account, but at the time of writing it is unclear for how many episodes he will be returning.

This news about Dr. Kim&#39;s return was not revealed in the previously released Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 20 trailer. However, it may have been overshadowed by the impending return of the show&#39;s former lead Ellen Pompeo as Meredith Grey. Nevertheless, Nico&#39;s relationship with Levi was a pivotal period in that character&#39;s overall arc.




Schmitt, who is now Chief Resident, is one of the longer-running main characters on the current cast of the show, as he has appeared in a total of 116 episodes since his initial recurring appearance in season 14. As such, his love life may now be given more of a central focus, especially considering the explosive way that he and Dr. Kim broke up in season 18. Their relationship strife was exacerbated by the death of a patient, and their subsequent discord led to Nico leaving the hospital to take a job with the Seattle Mariners.

                  Why Dr. Schmitt Was Destined To Be Chief Resident On Greyâ€™s Anatomy   Schmitt became the Chief Resident in Grey&#39;s Anatomy Season 19, but there were clues throughout his time on the show that he would get this role.    

Because of the dramatic upheaval his breakup caused, it&#39;s unlikely that Nico&#39;s return will go unnoticed by Schmitt, however long said return turns out to last. It remains to be seen if Levi and Nico will actually get back together on Grey&#39;s Anatomy. However, Nico&#39;s appearance will almost certainly throw a wrench in Schmitt&#39;s ongoing storyline, even if he only comes back for a single episode.






Grey&#39;s Anatomy season 2 premieres on ABC on March 14.
