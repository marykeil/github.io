# Vanderpump Rules What We Know About Ariana &amp; Katie s Sandwich Shop


## SUMMARY 



  Ariana and Katie&#39;s sandwich shop will be named Something About Her, a name that received positive feedback from movie producer Randall Emmett.   Randall Emmett initially invested $150,000 in the sandwich shop, but Ariana and Katie are now seeking new investors after his breakup with Lala Kent.   The sandwich shop will be located in the Valley near Sherman Oaks and will focus on providing an Instagram-able experience rather than a traditional deli setting.

## Literature Review
Vanderpump Rules&#39; Ariana Madix and Katie Maloney were planning on opening a sandwich shop, but it hasn&#39;t come to fruition yet.




Vanderpump Rules stars Ariana Madix and Katie Maloney were planning on opening a sandwich shop, but it&#39;s unclear when this will happen. The series has launched numerous businesses as the two stars add their name to that list. Though Ariana and Katie will appear in the Vanderpump Rules season 11 cast, their personal problems are likely to usurp their business ventures, especially considering the fallout of Ariana&#39;s relationship with Tom.




During an episode of Vanderpump Rules, Katie offered her expertise to her husband, Tom Schwartz, and said she would like to help in his new restaurant deal with Tom Sandoval. Sadly, the bar proved too much for the couple to work together on, and Katie assumed her dreams of running a small sandwich shop were done forever. While the new eatery has yet to open, there are a few details that we have been able to scrounge up, which will leave any Bravo fan&#39;s mouth watering in anticipation.


 What Is The Name Of Ariana &amp; Katie&#39;s Sandwich Shop? 
          

The naming of Ariana and Katie&#39;s sandwich shop was vitally important. Both Toms got extreme backlash for the name of their bar, Schwart, as it was dubbed uninspiring. Ariana and Katie knew their shop&#39;s name had to be excellent. The ladies came up with Something About Her. While Lisa Vanderpump claimed she wasn&#39;t a fan, Randall Emmett was sold on the idea. The movie producer even agreed to invest in the business, with Ariana tweeting, &#34;Tacky sandwich puns are not our vibe.&#34;






 Ariana And Katie Are Seeking Investors 
          

Vanderpump Rules confirmed that both Toms would be steering clear of their partners&#39; venture, which is likely a positive outcome considering the deterioration of Ariana and Tom&#39;s marriage. Randall decided to invest $150,000 into the sandwich shop, but after his breakup with Lala Kent, the ladies are looking for new investors. The shop&#39;s location will be in the Valley near Sherman Oaks since the concept is more needed. The decor will be extremely Instagram-able, as both Ariana and Katie want their shop to be more of an experience rather than a deli.

Something About Her will join the likes of TomTom, SUR, and PUMP as an established place to visit when looking for the best Vanderpump Rules tour. While no opening date is confirmed, Katie and Ariana are working with the best in business to help get their ideas up and running. Luckily, Vanderpump Rules season 11 is coming soon, hopefully including an update on the sandwich shop.
