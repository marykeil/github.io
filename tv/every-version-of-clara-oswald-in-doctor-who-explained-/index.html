<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>From her introduction of Oswin Oswald to the Zygon, Bonnie, Doctor Who fans have seen plenty of Clara Oswald&rsquo;s appear throughout the Time Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>After creating numerous copies (known as splinters) of herself upon jumping into the Doctor&rsquo;s time stream in &ldquo;The Impossible Girl&rdquo; arc, every version of Clara Oswald has now become important to Doctor Who canon. Played by Jenna Coleman, the writers of Doctor Who promoted her character as a &ldquo;mystery worth solving&rdquo; as they teased that she would have a bigger role to play than any of the other companions before her. It was certainly a statement that appealed to the fandom - especially after they revealed that the deaths of Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald were somehow tied to the third (and main) iteration, Clara Oswald.
While the writers did initially lead people to believe that these Claras were across the Doctor Who timeline, just born for the sole purpose of saving the Doctor (and that there would be no more Clara &lsquo;splinters&rsquo; on-screen after &ldquo;The Impossible Girl&rdquo; mystery was solved in season 7, episode 13 &ldquo;The Day Of The Doctor&rdquo;), Moffat soon revealed that he wasn&rsquo;t done with the character just yet. &ldquo;Clara&rsquo;s identities&rdquo; ended up playing an important role in seasons 8, 9, and 10, where it was used by the Doctor&rsquo;s enemies and other non-humans to show how their friendship could lead to some drastic consequences for all (including Time).</p>
<p>Doctor Who Season 14: Ncuti Gatwa&rsquo;s Doctor, New Cast &amp; Everything We Know
Doctor Who season 14 is arriving after the 60th anniversary special, and with it Ncuti Gatwa&rsquo;s new Doctor. Here&rsquo;s everything we know so far.</p>
<p>Clara Oswald Was The Original &ldquo;Impossible Girl,&rdquo; Who Stepped Into The Doctor&rsquo;s Timeline To Save Their Lives
Season 7 - Season 9</p>
<p>Clara Oswald was first introduced at the end of the iconic Doctor Who Christmas special, &ldquo;The Snowmen,&rdquo; after Moffat closed out season 7a with the reveal that there was a third &ldquo;Impossible Girl.&rdquo; However, she quickly became an important staple to the show in episode 13, &ldquo;The Name of the Doctor,&rdquo; when the viewers discovered she was the creator of &ldquo;Impossible Girl&rdquo; &lsquo;splinters.&rsquo; This was explained by Clara after she jumped into The Doctor&rsquo;s time stream, stating that because she was splintered across space and time (hence the name), multiple copies of herself were scattered across the entire Doctor Who timeline - all predestined to save every incarnation.
The concluding twist was well-executed as it added depth to Clara and The Doctor&rsquo;s relationship and changed the franchise&rsquo;s history as it showed Clara had been there from the beginning of the journey. Even when she was rescued from his timestream, &ldquo;2013 Clara&rdquo; continued to &lsquo;save&rsquo; the Time Lord in many ways. She convinced three versions of The Doctor to work together and stop Gallifrey from being destroyed in the Time War, which was a groundbreaking moment as it retconned the established canon. Unfortunately, her 39-episode run ended on a heartbreaking note as the real Clara Oswald died in season 9, episode 10, &ldquo;Face the Raven,&rdquo; saving Rigsy from the Quantum Shade.
The Twelfth Doctor later tried to bring Clara back to life in season 9, episode 13, &ldquo;Hell Bent,&rdquo; breaking the fundamental rules of time travel by extracting her from her timeline and running to the end of the universe to escape The Time Lords. They soon realized their partnership was too dangerous as they were putting their own needs ahead of the greater good, shockingly making them &lsquo;The Hybrid&rsquo; that Doctor Who viewers had been warned about. Given all the sacrifices Clara made, it was hugely disappointing that they had to let her death happen because she deserved to get her happy ending.</p>
<p>Oswin Oswald (aka Soufflé Girl) Was A Time Splinter Of Clara&rsquo;s Who Died Fighting The Daleks
Season 7</p>
<p>Marking Coleman&rsquo;s first on-screen appearance, the iconic Dalek episode &ldquo;Asylum of The Daleks (season 7, episode 1) introduced viewers to Oswin Oswald - a witty Junior Entertainment Manager of Starship Alaska. Drawing the Time Lord&rsquo;s attention after he discovered she had been fighting the &lsquo;pepperpots&rsquo; alone for a year, Oswin spent this episode protecting Amy, Rory, and the Doctor from behind closed doors. While Oswin&rsquo;s story initially ended on a tragic note as she died at the end during the destruction of the planet, it was later revealed that she was one of 2013 Clara&rsquo;s splinters, pre-destined to save the Time Lord (episode 13, &ldquo;Name of The Doctor&rdquo;).
Although not a lot of attention was paid to it at the time, Moffat did allude to Oswin&rsquo;s splinter identity through her final words, &ldquo;Run, you clever boy, and remember.&rdquo; This quote proved to be important down the line as it was the final words 2013 Clara said to The Eleventh Doctor on Trenzalore before she jumped into his time stream (wanting him to remember her sacrifices). However, since this episode happened before Amy and Rory&rsquo;s exit from Doctor Who, the inclusion here served to only generate intrigue since Moffat didn&rsquo;t indicate what The Doctor was meant to remember about her specifically.</p>
<p>Clara Oswin Oswald Was A Time Splinter Of Clara&rsquo;s Who Died Fighting The Great Intelligence
Season 7</p>
<p>Introduced in the season 7 Christmas episode, &ldquo;The Snowmen,&rdquo; viewers met the Victorian governess as she assisted the Eleventh Doctor in defeating the powerful villain, The Great Intelligence, who tried to take over London with their ice-like creatures. While she did save the Time Lord&rsquo;s life after the Great Intelligence tried to kill him, Clara Oswin did end up dying (like her predecessor) from the injuries she sustained after she fell from a cloud. Eventually, it was revealed by the real Clara Oswald in episode 13, &ldquo;The Name of the Doctor&rdquo; that she was another &lsquo;splinter.&rsquo;
Out of all the &lsquo;splinters,&rsquo; Clara Oswin&rsquo;s death was one of the saddest in Doctor Who since Moffat allowed the audience to connect with this version more. However, it turned out to be for the best since it developed the &ldquo;Impossible Girl&rdquo; mystery more. Although there were parallels between Oswin and Clara Oswin, it was their similar deaths that sparked the Eleventh Doctor to begin his investigation into her identities - coining the &ldquo;Impossible Girl&rdquo; term after realizing that it shouldn&rsquo;t have been possible for him to run into the same woman when she had died twice.</p>
<p>The TARDIS Interface Of Clara Hinted To Her Being A Temporal Anomaly
Season 7</p>
<p>The &ldquo;TARDIS Voice Interface of Clara&rdquo; appeared in season 7, episode 9, &ldquo;Hide&rdquo; after the machine insulted Prime Clara. While it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;splinter,&rdquo; it did end up being important as Moffat later revealed in an interview with Doctor Who Magazine (via Cult Box) that the TARDIS&rsquo; animosity towards Clara was because it foresaw them becoming &ldquo;The Hybrid.&rdquo; Looking in hindsight, there&rsquo;s only ever been one time when the TARDIS rejected a companion and that was Captain Jack Harkness after he became immortal, so the fact that a similar pattern was occurring hinted that Clara was a potential temporal anomaly.</p>
<p>The Time Zombie Version Of Clara Almost Became A Splinter
Season 7b</p>
<p>Time Zombie Clara was introduced in season 7, episode 10 &ldquo;Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS,&rdquo; coming from an alternative future timeline that showed that 2013 Clara had died after being exposed to The Eye Of Harmony (which was soon made non-existent by the end). Frightening and bloodthirsty, the Time Zombie version had a small impact on &ldquo;The Impossible Girl&rdquo; arc as it led to The Doctor confronting Clara over her echoes and influenced real Clara&rsquo;s decision to jump into The Doctor&rsquo;s timeline as she realized she also had a pre-destined mission (episode 14, &ldquo;The Name of The Doctor&rdquo;). This could have potentially become one of Doctor Who&rsquo;s best plot twist if Moffat hadn&rsquo;t prolonged the mystery.</p>
<p>Gallifreyan Clara Was A Time Splinter Who Helped The First Doctor Steal The TARDIS
Season 7b</p>
<p>First seen in episode 13 &ldquo;The Name of The Doctor,&rdquo; Gallifreyan Clara was a splinter who advised the Time Lord about which TARDIS he should steal. Since she had only a limited amount of time on the screen, however, there are no records of whether she died afterward (although there&rsquo;s a possibility she may have fallen when Gallifrey did). Still, even with her small cameos, Gallifreyan Clara proved herself to be a true Doctor Who companion, since her interference showed she is the reason why The Doctor goes on these thrilling adventures (particularly when she recognized the TARDIS&rsquo; faulty navigation system would allow him to escape Gallifrey undetected).</p>
<p>Hints To Another Clara Oswald Splinter In 1954
&ldquo;Summer Falls And Other Stories&rdquo; Book By Amy Pond</p>
<p>While the Summer Falls novel Clara and Artie Maitland discuss at the beginning of Doctor Who&rsquo;s less-than-memorable season 7 looked like an ordinary book, another Clara splinter is associated with it (episode 6, “The Bells of Saint John”). In the &ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; of the BBC Books version, &ldquo;Summer Falls and Other Stories:&rdquo; (2013) Amy writes to The Doctor about how a woman keeps following her in 1954, (which is heavily implied to be a splinter as she echoes the iconic Clara quote: “Run, you clever boy&hellip;”). Since this was one of 2013 Clara&rsquo;s favorite books and The Doctor read these notes, it seemed like Moffat was hinting the modern version was the one trying to track him.</p>
<p>Oswin &ldquo;Winnie&rdquo; Clarence Was A Time Splinter Found In 2048, Who Didn&rsquo;t Die After Meeting The Doctor
The Comics</p>
<p>While Jenna Coleman didn&rsquo;t get the chance to play Oswin &ldquo;Winnie&rdquo; Clarence on-screen, this Blood and Ice (2015) Clara splinter proved to be important as she was the first one to survive after making a sacrifice. Winnie prevented the Twelfth Doctor from regenerating too early when she appeared to die after pulling Dr. Audley into liquid ice. However, they later discovered that she was alive since she had injected herself with an antidote before. Given that the Doctor and Clara have had a lot of guilt for potentially causing endless amounts of pain with the cyclical &ldquo;Impossible Girl&rdquo; prophecy, the fact that some survived provided them with some much-needed closure.</p>
<p>Police Constable Oswald Was A Time Splinter Found In 1963, Who Filed A Missing Person&rsquo;s Report For Susan
&ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the Clara splinters haven&rsquo;t been shown on-screen since 2013 Clara revealed she was responsible for them all, the other Doctor Who prose writers have continued to make sure her legacy lives on through their stories. Found in The Doctor: His Lives and Times, near &ldquo;Susan&rsquo;s Diary,&rdquo; there is a missing person&rsquo;s police report from 1963 for Susan Foreman, which has been filed by a &ldquo;P.C. Oswald.&rdquo; Although nothing else is revealed about the life they led or whether they died, this detail serves to emphasize that Constable Oswald has dedicated herself to the cause and would also be another Clara who would sacrifice herself for The Doctor if it meant protecting them.</p>
<p>Saibra Was A Mutant Human Who Used Clara Oswald&rsquo;s Identity To Show Her Powers
Season 8</p>
<p>Saibra was not a &lsquo;splinter,&rsquo; but a mutant-human that could transform into any living being she touched. Appearing in season 8, episode 5, &ldquo;Time Heist,&rdquo; this one-time Doctor Who companion debut saw her, Clara and The Twelfth Doctor forced to participate in a bank heist. It was here she was seen to transform into the original &ldquo;Impossible Girl&rdquo; to display her powers. Since Saibra didn&rsquo;t appear again afterward this episode, this Clara version is a little bit forgettable. However, in terms of storytelling, she did prove to be important as her powers showed that there were potentially other non-humans out there who may also be able to replicate her identity.</p>
<p>Bonnie Was A Zygon Who Used Clara Oswald&rsquo;s Identity To Try And Kill The Twelfth Doctor
Season 9</p>
<p>Introduced in one of Clara and The Doctor&rsquo;s best episodes (episode 7 &ldquo;The Zygon Invasion&rdquo; / episode 8 &ldquo;The Zygon Inversion&rdquo;), Clara meets Bonnie - a bloodthirsty Zygon, who tried to kill The Doctor after she stole her identity. Although The Doctor stopped Bonnie at the end by creating a new truce between the Zygons and humanity, Bonnie played a part in &ldquo;The Impossible Girl&rdquo; arc since she showed that many of The Doctor&rsquo;s enemies had begun to notice the &lsquo;Claras&rsquo; presence and would use her if it meant they succeeded in their plans. The Doctor might see Clara as his greatest ally, but if he wasn&rsquo;t careful, she could become his downfall too.</p>
<p>The Testimony Avatars Used Clara&rsquo;s Identity To Bring The Twelfth Doctor Comfort Before His Regeneration
2017 Christmas Special</p>
<p>After leaving in 2015, Coleman returned two years later for the Christmas special &ldquo;Twice Upon a Time,&rdquo; where she played a Testimony avatar of Clara. While she only had a limited amount of screen time, the small cameo served as a heartfelt tribute to Clara and The Doctor&rsquo;s entire relationship as Testimony Clara made a subtle reference to the &ldquo;&hellip;remember me&rdquo; quote. It was quite emotional too, as it showed that, even though the two were no longer in each other&rsquo;s lives anymore, The Doctor carried her with them wherever they go - ensuring that her legacy lived on in Doctor Who (and providing her with a worthy send-off that she deserved).
Doctor Who   Summary:   As the last of the alien species known as the Time Lords, the Doctor travels through time and space in his TARDIS, a time machine thats bigger on the inside than the outside, seeking out adventures in the ancient past and unimagined future while also serving as the protector of Earth and mankind.
