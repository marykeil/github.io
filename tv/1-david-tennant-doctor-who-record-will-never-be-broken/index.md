## Literature Review
The concept of regeneration in Doctor Who hasn&#39;t exactly had an iron-clad canon, but David Tennant has one series record that will never be bested.




While there have been over a dozen actors to take on the title role in Doctor Who, it&#39;s David Tennant who has one distinctive series record that will never be broken. Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor is perhaps the most beloved of the new era of Doctor Who. While outwardly the sunniest and upbeat of the Doctors, that sunny disposition belied a dark, vengeful streak that earned him the nickname &#34;The Oncoming Storm,&#34; among others. As the most emotionally open and &#34;human&#34; of the Doctors, he endeared himself to a new and old generation of viewers.




So when it came time to bid the Tenth Doctor goodbye, it was a hard and violent regeneration from Tennant&#39;s Tenth Doctor into Matt Smith&#39;s Eleventh Doctor, not only for the Doctor himself but also for the audience. There are few long-time Doctor Who lovers who can hear the line &#34;I don&#39;t want to go,&#34; delivered so tearfully by Tennant, without feeling a bit of a gut punch. Though the Eleventh Doctor became beloved in his own right, for many, it just wasn&#39;t the same. When Tennant returned as the Tenth Doctor in the 50th-anniversary special, fans rejoiced, and again in the 60th-anniversary specials. But that&#39;s not the only time Tennant&#39;s doctor has taken a surprising form, and it sets him up for a Doctor Who record that will likely never be broken.

Why David Tennant Holds An Unbeatable Doctor Who Record 
       


Tennant will be the only Doctor who has appeared not once, not twice, but as three different regenerated versions.



Until now, the established canon of Doctor Who was that, while the Doctor could regenerate into anyone in the TARDIS, the same face and personality never happened twice after a full body and mind regeneration. With his return, however, David Tennant will be the only Doctor who has appeared not once, not twice, but as three different regenerated versions. Unlike his previous return in the 50th-anniversary special, where he still played the Tenth Doctor, his latest version is someone completely new. That means Tennant has played the Tenth Doctor, the Metacrisis Doctor, and now the Fourteenth Doctor.



Two of those are completely new regenerations from a previous Doctor. The other, the Metacrisis Doctor, was birthed out of strange circumstances. When Tennant&#39;s version of the Doctor was newly regenerated, his hand was severed during a sword fight with the Sycorax. At the time, it didn&#39;t seem to be an issue, as the new Doctor still had enough regeneration energy in his body to regrow the hand. Later, however, Donna Noble touched the container in which the energized hand resided, and her human DNA bonded with the hand, which still had its own remnants of regenerative energy. That energy and the fusion of DNA enabled the hand to grow a human-Time Lord hybrid of the Doctor, albeit with only one heart and without regenerative abilities.



Tennant&#39;s Doctor Who Has Two Other Doctor Who Regeneration Firsts 
          

Technically, if one wants to stretch the concept a bit, David Tennant has actually played five different beings wearing the same face in the show. Along with the previously mentioned version of the Doctor, he also once decided to shoot his regeneration energy into the spare hand mentioned above, enabling him to keep the same face and personality. It was less a full Doctor Who regeneration, and more of a speed bump, happening so fast that he regenerated back into the same exact version of himself that he had just been.




Another time, in the &#34;Human Nature&#34; and &#34;Family of Blood&#34; two-parter, the Doctor completely rewrote his DNA to become a normal human without memories of having been the Doctor. It was a different process than regeneration, but still impressive considering it required a complete DNA rewrite and memory wipe. But even counting just the aforementioned three fully regenerated versions of the Doctor sets a record.



 Tennant&#39;s Return Means Other Doctor Who Actors Can Come Back 
          

For the first time in Doctor Who history, a brand-new version of a Doctor regenerated with an old face they&#39;ve used before. Like before, it was also down to strange circumstances and unlikely to happen again, with Jodie Whittaker&#39;s Thirteenth Doctor splitting into to separate versions, both Tennant&#39;s Fourteenth Doctor and Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor. Still, it opens the canon up to the possibility of other previous Doctor actors returning. In reality, anything can happen to Doctor Who&#39;s canon depending on the showrunner. As was shown with the backlash to Chris Chibnall&#39;s Timeless Child retcon of the Time-Lord origins, that change to the canon has to be earned and not upend the integrity of the show.

It was certainly interesting to see how the Doctor Who 60th-anniversary specials explained Tennant&#39;s return. Technically, it doesn&#39;t break canon that Jodie Whittaker&#39;s Thirteenth Doctor regenerated with the Tenth Doctor&#39;s face (though splitting into two Doctors certainly does). It&#39;s been suggested previously in Doctor Who that the Doctor subconsciously chooses the faces of people he or she has seen before. It&#39;s also been suggested that the Doctor regenerates into whoever they need to be for the next era of their life. It&#39;s entirely possible that, at least for a brief period, the new version of the Doctor needs to bring back a bit of the Tenth Doctor&#39;s flair whenever the show needs him.
