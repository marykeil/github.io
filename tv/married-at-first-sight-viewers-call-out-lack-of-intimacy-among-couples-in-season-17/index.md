## Literature Review
Married at First Sight season 17 has been very rocky, and the three remaining couples have not engaged in much intimacy, and viewers are commenting.




Married at First Sight season 17 has been criticized for the lack of compatibility among the couples, and that includes the fact no one has gotten intimate yet despite being weeks into the experiment. This season started out with five couples hoping to find their forever partners. However, Michael was left at the altar by his runaway bride, and Lauren and Orion broke up upon returning from the honeymoon. Those exits left Emily and Brennan, Clare and Cameron, and Becca and Austin as the remaining couples. The panel of experts&#39; matching skills have come into question after they have obviously dropped the ball.




Attraction among the couples has been a big issue, and viewers on Reddit have harped on this point. Redditor Jay_jitsu101 started a thread addressing, &#34;Usually couples would have had sex by now. It would quite honestly not shock me if this entire season goes by and not a single couple consummates the wedding. Such terrible matchmaking….. again.&#34;


 

In the comments, someone in agreement added, &#34;Orion was all talk and no girth – that’s a 0. Clare is suffering from extreme ick factor – that’s a 0. The RunAway Bride – that’s a 0. Austin, is all smile and no action – that’s a 0.&#34; Another person noted, &#34;I think 0/5 consummations this season will be a world record!&#34;

 Do Any Of The Married At First Sight Season 17 Couples Have a Chance? 
         

Another Married at First Sight fan pointed out, &#34;Every season there is at least one couple that has actually been intimate but agreed not to disclose it not saying that’s the case this season, but who knows…&#34; That said, it&#39;s possible news of hidden intimacy could break at the Reunion or in update episodes. However, this group of couples that&#39;s left have bigger issues facing their marriages than intimacy.

In Married at First Sight seasons past, at least one, if not several, of the couples consummated their marriages. Doing so added another important layer to their marriage dynamic and brought them closer together in most instances. With Brennan not attracted to Emily, Clare not being ready or interested in intimacy with Cameron, and Austin wanting Becca to pump the brakes on her desire to have sex, the key sexual component to the marriages is missing. It&#39;s true that partners who aren&#39;t interested in sex with their significant other should not be forced into intimacy, but they also should be trying to work toward attraction.




So far, the emotional and compatibility dynamics have been at fault for causing most of the issues between the Married at First Sight season 17 couples. If each pair can work on their attraction to one another and get help from the experts, there is hope for some of the couples to be part of whole and healthy marriages. Clare and Cameron seem the most likely to part ways due to their fundamental differences, while Brennan and Emily seem the most committed to the process. Becca and Austin have chemistry but are on different pages about serious topics that could affect their attraction.



Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST.
