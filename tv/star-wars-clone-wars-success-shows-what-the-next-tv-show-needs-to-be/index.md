# Star Wars  Clone Wars Success Shows What The Next TV Show Needs To Be


## SUMMARY 



  The Clone Wars set the example for future Star Wars shows by crafting a unique and compelling story from an area of the timeline that was neglected by the movies, and the next show should do it again.   Animated shows like The Clone Wars have the advantage of telling the tale of an entire era, unlike live-action shows which are limited in scope.   An animated Star Wars show set in the Galactic Civil War would allow for a wide range of storytelling opportunities and the chance to update and perfect the original trilogy&#39;s visuals.

## Literature Review

Star Wars: The Clone Wars is the perfect example of the direction the next Star Wars TV show should go in and how the story should be told.




Star Wars: The Clone Wars told the story of the immense conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Confederacy of Independent Systems perfectly, and it demonstrated what the next Star Wars TV show should be. The Clone Wars followed a huge ensemble of characters, from Jedi to Sith and everything in between during the Clone Wars. From the Battle of Christophsis to the execution of Order 66, The Clone Wars crafted a unique and compelling story out of an area in the timeline that had been neglected by the Star Wars movies. It set an example that future Star Wars shows should follow.




The current era of live-action Star Wars is fantastic, and upcoming Disney&#43; Star Wars TV shows seem promising, but they also have their limitations. The realities of filming in live-action means that most of the new Star Wars shows are limited in the scope of the stories they can tell. Where a live-action show is only able to tell the story of a single character, animated shows like The Clone Wars can tell the tale of an entire sprawling era. The Clone Wars demonstrated that the next Disney&#43; Star Wars show can and should be told differently.

                  Clone Wars Timeline Explained: When Each Season Takes Place (Including The Bad Batch)   All seven non-chronological seasons of The Clone Wars take place within a three-year period, but where does one year end and the next begin?   


 Star Wars Told The Clone Wars&#39; Story Perfectly In Its Animated Series 
          




The Clone Wars was the blueprint for what an episodic story should be, as it told a wide range of stories connected by a common thread. The show used its format and time expertly, which gave new life to aspects of the prequel trilogy that were largely forgotten in the movies. Clones went from being an underdeveloped and anonymous army to a group of similar but entirely unique soldiers that became beloved by viewers. Order 66 transformed from a plot hole into a plan Palpatine masterfully crafted. The Clone Wars gave the prequel trilogy the time and space it needed to thrive.

One of the greatest strengths of The Clone Wars was its medium: animation. It allowed for incredible creative freedom and variety in its story arcs and action sequences. One episode could take place on a world that would be very difficult to depict well in live-action, such as the ocean world of Mon Cala, while the next could feature stunning acrobatics that would cost a fortune to create in CGI. Animation was the only way for a TV show to depict such a complex few years of the Star Wars timeline, and it was executed perfectly.






 Star Wars Can Do It Again For The Galactic Civil War 
          

Setting a new show in the time period of the Galactic Civil War would open up a wide range of opportunities and directions to take. Several years passed between the original trilogy&#39;s movies, yet what happened between them has only been explored in comics and books. There are more stories and characters worth depicting outside of Luke and Leia, and a show would give the story enough time to show them. The Galactic Civil War would be the perfect setting for the next Star Wars show, and animation would be the perfect medium.

Giving the Galactic Civil War the same animated treatment as The Clone Wars would allow the series to tell stories that were impossible to portray when the original trilogy was first created. George Lucas&#39; vision was far ahead of the technology of the time, as evidenced by all the desert planets and special editions of the original trilogy, and animation could finally perfect his plan for the era. Everything from the fight scenes to the special effects could be updated, bringing the original trilogy into the modern era of television.




The Galactic Civil War was a rich period of history in Star Wars, and it deserves to be explored more in a TV show. Expanding upon the space between the original trilogy&#39;s movies, and even the year between the Battle of Endor and the Battle of Jakku, would make an already great trilogy even better. Following in the steps of The Clone Wars would ensure a potential series&#39; success, as that show told the complicated story of the Clone Wars perfectly.
