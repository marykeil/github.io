## Literature Review
Richie sends a heartwarming message to Uncle Jimmy in the final moments of The Bear season 2 that reaffirms how Richie feels about him.




WARNING: The following contains SPOILERS for The Bear season 2.The chocolate banana in The Bear season 2 finale that Richie gives to Jimmy is a callback to an earlier episode in the season that fans might have missed. Jimmy, otherwise known as Cicero or &#34;Unc&#34; by the dysfunctional Berzatto family, is a wise yet no-nonsense influence over Carmen, Natalie, and even Richie who has struggled to earn Jimmy&#39;s trust during the first two seasons of The Bear. Jimmy always has good intentions at heart with the Berzatto&#39;s, but often represents the harsh realities they struggle to accept, making him both an enemy and a mentor.




Richie possesses the most flaws between him, Natalie, and Carmen, who are all receiving guidance or financial support from Jimmy. This has created a great deal of friction between Richie and Jimmy throughout The Bear since Richie wants Jimmy&#39;s help but doesn&#39;t have his respect. Jimmy is clearly a man of principle, which is how he became so profitable and sharp in his business practices. Although Jimmy has love in his heart for Richie and the entire Berzatto family tree, he can&#39;t look past Richie&#39;s failures to honestly believe and invest in him. However, with the simple gesture of the chocolate banana The Bear shows Richie is taking a big step in changing Jimmy&#39;s opinion.

 The Bear Season 2 Finale&#39;s Chocolate Banana Is A Callback To Uncle Jimmy&#39;s Childhood Memory 
The Memory Is Also Linked To A Moment Of Kindness From Jimmy
          

With the chocolate banana The Bear showed just how deep and complex a show it truly is. In The Bear season 2 finale, Richie sends Jimmy a fancy chocolate banana made especially for him at the grand opening of Carmen&#39;s new restaurant. The tearful moment is a subtle callback to The Bear season 2, episode 6 &#34;Fishes&#34; where Jimmy explains to Richie&#39;s former wife Tiff a childhood memory of his dad taking him to a chocolate banana stand.




In the flashback Christmas episode, Jimmy recalls the smell of the chocolate bananas out of thin air, which Tiff rationalizes as the holidays invoking Jimmy&#39;s nostalgia. Moments later in the same scene, Richie gets exposed for claiming that Jimmy offered him a job in front of Tiff. This was a lie made up by Richie to appear like he had earned the opportunity honestly from Jimmy, which he did not.

Jimmy could have made it known that Richie was a liar and embarrassed him in front of Tiff, which would have damaged their relationship further. However, Jimmy chose to keep the truth hidden to save Richie&#39;s face, a rare sign of good faith although Richie had forced Jimmy&#39;s hand.
