## Literature Review

90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda gives hints about her relationship status after her social media behavior prompted split rumors with Gino Palazzolo.




90 Day Fiancé star Jasmine Pineda hinted at whether she is single amid rumors of her split with Gino Palazzolo. Jasmine, 36, and Gino, 52, were introduced as a couple in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 5. Gino traveled to Panama City from Michigan to meet Jasmine in person and came back engaged. However, Jasmine and Gino went through their fair share of ups and downs in their three-year relationship before she moved to the U.S. on a K-1 visa to get married to Gino. Jasmine’s insecurities coupled with Gino’s secrecy created problems for the couple. In 2024, Jasmine has sparked breakup rumors with Gino.




A curious 90 Day Fiancé fan decided to ask Jasmine to address the split on her Instagram while the former teacher was conducting a Q&amp;A session.

          

The person asked Jasmine, “Are you single?” Jasmine decided not to reply to them directly. She wrote, “I can’t answer this but I’m a highly confident woman.” Jasmine wrote, “Whatever works, works.” However, Jasmine wrote that if nothing worked out for her with Gino, she has “tons of options.” Jasmine declared, “Cause I’m the prize Period.”

 Are Jasmine &amp; Gino Still Together In 2024? 
          

When someone asked Jasmine her “favorite kind of men,” she replied, “Those with tons of money and a generous heart and funny.” Jasmine said that she didn’t want a “50/50.” She said she never wanted to be with a man who was broke, cheap, and grumpy. One of the questions for Jasmine was, “How is life treating you?” Jasmine said she doesn’t take life “personal[ly]” because it is hard on everyone. “I came to this world to be happy, and I try to live life to the fullest no matter what,” she confessed. Jasmine’s replies may have further fueled the split rumors with Gino because she was so vague about things.


 




Jasmine has been in America for the last nine or so months, according to photos of her being spotted in public. She is still together with Gino in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. He even proposed to her all over again with a new diamond ring in the latest episode. Jasmine said yes and told Gino that she was trying to be a better person by getting rid of her insecurities and cold treatment of Gino’s family. However, none of Jasmine’s photos on her Instagram profile show her wearing the huge rock on her left hand’s ring finger.

Jasmine has no recent photos with Gino on her feed. While Gino does post photos of them together on his Instagram, Jasmine is showing no signs of still being together with the man she wanted to marry on 90 Day Fiancé. Still, Jasmine might be playing mind games with fans. She could still be with Gino but wants to hint at a split just to make fans curious about their 90 Day Fiancé season 10 storyline. She’s good at making sure she doesn’t post anything that might violate her contract or could be a spoiler about her future with Gino on the show.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
