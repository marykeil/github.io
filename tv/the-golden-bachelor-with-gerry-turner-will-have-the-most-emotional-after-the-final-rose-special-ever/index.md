## Literature Review
The Golden Bachelor star Gerry Turner has a huge decision to make during what could be the most difficult emotional finale in Bachelor Nation history.




The Golden Bachelor has an episode left for Gerry Turner to make his final decision, and the lead himself is promising that his After The Final Rose special will be one of the most emotional in franchise history. Gerry, who lost his beloved wife Toni Turner in 2017, has been lost in the years since tragedy struck. Gerry’s family pushed him to sign up for The Golden Bachelor to give himself a second chance at love, supporting him throughout his journey. As Gerry’s eliminated most of the women of The Golden Bachelor, he’s had a handle on his emotions but may find it tougher as tension runs high.




In an exclusive interview with US Weekly, The Golden Bachelor season 1 host Jesse Palmer believes “this will be the most emotional AFR that the franchise has ever seen, I really believe it.” Gerry&#39;s decision will be difficult after his emotional moments with both finalists Leslie Fhima and Theresa Nist in the most recent episode. In making his choice, Gerry leaned on Jesse as much as possible. Jesse explained, “that was about as intense, as real, and as raw as it gets...probably the most raw moment that... I’ve been a part of since hosting the franchise.”

 Gerry Turner’s Golden Bachelor Journey Explained 
          




Throughout Gerry’s journey, he’s been one of the most emotionally vulnerable Bachelor leads that Bachelor Nation has ever seen. Jesse explained that while Gerry’s heart is always in the right place, “he’s very present in those moments, and I think Gerry can be a little bit impulsive at times.” It wasn’t surprising that eliminating women from The Golden Bachelor was difficult for Gerry, who has been grateful and gracious about each woman he’s dated joining him on this emotional ride. Jesse explained, “I think navigating this part of the journey was something that I don’t think he or anybody can really prepare for.” 


 

Gerry shared the most exciting journey as The Golden Bachelor with Bachelor Nation, taking the viewers on a roller coaster of emotions from the first moment. While he’s been careful about giving his heart to the women of The Golden Bachelor, he’s also been open about wanting to find someone to spend the rest of his life with. The women of The Golden Bachelor have all been open to Gerry’s sense of adventure and understand that his family is a massive part of his life. In sharing themselves with Gerry, the women have forged bonds that they can hopefully carry through the rest of their lives, as well.




Though Gerry’s journey as The Golden Bachelor is coming to a close, he’s hoping to move into the next chapter of his life in a happy, blissful partnership. After an emotional season of narrowing down his pool of women to just one, Gerry has shown Bachelor Nation one of the most emotional, vulnerable, sweet journeys ever seen. While host Jesse shared that Gerry’s journey wasn’t easy, watching him come through the process of The Golden Bachelor has been cathartic for the entirety of Bachelor Nation.
