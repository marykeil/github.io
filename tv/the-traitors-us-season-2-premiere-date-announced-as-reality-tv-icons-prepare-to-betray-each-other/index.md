## Literature Review
The Traitors season 2 is less than a month away, as Peacock reveals the highly-anticipated premiere date along with a dramatic trailer.




Peacock has announced a premiere date for The Traitors season 2. The competition series made a huge splash in the reality TV world when Peacock debuted The Traitors back in January 2023. Hosted by actor Alan Cumming, The Traitors season 1 saw 10 reality stars and 10 regular people competing against each other to win $250,000. The twist for this show in particular is that a few of the players are chosen at the start of the competition to play the roles of traitors, who betray and attempt to outplay (&#34;murder&#34;) all the others. The Traitors season 1 finale ended on a thrilling note as Survivor legend Cirie Fields outsmarted the other finalists to take home the grand prize.




After a hugely successful inaugural installment, Peacock is gearing up for The Traitors season 2, which will premiere on January 12, 2024, with the first three episodes. A trailer has also been released, teasing all the drama, mystery, betrayal and &#34;murder&#34; that will take place in the Scottish Highlands.


 

Following the three-episode premiere, each subsequent episode will be released on Thursdays at 9 p.m. EST/6 p.m. PST. The Traitors season 2 cast was revealed back in September and includes stars from Survivor (Sandra Diaz-Twine and Parvati Shallow), Big Brother (Dan Gheesling and Janelle Pierzina), Love Island (Carsten &#34;Bergie&#34; Bergersen), Real Housewives (Tamra Judge and Phaedra Parks) and The Bachelor (Peter Weber), among others. While the debut season only had 10 reality stars, this time around, The Traitors season 2 will be filled with nothing but reality stars--21, to be exact.





 The Traitors Season 2 Teases New Bombshell Twists 
          

The Traitors season 2 trailer teases what fans can expect when the popular reality show returns in January. &#34;Alan&#39;s dropping another bombshell,&#34; one of the contestants says in a voiceover, indicating that the twists and turns will be ramped up even more this season. The tension will be palpable, as the reality stars attempt to prove themselves worthy of not being &#34;murdered.&#34; At one point, Phaedra lashes out at Peter by saying, &#34;This is not The Bachelor, and I don&#39;t have to kiss your a** for a rose.&#34;

Sandra is one of the most infamous Survivor players ever, having won the CBS reality show twice. Later on in the trailer, she says, &#34;The first signs of deception, I&#39;m going to take care of her once and for all.&#34; As she&#39;s saying this, Parvati, another icon from Survivor, is shown on the screen. While this could indicate Sandra is ready to pounce and take out her fellow Survivor player, that could obviously be a red herring. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if any contestants from the same show, whether they&#39;ve worked together in the past or not, end up forming alliances.

The contestants aren&#39;t the only ones to watch on The Traitors. Alan is the perfect choice to host this devious reality show, and he plays the part exceptionally well. Fortunately, he&#39;s returning for The Traitors season 2. If the just-released trailer is any indication, then fans can expect even more witty lines and exceptional fashion from the reality TV host and actor. January 12 is less than a month away, and the excitement will surely keep building in the coming weeks until The Traitors returns.




The Traitors season 2 premieres January 12, 2024, on Peacock.
