# Star Wars Has Made One Huge Mistake With Ahsoka - &amp; It s Too Late To Put It Right


## SUMMARY 



  The meeting between Ahsoka and Luke off-screen in The Book of Boba Fett was a missed opportunity for a significant and meaningful connection between two beloved characters.   Ahsoka&#39;s journey in Ahsoka and the events of The Book of Boba Fett have made it clear that she was not yet ready for a meeting with Luke, as she still had unresolved feelings about Anakin&#39;s fall to the dark side.   The storytelling mistake of not showing the meeting cannot be easily fixed, as it would not do justice to the complex relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin and the impact it had on both characters.

## Literature Review
Star Wars had one key Ahsoka Tano scene occur off-screen, which was a major mistake and missed an absolutely massive opportunity for the franchise.




The Star Wars Disney&#43; TV show, The Book of Boba Fett, contains a scene between Anakin Skywalker&#39;s former Padawan Ahsoka Tano and his son Luke Skywalker that signals the two met off-screen for the first time - which was a major mistake by the franchise. Both Ahsoka and Luke are beloved characters in the Star Wars universe, and both are imbued with even more emotional significance because they have substantial connections to Anakin Skywalker, a character who continues to have a deep impact on viewers. This connection between Ahsoka and Luke would have been particularly significant because it offered a type of reconciliation and further understanding of Anakin, which both characters needed.




Having this introduction occur off-screen was a huge missed opportunity, and, unfortunately, that decision cannot be walked back now. When Luke and Ahsoka met, Ahsoka had yet to process her feelings about Anakin becoming Darth Vader, her role in that fall, and what that turn to the dark side by her former master means for her. This took place in Ahsoka, when she spoke to Anakin in the World Between Worlds, which happens after the events of The Book of Boba Fett and The Mandalorian. Because of that, an attempt to now show the meeting of Ahsoka and Luke for the first time would not carry the same meaning.

                  Star Wars: New Republic Timeline Explained   The New Republic Era is a brief period of galactic history, but it&#39;s vitally important to Star Wars. Here are all the key galactic events!    


 The Book Of Boba Fett Wasted Ahsoka&#39;s First Meeting With Luke Skywalker 
          




The relationship between Ahsoka and Anakin throughout Star Wars: The Clone Wars was incredibly important. It fleshed out and deepened Anakin&#39;s character significantly because it added a vulnerability to him and another crack in his belief in the Jedi Order. The viewers&#39; responses to The Clone Wars, Rebels, and Ahsoka have demonstrated the impact this relationship has had on the franchise. This means the meeting between Anakin&#39;s son and Ahsoka, who, in a different version of the story, could have been like family, would have been profound. It also offered Luke a new connection to his father after his passing, and it&#39;s truly a shame the audience missed out on that.



The timeline of Luke&#39;s and Ahsoka&#39;s scene in The Book of Boba Fett also makes no sense after Ahsoka, as it adds a massive gap between Ahsoka&#39;s capture of Morgan Elsbeth and her interrogation.






 There&#39;s No Way To Fix This Storytelling Mistake 
          




Devastatingly, the events of Ahsoka mean this choice cannot effectively be undone. Although shows such as Tales of the Jedi season 2 or even the upcoming Mandalorian movie could work backwards and provide that on-screen introduction, the Ahsoka series made it clear that Ahsoka would not have been fully ready for that meeting in a way that would do her relationship with Anakin justice. Ahsoka still harbored significant guilt and confusion about Anakin&#39;s fall to Vader, and that surely would have clouded her first interaction with Luke. Star Wars is excellent at retcon, but the franchise would be hard-pressed to do this moment justice retroactively.
