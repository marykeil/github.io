## Literature Review
Married at First Sight was just the beginning for Mia Bally. There&#39;s plenty to learn about what the reality TV star has been up to since MAFS.





On Married at First Sight, Mia and her match Tristan got off to a promising start. As two entrepreneurial people of faith who were apparently attracted to one another, they seemed like a perfect pairing. Unfortunately, the couple quickly hit a bumpy road, as Mia was arrested for credit card fraud and stalking just before the reality TV couple set off on their honeymoon. Following her arrest, Mia and Tristan overcame a few fights that threatened their marriage, from disagreements about how to spend their money to accusations of attempted cheating. However, come Decision Day, Mia and Tristan made the surprising decision to see their marriage through. Unfortunately, their relationship was not as fulfilling as they had hoped it would be.

 Mia &amp; Tristan&#39;s MAFS Marriage Was Not Meant To Last 

 

The feud that broke out the next day between the reality stars was enough to prompt Mia Bally and Tristan Thompson to file for divorce. After their divorce, Mia believed that she was framed on the show. She claimed that her ex-boyfriend Jared Evans had been abusive before her appearance on MAFS, and attempted to sully her name with false allegations that led to her arrest on the reality series. Mia has continued to use her platform to speak out against her ex&#39;s alleged abuse, as well as her tainted public image. She has also been adjusting to real life since appearing on Married At First Sight.

Since 2020, Mia has maintained a low profile. Even though Mia has upwards of 48,000 followers on Instagram, the season 7 star of Married at First Sight star has kept her IG profile set to private. Additionally, Mia&#39;s Twitter has been inactive since her last post about her ex-boyfriend&#39;s abuse in May 2020. Along with Twitter, the last post on Mia&#39;s TikTok was June 2020. Surprisingly, MIa&#39;s Facebook page appears to have the most exciting piece of new info. On May 23, 2021, Mia shared a picture of herself with an engagement ring captioned, &#34;Happy girl.&#34; Unfortunately, no information about the proposal, wedding plans, or fiance is available.

Mia has overcome a wealth of controversy on and off reality television. From getting arrested on camera to fighting COVID-19, Mia has faced her fair share of obstacles. With her ex facing the repercussions of abuse, and hopes of a second marriage, Mia Bally&#39;s luck has hopefully turned around since her challenging Married At First Sight appearance.
