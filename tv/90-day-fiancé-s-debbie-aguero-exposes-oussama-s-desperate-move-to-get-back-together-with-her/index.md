## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Debbie Aguero divulges how Oussama Berber&#39;s still trying to reunite with her while she looks for new love on The Single Life.




90 Day: The Single Life star Debbie Aguero revealed the shocking way Oussama Berber is trying to reconcile with her. Debbie is a 67-year-old woman from Sugar Hill, Georgia, who first starred in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 4. Debbie was in a relationship with 24-year-old Oussama, who&#39;s from Morocco, and moved to his country to marry him. Oussama had reached out to Debbie to praise her art and poetry on social media three years before they began filming. Debbie, who had been single for over a decade, couldn’t resist Oussama’s charms and saw him as her next husband.




However, Debbie and Oussama split at the end of the season, and she’s now revealing that he is still interested in dating her (as shared by Access Hollywood).


 

During the interview, Debbie was asked if anyone had been sliding into her DMs or coming out of the woodwork to send her “crazy messages.” Debbie revealed that some fans were trying to set her up with their uncles or grandfathers, but the men were too shy to make the first move. “And then, lo and behold, Oussama showed up again,” said Debbie, as she revealed that Oussama sent her a “love song and quickly said, ‘Oh don’t pay attention to that!’”

 Debbie &amp; Oussama&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Debbie told Oussama they were “finished.” She’s now hoping to find the “right kind of guy” who wants to move forward, has goals similar to hers, and wants to help people so they can do “a good thing and be the light on the path.” Debbie and Oussama clashed when it came to deciding their future plans after she packed her belongings and relocated to Morocco. Oussama told Debbie she had to be willing to live with his parents on the farm for a while before moving out together. Debbie was against this since she’d have to follow the family rules, such as not drinking alcohol.

Oussama had also changed his mind about marrying Debbie. While she wanted to stay in an apartment in Rabat with him, he now wanted to save money. He wanted Debbie to go back to the U.S. after living with him for a month. As Debbie continued to spend more time with her partner, Oussama revealed his true intentions. Debbie reminded him that he’d told her he would love her and take care of her after she came to Morocco. Instead, Oussama asked Debbie if she was “crazy” before adding, “We’ll not do everything in one day. You are sick. You have, like, mental sickness or something.”




Debbie asked Oussama what came next for them as a couple. He told her he wanted to move to the U.S. and that he couldn’t continue dating her if he didn’t get a Green Card in the future. Debbie decided to break up with Oussama because of his “cruel remarks,” but that didn’t mean he stopped pursuing her. As Debbie has revealed, Oussama is still trying to get her to forgive him so his American dream can could come to fruition. Debbie, meanwhile, is clear about what she wants as she continues to look for her soulmate in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
