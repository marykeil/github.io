# The Mandalorian Movie Will Prove A Controversial Luke Skywalker Decision Was Right


## SUMMARY 



  Luke&#39;s controversial choice presented to Grogu in The Mandalorian led to the creation of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie.   Grogu&#39;s decision to rejoin Din as a Mandalorian locked him out of Jedi training but allowed for a new and exciting adventure.   While Grogu could still become a Jedi in the future, his focus on Mandalorian training proves he made the right choice.

## Literature Review
The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu movie has already confirmed that Grogu&#39;s decision to leave the Jedi and become a Mandalorian apprentice was correct.




The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu will be Star Wars&#39; next feature film, but the movie was only possible thanks to the most controversial choice Luke Skywalker presented to Grogu in the show. In The Mandalorian season 2 finale, Luke rescued the crew during their rescue mission on Moff Gideon&#39;s cruiser. However, he took Grogu from Din Djarin to train him as a Jedi. In The Book of Boba Fett, Luke offered Grogu a controversial choice: to stay and become a Jedi, or leave and rejoin Din as a Mandalorian. Grogu chose to return to his father figure, but his decision was controversial.




Grogu began with a mysterious backstory and identity in The Mandalorian, but quickly grew into a beloved character. He had an extremely deep connection with the Force that training as a Jedi would have enhanced even further. However, his decision to rejoin Din effectively locked him out of that training, as Luke insisted he needed to let go of his attachments to become a Jedi. Star Wars doubled down on Grogu becoming a Mandalorian apprentice with the upcoming movie&#39;s announcement, and it proves that Grogu made the right choice in Luke&#39;s ultimatum.



The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu does not have an official release date, but Lucasfilm has announced production will begin in 2024.

 The Mandalorian Movie Proves Grogu Was Right To Reject Luke &amp; The Jedi 
         

Luke gave Grogu an excruciating choice between living the life of a Jedi and rejoining his father figure. If Grogu had chosen to continue his Jedi training, his story with Din would have ended and The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu would never have happened, and viewers would have been denied an amazing movie. Grogu and Din, and fans alike, would have missed out on a new and exciting adventure that serves as the culmination of many Disney&#43; TV shows. Grogu made the right choice, because his story with Din is far from over, and he has a bright future ahead of him.



 What Does Grogu&#39;s Future With The Mandalorian Look Like? 
          




Grogu became a Mandalorian apprentice and Din&#39;s adoptive son at the end of The Mandalorian season 3. Because of this, his future will likely include everything a young foundling experiences as they begin to follow the Way of the Mandalore. Grogu already started using IG-12&#39;s chassis as armor, and thus he will likely get his own Mandalorian armor and helmet. As weapons are part of the Children of the Watch&#39;s religion, they will likely play a heavy role in Grogu&#39;s development as well. The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu could see Grogu start his journey to becoming one of the fiercest bounty hunters the galaxy has ever seen.

                  Everything We Know About The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu Movie   The Mandalorian&#39;s story will continue with a Star Wars movie. Here&#39;s everything we know about the project, including cast, release, and timeline.    



 Could Grogu Still Become A Jedi In Star Wars&#39; Future? 
          




While it is clear that Grogu&#39;s time in the near future will be dedicated to his training as a Mandalorian apprentice, there is always a possibility that he could return to the Jedi Order in the future. It is unlikely that he would train with Luke at the temple on Ossus, given Luke&#39;s stance on attachments and the fact that the temple was destroyed by Ben Solo in 28 ABY, just 17 years after The Mandalorian season 3. However, Rey&#39;s New Jedi Order could still give Grogu a path to becoming a Jedi. Rey&#39;s Order could be radically different to the Jedi Order of the prequels and the one Luke attempted to rebuild.

If Rey&#39;s new Order returns to the roots of the Jedi Order, there could be less of an emphasis on avoiding attachment. This would allow Grogu to train as a Jedi without abandoning Din. Additionally, since Grogu&#39;s species ages more slowly than humans, Grogu would still be young enough to learn a significant amount from Rey. He could combine his Mandalorian training under Din with his Jedi training under Rey to cement his spot as one of the best characters in all Star Wars.




The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu&#39;s announcement confirmed that Grogu will be focusing solely on his training as a Mandalorian apprentice. This proved that his decision to reject Luke&#39;s invitation to train as a Jedi was right, as it created the opportunity for an awesome movie to be made. While Grogu could still become a Jedi in the future, he can rest easy knowing that he is on the right path as long as he is following Din. The father-son pair of The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu should be one of the best relationships in the galaxy, and one of the most fearsome duo of warriors Star Wars has ever seen.
