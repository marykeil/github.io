## Literature Review
Stranger Things showrunner Ross Duffer kicks off season 5 filming with new photos teasing character reunions, locations, and a potential time skip.




As filming for Stranger Things season 5 kicks off, co-creator Ross Duffer has shared several photos from the set, including new settings and a reunion between Joe Keery and Maya Hawke. Netflix&#39;s hit sci-fi series began in 2016 and aired a two-volume season 4 in 2022. Season 5 will conclude the story following the events of a cataclysm that shook Hawkins in season 4.




After releasing a Stranger Things season 5 core cast photo to signify the final season&#39;s filming had begun, Duffer has shared a series of photos from production through his personal Instagram. Check them out below:


 

Alongside a photo of Keery and Hawke reuniting to reprise their roles of Steve Harrington and Robin Buckley and the on-set chairs for Natalie Dyer and Charlie Heaton ahead of their returns as Nancy Wheeler and Jonathan Byers, the showrunner also shared several images from one of the show&#39;s set. Alongside various junk food containers, personal notes, and seemingly an improvised chicken doorbell to a control room, various items may also confirm a previously discussed plot point. Beneath the poster for Pink Floyd&#39;s The Wall, a copy of Planing, Shaping, and Slotting can be seen that resembles a 1988 edition, seemingly confirming a two-year time skip at minimum.





 What Could A Two-Year Time-Skip Mean For Stranger Things Season 5? 
          

While most of Hawkin&#39;s heroes survived and reunited in Stranger Things season 4&#39;s cataclysmic ending, many have been left wondering just how the world would be shaped by the Upside Down and Earth almost merging. The season finale showed Hawkins in a state of crisis, with impromptu crisis centers being established in schools as the authorities tried to establish order. With two years at minimum potentially passing, the show may return to a town that has managed to rebuild or account for the effects of the Upside Down after the gates hastily opened. However, Hawkins civilians are likely still on edge and in mourning over a terrible period of the town&#39;s history.

                  Stranger Things Season 5 Tease Makes 1 Massive Max &amp; Vecna Theory More Likely (&amp; Sets Up Hawkins&#39; Next Big Mission)   One Stranger Things executive producer might have confirmed a popular theory about Max and Vecna (and, consequentially, the season 5 mission).    




With a potential two years between the events of Stranger Things season 4 and Stranger Things season 5, there are questions about whether more Upside Down incursions happen off-screen between seasons. Although Vecna (Jame Campbell Bower) was wounded in season 4&#39;s ending, he could have slowly sent more Demogorgons and other creatures into the world to cause havoc as he recovered. As such, the potential control room behind the chicken doorbell could hint that someone, potentially the core cast, may have taken matters into their own hands to maintain an organized front against what could seep in from the Upside Down.

It has already been confirmed that Stranger Things season 5 will bring the Hawkins party&#39;s saga to a close. As such, while the photo of Keery and Hawke reuniting as Steve and Robin one last time, many viewers may be fixated on finding further clues as to what the season holds in Duffers&#39; post.



Stranger Things seasons 1 to 4 are currently available on Netflix.
