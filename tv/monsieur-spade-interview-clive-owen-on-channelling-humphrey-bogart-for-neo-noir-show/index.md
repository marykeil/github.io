 Clive Owen Talks Monsieur Spade 
          




Screen Rant: I&#39;m very excited to get to chat with you for Monsieur Spade. From what I&#39;ve seen so far, it is fantastic. What about the project initially sparked your interest?


Clive Owen: Well, I&#39;m a huge Bogart fan, I&#39;ve got a Maltese Falcon poster on my wall. I&#39;m a big fan of Scott Frank, both of his directing and his writing. I&#39;ve known his writing for years, certain scripts have come my way, and I&#39;ve always gone, &#34;Oh, my God, this writer is one of the best out there.&#34; So, to get a call from him and Tom and say, &#34;We want to have a look at Spade and reinvent him,&#34; and pitched me the idea of it, I was like, &#34;You&#39;ve come to the right guy.&#34; Knowing what a top writer he is, I couldn&#39;t have been more excited. It was a very, very quick commit.


Sam Spade is such an iconic character, and you mentioned his reinvention. Did you look back to some of the other adaptations to prep for this, or did you try to stick to Scott and Tom&#39;s writing and your own vision?





Clive Owen: No, I have to be honest, I kind of drowned in Bogart, just because I&#39;m such a fan of it. So, it was a great excuse to go back and just go, &#34;Right, I&#39;m gonna just drown in Bogart&#39;s world.&#34; And Scott refers back to and uses The Maltese Falcon as our sort of starting point, really. It&#39;s talked about as things that have happened in the past, and he&#39;s referring to some of the things that happened in The Maltese Falcon. I feel that Sam Spade and Bogart, they&#39;re kind of iconic. I didn&#39;t want to drift too far from that, so I really drowned in Bogart, and listened to him, and watched him. That was my hook to get into it already.


What did you feel was one of the biggest keys, either from Bogart or from the original character, to bringing Sam authentically to life?


Clive Owen: Well, interestingly, it is the fact that it&#39;s very easy to think that Bogart is iconic, and on the backfoot, and very kinda cool. In actual fact, he is really fast with his dialogue. He never milks anything, and he can rattle through dialogue at such a lick, but make it feel very, very easy. So, you never feel him working or chewing a lot of dialogue. And interestingly, Scott had written a lot of long dialogue things, and I realized that a key was going to be that you need to be speedy with it. You cannot slow it, milk it, it needs to be done at a lick for it to feel like that kind of &#39;40s vibe.
People talk fast, but you don&#39;t want to feel like, &#34;Oh, my God, that actor is really chewing a lot of dialogue there.&#34; It&#39;s got to be done, really, with a light touch, and that was something that I talked to Scott about, and he totally agreed. And the one thing that, you know, I adore Bogart, and the one thing that I adore about him is he doesn&#39;t milk anything. He&#39;s super on top of what he&#39;s doing, but even on the emotional stuff, there&#39;s a speed and a restraint about what he does that I just love. I love that kind of acting, so that was one thing that I learned going in.





          

Something that caught me by surprise was that, after the time jump, Sam became fluent in French. Were you already fluent in the language, or did you have to do a lot of preparation for that?


Clive Owen: No, that was a lot of prep. The whole sort of concentrating on the accent and the &#39;40s thing was a lot of work, and the French was, too. I was lucky in that there isn&#39;t that much, and anybody who could, and possibly would, speak English, I&#39;d do an American [accent], and there is just this splattering of French. But, I didn&#39;t speak it, I went to try and learn to speak it, and then realized I really didn&#39;t have the time, and that if you go and sort of classically tried to learn French, it&#39;s all about getting ready for exams, which isn&#39;t what I was doing. So, I quickly switched tack, and learned a lot of it phonetically, which is quite hard when you don&#39;t have a grip on a language. I was just treating it like an accent, and using the sounds, but yeah, even the small bit of French speaking took a lot of work.





Another thing I love is your unique dynamic with Patrice, Denis&#39; character. You guys have such a fun rapport with one another. What was it like developing that with him for the show?


Clive Owen: It was great, when you work with really top actors, there is a kind of ease about it, and you&#39;ve got great writing, the rhythms are there. Very often, I think, Scott encouraged speed, really, and you go back and look at those &#39;40s films, and that&#39;s when they do crackle, is when the dialogue is fast, and the rhythms are good. So, very often, we would work our way into a scene, and Scott would say, &#34;Right, now, let&#39;s really lick through it.&#34; And the thing just sort of comes to life when you&#39;ve got really great dialogue to play with, that you trust it and just let it sing, really.


          




The end of episode 1 is shocking, to say the least. What was it like for you on that day, having to make this horrific discovery?


Clive Owen: It was very Sam Spade, in a way, because the thing about Spade is that there is so much restraint. He really is so sort of stoic that you don&#39;t demonstrate anything, so you needed Scott and a good director to capture it well, but it was about feeling the impact of it, but without demonstrating that, without doing too much acting, really.
Because, yeah, Spade is not demonstrative in that way, so it was a very classic Spade moment to come across that. But it&#39;s also the moment where you go, &#34;Here he is, trying to live a different life in the south of France, trying to live a quieter life, and at this point, he&#39;s gonna get pulled back in.&#34; He&#39;s always ready, because this is what he&#39;s confronted with, so it&#39;s a kind of moment where you go, &#34;Sam Spade&#39;s got to come back.&#34;


He brings with him such a stoic bravado, but at the same time, he&#39;s not overly demonstrative. What was it like finding the right balance for you?





Clive Owen: Well, again, it&#39;s like you go back and look at Bogart, and look at those actors in that period, and that was the style of acting at that time. The amazing thing about Bogart is he stands up today, he acted in a very different time where the sensibilities of acting were very different, but he is still totally believable today. You go back and look at The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca, and he stands up.
You look at some other actors, and they feel very much of their time, and it&#39;s a style of acting, but with Bogart, there was something very truthful about it. But also, he was really kind of masterful, he was nimble through his dialogue. He was very restrained, never overindulge things, and, yeah, luckily, Scott was such a fan of the source material, the Dashiell Hammett stuff and the original movie, that he was trying to capture that world, and that helped me, too.


          




That&#39;s great that you had such a great collaborative process with him. Before I let you go, one of my favorite movies of yours to date is still Shoot &#39;Em Up. I know Michael has occasionally thrown out his thoughts on a possible sequel, and if he ever approached you to reprise Smith, do you think you would be down for it?


Clive Owen: I was always very fond of Michael&#39;s, I think he&#39;s a really, really big talent. I didn&#39;t understand why that film didn&#39;t do better, because it&#39;s got a very original take, and he&#39;s super imaginative and very bright. I&#39;ve got very fond memories of working with him.
