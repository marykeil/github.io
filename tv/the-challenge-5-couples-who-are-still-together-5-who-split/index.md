## Literature Review

The extended cast of The Challenge has seen many dramatic and romantic moments. Discover which couples are still together and who broke up. 




MTV’s long-running reality competition series The Challenge has been running for years, so it&#39;s no surprise that many contestants became couples after their time on one of the best reality TV shows. The competition show, which originally saw cast members from The Real World and Roads Rules competing for fast cash and prizes, has gone on to become an iconic international battle for glory, fame, and life-changing money. Though the show has transformed from far more casual competing to something reality stars seriously train for, the romantic undertones of the beloved show have remained consistent, even as fans enjoy The Challenge season 39.




Although The Challenge originally saw MTV personalities partaking in competitions, it has expanded in the past few years. Additionally, The Challenge has also branched out to include a wide variety of shows, with its viewers expanding. It might be a competition series, but The Challenge has always been filled with romantic drama. From hookups to breakups and betrayals, there has been non-stop drama. Since many cast members come back for additional seasons, they have the opportunity to rekindle romances, continue dating, or awkwardly bump into their exes. Relationships have also imploded when one-half of a couple is in the house alone. Many couples called it quits in the real world, and others managed to keep their romance intact.
