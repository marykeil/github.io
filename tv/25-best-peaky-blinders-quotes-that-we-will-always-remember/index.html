<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Peaky Blinders is a gritty crime series of gangsters fighting for supremacy. The BBC series has given many memorable quotes, but here are the best.</p>
<p>While the popular crime series may be over, there are a number of memorable Peaky Blinders quotes that will stay with fans forever. For six seasons, Peaky Blinders offered a gritty and thrilling period saga looking at the Shelby crime family and its infamous gang. While the show was filled with violence and brutality, it was often the dialogue that stole the show. Steven Knight&rsquo;s scripts never shy away from quick, sassy banter and cinematic lines among its characters, whether it be Thomas Shelby&rsquo;s brooding musings, Alfie&rsquo;s wild outbursts, or Aunt Polly&rsquo;s fiery comebacks.
Peaky Blinders came to an end in 2022, and while there is some hope for the story&rsquo;s continuation, the show left plenty of great moments that the fans can look back on, including the endless lines that remain quotable years later. From the epic monologues to the thoughtful observations to the rare moments of humor, these memorable quotes highlight why Peaky Blinders will be so missed by fans.</p>
<p>The 50 Best TV Shows Of All Time, Ranked
The best TV shows of all time will be debated forever, but there are clear contenders. These are the very best TV shows of all time, ranked.</p>
<p>25  &ldquo;I Will Wear High Heels So That You Will Hear My Approach On The Cobblestones, And You Will Have Time To Repent. &quot;
Polly Shelby - Season 5, Episode 3: &ldquo;Strategy&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the characters in Peaky Blinders often prove themselves to be flawed and even evil people at times, they always seem to find enemies that are worse than them. It can be so satisfying seeing them put these people in their place and Aunt Polly is one of the best characters to fulfill this job. While Polly usually stays out of the nastier aspects of the group, she is keen to teach an abusive nun a lesson. Warning the corrupted woman to change her ways, Polly ends with this chilling threat about what will happen if she needs to visit the nun again.</p>
<p>24  &ldquo;This Whole Bloody Enterprise Was Women&rsquo;s Business While You Boys Were Away At War.&rdquo;
Polly Shelby - Season 1, Episode 1</p>
<p>One of the biggest elements missing from the final season of Peaky Blinders was the absence of Polly following the death of Helen McCrory. She was certainly one of the standout characters on the show and delivered some of the best lines. Part of what makes Polly so endearing is how she refuses to buckle to anyone, including Tommy. When he suggests that there is some business the Shelby women should not be involved in, Polly is not at all afraid to remind Tommy how there would be no business without the women.</p>
<p>23  &ldquo;I Heard You Dress Well Mr. Shelby. But Now I See, Not So Well As Me.&rdquo;
Luca Changretta - Season 4, Episode 2: &ldquo;Heathens&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the best villains of Peaky Blinders is Luca Changretta. The mafia man comes over from America to exact revenge on Tommy Shelby for the murder of his father. Luca quickly establishes himself as an intimidating threat, partially due to his confidence that he will be able to wipe out the entire Shelby family despite their untouchable reputation. Working his way into Tommy&rsquo;s office, Luca seems to relish putting his enemy on edge. He sizes him up and delivers this oddly threatening line that suggests the myth of Tommy Shelby is overstated and establishes him as someone who might actually take Tommy down.</p>
<p>22  &ldquo;And If We Lift Our Heel Off Their Necks Now, They&rsquo;ll Just Come At Us.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 3, Episode 2</p>
<p>Tommy is a fascinating protagonist in the series, often challenging the audience&rsquo;s willingness to support him. He can be a brutal, heartless, and ruthless leader who goes to extremes to maintain the power he has fought so hard for. Despite promises of an end to the war that has targeted them, Tommy makes plans to go after his enemies. He insists that this is a maneuver to protect the family, but it becomes clear Tommy is no longer the underdog but the one with the boot on people&rsquo;s necks.</p>
<p>21  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s No Rest For Me In This World. Perhaps In The Next.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 4, Episode 6: &ldquo;The Company&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even with his many victories, Tommy is a tortured man who seems to have no way out of the life he has built for himself. He acknowledges that all this fighting for power will not bring him any peace and that he&rsquo;ll have to wait for a new life in order to rest. Interestingly, the end of the series seems to offer this rest to Tommy, allowing him to choose between a life where he is thought to be dead or one where he goes back to his old ways to seek revenge. It&rsquo;s likely a question the Peaky Blinders movie will answer.</p>
<p>8 Biggest Questions The Peaky Blinders Movie Needs To Answer
Peaky Blinders ended with season 6, but the story will continue in a movie, which can answer all burning questions leftover from the finale.</p>
<p>20  &ldquo;My Suits Are On The House, Or The House Burns Down.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 1, Episode 3</p>
<p>Peaky Blinders quotes are sometimes nothing but memorable one-liners that showcase the intimidating nature of these characters as well as the influence and power held by Tommy Shelby and the rest of the Birmingham razor gang, as with this memorable line. When delivered by Cillian Murphy, the soft-spoken way Tommy offers this observation makes it seem all the more menacing. Tommy is aware his mere presence is a big enough threat that he can get anything he wants. They could pay for suits if they needed - they have the money - but they do not need to.</p>
<p>19  &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll Wake Up. Granted He Won&rsquo;t Have Any Teeth Left, But He&rsquo;ll Be A Wiser Man For It.&rdquo;
Alfie Solomons - Season 2, Episode 3</p>
<p>Alfie Solomons is one of the best characters on Peaky Blinders and is responsible for some of the best quotes throughout his time on the show, so often delivering the most laugh-out-loud moments of the series. This is one of his earliest yet most memorable moments of comedy and violence. After one of Tommy&rsquo;s workers makes a joke, Alfie knocks out another with his cane and drops this piece of wisdom on the worker who made a joke. Not only does this showcase that Alfie can be a bit unhinged, but it also shows the power he holds and even the intelligence he has.</p>
<p>18  &ldquo;They Killed Him. My Son. They Shot Him And They Put Him On A F****** Cross And He&rsquo;s F****** Dead.&rdquo;
Aberama Gold - Season 5, Episode 4: &ldquo;The Loop&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Peaky Blinders quotes are so often cool and threatening, there are many sad quotes throughout the show. One of the most harrowing is this from the usually collected Aberama Gold. After the Billy Boys brutally crucify and kill Aberama&rsquo;s son, Bonnie Gold, he kidnaps Johnny Dogs and takes him to Tommy&rsquo;s home, emotionally telling the Shelby patriarch what had happened to his son. Watching this scene unfold is chilling. Teared-up and fueled by heartbreak and anger, Aberama is both unhinged and unpredictable at this moment, adding a lot of tension and making this quote all the more memorable.</p>
<p>17  &ldquo;This Place Is Under New Management, By Order Of The Peaky Blinders.&rdquo;
Arthur Shelby - Season 2, Episode 4</p>
<p>When the Peaky Blinders decided they would branch out of Birmingham, it led them to London, right in the middle of the big-time action and in between various feuds such as that between Sabini and Solomons. Staking their claim, the Blinders take over a bar, and it is at this moment one of the show&rsquo;s most iconic lines is born as Arthur announces that the Peaky Blinders have not only arrived in London but are taking over. Arthur is always the most reckless of the gang, but his value is seen in moments like this as he is filled with fearless ambition.</p>
<p>16  &ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s A Wh*re, Grace. We Just Sell Different Parts Of Ourselves.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 1, Episode 3</p>
<p>In the early days, before Tommy and Grace fell in love, Tommy wanted to use Grace&rsquo;s charm and beauty to win over Billy Kimber. When Grace learned of Tommy&rsquo;s true intentions of inviting her along to a race, she accused him of prostituting her for his own gain. This witty Peaky Blinders quote was Tommy&rsquo;s response, and it&rsquo;s a great insight into his overall mindset. In Tommy&rsquo;s mind, everyone sells themselves to get what they want, just in different ways. It is a funny line given the context of their argument, but it is also a great example of the cynical way Tommy views the world.</p>
<p>10 Incredibly Heartbreaking Deaths In Peaky Blinders
A lot of characters die in Peaky Blinders, but there are 10 character deaths in the show that are more heartbreaking than the rest of them.</p>
<p>15  &ldquo;It Was F***** Biblical, Mate.&rdquo;
Alfie Solomons - Season 2, Episode 2</p>
<p>Even though Alfie Solomons is this compelling and wealthy criminal figure who is so wholly cruel and violent when he needs or wants to be, it is easy to be entertained by his dialogue, delivered wonderfully by Tom Hardy. What comes before this iconic quip is Alfie describing how he performed his &ldquo;own personal form of stigmata&rdquo; on an Italian man who got on his bad side. Alfie can be a funny character but the danger that lurks beneath that surface makes for an uneasy laugh. He seems to hide a bit of pride and glee as he recounts this gruesome act.</p>
<p>14  &ldquo;Whiskey&rsquo;s Good Proofing Water. Tells You Who&rsquo;s Real And Who Isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 1, Episode 3</p>
<p>Among his many vices, Tommy is known for his heavy drinking habits as well as his respect for the benefits of a good whiskey. This allows him to make such insightful observations as this. He uses this booze-induced trick to discover the truth behind other people&rsquo;s intentions &ndash; particularly his enemies. Alcohol - especially whiskey - tends to loosen the inhibitions and lips of those who you need to see for who they really are. No one knows that better than Tommy.</p>
<p>13  &ldquo;Men Like Us, Mr. Shelby, Will Always Be Alone. And What Love We Get, We Will Have To Pay For.&rdquo;
Chester Campbell - Season 1, Episode 6</p>
<p>Initially, Inspector Chester Campbell has a vendetta against Thomas just because he&rsquo;s on the other side of the law. However, he then falls in love with undercover police agent Grace who has feelings for Tommy. Campbell wages his own personal war after falling into this love triangle. In this quote, Campbell stresses that no matter what romantic dreams Thomas weaves, he is bound to lose Grace. After all, Thomas has chosen a dangerous life for himself, which makes it hard to have any real commitments. Campbell does turn out to be right a few seasons later with Grace&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>12  &ldquo;Good Taste Is For People Who Can&rsquo;t Afford Sapphires.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 3, Episode 1</p>
<p>By the beginning of the third season, Tommy Shelby and the Peaky Blinders as a whole are flush with cash. They don&rsquo;t have to want for anything, and Tommy makes sure his wife, Grace, has everything she deserves. That includes massive sapphires, a moment that proves how the two may be soulmates. When he receives them as payment from the Russians, he makes one into a gorgeous necklace for her to wear to their charity event. She remarks that it likely wouldn&rsquo;t be tasteful to wear to a charity event when he replies with this one-liner. Sadly, it marked the end of their happiness as Grace is killed off in Peaky Blinders&rsquo; third season.</p>
<p>11  &ldquo;Men And Their C**** Never Cease To Amaze Me.&rdquo;
Polly Shelby - Season 1, Episode 4</p>
<p>Polly, the brains behind most of the Shelby business and an aunt to the gangster brothers, delivers gems of sarcasm and savagery whenever she&rsquo;s on-screen. Aunt Polly says then when the youngest brother John Shelby announces that he wishes to marry a prostitute. She generalizes how men mostly think from their genitals rather than their minds. This quote also shows Polly&rsquo;s disdain towards men, as she lives in 20th-century England when working women are not looked at in a positive light. Yet, Polly perseveres in doing her own thing and remains one of the Peaky Blinders&rsquo; strongest members.</p>
<p>10  &ldquo;May You Be In Heaven A Full Half-Hour Before The Devil Knows You&rsquo;re Dead.&rdquo;
Grace Burgess - Season 1, Episode 4</p>
<p>Grace and Thomas&rsquo;s love story is almost Shakespearean. Initially, Grace poses as a barmaid, and Thomas finds solace in her company. A constant drinker, Thomas heads out to his pub in an empty hour and asks if Grace can raise a toast. She says that she&rsquo;s Irish, so she can make a million toasts. Grace knows that Thomas has committed enough sins to go to Hell, but she still looks at some of the niceness that he conceals. This is what drives her to the show&rsquo;s protagonist.</p>
<p>9  &ldquo;Intelligence Is A Very Valuable Thing, Innit, My Friend. And Usually, It Comes Far Too F****** Late.&rdquo;
Alfie Solomons - Season 2, Episode 2</p>
<p>Alfie Solomons is a character with many sides to his personality and is pretty complex. He can be cruel, vicious, powerful, eccentric, and hilarious, but he can also be wildly intelligent. He is undoubtedly one of the show&rsquo;s smartest characters. This quote is one of the more wise phrases uttered by Alfie. He is always ten steps ahead, and this proves why. Intelligence is something to be valued, and only the smart prevail in their world.</p>
<p>8  &ldquo;Who Wants To Be In Heaven When You Can Be Sending Men To F****** Hell?&rdquo;
Arthur Shelby - Season 3, Episode 6</p>
<p>Arthur has a different philosophy altogether regarding matters of heaven and Hell. Although Arthur faces PTSD and addiction issues, later on, he has mostly been a wild beast on the loose. That does lead to some of the most memorable Peaky Blinders quotes, though. This line only expands on his fits of bloodlust and rage. Like other hot-tempered gangsters like Tommy DeVito from Goodfellas or The Godfather&rsquo;s Sonny Corleone, Arthur is less concerned with keeping a low profile and is more interested in embracing his barbaric energy.</p>
<p>7  &ldquo;Already Broken.&rdquo;
Tommy Shelby - Season 1, Episode 2</p>
<p>The relationship between Tommy and Grace is central not only to Peaky Blinders as a whole but to Tommy&rsquo;s story and character development, even long after her death. This scene is perhaps their most iconic and is home to this exchange which is one of the earliest signs of vulnerability shown by Tommy. The line is simple, but it works wonderfully at this moment, and this quiet, intimate moment has some of the most memorable Peaky Blinders dialogue and helps define the character of Tommy Shelby. Even at the beginning of his climb to power, it seemed as if there was nothing that could bring Tommy peace.</p>
<p>10 Characters Based On Historical Figures In Peaky Blinders
Peaky Blinders follows the fictional Shelby family&rsquo;s criminal enterprises, but there are some characters who actually existed in real life.</p>
<p>6  &ldquo;Sergeant Thorne, Reporting For Duty, Sir.&rdquo;
Freddie Thorne - Season 1, Episode 6</p>
<p>Billy Kimber, one of the baddies of the first season of Peaky Blinders, arrives with his gang outnumbering Shelby and his men. Thomas calmly says that they should use proper guns if they&rsquo;re fighting with guns. It&rsquo;s then when Thomas&rsquo;s brother-in-law and fellow war veteran Freddie comes out with a stolen Chinese machine gun in hand. Kimber and his henchmen are stunned. Even though not much gunfire happens after this, Freddie&rsquo;s entry makes the scene cool enough.</p>
