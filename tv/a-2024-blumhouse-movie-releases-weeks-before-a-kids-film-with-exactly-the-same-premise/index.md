## Literature Review

2024&#39;s weirdest box office battle will be between a Blumhouse horror movie and John Krasinski&#39;s kids&#39; movie, as they have the same premise.




Among 2024’s confirmed theatrical releases are a new Blumhouse horror movie that shares the same premise as John Krasinski’s family-friendly IF, and will be released within just a couple of weeks between them. Blumhouse has become one of the top studios in the horror genre in recent years, and it will continue bringing a variety of horror stories in 2024, starting with Imaginary. Directed by Jeff Wadlow, Imaginary is a supernatural horror movie starring DeWanda Wise and Pyper Braun, and viewers won’t have to wait too long for it as it’s scheduled for a March 8, 2024, release.




After the success of the horror movies A Quiet Place and A Quiet Place Part II, John Krasinski is leaving scares and suspense aside and going back to comedy with his next film, though now with a family-friendly tone. Krasinski’s latest project is IF, a live-action/animated fantasy comedy film starring Ryan Reynolds and Cailey Fleming, along with a voice cast led by Steve Carell and Phoebe Waller-Bridge. IF has a release date of May 17, 2024, a couple of weeks after Blumhouse’s Imaginary, though these two will be the weirdest box office battle as they share the same premise, but with very different tones.


 Blumhouse&#39;s Imaginary Uses The Same Premise As 2024&#39;s IF 
          

Written by Jeff Wadlow, Greg Erb, and Jason Oremland, Imaginary follows Jessica (Wise), who returns to her childhood home with her family. There, she finds her old stuffed bear, Chauncey, her favorite toy when she was a kid. Jessica’s youngest stepdaughter, Alice (Brain), comes across Chauncey and quickly grows attached to it, but her behavior begins to worry Jessica when the games Alice and Chauncey play turn increasingly dangerous, to the point of putting Alice’s life at risk. Jessica soon realizes that Chauncey is more than just a toy, and her connection with it unleashed something sinister.




John Krasinski’s IF is the story of Bea (Fleming), a young girl who gains the ability to see people’s imaginary friends, referred to as “IFs”, and these have been abandoned by the kids they once accompanied and helped. To Bea’s surprise, her neighbor, The Man Upstairs (Reynolds), has the same ability, and together, they help the IFs that have been dumped. Now, in the trailer for Imaginary, it’s revealed that imaginary friends are “entities that tether to the young”, but when the connection is severed, the entity “becomes enraged”, which is what happened between Jessica and Chauncey.

While Imaginary explores a sinister side of the connection between children and imaginary friends, turning the latter into potential threats, IF has a much lighter, funnier, and family-friendly approach to this same topic. The IFs are harmless and are looking for new companions rather than attaching to a new kid and driving them to do horrible things to get revenge against their original owner.




     John Krasinski&#39;s New Comedy Is Oddly Similar To An Underrated Kids Show From 19 Years Ago   Although John Krasinski&#39;s upcoming comedy movie IF is an original story, it&#39;s already looking too similar to an underrated Cartoon Network show.   



 Imaginary Vs. IF Will Be 2024&#39;s Weirdest Box Office Battle 
          

Despite there being over two months between the release of Imaginary and that of IF, these two will be 2024’s weirdest box office battle. The similar premises but with different tones and conflicts will inevitably draw comparisons between Imaginary and IF, pitting them against each other at the box office. 2023 also saw a weird box office battle with the Barbenheimer phenomenon, only this time both competitors will have a lot in common yet big differences at the same time. Given their different target audiences, both Imaginary and IF have big chances of succeeding, but only one will rule the box office.
