While there&#39;s no confirmation yet, their story is so popular The Family Chantel could return for season 5 despite Pedro and Chantel&#39;s split.

Not only did Pedro and Chantel live in different homes, but Pedro officially filed for divorce. Though unlikely, there are still shimmers of hope for a reconciliation.
