# Why Jason Bourne TV Show Treadstone Season 2 Was Canceled


## SUMMARY 



  Treadstone season 2 was canceled due to low ratings and the network&#39;s shift towards different programming.   The show left unanswered questions and unresolved plotlines that would have been explored in Treadstone season 2.   The rise of streaming services and changes in cable television contributed to the cancellation, as USA Network had to prioritize reality TV and live programming over scripted shows like Treadstone.

## Literature Review

There&#39;ll be no Treadstone season 2, as USA&#39;s Jason Bourne spinoff series has been cancelled after just one season. Here are the reasons why.




Treadstone season 2 never happened, leaving the Jason Bourne television spinoff at just one season. There are a couple of main reasons why Treadstone season 2 was canceled, which chiefly stem from the show&#39;s ratings, and the channel&#39;s overall shift towards a different kind of programming. The show attempted to pour the international espionage-based thrills of the Bourne franchise into an episodic series. Despite a lacking the popularity of the movies, the Bourne TV show did gain a small but loyal following, and many are rightly wondering why Treadstone season 2 never happened.




Based on the Jason Bourne films (which in turn are based on the books by Robert Ludlum), Treadstone season 1 is set in two different time periods. A 1973 storyline follows John Randolph Bentley (Jeremy Irvine), a CIA Operative captured by the KGB and put through a brainwashing program, forcing him to carry out assassinations and other missions for the Soviets. In the present-day storyline, a group of operatives who were turned into sleeper agents by the CIA&#39;s own behavior modification program, Treadstone, begin to awaken. The show left plenty of open questions Treadstone season 2 never got to answer.

                  How To Watch The Jason Bourne Movies In Order (Chronologically &amp; By Release Date)   The Jason Bourne movie franchise consists of five feature films, and thankfully, the chronological order of them is pretty straightforward.

 Treadstone Season 2 Was Canceled As Part Of A Wider Network Shift 
The Show&#39;s Declining Viewership Was Another Factor
          




The Treadstone season 2 cancelation was reported alongside the USA Network&#39;s cancelation of the horror spinoff series The Purge. These announcements form part of a move away from scripted programming and towards live and unscripted programming, such as WWE Raw. Regarding scripted content, USA stated it will be focusing on event series rather than long-running shows in line with its viewership data.

Treadstone&#39;s premiere episode attracted 645,000 live viewers and had pulled in a total of 1.84 million through delayed viewing by the following week. However, ratings had declined to just 371,000 live viewers by the season finale, and Treadstone attracted mixed reviews, both of which were key factors in USA&#39;s decision to cancel Treadstone season 2.



 What Treadstone Season 2&#39;s Story Could Have Been 
Season 1&#39;s Ending Set Up Multiple Storylines That Never Happened
          




Treadstone season 1 ends by merging its two key storylines, as an older Bentley is confronted by his former captor and lover, Petra Andropov (Gabrielle Scharnitzky) who wants his help to bring down Treadstone. Treadstone season 2 would likely have continued the 1970s storyline and shown the origins of Treadstone, which was modeled after the notorious KGB program Cicada.

Meanwhile, in present-day, awakened cicada Agent SoYun (Han Hyo-joo) discovers that her family allowed her son to be sent off to the same facility where she was once turned into an asset. It also seemed that Ellen Becker (Michelle Forbes) was set to take over Treadstone and its assets in Treadstone season 2. Much of Treadstone&#39;s season 1 finale was spent setting things up for Treadstone season 2 rather than wrapping up plot threads, so the cancellation of Treadstone season 2 became even more disappointing.



 Treadstone Season 2 Was A Victim Of Streaming Dominating Cable 
          




The advent of streaming services changed the cable television landscape permanently, and Treadstone season 2 fell victim to this shift. The USA Network, which once housed Treadstone, went through a lot of changes around 2016 and into the pandemic, thanks to services like Netflix and Hulu slowly taking over the game. Once the pandemic hit, it was clear that streaming services ruled when it came to television programming, and a lot of cable networks had to turn over their shows or risk being left behind.

It was during 2020 that the USA Network underwent a massive change, prompting the cancelation of Treadstone. During the growth of streaming services, USA was forced to cut back on many of its scripted programming in favor of reality TV and live programming, such as WWE events and sports. Along with Treadstone season 2, USA was forced to also cut Dare Me, The Purge, and Sinner from their lineup. Had Treadstone been released before the era of Netflix and Peacock, it&#39;s quite possible that the series could&#39;ve run for a long time, and Treadstone season 2 might have happened.






 There Were Big Plans For Bourne Beyond Treadstone Season 2 
Treadstone Could Have Connected More Directly To The Bourne Movies
          

Hindsight makes the fact Treadstone season 2 isn&#39;t happening even more jarring, as there were initially bold ambitions for the future of the Bourne franchise and Treadstone&#39;s place in it. Just a couple of weeks into Treadstone season 1, producer Ben Smith, who worked on the show and the Bourne movies, commented on the plans for a movie that would properly tie the two worlds together (via The Playlist).

The producer explained, &#34;We are definitely working on another film... Will there be connected tissue in terms of are we all existing within the same world and universe? Absolutely. The details of that are still under wraps.&#34; In 2019, this very well could have been a promising project. However, given the failure of the series and why Treadstone season 2 was canceled, it&#39;s no surprise the movie has likely been shelved.






 Where Does The Bourne Franchise Go Following Treadstone Season 2&#39;s Cancelation? 
Damon May Be Returning To The Franchise With A New Director
         

Even though Treadstone season 2 isn&#39;t happening, it doesn&#39;t mean that the Bourne franchise is completely over. In fact, there have recently been talks of Jason Bourne 6 happening with Matt Damon returning to the role. Previously, director Paul Greengrass had stated that his time with the franchise was over, and Damon said he only wanted to work on Greengrass-led Bourne projects.

However, that stipulation on Damon&#39;s part seems to have been dropped as it was reported that there is a new Bourne movie in the works in which Damon would star with Oscar-nominated director Edward Berger (All Quiet on the Western Front) taking the helm. It is unclear if the movie will tie into the previous spinoff movie The Bourne Legacy starring Jeremy Renner. However, with the cancellation of Treadstone season 2, it isn&#39;t likely the failed show will play into the sequel at all.
