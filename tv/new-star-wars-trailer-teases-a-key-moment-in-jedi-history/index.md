## Literature Review
The latest trailer for Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures teases one of the most important events in the history of the Jedi - a thrilling twist!




Lucasfilm has released a new trailer for Young Jedi Adventures, setting up one of the key events in the history of the Jedi Order. Star Wars&#39; award-winning children&#39;s animated series, Young Jedi Adventures is set during the High Republic Era - roughly 200 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. Introduced in a stunning transmedia initiative, the High Republic Era is one in which the light of the Jedi and the Republic shone brightly across the galaxy - but it did not go unopposed. Previous episodes of Young Jedi Adventures have already featured the Nihil, a group of space pirates who would try to wipe out the Jedi.




Lucasfilm has released an official trailer revealing more episodes of Young Jedi Adventures will drop on Disney&#43; on February 14. The trailer also teases one of the most important events in the High Republic Era, suggesting it will be (re-)told in an episode.


 

This trailer shows a major Jedi ceremony, one attended by the Republic&#39;s Chancellor Lina Soh. There&#39;s only one reason she would be attending a ceremony on the Outer Rim; this is the opening of Starlight Beacon, a space station that served as the vanguard of Jedi and Republic presence on the Outer Rim.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    





 Young Jedi Adventures Is Catching Up With Star Wars: The High Republic Phase I 
          

Lucasfilm&#39;s Star Wars: The High Republic transmedia initiative is divided into three phases, and the opening of Starlight Beacon is a key event in phase one - specifically in Charles Soule&#39;s Light of the Jedi. This means Young Jedi Adventures is now moving to a time period profoundly affected by the Nihil, as well as a carnivorous race of plant creatures known as the Drengir. It also means this is only months away from one of the most devastating blows ever struck against the Jedi, the moment the Nihil successfully destroyed Starlight Beacon.

Still, those events are surely a long way down the line. For now, viewers will be excited to see how Young Jedi Adventures navigates this time period - not least because Master Yoda is about to be otherwise engaged. Young Jedi Adventures may be aimed at younger viewers, but these next few episodes look like essential viewing for all fans.
