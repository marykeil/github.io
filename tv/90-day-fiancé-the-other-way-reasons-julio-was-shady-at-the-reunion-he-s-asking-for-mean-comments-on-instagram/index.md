The young couple fell in love, and Julio was eager to leave behind New York and move to the Netherlands to be with Kirsten. However, their relationship became messy when Kirsten visited him. For starters, Julio didn&#39;t tell his mother about his relationship and plans to move. His mom was shocked and devastated when he sprung the information on her. Julio also suggested having separate apartments after his move before he ultimately dumped Kirsten over a video call while he laughed at her tears.
