## Literature Review
On 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All, Shekinah Garner looks like a judgemental person who disses other women for no valid reason.




Shekinah Garner went from being unlikeable to downright mean during the 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 Tell All. She’s most known for her romance with her “bad boy” lover, Sarper Güven. She debuted on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5 and quickly became controversial for her past relationship failures and lack of self-worth. Initially, Shekinah introduced herself as a bold woman who broke free from her family’s Amish background. However, it soon became clear that she still had some personal issues since she pursued a man like Sarper, who had slept with over 2500 women.




Sarper’s toxic personality and masculine demands drove Shekinah to the edge during the season. He asked her to lose weight, be a certain size, and make unnecessary sacrifices. The Turkish man also pushed Shekinah to give him a baby, which turned into a major argument. In one of the later episodes, he called her a “b**ch” and “sl*t” in front of her sister. Shekinah seemed like a pushover for most of the season, drastically changing her image. However, she surprised viewers by changing her personality during Tell All. The single mom showed a razor-sharp attitude during the reunion and picked fights.

 Shekinah Doesn’t Get Along With Her Castmates 

 

Shekinah transformed into a mean girl by not getting along with her fellow cast members. Unlike newcomers who often pick sides during Tell All, she had no preference. She didn’t seem to like anyone and certainly didn’t make many friends. In a recent Reddit discussion (via Cantstress_thisenuff), a social media user wrote that Sheiknah “diDn’T cOmE tO mAkE fRiEnDs,” because she clearly couldn’t. The Redditor claimed that Shekinah’s “own sisters” don’t want to be her friends because of her mean attitude. Shekinah didn’t mince her words and called out everyone, from Brandan DeNuccio and Mary Demasu-ay to Andrei Castravet.






 Shekinah Comes Off As Conceited 
          

Shekinah also showed narcissistic behavior during Tell All. She seemed to have an inflated sense of her worth and was excessively proud of herself. Many Redditors noticed Shekinah’s mean and conceited behavior during Tell All and took to social media to joke about her. A Reddit user wrote, “homegirl thinks she looks better than she actually does,” pointing out the obvious. Another Redditor commented, “she thinks she’s the strong female lead character, when in reality she’s the b**chy frenemy secondary.” People are right when they say that Shekinah was full of herself throughout all three reunion episodes.



 Fans Even Compared Shekinah To Gretchen Wieners From Mean Girls 
          




Recently, many fans discussed how Shekinah resembled the energy of “Gretchen Wieners from Mean Girls.” In the 2004 comedy film, Gretchen is an extremely pessimistic and negative person. She’s very self-conscious and embodies a mean-spirited attitude toward others. Shekinah is very much the same for taking shots at Holly Weeks and Mary. She didn’t look into the mirror before mocking her fellow co-stars. She was extra awful to all the women during Tell All, making her look like a bully. Shekinah is in her mid-40s, and many 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way fans think she’s probably 20 years too old to be a mean girl.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
