Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1, episode 5 reunites Percy, Annabeth, and Grover after their confrontation with Echidna, and it contains numerous references to Rick Riordan&#39;s books, Greek mythology, and even pop culture. Titled &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers,&#34; the fifth installment introduces Ares, the Greek god of war, and sends Percy and Annabeth on a detour for him. The trio runs into Clarisse&#39;s Olympian father while continuing their journey on foot, and he offers to help them get to their next destination faster if they complete a task.
In order to obtain Ares&#39; help, Percy and Annabeth are forced to retrieve his shield from an amusement park called Waterland — one built by the Greek god Hephaestus. While this particular twist isn&#39;t in Riordan&#39;s books, it puts an interesting spin on the chapter the episode adapts. Percy Jackson episode 5 raises the stakes and covers a lot of lore, and some of the references to the source material and Greek mythology are so subtle that viewers could miss them.
Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episodes 1-5 are streaming on Disney&#43;. 










 








 12  Episode 5&#39;s Title Is Taken From The Lightning Thief 
Percy Jackson&#39;s Episode Titles Are Chapter Titles
        

Like all of Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1&#39;s episode titles, &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers&#34; is taken from a chapter of The Lightning Thief. While it isn&#39;t the only chapter covered in the latest installment, it does contain most of the events from episode 5. In The Lightning Thief, Percy still goes to Waterland in exchange for Ares&#39; help, though the whole scenario plays out differently in the source material. The events of &#34;I Become a Known Fugitive&#34; are also worked into the show&#39;s fifth installment, as is the very beginning of &#34;We Take a Zebra to Vegas.&#34;





 11  Annabeth Seeing The Fates References A Cut Scene From The Lightning Thief 
The Fates Appear Earlier &amp; Under Different Circumstances In The Books
        

Annabeth sees the Fates before Percy emerges from the water near the Gateway Arch, and this scene puts an interesting spin on a moment that happens early in The Lightning Thief. In Riordan&#39;s book, Percy and Grover see the Fates on the way home from Yancy Academy. Grover insists that this is an omen that Percy will die, but none of this unfolds in the Disney show. Instead, Annabeth sees the trio later on, and their appearance raises questions about who will actually die. The TV series&#39; spin on this moment manages to reference the books while creating new stakes.





 10  Gabe&#39;s Interview Is A Nod To A Book Subplot 
Percy&#39;s Step-Father Accuses Him Of Wrongdoing Earlier In The Books
        

In the Percy Jackson books, Gabe is the reason Percy becomes a &#34;known fugitive,&#34; and it happens earlier than the disaster at the Gateway Arch. Gabe reports Percy and Sally&#39;s disappearance, and he tries to pin the latter on his step-son. Percy learns about this before he leaves for his quest, and the police become more interested as disastrous things happen around him. Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show doesn&#39;t mention Gabe&#39;s response to Sally and Percy&#39;s disappearance, but episode 5&#39;s news report sees Gabe making allegations against Percy that mirror those from the book.





 9  Ares Is A Twitter Troll 
Percy Jackson Hilariously Blends Its Story With Modern-Day Social Media
        

Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5 contains one of the best references to the real world, as it reveals that Ares is a Twitter troll. When Percy, Annabeth, and Grover meet the Olympian god at a diner, Ares tells them to wait, as he&#39;s finishing an argument that he started on the social media platform. This addition to the story hilariously blends modern-day culture with Riordan&#39;s story. It just makes sense that the God of War has a platform on Twitter.





 8  Ares Mentions The Greek Myth About Kronos 
This Greek Mythology Reference Will Be Important Later
        

It&#39;s no surprise that Percy Jackson references Greek myths throughout its run, and &#34;A God Buys Us Cheeseburgers&#34; mentions the story of Kronos, which will prove important later on. While speaking about the gods and the war that&#39;s likely to unfold over Zeus&#39; Lightning Bolt, Ares gets passionate about his family. He mentions Kronos, the King of the Titans and father of Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia (via Britannica). Ares recalls how Kronos ate his own children so that they wouldn&#39;t be his downfall, but Zeus eventually sent him to Tartarus. This detail is true to Greek mythology, and it will prove important later in Percy&#39;s story.





 7  Percy Jackson Episode 5 Contains A Saving Private Ryan Nod 
Ares References The World War II Movie


 







While Grover and Ares are alone at the diner, Grover attempts to get information from the Olympian god by flattering him. He claims to be a big fan of Ares&#39; wars, and Ares questions whether the satyr is &#34;a casual World War II buff.&#34; He goes on to say, &#34;You&#39;ve seen Saving Private Ryan, have you?&#34; It&#39;s a comical pop culture reference, even if Grover&#39;s approach winds up working.





 6  Grover References Real But Lesser-Known Wars At The Diner 
He Mentions The Turbot War, Lobster War, And The Three Hundred &amp; Thirty-Five Years War
        

After Ares&#39; Saving Private Ryan jab, Grover lists the god&#39;s &#34;deep cuts&#34; — his lesser-known wars that people don&#39;t still discuss. Grover mentions the Turbot War, Lobster War, and the 335 Years War as some of his &#34;favorites,&#34; and all of these are real conflicts. The Turbot War was a clash between Spain and Canada in 1995 that started over fishing (via British Sea Fishing). The Lobster War unfolded between France and Spain in the 1960s, and according to The National Archives, was also over fishing, focusing on lobster specifically. The final war mentioned is the longest conflict between the Isles of Scilly and the Netherlands (via War History Online).





 5  Percy Jackson Episode 5 References Aphrodite&#39;s Affair With Ares 
This Affair Is True To Greek Mythology
        

Another Greek mythology reference in Percy Jackson episode 5 comes from the discussion of Aphrodite&#39;s affair with Ares. Percy and Annabeth talk about this during the episode, revealing that Aphrodite had romantic relations with the God of War despite being married to Hephaestus. This is faithful to Greek mythology, which depicts Hephaestus and Aphrodite&#39;s relationship as an unhappy one (via Mythology Source). The fact that Hephaestus built traps to catch his wife with her lover is also highlighted in Percy Jackson, which shows his ability to create such contraptions.





 4  Percy Jackson Features &#34;What Is Love (Baby Don&#39;t Hurt Me)&#34; 
The Pop Song Plays During The Tunnel Of Love Scene
        

A fun addition to the Tunnel of Love scene from Riordan&#39;s book is the song &#34;What Is Love (Baby Don&#39;t Hurt Me)&#34; by Haddaway. Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5 plays this hit as Percy and Annabeth make their way through the supposedly romantic ride, and it&#39;s hilarious, especially with Annabeth&#39;s lack of pop culture knowledge. It also alludes to the feelings Percy and Annabeth are starting to develop for one another — though they aren&#39;t fully there yet.





 3  Ares &amp; Athena&#39;s Relationship Mirrors Greek Mythology 
        

During Ares&#39; discussion with Grover, he makes it clear that he resents Athena. In fact, this is obvious from his interactions with Annabeth alone, all of which are full of venom. Ares rants about how Athena is viewed as a genius, even taking a hit at her symbol, the Owl of Athena. The friction between the Olympians mirrors Greek mythology, which often depicts them as rivals who don&#39;t get along (via Theoi Greek Mythology). Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians sticks to this portrayal of the siblings, adding an interesting layer to Ares&#39; anger and his interactions with Athena&#39;s daughter.





 2  Annabeth Calls Percy Seaweed Brain In Episode 5 
This Is Her Nickname For Him In The Percy Jackson Books


 







Percy Jackson episode 5 marks the first time Annabeth calls Percy &#34;Seaweed Brain&#34; in the Disney&#43; show, and she drops this nickname when they&#39;re arguing over who will sacrifice themselves for Ares&#39; shield. When Percy insists he&#39;ll be the one to sit on Hephaestus&#39; Golden Throne, Annabeth tells him, &#34;This isn&#39;t the arch, Seaweed Brain.&#34; This is what Annabeth calls Percy throughout Riordan&#39;s novels, and it becomes an affectionate nickname over time. It&#39;s great to see episode 5 including it, showing that Annabeth and Percy are becoming closer to and comfortable with each other.





 1  Percy Jackson Features Hephaestus&#39; Golden Throne 
Percy Sits In The Chair That Once Trapped Hera


 







In a change from the Percy Jackson books, Percy and Annabeth are forced to retrieve Ares&#39; shield from Waterland by sitting on Hephaestus&#39; golden throne. This seat is pulled from Greek myths, and the lore behind it is similar. The chair traps any person who sits on it, engulfing them in gold. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus gets revenge on his mother, Hera, in this manner. He only releases the goddess after prompting from Dionysus and an offer to marry Aphrodite (via Greek Legends and Myths). Much of Hephaestus&#39; story is left intact in Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians episode 5, though he does show kindness at the end.
