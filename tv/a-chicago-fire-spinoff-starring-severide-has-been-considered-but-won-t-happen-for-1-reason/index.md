# A Chicago Fire Spinoff Starring Severide Has Been Considered, But Won t Happen For 1 Reason


## SUMMARY 



  A Severide-centric spinoff of Chicago Fire was considered but didn&#39;t move forward due to his crucial role in the main show.   The season 12 premiere explores Severide&#39;s return and the impact of his absence on his relationship with Stella Kidd.   Taylor Kinney&#39;s character is important to the main series, suggesting he could stick around in Chicago Fire.

## Literature Review

Chicago Fire&#39;s showrunner reveals that a spinoff around Taylor Kinney&#39;s Kelly Severide was considered, ultimately explaining why it didn&#39;t happen.




A Chicago Fire spinoff centered around Taylor Kinney&#39;s Severide was considered bur was not pursued for one specific reason. In the role of Kelly Severide, Kinney has been with the NBC procedural since its first episode in 2012. The actor stepped away from Chicago Fire for a personal leave of absence during its eleventh installment but made a high-profile return for season 12.




In comments to HELLO!, showrunner Andrea Newman revealed that Kinney&#39;s hiatus impacted how the One Chicago franchise could have gone. While discussing Severide&#39;s return in season 12, Newman shared that a Severide-centric spinoff was considered. However, because Severide was so integral to the main show, as his brief departure illustrated, the idea never moved forward. In the quote below, Newman also detailed how the spinoff would have been focused on the OFI (the Office of Fire Investigation):


We have [considered it] but having lost Severide for a bit [in season 11,] it was a reminder of what a critical part of 51 he is. OFI is a great internal struggle. As Kidd says early on in the episode, she considers arson as his &#39;drug,&#39; and it&#39;s an addiction for him and he gets lost in it.
It&#39;s partly because it&#39;s in the blood, his dad was also in OFI, but partly because there&#39;s something that just taps into something deep within him when he gets into it. It then becomes a danger zone for him in some ways â€“ but he also loves it and obviously has the skills for it. So that struggle will be a big part of the first few episodes of the season.






 How Chicago Fire Season 12 Welcomes Severide Back 
          

The season 12 premiere, fittingly titled &#34;Barely Gone,&#34; explored Severide&#39;s return, why he was gone, and how that absence has impacted his relationship with Stella Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo). At first, things seemed good for the couple as they even shared a steamy shower. But eventually, trouble started when Severide resumed his interest in potential arson investigations. It seems to be a particular sore spot since Severide has already been away for a significant time on an arson investigation training program in Alabama.

In the episode, written by Newman and directed by Reza Tabrizi, it&#39;s suggested by Kidd that Severide didn&#39;t want to return home. She feels their relationship is in a worse place because of his absence, saying they&#39;ll need time to build back trust. Severide&#39;s gut instinct to investigate helps avert a crisis, though it&#39;s clear that his marriage needs time to try and recover.




                  Severide&#39;s Exit Looks A Lot More Likely After Chicago Fire Season 12, Episode 1   Taylor Kinney has returned as Kelly Severide in Chicago Fire season 12, episode 1, &#34;Barely Gone&#34; but he may not be staying for very long.    

The wider Chicago Fire world, which includes Law &amp; Order, has successfully done a character-focused spinoff in the past with Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime. But for audiences hoping Severide will stick around despite no news yet on the Chicago Fire season 13 renewal, Newman&#39;s comments are a potentially positive sign because they underline how important Taylor Kinney&#39;s character is to the main series.



Chicago Fire season 12 airs every Wednesday on NBC, while also streaming on Peacock.
