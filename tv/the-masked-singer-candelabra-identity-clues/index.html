<p>Candelabra’s One Hit Wonders Night Performance &amp; Clues</p>
<p>On The Masked Singer One Hit Wonders Night, Candelabra sang an exciting rendition of &ldquo;1 Thing&rdquo; by Amerie, while dancing. When Candelabra took the stage, Jenny commented that she looked like she could be a dancer, and Robin agreed and mentioned Paula Abdul. Candelabra greeted Nick with a hug before her clue package was revealed. The clue package opened with a scene outside of a castle. Candelabra began with, &ldquo;From a young age, I always had a fire burning inside of me to achieve my wildest dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scene then switched to a room inside the castle. Candelabra then took out a smartphone and called actor and comedian Kevin Hart. She continued, &ldquo;At just 12 years old, sitting up in my room, I called performers from my hometown begging them to give me a chance to be on stage. Finally, one said yes, and my career ignited.&rdquo; The scene then transitioned as flames engulfed the screen.</p>
<p>Candelabra was then shown warming her hands in front of a fireplace in a room with a trunk. She said, &ldquo;But that never slowed my hustle. I had to continue to fight hard to keep my flame going. You could say I was burning the candle at both ends.&rdquo; A framed photograph of a young Candelabra was then shown on a table. The ornate gold frame had a blue butterfly decoration in the corner. Candelabra was then seen fanning the flames of the fire in the fireplace. She shared, &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve reaped the rewards of my hard work with fans all over the world and plenty of accolades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 9 contestant Candelabra went on to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of where my drive has taken me, but now I&rsquo;m looking for a place to let loose, and The Masked Singer feels like a perfect place to have fun.&rdquo; As she said this, a wall with a framed green map of the state of California and other pictures were shown. She then picked up a present wrapped in white wrapping paper with a red bow with a gift tag that said, &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Naughty List.&rdquo; Candelabra concluded with, &ldquo;And with this fire, the Golden Mask is mine!,&rdquo; as she blew a kiss to the screen.</p>
<p>After Candelabra&rsquo;s performance, the Masked Singer One Hit Wonders karaoke machine played &ldquo;Two Princes&rdquo; by Spin Doctors. Candelabra then explained her connection to the song. She said, &ldquo;Listen. Who needs two princes when you have one fire princess?&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>              The Masked Singer Season 10: Every Celebrity Reveal   The Masked Singer season 10 had 17 incredible reveals. Here's every celebrity who was unmasked in the mystery singing competition's milestone season.    
</code></pre>
<p>Candelabra&rsquo;s Trolls Night Performance &amp; Clues</p>
<p>On Trolls Night, Candelabra sang &ldquo;All My Life&rdquo; by K-Ci &amp; JoJo. Candelabra began her clue package by saying, &ldquo;Making my debut on the Masked Singer stage last week was so much fun. Hearing the praise from the panel really set my competitive side aflame.&rdquo; She was then shown walking in front of a burning house. Candelabra said, &ldquo;I think I get my fighting spirit from my childhood. Growing up, I had to be tough.&rdquo; The fire spread to the ground, and Candelabra walked through it.</p>
<p>Candelabra went on to say, &ldquo;My mom was in and out of my life, and I was on my own a lot, until some family friends took me in.&rdquo; She continued, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve learned from a young age, that the only person I could really depend on was myself.&rdquo; Billowing smoke came from the house as Candelabra held up a pair of black shoes. She was then shown in front of the castle from One Hit Wonders Night as she continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked hard for everything I&rsquo;ve got, and I always strive for more because I&rsquo;m never fully satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Candelabra then looked at a ring in a box with a question mark printed in the lid. She concluded by saying, &ldquo;So, tonight, I&rsquo;m not resting on the praise from last week. I&rsquo;m gonna get out on that stage and fight like I always have.&rdquo; As she said this, yellow and blue animated butterflies flew around her. After Candelabra&rsquo;s performance, Poppy and Branch from Trolls revealed another clue which was a tea set with The Masked Singer printed on the teapot and the words &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;tea&rdquo; printed on each teacup. Candelabra explained, &ldquo;I want you to know that on and off the camera, I&rsquo;m keeping it one hundred real.&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>              The Masked Singer: Anteater Identity &amp; Clues   Anteater was one of the 16 mystery celebrity singers competing on The Masked Singer season 10. Find out how the clues revealed his true identity.    
</code></pre>
<p>Candelabra&rsquo;s Holiday Sing-A-Long Clue</p>
<p>During The Masked Singer season 10 Holiday Sing-A-Long, another clue was given about Candelabra. It was Robopine from The Masked Singer season 5. Robopine was Tyrese Gibson. Candelabra explained, &ldquo;Ah, a costume after my own heart. And the person ain&rsquo;t too bad either. A real gift, Robopine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Candelabra&rsquo;s Soundtrack To My Life Night (Group C Finals) Performances &amp; Clues</p>
<p>On The Masked Singer Soundtrack to My Life Night, Candelabra sang an inspiring version of Mary J. Blige&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Goin&rsquo; Down.&rdquo; She began her clue package by saying, &ldquo;Continuing to set the stage ablaze in this competition feels amazing, and I&rsquo;m pumped to have made it to the Group C finale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked what song she was singing as the soundtrack to her life, Candelabra replied, &ldquo;Tonight I&rsquo;m gonna be singing &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Goin&rsquo; Down&rsquo; by Mary J. Blige. It&rsquo;s a song about heartbreak, which I&rsquo;ve definitely experienced.&rdquo; A cardboard box with the label, &ldquo;From the Angels,&rdquo; was then shown. Candelabra explained, &ldquo;I was in a relationship for a long time with someone I deeply loved. We had a child and built a life together, but he proved to me over and over again that I couldn&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Candelabra continued, &ldquo;I tried to stay for our child, but, ultimately, staying wasn&rsquo;t good for any of us, and I chose to walk away.&rdquo; Candelabra then held up playing cards - a royal flush with hearts. She concluded with, &ldquo;I learned that, in that moment, I had to love myself first, and, since then, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing. So, tonight, I&rsquo;m sharing my whole heart on that stage, and, hopefully, it&rsquo;s enough to get me to the finals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Candelabra&rsquo;s performance, another clue about her identity was revealed. The contestants were asked to dedicate a mixtape to a panelist to whom they had a special connection. Candelabra&rsquo;s mixtape said, &ldquo;Party Jams.&rdquo; Candelabra explained, &ldquo;Nicole, I&rsquo;ll never forget the fun we had partying at an industry party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later in the episode, after Anteater was unmasked and revealed to be singer John Oates, Candelabra and Donut faced off in the Battle Royale. They both sang &ldquo;Wanted&rdquo; by Hunter Hayes. Donut made it to the Masked Singer season 10 finale, while Candelabra was eliminated and unmasked.</p>
<p>Candelabra’s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists</p>
<p>The Masked Singer panelist Ken used the princess clue to guess that Candelabra was Mariah Carey. However, Nick said that he would know his &ldquo;Baby Mama.&rdquo; Ken then changed his guess to Regina Hall because of the Kevin Hart clue. Jenny disagreed, but Nicole said that it wasn&rsquo;t a bad guess. Nicole thought that Candelabra might be Brandy because she played the lead role in Cinderella. Robin gushed that Candelabra&rsquo;s voice was so powerful that she had to be a professional recording artist. He predicted that she could be the star of The Princess and the Frog, Anika Noni Rose. Jenny and Nicole loved that guess.</p>
<p>On Trolls Night, Nicole came up with a list of &ldquo;epic singers&rdquo; who had their own reality show, including Tamar Braxton, Monica, and Fantasia Barrino, but she thought that maybe Keyshia Cole was the best guess because Keyshia is known as the Princess of Hip Hop Soul. Jenny guessed Ashanti, while Ken predicted that Candelabra might be Kelly Rowland.</p>
<p>During The Masked Singer Soundtrack to My Life Night, the panelists made their final guesses before Candelabra was unmasked. They guessed that Candelabra might be Kelly Rowland (Ken) and Brandy (Jenny). However, Nicole and Robin guessed that Candelabra was Keyshia Cole.</p>
<p>Candelabra&rsquo;s Identity Is Revealed</p>
<p>Although The Masked Singer would&rsquo;ve been lucky to have any of the legendary singers that the panelists guessed, Candelabra was unmasked and revealed to be singer and icon, Keyshia Cole. The castle and princess clues referred to her title as the Princess of Hip Hop Soul. Keyshia is from Oakland, California, and, when she was 12 years old, she met and recorded with MC Hammer, who&rsquo;s also from Oakland.</p>
<p>The phone call to Kevin Hart referenced her 2010 album, Calling All Hearts. The same might be true about the royal flush with hearts. The Christmas present that said, &ldquo;Santa&rsquo;s Naughty List,&rdquo; referred to her last name because naughty children are said to receive coal, which would be a play on her last name. The Tyrese Gibson Robopine clue referred to his appearance in her &ldquo;Love&rdquo; video. Nicole noticed that the royal flush could refer to her song, &ldquo;Playa Cardz Right,&rdquo; while Robin pointed out that the &ldquo;From the Angels&rdquo; clue could be about her song, &ldquo;Heaven Sent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Candelabra&rsquo;s Trolls Night clues told the story of Keyshia&rsquo;s childhood. Her biological mother struggled with addiction, so her family friends, Leon and Yvonne Cole, adopted her when she was two years old. The shoes referred to Keyshia&rsquo;s Steve Madden shoe collection. The reality television clue was a reference to Keyshia&rsquo;s many reality shows, including Keyshia Cole: The Way It Is, Keyshia &amp; Daniel: Family First (a show with her then-husband Daniel Gibson), Keyshia Cole: All In, and Keyshia Cole: My New Life. Unfortunately, Keyshia announced that she was officially divorced from Daniel on September 3, 2020. They had a son in 2010.</p>
<p>As The Masked Singer season 10&rsquo;s Candelabra, Keyshia lit up the stage with her incredible performances. She set the bar high for future singers. When she was unmasked, Nicole told her that she was an absolute force, and she was sorry that they didn&rsquo;t have the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell as an option, so that they could’ve saved her. Keyshia then sang a powerful reprise of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Goin&rsquo; Down.&rdquo; As Candelabra, Keyshia’s performances were truly spectacular, and her fire burned brightly on The Masked Singer.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
