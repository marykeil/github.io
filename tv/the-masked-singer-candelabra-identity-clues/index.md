Finally, one said yes, and my career ignited.&#34; The scene then transitioned as flames engulfed the screen.

Candelabra was then shown warming her hands in front of a fireplace in a room with a trunk. She said, &#34;But that never slowed my hustle. I had to continue to fight hard to keep my flame going.

Candelabra said, &#34;I think I get my fighting spirit from my childhood. Growing up, I had to be tough.&#34; The fire spread to the ground, and Candelabra walked through it.

Candelabra went on to say, &#34;My mom was in and out of my life, and I was on my own a lot, until some family friends took me in.&#34; She continued, &#34;But I&#39;ve learned from a young age, that the only person I could really depend on was myself.&#34; Billowing smoke came from the house as Candelabra held up a pair of black shoes.

When asked what song she was singing as the soundtrack to her life, Candelabra replied, &#34;Tonight I&#39;m gonna be singing &#39;I&#39;m Goin&#39; Down&#39; by Mary J. Blige. It&#39;s a song about heartbreak, which I&#39;ve definitely experienced.&#34; A cardboard box with the label, &#34;From the Angels,&#34; was then shown. Candelabra explained, &#34;I was in a relationship for a long time with someone I deeply loved. We had a child and built a life together, but he proved to me over and over again that I couldn&#39;t trust him.&#34;




Candelabra continued, &#34;I tried to stay for our child, but, ultimately, staying wasn&#39;t good for any of us, and I chose to walk away.&#34; Candelabra then held up playing cards - a royal flush with hearts. She concluded with, &#34;I learned that, in that moment, I had to love myself first, and, since then, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing.

After Candelabra&#39;s performance, another clue about her identity was revealed. The contestants were asked to dedicate a mixtape to a panelist to whom they had a special connection.

 Candelabra’s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists 
         

The Masked Singer panelist Ken used the princess clue to guess that Candelabra was Mariah Carey. However, Nick said that he would know his &#34;Baby Mama.&#34; Ken then changed his guess to Regina Hall because of the Kevin Hart clue. Jenny disagreed, but Nicole said that it wasn&#39;t a bad guess. Nicole thought that Candelabra might be Brandy because she played the lead role in Cinderella. Robin gushed that Candelabra&#39;s voice was so powerful that she had to be a professional recording artist. He predicted that she could be the star of The Princess and the Frog, Anika Noni Rose. Jenny and Nicole loved that guess.

On Trolls Night, Nicole came up with a list of &#34;epic singers&#34; who had their own reality show, including Tamar Braxton, Monica, and Fantasia Barrino, but she thought that maybe Keyshia Cole was the best guess because Keyshia is known as the Princess of Hip Hop Soul. Jenny guessed Ashanti, while Ken predicted that Candelabra might be Kelly Rowland.




During The Masked Singer Soundtrack to My Life Night, the panelists made their final guesses before Candelabra was unmasked. They guessed that Candelabra might be Kelly Rowland (Ken) and Brandy (Jenny). However, Nicole and Robin guessed that Candelabra was Keyshia Cole.



 Candelabra&#39;s Identity Is Revealed 

 

Although The Masked Singer would&#39;ve been lucky to have any of the legendary singers that the panelists guessed, Candelabra was unmasked and revealed to be singer and icon, Keyshia Cole. The castle and princess clues referred to her title as the Princess of Hip Hop Soul. Keyshia is from Oakland, California, and, when she was 12 years old, she met and recorded with MC Hammer, who&#39;s also from Oakland.

The phone call to Kevin Hart referenced her 2010 album, Calling All Hearts. The same might be true about the royal flush with hearts. The Christmas present that said, &#34;Santa&#39;s Naughty List,&#34; referred to her last name because naughty children are said to receive coal, which would be a play on her last name. The Tyrese Gibson Robopine clue referred to his appearance in her &#34;Love&#34; video. Nicole noticed that the royal flush could refer to her song, &#34;Playa Cardz Right,&#34; while Robin pointed out that the &#34;From the Angels&#34; clue could be about her song, &#34;Heaven Sent.&#34;




Candelabra&#39;s Trolls Night clues told the story of Keyshia&#39;s childhood. Her biological mother struggled with addiction, so her family friends, Leon and Yvonne Cole, adopted her when she was two years old. The shoes referred to Keyshia&#39;s Steve Madden shoe collection. The reality television clue was a reference to Keyshia&#39;s many reality shows, including Keyshia Cole: The Way It Is, Keyshia &amp; Daniel: Family First (a show with her then-husband Daniel Gibson), Keyshia Cole: All In, and Keyshia Cole: My New Life. Unfortunately, Keyshia announced that she was officially divorced from Daniel on September 3, 2020. They had a son in 2010.

As The Masked Singer season 10&#39;s Candelabra, Keyshia lit up the stage with her incredible performances. She set the bar high for future singers. When she was unmasked, Nicole told her that she was an absolute force, and she was sorry that they didn&#39;t have the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell as an option, so that they could’ve saved her. Keyshia then sang a powerful reprise of &#34;I&#39;m Goin&#39; Down.&#34; As Candelabra, Keyshia’s performances were truly spectacular, and her fire burned brightly on The Masked Singer.






The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on FOX.
