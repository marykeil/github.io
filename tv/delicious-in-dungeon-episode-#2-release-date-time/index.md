 What Happened In Delicious In Dungeon Episode 1? 
          




Delicious in Dungeon revolves around adventurers traversing a dungeon in the hopes of gaining rulership over a mythical kingdom, including the main characters Laios, Marcille, and Chilchuck. In Delicious in Dungeon episode #1, “Hot Pot/Tart”, Laios’ party was forced to leave the titular dungeon after they were defeated by the powerful red dragon, with said dragon even eating Laios’ sister, Falin. The three of them venture back into the dungeon to bring Falin back to life before she’s digested, and in order to survive off of a lack of funds, Laios, rather eagerly, convinces everyone to start eating the monsters they encounter in the dungeon.

With their new strategy in place, Laios’ party returns to the dungeon and recruits Senshi, a dwarf who’s surprisingly knowledgeable about the dungeon and how to cook the monsters. From there, the episode then split into two different segments of the party killing animals and making them into specific dishes. As implied by the title of episode #1, “Hot Pot/Tart”, the first half of Delicious in Dungeon episode #1 had Laios and his party making a hot pot from a scorpion, a slime, algae, and tree roots, and the second half had them making a tart from fruit harvested from carnivorous plants that almost ate Marcille.






 Delicious In Dungeon Is Already A Standout Fantasy Anime 
          

There’s only one episode of Delicious in Dungeon out so far, but it’s already shaping up to be a truly standout fantasy anime. The ridiculous nature of its premise is one thing, but the great writing that surrounds it, in addition to the always stellar animation and direction of Studio Trigger productions, has already made it one of the best shows of the winter 2024 season and a show that’s more than lived up to its hype. If Studio Trigger maintains that level of consistency, then Delicious in Dungeon could easily be one of the best anime of the year, and seeing that play out would be great to see.

Be sure to watch Delicious in Dungeon episode #2 when it releases on January 11.
