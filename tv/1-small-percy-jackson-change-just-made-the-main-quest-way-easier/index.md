# 1 Small Percy Jackson Change Just Made The Main Quest WAY Easier


## SUMMARY 



  The Disney&#43; adaptation of Percy Jackson and the Olympians has made changes to the source material, including Hermes&#39; presence and the introduction of an extra pearl in episode 6.   The addition of a fourth pearl makes Percy&#39;s quest easier and changes a key moment in the story, potentially removing an emotional dilemma for him.   In place of Percy&#39;s decision in the book, the focus may shift to the struggle of &#34;saving the world&#34; in the series, as the Summer Solstice has already passed, potentially leading to a difficult choice that could still hinder saving Sally or other circumstances different from the book.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 6 made one small change that makes his quest a lot easier. The Disney&#43; adaptation has introduced a few Percy Jackson changes to the books, mostly still in service of the larger story, such as Hermes&#39; presence in helping Percy and his friends get closer to the Underworld. Most intriguingly, this shows how the promise of faithfulness to the source material is rooted in a deep understanding of Rick Riordan&#39;s book series.

With only two episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 left, the anticipation for Percy fulfilling some of the Oracle&#39;s prophecy is high. Some Percy Jackson episode 6 story reveals increases the stakes for Percy&#39;s quest, such as the news that the Summer Solstice has passed, setting up big introductions for both Zeus and Poseidon. However, one particular change to the story may make Percy&#39;s quest easier and change a pinnacle moment in it.


 The Sea Nereid Gives Four Pearls In Percy Jackson Episode 6 
          




After magically reaching Santa Monica beach in Hermes&#39; car, Percy enters the sea, expecting to meet Poseidon, who requested the meeting. Instead, Poseidon&#39;s Nereid gives Percy four pearls after he insists on finishing the quest despite the Solstice passing. While the way in which Percy obtains these pearls stays true to the source material, there are only three given in the book. The Nereid explains that anyone from the sea can easily return using these, which will help him escape the Underworld.

Another interesting alteration is that the Nereid tells Percy before this to return to camp and that the quest is over. If Percy hadn&#39;t refused this, there&#39;s the impression that his Camp Half-Blood return would be disappointing instead of triumphant like in the book. Moreover, the Nereid warns Percy about showing doubtfulness around Hades as he uses this to trick those he encounters, but episode 6 prolongs revealing details about Hades by omitting this book detail. This sets up the focus for Percy&#39;s next steps to be &#34;[saving] what matters most,&#34; as the Oracle mentioned and the Nereid teases.




                  9 Easter Eggs &amp; Hidden Details In Percy Jackson Season 1 Episode 6   Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians season 1, episode 6 continues the trend of including Easter eggs and references to Greek myths and Rick Riordan’s books.   



 The Pearls Change Makes Percy’s Underworld Decision Easier 
          

The Nereid says to Percy, &#34;Save the world, and then go save your mother.&#34; This seamlessly ties into how the number of pearls will alter Percy&#39;s time in the Underworld. In Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Percy only having three pearls forces him to choose who stays behind in the Underworld, between him, Annabeth, Grover, and Sally. What adds to this is how he previously shares that he intends to save his mother, then chooses to leave her behind, thus fulfilling the prophecy&#39;s prediction that he would fail to save what&#39;s most important.




However, giving Percy a fourth pearl takes away this challenging dilemma for him, as well as undercuts the prophecy. The emotional conflict he feels when making this choice in the book will be lost in the series, as even the Nereid implies the fourth pearl is for Sally. However, given that the Summer Solstice has passed in Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, perhaps the real struggle will come in the first part of the Nereid&#39;s words - &#34;save the world.&#34; Percy may still be faced with making a challenging choice that could hinder helping Sally or another undisclosed circumstance.
