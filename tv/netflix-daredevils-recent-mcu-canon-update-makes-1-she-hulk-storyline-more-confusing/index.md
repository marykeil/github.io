# Netflix Daredevils Recent MCU Canon Update Makes 1 She-Hulk Storyline More Confusing


## SUMMARY 



  The recent updates on Daredevil: Born Again confirm that Netflix&#39;s Daredevil is now treated as MCU canon, leading to a more confusing relationship between She-Hulk and Daredevil.   The return of Karen Page in Daredevil: Born Again could complicate Matt&#39;s relationship with She-Hulk, as their on-and-off relationship in the Netflix series was never fully resolved.   Daredevil&#39;s confusing relationship status aligns with his portrayal in Marvel Comics, where he has had multiple love interests, reflecting the complex nature of his character in the MCU as well.

## Literature Review

The recent canon updates regarding Netflix’s Daredevil and the MCU potentially make one She-Hulk: Attorney at Law storyline more complicated.




One storyline from She-Hulk: Attorney at Law may become more confusing in light of recent updates regarding Daredevil: Born Again and whether the latter confirms Netflix&#39;s Daredevil as MCU canon. Since Charlie Cox reappeared in the MCU as Daredevil in Spider-Man: No Way Home and She-Hulk, the question of whether Netflix&#39;s Daredevil is MCU canon has often been raised. Since then, the answer has been somewhat confusing given that some aspects of Matt Murdock&#39;s MCU character seem to follow on from Netflix while others do not.




The debate around Daredevil&#39;s canon status became ever more prevalent when Daredevil: Born Again&#39;s MCU story was confirmed. The production of Daredevil: Born Again has certainly been tumultuous, with October 2023 bringing about a major overhaul of the show including different writers, showrunners, and directors. After this overhaul, the cast of Daredevil: Born Again has been much more open regarding whether the show is a continuation of the Netflix series or not. The most recent update is perhaps the most promising yet, though it could make one Daredevil MCU storyline from She-Hulk more confusing.


 She-Hulk &amp; Daredevil&#39;s Relationship Is Made More Complicated By Recent MCU Canon Updates 
          

The aspect of She-Hulk that is made slightly more complicated is the relationship between the titular character and Matt Murdock/Daredevil. Recently, Vincent D&#39;Onofrio - who plays Kingpin/Wilson Fisk in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil and the MCU - told The Hollywood Reporter that Daredevil: Born Again is now being treated as a continuation of the Netflix show since the creative overhaul the former received. This means that the events of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil are seemingly confirmed as MCU canon after many years of intense speculation.




                  So Are She-Hulk &amp; Daredevil A Thing Now In The MCU? (They Should Be)   She-Hulk: Attorney at Law explored Jen Walters&#39; struggles with dating in her 30s. She may, however, have a future with Matt Murdock, a.k.a. Daredevil.   

Further supporting this are recent reports that the characters of Karen Page and Foggy Nelson from Netflix&#39;s Daredevil are returning for Daredevil: Born Again. Given the new canon update of both versions of Daredevil, the return of Karen could complicate Matt&#39;s relationship with She-Hulk. In Netflix&#39;s Daredevil, Matt and Karen had a notably on-and-off relationship that was never entirely resolved. Therefore, the potential return of Karen means She-Hulk&#39;s setup of Matt and Jennifer Walters&#39; relationship is made more confusing.



 Daredevil’s Confusing Relationship Status In The MCU Is Comics Accurate 
          




That said, Daredevil having a confusing relationship status is fairly accurate to the character&#39;s depiction in Marvel Comics. Matt Murdock is notorious for having several love interests in the comics from Karen herself to the likes of Elektra, Black Cat, and Maya Lopez/Echo to name only a small handful. As such, it makes sense for the MCU to translate this aspect of Daredevil&#39;s character. The nature of Matt&#39;s relationship with women was also mentioned at length in Netflix&#39;s Daredevil by Foggy, with recent updates hinting this may continue in Daredevil: Born Again.
