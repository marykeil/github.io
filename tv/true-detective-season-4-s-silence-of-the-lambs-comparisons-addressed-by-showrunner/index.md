## SUMMARY 



  Jodie Foster&#39;s role as detective Liz Danvers in True Detective: Night Country has brought on comparisons to her previous law enforcement role, Clarice Starling in Silence of the Lambs.   Showrunner Issa López celebrates Foster and acknowledges that the show in general has clear inspiration that can be traced back to movies like Seven and Silence of the Lambs, but says that Danvers in Night Country is a unique character.   While the two properties share some similarities in terms of tone and general premise, the setting, characters, and themes are very different.

## Literature Review
Showrunner Issa López addresses the similarities between Jodie Foster’s Silence of the Lambs character and her True Detective season role 4.




True Detective: Night Country showrunner Issa López addresses comparisons between the new season and Silence of the Lambs. After first airing in 2013, HBO&#39;s hit detective drama returns for its fourth outing next week, introducing a new story and set of characters to follow. True Detective: Night Country stars Jodie Foster and Kali Reis as Liz Danvers and Evangeline Navarro, respectively, two reluctant detective partners investigating the disappearance of eight men from a research station in the town of Ennis, Alaska.




In a recent interview with The A.V. Club ahead of the True Detective: Night Country release date, López addresses the comparisons that are being made between the show and Silence of the Lambs. The comparisons mostly involve Foster, who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as FBI agent Clarice Starling in the 1991 film. Check out López&#39;s full comment below:


&#34;From the beginning, she was in my mind because, number one, we all want to see her more, we miss her, and having her in a TV series was going to give us all the chance to enjoy her for a longer time. And knowing the beast of an actor she is, because she is a beast, giving her the canvas to work at that level would be incredible.
&#34;And after rewatching True Detective, I was like, ‘This reminds me enormously of Seven.&#39; So then I rewatched Seven, which is masterful, and was like, &#39;Oh, this reminds me of The Silence Of The Lambs.&#39; And that’s the genealogy: The Silence Of The Lambs begets Seven begets True Detective begets Night Country. So why not go to the origin of it all?
&#34;We haven’t seen Jodie as a detective since [Silence], and it’s a very different character. But it is Jodie Foster and she is really, really finding the meat and the nerves and the soul of this new character. And we’ve never seen her, I think, the way we’re going to see her in Night Country. So that was a no-brainer.&#34;





                  True Detective Season 3 Ending Explained: Why The Finale Was Perfect   True Detective season 3&#39;s finale has proven divisive, going for thematic closure over mystery. Here&#39;s why it was a brilliant end to the show.    


 How True Detective Night Country Differs From Silence Of The Lambs 
          

On the surface, there are some similarities between True Detective: Night Country and Silence of the Lambs. Both are exceedingly dark tales following an investigator played by Foster as she tracks down a sinister killer. When it comes to details, however, the two properties become very distinct.



Night Country is the first season of the show not to be penned by series creator Nic Pizzolatto, though he remains onboard as an executive producer.







A key aspect of every season True Detective is two disparate detectives working together to solve a crime. In Silence of the Lambs, by contrast, Clarice&#39;s &#34;partner&#34; on the Buffalo Bill case is Hannibal Lector, a captured serial killer. True Detective: Night Country&#39;s Alaskan setting, too, is a stark departure from Silence of the Lambs&#39; Baltimore, as is the show&#39;s clear interest in cults.

While Danvers remains somewhat mysterious as a character, she will likely end up being quite different from Clarice. Foster, after all, is now 61 years old and won&#39;t be playing a new recruit this time around, with trailers suggesting that Danvers is an experienced, world-weary cop. That being said, however, True Detective: Night Country is shaping up to the creepiest and most unsettling season yet, two qualities that Silence of the Lambs has in spades.



The new season of True Detective premieres on January 14 on HBO.
