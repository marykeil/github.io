## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days fans are unable to recognize Christian after he reveals his stylish makeover in a surprising update with Cleo.




90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days star Christian Allgood is looking unrecognizable in a new update shared by Cleo Corraine about their relationship status. Christian from Minnesota became friends with London resident Cleo after coming across her profile on social media. Christian started dating her just four months before he flew to the UK to meet Cleo in person. Cleo being a trans woman wasn&#39;t something Christian&#39;s family was okay with. Christian was influenced by them and developed cold feet and decided he wasn&#39;t going to do any kind of PDA with Cleo in London. Christian refused to sleep with Cleo and when he did, told the producers he hadn&#39;t.




90 Day Fiancé fans were overjoyed when Cleo announced her split from Christian in October 2023, and even more so when Cleo suggested she was dating someone new, but the new boyfriend turned out to be Christian.


 

However, Christian looks very different in the photos that Cleo has posted with him on Instagram. So much so that a fan even commented, &#34;Who&#39;s the guy in glasses, in the 2nd photo?&#34; on Cleo&#39;s announcement post where she revealed she was back together with Christian. Christian was already balding when he filmed Before the 90 Days, but he&#39;s now shaved most of his hair off. Christian has also started wearing semi-rimless spectacles, which make him look like a new person altogether.

 Will Christian &amp; Cleo Return To 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

In her post about Christian, Cleo wrote, &#34;When you order Harry and Meg on AliExpress. A journal entry - Seeing as there’s still some confusion, we are still together.&#34; She explained that they weren&#39;t together for a month, which felt &#34;hellish&#34; to Cleo. Cleo said that their relationship wasn&#39;t perfect and that people made both of them aware of their best and worst traits. Cleo admitted that she wasn&#39;t oblivious to the &#34;negatives of our past.&#34; but there was always room to grow in their relationship. Cleo asked fans to respect the &#34;fragile love between a trans woman and a cis man.&#34; 90 Day Fiance fans had mixed reactions to Cleo&#39;s announcement.

Someone wrote, &#34;Ayyy he’s finally embracing the baldness. Best decision.&#34; A different fan commented, &#34;You deserve better…… We’ve all been there wishing you the best.&#34; Still, some fans were excited to know about their new journey ahead. Christian had proposed to Cleo on the Tell All set. Cleo had stayed with him in the U.S. for a few months before that. Christian said he would officially ask for Cleo&#39;s hand in marriage once they met in person again. He even revealed that Cleo&#39;s K-1 visa process was to begin after that. It was something they had discussed. Cleo was okay with moving to America to marry Christian.




She didn&#39;t mind that Christian had dismissed her feelings when he chatted with other women during their date. Cleo had even caught Christian getting pally with a woman on his Discord channel, who Christian revealed was interested in him. Cleo has been slammed for accepting Christian&#39;s proposal, but at the same time, Cleo does know what she is doing. There could have been a side to Christian that the cameras couldn&#39;t capture on 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days. It won&#39;t be surprising if Cleo and Christian&#39;s K-1 visa process is also documented in the reality TV franchise because of the amount of attention their reconciliation is getting at the moment.
