# Percy Jackson Medusa Actor Shares Issues She Had With Special Effects


## SUMMARY 



  Jessica Parker Kennedy found filming the special effects for Medusa in Percy Jackson and the Olympians to be a major CGI challenge.   Aryan Simhadri, who plays Grover, will also have to deal with discomfort from special effects, such as wearing a mo-cap suit for his satyr character.   Filming in the Underworld and working with CGI sets can be difficult for both actors and VFX teams, as there are no practical elements to ground the scenes.

## Literature Review
Percy Jackson&#39;s Medusa actor Jessica Parker Kennedy shares the issues she had with the special effects of the Greek being for the Disney&#43; show.




Jessica Parker Kennedy, who plays Medusa in the Disney&#43; show Percy Jackson and the Olympians, didn&#39;t have much fun with the show&#39;s special effects. The fantasy elements of the series require a lot of special effects. Percy Jackson and the Olympians follows the titular character as he learns that his absent father is actually a Greek god, and he gets a crash course in his demigod heritage. Each season of the series is expected to adapt one of the novels in the series from Rick Riordan, who also serves as a producer on the show.




Watch on Disney&#43;

With the series being a closer adaptation of the first book in Rick Riordan&#39;s novel series than the previous movies, Percy Jackson and the Olympians presents a wide variety of monsters and gods. Medusa, who terrorized Percy Jackson in the first book in the series, is one of the most difficult, as the studio replicates a mass of living snakes lashing around a human being&#39;s head. In Greek mythology, Medusa is a gorgon, a being that can turn others to stone, but she&#39;s best known for those living snakes, which need to be brought to life with computer-generated imaging in Percy Jackson and the Olympians.

                  Medusa’s Tragic Fate Calls Back To 1 Heartbreaking Sally Line In Percy Jackson Episode 1   Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians puts a tragic spin on the story of Medusa, and her fate calls back to a Sally Jackson line from the first episode.    


 Medusa&#39;s Snakes Are A Major CGI Challenge 
         




The previous adaptation of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief featured Uma Thurman in the role of Medusa, and though the character initially had her &#34;hair&#34; wrapped, CGI snakes were used to bring her to life as well. Kennedy&#39;s look as Medusa is very different in the television series. Her character wears hats that keep her hair covered and veils that keep her eyes obscured when she initially meets Percy and his friends, though they all know right away that she&#39;s actually Medusa. Keeping her head covered for most of the scenes means that only the confrontation between Medusa and Percy&#39;s friends has to employ a larger amount of CGI.

According to Kennedy, capturing Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; Medusa effects are a major CGI challenge. In an interview with Cageside, she revealed just how difficult the filming was, as not only was she forced to deal with the limitations of practical effects, but she also had to cope with the discomfort of using CGI as well. Check out what Kennedy shared below:





Parts of the scenes we did with some prosthetic snakes, so that was very cool. And other stuff, I had the little mo-cap on my head, which is like a very ridiculous, horrible looking little cap that doesn&#39;t flatter anyone. And so I was doing this regal part with that on. So you really just have to deep dive into character and do the best that you can, but it&#39;s easy because the writing is really wonderful in the show. I think people are going to love it.



 



 What Other Parts Of Percy Jackson Has Challenging Effects? 
         

Kennedy won&#39;t be the only one who has to deal with the discomfort of using special effects. Aryan Simhadri, who plays Grover in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, will likely have to cope with a mo-cap suit over the entirety of his lower body, as, after all, Grover is secretly a satyr. Whenever Grover isn&#39;t disguising his legs, Simhadri will need to portray a realistic satyr, which means an overwhelming amount of equipment, and also a huge drain on the show&#39;s budget. Simhadri has even mentioned that a side effect of his Percy Jackson Grover training has been that he has begun unconsciously walking like a goat, and it has gotten him some strained looks in public.




Another major challenge will be the entire trip to the Underworld. With the Underworld serving as an entirely new realm of existence, the Percy Jackson and the Olympians VFX teams will likely have nothing to work with outside a green screen. This can also make things difficult for actors, who will have to strain to make anything believable about the setting. While it isn&#39;t the first environment that has been entirely CGI, that sort of set can make circumstances less believable if there aren&#39;t practical elements to help ground the actors and the VFX teams.

Of course, not every difficult effect will have to do with CGI. With the Percy Jackson universe revolving around classic Greek and Roman deities, there is also a major focus on swords. Walker Scobell, the star of Percy Jackson and the Olympians, studied sword training techniques and even revealed that he had to learn to play ping pong with a sword. It&#39;s a major time investment for a 13-year-old to learn how to properly use a sword — especially if it means playing ping pong with one. So, while Jessica Parker Kennedy may have it rough in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, she doesn&#39;t appear to be alone.
