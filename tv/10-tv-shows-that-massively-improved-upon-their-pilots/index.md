# 10 TV Shows That Massively Improved Upon Their Pilots


## SUMMARY 


 Pilot episodes can be the weakest point of a TV show&#39;s entire run, especially in sitcoms where unique formulas can take time to fine-tune. 
 Old pilots can offer a glimpse into a parallel reality where shows turned out differently, and many great shows wouldn&#39;t have achieved success without learning from their pilot episodes. 
 Bad pilot episodes don&#39;t have to be a negative if shows can improve and evolve from them, ultimately looking radically different after the initial mediocre start.

## Literature Review
Not every show is able to hit the ground running, but luckily these TV shows sorted out the glaring issues from their underwhelming pilot episodes. 




Many TV shows have great pilots which they then struggle to live up to, but sometimes a pilot is the lowest point. Some great shows take a while to sort things out, and their pilot episode is the weakest in their entire run. This is often the case with sitcoms, because their unique formulas might take more time to fine tune, especially if they are pushing the boundaries and trying something new. Any genre can have the same problems, however, and pilots can be used to try out different ideas and figure out what works and what should be abandoned. Shows can look radically different after a mediocre pilot.
Pilot episodes aren&#39;t such an important phenomenon in the modern landscape of TV, especially with the rise of streaming services. This means that a lot of old pilots almost look like a glimpse into a parallel reality where shows turned out slightly differently. Some great shows never would have achieved the same level of success if they hadn&#39;t learned a few harsh lessons from their pilot episodes. Seinfeld, House and The Office probably wouldn&#39;t have taken off and lasted for so many seasons, and those are only a few examples. Bad pilot episodes don&#39;t have to be a negative if the shows can improve from them.









 








 10  Seinfeld (1989-1998) 
Seinfeld&#39;s pilot episode excluded one of the show&#39;s best characters


 







Seinfeld’s first episode doesn’t truly indicate how hilarious the show can become, and there were a few changes to the format before the next few episodes were produced. In the pilot, Jerry is uncertain about the romantic intentions of a woman who is coming to stay with him. Jerry and George’s dynamic is the same as always, but Kramer’s character is virtually unrecognizable. He’s a recluse called Kessler, and he seems more paranoid and less outgoing. But by far the biggest sin of the pilot episode is not having Elaine at all. Seinfeld’s final episode was controversial too, but everything in between made the show a huge hit.





 9  Blackadder (1982-1999) 
Blackadder had to change its entire approach
        

The entire first season of Blackadder fails to reach the heights of the rest of the show, but the pilot episode is particularly unenjoyable. The main problem is that the character of Blackadder is an inept buffoon, and those around him are far more competent. Eventually, the show would reverse this formula, making Blackadder the sole voice of reason in a sea of stupidity, but this would take a while. The show’s intelligent class satire didn’t take root immediately. Blackadder would go on to become a legendary historical-based sitcom, although sometimes the best advice is to ignore the first season entirely.





 8  Elementary (2012-2019) 
An iconic character has a rough transition to his new surroundings
        

Elementary updates Arthur Conan Doyle’s popular detective novels for the 21st Century, but the pilot episode marks a rough start for Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. At its best, Elementary can produce immersive puzzles, but the pilot episode meanders from one strange deduction to another. Sherlock Holmes is a difficult character to write for, especially with so many episodes, and the pilot has more in common with other American crime procedurals than it does with Doyle’s novels. Sherlock and Watson’s dynamic also isn’t fully formed in the pilot. It takes a few episodes for their relationship to blossom, and for Watson to start contributing more to the cases.





 7  House (2004-2012) 
Hugh Laurie&#39;s supporting cast needed time to dial it in
        

The pacing, the lighting, and the dialogue all feel a little less snappy in House’s pilot episode. 

House is also based on the character of Sherlock Holmes, although it’s a less stringent adaptation, with House as a doctor instead of a detective. His character is surprisingly well-formed in the pilot episode, but a lot of his surroundings change drastically in the next few episodes. The pacing, the lighting, and the dialogue all feel a little less snappy in House’s pilot episode. It would go on to become a sizzling drama, defined by doctors trading barbs, and House in particular showing a quick wit and a short temper. The pilot episode is ponderous and uncertain by comparison, with its protagonist being the saving grace.





 6  American Dad! (2005-) 
Roger remains hidden in the attic during the first season
        

American Dad had a tough task in trying to differentiate itself from Seth MacFarlane’s other colossal hit, Family Guy. The first episode introduces the Smith family, their talking fish, and the alien in their attic. The plot follows Stan as he uses his CIA tactics to rig a school election for Steve. This underlines the show’s more political humor, which was key to the first two or three seasons. Stan is more of a political caricature in the pilot, but the biggest drawback is that Roger’s character never leaves the house, so his many characters simply don’t exist. The best seasons of American Dad came a little later.





 5  Scrubs (2001-2010) 
The medical sitcom struggled to strike a tonal balance
        

Although the show would eventually find a balance between its breezy humor and the high-stakes setting of a hospital, the pilot episode struggles to establish the tone. Scrubs is a comedic take on medical procedurals, but the first episode can’t detach itself from the conventions of the genre for too long. When it does remember to be a comedy, the jokes often fall flat. The charm of the show’s core cast ultimately shines through, all except for the character of the Janitor, who is more of a grouchy antagonist than a playful nuisance. Scrubs has some emotionally devastating episodes, so it doesn’t always need an upbeat tone.





 4  30 Rock (2006-2013) 
Jack Donaghy proved to be too funny to ignore


 







Alec Bladwin’s smooth-talking business executive Jack Donaghy is one of the best characters in 30 Rock, but the pilot episode doesn’t give him enough screen time to strut his stuff. His introduction is brilliant, as he knocks the door down and tells Liz her old boss is dead, but then he fades into the background. The episode focuses much more on the writers’ room at TGS, and Liz’s working relationship with her producer Pete Hornberger. These are both important for 30 Rock’s appeal, but the heart of the show is Liz and Jack’s combative dynamic. It just took a couple of episodes to discover this.





 3  Peep Show (2003-2015) 
The show&#39;s experimental style yielded mixed results
        

Peep Show chose to boldly reinvent the sitcom formula, but its pilot episode contained a few teething problems. The difficulties of the narration and the POV camera angles are more apparent in the pilot than in later episodes. There are a few great uses, but a lot of the internal monologue feels like a gimmick, rather than hilariously revealing jokes. The pilot episode sees Mark and Jez compete for the attention of their next-door neighbor, Toni. It does a good job of introducing the massive differences between the two friends, but the basic premise is unrefined, as is the show’s humor.





 2  The Office (2005-2013) 
The American version needed to establish its own identity
        

In its infancy, the American version of The Office was too similar to its British counterpart. 

The Office was based on a British sitcom of the same name, created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, and starring Gervais as David Brent. The pilot episode of the American version tried to use the same winning formula, but it failed to capture Gervais and Merchant’s idiosyncratic humor. In its infancy, the American version of The Office was too similar to its British counterpart, but the conventions of British television which it used did not work well in the surroundings of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Some important members of the cast of The Office were also yet to make their first appearances.





 1  New Girl (2011-2018) 
Cast changes weren&#39;t the only issue


 







The pilot episode of New Girl is a reminder of what the show was supposed to be about. There is much more focus on how the male roommates feel uncomfortable with Jess moving into their space. It’s more of a gender satire and less of the relatable friendship-based sitcom that the show would eventually develop into. Jess’ strange quirks are also ratcheted up in the pilot episode, but the most egregious difference is that Winston is nowhere to be seen. Winston replaces Coach after the New Girl pilot, but the show has a completely different dynamic without Lamorne Morris from the beginning.
