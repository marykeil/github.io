## SUMMARY 



  Natalie shouldn&#39;t have a baby with her estranged husband, Mike, as they have different mindsets and won&#39;t be able to co-parent effectively.   Natalie may end up resenting the child if she has a baby with Mike, just like she lost affection for him after marriage.   Mike&#39;s mom despises Natalie, so having a baby with him would invite interference in their child&#39;s life. Natalie would be happier with someone whose family adores her.

## Literature Review

90 Day: The Single Life’s Natalie Mordovtseva is better off not having a child with Mike Youngquist even though her biological clock is ticking.




Natalie Mordovtseva from 90 Day: The Single Life wants to have a baby with her estranged husband, Mike Youngquist, but she shouldn’t. The 38-year-old Ukrainian native debuted in the franchise a few years ago. She came to the United States to marry Mike, who lived near Washington. Initially, Natalie enjoyed her life with Mike and wanted to get serious with him. However, his lack of aspirations scared her, and she ran away from him soon after marriage. Natalie debuted on 90 Day: The Single Life in 2021 to pursue another partner, someone who’d fulfill all her needs.




Over the last three years, Natalie dated several men despite being married to Mike. Lately, she had been dating Josh Weinstein, who had no intentions of getting serious with her. However, one of Natalie’s dreams is to become a mom. She had wanted a baby for years, but she couldn’t find a good partner to have a child with. At the age of 38, Natalie is running out of options and time, so she recently decided to do the unthinkable. The recent episode of 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 showed her reconsidering her relationship with Mike. She feels he’s the perfect guy to have a child with.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?   


 Mike Youngquist &amp; Natalie Mordovtseva Can’t Co-Parent 
          




Natalie may think Mike is a good fit to be the father of her baby, but she’s overlooking the bigger picture. The reality star isn’t evaluating what it means to have a child with someone she intends to divorce. Natalie will never be able to co-parent her child with Mike due to their drastically different mindsets. The Washington native is into adventure sports and would want his child to avoid social media. In comparison, Natalie is all about showing off and posting for fans. The two reality TV stars will never be able to agree on how to raise their child.



 Natalie Mordovtseva Could Start To Resent The Child 
          

Natalie may love the idea of having a baby with Mike right now. However, she may change her mind later on as she did with her marriage. She was excited about her future when she tied the knot with Mike. Nonetheless, it only took a few months for her to lose all affection for him and run away. She may do the same if they have a child together. If Natalie wants a good parenting experience, she should only have a baby with someone she intends to spend her life with.






Once she’s over the initial baby phase, Natalie may not want to have the stress and responsibilities of mothering a child that belongs to her ex.






 Mike Youngquist’s Mom &amp; Natalie Mordovtseva Despise Each Other 
          

Natalie shouldn’t have a baby with Mike because of his mother. A grandparent is a great part of a child’s life. However, since Mike’s mom doesn&#39;t like Natalie after breaking her son’s heart, she wouldn’t let her be at peace with having his baby and will interfere in her grandchild’s life. Mike’s mom is a bold woman who doesn’t have a filter. The 90 Day: The Single Life star would be much happier having a baby with someone whose family adores her.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
