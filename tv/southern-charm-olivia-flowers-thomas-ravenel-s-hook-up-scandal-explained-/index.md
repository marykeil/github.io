## Literature Review

During part one of the Southern Charm season 9 reunion, Olivia Flowers admitted she once hooked up with former cast member Thomas Ravenel.  




Olivia Flowers sent shockwaves through the screen when she admitted she once hooked up with former cast member Thomas Ravenel during part one of the Southern Charm season 9 reunion. Thomas appeared on the Bravo series from seasons 1-5 until he was fired following sexual assault and battery allegations from more than one woman. His storyline on the show revolved around getting back into politics and his tumultuous relationship with fellow Southern Charm alum Kathryn Dennis. While Thomas and Kathryn were super toxic, their storyline was entertaining to witness.




It&#39;s been around two seasons since fans have seen Thomas on the series. The last time he appeared on the show was at the start of Southern Charm season 7 with Kathryn while she was filming a few scenes at home. However, since then, Thomas has spoken poorly about the show and some of its cast members. He and Kathryn also continue to have legal and custody issues regarding their two children together, so it wouldn&#39;t make sense for him to appear on the show again. When Taylor Ann Green brought up the hook-up between Olivia and Thomas, it was shocking, much like Thomas&#39; run on Southern Charm.

 Olivia &amp; Thomas Hooked Up When She Was In Her Early 20s 
         




During the Southern Charm season 9 reunion, Taylor dropped the bomb that Olivia once hooked up with Thomas. She brought it up as a way to make it seem like Olivia was no different from her. During the season, it was revealed that Taylor had kissed Austen Kroll, who dated Olivia last year. Kathryn, who is close friends with Olivia, was in an on-off relationship with Thomas. However, this did not go over well with Olivia. Firstly, Olivia clarified she was around 20 years old and drunk when the hook-up with Thomas took place and didn&#39;t even know Kathryn, let alone was friends with her. Taylor and Olivia&#39;s situation doesn&#39;t even compare.



 Olivia Wanted To Take The Hook-Up To Her &#34;Grave&#34; 
          

Olivia was furious with Taylor as soon as she implied the Thomas hook-up at the Southern Charm season 9 reunion. Taylor cryptically said, &#34;I&#39;m just saying, Olivia, forgive as you would want to be forgiven.&#34; Olivia was dumbfounded by Taylor&#39;s comment, as she knew exactly what she was referring to. &#34;Go ahead and say it. I already see what you&#39;re trying to do. You&#39;ve been hanging this over my head, I want to see it. Say it,&#34; Olivia said. After Taylor revealed Olivia and Thomas had hooked up, Olivia confirmed it did happen. However, Olivia planned on taking the one-night stand to her grave. Clearly, she wasn&#39;t proud of it.






 Thomas Claims Olivia &#34;Used&#34; Him 
          

Shortly after part 1 of the reunion had aired, Thomas spoke out about his reported hook-up with Olivia. In an exclusive interview with All About The Tea, Thomas confirmed that he and Olivia did hook up once but disputed some of the claims she made at the Southern Charm season 9 reunion. Thomas revealed that Olivia was 24 years old at the time, not 20 as she said, and was an aspiring actress.

&#34;I was in Atlanta the weekend of January 14, 2017, for my nephew’s wedding. Olivia was living in Atlanta at the time pursuing her acting career,&#34; the former politician confirmed, adding, &#34;I will say, she conducted herself as a classy lady that night. I would have never acknowledged having sex with her until they brought me up at the reunion.&#34; Thomas went on to describe their time together as a date, where the two went to restaurants and bars around Atlanta. Olivia then invited him back to her condo, and the two never spoke again. Thomas believes Olivia &#34;used&#34; him to gain access to Southern Charm producers and cast.

 What Kathryn Dennis Had To Say About Their Past 

 

Not too long after the Olivia and Thomas hook-up was revealed on the Southern Charm reunion, Kathryn took to Instagram to defend Olivia. She shared a carousel of photos of the two with the caption, &#34;We have never been closer, you did nothing wrong and don’t need to worry about being judged by me.&#34; It seems as though Olivia and Thomas&#39; past didn&#39;t affect Kathryn&#39;s friendship with Olivia. However, the same cant be said for Taylor and Olivia&#39;s friendship.
