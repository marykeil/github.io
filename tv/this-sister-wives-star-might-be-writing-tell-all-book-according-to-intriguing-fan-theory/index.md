## Literature Review
A new fan theory suggests that a shocking Sister Wives cast member is ready to talk about their deepest, darkest secrets in a Tell-All book soon.




Sister Wives fans are certain that Meri Brown is about to spill her guts about her plural marriage via a new Tell-All book. Sister Wives premiered in 2010 and season 1 showed Kody welcoming his fourth and, now, only wife, Robyn Brown, into his polygamist family. In 2010, Robyn became the first new wife of Kody&#39;s to enter his house in 16 years. Kody had already married Meri, Janelle Brown, and Christine Brown. However, only his marriage with Meri was legal while he had &#34;spiritually&#34; married the others. Kody divorced Meri so he could legally marry Robyn in 2014.




Meri had already started having marital problems but still stayed with Kody with hopes of reconciling, announced her split in January 2023. Now Sister Wives viewers such as Feeling_Army_863 and BrickHerder on Reddit suspect the New York Times bestselling author of Becoming Sister Wives is going to reveal the untold truth about her relationship with Kody in a book. One Redditor noticed that she said, &#34;My story will be told/heard,&#34; in next week&#39;s preview of the Sister Wives season 18 Tell-All, which suggests Meri might be writing a book. Meanwhile, another fan joked that Meri is entering her &#34;supervillain phase!&#34;

The Sister Wives viewer observed how Meri keeps making &#34;icily-delivered cryptic statements.&#34; They added, &#34;The whole town of Parowan is gonna be on lockdown!&#34; Other fans chimed in to say that they would readily pre-order the book. Someone mentioned how they never liked Meri before, but they are now rooting for her to be happy and hope she finds someone who treats her well. Kody married Meri in 1990. She was in a happy marriage with him and readily supported his decision to marry Janelle in 1993. The original pair&#39;s marriage was strained the most when Meri was catfished after having an online relationship with a woman pretending to be a man.





 

Meri became entangled in a six-month affair in March 2015, and it served as the tipping point in her already damaged marriage to Kody. Meri and Kody&#39;s relationship remained in limbo since then. Their marriage was sexless before she and Kody were publicly estranged. Kody claimed he faked being in love with Meri and had to put up with &#34;things&#34; because of their family. Meri and Kody tried going to couples&#39; therapy to help repair the marriage. It was of no use as Kody had already checked out of their relationship years earlier.

When Kody and Meri confirmed the end of their marriage after 32 years in a joint statement, they said that they tried saving it for 10 years in their own unique ways. Meri did have hopes of Kody returning to her, but in the end, she decided it was not fair for her to be alone like she had been for years. She knew it wasn&#39;t fair for Kody to feel like he had to keep up with a duty. While Meri appears to be enjoying her life as a single woman since the split, the Sister Wives patriarch had once said he would not be offended if Meri were to find another man or husband.






Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
