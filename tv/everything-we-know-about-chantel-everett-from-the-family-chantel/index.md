## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé alum Chantel Jimeno rose to fame on the show, and there is plenty to learn about The Family Chantel star&#39;s life.




Chantel Everett became known as the star of The Family Chantel, but there&#39;s plenty to know about the star as she rose to fame through 90 Day Fiancé. The Family Chantel season 5 is in full swing, with Pedro Jimeno and Chantel&#39;s divorce unraveling as the season continues. The reality TV sensation has now appeared in many seasons of extended 90 Day Fiancé franchise content, thanks to her marriage with Pedro Jimeno and their subsequent 2022 divorce, with the latest installment being 90 Day Fiancé: The Single Life. While Chantel shares a lot on camera, there is still more to learn about her life away from the show.




Though she first appeared on 90 Day Fiancé season 4, Chantel is best known for The Family Chantel. The series is one of the best reality TV show spinoffs and was conceived to focus on Chantel and Pedro&#39;s marriage, as it had been a dramatic topic on 90 Day Fiancé due to issues from both of their families. Due to Chantel&#39;s overbearing and meddling parents, Karen and Thomas Everett, Pedro had problems. Meanwhile, Chantel had issues with Pedro&#39;s spiteful mother, Lidia Morel, and his vindictive sister, Nicole Jimeno. Her younger siblings, Winter and Riverknight Everett, joined Chantel on the show. Her older brother, Royal Wylie, and his wife, Angenette Wylie, have also appeared.

Chantel began improving her Spanish language skills to communicate with him and his family, and they settled down in Georgia together.
