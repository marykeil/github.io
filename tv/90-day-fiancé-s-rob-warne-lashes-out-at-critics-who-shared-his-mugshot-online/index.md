## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Rob Warne claims he is not a criminal and reveals the truth behind his arrest when he was just 17 years old.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne is not happy with his mugshot being circulated online. The 32-year-old stars in 90 Day Fiancé season 10 with 23-year-old Sophie Sierra. Rob, who is from Inglewood, California, is an upcoming model and actor by profession, while Sophie is a social media content creator and fashion model. Sophie was the one who met Rob on Instagram after giving his page a follow. She was interested in dating mixed-race men thanks to Sophie&#39;s biracial background. She moved to the U.S. from London but was in for a surprise as they headed towards their wedding day.




Sophie found out that Rob was cheating on her using an app. While Sophie and Rob&#39;s future together remains a mystery to 90 Day Fiancé fans, an even bigger mystery is Rob&#39;s past. Rob recently took to Instagram to talk about his mugshot that was being shared across the Internet along with news of his arrest from when he was 17 years old.


 

Rob explained that he was in a car with his friend, who thought it would be &#34;funny to point a BB gun out of the window and shoot some little BBs at this apartment.&#34; Rob drove to the apartment and his car was recognized, which led to his arrest.

 Did Rob Warne Hide His Past Arrest From Sophie Sierra? 
          

He was taken to court and &#34;it came down to a misdemeanor.&#34; As per Rob, he never really did anything but someone decided to put his mugshot online to shame him. &#34;I guess I should put this &#39;statement&#39; out since if I don’t everyone seems to assume the worst about me,&#34; he wrote in his caption. Rob wrote that the &#34;real ones know what’s up,&#34; but his message was for everyone who started to believe all the negative hype about him. Rob thinks that people finding and spreading his mugshot online is &#34;wild.&#34; He mocked the people whom he thinks have &#34;A LOT&#34; of time on their hands and added that he is &#34;not a criminal&#34; and doesn&#39;t have &#34;any felonies.&#34;

Before Sophie found out Rob was cheating on her, she had an intuition about it. She dreamed that he was betraying her and happened to look at his phone to clear her doubts about the man she was marrying. Sophie came to know that Rob was receiving some disgusting videos from women. She immediately moved out of his apartment. Considering Rob had been keeping secrets from Sophie, it&#39;s likely he never told her about his arrest, thinking it was insignificant. Rob also used his post to say that he did not want kids immediately with Sophie but only after he moved into a better apartment.




Rob is supposedly living in Austin at the moment and claims that he does have a home with a bathroom now. He has been living there for a year. Their segments on 90 Day Fiancé were filmed over two years ago. Rob even had three consistent jobs while he was filming and wasn&#39;t unemployed, as has been speculated. Rob seems to have realized that fans have a lot of misconceptions about him, which is why he&#39;s been crowned a franchise villain. This is his attempt to bash all the rumors about him. However, it remains to be seen if he will be forgiven for his antics on the show.



90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
