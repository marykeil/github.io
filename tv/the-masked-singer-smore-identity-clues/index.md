 S’More’s Identity Is Revealed 

 

Jenny&#39;s guess of Ashley Parker Angel was right. He was a member of O-Town, the group that was formed on MTV&#39;s reality television series, Making the Band. The M on the television set referred to MTV. In addition, the O in O-Town stands for Orlando, which was represented by the oranges. The gator boots really were a nod to Florida. O-Town was the first group to be signed by Clive Davis to his record label, J Records, so he was the industry legend S&#39;More was referencing. O-Town was a huge success and appeared on TRL. They also had many concert tours in the United States and around the world.

The angel clue referred to Ashley&#39;s last name. The pizza clue referenced his appearance in the film, Pizza Man. In addition, Ashley has appeared on Broadway in Hairspray as Link Larkin and Wicked as Fiyero Tigelaar. The cauldron clue was a nod to Wicked, while the hairspray definitely referenced the musical of the same name. Ashley&#39;s son, Lyric Lennon Parker-Angel was born in 2005, which was the year on the tour bus when S&#39;More was talking about him. In 2011, Ashley decided not to be part of an O-Town reunion. The blue sunglasses referred to his song, &#34;Shades of Blue,&#34; from his 2006 solo album, Soundtrack to Your Life.




The fitness clues were a reference to Ashley&#39;s job as a celebrity fitness and lifestyle coach. He is the co-founder of High Level, a health and wellness company. Ashley has been involved with it for the past five years.

As The Masked Singer season 10 contestant S&#39;More, Ashley melted hearts with his soulful singing and smooth persona. It was very exciting to see him sing his hit single with O-Town, &#34;All or Nothing,&#34; when he was revealed. Everyone definitely wanted s&#39;more of S&#39;more, but it was his turn to be unmasked. Ashley will always be remembered on The Masked Singer for his sweet performances as S&#39;More.
