  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Masked Singer season 10&rsquo;s S&rsquo;More melted hearts with his incredible performances. Find out who he is and how the clues revealed his identity.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 featured 16 mystery celebrity contestants, and S&rsquo;More was revealed to be singer, actor, and former O-Town member, Ashley Parker Angel. The reality competition series welcomes back host Nick Cannon, along with panelists Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Ken Jeong, and Nicole Scherzinger. During The Masked Singer season 10 premiere, Anonymouse was revealed to be Demi Lovato, in one of the biggest unmaskings in the history of the show.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 Group A finals took place on Disco Night. As S&rsquo;More, Ashley competed against Gazelle and Cow, and was eliminated from the competition. He joins his fellow unmasked Group A contestants, including Anthony Anderson (Rubber Ducky), Tom Sandoval (Diver), and Michael Rapaport (Pickle). Cow sailed through to the season finale, while Gazelle was saved by the Ding Dong Keep It On Bell, and will join him. Here are the clues that proved that Ashley was hiding behind the S&rsquo;More mask.</p>

<p>S’More’s First Performance &amp; Clues</p>
<p>When S&rsquo;More first appeared on stage, Robin commented that he had youthful energy, with Jenny agreeing that he was confident. Nicole noticed that he was tall. For S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s performance, he sang a soulful rendition of Niall Horan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Slow Hands.&rdquo; In his clue package, S&rsquo;More appeared in the woods, saying, &ldquo;Gather round, campers, for the tale of the swashbuckling S&rsquo;More. Just like this many-layered dessert forged in fire, my life has been all about blazing my own trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More was then shown watching a rocket launch, stating, &ldquo;I started out on a rocket to fame, a journey from obscurity to major heartthrob status in a matter of weeks.&rdquo; Next, he was seen struggling to climb a snowy mountain, saying, &ldquo;Millions cheered me on step by step, as I became a household name.&rdquo; A frozen jar with a label that read, &ldquo;Tips&rdquo; was then shown. At the end of the scene, S&rsquo;More shouted, &ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; as the wind blew him back down the mountain.</p>
<p>Next, S&rsquo;More was seen on a sailing ship in the ocean. He continued, &ldquo;I traveled the lands near and far, making headlines with fellow adventurers and idols.&rdquo; He then appeared on a beach, during which a wind once again blew him away, along with a beach umbrella. The Masked Singer season 10 contestant went on to say, &ldquo;It was bliss,&rdquo; as the camera zoomed in on a picnic basket, a Chicago deep dish pizza, and two yellow and black cans of &ldquo;Masked Soda&rdquo; in the sand.</p>
<p>After that, S&rsquo;More stood next to a Christmas tree in the woods decorated with silver ornaments, saying, &ldquo;And when I finished with my travels, I hung up my cape.&rdquo; A gold ornament of an angel was then shown at the top of the Christmas tree. S&rsquo;More added, &ldquo;I thought it was the end of the road, but I was still hungry for a new journey. So that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here to conquer the Masked Singer stage. This S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s gonna make you melt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s performance, another clue was revealed to help figure out his identity. It was a shiny silver film reel that said, &ldquo;Starring S&rsquo;More.&rdquo; S&rsquo;More explained, &ldquo;As you can tell, I&rsquo;m very talented on and off stage.&rdquo; This lead to Nicole to theorize that S&rsquo;More might not only be a singer, but maybe an actor too.</p>

In his second clue package, he began by saying, &ldquo;Last week, I burst forth with bravado, and I&rsquo;m thrilled to have made it to NFL Night.&rdquo; S&rsquo;More then shared how he got started in show business, stating, &ldquo;I was born for the fearless life in the spotlight, but my father was afraid to lose his son to the fantastical world of fame.&rdquo; S&rsquo;More said this while he was on a theater stage. He was then shown standing in front of a bubbling cauldron.</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More went on to say, &ldquo;While I was still in high school, a huge opportunity to work with an industry legend came my way.&rdquo; A television set with an M on it was then shown. S&rsquo;More then looked at a picture of his father, an older S&rsquo;More, saying, &ldquo;But when my dad found out, he told me to turn down the gig. I made the hard decision to move out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More was next seen taking a bow on stage. He said, &ldquo;Years down the road, I conquered the Broadway stage, a lifelong goal.&rdquo; There was then a Masked Singer game console with a video game controller on the screen. S&rsquo;More shared, &ldquo;There was no way it could get any better, until one night after curtain call, I saw my dad backstage. Hearing him say he was proud of me was really the biggest win I could ask for. So dad, this one&rsquo;s for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s performance, he moonwalked on the stage, which he had done earlier while singing &ldquo;Moves Like Jagger.&rdquo; Then, NFL player DeSean Jackson brought out a clue.

He inserted Nicole and Ken&rsquo;s names into the song, as he moved to the panelists&rsquo; table to sing to them. He also added that he loved Robin and Jenny. Later in the episode, S&rsquo;More battled it out with Pickle in the Smackdown, during which they both sang, &ldquo;Sugar, We&rsquo;re Goin&rsquo; Down&rdquo; by Fall Out Boy. The panelists chose to save S&rsquo;More, so Pickle was eliminated, and revealed to be Michael Rapaport.</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More began his clue package by saying, &ldquo;Boy, you guys keep wanting s&rsquo;more of me, don&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m just so stoked to still be here on 2000s Night. My decade, baby!&rdquo; As S&rsquo;More walked out in front of a building that said, &ldquo;S&rsquo;Mores Cabin,&rdquo; he explained that the 2000s brought, &ldquo;Hanging out on the set of TRL, my music videos playing on MTV, and, most importantly, the birth of my child.&rdquo; S&rsquo;More was shown standing next to host Carson Daly, on the set of MTV&rsquo;s TRL and dancing in a music video with lights. When he mentioned his child, a pair of blue sunglasses were shown.</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More continued, &ldquo;Learning to be a dad while touring the world was intense.&rdquo; He was shown on a tour bus with a crying baby marshmallow. The bus had &ldquo;2005 Roasted&rdquo; printed on the side. S&rsquo;More went on to say, &ldquo;At a certain point, I realized that I wanted my kid to have a constant, supportive father-figure in their life.&rdquo; As S&rsquo;More warmed his hands by a campfire, a giant can of hairspray was shown. He said, &ldquo;So I took a step back from performing, so that I could stay in one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The baby marshmallow was then show giggling in a blue cradle that rocked. &ldquo;Rock-A-Bye Baby&rdquo; played in the background. S&rsquo;More concluded his clue package by saying, &ldquo;Now, being on stage again feels extra-special because they get to see me back in my element. I&rsquo;m so proud to be their dad, and I hope they&rsquo;re proud of me tonight.&rdquo;</p>

This has been unlike any other experience I&rsquo;ve had as a performer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More then lifted a 10-pound dumbbell saying, &ldquo;This costume is hot, and it&rsquo;s heavy.&rdquo; He was then shown riding an exercise bike as he said, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a hell of a lot of cardio. I&rsquo;ve been up until two or three in the morning practicing my choreography. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m back in boy band boot camp.&rdquo; S&rsquo;More then picked up and pointed to a pair of gator boots, which Robin thought might be a Florida reference. There was also a stuffed growling bear in the background of the cabin scene.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 finalist S&rsquo;More went on to say, &ldquo;But, me and the S&rsquo;More are now becoming one, and I&rsquo;m really starting to feel a different level of confidence in this competition.&rdquo; He added, &ldquo;Before I got here, the thought of returning to the stage felt scary. But hearing the panel&rsquo;s comments week after week has meant so much to me, and it&rsquo;s made me feel like I still belong on the stage. So tonight, I&rsquo;m bringing my A-game, and I&rsquo;m here to roast the competition. No pun intended, or pun intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>: The Masked Singer: Candelabra Identity Prediction &amp; Clues</p>
<p>S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s Identity Predictions From The Masked Singer Panelists</p>
<p>The Masked Singer season 10 panelists offered some interesting first guesses for S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s identity. Nicole commented that the first thing that popped out to her was &ldquo;step by step.&rdquo; She pointed out that they&rsquo;ve had members of boy bands such as *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, and 98 Degrees, and now they were due for a member of the New Kids on the Block, who have a hit song called &ldquo;Step By Step.&rdquo; Because of this, Nicole guessed that S&rsquo;More could be Joey McIntyre.</p>
<p>Jenny focused on S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s instant rise to fame, and guessed Justin Guarini, who was the runner-up to Kelly Clarkson American Idol season 1. S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s mustache and goatee reminded Robin of Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys. On NFL Night, the panelists continued to focus on boy bands from Florida because of the oranges clue. Nicole guessed JC Chasez from *NSYNC, who originated in Orlando. Robin stuck with his guess of Kevin because Kevin was on Broadway in Chicago. He also thought the game console could refer to the Backstreet Boys&rsquo; song, &ldquo;Quit Playing Games (With My Heart).&rdquo; However, Ken thought that S&rsquo;More could be actor Simu Liu.</p>
<p>During 2000s Night, Nicole guessed that S&rsquo;More might be New Kids on the Block member Jordan Knight because his brother, Jonathan, is also in the group. Nicole also used the hairspray clue to guess James Marsden, who appeared in the Hairspray movie. Ken then said that he believed that S&rsquo;More was Rob Thomas. However, Jenny stated that she knew her MTV and boy bands. She guessed that S&rsquo;More was Ashley Parker Angel from O-Town, who starred in Hairspray on Broadway.</p>
<p>On Disco Night, the Masked Singer panelists offered more guesses for S&rsquo;More&rsquo;s identity. Robin stuck with his original guess of Kevin Richardson, while Jenny continued to think that S&rsquo;More was Ashley Parker Angel. Nicole guessed that S&rsquo;More could be Jordan Knight. For their final guesses, the panelists offered several boy band members&rsquo; names. Robin continued to guess Kevin Richardson, while Ken thought he was A.J. McLean. Nicole continued to theorize that he was Jordan Knight. However, Jenny correctly guessed that S&rsquo;More was Ashley Parker Angel.</p>
<p>: The Masked Singer Season 10: Every Celebrity Reveal</p>
<p>S’More’s Identity Is Revealed</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s guess of Ashley Parker Angel was right. He was a member of O-Town, the group that was formed on MTV&rsquo;s reality television series, Making the Band. The M on the television set referred to MTV. In addition, the O in O-Town stands for Orlando, which was represented by the oranges. The gator boots really were a nod to Florida. O-Town was the first group to be signed by Clive Davis to his record label, J Records, so he was the industry legend S&rsquo;More was referencing. O-Town was a huge success and appeared on TRL. They also had many concert tours in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>The angel clue referred to Ashley&rsquo;s last name. The pizza clue referenced his appearance in the film, Pizza Man. In addition, Ashley has appeared on Broadway in Hairspray as Link Larkin and Wicked as Fiyero Tigelaar. The cauldron clue was a nod to Wicked, while the hairspray definitely referenced the musical of the same name. Ashley&rsquo;s son, Lyric Lennon Parker-Angel was born in 2005, which was the year on the tour bus when S&rsquo;More was talking about him. In 2011, Ashley decided not to be part of an O-Town reunion. The blue sunglasses referred to his song, &ldquo;Shades of Blue,&rdquo; from his 2006 solo album, Soundtrack to Your Life.</p>
<p>The fitness clues were a reference to Ashley&rsquo;s job as a celebrity fitness and lifestyle coach. He is the co-founder of High Level, a health and wellness company. Ashley has been involved with it for the past five years.</p>
<p>As The Masked Singer season 10 contestant S&rsquo;More, Ashley melted hearts with his soulful singing and smooth persona. It was very exciting to see him sing his hit single with O-Town, &ldquo;All or Nothing,&rdquo; when he was revealed. Everyone definitely wanted s&rsquo;more of S&rsquo;more, but it was his turn to be unmasked. Ashley will always be remembered on The Masked Singer for his sweet performances as S&rsquo;More.</p>
<p>The Masked Singer airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EDT on FOX.</p>
