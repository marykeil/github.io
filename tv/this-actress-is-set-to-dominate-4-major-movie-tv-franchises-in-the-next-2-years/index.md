 Which Of Isabela Merced&#39;s Upcoming Projects Is Most Exciting? 
          




Although Madame Web will be interesting, Merced has a secondary role in the movie. In Alien: Romulus, on the other hand, she will play the lead role and there&#39;s a great deal of excitement about Ezequiel Alvarez directing the film. As for the 2025 projects, Hawkgirl is likely a smaller role than the pivotal TV character Dina in The Last of Us. All that said, her roles in Alien&#39;s next installment and in HBO&#39;s major hit are the most exciting of Isabela Merced&#39;s upcoming projects.
