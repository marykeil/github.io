## Literature Review

Though Peaky Blinders is over, the franchise has not finished entirely, and as of now, there are three Peaky Blinders spinoffs in development.




Despite the fact that Netflix&#39;s Peaky Blinders premiered its final season in 2022, the historical crime series is not completely over with, as its showrunners have begun working on three different spinoff projects surrounding the Peaky Blinders universe. Peaky Blinders is a period crime drama that first came out in 2013 and had a total of six seasons. The series follows Tommy Shelby, the leader of the Birmingham street gang, the Peaky Blinders, from the 1910s through the 1930s. Over the seasons, Shelby attempts to expand his criminal enterprise while also keeping his loved ones safe.
Although Peaky Blinders had a solid run of nearly ten years, showrunners and fans alike clearly are not ready to let the show go. This is proven by the fact that there are currently three Peaky Blinders spinoff projects that have been announced to be happening. These projects are all unique in their own right, acting as spinoffs, sequels, and prequels. Overall, this is an exciting and unusual place for a television show to be in. Though spinoffs are popular topics of conversations, it isn&#39;t often that a series gets new projects so quickly or in such abundance.









 








 3  The Peaky Blinders Movie 


 







The very first Peaky Blinders project to be announced after the conclusion of the television series was a Peaky Blinders movie. Long-teased by Peaky Blinders creator and writer, Steven Knight, the Peaky Blinders movie is allegedly going to be a stand-in for Peaky Blinders season 7. This means that the film will wrap up the loose ties that the show&#39;s finale left, including what happens to Tommy Shelby: does he really ride off into the sunset, content with everyone believing him to be dead or does he pull off one final scheme of revenge against his enemies?
At this point, the Peaky Blinders movie is not just a long-discussed dream, but is close to being a reality. Steven Knight recently announced that he is nearly finished with the movie&#39;s script, and also, that he hopes to begin filming in mid-2024. This would mean that audiences could see the Peaky Blinders movie as early as 2025. But then again, there are still some major kinks to be smoothed out, including whether Cillian Murphy is on board with the film. Either way, the Peaky Blinders movie is the first of many exciting projects for the new franchise.
When asked about the Peaky Blinders movie, Cillian Murphy has said that he is not yet attached to the film, but would be happy to come back if the story is good enough.







 2  Peaky Blinders&#39; Boston Spinoff Show 
        

Following Steven Knight&#39;s Peaky Blinders feature film announcement, Netflix revealed that it was developing two Peaky Blinders spinoff series, the first of which is the Peaky Blinders Boston spinoff. Apparently, this series is going to take place several decades after the events of Peaky Blinders, and also, is located in Boston, Massachusetts. At this time, there have not been many concrete details released about this show besides its location and time period, but that does not make it any less exciting. In fact, its mystery allows audiences to make guesses as to how this show and Peaky Blinders will connect.
There are two big routes that the Peaky Blinders Boston spinoff could go on. First, it could be that the series will star a character from Peaky Blinders that immigrated to Boston, or similarly, the descendants of a Peaky Blinders character that is now located in Boston. On the other hand, the series could follow entirely new characters that simply have a similar ambiance to the Peaky Blinders crew. Either way, it seems likely that this new Peaky Blinders spinoff will be inspired by both Peaky Blinders and the real Irish-American gangs present in Boston history.





 1  Peaky Blinders&#39; Polly Prequel Show 
        

The final Peaky Blinders spinoff that is in the works is a series following Peaky Blinders&#39; Polly. Although Polly saw her end in Peaky Blinders season 6, this series will have a chance to explore Polly&#39;s origins and the backstory that Peaky Blinders never had the chance to explore. There is no confirmation yet on when Polly&#39;s Peaky Blinders spinoff will be set or what it will be about, but there are definitely some theories. Mainly, it seems most likely that the show will delve into Polly&#39;s youth and her rise in the criminal scene.
Of the Peaky Blinders cast, Polly&#39;s story will be most interesting to look at because of her age and gender. Although societal expectations were rapidly changing throughout Peaky Blinders, in Polly&#39;s youth, that was a lot less true. Therefore, it would be interesting to see how she gained her power, influence, and skill in a time when women were not considered to have any of those things. In the end, the Peaky Blinders Polly spinoff will not only offer much needed Polly context, but it will also be an exciting peek into a restrictive time in womens&#39; history.
