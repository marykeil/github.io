## Literature Review
Thomas &amp; Friends and George Carlin are two very different entities, but Thomas the Tank Engine YouTube edits take advantage of Carlin&#39;s filthy jokes.




George Carlin, a name synonymous with groundbreaking comedy, left an indelible mark on the world of stand-up with his incisive wit and bold social commentary, which has been hilariously edited into Thomas the Tank Engine. Renowned for his &#34;Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television&#34; routine, Carlin&#39;s influence extended far beyond the boundaries of adult humor. His journey through the entertainment industry saw him evolve from a clean-cut comedian to a counterculture icon, with a career spanning over five decades. Carlin&#39;s unique ability to blend humor with sharp observations on life and society earned him a place among the most revered comedians of all time.




Thomas the Tank Engine, on the other hand, represents a starkly different cultural phenomenon. Originating from the Railway Series books by Reverend W. Awdry, this beloved childrenâ€™s series found its fame through its television adaptation, Thomas &amp; Friends. The show, featuring anthropomorphized locomotives on the fictional Island of Sodor, has charmed children worldwide since its debut in 1984. Its educational content, coupled with engaging storylines and endearing characters, has made it a staple in children&#39;s programming, and a Thomas &amp; Friends movie is in development. However, the world of George Carlin and Thomas the Tank Engine collided in a hilariously fascinating way on YouTube.
