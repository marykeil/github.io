## Literature Review
Many anime characters, heroes and villains alike, are based on the concept of the Seven Deadly Sins, which imbeds them with unique dynamics.




The best anime versions of the seven deadly sins all have their own unique spin on the iconic piece of Christian lore that has become ubiquitously popular in popular media. The sins are meant to embody the seven worst qualities in humanity that drive them to mistreat themselves or others. In no particular order, they are greed, lust, wrath, sloth, envy, pride, and gluttony.
Most often, characters who embody each sin exemplify it themselves rather than inspire it in others. If they are the heroes, this will either not be taken very seriously or used as a tragic backstory or flaw they have to overcome. Usually, though, they are villains who revel in the chaos and pain they cause.









 








 10  Servamps Need Humans To Unlock Their Power 
Servamp
        

Some of the best vampires in anime happen to be inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins. The seven Servamps, from lazy Kuro to capricious Lawless, all have various supernatural abilities at their disposal. But there&#39;s a catch: they are only as strong as the will of their Eve, the human they must make a blood contract with to unlock their true power.
Certain sects of Christianity also acknowledge an eighth deadly sin, Despair: defined as melancholy so deep it rejects the possibility of divine forgiveness. This coincides with the existence of the eighth Servamp, Tsubaki. Tsubaki is the youngest Servamp and has a serious bone to pick with his big brothers and sisters; the story is bound to get much darker when he&#39;s around.

 9  The Varia Are Viciously Strong Assassins 
Katekyo Hitman Reborn!
        

The Vongola Family are an organization of deadly mafiosos and assassins, but none are more powerful than the Varia. Though they are technically part of the Family, they are a separate squad of killers who only take jobs they&#39;re interested in. They are not just some of Tsuna’s strongest adversaries, they directly reflect the virtues Tsuna and his friends exemplify.
The seven deadly sins are traditionally associated with seven specific demons, which the Varia are named for. Some are one-to-one matches, such as Leviathan, Mammon, and Belphegor, and others are more vague, such as Gola Mosca, whose name derives from gula, the Latin name for Gluttony. As usual, their powers and personalities reflect each sin.

 8  Fate&#39;s Weapon Is One Of Seven Ancient Relics 
Berserk Of Gluttony


 







As of now, no second season for Berserk of Gluttony has been confirmed. 

In a world where the skill you&#39;re born with determines your life&#39;s path, Fate Graphite believes he was born cursed. His skill is Gluttony, which just causes him perpetual aching hunger. But when he accidentally ends up with the dark weapon Greed, he discovers how to use his Gluttony skill to become a fearsome warrior.
Greed and his multiple stages of evolution rank him easily among the most powerful swords in anime. On his journey to become stronger and right the wrongs of his world, Fate meets other fighters with dark weapons like Greed. Some are friendly, like Myne and Sloth, and others are malicious, like Envy, who possesses people to cause trouble.

 7  The Witches Of Sin Are The Roots Of All Magic 
Re:Zero
        

From the very first beginning, just mentioning the name Satella was enough to instantly get Subaru on people&#39;s bad side. The Witches of Sin are considered bad news. Though new information about them comes to light the closer Subaru and company get to them, the tales of their devastating powers are all too true.
All of these witches are force-of-nature strong, inheriting their powers by killing and absorbing the “witch factor” of the previous holder. With this power, they were capable of causing great trouble for the kingdom, from Typhon&#39;s exacting and deadly judgment of others to Minerva sapping the world&#39;s energy to fuel her power. Unusually, there are not seven Witches of Sin but nine, the extra two being Pandora, representing Vainglory, and Hector, representing Despair.

 6  The Seven Deadly Sins Are Just Misunderstood 
The Seven Deadly Sins


 







While many characters are named after the seven deadly sins, this is the only anime where both the show and group bear the name. When her kingdom is conquered by Holy Knights, Princess Elizabeth goes looking for help from the only criminals strong enough to fight back: the Seven Deadly Sins. Infamous for apparently attempting a coup against Elizabeth&#39;s father, she soon discovers there&#39;s more to them than everyone says.
Because the &#34;sinful&#34; characters are the heroes, it isn&#39;t hard to predict that their vices are not inherent parts of them or things that they enjoy. Many of them were framed for crimes surrounding each sin, or had good reasons for causing the destruction they did, leading to them being unfairly branded as monsters by a corrupt kingdom. Banding together helps them move past their backgrounds.

 5  The Seven Great Digimon Lords Are Consistently Tough 
Digimon
        

Across the Digimon series, this group of seven strong and menacing Digimon will show up as major obstacles for the heroes and their partners. Because they detest each other just as much as they do the heroes, they aren&#39;t a cohesive group and will often fight among themselves. Their powers make them a force to be reckoned with together or alone.
These Digimon are also directly named after the most evil of demons to show they mean business, with Lucemon, Beelzemon and Lilithmon being a few examples. Some of them ascend to be the main villains of the series they appear in, such as Lucemon and Daemon, much like the rebellious fallen angels they’re named for. Others are simply tough opponents that don’t heavily affect the plot, such as Belphemon, who would rather sleep than fight.

 4  Deadly Sins Can Be Acquired As Skills 
So I&#39;m A Spider, So What?


The fantasy world that Kumoko and their classmates are reincarnated into, like many isekai settings, operates much like a video game. Warriors and mages can grow strong enough to unlock skills based upon the seven deadly sins. Of course, they might also just get lucky and come into the world with an innate affinity for the powerful skill.
However, overusing one or even more of the Sin skills can backfire horribly. Unlocking the skill in the first place requires one to be fully immersed in the vice for a very long time, to the point where the user has already been deeply hurt by it. Unleashing the power runs the risk of irreparably warping their soul.

 3  Sins Are This Kingdom&#39;s Ultimate Power 
That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime
        

Similar to So I&#39;m A Spider, So What?, the fantasy world that Rimuru Tempest is reincarnated into contains unlockable skills. A series of ultimate skills are based on the seven deadly sins and named for their corresponding demons. Those who unlock them are known as Demon Lords, some of That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime&#39;s most powerful characters.
Warriors can also unlock ultimate skills based upon the Seven Heavenly Virtues that contrast each deadly sin: charity, chastity, diligence, humility, kindness, patience, and temperance. These skills are named after famous archangels, who do not represent them in Christianity. Though powerful, all fourteen of these skills come with hidden catches.

 2  The Book Of Eibon Requires Readers To Overcome Sin 
Soul Eater
        

This arc is manga-only, and a big reason why fans insist that Soul Eater is one of the classic anime that deserve a reboot. When Death the Kid is kidnapped by Noah, the avatar of the Book of Eibon, his friends must enter the book themselves to rescue him. Each chapter of the book requires the team to overcome one of the seven deadly sins.
Though Noah has seven incarnations for each sin, it&#39;s the meister and weapon teams that get the most focus. Some chapters are more memorable than others, with Excalibur&#39;s appearance inciting everyone&#39;s Wrath and Black Star fighting a corrupted Kid in the Pride chapter. And shippers everywhere lost it over the Lust chapter, in which every character is genderbent into the kind of person they find most attractive.

 1  The Homunculi Embody Their Father’s Sins 
Fullmetal Alchemist


 







The identities of the Homunculi differ between the 2003 anime and the original manga/Brotherhood. 

Probably the most famous characterizations of the seven deadly sins in anime, the Homunculi are also among the most literal. They were created through Father&#39;s attempts to perfect himself by physically removing his worst traits: becoming their God, essentially. All of them, sans Greed (who, naturally, wants more out of life) are his loyal warriors, doing his dirty work in Amestris and beyond.
Some only represent their sins on a surface level, such as Gluttony and Lust; the former eats everything he possibly can and the latter, while beautiful, isn&#39;t attracted to anyone herself. Others feel them to the very core of their being, such as Envy. Though they pretend not to care, Envy is jealous of humans&#39; ability to connect with each other, so deeply that it&#39;s the end of them when Ed figures it out.
