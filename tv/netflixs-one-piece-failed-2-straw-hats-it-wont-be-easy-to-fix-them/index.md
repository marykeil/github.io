## Literature Review
One Piece was a huge success, but two of the Straw Hat Pirates weren&#39;t as developed as the rest. Season 2 can fix things, but it won’t be easy.





Summary

  One Piece season 2 needs to give Usopp and Sanji more to do after season 1 failed their characters.   The show could take liberties with the source material to give Usopp and Sanji more development and potential.   Netflix can strengthen Usopp and Sanji&#39;s characterizations compared to season 1 through well-timed flashbacks and exploring their internal struggles.  







Netflix&#39;s One Piece did exceptionally well due to the depiction of the beloved anime, pacing, and acting performances, but it still failed two of the series&#39; most popular Straw Hat Pirates. With One Piece season 2 in the works, Netflix may address season 1&#39;s greatest flaw when it comes to character development. Whereas most live-action anime adaptations aren&#39;t particularly good, One Piece excels in remaining as faithful to its source material as possible. It had innovative ways to retell the classic anime&#39;s story by playing with the source material&#39;s timeline and avoiding the typical tropes that negatively impact live-action anime adaptations.

While there&#39;s no official word regarding when Netflix plans to release One Piece season 2, the creators responsible for its acclaimed first season have plenty of time to further develop the protagonists and the antagonists. Among the many things that make One Piece&#39;s anime and manga versions so popular among anime aficionados is the dynamics between the series&#39; uniquely drawn and complexly written characters. While the live-action adaptation only had eight episodes to get the ball moving, One Piece does a fairly exceptional job recreating the source material&#39;s dynamics. However, there are still two Straw Hat Pirates who could benefit from stronger characterizations in One Piece season 2.




                  Netflix’s One Piece Season 1 Already Set Up Luffy &amp; Usopp’s Most Controversial Scene   Netflix’s One Piece season 1 subtly set up one of the biggest moments from the Water Seven arc and set the stage for Luffy and Usopp’s divisive scene.    


 Usopp &amp; Sanji Weren’t Given Much To Do In One Piece Season 1 
Usopp and Sanji&#39;s characterizations were weaker than the rest of the crew&#39;s.
          

Although Netflix&#39;s live-action adaptation of One Piece handles Luffy, Zoro, and Nami exceptionally well, the show leaves much to be desired regarding the Straw Hat Pirates&#39; sniper and chef, Usopp and Sanji. The show captures Luffy&#39;s perpetual optimism, Zoro&#39;s commitment to his role as a swordsman, and the complexity of Nami&#39;s aloof attitude, but it doesn&#39;t give Usopp or Sanji similar treatment. One Piece succeeds in depicting Ussop&#39;s cowardice and Sanji&#39;s charisma, but it merely scratches the surface regarding both characters&#39; wants and needs. As a result, Usopp is depicted as nothing more than a coward for the most part, and Sanji barely interacts with the crew.





 

In the source material, Usopp is the leader of Usopp&#39;s Pirates, and in it, he asserts to his friends/crewmates Ninjin, Piiman, and Tamanegi that his dream is to conquer his cowardice and become the bravest pirate who ever lived. In Sanji&#39;s case, he&#39;s the son of a royal yet ruthless family known as the Vinsmoke family, and he distances himself from them because of their cruel ways. Neither of these aspects of their lives are depicted, thus leaving Usopp and Sanji with little to do in season 1. While these elements of their backstories may be addressed in season 2, that still complicates things for both characters.



 Usopp &amp; Sanji Do Not Have Major Arcs In The Arabasta Saga 
One Piece season 2 may have to take liberties with the source material
          




Since Usopp and Sanji don&#39;t undergo any significant character development in the Arabasta Saga, which is what One Piece season 2, will likely cover. It&#39;s doubtful that either Usopp or Sanji&#39;s live-action counterparts will fare much better in season 2 than they did in season 1 if the show adapts things faithfully. However, the show could take liberties with the source material via an earlier time skip in season 2, thus resulting in Usopp and Sanji reaching more of their potential much sooner. However, that presents another issue, since the timeskip also sees the Straw Hat Pirates&#39; strength increase significantly, which would speed things up too quickly.

Netflix&#39;s best bet to strengthen Usopp and Sanji&#39;s characterizations is to display more of their internal struggles via well-timed flashbacks in place of them loudly proclaiming things about their past in brief scenes. Since Usopp&#39;s cowardice is often the source of many of his struggles, the second season can depict this more via flashbacks to the &#34;Usopp pirates&#34;, thus giving audiences a greater sense of what he needs to work on. Sanji&#39;s checkered past with his family should be mentioned more frequently, as well as Sanji&#39;s refusal to subscribe to their beliefs, thus making him a much more well-rounded and engaging character.






 How One Piece Season 2 Can Fix The Live-Action’s Sanji &amp; Usopp Mistake 
Netflix needs to beef up Usopp and Sanji&#39;s roles
         

With Tony Tony Chopper and Nico Robin set to appear in One Piece Season 2, plus RoNetflix will have an even tougher time fleshing out Usopp and Sanji. However, One Piece can handle this by showing Usopp&#39;s falling out with Luffy as a result of his insecurities regarding his spineless nature. Since Usopp&#39;s dream is to become brave, showing him to fight someone he has no chance of winning is one of the strongest ways to convey that to audiences. Additionally, Usopp apologizing to Luffy and rejoining the Straw Hat Pirates after losing his fight with Luffy perfectly shows the aptitude Usopp has for becoming a brave pirate if he can apply himself in the right ways.

One Piece can introduce the Vinsmoke family early before gradually making them a more prominent threat for Sanji and the Straw Hat Pirates to combat. Showing Sanji&#39;s closeness with Zeff is great because it explains why he&#39;s so committed to his culinary duties, but with Sanji&#39;s late appearance, that&#39;s all viewers get from him. One Piece season 2 can focus more on his rocky relationship with his family, thus providing Sanji with more depth and audiences with more reasons to root for him. While One Piece&#39;s first season did well, season 2 can do even better by giving Usopp and Sanji more screen time and highlighting their pasts.
