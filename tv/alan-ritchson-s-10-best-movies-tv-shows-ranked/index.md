 10  The Turkey Bowl (2019) 
Ronnie Best
        

Given Ritchson&#39;s popularity in the football series Blue Mountain State, he was the perfect candidate to star in the sports/comedy The Turkey Bowl. The movie is centered around a 30-something-year-old brought back to his hometown by his high-school friends to partake in a long-awaited Thanksgiving Turkey Bowl game. Despite its low budget, the 64-minute movie can make for an entertaining watch. Ritchson himself brings his typical charm and humor.






 9  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) 
Raphael
        

 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) 

 Release Date   August 8, 2014    Director   Jonathan Liebesman    Cast   Megan Fox , Will Arnett , Jeremy Howard , Johnny Knoxville , Alan Ritchson , Noel Fisher , Tony Shalhoub , Tohoru Masamune , Minae Noji    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   101 Minutes    




While not as good as the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, the 2014 live-action/3D animation mix and its sequel make for entertaining action movies. Alan Ritchson voices Ninja Turtle Raphael, where he isn&#39;t given much to work with besides being a fighter. The Michael Bay-produced iteration of the franchise is fun for mindless sci-fi/superhero action but doesn&#39;t offer much in terms of Ritchson&#39;s performing abilities.






 8  Fast X (2023) 
Aimes


 







 Fast X 

 Release Date   May 19, 2023    Director   Louis Leterrier    Cast   Vin Diesel , Michelle Rodriguez , Jason Statham , Jordana Brewster , Tyrese Gibson , Ludacris , Charlize Theron , Nathalie Emmanuel , John Cena , Sung Kang , Helen Mirren , Brie Larson , Scott Eastwood , Jason Momoa    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   141 Minutes    




Fast X is in the middle of the pack of the best Fast and Furious movies, but it&#39;s still a massive blockbuster with a decently prominent Alan Ritchson role. By the tenth installment, the series boasts a huge ensemble cast, making it hard for any one actor to stand out. Yet, Ritchson manages to create a memorable impression as one of the franchise&#39;s more complex characters. Alan Ritchson is utilized perfectly, and it&#39;ll be exciting to see where the character goes in Fast X: Part 2.





 7  Titans (2018-2023) 
Hawk


 







 Titans 

 Release Date   October 12, 2018    Cast   Brenton Thwaites , Chelsea Zhang , Curran Walters , Alan Ritchson , Anna Diop , Lindsey Gort , Minka Kelly , Esai Morales , Ryan Potter , Teagan Croft , Joshua Orpin , Seamus Dever    Genres   Drama , Action , Adventure , Superhero    Seasons   3    




Alan Ritchson returned to the DC Universe to play his second comic book superhero, Hawk, in Titans. The series was initially developed for DC&#39;s own streaming service before merging onto HBO Max for its final two seasons, and is centered around a more mature version of the Teen Titans. While the show often suffers from cheesy writing, it undoubtedly excels in its casting, with Ritchson&#39;s performance being a standout in the early seasons. He&#39;s a recurring hero in an ensemble, and his macho demeanor makes for some of the show&#39;s best levity.

 6  Blood Drive (2017) 
Arthur Bailey
        

Before Reacher, Alan Ritchson was the lead on another TV series, playing the role of Arthur Bailey in the sci-fi action series Blood Drive. The series is set in a dystopian future where a ravine has split the United States in half. Ritchson plays an LA police officer who partners up with a dangerous woman for a deadly road race across the country in order to survive. It&#39;s a bizarre premise, but Blood Drive is highly entertaining and offers some of the best work Ritchson is capable of.





 5  Black Mirror (2011-) 
Paul
        

 Black Mirror 

 Release Date   December 4, 2011    Cast   Bryce Dallas Howard , Hayley Atwell , Anthony Mackie    Genres   Anthology , Drama , Science Fiction , Thriller    Seasons   5    




Netflix&#39;s Black Mirror is one of the streaming service&#39;s biggest and most popular series. It&#39;s an anthology, meaning every episode has a different cast and one-off eerie, dystopian premise. Alan Ritchson only appears in the season 3 episode &#34;Nosedive,&#34; and fans of the actor can skip directly to the episode to just watch his work. Ritchson plays a supporting role behind Bryce Dallas Howard in an episode that hypothesizes the idea of a numeric social status for people. &#34;Nosedive&#34; is one of the best Black Mirror episodes.





 4  Smallville (2001-2011) 
Aquaman


 







 Smallville 

 Release Date   October 16, 2001    Cast   Sam Jones III , Annette O&#39;Toole , Jensen Ackles , Eric Johnson , Erica Durance , Cassidy Freeman , Michael Rosenbaum , Laura Vandervoort , John Schneider , Kristin Kreuk , Sam Witwer , Aaron Ashmore , Allison Mack , John Glover , Justin Hartley , Tom Welling , Callum Blue    Genres   Romance , Adventure , Drama    Seasons   10    




Alan Ritchson only has a small recurring role in Smallville, but he&#39;s memorable as the show&#39;s version of Aquaman. Smallville is centered around Superman as a teenager growing up in rural Kansas, mixing the difficulties of teenage life with super-powered adventures. It&#39;s one of the defining WB shows of the 2000s, and as seasons developed, they began to introduce more and more of DC&#39;s most famous heroes. Ritchson even participated in the show&#39;s Justice League episode, along with Smallville&#39;s versions of Cyborg, The Flash, and Green Arrow. Ritchson&#39;s Aquaman isn&#39;t introduced until season 5, and he&#39;s only in four episodes, but it&#39;s still a classic DC series.





 3  Catching Fire (2013) 
Gloss
        

 The Hunger Games: Catching Fire 

 Release Date   November 1, 2013    Director   Francis Lawrence    Cast   Jennifer Lawrence , Josh Hutcherson , Sam Claflin    Rating   PG-13    Runtime   2h 26m    




Alan Ritchson plays another small yet memorable role in the Hunger Games franchise. In Catching Fire, he plays the hulking antagonist Gloss, a Career Tribute from District 1 who was previously the victor of the 63rd Hunger Games. He&#39;s not the most expressive character, but Alan Ritchson adds a physical intimidation that marks Gloss as a notable threat in the arena. Despite being a minor role, Catching Fire is the best Hunger Games movie and a big step toward blockbuster projects in Ritchson&#39;s career.





 2  Blue Mountain State (2010-2011) 
Thad Castle
        

The sitcom Blue Mountain State is one of the best football shows available, known for its highly raunchy college humor. It&#39;s an over-the-top, immature series, but Alan Ritchson excels at the goofy humor. He plays the ridiculously hilarious linebacker, Thad Castle, one of the team&#39;s leaders and biggest bullies. After three seasons of the TV series, a Kickstarter was launched to raise funds for a sequel movie, Blue Mountain State: The Rise of Thadlad, centered around a celebration for Thad being drafted into the NFL.

The Amazon Prime Video series has had unprecedented success, with Alan Ritchson&#39;s star power as its centerpiece. The thriller series complements its action sequences with fantastic writing and character development. While Tom Cruise played Jack Reacher in two films, Ritchson has been praised for improving the role in a more direct adaptation in Reacher. Alan Ritchson is the perfect fit for the highly successful series, and it&#39;s the best option for fans of the actor.
