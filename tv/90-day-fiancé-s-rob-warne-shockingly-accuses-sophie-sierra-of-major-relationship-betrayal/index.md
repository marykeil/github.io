## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé season 10 star Rob Warne is shocked after finding out how Sophie Sierra had been betraying his trust throughout their relationship.




90 Day Fiancé star Rob Warne claimed Sophie Sierra shockingly betrayed him during their relationship. Rob is a 32-year-old actor and model from Los Angeles who currently stars in 90 Day Fiancé season 10. Rob and Sophie, 23, met on Instagram after she followed his page. The London-based social media influencer Sophie developed a close connection with Rob, though things did get shaky when they had to spend a few months apart during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sophie suggested she could move to the U.S. on a K-1 visa so they could get married. Sophie and Rob came from different backgrounds but saw a future together.




However, Rob was not being loyal to Sophie, which made her resort to the wildest methods to be able to keep an eye on him. Rob took to the social media platform Threads to vent when he found out Sophie had been tracking his location. Rob wrote, &#34;I deada** just found out that sophiesierra98 tracked my location our whole relationship! man WHAT!!?&#34; Rob received replies from fans telling him what Sophie did was &#34;messy as h***.&#34; However, someone else asked Rob why he was surprised considering how he&#39;d treated Sophie throughout their relationship. Sophie could have kept it a secret but decided to tell the cameras about her tracking him in episode 8.

 Rob Warne &amp; Sophie Sierra&#39;s 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          

Rob cheated on Sophie while they were on a break during the pandemic. He had received a message from an unknown woman on Instagram, and he entertained their request for naughty videos. Sophie found out about it only after the person decided to message her about Rob&#39;s behavior. Sophie was cautious even though she agreed to give their relationship another chance. Rob insisted it was a one-time thing and that what he did wasn&#39;t cheating, but Sophie had to take measures so he wouldn&#39;t do it again. Rob had once shared his phone location with Sophie so she was able to track him without him knowing.





 

After Sophie moved to the U.S., he found Rob interacting with an Instagram page that was posting X-rated content. The 90 Day Fiancé star later dreamed that Rob was cheating on her. Sophie went through Rob&#39;s phone to find an app where he had been receiving inappropriate messages from random women. Sophie decided to leave Rob then and there. She found a different apartment and shifted right away. Rob kept telling Sophie he hadn&#39;t cheated on her. She eventually decided to forgive him because, according to her, him cheating online did not qualify as actual cheating.

Sophie told her mom that she had proof Rob had never cheated on her with a different woman because she kept tracking his location. Sophie&#39;s plan wasn&#39;t foolproof, but she was satisfied with it. Sophie&#39;s mother wasn&#39;t happy that she decided to stay with Rob. However, the show was filmed two years ago and things have seemingly changed now. There are suspicions that Sophie and Rob, who have now moved to Austin, Texas, have separated and didn&#39;t really get a happily ever after in their storyline.






90 Day Fiancé airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
