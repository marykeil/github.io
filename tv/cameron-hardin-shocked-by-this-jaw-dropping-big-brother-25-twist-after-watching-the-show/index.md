## Literature Review
Big Brother 25&#39;s Cameron Hardin reveals the moments that shocked him the most after watching the show, and which houseguests he keeps in touch with.




Big Brother 25 houseguest Cameron Hardin revealed the moments that shocked him the most after watching the show back, and which of his fellow contestants he&#39;s still friends with. On finale night, Cameron, a 34-year-old stay-at-home dad from Eastman, Georgia, was voted America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest after his incredible run on the show. Cameron was a competition beast who often found himself targeted by his own alliances because they saw him as such a threat. He even earned his way back into the house after being unanimously evicted.




In an interview with Big Brother 25 host Julie Chen Moonves on her God 101 podcast, Cameron shared that &#34;it was shocking&#34; to watch his interactions with secret mother and son duo Cirie Fields and Jared Fields.


 

Cameron saw how &#34;lost&#34; he was when talking to them, and thought &#34;Oh my God! You gave so much information right there. How did you not see this?&#34; However, Cameron added, &#34;I&#39;m only human. There&#39;s no way that I probably could have been keen to that from the very beginning, from the jump. So the fact that I navigated it as well as I did, I was like, &#39;Wow! At least I got out of there alive.&#39;&#34;

 Cameron Reveals Which Big Brother 25 Houseguests He Keeps In Touch With 
          




Cameron also revealed that he  &#34;often&#34; talks to a lot of his fellow Big Brother 25 houseguests. He keeps in touch &#34;with the majority of them.&#34; As far as lifelong friendships, Cameron shared that he talks to Red Utley every day. He added that if he&#39;s not talking to Red, he&#39;s talking to Blue Kim. Cameron also maintains his friendships with Jag Bains and Bowie Jane. Cameron said that the Big Brother 25 houseguests have a group chat together, and they also FaceTime with each other. He concluded by saying, &#34;I try to keep in touch with everyone as much as I can.&#34;

Cameron was one of many Big Brother 25 houseguests who was shocked by Cirie and Jared&#39;s secret relationship. One of the most heartbreaking moments of the season was during week 6 when Cameron was the Head of Household, and he came up with a plan to backdoor Cirie. As a superfan, Cameron played very strategically. He convinced the whole house that he was nominating Blue and Jag, but then floored everyone by instead putting up Cirie&#39;s allies, Izzy Gleicher and Felicia Cannon. When Jared won the Power of Veto, Cameron thought that he could put his plan in motion to evict Cirie. What he didn&#39;t know was that he&#39;d just revealed his whole scheme to her son.




It&#39;s nice to hear that the Big Brother 25 houseguests keep in touch with each other. Cameron and Red were close friends and had a Final 2 alliance called The Chillers until Jared convinced Red that Cameron had betrayed him. However, after the game, Cameron and Red reconciled. Hopefully, Cameron and Red will work together again in the future, possibly on The Amazing Race or one of The Challenge shows. Whatever happens next, Cameron established himself as a new Big Brother legend and America&#39;s Favorite Houseguest.
