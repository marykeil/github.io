## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean season 8&#39;s fan favorite Deckhand Haleigh Gorman may be beloved by viewers. Why isn&#39;t she more heavil featured on the show?




Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 may have introduced a new fan favorite to the cast, but many are wondering why Deckhand Haleigh Gorman doesn&#39;t get as much screen time as some of her fellow yachties. Throughout the Below Deck franchise, there are always yachties who viewers get attached to, even if they&#39;re not a massive part of the season&#39;s story. While many Below Deck Med viewers are focused on Captain Sandy Yawn along with controversial Stewardess Natalya Scudder, others have noticed Haleigh in the background of the episodes, delivering one-liners and being generally entertaining. Though she may not be the focal point of the season, she&#39;s certainly made an impression.




Many are wondering why, despite being an entertaining part of the season, Haleigh isn&#39;t being promoted or shown much in episodes of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8. Reddit user u/nonequilibriumphys asked, &#34;From what I have seen of her (which isn&#39;t enough in my opinion), Haleigh is hilarious and lovely...why is she not in any story lines?&#34; While there isn&#39;t a concrete answer about why Haleigh hasn&#39;t been featured on the series, some other users chimed in to provide their takes. u/FavaBeens explained, &#34;I guess she’s not causing any drama, just doing her job and being a little silly.&#34;


 Haleigh Gorman’s Below Deck Med Storyline Explained 
          

While Haleigh hasn&#39;t been a huge feature on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, many have been following along with her journey as she acclimates to a superyacht. Haleigh has 10 years worth of yachting experience, but has only ever worked on smaller vessels, so she&#39;s adjusting to a larger superyacht during her time on Below Deck Med. As Reddit user u/Reggie_Barclay explained, Below Deck Med would benefit from taking the focus off the drama on the ship sometimes. &#34;[The show would] be so much better focusing on Haleigh and maybe Luka. She’s low key hilarious.&#34;





 

Although Haleigh has been a big part of the Below Deck Mediterranean season 8 crew, but the majority of moments she&#39;s been a part of have featured her in the background. Haleigh has been known throughout the season for her funny one-liners and moments that have made viewers want to see more of her. While Haleigh has been someone viewers look forward to seeing on Below Deck Med, it&#39;s likely that because she hasn&#39;t been a big part of the drama, the series hasn&#39;t made showing her off a priority. The other crew members are getting more air time, but Haleigh is the one fans are interested in.

After a season with Haleigh on Below Deck Mediterranean, many are hoping to see her join the crew again in future seasons. While Haleigh may not be contributing to the drama of the season, she&#39;s been a breath of fresh air in terms of humor and levity. With all the drama surrounding the other yachties on Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, Haleigh&#39;s humor has been a huge part of what&#39;s making the season worth watching.
