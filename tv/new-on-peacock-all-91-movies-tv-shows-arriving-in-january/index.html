  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Peacock offers a robust catalog of movies and TV shows and continues to expand its reach with new content added every month.   Peacock has become a multifaceted platform by including live-streaming sports and securing lucrative deals with major sports organizations.   In January 2024, Peacock is adding over 90 new movies and TV shows to its collection, including popular titles like The Proposal and the Twilight Saga.</p>

  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>NBC Universal&rsquo;s streaming service Peacock offers a wide variety of movies, TV shows, and even live events, with much more arriving every month.</p>
<p>Peacock features a robust catalog of movies and TV shows, with even more coming to the streaming service in January 2024. Launched to great fanfare in 2020, Peacock changed the streaming game with its mixture of free and paid content, and the streamer was able to land top-tier shows like The Office because of its NBC affiliation. In the years since its debut, Peacock has further expanded its reach by including many hit films on its platform, and it offers one of the largest streaming collections available.</p>
<p>Like most streaming services, Peacock&rsquo;s catalog isn&rsquo;t stagnant, and each month the streamer adds dozens of new shows and movies to keep things fresh. Additionally, Peacock has also become a home for live-streaming sports, and their lucrative deals with the MLB, Premiere League, and World Wrestling Entertainment have made them a truly multifaceted platform. The best TV shows on Peacock represent the upper echelon of streaming entertainment, and the service has begun to create memorable series and movies that rival the original content of their competitors. In January 2024, more than 90 movies and TV shows are new to Peacock, and that&rsquo;s excluding live sporting events.</p>
<p>For more on the movies and TV shows coming to other streaming platforms, check out what&rsquo;s new on Paramount+ and new on Netflix.</p>
<pre><code>              All 62 Movies &amp; TV Shows Leaving Peacock This Month   The NBC/Universal affiliated streaming service Peacock features a revolving door of great shows and movies. Here's everything leaving January 2024.    
</code></pre>

<p>The first of the month has become the traditional big library drop day for streaming services. That’s the day of the month when most streamers add a huge number of (usually movie) titles that aren’t brand new. These are usually the movies that people haven’t seen in a long time and want to revisit or the movies that people can watch over and over again and still enjoy them. There are rom-coms like The Proposal, family movies like Shrek Forever After, and R-rated dramas like The Wolf of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Fans of heist movies have the Ocean’s Eleven movies to look forward to this month. All three of the George Clooney fronted movies are available to stream. So is Sandra Bullock’s Ocean’s 8. While not all audience members appreciated the switch to an all-female team, the movie has an impressive cast including Mindy Kaling and Rihanna, and everyone is utilized as well as the previous trilogy featuring the male leads. All four movies have fantastic chemistry among the actors.</p>
<p>Twilight fans can also rejoice that all five movies are available to watch on Peacock in January. They can relive Bella falling for Edward and becoming a member of the Cullen family before the inevitable remake happens. Fans will have to hurry to watch a lot of the movies added to Peacock in January though. Many of those added on January 1 will leave Peacock again by the end of the month, and that includes The Twilight Saga.</p>
<p>January 2</p>
<p>Compliance (2011)   Flawless (2007)</p>
<p>A pair of very different thrillers join Peacock on January 2. Both received limited theatrical releases when they debuted, so they didn’t have a huge audience at the time. Streaming gives both of them a chance to be seen by more eyes. Compliance is actually inspired by the real story of someone impersonating a police officer and calling restaurants, convincing managers to strip search employees. Though it happened to multiple people and restaurants, Compliance is inspired by one specific instance that happened over several hours. Flawless, on the other hand, is about a diamond heist that isn’t really about the money, but the revenge. Both movies feature stellar casts with Ann Dowd and Dreama Walker in Compliance and Demi Moore and Michael Caine in Flawless.</p>
<p>January 4</p>
<p>The Silent Twins (2022)</p>
<p>Another movie not seen by a wide audience is also added to Peacock in January. Starring Leticia Wright and Tamara Lawrence as the title characters, The Silent Twins is inspired by the book of the same name. Centering on a pair of young women who are members of the only Black family in a small Welsh town, the movie sees the sisters come to only trust and rely on one another after being targeted by the town’s inhabitants. They only communicated with one another, retreating into a fantasy world instead of dealing with their unpleasant reality, and were eventually institutionalized after multiple acts of vandalism. While the movie received mixed reviews, the performances of the leads were praised, and deserve a watch before The Silent Twins is removed from Peacock.</p>
<p>January 9</p>
<p>13 Assassins (2010)   World’s Fastest Indian (2005)</p>
<p>January 9 sees a biographical drama and a samurai movie added to Peacock. The very different movies give subscribers drastically different options to watch. 13 Assassins follows a group of assassins who unite to work together and remove a corrupt and violent noble from power before he can gain greater political standing. The movie has been praised for balancing its characters with its action, and its final fight sequence - which lasts 45 minutes - is a highlight. World’s Fastest Indian, on the other hand, is a much less bloody movie about a man from New Zealand who made it his goal to race the Bonneville Speedway in Utah. Anthony Hopkins stars as Burt Munro, and his turn in the movie made it a hit in New Zealand before it was released to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>January 10</p>
<p>Renegade (2004)</p>
<p>Though this movie was called Renegade in the US when it was released on DVD, it was originally called Blueberry when it was produced and released in France. That’s because Blueberry is actually the name of the Franco-Belgian comic book series that inspired the movie. The movie and the comic books, however, are very different from one another. A Western, the movie sees one man trying to keep the peace between white settlers and those indigenous to the territory. While the story didn’t earn great critical responses, the visuals of the movie did. It’s unique among Westerns because the big climax isn’t a gun battle, but a shamanic ritual.</p>
<pre><code>              The 30 Best Movies On Peacock (January 2024)   Peacock has a wide variety of movies available to stream, with popular, award-winning, and genre-defining films in any genre a cinephile could want.    
</code></pre>
<p>January 11</p>
<p>Adventures of Puss in Boots (Seasons 1–3)   Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris (2022)   Ted (Season 1)</p>
<p>A pair of television series inspired by movies and a unique comedy are added to Peacock on January 11. The television series are very different from one another. While Adventures of Puss in Boots is part of the beloved Shrek universe, Ted is inspired by the more adult comedy of the same name. It’s a prequel to the movie that starred Mark Wahlberg. Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris is a feel-good movie about a working-class woman who travels to Paris in the 1950s because she falls in love with Dior gowns and wants one for herself. Her adventure in the world of high fashion is inspiring and proves that anyone should be able to appreciate beautiful things.</p>
<p>January 12</p>
<p>The Traitors (Season 2, Episodes 1-3)   The Traitors Postmortem (Premiere)   Vanishing On 7th Street (2010)</p>
<p>Vanishing On 7th Street has been making its way across different streaming services for the last year, and now, it’s Peacock’s turn. The little-seen thriller stars Hayden Christiansen and features people disappearing during a blackout without a trace. It’s the kind of story that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat trying to figure things out. The Traitors is also a show that keeps the audience trying to figure things out. In that case, however, it&rsquo;s a reality show in which contestants complete challenges to earn money while one person is a “traitor” to the group, and they have to figure out who the traitor is. The series returns for a second season with episodes airing weekly after the premiere, and for the first time, it will also have a postmortem show discussing the episode.</p>
<p>January 17</p>
<p>Train to Busan (2016)</p>
<p>Train to Busan is one of the best-known zombie movies out of South Korea. While it initially got mixed reviews from critics, in 2016, it drew more than 11 million viewers to cinemas in the country and spawned a franchise. An animated prequel, a standalone sequel, and more installments in development mean that the audience keeps coming back for more, even if critics are divided. The original movie follows a group of passengers on a train in South Korea who find themselves caught in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. The movie has proven so popular that an American remake of it, set in New York, is in development.</p>
<p>January 18</p>
<p>NOPE (2022)</p>
<p>Jordan Peele is amassing quite an impressive body of work as a filmmaker. When NOPE screened at different film festivals all over the world, it picked up a slew of nominations and awards - and was also recognized by different critics associations - primarily for cinematography and Keke Palmer’s role. The movie follows a pair of siblings who lose their father and try to prove that the UFO responsible for his death exists. In trying to get others to help them gain the “money shot” of the creature, however, there are several more deaths. NOPE has been called an exploration of society’s obsession with fame and recognition but with a sci-fi twist. It was previously available on Peacock right after releasing in theaters, and now, it returns to its streaming home.</p>
<p>January 19</p>
<p>Syrup (2013)   Take This Waltz (2011)</p>
<p>January 19 sees the addition of box office bomb Syrup and film festival darling Take This Waltz. The former, like NOPE, examines the quest for success and fame, but it does it through an energy drink company rather than a science fiction story. Starring Amber Heard and Shiloh Fernandez, the movie didn’t land with critics or audiences, only earning $663 at the box office. Streaming gives the movie a new chance to be seen. The latter, on the other hand, generated a lot of film festival buzz thanks to the performances of Seth Rogen and Michelle Williams. The movie is about relationships and the search for passion as Williams and Rogen’s characters find their marriage ending when Williams’ Margot falls for the artist who lives across the street.</p>
<p>January 25</p>
<p>In the Know (Season 1)</p>
<p>Peacock gets its first adult animated series with In The Know. It’s stop-motion animation instead of traditional animation. The series follows Lauren Caspian (voiced by Zach Woods), the host of a public radio interview program. The official description of the series calls Caspian a &ldquo;well-meaning hypocrite,&rdquo; which will surely lend itself to some great comedy.</p>
<p>Along with the new additions to the streamer, Peacock will also see new episodes of series from Universal-NBC networks added the day after they originally air. That includes the dramas returning to NBC in January, like the Chicago franchise and Law &amp; Order: SVU. Peacock is also the streaming home for soap opera Days of Our Lives. That means there is plenty of new content on Peacock in January.</p>
