## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way cast member Mary Demasu-ay is struggling in her relationship with Brandan DeNuccio. She says her &#34;life is hard.&#34;




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Mary Demasu-ay fueled more rumors of a possible split with Brandan DeNuccio after sharing a strange message with fans. Mary and Brandan, both 23, current star in The Other Way season 5. Mary found her dream American man in Brandan on a dating app. She swiped right on him because he resembled Justin Bieber and Harry Potter. Brandan&#39;s ex had cheated on him, and Mary came to him as an angel in disguise. However, Mary began controlling Brandan because of her insecurities. She ensured that Brandan was on a video call with her 24/7 and fought with him, even if he looked at another woman.




Mary and Brandan&#39;s troubled relationship has seemingly become more toxic since they got married. Mary recently shared a cryptic Instagram Story. It&#39;s not the first time she&#39;s talked to her fans in riddles, but Mary&#39;s update seemed concerning enough. The Filipina woman shared two Instagram Story slides. The first one said, &#34;Maybe it’s not the right time For me...” Mary added that she knows things will &#34;get better someday.&#34; She further wrote, &#34;Just trust the process.&#34; Mary then added something extremely worrying. &#34;I know God [is] preparing something for me,&#34; she continued.

 Mary &amp; Brandan&#39;s Toxic 90 Day Fiancé Relationship Explained 
          




In her next Instagram Story, Mary decided to create panic by writing, &#34;I know I can. But I can’t. Life is hard.” Mary and Brandan&#39;s wedding ceremony kicked off in the most recent episode of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. The couple tried their best to forget about their fights while they were getting married in the Philippines. Most of Brandan and Mary&#39;s arguments were over money and how poorly they manage it. Brandan was the one who started picking fights with Mary once they found out she was pregnant. He started second-guessing his decision to move to Candoni.


 

What made matters worse was that Brandan barely had any money left in his bank after he spent $60,000 on building his house with Mary. Meanwhile, college dropout Mary, who used to work as a model, stopped modeling because Brandan was against it. Once he realized that they were not ready to become parents, Brandan became irritable. He started sleeping more and playing games on his phone all the time. Mary took out a big loan to open a store, but Brandan didn&#39;t help her run it. They also lacked basic business acumen and couldn&#39;t make any profits. Mary almost backed out from marrying Brandan because of his video game obsession.




It&#39;s not as if Brandan stopped playing games after they welcomed their baby. Mary recently went live on Instagram as she fought with Brandan about him buying a game and not buying a new phone for her instead. She even posted some more cryptic Instagram Stories about how both of them deserve to be with better people. Brandan and Mary still haven&#39;t been able to resolve their relationship problems. There&#39;s a lot of worry about how Brandan and Mary will be able to raise the baby with their level of immaturity.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
