Summary

  The Yellowstone spinoff 1923 received critical acclaim and broke records for Paramount Plus, drawing 7.4 million viewers for its premiere.   Season 2 of 1923 faced production challenges due to the Hollywood strikes, including the loss of a key filming location.   While there is no official release date for season 2 yet, fans can expect the storyline to continue with the Duttons&#39; fight to retain their ranch and the resolution of various hanging threads from season 1.  





The Yellowstone spinoff 1923 ended season 1 in early 2023, and as a second season has been announced, details have been revealed or presumed about its release date, plot, and more. Part of Taylor Sheridan’s Dutton family franchise that began with Yellowstone&#39;s modern-day ranch story, 1923 is a prequel taking place in the titular year. It&#39;s also a sequel to the previous Yellowstone spinoff, 1883. This series stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren as Jacob and Cara Dutton, the heads of an earlier generation of Yellowstone&#39;s Dutton&#39;s in the time just before the Great Depression.




Like all the shows revolving around the sprawling Dutton family tree, 1923 was critically acclaimed, with a 91% score on Rotten Tomatoes. The series premiere even broke the record for a Paramount Plus debut, drawing 7.4 million viewers according to Deadline. Taking Sheridan’s franchise down an even more grim storyline than what had come before, 1923 season 1 ends with tragedy, loss, and the possibility that the Dutton&#39;s will lose their ranch within the year. While 1923 season 2 updates are light, the Yellowstone spinoff should start off with the plot in motion.

 1923 Season 2 Latest News 
         

After losing its primary shooting location, and being delayed due to the Hollywood strikes, the latest news offers a 1923 filming update from one of the series&#39; stars. Brandon Sklenar who plays the role of Spencer Dutton finally gave fans the news they had long wanted to hear when he announced that the show would begin shooting very soon. Though he offered little in the way of specifics, Sklenar explained that &#34;I will [get a chance to film with my costars] in the last eight episodes that we&#39;re about to start.&#34; Like many delayed shows, 1923 will likely begin filming in the first few months of 2024.






 1923 Is Renewed For Season 2 
          

Eight episodes were not enough to tell the whole story of 1923. Spencer and Alex didn’t look to be any closer to America, and the priest story, the mining plotline, and a number of other minor side ventures made it clear that much more would be needed to finish the Dutton family story during the Roaring &#39;20s. So it isn&#39;t a surprise that 1923 was renewed for season 2 by Paramount&#43;, but it was welcome news to have before the first season ended.

                  What&#39;s Going On With Yellowstone? Franchise Future &amp; Changes Explained   2023 will mark an end of an era for Yellowstone and its prequels, but creator Taylor Sheridan already has major plans for spin-offs and sequel series.    



 1923 Season 2 Production Status 
          




Season 2 of 1923 does not have an official release date yet, and the season has been delayed on numerous occasions. Despite a quick renewal from Paramount&#43;, the show was sidelined due to the WGA writer&#39;s strike which brought much of the industry to a halt. Eventually, SAG/AFTRA also went on strike which made filming an impossibility. Fortunately, both strikes have been resolved, but the show is no closer to deciding a release date.



The WGA strike was resolved on September 27th, 2023, and the SAG/AFTRA strike was resolved on November 9th, 2023.






 1923 Season 2 Cast 
          

The cast and characters for 1923 season 2 have not been officially announced yet, but with so many storylines still not wrapped up, some assumptions can be made. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren’s comments regarding season 2 of 1923 imply they will return as Jacob and Cara Dutton. Brandon Sklenar and Julia Schlaepfer are sure to return for season 2 as Spencer and Alex still need to return home and reunite with the rest of the Duttons.




Other expected returns include:

 Actor  1923 Role   Timothy Dalton  Whitfield   Michelle Randolph  Liz Stratford   Darren Mann  Jack Dutton   Aminah Nieves  Teonna Rainwater   



                  1923 Cast &amp; Character Guide   Helen Mirren, Harrison Ford, Timothy Dalton, Jeromy Flynn, and Brandon Sklenar are just some of the big names in the cast of Taylor Sheridan&#39;s 1923.    



 1923 Season 2 Story Details 
          

No story details have been released for season 2 of 1923, but it is easy to assume that the storylines will continue the season 1 plot. At the end of season 1, Whitfield paid overdue property tax on the Dutton ranch, and the land will end up in his possession if the Duttons cannot pay him back promptly. The lengths Jacob and Cara will go to to retain control of their ranch should be the main storyline for season 2. Whitfield will undoubtedly try his best to stop the Duttons from paying, and the result of their escalating conflict could power the final season.




Several other hanging threads should be resolved in season 2 of 1923. Spencer is sent back to Montana while Alex promises she will come to the United States to find him. Their season 2 stories could see the characters pursuing individual adventures — Spencer in Montana and Alex in England. Liz’s miscarriage will most likely figure in as well, and Jack and Liz will have to contend with this personal tragedy. Teonna’s flight from the Catholic boarding school and the pursuing priest plot is sure to figure heavily in season 2, and it could see the Duttons and Teonna’s people joining together against Whitfield and Father Renaud (Sebastian Roché).



 How 1923 Ties Back To The Rest Of The Yellowstone Franchise 
          

The Dutton ranch and the Dutton family, first introduced in Yellowstone, have such a rich and deep history that their lineage is worthy of multiple series worth of backstory. 1923 bridges the first spinoff series, 1883, and the modern-day tale of Yellowstone to give more information about the infamous Duttons. Jacob in 1923 is the older brother of Tim McGraw’s James Dutton from 1883.




Spencer previously appeared in a Yellowstone flashback set in 1893 when he was shown as a child. Isabel May reprises her role from 1883 as Elsa Dutton despite dying in the finale — but in voice only as she narrates 1923. The audience knows that the Dutton ranch will survive the trials of 1923, but how they do so may reveal why the Dutton clan of Yellowstone&#39;s time so ferociously defend themselves and their land.

               1923   Cast:   Harrison Ford, Helen Mirren, Sebastian Roche, Michelle Randolph, James Badge Dale, Marley Shelton, Brian Geraghty, Aminah Nieves    Release Date:   2022-12-18    Seasons:   1    Genres:   Drama, Western    Summary:   A follow-up to the Yellowstone series, also created by Taylor Sheridan, 1923 continues following the Dutton family in 1923. The series takes place after the 1883 show. The Dutton family now deals with some of the most significant American hardships of the century, such as the Prohibition era, the Great Depression, and the fallout of World War I. Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren star as Jacob Dutton and Cara Dutton, the heads of the Dutton legacy.
