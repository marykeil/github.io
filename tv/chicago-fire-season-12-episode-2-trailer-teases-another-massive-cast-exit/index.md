## Literature Review

The Chicago Fire season 12, episode 2 trailer teases Firehouse 51 may have to say goodbye to another firefighter not long after Gallo left.




A new trailer for Chicago Fire season 12, episode 2, hints at another firefighter leaving Chief Boden&#39;s squad. Firehouse 51 will be losing a couple of vital personnel this season, starting with Gallo (Alberto Rosende), who already bade the team farewell in the premiere episode. The Chicago Fire season 12, episode 1 also establishes Brett&#39;s exit plan, as she prepares to marry Casey and move to Portland with him. Both of these exits were already confirmed before One Chicago returned for the season, but Chicago Fire season 12 may be looking at saying goodbye to an unexpected member.




In a new trailer from NBC (via TV Promos), Chicago Fire season 12, episode 2, &#34;Call Me McHolland,&#34; has revealed the conflict between Cruz (Joe Minoso) and the returning Severide (Taylor Kinney). Watch the clip below:


 

The issue arises from Cruz not following Severide&#39;s orders as they deal with a situation. Fed up with his boss barking mandates, Cruz is seen in Chief Boden&#39;s office talking about leaving Firehouse 51.


 Will Cruz Really Leave Firehouse 51 In Chicago Fire Season 12? 
          

The problems started when Severide unexpectedly left Firehouse 51 to attend a supposed elite OFI training camp. This was One Chicago&#39;s way of explaining Kinney&#39;s sabbatical after he requested a temporary leave of absence in the middle of Chicago Fire season 11. While they were able to justify Severide&#39;s sudden departure, it left some issues for people back home. The issues with his wife, Stella Kidd (Miranda Rae Mayo), have been well-documented, but not much has been done to explore Cruz&#39;s problems after he was forced to do Severide&#39;s job in light of his out-of-town gig.




                  Severide&#39;s Exit Looks A Lot More Likely After Chicago Fire Season 12, Episode 1   Taylor Kinney has returned as Kelly Severide in Chicago Fire season 12, episode 1, &#34;Barely Gone&#34; but he may not be staying for very long.    

Cruz worked so hard to make sure that he could effectively do Severide&#39;s job. Understandably, he is upset because he is suddenly downgraded to a subordinate now that the Squad&#39;s official lieutenant is back in Chicago. Considering his situation, it makes sense that Cruz wants to leave Firehouse 51. Given all the personnel changes in Chicago Fire season 12, it&#39;s unlikely that the character will be written out since the show can&#39;t afford to lose any more players. In any case, with Chief Boden involved, Cruz and Severide may be forced to compromise.

While chances are that Cruz and Severide will patch things up, there are questions about whether Chicago Fire season 12 will do anything to address the hierarchical issues in Firehouse 51&#39;s Squad. It&#39;s unfair that Cruz went through all the trouble to level up his abilities only to be demoted because Severide is back. Perhaps he can take over the team once Severide finally chooses OFI over being a firefighter, and if Chicago Fire returns for season 13, these events are seemingly laying the groundwork for that possibility.
