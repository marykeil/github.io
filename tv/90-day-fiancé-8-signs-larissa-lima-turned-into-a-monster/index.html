  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Larissa Lima&rsquo;s provocative behavior and outbursts made for riveting onscreen drama during her
90 Day Fiancé
stint.
Larissa&rsquo;s gold-digging ways and heated conflicts with her mother-in-law showcased her self-centered nature. She&rsquo;s the
&ldquo;Queen&rdquo;
and anyone who&rsquo;s against her
&ldquo;will die.&rdquo;
Larissa&rsquo;s constant flip-flopping on Instagram (from public to private) reveals her desire to control her narrative and keep fans guessing.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Larissa Lima is too much for some people. She&rsquo;s not exactly a shrinking violet. Colt&rsquo;s ex is a diva who&rsquo;s done terrible things.</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé supervillain Larissa Lima was always naughty, and now, she&rsquo;s really in touch with her dark side. The notorious femme fatale always brings the drama. First, Larissa seduced a hapless Colt Johnson, who was too naive to realize that the fiery Brazilian woman had an agenda. Soon enough, that relationship imploded. Gold digger Larissa&rsquo;s outbursts were part of the reason why. Onscreen, from the top of a staircase, this woman yelled,
&ldquo;Who is against the queen will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larissa&rsquo;s theatrics were out of control and, frankly, riveting. During her 90DF franchise stint, Larissa&rsquo;s diva ways became the stuff of legend. Whether she was hitting up Colt for money he claimed he didn&rsquo;t have or tangling with her ornery mother-in-law, 90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Debbie Johnson, Larissa was out for herself. Sure, Colt was annoying, but that&rsquo;s no excuse for domestic violence, and Larissa was accused of that more than once. As for Debbie, well, that was like a battle between &ldquo;monster Larissa&rdquo; and a monster-in-law. It was like King Kong vs. Godzilla.</p>
<p>20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now
Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?</p>
<p>8  Larissa Lima Got Kicked Out Of The 90 Day Fiancé Franchise
Larissa Lima&rsquo;s CamSoda Lingerie Show Got Her Canned</p>
<p>Did Larissa sell out when she put on a racy lingerie show at CamSoda? There are two schools of thought here. On the one hand, she alienated her reality TV employers. The powers-that-be decided to give Larissa the boot because she didn&rsquo;t uphold family values anymore&hellip;but when had she ever done that? The flip side is that, for an extrovert like her (the type of woman who dances at a football game) a sexy online performance like Larissa&rsquo;s might actually be pleasant and empowering. Nonetheless, when she chose to do that show, she dug her own grave. Due to a &ldquo;morals&rdquo; breach, they couldn&rsquo;t welcome her back into the fold.
She must have known what the outcome would be, but Larissa&rsquo;s a rebel. She does what she wants. Larissa&rsquo;s the &ldquo;queen.&rdquo; If she prefers to show a lot of skin, it&rsquo;s her life. However, sometimes, her vulgar yet sensual displays offend others. While no one could call someone a monster for showing their body, the issue is that Larissa basically sold her body. Of course, she wasn&rsquo;t a prostitute, but she did make money from being almost naked online. Some people might judge her for doing that.</p>
<p>7  Larissa Lima&rsquo;s Gold Digging Ways Told A Story
Did She Ever Love Colt Johnson?</p>
<p>90 Day Fiancé&rsquo;s Colt Johnson&rsquo;s been through the wringer lately. He had a serious accident and learning how to walk again was a grueling process. It took time, medication and physical therapy before Colt regained his mobility. The whole incident was very traumatic. Since he was severely injured, he&rsquo;s retreated from the public eye. That may give him some time to reflect on his disastrous relationship with Larissa, who didn&rsquo;t treat him well, not that he was an angel himself.
Larissa was clearly using Colt. Like so many 90 Day Fiancé stars from abroad, she dreamed of living in America and enjoying the kind of fairytale lifestyle that she saw on US TV shows. She expected Colt to open his wallet and make all of her dreams come true. However, it was really hard to withdraw from the Bank of Colt. &ldquo;Coltee&rdquo; was cheap. He claimed he didn&rsquo;t have money, but it&rsquo;s possible that he was, quite wisely, crying poor. If he hadn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d have nothing left.
Yes, Colt was a miser who was too cheap to put air conditioning in his car, even though they lived in baking-hot Las Vegas, but that didn&rsquo;t mean that he should have had to pay for Larissa&rsquo;s many &ldquo;needs,&rdquo; including beauty treatments, very tight dresses and cosmetics. Larissa was a cartoonish sort of gold digger&hellip; a Jessica Rabbit type. While her antics were sometimes comedic, it wasn&rsquo;t so funny when this franchise &ldquo;monster&rdquo; got violent. Larissa loses it like nobody&rsquo;s business, and Colt couldn&rsquo;t really duck and cover. He called the cops instead.</p>
<p>6  Larissa Lisa Plays Mind Games With Her Instagram Followers
Larissa Lima Switches From Public To Private On A Whim</p>
<p>Larissa currently has 638K Instagram followers. Even though she hasn&rsquo;t made a 90DF franchise appearance in years, she&rsquo;s a bona fide celebrity. Larissa was so memorable onscreen that she&rsquo;ll never be forgotten. In the past, she&rsquo;s been a frustrating online presence because she switches her IG profile from public to private so often. Darcey Silva has done the same thing. These reality icons play with fans, teasing them with updates and then disappearing. It feels like they&rsquo;re messing with fans. Now that Larissa&rsquo;s shilling bourbon whiskey on Instagram, she may need to stay public.
Why did Larissa fade in and out on Instagram? Probably to stay in control of her narrative and drum up curiosity. While she could never be described as a 90DF celeb with mystique, Larissa knows that fame&rsquo;s her currency. When she keeps followers guessing, Larissa may feel like she&rsquo;s winning the public relations game.
Right now, she&rsquo;s got money-making options and seems to be enjoying life. She&rsquo;s a big-time Oakland Raiders fan, and her recent whiskey promos tie in with her passion for that team. The company she&rsquo;s advertising was smart to hire her (if she&rsquo;s getting paid - it seems like she is). Larissa&rsquo;s got star quality, clout and a bit of edge - she did get fired for wearing scanty attire online. Larissa&rsquo;s a good fit for a brand that&rsquo;s promoting booze, which can lower inhibitions.</p>
<p>5  Larissa Lima Doesn&rsquo;t Live With Her Children</p>
<p>Larissa Lima Gets Mom-Shamed</p>
<p>Yes, Larissa&rsquo;s a mom, but some women just don&rsquo;t take to parenthood. Every female is different. In her own way, Larissa probably loves her children a lot, but prefers that they live with their father. As long as he&rsquo;s a loving presence in their lives, they will be fine.
Perhaps Larissa knows that achieving the American Dream is the most important thing in her life. She may have enough self-awareness to understand that motherhood isn&rsquo;t a good fit for her. While she&rsquo;s talked about saving up enough money to be with her children again, it never seems to happen. However, in her defense, she&rsquo;s had immigration woes that made her issues more complex.
Mom-shaming is bad. However, she&rsquo;s gotten the brunt of that for years. Since she&rsquo;s such an &ldquo;out there&rdquo; person, Larissa gets attacked for going her own way. While she always tries to be herself, some people would prefer that she was someone else. There is a degree of bravery to the way that she lives, but possibly, her kids should be more of a priority.
Since no one&rsquo;s walked a mile in Larissa&rsquo;s shoes, it&rsquo;s not really their place to judge, but nonetheless, she may sometimes feel ashamed when people criticize her for living in a different country than her children. The fact that she&rsquo;s emotionally able to live apart from her children does say a lot about her, but again, no one knows all the details, except Larissa and the kids&rsquo; father.</p>
<p>4  Larissa Lima Couldn&rsquo;t Get Along With Debbie Johnson
Debbie Johnson&rsquo;s Difficult, But Larissa Lima&rsquo;s Just As Bad</p>
<p>Debbie Johnson was into &ldquo;smother love&rdquo; that nearly emotionally suffocated her son, Colt. When she wasn&rsquo;t cutting up his food before serving it to him, she was making her daughter-in-law Larissa&rsquo;s life a living hell. However, Larissa fought back with a vengeance, and Debbie had good reasons to doubt the glamorous brunette&rsquo;s intentions.
Larissa wasn&rsquo;t really in it for love. That being said, Colt has been a sleaze. He&rsquo;s known for cheating and lying about it. Eventually, when it&rsquo;s way too late, he tells the truth. Perhaps he learned to lie at an early age because telling Debbie the truth would lead to the kind of drama that few could endure. Debbie, a widow who found a new partner after years on her own, may have relied on her child too much. Colt was her everything and that isn&rsquo;t healthy.
Larissa didn&rsquo;t help by challenging Debbie and hating her. They seemed to make up after Larissa&rsquo;s relationship with Colt failed, but there&rsquo;s probably still some bad blood there. However, right now, it&rsquo;s hidden under the surface.</p>
<p>3  Larissa Lima&rsquo;s Relationship With Eric Nichols Is Turbulent
Larissa Lima Seems To Choose The Wrong Men</p>
<p>Larissa seemed to care more about Eric Nichols than she did about Colt. However, she still did the gold digging thing. Eric paid for her plastic surgery, although she was supposed to pay him back. Larissa has extensively revamped her face and body, but she was quite a beauty before her transformation began. She wanted a larger-than-life Hollywood look and she definitely got it. Recovering from all of those operations must have been awful. A person has to want to change very badly to put themselves through that kind of pain.
Now, Larissa has her new look, from sculpted abs to very large breast implants to a nose job. She&rsquo;s reinvented herself, and Eric helped her to get the look she wanted. However, that didn&rsquo;t mean that he was her dream man. These two fought like cats and dogs, and in 2023, they&rsquo;re reportedly not together.
Larissa, who&rsquo;s been arrested, is all about dizzying highs and lows. In her romances, she scales the heights and sometimes falls, finding herself down in the dirt. Possibly, she chooses the wrong men. Whether she&rsquo;s looking for financial security, as with Colt, or looking for a more genuine kind of love (as she seemed to with Eric), Larissa can&rsquo;t make it last. While a lot of people are in the same boat, she may be the problem.
Larissa&rsquo;s temper is just&hellip;extreme. She has trouble controlling her anger. Detachment is a struggle for her. When she gets heated, it can be scary. Maybe she&rsquo;s calmer these days, but it&rsquo;s safe to say that her anger management issues cost her dearly in the past. They may have damaged her relationship with Eric (who loves to pose shirtless online) beyond repair.</p>
<p>2  Larissa Lima&rsquo;s Extremely Vain
Is Larissa Lima A Confident Glamour Girl Or Just Insecure?</p>
<p>Larissa&rsquo;s up to her old tricks in the Instagram pic above, pouting and showing off lip filler. She&rsquo;s all dolled up in a racy outfit, although she&rsquo;s worn things that are much more revealing. What shines through here is either self-love at its most dramatic or serious insecurity. Larissa isn&rsquo;t one of those people who&rsquo;s going to film themselves in basic sweatpants and no makeup. She needs to be camera-ready at all times. The fact that she chose to get so much plastic surgery may be a sign that her body image issues are severe.
She&rsquo;s been torn apart for changing her looks, although that&rsquo;s her right. It&rsquo;s possible that her haters consider her way too vain. However, she&rsquo;s not much different than other Instagram influencers. Tons of IG stars put excessive effort into their appearances - they know that Instagram is theater. They are playing a game. Larissa plays that game well&hellip; maybe too well. Sometimes, it seems like there&rsquo;s not that much going on under the surface, just because she invests endless energy on makeup, hair and fashion.
Of course, she&rsquo;s a woman with all the typical emotions, thoughts and experiences. She&rsquo;s said that being bullied by haters has hurt her. However, she&rsquo;s strong enough to survive. Perhaps her efforts to perfect herself are the result of some trauma. Larissa may not be the villain she seems to be, but toning it down sometimes could allow people to consider her personality more than her looks. Will Larissa ever go for a make-under? No, that&rsquo;s not her style. She has to be herself.</p>
<p>1  Larissa Lima Does Have A Heart</p>
<p>However, Larissa Lima&rsquo;s A Tough Cookie
In Larissa&rsquo;s YouTube video (click on the link to view), she&rsquo;s speaking Portuguese. However, the clip can be auto-translated into English. When it is, it shows Larissa opening up about her &ldquo;fears.&rdquo; Even the most jaded 90 Day Fiancé &ldquo;monster&rdquo; has a softer side, except for a true villain like Geoffrey Paschel, who&rsquo;s in prison for kidnapping and more. Larissa says she has nightmares about the police. She&rsquo;s clearly traumatized by her conflicts with law enforcement. She also opens up about her relationships, and how, if a man really loves a woman, he&rsquo;ll make her feel &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; instead of hurting her.
Sure, she&rsquo;s a &ldquo;baddie,&rdquo; but the clip above shows that she&rsquo;s actually quite an intelligent woman. She&rsquo;s slightly dressed down, and her thoughts are actually very interesting. Larissa manages her image, giving off strong &ldquo;tough cookie&rdquo; vibes, but there is some sensitivity. Maybe she tries to hide that most of the time. While people don&rsquo;t always equate Larissa with brains, it&rsquo;s possible that this 90 Day Fiancé star is crazy like a fox. She&rsquo;s achieved a lot outside the franchise, monster or not.
