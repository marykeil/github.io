## Literature Review
Max confirms the fate of another two-season show after the high-profile cancellation of Our Flag Means Death, scaling down its comedy slate.




Following the high-profile cancellation of Our Flag Means Death, Max has confirmed the cancellation of the comedy Julia. Premiering in March 2022, the Max show centers on Julia Child as she films her famous cooking show, The French Chef, during the 1960s and her relationship with her husband Paul (Frasier alum David Hyde Pierce). Sarah Lancashire plays the titular role in the series created by Daniel Goldfarb, with a cast that includes Bebe Neuwirth, Fran Kranz, Fiona Glascott, Brittany Bradford, Judith Light, Rachel Bloom, Isabella Rossellini, and James Cromwell, among others.




According to Deadline, just days after doing away with Our Flag Means Death, Max has confirmed that Julia is canceled and won&#39;t return for season 3. A representative for Max released a statement reflecting on the dramedy and the legacy of Julia Child, thanking the cast and crew. Read the statement below:


“We are so honored to have partnered with Chris Keyser, Daniel Goldfarb and their masterful creative team and dynamic cast, led by Sarah Lancashire, as they cooked up Julia. Thanks to their beautiful work over two seasons of this heartful, sensual, and inspiring show, we can forever celebrate the incredible legacy of Julia Child.”



 Is Max Moving Away From Comedies? 
          

Max does not have that many comedies as part of its programming slate. With the cancellation of both Our Flag Means Death and Julia, the streaming service is down to only a few other shows. Setting aside HBO Originals like Curb Your Enthusiasm and looking only at live-action comedies created specifically for Max, the current roster includes And Just Like That..., Hacks, and The Sex Lives of College Girls, all three of which return with new seasons. There&#39;s also Rap Sh!t, which has yet to be renewed, and the Chuck Lorre comedy Bookie, which did get a season 2 renewal.




That adds up to five shows, one of which might not be renewed. The outlook is more positive when including adult animated comedies, such as Velma season 2 and Clone High. But even then, looking at the streamer&#39;s upcoming projects, there are high-profile shows in the making, such as a Dune spinoff and The Penguin starring Colin Farrell. But there aren&#39;t any comedies.

                  Missing Niles In Frasier&#39;s Reboot? David Hyde Pierce Has A New Show This Week You Need To Watch   Niles&#39; absence in the Frasier reboot is felt throughout Kelsey Grammer&#39;s Paramount&#43; show, but David Hyde Pierce&#39;s new show may be able to ease that.     

Max is unlikely to give up on comedies completely. But like Peacock and Starz, it could be the case that the streamer has shifted its focus to big franchises and other genres in the belief that those drive up subscriptions and interest. In any case, the end of Julia could well be seen as the latest example of a broader trend.
