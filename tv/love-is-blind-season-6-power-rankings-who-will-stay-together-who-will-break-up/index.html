  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Love Is Blind season 6 is just getting started, but which couples will wind up staying together and which will break up as the series continues on?</p>
<p>Love Is Blind season 6 had some historic firsts, but which of the couples who made it out of the pod phase will stay together in the long run, and which won’t? The singles of Love Is Blind season 6, which was filmed in Charlotte, North Carolina, were all excited to get the opportunity to find love on the exciting series. The cast were hopeful that they would meet their forever match on the show, approaching the pods with an interesting outlook as they were confident that the emotional connections they made would translate into physical connections in the long run. For some, unfortunately, the pods didn’t create lasting relationships.</p>
<p>Those who did make it through the pod phase and chose to get engaged were hopeful upon meeting their partners that their relationships would be able to make it through the difficulties that came with bridging the physical gap. As usual on Love Is Blind, for some it was easy to find themselves in a physical relationship while for others, it was far more difficult to bridge the gap between life in the pods and time in person. With five unique couples getting engaged after the pod phase on Love Is Blind season 6, their journeys have been different.</p>

<p>Jimmy &amp; Chelsea
Likely To Split Up</p>
<p>Although Jimmy and Chelsea’s relationship was high stakes in the pods, the couple found that their connection with each other was exactly what they were hoping for. While Jimmy’s relationship with Chelsea was in contention with his connection with Jessica, Chelsea had a secondary connection with sweetheart Trevor, as well. While Love Is Blind viewers were conflicted on if they wanted the pair to end up with each other or their alternate choices, when Chelsea accepted Jimmy’s proposal, the couple seemed content with their decision despite having made other strong connections. While their connection seemed strong after meeting in person, a few hang-ups came up moving out of the pods.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Chelsea’s relationship, despite moving very quickly as they came out of the pods, had a few issues to address upfront. Jimmy didn’t seem too concerned about Chelsea’s relationship with Trevor, she had some reservations about his connection with Jessica lingering. While the pair have been able to navigate things through Love Is Blind season 6 episode 6, it seems likely that the cracks in their relationship will cause it to crumble. With previews showing Jessica and Trevor both returning to the series later in the season, Jimmy and Chelsea may ultimately split up and choose to be with different partners.</p>
<p>Brittany &amp; Kenneth
Likely To Split Up</p>
<p>Brittany and Kenneth’s connection in the pods was sweet to watch, as the pair shared some incredibly similar morals and were able to bond over their shared values. Brittany, who shared with Kenneth that her ideal partner would be on the same page with her regarding waiting for marriage to be physically intimate, was thrilled to hear that Kenneth felt the same way. Both had worked in education, and they were able to bond over their strong feelings for their professions and bonds with their families. It appeared that after just a few days of getting to know each other, they were already deeply connected to one another.</p>
<p>After meeting in person, Kenneth and Brittany’s connection began to feel somewhat strained. While they worked to make their physical connection happen, it didn’t come as naturally as the emotional connection between them had. Despite knowing that things were potentially more difficult for them than with other couples, Brittany and Kenneth tried to work on their relationship as they continued through their honeymoon. While it’s possible they could find their stride upon returning to their day-to-day lives, it seems that Brittany and Kenneth’s engagement will come to an end rather than result in a lasting marriage.</p>
<p>Laura &amp; Jeramey
Too Soon To Tell</p>
<p>In the pods, Jeramey was one of the guys who couldn’t quite make up his mind. Torn between Laura and another woman, Sarah Ann, Jeramey felt connected to both of them in ways he wasn’t sure how to differentiate between. While he shared that he felt an emotional level of physical attraction toward both women, he ultimately decided that his connection with Laura was deeper than his connection with Sarah Ann and let her know that he wouldn’t be proposing. Laura quickly accepted Jeramey’s proposal, happy to be the one he wanted to be with, and the pair seemed to fit into each other’s lives easily when they first met.</p>
<p>Laura and Jeramey’s connection has been interesting to watch move from the pods to the outside, as they’ve had the ability to transition into the real world somewhat easily. Their physical connection does appear to translate from the pods to the outside, but their relationship is still somewhat rocky. Jeramey, despite feeling strongly for Laura, may not be ready for a commitment with her after getting to know Sarah Ann in the pods. It’s possible that they’ll make it through some hurdles surrounding his commitment, but it’s also possible things will break down for the couple.</p>
<p>A.D. &amp; Clay
Likely To Stay Together</p>
<p>A.D. started off Love Is Blind season 6 trying to figure out which of her connections was real, but things became clear when she realized one of her potential matches had anything but true intentions. After dealing with the fallout from her first connection in the pods with Matthew breaking down, A.D. was hopeful that she hadn’t tarnished her relationship with Clay, who she’d bonded with but found somewhat abrasive early on in the experience. Clay had issues with A.D. finding a connection with Matthew, as he felt that there was nothing redeemable about the other man.</p>
<p>Despite lashing out through the pod wall at A.D., she chose to forgive him and the pair had a vulnerable conversation that led to a deeper connection. A.D. and Clay got engaged somewhat quickly during the Love Is Blind season 6 process, and both found each other deeply attractive when they met in person. Their time on their honeymoon proved that A.D. and Clay were a great match, and it appears that their relationship will continue to flourish as they return home to their day-to-day lives. While it’s possible things could go south, it would be shocking to see A.D. and Clay take a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Amy &amp; Johnny
Likely To Stay Together</p>
<p>Amy and Johnny were the first couple featured on Love Is Blind season 6, and their connection has been the most honest and pure from the very beginning. Despite being from very different backgrounds, the couple quickly became invested in one another emotionally during the pod phase and understood their attraction to one another was intense. They talked about their families and some deeply emotional things in their lives, making a genuine connection in just a matter of conversations. When Johnny proposed to Amy, it wasn’t difficult to predict that she’d say yes.</p>
<p>While both were nervous about meeting in person, they were hopeful about seeing the person they’d fallen in love with in the flesh. The couple were thrilled when they finally saw one another, their physical attraction was mutual as they finally got to begin their genuine relationship. The couple bonded during their time on their honeymoon, and while it’s possible that things could get in their way upon returning to their everyday lives, it seems likely that Johnny and Amy will be one of the couples who make it throughLove Is Blind’s experiment and come out as a genuinely strong couple.</p>
<p>Love Is Blind</p>
<p>season 6 airs new episodes each Wednesday on Netflix.</p>
