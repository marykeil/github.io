## Literature Review
Timothy Sykes was known as the worst Below Deck charter guest, but he came forward with his side of the story on his blog.




Timothy Sykes was branded the worst charter guest in Below Deck history after appearing on an episode in season 2, but he told his side of the story after appearing on the hit Bravo TV series. His episode has become iconic in the franchise, from his helicopter entrance onto the yacht to Chef Ben Robinson&#39;s legendary outburst in the galley. Timothy has stayed on the list of worst charter guests, but his blog shares his thoughts about the episode from his perspective.




On Below Deck, season 2, tensions with the Ohana crew were already high. Kelley Johnson and Jennice Ontiveros were in the middle of a blossoming &#34;boatmance&#34; while his sister Amy Johnson tried to fit in with the other stews. Former Chief Stew Kate Chastain didn&#39;t like the group&#39;s look from the start, as Timothy was bringing his students on a three-day yacht trip, and she said Timothy seemed like a cult leader. The bold entrance when he called the crew his &#34;slaves&#34; for the next three days and matching t-shirts for each student did not help his cause either. While it&#39;s possible there could be worse cast members on the upcoming Below Deck season 11, Timothy still takes one of the top prizes.


 Timothy Knew Below Deck Would Make Him Look Bad 
          

Timothy advertised his time on Below Deck on Facebook, saying he knew he was &#34;gonna look like a jackass.&#34; In an attempt to clear his reputation, Timothy asserted in his blog that Below Deck producers purposefully made him look bad. For example, it was shocking when Timothy requested kids&#39; food for his 19-year-old girlfriend, turning down the five-star meals for chicken tenders. It was clear by Chef Ben throwing pans everywhere and destroying the galley that he was not a fan of Timothy by the end of the charter.






 Timothy Detailed Further Complaints In His Blog 
          

Another of Timothy&#39;s complaints was the WiFi issues, as the day trader was trying to make money while onboard. Some Below Deck fans thought the crew was doing their best, but Timothy said he &#34;specifically requested they bump it up ahead of time with extra routers, devices, etc., which they assured me would make it very fast.&#34; If the Below Deck guest was promised a certain level of service and it was not provided on the Ohana superyacht, some fans agree that he was right to be angry about it.

Timothy bragged that he still made $70K on that trip, even with the poor Wi-Fi onboard. Regardless, Timothy had the nerve to show Captain Lee Rosbach the full $22K tip and remove $5K in front of him. Timothy defends himself by saying $17K is nearly a 25% tip and &#34;the chef didn&#39;t listen to my VERY specific instructions regarding the food.&#34; He added, &#34;Pretty much every group meal was delayed far too long (which they didn&#39;t show).&#34;




Surprisingly, Timothy would happily go on Below Deck again, even directly addressing Captain Lee and the crew in his blog. He said, &#34;I&#39;ll bring even more trading challenge students, and we&#39;ll see if you perform better to earn a bigger tip.&#34; Given how the rest of the crew talks about their experience with him, they may all call in sick for that charter.
