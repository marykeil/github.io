 Daisy Kent’s Hearing Journey 

 

According to CBS8, Daisy started Hear Your Heart because she has profound hearing loss, which was possibly caused by a tick bite that led to Lyme disease, which probably caused Meniere&#39;s disease, a disorder of the inner ear. When Daisy was 15, she discovered that she was losing her hearing when she didn&#39;t hear her father waking her up for school. She realized that something was &#34;wrong&#34; with her left ear. She heard high-pitched ringing, which progressively got worse, and she couldn&#39;t understand speech very well. She was diagnosed with Meniere&#39;s disease at 17, and Lyme disease at 21.

Hearing aids didn&#39;t work for Daisy because speech was still distorted for her, so she researched cochlear implants. Daisy decided to get a cochlear implant and began documenting her experience on TikTok. Daisy recorded her entire journey, from her surgery in March 2023 at UC San Diego Medical Center to the activation of her cochlear implant. She&#39;s continued to share videos about her experiences on the platform. At the time of this writing, Daisy&#39;s TikTok account had 40.8K followers and 4.1 million likes. Daisy also has a YouTube channel with many followers.




Daisy&#39;s interactions with people on social media made her realize that she&#39;s not alone. People her age started reaching out to her, telling her that they were going through something similar. Daisy loves that she&#39;s able to bring comfort to other cochlear implant patients, especially children. Their moms also send her messages, as well as videos of their cochlear implants being activated. In addition, Daisy is happy to answer questions about cochlear implant surgery.



 Daisy Kent&#39;s Children&#39;s Book 

 

Daisy&#39;s ABC bio stated that she dreams of becoming a bestselling author. She&#39;s on her way with the publication of her children&#39;s book, Daisy Doo: All the Sounds She Knew, which is available on Amazon in hardcover, softcover, and Kindle versions. The book&#39;s blurb revealed that the story is about a child named Daisy Doo, who &#34;discovers the beauty of her favorite sounds again, thanks to a cochlear implant! Through the pages of this tale, children and adults will learn to cherish the sound of life and embrace the magic of being uniquely themselves.&#34;




In an Instagram post, Daisy explained that she wrote the book because &#34;I know what it&#39;s like to have something on you that makes you different. A huge part of it is embracing it and loving it and owning it and making it your own. And that&#39;s when it truly becomes a really special thing.&#34; Daisy said that it was a fun process to write the book.

In the CBS8 interview, Daisy shared that she always wanted to write a children&#39;s book. She hopes that kids, parents, and even doctors will benefit from the book, which she says shows what it&#39;s like &#34;to love sounds and have them taken away and be so scared, and then all of them come back to you.&#34; Daisy dedicated the book to her surgeon, Dr. Elina Kari, and the UC San Diego Health medical staff.

 What Daisy&#39;s Looking For 
          

According to her ABC bio, Daisy is &#34;SO ready to find the one.&#34; Because she&#39;s been through so much in life already due to her health, Daisy&#39;s ready to find a man who&#39;ll truly put her first. She&#39;s looking for someone who&#39;s &#34;loyal, adventurous and family-oriented, and will be there for her no matter what.&#34; All of these qualities describe Joey, so he might be the person she&#39;s been searching for.
