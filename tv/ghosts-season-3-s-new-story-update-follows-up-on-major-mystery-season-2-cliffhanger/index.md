## Literature Review
New details about Ghosts season 3 follow up on the CBS sitcom&#39;s cliffhanger, offering hints about what&#39;s next for Sam, Jay, and the overall ensemble.




New details about Ghosts season 3 follows up on a major cliffhanger. An adaptation of the British series with the same name, the CBS version debuted in 2021. It focuses on married couple Samantha (iZombie star Rose McIver) and Jay (Utkarsh Ambudkar, Never Have I Ever) and chronicles what happens to their lives when Samantha has a near-death experience and starts to communicate with spirits.




Now, with the Ghosts season 3 premiere roughly a month away, there are new hints about which spirit got &#34;sucked off&#34; at the end of season 2. In the show&#39;s parlance, getting sucked off has a less NSFW meaning, but rather refers to when a ghost crosses over to the other side. According to TV Insider, the season 3 premiere will directly follow up on which character crossed over. Along with this news, three new images from the season 3 premiere have also been released. Check them out, below:

         



Ghosts season 3 debuts Thursday, February 15 at 9 PM ET on CBS.





 What To Know About Ghosts Season 3 
          




The logline for the season 3 premiere promises that Sam, Jay, and the remaining ghosts will have to unravel the mystery of which spirit crossed over. And, continuing the show&#39;s more episodic nature, Sam and Jay will have to relocate an owl in order to turn their barn into a restaurant for Jay. The first half of the premiere, which addresses the cliffhanger, goes back to when Sam and Jay are sitting in their car outside their estate only to see a bright light, seemingly indicating one of the characters crossing over.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the Ghosts cast secured pay increases ahead of season 3. According to reporting from Deadline, McIver and Ambudkar&#39;s paychecks doubled to $250,000 an episode. The ensemble playing the ghosts — Brandon Scott Jones (Isaac), Richie Moriarty (Pete), Danielle Pinnock (Alberta), Asher Grodman (Trevor), Román Zaragoza (Sasappis), Sheila Carrasco (Flower), Rebecca Wisocky (Hetty) and Devan Chandler Long (Thorfinn) — were mentioned as earning $100,000 an episode for the upcoming season.




                  Ghosts Season 2 Finale: What It Means For The Show&#39;s New Episodes   The season 2 finale of the CBS sitcom Ghosts concluded with a massive cliffhanger that could have a profound impact on the future of the show.    

The news further solidifies Ghosts as a big hit for CBS. The sitcom ranks as the second most-watched comedy on broadcast, in a close battle with the soon-to-be-concluded Young Sheldon. But the pay increase may well suggest that none of the main spirits have yet crossed over, which opens up the door to the other minor characters that have recurred on the show.



Ghosts is available to watch on Paramount&#43;.
