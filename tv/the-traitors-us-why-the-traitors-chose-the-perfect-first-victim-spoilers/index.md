Summary

  The Traitors US season 2 shocked viewers with the first murder, choosing a powerful player as their victim.   The traitors strategically selected their first victim to send a message about their willingness to eliminate major threats.   The Challenge alumni CT and Trishelle feared they could be the next targets due to their similar skills and experiences.  







The Traitors US season 2 returned for its first three episodes with a massive new cast and a shocking first victim. While The Traitors is shocking with each and every episode, the kick-off of the newest season left viewers shocked to see who the team of traitors chose to eliminate first. The season may have just started, but the drama is already at an all-time high as the brand-new cast of The Traitors US season 2 pointed fingers at one another to try and gauge who was a traitor and who was faithful. After a long-drawn-out debate, things took a turn after the first murder of the season.

There were a handful of people that the traitors discussed potentially taking out during the first murder of The Traitors US season 2. While there were competitors that were entirely off the table, like Big Brother’s Janelle Pierzina and Survivor’s Sandra Diaz-Twine, the traitors wanted to send a message with the first murder that they wouldn’t simply be sending home weaker players who didn’t have experience in strategy games. Instead, they narrowed down their selection to a slim group of power players who would be sure to leave the rest of the faithful shaken about their futures in the game.

 Johnny Bananas Was A Huge Competitive Threat 

 

Although he was one of the more vocal participants at the first round table after the traitors were initially chosen, both Dan Gheesling and Phaedra Parks felt that choosing Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio as their first victim would be the best choice for the group. As a long-time alum of The Challenge, Johnny is a physical competitor who knows how to lie and manipulate his way to the end of a competition. Both Dan and Phaedra were nervous that because of his prowess in strategy games, Johnny would be far too much of a vocal asset on the faithful side to allow him to stick around.






 The Traitors Wanted To Send A Message 
          

With Johnny’s murder, the traitors were hoping to send a message to the rest of the cast. While Johnny was a major player in the game who could’ve helped the cast succeed on missions and organize a bit better, the traitors needed to express the fact that not only would they be happy to take out power players, but they wouldn’t be afraid to remove the biggest threats in the game. Dan and Phaedra needed to make it clear that they were working hard to remove faithful who could help the team find their identities, even if it cost them some of the money at the end of the competition.



 The Challenge Alumni CT And Trishelle Were Nervous 
          




As a long-time player on The Challenge, Johnny’s skillset was developed by the series and was able to translate to The Traitors US easily. His fellow The Challenge alumni on the series, Chris “C.T.” Tamburello and Trishelle Cannatella, were both nervous about their own lives in the game being in jeopardy after Johnny’s murder. Coming from the same franchise, C.T. and Trishelle were both worried that their similar skills and experiences would make them targets for the traitors moving forward. Both will be working hard to ensure they can continue on The Traitors US without any issues.
