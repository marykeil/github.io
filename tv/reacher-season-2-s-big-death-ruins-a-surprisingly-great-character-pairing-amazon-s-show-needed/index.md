Summary

  Reacher season 2 had a tragic death that ruined its best character pairing, Russo and Reacher.   Russo&#39;s death raised the stakes and made the villains appear more serious and formidable.   Although Reacher&#39;s dynamic with his new team is compelling, his best pairing was with Russo, and their fight tease will never be paid off.  







Reacher season 2 was paving the way for its best pairing, but a tragic death completely ruined it. Based on Lee Child&#39;s Bad Luck and Trouble, Reacher season 2 begins with the titular character hearing about the murders of his former team members from the 110th Special Investigations Unit. To get to the bottom of these murder mysteries and serve justice to the perpetrators, Reacher joins forces with the surviving members of his team, Neagley, Dixon, and O&#39;Donnell.

Although Reacher&#39;s dynamic with season 2&#39;s main characters does not necessarily replace what he had with Roscoe and Finlay in season 1, it adds some novelty to the series, allowing audiences to see a different side of the titular character. At the same time, it also makes room for the show to explore Reacher&#39;s military background. However, as compelling as Reacher&#39;s new team-up with Neagley, Dixon, and O&#39;Donnell may seem, his best pairing was with someone else in season 2.

 Russo&#39;s Death Spoils Reacher Season 2&#39;s Best Character Pairing 
Russo and Reacher could have been a great pair
         



In many ways, Reacher&#39;s dynamic with Russo almost seemed reminiscent of his relationship with Finlay in season 1&#39;s early episodes.




Reacher season 2 introduces Neagley, David, and Dixon as the titular character&#39;s new allies, but the character&#39;s best pairing in the season has been with Russo. From the season&#39;s initial moments, Reacher and Russo had a typical buddy-cop dynamic where their methods and personalities contrasted. Unlike Reacher&#39;s former team members from the 110th Special Investigations Unit, Russo was never technically his partner. However, solving the murder case of Reacher&#39;s former team members forced them together, leading to humor and even conflicts they had to learn to resolve together.




In many ways, Reacher&#39;s dynamic with Russo almost seemed reminiscent of his relationship with Finlay in season 1&#39;s early episodes. Like Finlay, Russo was a more by-the-book police detective, while Reacher stuck to his unconventional methods and &#34;cowboy s**t&#34; despite being warned by Russo. Like all mismatched cop partners from buddy cop films, Reacher and Russo&#39;s relationship started with a period of conflict and heavy disagreement. However, they did eventually find some common ground, and Reacher even trusted him enough to get him involved in their episode 6 mission.

The gradual evolution of their relationship in Reacher season 2 makes them the season&#39;s best pair, but Russo&#39;s sudden death ruins it. In season 2, Reacher mentions that if Finlay had been in the military with him, he would have recruited him in the 110th Special Investigations Unit. Although Reacher does not explicitly say the same about Russo, Russo&#39;s sacrifice in Reacher season 2, episode 6 proves that he, too, was worthy of getting the same level of respect from Reacher as Finlay. Just like Reacher and Finlay ultimately made a great team and even joined forces again in season 2, Reacher and Russo would have forged a formidable partnership. Unfortunately, circumstances did not allow it.






 Reacher Season 2 Can&#39;t Pay Off Its Exciting Fight Tease Now 
Reacher season 2 teased an exciting fight that will never happen
          

Season 2 kept teasing a rematch between Russo and Reacher after Reacher kicked his car and deployed his airbag. Even during their confrontation at the cemetery in Reacher season 2&#39;s episode 5, Russo firmly stands up to Reacher and confronts him by saying he will give him the beating he owes him. Reacher fires back at him by responding he will take up the fight anytime he wants. Given how the two were at the end of their wits on the scene, they likely would have duked it out if so many people were not watching them.

Although Reacher likely would have won the fight, it would have been interesting to see how a tenacious man like Russo would have challenged the seemingly invincible character. The fight would also have been hilarious in more ways than one, given how the two would try to win without gravely injuring one another. Sadly, with Russo&#39;s death, Reacher season 2 cannot pay off the exciting fight tease.






Reacher season 2 drops new episodes every Friday on Amazon Prime Video.






 Why Reacher Season 2 Killed Off Russo 
Russo&#39;s death was tragic but necessary for Reacher season 2
         

Reacher season 2 significantly deviates from its source material by portraying Russo&#39;s death. It takes this risk because Reacher season 2 somehow had to raise the stakes for the main characters to make its villains appear more serious and formidable. By highlighting how a skilled police detective lost his life in the pursuit of serving justice to season 2&#39;s antagonists, Amazon&#39;s Reacher has upped the danger for the main character and his team before the finale. Owing to this, even though Russo&#39;s death spoils the season&#39;s best character pairing and even prevents the season from paying off a fight tease, it seems necessary for Reacher season 2&#39;s overarching storyline.




             Reacher Produced by Amazon Prime Video, Reacher adapts Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher book series to live-action.
