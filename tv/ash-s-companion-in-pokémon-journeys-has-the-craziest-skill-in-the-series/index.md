# Ash s Companion In Pokémon Journeys Has The Craziest Skill In The Series


## SUMMARY 



  Goh, Ash&#39;s companion in Pokémon Journeys, catches far more Pokémon than Ash, averaging one per episode.   Goh&#39;s casual approach to catching Pokémon and his skill at throwing Poké Balls sets him apart from other companions.   Goh&#39;s catching style is inspired by the game Pokémon Go, and he aims to catch every Pokémon, bringing the anime closer to its original catchphrase &#34;Gotta Catch &#39;em All&#34;.

## Literature Review

Some characters get all the luck, and in Pokémon Journeys, that character is Ash&#39;s companion Goh, blessed with an incredible Pokémon catching talent.




Ash&#39;s new companion for Pokémon Journeys happened to be a young boy named Goh, who possesses an uncanny talent for throwing Poké Balls and catching Pokémon. Journeys represented a very new direction for the series, roaming the world instead of being limited to just one region, and adding only one traveling companion instead of the two or more that fans had become accustomed to.




Over the course of Journeys, Goh catches at least 115 Pokémon, averaging about one per episode - a fact that actually puts him ahead of Ash, who only had a total of 78 Pokémon, including his 30 Tauros. For Ash, a new Pokémon capture is always a big deal, and usually the focal point of the episode. 

          

However, Goh catches Pokémon far more casually, with episodes sometimes opening with Goh catching a Pokémon in the cold open, unrelated to the plot of the episode at all. Goh catches more Pokémon in some episodes than Ash catches in a whole season, showing a level of success that hints at some secret skill.

                  All of Ash&#39;s Companions, Ranked By Number of Pokémon Caught   Ash may not have caught them all, but how did his friends fare over the course of the series? Here&#39;s each of Ash&#39;s traveling companions, ranked.   





 Goh&#39;s Skill at Throwing Poké Balls is Unmatched 
          

While characters in the anime traditionally must battle and weaken a Pokémon before attempting to catch it, Goh adheres to no such requirement, instead typically throwing ordinary red Poké Balls at just about any Pokémon he sees. While this doesn&#39;t always work, his success rate at catching Pokémon in this way is almost preposterously high. In one episode, Goh is even able to capture the Legendary Pokémon Suicune, simply by throwing a Poké Ball at it. Admittedly, said Suicune was being pursued by poachers who had weakened it somewhat, but Goh still managed an impressive feat.

As fans might guess from his name, Goh was inspired by Pokémon Go, a mobile game in which players must catch Pokémon without fighting and weakening them first. Goh&#39;s catching style imitates that seen in the game, with Goh often pulling off curveball throws, which help increase the chance of catching in Pokémon Go. The game&#39;s focus on catching and collecting also helped to shape Goh&#39;s goal of catching every Pokémon, which he hopes will eventually lead him to Mew. Goh&#39;s style stands out, since he&#39;s the only one who really catches Pokémon in this manner.






 Ash&#39;s Companion In Journeys Was Inspired By Pokémon Go 
          

Goh&#39;s incredible success would seem to suggest that battling a Pokémon isn&#39;t really necessary, although it is often times used as a means of demonstrating one&#39;s skill to the Pokémon being captured as much as it is weakening them. While Goh doesn&#39;t always hit his target, and some powerful Pokémon he catches still need to be weakened first, Goh brought a completely different style to the anime that actually brought it closer to its &#34;Gotta Catch &#39;em All&#34; roots.

Goh&#39;s incredible aim and throwing abilities were toned down a bit as the series went on, but the fact remains that Goh&#39;s strategy made him the most successful collector in the Pokémon anime as a whole, despite having hundreds fewer episodes to do it in than Ash.




All seasons of Pokémon Journeys are available on Netflix.
