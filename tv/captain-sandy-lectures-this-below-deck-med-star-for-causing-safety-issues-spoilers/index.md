## Literature Review
Below Deck Mediterranean&#39;s Captain Sandy Yawn has no choice but to lecture one of her staff members for causing safety issues in an exclusive clip.




Below Deck Mediterranean’s Captain Sandy Yawn is fair when it comes to her staff, but when things aren’t being done properly, she’s not afraid to correct her staff and does just that in a preview from an upcoming episode of the series. Captain Sandy’s crew has been in a place of disarray this season as they’ve moved through the charter season with some crew members choosing to leave Mustique early, making it difficult for everyone to function in the manner they’re meant to. During a new episode of the popular Below Deck spin-off, Captain Sandy and the Mustique’s crew are hosting a rowdy charter and need all hands on deck.




In a preview from an upcoming episode of Below Deck Mediterranean season 8, Captain Sandy has a terse discussion with Bosun Luka Brunton about the way he’s running his crew. “Man it makes me mad,” Sandy shared about the state of things on Mustique during the charter guest’s dinner in a clip from Bravo.


 

When going through the schedule with Luka, Sandy was confused about how exactly he was choosing to run things. “Max should’ve had a break this morning, you’ve always got to plan for that,” Sandy explained before questioning Luka about the rest of the staff. When he wasn’t able to answer regarding the Stew schedule, she couldn’t hold back with the Bosun. “Never put three people down [for breaks] at the same time - and you never leave the boat. it’s a safety issue.”

 Below Deck Med Charter Guest Invades Crew Quarters 
          

Sandy understands that this is Luka’s “first time being a Bosun, but we’re deep into the charter season, so my expectation is higher of him.” Elsewhere, the rest of the charter was in disarray as the guests got a little too rowdy for the crew. Chef Tumi Mhlongo explained, “this charter has definitely been unnecessarily stressful. The guests have been stressful, but also at the same time, Lily’s lack of experience is becoming more of a liability” With new stew Lily Davison causing issues, Tumi was frustrated. “[She’s] slowing everything down, which means that I need the Deck’s help.” While Tumi was looking for help, the guests were getting wild.





 

Amish, one of the charter guests, got progressively drunker as the evening continued, eventually finding himself down below deck, invading the crew members bunks in the wee hours of the morning. While Amish was looking for the hot tub, instead he found sleeping crew members who were confused as to how their charter guest found his way down to the crew’s space. The crew was trying to maintain their professionalism, but it remains to be seen if they’ll be able to continue to handle this group of charter guests. Luka or Captain Sandy may have to step in if things become too uncomfortable between the crew and the guests.

While Below Deck Med season 8 has been lighter on drama, the charger guests have been an interesting mix, and the group previewed in the clip are some of the rowdier guests that have been shown throughout the season. With a loud group who isn’t fully respectful of boundaries or rules, things can go wrong quickly on a charter. As Luka navigates his first season as a Bosun and Sandy puts tough expectations on him, things could go sideways, but it’s clear that the Below Deck Mediterranean crew will be able to handle any issues they come by, albeit some more smoothly than others.
