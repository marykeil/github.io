# Marvel Crowns A New Most Powerful MCU Hero After The Most OP Upgrade Ever


## SUMMARY 



  Captain Carter becomes the most powerful MCU character, thanks to an OP upgrade that includes the Infinity Armor, Hela&#39;s helmet, and a gamma-infused sword.   The escalation of power in the MCU is a storytelling issue that requires each new villain to be more powerful than the last.   While characters like G&#39;iah and God Loki add excitement, their immense power poses challenges for future storylines and may require even bigger threats to justify their presence.

## Literature Review
The last MCU release of 2023 changed the power rankings of the MCU again, giving one hero the biggest power upgrade possible.





Summary

  Captain Carter becomes the most powerful MCU character, thanks to an OP upgrade that includes the Infinity Armor, Hela&#39;s helmet, and a gamma-infused sword.   The escalation of power in the MCU is a storytelling issue that requires each new villain to be more powerful than the last.   While characters like G&#39;iah and God Loki add excitement, their immense power poses challenges for future storylines and may require even bigger threats to justify their presence.  







Just months after Marvel Studios threw out the powers rulebook to make Secret Invasion&#39;s G&#39;iah the most powerful MCU hero, they&#39;ve done it again for another character. Thanks to the most cartoonish power upgrade ever seen on the MCU timeline - and that includes Emilia Clarke&#39;s Skrull learning the powers of every Avenger and Thanos&#39; Black Order - What If...? season 2 crowned a new most powerful MCU character.

2023 has seen a major rearrangement of the most powerful superhero hierarchy in the MCU. God-tier heroes like Adam Warlock, Phyla, G&#39;iah, and God Loki all made the power levels of the original Avengers - and even their most formidable villains - look paltry by comparison. Considering how vast their powers are, the fact that What If...? managed to surpass them all for season 2&#39;s cameo-heavy finale is even more outrageous.

                  Every MCU TV Show Ranked Worst To Best   From WandaVision to She-Hulk, from Loki to Ms. Marvel, the MCU&#39;s Disney&#43; TV shows have been hits - but how do they all compare to one another?    





 Captain Carter Just Got The Most OP Upgrade Yet 
          

What If...? season 2 episode 9 fully embraced the anime-like escalation that had defined the Guardians of the Multiverse storyline at the end of the first season. Though the pay-off was less strongly set-up, the return of Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s universe-killing Sorceror Supreme did provide an opportunity for greater spectacle.

After discovering that Strange Supreme’s plan was to use super powered individuals to power a universe forge and revive his own lost universe, Captain Carter allies with Kahhori to take him down. Strange has amassed a collection of hugely powerful heroes and villains, intent on using their energy as fuel for the forge, including Kahhori herself. As he attempts to pay his plan off and teleports his prisoners into the forge, the doomed heroes and villains throw their weapons to Carter.




             What If...? What If… ? is an animated anthology series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which features fan-favorite characters, including Peggy Carter, T’Challa, Doctor Strange, Killmonger, Thor, and more. The new series, directed by Bryan Andrews with AC Bradley as head writer, features signature MCU action with a curious twist. The show sees Uatu the Watcher, an omnipotent being that observes the events of multiple universes from afar as they unfold, unable to interfere. However, things shift when an entity peers beyond the veil, jeopardizing the multiverse.   Cast   Samuel L. Jackson , Stanley Tucci , Michael Douglas , Sean Gunn , Mark Ruffalo , Karen Gillan , Tom Hiddleston , Jeffrey Wright , Michael B.

By this point, Carter has already stolen the Infinity Armor from Killmonger, so wields the compared power of the universe-shaping Stones. She then adds Hela’s enchanted helmet, and a magical sword from Banner of War’s Hulk/Thor mash-up, which could be Excelsior. In other words, Carter becomes the most well-armored MCU character ever, with weaponry collected from so-called “universe killers” surpassing the collected might of gods. The Infinity Stones alone made her top tier, combined with her super soldier foundation: adding the power over the dead of Hela, and a gamma-infused sword gilds the lily.



The Asgardian variant of Hulk is from Donny Cates&#39; Hulk vs Thor: Banner of War run from 2022.









 Why So Many 2023 MCU Characters Are God-Tier 
         

The MCU has an escalation issue that started with the first appearance of Thanos. Sequels in this shared universe have to come with escalated stakes, and the promise of new Avengers movies adds the difficult obligation of introducing a new villain who surpasses the last in every way. Captain Carter’s upgraded power status at the end of What If…? season 2 fits that bill, given how incredibly powerful Strange Supreme is. The medium also allows for the kind of one-off creativity of giving one character a ridiculous arsenal with no need for longevity. It’s purely about the cool factor.

On the other hand, the likes of G&#39;iah, Phyla, Adam Warlock, and God Loki present issues for the future, because they’re simply too powerful. Each was introduced either for narrative reasons, or to deal with a major threat. They’re all the product of escalation, and will now become a symptom of the same thing: their presence requires even bigger threats to justify them, or they’ll end up being nerfed.




It’s something of a catch-22 for the MCU and the same issue the Jurassic Park universe faced: the audience needs the exhibits to keep getting bigger and more dangerous. Heroes adapt to that requirement, and suddenly every potential Avenger is a god, rather than Thor standing out in the original line-up as the only hero at that sort of level. At least in What If…? It doesn’t matter in any sort of long term way.



Every episode of Marvel&#39;s What If...? season 2 is available to stream on Disney&#43; now.
