  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>The Traitors UK season 2 has finally arrived &amp; with a cast of 22 players, the stakes are higher than ever for the traitors &amp; the faithful in the game.</p>
<p>The Traitors UK season 2 has finally premiered and the cast that has been kept under wraps has finally been revealed to the public. While The Traitors US season 2 cast was released well before the upcoming premiere, the cast of the UK version of the series are kept a secret until closer to the beginning of the series. The show, which is hosted by Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman, puts a group of players into a high-stakes game of betrayal and back-stabbing, pitting the majority of the players against a small secret group called the traitors, who are working to sabotage the game.</p>
<p>With a cast of civilians rather than reality TV personalities, The Traitors UK season 2 will host a larger, more intricate cast than the first season of the series. Players from all over the United Kingdom signed up for the chance to try their hand at the deceptive game, making it clear that The Traitors UK season 1 was a massive success for the BBC. With the premiere episodes available, the cast of the series has been revealed and the traitors have been selected. As the game begins, many are wondering about who the cast is and why they&rsquo;re playing.</p>

The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>A 45-year-old Insurance Broker from Talbot Green, Andrew is thrilled to be playing The Traitors UK after immersing himself in the series&rsquo; first season. According to BBC’s profile of Andrew, he feels he’d be able to succeed in the game as a traitor or a faithful. Andrew is most “looking forward to the missions. I mean, I&rsquo;m a competitive guy, I’m physically fit, I&rsquo;m good at solving puzzles and I&rsquo;m really excited about the challenges.” He hopes to use his skills at spotting liars during his time on the series.</p>
<p>Anthony
Chess Coach, 45
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>A Chess Coach from Birmingham, Anthony is hoping to bring his specific set of strategy skills to The Traitors UK season 2. As a fan of The Traitors franchise, Anthony has watched every iteration of the series he could find, including The Traitors US season 1 and simply enjoys the mechanics of the game. Going into the game, he has “a loose game plan, a very loose game plan,” and believes “If I get a tap on the shoulder [to become a traitor], then a big smile will appear from ear to ear, definitely. I will then need to control my breathing and remember that I need to control things!&quot;</p>
<p>Ash
Events Coordinator, 45
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>
<p>Ash is a 45-year-old Events Coordinator from London who was “looking for adventure” when applying to The Traitors UK season 2. She shared that with her poker face and natural instincts for sniffing out liars, she feels she’d make a great traitor. According to Ash, if she’s selected to be a traitor, “I&rsquo;m going to be quite happy. It&rsquo;s not about wanting to be deceitful and wanting to lie to people. To me, it&rsquo;s that I want to play this game and I want to win.”  She hopes her time in public-facing careers that require her to stay buttoned up in stressful moments will help her win the game.</p>
<p>Aubrey
Retired Shop Owner, 67
The Traitors UK Season 2 Cast</p>

You could be recruited at another point. What will be, will be!” While Aubrey may not get the chance to be a traitor, his goals were clear. “The goal is to win,” Aubrey shared, “That&rsquo;s my goal. I want to win.”</p>
