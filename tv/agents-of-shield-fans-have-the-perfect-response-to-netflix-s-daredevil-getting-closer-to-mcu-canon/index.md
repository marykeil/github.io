## Literature Review
Agents of SHIELD fans respond to Echo&#39;s acknowledgement of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil as potentially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.




Agents of SHIELD fans have taken to social media to share their varied reactions to the pre-Disney&#43; Netflix Daredevil show being potentially acknowledged as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s canon in the lead up to Echo&#39;s release. The ABC show spanned out of the events of 2012&#39;s The Avengers, following a surprisingly alive Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and his assembled SHIELD taskforce. Netflix&#39;s Daredevil kicked off a darker, street-level corner of the MCU at the time, as Matt Murdock&#39;s (Charlie Cox) war on crime introduced characters including Jessica Jones, The Punisher, and Luke Cage.




As Marvel&#39;s Echo ramps up promotion ahead of its January 9 release, fans of Agents of SHIELD have shared their thoughts as the recent Kingpin (Vincent D&#39;Onofrio) focused teaser acknowledged the events of Netflix&#39;s Daredevil.


 


 

@lord_anarchy and @castrogrim summarized how many AoS fans felt at seeing Daredevil&#39;s continued MCU ties.

And @Devonodom_ and @Jonathanmc8081 led calls for Agents of SHIELD receiving the acknowledgment it deserves.


 


 





 

@Jellymelly1217, @kylelivings92 and @icephoenix_98 highlighted how Agents of SHIELD and Daredevil&#39;s connections surely meant the former could be canon too.


 


 

However, @SmashTriviaJohn and @THE_PLAYER_ZE were hopeful that Daredevil&#39;s acknowledgement would only be the start of pre-Disney&#43; show&#39;s canonizations.





 Why Marvel Should Confirm Agents of SHIELD As Part Of The MCU Canon 
          

While the MCU has continued to expand and bring the casts of the Netflix series into the core continuity, Agents of SHIELD has been decanonized via the Marvel Studios The Marvel Cinematic Universe An Official Timeline book by not acknowledging Coulson&#39;s post-Avengers adventures. For many, this has caused much confusion, as earlier seasons were direct tie-ins to the events of the MCU&#39;s first few phases, as Coulson&#39;s team cleaned up London in the wake of Thor: The Dark World, were torn apart by Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#39;s HYDRA schism, and provided support for the Avengers in Age of Ultron. As such, Agents of SHIELD had some of the strongest connections to the MCU of any pre-Disney&#43; television project.

                  10 Things Agents Of SHIELD Did Way Before The MCU   In seven seasons of Agents of SHIELD, the Marvel Television series featured several storylines that would later be included in the MCU proper.    




Furthermore, while later seasons would become less tied into the developing MCU save for a few mentions of events, Agents of SHIELD is still responsible for introducing many well-recieved concepts to the MCU. Gabriel Luna&#39;s Robbie Reyes Ghost Rider, the origins of SHIELD, and a more positively received adaptation of the Inhumans helped the MCU expand outside of the confines of the heroes&#39; theatrical adventures, building up the universe and giving it a richer landscape. While Disney&#43; shows would create contradictions, including the Darkhold, the sudden decanonization of the ABC show has left the MCU feeling smaller and unexplored.

As seen by fan responses, Agents of SHIELD still holds a special place in many Marvel fans&#39; hearts. As such, it is understandable why a large portion of the audience feel confused by Netflix&#39;s shows being held higher in their connections to the MCU. While Kevin Feige has hinted how it could be tied into the MCU in the future, it is clear that many feel the series deserves better.






Marvel&#39;s Agents of SHIELD and Daredevil are both available to stream on Disney&#43;.
