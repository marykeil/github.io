## Literature Review
The Real Housewives of New York City remains popular, and these are the seasons with the most dramatic and compelling episodes.




The Real Housewives of New York City season 14 aired in 2023, but many great seasons of the hit Bravo TV series exist. The latest season featured Brynn Whitfield, Jessel Taank, Lizzy Savetsky, Erin Dana Lichy, Ubah Hassan, Sai De Silva, and Jenna Lyons. When looking back on the reality show, each season has offered something different, from a new housewife, a big fight that had an impact years later, or a major surprising storyline. The best seasons of RHONY include Bethenny Frankel as she&#39;s a popular cast member, but even the seasons without this reality star have some stand-out and shocking scenes.
When fans look back on the best season of RHONY, many are contenders, including the iconic moment when Bethenny shared big news and the friendship that ended in season 10. RHONY has garnered renewed attention as famous former cast members appear in Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip season 4. As fans enjoy RHUGT and await the upcoming potential RHONY season 15, it&#39;s time to revisit the best seasons of the iconic show.









 








 10  RHONY Season 7 
Dorinda And Carole&#39;s Sweet Friendship


 







        


 The Real Housewives of New York City 

 Release Date   March 4, 2008    Genres   Reality TV    Seasons   14    Streaming Service(s)   Peacock    




Dorinda Medley and Carole Radizwill are two former RHONY cast members who fans still think about, and their connection made season 7 one to watch. In the episode &#34;London Calling,&#34; the co-stars went to England, so Carole could get her late husband Anthony&#39;s ashes. It was heartbreaking to see both Dorinda and Carole continue to grieve their partners who passed away tragically, but it was sweet that they were able to talk to each other about it. Besides the friendship that developed between these two, this isn&#39;t the most stand-out season, but it&#39;s still one of the better ones. It also deserves a mention since this is the season when Bethenny Frankel returned and discussed how she was suffering amid her divorce.





 9  RHONY Season 12 
Smart, Independent Leah Is Introduced


 







Leah McSweeney joined RHONY in season 12, which makes it one of the more interesting ones as she is so unique. Leah and Tinsley Mortimer are close friends, and it was also great watching Leah as a single mother to her daughter Kier.
While RHONY vacations are often fun to watch, the Cancun trip in season 12 was incredibly stressful as Leah and Ramona Singer didn&#39;t get along. Sonja Morgan also drank a lot, which was worrisome and became a topic of discussion in season 13, as the situation didn&#39;t get any better. Season 12 isn&#39;t the most fun group of episodes to look back on, but it was still good getting to know Leah.





 8  RHONY Season 4 
A Morocco Vacation Is Memorable
        

 The trip to Morocco made this season a juicy one. In the episode &#34;Last Call, Morocco,&#34; Jill Zarin was very upset about fighting with Ramona, and it was a reasonably confusing but still entertaining argument. Jill seemed to think that the end of her friendship with Bethenny was because of Ramona. And rightly so, Ramona didn&#39;t want to be attacked, as this was a friendship that naturally ran its course. This season serves as a good reminder of the old cast of the show, as it was always fun watching Jill and Ramona together, even if they were fighting or upset with each other. Viewers might like re-watching this season as a trip down memory lane, but it&#39;s not as memorable as some later seasons.





 7  RHONY Season 2 
Alex And Simon Go Shopping


 







Of the Real Housewives who left early, Alex McCord will always be remembered for the shopping trip she and her husband Simon Van Kempen went on in the season 2 episode &#34;Hamptons Retreat... But No Surrender.&#34; This scene is never forgotten as they dropped thousands of dollars for some clothing. While RHONY is known for dramatic moments that usually can&#39;t be predicted ahead of time, the show also shines when it talks about the lifestyles the cast lives, and season 2 Alex is a flawless example of this.





 6  RHONY Season 11 
Luann Is Upset About The Fish Room
        

While Bethenny didn&#39;t have the happiest time in season 11, it&#39;s an important season for her overall Real Housewives story. Bethenny talked about the death of her partner, Dennis Shields, which was a sad beginning to the season. Season 11 might not have featured entertaining arguments or fun moments, but the episode &#34;Sleeping With The Fishes&#34; stood out when the cast wanted to avoid staying in this bedroom in Dorinda&#39;s Berkshires house. In the stand-out storyline of the season, Luann was offended that she would be put there, and Dorinda got mad and emotional, too. This bedroom is famous among RHONY fans, and it&#39;s all thanks to this season.





 5  RHONY Season 9 
Tinsley Joins The Series
        

The introduction of Tinsley is what makes season 9 a superb one. There are many facts about Tinsley Mortimer&#39;s background, and her socialite days immediately became part of her storyline. Seeing Tinsley move to New York and live with Sonja, who often said she was a lousy houseguest, was fun and intriguing, creating some much-needed drama. This season gave fans everything that they wanted to see, including bad blood between Ramona and Bethenny, as Ramona offended Bethenny by talking about a movie role Bethenny had taken on decades before.





 4  RHONY Season 5 
Aviva Famously Throws Her Leg
        

Between Aviva Drescher throwing her prosthetic leg across the room and saying that she couldn&#39;t go on a trip because of her health, it&#39;s no wonder that people still remember season 5. It might even be possible to see this season as a little too intense and wild, so a few others are more enjoyable to re-watch. Aviva struggled to get along with the cast, and not everyone liked watching her as she could be pretty mean-spirited, especially when she said Carole had a ghostwriter. This is also a great season for fans of Heather Thompson, who was always courageous in saying what she felt and tried to help Sonja with her toaster ovens.





 3  RHONY Season 10 
Bethenny And Carole&#39;s Friendship Is In A Tough Spot
        

 Bethenny&#39;s season 10 arguments on RHONY included some with Carole, and since this is known as the season when they stopped being in each other&#39;s lives for good, fans will always consider it important. No matter how often the cast members tried to solve their problems, they couldn&#39;t. Every time Carole and Bethenny spoke to each other in season 10, they seemed so upset and angry that fans almost wished they would stop filming scenes together. Since this season also included a fight between Sonja and Dorinda because Dorinda thought Sonja talked too much about her divorce, which happened years earlier, it&#39;ll always be a favorite among RHONY viewers.





 2  RHONY Season 3 
The Famous Scary Island Showdown
        

 RHONY Season 3 can&#39;t be ignored, as the episode &#34;Sun, Sand and Psychosis,&#34; known as &#34;Scary Island,&#34; was part of this group of episodes. Viewers still re-watch the scenes of Bethenny and Kelly Bensimon yelling at each other, and it seems like this dinner will never seem logical as Kelly speaks about very random things, including jelly beans. This season of RHONY also saw Jill and Bethenny fighting so much that they decided it was better to go their separate ways. It&#39;s interesting to note Bethenny lost two close friendships in the series, and this one hurt, as Bethenny was becoming successful in business, and it seemed like Jill didn&#39;t lend her support.





 1  RHONY Season 8 
Bethenny Has Bad News For Luann
        

As for the ultimate RHONY season, one that provided non-stop drama and lots of emotion, season 8 is definitely up there. The episode &#34;Tomfoolery&#34; is the most beloved as Bethenny finally said what viewers had been thinking about Luann De Lesseps&#39;s fiance, Tom: he was a super unhealthy partner. When Bethenny told Luann she had photos of Tom kissing another woman, this solidified RHONY season 8 as incredibly fascinating. There was curiosity about whether Luann would go through the wedding, and everyone knew the real drama was just beginning.
