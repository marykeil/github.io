## Literature Review
Jenelle Evans from Teen Mom has been going through a lot lately with her son Jace Evans. He fleed Grandma Barbara Evans&#39; custody again.




Jenelle Evans, a Teen Mom personality, faced another upheaval in her family dynamics as her son, 14-year-old Jace, ran away from his grandmother Barbara Evans&#39; custody, marking the fourth instance of this occurrence. This incident follows a series of alarming events where Jace allegedly faced physical assaults purportedly inflicted by Jenelle&#39;s husband, David Eason, prompting previous runaway situations. The gravity of these circumstances escalated further due to a recent investigation by Child Protective Services (CPS) into allegations of child neglect involving Jenelle and David. As a result, Barbara regained custody of Jace, but this ongoing saga has most individuals concerned for Jenelle&#39;s three children.




Following a turbulent custody journey, Jenelle established victory in March 2023 when she finally gained guardianship of Jace. However, her bliss was short-lived, as five months later, Jace fled multiple times, totaling three runaway incidents. Jace&#39;s most recent departure prompted authorities to remove him from Jenelle and David&#39;s care, resulting in a mental health evaluation at a hospital. Allegations surfaced, with Jace citing abuse by David, leading to a CPS investigation. While temporarily placed with his grandmother, a decision on permanent custody remains pending after Jace went missing this week from Barbara&#39;s care and went back to the hospital for another mental evaluation.

According to an initial report by The Ashley&#39;s Reality Roundup, on November 17, 2023, Jace, who had been residing with Grandma Barbara for about a month, ran away. The living situation seemed constructive, but tensions escalated in the final week. Jace remained missing for nearly 48 hours until his discovery on Sunday. During his absence, Jenelle and David, respectively, posted celebratory content on social media, taunting Barbara. CPS had notified Jenelle of Jace&#39;s runaway status, indicating her awareness of the situation when she and David posted their messages. Jace&#39;s permanent residence is uncertain, but he won&#39;t return to Jenelle&#39;s or Barbara&#39;s home for now.

The relationship between Barbara and Jenelle has been nothing but toxic and continual conflicts. A recently leaked voice recording on social media captured Barbara expressing frustration, labeling Jenelle as an inadequate mother, and accusing her of prioritizing herself over her children. In response, Jenelle posted on Facebook, alleging exploitation by Barbara for financial gain, criticizing her for neglecting to inquire about Jenelle&#39;s role as a mother. This public exchange signifies their ongoing cycle of hostility and unresolved issues. Their dispute, filled with accusations and personal attacks, highlights the deep-seated discord and lack of understanding between the two, reflecting their inability to find common ground or mend their fractured relationship.






 Child Protective Services Orders Jenelle to Complete Therapy and Drug Testing 
          

Teen Mom alum Jenelle faces directives from CPS mandating intensive therapy and drug tests following the loss of custody of her son, Jace, according to The U.S. Sun. An unnamed insider revealed her obligation to undertake prolonged, extensive therapy after this custody setback, distinct from previous CPS involvements. Jenelle&#39;s forced therapy commitment lasted several months and should continue, but the frequency of her drug testing and David&#39;s involvement are currently unknown. Jenelle has previously mentioned Jace&#39;s mental health issues, implying this is a component of the scenario. However, with three young children involved, people are inclined to see what happens next as the story unfolds and CPS&#39; participation deepens.
