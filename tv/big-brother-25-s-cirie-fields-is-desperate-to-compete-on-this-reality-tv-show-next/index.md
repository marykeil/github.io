## Literature Review
Reality TV legend Cirie Fields was on Survivor and Big Brother, and won Snake in the Grass and The Traitors season 1, but she&#39;s not done competing.




Big Brother season 25 houseguest, Snake in the Grass co-winner, The Traitors season 1 winner, and four-time Survivor player and legend Cirie Fields is a reality television icon, but she still has aspirations to compete on another show with her son and fellow Big Brother 25 contestant Jared Fields. Cirie and Jared joined Big Brother season 25 as one of the biggest twists, when they secretly played alongside each other and mother and son. Jared placed 11th and Cirie came in 5th, but they were able to keep their secret from everyone but Izzy Gleicher, who immediately recognized Jared, and Blue Kim, Jared&#39;s showmance, in whom he confided.




In an interview with Variety&#39;s Kate Arthur during Variety Women of Reality Presented by DirectTV at Spago on November 29, 2023, in Beverly Hills, California (shared via Twitter), Cirie revealed that she wants her next reality television venture to be The Amazing Race. 


 

Cirie explained that she&#39;d like to compete on The Amazing Race with Jared, saying, &#34;I did Big Brother season 25 with him...to have a possibility of running The Amazing Race with him is what my heart&#39;s desire is.&#34; Cirie joked that she has to &#34;make some phone calls.&#34;


 Cirie &amp; Jared Fields&#39; Big Brother 25 Gameplay Explained 
          




On Big Brother 25, Cirie and Jared were fierce competitors, but they played the game very differently. Cirie made it to 5th place without winning any competitions because she had an outstanding social game. She was able to manipulate her fellow houseguests with her charming personality, and strategize to get them to do her bidding. On the other hand, Jared won three competitions, including two Head of Household (HOH) and one Power of Veto games, in the 58 days that he was in the house. They could bring together their physical and mental strengths to create a winning Amazing Race team.

Several other former houseguests have competed on The Amazing Race. Big Brother season 4 runner-up Alison Irwin once was a contestant on the show with her then-boyfriend Donny Patrick. Couples Jeff Schroeder and Jordan Lloyd, Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo, and Rachel Reilly and Brendon Villegas have also competed. Rachel and Brendon even returned to The Amazing Race for an all-stars season. Rachel also competed in another season with her sister and fellow Big Brother alum Elissa Slater. Friends Janelle Pierzina and Britney Haynes participated as well. Couples Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf as well as Derek Xiao and Claire Rehfuss have both won The Amazing Race.




Cirie is a master at reality television shows, and it&#39;s always a delight to watch her compete. Cirie and Jared have already proven that they&#39;d be a great team, as they have mutual respect and trust. They showed that they were easily able to overcome any conflicts when they were on Big Brother season 25, and they played off of each other&#39;s strengths and were strong competitors. They were fiercely protective of each other, which was very difficult because they had to keep their relationship a secret. It would be incredible to see them compete together out in the open as mother and son on The Amazing Race.

The Amazing Race airs Wednesdays at 9:30pm EST on CBS.
