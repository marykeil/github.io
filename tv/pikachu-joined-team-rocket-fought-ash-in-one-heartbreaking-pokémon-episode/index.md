## Literature Review
Ash and Pikachu&#39;s friendship is a staple of the Pokémon series, and a heartbreaking episode nearly broke them up when Pikachu joined Team Rocket.




In one of Pokémon&#39;s most heartbreaking episodes, Pikachu actually joined Team Rocket and fought Ash himself. The friendship between Pikachu and Ash Ketchum has been at the forefront of Pokémon&#39;s overarching story for decades. In fact, it was only recently that the series went in an entirely new direction after retiring Ash following his victory as Pokémon World Champion. However, this doesn&#39;t mean the two always got along as evidenced in one episode that nearly saw the pair split forever.




In the season 7 episode &#34;A Scare to Remember,&#34; Pikachu, his friends, and Team Rocket get launched into the air following a kidnapping plot from the latter gone wrong. After the dust has settled, Meowth realizes that he&#39;s alone with Pikachu. However, to his surprise, Pikachu has amnesia following a bump on the head he got when landing. Meowth then comes up with a sinister plot to fool Pikachu into believing he&#39;s a part of Team Rocket, and he actually manages to be successful when Ash and his friends find them.

          

Due to Meowth&#39;s false information, Pikachu actually attacks Ash twice with Thunderbolt in one of the most heartbreaking moments of the show. The bond between these two has become iconic to fans, so seeing them fight as Pikachu joins Team Rocket&#39;s side is difficult to watch.





 Ash Nearly Died Trying to Save Pikachu 
Pokémon: Advanced Challenge episode #49, &#34;A Scare to Remember&#34;
          

What&#39;s truly remarkable about this episode is how dedicated Ash is to restoring Pikachu&#39;s memory. He not only takes two powerful Thunderbolt hits from his friend, but also risks his life by grabbing Team Rocket&#39;s balloon to make sure he doesn&#39;t lose Pikachu. This results in the two flying into a river, nearly killing Ash and Pikachu, following James&#39; inadvertent attempt to shake Ash off with another Thunderbolt attack. It&#39;s absolutely touching to see Ash never let go of Pikachu, even after everything that has transpired throughout the episode, knowing that his friend is in there somewhere. It makes the final moments of the story even better when Pikachu&#39;s memories finally come back and he licks Ash&#39;s cheek to make sure he&#39;s okay.






 Meowth&#39;s Internal Conflict Shows Interesting Character Progress 
          

One of the other highlights from &#34;A Scare to Remember&#34; is how Pikachu&#39;s bout with amnesia actually impacted Meowth as well as Ash. Throughout the story, Meowth is confident that he&#39;s doing the right thing for Team Rocket as he brings Pikachu to their base. However, as Pikachu&#39;s kindhearted nature saves him countless times, there are points where Meowth actually begins to question his actions. He becomes more hesitant about whether he&#39;s a good person as he guides the oblivious Pikachu. He even manages to share an apple, giving him the biggest piece, after realizing Pikachu gave up his only source of food to help. Meowth still stays with Team Rocket by the end, but it&#39;s interesting to see how he could become a hero rather than a villain at any point.




                  Pokémon&#39;s Meowth Once Abandoned Team Rocket to Join Ash   An arc in the Black and White era saw Meowth leave Team Rocket and travel with Ash and Pikachu, and they made a surprisingly good team together.    

While Pikachu thankfully regained his memory and became friends with Ash again by the end of the episode, &#34;A Scare to Remember&#34; is still one of the most heartbreaking stories in Pokémon history. It provides a fascinating &#34;What If&#34; scenario that shows what the show could have been, had Pikachu been a part of Team Rocket rather than by Ash&#39;s side. While it gives Pokémon fans plenty of moments that show that Ash and Pikachu will never let their friendship diminish, the latter&#39;s brief team-up with Team Rocket will forever be one of the show&#39;s saddest moments.
