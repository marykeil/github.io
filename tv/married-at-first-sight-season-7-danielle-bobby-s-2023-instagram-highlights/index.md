Danielle and Bobby Dodd are among the most compatible couples to be matched on Married At First Sight, and with the duo doing better than ever since they met on MAFS season 7, here are some of their best Instagram highlights from 2023. MAFS season 7, aired in 2018, introduced viewers to three couples from the Dallas area: Danielle and Bobby, Mia Bally and Tristan Thompson, and Amber Martorana and Dave Flaherty. Although the other two MAFS season 7 couples struggled to be together and separated by the end of 2018, Danielle and Bobby were immediate fan favorites commended for their rock-solid communication skills.

With MAFS as one of the best reality TV shows, plenty of followers keep up with Danielle and Bobby.

 Danielle And Bobby Celebrated Five Years Of Marriage 

 

Danielle and Bobby celebrated a whopping five years of marriage in March 2023, a huge success as there aren&#39;t many MAFS couples still together. In a lengthy caption, Danielle detailed, &#34;We are celebrating FIVE years of marriage TODAY! I can’t even believe it looking back through all of these photos it blows my mind everything we have been through together! We have such a strong foundation set that I have no doubt we will be celebrating 10, 20 and 50 years one day!...There is no one else I would rather experience all of these things with than you babe! I can’t even believe the things we have accomplished in just five years!&#34;

In five years, Danielle and Bobby have created a beautiful life. They now have three children together: Olivia, who was born in February 2019; Robert &#34;Bobby&#34; Dodd IV, who was born in December 2020; and Savannah, who was born in September 2023. Danielle frequently shares photos of her husband and children on Instagram.






 Danielle Celebrated Bobby On Father&#39;s Day 

 

Danielle and Bobby&#39;s marriage is a testament to MAFS&#39; ability to work under the right circumstances. The two were dedicated to making the experiment work, and the spark between them was strong enough to build a foundation. In June 2023, Danielle posted a tribute to Bobby&#39;s fierce commitment to fatherhood and marriage on her Instagram. While she was still pregnant with Savannah, Olivia and Bobby IV were seen smiling in the photo.

Danielle captioned, &#34;Happy Fathers Day to our #1 daddy. You’ve grown into this role in a way I never could have imagined. I know how tough it is on you to be away as often as you are but the effort you make to be present with the kids and make all of the seemingly ordinary moments extra special for the kids in a way I could never do is amazing. They will truly grow up thinking their daddy is their superhero and in just a few short months you have another one you get to be a superhero for. Thank you for all you do for our family and for our kids.&#34;




Danielle and Bobby had a great ride on MAFS season 7, and if Danielle&#39;s Instagram is anything to go by, the couple is doing even better than they were before. With a new baby and heartfelt appreciation for each other and their marriage, it&#39;s clear this couple was meant to be. Although many couples on MAFS fall apart, Danielle and Bobby had what it took to go the distance and grow a successful Married At First Sight marriage.
