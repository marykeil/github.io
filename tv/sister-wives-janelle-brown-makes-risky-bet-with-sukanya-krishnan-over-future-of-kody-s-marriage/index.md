## Literature Review
Sister Wives cast member Janelle Brown could lose $1,000 if her intuition about her ex-husband Kody Brown&#39;s future turns out to be wrong.




Janelle Brown making a bet with Sukanya Krishnan about the future of Kody Brown&#39;s marriage to Robin Brown might prove to be a risky affair for the Sister Wives star. Kody legally and spiritually married his first wife Meri Brown in April 1990. Kody and Janelle had first met in 1989, and she described it as a &#34;singular experience.&#34; Janelle&#39;s first husband, Adam Clark Barber, was the brother of Kody’s first wife, Meri. Janelle had attended Kody and Meri&#39;s wedding. In 1993, Janelle became spiritually married to Kody in 1993, and he added two more wives after her, with Robyn Brown being the last in 2010.




According to a preview of the Sunday, December 17, 2023, episode of the Sister Wives season 18 One-on-One, shared by Us Weekly, Janelle is certain that Robyn will be Kody&#39;s last-ever wife as he ends his tryst with polygamy. &#34;He’s now talking more and more about ‘as we move forward into monogamy’ [with Robyn],” Janelle says in the clip. Janelle suspects Kody is now headed to monogamy. She doesn&#39;t see him ever getting married to another woman after Robyn, even if she herself introduces a new woman to Kody. &#34;I&#39;ll bet you $1,000 right now,” Janelle tells the One-on-One host. Janelle tells her that if Kody does get married again, she will give Sukanya $1,000.


 Will Kody Stay In Monogamous Marriage With Robyn? 
          

&#34;Because I just don’t think it’ll ever happen,&#34; Janelle says confidently. As per Janelle, Kody and Robyn are &#34;very happy&#34; in each other&#39;s presence, just by themselves. &#34;They have found something together at this stage of their life that seems to be very deep,” she believes. Janelle thinks that &#34;works&#34; and that it is &#34;okay.&#34; Janelle and Kody confirmed the news of their separation in December 2022 in a Sister Wives episode. She decided to move out of her rental home in Arizona and live on the Coyote Pass compound in an RV in 2021 when her marriage with Kody hit a rough patch.





 

Janelle felt like she had to choose between her kids and her husband as Kody started making the family follow strict rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Janelle thought it was easy for her to walk away from Kody instead of staying in a strained relationship. Meanwhile, Kody&#39;s favoritism towards Robyn was easy to see. He preferred Robyn over his other three wives, but he kept denying it. Kody didn&#39;t just want a new wife when he married her; he had genuine feelings for her. Robyn is not only Kody&#39;s last remaining wife but also the most important part of his life.

His other wives&#39; feelings and grievances didn&#39;t matter to Kody, who went on a honeymoon with Robyn and gave her all his attention, while the other women grew frustrated on Sister Wives. Then there&#39;s Robyn, who also refuses to admit that she&#39;s Kody&#39;s favorite and seemingly the main reason behind all of Kody&#39;s failed marriages. While Janelle&#39;s bet is risky, there&#39;s a low chance that she will lose her $1,000 bet to Sukanya in the future.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
