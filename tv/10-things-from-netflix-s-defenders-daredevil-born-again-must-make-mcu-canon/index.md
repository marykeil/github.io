# 10 Things From Netflix s Defenders Daredevil Born Again Must Make MCU Canon


## SUMMARY 


 The relationships and history of Daredevil with characters like Elektra and Bullseye should be made canon in the MCU to maintain the hero&#39;s backstory and add compelling villains. 
 The gang war in Hell&#39;s Kitchen, as depicted in Daredevil season 2, should be considered official MCU canon to deepen the character development of Daredevil and showcase the gritty side of the franchise. 
 Keeping the street-level heroes, like Luke Cage and Iron Fist, in the MCU and exploring their friendship could lead to an exciting Heroes for Hire series and expand the scope of the franchise&#39;s storytelling.

## Literature Review

As the MCU&#39;s Daredevil: Born Again will pick up from Netflix&#39;s series, there are several elements of the Defenders shows that should be MCU canon.




With Daredevil: Born Again set to follow on from the hero&#39;s beloved Netflix series, there are several elements of The Defenders that deserve to be made MCU canon. At the same time that the movies of the MCU were consistently dominating the box office, Netflix was creating the most beloved adaptation of Daredevil to date. The series served as the beginning of the Netflix-produced Defenders Saga, featuring Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and Daredevil as they formed a team to protect New York from the villainous organization known as the Hand.
With Disney&#43;&#39;s upcoming Daredevil: Born Again bringing Netflix characters and stories into the MCU, there remains a question of exactly which elements of Netflix’s Defenders shows will be officially made canon. It has been confirmed that the show will follow on from the Netflix series, but not whether all elements of the shows will be considered a true part of the MCU’s continuity. Considering their lasting popularity and widespread success, there are many elements of the Defenders Saga that could be beneficial to the MCU. Here are 10 things from Netflix’s Defenders shows that should be made MCU canon.
            
 
 All Netflix Marvel TV Shows, Ranked Worst To Best 
The Defenders have started appearing in the MCU, promising fresh relevance for the Netflix shows. Here&#39;s their ranking from worst to best.












 








 10  Daredevil &amp; Elektra’s History Gives The Hero A Solid Backstory 
Daredevil&#39;s Romantic Past Is An Important Part Of The Hero
        

One of the key additions to the cast of Daredevil season 2 was Elektra Natchios, a former flame of Matt Murdock’s who also happened to factor into the Hand’s plans. Daredevil’s relationship with Elektra was one that threatened his hero status, as she drew him down a potentially dark path, but it also formed a key part of his ongoing struggle. As Elektra doesn’t feature in the comic the series is named for, she’s unlikely to be included in Daredevil: Born Again’s cast, but making her relationship with Daredevil MCU canon would keep the hero’s backstory intact.





 9  The Bloody History Of Hell’s Kitchen 
Daredevil Season 2&#39;s Gang War Is A Key Part Of His Character Development
        

Though it may have been a more direct part of Punisher’s story in Daredevil season 2, the gang war that ravaged Hell’s Kitchen should be made MCU canon for Daredevil’s benefit, too. The extreme violence rocked the neighborhood and forced Daredevil into action against the Punisher. The nature of the conflict highlighted the contrast between the Punisher and Daredevil, subtly becoming a defining moment for the titular hero. Though the MCU might shy away from anything as bloody in the future, making the bloody past of Hell’s Kitchen canon is important for Daredevil’s character.





 8  Bullseye Is An Excellent Daredevil Villain Who Should Be Part Of The MCU 
Bullseye Would Precisely Fit The MCU&#39;s Tone
        

Daredevil season 3 introduced Bullseye, a highly-trained FBI agent with an uncanny knack for marksmanship. The villain, also known as Benjamin “Dex” Poindexter, acted on the Kingpin’s behalf to incriminate Daredevil but masquerading as the hero and performing acts of wanton violence, and he proved to be a formidable adversary for Matt Murdock’s alter-ego. Bullseye perfectly fits the bill for the MCU and would make a superbly sinister addition to the franchise’s list of villains. Bullseye’s quirky gimmick, combined with his chillingly evil demeanor, was excellently written and would be a wise addition to the MCU’s canon.





 7  Daredevil &amp; Punisher’s Past May Be Important For Future MCU Stories 
The Complex Dynamic Between The Pair Would Be Interesting In The MCU


 







One of the key stories in Daredevil season 2 saw the titular hero at odds with Jon Bernthal’s Punisher, who waged a private war on the gangs of Hell’s Kitchen. The hero and the anti-hero shared a curious connection, albeit one marred by their differing approaches to fighting crime, with each proving an important figure in the character development of the other. As such, keeping Daredevil and Punisher’s history and connection canon in the MCU would be the most sensible way to bring both characters back for Daredevil: Born Again, as it was an important part of their Netflix story.





 6  Colleen Wing Was The Best Part Of Iron Fist 
Jessica Henwick&#39;s Colleen Wing Demands Further Exploration
        

Of all the supporting characters in Iron Fist’s cast, few stood out as clearly as Colleen Wing. Her supporting role in the Defenders Saga was hugely important in relation to Danny Rand, but she also proved to be one of the best elements of Iron Fist. Though the titular hero himself received mixed reactions, Jessica Henwick’s performance as Wing was widely considered a highlight, and her role within the story and general characterization made for a fascinating figure. Making Colleen Wing’s Defenders story MCU canon would allow for Henwick’s well-deserved return to the role, as she’s perfect for the franchise.





 5  Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist’s Friendship Could Be Valuable To The MCU 
Heroes For Hire Is The Perfect Tone For The MCU&#39;s Future


 







The Defenders Saga introduced multiple key Marvel characters and relationships, but few were as promising as that of Luke Cage and Iron Fist. The pair’s crimefighting team, Heroes for Hire, has long been considered one of the MCU’s best street-level pairings, and the chemistry between Finn Jones’ Danny Rand and Mike Colter’s Luke Cage was something that the MCU could revive. Making the pair’s alliance MCU canon would make room for an MCU Heroes for Hire series, which could be crucial to expanding the scope of the franchise’s story.





 4  The MCU Needs Turk Barrett 
The Defenders Saga Delivered The Perfect Barrett
        

Turk Barrett might not have been the most important supporting character in Netflix’s Defenders Saga, but he certainly deserves to be made canon in the MCU. Rob Morgan’s casting and performance as Barrett was one of the most consistently humorous elements of the Defenders shows, and Barrett’s role within Marvel Comics makes him a potentially important character for the MCU’s future. Regardless, Morgan’s spot-on Barrett perfectly brings the character to life, and he thoroughly deserves to make the cut as part of Daredevil: Born Again’s cast.





 3  The Hand Is Perfect For The MCU 
A Shadowy Organization Gives Marvel&#39;s Street-Level Heroes Something To Contend With
        

It’s not just The Defenders’ heroes that would fit well within the MCU, but also its villains. The Hand served as a key antagonistic factor in the stories of all heroes, but most especially Daredevil and Iron Fist, who were trained to directly oppose them. The powerful and shadowy organization would provide a consistent foe for the MCU’s street-level heroes, and their connection to Kingpin and other Marvel characters would help them to remain a part of the affairs of the wider MCU, meaning that the Hand should also be made canon for Born Again.





 2  The Defenders Saga’s Brutally Violent Fight Scenes Were A Key Part Of Its Success 
More Mature Marvel Stories Still Have A Place In The MCU
        

Perhaps one of the most popular elements of Netflix’s Defenders shows was their willingness to embrace the brutality of their heroes as well as their villains. The bloody violence of Daredevil, in particular, was something that earned the respect of audiences, as it examined a different angle of the superhero stories made popular by the MCU. Making that level of violence canon and bringing some element of it into the MCU would allow for the franchise to fully capitalize on the Defenders Saga’s success, potentially ushering in a new era of more mature MCU offerings.





 1  The Defenders’ Street-Level Set-Up Could Show A New Side Of The MCU 
Smaller-Scale Narratives Would Help The MCU&#39;s Overall Tone


 







Bringing the heroes of Netflix’s Defenders Saga into the MCU is undoubtedly a popular choice, but making their shows canon and keeping their tone intact would be perfect for Marvel’s flagship franchise. Keeping the previously introduced street-level heroes in the MCU would help the franchise to better establish more grounded and tonally diverse stories, thereby broadening the potential appeal to audiences. Establishing the street-level heroes of The Defenders canon to the MCU would be a masterstroke from Daredevil: Born Again, as it would dispel some of the common criticisms about the franchise’s growing predictability.
