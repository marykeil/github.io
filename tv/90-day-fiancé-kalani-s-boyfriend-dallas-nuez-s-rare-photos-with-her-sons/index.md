## Literature Review
Kalani Faagata&#39;s relationship with Dallas Nuez is getting serious. Dallas has been sharing photos with the 90 Day: The Last Resort star&#39;s kids on IG.




90 Day: The Last Resort star Kalani Faagata has already introduced boyfriend Dallas Nuez to her sons Oliver and Kennedy. Kalani began dating Asuelu when they met in Samoa for the first time at a resort. She went back to Samoa to see him and decided she wanted to get pregnant. Kalani had already welcomed their son Oliver as she brought Asuelu to the U.S. on a K-1 visa. Asuelu and Kalani became pregnant again before their wedding in September 2018.




Kalani recently revealed that she had their second child because she was held down and allegedly sexually assaulted by Asuelu multiple times during their marriage. Kalani also claimed that Asuelu had been cheating on her all throughout their relationship, but she kept giving him chances every time he apologized. Kalani eventually had enough of Asuelu’s betrayal and started dating Dallas whom she met on social media. While undergoing couples therapy on 90 Day: The Last Resort season 1, Kalani decided she wanted to leave Asuelu and start a new life with someone who loved and respected her.

 Kalani &amp; Dallas&#39; Outing With Oliver &amp; Kennedy 

 

Kalani has been showing off her new boyfriend on Instagram even though she’s been teasing fans by hiding his face in photos. Dallas has made sure that even his profile picture on Instagram doesn’t reveal his face. Kalani has cropped him out of her own profile picture on Instagram. In November 2023, Kalani shared a photo (via @90dayfiancebreakingnews) with Dallas and her sons Oliver and Kennedy. The boys looked giddy as they were held by Kalani and Dallas for the photo. Kalani decided to hide her own face as well this time.






 How Dallas Has Replaced Asuelu In Kalani&#39;s Life 
          

Kalani first opened up about Dallas on 90 Day: The Last Resort during a conversation with Liz Woods. Liz noticed how Kalani was beaming when she spoke about Dallas. “He’s like the first guy I’ve ever dated that actually reciprocates what I do… like communications, feelings, doing things for each other,” Kalani told Liz. Kalani had known Dallas for two months by then, but she could already list reasons why he was better than Asuelu. Now that she and Asuelu were no longer together, she was ready for Dallas to literally enter the picture. Dallas shared a sweet photo with Kennedy snuggling with him with a cheerful smile.



 Is Kalani Getting Married To Dallas? 
          




Kalani hasn&#39;t confirmed if she’s divorced from Asuelu, legally. It may have been too early for Kalani to get into a relationship, as Dallas is now getting criticized for having an affair with a married woman. Nonetheless, Dallas and Kalani have crossed a major relationship milestone. Dallas recently reposted a selfie of them together where he told Kalani that he loves her. In November 2023, Dallas shared a video featuring Kennedy where Kalani could be heard saying, “Dallas said ‘I love you’” off camera as Kennedy moved towards the screen and sweetly said, “I love you, too,” before blowing a kiss to Dallas.

Dallas’ frequent videos and photos showing Kalani’s children confirm he’s very close to them and getting along with Kennedy and Oliver. Dallas is ready to step into the shoes of Asuelu as he replaces him in 90 Day: The Last Resort star Kalani’s life too. Dallas is yet to make his reality TV debut, but for now, he’s content with being the prince charming in Kalani’s new life chapter.
