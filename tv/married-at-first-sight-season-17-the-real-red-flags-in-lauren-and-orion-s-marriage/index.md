## Literature Review
Married At First Sight Season 17 couple Lauren and Orion have presented several red flags to viewers, signaling they may not be compatible. 




Married At First Sight season 17 viewers have gotten to know Lauren G and Orion Martzloff, and several red flags have presented themselves so far. Orion is Native American and is very prideful about his culture, but said he doesn&#39;t want his partner to treat him like an object because of his Indigenous heritage. He wants someone who will want to understand the importance of his culture to him and be a partner in everything. Lauren has never dated outside of her race but is deeply connected to her black culture. After meeting, each has said they feel empowered by getting to know one another&#39;s culture.




Lauren and Orion have already met at the altar, said their vows, and are officially married. They were instantly attracted, and each felt a calming presence about the other. The pair also had a sit-down grill sesh with their partner&#39;s family the day after the wedding before they took off on their honeymoon. All four couples have officially met each other and will be spending time supporting each other through the honeymoon and experience. However, it&#39;s looking like Lauren and Orion will need the most support because they have the most friction.


 Orion Isn&#39;t Considering Lauren In His Life Goals 
          

After tying the knot, Orion sat down with Lauren&#39;s father at the wedding and was asked some questions he gave suspect answers to. When asked how he saw his future, Orion said he didn&#39;t see himself having roots in Denver and wanted houses in different places. His response concerned Lauren&#39;s dad, who reminded Orion that he needed to make mutual decisions now that he was in a marriage. The fact that Orion&#39;s thought process did not take Lauren into consideration raised a red flag. He could have given a bad answer while on the spot, or he may not be ready for a partnership with mutual thought.






 Orion Doesn&#39;t Like Being Told What To Do 
          

Orion has said several times that he comes from a matriarchy and respects women. However, in that same talk with Lauren&#39;s dad, Orion showed resentment towards women running the show. When talking about his expectations and requirements for his partner in a marriage, Orion said mutual respect was the most important thing, but he did plug that he did not want to get &#34;bossed around.&#34; That attitude points to his immaturity and the idea that Lauren may be like the matriarchal women in his life that he feels have bossed him around.



 Orion Is Easily Offended 
Orion seems to have a short fuse when it comes to what he perceives as ignorance, especially about his heritage. While he is quick to explain things about his culture in a teaching manner, he can come off as condescending. If Lauren were to press him on something sensitive related to his heritage, Orion might take offense to it. Orion semi-jokingly called castmate Cameron Frazer ignorant when he accidentally used the word &#34;reservation&#34; incorrectly. Furthermore, a trailer for the next episode shows a &#34;heated&#34; Orion having a tense disagreement with Lauren.




At this point, it&#39;s unknown if their disagreement was over something related to Orion&#39;s Indigenous heritage or if it was something else. It&#39;s understandable that Orion has a connection with culture and wants to be respected, but he may have to lighten up if misunderstandings about his culture are already happening while Lauren is trying to get to know him better.



 Lauren Hooked Up With Someone Else 
Based on the trailer for Married at First Sight season 17, Lauren and Orion will have a tumultuous time over what seems like a hookup with someone else on Lauren&#39;s part. Orion will convey that he is uncomfortable with the fact that Lauren slept with another person. Lauren&#39;s infidelity, coupled with Orion&#39;s reaction to it, could be a major setback for the couple, who are just getting to know each other. Also in the trailer, Lauren expressed her remorse but said there was nothing more she could do, and in another scene, Orion said he was heartbroken.

At this point, the circumstances around Lauren&#39;s cheating are unclear. However, it will surely have a major impact on Orion and the pair&#39;s ability to trust and love one another. While Lauren&#39;s honesty is a good sign, the entire affair might be too much for Orion to get past. The duo does have the experts to lean on when their talks go South or hit a wall, but their help doesn&#39;t guarantee a good outcome.






 Lauren Doesn&#39;t Want Orion Being Stagnant In Life 
          

Lauren was confronted by Orion&#39;s living situation in how he lives with his mother. Admittedly a mama&#39;s boy, Orion seemed adamant that he was using his time at his mom&#39;s place well and had a good job and work trajectory. However, a main sticking point for Lauren is that Orion has actually used his time wisely and isn&#39;t fronting like he has. Lauren wants to ensure Orion isn&#39;t a scrub and can be independent. They will have issues if Orion hasn&#39;t been as proactive as he says.



 Lauren And Orion Have Diverse Sexualities 
          

During his initial interview, Orion was open about having masculine and feminine sides within him. He said he explored his sexuality with a man in the past and figured out that he was straight as a result. However, there may be lingering discoveries he needs to make. Lauren identifies as queer and has had relationships with men and women. Whether the two will be compatible, given their diverse sexualities, is up for question. They do appear to have chemistry, but it might not be enough for their relationship to succeed since they have other issues to overcome.




Lauren and Orion will be entertaining to watch on Married at First Sight season 17, which means that their marriage will come with its share of drama. Lauren and Orion&#39;s different orientations and cultures, mixed with their room for misunderstandings, means it&#39;s likely their tension will mount and boil over. Lauren&#39;s cheating scandal, Orion&#39;s sensitivities, and their mismatched ideals are working against them. While Lauren and Orion do have potential, since the experts carefully matched them, the mounting red flags are becoming ever more apparent.
