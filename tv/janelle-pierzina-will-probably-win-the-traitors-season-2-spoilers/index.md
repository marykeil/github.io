Summary

  Janelle Pierzina is proving herself to be a formidable competitor in The Traitors US season 2, with her gameplay and ability to win shields.   Despite being seen as selfish by some of the faithfuls, most of Janelle&#39;s fellow contestants don&#39;t suspect her of being a traitor.   Janelle&#39;s alliance with fellow Big Brother alum Dan Gheesling will likely protect her, as he needs her to navigate the game and maintain his cover as a traitor.  







The Traitors US season 2 contestant Janelle Pierzina might not be a traitor, but she&#39;s been slaying the game so far, proving that she has what it takes to win the $250,000 prize. Janelle is a Big Brother legend, who has played the game four times. She also won her episode of Snake in the Grass, sharing first place with Rachel Reilly and Cirie Fields. Through the years, Janelle has established herself as one of reality television&#39;s most beloved and greatest competitors.

In The Traitors US season 2, Janelle wasn&#39;t chosen to be a traitor, so she&#39;s a member of the faithfuls. So far, she&#39;s played the game in true Janelle fashion, finding shields in two of the missions, which granted her immunity. Although some of her fellow contestants see this as a selfish move, Janelle does what it takes to win. Here&#39;s why Janelle will most likely win The Traitors US season 2.

 The Faithfuls Think Janelle Pierzina Is Selfish, But Not A Traitor 

 

In The Traitors US, contestants must survive being murdered by the traitors and being banished by their fellow contestants during the round table discussions. Although Janelle&#39;s decision to protect herself with shields has earned her the reputation of being a selfish player, most of her fellow faithfuls don&#39;t seem to suspect that she&#39;s a traitor. In fact, Janelle has only received one vote in the three banishments so far, from Shereé Whitfield, who said that Janelle was either a traitor or a selfish faithful. In addition, Janelle does contribute greatly to the missions to add money to the prize pot, even when she earns shields. She&#39;s talented enough to do both.

Janelle&#39;s desire to keep herself safe should prove to her fellow contestants that she&#39;s not a traitor. Although traitor Dan Gheesling won a shield to throw the faithfuls off, the fact that Janelle&#39;s done it twice now should demonstrate that she&#39;s a faithful. The way that Janelle battled Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu for a shield during the graveyard mission was reminiscent of her Big Brother 7 OTEV win versus James Rhine, which also got physical. Someone who was safe because of being a traitor wouldn&#39;t put that much effort into getting a shield.




Shereé brought Janelle’s name up again at the end of episode 4 after the banishment, when she said that they should be focusing on the gamers, but it’s not likely to lead anywhere. Even if the faithfuls don&#39;t like Janelle&#39;s style of gameplay, they&#39;d be foolish to banish her because she&#39;s clearly not a traitor. Janelle is a faithful who simply wants to win.



 Janelle&#39;s Fellow Big Brother Alum &amp; Traitor Dan Gheesling Will Protect Her 
          

Janelle might not know it, but her fellow Big Brother alum Dan Gheesling is a traitor. At the beginning of The Traitors US season 2, they made a deal that they&#39;d look out for each other. Dan will most likely stick to his word, unless the entire group turns against Janelle and protecting her would expose his true identity as a traitor. Dan needs Janelle in the game to help him navigate the complicated relationships, especially since his quiet style of gameplay has already raised suspicions about him. Janelle is not expendable to him, which should keep her safe.




                  The Traitors US’ First Two Banishments Could Spell Trouble For One Of The Traitors (Spoilers)   The Traitors US season 2 has now had two banishments, and the next one could expose one of the traitors if they aren&#39;t careful about their strategy.   



 Janelle Will Figure Out Who The Traitors Are In The End 
          

Janelle is a very smart player, who will most likely be able to put the pieces together and figure out the traitors&#39; identities (Dan, Phaedra Parks, and Parvati Shallow). She won&#39;t be blinded by loyalty like The Traitors season 1 faithfuls Quentin Jiles and Andie Vanacore were when they allowed traitor Cirie Fields to take home the entire grand prize herself. In fact, Janelle might already suspect that Dan is a traitor, but has kept silent about it because she knows it benefits her to have him on her side. The odds are in Janelle&#39;s favor to figure out who the traitors are.






 Janelle Could Be Recruited As A Traitor 

 

It&#39;s also very possible that the remaining traitors could recruit Janelle as a replacement if one of them is banished before the end of the game. Dan considered choosing Janelle during the original recruitment, but he and Phaedra chose Parvati instead. If Janelle becomes a traitor, she&#39;ll have a great chance of winning The Traitors US season 2.

Janelle is an unstoppable force on The Traitors US season 2. She&#39;s a powerful physical threat who can keep herself safe by earning shields. She&#39;s also very intelligent, which will help her to uncover the traitors. If Janelle continues on this path, she&#39;ll win The Traitors US season 2.

The Traitors US season 2 is available to stream on Peacock.
