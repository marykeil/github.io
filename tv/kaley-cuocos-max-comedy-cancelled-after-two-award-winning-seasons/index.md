## Literature Review

The Flight Attendant season 3 is not happening at Max, confirming the Emmy-nominated dramedy has been axed, and Kaley Cuoco reacts in a statement.




The Flight Attendant season 3 is officially not happening at Max, as Kaley Cuoco&#39;s Emmy-nominated series has been canceled. Based on the novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian, with Steve Yockey as showrunner, the dramedy thriller premiered in November 2020 on Max. In season 1, the story followed Cassie Bowden (Cuoco) as the titular flight attendant who wakes up in a Bangkok hotel room next to the dead body of a man she’d slept with the night before. The adaptation was an awards favorite, with Cuoco receiving both Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance.




Variety confirms that The Flight Attendant season 3 is not happening, with the update coming over a year after the end of season 2. In a statement, Cuoco reflected on her time as Cassie Bowden and expressed gratitude for being able to bring the novel to life. The star and executive producer also praised the previous two seasons. Read her statement below: 


“What started out as an attention-grabbing book cover quickly evolved into an extraordinary flight of a lifetime. I always envisioned TFA as a limited series and thanks to an incredible creative team, we were able to deliver two thrilling seasons. Personally, playing Cassie has been a dream come true and I am so grateful for everyone who played a part in bringing this extremely original series to life.”
