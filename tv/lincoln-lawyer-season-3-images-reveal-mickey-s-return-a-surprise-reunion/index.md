# Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 Images Reveal Mickey s Return &amp; A Surprise Reunion


## SUMMARY 



  The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 images show Mickey&#39;s return and a surprising reunion with ex-wife Maggie, contradicting earlier reports of her departure from the show.   The flashback scenes featuring a young Mickey after surfing and cuddling on the couch with Maggie serve as an emotional introduction to his character in the upcoming season.   While Maggie&#39;s return is unexpected, it is likely limited to flashback sequences, as the present-day storyline follows the events of Michael Connelly&#39;s novel, The Gods of Guilt.

## Literature Review

The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 images reveal Mickey Haller&#39;s return and a surprise reunion with a character who was reportedly leaving the show.




The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 images reveal Mickey&#39;s return and a surprise reunion. Based on the bestselling books by Michael Connelly, the Netflix legal drama follows the defense attorney Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) who runs his Los Angeles law practice out of the back of his titular town car. The Lincoln Lawyer cast also includes Becki Newton, Jazz Raycole, Angus Sampson, Yaya DaCosta, Elliott Gould, Krista Warner, Fiona Rene, and Devon Graye – all of whom will reprise their roles in the upcoming third season.




Now, per Deadline, new images from The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 reveal Mickey&#39;s return and a surprise reunion with a character who was reportedly leaving the show.

         

Both images are from flashback sequences, with the first showing a younger Mickey after a surfing session. The second image shows Mickey cuddling on the couch with his ex-wife Maggie (Neve Campbell), who was previously reported to be leaving the show. In a statement, The Lincoln Lawyer showrunners Ted Humphrey and Dailyn Rodriguez explained the context of the two images:


While Season 3 of The Lincoln Lawyer is based on Michael Connelly’s novel The Gods of Guilt, we decided that a fun (and poignant) way to come into the season would be via a flashback sequence that gave us some insight into how Mickey Haller became Mickey Haller — not just the brilliant criminal defense lawyer but the husband, the father, and the man that he would come to be.
There is no comparable flashback in the book, so we devised something that would also serve as a fitting introduction to the story of the season, both on a plot level but also emotionally. These images, of a young Mickey finishing up surfing before a life-changing day at work, as well as cuddling on the couch with his wife Maggie after putting their young daughter Hayley to bed, are from a pair of these flashback scenes that bookend the first episode and propel us into the rest of Season 3.

 Maggie&#39;s Lincoln Lawyer Season 3 Return Explained 
          

Maggie McPherson, Mickey&#39;s first ex-wife and a capable criminal prosecutor, was a main character for the first two seasons of The Lincoln Lawyer. However, her role did become diminished during season 2, part 2 after Maggie accepts a promotion in San Diego and doesn&#39;t appear for the rest of the season, setting up her extended absence in season 3. Shortly after the official renewal by Netflix, it was reported that Campbell wouldn&#39;t return for The Lincoln Lawyer season 3, though the door remained open for her character&#39;s return in future seasons.




The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 images reveal Maggie&#39;s return a lot sooner than expected. Since season 3 is based on the fifth book in Connelly’s series, The Gods of Guilt, which doesn&#39;t feature Maggie, she still probably won&#39;t be appearing during the present-day timeline. As the showrunners explain, the flashback scene with Maggie was conceived as an engaging and meaningful way to provide insight into the evolution of Mickey Haller with a focus on him as a father, and a husband, and not just a brilliant attorney in The Lincoln Lawyer.



The Lincoln Lawyer season 3 does not yet have a release date. Seasons 1-2 are streaming on Netflix.
