## Literature Review

Veronica Rodriguez’s too smart to be used by anyone. She could be dating Jamal Menzies on 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 for ulterior motives.




Veronica Rodriguez likely has ulterior motives for dating Jamal Menzies in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. The 37-year-old reality star debuted as a supporting cast member in the reality TV franchise. She accompanied her friend, Tim Malcolm, on his journey to pursue another woman. Veronica became popular right after she appeared on the series for her colorful personality and humor, which helped her land a spot on 90 Day Fiancé: Pillow Talk. In 2022, Veronica joined 90 Day: The Single Life to pursue her true love. She dated a single father, but they eventually broke up because he didn’t seem interested in building a family with her.




Veronica surprised many viewers in the previous 90 Day: The Single Life season 3 Tell All by acknowledging she was dating Kim Menzies’ son, Jamal. She continued dating him and appeared in 90 Day: The Single Life season 4. Tim was visibly upset by Veronica’s new relationship, as he felt disappointed that she didn’t pick the right guy. He shared his concerns about Jamal, stating that he was with Veronica for all the wrong reasons. Many fans picked Tim’s side and shared their concerns on social media. However, Veronica seems to be taking advantage of Jamal in the latest season, and her actions prove that.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?   


 Veronica Loves The Glitz &amp; Glamor Of Reality TV 
         




Veronica could be taking advantage of Jamal because of her love for being on reality TV. When she started in the franchise a few years ago, she seemed like a genuine person who didn’t want anyone’s attention. Veronica didn’t act over the top or behave like she needed the limelight. Instead, she made her presence felt with sheer confidence. Veronica appeared in different spin-offs and stayed relevant without drama. However, something changed when Veronica joined 90 Day: The Single Life and suddenly became more dramatic than ever. She stopped being her usual cool self and became more pretentious.

Veronica&#39;s entire relationship with Jamal could’ve been more realistic as she made it into a much bigger deal than it was. Veronica may be using Jamal to stay relevant in the franchise. She knows she can’t entertain her fans with a regular story, so she has started pursuing Kim’s son. Veronica probably thinks that she no longer can keep 90 Day: The Single Life viewers hooked. Therefore, she has chosen to have a controversial relationship with Jamal in front of the cameras.






 Veronica Is Experienced Enough To See Through Jamal’s Charade 
         

Veronica’s dating history is another clue that hints she’s using Jamal. She is far more experienced than him. Veronica’s 37 and has already been in a couple of serious relationships. She also has a daughter and has been a single mother for a long time. Veronica knows why a young adult man like Jamal wants to date her; she can see right through him. While Tim thinks Jamal is using Veronica, he doesn’t realize things aren’t how they seem. It’s Veronica who’s in the front seat of the relationship and she has full visibility and control over her ongoing relationship.

The only reason Veronica could be dating Jamal is that she likely wants something casual. Most of the concerns people have about her new relationship are already evident to her. She knows that Jamal isn’t looking to make her his wife and understands that he can never be a stepdad to her daughter. Yet, she dates him for her own selfish needs. Veronica will probably leave Jamal once she&#39;s bored with him. She’s enjoying his company and keeping him by her side for now. Veronica has enough experience to know the difference between real love and temporary affection.

 Veronica Never Wanted To Be In A Long-Distance Relationship 
         

Veronica’s previous relationship in 90 Day: The Single Life also proves she understands her relationship dynamic with Jamal. In 2022, Veronica dated Justin Foster, a single father. However, things changed once Veronica realized Justin wasn’t being fully honest with her. She found out about his plans to move to Florida and immediately felt heartbroken. Veronica claimed that she was hurt that Justin had hidden such significant information from her. She was baffled to learn that he wouldn’t stay near her anymore because the move wasn’t part of their plans.




Veronica was open about her feelings on the show in 2022. She seemed confident that she didn’t want to be part of a relationship with Justin if he moved far away from her. Veronica never wanted to have a long-distance relationship. Yet, she started dating Jamal, who lives in San Diego. Veronica knew the potential of her new relationship with Jamal from the get-go. She understood that he’d only be able to casually satisfy her emotional and physical needs. If she had any doubt in her mind, she wouldn’t have continued dating him.



 Veronica Knows Jamal Doesn’t Fit The Role Of Stepdad 
          

Veronica understands her relationship dynamic with Jamal. The only reason she’s dating him is for selfish reasons. She knows he isn’t her ideal partner but someone she can have fun with for the time being. One of the biggest concerns for any single mother is finding a partner who can be a great stepdad to her kids. Liz Woods stayed with Big Ed Brown for a long time because she realized he could provide for her and her daughter. Similarly, Amanda Wilhelm broke up with Razvan Ciocoi because she knew he was too busy with his career and would never fulfill the role of being an ideal father to her kids.




Veronica also dated Tim, Justin, and other men to hopefully have them as paternal figures. She knows that Jamal isn’t ready to be a father. Veronica is simply seeking something casual. She’s with Jamal because the relationship comes with various personal benefits. Not only does she get a reality TV gig, but she also gets to feel young with someone like Jamal. She understands there is no solid future with him and is using him until she can&#39;t anymore; Jamal probably doesn’t care either. The new 90 Day: The Single Life season 4 cast member could also benefit from his relationship with Veronica, so it&#39;s a win-win.
