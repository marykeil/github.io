## Literature Review

The Traitors US season 2 may just be getting started, but they&#39;ve already shared who they want to see on the next season of the deceptive competition.




The Traitors US season 2 may just be getting started, but the cast has already revealed who they’d like to see on the next season of the successful competition series. While The Traitors US season 1 incorporated a mix of reality TV veterans and civilians into the game, the series changed things up for its second season. Welcoming a group of reality TV legends and entertainment personalities into the castle, host Alan Cumming’s decision on who would be the traitors in the game was even more difficult than it had been the first time around. For the majority of players, being chosen as faithful meant their game would be straightforward.




For the remaining players who were chosen as traitors, things weren’t quite so cut and dry. Big Brother legend Dan Gheesling and Married To Medicine’s Phaedra Parks, were both chosen as the first traitors to enter the game. The pair recruited Survivor’s Pavarti Shallow, who rounded out the Traitor team easily. As the traitor trio moves through the game, the faithful haven’t detected their strategy to divide and conquer. Though the cast’s been out of the game for quite some time, they’ve all begun to consider what they’d like to see on future seasons of The Traitors US.

                  20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now   Television is being impacted by the ongoing entertainment industry strikes, leaving many turning to reality TV. What are the best shows right now?   


 Wes Bergmann 
The Challenge
          




Chosen by both Johnny “Bananas” Devenanzio and Chris “C.T.” Tamburello, Wes Bergman could be a great pick for The Traitors US season 3 after his decades-long career on The Challenge. Originally a cast member from The Real World: Austin, Wes has proven himself time and time again on The Challenge. He’s gotten into the final eight times on the series and won three Challenge seasons. Though he’s more of a physical competitor on the show, he would do a great job as either a traitor or a faithful on the dramatic series. Despite saying he’d never appear on The Traitors, Wes could be a great addition.



 Britney Haynes 
Big Brother
          

After an exciting turn on Big Brother Reindeer Games, Britney Haynes has been back in the public eye after years away from the spotlight. As suggested by her Big Brother 14 castmates Dan and Janelle Pierzina, Britney was originally on Big Brother 12. Known for her hilarious and brutally honest diary room sessions, Britney would be the type of social player who would excel on a series like The Traitors US. Though she may not be the most capable competitor physically, she’d be able to contribute to missions and ultimately would make a great asset to The Traitors US.






 Kaysar Ridha 
Big Brother

 

Another Big Brother suggestion, this one made by Janelle, Kaysar Ridha would be an interesting cast member on The Traitors US season 3. Kaysar originally appeared on Big Brother season 6, then returned on Big Brother season 7 as a representative for his original cast on the first iteration of Big Brother: All-Stars. After a long absence, he returned in 2021 for the second iteration of Big Brother: All-Stars on BB 22 alongside his longtime friend and ally, Janelle.  Though he wasn’t able to fight his way to the end on Big Brother, Kaysar’s strategic abilities would make him a phenomenal faithful, as he’d be able to pinpoint the traitors.



 Shervin Roohparvar 
Shahs Of Sunset
         




Shervin Roohparvar, selected by her Shahs Of Sunset co-star Mercedes “MJ” Javid, would be an asset to the cast of The Traitors US season 3. While MJ’s read on Shervin is that he would be great at the game due to his attentive, competitive spirit, it also seems like he’d be able to handle the drama that comes with The Traitors US. After spending the second half of the series as a main cast member on Shahs Of Sunset, Shervin would be an asset to the game with his long experiences on reality TV.



 Beth Stolarczyk 
The Challenge
          

As one of the longest veterans of The Challenge franchise, Beth Stolarczyk is one of the most polarizing figures from the series&#39; storied history, which would make her fascinating on another season of The Traitors. Beth, who got her start on The Real World: Los Angeles, has participated in nine seasons of The Challenge. Suggested by The Traitors US season 2’s Trishelle Cannatella, Beth would be an interesting pick for a future season of the series due to her villainous nature on The Challenge. Given that she’s already portrayed as a villain on the series, she could operate well as a traitor or a faithful.






 Hannah Brown 
The Bachelorette
         

As one of the most popular Bachelorette leads in the series most recent years and the winner of both Dancing With The Stars and Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test, Hannah Brown would make a great cast member for a future season of The Traitors. Initially appearing on The Bachelor season 24 with Peter Weber, who suggested Hannah as a cast member, the Alabama native has been surprisingly open-minded and vocal about her opinions both on screen and off. Hannah’s vulnerability and ability to read others would make her a great asset for a future season of The Traitors. 



 Cara Maria Sorbello 
The Challenge
          




Having appeared on The Challenge a total of fourteen times, Cara Maria Sorbello’s abilities on the competitive series makes her uniquely qualified to be a cast member on The Traitors US season 3. Cara Maria, who was suggested by C.T. for a spot on an upcoming Traitors cast, has had a difficult time in the Challenge world when it comes to maintaining relationships. Despite the fact that she’s had a rough time socially, her incredible athleticism and overall strategy has helped her to get to the finals nine times, and win twice. She would be an incredible add to The Traitors, though being a traitor could be difficult.



 Marlo Hampton 
The Real Housewives Of Atlanta
          

Although she’s only become a main cast member during The Real Housewives Of Atlanta season 13, Marlo Hampton has been on the series since RHOA season 4 on and off. Marlo, who was suggested by her former co-star Phaedra despite her not being on the series in several years. Phaedra shared that she felt Marlo would be a major asset to The Traitors US, explaining that she felt Marlo would be fashionable and funny as a part of the series. While Marlo may be an interesting choice, she’d likely do well on The Traitors US, as she would be able to give other contestants reality checks.






 Taylor Smith 
Love Island USA
          

Suggested by her Love Island USA season 5 sweetheart, Carsten “Bergie” Bergersen, Taylor Smith would be an interesting choice for an upcoming season of The Traitors US. With Taylor coming into Love Island USA later on, she had to be strategic in order to keep herself in the game and connect with Bergie. Though she may be a wildcard when it comes to competitive skills, it’s clear that Taylor would make an interesting cast member for the series in the future. Though Bergie explained he simply wanted to see his girlfriend do well on another show, his pick was a sweet one.



 Tammie Brown 
RuPaul’s Drag Race

 




Chosen as a deep cut for those who know and love RuPaul’s Drag Race, Peppermint was excited to say she felt Tammie Brown could be a great choice for an upcoming season of The Traitors US. With Drag Race an intense competition series, things would be interesting for Tammie if they were to take the challenge of stepping into The Traitors. While it’s likely they would be able to conceal their role regardless of what it was, it’s probable that the issues Peppermint faced in feeling rejected and ganged up on could be painful for Tammie if they chose to compete on the series, as well.



 Ethan Zohn 
Survivor
          

As a long-time Survivor competitor and the winner of Survivor season 3, Ethan Zohn would be a fascinating choice for a future season of The Traitors US. Parvati, who was named a traitor after being recruited by Dan and Phaedra, explained that she felt Ethan would be a great fit for the deceptive series. While Parvati and Ethan are friends outside of Survivor, their alliance during Survivor season 40 didn’t keep him safe, even though he attempted to win his way back in. While Ethan may have stayed off reality TV for a long stretch, he would be an interesting pick for his classic cut-throat game on The Traitors US.






 Kelley Wentworth 
Survivor
          

As Sandra Diaz-Twine’s pick for who she’d want to see on a future season of The Traitors, Kelley Wentworth is a great choice. Known for her time on Survivor, Kelley has competed in 3 seasons and was a finalist on Survivor season 31, losing out on the final three by just one day. Kelley is known for her strategic gameplay, which would make her a great choice to compete on The Traitors US. While the series appears to be a bit out of her element, it would be something that could broaden her horizons.



 Bruno Tonioli 
Dancing With The Stars
         

A long-time judge on Dancing With The Stars, Bruno Tonioli was Maksim Chmerkovsiky’s choice for who he’d like to see appear on an upcoming season of The Traitors. While Bruno hasn’t been one of the professional dancers on the series, he’s spent the entirety of the show as one of the judges, scoring dancers and giving them feedback. While some have criticized Bruno’s personality in the past, he’s been a gregarious presence throughout DWTS, and seeing him on The Traitors would be nothing short of hilarious. With his infectious personality and wonderfully dramatic wardrobe, Bruno would be interesting to put into the mix.






 Emily Simpson 
The Real Housewives Of Orange County
          

As one of her fellow castmates on The Real Housewives Of Orange County, Tamra Judge shared that she’d like to see Emily Simpson on a future season of the series. Emily, who works as an attorney when she’s not trying to raise her teen daughter, would be a shoe-in for the analytical piece of The Traitors. As an attorney and, according to Tamra, for someone who’s highly intelligent, being part of The Traitors may be a breeze regardless of what twists and turns are facing her.



 Kenya Moore 
The Real Housewives Of Atlanta
          

Although she may struggle due to her background, Kenya Moore would be an interesting piece of the puzzle for The Traitors US season 3. Suggested by Sherée Whilfiled, Kenya has the dramatic ability as an actor to hide what she’s doing, which could be a major asset to her in the game. Still, many are feeling that there would be some issue with bringing Kenya into The Traitors US season 3. Thankfully, there’s still time to look out for the future when it comes to the treacherous series.
