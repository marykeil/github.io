## Literature Review
Nicole Franzel has competed on reality shows multiple times. After winning Reindeer Games, she declares what the future holds for her on Big Brother.




Nicole Franzel just won Big Brother Reindeer Games, but she&#39;s already revealing whether she&#39;ll ever make a return appearance to the franchise. Nicole is no stranger to the CBS reality show. She came in seventh place during Big Brother 16, which was quite the inaugural ride since she was evicted twice from the competition. That could have dissuaded her from returning, but it&#39;s a good thing she did because she ended up winning Big Brother 18 and came in third on Big Brother 22.




Nicole was interviewed by Parade after her exciting Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1 win and opened up about whether she has a future in the world of Big Brother.


 

The interviewer pointed out that if she&#39;s done with reality TV after this, her journey ended in a great place. She agreed and acknowledged, &#34;It&#39;s hard for me to want to ever go back because it was awesome. Everything was great about it.&#34; This answer wasn&#39;t a definitive rejection, but Nicole took to Instagram to adamantly declare that she&#39;s &#34;retired. FOR REAL.&#34;


 Nicole Franzel Reveals The Moment She Thought She Lost Reindeer Games 
          




While Nicole is basking in the excitement of winning Big Brother Reindeer Games, her win was not a sure thing. The contestant herself thought she would lose the game against Xavier Prather in which they had to fix a nutcracker by installing the various gears. She said that Xavier is &#34;really good&#34; at puzzles, while she tends to &#34;doubt&#34; herself on these types of challenges. She went as far as saying that she &#34;would have bet a million dollars&#34; that she was going to be eliminated during that Big Brother game. The confidence that was instilled in her from that win led her to feel better about going up against Taylor Hale for the grand prize.

Despite that added confidence, there was another moment later on when Nicole also thought she was going to lose the competition. She went up against Taylor in the final challenge. At one point, she was &#34;so behind&#34; that she didn&#39;t think she would finish the antlers. Nicole claimed that the edited episode &#34;doesn&#39;t even [show] how behind I was.&#34; Interestingly, Taylor claimed on social media the night of the finale that it was closer than everyone was led to believe. Regardless, the tide eventually turned in Nicole&#39;s favor and she won Big Brother Reindeer Games.




Big Brother Reindeer Games has been a huge success. There was a lot of fatigue coming off of Big Brother 25, which lasted 100 days and came under fire for certain challenges that seemed to favor athletic players over everyone else. The Reindeer Games challenges were much more fair and gave everyone a shot at winning. Ultimately, though, it was Nicole who pulled it off. If there ends up being a Big Brother Reindeer Games season 2, it&#39;ll be hard to top the excitement that this inaugural installment produced, but CBS will certainly try.
