## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé&#39;s Tiffany Franco is getting attacked by her critics but has the perfect response to them as she shows off her 83-pound weight loss.




90 Day: The Single Life star Tiffany Franco responded to negative comments about her in her signature sassy style after unveiling her incredible 83-pound weight loss. She was first introduced in 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 1 in 2019. Tiffany had met South African man Ronald Smith and was going to move to his country to get married to him. Tiffany wished for Ronald to join her and their baby daughter in the U.S. but never made any efforts to do so. While they had their multiple ups and downs in the marriage, Tiffany, who weighed almost 300 pounds, decided to get surgery for weight loss.




Tiffany has since lost more than 80 pounds and is inching towards her weight-loss goals and has been away from the franchise for the longest time, but Tiffany is still having to deal with critics. Tiffany reposted a reel by @thewranglerqueenmain. 


 

It showed Tobey Maguire’s iconic evil dance scene from 2007’s Spider-Man 3 with the caption, “How I live knowing someone somewhere out there still gets mad when they hear my name.” Tiffany also threw shade at “EVERY” man who’d ever called her “crazy” coming back and giving her a confidence boost “EVERY SINGLE TIME.”

 Tiffany Franco&#39;s Weight Loss Journey Explained 
          

Tiffany could have been referring to Ronald, with whom she split during the Single Life season 3 Tell All after revealing that he’d been two-timing and dating a different woman while wanting Tiffany to come back. Tiffany has been celebrating two major events in her life at the moment and seems to have no place left for Ronald to come back. She recently posted a video showing before and after clips of her weight loss on Instagram. Tiffany underwent Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy Surgery where around 70% of her stomach capacity was reduced. The operation was carried out in June 2021.

Tiffany has kept her fans updated with the progress ever since. In about three years, Tiffany has started to look like a different person. She&#39;s been on a strict diet and had to consume only liquids and take her multivitamins and medicines. She had lost about 15 pounds in a week-and-a-half, which may have been water weight. While her progress is slow compared to stars such as Angela Deem or Anna Campisi, Tiffany is focusing on her overall growth, including making her relationships healthier.




Tiffany has kept her new boyfriend off-camera and out of the public eye. She had previously dated a man named Dan MacFarland, whom she met on a dating app and was together with him on 90 Day: The Single Life. After their breakup in early 2023, Tiffany teased her relationship with a mystery man, but there was speculation that was reigniting her toxic relationship with Ronald. However, Tiffany is currently dating a man named Ronnie, who is from Ireland.



90 Day: The Single Life airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
