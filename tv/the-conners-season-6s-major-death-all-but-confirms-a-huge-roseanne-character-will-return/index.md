# The Conners Season 6s Major Death All But Confirms A Huge Roseanne Character Will Return


## SUMMARY 



  Bev&#39;s potential death in The Conners season 6 could bring back the character Leon Carp, who played a significant role in the original series.   Bev&#39;s deceit about Leon&#39;s share of the restaurant may have hidden his ownership, and her death could reveal the truth.   Leon&#39;s return would be significant for LGBTQIA&#43; representation and provide an opportunity for him to meet Darlene&#39;s son Mark.

## Literature Review

The Conners season 6 has already set up a major character death, but this twist would almost certainly result in a Roseanne fan-favorite&#39;s return.




Since The Conners season 6 seems set to feature a major Roseanne character&#39;s death, the spinoff is almost certain to finally bring back a fan-favorite figure as a result. Estelle Parsons’s Bev played a pivotal role in Roseanne’s original run, the show’s 2017 revival, and its subsequent spinoff, The Conners. However, she has already outlived her daughter Roseanne, and The Conners season 5, episode 8, “Of Missing Minds and Missing Fries,” revealed that she is battling severe dementia. In one of the most heartbreaking scenes of the series, Bev had to be reminded of Roseanne’s death by Jackie.




As such, it seems like The Conners season 6 is setting up Bev’s death. The severity of her dementia combined with her advanced age, as well as the fact that Roseanne’s father and both of Dan’s parents have already passed away, don’t bode well for her. This could be a good thing as Bev recently repaired her fraught relationship with Jackie when her daughter realized the extent of her dementia and accepted that she would never get closure from her feud with her mother. However, Bev’s season 6 death would also succeed because it could set up an overdue return.

Bev dying pretty much guarantees the return of Roseanne’s recurring guest star, Leon Carp. Played by sitcom veteran Martin Mull, Carp was the fastidious, overzealous manager of The Lunchbox for years. Although he could be a thorn in Roseanne and Jackie’s side, he was ultimately a well-meaning figure, and both sisters grew to like him over the years. However, Leon wasn’t added to the cast of characters seen in The Conners despite his prominent role in the original series. Fortunately, season 6 can change this since Bev’s potential death means the question of who owns The Lunchbox may become relevant again.




Back in Roseanne’s original run, Bev bitterly gave Leon her share of the Lunchbox when her daughters muscled her out of the business. As such, he could still own part of the Lanford building even though Jackie is now running a successful restaurant there. This almost came up back in The Conners season 2, when Becky and Jackie discovered that Bev still secretly held the lease to the restaurant. Bev eventually decided to give Darlene the lease, and Darlene, in turn, opted to hand it over to her aunt, thus allowing Jackie to revamp the severely neglected, crumbling building.

While a few Roseanne characters are still missing in The Conners, it is particularly notable that Leon Carp didn’t get a comeback in season 2 of the Roseanne spinoff. Bev never mentioned Leon’s share of the restaurant when her deceit was discovered, so viewers could reasonably assume he no longer owned any part of the Lunchbox when she gave Darlene the deed. However, Bev also never told anyone in the family that she owned the Lunchbox until Jackie found out. As such, it would be no surprise if her death revealed that Leon’s share wasn’t even hers to offer Darlene.




Bev’s death is almost a certainty, and it could set up Leon’s return since her will might drag him back into the thorny question of who has a stake in the building. It seems unlikely that a character as bullish and standoffish as Leon would have sold his share to Bev without a fight, and it is equally odd that Bev didn’t mention Leon when she gave Darlene the deed. After all, Bev hired Leon to manage the restaurant when her daughters insisted that she become a silent partner at The Lunchbox, so she had an existing relationship with him.



 Leon Carp’s Return Would Be Perfect for The Conners Season 6 
Mull’s Roseanne character should meet Darlene’s son
          

Leon was one of the earliest openly gay sitcom characters, so it is a sin that he has never met Darlene’s son, Mark. The Conners brought back plenty of Roseanne characters without much justification, from Roseanne’s old friend Crystal to the burly Bobo, a barfly that Dan once fought decades ago. As such, it would be a massive missed opportunity if the only LGBTQIA&#43; character in the multi-generational Conner family never met Leon, one of the first characters to have a gay wedding on network TV. Although Roseanne mocked his sensitive side, Carp was notably not defined by his orientation alone.




Like Mark, Leon Carp embodied some LGBTQIA&#43; stereotypes. However, he was also a complex, multi-faceted figure who, much like Darlene’s son, was a lot more than a walking punchline. He had ambitions and struggles of his own, including working out how to fit in while living in the small town of Lanford. Mark has been through the exact same difficulties throughout The Conners, meaning the pair have a lot in common when it comes to formative life experiences. Darlene and Roseanne might be nothing alike, but the late heroine’s grandson still deserves a chance to meet his grandmother’s old friend.



 Bringing Back Leon Makes Up For A Huge Roseanne Season 10 Failure

Mull’s character should have returned a lot earlier, but it would be better for the spinoff to include his comeback in season 6 than for the show to never feature him at all. The show is seemingly wrapping up its story, with both executive producer Bruce Helford and star John Goodman conceding that season 6 might be its last outing for the series. As such, there is no time like the present for the series to bring back the character. As a formative, if underrated figure in LGBTQIA&#43; representation onscreen, Leon Carp should not be ignored by both The Conners and Roseanne’s revival.




There are a lot of major storylines that the show’s next season must address before Bev’s death, including the return of Becky’s love interest Tyler in The Conners season 6. However, Leon should still get a chance to shine in this outing since he played a significant role in the original show and has been unfairly written out of existence until this point. As Mark heads off for college, Leon could impart some advice to Roseanne’s grandchild. Meanwhile, Bev’s likely death means that the heroes of The Conners also have a practical reason to seek out this Roseanne supporting star.



The Conners season 6 premieres February 7th, 2024, at 8pm ET on ABC.
