Summary

  The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist are getting married on January 4 in a live, televised event.   Former contestant Kathy Swarts and The Bachelorette season 20 star Charity Lawson will shine on the Gold Carpet as correspondents at the Golden Wedding.   Kathy and Charity will interview the guests as they arrive for the wedding.  







The Golden Bachelor couple Gerry Turner and Theresa Nist will get married on January 4 in a live, televised wedding, and former contestant Kathy Swarts and The Bachelorette season 20 star Charity Lawson will serve as &#34;Gold Carpet&#34; correspondents at the Golden Wedding. During The Golden Bachelor season 1, Kathy infamously told bride-to-be Theresa to &#34;zip it!&#34; when she felt that Theresa was boasting about her relationship with Gerry. However, they&#39;ve since smoothed things over. Charity got engaged to Dotun Olubeko on her season of The Bachelorette.

According to EW, as Gold Carpet correspondents, Kathy and Charity will interview Golden Wedding guests as they arrive for the nuptials and walk the Gold Carpet. ABC stated, &#34;Friends, family and Bachelor Nation guests will enter the reception area via a televised walkway, where Gold Carpet Correspondents and Bachelor Nation faves Kathy Swarts and Charity Lawson will be stopping guests for on-camera interviews and capturing cute moments from familiar faces.&#34; Several Bachelor Nation members have already been announced as guests for the Golden Wedding.

In addition to Kathy and Charity, several other Bachelor Nation favorites are expected to attend the wedding. Susan Noles, another Golden Bachelor contestant, will officiate the wedding. Susan has a company, Nuptials by Noles, which, according to its Instagram page, offers unique, modern or traditional wedding ceremonies. Theresa has confirmed that every Golden Bachelor contestant was invited to the wedding.

In addition, Bachelor Nation members Trista and Ryan Sutter, Jason and Molly Mesnick, Desiree and Chris Siegfried, Ben Higgins, Wells Adams, and more are expected to attend the Golden Wedding.





 

It&#39;s wonderful to see that The Golden Bachelor resulted not only in Gerry and Theresa finding love and getting married but also great friendships among the women who were the contestants. Although they all competed for Gerry&#39;s heart, they also made connections with each other. Susan, Kathy, and Leslie&#39;s attendance at the wedding is a testament to how much they care about Gerry and Theresa. In addition, Faith Martin, Ellen Goltzer, and Sandra Mason have appeared in social media posts about the wedding, so they&#39;ll most likely be in attendance as well.

The Golden Bachelor&#39;s Golden Wedding is certain to be a fantastic event that will be a celebration of Gerry and Theresa&#39;s love. Kathy and Charity are the perfect choices for the Gold Carpet correspondents. Kathy is especially funny and will bring her hilarious personality to the interviews. Charity&#39;s bubbly demeanor will light up the Gold Carpet as well. It&#39;ll be thrilling to see Bachelor Nation fan-favorites interviewed before the event and to see what everyone is wearing. Gerry and Theresa&#39;s Golden Wedding will be one of the most spectacular events of the year.




The Golden Wedding airs January 4 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.
