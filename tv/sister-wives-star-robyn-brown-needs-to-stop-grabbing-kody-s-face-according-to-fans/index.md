## Literature Review

Sister Wives star Robyn Brown may be Kody Brown&#39;s only remaining wife, but that doesn&#39;t relieve her of this exhausting habit, according to fans.




Sister Wives star Robyn Brown is Kody Brown’s only remaining wife, but fans aren’t sure she’ll stay his only wife if she continues a particular controlling habit. After the drama of Sister Wives season 18, Kody and Robyn’s life together looks a lot different than it used to. After Kody’s third wife, Christine Brown, chose to leave the family during Sister Wives season 17, things changed tremendously for the family. Janelle Brown and Meri Brown took the brunt of the backlash surrounding Kody and Christine’s divorce, leading them to their own splits in 2022. Robyn, however, stuck by Kody through the difficult time, though she shared that her relationship has been more difficult.




According to some Sister Wives fans, Robyn’s behavior has gotten increasingly more controlling as her time alone with Kody has gone on. Robyn’s been displaying “scary, manic, controlling behavior,” according to Reddit user Ashamed-Arm-3217, who shared a photo where Robyn “violently grabs his face and forces him to look at her in the eyes DURING a tv interview. This says, I told you what to say and that wasn’t it. They are so miserable.” During one of the Sister Wives special episodes that aired after the most recent season, Robyn was shown physically moving Kody around, making her desires clear.

Robyn and Kody’s relationship has always been tricky to navigate, but after she became his only wife in recent years, things have been more delicate as they’ve spent increasing amounts of time together. Reddit user Missy732 explained that Robyn’s been exhibiting this type of behavior, using physicality to control Kody. “Did you notice her face when Kody started to say something about Christine? She looked pissed...then she took her gloves off and grabbed his face and said kiss me. She was shutting him up before he said something she didn’t want him to.” Rather than allowing Kody to speak, Robyn has tried to insert herself, even by being disruptive. 


 

Although Robyn’s behavior isn’t new, it’s being noticed in a brand-new way now that Kody doesn’t have three other marriages to hide behind. Kody and Robyn’s relationship may have always been the most troubled in the family, but it’s been balanced out by problems in the other marriages in the past. Now Kody and Robyn are the only person the other has, making it clear that their behavior has a major impact on one another in new, deep ways. Robyn being controlling and possessive isn’t new, but the fact that she’s doing so by being physical with Kody is odd and overwhelming.




Although Sister Wives season 19 won’t be airing for quite some time, there&#39;s already a strong desire to see what the series holds now that the family is living in monogamy. While Kody and Robyn have spoken about potentially looking for another wife to join their family, they’ve also shared they’d be satisfied with each other in the long run. Robyn and Kody’s relationship has survived a lot, but it’s possible that Robyn’s controlling physical behavior may be the reason that the Sister Wives marriage meets its end.
