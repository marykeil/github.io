# The Mandalorian s Strangest Decision Means Din Djarin Faces A Massive Problem In Season 4


## SUMMARY 



  The removal of the Razor Crest and the introduction of the N-1 Starfighter poses a problem for Din Djarin as it lacks the practicality of storing bounties, which may hinder his new occupation as an Imperial hunter for the New Republic.   The New Republic&#39;s goal is to capture Imperials for interrogation rather than killing them, and the N-1 Starfighter is not well-equipped for this purpose. This creates a challenge for Din in terms of transporting his captives to the New Republic.   There are potential solutions to Din&#39;s problem, including receiving backup from the New Republic via Carson Teva or teaming up with characters from other Star Wars shows, such as Hera Syndulla. This could allow for the transportation of Imperial bounties on larger ships like the Ghost, providing a logical solution to the N-1 problem.

## Literature Review
The strangest decision concerning The Mandalorian’s core character may provide a big issue for Din Djarin based on season 4’s story premise.




One of the strangest decisions in The Mandalorian&#39;s three and a half seasons - including The Book of Boba Fett - raises an interesting problem for Din Djarin in season 4 of the anticipated Disney&#43; series. By the end of The Mandalorian season 3, it was all but confirmed that The Mandalorian was replacing Rangers of the New Republic in season 4. Din&#39;s vow to unofficially aid the New Republic in hunting down Imperial remnants proved this, drastically raising the anticipation for the upcoming Star Wars TV show.




While little else has been revealed about the story of The Mandalorian season 4, several plot elements can be deduced from the set-up of this premise. Evidently, The Mandalorian season 4 will see Din Djarin and Grogu coming into conflict with other Imperial warlords besides Moff Gideon. The Mandalorian season 4&#39;s Empire-based story will ensure this, though the capturing and imprisoning of Imperial warlords may prove a problem for Din Djarin after the show&#39;s strangest character choice in its entire run.


 The N-1 Starfighter Has No Room For Bounties 
          

The character choice in question was the removal of the Razor Crest as Din&#39;s mode of transport in favor of an N-1 Starfighter. While the N-1&#39;s inclusion was fantastic to see for fans of the Star Wars prequels, there is no denying that the ship is far less practical for a wandering warrior like Din Djarin. The Razor Crest served as his living quarters as well as his transportation, with the N-1 offering only the latter. While the lack of living space was solved by Din and Grogu being granted a house on Navarro, the N-1 has other issues pertaining to Din&#39;s future employment.




What&#39;s more, the Razor Crest was shown to have adequate room for storing bounties which was undeniably helpful for Din&#39;s old profession. Concerning Din&#39;s new, unofficial occupation, the N-1&#39;s lack of bounty storage may prove a problem when the Mandalorian goes after Imperial remnants. This problem is made all the more serious when taking into account how The Mandalorian&#39;s past seasons have hinted that Din will need to transport Imperial bounties.

                  How To Watch Star Wars Movies In Order   Here is how to watch all Star Wars movies and TV shows chronologically and in order of release, and how each fits into the Star Wars timeline.    



 The New Republic Will Want Imperials Captured, Not Killed 
          

In The Mandalorian season 3, it was confirmed that the New Republic wishes for Imperial warlords to be captured for interrogation rather than killed. This was revealed when Carson Teva found Moff Gideon&#39;s transport ship abandoned after the latter escaped New Republic captivity. In The Mandalorian season 4, it is likely the government of the New Republic will continue this method of capturing Imperials for information rather than killing them. In fact, the New Republic being made more aware of Imperial threats in Ahsoka season 1 likely made the government more focused on gleaning information about other Empire-based activity in the galaxy.




Unfortunately, the N-1 has proven to be an inadequate spacecraft for this purpose. While the N-1&#39;s increased speed and firepower over the Razor Crest may better allow Din to combat Imperial remnants directly, what he will do after subduing his enemies remains to be seen. If the strange, out-of-nowhere choice to replace the Razor Crest with the N-1 had not been made, The Mandalorian season 4 would have avoided this issue and Din would have been able to escort his captives across the galaxy at will.



 Will Din Djarin Have Backup To Transport Imperials? 
         

All that said, there are some ways Din Djarin could transport Imperials to the New Republic. One of these options is simply receiving New Republic backup. While Din will not be working with the New Republic directly, he will have a liaison in the form of Carson Teva. After capturing Imperials, Din could leave them in a safe spot and alert Carson to their location after which the latter could take a New Republic transport to obtain the bounty. Din could also simply deliver the bounties to Carson at the base of the Adelphi Rangers before Carson takes them into New Republic captivity.




Another way in which Din could receive backup in transporting Imperials links to another New Republic Star Wars show. The promise of Din Djarin&#39;s story of The Mandalorian season 4 became all the more exciting upon the release of Ahsoka season 1 when the latter show highlighted Hera Syndulla investigating Imperial remnants too. This has led many to theorize that Din Djarin will team up with Hera and Ezra Bridger to capture Imperial remnants with Carson Teva being the connective tissue between the characters.

If this theory pans out, Din&#39;s Imperial bounties could be transported on Hera&#39;s ship, Star Wars Rebels&#39; iconic Ghost. The Ghost is similar to the Razor Crest, acting as a place where Hera and her son - formerly the Rebels crew - could live. As such, the ship would have no lack of space for Imperial bounties captured by Din. Not only would this be a logical solution to Din&#39;s N-1 problem, but it would also be a natural continuation of both his and Hera&#39;s story in a way that ties two interconnected New Republic shows together via The Mandalorian season 4, setting the stage for Dave Filoni&#39;s upcoming Star Wars movie.
