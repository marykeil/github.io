## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians includes a vast selection of ancient Greek magical items, each with their own unique abilities, powers, and owners.





Percy Jackson and the Olympians includes a roster of magical items, each one holding its own unique powers and abilities. Throughout Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, one of the best aspects of the original book series continues to be adapted: the powerful items that bridge the modern world with ancient Greece. While some of these aspects cause the Percy Jackson TV show to make book changes where necessary, most depictions of the various magical items closely match the source material.
While some of the TV show&#39;s magical items are integral to the plot or characters, others are utilized as small Percy Jackson Easter eggs which reference the original stories. For example, some of these objects are hidden in the opening attic scene of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, in which Percy Jackson receives his prophecy for the quest he is about to embark on. Other magical items are used more blatantly in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; story, such as during the main trio&#39;s quest as they encounter figures like Medusa, Echidna, Ares, and Hephaestus.







 8  Percy Jackson&#39;s Sword 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1.


One of the first magical items introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians is Percy&#39;s sword. Percy is given this sword in the form of a pen by Mr. Brunner/Chiron in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 before the titular hero uses it to defeat Mrs. Dodds/Alecto the Fury. The reason Percy&#39;s sword is magical stems from its two different forms, one being the aforementioned pen and the other being a glowing bronze weapon. The sword masquerades as a simple ballpoint pen, only growing into the Greek weapon when Percy uncaps the lid of the pen.
While the sword has not received as much detail in Percy Jackson and the Olympians as it did in the original book, such as its name Anaklusmos/Riptide, it also can be shrunk back down by touching the pen cap to the tip of the sword. Similarly, Percy can never lose the sword now that it is in his possession, as the pen will automatically reappear in his pocket no matter what happens to it. While the following aspect is not overtly magical, the sword can also disintegrate the monsters of Percy Jackson due to its Celestial Bronze composition, something that cannot be said for weapons of the mortal world.





 7  Annabeth&#39;s Magic New York Yankees Hat 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2.
        

Another magical item of Percy Jackson&#39;s universe was introduced in episode 2 of the show: Annabeth&#39;s magic hat. Shortly before Capture the Flag begins in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2, Annabeth leaves Percy in the woods by turning invisible. She reveals that this power is granted to her by a Yankees cap, one that was given to her by Athena. The hat allows its wearer to turn completely invisible, a power that is used multiple times throughout Percy Jackson and the Olympians episodes 2 and 3 and proves to be vital throughout the entire series in the original books.





 6  Luke&#39;s Magical Flying Shoes 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3.
        

Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3 continues where its two predecessors left off by introducing more magical items to the show. One of these items is a pair of flying shoes given to Percy by Luke to aid the former on his quest. The shoes were revealed as a gift to Luke by Hermes, similar to the fact that Annabeth&#39;s invisibility hat was given to her by Athena.
These wings allow the person wearing the shoes to fly, though it takes mastery of them to be able to fly with any control. 

The shoes are initially shown as a regular pair of Converse sneakers before their magical abilities become known. After speaking the word &#34;Maia,&#34; the sneakers&#39; laces grow and become wings, one on each foot. These wings allow the person wearing the shoes to fly, though it takes a mastery of them to be able to fly with any control. The word &#34;Maia&#34; triggers the shoes as this was the name of Hermes&#39; mother in Greek mythology.
Another interesting element about the shoes is that they are linked closely to Hermes. Since Ancient Greece, Hermes has been represented with the image of a flying sandal as the deity was the god of roads, travelers, and messengers. As such, the winged shoes make sense in the modernized world of Percy Jackson as a gift from Hermes, one that has now been passed on to Percy.





 5  Zeus&#39; Master Bolt 
First mentioned in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2.
        

Perhaps the most important magical artifact in Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 is Zeus&#39; master bolt, something made even more interesting by the fact it is yet to be physically seen. Zeus&#39; master bolt is the object of Percy&#39;s quest in Percy Jackson season 1, as the weapon has been stolen. The crux of Percy&#39;s quest centers on finding the master bolt and returning it to Zeus, clearing both the former&#39;s name and that of his father, Poseidon.
Despite not being shown in Percy Jackson and the Olympians as of yet, Zeus&#39; master bolt can be spotted in both the official trailer for the show and one of its posters. 

Shown as a cylindrical grip with protruding lightning bolts on either end, Zeus&#39; master bolt is one of the most powerful magical weapons in the world of Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The bolt is not only a powerful weapon, but a symbol of Zeus&#39; rule over Olympus. Without the bolt, Zeus&#39; rule is being seemingly questioned by one of the other Olympians. Zeus suspects Poseidon, while Percy&#39;s quest is taking him to the Underworld to confront Hades, who is suspected of stealing the bolt by Chiron and Dionysus.





 4  Medusa&#39;s Head 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3.





As of the end of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, a much more gruesome magical item is introduced to the world. The item in question is the decapitated head of Medusa, which becomes a trophy of war for Percy after the latter kills the former. The head remains functional in that Medusa&#39;s gorgon power of turning those who look upon it to stone still works even after her death. This is proven when Percy uses Medusa&#39;s head to turn Alecto to stone before mailing Medusa&#39;s head to Olympus as a show of both defiance and tribute to the gods.

 3  Percy Jackson&#39;s Golden Drachma 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3.
        

Much like Zeus&#39; master bolt, the golden drachma found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3 are magical items that have not yet been shown to their full capabilities. The drachma, golden coins from Ancient Greece, first appear as Percy is setting out on his quest. Percy is given human currency as well as a bag of golden drachma for use in the magical areas of Percy Jackson&#39;s world. While this in and of itself is not inherently fantastical, one of the uses of the golden drachma from the Percy Jackson books proves their magical power.
In the original books, Percy and friends often use the drachma to communicate with their allies across vast differences. In the world of Percy Jackson, the Greek goddess of rainbows, Iris, accepts drachma as payment, which then allows the payee and a person of their choosing to have face-to-face conversations as long as the gold coin is thrown through a rainbow. This has not yet been shown in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, though the golden drachma&#39;s more magical properties will likely be shown as season 1 of the Disney&#43; show continues.





 2  Ares&#39; Shield 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5.
        

Ares&#39; shield is another magical item that plays an important role in Percy&#39;s quest. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1, episode 5, Ares himself tasks Percy, Annabeth, and Grover with retrieving his magical shield from the Tunnel of Love ride at Waterland. Ares previously lost the shield there after being caught on a romantic date with Aphrodite, the wife of Percy Jackson&#39;s Greek god Hephaestus, who built the waterpark. The books reveal that the magical shield can change form, such as into a bulletproof vest that Ares wears.





 1  Hephaestus&#39; Golden Throne 
First introduced in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5.
        

Also introduced in Pery Jackson and the Olympians episode 5 is Hephaestus&#39; golden throne, which traps the person who sits on it and turns them into a statue. Sitting on the throne is what released Ares&#39; shield from the grasp of the statue nearby, with no way to outsmart the creation and free whoever sits on it. However, Annabeth convinces Hephaestus to free Percy, stating that none of them want to be like the other vengeful, backstabbing gods and figures who inspired Hephaestus to make such a contraption.
New episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians release every Tuesday on Disney&#43;.
