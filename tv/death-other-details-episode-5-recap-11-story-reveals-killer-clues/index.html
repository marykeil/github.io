  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>After Winnie&rsquo;s confession in Death and Other Details episode 4, Rufus spent episode 5 trying to find out who she&rsquo;s really working for.</p>
<p>Summary
Leila&rsquo;s car crash was not an accident, as she suspected. Her car was hacked by someone, indicating that Viktor Sams or someone else may have wanted her dead.
Sunil helps Imogene investigate Collier Mills for illegal business practices.
The Chuns ask for a 51% stake in Collier Mills, which Anna disagrees with, but Lawrence accepts. This shows that Lawrence may not trust Anna to be his successor.</p>
<p>Death and Other Details episode 5 marked the halfway point of the season and the first time that characters stepped off the cruise ship and onto land. Death and Other Details episode 4 saw Winnie confess to murdering Danny, but Rufus knew that she wasn’t working alone, so he spent episode 5 trying to get her to share who she’d been working for. With Imogene and Sunil off the ship, he turned to other Death and Other Details characters, Leila and Teddy, for help with his investigation, expanding his circle of trust.
The episode also saw major developments in the deal between the Colliers and the Chuns while Imogene tried to find answers about Collier Mills and their potential illegal business practices. Compared to Death and Other Details episode 4, it wasn’t as action-packed, but it included important reveals and more clues as to who really killed Danny. With Winnie’s confession, the biggest question of the season has shifted to who Viktor Sams is and what is his connection to the Colliers.</p>
<p>Death And Other Details Review: Hulu&rsquo;s Entertaining Murder Mystery Has A Flair For The Dramatic
Death and Other Details may have taken on more than it should, but for what it is worth, the show is entertaining and enthralling. </p>
<p>11  Danny Told Leila His True Identity Before He Died
She told him he was going to get them both killed</p>
<p>Leila confronted Danny in Death and Other Details episodes 1 and 2 about him following her around the world. However, it wasn’t until episode 5 that it was revealed that he admitted to doing so and shared his true identity with her as Danny, not Keith Trubitsky. Danny told her it was the quickest he’d ever been made and shared what he’d learned about her through his investigation.
Danny believed that Leila, who is a journalist, had married Anna to find out more information about the Colliers. She told him that wasn’t the case, and that the Colliers were actually the victims. When Danny brought up Viktor Sams, Leila told him he was going to get them both killed, suggesting that someone had been listening in to their conversation.</p>
<p>10  Sunil Helped Imogene Find Out The Truth About The Colliers
He knew someone who could help find out if their business practices were illegal</p>
<p>At the end of Death and Other Details episode 4, Sunil and Imogene left the cruise ship to help the Ukranian refugees that Jules had stowed away. Rather than returning to the ship after dropping them off, they decided to stay in the Italian town, as Sunil told Imogene that he knew someone who could date the document she had found in the Colliers&rsquo; books. If the document was made after a certain date, Imogene could prove that Collier Mills was knowingly using a banned, cancerous material in their products.</p>
<p>9  Leila’s Car Was Hacked Before She Crashed
She had been looking into Viktor Sams just before her accident</p>
<p>Leila has long insisted in Death and Other Details that her car crash a couple of months before the cruise wasn’t an accident. While other characters assumed that the accident had just made her paranoid, a flashback in Death and Other Details episode 5 proved her theory right. She had been investigating Viktor Sams and had interviewed an ex-NSA agent who had also looked into him just before the crash. The ex-NSA agent&rsquo;s life had been ruined by a hacker and the same happened to Leila.
While driving, Leila spoke into her recorder about the interview and her suspicions about Viktor Sams. Immediately after, her car was hijacked as someone took over both the radio and steering wheel. Without her control, she was driven off the road and into a ditch. Fortunately, Leila survived the incident, but it’s more than likely that Viktor Sams had intended to kill her as he did Imogene’s mom.</p>
<p>Sophia Reid-Gantzert On Portraying Imogene&rsquo;s Difficult Childhood In Death And Other Details
Sophia Reid-Gantzert chats about getting into Imogene&rsquo;s headspace for Death And Other Details, collaborating with Violett Beane, and her next film.</p>
<p>8  Leila Told Anna She Wants A Divorce
Anna doesn’t believe her about the accident</p>
<p>When Leila told Anna about what really happened when her car crashed, her wife didn’t believe her. Instead, she sided with the medical professionals who believed that Leila’s theory and paranoia was a byproduct of her injuries and the trauma she suffered from the crash. Realizing that Anna would never fully take her side, Leila told Anna she wanted a divorce. Despite having cheated on her in Death and Other Details episode 4, Anna didn’t want to end their marriage, and it is yet to be seen just how serious Leila&rsquo;s request was.</p>
<p>7  Tripp Asked His Dad For A Million Dollars
His dad denied him</p>
<p>As the black sheep of the Collier family in Death and Other Details, Tripp is still trying to prove himself to his father. Since he wasn’t given much of a role within Collier Mills, he is trying to find success in the crypto market. He has a friend who could partner with him, but he needs a million dollars to get him on board.
When Tripp asked his dad for the money from his trust fund, Lawrence was insulted, reminding his son that it was the family money, and he hadn’t earned it. Hurt, Tripp asked his dad if he had anything to do with Alexandra being blackmailed. Rather than answering his question, Lawrence simply told Tripp to get out, suggesting that he might have something to hide.</p>
<p>6  The Chuns Asked For A 51% Stake In Collier Mills
Lawrence &amp; Anna Disagreed On The Deal</p>
<p>After Anna’s hard work getting the Chuns to revisit their deal, Death and Other Details episode 5 finally saw it finalized. However, the final terms weren’t ones that Anna agreed with. The Chuns asked for a 51% stake in Collier Mills and while Anna was ready to walk away from the deal, Lawrence accepted it.
This proved that he never really trusted her to take over as CEO of the family company and that he might not name her his successor after all. Though the deal saved the Colliers from sure debt, it came with a price. The Colliers no longer have majority control of their own company, which will surely cause some issues down the road.</p>
<p>5  Leila Found A Camera Hidden In Her Hotel Room
It had to be installed by a crew member</p>
<p>While the Colliers and the Chuns met in Death and Other Details episode 5, Leila scanned their hotel room for a hidden camera. She eventually found one and brought it to Rufus and Teddy. The ship’s manager told them it wasn’t one of their security cameras, but for it to have been placed in Leila and Anna’s room, it would have had to be done before the guests arrived on the ship.
This means that a crew member is the culprit, but it can’t be Winnie, as she had arrived the same day as the guests. Winnie is working for Viktor Sams, but the hidden camera proves that another crew member is as well; they just don’t know who yet. Since there was a hidden camera in Tripp’s room that took pictures of him and Alexandra, there are likely cameras in everyone’s rooms, or at least every member of the Collier family.</p>
<p>4  Imogene &amp; Sunil Were Being Followed
Their stalker had a camera</p>
<p>After meeting with Sunil’s friend, Imogene realized that the two of them were being followed. The man had a camera hanging from his neck, and when Sunil and Imogene began to run away, he gave chase. Fortunately, they were able to get some disguises and get back to the ship unharmed, but it raised many questions. The man could be working for Viktor Sams and could be charged with getting photos together to blackmail them. This would have required him to be in contact with someone on the ship who knew they’d left and arrived at the port.</p>
<p>3  Alexandra Accused Llewellyn Of Blackmail
He knew about her affair with Tripp</p>
<p>Alexandra had spoken with Tripp about the blackmail, but he seemed just as in the dark about it as she was. Still, she was suspicious of the Collier family after her conversation with Katherine in Death and Other Details episode 4. This led her to accuse Llewellyn, who knew of their affair, of blackmailing her, but he denied it. Scared and frustrated, Alexandra returned to her hotel room and pulled out papers that revealed her plan to sue the Collier family, which could be especially disastrous for them as they have just finalized the deal with the Chuns.</p>
<p>2  Imogene &amp; Sunil Kissed
Episode 5 explored their chemistry</p>
<p>After spending all of Death and Other Details episode 5 together, Imogene and Sunil kissed on the boat ride back to the cruise ship. The series had been teasing a potential relationship between them since the start and their chemistry was on display throughout episode 5. Imogene has shown herself to be impulsive romantically, as she had hooked up with Jules in the first episode. Yet, there seems to be something real between Imogene and Sunil that will likely be explored in future episodes of Death and Other Details.</p>
<p>1  Rufus Discovered A Secret Room In The Ship
It is likely Viktor Sams’ hideout</p>
<p>Death and Other Details episode 5, like those before it, ended on a cliffhanger. Rufus, Teddy, and Leila had been working together in Imogene’s absence, and they made a breakthrough in the episode’s final minutes. Rufus realized something when looking at a picture of the ship’s design and went below deck with an axe, where he discovered a secret room that is likely where Viktor Sams has been hiding out. The camera didn’t show the room in Death and Other Details episode 5, but their reactions hinted at a major operation inside.
