## Literature Review
Rick Sanchez is a complex character, with many different versions across the multiverse in Rick and Morty, from Rick C-137 to Rick Prime.




During their travels throughout space and the multiverse, Rick and Morty have met countless alternate versions of themselves, but only one can be the Rickest Rick. Rick and Morty began airing on Adult Swim in 2013, and the show has since gone on to have seven seasons with three more greenlit for the future. It&#39;s an irreverent comedy show that began as a parody of Doc Brown and Marty from Back To The Future, but it&#39;s since grown and expanded to have an incredibly detailed world with a wide array of characters.
Among all these colorful characters, the show has also leaned heavily into the idea of having alternate-reality versions of the series&#39; protagonists. During visits to The Citadel of Ricks and while universe jumping, Rick and Morty have come into contact with a huge number of other versions of themselves. But not every Rick leaves a distinct impression, with some appearing only briefly and many others being almost identical to Rick, aside from the fact that they are more easily killed off.









 








 10  Teacher Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 3, Episode 7, &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34;
        

Teacher Rick is a central character in The Citadel where he trains Rickless Morty&#39;s at the Morty Academy. This Rick may only have a brief time on-screen, but his role is significant as he influences all of the Morty&#39;s passing through his class to equip them to best aid their new Rick once they get reassigned. Teacher Rick also has a distinct appearance from many of his alternates in that he has lengthy blue hair that hangs down, and a scholarly outfit topped off with a bowtie and a black robe.





 9  Retired General Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 3, Episode 7, &#34;The Ricklantis Mixup&#34;
        

Retired General Rick clearly made an impression on all of his peers, considering he was almost elected as the next president of The Citadel before Candidate Morty, an alternate version of Morty Smith, took a surprise lead. Previously, RGR served in the Citadel militia before starting a career in the political arena. In the early polls, RGR was the leading candidate with a significant portion of the predicted votes in his favor, but Morty&#39;s speech during the debates swayed many voters in his favor. Regardless, a Rick who can earn so much respect and admiration from other versions of himself belongs in the top 10.

 8  Doofus Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 1, Episode 10, &#34;  Rick-Counters Of The Rick-Kind&#34;


 







Doofus Rick hails from Dimension J19 Zeta 7, and despite his association with the Citadel militia, he has a kind heart and is looked down upon by the other Ricks. Doofus Rick may be less intelligent than his peers, but he is still a capable inventor and engineer, wielding genius-level intellect. Doofus Rick also develops a close relationship with Jerry, his son-in-law in many other realities, but even this earns him more ridicule and bullying from the other Ricks. Despite all this, Doofus Rick is intelligent, kind, and overall, a more considerate version of Rick.





 7  Pickle Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 3, Episode 3, &#34;Pickle Rick&#34;
        

Technically, Pickle Rick is a version of C-137 Rick, but considering his very different appearance and characteristics and the popularity of this version of the character, it deserves a place among the top 10 Ricks. Essentially, Rick turns himself into a pickle to get out of therapy with his family, but when Beth takes the serum that would revert him to his normal human form, he has to improvise a way to get back to normal. In true Rick fashion, Rick is able to innovate and create an articulated body from rats to make himself mobile, and he goes on a spectacular adventure.





 6  Tiny Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 2, Episode 7, &#34;Big Trouble In Little Sanchez&#34;
        

Once again, Rick C-137 created an alternative version with Tiny Rick, but this time, he did it to jump into wild adventures with his grandkids. When Morty and Summer&#39;s school is targeted by a Vampire, Rick transfers his consciousness into a younger clone, so he can inconspicuously attend school with them. Tiny Rick has many things in common with the original, but his young, unburdened brain also sees him becoming the life of the party and incredibly creative. Eventually, his older consciousness tries to communicate to his grandkids through music and art that expresses deep despair, and Rick is eventually restored to his original body.





 5  Toxic Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 3, Episode 6, &#34;Rest And Ricklaxation&#34;
        

When Rick and Morty go to visit a day spa in space that promises to rid them of all their toxins, the duo doesn&#39;t expect those toxins to create entirely new entities of themselves full of only the toxic traits. Toxic Rick is a one-shot antagonist, who tries to fool Rick and Morty into releasing him from a toxic plane of existence. Toxic Rick then goes on to try and change everyone on Earth into the most toxic versions of themselves, before he is forced to re-merge with Healthy Rick to survive.

 4  Healthy Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 3, Episode 6, &#34;Rest And Ricklaxation&#34;
        

Healthy Rick is the other half of Toxic Rick&#39;s persona, which retains only the good, kind, compassionate, and healthy aspects of Rick. Healthy Rick may have only lived for a brief time, but this version of Rick still has some major issues. For one, Healthy Rick has no real attachment to his family, as he views his attachments as toxic and irrational behaviors. As a result, he may be kinder and more open with his family, but he lacks a real attachment to them. Healthy Rick&#39;s compassion leads him to save the toxic version of himself, to reintegrate and become a more rounded person, flaws and all.





 3  Evil Rick 
Rick And Morty Season 1, Episode 10, &#34;  Rick-Counters Of The Rick-Kind&#34;


 







Evil Rick appeared to be a fierce threat to Rick and Morty when they discovered his secret lair, protected by a shield of Morty&#39;s being tortured to project masking brainwaves. However, Evil Rick is soon revealed to be an organic robot puppet for his grandson, Evil Morty. Evil Morty is the true villain behind Evil Rick&#39;s actions, and it appears that Evil Rick was forced to commit atrocities. Considering how pivotal he was in helping Evil Morty rise to power, Evil Rick deserves a place in the top three, especially when, at the end of his life, he welcomes his destruction to free him from the pain.





 2  Rick Prime 
Multiple Mentions And Appearances
        

Rick Prime was the first Rick, and the only one aside from Rick C-137 to develop portal travel without any help. When Rick Prime developed his portal gun, he abandoned his wife and daughter to explore the multiverse and introduce portal travel to other Ricks. When Rick Prime first met Rick C-137, he didn&#39;t want any part in portal travel as he chose to focus on his family. Shortly after, Rick Prime bombed Rick&#39;s home, killing his wife and daughter, and sparking something in Rick C-137 to create portal travel on his own and set out on a mission to kill his rival.





 1  The Rickest Rick (C-137) 
Every Episode


 







Rick C-137 is the protagonist of Rick and Morty and has proven himself to be the Rickest Rick in the multiverse. Rick has taken down Evil Rick, Rick Prime, and countless other threats. Rick left his universe to track down Rick Prime and settle in Prime&#39;s dimension, adopting his grandson Morty. Rick then found a way to eliminate his rival and, for all of his flaws, he clearly has love for his family and tries to do the right thing by them. He may not be perfect, but as it turns out, no Rick is. At least C-137 continues to choose his family over himself when it comes down to it.
