## Literature Review
Percy Jackson and the Olympians is being praised for its fidelity to the source material, though that does not mean there are no changes to the books.




Summary
 The Disney&#43; adaptation of Percy Jackson provides more insight into Percy&#39;s childhood, delving deeper into his character&#39;s history, while simultaneously leaving out elements of his boarding school life. 
 Changes in conversations between Mr. Brunner and Percy foreshadow different aspects of the overarching story of the series. 
 Other notable book elements like the Camp Half-Blood character of Argus or the food and drink of the gods, ambrosia and nectar, are not found in the Percy Jackson TV show. 


Percy Jackson and the Olympians makes several changes to the books, though most are for the benefit of the story. The Percy Jackson books were previously adapted into two movies, one in 2010 and one in 2013. The biggest issues with these adaptations were the Percy Jackson movies&#39; changes from the books, though the problems were not limited to the infidelity to the source material. Unfortunately, several aspects went wrong with the Percy Jackson movies, leading to a third film being canceled and a TV reboot being placed into development on Disney&#43;.
Concerning the Disney&#43; show, the reviews for Percy Jackson and the Olympians have proven that the biggest issue with the 2010 movie series has been avoided. The show&#39;s fidelity to the source material is evident, likely spearheaded by original author Rick Riordan&#39;s involvement in the series. Percy Jackson and the Olympians season 1 adapts The Lightning Thief, the first book in Percy Jackson&#39;s release and chronological order. While the faithfulness of the show to this book is evident, the Disney&#43; adaptation is not afraid to make changes where necessary to translate the story, with several being found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; first five episodes.









 








 37  Percy Jackson’s Childhood Is Not As Fleshed Out In The Original Book 
The Disney&#43; adaptation offers more insight into Percy&#39;s younger years.
        

One of the more interesting changes made to Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians is the increased insight into the titular character&#39;s childhood. The opening montage of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 details scenes of Percy spotting Greek monsters as a child, as well as details about why Percy&#39;s mother named him after the Greek hero Perseus. These scenes are not found in the original Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief book, allowing the Disney&#43; adaptation to delve deeper into his character&#39;s history.





 36  Mr. Brunner’s First Conversations With Percy Are Different In The Percy Jackson Books 
The book more overtly sets up the overarching story of all five Percy Jackson books.
        

In the opening of the original Lightning Thief book, Mr. Brunner&#39;s first conversations with Percy involve mention of Kronos and the Titans, and how these beings once had a war with Zeus, Poseidon, and the rest of the Olympian gods. This foreshadows several aspects of Percy Jackson&#39;s overarching story, though these sections in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 are slightly different. In the early sections of Mr. Brunner&#39;s interactions with Percy in the show, the former explains how the gods have plans for the latter that will become clear soon enough.
Hints towards Kronos and the other overarching villains of the Disney&#43; Percy Jackson are included in other scenes to compensate for Mr. Brunner&#39;s lack of mention of them. 






 35  Percy’s Trip To The Museum Is Shortened In The Disney&#43; Show 
Percy&#39;s school trip is missing certain elements from the original The Lightning Thief book.
        

The different conversation between Mr. Brunner and Percy in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 takes place during a school trip to a museum in New York City. This museum trip is shortened in the Disney&#43; adaptation of The Lightning Thief, mainly concerning the fight between Percy and Alecto/Mrs. Dodds. In the original book, Percy is taken inside the museum before being attacked by Alecto, with Mr. Brunner interrupting and handing Percy a sword. However, in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1, Brunner gives Percy the sword before Alecto&#39;s attack, which takes place outside in the street, thus making for a significantly more fast-paced scene.





 34  The Fates Appear In Percy Jackson &amp; The Lightning Thief’s Early Chapters - But Don’t In The Show 
The foreshadowing of Percy&#39;s destiny is found earlier in the original Lightning Thief book.
        

In Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Percy returns outside after defeating Alecto before noticing three old women across the street. These women are shown knitting a large piece of yarn. It is revealed that these women are the Fates, who knit together the destiny of every person in Greek mythology. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1, the Fates are not shown after Percy&#39;s fight with Alecto, though a featurette promoting the show hinted they would be involved in future episodes.


This hint came to fruition in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 5. During Percy&#39;s conversation with the Nereid, Grover and Annabeth are shown waiting for Percy beneath the ruined St. Louis Gateway Arch. During this scene, Annabeth notices the Fates and watches them cut a thread of yarn, just as they do to Percy in the early chapter of The Lightning Thief. Rather than Percy viewing the Fates early in his journey, Percy Jackson and the Olympians has Annabeth see them later in the story.





 33  Percy’s Life At Yancy Academy Is Not As Detailed In The TV Show 
Disney&#43;&#39;s Percy Jackson show highlights less of his life as part of a boarding school.
        

The original story of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief shows more of Percy&#39;s life at boarding school before he is expelled. Some scenes in the book at Yancy Academy involve Percy waking in his dorm room and eavesdropping on Grover and Mr. Brunner as they discuss Alecto&#39;s attack and what will happen to Percy. That said, these sequences are not in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1, instead moving straight from Alecto&#39;s reveal to Percy&#39;s expulsion and subsequent return to his mom&#39;s apartment.





 32  Percy Jackson’s Stepfather Gabe Is Not As Abusive In The Disney&#43; Show 
Gabe is more of a deadbeat character in Percy Jackson and the Olympians rather than the awful, abusive partner he is in the book.
        

The character of Gabe Ugliano, Percy&#39;s stepfather, has some differences between Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief&#39;s original story and Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1. In the original book, it is hinted that Gabe is much more abusive than Percy realized, including a scene in which Gabe raises his hand and Sally flinches. However, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 does not include these hints at Gabe&#39;s physically abusive tendencies, showing Sally as having much more agency over her husband with Gabe being more of a deadbeat, comedic character at his expense.





 31  Percy Jackson Believes His Father To Be Dead In The Book, But Not In The Show 
Percy&#39;s perception of his father has been changed from book to screen.
        

In the book on which the season is based, Percy believes his father to be dead 

Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 1 shows Percy resenting his father for being absent, though he assumes he is alive. In the book on which the season is based, Percy believes his father to be dead. This is a subtle change from the books but betters the character of Percy and the overall arc he undergoes concerning Poseidon, as it will give the two a more heated dynamic upon their meeting for the first time in the show.





 30  Camp Half-Blood’s Security Director Argus Is Not In The Percy Jackson Show 
A difficult character from the book could not be adequately translated on-screen.
        

One of the characters whom many book readers assumed would be difficult to adapt is Argus, Camp Half-Blood&#39;s director of security. The reason for this stems from Argus&#39; design in the books, that being a regular man only with eyes all over his body. It was announced shortly before Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; premiere that, despite being in the script for the show, Argus was not part of the adaptation due to budgetary constraints as a result of the high cost that his design would raise.
            
 
 Percy Jackson Season 1 Won&#39;t Feature One Camp Half-Blood Character (Despite Being In Show&#39;s Scripts) 
Despite being in the scripts, there is one major character that Percy Jackson season 1 won&#39;t be featuring, due to budgetary constraints.









 29  The Gods&#39; Healing Objects Ambrosia &amp; Nectar Are Not In The Percy Jackson Show 
A smaller albeit commonly recurring element of the books is yet to be shown in Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson.
        

An aspect of Greek mythology that is an ingrained part of the Percy Jackson books is the food and drink of the gods: ambrosia and nectar. These two substances are used as healing agents for demigods and hold the taste of whatever the person ingesting the food or drink feels closely connected to. However, ambrosia and nectar are not found in Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; episodes 1 and 2. This could be either to add tension to the show as ambrosia and nectar can heal almost any injury or that the godly substances will be found later in season 1.





 28  Annabeth &amp; Percy’s Relationship Is Altered Somewhat In The Percy Jackson Show 
Percy Jackson&#39;s central duo has a different origin than in The Lightning Thief.


 







In the original book of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Annabeth is the character who gives Percy a tour around Camp Half-Blood, introducing him to various characters and the activities of the camp. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, this role is given to Luke Castellan. Percy and Annabeth only speak a few times before Percy is claimed by Poseidon, a slight difference from the book where they have already become somewhat familiar with one another.





 27  Percy Jackson’s Dyslexia &amp; ADHD Are Not Mentioned In The Disney&#43; Show 
Percy&#39;s hyperactive and learning disorders are not outlined in the Percy Jackson adaptation.
        

An interesting fact about the origins of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief is that author Rick Riordan wrote it for his son who found it difficult to concentrate in school due to ADHD and dyslexia. As such, Riordan wrote the story of Greek gods and monsters with its titular hero having both disorders. Percy&#39;s ADHD was said to be a symptom of his Greek battle reflexes, while his dyslexia was due to his brain being hard-wired for ancient Greek, not English. Despite these two disorders being repeatedly mentioned in the book, Percy Jackson and the Olympians episodes 1 and 2 do not make overt mentions of either one.





 26  Camp Half-Blood’s Beaded Necklaces Are Not Mentioned In The Show 
The book&#39;s iconic beaded necklaces can be seen, but are not mentioned, in Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show.
        

One of the standout aspects of Camp Half-Blood in the original Percy Jackson books is the beaded necklaces campers receive. At the end of each year, campers are given a bead that represents their time at Camp Half-Blood over the last 12 months, with Percy noticing in The Lightning Thief that Annabeth and Luke have several, explaining their long stay at camp. While these beaded necklaces can be spotted in Percy Jackson and the Olympians, they are never overtly mentioned in the show and will likely be saved for the final episode when Percy receives his first bead.





 25  The Concept Of Glory/Kleos Is New For The Percy Jackson Show 
Percy Jackson&#39;s show is not afraid to make additions to the books where necessary.


 







Easily one of the more intriguing elements of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2 was Luke&#39;s mention of kleos, the Greek word for glory. Luke mentions to Percy that feats of strength, quests, defeating monsters, or regular skill will attribute glory to a demigod&#39;s name. This glory makes them more threatening to monsters, more noticeable by the gods, and overall more powerful in their abilities. This is a completely new concept for Percy Jackson and the Olympians that was not found in any of the original books.
While quests and battles gain glory in the books, the idea of Kleos is not overtly mentioned as much as it is in the Percy Jackson show. 






 24  A Hellhound Does Not Attack Percy Before He Is Claimed In The Disney&#43; Show 
Percy&#39;s claiming by Poseidon goes slightly differently in the TV show.
        

In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 2, Percy is claimed by his father Poseidon shortly after defeating Clarisse and winning Capture the Flag. This is the same in The Lightning Thief, only with one major element being present in the latter. After winning Capture the Flag in the book, Percy is attacked by a Hellhound that was summoned into camp by a demigod. Chiron defeats the monster, leading to Percy&#39;s father claiming him. This aspect is left out of the show, likely for nothing other than pacing reasons.





 23  The Big Three Pact In Percy Jackson&#39;s Show Does Not Mention The Books&#39; World War II Implications 
Some aspects of Percy Jackson&#39;s story are purposefully being left for future seasons.


 







Perhaps the most consequential element of Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; overarching story is the pact of the Big Three. These three gods - Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades - promised to stop having children as they were becoming too powerful, though every few decades one of the gods would ignore this leading to a forbidden child, like Percy. This is taken directly from the books, though one change for the TV show is that the real-world implications of the Big Three pact are not mentioned.
            
 
 All 11 Greek Gods In Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson TV Show Explained 
Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson and the Olympians TV show, which covers Rick Riordan&#39;s The Lightning Thief and its sequels, features multiple Greek gods.




In The Lightning Thief, it is explained that this pact came to be in the 1940s as a direct response to World War II. WWII is changed in the Percy Jackson books as a war between the children of Zeus and Poseidon on one side (the Allies) and Hades on the other (the Axis). That said, these details are not mentioned in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episodes 1 and 2, making for a fairly big book change that could rear its head in future seasons.





 22  Percy Spends More Time At Camp Before His Quest In The Book 
Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3 brings more subtle changes to the original book.
        

In the original story of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief, Poseidon&#39;s claiming of Percy results in a more negative reaction toward the hero. He spends a few more days at camp, being pushed harder by Luke in training because he is a child of the Big Three and being ignored by most other campers. The book details how the few days after Percy was claimed were miserable before he embarks on his quest. In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, Percy sets out on his quest almost instantly.





 21  The Oracle Depicts Gabe Slightly Different In The Percy Jackson TV Show 
The Oracle scene only has one minor difference from the original book.
        

The scene involving Percy receiving a quest from the Oracle in Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3 is mostly accurate to the book, only with one minor change. In the show, the Oracle takes the form of solely Gabe, Percy&#39;s stepfather, to deliver the prophecy. In the book, the Oracle takes the form of Gabe and a few of his friends who are depicted playing poker. Each line of the prophecy is uttered by each one of the men, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#39; TV show instead opting to just have Gabe deliver the lines.





 20  Percy Chooses Annabeth For The Quest In The Disney Show Rather Than Her Volunteering 
Disney&#39;s Percy Jackson show presents the titular hero with a group of companion candidates for his quest.
        

In Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3, Percy is presented with various companion candidates for his quest by Chiron. These include Luke, Clarisse, and Annabeth among others. In the show, Percy directly chooses Annabeth over the other characters. This differs from the book in which Annabeth directly volunteers to embark on the quest with Percy.





 19  Percy’s Quest Is Given Less Detail In The Disney&#43; TV Show 
Percy&#39;s quest receives a group of minor details in the book that are not present in the show.
        

Concerning Percy&#39;s quest, some details are included in the Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief book that are not present in the show. One reason that is used to explain why Percy is sent on the quest for the master bolt is that he has been having dreams of Zeus and Poseidon fighting. This alerts Chiron to the fact that Percy was meant to go on the quest, something that is left out of Percy Jackson and the Olympians episode 3.
The book explains more about why the gods hate each other and also why Hades would want to steal the bolt. 

Similarly, the Percy Jackson book delves more into the Big Three gods. The book explains more about why the gods hate each other and also why Hades would want to steal the bolt. These bits of information are not exactly vital for the story and are just extra details, explaining why Disney&#43;&#39;s Percy Jackson and the Olympian left them out.





 18  Why Percy Chooses Annabeth &amp; Grover For The Quest Is Different In The Show 
Percy&#39;s choice of Annabeth and Grover for his companions is given more detail in the TV show.


 







In the original Percy Jackson books, little reasoning is given for why Percy picks Annabeth and Grover for his quest. In the show, this is tied into the lines of the prophecy. The third line of the prophecy states &#34;You will be betrayed by one who calls you friend.&#34; This leads Percy to think about how he can avoid this coming true. He therefore picks Annabeth as he does not see any way they will ever be friends, and picks Grover as he trusts him with his life.
