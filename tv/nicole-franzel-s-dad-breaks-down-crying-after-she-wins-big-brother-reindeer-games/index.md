## Literature Review
Nicole Franzel won the inaugural edition of Big Brother Reindeer Games, and her family is very shocked over the outcome because she lied to them.




Nicole Franzel&#39;s family had no idea that she won Big Brother Reindeer Games, and her husband Victor Arroyo captured the heartwarming moment they all found out. Nicole has competed on Big Brother multiple times over the years, starting with Big Brother 16 in 2014. She was unanimously evicted but managed to win her way back into the house but was once again unanimously evicted and joined the jury. She finally triumphed upon her return on Big Brother 18 and won the grand prize. Unfortunately, she wasn&#39;t able to win again during Big Brother 22, where she landed in third place. However, the tide turned back in her favor in Big Brother Reindeer Games season 1.




Unlike the regular Big Brother series, Reindeer Games is not live, so the contestants have been able to share their thoughts on social media throughout the season. Nicole, Victor and their family gathered to watch the Reindeer Games season 1 finale together. Victor posted a video that revealed everyone&#39;s reactions as they saw that Nicole won the whole competition.


 

The star of the video was Nicole&#39;s father, who turned to her with surprise and said, &#34;Oh, you won?&#34; He then took off his glasses and wiped his eyes as he got very emotional, as did Victor. Everyone in the room was shocked, and she told them she &#34;didn&#39;t want to tell anybody.&#34; According to the caption on Victor&#39;s Instagram post, Nicole lied and told him she came in second place, which is why even her husband expressed such shock.





 Nicole Franzel Proves She&#39;s A Big Brother Legend 
          

&#34;I had instant tears in my eyes...This is our genuine reaction to seeing her win,&#34; Victor concluded his post. What makes his reaction even better is that Nicole was still lying to him mere seconds before her family found out she won. While the audio is quieter at this point, the video starts with Victor asking Nicole if she actually won, and she responded, &#34;No.&#34; Cut to a few seconds later and her entire family can&#39;t believe what they just witnessed.

As Victor also noted in his Instagram post, Nicole came into Big Brother Reindeer Games with nothing to prove. She had already proven that she&#39;s a Big Brother legend, having already won the show back in 2016. Almost two years ago, she announced that her reality TV career was over so she could focus on her family. That&#39;s why it came as a surprise that she decided to return for Reindeer Games.




Reality competition shows run deep in both Nicole and Victor&#39;s lives. As mentioned, Nicole has been on Big Brother four times now. The two of them met during Big Brother 18, though their relationship didn&#39;t begin until after the show. Nicole and Victor teamed up for The Amazing Race season 31 but were eliminated in fourth place. It&#39;s possible that Nicole returned to reality TV because Big Brother Reindeer Games was such a short season and it wouldn&#39;t take her away from her family for weeks or months at a time. It&#39;ll be interesting to see if this latest win energizes her enough to want to keep returning to other competition shows.
