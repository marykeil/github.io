Summary
 Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 retcons three Monsterverse movies by making the Hollow Earth storyline a central plot point. 
 Bill Randa, not Dr. Houston Brooks, came up with the Hollow Earth theory first, contradicting previous information from Kong: Skull Island. 
 Monarch had knowledge and proof of the existence of the Hollow Earth before the events of Godzilla: King of the Monsters, contrary to what was previously known. 


The Hollow Earth storyline set up by Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 retcons not one, but three Monsterverse movies. The Hollow Earth has been the foundation for three of the four films in Godzilla and Kong&#39;s cinematic universe. And now, it&#39;s driving the story of Apple TV&#43;&#39;s Godzilla spinoff as well.
After various teases pointing to the Hollow Earth becoming crucial to the fabric of the series, the underground realm of the Titans emerged as an integral part of the plot in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8. That became the case when three of the Monarch: Legacy of Monsters characters fell into the Hollow Earth entry point in Kazakhstan. Were the show set in the present, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising for the Hollow Earth to be so important to the narrative, considering that it&#39;s at the heart of the Monsterverse&#39;s Titan mythology. However, the show&#39;s placement in the Monsterverse timeline complicates its use of the concept.









 








 3  Kong: Skull Island 
Bill Randa came up with the Hollow Earth theory first
        

In Kong: Skull Island, it was understood that the Hollow Earth theory was developed by Dr. Houston Brooks and supported by Bill Randa. Brooks supposedly came up with the central principals behind the theory, which Randa agreed with and hoped to prove by arranging an expedition to Skull Island. Interestingly, Monarch: Legacy of Monsters contradicts this aspect of their backstories by revealing that it was really Bill Randa who thought of the concept first, not Brooks. The scene with Bill watching the bug crawl through the hole in the world map highlights the very moment Bill embraced the notion of an underground world.
The decision to credit Randa for the framework of the Hollow Earth theory raises questions about Houston Brooks&#39; importance. It&#39;s possible that while this does amount to a signifcant retcon to the timeline of events pertaining to the discovery of Hollow Earth, it doesn&#39;t render Brooks&#39; contributions meaningless. While Randa may have theorized the existence of a secret world underneath the surface, it may be that he didn&#39;t understand the exact science of how such a thing could be possible until he met Brooks.





 2  Godzilla: King Of The Monsters 
Monarch had proof the Hollow Earth existed before 2019
        

Godzilla: King of the Monsters built on Kong: Skull Island&#39;s Hollow Earth theory by having the characters discover a tunnel under the ocean that led them to Godzilla&#39;s hidden lair and a long-abandoned city that once worshipped him. Exchanges between Dr. Chen and Dr. Stanton treated the idea of the Hollow Earth as an unproven theory about a system of tunnels used by the Titans of the Monsterverse. What this indicates is that Monarch was aware of the concept, but didn&#39;t have definitive proof yet.
After Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8, Monarch&#39;s limited knowledge of the Hollow Earth in Godzilla: King of the Monsters no longer makes sense. After all, the show confirms that Monarch was aware of &#34;rifts&#34; and tunnels that lead underground by 2015, four years before the events of the film. What&#39;s more, three people fell into one of these access points. And since Shaw has said that he has repeatedly warned Monarch about what&#39;s coming, it stands to reason that the organization isn&#39;t in the dark when it comes to the Hollow Earth&#39;s existence.





 1  Godzilla vs. Kong 
At least one human traveled to the secret Hollow Earth world before Godzilla vs. Kong


 







The scene where APEX and Monarch&#39;s team successfully passed through the rift and reached the hidden Hollow Earth world in Godzilla vs. Kong was presented as an unprecedented accomplishment for humanity and a breakthrough of epic proportions. Monarch: Legacy of Monsters episode 8 calls into question just how special this moment really was. In a shocking development, Lee Shaw confessed to Cate that he&#39;s been to the world of the Titans. The idea that Godzilla vs. Kong&#39;s humans weren&#39;t the first people in modern history to go down there is quite possibly the biggest twist the series has offered yet.
Lee Shaw&#39;s big reveal in Monarch: Legacy of Monsters goes to show that Apple TV&#43;&#39;s series isn&#39;t letting the timeline hold it back from leaving its mark on the Monsterverse. The thought of someone having been there decades before Godzilla vs. Kong goes against all pre-established notions regarding Monarch&#39;s connection to the Hollow Earth, but also opens the door for additional discoveries down the line. A deeper dive into Lee Shaw&#39;s past in the show&#39;s remaining episodes can yield eye-opening reveals about the Hollow Earth that can help shape the story of future movies, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire included.
Monarch: Legacy of Monsters releases new episodes on Apple TV&#43; on Fridays.
