## Literature Review

Noah Hawley opens up about the current status of the Alien TV series, revealing that filming on the show is set to resume soon following a pause.




Alien TV series showrunner Noah Hawley offers new insight into the current status of the show&#39;s production. The upcoming sci-fi show will be the first major expansion into the television format, telling a new tale set three decades before the events of the 1979 horror classic. The Alien TV series stars Sydney Chandler, Alex Lawther, Samuel Blenkin, Essie Davis, Adarsh Gourav, Kit Young, and Timothy Olyphant as a group of Earthbound characters set to become entangled in the terrifying legacy of the Xenomorphs.




As Hawley discussed Fargo season 5 with Variety, the showrunner briefly touched on the current status of his Alien prequel TV series following the production&#39;s pause in August 2023 because of the SAG-AFTRA strike. Hawley reiterated his hopes that filming in Thailand would resume soon, revealing that he expected to be taking the flight back soon after the awards season wrapped. Check out Hawley&#39;s full response below:


We’re going to restart very soon. Everyone’s getting on planes as soon as this awards season is over. I’ll be getting my eye mask out and getting on those long planes around the world. We’ll blow the dust off the sets from last year, and get going.



 What Will The Alien TV Show Be About? 
          

While two upcoming Alien projects are in the works, it is believed that neither project will share any larger, overarching narrative threads and will instead be separate tales. Alongside Hawley&#39;s series, Fede Alvarez&#39;s Alien: Romulus is currently preparing for its 2024 summer release. However, both projects will cover separate eras, with Hawley&#39;s show being a prequel and Alien: Romulus being set in the 57 years between Alien and Aliens. The Alien TV series will also be separate from prior prequels, including Prometheus and Alien: Covenant, with the showrunner wanting to return to the aesthetics and mythology of earlier movies.




                  Alien Movies In Order (Release &amp; Chronological)   From Ridley Scott&#39;s Alien to the sci-fi franchise&#39;s prequel series beginning with Prometheus, here&#39;s how to watch the Alien movies in order.   

Instead, the Alien TV series is set 30 years before the Nostromo crew would come in contact with the Xenomorph, set on Earth in 2092. While it is currently unknown what will bring the cast of CEOs, soldiers, and synthetic beings together, their encounter with Xenomorphs could tell Wayland-Yutani&#39;s first encounter with the beings, depending on the canon of previous expanded media and features, including the Alien VS. Predator series. As such, the series could explain why claiming a specimen was vital to the company and why they would invest heavily in such efforts in the movies.

Being the franchise&#39;s first step into the television format, the Alien show has the difficult task of translating the franchise&#39;s terror and beloved elements to the small screen. The series initially continued filming throughout the early months of the SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes without the contributions of several cast members and Hawley, and this caused concerns about whether the quality could be impacted. However, with Hawley confident going into the production&#39;s return, this update at least brings some ease about the franchise&#39;s future and raises anticipation for the show.






The Alien TV series currently has no release window but will be released through FX on Hulu, while Alien: Romulus will be released in theaters on August 16.
