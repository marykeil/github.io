# The Family Chantel Signs Nicole Jimeno Turned Into A Monster


## SUMMARY 



  Nicole Jimeno has consistently exhibited unlikable behavior throughout her appearances on The Family Chantel, making her one of the show&#39;s biggest antagonists.   Despite her attempts to build an online presence, Nicole has been unable to shake her villain label, largely due to her disrespectful treatment of her former sister-in-law, Chantel.   Nicole&#39;s actions have shown her to be greedy, coldhearted, and willing to stoop to any level to create drama and undermine her brother&#39;s relationship with Chantel. She even used her former friend, Coraima, to hurt Chantel and cause problems in their marriage.

## Literature Review
The Family Chantel’s Nicole Jimeno is one of the worst sisters-in-laws in the 90 Day Fiancé franchise. She takes joy in Chantel Everett’s misfortune.




Nicole Jimeno has gone from being unlikable to unbearable in the last five seasons of The Family Chantel. The 29-year-old appeared as a supporting cast member on 90 Day Fiancé. She accompanied her brother, Pedro Jimeno, as he navigated through his relationship with Chantel Everett. Nicole wasn’t a fan-favorite from the get-go. She was jealous of her sister-in-law, which wasn&#39;t the best look for her. Over the years, Nicole caused many family arguments, becoming one of the biggest antagonists of The Family Chantel.




Following her contemptible actions, Nicole appeared alongside her mother, Lidia Morel, in 90 Day Fiancé: Love In Paradise. Once again, she tried her best to stay in the limelight. In 2023, Nicole made her latest appearance in The Family Chantel season 5. The Dominican Republic native joined the spin-off to celebrate her brother’s failed relationship with Chantel. She also appeared in the season to watch after her mother, who had reconciled with Scott Wern. Nicole did all she could to sabotage her mom’s relationship.

While Nicole has done her best to build an online presence, she hasn’t been able to shed her villain label. One reason for this is her behavior toward other people, especially her former sister-in-law, Chantel. Nicole never accepted her brother’s marriage; instead, she tried to ruin it for him and made fun of Chantel. In a previous season, Nicole taunted Chantel and said, “she thinks she’s a princess, an actress, she lives in a castle,” before labeling her crazy. In the later months, Nicole proceeded to copy Chantel from her style to her attitude.

In The Family Chantel season 5, Nicole did the unthinkable when she described Chantel’s looks in the most vulgar manner. She talked about Chantel&#39;s behind and claimed that her brother fell for her “gelatinous” curves because he was a virgin. Nicole is a hypocrite for criticizing Chantel since she is now copying her style and fashion. Over the seasons, Nicole has been accused of trying to imitate Chantel’s looks and style. From her beachside photos to her clothes, social media users have the evidence to believe that Nicole wants to be Chantel.






 Nicole Jimeno Seems Greedy &amp; Coldhearted 
         

Overall, Nicole comes off as a very cold person. However, her behavior over the last few seasons proves she’s even worse than anyone expected. Chantel came to Lidia and Nicole during The Family Chantel season 4 to seek help. She apologized to them and started discussing her relationship with Pedro. However, Nicole didn’t let her speak at all. Instead, she shouted at Chantel and undermined her concerns. She said, “I’m just telling you that I am sick of hearing you say the same thing over and over again.” She kept poking Chantel until she stormed off. Right after, Nicole laughed hysterically.

Nicole also appears greedy and expects Pedro to provide for her and her mother. At the same time, she tried to pick fights with him and made life very hard for him. In a previous season, Nicole got angry that Pedro didn’t treat her former boyfriend right and was stirring the pot. She told Chantel and her family that “Pedro had sex with Coraima” just to make the situation worse. She didn’t care that her allegations could create endless marital problems for her brother and his then-wife. She simply smiled, rejoiced, and did it for her inner satisfaction.




                  The Family Chantel Season 5: When Is The Finale &amp; How Many Episodes Are Left?   Fans should buckle up to watch Pedro Jimeno and Chantel Everett’s dramatic post-split life in the upcoming episodes of The Family Chantel season 5.    



 Nicole Jimeno Used Coraima Morla To Hurt Chantel Everett 
         

Nicole had used the name of her former friend, Coraima, to hurt Chantel more than once. She was once very close with her neighbor and even discussed her relationship issues with her. At the time, Nicole used Coraima to make Chantel uncomfortable. Since Coraima had been friends with Nicole and Pedro for years, it made the allegations believable. Moreover, Pedro’s ashamed look and denial also added to Chantel’s suspicions, which continued in The Family Chantel season 5. Pedro and Chantel could’ve had one less problem to deal with if Nicole didn&#39;t meddle in their marriage.




In another episode, Nicole tells Chantel that Pedro had danced with Coraima when he visited them in the Dominican Republic. She brought Coraima along and made sure the situation turned into an argument. As expected, things got tense when Chantel insinuated that Coraima was a sex worker. This caused the ladies to get into a physical fight before Pedro intervened. Nicole did the wrong thing by using her friend in such a manner. She should’ve kept Coraima out of the drama instead of looping herself into Pedro’s life.



 Nicole Jimeno’s Happy That Chantel &amp; Pedro Divorced 
         

Nicole didn’t just try to ruin Pedro and Chantel’s relationship from the start, but she also relished every breakdown, argument, and tear that fell from Chantel&#39;s face. From her dirty schemes to her plots and accusations, Nicole crossed the line numerous times in Pedro and Chantel&#39;s relationship. She took joy in shutting Chantel down and tried everything she could to ruin her mood. Most sisters want to see their siblings happy and successful, but Nicole feels satisfied by making Pedro feel worse.




Nicole showed her true colors in The Family Chantel season 5 when she celebrated Pedro and Chantel’s breakup. She didn’t just seem happy but was very content that she was one of the catalysts in Pedro and Chantel&#39;s divorce. Nicole shared her happiness in front of the cameras in one of the newer episodes. She said, “we feel so good for him because now he is a free man.” Nicole claimed she was excited that her brother could meet better-looking women than Chantel and looked the happiest she&#39;s ever been in the last seven years.



The Family Chantel airs Mondays at 9 p.m. EST on TLC.
