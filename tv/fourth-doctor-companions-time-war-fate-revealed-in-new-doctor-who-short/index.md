## Literature Review
A  new trailer for Doctor Who&#39;s &#34;The Collection: Season 15&#34; home release visits the Time War to reveal the fate of Louise Jameson&#39;s companion Leela.




Doctor Who revisits the final days of the Last Great Time War, as the trailer for &#34;Doctor Who - The Collection: Season 15&#34; depicts how Fourth Doctor companion Leela (Louise Jameson) spent the final moments of the conflict. Jameson traveled with Tom Baker&#39;s incarnation of the Time Lord from 1977 to 1978, making her debut in the season 14 story &#34;The Face of Evil&#34;. A warrior from the tribe of the Sevateen, Leela&#39;s travels with the Doctor gave her a greater perspective on what the universe can offer.




While most &#34;The Collection&#34; trailers released on Doctor Who&#39;s YouTube channel have explored all-new adventures of familiar companions and foes, the trailer for season 15&#39;s home release instead revisits the final days of one of Doctor Who&#39;s most destructive conflicts in &#34;The Final Battle&#34;, as seen in &#34;The Day of the Doctor&#34;.


 

Overlooking the under-siege capital of Gallifrey from a cliff during the Time War, Commander Leela is approached by Gallifreyan Soldier Axton (Dushane Keogh-Grenade), who hands her a teleportation device to escape on behalf of an unseen incarnation of the Doctor. Axton is suddenly struck down by a Dalek, leaving Leela to fend off a squadron led by the Supreme Dalek (Nicholas Briggs).


 How Did Leela Spend Her Life On Gallifrey? 
          




Leela parted ways with the Doctor in 1978&#39;s six-part serial &#34;The Invasion of Time&#34;, where the pair stopped a plot by the Sontarans to assume control over Gallifrey itself. With the Sontaran invasion force vanquished, the Fourth Doctor left Leela on Gallifrey with the rest of the Time Lords, as she had fallen for Citadel Guard Commander Andred (Chris Tranchell). With K-9 (John Leeson) by her side, Leela had a new life on Gallifrey, with her and Andred marrying at some point between her last meeting with the Fourth Doctor and the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davidson) Doctor Who adventure &#34;Arc of Infinity&#34; showing the Time Lord regretting that he missed their wedding.

                  Doctor Who: The 10 Best Fourth Doctor And K9 Stories, Ranked According To IMDb   The Fourth Doctor and K9 develop one of the most memorable companion pairings across many episodes of Doctor Whoâ€™s classic series.    

While Jameson would only have one later on-screen appearance in the 1993 Children In Need special &#34;Dimensions In Time&#34;, Doctor Who&#39;s expanded media would take the character&#39;s adventures on Gallifrey and lead into her involvement in the Time War. Joining fellow Fourth Doctor companion Romana (Lalla Ward), the Gallifrey audio-drama saw the pair tackle civil wars, and alternate dimensions as she acted as an agent of the Time Lords, before leading into the events of the Time War in Gallifrey: Time War and Gallifrey: War Room.




While Classic Doctor Who&#39;s companion&#39;s later lives have been explored in past &#34;The Collection&#34; trailers and the spinoff Tales of the TARDIS, Leela&#39;s fate was one of the most uncertain. Given her presence on Gallifrey, it had been unknown whether she had survived the conflict, let alone lived until the final day. However, thanks to one of the Doctor&#39;s interventions, Leela of the Sevateen lives on to further battle the evils of the cosmos.



Leela&#39;s classic Doctor Who adventure are streaming on BritBox.
