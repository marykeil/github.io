Summary

  John Ridley&#39;s abandoned Marvel TV show for ABC was meant to be an Eternals series, but it never moved forward.   Ridley&#39;s version of the Eternals would have been &#34;a really weird story&#34; and allowed for more depth in the characters.   The Eternals movie had the challenge of introducing a large cast of unfamiliar characters in a short period of time, unlike Ridley&#39;s planned TV show.  





John Ridley has revealed the characters that he would have introduced in the Marvel Cinematic Universe TV show that he was working on for ABC in 2015. Prior to the MCU TV shows on Disney&#43;, ABC was one of the primary destinations for Marvel series, including Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter. For several years, there was a mysterious MCU TV show being developed by Ridley that was said to be a reinvention of a certain Marvel property. However, it never went forward.




After several years of not hearing about the MCU TV show he was working on, Ridley finally opened up about what his project was meant to be for ABC. During an appearance on the Comic Book Club podcast, Ridley confirmed it was, in fact, an Eternals TV show that he was developing before it became an MCU Phase 4 movie, sharing the following:


[It is] not in the works anymore, [but] was a television version of the Eternals, but good. There was my version, a good version, which is good to me…. which doesn’t mean anything. There was the version that [Marvel] ended up doing which… I don’t think that version was particularly good — I’ll be honest — and for all kinds of reasons.

 How John Ridley&#39;s Eternals Show Would&#39;ve Been Different From The MCU Movie 
Weirder And More Character Focused 
         




If Eternals had moved forward as a television series on ABC, Ridley went on to explain that it would have been &#34;a really weird story about these people.&#34; According to Ridley, the Eternals pilot would have opened with a teenager putting a power drill to his ear and pushing it in, which in itself is a strange way to start a new show. In the podcast, Ridley goes on to talk about what else he would have included in the show, with the focus clearly being on how weird he wanted to get with it. 



It was so f**king weird. My version started with, the first thing you see is a young man, probably about 18 years old. And he’s sitting there. He’s sitting there for a moment. And then he lifts his hands. He has a drill in it. And he turns the drill on. And he puts the drill to his ear. And he starts pushing it in. And then it goes from there. That’s the start, right? That’s how it starts. And then I think you see… another kid… He sleeps in the bathtub, covers himself with foil. It’s just a really weird story about these people who are, I mean, it’s just weird.






Beyond this, not many more details were revealed in the podcast - although it&#39;s clear that the show would have been focused heavily on character development, and would have been significantly less commercial than the film. Ridley said that he did not see the &#39;bones&#39; of his plans in the film, and that his version probably &#34;needed to be a little bit more popular.&#34; In terms of how many episodes, had the show gone ahead, Eternals would have likely started with 13 episodes ordered by ABC, given the obscurity of that property.



 A TV Series Would Have Been Better Than A Movie 
Introducing An Entirely New Ensemble Is More TV-Appropriate
          

While only Ridley knows the full Eternals TV show story details in depth, his series would likely also have allowed these characters to be more fleshed out. One of the big problems with the Eternals movie was that the audience was introduced to a whole slew of characters they had never met before, which is a lot to take in. Usually, with MCU projects, there is an established character from other movies or shows that acts as the eyes and ears for the audience as they get introduced to new heroes or villains.






Eternals 2 has not officially been announced by Marvel, and it is unclear when the characters may appear next in the MCU.




Even though Eternals may not have happened on ABC, it would have been intriguing to see what Ridley was planning to do with the characters before their MCU movie debut. Time will tell if Ridley ever shares more specific plot details about his Eternals TV show. Hopefully, Ridley will get another shot at an MCU property down the line for Marvel Studios.
