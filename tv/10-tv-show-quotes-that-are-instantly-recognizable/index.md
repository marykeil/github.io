## Literature Review
TV series are a rich source of lines that have become so popular that they have gained a life of their own — Joey&#39;s &#34;How you doin&#39;?&#34; is one example.




Once a TV show enters the mainstream, certain quotes from it are quick to join pop culture. These lines become deeply ingrained in the collective memory, so that even people who haven&#39;t seen the series know at least one specific quote from it. In the case of cult classics like Friends, there are usually several lines that have turned into everyday vocabulary. For instance, Joey&#39;s &#34;How you doin&#39;?&#34; catchphrase, which originates a lot later in the show than it feels, has long transcended its show and is now a well-known pickup line all over the world.
While some phrases, such as Joey Tribbiani&#39;s line, work perfectly in plenty of social situations, others may not make much sense outside the familiar context of the series, and yet it does not stop them from becoming iconic. Seasons in Game of Thrones&#39; Westeros work in mysterious ways, and Ned Stark&#39;s &#34;Winter is coming&#34; warning means a great deal in the show. Nonetheless, the line has picked up a whole new meaning in the real world, and there are not many people who haven&#39;t heard or used this phrase for this or that reason.
            
 
 10 Best TV Shows Based On Movies, Ranked 
Surprisingly, some of the best TV shows, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, aren&#39;t exactly originals, as they are based on movies.













 








 10  &#34;How You Doin&#39;?&#34; 
Friends


 







 Friends 

 Cast   Jennifer Aniston , Courteney Cox , Lisa Kudrow , Matt LeBlanc , Matthew Perry , David Schwimmer    Seasons   10    




Friends&#39; Joey Tribbiani was the IT ladies man of the 1990s. He was funny, caring, charismatic — and he knew a few great pickup lines and stories. His legendary &#34;How you doin&#39;?&#34;, said in a specific intonation for the first time in season 4, episode 13, &#34;The One With Rachel&#39;s Crush,&#34; helped Joey in the romance department on more than one occasion, to the point that the catchphrase turned into a running joke on the show and outside it. The second someone hears or says &#34;How you doin&#39;?&#34;, the conversation becomes better solely because of a little piece of Friends added to it.





 9  &#34;Winter Is Coming.&#34; 
Game of Thrones
        

 Game Of Thrones 

 Cast   Emilia Clarke , Lena Headey , Richard Madden , Michelle Fairley , Kit Harington , Maisie Williams , Alfie Allen , Peter Dinklage    Seasons   8    




Game of Thrones transformed the TV scenery upon its release in 2011. Interestingly enough, the show&#39;s most famous line came with its very first episode, both in the title and in Ned Stark&#39;s warning. &#34;Winter is coming&#34; was meant to serve as a reminder that darker times were coming, and that everyone, especially the Starks, should be ready to face them. The line has become immensely popular. It is now used to announce that hardships are nigh, and even those who aren&#39;t familiar with the show understand the reference quite easily.





 8  &#34;It&#39;s Gonna Be Legen... Wait For It... Dary!&#34; 
How I Met Your Mother
        

 How I Met Your Mother 

 Cast   Josh Radnor , Jason Segel , Cobie Smulders , Neil Patrick Harris , Alyson Hannigan , Bob Saget    Seasons   9    




How I Met Your Mother&#39;s Barney delivered some of the best lines on the show, but his iconic &#34;It&#39;s gonna be legen... wait for it... dary!&#34; and its variations were the most memorable. Barney liked to hype up the various upcoming events in his life with this phrase, especially if they involved getting Ted to join him on his wild quests. Barney&#39;s quote outlived How I Met Your Mother, as even a decade after it ended, the line continues to thrive in people&#39;s minds. Some of Barney&#39;s deeds may not have aged well, but his catchphrase has grown to be the definition of living in the moment.





 7  &#34;Identity Theft Is Not A Joke, Jim.&#34; 
The Office


 







 The Office 

 Cast   Mindy Kaling , Jenna Fischer , Kate Flannery , Ed Helms , Craig Robinson , Paul Lieberstein , Ellie Kemper , B.J. Novak , Angela Kinsey , Oscar Nunez , Rainn Wilson , Brian Baumgartner , Phyllis Smith , Leslie David Baker , Creed Bratton , Steve Carell , John Krasinski    Seasons   9    




Of all Jim Halpert&#39;s relationships in The Office, his frenemy dynamic with Dwight Schrute was arguably the most entertaining to watch. In season 3, episode 20, &#34;Product Recall,&#34; Jim played the ultimate prank on Dwight by dressing up as him, coming to work, and waiting until his victim noticed. Dwight eventually caught up and reacted to the infuriating joke by saying, &#34;Identity theft is not a joke, Jim!&#34; This phrase was never meant to have as long-lasting an impact as it ended up having, but to this day, it is one of the lines that The Office is instantly recognizable for. In all seriousness, Dwight&#39;s comment rings true: identity theft is no joke.





 6  &#34;Allons-y!&#34; 
Doctor Who
        

 Doctor Who 

 Cast   Jenna Coleman , Jodie Whittaker , Alex Kingston , David Tennant , Matt Smith , Peter Capaldi    Seasons   26    




With Doctor Who season 14 closing in, Ncuti Gatwa&#39;s Fifteenth Doctor is getting all the attention. However, that doesn&#39;t mean David Tennant&#39;s Doctor — either of them — is forgotten. Both the Tenth and the Fourteenth Doctors were known for their catchphrase &#34;Allons-y!&#34;, which is French for &#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; The Time Lord used this line whenever they were egging themselves or their companions on to go on the next adventure. Doctor Who characters have had quite a lot of catchy lines, but Tennant&#39;s Doctor with their &#34;Allons-y!&#34; is timeless. Even people who don&#39;t know any French and don&#39;t watch Doctor Who tend to recognize where the line is from.





 5  &#34;Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool.&#34; 
Brooklyn Nine-Nine
        

 Brooklyn Nine-Nine 

 Cast   Stephanie Beatriz , Melissa Fumero , Andy Samberg , Andre Braugher , Joel McKinnon Miller , Dirk Blocker , Terry Crews , Chelsea Peretti , Joe Lo Truglio    Seasons   8    




Jake Peralta&#39;s catchphrase in Brooklyn Nine-Nine was born out of Andy Samberg&#39;s improvisation, but it suited the character incredibly well. Jake would blurt out, &#34;Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool&#34; whenever he found himself in an awkward situation and felt like panicking. The character might have been a professional detective who treated his job seriously, but he was just a child inside. His quirky personality was perfectly summed up with this line, which Jake always said really fast and in an inherently hilarious tone of voice. It is virtually impossible not to resonate with Jake&#39;s most famous quote in similar circumstances.





 4  &#34;Treat Yo&#39; Self!&#34; 
Parks and Recreation


 







 Parks and Recreation 

 Cast   Amy Poehler , Nick Offerman , ​Chris Pratt2 , Aubrey Plaza , Adam Scott , Rashida Jones , Retta , Jim O&#39;Heir , Aziz Ansari , Rob Lowe    Seasons   7    




In Parks and Recreation, all the characters were unhinged in some way, but Tom Haverford, Pawnee&#39;s laziest government worker, was the most unpredictable. Throughout the seasons, Tom did quite a few questionable things, but he was absolutely spot-on when it came to self-care. In season 4, episode 4, &#34;Pawnee Rangers,&#34; Tom and Donna invited Ben to join them on their annual Treat Yo&#39; Self — in other words, self-indulgent — trip, and from that moment on, the &#34;Treat Yo&#39; Self&#34; motto represented Parks and Recreation. Tom&#39;s line is the embodiment of modern self-care because everyone deserves a treat and a break once in a while.





 3  &#34;You Get The Best Of Both Worlds!&#34; 
Hannah Montana
        

Hannah Montana was the Disney show that made leading a double life fun, provided that the secret life was one of an international pop star, not of an FBI agent. Miley Stewart was an ordinary teen girl, but every so often, she put on a blonde wig and went on tour as the mysterious pop sensation by the name of Hannah Montana. The show&#39;s theme song was a source of inspiration, but one line in the chorus, &#34;You get the best of both worlds,&#34; became synonymous with Hannah Montana&#39;s key message of getting the best out of life. The quote is easily recognizable even without the corresponding music.





 2  &#34;Well, Damn, Jackie, I Can&#39;t Control The Weather!&#34; 
That &#39;70s Show
        

 That &#39;70s Show 

 Cast   Topher Grace , Laura Prepon , Mila Kunis , Ashton Kutcher , Wilmer Valderrama , Debra Jo Rupp , Kurtwood Smith , Danny Masterson    Seasons   8    




In That &#39;70s Show season 3, episode 10, &#34;Ice Shack,&#34; Eric and Donna got into a friendly competition with Kelso and Jackie over who was the best couple. At some point, Donna got cold, so Eric offered her his jacket. When Jackie said to her boyfriend that she was freezing too, he frustratingly retorted, &#34;Well, damn, Jackie, I can&#39;t control the weather!&#34; Ashton Kutcher&#39;s comedic delivery was what made the line so hilarious and memorable. Kelso might not have beaten Eric for the best boyfriend title, but he won the most iconic response award. Years pass by, but Kelso&#39;s quote remains the only appropriate response to someone complaining about the weather.





 1  &#34;Who Lives In A Pineapple Under The Sea?&#34; 
SpongeBob SquarePants
        

 SpongeBob SquarePants 

 Cast   Tom Kenny , Bill Fagerbakke , Rodger Bumpass , Clancy Brown , Carlos Alazraqui , Paul Tibbitt , Dee Bradley Baker , Jill Talley , Tim Conway , Sara Paxton , Mark Fite , Mary Jo Catlett , Tom Wilson , Sirena Irwin , Lori Alan , Ernest Borgnine , Mr. Lawrence , Carolyn Lawrence    Seasons   14    




Hannah Montana&#39;s theme song isn&#39;t the only soundtrack that is so legendary that a single line from it is enough for people to recognize the show it is from. If there is one thing that everyone knows about SpongeBob SquarePants from the series of the same title, it is that he lives in a pineapple under the sea, all thanks to the incredibly informative opening sequence. The main character&#39;s imaginative living quarters in SpongeBob SquarePants are common knowledge for generations of people who can give an answer to the question &#34;Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?&#34; in a heartbeat.
