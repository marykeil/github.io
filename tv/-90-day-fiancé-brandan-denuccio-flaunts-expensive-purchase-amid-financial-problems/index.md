## Literature Review

 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Brandan Denuccio is showing off his new expensive purchase after crying about not having money with Mary Demasuay.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Brandan DeNuccio is showing off his pricey new toy on social media after making viewers believe he was facing financial difficulties in season 5. Brandan, 23, from Oregon met the 23-year-old Mary on a dating app two years before they filmed the 90 Day Fiancé spin-off. Brandan worked odd jobs in America to build a $60,000 house for himself and Mary in the Philippines, and he went there with just $300 in his bank account. Mary, who had dropped out of college, decided she would start a small convenience store outside their house to make a living while complaining that Brandan wasn&#39;t helping out.




Brandan and Mary relied on his mom, Angela, to help them with money after they had their baby, but Brandan&#39;s Instagram page is revealing that he might not be in a bad place financially after all.


 

Brandan posted photos of himself sitting on a brand-new ride. It appears that Brandan has purchased the Honda Click 125i, a two-seater scooter, recently which he is flaunting on social media. &#34;They have no money but they got a motorcycle,&#34; a fan wrote in Brandan&#39;s comments. &#34;Did your momma paid for that?&#34; asked someone else. Meanwhile, someone else commented, &#34;It’s like $1500 and the main form of transportation in the Philippines.&#34; Brandan did not respond to these messages from his fans.

 What Are Brandan &amp; Mary Up To After 90 Day Fiancé? 
          

Brandan and Mary were expecting their first baby together when they filmed their wedding ceremony on 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way season 5. They welcomed baby Midnight in August 2023 and introduced her to the franchise fans in the Tell All while discussing the issues they still faced in their marriage. Brandan admitted he called Mary a &#34;b**ch&#34; and a scammer during arguments. He claimed he was doing so to get a response from Mary, and so she could stand up for herself. Meanwhile, Mary was called out for her extreme jealousy and slammed for her double standards because she shamelessly posted videos of her dancing seductively on her social media.

Mary&#39;s content strategy after having a baby has changed completely. Mary has been posting more content about her little baby now. Her romantic pictures with Brandan confirm they are still together. Mary and Brandan seem to be living a comfortable life as they&#39;re traveling together and sharing photos and videos from their travels together with their fans. Mary and Brandan have been trying to stay out of trouble. They were recently shamed by fans for keeping a chained monkey in their house as a pet. Their co-star Statler Riley had been calling out Brandan and Mary for cruelty towards the animal.




Meanwhile, Statler once claimed that Brandan and Mary were going to be fired from 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way. It is not known if the couple will return for a new spin-off in 2024 to talk about what happened to them after they became parents. Fans have not been happy with Brandan and Mary&#39;s antics on social media, such as using their baby to generate more engagement online. Mary is not bothered by the negative comments she gets online and Brandan also doesn&#39;t seem to mind. Mary and Brandan are also yet to reveal how they can afford the pricey scooter and if it&#39;s their store business that&#39;s really thriving.
