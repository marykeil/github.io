## Literature Review
A new Reacher season 3 update is great news for fans of Lee Child&#39;s books because it offers some promising insights into the show&#39;s future seasons.




Some new updates surrounding Reacher season 3 suggest that fans of Lee Child&#39;s books will be pleased with the show&#39;s future story developments. Reacher season 1 was wildly successful on Amazon Prime Video and even received rave reviews from viewers and critics. Although many successful shows dip in quality after their opening seasons, Reacher has maintained its streak by raking in positive critical ratings even for season 2.




Many factors have contributed to the show&#39;s successful two-season run. However, the primary reason why Amazon&#39;s Reacher has been received so well is that it stays true to its source material. Owing to its loyalty to the Lee Child books, it is hard for fans of the original novels to not appreciate how accurately the show portrays Jack Reacher&#39;s adventures. Whether Reacher&#39;s future seasons will be as successful as seasons 1 and 2 is yet to be seen, but some new updates surrounding season 2 suggest that the show&#39;s creators are committed to delivering an authentic and compelling adaptation.

                  1 Controversial Reacher Season 2 Character Return Makes The Show Better Than The Books   The return of one character in Reacher season 2 is somewhat controversial but it surprisingly makes the show better than the books in one major way.

Reacher season 2 skipped nine books from the original Lee Child Jack Reacher book series by adapting Bad Luck and Trouble. This established that the Amazon show was not necessarily following the exact chronological order of the books. Owing to this, Reacher season 3 can adapt any book and head in any direction, regardless of how season 2 ends. Although Alan Ritchson has opened up about all potential ways in which the Amazon series could progress, most details surrounding season 3 are still under the wraps even though it has been confirmed. Fortunately, some new updates surrounding the season promise more &#34;classic Reacher stories.&#34;

In an interview (via Comicbook), Alan Ritchson said that although he cannot reveal much about season 3, he can confirm that it will have more &#34;classic Reacher stories.&#34; By &#34;classic Reacher stories,&#34; he refers to all the exciting ways in which Jack Reacher finds trouble in the original books as he continues traveling across the United States. The actor also mentioned that Reacher&#39;s upcoming adventures may have nothing to do with his past or family, hinting that season 3 might follow season 1&#39;s narrative structure. Unlike season 2, which offers new insight into Reacher&#39;s military background and past relationships, Reacher season 3 will likely focus more on his present.






 Why This Reacher Update Is Great News For Fans Of Lee Child&#39;s Books 
Reacher&#39;s future seasons will likely remain loyal to the Lee Child books
          

One of the primary reasons Amazon&#39;s Reacher continues to succeed where the Tom Cruise movies failed is its loyalty to the source. While the films did not even correctly portray the main character&#39;s colossal stature, the show hit a casting homerun by getting Alan Ritchson onboard as the titular character. Like most book adaptations, Amazon&#39;s Reacher also takes some creative liberties. For instance, &#34;Reacher says nothing&#34; in the books but talks a little too much in the show&#39;s season 1. However, despite making these changes, the show stays true to the essence of the original books. The new Reacher update affirms that season 3 will continue to honor Lee Child&#39;s books.

This is great news for the readers of Lee Child&#39;s books because the Tom Cruise movies left most Lee Child fans dissatisfied. By promising viewers that season 3 will tread the same path as its predecessors and portray &#34;classic Reacher stories,&#34; the update assures that the show will stick to the script set by season 1 and keep delivering what fans of the book expect from a good adaptation. Which book the season will adapt remains a mystery, but the update is exciting enough to generate buzz surrounding the season and leave viewers wondering what lies ahead for Jack Reacher.






 The Amazon Series May Have A Bright Future After Season 3

By promising that Amazon&#39;s Reacher will closely adapt Lee Child&#39;s books, the update almost guarantees that the show will have a bright future even after season 3. At the same time, it also teases that Reacher might expand its roots as a full-fledged franchise in the future and maybe even introduce spin-off shows. This would not be surprising since a Reacher spin-off book series, not written by Lee Child, already offers abundant content to expand the Reacher universe. By not deviating too far from the books, Amazon&#39;s Reacher will also likely remain in the good books of both viewers and critics, further improving the odds of its future success and potential expansion.
