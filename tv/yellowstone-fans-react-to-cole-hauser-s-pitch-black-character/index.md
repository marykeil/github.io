## Literature Review
Cole Hauser is a core member of the Yellowstone cast, but the Rip Wheeler actor&#39;s role in sci-fi movie Pitch Black has blown fans&#39; minds.








Yellowstone actor Cole Hauser also starred in 2000&#39;s Pitch Black, a revelation that has blown fans&#39; minds. Hauser&#39;s late-career resurgence as a key player in the acclaimed Yellowstone cast has been a pivotal moment in the actor&#39;s journey. Known for his rugged persona and intense on-screen presence, Hauser has brought a new level of depth to his career. The modern-day Western has not only been a ratings powerhouse but also a platform for Hauser to showcase his acting skills as Rip Wheeler. The fiercely loyal and brooding Dutton ranch foreman has become a fan favorite, solidifying his status as a standout in the show&#39;s star-studded ensemble.




Parallel to his Yellowstone success is Hauser&#39;s earlier role in the 2000 sci-fi thriller Pitch Black. Hauser&#39;s role in Pitch Black was a stark contrast to Rip Wheeler, offering a glimpse into Hauser&#39;s range as an actor. The film, which has gained a cult following over the years, highlighted Hauser&#39;s ability to delve into complex, darker roles, something that he has carried over into his performance in Yellowstone.

                  Riddick 4: Furya - Cast, Story &amp; Everything We Know   Vin Diesel is returning for Riddick 4: Furya. Here&#39;s what we know about the sequel&#39;s development status, story details, and potential release date.    


 Yellowstone&#39;s Cole Hauser Played William J. Johns In Pitch Black 
          

In Pitch Black, Cole Hauser stepped into the role of William J. Johns, a morally ambiguous mercenary. Jones is both complex and intriguing, navigating a hostile alien environment while grappling with inner demons. Hauser&#39;s portrayal of Johns was a testament to the actor&#39;s ability to embody diverse roles, showcasing his talent in a genre vastly different from the Western landscape of Yellowstone. However, ironically, Pitch Black could be looked at as a sci-fi western, as the movie takes place on a desert planet and shares many of the genre&#39;s tropes, such as renegade characters with questionable morals and unclear motives.




Fans of Yellowstone expressed their astonishment at discovering that the same actor behind the brooding Rip is also the one who played the mercenary in Pitch Black. Social media platforms have been abuzz with discussions and comparisons of the two roles, highlighting Hauser&#39;s versatility as an actor. This revelation has led to a renewed interest in Pitch Black, with fans appreciating Hauser&#39;s earlier work in a new light. On one viral Instagram post, a user commented, &#34;Dude I first saw that guy in pitch black with Vin Diesel and my gf told me like &#39;Yeah, same guy.&#39; I said bullsh*t. And I&#39;ll be damned it&#39;s the same guy. Amazing actor.&#34;

 Hauser Also Starred In Another Popular Vin Diesel Franchise 
          




Interestingly, Cole Hauser&#39;s filmography extends beyond Pitch Black to another notable Vin Diesel franchise, as he plays the main villain in 2 Fast 2 Furious. In the high-octane sequel, Hauser took on the role of Carter Verone, a charismatic but ruthless drug lord. His performance in 2 Fast 2 Furious further cemented his ability to portray compelling antagonists, adding another dimension to his acting portfolio. However, while 2 Fast 2 Furious is part of a franchise led by Vin Diesel, Hauser&#39;s appearance in the movie didn&#39;t involve any screentime with the gravel-voiced action movie icon.

Diesel didn&#39;t return to the franchise until his cameo appearance in The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, meaning that Dominic Toretto and Carter Verone&#39;s paths never crossed. Nevertheless, Hauser could still return to Fast and Furious, especially given his late-career comeback with Yellowstone. In 2 Fast 2 Furious, Verone teased that he&#39;d get revenge on Brian and Rome, which has yet to happen. In addition to Yellowstone, Cole Hauser&#39;s roles in 2 Fast 2 Furious and Pitch Black are yet more examples of his versatility and ability to leave a lasting impression in various genres and franchises.
