 15  Fool Me Once 
Release Date: January 1
        

Based on Harlan Coben&#39;s novel of the same name, Fool Me Once was released on Netflix on New Year&#39;s Day. The series follows widowed veteran Maya Stern, played by Michelle Keegan, who discovers that her husband may still be alive when she spots him on her daughter&#39;s nanny-cam. Fool Me Once has received good reviews in its first week, but it is unlikely to get a second season. Netflix&#39;s previous adaptations of Coben&#39;s works have been in the format of a single-season miniseries, and Fool Me Once will likely follow suit (via Cosmopolitan).







 14  Hearstopper Season 3 
Release Date: TBC
        

After the success of season 1, the LGBTQ&#43; romance series Heartstopper was promptly renewed by Netflix for two more seasons. After showing Nick and Charlie&#39;s journey to Paris, Hearstopper season 2&#39;s ending hinted at future struggles for some of the show&#39;s couples and individual characters. Hearstopper is based on Alice Oseman&#39;s graphic novel series of the same name, and there is still more source material to be adapted after season 2. It is also likely that the series will continue after Heartstopper season 3.





 13  Dead Boy Detectives 
Release Date: April 25
        

Based on the characters originally created by Neil Gaiman, Dead Boy Detectives follows Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine, who are given the option to enter the afterlife when they die but choose to remain on Earth and investigate supernatural crimes. The story is set in the same universe as Gaiman&#39;s The Sandman, which has also been adapted into a TV show. The Dead Boy Detectives trailer promises that the show will be funny, action-packed, and rife with supernatural beings. Given Gaiman&#39;s status as a fantasy author and the success of The Sandman, Dead Boy Detectives already has a solid fanbase.







 12  Emily In Paris Season 4 
Release Date: TBC
        

Lily Collins will also return in 2024 as the title character of Emily in Paris, following a young woman whose career takes her to the City of Light. After Emily in Paris season 3&#39;s shocking ending, season 4 promises more romance, more food, and more fashion. Fans are especially anxious to see how the love triangle between Emily, Camille, and Gabriel will play out. Christy Piña (via The Hollywood Reporter) speculates that Emily in Paris season 4 could be released on Netflix in December 2024. It is also currently not confirmed if the show will continue after season 4.





 11  Young Royals Season 3 (Final Season) 
Release Date: March 2024
        

Young Royals follows the romance between Prince Wilhelm of Sweden and Simon Eriksson at the fictional Hillerska Boarding School. The show will come to a conclusion with season 3 in 2024. Co-creator Lisa Ambjörn says (via Vogue), &#34;I’ve always imagined Young Royals being told in three parts [...] The ending has been clear to me from the start and I’m so thankful and honoured to get to finish this tale as intended.” Ambjörn&#39;s confirmation means Young Royals fans may rest assured that the story is playing out as intended, and will hopefully have a strong ending.

 10  One Day 
Release Date: February 8
        

Expected for the 2024 Valentine&#39;s Day season is the limited series One Day, based on David Nicholls&#39; award-winning romance novel of the same name. The story follows Em (Ambika Mod) and Dex (Leo Woodall), who agree to meet once a year after spending the night together at their university graduation. One Day was previously adapted into a movie starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. However, the limited series format allows for a new imagining of the timeline, with a year passing between each episode.





 9  The Brothers Sun 
Release Date: January 4


 







Michelle Yeoh&#39;s latest project, The Brothers Sun, is already on Netflix. Justin Chien stars alongside Yeoh as Taipei gangster Charles Sun, who travels to L.A. to protect his intimidating mother (Yeoh) and sheltered brother (Sam Song Li) after his father is shot by an anonymous assassin. The Brothers Sun is marketed as action, drama, and comedy, and its trailer advertises the action sequences as well as humorous moments. If the multi-genre plot weren&#39;t enough, Yeoh&#39;s involvement in particular has brought a lot of attention to the series. Additionally, the premise of season 1 could plausibly be developed into a long-running TV show.







 8  Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story 
Release Date: TBC
        

Netflix is following up Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story with Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Mendez Story, also known as Monster season 2. This season will focus on the events surrounding the title characters who killed their parents in 1989, citing self-defense as the cause. Monsters has not yet been filmed (several series, including Wednesday season 2, were delayed by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes) but is still expected in 2024. Erik and Lyle will be played by Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez, respectively. These actors have a lot to live up to after Evan Peters&#39; chilling performance in 2022.





 7  3 Body Problem 
Release Date: March 21
        

David Benioff and D.B. Weiss have a lot to prove after Game of Thrones&#39; controversial final season. The duo&#39;s new sci-fi show 3 Body Problem, based on Liu Cixin&#39;s Remembrance of Earth&#39;s Past trilogy, is expected early on in 2024. 3 Body Problem stars Marlo Kelly, Saamer Usmani, and Jess Hong, with Game of Thrones actors John Bradley and Liam Cummingham and the MCU&#39;s Benedict Wong appearing in some episodes. Netflix&#39;s 3 Body Problem will depict Earth preparing for a war with an extraterrestrial force. However, the books subvert the typical alien invasion narrative by depicting humanity waiting for several centuries.







 6  Cobra Kai Season 6 (Final Season) 
Release Date: TBC
        

In the wake of the news of a new Karate Kid movie, Netflix confirmed that Cobra Kai season 6 will be the show&#39;s final season. Netflix made a wise decision to purchase Cobra Kai from YouTube Red after its second season – the Karate Kid spinoff starring William Zabka as Johnny Lawrence and Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso has been a massive hit for five seasons. The final season must resolve several long-standing rivalries to resolve and the storyline of Cobra Kai&#39;s expansion. Fans will be disappointed to see the show end, but will also be hoping for it to go out with a bang.





 5  Griselda 
Release Date: January 25
        

Modern Family&#39;s Sofía Vergara stars in a new crime drama miniseries coming out in January 2024. Griselda adapts the life of Colombian &#34;queenpin&#34; Griselda Blanco, who built one of the most successful drug cartels in history. Narcos and Narcos: Mexico, which are dramatizations of the drug trade in Colombia and Mexico respectively, are among Netflix&#39;s most popular shows. Their success suggests that Griselda will also be popular. Actors starring alongside Vergara include Martín Fajardo, Jose Velazquez, Orlando Pienda, Martín Rodríguez, and Juliana Aidén Martinez.





 4  Bridgerton Season 3 
Release Date: May 16 &amp; June 13
        

The long-awaited culmination of the hinted romance between Penelope Featherington and Colin Bridgerton will be the focus of Bridgerton season 3. The season is being split into two parts, which will be released in May and June 2024. While Penelope may finally express her unspoken feelings for Colin, she must also face the consequences of her best friend Eloise discovering that she moonlights as the notorious Lady Whistledown. Overall, anticipation is high for the return of one of Netflix&#39;s quintessential shows.





 3  Wednesday Season 2 
Release Date: TBC
        

Jenna Ortega will soon be returning to Netflix as Wednesday Addams after her stunning breakout performance in 2022. Wednesday partially owes its popularity to Ortega&#39;s masterful delivery of the title character&#39;s deadpan one-liners. Wednesday season 2 will begin filming in April 2024. Jacob Robinson (via whats-on-netflix.com) speculates that season 2 could be released in November 2024, but a delay until 2025 is possible. Wednesday season 1&#39;s ending gives more questions than answers: Who is Wednesday&#39;s stalker? Who will be the new principal of Nevermore? Will Tyler ever return?





 2  Arcane Season 2 
Release Date: November 2024


 







The long-awaited second season of the hit show Arcane is expected later in 2024. Arcane season 2 has been in production for almost three years. Riot Games CEO Nicolo Laurent said (via win.gg), “You want the quality; we just don’t want to rush, and so that takes time.&#34; After the literally explosive ending of Arcane season 1, the conflict between Piltover and Zaun is likely to escalate while characters including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Ekko, Jayce, Viktor, and more will continue to manage complex interpersonal relationships and developing rivalries.

 1  Avatar: The Last Airbender 
Release Date: February 22


 







The live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender TV show has long been in development and at the center of many discussions. The show is finally coming to Netflix in February 2024. Netflix choosing to adapt a beloved animated show means that a dedicated fandom is readily waiting to see if the new series will live up to its predecessor. However, this also means that the Avatar showrunner Albert Kim and the other writers have the difficult job of not disappointing those fans. Avatar is doubtlessly Netflix&#39;s most anticipated and possibly most divisive original TV show coming in 2024.
