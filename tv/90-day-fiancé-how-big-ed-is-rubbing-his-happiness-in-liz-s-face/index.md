## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé cast member Big Ed Brown is going all out to make Liz Woods feel jealous amid shocking rumors of their split after their August wedding.




Former 90 Day: The Single Life star Big Ed Brown is seemingly declaring that he’s single again after rumors of his split with Liz Woods. Big Ed, 58, became a well-known face on reality TV after romancing Rose Vega from the Philippines in 90 Day Fiancé: Before The 90 Days season 4. Big Ed was dumped by Rose when she had enough of him insulting her and lying to her from his teeth. Big Ed’s franchise journey continued when he began dating Liz Woods from San Diego after meeting her at a local restaurant where she was working. They dated on and off for a few years, during which Big Ed and Liz split 13 times.




Big Ed and Liz tried to save their relationship one last time in The Last Resort and were successful at it. Despite trust issues in the past, Big Ed and Liz moved to Arkansas, where they seemingly bought a house together and reportedly got married in August 2023. However, a few months passed by until they sparked split rumors online. Liz began spending time in San Diego again and started posting Instagram stories of her date nights with a man who wasn’t Big Ed. While Liz was having the time of her life without Big Ed by her side, the former photographer had been dropping a few hints himself.

 Big Ed Is Excelling At His New Real Estate Career 

 




Big Ed was working as a professional photographer when he debuted in 90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days season 4. He also worked as an interior designer at a studio in San Diego remodeling kitchens and designing them because of his background in interior designing. In July 2023, a fan noticed Big Ed’s photo being posted in a Facebook group for the Board Of Realtors in Northwest Arkansas. Big Ed went Live on Instagram on December 16, 2023, where he revealed he was now a real estate agent and had just closed on his first house.



 Big Ed Is Praising Ex-Rose On Social Media 

 

Big Ed has been posting his “most iconic Big Ed moments” on Instagram and most of them include his ex-girlfriend, Rose. On December 3, 2023, Big Ed posted a clip of him meeting Rose for the first time. One of his hashtags for his caption was “bigedandrose.” Interestingly, the post was liked by Liz herself. During the Happily Ever After? season 7, Tell All, it was revealed that Big Ed had been secretly texting Rose. He had even asked Rose if he could visit her in the Philippines. While Rose is currently happy in her relationship with her boyfriend Greg Scherwinski, Big Ed is using her to make Liz jealous.






 Big Ed Is Looking For New Love On Bumble 

 

X (Formerly Twitter) user Shabooty shared screenshots of Big Ed’s alleged Bumble profile in November 2023. The screenshots had been taken on November 7, 2023, which showed Big Ed had supposedly been actively using the dating app at the time. The profile mentioned that Big Ed’s current location was Centerton. His bio mentioned that he was looking for a partner who was loving, respectful, down-to-earth, and family-oriented with a love for travel. While it has not been confirmed if the profile was really created by Big Ed, it had a verification badge which could mean that Big Ed was indeed trying to find a new girlfriend.



 Big Ed Is Spending Time With Other Women 
          




Around the same time, Big Ed was also enjoying the company of a woman who wasn’t Liz. The 90 Day: The Single Life star posted a few cuddly photos with one of his female friends. Big Ed had gone to a local San Diego Gulls game with the woman and captioned the post, “Fun night at the Gulls with my SD buddies!” Big Ed’s followers noticed that Liz was not in any of the photos. They asked him, “Where is your wifey??” and “Why bro holding her arm tho?” Big Ed didn’t respond to any of the questions and later suspiciously deleted the post from his Instagram feed.
