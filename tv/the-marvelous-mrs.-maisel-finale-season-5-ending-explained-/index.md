## Literature Review
Daniel and Amy Sherman Palladino’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel has finally come to an end, and here’s how they closed out the fifth and final season.




Amazon Prime Video&#39;s 2017 hit The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel finally came to an end in 2023, and the fifth and final season definitely brought a satisfying finish for Midge and her peers. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel follows Midge, a classic 1950s housewife who decides to pursue a career in comedy after finding out her husband has been cheating on her. The series begins in the late 1950s but spans many decades and emphasizes certain historical moments and issues at the turn of the century, especially women&#39;s rights.

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5 was a final season that evoked the fun drama of past seasons while also adding new elements. In particular, season 5 included time jumps wherein every episode jumped to the future, offering a sneak peek at what was to come. While the early Maisel time jumps hinted at an unhappy future for Midge, the season eventually tied a metaphorical pink ribbon around Midge&#39;s life and her career. Overall, the season gave plenty of hints as to each character&#39;s future while also answering the main question of the season: how did Midge get famous?


 





 What Happens In The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5&#39;s Ending? 
         

The final episode of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel had many questions to answer before its end. Namely, audiences needed to know if Midge would successfully make it onto the Gordon Ford Show, how Susie is really connected to Hedy, and whether Midge and Susie would make up in the future. Ultimately, all of these questions are answered in the series finale. After bailing Susie out of jail, Midge prompts her to reveal why she was so hesitant to talk to Hedy and Susie finally complies, revealing that she and Susie have a romantic history. Soon after, Midge goes to work and Gordon tells her she will appear on the show that night.

Seeming like Midge will finally get her big break, she calls her family and Joel to tell them to come to the show and see her perform. However, the episode quickly becomes hectic as Midge discovers that she will not be appearing as a comedian, but as a writer. When the show begins, Midge is humiliated by Gordon but makes a perfectly in-character decision to grab the mic and do her routine anyway. Of course, this pays off, and while she is fired from the show, she is about to shoot to fame. The episode ends with a final time jump to 2005 where Midge is much older but still working hard. She and Susie talk on the phone and watch Jeopardy together, laughing all the while, allowing the show to end with their friendship front and center. .






 How Does Midge Get Famous? 
          

While The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5, episode 8 made it seem like Hedy&#39;s influence over Gordon would be the key to Midge&#39;s success, this was not exactly the case. While Gordon technically did put Midge on the show, he blindsided her by giving her little time to prepare and also introduced her as a writer rather than a comedian. The ruse is made even worse during the show as Gordon won&#39;t let Midge speak at all, and when she makes a joke, he cuts to a commercial. In this way, Midge must take this big break into her own hands.

In the series finale, Midge decides to ambush Gordon and force the final four minutes of the show into her very own comedy spot. She speaks over Gordon, asks the audience if they want to see her do comedy, walks over to a microphone, and unapologetically begins her set. Midge does so well that even Gordon is impressed, and it&#39;s clear that this set will become historic in Midge Maisel history. It can be assumed then that after Gordon announces her as The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Midge follows the path of fame that audiences have seen in time jumps all season.






 Midge and Susie Make Up In The Future 
          

In The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5, episode 2, it is revealed that during the 1980s, Midge and Susie have a falling out that breaks up their friendship completely. One of the biggest Marvelous Mrs. Maisel episode 6 reveals is that their falling out occurred because Susie kept her ties to the mob a secret from Midge and Joel ultimately went to jail to protect Midge from Susie&#39;s bad dealings. However, also during episode 6, Midge sends a video to Susie&#39;s &#34;testi-roastial&#34; several years later that seems to be a step towards forgiveness. It&#39;s unclear whether that truly happens until the series finale.

At the end of episode 9, there is the farthest time jump yet to 2005. In this time jump, viewers see that Midge and Susie have not only made up but are exactly as they always were. When Susie loses her glasses, Midge knows exactly where they are. As the pair queue up Jeopardy, they bicker incessantly at each other. And as the episode finishes, Midge and Susie banter to the point of them laughing so hard they can barely talk. In this way, the series ends with their friendship, reinstated and better than ever, despite old age, past fights, and distance.






 Susie And Hedy Were In A Romantic Relationship 
          

One of the most shocking yet satisfying reveals of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5 is Susie&#39;s sexuality and romantic past with Gordon Ford&#39;s wife, Hedy. In episode 4, Hedy and Susie have a confrontation that is heavy with subtext that the audience doesn&#39;t quite understand. All that can be gleaned is that the women used to know each other in college and a betrayal occurred that hurt Susie deeply. Later, when Midge asks Susie to use her relationship with Hedy to get on the Gordon Ford Show, Susie refuses several times before finally saying yes, proving the severity of their past. Episode 9 finally offers the full story.

After being rescued from jail by Midge, Susie finally reveals that her discomfort with Hedy is because they were a couple in college and Hedy broke Susie&#39;s heart. She explains that they went to college together and Hedy used to flirt with Susie in the dining hall. They were an unlikely pair but Susie admits that Hedy was her first and only love. The relationship ended when Hedy went to France for a time and returned engaged to another man. This revelation finally gives an answer to an episode 4 mystery and also explains the Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 4 storyline that questions Susie&#39;s sexuality.






 Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5 Introduces An Esther Spinoff 
          

While The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel has a lovable cast full of characters that could all lead their own spinoffs, the best character from season 5 to follow would be Midge&#39;s daughter Esther. In the past, the series has often brushed past Midge&#39;s children, however, season 5 brings them into the spotlight a bit more both in their youth and adulthood. Esther in particular brings a significant storyline to the table from the very first scene of season 5 that would be beneficial to explore further because of its ties to feminism and family relationships.

During The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5, Esther is seen as an adult speaking with her therapist about her strained relationship with her mother, her closeness with her grandfather, Abe, and her groundbreaking work in physics. Meanwhile, as a child, Esther piques Abe&#39;s interest because of her displays of intelligence, and he ultimately has an epiphany about his sexist viewpoint when it comes to Midge. Both of these storylines offer peeks into Esther&#39;s interesting life and struggles, making for a perfect spinoff. The series could focus on a new time period and problems but with many of the same, beloved characters within new relationship structures.






 Joel’s Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5 End 
          

During The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5, Joel becomes a major figure of support in Midge&#39;s life and a potential love interest once again. Most significantly, Joel proves his dedication to Midge by selling himself to the mob to free Midge, which ultimately sends him to prison for several years. Although it isn&#39;t entirely clear, Midge and Joel potentially get back together in the future. During the 1970s, Midge refuses to marry her fiancée because she believes she&#39;s still in love with Joel, and later, she visits him every month while he is in prison. The final hint appears in the last time jump of episode 9.

In 2005, Midge keeps a photo from their wedding, hinting that Joel and Midge got back together and also that Joel may have died. Based on their romance surviving over several decades and the vast time jump, it makes sense that the pair reunited and that Joel ultimately died of old age, making this photo a beloved reminder of their love. Then again, without a clear answer, Joel could still be alive and separated from Midge, and she just has a continuing love for him as shown by the photo. Either way, Joel does not appear in the final time jump, leaving his fate undetermined. However, in an interview, creator Amy Sherman-Palladino makes it clear that while the details of Joel&#39;s life are not laid out, he did not marry Midge again. &#34;I know that she wasn’t married and not a widow,&#34;.






 Rose And Abe’s Fates At The End Of Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5 
          

While neither Rose nor Abe appear in the final time jump of the season, there are a few clues to their fates throughout the season. First, in episode 7, Midge implies in a time jump to the 1970s that The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&#39;s Rose is doomed due to a mysterious illness, giving her only a short time left to live. Meanwhile, in a different jump to the 1980s, Esther references her close relationship with Abe, hinting that he may still be alive at that point. In this way, it seems that Rose passes away much earlier than Abe and Abe continues to be a major player in Esther&#39;s life.



 What Does The Final Scene Mean? 
         




The final scene of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel season 5 shows Midge and Susie laughing over the phone. While this is a happy note to end the series on, it also has a deeper meaning to it. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel ends with Midge and Susie because, in reality, that is also where the show began. Although Midge is spurred into comedy by Joel&#39;s betrayal, she never would have made it without Susie. In this way, the show emphasizes how significant Midge and Susie&#39;s friendship is to the show. No matter how much time passes, Midge and Susie will always be themselves and will always be laughing together.



 What The Creators Said About The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Finale 
          

Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and co-creator Dan Palladino spoke to Indiewire about the show&#39;s ending, revealing that they always knew how Midge&#39;s story would end - but also clarifying a few details about Midge&#39;s fate.




&#34;We knew where Midge was going to end up. We knew that from the series pitch at the very, very beginning, before they picked up the pilot. We knew what her trajectory was, and pretty much Susie by design because they’re linked.&#34;

Sherman-Palladino also spoke about making Midge and Susie the central focus of the show, and about choosing to end it on such a sweet scene of the two of them simply watching TV together. In a series where most of Midge&#39;s flash forwards are focused on her success and glamorous life, this was a contrast - but an intentional one, to remind viewers that it wasn&#39;t fame at the heart of the story.

&#34;We wanted something very comfortable, almost mundane, and normal. That’s the whole point of the series, the two of them and their shared journey, and that for all the things that maybe Midge gave up or didn’t give up, she had that. At the end of the day, it’s that friendship that sustains her.”



 The Real Meaning Of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel Season 5
