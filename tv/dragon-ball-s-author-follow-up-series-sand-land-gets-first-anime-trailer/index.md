## Literature Review
The SAND LAND anime, which picks up where the movie left off, finally can be seen in motion with the first official teaser trailer.




The upcoming animated adaptation of SAND LAND, written by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame, received its first teaser trailer. While a feature-length film came out last year, the studios and staff behind it are teaming up again to continue with this sequel series. Audiences can now see what to look forward to when the new anime starts streaming during the Spring 2024 anime season.




The teaser, which was uploaded to Bandi Namco&#39;s YouTube channel, again confirms that Sunrise, Kamikaze Douga and Anima are in charge of the new project. The teaser footage shows 3D CGI animation, which is to be expected, given that is the medium the movie was produced in.


 

It pairs well with the high-octane action scenes that were revealed in the new video, where tanks rolled around and blasted away at each other with a buttery smoothness.

The staff responsible for the movie are also returning to head the anime. Toshihisa Yokoshima will be directing the anime, Hayashi Mori will serve as scriptwriter, and Yoshikazu Iwanami and Yugo Kanno will be directing sounds and composing music, respectively. As reported earlier, the anime will take the opportunity to use scenes from the manga that were skipped in the movie; furthermore, Akira Toriyama is providing a story that continues from where the movie ended. The teaser also officially confirms that it will be exclusive to Disney&#43; services â€“ and will stream on Star and Hulu in the US.

The last two years have seen a sudden uptick in interest in Akira Toriyama&#39;s 2000 manga, which has been at the center of a multimedia project, which was first unveiled by Bandai Namco back in 2022. First came the movie that premiered last year, which followed the original story; 2024 will now see an official sequel to the original single volume story, as well as a tie-in video game, also to be published by Bandai Namco. The game will also be released later in April, in order to get audiences both watching and gaming about Beelzebub and Rao&#39;s desert antics.




          

Toriyama has been busy thanks to a demand to have him oversee various projects revitalizing his older manga. Besides SAND LAND, Dragon Ball Daima is currently in production, which turns the cast into child-sized forms in an explicit throwback to the character designs of the original 1984 manga. The trend, it seems, is to focus more on Toriyama himself and his &#34;seal of approval&#34; in order to bring more attention to these anime series. Nonetheless, SAND LAND is a welcome addition to the anime landscape in 2024, which shakes up the glut of high fantasy realms with an unusual take on the desert-punk setting.
