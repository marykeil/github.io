  <a href="#summary" class="heading-mark"></a>SUMMARY</h2><p>Sister Wives season 18 gave the women a chance to express their frustrations, but it was filled with negativity and strained relationships.   Meri Brown should have realized that Kody didn&rsquo;t love her and stopped trying to salvage their marriage.   Janelle Brown&rsquo;s refusal to follow Kody&rsquo;s strict COVID-19 rules led to a breakdown in their relationship.   Christine Brown couldn&rsquo;t detach and her jealousy over Robyn ruined her relationship with Kody.</p>

<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Sister Wives&rsquo; Kody Brown has been compared to Satan and Darth Vader, but maybe his exes aren&rsquo;t so innocent. Meri, Janelle and Christine failed him.</p>
<p>Kody Brown is a Sister Wives star who often acts like a loser, but maybe his exes Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown are just as bad. Offscreen, these women are officially his former spouses, and Christine&rsquo;s already remarried to David Woolley. Right now, the patriarch&rsquo;s ex-wives are lashing out at him online. On Instagram, Christine made fun of him by wearing an &ldquo;I tried polygamy&rdquo; t-shirt. In season 18, she was openly critical of Kody, whom she obviously feels is a total failure as a husband and father. Janelle unloaded on him while the cameras rolled, and Meri seemed exhausted whenever she was around the cranky polygamist.</p>
<p>Sister Wives season 18 was interesting because it allowed the women in Kody&rsquo;s lives to really have a voice. Pandemic-related issues put a major strain on the Brown family dynamic. It was especially hard on Kody and Janelle&rsquo;s relationship, which wasn&rsquo;t rock-solid before COVID-19 started spreading. While it was good that the women were able to really vent, as repressing emotions can be unhealthy, the overall vibes were bad. Everything felt negative - even Kody&rsquo;s formerly sacred marriage with his &ldquo;queen&rdquo; Robyn. While Kody&rsquo;s often perceived as the primary problem in his plural marriage, his ex-wives aren&rsquo;t angels. They have also sinned.</p>

<p>Meri Brown Didn&rsquo;t Pay Attention To Kody Brown&rsquo;s Signals
Meri Brown Kept Trying When Kody Brown Obviously Wasn&rsquo;t Into It</p>
<p>Meri wasn&rsquo;t always a monster, but she was willfully ignorant. For years, she seemed to miss Kody&rsquo;s very clear &ldquo;hidden messages.&rsquo; In a million ways, he telegraphed the fact that he didn&rsquo;t love Meri at all. Kody didn&rsquo;t even offer her the more platonic kind of friendship that he enjoyed with Janelle. Meri should have known long ago that there was absolutely no bond between her and Kody. For her own reasons, or just because she deluded herself, she kept trying to make things work. She flogged a dead horse until it was frankly ridiculous, and it was such a relief when she finally bailed out on her spiritual union.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that strong Christians like Meri and the rest of the Brown family opted for divorce. While divorce isn&rsquo;t outlawed in plural marriage circles, it&rsquo;s frowned upon. Also, it isn&rsquo;t something that the Bible recommends. People in polygamous situations often say that they do it for religion, but maybe they have other reasons too. Maybe the man wants power over women - maybe the women want to be led. Everyone&rsquo;s different, and Meri did seem like a person who wanted to be led. Her affect was always very meek.</p>
<p>Meek doesn&rsquo;t always mean weak, but Meri should have fought her corner more. So many times, Kody hurt her and she just took it. Also, Robyn was quite passive-aggressive with her fellow sister wife, although she made a show of being the woman&rsquo;s confidante. As Meri was too shy to really unload on her husband and his favorite wife, all the feelings that she kept inside seemed to drag her down. It&rsquo;s better to have a fight and clear the air than trudge on like a weary soldier in what&rsquo;s supposed to be a romantic relationship.</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s spiritual union with Meri felt like a Hundred Years War, and she should take responsibility for that. She seemed to pretend she didn&rsquo;t understand what he was trying to get across. Of course, Meri understood. In war, there&rsquo;s something called &ldquo;strategic patience.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s waiting it out in a calculated way in order to achieve a goal down the line. Meri was very patient but maybe her goal wasn&rsquo;t getting closer to Kody. Maybe it was staying on the Sister Wives gravy train for as long as she could.</p>
<p>Janelle Brown Wouldn&rsquo;t Follow Kody Brown&rsquo;s COVID-19 Rules
Janelle Brown Should Have Known Better</p>
<p>Janelle knew that being ultra-cautious during the COVID-19 pandemic was important to Kody, but she flouted his rules anyway. Sure, she had her reasons, but she must have known that her decision to be more lax than him would have consequences. Unfortunately, Kody sealed himself off from her during the pandemic because she and their kids preferred to follow CDC guidelines. Those recommendations weren&rsquo;t good enough for Kody. In Janelle&rsquo;s defense, his rules were pretty tough to follow. She said, as per People:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I mean some of these are great, but clean mail with alcohol wipes? I&rsquo;m looking at these rules and I&rsquo;m astounded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His rules limited what the kids could do. Kody instructed the children to stay ten feet away from their friends. This didn&rsquo;t go over too well. Now that the pandemic crisis has eased, people can live much as they did before it started. However, the tensions in the Brown family didn&rsquo;t evaporate when life got easier. In fact, they intensified.</p>
<p>If Janelle had &ldquo;obeyed&rdquo; Kody, who wanted his wives to &ldquo;conform to patriarchy again,&rdquo; maybe they could have patched things up when his rules weren&rsquo;t as restrictive. Kody is a Capricorn, and they are very rigid when it comes to rules. Earthy Taurus Janelle is actually a great astrological match for Kody, but she&rsquo;s as stubborn as any other Taurus. When it came to the pandemic, she said that Kody made her choose between her kids and him. However, if Janelle and her kids had followed his rules, there would be no issue - no &ldquo;choosing&rdquo; would have been needed.</p>
<p>Janelle got stubborn. Kody crossed a line, and she just dug in, finding a position on the whole pandemic issue and never deviating from it. While Janelle&rsquo;s smart and practical, Kody wants Stepford Wives. Janelle didn&rsquo;t find his methods sensible and that triggered her. She wouldn&rsquo;t do what he wanted and that was that.</p>
<p>Janelle, while in a plural marriage where a man is supposed to rule the household, wouldn&rsquo;t play ball. This set the stage for what Kody perceives as yet another betrayal from the Brown women. Only Robyn lives up to his high standards. When Janelle rebelled as a wife, it was really over. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>Christine Brown Wanted Passion From Kody Brown
Kody Brown Loves Only Robyn Brown</p>
<p>Christine&rsquo;s a fiery Aries, and Aries women want red-hot passion. They want the real thing, not sham romances. For most of them, infidelity is a deal-breaker. In fact, cheating will put them into a blind rage. With Kody, she was very jealous, but she would never have betrayed him. She just wanted genuine love. Obviously, a woman with this temperament is an extremely poor candidate for polygamy.</p>
<p>Long ago, Christine should have figured out that she wasn&rsquo;t cut out for this kooky lifestyle. Sharing her man with Robyn was total torture for her - a hell on earth. When Robyn entered the family, Christine&rsquo;s hopes and dreams were destroyed. While Christine knew that she was in a plural marriage, the emotional realities of being usurped by a new and younger wife just stung. For that, she wasn&rsquo;t really prepared. Even Kody probably didn&rsquo;t realize how much his life (and dynamic with the other wives) would change once he fell in love with Robyn.</p>
<p>For Kody, meeting Robyn was a magic moment. When faced with this kind of true love, he was powerless. Kody would do anything for Robyn, even if it poisoned his relationships with his other wives. And it did. Christine was on the receiving end of this type of passionate abandon - Janelle and Meri too. Mooning over Robyn like a teenager, Kody was not emotionally present for Christine.</p>
<p>That kind of love is beautiful. It just has no place in a plural marriage. In that context, it&rsquo;s a destroyer, burning through a family like a wildfire. On the flip side, Christine was supposed to repress her emotions in some concept of godly suffering that puts women in polygamist situations behind the eight-ball. She didn&rsquo;t suffer in silence. Christine wasn&rsquo;t diplomatic or reasonable. She would openly show jealousy in a family where she had to continue interacting with the other women, including Robyn.</p>
<p>Christine couldn&rsquo;t handle her jealousy and she did know that she was a part of a situation where other wives were in the mix. That&rsquo;s her problem and Kody probably blames her for her lack of self-control. However, none of this matters now, as Christine found her &ldquo;real thing.&rdquo; She no longer has to worry about what Kody thinks or who he loves. That is a blessing!</p>
<p>Of Course, Kody Brown Deserves Blame Too
Kody&rsquo;s Favoritism Ruined His Plural Marriage</p>
<p>Kody&rsquo;s weaknesses brought him down. Everyone has their failings and blind spots. With Kody, Robyn was the reason why he often sank so low. He really, really loves Robyn, and even though he&rsquo;s been getting on her nerves in season 18, she seems to love him too. After the season started filming, she shared offscreen that she wanted monogamy with him. That was a sort of unmasking for Robyn, who&rsquo;d posed as plural marriage&rsquo;s poster girl for years.</p>
<p>Since Kody broke family rules for Robyn (he kissed her before matrimony and helped her to pick out a wedding dress, which he never did for other wives), he caused most of the family&rsquo;s issues. The problem is that he didn&rsquo;t just emotionally neglect three non-Robyn wives - he also seemed to favor his kids with Robyn.</p>
<p>He got too close to Robyn. Kody pushed away everyone else. Sometimes, he seemed like a terrible human being - a really cranky, rude and judgmental guy. He never seemed to see his role in anything, as though a serious case of narcissism made him seem perfect to himself. Kody appeared to look down on wives who weren&rsquo;t Robyn, going on fault-finding missions that showcased his defects of character. These women birthed his kids. They did his bidding for years. They became the enemy because that&rsquo;s what he wanted.</p>
<p>While his wives had flaws, so did he. It&rsquo;s almost like he was trying to dehumanize his other wives, as though some part of him knew that eventually the family would implode. By going after these women and making them feel bad about themselves, he could make a cleaner break later. The bad blood would be so extreme that there was no going back. While Kody might not have consciously been aware of what he was doing, it&rsquo;s obvious that, because he didn&rsquo;t love the others, he started emotionally wounding them. He created trouble so it would be easier to forget them when it was just him and Robyn.</p>
<p>Sister Wives season 18 shows the emotional dangers of polygamy. Plural marriage isn&rsquo;t just some quirky choice that hearkens back to another century. It&rsquo;s a situation that can leave people traumatized. In season 18, all the wives seemed stressed. Even the typically grounded Janelle was very high-strung. Janelle needs to be provoked to a pretty extreme degree before she really loses it. Since she&rsquo;s a Taurus, which is symbolized by The Bull, picture a matador waving a red scarf in front of that animal. What happens next? That animal goes berserk.</p>
<p>This plural marriage had to die, but the death throes seemed endless. Even now, perhaps for attention (or maybe for more sincere reasons), the Browns can&rsquo;t stop talking about what&rsquo;s happened. It&rsquo;s over, but they rehash it onscreen and online. When Kody, Robyn, Meri, Janelle and Christine stop talking about what they&rsquo;ve endured, they&rsquo;ll really have evolved. Until then, they&rsquo;ll always be pulled back into the past. Oddly, it seems like Kody&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s suffering the most. However, he&rsquo;s probably playing his little violin.</p>
<p>While Kody may exaggerate his emotions, or fake them entirely, maybe the exes do the same sometimes. For ages, they knew which way the wind was blowing. There&rsquo;s really no way that they avoided the hard facts. Kody loved Robyn, he neglected them and then lied about that. The truth was clear to everyone. So, while Sister Wives season 18 has its overt devil (Kody), there are really no angels here. It&rsquo;s just a sad tale of destruction. Everyone behaved badly at times.</p>
