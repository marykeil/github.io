## Literature Review
Love Is Blind: Japan is the second international Love Is Blind spin-off, and premiered in early 2022. Here&#39;s why the show is severely underrated.





After the attention that surrounded Love Is Blind season 1, Netflix ordered its first two international spin-offs: Love Is Blind: Brazil, which aired in late 2021, and Love Is Blind: Japan, which premiered in February. While only five couples were followed on Love Is Blind season 3, the first season of Love Is Blind: Japan featured eight: Odacchi &amp; Nanako, Mori &amp; Minami, Yudai &amp; Nana, Misaki &amp; Kaoru, Shuntaro &amp; Ayano, Mizuki &amp; Priya, Ryotaro &amp; Motomi, and Wataru &amp; Midori. Although there are many noticeable differences between the American and Japanese versions of Love Is Blind and an obvious language barrier, Netflix subscribers who have been sucked into the Love Is Blind universe should give Love Is Blind: Japan a chance for several reasons.

 The Love Is Blind: Japan Contestants Are More Respectful 

 

Navigating new relationships aren&#39;t easy, especially when your actions are being broadcast across the world. Although plenty of controversial and disliked contestants have been featured on Love Is Blind, such as Matt Bolton and Zanab Jaffrey from Love Is Blind season 3, the cast members of Love Is Blind: Japan are much more respectful and mature, especially when there&#39;s conflict. When Shaina Hurley and Natalie Lee were both attracted to Shayne Jansen on Love Is Blind season 2, for example, the three ended up in a dramatic love triangle that continued off-camera. On the other hand, when multiple women were drawn to Shuntaro in the Love Is Blind: Japan pods, they supported one another despite the competition.






 The Love Is Blind: Japan Contestants Make Genuine Connections 

 

When it comes to the American version of Love Is Blind, many fans believe that the social experiment is a solidified failure despite the amount of drama provided. For the past three seasons, Netflix has primarily cast conventionally attractive people who strive to be social media influencers, which has led to many relationships like Raven Ross and SK Alagbada&#39;s being branded as fake. On Love Is Blind: Japan, however, the contestants come from all walks of life and are not afraid to dive straight into deep subjects. Several stars of Love Is Blind: Japan were divorced or unemployed, for example, while Shuntaro was the oldest at 56 years old. In addition, while Shaina&#39;s crop top declaration and Raven&#39;s jumping jacks were criticized as shallow on Love Is Blind, the cast members of Love Is Blind: Japan discuss a wide variety of topics like their fears, aspirations, and insecurities.






 Love Is Blind: Japan Season 2 Will Premiere In 2023 

 

Although Love Is Blind: Japan hasn&#39;t reached the level of popularity as the American version of Love Is Blind, Netflix announced that Love Is Blind: Japan season 2 would return in 2023. Although a specific date hasn&#39;t been given yet, fans could expect Love Is Blind: Japan season 2 around next February or March. In the meantime, fans can read all about Netflix&#39;s upcoming spin-off, Love Is Blind: Sweden, as well as Love Is Blind season 4, which is also set to premiere in 2023.
