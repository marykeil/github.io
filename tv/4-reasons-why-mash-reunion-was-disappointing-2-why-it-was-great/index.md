# 4 Reasons Why MASH Reunion Was Disappointing (&amp; 2 Why It Was Great)


## SUMMARY 


 The 2023 MASH reunion featured separate interviews with the cast members, which made it feel like a documentary-style program rather than a true reunion. 


 The reunion didn&#39;t delve deep into MASH&#39;s storytelling, only providing generic stories rather than new and interesting insights. 


 Despite its flaws, the MASH reunion was a privilege to witness, especially considering that it may be the last time the cast reunites on screen to discuss the beloved show.

## Literature Review
In celebration of the 40th anniversary of its finale, MASH had a special two-hour reunion on Fox, which had great and disappointing moments. 




Some elements of MASH&#39;s new reunion worked, while others were ultimately let-downs. The announcement that the legendary sitcom would ring the new year with a special was met with great enthusiasm for several reasons. For starters, the news came out of nowhere and was a welcome development, considering how beloved the series was. Secondly, it had been decades since the last MASH reunion, which took place back in 2002 for the show&#39;s 30th anniversary. Some of the cast had gathered in other venues, but there had been no official reunion since then. Finally, the Fox special aimed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of its finale, &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.&#34;
The 2023 MASH reunion featured the main creative forces behind the series, spearheaded by Alan Alda, who played Captain Benjamin &#34;Hawkeye&#34; Pierce. He was joined by Gary Burghoff (Cpl. Walter “Radar” O’Reilly), Jamie Farr (Cpl./Sgt. Maxwell Q. “Max” Klinger), Mike Farrell (Capt. B.J. Hunnicutt), and Loretta Swit (Maj. Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan). Meanwhile, it also included interviews with Wayne Rogers (Capt. Trapper John McIntyre) and William Christopher (Father John Patrick Francis Mulcahy). Archival footage of the rest of the core cast and behind-the-scenes players were also incorporated. Despite an impressive

 6  Disappointing: The 2023 MASH Reunion Featured Separate Interviews 
The cast members were filmed individually.
        

MASH had an unofficial reunion five years ago on Alda&#39;s podcast, Clear&#43;Vivid, where the surviving cast members joined a virtual call to reminisce about their time on the show. It was fun and insightful. Unfortunately, the format for the Fox special was different. Instead of bringing the ensemble together, they were all filmed separately, which meant that they were isolated throughout the whole time. They were given a set of questions, and they answered on their own. Instead of a reunion, it felt more like a documentary-style program, which kind of lost the whole purpose of the endeavor.



 5  Disappointing: The Reunion Didn’t Go In-Depth With MASH’s Storytelling 
The MASH reunion mostly had generic stories.





Running for 11 seasons, MASH doesn&#39;t have any shortage of great behind-the-scenes stories. The big cast departures, from McLean Stevenson&#39;s Henry Blake&#39;s death to Burghoff&#39;s Radar&#39;s discharge, not to mention the behind-the-scenes creative process, there&#39;s a wealth of great stories that the reunion could have tackled. Unfortunately, the details that it discussed were all on-the-surface details. Whether that was due to time constraints or the format is uncertain. However, the surviving actors could have been given more interesting questions instead of what they got. In the end, they came up with generic details — things that have long been known about MASH, instead of coming up with fresh gems.




 4  Great: The MASH Reunion Featured All Of Its Major Cast and Creatives 
The new MASH reunion was well-represented.
        

The surviving MASH actors have been forthcoming about being fond of talking about the show. Swit and Farr are regularly on convention circuits, where they continue to discuss their love for the series and the people they worked with during its more than a decade-stint on the air. In 2022, Alda and Farrell reunited for a private celebration of MASH&#39;s 50th anniversary, although they commemorated their reunion by sharing an adorable image on social media. The Clear&#43;Vivid episode had the most cast members assembled in one place, and that was just in audio format.
One thing that the MASH Fox reunion did better was it also featured insights from everyone else who played a big part in the show but have passed away. Rogers and Christopher&#39;s interviews were taken a year before their deaths, while the rest of the cast were featured thanks to content from archives. The special even got insights from behind-the-scenes creatives such as Burt Metcalfe and Larry Gelbart, who offered a different perspective compared to those who represented MASH on screen. They were also able to discuss how exactly the series came to be on the heels of the success of Robert Altman&#39;s film. Overall, the new reunion was well-represented.

MASH is one of the most groundbreaking shows ever. While it maintained its quality throughout its run, some of its seasons were better than others.


 3  Disappointing: MASH Reunion Glossed Over The Finale 
&#34;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen&#34; was released in 1983.
        

Throughout its run, MASH had countless accolades. It was nominated for over 100 Emmy Awards during its 11-year stint on CBS, winning 14. It has a Peabody Award and several Golden Globes. These awards prove its overall storytelling quality. However, MASH is probably best known for its finale — &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen,&#34; which is still both the most-watched finale of any television series and the most-watched episode of a scripted series. The feature-length send-off to the 4077 was reportedly watched by 125 million viewers, although even Alda noted in the reunion that that figure may not even be accurate, considering the limitations of information-gathering capabilities at that point.


MASH&#39;s finale is celebrating its 40th year, and for a milestone that coincides with the reunion, it wasn&#39;t able to fully discuss it. The episode was the final subject discussed in the Fox special because it tackled matters in chronological order. However, the event didn&#39;t allow enough time for the actors and creatives to talk more about the legendary finale. Instead, it was almost glossed over, which was a disservice to the outing, considering how seminal it was to the war comedy-drama and TV, in general. Looking back, it would have been better if the players were able to share more about &#34;Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen.&#34;





 2  Disappointing: MASH Reunion Lacked Fun Elements 
The format made the MASH 2023 special way too formal.
        

During the 2002 MASH reunion that aired on Fox, the cast physically gathered in the recreated 4077 compound, which allowed everyone to interact with each other — even those who weren&#39;t able to work with each other on the series. Because of this, the actors and creatives were able to trade stories and add context to others, which is something that the new endeavor didn&#39;t have. Granted that it could be disorganized and rowdy, especially when everyone became eager at the same time, at least it was fun and exciting — a great reflection of how the 4077 actually was. The 2023 reunion failed to highlight the personalities of the actors.

It was the right time to do another MASH reunion.



All things considered, one would be hard-pressed to find any fan who didn&#39;t appreciate the new MASH reunion. Despite its lapses, which were primarily rooted in the format chosen, it was still great to see the major players that made it the legendary show that it was. Aside from that, the remaining cast members are also in getting older, and while all of them are still actively pursuing their respective endeavors, it isn&#39;t outside the realm of possibility that this may be the last time that this group will reunite on the screen to discuss all things about MASH. Because of that, the event was a privilege.
