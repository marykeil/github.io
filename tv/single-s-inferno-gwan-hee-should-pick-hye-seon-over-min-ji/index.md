# Single s Inferno Gwan-hee Should Pick Hye-seon Over Min-ji


## SUMMARY 



  Lee Gwan-hee should choose Choi Hye-Seon over Min-ji in Netflix&#39;s Single&#39;s Inferno season 3.   Min-ji&#39;s behavior is unattractive and immature, making her a less desirable choice for Gwan-hee.   Hye-Seon&#39;s positive and level-headed demeanor makes her a better match for Gwan-hee&#39;s chaotic arrogance.

## Literature Review
Gwan-hee&#39;s in a love triangle with Hye-seon and Min-ji on Single&#39;s Inferno, but after Min-ji&#39;s behavior, is Gwan-hee better off with Hye-seo?




Netflix&#39;s Korean dating show Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 is almost over, and there are many reasons why Lee Gwan-hee should pick Choi Hye-Seon, not Min-ji. 12 single contestants, six male and six female, have been living on &#34;Hell Island&#34; in rough conditions with minimal supplies, having to prepare their own food outdoors while living in what appears to be renovated shipping containers. They all get to know each other as they compete for dates and other rewards. If they successfully couple up, they can escape the inferno for a night in paradise, a luxury hotel.




During the Single&#39;s Inferno season 3 cast&#39;s first matching session, professional basketball player Lee Gwan-hee matched with student Choi Hye-Seon, and they spent a fun night in paradise together. However, halfway through the season, a new girl, Min-ji, arrived and shook things up. She showed interest in Gwan-hee and even pulled him aside to talk. He implied to Min-ji that he was attracted to her. In an on-camera interview, Gwan-hee referred to Min-ji as the one he had been waiting for. However, when Hye-Seon chooses to take Gwan-hee to paradise, Min-ji&#39;s reaction should make him think twice.

 Who Is Gwan-hee? 
          




At 36 years old, Lee Gwan-hee is Single&#39;s Inferno season 3&#39;s oldest single contestant. He&#39;s a professional basketball player who plays in the shooting guard position for the LG Sakers. The tall and extremely confident Gwan-hee has been extremely popular with the ladies, especially later in the season. Before Min-ji came along, he initially matched with Choi Hye-Seon and later also matched with Yun Ha-jeong, whom he had chemistry and lively banter with. Gwan-hee had been interested in all three women, but offended all three of them by pointing them out openly, referring to them as &#34;this one&#34; or &#34;that one.&#34;



 Min-ji&#39;s Unattractive Behavior 
          

Min-ji was a late addition to the season and was involved in a Single&#39;s Inferno love triangle with Lee Jin-seok as she also liked Gwan-hee. When Hye-seon won the women&#39;s challenge, she got first choice to pick the men she wanted to take to paradise and chose Gwan-hee. Min-ji was disappointed placing in third because she had also wanted to take Gwan-hee but had to settle for selecting Park Min-kyu. Both couples shared a helicopter ride, during which Min-ji repeatedly grabbed Gwan-hee&#39;s arm and then sobbed into Min-kyu&#39;s shirt. Her overly emotional behavior was inappropriate and made her look immature.






 Why Hye-seon Is The Better Choice 
          

Once, during a group meal, Lee Jin-seok referred to Hye-seon as a &#34;cheerful woman,&#34; an apt description. Hye-Seon is always positive and calmly smiling. During the helicopter ride, Hye-Seon chose to pretend not to notice Min-ji&#39;s emotional outburst. During the entire time, Hye-Seon simply looked out the window and enjoyed the helicopter ride. Her stability and level-headed attitude are the perfect counterpoint to Gwan-hee&#39;s chaotic arrogance. With the Single&#39;s Inferno finale coming soon, it&#39;s hard to say who will leave together and who will end up alone.
