## Literature Review
90 Day Fiancé star Kimberly Rochelle is in big trouble after lashing out at a fan-favorite cast member during The Other Way season 5 Tell-All.




90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way star Kimberly Rochelle insulted a fan-favorite cast member and is now facing their wrath. Kimberly is a 30-year-old American woman who moved to India during The Other Way season 5. Kimberly had fallen in love with Jaipur-based Tejaswi Goswami aka TJ after meeting him online. Kimberly claimed she had dreamed of TJ months before meeting him thanks to her clairvoyance. However, as revealed in The Other Way season 5 finale, TJ may not have been Kimberly&#39;s dream man. Kimberly and TJ had a shouting match as he told her to go back to America, and she screamed her lungs out at him.




Kimberly and TJ&#39;s storyline ended with her ear-piercing scream, but there&#39;s still a lot more left, according to a preview of The Other Way season 5 Tell-All posted by Redditor Old-Sport3218.


 

The video shows Kimberly on set in New York while TJ has joined her via a video call for the reunion episode. The clip shows Jenny Slatten and Sumit Singh from previous seasons of 90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way weighing in on Kimberly and TJ&#39;s relationship. Jenny claims Kimberly seemed very unappreciative of everything. Kimberly is not in the mood to listen as she snaps, &#34;Your opinion doesn&#39;t matter to me, Jenny.&#34; Jenny proceeds to call her a &#34;very entitled and spoiled brat.&#34; Kimberly replies, &#34;You&#39;re a c***.&#34;

Kimberly&#39;s offensive language leaves all her fellow 90 Day Fiancé cast members on set in shock. Armando Rubio, Shekinah Garner, and Sarper Güven feel their jaws drop. Jenny maintains her composure but is red in the face as she challenges Kimberly. She threatens Kimberly to come to India and come to Jaipur. &#34;I&#39;d love to meet you,&#34; she tells Kimberly, while the latter sternly tells Jenny, &#34;Come on baby, I&#39;ll give you my address.&#34; Kimberly and TJ have been feuding with Jenny and Sumit for a while now. They first spoke about Jenny and Sumit earlier this month during her Instagram Live session with fans, which might have been after the stars filmed the reunion episode.

Kimberly was asked if she&#39;d met Jenny and Sumit (as shared by shabootydotcom). Kimberly said no and added, &#34;They don&#39;t interest me. They&#39;re fake.&#34; When fans asked her why she was hating on Jenny, Kimberly said she was just stating her opinion and not hating anyone. Kimberly referred to Jenny and Sumit as &#34;fake people.&#34; She claimed that their story on 90 Day Fiancé wasn&#39;t genuine. Meanwhile, TJ also commented that he had no interest in meeting either Sumit or his fellow Indian cast member Rishi Singh. TJ indirectly called both of them losers. Jenny and Sumit decided to handle the situation calmly.




While they did respond to Kimberly and TJ&#39;s accusations, they were classy in their approach. They said Kimberly and TJ were immature kids who were acting like brats. The couple asked the audience to decide who was real and who was fake. Jenny has received a lot of praise for this situation because of her unproblematic nature. She has always managed to steer herself away from the drama and troublemakers. Sadly, this time around, her feud with Kimberly seems to have taken a serious turn.



90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way airs Mondays at 8 p.m. EST on TLC.
