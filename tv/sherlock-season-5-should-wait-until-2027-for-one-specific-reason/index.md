# Sherlock Season 5 Should Wait Until 2027 (For One Specific Reason)


## SUMMARY 



  Fans have waited years for Sherlock season 5, but there has been minimal word on its release, making the outlook bleak.   The schedules of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, who play Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, have made it difficult to start production on season 5.   A decade-long gap between seasons 4 and 5 could provide a fresh start for the series, allowing for a more interesting return to the characters and a definitive end to the series.

## Literature Review

The door has been left slightly open for Sherlock season 5, but after so many years, the BBC might as well wait a few more before wrapping things up. 




Sherlock season 5 is still a possibility, but after all these years, it might as well wait a little longer. Fans have eagerly awaited the next installment in the BBC series season 4 aired in 2017, but there has been minimal word on this front. After all these years, returning to Sherlock Holmes and John Watson&#39;s characters would be a little more complicated, making the outlook on season 5 look even more bleak. However, considering the shortcomings of Sherlock seasons 3 and 4, this extended break might not be a bad thing.




The hit series put a modern twist on the Sherlock Holmes stories created by author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, with season 1 of Sherlock first airing in 2010. Over the next seven years, four total seasons were released, each of which took the twists of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson&#39;s mystery solving to the next level. Unfortuantely, however, Sherlock never came to an official close, so viewers have been left in limbo for several years. Of course, the series wasn&#39;t canceled either, so there&#39;s still hope.

                  All 4 Seasons Of Sherlock, Ranked Worst To Best   Sherlock adapted the detective’s classic stories across four seasons, which ultimately varied in quality, with one season being notably strongest.   


 Sherlock Season 5 Has Been Up In The Air Since 2017 
         

Sherlock season 4 aired in 2017, which means it&#39;s been a very long wait for season 5. Many have given up hope, but creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have both stated that the door hasn&#39;t been officially closed. The problem with getting the ball rolling has been the schedules of stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, who played Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, respectively. The pair weren&#39;t household names when they first took on their roles in Sherlock, but their series thrust both men into the spotlight. Since then, Cumberbatch and Freeman have both grown rather busy.




With projects in major franchises like the MCU and Lord of the Rings, as well as a spattering of other movies and TV series—all of which likely pay more than what Cumberbatch and Freeman were making on Sherlock—there hasn&#39;t been the time to make Sherlock season 5 a reality. Gatiss has said (via Screen Rant) that he doesn&#39;t think Sherlock is what Cumberbatch and Freeman &#34;want to do now&#34; but that he would &#34;start writing it [season 5] tomorrow&#34; if they did. This is just the smallest shimmer of hope and a sign that Sherlock needs to hold out for a 2027 release to lure the stars (and audiences) back in.



 Returning To Sherlock In 2027 Would Be More Like A Reunion 
          

Since Sherlock season 4 aired in 2017, it would be a little strange to have a casual return to the characters after all this time. However, if season 5 were released in 2027—exactly a decade later—it would be more like a single reunion event than a typical TV installment. After ten years, audiences will expect some time to have passed in-universe as well, which means a more interesting return to the characters.




Additionally, if Sherlock season 5 were released a decade after season 4, no one would expect a season 6. Sherlock and John&#39;s stories would likely be wrapped up once and for all, which would mean a definitive end to the series. This would make Cumberbatch and Freeman&#39;s return more feasible since they would know that this final installment would be their last time returning to play the characters. It would be a much shorter commitment.



 A Long Break Gives Sherlock Time To Start Fresh After Season 4&#39;s Shortcomings 
          

Another benefit of leaving a decade-long gap between Sherlock season 4 and 5 is the opportunity for a fresh start after the series&#39; shortcomings. Sherlock&#39;s story had quite a fall from grace after the finale of season 2, since season 3 returned with an episode that never delivered on the promise to explain how Sherlock survived the Reichenbach Fall. Then, things only got worse as the series segued into unpopular story arcs, such as the reveal that Mary Watson was secretly a freelance assassin. Finally, Sherlock season 4 jumped into the story of Sherlock and Mycroft&#39;s sister, Eurus Holmes, which also fell a little flat.




Still, the frequent calls for a Sherlock season 5 prove that fans are still hungry for more despite the downward trend after season 2. After so many years of radio silence regarding Sherlock&#39;s character, 2027 could be the perfect time to return to this version of 221B Baker Street for the last time with a fresh slate. It would mean an opportunity for the BBC series to end things on a high note. Of course, Sherlock season 5 could feasibly be announced at any time, and fans would be happy, but at this point, it might as well wait.

              Sherlock  In this incarnation of Sherlock from creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman assume the roles of Sherlock and Watson as they establish their partnership and begin solving strange mysteries throughout the U.K. and beyond. Set in a more 2010&#39;s modern setting, Sherlock&#39;s eccentric and complex nature is accentuated as he solves seemingly supernatural crimes with unparalleled intellect while struggling to connect with others on a human level. Meanwhile, Watson blogs the stories summarizing their cases while building a strained but caring friendship with his new partner.
