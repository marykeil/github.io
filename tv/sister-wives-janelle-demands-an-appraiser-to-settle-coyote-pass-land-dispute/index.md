# Sister Wives  Janelle Demands An Appraiser To Settle Coyote Pass Land Dispute


## SUMMARY 



  Janelle Brown believes the Coyote Pass property should be divided equally and insists on getting a professional appraisal to ensure a fair distribution.   Meri Brown disagrees with Kody&#39;s plan to split the property unevenly and asserts that she deserves a share based on her financial contributions to Coyote Pass.   Both Janelle and Meri are justified in demanding a fair share of the land, as they have valid reasons and contributions to the family that should be considered.

## Literature Review
Sister Wives’ Janelle Brown doesn’t think Kody Brown’s split of Coyote Pass land is justified. She wants everyone to receive an equal and fair share.




Janelle Brown from Sister Wives thinks the family needs a professional because Kody Brown isn’t fairly dividing the Coyote Pass property. The Brown family’s onscreen journey began in 2010 when TLC gave them their own reality TV series. At the time, Kody was married to Meri, Janelle, and Christine Brown and was looking to marry his fourth wife, Robyn Brown. The polygamous family went through numerous ups and downs, from cozy gatherings to personal disputes. Eventually, the jealousy became so great that Christine left Kody and later married another man. In Sister Wives season 18, Janelle and Meri also concluded their relationship with Kody and moved on.




In 2018, Kody and his four wives purchased Coyote Pass in Arizona. Unfortunately, things didn’t turn out well for the Browns. In a recent preview of Sister Wives, courtesy of ET, Kody proposes dividing the land since everyone was splitting up. He shares that Christine had traded her piece of land with him, so he and Robyn deserved 8 acres worth of lots, with 4 acres going to Janelle and 2 acres to Meri.



However, Janelle claims the property must be divided equally. She says, “There’s 14 acres. I think it’s time we have a real appraisal.” She shares that the family needs a professional to help them decide how to divide the land fairly.

 Meri Brown Doesn&#39;t Think Kody&#39;s Coyote Pass Decisions Are &#34;Fair&#34; 
          




Meri isn&#39;t too keen on Kody’s plan either. In the preview, she&#39;s unhappy and doesn&#39;t think Kody’s idea to split the property unevenly is acceptable. The single mom says, “It seems like he has already made the decision and I don’t think that is fair.” Meri claims that while she didn’t have a strong relationship with Kody for nearly a decade, that doesn’t mean she only gets 2 acres out of the 14-acre land. She claims that she financially contributed to Coyote Pass and deserves to have “some of the property.”

Janelle is right to call out Kody and demand a rightful split of Coyote Pass. While she hasn’t been on the same page with fellow sister wife Meri, she’s mature enough to know that every party involved with the property deserves a justified share. Kody is infamous for his narcissism and only thinks about himself. With the ongoing splits, he wants to claim the biggest portion by making excuses. Janelle knows Kody too well and has lived nearly three decades with him. She understands that only an appraiser can put her former husband in his place.




Like Janelle, Meri isn’t wrong to ask for a fair share in Coyote Pass as she has been helping the Brown family financially. She is right to stand her ground and let Kody know that he can’t decide who is or isn’t worthy of getting a major part of the land. Meri may not have had an intimate relationship with her husband for years, but she should get a fair portion of the pie, just like Robyn and Janelle. Hopefully, the Sister Wives star will involve a smart lawyer in the land dispute to get what she deserves and teach Kody a lesson.



Sister Wives airs Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on TLC.
