Jack&#39;s plan to save Dixon and O&#39;Donnell is quite simple, but extremely difficult to pull off because of how big of a risk it is.

Summary

  Reacher season 2 ends with the 110th Special Investigations Unit accomplishing their mission for retribution, but that&#39;s only half of what happens in the action-packed finale.   Jack&#39;s plan to save Dixon and O&#39;Donnell is quite simple, but extremely difficult to pull off because of how big of a risk it is.   Swan is confirmed to be dead, and it&#39;s revealed that he didn&#39;t cause the deaths of Franz, Orozco, and Sanchez. Instead, he blew the whistle on Langston&#39;s illegal operations, causing him to be killed.  







Reacher season 2 ends with the 110th Special Investigations Unit accomplishing their mission for retribution, but that&#39;s only half of what happens in the action-packed finale. Jack Reacher started his new mission with the death of his and Frances Neagley&#39;s former military teammate, Cal Franz, but his murder was only the beginning of a deep mystery that eventually involved their other friends, Manuel Orozco and Jorge Sanchez also turning up dead. Making it worse were the suspicions that another Special Investigator, Tony Swan, may have had them killed.

The case proved to be far too dangerous just for Jack and Neagley, so they brought in other allies — fellow Special Investigators, David O&#39;Donnell and Karla Dixon, as well as New York police Guy Russo. Admittedly, being mostly surrounded by people who previously knew Jack altered the character&#39;s usual stand-off demeanor. It also set up a less surprising finale, since there was no doubt that the 110th Special Investigations Unit would fail at seeking vengeance against those who killed their own. Instead, the more interesting part of the Reacher season 2 finale is what comes after Jack and his team win.




                  Reacher Already Spoiled Which Characters Survive Season 2 (Way Before The Finale)   Long before its finale, Amazon Prime Video has already spoiled who survives at the end of Jack&#39;s fight against New Age in Reacher season 2.    


 The Special Investigators&#39; Reacher Season 2 Finale Plan Explained (In Full) 
Jack&#39;s plan is quite simple but needs proper execution.
         

Jack&#39;s plan to save Dixon and O&#39;Donnell is quite simple, but extremely difficult to pull off because of how big of a risk it is. He lets himself be captured, so he is able to infiltrate the facility, while Neagley, with the help of Senator Lavoy&#39;s people, works their way outside and uses the element of surprise to get Langston off balance. Granted that there are some curveballs along the way, but the Special Investigators are capable enough to easily adapt to the situation. After a tussle in the helicopter, Jack keeps his word and throws Langston off the aircraft.






 Why Reacher &amp; Dixon Don&#39;t Stay Together 
It&#39;s a less sad break-up compared to Roscoe&#39;s.
          

Reacher season 1 ends with Jack breaking up with Roscoe Conklin after engaging in an affair with her throughout the case in Margrave. In season 2, Jack began a new romance with fellow Special Investigator, Dixon, but once again decided to part ways. This time, however, their separation is less sad compared to Roscoe&#39;s, primarily because Dixon understands that Jack is unable to settle in one place. The pair spend the night one last time and then bid each other farewell. That being said, it doesn&#39;t mean that they can&#39;t reunite in the future.



 What Really Happened To Tony Swan 
Swan is confirmed to be dead.
          




The 110th Special Investigations Unit&#39;s bond is questioned in Reacher season 2 when Swan became a suspected co-conspirator of New Age Technology. As the evidence against him piled up, Jack and the team started to have opposing views on his innocence. In the end, it&#39;s revealed that Swan didn&#39;t cause the deaths of Franz, Orozco, and Sanchez. Instead, he was the one who blew the whistle on Langston&#39;s illegal operations, causing him to be killed. The villain only kept his eyeballs for verification purposes — something that he revealed to Jack in the Reacher season 2 finale.



 Reacher Season 2&#39;s Ending Sets Up Future 110th Cameos 
If Finlay can return, then the 110th can as well.
          

At the end of Reacher season 2, Jack, Neagley, O&#39;Donnell, and Dixon all go their separate ways. The four&#39;s survival from the New Age ordeal allows future seasons of the Amazon Prime Video series to bring them back, in case the narrative calls for it. While Child&#39;s books take on an anthology type of storytelling — something that the show is also adapting, Reacher season 2 breaks one of the novels&#39; rules by bringing back Oscar Finlay in Reacher season 2 following his involvement in season 1. This sets a precedent for the Special Investigators&#39; return.




                  Reacher Season 3&#39;s Story Tease Fixes Season 2&#39;s Biggest Problem   Long before it premieres on Amazon, Reacher season 3&#39;s story tease will be able to address the biggest problem that is currently plaguing season 2.    



 Why Reacher Keeps The Money (&amp; What He Does With It) 
Jack uses the money to do good.
          

After taking care of Langston and his men in Reacher season 2, Jack and the Special Investigators wrap things up by going after AM. Interestingly, the usually calm and collected villain acts panicked; he tries to talk his way out of the situation by reminding Jack that he&#39;s just the middleman in this whole transaction. Still, he&#39;s so far involved in the crime that there&#39;s no doubt that he&#39;s going to end up dead. Meanwhile, Senator Lavoy&#39;s people are arrested by Homeland Security, with Jack banking on Joe&#39;s ties with the organization.




Instead of surrendering the money that they confiscated from AM, however, Jack decides to keep it to himself. He distributes it to everyone who has been victimized by the whole ordeal, sending them to the surviving family members of Franz, Orozco, Sanchez, and even Russo. Meanwhile, Swan&#39;s cut gets donated to an animal shelter in his name. For the surviving members of the 110th, Neagley&#39;s father gets round-the-clock medical care, as part of her portion; Dixon gets his under his kids&#39; names, setting them up for the future; and Dixon receives enough to start her own company.



 Did The Special Investigators Really Need To Kill EVERYONE In Reacher Season 2&#39;s Ending? 
Jack and his team want nothing but revenge.
          

When Jack set out to find the killers of Franz, he was already determined to make them pay. In the end, even if Langston is the mastermind of the whole brutal murder scheme, he and the team decide to make sure that everyone involved pays for what happened to his friends — including people who were just paid by Langston. Considering the bond of the 110th Special Investigations Unit and the way some of its members were killed, it&#39;s understandable that Jack, Neagley, Dixon, and O&#39;Donnell decide to kill everyone who played a part in their deaths.






 Reacher&#39;s Final Words To Neagley Explained 
&#34;Yes, Master Sergeant.&#34;
         

Since the whole operation in Reacher season 2 started with Jack reuniting with Neagley, it makes sense that it also ends with their separation. While saying their goodbyes, Neagley softly commands him to be better at keeping in touch while he wanders the country and ends with a stern &#34;is that understood?&#34;. Jack simply answers &#34;Yes, Master Sargeant,&#34; referring to her rank in the military.



 What To Expect From Reacher Season 3 
Jack is off to his next mission.
          

Production for Reacher season 3 is now in progress, although plot details about it are still scant at the moment. That being said, Alan Ritchson has teased that Jack will find himself isolated in a new city and will potentially deal with a case that doesn&#39;t have anything to do with his past. There are several options from Child&#39;s books that Amazon Prime Video can adapt next. Perhaps, once Reacher season 2 is officially finished, the next novel that the series will tackle gets confirmed.






All episodes of Reacher season 2 can now be streamed on Amazon Prime Series.




              Reacher  Produced by Amazon Prime Video, Reacher adapts Lee Child&#39;s Jack Reacher book series to live-action. The series follows veteran Military Police Officer Jack Reacher as he unravels a dangerous conspiracy in the fictional town of Margrave, Georgia. Played by the towering Alan Ritchson, the titular hero collaborates with officer Roscoe Conklin (Willa Fitzgerald) and Chief Detective Oscar Finlay (Malcolm Goodwin) to clean his name and save Margrave from crime and corruption.
