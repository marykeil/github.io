## Literature Review

Rotten Tomatoes is often used to rate various television shows and films, but some TV shows did so badly, the site gave it a complete score of zero.




While there are plenty of great TV shows out in the world, there are others that fell flat with a 0% Rotten Tomatoes rating. It&#39;s worth noting that there are several TV shows on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% rating, but they aren&#39;t included. This is for several reasons, such as there being no audience ratings at all to compare it against, or a significantly high audience rating, with it appearing that Rotten Tomatoes hasn&#39;t provided enough reviews from top critics yet and, therefore, has been marked as 0%.
Rotten Tomatoes ratings are broken up into two sections: the critic score and the audience score, allowing the wider public to give their opinion. Even if a show is rated badly, this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean cancelation, and plenty of bad series have become guilty pleasure TV shows. Still, it&#39;s interesting to see which shows, over the years, Rotten Tomatoes has deemed to be the bottom of the barrel.









 








 11  Saint George 
2014, Airing On ABC
        

Saint George, starring George Lopez, was one of the few TV shows with a Latinx lead. The story follows Lopez&#39;s entrepreneur who is trying to balance his family while teaching a class at the local night school. The 2014 sitcom&#39;s main problem, according to critics, was its use of cheap jokes aimed at the Mexican community, as well as the overdone recycling over other sitcom tropes. While audience reviews were minimal, it was compared to Lopez&#39;s earlier show George Lopez (commonly referred to as The George Lopez Show), but weaker overall. Saint George only lasted for one season, although it&#39;s clear as to why.





 10  $..! My Dad Says 
2010 - 2011, Airing On CBS
        

$..! My Dad Says aired for one season, beginning in 2010, based on the X (formerly Twitter) feed from Justin Halpern. The show follows three-time divorcee Ed (William Shatner) who is prone to exploding into politically incorrect rants, and his adult son Henry (Jonathan Sadowski), who is forced to move back in with his father. $..! My Dad Says unfortunately wasn&#39;t able to recapture the same charm that its source material was known for. It also felt more like a collection of one-liners, rather than a TV show with an actual plot, but its one positive element was Shatner&#39;s performance.





 9  Hunters 
2016, Airing On Syfy


 







Syfy&#39;s Hunters, the 2016 show based on Whitley Strieber&#39;s best-selling novel Alien Hunter, didn&#39;t have the same success as its source. The show only lasted for one season, during which Hunters faced criticism about its low-budget visual aesthetic and clunky dialogue. Critics also felt that it borrowed too many familiar elements from other TV shows and lacked originality, as well as the plot being confusing and difficult to follow.





 8  Secret Agent Man 
2000, Airing On UPN
        

Despite having no audience scoring, Rotten Tomatoes top critics gave Secret Agent Man a 0% rating. Top critics found the show to be too predictable, almost unidentifiable compared to other TV shows with spy characters. There was also criticism around the show&#39;s dialogue, and how its delivery was often monotone and lacking any sort of humor. However, its cast did include Saw star Costas Mandylor, but the actor was unable to replicate the dramatic performance he was already known for.





 7  My Big Fat Greek Life 
2003, Airing On CBS
        

My Big Fat Greek Life aired for one season in 2003, as a continuation of the 2002 movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding. While the film was a huge success, the sitcom was unable to replicate the same appeal. Its main criticisms come from the characterization, and while the likes of returning My Big Fat Greek Wedding cast star Nia Vardalos was generally interesting, critics felt that the show relied too heavily on Greek stereotypes. Despite being humorous to a degree, one critic believed that My Big Fat Greek Life was just over the top but lacked humor.





 6  Charlie&#39;s Angels 
2011, Airing On ABC
        

  Charlie&#39;s Angels (2011)  


  Release Date    September 22, 2011     Cast    Annie Ilonzeh , Minka Kelly , Rachael Taylor , Ramon Rodriguez     Seasons    1    


The 2011 Charlie&#39;s Angels was highly anticipated, given it was remake of the beloved original series that aired from 1976 to 1981. Unfortunately, after only four episodes had aired, the show was canceled by ABC, and its final episode went unaired altogether in the United States. Charlie&#39;s Angels was criticized for its low production value and repetitive elements taken from other crime procedurals. Critics were dismissive of Charlie&#39;s Angels, with many finding it boring and skipping through its plot too rapidly.





 5  Dads 
2013 - 2014, Airing On Fox


 







Despite having Austin Powers star Seth Green as its protagonist, the 2013 sitcom Dads only aired one season before it was canceled just before the release of its season finale. Its story follows two young men, business partners, whose fathers have to move in with them. Despite having a premise that should have resulted in plenty of hilarious situations, critics felt that its characters were rather whiny and bigoted, and just overall bad stereotypes. Altogether, Dads was a cringeworthy and forgettable show.





 4  The Reunion 
2022 - 2023, Airing On RTLTVI
        

French mini-series The Reunion aired in 2022, with the audience rating being only 15% to the 0% from critics. The thriller tells a story spread out across time, with two main storylines set in 1997 and 2022, but its main criticism was that the jump between time periods often felt clumsy and more like flashbacks, rather than separate plot beats. Both audiences and critics also complained about finding The Reunion hard to follow, and its low-level production value didn&#39;t help with this. While a mystery show, numerous plot twists also felt far-fetched and incredibly unlikely, which made it harder for audiences to be invested.





 3  South Of Hell 
2015, Airing On WE TV


 







Supernatural horror South of Hell was met with mixed reviews but ultimately struck out completely. Its writing, treated seriously in the show, was generally met with laughs rather than gasps, with elements of its story coming across as more cringe-inducing than chill-inducing. It was also criticized for its terrible production value, which, given South of Hell is a horror, should have been a priority. However, it was praised for its casting, especially Mena Suvari&#39;s performance as the protagonist, Maria. Still, that wasn&#39;t enough to get its critical rating off 0%.





 2  On Our Own 
1994 - 1995, Airing On ABC
        

On Our Own aired for one season on ABC from 1994 to 1995, following the story of six orphans, all played by the real-life Smollett siblings, being raised by the eldest and seventh, Josh (Ralph Louis Harris). What seems like a sweet premise gets a little bit unusual when Josh assumes the identity of &#34;Aunt Jelcinda&#34; to trick the local child services officer. Compared to the likes of Mrs Doubtfire, its limited reviews highlighted Harris&#39; lack of charm, as well as criticizing the show for being derivative.





 1  Tandav 
2021, Airing On Amazon Prime Video
        

Amazon Prime Video&#39;s thrillers have generally been well received, but Tandav unfortunately didn&#39;t meet the same standards. The 9-part series follows various Indian politicians and the topics of power and control, and its current youth entering the industry, ready to overthrow them. There&#39;s no audience score yet, but critics felt that the political elements of the show were being force-fed to audiences and too dumbed down. It was also criticized for relying on clichÃ©s and outdated tropes, making it not terribly memorable.
