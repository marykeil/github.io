# X-Men Movie Writer Reveals The Secret History Of Magneto s Iconic Helmet 24 Years After Its Debut


## SUMMARY 



  The writer of the first X-Men movie, David Hayter, has surprised longtime fans by revealing the secret behind Magneto&#39;s iconic helmet.   The idea of Magneto&#39;s helmet blocking telepathy, which is now a staple in the movies and comics, was decided on a whim as a response to a simple question.   The helmet blocking telepathy makes complete sense, given Magneto and Charles&#39; long-time frenemy relationship.

## Literature Review

A shocking revelation has come from the writer of 2000&#39;s X-Men, David Hayter, who revealed a secret history about Magneto&#39;s helmet 24 years later.




The writer of the first X-Men movie, David Hayter, has revealed a secret behind the history of Magneto&#39;s iconic helmet that has surprised many longtime fans 24 years after the movie was released. X-Men became a pivotal movie in the superhero genre after finding huge success in 2000, kick-starting the genre revival that would lead to a long-running X-Men franchise and opening the door for the eventual MCU. While its legendary status is commonly agreed upon, the fact that it also invented a core part of Magneto&#39;s current identity in the comics has come as a surprise to many.




David Hayter revealed via X that the idea of Magneto&#39;s helmet blocking telepathy, which has since been a staple of his outfit in both movies and comics, was decided somewhat on a whim as a response to the question, &#34;Why couldnâ€™t Xavier just make Magneto go to sleep or something?&#34; After nobody had a straight answer to the admittedly quite glaring question, it was agreed that his helmet should be his countermeasure. Unsurprisingly, this has caused a stir among those who considered the now-canonical Magneto trait to have been ripped straight from the comics; yet that isn&#39;t the case.

 What Else X-Men Comics Have Taken From Movies &amp; TV Shows 
          

Magneto&#39;s helmet is not the only thing that became comic book canon after first being coined by movie and TV renditions of the titular characters. X-Men also reinvented Toad, who was simply capable of leaping large distances in the comics before Ray Park&#39;s portrayal bestowed him with a bevy of new abilities: most notably, his prehensile elastic tongue. Rogue, meanwhile, received a nerf after X-Men removed her inherent abilities of flight and super-strength, which the comics later emulated. Most recently, the comics have leaned into the narrative that Wanda and Pietro Maximoff are not mutant children of Magneto.

As for TV shows, Logan&#39;s X-23 made her debut in the X-Men: Evolution TV series in 2000 before then making her way to the comics. The MCU&#39;s recent reveal that Kamala Khan is a mutant is also something that the comics have recently adopted. The relationship between the comics and their TV and movie adaptations has apparently become more symbiotic than ever and shows just how seminal X-Men was at the time of its conception.
