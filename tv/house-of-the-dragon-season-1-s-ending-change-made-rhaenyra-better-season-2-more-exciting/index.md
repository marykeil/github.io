# House Of The Dragon Season 1 s Ending Change Made Rhaenyra Better (&amp; Season 2 More Exciting)


## SUMMARY 



  House of the Dragon season 1 almost had a slightly different final scene, including more of Daemon, Rhaenyra screaming, and a shot of Syrax.   The show ended up taking a more subtle approach to portraying Rhaenyra&#39;s pain and anger, and the result was more powerful.   The final scenes, and the changes, also work to perfectly set up House of the Dragon season 2 and the beginning of the war.

## Literature Review
House of the Dragon made a subtle but important change to the ending of season 1, which had key benefits for Rhaenyra Targaryen and season 2&#39;s story.




House of the Dragon season 1 originally ended in a slightly different way, and the change was much better for Rhaenyra Targaryen. Rhaenyra lost two of her children in House of the Dragon season 1’s ending, first through the stillbirth of Visenya and then with Aemond and Vhagar killing Lucerys. They were two shocking, devastating twists, and culminated with one final shot of Rhaenyra, illuminated by a glowing fire, clearly hell-bent on revenge.




Said revenge will play out in House of the Dragon season 2, as the Dance of the Dragons truly begins. However, that set up could have been a little different with the original season 1 ending, which was revealed in storyboards [via Adam Prescott]. That would’ve had a slightly longer build-up on Daemon heading to tell Rhaenyra the news, and her screaming when she finds out, before cutting to a shot of her dragon, Syrax. Although not drastically different, the changes were very important for the Game of Thrones prequel.

 House Of The Dragon Season 1’s Changed Ending Was More Powerful 
The more subtle approach to Rhaenyra&#39;s pain and fury proves less is more.
          




It&#39;s understandable why there was a different plan for House of the Dragon season 1&#39;s final scene, as having Rhaenyra scream is certainly a dramatic choice. Ultimately, though, going with the more subtle option is more powerful on-screen, and better conveys her switch from an unspeakable sadness into burning anger. Removing the scream allows the Queen&#39;s actions - the steps forward, the clutching of her stomach, and then turning for one final stare into the camera - to stand fully alone, conveying more anguish and anger than a scream could. It&#39;s more understated, but is masterfully done by Emma D&#39;Arcy.


 

Other choices also helped the moment work better than the original storyboards had planned out. Cutting the dragon was smart, as the finale had already intercut between Rhaenyra and Syrax during Visenya&#39;s stillbirth, and this would&#39;ve risked overplaying that particular hand. Even more important is the decision to reduce Daemon&#39;s role. Unlike the storyboards, this doesn&#39;t begin with the focus on his face, which mostly isn&#39;t shown even as the camera follows him. That means this can truly be Rhaenyra&#39;s moment and hers alone. Given she has just lost so much, and this is her singular pain - and with themes of womanhood at the show&#39;s core - that makes it hit so much harder.






 House of the Dragon Season 1’s Ending Was Perfect For Season 2 
The Dance of the Dragons can now truly begin.
          

The final shot of Rhaenyra is great set up for House of the Dragon season 2, as a means of signaling there is no turning back. Rhaenyra showed a lot of restraint in the final few episodes of season 1, despite all that happened between the greens and the blacks. The ending makes it clear that such restraint is now gone, that a line has been crossed, and that there will be a heavy price to pay for what happened to Lucerys.

By removing Syrax and Daemon, to varying degrees, it ensures there&#39;s no doubt heading into House of the Dragon season 2 (which will release Summer 2024) that Rhaenyra is the one who is very much leading the greens in the war. Further, by taking out the scream or shout, there&#39;s also an element of control to it, which makes it all the more haunting. Rhaenyra had tried to make peace, and her efforts failed, which means the only option left - as the look of pure fury on her face confirms - is war.
