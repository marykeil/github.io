  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Monica and Chandler are one of the cutest couples in Friends - but how did their relationship play out over the years?</p>
<p>Though it was already a hit sitcom at the time, Friends changed forever when Chandler and Monica got together. Ross and Rachel might have gotten more focus when the show was on the air, but long after the show ended, Chandler and Monica are perhaps the most important couple of the series as the audience got to experience so many big moments from the two. Taking a look at the timeline of their relationship highlights some of the biggest and most memorable moments of the series.
With the tragic death of Matthew Perry, many fans have looked back on Chandler&rsquo;s best moments on Friends and found it&rsquo;s impossible to separate them from his relationship with Monica. While it was a risk to put two characters from the ensemble together romantically so late into the series, their chemistry worked so well that it was an easy pairing to cheer for. From the shocking moment they got together to their wedding and planning their future, Chandler and Monica&rsquo;s romance made Friends even better.

<p>How All The Friends Characters Met
How did all of the characters on Friends meet each other? Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of how Monica, Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Phoebe, and Joey became friends.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Go From Being Just Friends To Hooking Up
Seasons 1-4</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 23  &ldquo;The One With The Birth&rdquo;  Chandler offers to marry Monica if she is still single at 40.   Season 3, Episode 25  &ldquo;The One At The Beach&rdquo;  Chandler tries to convince Monica that he would be a great boyfriend.   Season 4, Episode 24  &ldquo;The One With Ross&rsquo; Wedding: Part 2&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler hook up in London. <br>
For the first four seasons of Friends, Monica and Chandler are very just friends, with a very platonic relationship. They both pursue relationships with other people, and the &ldquo;will they/won&rsquo;t they&rdquo; aspect of the show is exclusively on Ross and Rachel. They do have a few cute relationship-adjacent moments, though, that hint to fans at something more to come. In one episode, Chandler suggests to Monica that they be each other&rsquo;s &lsquo;back up&rsquo; person, and spends time showing her what a great boyfriend he would be. It&rsquo;s intended as a joke, but was foreshadowing in hindsight.</p>
<p>They also often seem closer than some of the others on the show, but nothing comes of it. However, Friends went for the risky &ldquo;friends to lovers&rdquo; approach at the end of season 4, when Monica and Chandler hook up in London. Despite the fact that they intend this to be a one-time thing, the season four finale is the episode where Monica and Chandler get together - &lsquo;The One With Ross&rsquo; Wedding: Part 2&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Keep Their Relationship A Secret
Season 5</p>
<p>Season 5, episode 5  &ldquo;The One With The Kips&rdquo;  Joey finds out about Monica and Chandler.   Season 5, episode 11  &ldquo;The One With All The Resolutions&rdquo;  Rachel finds out about Monica and Chandler.   Season 5, episode 14  &ldquo;The One Where Everybody Finds Out&rdquo;  Phoebe and Ross find out about Monica and Chandler.   Season 5, episode 24  &ldquo;The One In Vegas&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler almost marry in Vegas. <br>
For a large part of Friends season 5, Monica and Chandler are sleeping together, but trying to keep it a secret from the rest of their friends. This leads to all kinds of ridiculous hijinks, especially as the gang finds out one by one, and it gets hard to keep track of who knows what — and which lies have been told. However, their secret soon comes out, and the latter part of the season sees Monica and Chandler openly dating, and dealing with the usual ups and downs of a relationship.
The season ends with them even almost getting married in Friends&rsquo; classic Las Vegas episode, but deciding at the end that it is too soon - and they should move in together instead. This season does a fantastic job of making a relationship compelling viewing, without relying on fights or breakups to do it, and it&rsquo;s easy to see how these two are going to end up together.</p>
<p>All 10 Seasons Of Friends, Ranked
Which season of Friends is the best has been debated since the show finished in 2004, but it&rsquo;s undeniable some Friends seasons are better than others.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Move In Together And Propose (Twice)
Season 6</p>
<p>Season 6, Episode 1  &ldquo;The One After Vegas&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler decide to move in together.   Season 6, Episode 6  &ldquo;The One On The Last Night&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler actually move in together.   Season 6, Episode 24  &ldquo;The One With The Proposal&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler get engaged. <br>
Season 6 keeps things moving with the relationship milestones as Monica and Chandler move in together and get engaged over the course of this season. Once again, the season shows how a relationship can be kept interesting without having to have the pair break up and makeup over and over. This season, it&rsquo;s all about learning to live together and forming a relationship that is getting more serious than anyone expected.
&ldquo;The One With The Proposal&rdquo; ended up being the most important Monica and Chandler episode to that point. This is made even more emotional than a usual TV proposal because Richard reappears at the very end when Chandler is trying to make Monica think he isn&rsquo;t going to propose (even though he is). This leaves Monica with what looks like a decision to make. Of course, her decision was made long before, and she proposes to Chandler in a candlelit scene that is one of the most heartwarming of the show.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica&rsquo;s Wedding
Season 7</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 5  &ldquo;The One With The Engagement Picture&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler try and get engagement photos taken.   Season 7, Episode 16  &ldquo;The One With The Truth About London&rdquo;  Monica reveals she was looking for Joey on the night Monica and Chandler get together but they resolve their issue quickly.   Season 7, episode 21  &ldquo;The One With The Vows&rdquo;  A clip show of Monica and Chandler&rsquo;s past moments as they write their vows.   Season 7, Episode 23 &amp; 24  The One With Monica And Chandler&rsquo;s Wedding, Part 1 &amp; Part 2  Monica and Chandler get married. <br>
Monica and Chandler continue to hit their milestones in this season, as they get married. Definitely the biggest wedding in the entire series, the entire season is a lead-up to the big day, with the actual wedding taking up the two-part Friends finale.
Once again, there are some ups and downs surrounding the upcoming nuptials, such as Chandler&rsquo;s fear of becoming like his parents, and Monica&rsquo;s Type-A personality taking over the planning. However, the season continues to reiterate that Chandler and Monica are soulmates. Even when Chandler gets cold feet right before the wedding, him thinking that Monica is pregnant proves to him how much he wants to build a life with her.</p>
<p>Friends: 15 Quotes That Prove Chandler &amp; Monica Are Perfect For Each Other
The best Chandler and Monica quotes show why they&rsquo;re perfect for each other and the most stable couple in Friends.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Enjoy Married Life
Season 8</p>
<p>Season 8, Episode 24  &ldquo;The One Where Rachel Has A Baby, Part 2&rdquo;  Monica and Chandler decide to have a baby. <br>
Once Monica and Chandler return from their honeymoon, Friends does a great job of showing them settle into their most normal and least chaotic relationship phase to date. It makes for a fairly normal season for the two which is not necessarily a bad thing as the viewers get to enjoy seeing them explore their early days of marriage.
This includes hijinks like Monica opening all the wedding gifts without Chandler and dealing with a maid whom Monica suspects of stealing. However, they take another big step forward at the end of the season when deciding to have a baby.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Go Long-Distance And Try For Kids
Season 9</p>
<p>Season 9, Episode 2  &ldquo;The One Where Emma Cries&rdquo;  Chandler falls asleep in a meeting and has to relocate to Tulsa.   Season 9, Episode 10  &ldquo;The One With Christmas In Tulsa&rdquo;  Chandler quits his job and moves home.   Season 9, episode 21  &ldquo;The One With The Fertility Test&rdquo;  Chandler and Monica take fertility tests, and learn that they cannot get pregnant.   Season 9, episode 22  &ldquo;The One With The Donor&rdquo;  Chandler and Monica decide to adopt a baby. <br>
After the relative peacefulness of season 8, season 9 shakes things up for Monica and Chandler a little. One of the biggest changes over the course of this season has to do with Chandler&rsquo;s job taking him to Tulsa. Their time attempting long-distance is a great arc, as it adds some more struggles to their relationship. However, Chandler eventually quits his job and looks for a career he is passionate about.
Eventually, though, they are back together in New York, and it&rsquo;s time for the next milestone - having kids. This is where the series creates another issue for them, as they find out that it is highly unlikely that Monica will be able to become pregnant, and they struggle to deal with the news. It is a heavy storyline for the show and only makes them a more endearing couple.</p>
<p>Matthew Perry Blocking A Controversial Friends Story Saved Chandler&rsquo;s Character (&amp; The Show)
The late Matthew Perry took a stand against a controversial Friends storyline, ultimately saving Chandler&rsquo;s character and the show as a whole.</p>
<p>Chandler And Monica Adopt And Move Out
Season 10</p>
<p>Season 10, episode 8  &ldquo;The One With The Late Thanksgiving&rdquo;  Chandler and Monica find out they have been chosen to be parents   Season 10, episode 10  &ldquo;The One Where Chandler Gets Caught&rdquo;  Chandler and Monica reveal that they have bought a house   Season 10, episode 17  &ldquo;The Last One&rdquo;  Erica gives birth, and Monica and Chandler bring their babies home. <br>
By the finale season of the show, Monica and Chandler are still going strong, and despite the challenges of season 9, they finish up with a season that brings them to their &lsquo;happily ever after&rsquo;. Much of this season revolves around them being chosen as adoptive parents by Erica, a pregnant woman from Ohio.
Throughout her pregnancy, they are excited about their future together, and end up buying a home out of the city to raise their kids which becomes very necessary as they find out during the delivery that Erica actually has twins. This sets up the Friends finale with the final moments of the show seeing the beloved gang starting their new lives and moving out of the iconic apartment.
