<h2 id="literature-review" class="heading-element">
  <a href="#literature-review" class="heading-mark"></a>Literature Review</h2><p>Through various movies, TV shows, and spinoffs, Star Wars has offered up a fantastic collection of female characters in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>Ever since Star Wars debuted in the 1970s, the franchise has been known for its strong female characters - but who are the best? In many ways, George Lucas subverted audience expectations with A New Hope by giving Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia more screen time than expected. Initially, when Luke and Han launch a rescue mission to spring Leia from the Death Star prison, the story paints her as the typical “damsel in distress” in need of saving.
But the heroes - and audience at the time - were shocked to find out Leia was not a pushover princess, but someone whom George Lucas envisioned as Star Wars&rsquo; true hero. Since then, the franchise has continued the trend of including strong female characters from leads like Ahsoka Tano - expected to return in upcoming Star Wars TV shows - to Padmé Amidala in the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Not only have past projects proven this, but the franchise will continue to give female characters the spotlight in upcoming Star Wars movies centering on the likes of Rey Skywalker and more.</p>
<p>Star Wars: New Jedi Order - Cast, Story, Timeline &amp; Everything We Know
Rey&rsquo;s Star Wars return is happening in Star Wars: New Jedi Order. Here&rsquo;s what is known about the story, cast, and release of Daisy Ridley&rsquo;s film.</p>
<p>20  Amilyn Holdo
The Last Jedi&rsquo;s Holdo was divisive, but an intriguing sequel trilogy addition to Star Wars nonetheless.</p>
<p>Played by  Laura Dern   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Last Jedi <br>
Laura Dern’s Admiral Holdo had the extremely daunting task of fulfilling Leia&rsquo;s role as leader of the Resistance after Leia was attacked by Kylo Ren at the end of Star Wars: The Last Jedi’s first act. While reckoning with the Resistance’s survival, Holdo also had to fend off the First Order from wiping out the remains of the rebels. If that was not enough, Holdo was responsible for quelling Poe Dameron&rsquo;s attempt at mutiny.
In light of these various trials and tribulations, Holdo proved herself an adept military leader who came up with a great survival plan to save the lives of the Resistance’s fighters. Furthermore, her sacrifice provided one of the most jaw-dropping spectacles in the entire sequel trilogy which simultaneously saved the lives of her soldiers. Through this, Holdo proved she was an inspirational leader and a Star Wars hero who will hopefully have the early days of her career fleshed out in future projects.</p>
<p>19  Ellian Zahra
Princess Leia&rsquo;s nemesis and the protégé of Grand Moff Tarkin himself</p>
<p>First Appearance  Star Wars (2020) #1 by Charles Soule &amp; Jesus Saiz <br>
One of the most chilling characters created in years, Ellian Zahra was the protégé of Grand Moff Tarkin, and she swore revenge against the Rebel Alliance after his death. Zahra is a tactical genius, and she came within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of crushing the Rebel Alliance in the months after the Battle of Hoth. She was only undermined by her obsession with Princess Leia, who became Zahra&rsquo;s rival; this dark obsession made Zahra a surprisingly compelling character, as she came close to breaking Leia as well as the entire rebellion.</p>
<p>18  Lourna Dee
A treacherous member of the Nihil who has her own selfish agenda</p>
<p>First Appearance  Light of the Jedi by Charles Soule <br>
One of the greatest villains of the High Republic Era, living some 200 years before the Star Wars prequel trilogy, Lourna Dee is a complex and inspiring villain who is utterly self-interested and self-absorbed. She became a member of the space pirates known as the Nihil, rising through their ranks to a position of power, only to be betrayed. Lourna Dee is a survivor at heart, though, and she continues to further her own agenda; she&rsquo;s a wild card, and that makes her tremendously exciting as the story of Star Wars: The High Republic continues.</p>
<p>17  Maz Kanata
The Force Awakens&rsquo; aged alien proved to be one of the most intriguing Star Wars characters of the Disney era.</p>
<p>Played by  Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Force Awakens <br>
Lupita Nyong&rsquo;o&rsquo;s Maz Kanata may just be one of the wisest beings in a galaxy far, far away. Ma has had a long and successful life, one which saw her interact with many of the greats from Star Wars&rsquo; history. Not only was she talented with a blaster and jetpack, but her words also packed their own poignancy. Kanata is undoubtedly a straight shooter and a calm speaker, using her influence in the galaxy to create a peaceful location where conflict is halted in the name of diplomacy, friendship, negotiation, and good company.</p>
<p>16  Shaak Ti
The Jedi Master of the prequel era stands tall among her Force-wielding peers.</p>
<p>Played by  Orli Shoshan and Tasia Valenza   First Appearance  Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones <br>
Shaak Ti comes from the peaceful Togruta race and proved herself to be a masterful Jedi. Rising through the ranks, she eventually served as a member of the Jedi High Council. Shaak Ti fought alongside her Jedi brethren as they fought back the advances of the Separatist army in the waning days of the Republic. As a General in the Grand Army of the Republic, she actively took part in the training of the clone soldiers. Sadly, Shaak Ti was killed by Anakin Skywalker as she meditated at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant during the tragedy of Order 66.
Where Shaak Ti&rsquo;s character shone beyond her overall arc, however, was in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. From the bravery and prowess shown at the Battle of Kamino to her dedication to aiding the clone trooper Fives, Shaak Ti&rsquo;s true heart was on display in the animated show. The latter arc specifically showed Shaak Ti&rsquo;s compassion as she attempted to help Fives root out the issue of the inhibitor chips, aiding in presenting her as one of Star Wars&rsquo; stronger, albeit underutilized, female characters.</p>
<p>15  Omega
The Bad Batch&rsquo;s newest member has solidified herself as an adorable, easily lovable member of Star Wars&rsquo; female characters.</p>
<p>Voiced by  Michelle Ang   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 1, episode 1 - &ldquo;Aftermath&rdquo; <br>
When it was confirmed that Star Wars: The Bad Batch would include a child member of the titular Clone Force 99, many feared the worst. Star Wars&rsquo; track record with young characters under George Lucas was passable at best and annoyingly misguided at worst. However, Omega proved these fears wrong by becoming a beloved member of Star Wars canon. Michelle Ang&rsquo;s voicework helps to imbue Omega with a wonderful personality, devoid of the pitfalls that can make child characters somewhat irritating in Star Wars.
Besides Omega&rsquo;s colorful personality, Star Wars: The Bad Batch&rsquo;s writers do an excellent job of making the character emotionally investable. From her desire to do what is right to her connections to the titular Batch, Omega becomes a character that both the members of Clone Force 99 and the audience wish to protect. Through this alone, Omega becomes one of Star Wars&rsquo; best female characters, but what helps her shine is her bravery, tenacity, competence, and pure heart.</p>
<p>14  Zeen Mrala
A would-be Padawan whose story shines a light on what it really means to be a Jedi</p>
<p>First Appearance  Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures (2021) #1 by Daniel José Older and Harvey Tolibao <br>
A major character in the High Republic Era, Zeen Mrala grew up in a community who fear the Force - which meant she had repressed her own Force-sensitivity for most of her life. Her powers exposed during a planetary disaster, Zeen was recruited by the Jedi and began to learn from Master Yoda himself. She proved a natural with the Force, even if she was too old to become a Padawan.
There&rsquo;s a striking parallel between Zeen&rsquo;s Force-sensitivity and her relationship with Jedi Padawan Lula Talisola, with the two gradually falling in love with one another. Zeen has repressed the Force for years, and Lula struggles with the sense she too is repressing a part of herself. This has become one of Star Wars&rsquo; most beautiful love stories, and it continues in Star Wars: The High Republic Phase III, with Zeen and Lula reunited in the wake of tragedy in Daniel José Older, Harvey Tolibao, and Kevin Tolibao&rsquo;s Star Wars: The High Republic Adventures.</p>
<p>13  Merrin
Star Wars&rsquo; Nightsister companion stands out in a sea of memorable video game characters.</p>
<p>Voiced by  Tina Ivlev   First Appearance  Jedi: Fallen Order <br>
Despite only having a minor role as Cal Kestis&rsquo; sidekick in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Tina Ivlev&rsquo;s Merrin made a triumphant return in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor with a lot more depth added to her character. As one of the last surviving Nightsisters of Dathomir, Merrin carries the legacy of her people on her shoulders. Since she boasts many unnatural powers using her Nightsister magick, she is a formidable opponent for the Empire&rsquo;s forces.
Furthermore, Merrin&rsquo;s relationship with Cal is one of the better-written romances in Star Wars. The time jump between the video game installments aids their coming together to feel more natural, bolstered by the realistic, chemistry-fuelled writing between the two characters. These elements combine to make Merrin a character many cannot wait to see again in Star Wars should the seemingly inevitable Star Wars Jedi III be confirmed.
A third Star Wars Jedi game is yet to be officially revealed, yet actor Cameron Monaghan has hinted the project is already in development.</p>
<p>12  Assaj Ventress
The prequels&rsquo; Jedi-turned-Sith-turned-bounty hunter easily ranks among Star Wars&rsquo; best female characters.</p>
<p>Voiced by  Grey DeLisle and Nika Futterman   First Appearance  Jedi: Mace Windu by John Ostrander and Jan Ostrander <br>
Voiced by Grey DeLisle in Legends and by Nika Futterman in canon, Assaj Ventress was a complicated character who wished to prove herself to Count Dooku throughout most of The Clone Wars. While Dooku saw her usefulness as an assassin and a piece in his master&rsquo;s grand scheme, she was never considered worthy enough to be a true Sith. Still, even after being outcast by the Separatists, she managed to cause trouble for both the Republic and Dooku. As an assassin, she had notable conflicts with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, proving to be a worthy adversary of the Jedi</p>
<p>Who Is Asajj Ventress? The Sith You May Have Missed In Star Wars Prequels Explained
The era of the Star Wars prequels introduced several new characters, with one being a hidden Sith warrior working for the dark side: Asajj Ventress.</p>
<p>Despite her past grievances with the Jedi, Asajj&rsquo;s character only improved when she began to team up with her former enemies. From her work with Ahsoka Tano and Anakin Skywalker in clearing the former&rsquo;s name as a terrorist to her alliance with Quinlan Vos in Star Wars: Dark Disciple, Asajj&rsquo;s character continued to improve as her sympathetic, emotional relationships were unpacked. Bolstered further by more material in Star Wars: The Bad Batch season 3, Asajj Ventress is easily one of Star Wars&rsquo; best female characters.</p>
<p>11  Mon Mothma
The heart of Star Wars&rsquo; Rebel Alliance has always been compelling, yet has flourished under Disney&rsquo;s tenure.</p>
<p>Played by  Caroline Blakiston and Genevieve O&rsquo;Reilly   First Appearance  Star Wars <br>
In the Star Wars original trilogy, Caroline Blakiston&rsquo;s Mon Mothma was presented as the respectable leader of the Rebel Alliance. She played a critical role in the attack against the Death Star II, and without her, the Rebel Alliance would have never made it out of its infancy. However, recent Star Wars properties including Andor and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story took Mon Mothma and painted her in an entirely new light.
Played by Genevieve O&rsquo;Reilly, Andor&rsquo;s Mothma is forced to deal with political problems in her own home. By giving a rare look into how a conspiring Rebel deals with the Empire&rsquo;s growing tyranny under the very nose of Palpatine, the series forces the audience to sympathize with Mothma&rsquo;s plight. The excellent writing of Andor allowed Mon Mothma to become one of Star Wars’ most intriguing, well-written characters whom audiences could not wait to see more of in the story of Andor season 2.</p>
<p>10  Avar Kriss
The light of the Jedi is dangerously flawed</p>
<p>First Appearance  Light of the Jedi by Charles Soule <br>
Introduced in Charles Soule&rsquo;s Light of the Jedi, Avar Kriss is one of the most prominent Jedi of the High Republic Era. Avar is a powerful Jedi Master who perceives the Force as music, and this allows her to coordinate the &ldquo;songs&rdquo; of her Jedi allies through the Force in something similar to a Legends battle meld. Avar&rsquo;s unique understanding of the Force makes her a truly fascinating character, and one of the most compelling heroes of the entire transmedia project.
There&rsquo;s a sense in which Star Wars: The High Republic is a deconstruction of Avar Kriss, the greatest Jedi of her age. Her phenomenal achievements led her to become Marshal of Starlight Beacon, a Jedi space station on the Outer Rim, but she suffered terrible grief after this was destroyed by the Nihil. With the Nihil ascendant, Avar now struggles with an old attachment to a fellow Jedi Master, who has understandably reached out to offer comfort in her grief. Avar&rsquo;s story is as yet incomplete, andit will be thrilling to see where it goes.</p>
<p>9  Jyn Erso
The daughter of Galen Erso sacrificed everything for the future of the galaxy.</p>
<p>Played by  Felicity Jones   First Appearance  Rogue One: A Star Wars Story <br>
Felicity Jones plays Jyn Erso, the daughter of the scientist behind the creation of the first Death Star, Galen Erso. Jyn was a powerful force in the fledgling Rebel Alliance. Raised by freedom fighter Saw Gerrera - a famous hero of the resistance movement - the life of a rebel was all she&rsquo;d ever known. In Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, she led the mission to retrieve her father before he completed his mission for the Empire. In one of the most daring heists in all of Star Wars, Jyn and her crew stole the Death Star schematics from the Empire.
Jan retrieved the plans alongside her allies, but the attempt cost them their lives. This sacrifice allowed the Rebel Alliance to defeat the Empire which is undoubtedly enough to prove why Jyn can be counted among Star Wars’ best female characters. Reinforced by Jones&rsquo; incredible performance as a grief-stricken thus numb Jyn, the character becomes instantly relatable and likable. As her tough exterior falls away to reveal the heart-of-gold Rebel beneath, Jyn becomes an endlessly intriguing character whose death ranks among the biggest disappointments in all of Star Wars if only due to her story being cut unceremoniously short.</p>
<p>8  Hera Syndulla
The daring Rebellion pilot is one of the most prevalent characters in Disney&rsquo;s Star Wars.</p>
<p>Played by  Vanessa Marshall and Mary Elizabeth Winstead   First Appearance  Star Wars Rebels: &ldquo;The Machine in the Ghost&rdquo; <br>
Voiced by Vanessa Marshall, Hera Syndulla proved herself to be a powerful ally to the Rebel Alliance with her expert piloting skills in Star Wars Rebels. Along with her lover - the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus, and the rest of their crew on the Ghost, were instrumental in freeing the planet Lothal from the Empire&rsquo;s grips. For her efforts, Syndulla was promoted to General in the Rebel Alliance and given a squadron of fighters to command. She made her live-action debut in the Ahsoka series played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead where her further heroic efforts were highlighted.
What makes Hera so inherently likable are her maternal instincts. Her connections with Ezra Bridger and Sabine Wren allow the steely Rebellion pilot to show a softer, motherly side that anyone would warm to. Combined with her genuine piloting skills and her constant dedication to fighting against tyranny, Hera became one of the best animated characters Star Wars has ever seen. This translated to live-action when Hera&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to fighting the Empire continued in Ahsoka, leading many to eagerly await her return in season 2.</p>
<p>Ahsoka Season 2: Story, Updates, Everything We Know
Ahsoka season 2 has finally been confirmed by Star Wars, and the story is now in development. Here&rsquo;s everything we know about the project.</p>
<p>7  Doctor Aphra
Star Wars&rsquo; twisted version of Indiana Jones</p>
<p>First Appearance  Darth Vader (2015) #3 by Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca <br>
Created by Kieron Gillen and Salvador Larroca back in 2015, Doctor Chelli Lona Aphra was introduced as Star Wars&rsquo; corrupt version of Indiana Jones - an archaeologist-adventurer who finds valuable artifacts and sells them for profit. Aphra has become a mainstay of Marvel&rsquo;s Star Wars comics, spinning out into multiple miniseries that have fleshed out her own personal world. Aphra&rsquo;s personal life is as compelling as any of her adventures, because her bad habits - her tendency to lie, cheat, and steal - mean she constantly sabotages her own chance of happiness.
Archaeology is a dangerous profession in the Star Wars galaxy, and Aphra has frequently found herself working alongside Jedi and Sith alike. At one point she was marked for death by Darth Vader himself, and had to fake her death to escape; on other occasion, she&rsquo;s delighted in playing the naive Luke Skywalker like a fiddle. Aphra&rsquo;s latest run, written by Alyssa Wong, has just wrapped up - and sets her up for some exciting adventures in future.</p>
<p>6  Rey Skywalker
The continuation of the Skywalker lineage ranks among the best female characters in a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>Played by  Michelle Ang   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Force Awakens <br>
Rey Skywalker is undoubtedly one of the most powerful characters in the sequel trilogy. Rey was the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine but was hidden from him by her parents. Before joining the Resistance, she lived the life of a junk scavenger on Jakku. After discovering her Force powers, Rey was able to awaken a connection with Kylo Ren with the two eventually discovering and defeating Palpatine to restore order to the galaxy.
While Rey Skywalker has remained a controversial figure in Star Wars, many can see the qualities the character possesses. Aside from her immeasurable power, Daisy Ridley performs exceptionally well as Rey. Not only does Ridley sell the more sympathetic aspects of Rey&rsquo;s lonely life, but her transition into a powerful, wise Jedi is understatedly brilliant. Combined with a depth of emotional wealth, Rey&rsquo;s character is one of the better in the sequel trilogy whose return to Star Wars in upcoming movies is undeniably earned.</p>
<p>5  Sabine Wren
The Mandalorian-turned-Jedi has had an arc that ranks among Star Wars&rsquo; strongest.</p>
<p>Played by  Tiya Sircar and Natasha Liu Bordizzo   First Appearance  Star Wars Rebels: &ldquo;The Machine in the Ghost&rdquo; <br>
Sabine Wren came from the powerful Clan Wren of Mandalore and was originally voiced by Tiya Sircar. After deserting the Imperial Academy, she joined the crew of the Ghost in Star Wars Rebels. Despite being shunned by her Clan for a time, she was able to reunite with them and reclaim her name among her people. She even wielded the famed Darksaber for a short while, before bequeathing it to Bo-Katan Kryze. Like her friend Hera, Natasha Liu Bordizzo brings Sabine to live-action in the Ahsoka series.
Sabine&rsquo;s strongest arc in Star Wars Rebels came during her trials with the Darksaber. This brought to light the fears, worries, and regrets Sabine had concerning her family joining the Empire, leading the young Mandalorian to flee from her home at a young age. These scenes perfectly capture what makes Sabine so admirable as she abandoned everything she knew to fight oppression, finding family in the crew of the Ghost. This alone is enough to make her an overly compelling character before she transitioned to live-action even further bolstered this.
This arc was incredibly compelling, subscribing to one of George Lucas&rsquo; original ideas that anyone can wield the Force should they commit to training.</p>
<p>In Ahsoka, it was revealed that Sabine Wren had a burgeoning connection to the Force. Learning at the hands of Ahsoka Tano, Sabine overcame her Mandalorian heritage and stubbornness to become a Jedi Padawan in training. This arc was incredibly compelling, subscribing to one of George Lucas&rsquo; original ideas that anyone can wield the Force should they commit to training. When her loyalty to Ezra Bridger and continued dedication to stopping the Empire were added to this, Sabine became not only one of Rebels&rsquo; best female characters, but one of Star Wars'.</p>
<p>4  Bo-Katan Kryze
The rightful leader of Mandalore is a bright spark of the New Republic era.</p>
<p>Played by  Katee Sackhoff   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 4, episode 14 - &ldquo;A Friend in Need&rdquo; <br>
After originally appearing as a side character in The Clone Wars, Katee Sackhoff&rsquo;s Bo-Katan Kryze returned to Star Wars Rebels, and then again in The Mandalorian seasons 2 and 3. Despite being deposed and denied the rule of Mandalore multiple times, Bo-Katan finally has all her wishes come true in The Mandalorian season 3. As the last wielder of the Darksaber, no one is more qualified to lead the Mandalorian people into their bright future after the atrocities they endured by the Empire&rsquo;s hand.
Her partnership with Ahsoka Tano to free Mandalore from Maul&rsquo;s clutches further enforced how committed Bo-Katan was to seeing her people live under a fair, just ruler who embodies what Mandalore should be.</p>
<p>This lengthy journey aids Bo-Katan Kryze to be seen as one of Star Wars&rsquo; strongest female characters. Throughout The Clone Wars, she was often seen as an antagonistic presence, though one who was simply fighting for what was right. Her tentative alliance with Obi-Wan Kenobi to save her sister proved this, as well as her insistence on familial ties. Later, her partnership with Ahsoka Tano to free Mandalore from Maul&rsquo;s clutches further enforced how committed Bo-Katan was to seeing her people live under a fair, just ruler who embodies what Mandalore should be.
This transition from an understandable villain to a reluctant yet necessary leader made Bo-Katan an endlessly well-written Star Wars character before The Mandalorian season 3 solidified her as one of the franchise&rsquo;s best. Her dynamic with Din Djarin and Grogu brought out a more comedic, warmer side to Bo&rsquo;s character that was never shown in animation, while her heroics to restore Mandalore&rsquo;s former glory continued to portray her as a force to be reckoned with. By the time she became ruler of Mandalore once more, many were hoping Bo-Katan would be a mainstay in Star Wars’ future.</p>
<p>3  Padmé Amidala
Padmé&rsquo;s role in holding the galaxy together paints her as one of Star Wars&rsquo; most tragic figures.</p>
<p>Played by  Natalie portman   First Appearance  Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace <br>
Natalie Portman&rsquo;s Padmé Amidala is the mother of Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa, meaning her importance in the Star Wars universe cannot be overstated. Padmé was the Queen of Naboo and a Senator in the Republic, playing a vital role in freeing her home from Separatist control during Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. Like so many others, she warned of Palpatine&rsquo;s power grab but ultimately, she could do little to stop him from destroying the Jedi Order and the Republic along with it.
While the depiction of Padmé in the prequels was not one of Lucas&rsquo; strongest aspects, it is the overview of her story that allows the character to rank among the best female characters in Star Wars. Becoming the Queen of Naboo at only 14 shows the inner strength Padmé possesses, as well as an unrivaled drive to fight against corruption. This drive was personified by her role in the Republic Senate where Padmé was constantly shown as one who fights for the people, not just of her own, but of every planet in the galaxy.
This alone makes Padmé one of Star Wars&rsquo; most inherently good-natured characters, only bettered by her relationship with Anakin. While again, Lucas&rsquo; screenwriting left a lot to be desired, Padmé&rsquo;s life as Anakin&rsquo;s secret wife was far from easy. Having to reckon with her husband&rsquo;s evergrowing, dark tendencies while grappling with Palpatine in the Senate meant Padmé essentially held the fate of the entire galaxy in both hands, never wavering in her commitment to aiding the constituents of the Republic that resulted in her death, making her not only one of Star Wars’ best characters but one of its most tragic.</p>
<p>2  Ahsoka Tano
What began as a hated character swiftly became everything that exemplifies a knight of the Jedi Order.</p>
<p>Played by  Ashley Eckstein and Rosario Dawson   First Appearance  Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) <br>
After first being introduced in Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ashley Eckstein&rsquo;s Ahsoka Tano has slowly woven her way throughout the tapestry of the Star Wars timeline, as well as many viewers&rsquo; hearts. Ahsoka Tano was the apprentice of Anakin Skywalker, a gifted Jedi Padawan with a warrior&rsquo;s spirit. She was always her master&rsquo;s voice of reason when situations became personal and in doing so, proved to be a valuable asset to the Jedi Order as a whole. After the Jedi Council wrongly accused her of treason against the Republic, she left the Order.
Ahsoka&rsquo;s betrayal at the hands of the Order was shown in the climactic arc of Star Wars: The Clone Wars season 5.</p>
<p>Later, she joined the Rebel Alliance and lent aid to Ezra Bridger and the crew of the Ghost in Star Wars Rebels. This transition exemplified Ahsoka&rsquo;s will to fight for the light side of the Force, even when the Jedi forsook her. Undoubtedly one of Ahsoka&rsquo;s biggest strengths is, like Padmé, her relationship with Anakin. The tragedy of having Ahsoka reckon with what became of Anakin makes for some of Star Wars Rebels&rsquo; most poignant moments, as Ahsoka essentially sacrificed her life to be with her master one last time.
However, Ahsoka was saved, living to fight another day in Ahsoka. This was a monumental moment in Star Wars as Ahsoka became the first animated character to receive her own live-action spin-off. The show continued her fantastic growth from what was, at first, an annoying Padawan to one of the most well-rounded, lovable Jedi in Star Wars history. Her warrior ways, Rebel tendencies, and Jedi heart allow Ahsoka to shine in a sea of Star Wars characters, exemplified by her positioning as a leader against the New Republic&rsquo;s darkest threats.</p>
<p>1  Leia Organa Solo
The Princess of Alderaan remains one of the franchise&rsquo;s best overall characters, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Played by  Carrie Fisher   First Appearance  Star Wars <br>
Naturally, it seems almost a disservice to have anyone but Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa as the best female Star Wars character. The daughter of Anakin Skywalker and Pamdé Amidala, Leia was raised by Senator Bail Organa on Alderaan. Her leadership was crucial in the destruction of the first Death Star. Not only was she a brilliant leader, but she was also powerful in the Force and was briefly trained by her brother. Later, she lent herself to the Resistance to take down the First Order in the sequel trilogy.
Like her mother before her, Leia&rsquo;s arc solidifies her strong will, her dedication to what is right, and her personification as the will of the light side of the Force. Diplomatic when needed but not afraid to get her hands dirty, the heroes of the original trilogy would have failed long before succeeding had Leia not been present. This is exemplified by nothing more than Lucas&rsquo; intention to have Leia be revealed as the Chosen One of the Force in his own sequel trilogy.
To an extent, Leia&rsquo;s role in redeeming Ben Solo - who subsequently defeated Palpatine alongside Rey in The Rise of Skywalker - almost aligns with Lucas&rsquo; vision as Leia being the one to bring balance to the Force like her father before her. It is a testament to the strength of Leia&rsquo;s character that, even after Carrie Fisher&rsquo;s tragic passing, the princess of Alderaan lives on as a footnote of what it means to be purely good in the Star Wars galaxy. This is shown by Leia’s prevalence in every facet of Star Wars, from animation to live-action.
Even now, Leia&rsquo;s presence is being felt in TV productions like Ahsoka. This will likely only continue as more New Republic-era shows are crafted which cannot and should not escape the idea that Leia is integral to the galaxy&rsquo;s future. Above all else, Leia&rsquo;s ability to outlive the woman who made her so iconic in the first place is a testament not only to the amazing Carrie Fisher who has not been recast but to Princess Leia Organa as the crown jewel of Star Wars&rsquo; female characters.</p>
