## Literature Review
Some of TV&#39;s most popular shows have had crossover episodes, from The Simpsons to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. These are the best of the best.




Many of the most popular TV shows of all time have had crossovers, fulfilling the imaginations of those who wonder how their favorite characters would interact. These TV mash-ups have resulted in iconic episodes, combining the strengths of both shows for what sometimes becomes a movie-length event. On other occasions, crossovers have been as simple as a quick stop-by from one character offering advice to the cast of a different show.
Crossovers make for excellent fan service, and TV networks have commonly used them to boost ratings and expose audiences to more of their shows. A well-designed TV crossover should offer the best of both worlds, not leaning too heavily into the tone of one or the other. These episodes also shouldn&#39;t alienate fans who are only familiar with one of the shows.

The two-part episode features Marvel heroes Spider-Man, Nick Fury, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk, as well as a group of villains.

 16  The X-Files/Cops 
February 20, 2000 
 The X-Files 

 Release Date   September 10, 1993    Cast   Gillian Flynn , David Duchovny , Robert Patrick , Annabeth Gish , Mitch Pileggi    Seasons   11    




The X-Files season 7 featured a crossover episode with the reality TV series Cops, resulting in one of the best and most unique episodes of the show. The episode idea was pitched by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, who ultimately wrote the script as an experiment as the network believed The X-Files was coming to an end. While Cops technically wasn&#39;t a show that could lend any characters, The X-Files uses its premise brilliantly, making for a humorous, self-reflective episode that&#39;s one of its most daring and celebrated.





 15  The Jetsons/The Flintstones 
November 15, 1987
        

 The Flintstones 

 Release Date   September 30, 1960    Cast   Alan Reed , Don Messick    Genres   Comedy    Seasons   6

Meanwhile, Fred Flintstone ends up in the future, and both classic cartoon characters have a chance to explore each other&#39;s worlds.

Homer Simpson and Bender are a perfect comedic match, and The Simpsons fulfilled that crossover dream in the season 26 episode &#34;Simpsorama.&#34; Over a decade after Futurama ended, the characters of Matt Groening&#39;s popular shows meet, linking present and future. While it was a good episode of The Simpsons for its era, it didn&#39;t completely fulfill the desires of those craving more Futurama. The thrill of seeing beloved characters interact made for entertaining television, but they deserved more than twenty minutes to mesh.





 13  CSI: Trilogy 
November 9, 2009
        

 CSI 

 Created by   Anthony E. Zuiker , Carol Mendelsohn , Ann Donahue , Jason Tracey    TV Show(s)   CSI: Crime Scene Investigation , CSI: Miami , CSI: NY , CSI: Cyber , CSI: Vegas    




CSI has had several crossovers through the years, but 2009 was the only time all three shows came together for a big event. The crossover involves CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, though Laurence Fishburne&#39;s Ray Langston is the only character who crosses over, traveling to each city to lead an investigation into a massive criminal organization. It&#39;s one of the best CSI crossovers and certainly the biggest, but it could&#39;ve been better if more characters had crossed over rather than just one.

The episode involved Batman and the Joker in their The New Batman Adventures art styles, in a crossover with Superman and Lex Luthor. Batman: The Animated Series is one of the best animated TV shows ever, and to see Kevin Conroy&#39;s Batman interact with an animated Superman was a delight. The episode demonstrates the duality of both its hero and villain pairs in what&#39;s still one of the best screen portrayals of two of the world&#39;s most famous heroes.





 11  I Love Lucy/Adventures Of Superman 
January 14, 1957 
 I Love Lucy 

 Release Date   October 15, 1951    Cast   Lucille Ball , Desi Arnaz , William Frawley    Genres   Sitcom    Seasons   6

In &#34;Lucy and Superman,&#34; Lucy has TV&#39;s Superman attend Little Ricky&#39;s birthday party.

The 20-minute episode has great campy banter, a wild fight scene where the two squads team up to fight the villain, and the Ninja Turtles surfing in space.





 4  Full House/Family Matters

A season 4 episode of Full House is visited by Steve Urkel, making for some classic TV moments. John Stamos&#39; Jesse hilariously teaches the nerdy Urkel how to strut, and then Urkel sits with Stephanie to cheer her up about having to wear glasses.

It took a surprisingly long time for The Simpsons and Family Guy, two of the most successful adult cartoons ever, to crossover.
